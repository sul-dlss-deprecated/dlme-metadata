The Fund was treated as a local fund and kept quite distinct from General Revenues of India. The actual aoministration of the Service was carried out by the Director, Royal Indian. Marine, till July 1942 with the assisuance of a non-official Advisory Committee of Snipping at Bombay and from that date the Nautical Idviser to the Government of India was entrusted with the above duties and also appointed as Chairman, of the I Advisory/.Advisory Committee* In 1933 the l|rajfi.^^r@/Qiwint indicated that it vjas their intern,ion to laanf- e jths lights and buoys on the Iranian coast theuiselvea and a^ request ^as made to transfer tdl them AlX-lights situated in their territorial 1 irA&gt;-^iuJL^. ^Sbiatit na in the matter were started by His Majesty^ Governcent and a draft protocol containing the terms and condi tions of\the transfer vs/as drawn up and tie following three points were also included therein for the acceptance of the Iranian Government (i). that they would consult the Bombay Lighting Advisory Committee of shipowners in matters concerning the administration of their lights; (ii) that they would accept a lump sum payment on account of lidit-dues'in resoect of oilers belonging to mis Majesty’s (Government; and (iii) that they would not levy light-dues at a rate greater than is necessary to cover the costs $ . of operating the lights in question. The negotiations for the conclusion of the protocol however came abruptly to an end in lurust 1937 when the Iranian Government intimated that they did not wish to purchase or hire any of the lights' belonging to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service and requested their immediate removal. As there was no choice but to accept the decision, it was agreed to remove the lights as and when the new installations of that Government were installed and found adequate. New lights were first set up by that Government in Nish and Bushire and orders were issued in 1940 for the removal o-f the Persian Gulf lights at those places* geen after however information was received that the lights were defective and giving, trouble and orders were issued for the postponement of the removal of the F.GAL.A. lights but by that time the light at Kish had already/.already been removed. In 1942 owin^, to scarcity of spare parts the light set up at Kish could no longer be operated with confidence and it was decided with the concurrence.of the Iranian Government to close it down ior j tne period of the war and a lightvessel belonging to one Service was replaced* ^s however the lightvessel needea extensive repairs due to her age, a proposal was maae to the Iranian Government in May 1944 to remove ner permanently and mount up the Kubtar Island beacon structure and apparatus in front of that Government 11 gat-tower on Kish Island* No reply to the proposal has yet been received. 2. Indian interest in the Service , It is in the interests of Indian trade and British trade and trade generally that the administration of tne limits is conducted from India as the Government of India possess better means of doing so than does the Iraq Government. Otherwise India has no special interest m the lervice. 3. Commer cial interests in the navigation of thp, Chatt-al^araE . ' “ Only three steamship lines from India serve the lersian Gulf, viz., the British India Oteam Navigation Company ? the Logul Line and the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company. Besides the above auite a number of oil tankers visit the Gulf for lifting oil owned bv the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company, Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Concess ions. Ihese tankers visit only Bahrein and Has Tanura and contribute nothing for the upkeep of the navigatio nal aids maintained by the Service as they do no ^proc eed to Basra or Abadan where light-dues are collected, t^s owing to certain political and administrative reasons light-dues cannoo be levied at intermediate ports, it was suggested that the oil companies should be made responsible/-:4s n, responsible for ohe payment of the dues incurred by the tanners tnat call in return the benefits coni erred by uhe lighting, service tsd^.d^the- last tyo companies should be asked to pay 6S|^%fAthe jfuli du- s The first tuvo # companies provisionally &amp; peed to the proposal provided local Governn8n'^h%3| 5i fifr^ob lection out; surges oed that if they ?/er|e to'T)ciy acon.'uributio •yie Persian G-ulf Limiting Servilee should take over irom t ism the maintenance as ntell as^mershilo of pertain lights, buoys and beae bns A e jgh Govt naa no ob lection to the proposal But the Saudi Arabia insisted that' any agreement relating to uhe servicing of the limits should be made between ohat Government^ and the Government of India* The last two companies viz*, Kuwait Oil Gomnany aid the Petroleum Concessions however suspended't eir ooera- tipns for the period of the war and it was decided not to approach them for any contribution for the present* The Californian iirabian Standard Oil Gomr&gt;any also extinguished their operating any ships except small crafts involved in local traffic. So the Ques tion of recovering any contribution from them also was dropped for the time being* The Bahrein Petro leum Company however agreed to pay an annual contri bution ol £1,000 based on average tonnage of their ships entering the Gulf and the terms of an, agreement to oe entered into with them are at present under discussion between their representative and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf* •sooOoo: - »vr, rjf-vrn.v,. T.ft %&gt; 'N ^•ide Memo ire. A His Majesty’s G-overnment have lately been considering the question of navigation in the Shatt el Arab with particular reference to their vital tanker traffic to and from Abadan. This traffic is of the greatest importance to the Pjprosecution of the Par Pastern war. It is already extremely heavy and will grow heavier, not only while the operations in the Par East endure, but subsequently as well. Although His Majesty’s Government are in no way dissatisfied with the results achieved by the present administration of the Shatt, they feel that for the future a more effective provision should be made for the conservancy and for the free and safe navigation of the Shatt from a point belov/ Basra to the southern and of the Hooka channel and the Persian waters off Abadan. 2. It will be remembered that before the war negotiations were undertaken for the conclusion of a Tripartite convention for the control of the Shatt, to which ^raq, Persia and Great Britain were to be the parties. These negotiations had led to no concrete result when on the outbreak of war, it was decided to abandon them. His Majesty’s Government are now considering the ^possibility of reopening negotiations for an agreement safeguarding on a long-term basis and under expert technical direction and control, the strategic and commercial interests of the three Powers in the conservancy and navigation of the waterway. 3. In theprevious negotiations, the attitude of the then Persian Government was unhappily a stumbling block. It is hoped that, in view of the changed circumstances, the Persian Government will now adopt a more cooperative line. In the light, however, of the objections which they raised previously it is felt that the first approach should be made to them. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Tehran will act accordingly in due course. 4. If the Persian Government show themselves ready to enter into negotiations for a Triparite convention, it is hoped that the Iraqi Government will also be prepared to negotiate on the basis proposed. It is not suggested that any negotitations should be undertaken between the Iraqi Government and His Majesty’s Government until the views of the Persian Government are known. His Majesty’s Government have, however, desired to inform the Iraqi Government of their intentions, holding that, since the navigation of the Shatt is a matter of import both to Iraq and to Britain it should be the subject of the free and frank consultation envisaged in Article 1 of the ^nglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance.■ &lt;s (\ i ' rf c r A With the Con^ltmewtt^Sn-* S'«c^hxA^ SVai.®. .

All three were of the opinion that before embarking on discussions for a tripartite agreement* such as we envisaged [? grp. omitted] for the Persians to prove their gopd faith by agreeing to a final demarcation oi the frontier with Iraq. For this work he envisaged a small commission of three persons namely an Iraqi, a Persian - Dr ?-'k ls N subject, the last to decide any differences that might arise between the first two. Once the work on the irontier haa been^satisfactorily started on such a basis it would greatly facilitate securing the support of the Iraqi pukli 0 opinion for three-party discussions on the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. Mr. Thompson objected that this appeared to be a remarkably complex^ approach and emphasised the need for urgency in tackling the main problem of the river, observing in this connexion, that delay^might easily lead to Powers, other &gt; than the three immediately concerned, seeking to take a hand m the game. Minister for Foreign Affairs was not, however, disposed to [gup. undec.]. After indicating that he had in fact aiready sounded the Persian Minister orally about the frontier and found^him not entirely unreceptive, His Excellency concluded bv^ declaring that the Shatt-el-Arab was one of the questions which he and Nuri Pasha planned to discuss more fully with His Majesty s Government during their visit to London after San Francisco. 5. This rather unexpected attitude may, I believe, be attributed partly to the tortuous advice of Nuri Pasha, but mainly to the fear that opinion here would oppose any agreement susceptible to criticism as conferring special privileges on the third party. It is in short an echo of the increasingly frequent references in the vernacular Press to the need for treaty revision and we seem indeed to be faced with exactly the hesitations on the Iraqi side that my predecessor foresaw (see second paragraph of his telegram No, 881 would develop i proposed a bilateral Anglo-Ira'qi 'agreement on^this subject. if we [Copies sent to Mr. Wiltshire] 0.T.

His Majesty s Ambassador was unfortunately unable to deal with this matter personally before his departure. It therefore fell to me to take it up with Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, when after explaining in general terms the action we propose to take in Tehran, I left with him an aide memoire copy of which follows by bag. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed receptive and took the point when observed orally that it would be to the benefit of the 3 states immediately concerned to get this question satisfactorily settled as soon as possible. But I did not attempt to rush him into any definite expressions of opinion since he clearly wished to think over what I had said and study the aide memoire with his advisers. But I did emphasise that if Persians failed to play then it would be necessary for Iraq and Britain to get together. With this His Excellency seemed to agree. 3.

Cornwallis has taken such action as he may think necessary under Article 1 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, you are authorised to sound the Persian Government as regards their readiness to enter into tripartite negotiations for an Anglo-Iraqi-Persian Conservancy Board Convention. 2. I leave it to you to judge how best to do this, but in general the arguments in paragraphs 1 and 3 of your telegram No. 127 seem likely to carry weight. 3. We think it would probably be better not to communicate the 1935 draft to the Persians at this stage, since to do so might lead them to delay their reply until they have had time to study the draft in detail. Our aim should be to obtain immediate reply to the question whether they are in principle willing to enter into negotiations, 4. Special authority from His Majesty* s Government would of course be required before any definite promises were given to the Persians as regards providing them after the defeat of Germany with warships or naval material when a satisfactory Convention has been signed and ratified. The furthest you could go at the present stage would be to hint that the possibility of His Majesty's Government acceding to any request which the Persian Government may wish to put forward in this connexion would be greatly influenced by the conclusion and ratification of a satisfactory Shatt-al-Arab Convention.

OUTWARD TELEGRAJV WAR CABINET DISTR IB UTION FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BAGDAD No, 175. 27th March, 1945, D, 8, 0 p.m. 27th March, 1945 Repeated to Tehran No, 181 M.E.Min No, 526 JJJ IMPORTANT Your telegram No. 88 [of 6th February: Shatt-al-Arab], It seems to tis that before Sir R. Bullard sounds the Persian Government on their readiness to enter into negotiations for an Anglo-Iraqi-Persian Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board Convention, it would probably be well for you at least to mention the matter informally to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. We must try to avoid giving the Iraqis a grievance under Article 1 of the Treaty of Alliance by failing to consult them in this matter of foreign policy which may affect our common interests. If you agree please now act accordingly. I leave it to you to decide how best to explain the position to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I hope that you will impress upon him that the free and safe navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab is an essential British interest, and xhat some satisfactory arrangement must be made regarding the future. : 2. You will also no doubt express the hope, though in such a'way as not to call for a definite reply at this stage, that if the Persian Government are in fact ready to enter into negotiations for a tripartite Convention, fhe Iraqi Government for their part will also be ready to negotiate on this basis. 5. It is conceivable that the Iraqi Government might be more willing to make the necessary concessions to a wider international body of some sort, representing the United Nations ^s a whole, rather than to conclude a new agreement with His Majesty s Government which could be represented as stretching our special privileges beyond those conceded in the Treaty of Alliance. But we doubt whether on reflection the Iraqi Government would really wish to see the Shatt-al-Arab M internationalised ,, if this meant in practice giving certain other Governments including necessarily~ 2 ~ Coifimunications Commission were established under ^ne aegis of , the Economic and Social Council it is conceivable that regime might be applied to the Shatt-al~Arab similar to that applied to the Danube.., Here again^the Russians would be - likely to play a prominent part. From the Iraqi point or view, therefore, as well as from ours, it would surely be far better to treat the question of conservancy as a primarily commercial matter for .settlement betv/een the three Governments, primarily concerned, i.e. the Governments of Iraq, Persia and the United Kingdom, and to avoid entangling it in the- delicate question of military security. This paragraph is, of course., for your own information, but you should be guided oy tne general line in the ev^nt of the Iraqi dovernment themselves raising the question of some wider international arrangement. 4. As regards paragraph S of your telegram No. 86, we do not at all like the, suggestion that, if Persia proves; unco-operative, we may have to abandon the idea of,securing any arrangement with Iraq, and simply hope that the existing state of affairs may continue indefinicely. In the absence oi any fresh agreement with the.Iraqi Government, it would be open • to them or their successors' at any future date to replace British members of the Port Administration by Iraqis or by other non- British staff .m We think it will therefore be necessary to, conclude a fresh agreement of some^ kind, if only to protect ourselves against being faced with a series' of faits accomplis . Do you think that the Iraqi Government could be persuaded at least to give us a formal writ ten •undertaking that, pending the conclusion of a Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Convention,: the yi existing state of affairs as regards the employment of British technical staff will not be altered without previous, consultation and full discussion with His Ma 3 esty , s Government? pENGLOSUBE IN MAjt LETTERSECRET * ft ■ VC. ^V-Vouorvo&lt;sv\^ With the Compliment* of the Under Secretary of State ss^v-i ^ or .

T T T T T IMPORTANT Your recent warnings that Iraqi Government may wish to repay outstanding portion of Basra Port debt, and thereafter introduce Iraqis to replace British officials on Port of Basra staff, have made more urgent the necessity of reaching a durable arrangement' for safeguarding British strategic and commercial interests in the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab, in particular tanker traffic to and from Abadan. Our aim must be to secure on a long-term basis a definite treaty right to control effectively the conservancy and navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab from a. point below Basra to the southern end of the Rooka Channel, and the Persian waters off Abadan. 2, Our full requirements can thus only be obtained by agreement with Persia as well as with Iraq, It is our general view that the most favourable opportunity for negotiating a durable agreement will be as the European war comes to an end. The Persian Government may, however, refuse to negotiate so long as British troops are occupying Persian territory. In the light of recent events, Sir Reader Bullard is being asked what attitude the Persian Government are likely to adopt to a proposal to negotiate now a tripartite agreement. 5. We consider that the British draft tripartite Convention of December, 1935, would form the h$st basis of negotiation. 4. If the Persian Government will not negotiate now the problem may have to be approached in two stages. # During the first stage we might have to concentrate on securing agreement with Iraq, This agreement need do little more than confirm the continuance of the present arrangements whereby British subjects occupy the controlling positions in the authority responsible for navigation, dredging, etc. The Railway Agreement of 1956 provides a precedent for a treaty arrangement whereby key posts in an Iraqi administration are filled by British sucjects for a number of years. 5. I shall be grateful for your advice on the best method of securing our desiderata. It seems to us chat financial nns- 2 - bd O 1 H X CD ch c 4 - CD O H- ^ . • rnnoessions oh our part, either in connexion with the_Port debt or with the transfer of war-timf “ilita^ instailations in Basra and elsewhere, are not likely °? r 5yS U -Lucements with the Tranis. Nor do wo ourselves think sucn inouceinoiiob desirable, the best method of approach may be ^^asis of the Treaty of Alliance. We can claim under the ireaty a strom interest in the efficient up-keep of Iraqi ports and waterways. Moreover, Iraqis should appreciate that the Abadan tanker traffic is a vital.British ^terest and that His Majesty s Government-, as their ally, are jUotiliea in. asking J for Iraqi help in this connexion. ihe most nracticable way of securing a long-term agreement with ?raq might be lo link it to the Treaty of Alliance in such a way that it would be renewed as part of a-ny renewal of the Treaty. Agreement could of course- be so worded -as- to appear to put all the obligation upon His Majesty s government, and to emphasise the assistance which His Majesty s Government were prepared to give to their Iraqi allies by making^ available competent officials with training and experience such as the Iraqi Government could not expect to find among Iraqi nationals. 6. Please telegraph your observations as soon as possible. . Meanwhile, you should strongly discourage the Iraqis from any attempt to introduce changes in the status of the Port of Basra at the present time. [Copies sent to Mr, Wiltshire]'.

Sir Basil Newton understands that this redraft has not yet been approved by the Iraqi Government, and that the i Minister for Foreign Affairs will welcome the views of His Majesty’s Government before he submits it to the Iraqi Cabinet. The Minister has, however, asked that His Majesty’s Government will furnish their views as soon as possible, since the Iranian Government have recently enquired what proposals the Iraqi Government wish to put forward for the Convention, and the latter are therefore anxious to take this opportunity to communicate the draft Agreement. /3 The secretary f Ministry of Shipping#HP m 3= I am at the same time to transmit a copy of an explanatory note on the revised draft prepared hy Mr. MoDougaH, Legal Mviser in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. it will be seen that he has given effect to most of the suggestions contained in the enclosure to Mr. Baggallay's semi-official letter of the 29th August to His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad, w e ’of which a copy was aent to the Ministry of Shipping in Forei g n Office letter E 6047/75/34 of the 31st August, while certain other changes are due to suggestions made by the Director-General of the Port of Basra. On the other hand, Mr. McDougall did not, when preparing the redraft, have before him the suggested amendments contained in the letter M.11139/39 of the 30th October to the Foreign Office from the Ministry of Shipping, 4 e Lord Halifax will be grateful to learn as soon as possi ole whether the Minister of Shipping has any observations to offer on this redraft. In particular, I am to enquire how far it is desired, in view of Mr. McDougail’s comments, to press the points made in the letter of the 30th October from the Ministry of Shipping, 5. The comments which Lord Halifax himself wishes to make are as follows: - Lord Halifax is willing to suggest to the Iraqi G-overnment 3 as proposed by the Ministry of Shipping, the omission of the words ’’which may occur” a » Lord Halifax will also suggest to the Iraqi Government the changes proposed by the Ministry of Shipping in the first sentence 0 His Lordship does not think that there is any need to press the Iraqi Government to retain the second sentence, the /omissionomission of which is proposed by the Ministry of Shipping. He would, however, be glad to know whether any positive objections are seen to its retention by the Iraqi Government if they seem to attach importance to it. Afi.hf.le_9. it will be seen that, for the reasons stated by Mr. McDougall in his note, this has now been omitted. Article 8 ^formerly Article 1 Q\. Lord Halifax is willing to suggest to the Iraqi Government the changes proposed by the Ministry of Shipping. In his view, however, the Article should, if these changes are adopted, be redratted, for reasons of clarity, to read as follows:- (1) Each High Contracting Party may introduce 'local regulations for the navigation of those parts 'of the Shatt-al-Arab which are in His own territory. ’’These regulations shall be framed and applied in such a way as not to impede navigation in the Shatt-al-Arab. '(2) Each High Contracting Party ^^-^akes that ’’except in a case of exceptional urgency the ’’navigational rules existing in His territory in the Shatt-al-Arab at the time of the entry into force of this Convention shall not be altered unless the 'Commission has first been given an adequate 'opportunity of expressing its views on the proposed 'alterations and due consideration has been given to any views which the Commission may in consequence 'see fit to makeo' Aftiple 15 ( 2 ) . It will be seen that a provision by which agreement shall be reached at a future date as to /thethe measures of special control which may he necessary in Abadan Reach has been included at the suggestion of Sir John bard, although Mr. McDougall evidently sees some objection to it from the political point of view. In His Lordship’s view, this proposal seems to combine the disadvantages of not attempting to deal with the problem of Abadan Reach at all with those of dealing with it in such a manner as to cause possible prejudice to the political position. On the one hand no attempt is made to define precisely what measures of control are in fact necessary in this Reach, nor how the control shall be exercised, so that all the contentious points are left unsettled. On the other hand, the insertion of such an article might prove to have been a first step towards the introduction of unified control for the whole length of the Shatt-al-Arab. Lord Halifax is inclined to think, especially in view of the opinion expressed by the Ministry of Shipping, that it would be preferable not to attempt to deal with this question in the Convention at all. So far as concerns the formal expression of the intention of both governments to agree that necessary measures will be taken to safeguard shipping, the provisions of Articles 3 and 8 (formerly 10) should suffice for Abadan Reach as well as for the rest of the river. From the practical point of view, however, it seems most desirable that before the Convention is signed, or at any rate before the administration of the Aoadan anchorage is handed over to the Iranian Government, the Iranian and Iraqi Governments should in fact either:- /(a)(a) Appoint an officer to fulfil the functions suggested in the existing Article 13 (2), with detailed provisions for the way in which he is to work, or ('b) Gome to an agreement regarding the hours (in relation to high tide at Khorramshahr Bar) during which traffic shall not on the one hand pass up and down the river past Abadan, but may on the other hand manoeuvre locally off Abadan, and vice versa . In the long run, the second alternative might perhaps prove to be the simpler, although accidents might possibly occur without a Control Officer to see that the Agreement was observed. In any case, whatever the nature of the arrangement which the Iraqi Government eventually endeavour to secure on this point, it seems to Lord Halifax that they must make it clear to the Iranian Government from the outset of any negotiations that an arrangement of that kind would be required, and that they would wish it to be embodied in a Protocol or other appropriate instrument befor e the main Agreement takes effect - at any rate so far as the Abadan anchorage is concerned. Such a Protocol might, in His Lordship’s view, be declared to be a statement of the navigational rules existing at the time of the entry into force of the Convention, to which allusion is made in Article 8 (2), Art icle 18 (5).(formerly Article 20 (5) . Lord Halifax sees no objection, as at present advised, to the provisions regarding the appointment of a third member of the Conservancy Commission being put forv/ard by the Iraqi Government/Government in the form proposed, since, so long as His Majesty's Government retain their present position in Iraq, they should always he able to ensure, as a result of diplomatic pressure upon the Iraqi Government, that the latter do not agree to the appointment of any British subject unacceptable to His Majesty's Government. if the influence of His Majesty's Government in Iraq were so reduced that it was not possible even to secure that, then a position would probably have been reached where it would have become a matter of indifference to them who the Chairman of this particular Commission, if it still existed, might he, bir Basil Newton might perhaps be told that he need not press for the retention of the provision for the third member of the Commission if the Iranian Government object (as is only too likely), and if the Iraqi Government wish to give way on the point. Go long as the Commission is only advisory, it will not matter if it is composed of Iranian and Iraqi representatives only; and it is even likely that in the long run less friction will be engendered, and the interests of His Majesty's Government be better protected, if these representatives are left to themselves, and the influence of His Majesty's Government exercised indirectly through the Iraqi Government. —21 • It will he seen that Mr* McDougall has introduced in this article a provision whereby, on the termination of the Convention, and pending the entry into force of a new arrangement, the Iraqi Government may execute the/the necessary conservancy measures in all the waters of the bhatt. in theory there may be no objection from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government to a proposal on these lines. Lord Halifax considers, however, that it would in practice stand little, if any, chance of being accepted by the Iranian Government. He thinks, therefore, that it would be preferable to proceed rather by strengthening the provisions in Article SO which permit of the extension of the Agreement after the expiry of its original period of currency. Experience h^s shown that there are objections to the omission in a treaty of any provision for its termination except by mutual consent, and it therefore hardly seems to His Lordship practicable to suggest a re-draft of Article 20 which would make it impossible for the Iranian Government at any time to denounce the Agreement even if negotiations with the Iraqi Government for its amendment had proved unsuccessful. Article 20 might, however, in his view, be re^drafted to read as follows: ‘'The present Convention shall remain in force 'for a period of fifty years from the day of its entry 'into force and in the event of neither High Contracting 'Party having given notice to the other Party one year 'before the expiration of the said period of fifty years 'of his desire to enter into negotiations for a new 'Convention it shall thereafter continue in force for 'successive periods of /t\v£7 years subject to the 'right of either High Contracting Party to give notice 'not less than twelve months before the end of any 'such period of /five/ years of his desire to enter into/'into negotiations for a new Convention. in the 'event of the High Contracting Parties being unable, 'as the result of such negotiations to reach 'agreement for a new Convention, either High 'Contracting Part/ shall have the right to give notice to the ocher Part/ to terminate the Convention at the expiration of the relevant period. ,, # This would at least make negotiations .between the two governments obligatory before the Agreement could lapse and should place the Iraqi Government in a fairly strong position, were such negotiations to take place, 6 . In conclusion I am to invite attention to the fact that the draft Convention contains no provision for the settlement of disputes arising out of the interpretation of the Convention or the deliberations of the Commission. The Commission is to have no executive powers and, so far as its deliberations are concerned, the point does not seem to be one of great importance. If the Commission is tripartite, then the Chairman will presumably have the casting vote. If it has only two members and they disagree, they will presumably only be able to report to the two governments which appointed them. On the other hand it seems to Lord Halifax that it would be desirable to suggest to the Iraqi Government that provision might, at least for negotiating purposes, be included in the draft Convention for a reference to The Hague Court of disputes as to the interpretation of the Convention. ?./Ir V.

In that part of the Shatt-Al-Arab where the frontier follows the Thalweg , work necessary to maintain the navigable channel at the required depth may be carried out by either High Contracting Party along the Thalweg itself. Article 6 . Either High contracting Party shall be freed from His obligation to carry out works of maintenance if the other High Contracting party requests permission to carry out such works and this is accorded.

The draf 0 submitted on 4/7/39 has now been revised after consultation with the Port Director and Director-General of Navigation. It remains in the interests of the Iraqi Government to ask the views of the British Government without delay, as advised in the draft to the British Embassy of 23/8/39. See paper She 12743/237/4 of 23/8/39. 2c The following alterations have been made: (1) Preamble and Art. 1:’’reaches” for ’’descends into”. This will not affect the Arabic, Persian or French texts which will follow the words of the Frontier Treaty. (2) Art.2: ”in accordance with” for ’’subject to”. (3) Art.3: the last sentence has been redrafted. (4) Art.5: redrafted. (5) Art. 6 : omitted as it would probably be difficult to apply in practice, and Art.5 as redrafted meets Iraq's requirements sufficiently. ( 6 ) Art.7: becomes Art. 6 and is redrafted in consequence of the omission of Art. 6 .(7) Art. 8 : becomes Art.?; the words at the beginning ' Wlthout Article 3' are added and the reference to Art. 6 is omittea. ( 8 ) Art.9: omitted, (a) because ArU4(a) of the Frontier Treaty already provides that the Shatt-Al-Arab shall be open to merchant ships of all countries, and (b) it is undesirable to incite a provision requiring or encouraging the Iranians to control navigation, and (c) the last sentence is not important. (9) Art. 10: becomes Art. 8 , and is redrafted. The power of either Party to object to changes in navigational rules is made stronger but this is thought to be to Iraq's advantage. (10) Art.11: becomes Art.9; the words 'to ensure' are added and the words “without good reason” are omitted. (11) Art.13: becomes Art.11 (12) Art. 14: becomes Art. 12; the words “if necessary ’ 1 are added. (13) Art.15: becomes Art.13; and is redrafted. (14) Art. 16: becomes Art. 14. (15) Art.17: becomes Art.15. (16) Art. 18: becomes Art. 16. (IV) Art.19: becomes Art.17; in (3) “six' for “three'. (18) Art. 20: becomes Art. 18. (19) Art. 21: becomes Art. 19. (20) Art. 22: becomes Art. 20. (21) Art.23: becomes Art.22 and a new Art.21 inserted. During the negotiation of the Frontier Treaty signed on July 4,/p V I I 64 • !940 j 4, 1937, the Iraqi Government agreed to omit from the Treaty any provision of this kind on the understanding that such a provision would be put in the Convention to be concluded. (22) The desirability of adding to this Convention an Article or Protocol providing for a minimum necessary degree of unified navigation control in Abadan Reach is being considered. 15/10/39 The Director-General of Navigation has now proposed the following addition to Art. 15 (now Art. 13). '(2) In view, however, of the potential danger of introducing dual control of shipping in M Abadan Reach'* the High Contracting Parties agree that a fully qualified officer shall be appointed to exefcise full and complete control of all craft approaching, passing through or manoeuvring in this particular Reach*' This proposal will need very careful consideration from the political point of view. It would be the thin end of the wedge of unified control in the Shatt-al-Arab, which the present draft aims at avoiding. Perhaps it is so likely that the Iranians will claim some measure of unified control that this provision could be inserted later as a concession to them, instead of being put forv/ard as an Iraqi proposal.In »'v further oommunioution on thiysubject, please quote so.

My dear Newton, I am afraid that we have been some time in answering your letter 239/24/39 of the 18th November about the position of the Hooka Channel under the proposed Perso- Iraqi Conservancy Convention. Ward*s suggestion, though it looks simple, raises some rather tricky points. 2 . I should perhaps start by saying that I think we can assume that British and Iraqi interests in this matter broadly speaking coincide. One cannot say for certain that this will always be the case, but* this is the assumption on which we have been working throughout these frontier negotiations and if this is our general line, it would seem best to continue to carry it out in all details unless we have some special reason to the contrary. I shall mention below the only point on which the interests of the two countries might diverge - i.e. the point which might arise if in their anxiety to establish that the Hooka /Channel Jir Basil Newton, K.C.M.G., British Embassy, Bagdad.very difficult to alter the definition of the Shatt in the “body of the Convention. Indeed, even to suggest an alteration, might merely succeed in drav/ing the attention of the Persian Government to a v/eakness in the Iraqi case. The most one might try to do would he to define the ’'open 'sea', hut this too would he full of pit-falls. 4. Moreover, it seems to us that Ward's suggestion, when analysed, is found to confuse two separate things; (D the problem of securing that conservancy measures shall apply to the whole of the Hooka Channel, and ( 2 ) the problem of establishing that the whole of this Channel is in Iraqi waters, or at least that no part of it is in Persian waters. The clearly specified purpose of the draft Convention is to deal with conservancy questions, and while we agree that, if an alteration in the definition of the Shatt-el-Arab were to be made, your redraft is certainly preferable to Ward’s it seems to us that the sole effect of any extension of the meaning of the term in the Convention would be to ensure that the whole of the Hooka Channel would, so long as it /constitutesconstitutes a seaward approach to the Shatt,be covered by the Conservancy Convention, and that it could not have the effect desired by Ward of establishing that the Channel is in Iraqi territorial waters. In fact, Article 2 of the draft Convention (and some article on these lines seems indispensable) specifically lays down that each party retains full sovereignty over the parts of the Shatt-el-Arab in his territory. 5. In this connexion, Clark-Kerr’s despatch No. 98 of the 5th March, 193? and our reply (Foreign Office telegram No. 58 of the 20th March, 193?) are of interest in so far as they show generally our attitude towards the problem of the Rooka Channel at that time. We did, indeed, have subsequently to abandon the hope which we then entertained that the Iraqi Government might be able to obtain from the Persians formal recognition that the Rooka Channel falls entirely outside Persian waters. But you will see from these papers that the definition of the Shatt in Article 4 of the original Persian draft did not include the words ' jusqu 1 ^ la haute mer u and that likewise Article 5 did not contain the phrase, after the /wordswords Shatt-el-Arad u tel gu'il est defini a 1 T article 4 “du pr esent traite 00 *’' These were inserted in order to make plain that the Shatt-el-.Ara'b as an entity continues until the high seas are reached, although, as X have said above, such an admission in this context only commits the Persians to agree to an extension of conservancy measures to the Rooka Channel and has no bearing on the question whether that Channel is in Iraqi or Persian territorial waters, or in the open sea. 6 . This last question is, as you say, one of extreme complexity. You referred to Rendel’s letter No. E 2600/112/54 of the 4th July, 1935, to Clark-Kerr, but as a matter of fact that was not our last word on the subject. A fuller and much more explicit account of the method which we think should be used for dividing territorial waters will be found in a memorandum which I wrbte in 1936. A copy of this was sent to Clark-Kerr in Rendel’s letter E 1020/10/34 of the 2nd April, 1936, and a chart prepared by the Admiralty illustrating the various methods of dividing Iraqi and Persian territorial waters was enclosed in my letter E 4252/10/34 to Bateman of the 14th July, 1936, A.7 • From this correspondence as a whole you will $.0 see that even if the Irakis to not claim that their territorial waters extend beyond the three-mile limit, they have a pretty good case for maintaining that no part of the Hooka Channel is in Persian territorial waters. As for establishing that it is all within Iraqi territorial waters, nothing, I think, can do that except an extension of the Iraqi coast line southwards by further deposits of silt, or an effective assertion (which on general grounds we do not want to encourage them to attempt) that the zone of their territorial waters extends to four or more miles from the coast. And I may point out in connexion with this latter possibility that even if the Iraqis and Persians were to agree as between themselves that the part of the Hooka Channel which v/e assume to be in the open sea, should be considered as v/ithin the territorial waters of either Iraq or Persia, such an agreement would not, in the absence of any claim founded on prescription or effective occupation have any effect whatsoever vis-a-vis third parties. 8 . On the other hand it has occurred to us that the Iraqis might possibly be able to maintain (assuming that it were necessary to do so) that the dredging by them of the Hooka Channel without challenge for nearly twenty years constitutes an effective occupation of thesea-bed, such as is generally admitted to be possible, and that this occupation would continue to operate even if some change in the structure of the Persian coast altered the extent of Persian territorial waters in such a manner as to include within those waters the Southern end oi ohe hooka Channel-even assuming that our views as to the proper method of dividing territorial waters were adopted, this is, however, a point about which it is only possible to speculate. 9° ^ ™ore immediate practical point, and the one which evidently led Ward to make his present suggestion, is whether the fact that a part of the Rooka Channel lies, in our view, in the open sea makes any difference to the ability of the Iraqi Government to collect dues and devote them to the upkeep of that part of the Channel. We do not think that it does. Article 17 (i) of the draft Conservancy Convention says that:- 'All dues levied shall be 0 .• intended solely to cover ”the expenses of maintaining the navigability and H improving the navigable channel of the approach 'of the Shatt-el drab from the seaward side ...” This seems to give the Conservancy Board all the authority they need:: and more over y whatever the exact text of the Convention finally adopted, I understand that provided that the dues are eo 1 ~ ec :. ithin the territorial /jurisdictionjurisdiction of the Iraqi Government, there seems to be no reason in international law why they should not be partially devoted to the requirements of the conservancy organisation in that part of the Hooka Channel which probably lies in the open sea. We think it would be found that it is commonly the case that dues which are collected within territorial waters are used in part to pay for the upkeep etc-o of navigational establishments outside territorial waters. It follows therefore that if agreement is never reached on the Conservancy Convention between the Iraqis and the Persians, there is no reason why Iraq should not continue to exact payment within her territorial jurisdiction for services rendered by her authorities in the open sea. 10. If therefore I may summarise what has, I fear, been a very lengthy letter I would say:- (l) that we have no objection to it being established that the whole of the Hooka Channel is in Iraqi territorial waters, although we would not wish this to be done by extending these beyond the three mile limit:( 2 ) that we do not consider that this can be effected by any alteration in the definition of the Shatt in the draft Conservancy Convention: and (3) that in any case this does not, strictly speaking, seem necessary, even if no agreement is reached to set up a joint Conservancy Board, so long as the Persians cannot establish that any part of the Rooka Channel is in their own territorial waters, 11 0 These represent at present the views of the Foreign Office only. I will let you know if we modify these views as the result of observations from other departments. Yours ever,I indexed v J i IfV» SECRET. ^ FILE COPY rifi- Serf8% ® ,, M ESSAItE.

Secretary of State., (formed Tahle THE PORT OP BASRA AND THE SHATT-EL-ARAB CONSERVivRCY AND NAVIGATION CONVENTION.Port of Basra Administration, since the Convention will appl^ to port lands under its control. Below is a Minute from the Foreign Office (P.Z. 5649 ), which gives an account of the position of the Port of Basra Administration and its re- lations to Iraq and H.M.G. In brief, these are as follows:- The Port is administered as an independent body under the Iraqi Government. H.M.G. have certain rights in accordance with the conditions of the transfer of the Administration to Iraq in 1922/23. These mostly concern the right to be consulted on financial policy, and will lapse as soon as the Port debt is paid in full by Iraq. In 1930 provisions were made for the formation of a Port Trust, but were never put into effect. Since then there has been no change, but from time to time the Iraqi nt have pressed for an unconditional transfer of bperty and a re-registration of the Port lands. To this re-registration H.M.G. have indeed agreed, but a change in the Premiership of Iraq was perhaps responsible for the fact that Iraq has never yet availed itself of the offer. The upshot is that although H.M.G. still have the right of being consulted about developments in the Ibrt Administration; this right is a precarious one. It de pends on the continued existence of the debt of Iraq to H.M.G., and since Iraq could discharge this debt with ease if she wished, H.M.G. cannot afford to insist very strongly on their rights. The preponderance of British shipping in the Shatt is a much more substantial ground upon which to base any intervention which might be felt necessary. This brings us to the question of the Shatt-el-ArabDepartment. 3 . Conservancy Boafd. (In this context, see P.Z. 5133 / 39 ). In Article V. of the Frontier Treaty and Article II. of the Protocol, Iraq, and Iran bound themselves to conclude a Convention on the Shatt-el~Arab, which should enter into force by June 1939 , one year after the Treaty came into force. Failing the conclusion of a Convention, the legal position would appear to be that each party the right to administer separately those parts assigned to it under the Treaty (Iran would be left to administer the Abadan and labhammerah anchorages!^, and mi ght revive and as its interest in the Shatt is greater than Iran’s, it would be to Iraq’s advantage to conclude a Convention for a Conservancy Board which would establish its position. An Iraqi-Iranian Board would give Iran, as the stronger partner, predominance. On the other hand, Iran has already made it clear that a Tripartite Commission, including a re presentative of a third Power, i.e., Britain, would be quite unacceptable if any r&amp;aj powers were assigned to it. There remains then the third possibility, of concluding a Convention on minimum lines, i.e., on lines providing for no more than a Central Advisory or Consultative Com mittee, and leaving Iraqi and Iranian waters to be controlled by the Iraqi and Iranian authorities according to certain r common rules. At a meeting held at the Foreign Office on 14th August, a draft for such a Convention was considered (P.Z. 5133/39^ and P.Z. 4623\ The draft was for a Tri partite Convention, setting up a Tripartite Board on minimum lines, and providing for the establishment of an Advisory Commission consisting of three members, the third member 'who shall be Chairman of the Commission, shall be As Iraq is weaker than Iran, IMcvJi A.&lt;ys vt \xiy^ ur*A »|- CAJ^A.

(Article XX, Section 3- ) Provision for lighting and buoying is made in Article XIV. A move on the part of Iran to set the negotiations for a Convention on foot is expected very shortly. In the opinion of Sir John Ward, the difficulties caused by the divided control of the Shatt, which the draft Convention provided real but not insurmountable.y'' any further communication on this subject, please.quote N °- £ and aauress —not to any person “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, /London, --^ ^ * 2 “ FILE COPY i—2 brSW\ £ ( r® r presents ' his THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs compliments to di . an ^’ ^ direction of the ^e^retary of State, (transmits herewitl 0 0 j^; 1 n herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

(2) A valuation of Rs. 78,96,000 to be accepted and treated as a debt of the port to His Majesty’s Government 0 (3) An annuity calculated to repay this amount in 30 years from 1st April 1925, with interest at 5% to be imposed as a charge on port revenues 0 (4) Any part of the .annuity unpaid in any year to be added to the port debt, and converted into an annuity terminable on 31st March 1953 on a b% basis* (5) Pending the formation of a Port Trust estimates of the port for the year and any proposal for further capital expenditure to be scrutinised by the Financial Secretary to the High Commissioner and sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for confirmation* ( 6 ) The estimates should provide for: (a) payment of annuities under (3) and (4) above.

His Majesty's Government would, as long as any debt charged to them remained, have a representative on the Trust whose assent would be required for any variation of port dues, any authorisation of capital expenditure, and any reduction of military and Air Force preference. His Majesty’s Government would also receive annual reports and accounts, and be satisfied as to auditing arrangements, 2. In the exchange of notes of 19th August, 1930 embodying the separate agreement on financial questions referred to in the second exchange of notesappended to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 30th June, 1930, it was agreed that:- ’’The property in the port of Basra at present held by the Government of the United Kingdom shall be transferred to the Iraq Government and the port shall be administered by a Port Trust. For this purpose legislation in terms agreed with the Government of the United Kingdom shall be enacted in Iraq for the establishment of a Port Trust having legal personality and such legislation shall not be amended, except by agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, so long as any part of the debt owing to the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of the port is still outstanding. ’’Upon the enactment of the above legislation and the establishment of the Port Trust, the propertyin the port shall be transferred to the Iraq Government in whose name it will then be registered, and, simultaneously with such transfer, full beneficial ownership shall be conferred, by lease, concession or other appropriate instrument, the terms of which shall be subject to the approval of the Government of the United Kingdom upon the Port Trust for the period during which any part of the debt owing to the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of the port remains out standing’*, 3. No attempt has ever been made to give effect to these provisions, largely, no doubt, because it was wished to reach first a settlement of the frontier problem between Persia and Iraq in the Shatt al Arab, and because the suggestions for meeting this problem included the establishment of a Board with executive powers over large parts of the waterway at present controlled by the administration of the Port of Basra, but also because the existing position at the port was in practice perfectly satisfactory both to His Majesty’s Government and to the Iraqi Government e 4. All that has happened was that in June 1933, i 0 e. fairly shortly after Iraq had reached full independence, His Majesty’s Embassy sent the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note verbale reminding them that His Majesty’s Government had the right to examine the estimates of the port and any proposal for capital expenditure before these were approved, and also the right to be consulted before any variation in the scale of port dues was authorised, and they asked that the responsible departments should be reminded that4 ‘'A ms Ma jes uy ‘ s Embassy retained the right of prior consultation in financial natters until a Port Trust was formed. His Majesty’s Embassy reported at the time that this communication had been made so as to ensure that the Iraqi Government should no. subsequently claim that the conditions under which the port was transferred in 1922/3 had lapsed on the termination of ohe Mandatory regime, and not because any doubt was entertained as to the satisfactory position of the port finance So .m January 1934 the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to the eifect that the arrangements adopted hitherto in connexion with the budget of the Port Directorate had been working satisfactorily: that Colonel Ifard.(now Colonel sir John Ward) the Director of the Port of Basra, enjoyed the confidence of both parties, and that the Iraqi Government therefore saw no necessity for a change in the existing arrangements, especially as they continued to observe them. The Embassy then replied, in April 1954, that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to the present arrangements continuing as long as they remained satisfactory and as long as Colonel Ward remained at the head of the Port Directorate. However, they reserved the rights detailed in their note of June 1933 if either of these two conditions should in future cease to be applicable. In Jul 2 r 1934 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied that they had taken note of His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the existing arrangements and added that, as the Iraqi Government intended to abide by the settlement for the repayment of the port debt, and as the classes of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty contained adequate provisions and safeguards, they did not wish that the question of the continuance of Colonel Ward at the head of the Port Administration should be held to affect the position of the port/port and the arrangements to be followed in regard to the port budget and debt c The assurance that the Iraqi Government intended to abide by their obligations was regarded as satisfactory, and the receipt of the Ministry's communication was therefore merely acknowledged 0 dr The \ f existing arrangements” to which reference was made in the various notes were, briefly, that the port was run by Sir 1T ard as a separate entity, with its own budget, any profits being used for a reduction in dueso The port came directly under the Ministry of Financeg 2 i 0 e e there is nothing to correspond to the Board of Management set up by the Railway Agreement of 1936 which would act as a buffer between the port, and the Iraqi Government,, His Majesty's Government have since the termination of the Mandatory rdgime exercised no control over the activities oi the Port. 6 , The position has remained unchanged since 1934, •pHe Iraqi Government have indeed, on various cocas —ons ashed that His Majesty’s Government should agree to the immeaj.a ce and unconditional transfer to them ox the properoy in the port at present registered in the name of His Majesty s Government, This would involve a derogation from the terms of the exchange of notes of the 19th August, 19o0 which laid down (see paragraph 2 above) thao me propercy in question should only be transferred to the Iraqi Gove rumen u when a Port Trust had been established and that on transfer full beneficial ownership of the property should be conferred on the Trust for the period during which any part of xhe port debt to His Majesty’s Government remained outstanding. It/ x It is understood that arrangeaents have now been made for the transfer of responsibilx^ xor one po.-,, to Oie Min..,t y of Communications,It was originally felt that to agree to the unconditional re-registration of hie port lands would .weaken the security of the debt* but the matter v/as reconsidered last autumn at the request of Sa.iyid Taufirr suwaidi, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affa:Lrs c The conclusions reached were that the security afforded by the fact that the port lands went at present registered in the name of His Majesty 4 s Government was* in great pari at least* illusory* and that in the last resort the repayment of the debt • upended on the goodwill and general financial policy of the Iraqi Government, Moreover, the Iraqi Government were in any case entitled to claim that the lands should be transferred unconditionally if they were to repay the port debt in its entirety, and this they should be able to do without undue difficulty, n they attached sufficient importance to the matter. It was therefore decided that she requesc for re—registration could be complied with* and His Majesty's Embassy informed the Iraqi Government accordingly. No effect was, however, given to this offer, presumaoly oecause General Nuri s Government did not take the same intexesG xn the matter as had been shewn by sasyid Taufiq Suwaidx 0 7, In theory, If the Iraqi Government were to propose introducing any changes in tne Bj^a 41 s^^gup v which His Majesty's Government felt bound to disapprove, it would be open to their to stand on their rights under ‘the Exchange o.t notes of the 19th August, 1930, But since these rights are only assured to them until the pert debt Is repaid, and as the Iraqi Government could, If put to it, prooably repay this debt at any time, their position is far from strong.

The question of the definition of the extent of the Shatt-el- Arab may need further consideration when the rest of the Convention has been decided: it depends upon what the Convention says whether one wants it to extend to a greater or lesser area; for instance, nothing is said in this draft, no doubt quite rightly, about ’’seaward approaches” or 'adjoining creeks”. Article 2 0 It might be better to sibstitute ”in accordance with” for 'subject to”. Article 5 e Line 3, 'Insure” might read a little more easily than ’facilitate”„ The last sentence might read:- ’’Each High Contracting Party will communicate to the Commission the texts of all legislative and administrative measures res pecting navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab issued by his authorities in respect of the parts of the river which lie within his territory and, in general, information regarding all other matters calculated to be of interest to navigation therein'. Article 5 . Sir John Ward has made the following commentary on this article. ’’Note. Dredging dues at the moment cover all dredging ....redging done at Abadan, Bawarda, Khorramshahr Bar and Magil”. He furthermore suggests that the word 'may'* should he substituted for 'is bound”to in the first line. Finally he suggests that the whole of the article from 'Nevertheless in that part' should be deleted, and says on this matter 'I consider the second paragraph is better left out. Iraq can maintain a channel on her side of the fairway with dredgers and keep (?) control within Iraq'. The substitution of 'may' seems to make the obligation unduly weak. Perhans a simple 'will' would be better. It is worth considering whether the standard of conservancy efficiency to be aimed at should not be described in the words of Article 4 (II) of the 1935 British draft. As regards the omission of the last part of the article, this is probably wise. It is true that an arrangement on the lines of the sentence in question was included among the suggestions made to the Iraqi Government when the frontier negotiations were taking place in 1936 and 1937. But all the same it would probably be most difficult to get the Persian Government to accept it, and even if they did so it is the kind of provision which might give rise to endless difficulty in practice. The fact remains that if there is no provision of this kind, 1 - the effect of dredging the river-bed on one side of the ihalweg only may merely be to move the Thalweg towards that bank of the stream. This...3 . This is, however a somewhat theoretical difficulty. It was gone into v/hen the cession of the Abadan Anchorage was under consideration and it was thought that, in practice, it would be possible to keep the fairway open by such dredging without appreciably affecting the line of the Thalweg. In this connexion our views as to the most reasonable description of the Thalweg (i.e. as being not necessarily the deepest part of the channel, but as the centre line of that part of the channel v/hich is deeper than a certain number of feet appropriate to the shipping using it: e.g. six fathoms) _ . « * rf '-w ft v., * . . n f as set down in Foreign Office letter •- &lt;•. d ' -shotrirdH^e sated. Vtk »/S ^ ^ zy f k A * ( (B ^ ^ t If it were thought that the point about the Thalv/eg ought to be covered somehow or other some simple provision such as the following might be adopted:- 'In those parts of the river where the frontier follows the Thalweg, work necessary to maintain the navigable channel at the required depth may be carried out by either High Contracting Party along the Thalweg itself $ ’ .Article 6. Sir John Ward suggests omitting this all together. He says:- “Paragraph 1 of Article 5 covers ’all that Iraqi is likely to v’ant. v If oil is doubtful at Fao or a railway terminus, is this article ne'cess.ar? I. do not think so. u It is probably best to omit this article. It would probably only give rise to constant squabbles and fail to work in practice. Article 7.. .4 . Artic_leJ7. Sir John Ward suggests that the words !, and administrative control” should he omitted. It is probably as well to omit these words as they are somewhat contradictory to the general idea under-lying the article. the first sentence might alternatively finish up ”if the other nigh contracting party requests permission to carry out such works and this is accorded.” Article 8 . This article ought perhaps to begin with the words ”Without prejudice to the generality of Article 5.” The words ”and 6” will have to be omitted if article 6 is itself omitted. Arti cle 9 . Sir John Ward suggests that the word ”may” shall be substituted for the word ”shall” in the second line and that the last sentence should be omitted. He makes the following notes:- ”What about Abadan and (?) Khosrabad. I expect they will want to take over harbour-masters, etc. This means dual control which should be avoided if possible. The Commission to be authorised to administrate and control the pilot and harbour-master services. ” Against the last sentence he has written ‘''why”? The Eastern Department has no particular observations on these suggestions. It might be useful to substitute for the ’’observance of this principle”, the words ’’subject to the special provisions of article 4 of the Frontier Treaty.” Article 10 . Sir John ward suggests that the articles should begin “Each high contracting party may introduce local regulations”/5 . regulations' 1 and that the words ’’and of seeing to their execution” at the end of the first sentence should be omitted. He also suggests omitting the words ’’witnout good reason” in the second sentence and putting the word M exceptional” before the word ”urgency” in the third sentence. Furthermore in the third sentence he v/ishes to make the last part read ’’shall not be altered except by agreement with the other party, and then not without first giving due consideration, etc. ' Article 11 . The words ”to ensure” might be inserted after ’’undertakes'. Sir John Ward wishes to omit the words ’’without good reason”. Article 14 . Sir John Ward suggests that the article should open ’’Each of the high contracting parties shall, if necessary, establish, etc.” He notes that the agreement referred to is already applied in Iraq. Article 15 . Sir John Ward suggests that this article should read as follows:- ’’Each high contracting party may establish, if necessary, in the parts of the Shatt—e 1—Arab which d.re in his own territory an adequate harbour—master service. Nevertheless either high contracting party may, if the other party agrees, accept in his own territory in the Shatt-e1-Arab the pilotage and harbour-master services of the other party, and in any event each high contracting party undertakes to recognise and accept in his own ports in Shatt-el-Arab pilots and harbour-masters duly certificated/certificated ley the authorities of the other party, except in any individual ca-s 'vhere good reason cln he shown for refusing to do so.» ' rhis ma y not be quit» sufficient for the Persian Government, who may want their patrol boats to be able to operate m Iraqi waters, at any rate up to the centre of the stream. —— e - Sir John 'ferd suggests six months notice. (^)* 'I 1 he Anglo-Iranian Oil Company suggested in 1936 'hat the description should be 'war vessels and other vessels used exclusively for government administrati shall not be required etc. , except that oil tankers shall pay dues etc.' Article 22 . The word 'ensure 11 might be better than the word 'facilitate' in the first line. Article 25 . This raises the whole question of v.hat His Majesty’s Government want the Commission to be. Provided the Commission only has advisory functions it has been agreed in the past that His Majesty’s Government need not insist on being represented on this Commission or being parties to the agreement bringing the Commission into being. The present suggestion is that a third member (and in fact the chairman of the Commission) should be a British subject - we may assume that in view of the provisions of the article it would in practice always be a British subject - not, however, nominated by His Majesty’s Government. Do we necessarily want an unofficial British subject on the Commission? At any rate it hardly seems necessary for His/a F' \ 7. His Majesty's Government to press it. £2§sible. a^^na2_articlg, o r FrotoooL In view of the opinions expressed at the interdepart: ental meeting on 14th august, it seems desirable to consider whether an extra * article or a separate technical protocol should not be drafted making provision for the minimum degree of unified navigation control in Abadan reach which Sir John Ward describes as essential. The article or protocol (the latter would perhaps be better) might be either to the effect that:- (a) the two Governments would respectively undertake to prevent any movements of shipping in the Abadan Anchorage (by this meaning the Persian waters off Abadan) or in the adjacent Iraqi waters for one hour (or two hours or three hours) after high water at the Khorramshahr bar, or (b) That the Commission should appoint a chief harbour-master with authority to control all movements of shipping in or out of Abadan Reach (by this meaning both the Persian and Iraqi waters opposite Abadan) or any movements of shipping within it. (This provision would of course have to be worked out in detail and arrangements for the ’’all clear” for ships coming down stream from the Khorramshahr Bar elaborated.)

My dear Jimj The note aoout the Shatt-al-Arab Convention which goes by todays' bag in reply to your telegram No. 106 Saving of the 23rd August asks you, I am afraid, to make bricks without straw. It has been hurriedly dictated for the bag on some rough notes which I made after a discussion with Ward and representatives of the other departments, but these notes cannot be said to represent the considered viev/s of His Majesty's Government, or even of the Foreign Office (or even of Lacy Baggallay!) Nevertheless, I hope they will enable you to discuss the draft with McDougall, and at least draw attention to certain points which seem to need reflexion. The most important are the ideas for doing work in other people’s waters (v/hich personally I think are better omitted), the composition of the Board or Commission and the technical arrangements for Abadan Reach. As soon as possible we will send you the considered views of His Majesty’s Government, Whether you get these sooner or later, depends upon Herr Hitler. In my case I hope nothing will be received from the Persians until we, and the Iraqis are in agreement on e s s en t i al s. Yours ever, (Signed) Lacy Baggallay.Shatt-al-Arab [93f A meeting was held at the Foreign Office on 14th August to discuss the question of a Conservancy and Navigation The following were present:- Mr. Baggallay, Foreign Office. Mr. Colville, Foreign Office. Major Grover, Admiralty. Major Spraggett, Admiralty. Mr. Jarrett, Admiralty. Mr. Turner, Board of Trade. Mr. Coleman, Petroleum Department. Sir J. Ward, head of the Port of Basra Administration. Mr. Baggallay began by explaining that it had been the Persian Government were unwilling to accept a tripartite convention, i.e. a convention setting up a Board on which His Majesty's Government as well as the Iraqi and Persian Governments would be represented, with full executive authority over the whole of the Shatt-al-Arab, whether Persian or Iraqi waters, His Majesty's Government should if necessary accept a bilateral convention setting up a purely Perso-Iraqi Board with advisory functions only and leaving Persia and Iraq each with executive authority in their own waters. A convention of some sort had to be negotiated by Persia Convention for the Shatt-al-Arab. agreed in the past by the departments concerned that since and/and Iraq under the Frontier Treaty (which had given the Abadan anchorage to Persia) of July 1957. In fact it should have been negotiated by June 20th 1959 (i.e. ons year from the entry into force of the 1957 Treaty). But nothing had been done and the Persian Government had not yet asked for negotiations to begin or attempted to take over the administration of the Abadan anchorage. His Majesty's Government, who had consistently advised the Iraqi Government that they should not agree to an executive Board unless it and the Convention setting it up were tripartite, had also some months ago advised the Iraqi Government to have a draft convention providing for an advisory Board ready for production whenever the question of negotiations was raised by the Persian Government. Such a draft had now been produced by Mr. McDougall, the legal adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the advice of His Majesty's Government again, this draft provided for a tripartite Board, although it was recognized that for a Board without executive functions the inclusion of His Majesty's Government v/as not essential, and speaking quite personally he (Mr. Baggallay) was not sure that it was necessary or wise to suggest it at all. Mr. Baggallay did not think that the meeting could or need examine Mr. McDougall's draft in detail on this occasion, but he thought that with Sir John Ward's help they might try to form an idea of the practical difficulties which would arise from the existence of two separate conservancy and negotiation authorities and the degree of cooperation/3. cooperation between those authorities which should be regarded as the minimum necessary for the safety of shipping. He thought it would be valuable to examine separately the two major questions with which the Board would have to deal, namely, conservancy and navigation. As regards both conservancy and navigation he suggested that the problem should be examined on an assumption of modified pessimism, i.e. that the Persian authorities would refuse to let the Iraqi authorities carry out either conservancy ( e .g. dredging) operations or navigational control in the Abadan anchorage, but would at the same time refrain from interference with conservancy or navigation in Iraqi waters. How would the Iraqi Government get along in that case and what was the minimum degree of cooperation which they would need from the Persian Government? Sir John hard sa:.d that in that case it would be possible for the port of Basra authorities, by dredging the Iraqi side of the river, to keep a channel open for the through passage of ships to Basra. The berths alongside the jetties at Abadan might silt up, but in the circumstances envisaged that would be a matter which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company would have to thresh out with the Persian authorities. He agreed that with the help of the company, financial and technical, the Persian Government could do for themselves such dredging as the anchorage needed. There would, however, be a problem in disposing of the spoil, unless they dumped it where the Iraqi/Iraqi Government told them to do so, or went to the immense expense of carting it out to sea. The Persian Government might, of course, force the company to help in this way, but it would not be a very advantageous position for the company, who as things were had their berths dredged by the Port of Basra, in return for the general shipping due, notwithstanding the fact that this was strictly speaking outside the responsibility of the Port of Basra. Sir John Ward was, however, inclined to think that the Persians would make no difficulties about dredging at Abadan, because they were dependent upon the Port of Basra authorities for dredging the bar below Khorramshahr, and there were signs that they were interested in the further development of that port. Moreover, they had a general and very decided interest in facilitating the export of oil at the cheapest rates possible. He could not think of any other conservancy operations which would be hampered by non-access to the Abadan anchorage for the Port of Basra authorities. As regards navigation Sir John Ward said there were two points to be considered:(a) Ships oping to or from Basra or Khorramshahr could pass through the channel opposite Abadan at any state of the tide provided that no other ships were manoeuvring in Abadan reach. The channel was, however, narrow, and in order to avoid collisions and the consequent risk of fire, it was important that there should be uniiied control of Abadan reach by means of which vessels and especially oil tankers could be prevented from entering the reach while other vessels were turning round or manoeuvring off the jetties. This applied particularly to vessels coming down-stream, which usually did so on an ebb tide, as they could only cross the Khorramshahr bar at high water. This unified control was at present achieved by the Port of Basra's control officer at Abadan reach, without whose 'all-clear” signal no vessel might start down-stream from the Khorramshahr bar. It was doubtful whether either the Persian or the Iraqi authorities appreciated the danger of the situation or had sufficient sense of responsibility to take adequate precautions themselves if the present system were abandoned. It was therefore essential that there should be either a board, with full executive powers, to control the movements of vessels into and in Abadan reach or, if that were unattainable, an arrangement in virtue of which the necessary arrangements would be carried out by separate Persian and Iraqi authorities on a common plan. The minimum degree of cooperation required was probably an agreement that no vessels should move on or off the jetties, or manoeuvre in the stream, during a fixed/fixed period following each high tide. Since vessels using the Persian waters off Abadan could only turn round by entering Iraqi waters, the Iraqi Government had some hold over the Persian Government in this matter. (b) There was also the question of berthing at Abadan. Even if no agreement were reached for the use of the Port of Basra’s tugs, etc., the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should nevertheless be able to bring their tankers along side the jetties without much difficulty. They, or the Persian authorities, might be able to take over the Port of Basra's present staff of harbour-masters at Abadan reach. There was, however, the consideration that in case of, say, a ship catching fire, it would be obliged to move into Iraqi waters, in order to get away from the refinery and the oil storage tanks. As the result of some further discussions it did not appear that the question of the collection of dues or quarantine need materially affect the proposed convention one way or another. But if the Persian authorities set up their own conservancy and navigation organisation in the Abadan anchorage, this would have to be paid for somehow, and it is no doubt the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company who would pay. The view was generally expressed that so long as the Iraqi Government had their draft Convention ready to be produced at short notice there was no reason why they should take any initiative in the direction of the negotiation of this Convention. Sooner or later the Persian Government would no doubt revert to the question, but so long as they were willing to let the administration of the Abadan anchorage continue on the present lines the Iraqi Government could leave things as they were.0 7. At the same time, however, Sir John Ward expressed a desire to see an agreement of some kind reached before he retired next Spring. The Tort of Basra had to all intents and purposes been his life work and he would like to feel that he left it under conditions which would enable it to continue to thrive. It was agreed that the Foreign Office should examine Mr. McDougall ‘ s draft closely in the light of the discussion and of some notes made upon it by Sir John Ward, and should convey their views to the other departments in due course.In ajiy further communication on this subject, please quote no. £ fo 9W'7r/34 i —not to any person by name, but tc£- ' resents his and address “The Under-Secretary of State,’ Foreign Office, London, S.W. i, THE Under-Secretary of State for compliments to cJtt l) and ’ b y direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop f ^3 of the under-mentioned paper.

If such a right is not essential for Iraq except where the thalweg forms the frontier, it seems better to avoid the possibility of abuse of such a right by Iran and to omit it. Art.6: Cf.

His Majesty the King of Iraq and His Imperial Majesty the Shahinshah of Iran Having by Article 5 of the Frontier Treaty concluded between them at Teheran on July 4th, 1937, undertaken with respect to the Shatt-Al-Arab from the point where the land frontier of Their two states descends into the said river as far as the open sea to conSbbde a Convention concerning the maintenance and improvement of the Navigable channel, dredging, pilotage, dues to be levied, sanitary measures, measures to be taken for the prevention of smuggling, and all other matters relating to navigation in the Shatt-Al-Arab as so defined. And being desirous of giving effect to this undertaking with the least possible delay have decided to conclude the present Convention and for this purpose have appointed as their plenipoteniaries: His Majesty the King of Iraq: His Imperial Majesty the Shahinshah of Iran: Who, having exhibited their full Powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following:- CHAPTPR I . GSN.b R A.L. Article lo in this convention the term 'Shatt-Al-Arab n meansthe Shatt-Al-Arab from the of the two States descends the open sea. point where the land frontier into the said river as far as Article 2. J-ach High Contracting Party retains His full sovereignty over the part of the Shatt-al-Arab in His Territory but undertakes to exercise His rights therein subject to the provisions of this Convention. Article 3, An advisory commission, which in this Convention is called 'The Commission', shall be established as hereinafter provided to facilitate the greatest possible uniformity of administration of the Shatt-Al-Arab by the respective authorities of the two High Contracting Parties in the parts of the Shatt-Al-Arab within their respective territories. Hash High Contracting Party will communicat to the Commission the legislative and administrative measures respecting navigation in the Shatt-Al-Arab and in general all other matters calculated to be of interest to navigation therein, CHAPTER II. CONSERVANCY . Article 4. Each High Contracting Party undertakes on the one hand, to refrain from all measures likely to prejudice the navigability of the Shatt-Al-Arab, or to reduce the facilities for navigation, and, on the other hand, to take as rapidly as possible in His own territory all necessary steps for removing any obstacles and dangers which may occur to navigation. / Article 5./Articl e 7. Article 5. T.ach High Contracting Party is bound to take such steps and execute such works (including dredging) in His territory as are necessary for the maintenance of the navigable channel of the Shatt- A l-Arab taking account at all times of the conditions of navigation as well as of the economic state of the regions served by the Shatt-Al-Arab. Nevertheless, in that part of the Shatt-Al-Arab where the frontier follows the Thalweg , each High Contracting Party is entitled to take the steps and execute the works necessary from time to time to maintain the navigable channel notwithstanding that such steps or works must in part be taken or executed in the territory of the other Party, and in that case the High Contracting Party taking such steps or executing such works has the right to demand from the other party a reasonable contribution towards the cost of such maintenance. Article 6. In the absence of legitimate grounds for opposition based either on the actual conditions of navigability in His territory, or one other interests such as, inter alia, the maintenance of normal water conditions, requirements for irrigation, the use of water-power or the necessity for constructing other and more advantageous ways of communication, neither High contracting Party may refuse to carry out v/orks necessary for the improvement of the navigable channel of the Shatt-Al-Arab which are asked for by the other Party if the latter pays the cost of the works and a fair share of the additional cost of upkeep. Nevertheless such works cannot be undertaken so long as the Party on whose territory they are to be carried out objects on the ground of vital interests./Article 10. Article 7. Either High Contracting Party shall be freed from His obligation to carry out works of maintenance if the other Party agrees to carry out such works and He shall likewise be freed from His obligation to carry out works of improvement if He authorises the Party requesting such works to carry out the works. Nevertheless the carrying out of works by one High Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party shall not prejudice the latter’s rights» as regards the supervision and administrative control over the works* or His sovereignty and authority over the area in which such works are carried out. Article 8. Lach High Contracting Party undertakes to keep the Commission informed of any steps taken and works executed hy Him in accordance with Articles 5 and 6, and to give due consideration to any observations or recommendations thereon which 1At6cCommission may from time to time make. CHAPTER III. NAVIGATION. Article 9. The Shatt-Al-Arab shall be open to merchant ships of all countries equally and each High Contracting Party shall exercise control over navigation in his own territory therein subject to the observance of this principle. Nevertheless * each High Contracting Party has the right of reserving for His own flag the transport of passengers and goods on the Shatt-Al-Arab loaded within His own territory and similarly unloaded therein.Article in. Each High Contractine Partv . n jtcu uy nas the power and duty of polishing regulations for the navigation of those parts of the Shatt-Al-Arab which are in His own territory and of seeing to their execution. These regulations shall be framed and applied in such a way as not to impede without good reason navigation in the Shatt-Al-Arab.

My Lord, /1th reference to Your Lordship’s despatch ho.356 (a 35 9 9/137/34) o f the 23rd June, 1938, I have the honour to report that the Minister for Foreign Affairs invited me to call on him on tiune 10th to discuss with him the course of action which the Iraqi Government should best take regarding Article II of the Protocol to the Frontier Treaty of 1937 between Iraq and Iran. 2 * Ab Your Lordship is aware, under this article the High Contracting Parties undertake to conclude a Conservancy Convention for the Shatt-al-Arab within one year from the coL.ing into force of the Treaty. This year of grace will expire on June 20th, 1939, and no Convention has yet been concluded. The Minister therefore wished to know my opinion whether the Iraqi Government should now themselves raise with the Iranian Government the extension of the period of negotiation or aiternatively say nothing and leave it to the Iranians to do this at their discretion. 3 * The Minister showed me a note which had been prepared on this subject by Mr. McDougall, the legal adviser to the Ministry and enquired whether I was in agreement with the suggestions which it contained. I enclose a copy of this note 1 ro * which it will b© swen that hr* i-'-cDougali recommended the adoption of the first of the two alternatives mentioned above and su f gested that the Iraqi Government should address /a -lHq Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax. &amp;*G., G.C.G.I., G.C.X.E., etc., etc., etc.5. I have enquired from Ur. McDougall what progress haa teen mace in the preparation of a draft Conservancy Convention on the lines indicated in Your Lordship’s despatch under reference. He informed ne that, as indicated in the enclosed note, this draft is not yet ready. The reason I gather is that, owing to the pre occupation of the Cabinet in internal Affairs and the recent appointment of a new Minister for Foreign Affaire, he has found it difficult to obtain general directions as to the lor::; which the Con ention should taKe. He is now, however, working on it in consultation with the Port author!ti36a e * 1 alB sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosure to Hie Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, etc., (Sd.)

Hit# far neither Iraqnor SfMI has opened negotiations. The question of prolonging the period by mutual agreement (os contemplated in Article XI of the Protocol) now arises* 8. An elaborate draft Convention was prepared last year by this Ministry in consultation with the Post of Basra Directorate, but as the Iranian Minister made it clear that they would never accept an executive Board or Commission for the fhatt with a British member, that draft has never been presented for fear that the Iranian Government, while rejecting the British member, would grasp at the large powers of control proposed for the Board* Consequently, it was agreed verbally with the Embassy that the best tactics for Iraq would be to prepare another Draft Convention on minlnum lines, i«e* on linos providing for no no re than a central acyl spry or conmu.tatfv^ comm la ion and leaving Iraqi arid Iranian waters to be controlled b the Iraqi and I ran 1 an authorities ac c o r c 1 ng to certain oomia on ruler-. 11 was also thought desirable to present such a draft to the Iranian Government only towards the end of the year expiring June 20th, 1939, or only if the Irani® s themselves presented a draft earlier* This new draft is still under preparation In c on e ult at ion with the Fort Director sna obviously the Convention cannot be concluded 'before the 20 tn Juno next* As far as the attitude of Iran is concerned, it is worth nothing that the present Iranian Foreign Minister thought, at the tl..eUL Q^J the Treaty was signed, that three or four years would elapse 'before negotiations for the Convention would begin. 3. Two alternative courses of action are now possible, either to say Nothing about the expiry of the period of one year, leaving the Iranians to raise the question of its extension, or to raise the question of the extension of the period ourselves now, before it expires. 4. I think the latter alternative is the better because the period fixed in the Protocol for the conclusion of the Convention is also the period during which the Iranians have agreed to permit Iraq to administer the 8hatt on the basis of the status quo . It is in Iraq^ interest to extend the latter period to avoid a division of control of conservancy and navigation especially at Abadan, and the Iranian Government will certainly wish to extend the former period, i.e. for the conclusion of the Convention. I therefore suggest that the question of extending the pe riod of one year be raised by us at once in the form of the annexed draft to the Iranian LegationTo Iranian Legation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their coaipliments to the Imperial Iranian Legation and with reference to Article II of the Protocol annexed to the Frontier Treaty signed at Tehran on July 4th, 1937, have the honour to enquire whether the Imperial Government desire to extend the period mentioned in that Article and, if so, for how long. The Ministry avail themselves, etc.*Ho. 353 FOREIGN OFFICE ? S.Y/.l. 7th July, 1939.

Sir, ^0 3 4 In Your Excellency' s despatch No. 169 of the 23rd April you enclosed a memorandum Toy Mr. McDougall, the Legal Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon which you asked for my ohservations. 2. With regard to the objective at which the Iraqi Government should aim in negotiating a Conservancy or Navigation Convention, His Majesty’s Government agree entirely with the opinion expressed by Mr. McDougall. There can be no doubt that the Iraqi Government ought not to agree to a Convention setting up a single executive Board with wide powers, unless that Convention is tripartite. The reasons given by Mr. McDougall and by you against such a course seem conclusive. If therefore a tripartite Convention or executive Board is e x hypoth e si impossible, it seems to His Majesty’s Government imperative that the Iraqi Government, whatever the difficulties of securing agreement on such lines may appear at the outset to be, should aim at a Convention providing for each side to administer its own waters according to certain common rules, preferably with a joint ? or tripartite, advisory commission with British representation. I may add in this connexion that the views of the Admiralty experts on the question whether divided control of the navigation of the river would be dangerous to navigation, for which you ask in paragraph 9 of your despatch, were embodied in Mr. Eden’s telegram No..11 of the 28th January to His Excellency Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., Bagdad. Sir/Sir Archibald Glark Kerr. 3. His Majesty’s Government cannot, however, agree with Mr. MoDougall’s interpretation of Article 5 of the Frontier Treaty, and paragraph 2 of the Protocol. If it is true that, unless a Convention is concluded within one year, both sides are freed from the obligation to conclude a Convention, then either side is able to escape from the obligations imposed by the Treaty, merely by being obstructive for twelve months. It is true that an obligation to conclude a Convention, without it being necessary to conclude it by any particular date, is an obligation of a very indefinite character. But it is at least more definite than an obligation which ceases to exist because one side chooses to ignore it for a certain period. In this case the principal obligation appears to His Majesty’s Government to be that stated in Article 5 of the Treaty, namely, the obligation to negotiate and try to produce a Convention. All that paragraph 2 of the Protocol can reasonably be interpreted as adding to the principal obligation is that the parties will try to conclude this Convention in one year if possible, and that otherwise they will prolong the time limit. 4. It is, nevertheless, possibly arguable that if at the end of twelve months from the entry into force of the Frontier Treaty no Convention acceptable to the Persian Government has been negotiated, the Persian Government will have the choice, either of prolonging the time limit and of leaving the Abadan anchorage under Iraq_i control until the time limit has expired, or else of taking control of the anchorage themselves and agreeing that the Iraqi Government are no longer under an obligation to conclude a Convention. The Treaty and Protocol are undoubtedlynot clear upon this point. 5. But whatever the legal position may he, it seems His Majesty s Government that it 'would he most unwise politically for the Iraqi Government to adopt this attitude. The Persian Government are anxious for a Convention giving them some degree of control over all the waters of the Shatt-el-Arah, and in the hest of circumstances it is not going to he easy for the Iraqi Government to face this demand without making concessions to Iraqi interests or alternatively endangering the frontier settlement. But the attitude suggested would make the task almost impossible. If, after one year, the Iraqi Government were to claim that they no longer had to conclude a Convention and say that they did not mean to do so, the Persian Government would prohahly take the line, which might he unsound legally, hut which it would in practice he difficult to oppose, that because one of the Articles of the Treaty had not been fulfilled, the whole Treaty was invalid and the frontier settlement was null and void. The Iraqi Government would do much better to accept the fact that if no Convention is concluded within twelve months from the exchange of ratifications the obligation to conclude it continues indefinitely, hut the control of the Abadan anchorage passes (failing agreement with the Persian Government to the contrary) to Persia. 6. With regard to the question of tactics, namely whether or not the Iraqis should take the initiative in producing a draft Convention, there is evidently much to he said on both sides, hut the following course might in general he the most satisfactory. The Iraqi Government should prepare their draft Convention and, furthermore, should/should prepare it on minimum lines, i.e. on lines providing for no more than a central advisory or consultative commission and leaving Xraq^i and Persian waters to he controlled hy the Iraqi and Persian authorities according to certain common rules. They should not, however, he in a hurry to produce this draft Convention to the Persian Government. When the Persian Government intimate that they v/ish discussions for a Convention to begin, the Iraqi Government can produce their draft in order to get it in first. If, hy any chance, the Persian Government themselves hand in a draft when asking for the discussions to begin, the Iraqi Government can immediately hand over their own draft in exchange, so that as far as the time factor is concerned neither takes precedence over the other. If the Persian Government take no action at all the Iraqi Government should produce their draft towards the end of the twelve months following the exchange of ratifications. 7. If the Persian Government press when the time comes for a joint executive Board, the best tactics for the Iraqi Government to adox^t might he to insist that, as the sole condition^ under which they could agree to it, the Board should he tripartite and the third member should he that of the Power with the biggest shipping interest. It may he a foregone conclusion that the Persian Government would not accept this, hut if the Iraqi Government refuse to accept anything else along these lines, then the negotiators would he more or less forced to negotiate on the lines of the Iraqi draft. 8. I shall he glad if you will at your discretion—take any convenient opportunity of .aking these views known to Mr. McDougall and to the Iraqi Government.

P. z. 19 58 22nd April, 1938. My Lord, With reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 84 of March 9th, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note which has been prepared for his Minister by Mr. McDougall the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the subject of the Convention to be concluded under Article 5 of the Perso- Iraqi Frontier Treaty,, 2„ It is in form a sequel to an earlier note on cognate subjects, a copy of which was sent to Mr. Rendel by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in his letter of 4th January, 1938, 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has not yet acted on the suggestion made in tie Hast paragraph of the note and may not do so but in any event it would be of great value to me to have, for my general guidance, Your Lordship's observations on the questions raised by Mr. McDougail* 4 0 It will be observed that the chief points discussed are the object at which the Iraqi Government should aim in negotiating the Convention in question and, on the tactical side, the manner in which negotiations should he opened with the Persian Government. Mr. McLougall/151 r McBougall also raises an interesting point of interpretation, i. e. whether in the event of a Shatt-al-Arah Convention not being concluded within one year from the date of the ratification of the Frontier Treaty, it will he open to Iraq, in virtue of the terms of Article II of the Protocol, to refuse to extend the period of negotiation and thus to terminate all obligations to conclude a Convention. 5. As regards the object to be aimed at, Mr. McDougall has advanced several strong arguments against a Perso-Iraqi Board with full control of all the essential services of the Shatt. There is also, I suggest, another v/hich may be added. 6. If such a Board were created, the Iraqis would in effect hand over equipment worth over two and a half million pounds, which they themselves have paid for, as a free gift to an organisation in which the Persians would acquire half control, and they would then be left without adequate equipment of their own with which to maintain the anchorages of Basra or to keep open the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab from Basra to the point where the land frontier of the two countries descends to the river, a distance of about fifteen miles. Moreover, it must be foreseen that once such a Board is created the Persian Government will demand a SOA representation in the personnel of all the services which the Board controls and it appears to me that such a change is likely to cause serious disorganization in the working of the essential services of the Shatt and to give rise to constant friction between the two Governments. 7. I agree, therefore, with Mr. McDougall’s conclusion that the Iraqi Government's best course would be to discard the proposal of a joint Conservancy and Navigation Board with wide/wide executive powers and to endeavour instead to obtain the agreement of the Persian Government to an arrangement whereby each Government would organize and control the necessary services in their own waters under the co-ordinating authority of a joint Advisory or Supervisory Board. This seems also to have been the view of Mr 0 Beckett and Mr. Bendel at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on January 18th at which this question was discussed, 8 o The only weighty argument against such an arrange ment (except the objection that the Persians would never accept it, which is now a tactical point rather than a question of policy) is that divided control of dredging and especially of navigation would be dangerous at Abadan, 0 O I notice from the record of the departmental meeting of January 18th (a copy of which was sent to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr under Foreign Office No 0 E 397/127/34 of January 26th) that the Admiralty experts were to he consulted on this point and it would he of interest to me to know what opinion hey have given. 10 „ I cannot of course myself offer an opinion on the echnical side of this question hut I think it should not he eyond the skill of a co-ordinating hoard to devise ways and eans of obviating these dangers and of providing for the safe assage of shipping into and out of the Abadan anchorage, he general principles on which this could he done were out- ined by Mr. Elkington in his conversation with Mr. Baggallay n January 26th (see paragraph 11 of enclosure to Mr. Eden's espatch No. 72 of February 7th (E 566/127/34) ). + -u n + -pppl that whatever the risks 11„ Moreover, I cannot but leei . , n-rdinated control in the Shatt at Abadan, f divided but co-ord-..naboa • „n probability less than the dangers of admitting hey are m all proDauxj.-. jinto all the executive services operating throughout the Shatt, Persian personnel in the numbers which would inevitably be insisted upon by the Persian Government if a Conservancy Board were set up on the lines of the British experts draft of December, 1931. Nor does it seem that such an influx of Persian personnel could for long be resisted even if the British Government were in some way able to obtain representation on the Board. 12. As regards tactics, the issue may he summarized as being whether the Iraq.! Government should put forward a draft Convention as a basis of negotiation or do nothing and leave the initiative to the Persians, Mr. McDougall is in favour of Iraq taking the initiative herself in the negotiations for the Convention and I am inclined to agree with him. Firstly, because by doing so the Iraqi Government would always be able to claim that they had done their best to carry out their _ . 4 . - „-7 o tt rvf the Protocol and, secondly, obligations under Article II ol tne nu 0 becuase I fear that if the initiative is left to the Persians they will probably put forward an unsatisfactory draft, and my feeling is that it would be more difficult for the Iraqis to contest the reasonableness of the Persian proposals than which they themselves had put forward, to support proposals which tney v, + '„ oosition would be all the weaker if, The Iraqi Government s posino for the reasons discussed above, they decided to drop tne plan for a fully powered executive, navigation and^ tn s -hut were confronted with a Persian drai conservancy Board, ^ .

Ratification of the Treaty and Protocol has keen approved Toy the constitutional author, u,eb of both countries, and the instruments now await exchange. • i j • u t o nn ndvantage to Iraq in delaying It is thought that there is no aavanuage i mroatv and Protocol will come into this exchange whereby bh^ xreauy • ^ or onp veer (or more, if it is extended) force, and the period of one year ^ox a _ . ^ Convention will begin to run, -and for the conclusion of the ^onvcnaxui rUo ebatt will be maintained^ during which the status„quo on the Shaut 3 .

It would be in the best though not very widely applied tradition of International practice to entrust the administration of the Shatt (as defined in Article 4 of the Treaty) to an independent body with large powers like those of the European Danube Commission,, This, in theory, would be an ideal solution of the problem and would give the fullest imple mentation to the provisions of the Treaty and Protocol. It would be given substantial effect by the draft Convention based on the British draft of December 17th, 1935, and sub mitted on December 9th, 1937, This draft was prepared with the immediate purpose of testing the Iranian Government s views as to what the Convention should contain, and, if it snould appear not to be acceptable in any essential feature of then requesting formal assurances that the _stetus_quq on trie oha^- would be maintained until some Convention came into ..Unce, These assurances were in fact soughu before thxs d.i.af ^ submitted to the Iranian Government, and they were refused. The alternative assurances mentioned in the Ambassado.r s Letter of January 30th, 1938, were not asked for, and m tne end the draft was not submitted to the Iranian Government, partly Decause the immediate purpose of its being suhmxtced had disappeared, and partly because the Iraai Government was . -Dv,-t-•?oVi ^nri Tr^kish Governments not recommended by both the Briuish ana iU-Kisn to postpone ratification. It is now for consideration in the light of what follows whether this draft should he submitted to the Xaranian Government at all. , nn potions of interpretation arising ou There are two ques yj-urio ^ i of the terminology used in the Treaty and Protocol on which it would be useful to have the considered opinion of the British Government. The firs'® concerns tu,. duratioi obligation to conclude a Convention, and the second the nn-n+.P-nts of any Convention to be concluded. ^ 4-1 h!5. With regard to the duration of the obligation to conclude a Convention, it is thought that under Article 5 of the Treaty taken alone the obligation was one which might have continued indefinitely until one party showed a clear intention not to conclude a convention dealing with the matters mentioned in that Article, and the other party chose to denounce the obligation contained in the Article, On the other hand, the Protocol which is an integral part of the Treaty (see Article V), appears, by Article II to have cut down to one year or such longer time as may be agreed upon by the two parties, the period in which the obligation to conclude a convention is to continue. It may be that the Iranian Government in pressing for a Protocol in this form was thinking primarily of the period during which the status quo on the Shatt was to continue, a period which by the third paragraph of the same Article was limited to that fixed in the first and second paragraphs of the Article for the conclusion of the convention. The fact remains, however, that Article II of the Protocol seems to limit expressly to^ one year from the entry into force of the Treaty to obligation contained in Article 5 of the Treaty, with the result that at the end of that period of one year it is open to Iraq as mu as it is to Iran to refuse to extend the period and thus to _ . j.- „ rnnrlude a convention. If this terminate the obligation to conclude a , . o. j-v. p Treaty and Protocol is right, c^s it is interpretation of the irea thought to be, then it is of great importance in considering what line Iraq should take in the negotiations for the Conven- * tw if the negotiations for the Convention tion for it means that n vne t, • „ n-P a result satisfactory to Iraq, Iraq has do not give promise oi a resuir sa . a rs-r Pi vear to refuse to conclude a the option at the end of a year 10 . ,, It is true that Iran's consent to the Convention at all. it io n ^ 4 -^ c + ntns QUO would also lapse, being limited continuance of the staEl£_2S° f • a nnt it is thought to be clear that Iraq s to the same period, but it is me _ .obligation under the same paragraph to keep Iran informed of measures taken would lapse eq.ually B It is also thought to be clear that the termination of Iran’s consent to the continuance of the status quo t would involve no more than that Iran would become free (subject to Treaty rights of passage etc.) to control by virtue of her sovereignty those parts of the Shatt at Mohammerah and Abadan which are recognised by the Treaty as belonging to her, while Iraq, would be free, (subject to Treaty rights of passage etc) to control by virtue of her sovereignty all the rest of the Shatt which is recognised by the Treaty as belonging to her 0 In brief, the proposition of law stated in this paragraph is that at the end of one year from the entry into force of the Treaty both Article 5 of the Treaty and Article II of the Protocol may, at the option of either party, cease to have effect, leaving each party free jO administer the waters recognised by the Treacy as hj.o« hith regard to the contents of any Convention to be concluded, it is to be observed that Article 5 of the Treaty says no more than that it shall deal with certain specified matters ’’and all other questions concerning navigation in tne 'Shatt-al-Arab as defined in Articel 4 P 5i The Article does not indicate how these matters are to be dealt with. j-t does not refer to nor does it necessarily inpl ' the creation of any conservancy or navigation board* It is true that prior to the negotiations for the present Treaty a plan for a board was discussed by the two Governments and it is also true that during the recent negotiations a board was again mentioned verbally. On this occasion the Iraqi Government was given to understand in no uncertain terms that a board including a British member whether appointed by the British Government or by agreement between Iraq and Iran ~ould not be accepted* There is no reason to believe that this attitude on the part of the Iranian Government has changed or that any pressure either Iraq or Great Britain is able or likely/likely to exert on Iran will cause it to change e It is probable that the Iranian Government has always expected and still expects Article 5 of the Treaty do lead to the establishment of a board vested with large powers of control over the Shatt, on which Iran would have an equal voice with Iraq s especially if there is to be a new oil port at Kabda Point without an Iranian anchorage,, The present point is that there Is nothing in Article 5 of the Treaty which necessarily implies the establishment of a board and it is thought that previous discussions in which such a board has been mentioned, cannot control the freedom of the parties in negotiating a Convention under the Article 0 It would follow that a convention whereby the parties agreed upon the principles to govern their respective administrative authorities in their own territories s or perhaps upon detailed regulations on the matters referred to in Article 5 would be a justifiable objecr of the negotiations c 7 o There are certain circumstances and considerations of a practical kind which It is useful to recall however familiar some of them may be&gt; in considering what line the Iraqi Government should take in the coming negotiations. They may be summarised as follows: (1) Iran has other means of access to the sea e 0 g. Bandarshapur. Her interest in the Shatt is primarily for the export of oil. While this interest is a great one and is likely to remain so, especially if the A.I.O.G. presses on with the execution of its plans for a second port near Kahda Point downstream from Abadan, the fact remains that oil could he piped to Band arshapur^ and the Shatt coned be abandoned. Whether the abandonment of the Shatt by Iran for oil shipments would so reduce the revenues of the river as to embarrass Iraq in maintaining it, is ior consideration. If it would, then Iraq would '.ave a real interest in avoiding s uch/such abandonment and going some distance, if necessary, towards sharing control of the river with Iran. ( 2 ) Iran is not interested in the Shatt above Mohammerah and therefore indifferent to the state of the river above that place, and Iran is not greatly interested in the reach between Abadan and Mohammerah. ( 3 ) It follows that the maintenance and improvement of the Shatt as a navigable waterway even to Abadan is not a vital interest of Iran even from the economic standpoint. (4) Iraq on the other hand has no other outlet to the sea* She has a vital economic interest in sea-going shipping on the Shatt as far as Basrah. Prom the standpoint of national defence the maintenance and improvement of the ShaH as a navigable waterway as far as Basrah is a vital interest unless: (a) it is worth while to Iraq and Great Britain I to build a railway to Koweit where Iraq would be assured of free import and export and physical facilities, or unless (b) a port at the mouth of the Shatt can be constructed and connected by rail with Basrah, and Iraq T s jurisdiction over the Hookah Channel is admitted beyond question. ( 5 ) It follows that unless one of the alternatives mentioned in (4) above is possible and is agreed upon and executed (and neither could be executed in a short time) Iraq' interest in the maintenance of the Shatt is fundamentally greater than is Iran's. Consequently, Iraq could only consider parting with her existing control of the Shatt to a body which could be trusted to maintain her vital interest in a navigable Shatt. (6) The only body which could be trusted implicitly to maintain this interest would be one on which Iraq's ally were represented.represented. Without such representation wilful damage to the v/aterway, and even mere neglect of it which would in practice have just as serious results, could not he guarded against with any certainty. A representative of any other third country would he suspect, however appointed. The importance to Iraq that such a hody should he trustworthy is all the greater because the Port of Basra would have to rely upon its co-operation for dredging and other maintenance works upstream from Mohammerah. The Port of Basra could not maintain its own dredgers out of its own revenues etc. and after transferring its present equipment to an independent hody would he at the mercy of that body’s preoccupation dov/nstream or its ill-will or inertia. (7) It is already known, although it is not stated in any official communication, that a hody containing a British representative will not he accepted by Iran. ( 8 ) A hody consisting of representatives of Iraq and Iran alone would he useless as an administrative agent and might he expected to achieve more positively had results than could ever he anticipated from independent action by each State in its own waters. ( 9 ) Convenience dictates and the Treaty implies subs tan' tial uniformity of regulations as to navigation, pilotage, sanitary measures, etc, on the part of the Shatt in question. This can be achieved by adopting in a Convention uniform regulations or principles to which regulations must conform, to be enforced by the legislative and administrative authorities of each State in its own territory. A purely advisory board might serve some purpose in co-ordinating and supervising the two administrations. (10) It follows that the maximum of control with the maximum of safety for Iraq’s vital interests depends upon discarding the plan for a joint conservancy with navigation^ ^board with executive powers and the retention by Iraq, of her authority in her ovm waters and of her large fixed capital in the form of dredging and other equipment. The only type of board that might be accepted, with or without the representative of a third country, would be a purely advisory and supervisory board. (11) Failure to conclude a convention would probably lead in practice to a continued refusal by Iranian shipping to observe navigation regulations, stimulate the Iranian Government to revive claims to the Hookah Channel, and lead to continued patrolling of the river de facto by Iranian customs officials, to say nothing of the possibilities of obstructive navigation or other obstructive tactics in the anchorages at Abadan and Mohammerah prejudicial to the exercise of Iraqi rights of passage through them. It is desirable, therefore, that a convention be concluded if possible. (12) It is desirable that Iraq should take the initiative in the negotiations for the Convention. 8. if the observations above stated cover the essential points and are well founded it would seem that Iraq s intereous and obligations would be best met by the following course of action: (1) ' Present to the Iranian Government a draft Convention setting out the principles by which each Government will be guided in maintaining and administering the parts of the Shatr subject to its sovereignty, and containing in Schedules detailed regulations concerning the matters mentioned in Article 5 of the Treaty, which would not he altered so as to conflict with the principles enunciated, or m any case without due notice to the other party giving an opportunity for consultation and agreement. If the Iranian Government proposes the establishment of a hoard or commission the Iraq.:. Government could agree to one with advisory powers. (2) If the Iranian Government proposes in reply to (l) the/the establishment of a hoard or commission with large executive powers and the responsibility and equipment for carrying out itself the maintenance and improvement and general administra tion of the Shatt including policing, the Iraqi Government could then make it a condition of discussing such a proposal that the board or commission should contain a British membero If this were accepted by Iran, then the draft already prepared could be used. The objection to presenting this draft in the first place is that the Iranian Government would probably figh hard, to get the board with the pov/ers and wi thou t the British member. (3) If the Iranian Government shows a determination to have a board or commission as in (2) above without a British member* the Iraqi Government may continue the correspondence during the period of a year from the entry into force of the Treaty. Then, as that period drav/s to an end, the Iranian Government can be given to understand that unless it is pre pared to negotiate on the basis of (1) or f 2) above (including a British member) the Iraqi Government will refuse to extend the period for the negotiations and continue to maintain and administer the Iraqi part of the raver independently, subjecu only to the rights of passage, etc. secured by the j.reaoy. This course might be postponed until the expiration oi two o.v even more years from the entry into force of the Treaty, as circumstances make desirable. 9. As Iraq ? s treaty arrangements with Great Bribain concerning means of communication, especially in uime g.i. are so closely bound up with the administration of the Shaut, the question considered in this note is more than usually appropriate for discussion with the British Government, and it may be thought useful to giv- a copy of this note to the Ambassador/Ambassador who could then obtain the considered views of the British Government both as to the object to be aimed at in the negotiations and as to the means to achieve it 0 (Sgd) Ac McDOUGAL] 13/4/38,■■■■am In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - Jlbb/ /2 V / 3 ( 4 . x address — not to any person by nfine, bur to-— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

Repeated to Tehran telegram No. 2.(ft 566/127/34) OFFICE, S.W.l 5th February, 1938 My dear-Oeal, I enclose herein copy of a record of a conversation which I had on the 27th January with Elkington, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, about the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. You will note his view (paragraph 10) that the Company would probably prefer to have a bilateral convention, setting up a two-Power board, than have no convention at all* 3* I have since had a letter from Elkington, to whom I submitted the record in draft form, letting me know the* his views, as expressed therein, have been approved by the Company. 4, I am sending copies of this letter to weston (Board of Trade), Hale (Treasury), Coleman (Petroleum Department,) and Gibson (India Office) (fed.) LACY 8AGGALLA'(E 5b6/l$7/34) • Elkington, of* the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, came to see me yesterday at my request in order that I might explain to him. the present position with regard to the frontier question in the Shatt-el-Arah. 2. I explained to Mr* Elkington that the effect of 'bringing into force the frontier treaty which had 'been signed in June 1937: would 'be that Persia and Iraq would he obliged within one year from its entry into force to conclude a convention dealing with conservancy and kindred matters in the Shatt-el-Arab, and that if they failed to do so within one year, the Persian Government would he free - unless they consented to prolong the period - to take over the control and administration of conservancy and navigation in the Ahadan anchorage, of which they would become the sovereigns upon the entry into force of the treaty, hut of which the administrative control was to he left to the Iraqi Government during the aforesaid period of one year. 3. It had, however, become quite evident since the treaty was signed that Persian Government would never agree to the conclusion of a conservancy convention to which His Majesty’s Government were the third signatory \ or which provided for a hoard on which His Majesty’s Government were represented. The Iraqi Government, on the other hand, under encouragement from His Majesty’s Government, were determined not to accept a conservancy convention unless His Majesty’s Government were included. This being so, it was clear that no convention was likely to/ ■ wl -jy** _ W / ' ii i o x o i — / o Perso-Iraqi frontier_Question.to 'be .concluded at all, unless one or the other side changed its views. 4. the question which the Iraqi Government therefore had to consider - and about which they had come to iiis Majesty’s Government for advice - was: should they, in the circumstances, ratify the frontier treaty and allow it to be brought into force? In considering whether they were to ratify the treaty or not, the Iraqi Government had to ask themselves whether the prospect of ultimate divided control in the Shatt~el**^rab (i.e. the Persian Government administering the conservancy and navigation of the Abadan and Mohammerah anchorages, and the Iraqi Government administering all the rest of the river as at present) was fraught with so much danger that they should refuse to ratify unless they received a clear assurance in writing that if they did so the Persian Government would accept a tripartite convention, or, failing that, at least some sort of assurance that the dual control of the waterway would not lead to conflicting conservancy policies and navigational rules* 5. On the general question of ratification the view of the Foreign Office was that it would be a mistake of the first water to refuse to ratify* The only result would be that the whole frontier settlement would be thrown back to the point which it had reached when the Iraqi Government first appealed to the League in 1935, and the subsequent course of events would almost certainly be that the Persian Government would sooner or later take for themselves, probably by thinly disguised force, all that the present treaty gave them - and probably a great deal more besides - and that neither the/the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s Government, the League of Nations nor anyone else would he able to place an effective check upon their activities. 6 . At the same time it was realised that divided control in and around the anchorage might he a source of great danger, and in the circumstances it was proposed to advise the Iraqi Government that, while they should not refuse to ratify, they should obtain some form of assurance upon the conservancy and navigation question. The Iraqi Government had already asked the Persian Government to agree to an exchange of notes to provide that the arrangement whereby there was a period of one year during which the convention had to be concluded and during which the Iraqi Government were entitled to retain the conservancy and navigation of the anchorage should be modified and an arrangement come to whereby the Iraqi Government should retain control of conservancy and navigation of the anchorage indefinitely pending the conclusion of a convention. We thought they should do their best to secure an exchange of notes on these lines. But it was unlikely that they would be successful, and in that event we thought that they should try for an assurance that in the last resort the control which each side would exercise over its own waters should be tempered by a central advisory coordinating board on which His Majesty s Government would be represented, or failing that, at least for an agreement to the effect that in the event of dual control neither side would make navigation regulations in conflict with those of the other side or engage upon large-scale engineering works without consulting/period. 8 * xissuning therefore that the common object of all concerned was to secure a Tripartite Conservancy Board which would assure the greatest possible degree of security to i^nglo-Persian Oil Company tankers and all other shipping using the river, or failing that the best possible guarantees against the dangers of divided control, the best tactics to follow with a view to achieving this object was to ratify the treaty whatever the precise nature of the guarantees which could be obtained. 9. Mr. Elkington said that upon the guest ion of ratification he was personally in agreement. If there was no treaty, all the old troubles on the river would re-commence, and moreover all the Company’s interests on other parts of the frontier, such as the transferred territories, would once again become the subject of uncertainty. On a broad view of the Company’s interests it was desirable that in any case the treaty should come into force. 10 . jit the same time, however, he thought that from the point of view of the Company any form of unified control would be better than divided control. For this reason, the Company would probably much prefer to have a bilateral convention, setting up a two-Power board, than have no convention at all. I said that various objections had been seen to this course when it had been considered in the past, especially in regard to any board which would have full executive g^»ers, as opposed merely to advisory functions. But we agreed that in any case this view of the Company’s interests would not be prejudiced by the advice which it was rnw proposed to give to the Iragi Government/ft* Government, 11* In the course of some further conversation, ^r* ^Ikington said that although dual control would he in the highest degree inconvenient, and, if improperly exercised, dangerous to shipping, he thought that in point of fact it might he possible for the tankers to get along somehow even though there were separate Persian and Iraq.! administrationsi V*hat would happen would he that a tanker, after calling at Fao for the Iraqi quarantine control and taking on hoard an Iraqi pilot for the passage up the river, would on arrival at the boundary of the ifbadan anchorage, he hoarded, by a Persian harbour-master (instead of an Iraqi harbour master as at present) and he berthed under his orders, (as things were, the tanker underwent a second Persian quarantine control on arrival at ^hadan and things would he no worse in regard to quarantine if the Persian Government took over the administrative control of the Abadan anchorage,) The process would he reversed on the return journey. 12. I enquired what would happen when tankers lay out in the river. Mr. Elkington said that such tankers lay in water over towards the Iraqi hank, as the channel ran much nearer to the Persian hank than to the Iraqi hank opposite jfbadan. What he feared was that once the Persians had their anchorage they would insist upon the mooring buoys and the floating dock being moved over from the Iraqi hank to the Persian hank, where there was not nearly so much room for them. The floating dock, in fact, would probably have to he placed elsewhere altogether in that case.Jk w &lt; $ c £-J , In any further communication on th* subject, piease quot^ any person l A and address not to any perlon by nami/bpt to “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, Sfw.

IivhiEDIATE . oOo— Your letter to Mr. Rendel of 4th January L Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention]. Following are views of His Majesty s G-overnmenb: 2. In view of the serious political objections to non ratification of the Frontier 'treaty, His Majesty’s Government do not wish to advise Iraqi Government to withhold ratification. 5. They are however impressed by danger of divided control of Shaft-el-nrab and consider that it would be unsafe to accept situation which might eventually mean that each party would administer its own portion of the river without any arrangement at all for co-ordination. 4. Most satisfactory procedure would be that before ratification Persian Government should give written assurance that present conservancy and navigation arrangements m Shatt-el-Arab should be maintained indefinitely in absence of conclusion of Conservancy Convention (by some such lethod as that referred to in paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 2 Saving [of 3rd January]). 5. Failing this written assurance Iraqi Government could point out that it is naturally necessary to take account of position which would arise if Persian Government were sooner or Pater, in absence of mutual agreement upon a Conservancy Convention to exercise what would be their undoubted legal right of declining to continue yearly renewal of status quo_(see paragraph 3 of your telegram Saving No. 124 iof 18th November] 1937), and that they therefore/2 therefore feel justified in ashing for written assurance that in that event there should automatically be instituted some method for co-ordinating work in respect of conservancy and navigation in Iraqi and Persian waters. 6. Best method of achieving this co-ordination would be establishment of an independent Advisory Board containing a third representative (whom His Majesty’s Government would expect to be British) with the duty of co-ordinating activities of Iraqi and Persian conservancy and navigation authorities carrying out actual administration in their own wafers, and with powers to give a decision binding on both parties in the event of a dispute. 7. Another method representing minimum degree of co ordination which His Majesty’s Government would regard as safe for Iraq to accept would be undertakings given by Persian and Iraqi Governments to cover at least following points:- (a) that neither would introduce any navigational rules in their own ’waters which are in conflict with those obtaining in the remainder of tne river and (b) that each would consult she other before initiating any engineering works in the river which might adversely affect the other. 8. It is much to be hoped that, ii arrangement rej.errea to in paragraph 6 cannot be acineveu at once, any loss sauisiao^o^y arrangement such as referred to in paragraph 7 may ioxm a nucleus which would develop into regular consultative and co-ordinating machinery as the practical necessity for such machinery becaum Advice of His Majesty’s Government not refusing to ratify, Iraqi Goverrimenu present representations to the ^ 'r-r- ‘^f not^unuer- 10.

Minister for Foreign Affairs said that if we persisted in this there was no hope whatever of reaching a settlement, hot because the Iraqis would object but because it was inconceivable that Persians would ever agree to such a proposal.

During this time (he suggested three or four years) general relations could be sweetened. I asked him how such an arrangement could be reconciled with Article 2 of Protocol and he suggested formal instrument to be signed yearly prolonging the status quo. 4.

Sir John, according to his own account, scared the life out of then by telling them that if they ratified the Frontier Treaty they were bound to negotiate the Convention within a year; that Iran might be loud-voiced in her demands on the ground that the proportion of vessels proceeding annually to Abadan and to Basra is in the nature of 9 to 2; that the Iraqi Government would therefore be wise to go very slowly, and to examine now and where they could find elements to counter-balance Iran s strong position and that they should be in no hurry to ratify the Treaty until they had laid their plans in regard to the Convention.

I therefore had an opportunity, of which I took advantage of speaking to him in the sense of paragraph 4 of Rendel’s letter. Ward quite saw the point and will proceed accordingly, letting us know as soon as possible what reactions he gets from the Iraqis. I enclose a record of this conversation. 2. In the circumstances it seems doubtful whether it is any longer necessary to have a meeting. There may, however, be some points which the Admiralty or the other departments would like to discuss with Ward, in which case you would be able to get into touch with him at the following/ Admiralty. j &gt;following address Tqjiooma, Deal. He is, however, only p-oinp- + 0 • y going to be m London once again m the ordinary course before his return • Lo return - on Tuesday the 21st September. I am sending copies of this letter to Hale, ciauson and Weston. fpA\ t AOY LAY(E 5440/73/34) SH^z:EL~MAB CONS ERVANCY and NAVIGATION 3ir John Ward called to see me on September 10th and I took the opportunity of telling him that since he and i nad discussed the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab early in August we had come to the conclusion that it was little use our considering what kind of a Conservancy or Navigation Convention we should like to see concluded until we had first cleared up the all-important question of whether His majesty's Government were to be a party to that Convention. If His Majesty s Government wished to participate in the conservancy and navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, the achievement of their aim was clearly their own business and no one else's, and I was not for a moment suggesting that he should fight our battles for us. But our first move in securing our aim must be to bring the Iraq_i Government into the open over the question of British participation and I thought that without going outside his functions as an Iraqi employee he could help us in this to the following extent; he could go to the Iraqi Government and say that if they wished him to draw up the first draft of a Conservancy and Navigation Convention, it was necessary that he should know before he began whether the Convention was to be between Iraq andPersia alone, or between Iraq, Persia and His majesty's Government, since a different kind of Convention would be needed in each case* This was obviously one of the most essential preliminary questions and he could reasonably take the line that he could not produce a draft at all unless he knew who was to participate. 3. If the Iraqi Government replied that the draft should be tripartite, the first step forward would have been taken and/and Hie Majesty's Government could then decide how and rhen to assist the Iraqi Government in securing the agreement of the Persian Government to British participation. 4. If, on the other hand, the Iraqi Government replied that they were opposed to British participation, or that they would like British participation themselves, but did not thin!: the Persian Government would agree, we should at least know where we stood, and would have to consider how far and in what manner we should press the Iraqi Government to adopt a different attitude. o, I repeated that he should, of course, not attempt to press the Ira^i Government on our behalf and must avoid appearing to act as our agent. But if he could let us hnow as early as possible the reactions of the Iraqi Government to his enquiry, we should find it much easier to decide upon our tactics and should be most grateful to him. 6. In the course of further conversation, I said that if 'W le Iraqi Government asked for a tripartite draft, I thought there would be no objection to his going ahead and using the British draft Convention as a model, althoughany draft he or anyone else prepared would no doubt oe altered considerably in the course of the negotiat ions, in which incidentally His Majesty’s Government would take part from the outset if the Convention were to be tripartite. If, however, we had eventually to acquiesce in something less than participation, we might prefer to see the two parties adopt quite a different sort of Convention, 7. Sir John rr ard said he saw no difficulty about doing what we asked and would let us know the result as soon as Possible.

In expectation of the ratification by the two Parlia ments of the Treaty in question, I beg to request the Council to withdraw Iraq's application under Article 11, paragraph 2 (item 18) from the Agenda of the Ninety-Eighth session of the Council of the League of Nations. I have the honour to be, etc. (Signed) Tawfik el Swaidy, Minister for Foreign Affairs.The setting up of a Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board has been brought a stage nearer by the conclusi of the Frontier Treaty signed between Persia and Iraq that the Board would consist of representatives of Great Britain, Persia and Iraq, but it is by no means certain now that Great Britain will be allowed to participate in representative on the Board. Our main interest in this complicated matter appears to be in regard to the lighting and buoying service in the Persian Gulf which it was agreed (P.Z. 1513/32 - Collection 30 - File 4) should be transferred to the proposed in the hands of a British representative . Prima facie it would seem that little can be done until the intentions of the Persian and Iraqi Governments are known; in the meantime we must preserve a free hand regarding the suggested transfer of the lighting and buoying service. A point to be remembered in the forthcoming discussions is that in the near future Persia may take over complete control of the lights and buoys in Persian territorial waters- at Tehran on the 4th July. Hitherto His Majesty 1 s Government appear to have proceeded on the assumption the proposed Convention or be able to secure adp (B 4738/73/34) onfidential. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 16th August, 1937. Dear Clauson, I enclose a copy of a memorandum which I have prepared Arab. The-object of the memorandum is simply to draw attention to the main points which are likely to cause difficulty when the proposed conservancy agreement comes to be discussed. 2. Now that the frontier treaty between Persia and Iraq, has been finally concluded and that its ratification is imminent, it seems desirable that these points should be examined in detail before long and our representatives at Bagdad and Tehran provided with appropriate instructions agalnfet the time when the negotiations are resumed. It would also be useful to take advantage of V/ard’s presence in this country for the discussion of the many technical difficulties involved in the conservancy question. setting forth the present position in regard to the Shatt-el M.J. Clauson, Esq 3. Wethat an interdepartmental meeting, should be held at the Foreign Office at the beginning of September to discuss the points outlined in the memorandum and ar^ further points which you or the other departments concerned may wish to raise. The Admiralty, Treasury, India Office, Board of Trade and Foreign Office would be represented a1 the meeting, which Ward Would also be ashed to attend. Once a clear view had been obtained of the various problems involved, a further meeting or perhaps even several meetings would be necessary in order to decide on the question of future policy. We hope that it may be possible to arrange for any such meetings to take place before the end of September, when Ward is due to leave for Iraq. 4. Would you let me know whether you concur in the procedure suggested above?

But on general grounds, it is in interests of everyone concerned, including Iran, that the Treaty should come into force as quickly as possible, and it would be undesirable on these grounds, and would probably in any case prove to have been an ineffective move, if any attempt were made to delay the exchange of ratifications in the hope of making some progress with the negotiations for the Convention meanwhile/the proposal put forward by H is Majesty’s Government for the adoption of the draft tripartite Convention establishing a Board with full executive powers, which had been worked out in great detail in London, was proving a stumbling-block to the conclusion of any agreement regarding the frontier, and it was suggested in the memorandum, inter alia , tnat some simpler form of Convention might if necessary be adopted, e*g. one which omitted the Karun and the Bahmanshir from the scope of the control of the Persian and Iraqi Governments 6. By the time that this memorandum could be considered by the Middle East (Official) Sub committee/ .v *237 &amp; Committee, the position had changed owing to the decision of the Iragi Government to reach a frontier agreement with the Persian Government (as they have now done) on the general oasis that Persia should receive an anchorage extending to the thalweg off Aoadan and that the question of conservancy an d iia ligation should be left for subsequent negotiation. Conclusion (b) of the 50th Meeting was, however, in the following terms: ,f That at the proper time an attempt ,f should be made to secure the 'establishment of a tripartite 'executive conservancy board, even 'if the Karun and Bahmanshir had to 'be excluded from its Jurisdiction, 'but that if this object cannot be 'attained, a system of national 'boards with a central advisory board 'on the lines of the Foreign Office 'memorandum might be accepted'. 6. Since the perso-Iraqi Frontier Treaty was signed Colonel Sir John Ward and Mr. Elkington, the General Manager of the A.I.O.C./A.I.O.C. at Abadan, who may fairly be regarded as qualified to speak with unrivalled authority on the practical problems of the Shatt-el-Arab, have both discussed this question at the Foreign Office, Mr, Slkington regards unified control of shipping as absolutely essential ana is convinced that any arrangement which left the control of vessels in the anchorage ceded to Persia at Abadan in different hands from that of the control of vessels outside the anchorage would be extremely dangerous, and might even lead on some occasion to a fatal accident, since the ships using Abadan are, for the most part, oil tankers and any accident to a tanker might cause an explosion big enough to destroy a large part of the town. It is therefore evident that proper navigational control is a matter of vital importance, and the company are, he states, anxious/anxious that His Majesty's Government should realise that it is their earnest hope that they will continue to urge the establishment of a tripartite Conservancy Board on the lines advocated in the past. ' • oir John &gt;Vard agrees and considers that co-ordination in the matter of 1 dredging, etc,, is also essential. It appears (in spite of what has sometimes heen said in the past) that even in the stretch of river opposite Abadan a certain amount of dredging is needed in order to keep the main channel open, and in addition to' this dredging has to take place if the berths alongside the jetties are to be kept at a proper depth. 8. It would no doubt be possible to secure the adoption of ad hoc measures for the unified control of conservancy and navigation in and around the Abadan anchorage/anchorage without going to the length of concluding an elaborate agreement on the lines of the draft Convention developed as the result of interdepartmental discussion in London during the last nine years. But a Convention of this kind is clearly the most satisfactory solution of the problem and to all intents and purposes it still seems necessary to regard such a Convention as the goal at which His Majesty's Government should aim, although there can now be no question of securing the inclusion under the control of the proposed Board of the Karun and the Bahmanshir, which the Persian Government will clearly never agree to place under any form of international control and which are not, it seems, absolutely essential to the successful conservancy of the main stream. 9. Moreover, apart from anything else, various indications suggest that the Persian Gove rnment/Government are resolved, to secure for themselves an effective voice in the control of the whole 3hatt-el-Arab and tnat anything short of participation in a Board with full executive authority would hardly oe regarded by them as a satisfactory admission of their rights. This again renders it unlikely that anything in the nature of a central advisory Board will be sufficient. Incidentally, it should be noted that as the result of Persian insistence the Frontier Treaty requires the future Convention to deal with certain matters, including anti-smuggling measures, which it has hitherto been thought better to exclude from the scope of the Conservancy Convention. 10. Sir John Ward states that he was asked by the Iraqi Prime Minister before his departure from bagdad on leave to start/btan, work upon the preparation of a draft Convention. it was impossible for him to do so owing to the fact that his departure was advanced owing to the difficulties in Which the Iraqi Government found themselves in July over the loan question, but he will nevertheless have to tackle the Q.uestion on his PPinr*n ^ t-. • nib ip barn. it is his present intention to take the British draft Conservancy Convention as his basis and he does not think the two parties will find it difficult to agree upon a Convention more or less on these lines. H* Sir John Ward also thinks that the two parties would never be able to get on together without the mediation of some third party upon the Board, and that His Majesty’s Government will not meet with any great difficulty (at any rate so far as the Iraqi Government are concerned) in participatingln the negotiation and conclusion of the Convention. it is to be feared however | that this opinion may prove undiy optimistic. Kis Majesty's Government, when agreeing to the general lines of the Treaty now concluded, made it clear to the Iraqi Government that they would still expect to participate in the Convention and to have a representative on the Board, hut even so it is not to be expected that British participation will be secured without a struggle. 12. Sir John Ward also raised the question of the position which he himself would occupy if a Conservancy Board were now set up. It had been understood in the past that he would be the first British representative, but the Iraqi Government might possibly wish him to be their first representative, in which case the representative of. His Majesty’s Government would obviously have/.252 214 have to he someone else. He hopes that it n.cty possiole to have his principal assistant at Basra appointed as the first chief executive officer of the new Board, in which case there would he little reason why Kis L.iajesty’s Consul at Basra should not be the British member of the Board. 13. With regard to the financial arrangements i.e. the transfer to the new Board of part of the debt owed to His Majesty's Government by the Port of Basra Administration* Sir John Ward is of the opinion that there would be no need to transfer any part of this debt to the new Board on the lines hitherto contemplated. It will, however, be necessary to obtain his views on this point with greater precision before his return. 14. Sir John Ward is anxious that, before his return to Bagdad at the end ol September, there should be one or more inter-departmental meetings/meetings, at which he could he present, i: order to discuss the whole question. it is clearly desirable that such a meeting or meetings should be held. The present memorandum lias accordingly been prepared, not with the object of discussing in detail the kind of Convention which is required, or of making any particular recommendation, but of recording the present position and setting out the points which His Majesty’s Government must now consider.

HAVE already reported by telegram the main developments which have occurred m connexion with the visit of the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to fully”' Thel ' e are ’ h ° WeVer ’ SOme points which 11 ma y be useful to describe more • V r telogram bi o. 69 of the 29th June was received before Dr. Naii’s arrival. The Iraqi Minister happened to be dining with me on the 30th June and 1 took the opportunity to explain to him the points which you had instructed me to put to the Minister. Dr. Naji arrived on the evening of the 1st July Engagements had been made for the greater part of the 2nd' July, but he was able to receive me at 5 o clock on that day. Mr. Butler accompanied me and we had a discussion of about an hour’s length with Dr. Naji and the Iraqi Minister. 3. It was clear at this interview that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs was already satisfied that he could obtain a sufficient measure of agreement on the points of the Shatt arrangement which were still outstanding, and that he was determined to reach some settlement. During the course of the discussions which had already taken place the Iranian representatives, as reported in my telegram No. 85 of the 2nd July, put forward certain modifications of their original proposals. Dr. Naji seemed to be impressed with the fact that their new draft no longer specified that a year should be the Ci maximum ” period for the conclusion of a conservancy agreement. He was also favourably impressed by the proposal that permission given by one party to the treaty for visits of warships of a third State should be considered as being given also by the other party. This second suggestion appeared to me to be a reasonable one. As regards the period for the negotiation of a conservancy convention, it was not apparent to me that any substantial difference was made by prescribing a period of a year for the negotiations as against prescribing a maximum period of a year. I endeavoured to impress on the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs the difficulties which would almost certainly arise unless it was provided that the status quo as regards the conservancy of the river should continue until the conclusion of a new conservancy agreement. I also suggested to him that, since the Iranian Government had already invited the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Tehran for the signature of the Four-Power Pact and had thus to some extent committed themselves to a successful conclusion of the negotiations, the Iraqi delegation were in a strong position for obtaining their reasonable requirements. At the close of our discussion, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs had decided to endeavour to induce the Iranian Government to accept the terms of the Iraqi draft letter, a copy of which was enclosed in Sir A. Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 245 of the 19th June, but which had not yet been put before the Iranian Government. He seemed hopeful that the Iraqi draft might still be accepted. It was, I fear, an error in tactics only to produce this draft after our interview. 4. During the next day negotiations between the Iranian and Iraqi delegates continued, and Dr. Naji called on me on the morning of the 4th July to inform me of the position which had then been reached. He said that the question of the conservancy arrangement had caused great difficulty and that the discussions had at times become somewhat heated. The Iranian Government were, of course, suspicious that the Iraqi Government, if they could secure a provision tnat e present conservancy arrangements should continue until a convention weie concluded, would simply spin out the negotiations in the hope that the presen arrangements would continue indefinitely. He had finally agreed to a P ]0 P° sa which emanated, I believe, from the Iranian Minister at Bagdad, to /he enect that the parties would conclude a conservancy agreement within one yeai, a ’ 1 they could not do so, the term might be prolonged by common agreemen , an a [89 d—3] i2 the present conservancy arrangements f “ eed P This agree- of one year and for any further P e , r o 10 „ f W fature dispute but the Minister was ment obviously contains the seeds of — p/mimittrd himpelfCopy (S 4501/398/65) Mo« 265 T25i7l3/3V) Sir, The signature of the four-power pact between the states of the Middle East (the Pact of Saad-Abad) has, in spite of the long time which has passed since its terms were agreed upon, aroused much interest and speculation among the diplomatic corps here. 2. I am uncomfortably aware that diplomats, after a certain time in this country, are apt to he infected to some degree with Persian habits of thought. When this frame of mind is reached, nothing is accepted at its face value and a hidden hand must, if possible, be detected in every transaction. 3. In the present case the explanation favoured by most of my colleagues seems to be that the conclusion of the pact was due to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, working through the Turkish Government. The argument appears to be that the pact will render more difficult any aggression or penetration by Italy in the middle East, that it must therefore be highly welcome to His Majesty’s Government, and that it was therefore concluded under the inspiration of London. It is certainly the case that members of the Italian Legation have been expressing suspicion of the effects of the pact, though the Minister himself has, so far as I know, been more cautious* I should not, in any case, expect that the various rumours and speculations to which the pact has given rise here, will have any great vitality* 4.

Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs has not yet shorn Iraqi draft note to Iranian Government hut the latter have produced some new rough drafts -which Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me hut did not give copies. Main points are as follows:- (1) Conservancy. New Iranian draft omits word 'maximum'* hut still provides that Convention shall he concluded in a year and that the Iraqi Government shall carry on conservancy work for a year. I pointed out that this new draft was still open to oh lection, that it did not provide for maintenance of status quo until entry into force of Convention and emphasised view expressed in your telegram. (2) Men-of-war. New Iranian draft provides that permission given hy one party for visits of men-of-war or non-commercial ships of a third State shall he considered also to he given hy the other party. Visiting ships shall have the right to make use of waters of both parties-for passage. Party giving permission shall at once inform the other party of permission given. This provision is general and no distinction is drawn between time of peace and war. Reference * &lt;.2 . Reference co Treaty of Alliance which appeared in Iranian draft note number two is omitted. (5) Abadan anchorage. Iranian draft provides for Commission to determine on the spot geographical co ordinates. Length of anchorage to be not less than four bnglish miles. Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is to see Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Shah tomorrow. He will endeavour to secure acceptance of Iraqi draft note. He sees some advantage in Iranian proposal number two above 3 which he believes to represent a suggestion of Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs 5 but if he finds it necessaiy to abandon his own draft on this point will endeavour to secure addition of reference to Treaty of Alliance. Matters are proceeding very fast as it is desired to conclude Perso-Iraq Treaty before arrival of Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs on July 6th. I also made point mentioned in last paragraph of your telegram Ho. 69. Minister for Foreign Affairs saici this point was already covered in his correspondence wibh xrenian Government but that he would continue to bear it in mind. He has no intention of discussing Conservancy Convention during present visit but said that he had suggested that new Convention should be based on present practice of port o± Basra authority.

Reference to Treaty of Alliance is desirable, but not essential. There is no need to press further the point mentioned in your final paragraph. On the other hand, proposal in point 1 for limitation of conservancy status quo to one year is open to serious objec tions from both Iraqi and British points of view.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs should not accept any draft which, like Persian draft No. 1, does not provide for the duration of the conservancy statu s quo until the new Convention is concluded.

Omission of words if et de ses acces u from Article 4A would strictly speakin mean that dues referred to therein could not be used for upkeep of that part of Rooka Channel which lies in the high seas. This is presumably not inten tion of . either government. Possibly Persian Government wimk word acces'’ might be held to cover such waters as Karun„ If so difficulty might be surmounted by using phrase 5 and o_. its approaches on the seaward side‘A 3. If Article 4D is omitted, it will be necessary to secure corresponding provision in convention to oe concluded in accordance with Article 5. But it is impoxtant thac Iraqi Government should make it clear at this stcxge that convention must in fact contain such a provision, eopecio..^j as Persian Government might otherwise be able to ^ay that Iraqi Government had signed frontier Agreement with a mental reservation. This could best be done by embodying a oriei passage to this effect in that part of note to Minister mentioned in pa.ragraph B of youi telegram which deals with continuance of work oi roit Directorate until convention enters into force. 4.

Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me he showed confidentially to Turkish Government draft of a treaty between Iraq and Iran relating to frontier between the two countries (text of which I understand from him had received prior approval of His Majesty 1 s Government) which he had handed to Iranian Minister Bagdad two days ago before his departure for Angora. He says Turkish Government were most favourably impressed with this document which they regarded as a sound and statesmanlike effort on the part of Iraqi Government to settle frontier diffi culties with Iran. Furthermore that Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs impressed Turkish views to foregoing effect on Iranian Ambassador at Angora and requested latter to send a pressing personal appeal from President of the Republic to the Shah urging His Majesty to effect an early settlement with Iraq and suggesting that draft in question offered an excellent bar's for so doing. Iranian Ambassador telegraphed accordingly to Tehran before departure to Angora of Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Pending conclusion of such convention the port of Basra authority shall continue to exercise its functions as at present without change in Irani, as in Irani waters. 5. Minister for Foreign Affairs does not like the text of article 4 B given in your telegram No. 56 and as now drafted article is intended to secure passage of British warships in form which he thinks is more lixely to be acceptable to the Persians, Reference to dues is omitted to meet objections made in paragraph 11 of your telegram under reference. Idea is that international usage can always be invoked to exempt warships from dues. 6 . Article 4 C. This seems to cover points of your paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. 7. Article 5.

He therefore set up Committee to draw up further draft which should follow Persian text as closely as possible and omit reference to rights of passage for Iraq/s allies. Text of Committee ! s draft, which I hear has been generally approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is given in my air mail despatch No. iu4 of 10th April 1957.

The United Kingdom was involved because of the close interests of British shipping in the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab.The papers cover: Perso-Iraqi frontier negotiations; drafts, signing (July 1937), and ratification (June 1938) of the Perso-Iraqi Frontier Treaty; Turkish approval of the frontier negotiations; the signing of the four power non-aggression pact between Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan (the Saad-Abad [Saadabad] Pact), 1937; Abadan anchorage; Foreign Office memoranda and minutes of meetings concerning a convention for the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab; the question of British participation in the convention; lighting and buoying; the involvement of Sir John Ward [serving with the Iraqi Government] in the discussions; the opposition of the Iranian Government to British involvement; the involvement of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC); the Port of Basra (including Foreign Office memorandum, folios 77-83); the Rooka Channel; and renewed discussion of the issue in 1945, including the importance of the Shatt-al-Arab for tanker traffic to supply Britain's war needs in the Far East.The main correspondents are the Foreign Office, the British Ambassador to Iraq, and HM Minister, Tehran.The French language content of the file consists of approximately twenty folios of diplomatic correspondence and treaties.There are no papers in the file dated 1941-44.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
