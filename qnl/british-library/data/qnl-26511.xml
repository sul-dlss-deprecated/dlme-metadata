Sir, Mr. Jordan to Mr. Eden.—{Received 23rd December.) Jedda, 28th November, 1943. WITH reference to Foreign Office minute of the 22nd September, 1938, concerning the Oil Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of California and the Saudi Arabian Government, published in Part 43 of Foreign Office publication “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs, July December 1938,' I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the complete agreements as supplied to me confidentially by the Saudi Arabian Government. 2. The first agreement signed on the 29th May, 1933, as published in your minute, contains numerous inaccuracies and omits one article. In order to avoid a lengthy listing of these inaccuracies I have thought it better to send you copies of the complete agreement and the letter exchanged between the Saudi Minister of Finance and the representative of the Standard Oil Company of California, which forms an integral part of the first agreement. 3. With reference to the supplementary agreement signed at Riyadh on the 31st May, 1939, a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of Mr. A. C. Troths despatch No. 123 of the 23rd July, 1939, and published on '■ page 51 of Part 45 of Foreign Office publication “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs, July-December 1939,' only one inaccuracy occurs, and that in paragraph 2 of Part 2 of the agreement, where after the word “ bounded ” in the first line the following should be inserted : “ on the east, north, west and south by the following lines {a)'' I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty's Minister of State at Cairo. THIS agreement made between his Excellency, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman A1 Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the “ Government ”) of the one part, and L. N. Hamilton, acting on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California (hereinafter referred to as the “ Company ') of the other part. It is hereby agreed between the Government and the Company in manner following :— The Government hereby grants to the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned, and with respect to the area defined below, the exclusive right, for a period of sixty years from the effective date hereof, to explore, prospect, drill for, extract, treat, manufacture, transport, deal with, carry away and export petroleum, asphalt, naphtha, natural greases, ozokerite and other hydrocarbons and the derivatives of all such products. It is understood, however, that such right does not include the exclusive right to sell crude or refined products within the area described below or within Saudi Arabia. The area covered by the exclusive right referred to in article 1 hereof is all of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters) westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north 30° west to the I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN. Enclosure. Article 1. Article 2. ‘ .[49—48] B'1 northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westeily edge of the Dahana such boundary shall continue in a stmight line south 30 east to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. ( „ For convenience this area may be referred to as the ‘ exclusive area. Article 3. In addition to the grant of the exclusive area described in article '1 of this agreement, the Government also hereby grants to the company a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. This preference right includes such rights as the Government may now have, or may hereafter acquire, in the so-called Neutral Zone bordering on the Persian Gulf to the south of Kuwait. The nature of this preference right is to be hereafter agreed upon. The term “ oil concession ” as used in this article means an exclusive concession covering the same products which are covered by the present agreement. Furthermore, the Company’s geologists shall have the right to examine the region covered by the preference right just referred to (excepting the Neutral Zone referred to above), in so far as such examination may be necessary or advisable for a better understanding of the geological character of the exclusive area. Article 4. Within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement the Company shall make an initial loan to the Government of £30,000 gold, or its equivalent. Article 5. The Company shall pay the Government annually the sum of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent. For convenience this payment is termed an annual rental, and it is payable in advance. The first annual rental shall be paid within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement; thereafter, so long as the contract is not terminated, the annual rental shall be due upon each anniversary of the effective date hereof and shall be payable within thirty days after such anniversary, provided that upon the commercial discovery of oil no further annual rental shall be due or payable. Article 6. If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Company shall make a second loan to the Government amounting to £20.000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such loan shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof, but the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the loan. Article 7. During the life of this agreement the Government shall be under no obliga tion to repay the initial loan of £30,000 gold (or its equivalent), or the second loan of £20,000 gold (or its equivalent). The Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these two loans by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. If the amount of the two loans, in whole or in part, shall not have been so recovered by the Company upon the termination of this contract, the Government shall repay the unrecovered amount in four equal and consecutive annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid within one year from the date of the termination of this agreement. Furthermore, until such unrecovered amount has been repaid by the Government, the Company’s preference right, referred to in article 3 hereof, shall continue in force. Article 8. Upon the effective date of this agreement the Company shall commence plans and preparations for geological work, so planning the work as to take advantage of the cooler season for more efficient work in the field, and of the hotter season for the necessary office work of compiling data and reports. In any event, the actual field work shall commence not later than the end of September 1933, and it shall be continued diligently until operations connected with drilling are commenced or until the contract is terminated. b3 Article 9. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions of the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connexion with this enterprise. Similarly, from time to time during the life of this contract, v the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. The portions so relinquished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities, which, however, shall interfere as little as practicable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may he put. Article 10. The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and in any event if the Company does not commence such operations within three years from the end of September 1933 (subject to the provisions of article 27 hereof), the Government may terminate this contract. Once commenced, these operations shall be continued diligently until oil in commercial quantities has been discovered, or until this agreement is terminated. If the Company should fail to declare so sooner, the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date upon which the Company has completed and tested a well or wells capable of producing, in accordance with first-class oilfield practice, at least 2,000 tons of oil per day for a period of thirty consecutive days. Operations connected with drilling include the ordering and shipping of materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia, the construction of roads, camps, buildings, structures, communication facilities, &amp;c., and the installation and operation of the machinery, equipment and facilities for drilling wells. Article 11. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, as provided in article 10 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later. In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both of these advances are on account of royalties which may be due the Government and consequently the Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 12. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent, is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and since it has been agreed also that this annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid prior to the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will cover a period beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to or greater than one-fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the £5,000 pounds gold, or its equivalent, corresponding to such period shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it shall be recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 13. As soon as practicable (i.e.. allowing a reasonable time for ordering and shipping further materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia and commencing further work) after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall continue operations connected with drilling by using at least two strings of tools. These operations shall be continued diligently until the proven area has been drilled up in accordance with first-class oilfield practice, or until the contract is terminated. [49—48] b 24 r Article 14. I he Company shall pay the Government a royalty on all net crude oil produced and saved and run from field storage, after first deducting— (1) Water and foreign substances; and (2) Oil required for the customary operations of the Company’s installations within Saudi Arabia; and (3) The oil required for manufacturing the amounts of gasoline and kerosene to be provided free each year to the Government in accordance with article 19 hereof. I he rate of royalty per ton of such net crude oil shall be either— (a) Foui- shillings gold, or its equivalent; or (b) At the election of the Company at the time of making each royalty payment, 1 dollar, United States currency, plus the amount, if any, by which the average rate of exchange of 4 shillings gold, during the last half of the semester for which the royalty payment is due, may exceed 1 dollar and 10 cents, United States currency. Thus, for example, if such average rate should be 1 dollar and 14 cents, l nited States currency (that is to say, 5 dollars and 70 cents per gold pound), the royalty rate would be 1 dollar and 4 cents, United States currency, per ton of such net crude oil. Article 15. If the Company should produce, save and sell any natural gas, it will pay to the Government a royalty equal to one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of such natural gas, it being understood, however, that the Company shall be under no obligation to produce, save, sell, or otherwise dispose of any natural gas. It is also understood that the Company is under no obligation to pay any royalty on such natural gas as it may use for the customary operations of its installations within Saudi Arabia. Article 16. The Government, through duly authorised representatives, may, during the usual hours of operations, inspect and examine the operations of the Company under this contract and may verify the amount of production. The Company shall measure in accordance with first-class oilfield practice the amount of oil produced and saved and run from field storage, and shall keep true and correct accounts thereof, and of any natural gas it may produce and save and sell and duly authorised representatives of the Government shall also have access at all reasonable times to such accounts. The Company shall, within three months after the end of each semester, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, deliver to the Government an abstract of such accounts for the semester, and a statement of the amount of royalties due the Government for the semester. These accounts and statements shall be treated as confidential by the Government, with the exception of such items therein as the Government may be required to publish for fiscal purposes. The royalties due the Government at the end of each semester, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, shall be paid within three months after the end of the semester. In case of any question as to the amount of royalties due for any semester, such portion of the amount as may be unquestioned shall be tendered the Government within the period hereinabove provided, and thereupon the question shall be settled by agreement between the parties, or, failin&lt;&gt;‘ that, by arbitration as provided in this contract. Any further sum which may be payable to the Government as a result of this settlement shall be paid within sixty days after the date of such settlement. Article 17. It is agreed that all gold payments provided in this contract, whether pounds gold or shillings gold, are to be based on the gold pound standard according to its weight and fineness at the time the payments may be due. It is also agreed that wherever it is stipulated in this contract that the equivalent of any sum or amount in pounds gold or in shillings gold may be paid, such equivalent may be dollars in United States currency, or pounds sterling. It is agreed, furthermore, that the equivalent of pounds gold or shillings gold, for any payment which may be made hereunder in dollars. United States5 currency, or in pounds sterling (with the exception of the first payment provided for m article 18 hereof), shall be based on the average of the rate of exchange as computed over a period of three months immediately preceding the due date of the payment. Article 18. ^ All payments provided in this contract to be made to the Government may be made by tendering such payments directly to the Government, or by depositing the amount due to the credit of the Government in some bank which the Govern ment designates in writing and which the Government may change from time ^ gi v i n g written notice to the Company long enough in advance so that the Company will have sufficient time to make future payments to the new bank. It is agreed that the Government will designate such bank in Saudi Arabia, or in the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, but that no bank m Saudi Arabia will be so designated unless such bank has a correspondent in United States of America, England or Holland through which bank transfers of money to Saudi Arabia may be made. Once the Company has made the proper payment to the Government, or has deposited the proper sum in any such bank, or has paid the sum to such correspondent for transfer to a bank in Saudi Arabia, the Company shall be free of all further responsibility in connexion with the payment. It is agreed, however, that the first payment of £35,000 gold, or its equivalent (comprising the initial loan and the first annual rental), shall be made, within fifteen days after the effective date of this agreement, to a correspondent, in New York or in London, of Netherlands Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) at Jedda, Saudi Arabia, to be trans mitted without delay; and at the expense of the Company, to said society and to be delivered to the Government upon obtaining a proper receipt from the Govern ment for such payment. If this first payment is not made in gold, it will be made in pounds sterling at the current rate of exchange at the time the Company makes the payment to such correspondent. Article 19. As soon as practicable after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall select some point within Saudi Arabia for the erection of a plant for manufacturing sufficient gasoline and kerosene to meet the ordinary requirements of the Government, providing, of course, that the character of the crude oil found will permit of the manufacture of such products on a commercial basis by the use of ordinary refining methods, and provided, further, that the amount of oil developed is sufficient for the purpose. It is understood that the ordinary requirements of the Government shall not include resale inside or outside of the country. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary arrangements, and as soon as the Company has obtained the Govern ment’s consent to the proposed location, the Company shall proceed with the erection of such plant. During each year following the date of completion of this plant the Company shall offer free to the Government in bulk, 200,000 American gallons of gasoline and 100,000 American gallons of kerosene’, it being- understood that the facilities provided by the Government for accepting these deliveries shall not impede or endanger the Company’s operations. Article 20. The Company, at its own expense, will employ the necessary number of guards and guides to protect its representatives, its camps and installations. The Government promises to co-operate fully in supplying the best soldiers and men available for this responsibility, and in furnishing every reasonable protec tion, at rates not exceeding those customarily paid by the Government or others for similar services, it being understood that the expense for such services shall he paid by the Company through the Government. Article 21. In return for the obligations assumed by the Company under this contract, and for the payments required from the Company hereunder, the Company and enterprise shall be exempt from all direct and indirect taxes, imposts, charges, fees and duties (including, of course, import and export duties), it being under stood that this privilege shall not extend to the sale of products within the6 country, nor shall it extend to the personal requirements of the individual employees of the Company. Any materials imported free of duty may not be sold within the country without first paying the corresponding import duty. Article 'I'l. It is understood, of course, that the Company has the right to use all means and facilities it may deem necessary or advisable in order to exercise the right! granted under this contract, so as to carry out the purposes of this enterprise, including, among other things the right to construct and use roads, camps, buildings, structures and all systems of communication; to install and operate machinery, equipment and facilities in connexion with the drilling of wells, or in connexion with the transportation, storage, treatment, manufacture, dealing with, or exportation of-petroleum or its derivatives, or in connexion with the camps, buildings and quarters of the personnel of the Company; to construct and use storage reservoirs, tanks and receptacles; to construct and operate wharves, piers, sea-loading lines and all other terminal and port facilities; and to use all forms of transportation of personnel or equipment, and of petroleum and its derivatives. It is understood, however, that the use of aeroplanes within the country shall be the subject of a separate agreement. The Company shall also have the right to develop, carry away and use water. It likewise shall have the right to carry away and use any water belonging to the Government, for the operations of the enterprise, but so as not to prejudice irrigation or to deprive any lands, houses, or watering places for cattle, of a reasonable supply of water from time to time. The Company may also take and use, but only to the extent necessary for the purposes of the enterprise, other national products belonging to the Govern ment, such as surface soil, timber, stone, lime, gypsum, stone and similar substances. Government officials and agents, in pursuance of official business, shall have the right to use such communication and transportation facilities as the Company may establish, provided that such use shall not obstruct or interfere with the Company’s operations hereunder and shall not impose upon the Company any substantial burden of expense. , In times of national emergency, the use of the Company’s transportation and communication facilities by the Government shall entitle the Company to fair compensation for any loss it may sustain thereby, whether through damages to the Company’s facilities, equipment or installations or through the obstruction or interference with the Company’s operations. Article 23. The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi Arab nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the Company can find suitable Saudi Arab employees it will not employ other nationals. In respect of the treatment of workers, the Company shall abide by the existing laws of the country applicable generally to workers of any other industrial enterprise. Article 24. The Government reserves the right to search for and obtain any substances or products, other than those exclusively granted by this contract, within the area covered by this agreement, except lands occupied by wells or other installa tions of the Company, provided always that the right thus reserved by the Government shall be exercised so as not to endanger the operations of the Company or interfere with its rights hereunder, and provided also that a fair compensation shall be paid the Company by the Government for all damage the Company may sustain through the exercise of the right so reserved by the Government. In any grant of such right so reserved by the Government, the concessionnaire shall be bound by the provisions of this Article. Article 25. The Company is hereby empowered by the Government to acquire from any occupant the surface rights of any land which the Company may find necessary to use in connexion with the enterprise, provided that the Company shall pay the occupant for depriving him of the use of the land. The payment shall be7 a fair one with respect to the customary use made of the land by the occupant. The Government will lend every reasonable assistance to the Company in case of any difficulties with respect to acquiring the rights of a surface occupant. The Company, of course, shall have no right to acquire or to occupy Holy Places. s Article 26. The Company shall supply the Government with copies of all topographical maps and geological reports (as finally made and approved by the Company) relating to the exploration and exploitation of the area covered by this contract. The Company shall also furnish the Government, within four months after the end of each year, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, a report of the operations under this contract during the year. These maps and reports shall be treated as confidential by the Government. Article 27. Xo failure or omission on the part of the Company to carry out or to perform any of the terms or conditions of this contract shall give the Govern ment any claim against the Company, or be deemed a breach of this contract, in so far as such failure or omission may arise from force majeure. If through force majeure the fulfilment of any term or condition of this contract should be delayed, the period of the delay, together with such period as may be required for the restoration of any damage done during sucih delay, shall be added to the terms or periods fixed in this contract. Article 28. The Company may terminate this contract at any time by giving the Govern ment thirty days’ advance notice in writing, whether by letter or by telegraph, provided that the telegraphic notice is promptly confirmed by letter. Upon the termination of this contract through such notice, or through any other cause, the Government and the Company shall thereafter be free of all further obliga tions under this contract, except as follows :— (1) The Company’s immovable property, such as roads, water or oil wells with their casings, permanent buildings and structures, &amp;e., shall become the property of the Government free of charge. (2) The Company shall afford the Government an opportunity to purchase the movable property of the enterprise in Saudi Arabia at a fair price equal to the replacement value of such property at the time less depreciation. Any controversy about this fair price shall be settled by arbitration in the same manner as provided in article 31 of this contract. If the Government declines or fails, within two months following the date of the termination of this contract, to purchase such movable property, or if the Government fails to tender the purchase price within thirty days after it has been decided upon, by agreement or by arbitration, the Company shall then have six months within which to remove such property. (3) If, in accordance with article 7 of this contract, there is any unrecovered amount still due the Company, the provisions of article 7 shall remain in force until the obligation therein mentioned has been satisfied. Article 29. In case of the breach by the Company of its obligation to make the second loan of £20,000 gold, or its equivalent/ as provided in article 6 hereof, or of its obligation to commence operations connected with drilling as set forth in article 10 hereof, or of its obligation to make the two advances each of £50,000 gold, or the equivalent, under the terms and conditions provided in article 11 hereof, or of its obligation under article 30 hereof to pay the amount of any damages which may be assessed upon the Company, the Government s remedy shall be the right to give the Company notice at once of such breach, and there upon, if the Company does not take immediate steps to comply with the obligation so breached, the Government may terminate this contract.Article 30. Except as otherwise provided in article 29 hereof, the penalty for the breach, by the Company of any of its obligations under this contract shall be damages which shall be payable to the Government under the following conditions : The Government shall at once notify the Company of any alleged breach on^ the part of the Company, setting forth the nature of such breach. Any contro versy which may arise as to whether or not the Company has committed the alleged breach shall be settled by arbitration in the manner provided in this agreement. Once that the fact of the commission of the breach has been estab lished, the failure of the Company to take immediate steps to remedy the breach shall subject the Company to the payment of damages to the Government, and, if such damages cannot be agreed upon, they shall be determined by arbitration in the manner provided in this contract. The amount of any damages which may be so determined shall be paid to the Government by the Company within sixty days after such determination. Article 31. If any doubt, difference or dispute shall arise between the Government and the Company concerning the interpretation or execution of this contract, or anything herein contained or in connexion herewith, or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder, it shall, failing any agreement to settle it in another way. be referred to two arbitrators, one of whom shall be chosen by each party, and a referee, who shall be chosen by the arbitrators before proceeding to arbitration. Each party shall nominate its arbitrator within thirty days of being- requested in writing by the other party to do so. In the event of the arbitrators failing to agree upon a referee, the Government and the Company shall, in agreement, appoint a referee, and, in the event of their failing to agree, they shall request the president of the Permanent Court of International Justice to appoint a referee. The decision of the arbitrators, or, in the case of a difference of opinion between them, the decision of the referee, shall be final. The place of arbitration shall be such as may be agreed upon by the parties, and in default of agreement shall be The Hague, Holland. Article 32. ; The Company may not, without the consent of the Government, assign its rights and obligations under this contract to anyone, but it is understood that the Company, upon notifying the Government, shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a corporation it may organise exclusively for the purposes of this enterprise. The Company shall also have the right to create such other corporations and organisations as it may consider necessary or advisable for the purposes of this enterprise. Any such corporation or organisa tion, upon being invested with any or all of the rights and obligations under this contract, and upon notification thereof to the Government, shall thereupon be subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. In the event that the shares of stock issued by any such corporation or organisation should be offered for sale to the general public, the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia shall be allowed a reasonable time to subscribe (upon similar terms and conditions offered to others) for at least 20 per cent, of such shares of stock so issued and offered for sale to the general public. Article 33. It is understood that the periods of time referred to in this agreement shall be reckoned on the basis of the solar calendar. Article 34. The effective date of this contract shall be the date of its publication in Saudi Arabia, following the ratification of this contract by the Company. Article 35. This contract has been drawn up in English and in Arabic. Inasmuch as most of the obligations hereunder are imposed upon the Company, and inasmuch as the interpretation of the English text, especially as regards technical obliga tions and requirements relating to the oil industry, has been fairly well established through long practice and experience in contracts such as the present9 one, it is agreed that, while both texts shall have equal validity, nevertheless in case of any divergence of interpretation as to the Company’s obligations here under, the English text shall prevail. Article 36. To avoid any doubt on the point, it is distinctly understood that the Company or anyone connected with it shall have no right to interfere with the administra tive, political or religious affairs within Saudi Arabia. Article 37. It is understood that this contract, after being signed in Saudi Arabia, shall be subject to ratification by the Company at its offices in San Francisco, California, before it shall become effective. After both texts of this contract have been signed in duplicate in Saudi Arabia, the signed copies shall be sent by registered mail in the next outgoing mail to the Company in San Francisco, California, and within fifteen days after receipt in San Francisco the Company shall transmit to the (Government by telegraph whether or not it ratifies this contract. If the contract is not ratified by the Company within fifteen days after receipt of the document in San Francisco, it shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. Likewise, if the amount of the initial loan and the first annual rental is not paid within the time agreed upon in article 18 hereof, the Government may declare this contract to be null and void and of no further force or effect. Upon ratification of this contract by the Company, one signed copy of each text, together with the necessary evidence as to ratification by the Company, shall be returned to the Government. Also, upon ratification of this contract by the Company, the contract shall be published in Saudi Arabia in the usual manner. Signed this 29th day of May, 1933 (corresponding to the 4th dav of Safar, 1352. A.H.). On behalf of Saudi Arab Government. (Signature and seal.) (Signed) L. N. HAMILTON, On behalf of Standard Oil Company of California. His Excellency, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman A1 Hamdan, Jedda, Saudi Arabia. Dear Sheikh Abdulla. ■Jedda, Saudi Arabia, ‘IQth May, 1933 {corresponding to the Mh of Safar, 1352, A.H.). Referring to the contract which has been signed to-day by you, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California, relative to an oil concession covering a portion of eastern Saudi Arabia, I am setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shall be considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated in the said contract, namely, the “ Government ' and the “ Company,” and the said contract shall be referred to as the “ Saudi Arab Concession.” 1. The Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession covering a certain area described in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area, exclusive of the so-called neutral zone, also referred to in the same article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer for such concession that may be made the Government by others in good faith, and that the Government may be ready and willing to accept. Within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered [49—4-8 ! . c10 and so presented to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 2. The Company’s preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called neutral zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall be a right to equal, with respect to the rights of the Government in the neutral zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of ^ Kuwait for a concession covering his rights in the neutral zone. In the absence™ of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh of Kuwait, the Government will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Sheikh of Kuwait whereby the company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone. In either of these two events, the company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone, or covering the terms of the proposed concession embracing the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone, as the case may be, within which to decide and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 3. Article 22 of the Saudi Arab Concession states that the use of aeroplanes shall be the subject of a separate agreement. One purpose of the present letter is to set forth the agreement as to this point. In view of the restrictions now prevailing in Saudi Arabia as to the use of aeroplanes within the country by anyone other than the Government, it is hereby agreed that so long as such restrictions remain in force, the Government will undertake to provide, at the request and at the expense of the Company, such aeroplane service as the Company may consider advisable for the purpose of its operations within the area covered by the Saudi Arab Concession.

On behalf of the Saudi Arab Government. On behalf of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company.\ \ / (Received under Bahrain D,0.Letter Bo.G/369, dated 15.3.43). VISIT TO AL KHOBAR. / y I left Bahrain in the GASOG launch at 1®45 p®ie. on 9 v ^h March and arrived at A1 Khobar four hours later. l was met at the pier by Mr. Ohliger (Resident Manager, GASOG), Shaikh Abdullah al Radhl (Ibn Saud’s Personal Representative with CASOG, who is also acting as Saudi Trade Agent in Bahrain) and Shaikh Mohammad bin Mathi, Amir of Al Khobar. Before motoring out with Mr. Ohliger to the CASOC Camp at Dhahran 8 miles away I spent half an hour taking coffee with the Amir of Al Kho bar in his house. The house is a ramshackle building, dirty and ill- kept. it is approached by a narrow and unsavoury passage at the en trance to which a small guard of honour, composed of police dressed In ~ c^uasi-military clothes, was drawn up in a ragged line. 2. On the morning of March 10th 1 motored with Mr.Ohliger to Ras Tanura, 60 miles away. We took the inland road which is, on the whole, in good condition. For much of the way the road runs beside the pipe line connecting the Compands oil field at Dhahran with the refinery at Has Tanura. Opposite Tarut Island the road crosses one of the landing grounds which the Oil Company prepared in the summer of 1942 for ..emergency use by R.A.P*. aircraft travelling between Basrah or Kuwait and Bahrain. 3. The refinery at Ras Tanura is a small one with a maximum through put of only 3000 to 3500 barrels per day. So small a unit is not economic and Mr. Ohliger told me, in response to my enquiries on this subject, that it had only been erected by the Company in order to com ply with the conditions of their Concession. The refinery is not at present being operated though a stock of kerosene (brought over bj/ oa*ge fi gej ^aiirain) is kept in one of the storage tanks for supply to the Saudi Government when required. near the refinery is a large r - v * ^ barasti huts - a labour camp which is at present un occupied. The Company 1 s installations at Ras Tanura are looked after by two American employees whose sole duty is to see that the plant and installations are kept in good repair. 4. ^ The M.B.S.C. propose to use Ras Tanura as a port of entry for foodstuffs supplied by them to the Saudi Government for consumption in Bast Saudi Arabia. 1 was anxious to see, therefore, what facilities existed at Ras Tanura for the handling of imports. The sea approach is good. There is an anchorage off the eastern point of Raa Tanura close to shore, suitable for freighters or tankers, and cargoes would have to be carried less than a mile by lighters to a sheltered jetty west Qj. the poirt of Ras Tanura. This jetty, which is equipped with a crane, belongs to the Oil Company, but they would, it is understood, have no objection to its use by the Saudi Government. it seems to me thai the main difficulty in using Ras Tanura now as a port of supply would be the lack of adequate storage. There is only one godownUn ex tension of a Turakish building now used as a customs house) approx- iEi-ately 90 ft. long by 60 ft. broad. This did not appear to be in good repair, unless the Saudi Government are able to arrange immediate transportation for imports as they arrive - inland by lorries or to coasta- towns by country craft - foodstuffs in excess of what can be accommodated in the single godown will have to be stacked in the open with the danger - indeed the certainty of rapid deterioration. * ^5 a ® Ta ? ura } motored to ^atif where I was entertained to tea oy Shaikh Mashan, Amir of &lt;^atif and brother of the Amir of Al Khobar. Bor some miles before entering ^atif the road from the north runs through thick date gardens watered mainly from natural springs. The comprises a collection of the most dilapidated stone'and °, ta 5, bu ; ldings that 1 have Qver seen. 'There were, however, signs ox ^actiTity in two directions. The road leading into ^atif from'the cith #ae being systematically widened even though this involved cut. ng down a number osf date palms; and there was a lot of movement V / ir’Ol. GEPl. ■ / f — 1 -? / and/7 i - 2 - and bustle at the port, where boats were being loaded with lucerne for Bahrain and ’aalug* (dates boiled when immature) and ’dibs 1 (date juice) for India. (Iwae told that the embargo on the export of dates from ^,atif did not apply to ’salug* and ♦dibs*). 6. The Amir of A1 Khobar was present when his brother, the Amir of Q.atif, entertained me to tea. In accordance with a suggestion lah ich 1 had previously made to Mr. Ohliger the conversation was directed by him to the subject of food supplies. The Amirs of A1 Khobar and ^atif, who are reported to have made large fortunes during the last six months by the part they have taken dhirxggxt^crx'tairtxiitxxniBiKtMg in manipulating food prices, displayed no embarrassment in discussing the subject. They stated that they had recently been instructed by Ibn Saud to make a cen sus of stocks of food and that there were, apart from Government stocks, 8000 bags of rice in ^.atif and 15000 bags in Hofuf. They also stated that they had received orders the previous day that the selling price of rice and dates was to be controlled. Maximum selling prices were to be as followst- Calcutta Rice Karachi rice Dates Es 39/- per bag Es 33/- per bag Es 3/- per basket If merchants claimed that their stocks of rice had cost more than the selling price now fixed the Saudi Government would, on production of tb merchants* invoices, take over their stocks at the cost price and wouldp^ place them on the market at the new controlled price® 7. In the course of conversation several references were made to the failure of this year’s crop of wheat sown with Canadian wheat seed. It will be recalled that 3000 bags of Canadian wheat ware lent to the Saudi Government by the Shaikh of Bahrain in October 1942 when, we were told, there was no grain in Eastern Saudi Arabia and the people were dying of starvation. Apparently the Canadian wheat intended for immed- iate consumption in Saudi Arabia was used as seed grain. The result has been unfortunate as the crop expected from it has been a completd failure. 8. From ^atif we returned to Dhahran via Dammam® Along the road south of ^atif very large areas of land are being developed. I saw enclosures, many acres in extent, which were said to belong to JMaj ib Saleh (Ibn Saud*8 Minister of Mines and Public Works), Shaikh Abdullah al Eadhl and Saleh Islam (Shaikh Abdullah al Radhl’s assistant). Hew wells have been bored and 4500 new date palms were, i was informed, to be planted this season. 9. In the evening I attended a dinner given for me at his house in Dammam by Shaikh Abdullah al Eadhl. The house is a very handsome one, well-kept and clean, with electric light installed. The food provided was, of course, on a lavish scale, and far exceeded in quantity and var iety anything that I have experienced in Bahrain. s On the morning of March 11th 1 was shown round the Oil Company’s &lt;1/ °nd was duly impressed by the enterprise shown in its nr^anisation. 'The well stbcked^o«imissa^_^ar^tbe home-made poultry incubators in \ air-conditioned house were of particular interest. li® Later in the morning I attended a midday dinner given for me by the Amir of Al Khobar. The number of guests was small - not more than a dozen - but the food provided included six sheep roasted whole and more than 250 side dishes (incluij^ng fried locusts). At this feast I was accompanied by Mr. Bertram ThoiS'as' andV’af^'ts^conclusion, we were both presented by the Amir with swords of honour. 12. I said good-bye to the Amir of Al Khobar at his house and to / bhaikh- 3 _ V 'A 1 ' ^ i Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl and Mr. Ohliger at the jetty which left at 3 pom. en route for Bahrain. 13. I was given a very friendly welcome by the Saudi authorities at Al Khobar, ^atif and Dammam, the majority of whomnl was meeting for the first time. My visit to the mainland also enabled me to discuss on the spot with Mr. Obliger a number of problems about personnel which had been troubling himo TTO.260-S. CQNFID 5MTIAL.

The procedure of ratification by both parties will be understood from the terms of articles 15 and 16 of the agreement: the ratification of the Saudi Arabian Government was published in the Mecca paper Umm-al-Qura on the 7th July, 1939; the agreement itself was not published in the local press until the 21st July, which, under article 15, becomes the “effective date” on which the agreement enters into force. It is evident that the San Francisco office of the company must have forwarded its ratification, though no formal notice to that effect has yet appeared. 2. The text of the agreement will no doubt be studied by the competent departments of His Majesty’s Government, and I propose to confine myself in this despatch to a few comments on some points, which, on a first reading, appear to me worthy of notice. 3. The references in this agreement to the previous one signed in 1933 accord perfectly with the text of the latter instrument, which was printed as an enclosure to Foreign Office Print (Confidential) No. 15474 of the 22nd September, 1938.(') There is, however, no mention of any document dated the 27th May, 1933; the new agreement refers to the original 1933 agreement as “ the Saudi Arab Concession,” and says that it was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the same day as that on which Mr. L. N. Hamilton addressed to the Saudi Minister of Finance his letter con taining four paragraphs and now called the “ Second Principal Agreement.” 4. The areas to which the new agreement, or rather the three agreements taken together, applies are set forth in the terminal schedule. Not only is the previous concessionary area in Eastern Arabia included, but a northern area, a southern area, and the two neutral zones are now allotted to the company for exploitation. I learn from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that His Majesty turned over in his mind for a long time the question of the boundaries of the northern and southern areas : he is unwilling to have any oil prospecting in the centre of the country, and he knows that there is considerable doubt as to where its frontiers really are. The new areas cannot be traced on a map unless the position of such points as “ the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana,” the “ southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana,” “ the north-east corner of the boundary line between Yemen and Saudi Arabia,” and of the northern edge of the Great Nefud are first determined. I have not yet been able to fix these places with any accuracy on any map. 5. No mention is made in the new agreement of the “ contact line between the sedimentary and the igneous formations ” which probably does not coincide with the eastern edge of the Red Sea Concession. But it is clear from article 12 that whatever preference rights the company possessed under the previous agree ments over areas not yet assigned to them still persist. 6. The company has the right, under section (c) of article 6, to promote a company or companies of a nationality acceptable to the Government to exploit the oil in either of the neutral zones; it also possesses various rights of transport in and access to those zones. 7. Article 9 gives the company certain rights over the area assigned in 1936 to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in the Red Sea area. P) See “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs,” Part XLIII, No. 9. [680 k—2] b2 8. The consideration paid and to be paid for these extensions of the company’s area of operations appears very liberal. £140,000 gold is payable at once; thereafter an annual rental of £20,000 is to be paid; and whenever oil in commercial quantities is discovered in the additional areas a further sum oi £100,000 gold will be paid. From July 1940 onwards, until oil is discovered in the new areas, 1,300,000 gallons of gasoline and 100,000 gallons of kerosene will be presented to the Saudi Arabian Government, and after such a discovery is made the amount of gasoline will be increased by 1 million gallons. I have not heard what actual sum in cash has passed; it is clear from the last words of article 4 that the rental due under the 1933 agreements had been overpaid, and I should not be surprised to learn that advances have been made on account of the increased sums which will be payable in future. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and the enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, and to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. ’ I have, &amp;c. A. C. TROTT. Enclosure. THIS agreement is made between his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Sulaiman- al-Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the k ‘ Government ”) of the one part, and William J. Lenahan, acting on behalf of California Arabian Standard Oil Company (hereinafter referred to as the “ Company ”) of the other part. It is hereby agreed between the Government and the Company in manner following :— Article 1. This agreement, known as the Supplemental Agreement, is supplemental firstly to the agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “ Saudi Arab Conces sion ”) made between the Government of the one part and the Standard Oil r Company of California of the other part and signed on the 29th day of May, 1933 (corresponding to the 4th day of Safar, 1352, a.h.), and secondly to the Letter of Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the £ ‘ Second Principal Agreement ”) addressed by L. N. Hamilton, on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California, to and accepted by his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Sulaiman-al- Hamdan, on behalf of the Government, and bearing the same date as the Saudi Arab Concession. Article 2. The Saudi Arab Concession and the Second Principal Agreement have been duly transferred to and vested in the “ Company ” (party hereto) after notifica tion to and with the consent of the Government, all in accordance with article 32 of the Saudi Arab Concession, and the Company has duly undertaken and fulfilled to date the duties and obligations of the ‘ £ Company ’ ’ thereunder. Article 3. On the 16th day of October, 1938 (corresponding to the 22nd day of Shaaban, 1357, a.h.), the Company declared, under article 10 of the Saudi Arab Concession, that oil had been discovered in commercial quantities, and that all the obligations of the Company attendant upon such declaration have been duly fulfilled to date. Article 4.

(2) The relinquishment by the Company of the whole of the additional area. If either of the events mentioned in (1) and (2) above shall occur during the period intervening between any two anniversaries of the effective date of the agreement, the rental payable for the year in which such event occurs shall be only that proportion of the annual rental above mentioned as the number of days that have intervened between the preceding anniversary date and the date of the occurrence of the event mentioned above bears to a full year of 365 days. (c) The sum of £100.000 English, gold, or its equivalent, upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities within the additional areas aforesaid. Each of the foregoing payments shall be made within thirty days from the date upon which it becomes due and shall be made in accordance with and in the manner provided in articles 17 and 18 of the baudi Arab Concession. The foregoing payments are to be made by the Company in addition to any other payments by way of royalty or advance or otherwise already provided for by the Saudi Arab Concession and yet unpaid, and without prejudice to the right of the Company to recover advances already made under articles 4, 6 and 11 and yet to be made under article 11 of the Saudi Arab Concession, and to recover overpaid rental under article 12 of the Saudi Arab Concession.

Dear Sir Trenchard 3674 I arrived back at Bahrain late on Friday night after a visit to Haas lasting 4&gt; dry®* As I went across as the guest of tha California Arabian Standard Cil Comoany in order to be shown something of the work that the Oil Company is doing ©cross there, 1 think it will be aprrepriatc for my report to be in deml~official rather than official form* I covered nearly 1000 miles in four days 1 travelling, and naturally my observations hsd to be of a very general nature. 2. I arrived at Dharan on the evening of the 15th l*ay, having had slight trouble with the Police and Customs at A1 Khobar since they had succeeded in misplacing the letter of authority for me to lend and to receive customs facilities* It is some 14 months since I last saw &gt;haran and the development and expan sion there during this time have been enomous* They now hove six wells producing, or on the point of producing, from the deep horison, and they hove just started work on well No* 17 (in numbering their wells they include the old shallow horizon wells which were almost totally unproductive). The ^merieen personnel numbers close on 300 and the construction of air-condi tioned houses, mesa hall, commissary, etc*, proceeds apace* It was a little difficult to ascertain figures of actual and potential production at -heran but I gather th^t a minimum dally production of 10,000 barrels is already assured, and that potential production is not likely to be short of 30,000 barrels. There are five 'strings of toola* working at present at nharan, plus/** treble Lieutenant Colonel Lr Tranehard Fowla, K.C.I.S., C.B.S.. Political esiient in the Persian Gulf, 3uahjr* .3 2 - plua one at AW Fadrl^a (sae balow) 9 and I understand that when drilling begins in other areas rigs ana draw-works will be i&amp;oved out from Dharan f work at that place easing off* 3* Cn Tuesday morning we set out from Oharan via Oatif and oafwa to ^as Xanura. The road follows the pipeline meet of the way though the latter cuts acinose shallow water in T&lt;mur&amp; Bay* At Has lanura X saw the storage tanka and tha loading terminal, which is only 3000 feet from the shore* In fact Has Tsnsira is an admirable oil port, though the Company hope that it will not be developed for general audi purposes* There is ample space on the headland for a large refinery, should it become necessary to build one, though there Is little 1 doubt that the Company will do their best to avoid this* I should imagine that their hope that Has Tenura will not develop as a general port is likely to be fulfilled, since the country between leas Tenure and Riyadh is extremely difficult for road construction* I rasumably however cargoes for atif and Oqair (for the Hofuf area) will be brought into Has Tanura and there loaded into bargee and dhows* But uhe Riyadh area will probably depend on Kuwait* 4* i&gt;'rom .as Tanura we proceeded along the east side of the Sabakhat as Jumm to Jubsil. As we arrived there at mid-day most of the baiaar was shut, but it is a place of quite minor importance, providing mainly for the Bedu when they come into the °as sudah' to the west* From Jubail we continued more or less parallel to the Coast in a north-westerly direction to Abu Hadrl&gt;a, which lies at the intei'section of linee drawn due south from Jebel jtanifa end due west from Jlnna Island* Abu Kadriya is the area which was proved last year by the seismograph ( method and which the Company hope will develop into a huge oil field comparable with Uxe A*I*C*C* fields* The first well Is at present being drilled and casing has been set to a depth of 4800 /.4800 ©dd ftet, Th© Company apt prtpartd to drill to 10 f 000 --j ftet in this area, and hope to find oil at any depth between 6000 and 10|000 feet* Materials for work hart are landed from bargaa in Manifa Bay where the Company have a crane in charge of a local watchman and crew* There la an excellent water supply at £bu Kadriya and a very business-like air-cooled camp on a miniature scale, which of course will expand rapidly if oil ia found in the test well* 6* We then went on to Jebel Kanifa, from which we obtained a view of the surrounding country and could see T^anifa Bay Itself, There is deep water right up to the shore, but the difficulty here is that there ere shoals further out to sea through which no deep water channel has yet bean discovered* As It was now late in the afternoon we could only spend a short time at Jebel Kanifa before driving on to Wo* 1 Seismograph Camp, which is at a point rouphly 22 miles due weet of Jebel Abu r as»in. (Incidentally I am quoting names which are shown on Hunters Map of Arabia* I have a map of Hasa which was given to me by Thornburg, but it does not contain the details obtained during the present season’s work, I hope in due course to get a revised map which may be ready in August*) ^e arrived at this Camp after dark, having covered some 240 miles during the day. There is a party of IS men here engaged on seismograph work, and the Canro itself and the commissariat are alike admirable* 6, On the following morning, vedneaday, we started off by driving down to the Coast to obtain a view of the coast line between **ae al Kiahs’ab and las al Safaniyah* This Is a parti cularly* pleasant bey, but of no great Interest* then re turned and watched the seiamocraph party for some time (X will not worry you with an account of their technique), and afterwards -proceeded north to the Ain al Abd v/hich, e.s far as I can make out f is about 16 cr 17 miles from the Coast, and 3 or 4 miles south of the Kuwait Keutral 'one boundary# This is a particular ly unpleasant sulphurous salt sprlng f of no value to any one# l e then travelled due west parallel with the Kuwait Keutral Zone boundary (so far as we could judge where the boundary is), \ crossing the Kuwait-Riyadh road and driving along over the gravel plain in the general direction of Hafar al Be tin# As we had a long journey to make to the next camp we went only about 20 miles west of the Kuwait road (reluctantly deciding that there was insufficient time to drive in to Kuwait to see you) and we then turned south-east and joined the Kuwait- Riyadh road# All this area of so-called gravel plain is covered with grass this year and I gather that most of the Bedu tribes who would ordinarily be down in the 'as audah' by this time are still up in the Jibdibah area# They are beginning to come in now but we saw very few of them, and for this reason, as well as the great distances we were covering daily, I had no oppor tunity of making enquiries about the tribes and their migrations# By this time we were out of the area which has been covered by No# 1 Seismograph Party, whose work has been roughly in a rect angle south of the Neutral Zone boundary with its south-westerly point not fur from Tahrah. Crossing the uadl-as-Chaqq ws cut off from the Kuwait road before reaching the new Jaudi fort at ;ai*y«-al-Alya (about 23 miles west-aortb-weat of v/abralt), since we had no time to waste on explaining ourselves to the Saudi troops there* I am not quite sure hov.» strong this post Is, but the American geologist who was our guide said he thought there would be 100 men. * e proceeded in a south-south-westerly direction to ceismogfaph Camp No# 2 which is about 14 miles north-west of Sarrar. This involved a difficult cross-country journey after dark from the Company* s more northerly net-work of tracks to the southerly net-work in the Sarrar area# This camp/-camp la on vary much the seme lines aa the other, and la due to move southwards in a few days 1 time* We had covered roughly 260 miles of 'road* and had to go beefr 45 miles f fter dinner in order to repair and bring in our second car \ 7* The next day f Thursday, we struck west~south-west over gradually rising country to an area called Ma'aqela* This is on the edge of the Dehana (sand-dune country) about 50 miles west-south-west of Awainah* Awainah is the last point st which (so far) there is permanent water until the Rutfsh wells on the west side of the lahana are reached* At Ma* aqala we found a geologists' camp of a somewhat more primitive nature* A driller has arrived there recently and Is now drilling for water, a necessary preliminary to drilling for oil next autumn in an area which has caused the geologists some excitement* This Ha'aqala area la rather too hard for seismograph work but surface geology is considerably simpler than in the sand-covered areas and has been checked by the gravitymetsr method* tta'aqala is only 140 odd miles short of Riyadh and it will be an expen sive business to construct and maintain roads to take heavy loads of machinery, etc., from Oharen or Jhball* There is another geological party working about 90 miles north-north-west of lita'aqala in the As Safah direction, but we did not have time to visit them* Me'aqela is several hundred feet above sea level and very hot and dry? the temperature in the afternoon we were there was 115 in the shade, and is likely to go a good deal higher* 8# On the next morning, Friday, we set out on our return journey to Dharan* As far as Awelnah we were retracing our steps of the previous day, but from there on we followed a different track past Hinnet (Henna) straight to Jubail, and thence southwards on the west side of the Sabakhat as Summ to Uharan* This distance was close on 250 miles and we used 25 gallons Agallons of uater In the radiators of our two cars. Shortly before sighting atif we sew the abandoned derrick of a dry well drilled at a place called /I Alat (in the area named 3abekhat ’alaliyat in Hunter*a Map). 9* Briefly the position in regard to Haaa oil is that the Company have a prolific high-pressure field at lharan which they are developing rapidly. Thia field may ba good for 30 to 50 thousand barrels daily but will probably not be produced at anything like this figure owin; to the difficulty of breaking further into the markets of the Eastern Hemisphere. They are drilling a test well in an extremely promising area at Abu Hadriya, which may conceivably be a structure of far greater capacity than Dharan. They are about to begin drilling next cold weather (assuming that they surmount the water diffi culty) in the Il« 9 aqala area, which according to surface indica tions io extremely promising. Of their two seiamograph parties No. 1 is covering a large area to the south of the Kuwait Neutral Zone which is promising enough but in which, as far as I can dis cover, no specific 'highs* or domes have so far been located; the second seismograph party in the &gt;arrar area 30 ims to have located a number of 'highe*, Judging by a detailed geological map of which 1 caught a glimpse. Another geological party in « the As-3afah area does not seem to have much to report yet. Meanwhile two gravitymeter parties are starting work now to the south and south-west of Dharan, though it may be months before they can send in a useful report. 10. I tried to find out something about the California Arabian Standard Oil Company* s future policy, since it ia a matter which has caused me much anxiety in recent months owing to its possible effect on Eahr&amp;ln production. I suggested to Thornburg that the feverish activities at Dharan, the rather noisy boasting bv ^nahan anu others about Abu Hadrlya, the intensive exploration by seismograph, gravitymeter and plain surface geology, the ceremonial/*ctreflionial opening of lae tanura as an oil port and ao on could only have the effect of whetting the appetite of Ibn market for this oil must be in the Hastens Hemisphere and that market was already apportioned among the various ( ompaniea. Arabian oil could break in only to a limited extent and it seemed to me that they were delioeretely committing themselves to a vast programme of uneconomic production since the prospect of inducing Ibn &gt;aud, after all he hae seen on his recent tour f to &amp;gree to restricted production must be remote in the extreme* Would it not have been better to develop the Oharan field slowly and to have gone about further exploration leisurely — and silently ? I gathered that these views (more or less) are •jk. v*«*vta.w actually held by the Texas people and by sons of the California people also* But there is a strong California ^roup, headed by the President himself f which maintains that there must be repld development for four reasons t* (a) that the concession calls for it) (b) that the Company are required within a now brief period to select the areas which they wish to retain; (c) that unless they exhibit greet activity Ibn laud may tsar up the concession — and they would have no prospect of redress; (d) ^ put very amateurXy7 each Company 1 s share in the oil market depends on its potential and not on its actual production* If C*A«S*0*C* can prove by actual teat that they have a potential production of say 100000 barrels per day they can then claim possibly an additional 25,000 barrel ahrre in the Eastern Hemi sphere markets* ( H*B * Bahrain obtained a totally dispropor 3aud and his Ministers for ever-increasily royalties. The tionate share merely by being Included in the total California Texas share*) All/*—r i iiifii—i • 8 - All thes« arguments can be met ana the fljght between the opposing views goes on f but meanwhile the w big producers' have their way and soon it will be too late to change* 1 might odd here that Hie Majesty’s Government 1 » decision to allow the 'haikh of Bahrein to grant the Unallotted Area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company arrived only just in time to enable the Company to repel a strong attack on Bahrain pro duction by C#A« :: j* 0*C# Tbn Baud having seen one tanker loaded at Has Tanura said he would like to wait and see some moref and this could only have been done at the evoense of Bahrain. As things have turned out, I am optimistic that Bahrain is fairly a»fe for 80,000 barrels e day, which is actually mors than the minimum called for in the recent negotiations* How Arabian production (in excess of about 85,000 barrels s day) is to be absorbed I do not know. 11* The Company*a geologists and surveyors have traversed an immense field covering the whole of Hess, and some of them have bean as far south as the Bub^hl Fhali and others up to Buraida and Hail, as yon know, one of their parties has also been surveying the Saudi-Iraq frontier. There are at least a thousand kilometres of graded track in existence (some of it very much the worse for wear *&gt;fter the Fin** e 350 motor vehicles havs passed over it). Numerous water wells have bsen drilled in various parts of the country, some of them producing excellent water which an Anarlean or an European can drink without serious damage to his interior* 12. The country is a^asingly green. r&gt;heran itself marks more or less the northern extremity of the Jafurah (sandy desert with dunes). Northwards is the coastal belt of 'as-sudah*, a plain with a fairly thin cap of sand, interspersed with snbakhas or soft salty depressions with a thin, comprratlvely hard crust over marsh, in the north this merges gradually into a gravel plain as ona goes westwards, while further south the country rises/--9- i- rises gradually to a rocky plateau containing 'rodhas * or fertile depressions in whieh fine grass and shrubs flourish after rainj while west again of both the gravel plains and the rocky plate&amp;u is the ’Mahans** or sand-duna country, on the f&amp;r side of which lies itiyadh. The Company have found that it is not excessively difficult to make tracks across the ?, as-sudah' or ssndy plain by means of a grader, though such tracks are quickly cut up if n; rrow motor-car tyres are used, similarly they find that across most of the s&amp;bakhas they can make good tracks by first driving light cars fitted with desert tyres over them, gradually increasing the weight of the motor vehicles used, and finally using a grader. They are using now four-wheal-drive cars and station waggons and six-wheel-drive lorries (Autocars), all with wide low pressure tyres; and there can be no doubt that if ever military opera* tiers were undertaken in this area multiple wheel-drive vehicles with broad low-pressure tyres would be essential. 13* As ! have mentioned above I hope to obtain a revised map in © few months* time and if I do I will send it along for reproduction. 14. 1 did not go south to Hofuf, though 1 hope to do so on s future visit. The King^ personal invitation to me to visit Riyadh next winter has been repeated and it might be possible to take advantage of this to make a more leisurely tour of Hass. Yours sincerely, 3d/- H.

ON the 27th May, 1933, an agreement was signed between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Standard Oil Company of California granting the company a concession for a defined area in Eastern Saudi Arabia corresponding roughly with the district of Hasa. An abridged text of this agreement was published at the time in the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura. What was believed to be a full text, consisting of thirty-four articles, was obtained in 1935 by the political agent at Koweit (E 3823/173/25 (1935) ).(*) 2. The Saudi Arabian decree announcing the grant of the concession contained, however, a reference to a “ special agreement,’ which was not published. It was believed at the time that the “ special agreement ” gave the California Arabian Standard Oil Company an option on territory in Eastern Saudi Arabia not already included in the Hasa concession, but details were lacking. 3. In April 1938 the Saudi Arabian Legation in London communicated unofficially to the Foreign Office the text of three articles of an agreement relating to the Standard Oil Company’s concession, together with a copy of a letter dated the 29th May, 1933, from the company’s representative to the Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance. This letter refers inter alia to ‘ ‘ the contract signed to-day.” The three articles and the letter deal with the particular question of the company’s option rights outside the original concession area. 4. The three articles were numbered 3, 7 and 35. The Saudi Arabian Legation had no knowledge of the remainder of the agreement from which the articles are supposed to be taken, and it is, in any case, unlikely that there would be two complete, but entirely separate, agreements signed at about the same time and relating to the same subject. 5. The most probable explanation is that on the 29th May, 1933, a modified version of the original agreement of the 27th May was signed, and that this modified version consisted of the original agreement with the three extra articles and the interpretative letter. This is borne out by the fact that if the three additional articles are inserted in their proper places in the original agreement, the whole agreement reads consecutively. 6. The agreement has accordingly been reproduced below with the three articles inserted. The numbering of the other articles has been altered accordingly, i.e., article 3 in the original becomes article 4, article 5 becomes article 6, aVticle 6 becomes article 8, and so on as far as article 32, which becomes article 34, after which the new article 35 supersedes the original article 33. Finally, article 34 becomes article 36. References to other articles have been altered to correspond with the new numbering. The letter has been placed at the end of the agreement. 7. The whole document is confidential, as no part of it has been communi cated officially to His Majesty’s Government by the Saudi Arabian Government. Foreign Office, September 22, 1938. (i) “Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs,” Part XXXVI, Enclosure in No. 68. 10067 [17968] B 16 (nvy/if)2 Text of the Oil Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of California and His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-aTSaud. THIS agreement made between his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the “ Government ”), of the one part and L. N. Hamilton, acting on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California (hereinafter referred to as the “ Company ”), of the other part. It is hereby agreed between the Government and the Company in manner following :— Article 1. The Government hereby grants to the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned, and with respect to the area defined below, the exclusive right, for a period of sixty years from the effective date hereof, to explore, prospect, drill for, extract, treat, manufacture, transport, deal with, carry away and export petroleum, asphalt, naphtha, natural greases, ozocerite, and other hydrocarbons, and the derivatives of all such products. It is understood, how ever, that such right does not include the exclusive right to sell crude or refined products within the area described below or within Saudi Arabia. Article 2. The area covered by the exclusive right referred to in article 1 hereof is all of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. For convenience this area may be referred to as the “ exclusive area.” Article 3. In addition to the grant of the exclusive area referred to in article 2 of this agreement, the Government also hereby grants to the Company a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. This preference right includes such rights as the Government may now have, or may hereafter acquire, in the so-called Neutral Zone bordering on the Persian Gulf to the south of Koweit. The nature of this preference right is to be hereafter agreed upon. The term c ‘ oil concession ” as used in this article means an exclusive concession covering the same products which are covered by the present agreement. Furthermore, the Company’s geologists shall have the right to examine the region covered by the preference right just referred to (excepting the Neutral Zone referred to above), in so far as such examination may be necessary or advisable for a better understanding of the geological character of the exclusive area. Article 4. Within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement, the Company shall make a payment to the Government of £30,000 gold, or its equivalent. Article 5. The Company shall pay the Government annually the sum of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent. For convenience this payment is termed an “ annual rental ” and it is payable in advance. The first annual rental shall be paid within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement; thereafter so long as the contract is not terminated, the annual rental shall be due upon each anniversary of the effective3 date hereof, and shall be payable within thirty days after such anniversary, provided that upon the commercial discovery of oil no further annual rental shall be due or payable. Article 6. If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Company shall make a second payment to the Govern ment, amounting to £20,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such payment shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof, but the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the payment. Article 7. During the life of this agreement, the Government shall be under no obligation to repay the initial loan of £30,000 gold (or its equivalent), or the second loan of £20.000 gold (or its equivalent). The Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these two loans by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. If the amount of the two loans, in whole or in part, shall not have been so recovered by the Company upon the termination of this contract, the Government shall repay the unrecovered amount in four equal and consecutive annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid within one year from the date of the termination of this agreement. Furthermore, until such unrecovered amount has been repaid by the Government, the Company’s preference right referred to in article 3 hereof shall continue in force. Article 8. Upon the effective date of this agreement the Company shall commence plans and preparations for geological work, so planning the work as to hake advantage of the cooler season for more efficient work in the field, and of the hotter season for the necessary office work of compiling data and reports. In the event the actual field work shall commence not later than the end of September 1933, and it shall be continued diligently until operations connected with drilling are commenced, or until the contract is terminated. Article 9. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions of the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. Similarly, from time to time, during the life of this contract, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. The portions so relinquished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities, which, however, shall interfere as little as practicable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may be put. Article 10. The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and in any event if the Company does not commence such operations within three years from the end of September 1933 (subject to the provisions of article 27 hereof), the Government may terminate this contract. Once commenced, these operations shall be continued diligently until oil in commercial quantities has been discovered or until this agreement is terminated. If the Company should fail to declare so sooner, the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date upon which the Company has completed and tested a well or wells capable of producing in accordance with first-class oil practice at least 2,000 tons of oil per day for a period of thirty consecutive days. Operations connected with drilling include the ordering and shipping of materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia, the construction of roads, camps, buildings, structures, communication facilities, &amp;c., and the installation and operation of the machinery, equipment and facilities for drilling wells. [17968] * b 24 % Article 11. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent. I he due date^jjj the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, as provided in article 10 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later. In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both of these advances are in account of royalties, which may be due to the Government, and, consequently, the Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 12. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent, is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and since it has been agreed also that the annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid prior to the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will cover a period beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to or greater than one- fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the £5,000 gold, or its equivalent corresponding to such period, shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it should be recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 13. As soon as practicable (i.e., allowing a reasonable time for ordering and shipping further materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia and commencing further work), after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall continue operations connected with drilling by using at least two strings of tools. These operations shall continue diligently until the proven area has been drilled up in accordance with first-class oil-field practice, or until the contract is terminated. Article 14. The Company shall pay the Government a royalty on all net crude oil produced and saved and run from field storage, after first deducting— (1) Water and foreign substance; and (2) Oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installation within Saudi Arabia; and (3) The oil required for the manufacturing the amounts of gasoline and kerosene to be provided free each year to the Government in accordance with article 19 hereof. The rate of royalty per ton of such net crude oil shall be 45. gold, or its equivalent. Article 15. If the Company should produce, save and sell any natural gas, it will pay to the Government a royalty equal to one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of such natural gas, it being understood, however, that the Company shall be under no obligation to produce, save, sell, or otherwise dispose of any natural gas. It is also understood that the Company is under no obligation to pay any royalty on such natural gas as it may use for the customary operation of its installation within Saudi Arabia. Article 16. The Government, through duly authorised representatives, may, during the usual hours of operations, inspect and examine the operations of the Company under this contract and may verify the amount of production. The Company shall measure, in accordance with first-class oil-field practice, the amount of oil produced and saved and run from field storage, and shall keep true and correct5 accounts thereof, and of the natural gas it may produce and save and sell, and duly authorised representatives of the Government shall also have access at all reasonable times to such accounts. The Company shall within three months, after -w^he end of each semester, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, deliver to the Government an abstract of such accounts for the semester, and a statement of the amount of royalties due the Government for the semester. 1 hese accounts and statements should be treated as confidential by the Govern ment, with the exception of such items therein as the Government may require to publish for fiscal purposes. I he royalties due the Government at the end of each semester commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, shall be paid within three months after the end of the semester, such portion of the amount as may be unquestioned shall be tendered the Government within the period hereinabove, and thereupon the question shall be settled by agreement between the parties or failing that by arbitration as provided in this contract. Any further sum which may be payable to the Government as a result of this settlement shall be paid within sixty days after the date of such settlement. Article 17. It is agreed that all gold payments provided in this contract, whether pounds gold or shillings gold, are to be based on the gold pound standard according to its weight and fineness at the time the payment may be due. It is also agreed that wherever it is stipulated in this contract the equivalent of any sum or amount in pounds gold or in shillings gold may be paid, such equivalent may be in dollars in l nited States currency, or pounds sterling. It is agreed, furthermore, that the equivalent of pounds gold or shillings gold, for any payment which may be made hereunder in dollars, United States currency or in pounds sterling (with the exception of the first payment provided for in article 18 hereof), shall be based on the average of the rate of exchange as computed over a period of three months immediately preceding the due date of the payment. Article 18. All payments provided in this contract to be made to the Government may be made by tendering such payment directly to the Government, or by depositing the amount due to the credit of the Government in some bank which the Govern ment designates in writing, and which the Government may change from time to time by giving written notice to the Company long enough in advance, so that Company will have sufficient time to make future payments to the new bank. It is agreed that Government will designate such bank in Saudi Arabia, or in the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, but’ that no bank in Saudi Arabia will be so designated unless such bank has a correspondent in United States of America, England or Holland, through which bank transfers of money to Saudi Arabia may be made. Once the Company has made the proper payment to the Government or has deposited the proper sum to such correspondent for transfer to a bank in Saudi Arabia, the Company shall be free of all further responsibility in connexion with payment. It is agreed, however, that the first payment of £35,000 gold, or its equivalent (comprising the first payment and the first annual rental), shall be made, within fifteen days after the effective date of this agreement, to a correspondent in New York or in London, of Netherlands Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel- Maatschappij) at Jed da, Saudi Arabia, to be transmitted without delay, and at the expense of the Company, to said society and to be delivered to the Government upon obtaining a proper receipt from the Government for such payment. If this first payment is not made in gold, it will be made in pounds sterling at the current rate of exchange at the time the Company makes the payment to such correspondent. Article 19. As soon as practicable after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall select some point within Saudi Arabia for the erection of a plant for manufacturing sufficient gasoline and kerosene to meet the ordinary requirements of the Government, providing, of course, that the character r 17968] B 36 of the crude oil found will permit of the manufacture of such products on a com mercial basis by the use of ordinary refining methods, and provided further that the amount of oil developed is sufficient for the purpose. It is understood that the ordinary requirements of the Government shall not include resale inside or outside of the country. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary arrangements, and as soon as the Company has obtained the G-overnment’s consent to the proposed location, the Company shall proceed with the erection of such plant. During each year following the date of completion of this plant, the Company shall offer free to the Government, in bulk, 200,000 American gallons of gasoline, and 100.000 gallons of kerosene, it being understood that the facilities provided by the Government for accepting these deliveries shall not impede or endanger the Company’s operations. Article 20. The Company, at its own expense, will employ the necessary number of guards and guides to protect its representatives, its camps and installations. The Government promise to co-operate fully in supplying the best soldiers and men available for this responsibility, and in furnishing every reasonable protection, at rates not exceeding those customarily paid by the Government or others for similar services, it being understood that the expense for such services shall be paid by the Company through the Government. Article 21. In return for the obligations assumed by the Company under this contract, and for the payments required from the Company hereunder, the Company and enterprise shall be exempt from all direct and indirect taxes, imposts, charges, fees and duties (including, of course, import and export duties), it being under stood that this privilege shall not extend to the sale of products within the country, nor shall it extend to the personal requirements of the individual employees of the Company. Any material imported free of duty may not be sold within the country without first paying the corresponding import duty. Article 22. It is understood, of course, that the Company has the right to use all means and facilities it may deem necessary or advisable in order to exercise the rights granted under this contract, so as to carry out the purposes of this enterprise, including among other things the right to construct and use roads, camps, buildings, structures and all systems of communication, to install and operate machinery, equipment and facilities in connexion with the drilling of wells, or in connexion with the transportation, storage, treatment, manufacture, dealing with, or exportation of petroleum and its derivatives, or in connexion with the camps, buildings and quarters of the personnel of the company; to construct and use storage reservoirs, tanks and receptacles; to construct and operate wharves, piers, sealoading lines and all other terminal and port facilities; and to use all forms of transportation of personnel, or equipment, and of petroleum and its derivatives. It is understood, however, that the use of aeroplanes within the country shall be subject to a separate agreement. The Company shall also have the right to develop, carry away and use water. It likewise shall have the right to carry away and use any water belonging to the Government, for the operations of the enterprise, but so as not to prejudice irriga tion or to deprive any lands, houses or watering places for cattle, of a reasonable supply of water from time to time. The Company may also take for use, but only to the extent necessary for the purpose of the enterprise, other natural products belonging to the Government, such as surface soil, timber, stone, lime, gypsum stone and similar substances. Government officials and agents, in pursuance of official business, shall have the right to use such communications and transportation facilities as the Company may establish, provided that such use shall not obstruct or interfere with the C ompany s operations hereunder, and shall not impose upon the Company any substantial burden of expense. In times of national emergency the use of the Company’s transportation and communication facilities by the Government shall entitle the Company to faircompensation for any loss it may sustain thereby, whether through damage to the Company’s facilities, equipment or installation or through the obstruction or interference with the Company’s operations. Article 23. The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans, who shall employ Saudi Arab nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the Company can find suitable Saudi Arab employees it will not employ other nationals. In respect of the treatment of the Saudi Arab nationals as employees, the Company shall abide by the existing laws of the country applicable generally to employees of any other industrial enterprise. Article 24. The Government reserves the right to search for and obtain any substance or products, other than those exclusively granted under this contract, within the area covered by this agreement, except land occupied by wells or other installa tions of the Company, provided always that the right thus reserved by the Government shall be exercised so as not to endanger the operations of the Company or interfere with its rights hereunder, and provided also that a fair compensation shall be paid to the Company by the Government for all damage the Company may sustain through the exercise of the right so reserved by the Government. In any grant of such right so reserved by the Government, the concessionnaire shall be bound by the provisions of this article. Article 25. The Company is hereby empowered by the Government to acquire from any occupant the surface rights of any land which the Company may find necessary to use in connexion with the enterprise, provided that the Company shall pay the occupant for depriving him of the use of the land. The payment shall be a fair one with respect to the customary use made of the land by the occupant. The Government will lend every reasonable assistance to the Company in case of any difficulties with respect to acquiring the rights of a surface occupant. The Company, of course, shall have no right to acquire or to occupy Holy Places. Article 26. The Company shall supply the Government with copies of all topographical maps and geological reports (as finally made and approved by the Company) relating to the exploration and exploitation of the area covered by this contract. The Company shall also furnish the Government, within four months after the end of each year, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, a report of the operations under this contract during the year. These maps and reports shall be treated as confidential by the Government. Article 27. No failure or omission on the part of the Company to carry out or to perform any of the terms or conditions of the contract shall give the Government any claim against the Company, or be deemed a breach of this contract, in so far as such failure or omission may arise from force majeure. If through force rrmjeure the fulfilment of any term'or condition of this contract should be delayed, the period of the delay, together with such period as may be required for the restora tion of any damage done during such delay, shall be added to the terms or periods fixed in this contract. Article 28. The Company may terminate the contract at any time by giving the Govern ment thirty days’ advance notice in writing, whether by letter or by telegraph, provided that the telegraphic notice is promptly confirmed by letter. Upon the termination of this contract through such notice or through any other cause, the8 Government and the Company shall thereafter be free of all further obligations under this contract, except as follows :— (1) The Company’s immovable property, such as roads, water or oil wells with their casings, permanent buildings and structures, &amp;e., shaU| become the property of the Government free of charge. ^ (2) The Company shall afford the Government an opportunity to purchase the movable property of the enterprise in Saudi Arabia at a fair price equal to the replacement value of such property at the time, less depreciation. Any controversy about this fair price shall be settled by arbitration in the same manner as provided in article 31 of this contract. If the Government declines or fails, within two months following the date of the termination of this contract, to purchase such movable property, or if the Government fails to tender the purchase price within thirty days after it has been decided upon, by agreement or arbitration, the Company shall then have six months within which to remove such property. Article 29. In case of the breach by the Company of its obligation to make the second payment of £20,000 gold, or its equivalent as provided in article 6 hereof, or of its obligation to commence operations connected with drilling as set forth in article 10 hereof, or of its obligation to make two advances of £50,000 gold, each, or its equivalent under the terms and conditions provided in article 11 hereof, or of its obligation under article 30 hereof to pay the amount of any damages which may be assessed upon the Company, the Government’s remedy shall be the right to give the Company notice at once for such breach, and thereupon if the Company does not take immediate steps to comply with the obligation so breached, the Government may terminate this contract.

Any controversy which may arise as to whether or not the Company has committed the alleged breach shall be settled by arbitration in the manner 'provided in this agreement. Once that the fact of the commission of the breach has been established, the failure of the Company to take immediate steps to remedy the breach shall subject the Company to the payment of damages to the Government, and if such damages cannot be agreed upon they shall be determined by arbitra tion in the manner provided in this contract. The amount of any damages which may be determined shall be paid to the Government by the Company within sixty days after such determination. Article 31. If any doubt, difference or dispute shall arise between the Government and the Company concerning the interpretation or execution of this contract, or anything herein contained or in connexion herewith, or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder, it shall, failing any agreement to settle it in another way, be referred to two arbitrators, one of whom shall be chosen by each party, and a referee who shall be chosen by the arbitrators before proceeding to arbitration Each party shall nominate its arbitrator within thirty days of being requested in writing by the other party to do so. In the event of'arbitrators failing to agree upon a referee, the Government and the Company shall, in agreement appoint a referee, and m the event of their failing to agree they shall request the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice to appoint a referee. The decision of the arbitrators, or in the case of the difference of opinion between them the decision of the referee, shall be final. The place of arbitration shall be such as may be agreed upon by the parties, and in default of agreement shall be I he Hague, Holland.9 Article 32. The Company may not, without the consent of the Government, assign its j’ ights and obligations under this contract to anyone, but it is understood that mm he Company, upon notifying the Government, shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a corporation it may organise exclusively for the purpose of this enterprise. Any such corporation or organisation, upon being invested with any or all of rights and obligations under this contract, and upon notification thereof to the Government, shall thereupon be subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. In the event that stock issued by any such corporation or organisation should be offered for sale to the general public, the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia shall be allowed a reasonable time to subscribe (upon similar terms and conditions offered to others), for at least 20 per cent, of such shares of stock so issued and offered for sale to the general public. Article 33. It is understood that the periods of time referred to in this agreement shall be reckoned on the basis of the solar calendar. Article 34. The effective date of this contract shall be the date of its publication in Saudi Arabia, following the notification of this contract by the Company. Article 35. This contract has been drawn up in English and in Arabic. Inasmuch as most of the obligations hereunder are imposed upon the Company and inasmuch as the interpretation of the English text, especially as regards technical obligations and requirements relating to the oil industry, has been fairly well established through long practice and experience in contracts such as the present one, it is agreed that while both texts shall have equal validity, nevertheless, in case of any divergence of interpretation as to the Company’s obligations hereunder, the English text shall prevail. Article 36. It is understood that the contract, after being signed in Saudi Arabia, shall be subject to ratification by the Company at its offices in San Francisco. California, before it shall become effective. After both texts of this contract have been signed in duplicate in Saudi Arabia, the signed copies shall be sent by registered mail in the next out-going mail to the Company in San Francisco. California, and within fifteen days after receipt in San Francisco the Company shall transmit to the Government by telegraph whether or not it ratifies this contract. If the contract is not ratified by the Company within fifteen days after that period, it shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. Likewise, if the amount of the first payment and the first annual rental is not made within the time agreed upon in article 18 hereof, the Government may declare this contract to be null and void and of no further force or effect. Upon ratification of this contract by the Company, one signed copy of each text, together with the necessary evidence as to ratification by the Company, shall be returned to the Government. Also upon ratification of this contract by the Company, the contract shall be published in Saudi Arabia in the usual manner. Signed this 29th day of the month of May 1933. Letter to his Excellency Sheikh A bdulla Suleiman-al-Hamdan. Dear Sheikh Abdulla, Jedda, May 29, 1933. REFERRING to the contract which has been signed to-day by you, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California, relative to an oil concession covering a portion of Eastern Saudi Arabia, I am setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shallbe considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated in the said contract, namely, the “ Government ” and the “ Company,” and the said contract shall be referred to as the “ Saudi Arab Concession.” 1. The Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession coverin b a certain area described in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area, exclusive of the so-called Neutral Zone also referred to in the same article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer for such concession that may be made the Government by others in good faith and that the Government may be willing and ready to accept. Within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered and so presented to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 2. The Company’s preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession, shall be a right to equal, with respect to the rights of the Government in the Neutral Zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of Koweit for a concession covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. In the absence of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh of Koweit, the Government will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit whereby the Company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone. In either of these two events, the Company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, or covering the terms of the proposed concession embracing the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, as the case may be, within which to decide and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 3. The consent of the Government must be obtained before the Company shall have any right to examine the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. 4. The provisions of article 35 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall also apply to this agreement.Notes. r/ Minute Paper. Register No. P. z. 6656/38 (!)

Petroleum Concessions Limited have now submitted a firm offer to the Saudi Government (though the Saudi Legation in London). They propose that the existing concession in Nejd (v/hich is proving to be a bad bargain) should be cancelled and that a new concession should be concluded covering both the existing concession area and the additional areas in Saudi Arabia (including the Saudi-Iraq and the Saudi-Koweit Neutral Zone&gt;) not otherwise disposed of to the Calarabian Company. For this the Company offer £/ 7193£100,000 gold, i.e. half the sum mentioned hy Mr* Skliros during his conversation at the Foreign Office on the 30th August. V# ^ It is understood that what the Company really want is the Kov/eit Neutral Zone area - the value of which must have considerably increased since the discovery of oil in Koweit proper and in Hasa* But the Calarabian Company are also fully alive to the possibilities of this area and a fortnight ago Mr. Ballantyne mentioned, in the course of a conversation here, that his Company might before long wish to secure a concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone. He said that the plan which he had been turning over in his mind was that the Calarabian Company should obtain a concession from Ibn Saud and that a British Company should then be formed by association between the Standard Oil Company of California and British interests (who would not , he said, be the Iraq Petroleum Company) for the purpose of obtaining concessional rights from the Sheikh of Kov/eit. Nothing definite had been decided yet but he hoped J that when the time came for an approach to the Sheikh we would be helpful to his Company. In such circumstances it seems improbable that the Calarabian Company will be prepared to relinquish their rights in Arabia for the sum offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited and we may see some lively bidding before the matter is finally settl^ 1 SEEN PCHJTICAL COMMiTTEa.FILE COPY CJ., • INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, pleas^quote • No. /■ S¥f2./ fe&gt;3L /£?/. and address —not to a?iy person by'jtapie, but to-/- “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

FOR INFORMATION. The attached record of a recent conversation between representatives of Petroleum Concessions limited and Mr. Baggallay at the Foreign Office is of interest as showing the limits to which this Company are prepared to go in order to obtain oil rights in Eastern Arabia and in the Koweit Neutral Zone. 2. The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea Area (held by Petroleum Concessions Limited) or Hasa Area (held by the Standard Oil Company) Cjatf^e^dT^ns is still uncertain. Information/2 Information has recently “been received, however, which points to the probability that the original (4*7'*'**) concession Agreement between the Saudi Government and the Standard Oil Company was subsequently modified by a 'Special Agreement' the effect of which is to accord to the Standard Oil Company — 'a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Arabia (including Ibn Saud^ rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone) as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area (i.e. the Hasa Concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations'. On the same date as the conclusion of this 'Special Agreement' letters v^ere exchanged by the Company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the Company^ preference rights in regard to (a) the balance of Eastern Arabia not already covered by the Standard Oil Company’s Concession and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone. The effect of these preference rights is to entitle the Standard Oil Company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi-Arabian Government by another Company. If the Standard Oil Company elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi-Arabian Government is free to accept the other Company’s offer. Otherwise the Standard Oil Company’s preference rights continue at least as long as the conditions of the Special Agreement remain in force. 3- Last year Petroleum Concessions Limited stated that they were prepared to offer Ibn Saud £ 100,000 for oil rights over the areas in question but as will be seen from the record of the recent conversation they are now prepared to increase this offer to £ 200,000 in the first instance with an/■■ ' x Minute Paper. Department. sS an upper limit of gSbo.OOQ . M r. Skliros apparently realises that the Standard Oil Company will cap his £200,000 offer and if the American Company adopt the same attitude in regard to the mainland of Arabia as they have recently done in the case of Bahrein, not even £ 500,000 may be sufficient to induce them to part with their preferential rights, more especially as oil has now been struck in Hasa and in Koweit proper.

Skliros, Managing Director of Petroleum Concessions Limited, accompanied by Major Longrigg, called here this morning. 2. Mr. Skliros said that his company were anxious to try to obtain a concession for that part of Eastern Saudi Arabia not already covered by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company concession. He wished to enquire whether we had any objection to this and whether we had any more information concerning the preference rights of California Arabian Standard Oil Company over the unallotted area. It was his opinion that Ibn Baud would be very glad to give this area to a British company; he had also been assured by the Sheikh of Koweit that once the negotiations over the Koweit blockade were concluded, he was confident that he would be able to obtain the transfer to himself of Ibn Baud's rights over the Koweit Neutral Zone, 3. I said that we would certainly have no objection if Petroleum Concessions Limited made an offer for the unallotted area to Ibn Baud, As regards the preference rights, I thought that Petroleum Concessions Limited and ourselves were agreed that these rights amounted to no more than a right to cap any other offer; if California Arabian Standard Oil Company were not prepared to offer as good terms as another company, then the Saudi Arabian Government would be entitled to give the concession to that other company. We were not quite sure how far these preference rights extended, but I could tell him for his confidential information that they appeared to cover an area as far west of the Hasa concession areaarea as 'the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations', wherever that might be. I hoped Mr. Skliros was right in his belief that Ibn Saud would prefer a British company to take up the concession; but I pointed out that our present friendly relations were in danger of being compromised by differences over our policy in Palestine. I also very much doubted whether the Sheikh of Koweit’s optimism in regard to the Neutral Zone was justified, unless he had something very tempting up his sleeve to offer Ibn Saud in exchange for his rights in that area. 4. Mr. Skliros said that he proposed to offer the Saudi Arabian Government £200.000 in the first instance; this sum would almost certainly be capped by California Arabian Standard Oil Company, but his company were prepared to go up to £500,000* Ke supposed that if our view of the preference rights were correct, a process of bargaining might continue till one or other of the competitors dropped out. 5. Mr. Skliros also said that he would now, as a first step, approach the Saudi Arabian Minister and ask for information as to the extent of the area over which California Arabian Standard Oil Company had preference rights. I asked that he would not allude, in conversation with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, to any information I had given about the geographical extent or nature of the America company’s concession rights. I also pointed out that as Sheikh Hafiz knew very little about this matter, it would probably be necessary to impress upon him the importance of taking up the matter with his government. Mr. Skliros said he would do so. He added that if Petroleum Concessions Limited made an offer for the unallotted area, it would at any rate have the effect of compellingcompelling California Arabian Standard Oil Company to come into the open and announce their intentions with regard to this area. 6. In the course of the conversation, Major Longrigg mentioned that the results of the exploration of the Red Sea concession area had proved very disappointing. A further surveying party would be going out this autumn, but he had little hope of any oil being discovered. He also said that the ''contact line between the sedimentary and igneous 'formations' meant that the American company’s preference rights extended westwards across the Arabian peninsula as long as there was any oil-bearing i. e. sedimentary formations. Most of ©astern Saudi Arabia consisted of igneous formations, except for a narrow strip along the Red Sea coast. (Sd.) L.

The following information may also be Interesting though I do not vouch for its entire accuracy. 1 believe that the California Company are negotiating - or intending to negotiate • with Tbn Saud with a view to dispensing with the clavse in their concession requiring them to construct a refinery in Saudi Arabian territory. The refinery clause in the present concession does not actually state what quantity (or percentage) of crude oil found in rabia aaiat be refined there, but I under stand that it ao happens that the vnry next clause requires the Company to supply refined products 'up to the needs of' the Saudi Government. So if the two are read together they pre sumably contain the answer. If this is so then only a very minute refinery has to be constructed there, and it is pre sumably for this reason that the approach is to be made to Ibn Saud to waive the requirements of this particular clause without actually omitting it from the concession. A remark made was roughly aa follows:- 'If Ibn Sand and shaikh Hamad between them do not force us to build a refinery in Arabia then these coastal surveys will be of Interest only for locat ing ports for landing equipment and stores! The reference to dhalkh Hamad of course relates to the struggle for the Unallotted Arse • Yours sincerely, 3d/- H.

He described it as richer than that of California. He said that the expenditure of a sum of five million dollars up to the end of 1938 had been autnorised, and that a refinery 5 - would have to be built in Hasa as the one at Bahrain was only sufficient for local purposes. Well No. 7 had been shut down, as there was nowhere to put the oil at present. — ILI Thejse statements were made to Day, who, as manager of Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited, represents the Shell interests in the Hejaz, and they should perhaps be discounted a little, as Lenahan may have been trying to scare the Shell.

D&amp;lrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bah rain, and Lr. C.W. Deacon, Resident Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, on the subject of imp orting Arabian Crude Oil.■■■■PPatHBa THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMI MEMORANDUM. June 2 The subject of importing oil from Arabia was discussed this morning by Mr. Deacon and Mr. Belgrave in the latter* s office. The question of duties and royalties was briefly re viewed. The point was brought up that whereas it was agreed the imported oil was royalty free, it is plainly stated in our concession agreement that oil used to refine the import ed crude is definitely subject to royalty. The next item to be discussed was the gauging of the imported oil. The Company’s proposed general plan of handling this oil was outlined as follows:- (1) Receive oil in Bahrain Petroleum Company barges at A1 Khobar. ( 2 ) Transport to Zellaq. (3) Unload barges at Zellaq into small gauging tanks. (4) Have Government gauges taken. (5) Pump the Arabian oil thru to Tanks 152 and 153 at Refinery. ( 6 ) Subtract quantity of Arabian oil from the general gauge into tanks 152 and 153 and thus obtain the amount of Bahrain crude released to the Refinery. It was agreed that whereas the crude is gauged in Arabia, still it is subject to some possible loss in transporting it to Bahrain and it should therefore be gauged upon arrival at Zellaq. It was pointed out that this oil would be delivered from Zellaq direct to the royalty gauging tanks at the Refinery, us ing that part of the gathering system from No. 5 Tank Battery onwards. On this account the gauging at Zellaq should be exact ly done so that by subtracting the amount of Arabian Crude pump ed thru to Tanks 152 and 153 from the total amount of crude oil delivered to the Refinery, the amount of Bahrain crude subiect to royalty can be obtained. J This procedure was agreeable to both parties. The ques tion of cor ect measurement of the Arabian crude into Zellaq tanks was next brought up. Inasmuch as these are small tanks and the cost of having Redwoods of London send a man out to strap these tanks seemed prohibitive, and since it is very ppe probable that Redwoods will be sending a man out later in the year to strap other tanks now contemplated, it was agreed that it v/ould be satisfadtory to have one of our engineers strap these tanks under the supervision of a Government representative. The measurements secured would then be sent to Redwoods in London for calculation and preparation of proper gauge charts. Later in the year when Redwoods will probably have a man in Bah rain, he will again strap these tanks for a check, and if any discrepancy is found on comparison with the original figures, adjustments would be made to the gauges taken to date. A copy of the foregoing is to be sent to The California standard Oil Coy. in London, for their viev/s, and a final procedure will be drawn up along these lines, and submitted to the Government and the Political Agent. 3d/- C. Dalrymple Belgrave Sd/- C.W. DeaconEnclosure in Foreign Office covering note No.E.3738/1036/91 dated 28th June 1938. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 28th June, 1938 P.Z.4532/38 (E 3738/1036/91) Immediate Confidential . —' Dear Longrigg, We have recently heen able to make some more enquiries remains in being the preference rights also remain in being, irrespective of whether the advance of £50,000 (i.e. the payments referred to in Articles 3 and 5 of the Agreement of the 27th May 1933) are repaid or remain unpaid, or of how they are repaid i.e. whether they are repaid out of royalties or in any other manner. 3. At the same time, the preference rights do not seem to be more than a right to cap other offers. In other words, if another company makes an offer which the Saudi Arabian Government regard as an acceptable basis for a concession, the Standard Oil Company must either enter into an agreement on terms equally satisfactory to the Saudi Arabian Government or else leave the Saudi Arabian Government free to conclude an agreement with that or any other company on the terms which the Standard Oil Company has rejected. If, however, the Saudi Arabian Government do not, in the event, conclude any agreement on those terms, the rights continue as before. 4. We should be glad if you would communicate with us before entering into any discussion of the exact nature of the preference rights with any Saudi official. about the preference rights obtained by the Standard Oil Company over those parts of Nejd lying outside the Hasa concession area. 2.

The Legation are, however, making further enquiries and we hope to hear from them again before long. Meanwhile, I am afraid that all that we can say is that such information as we have hitherto been able to obtain shows that it is at least arguable that the Saudi Arabian Government cannot free themselves from their obligation to the Company except by payments out of royalties ; but, as mentioned above, we are not ourselves sure of the exact position.

The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have recently com pleted a Well at Dammam on the Mainland which is believed to be capable of producing a substantial quantity of petroleum, and other Wells in the same field are being drilled to determine whether a commercial oil field has oeen discovered. It will be necessary to produce oil from these -ells for the purpose of conducting satisfactory tests of their capacity. At the present time there are no facilities on the Mainland for storing the crude oil thus produced: therefore, the California Arabian Standaid oil company have arranged to sell it to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited: it will be barged across to Zellak, thence by pipe to one of the 'field-gathering stations' on Bahrein Island. The tanks con- ) ^ stituoing the 'iratnering Station' are calibrated so that an exact measure- • | 1 Ll J,ient may 1ce ‘ fcaken the crude oil entering and leaving the 'Station'. The Resident Manager of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited v is shortly informing the Bahrein Government of their purchase and proposals with a view to making arrangements satisfactory to that Government for the measurement of the quantity of the Bahrein oil which may be used in con- TLvwA tl c l. R ( Utjvi.;nection with the handling and refining of llainland Orude, and other like questions. that these operations arising fron the testing of the Wells on the Mainland are not necessarily indicative of further opera tions of a like nature in the future. What the future holds in regard to the production, measurement and disposal of petrol eum obtained on the l.lainland (assuming always production of petrol eum in commercial quantities) the California Arabian Standard Oil Company cannot even venture to suggest.

Rendel promised Longrigg at the time that we would ask you by telegram whether you could obtain confirmation of the information received by the company from Jedda, but by an oversight, for which I must take full responsibility, this was never done# 3. I have, however, asked Zada whether he has the text ol the option in London, since, as you will remember, it was proposed some months ago that the Saudi Arabian Legation should take legal advice as to the extent to which the option was binding upon them, and they could hardly take legal advice without providing their counsel with the actual text of the option. 4. I made it clear to Zada that I did not want to make any request which would embarrass him personally. He told me in reply that he would willingly let me have the text if it was in his possession, but added that to the best of his recollection the Legation had, as a matter of fact, when the question first arose, not been able to obtain advice for the very reason that they did not have the necessary texts. 5. I have heard no more from him, so I expect that he is still without the text, and is perhaps asking his Government to/ Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., J edda.to supply it. 6. In the meanwhile Longrigg had heard from Hamilton of the California Arabian Oil Company that the option extends not only to the Kuwait Neutral Zone, but to all unallotted areas in Nejd. 7. If it were possible for you to obtain confirmation of this information the Company would be very glad to have it. (Sd) LACY BAGGALLAYi J COPY.

([65] Dear Mr. Rendel, You will remember our conversation on the 22nd instant, regarding the extent of the Standard Oil Company of California’s option over the unallotted parts of Saudi Arabia. You very kindly undertook to ask Sir Reader Bullard by cable for such information as he could obtain. Meanwhile the information which reaches us this morning from our Jeddah Office seems to support the more pessimistic view which I gave you — that the option covers much more than the Kuwait Neutral Zone. The following is the text of our queries to Jeddah on the 21st:- 'We understand that Standard Oil Company of California in 1953 as part of al Hasa Concession arrangements obtained option or prior right to concessions over all central Sauai Arabia from which option Government can release itself only by repayment out of al Hasa royalties of loan advanced by S.O.C. of C. Try with all discretion to verify from Najib or local S.O.C. of C. representative**. and the following is Jeddah’s reply this morning:- **Your telegram of 21st from information received from Standard Oil Company of California representative we understand in case of relinquishment of al Hasa Concession option on central Saudi Arabia continues until all sums owing by Government have been paid but during the life of Concession option continues until S.O.C. of C. elects not to exercise their right toand until such offer has been accepted by Government and Concession has been granted. 1 ' If the Minister replies to you in a similar sense, we shall at least know where we stand.

Mr. Trott mentioned the visit of Mr. SoHo /allace, of the California- Texas Oil Company, and I have the honour to supplement the information which was available at that time, Mr. Wallace, v/ho does in fac&amp; appear to represent 'Caltex', though his card describes him as 'Texas Company (Saudi Arabia) Limited' left on December 19th. for Nairobi, after seeing Ibn Saud and arranging for the importation of petrol and other oil products for the account of the Saudi Government. The explanation of this transaction, as supplied by Mr. Lenahan, the Jedda manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Cornpany, is as follows: The search for oil in Hasa at depths up to two thousand feet has so far been unsuccessful,, Hope has not been abandoned, and it is proposed to drill one of ihe wells to four thousand feet, as rich supplies of oil at that depth were found in a rather similar formation in Bahrain« Drilling was proceeding and it was hoped that there might be some good news to give The King when he visited Jedda (December l3th-15th), but just at that moment the drill broke. As some consolation for the bad fortune experienced hitherto it was proposed to offer the Saudi Government some petrol etc. as an advance against the quantities which C.A, S.O.C, were bound by their concession to offer to the Government free every year when oil should be found in commercial The Right Honourable .mthony Eden, hi.C,, iUP &gt; , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;Co/77 commercial quantities. The offer had been accepted, and nr. /allace would shortly ship the undermentioned oil products, oririnally from Texas but immediately from Nairobi: twenty thousand eight-gallon cases of petrol. two thousand eight-gallon cases of herosine. two hundred tons of Diesel oil. 2* Mr i Lenahan infoms me that his company arc not at the moment interested in Saudi Arabia comm rcially and he has assured Messrs. Gellatly, Hanliey and Company (Sudan) Limited, the ''Shell'' agents in Jedda, that they are acting under pressure, a contention to which the report of His Majesty’s Political agency at Bahrain (for the period November 1st to November 15th) gives some support. It seems reasonable to suppose that if the Hasa wells begin to produce oil the Saudi Government will satisfy their needs and that of the local market directly or indirectly from that source of supply, but Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, are not convinced that •'Caltex” have not immediate commercial aims also. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey, as ''Shell” agents, have a contract with the Saudi Government, signed in September 1957 and due to expire early in 1958, under which they undertake to supply the Saudi Government with specified quantities of petrol, kerosine, lubricating oil and grease at fixed prices and any more that is required at the rate of the day, while the Saudi Government undertake not to purchase supplies from anyone else and not to allow the semi-official motor transport combine to purchase from anyone but the sellers, provided that the sellers satisfy the combine’s requirements. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey believe that the Saudi Government will take up the quantities specified in this contract, but even if they are not taken up in fullV7Sj full it is doubtful whether the transaction with 'Caltex 1 ' could he attacked as an infringement of the contract s for although 5 as I understand, prices have been specified for the :; Caltex' products, it could be urp.ed that the consi nment is merely an advance on account of free supplies due from CoA.bo0,C o to the Saudi Government later on and that the Government are not ’'buying” it. It is extremely doubtful whether the Government will ever pay for the consignment, for if no oil is found in Hasa and the C.A.S.O.C. concession is abandoned, C i? /!• o So Co C. will probably have to write off this £1,0 00, 000. item with many others e.g. the million or so pounds spent on £ 90,0 00 goldjd rilling, and the ninety thousand pounds gold which Mr. Lenahan says has been paid already to the Saudi Government. If CoAoScOoCo have such a contingency in mind it would provide one possible explanation of their action in specifying for the consignment from East Africa prices which Messrs. Gellatly- Hankey and Company are sure cannot cover the cost, let alone yield a profit. On the other hand there is some evidence to show that CoA.S.O.C. are trying to secure a contract for the regular supply of petrol etc. , and if they offered supplies for a long period at the prices fixed for the first consignment the Shell Company would probably be unable to compete. 5 . The Gellatly, Hankey contract does not mention the area to which it applies, but the fim say that it applies only to the Hejaz. The quantities are relatively small, as will appear from the attached table which shows the quantities of petrol, kerosine etc. sold in the Hejaz during the whole of 1937 less the last ten days. It will be noticed that the Saudi Government, together with the semi-official motor car oombine, takes ten times as much petrol as all other consumers put together.L» 17 ? 4, I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.17(1841/81/75)).

Section 3. [E 1537/1283/25] Sir A. Ryan to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 21.) (No. 61. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, February 28, 1936. WITH reference to Mr. Calvert’s despatch N o. 276 of the 8th October last, I have the honour to state that I had an interesting conversation on the 27th February with Mr. W. J. Lenahan, the local representative of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, about the position in regard to the company’s concession in Hasa. Mr. Lenahan had offered spontaneously to come and tell me all he could. Although he made no secret of what he had to say, I would ask you to regard this record as confidential and not for the information of rival industrial interests. 2 Mr. Lenahan referred to the recent creation of a new company, technically British, under the name of the “ California Standard Oil Company (Limited).” Its head office is in San Francisco, and the directors are all United States citizens, except one Frenchman and a London solicitor, Mr. H. R. J Ballantyne, of whom the other interested parties think very highly. The moving r spirit in London is Mr. L. N. Hamilton, with whom I am on very friendly terms. 3. Mr. Lenahan explained that the new company would deal with the marketing of Bahrein oil, and would also act as a “ service unit ” for the Bahrein Oil Company, i.e., attend to their supplies and the recruitment of their rapidly increasing imported personnel. It would in due course perform the same functions for the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 4. Mr. Lenahan spoke of the relations of his company with the Saudi Government. They had found Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Director of Finance, &amp;c., in Hasa, most obstructive. They now have nothing more to do with him, except as regards certain customs matters, and they are greatly pleased with the special official, Seyyid Hashim, who was sent to Hasa to look after their business last July (see paragraph 223 of Jedda report for July). This gentleman is now in the Hejaz, but his employment in Hasa is of a permanent nature and he will soon be going back there. 5 Mr. Lenahan gave me an account of the position at Jebel Dhahran, the only place in which wells have been sunk. I was not able to take in all the technical details, but I reproduce what I understood. 6. The Jebel Dhahran is not a single eminence, but an “ anticline ” measuring very roughly 10 miles by 4. This is similar in essentials to the structure at Bahrein, and the nature of the operations in the Jebel has been based on this analogy. Well No. 1 was sunk at the apex of the anticline. Oil at the rate of 100 barrels a day was struck at a depth of 1,979 feet. Lower down. I understand, difficulty was encountered owing to the great volume of gas. In this connexion Mr. Lenahan mentioned, I think, a figure of 80 million cubic feet of gas at a depth of 2,400 feet, but I am not clear as to the significance of this figure. Practicable oil may be struck at greater depths. Drilling was recently resumed, and some days ago the depth was 2.365 feet, “ deep-drilling through a cement plug.” Preparations were being made “ to run a 6f-inch casing.” 7. In view of their experience with Well No. 1, the company decided to start Well No. 2 in the same anticline, hoping that the oil, the existence of which has been proved by the partial success of No. 1, might there be more workable. This new well is 1,800 metres to the south and 900 metres to the west of No. 1. It had reached a depth of 430 feet some days ago, but, when Mr. Lenahan spoke to me on the 27th, he had heard unofficially that the latest depth was over 500 feet. 8. Mr. Lenahan spoke with definite, though guarded, optimism of the prospects in the Jebel Dhahran. He told me that the company’s geologists were [656 x—3]still busy prospecting in the coastal area further north, and, I gathered, inland. One of the areas he mentioned was that round Jubail. 9. Some of the above information has already been recorded, but, as Mr. Lenahan was good enough to give me a connected account, I have thought it best to report it in a self-contained form. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Oversea^ Trade, Bushire, Bahrein and the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.P. Z. 1528/36.

My dear Rendel, Your letter No. 6166/173/25 of the 30tu October. Since my letter to you No. 2362/42/84 of the 2nd October, I have made very discreet enquiries here but have been quite unable to gain any information which would strengthen the surmise that a new concession had been signed by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. I feel that were there any foundation for the report that a new concession, or agreement of any sort, had in fact been signed, news would almost certainly have leaked out here before now. Moreover, before Lenahan left Jedda last July, I had one or two quite private conversations with him, and consider that it would be unlikely for one who is usually frank, friendly and, as you probably know, not the model of discretion, to forbear from dropping a hint on a question of this nature.

WITH reference to the Eastern Department’s communication of the 25th August last, transmitting a copy, in print, of the text of the Oil Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of California and Ibn Saud, enclosed with the Political Resident’s express letter of the 5th June last to the Secretary of State for India, I have the honour to report that, as has been recorded in recent Jedda reports, during the past few weeks there have been several references in the Mecca press to the actual discovery of oil in Hasa by the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (Limited). 2. One of the first of these reports appeared in the Umm-al-Qura of the 30th August, where it was stated that oil in large quantities had been struck at the well at A1 Habr. As the staff of the company here declared at the time that this was the first news they had heard of the matter, I contented myself with reporting the press statement briefly in the Jedda report for August last. 3. Later reports in the newspapers were more circumstantial, one statement giving the depth to which drilling had reached as 1,959 feet, and adding that it was intended to go to a depth of 2,100 feet. The Saut-al-Hejaz of the 1st October contained the brief announcement that quantities of oil extracted were now increasing, and the daily output was estimated at 115 barrels. The head office of the company, it stated, had agreed to commence another well. 4. I gather that, although the Americans in the Jedda office of the company recently admitted that oil had been struck in Hasa, they stated that it had not yet been met with in anything like commercial quantities. The depth to which the company had drilled was, however, far less than the depths reached in Bahrein, and therefore it was presumed that a richer layer of oil-bearing rock lay below. 5. l am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire and Bahrein. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. [531 ee-^1]California Arabian Standard Oil Company , Mr. G. Williams, Acting Manager, informed the Assistant Political Agent on the 25th September that their first well has now reached a depth of about 1,950 feet and in rirs / his own expressive term 'they have just scratched their pay', i.e., they have found oil but not in paying quantities. Between 1,650 and 1,950 feet in this well, gas pressure was very great causing considerable inconvenience and some danger. The Company are now seeking permission to sink a second well••• • i,.i. mmm ^ ^ ouPY* (E 6166/173/26) (23:«- y &lt;2/84) f Y\z'. ) ! 7869 | j g 2 : BRITISH LEGATION JiiDDA, SAUDI ARABIA, October 2nd, 1935.

Gellatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited, Grisewood by name, who last year was for a considerable time here with the branch of his firm in Jedda. He was a very close friend of W.J. Lenahan, the Manager of the Jedda office of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and, I understand, has kept up a regular correspondence since he was transferred to Port Sudan. Grisewood remarked quite casually to Oppenheim that Lenahan, who left here on the 24th July for Hasa (spending three or four weeks in Egypt, Palestine and Syria en route), must be teelin, very pleased with himself 'now that he has signed his concession. We have had no indication irom any source here that a further concession, perhaps of a subsidiary character to the 1933 Hasa concession, was in the wind, and I will make such discreet enquiries as I am able locally, perhaps you may have further information at your end.

Cole says, and I agree with him, that if Bin Sa'ud were to hear of any suggestion that his oil should be piped to Bahrain, he would be likely to do all he could to stop it. I mention this as I think that it would be well to be very circumspect in anything we say to any of Bin Sard’s people on the subject. It is particularly desirable that he should not get any idea that we are interested or that we are at the back oi it. I am sending copy of this letter to Acheson and Cole.

Certain indirect benefits would naturally accrue to the Bahrein Government if the terminal of the pipeline were situated in their territory, and, in addition, they might possibly secure from the Company a moderate payment for the right to lay the pipeline; but I should doubt whether the Company would agree to pay the Shaikh anything in the nature of a levy per ton of oil pumped*Extract from Intelligence Report No. 13 of 1935 of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 1st to 15th July, 1935. 4.

Standard Oil Company’s Hasa Concession. Under Secretary Secretary of State.... y Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. t=£N TTfc e», A ft _ ^ ft Previous papers :— l We have now received from the Resident the complete text of the Concession agreement of May 1933 'between the Standard Oil Company of California and the Saudi Government, which has 'been procured 'by the Political Agent at Koweit (P. Z. 4127/35). It will he rememhered that the agreement as published (a revised translation of which will he found at P.Z.61/34) omitted certain important particulars regarding the financial terms and regarding the area of the concession. These are given in Articles 2, 3&gt; 4*5 and 9 of the complete agreement . (We had also recently had copies of these Articles privately from/from the A. P. 0«C. just before tlie Resident’s express letter arrived). Z. ihc financial terms of the concession are not new to us sine© received some time ago fairly reliable information in regard to them, which is noy/ confirmed. The Standard Oil had to pay £30,000 gold on the grant of the concession, followed by £20,000 gold eighteen months later. (it now seems clear that these payments are irrecoverable and not given as a loan to the Saudi Government, as we had originally gathered from the published agreement). The Company also pays an annual rental of £5,000 gold until the discovery of oil in commercial quantities when royalty at the rate of 4/- per ton becomes payable. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities the Company has to advance £50,000 gold to the Saudi Government as a loan repayable out of royalties and one year later a further £50,000 gold on the same terms. 3 . The area of the concession is given in Article 2 as being from the sea to the Y/estem edge of the 'Dahana” and from the northern to the southern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia ’'provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the Y/estern boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line 30^ west of North to the northern boundary of Saudi-Arabia, and from the Southern end of the westerly edg e o f the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line 30 East of South to the southern boundary of Saudi-Arabia * -The ''Dahana'' is a kind of hard gravelly desert such as is founa here along the East Coast of Arabia to a distance of about 150 miles from the sea Y/here it passes into 'Hefud' or sand dune country. The extent of the ''Dahana” country is shown very roughly on the attached sketch map (based on the map of Land Surface Features in the 'Handbook of Arabia”) but it has not been possible to identify the northern and southern ends of the westerly edge of the'Dahana”. Our previous information is that the present area of the concession22S i 3. Minute Paper. Department. 2956 6000 7/24 is approximately 40,000 square miles. Lf Reference is also invited to Col.Powle f s demi-official letter of 8th June (P.Z.4214/35 flagged) from v/hich it appears that if and when the Americans strike oil in Rasa they may wish to get the oil away hy laying a pipe-line from the mainland to Bahrein. The Resident is inclined to think that the advantages of allowing this in return for suitable terms outweigh the disadvantages. We have consulted the other departments demi-officially as to this and it will he seen that the Admiralty have now replied (P. Z. 4806/35) that in their view there would he every advantage in encouraging the Standard Oil Company to bring their oil to Bahrein for shipment. It would, in fact, almost certainly mean that the Navy would he able to use the Rasa Oil in times of emergency. r. '-vv c_e. ^ ^ A.

(My dear Fowle), I have read with great interest your Express Letter to the India Office No. 380-S of May 4th and the enclosure from Dickson, which amplify your telegram No. 437 of the same date regarding the projects of the standard Oil Company of California. I dash off a few ohservations hut they must he very hurried, as I am leaving for England first thing to-morrow. are of primary importance in determining Ihn Saud f s policy or that diminished prospects of oil east of the blue line would diminish his desire to assert territorial claims there. I think his attitude is rather that he wants to assert his claims for reasons connected with what he conceives to he his | M ancestral rights” as well as with his prestige and so forth. In fact, as I said at a meeting at home last year, he wants to he 'Lord of Arabia' and not merely lord of half Arabia. He would undoubtedly he greatly pleased, if oil also were added unto him. I see some analogy to the present case in his proceedings in Asir in and about 1926. He got a cinch in I do not myself think that potential oil considerations Asir Lt.Col. T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., - Bushire.Asir and then very ingeniously destroyed the then Farsan Islands concession; hut he wanted Asir, oil or no oil. I cannot hope to follow up here Dickson’s suggestion that I might try to verify his news. Short of a frontal attack on the representative of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, there is at present no quarter in which I could pursue enquiries. Fuad, who sometimes tells me things is in Europe; Yusuf Yasin is with the King at Riyadh; the Minister of Finance would give very little away, even if I knew him better and had the opportunity of sounding him; and Philby is also in Europe. You have doubtless had well in mind the fact that Standard Oil of California already have certain preferential rights in respect of an area west of that of their original concession. What we know of these rights is contained in the texts in my telegram to the Foreign Office No. 95 of May 4th 1934. As stated in my telegram No. 94 of that same date the Company acquired also a right of survey, which was defined in the following terms:- 'Furthermore the Company’s geologists shall have the right to examine the region covered by the preference right just referred to (excepting the Neutral Zone referred to above), in so far as such examination may be necessary or advisable for a better understanding of the geological character of the exclusive area.' It may well be that the Company, having exercised the right of survey, are now negotiating for a further concession in the western area on the strength of the preferential right. Perhaps I may add that in my opinion Dickson tends, in this and other connexions, to exaggerate Philby’s inside knowledgeknowledge. I am pretty certain that he is very little in Ihn Saud’s confidence regarding major political questions, though when they cease to he highly confidential and the King starts talking outside his innermost circle, he hears what the King says and what the entourage say. His views about the King's attitude towards Kuwait, for instance, are useful indications of what might be in Ibn Saud's mind in certain contingencies but they are not revelations of what i£3 in the King's mind hie et nunc . He is much more au courant of certain economic questions and I have never grasped his true position in the Standard Oil of California visit. Even so, if Philby had responded to a question of mine in the manner recorded in Dickson's C 117 of April 25th, I should simply have concluded that he was hiding not news but ignorance. As I said at the outset I have written this very hurriedly, else it might have been more fully considered. I enclose a duplicate, in case you should wish to send it on to Dickson. I am myself sending copies to the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and to Metcalfe. (Yours ever), ANDREW RYAN.My dear Laithwaite In reply to your letter P.Z.4127/35 of the 9th July, I write to say that, from the Admiralty point of view, v/e think there would he every advantage in encouraging the Standard Oil Company to bring their Kasa oil to Bahrein for shipment, not only for the reason mentioned by the Political Resident in paragraph 3(c) of his letter, but also because Bahrein will be allied territory in war and therefore free from any restrictions arising from neutrality on the shipment of the oil.

Sa^cll Arabia . (a) Early in the month a report was received that there had been trouble between certain American employees of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company ana their local labour. It was allegedthat a coolie, who had been roughly handled by an American, had lodged a complaint with the Amir of Qatif that he had been assaulted. The Amir informed Bin Jiluwi, Amir of Hasa, of the inciaent ana the latter telegraphed to King Bin Saud for oihers. The King is said to have ordered that work should be stopped and that the Company should discharge their foreign (Iraqis etc.) employees ana employ local labour in accordance with the terms of tneir concession. It is understood that this has been done. A recent report states that the American employee concerned has tendered an apology and that Mr. Miller, the Geologist in charge, has given an undertaking that such incidents will not recur. The matter has been closed, therefore, and work resunnd.

Cole had with Davies about the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in Hasa, Davies seemed to think that oil would be struck on the coast fairly soon, and that in that case, (and even if oil were eventually found inland towards Kuwait), they would liice to get it to the outside world by laying a pipe-line iron tne mainland to Bahrain whence it would be removed in tankers. 2. On a previous occasion when the Standard Oil Company proposed to base their aeroplane on Bahrain I was strongly against this proposal — vide my Bxp'ress setter h o »132-p Oj. 7th February 1934 - chiefly on the ground that it would allow a second American Company, besides the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to dig themselves into Bahrain, and perhaps make it a regular base and head office tor all their operations — vide paragraph 3 (3) of my Bxpress Letter just queued. 3. These disadvantages still hold in the case oi tne oresent proposal but they are I think more tnan ofiset by the following advantages: (a) If the Standard Oil Company go 1to the expense of laving their pipe-line to Bahrain they will cer*uaio-tlv not assist Ibn Saud in the development of Has Tanura. (b) The Bahrain Government should benefit since there is no reason why the Shaikh should allow the Standard Oil Company to extend their pipe-line to his territory free of charge.

In all thecircumstances therefore personally I am rather i in favour of the proposal.

You will recollect that the text previously available did not cover the detail of the area or cash payments. The initial payments of £^0,000 (gold) and £5,000 (gold) evidently constituted the 55,000 sovereigns which we know were paid by California in 1955.

Article 5 . Within the time agreed in article 16 of this agreement, the Company shall make a payment to the Government of thirty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. Article 4. The Company shall pay the Government annually the sum of five thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. For convenience this payment is termed an 'annual rental' and it is payable in advance. The first annual rental shall oe paid within the time agreed in Article 16 of this agreement^ thereafter so long as the contract is not terminated, the annual rental shall be due upon each anniversary of the effective date hereof and shall be payable within thirty days after such anniversary, provided that upon the commercial discovery of oil no further annual rental shall be due or payable. Article c 5 . If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Comoany I shall make a second payment to the Government, amounting to 1 twenty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such payment shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof but the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the payment. Article 9 . Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of fifty thousand^ pounds gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of fifty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, as provided in Article 8 hereof.and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later.^ In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance.

Ihe full news received from Riath comes from a 'quite reliable person' living there and is to the effect that the Standard Oil of California are satisfied that the southern half of their Hassa concession is not worth anything (this is the stretch lying roughly between Ojair and Jabrin Oasis). 2.

Such area would obviously include most of (^asim and the towns of Zilfi, Anaiza, Buraida,Ma jmaa and Hail. 3.

THE representative in Jedda of the Standard Arabian Oil Company of California, Mr. W. J. Lenahan, informed me on the 1st December that he had received, by that day’s mail, satisfactory news of the progress made by his company on the Hasa coast. He said that they had now decided to commence drilling operations, probably early in January, at Dammam, a point on the main land opposite to Bahrein, about half-way between Jebel Dhahran and Qatif. Whilst this was the only place at which they proposed to drill at present, their geologists were busy pursuing their examination of the area of the concession. Ihey were working in four parties, and were now, he understood, in northern Hasa in the neighbourhood of As Saffa. They were making good use of their aeroplane, which they had found invaluable. 2. Mr. Lenahan proceeded to say that they had also come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Saudi authorities over the use of wireless telegraphy. He quoted that part of article 19 of their concession, which confers on the company the right to use “all means of communication,” and added that he had experienced considerable difficulty in persuading the Saudi Arab Government to see eye to eye with them in the interpretation of this. Now that this difficulty had been overcome, they proposed to make full use of wireless telegraphy in their operations. Jubail would be their centre in Hasa, and I understood him to say that other points in the field of their concession, where their representatives were at work, would be suitably equipped. He appeared to consider it possible that his office in Jedda would, in time if not in the near future, be similarly furnished. I alluded to the expert staff he would require if he were to have a transmitting set here, to which he replied that he thought the apparatus would be of a comparatively simple type. These wireless sets were now being made, specially for his company, in the United States. 3.

These territories were transferred by Persia to Turkey in the frontier delimitation of 1914, as provided in the Pour Power Protocol of 1913. ; reduction is at present confined to the Iraqi sector of the Naft-i^ihah field, which applies the Alwar%d Refinery near ihanaqin. Product ion, however, will by the end of ia36 probably be obtained from the ] ersian sector also, where productive conditions have been proved, and transported through a w na l? pipeline to a refinexy to be built at lezmanahah* Persia, frda time to time, has professed not to reoognize the frontier delimitation of 1914, on the grounds of its non-ratification by the 1 ersian Parliament, and may therefore be assumed to claim possession of the Iraqi sector of the Naft-i-bhah oil field.

'fhe only pipelines at present in o;^ration are those octmecrfcing the main fields with Abadan, but the company owns oonoesaians frast ersia mutiiorising the oanstruotion of a pipe-line from the Kaft-i-Ghah field to Abadan, and from Iraq pexsaitting oil to be piped from the same field to the Mediterranean. Agreements with the Transjordan and WLestine Governments were oonoluded in 1935 granting the A.P.G.C. ocnoessions to build a pipeline througti these oountrles to the Mediterranean in Acre B^r, and in return for the oonoesaloa the Company has guaranteed that for a period of ten years any oil pmspod from the Transferred Territories field (Naft-iKihah) through ary other oaapwy ? s pipe-line (i.e. probably the I.P.C. pipe line) will be pumped through Transjordan to a Palestine port (Haifa). '1th regard to the likelihood of the A.P.O.Q. making use of the ®bove concessions, it sernas extremely doubtful at present whether the oil-fields of the Ilaft-i-Chah area will produce a sufflolent surplus of oil, after supplying Horth-I&amp;at ieraia and Iraq, to warrant the expense of building a pipe-line to the Mediterranean. hould the promotion be sufficient, the avoidance of the Sues Canal dues would undoubtedly be a big factor in helping the Company to come to any decision. They might, of course, use the I.P.C. pipe-line to convey their oil to the Mediterranean, but this would not be feasible if the I.P.C. were already pumping to the full capacity of the pipe. II. XHAQ.

Mr. Millard of the American Embassy came to see me this riioming on this subject, ana said that a report had reached the state Department that H.k. Government haa reached an agreement with Ibn 3aud by which the latter formally recognised the validity of the frontiers in south-eastern Arabia established by tne Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913/14. The state Department would be glaa of any information as to whether this were the case. 2. I explained to Mr. All lard that the position was still as it had been described to the United States Government last summer (see E £481 and E 4327), and as I had myself explained it to Mr. Loomis on the £0th July (£ 4784/2369/91). The ooundary line agreed upon with the Ottoman Government in 1913 and 1914 was still internationally legally valid, since Saudi Arabia was one of the Succession States of the Ottoman Empire, ana was therefore bound by the same frontiers, mere they bounded its territory, unless some new frontier were established by a new ana formal agreement. We had made the position perfectly clear to Ton 3&amp;ua and to the United States Government, and as this position was the legal position in international Law it was unnecessary that Ton Saud should formally recognise it. In po^nt of fact Ion Saud had raised certain o eject ions to our attitude, as he maintained that he iiau authoriuy over certain orioes extending to the eastof the blue and violet lines. But this aid not affect the legal position.3. I asked It* Lallara wiiether tnis enquiry was concerned with the 3audi concession to the standard Oil Company of California. He rep lieu that it was, as it might affect the Company if there were any question of moving the eastern frontier of Ihn saud's dominions a few miles to the east or the west. I repeated that I haa explained trie position quite clearly to lx* Loomis, ana tnat, while Ihn 3aua was perfectly free to grant any concession he liked within his dominions as hounded hy tne Anglo-Turkish Convention lines, he had no rights whatever to grant any concessions to the east of tnose lines. Lr. millard said that this seemed clear and reasonable enough, ana tnat he would report accordingly. He said that Ivir. Loomis had left England immediately after seeing me on the LOth July ana had not reported the result of his talk with me to the American Embassy. 4. as it is possible that we may yet reach some agreement with Ibn 3aud providing for some modification of the blue and violet lines, I thought it well to tell hr. Lillard before he left tnat, while the legal position was as I had described, tne possibility was not excluded of some snail modification in the line being maae later on by mutual agreement, to provide better local tribal conditions etc. Nothing of the sort had, however, yet been done.

Memorandum of discussion at the India Office on 26th Octoher, 1934, between Mr.Fraser of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Mr.Malton and Mr .Laithwaite, Mr. Fraser called at the India Office on the 26th October to make a communication regarding the fufure of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's concession in BaMrein. He said that for some months past very tentative and confidential discussions had been proceeding between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil of California in regard to this concession. It appeared that the discussions were suggested consequent on the difficulty which the Bahrein Petroleum Company was experiencing in finding a market for its oil and the anxiety, on the other hand, of the I.P.C. to eliminate American interests from an area in which they regarded them as having no right to operate and to meet the threat which a very large production by those interests would constitute in the market. 2. In the course of the last few days the Chairman of the Standard Oil had at last intimated that he was prepared to come to London (arriving at the beginning of November) in order to examine the possibilities of some arrangement with the I.P.C. more closely. He had given an estimate of the potential productive capacity of Bahrein w/hich the I.P.C. regarded as optimistic. In view, however, of the relevance of this point to the nature of any arrangement to be concluded they had thought it desirable to accept an offer of the Standard Oil to allow representatives of the I.P.C. to visit Bahrein/2 20^ Bahrein and verify the position. Three representatives of the principal negotiating groups had accordingly been despatched for this purpose by aeroplane. A fev; days in Bahrein would suffice for the purpose of their investigations. They would return by air, so that the result of their investigations could be available before the arrival of the Chairman of the Standard Oil. Mr. Fraser mentioned at this point that the French interests in the I.P.C. which w/ere not directly associated with the present negotiations were very suspicious of the negotiations which were proceeding, and that on learning that a visit of investigation to Bahrein was contemplated, a representative of the French group serving in Iraq had on his own responsibility at once proceeded to Bahrein by air independently. 3. Mr. Fraser emphasised that matters were still at a very early stage and that it was impossible to forecast until the discussions had proceeded further what, if any, arrangement could be reached between the Standard Oil and the I.P.C. He did, however, indicate that no transaction was likely to be entirely satisfactory to the I.P.C. which did not result in the elimination of the Standard Oil from Hasa as well as from Bahrein - in a word, in the exclusion of independent operation by the Standard Oil from the Gulf Sheikhdoms and Ibn Saud’s territory^ and that the I.P.C. were anxious to secure as a minimum a 50 per cent, interest in the operations of the Standard Oil and its subsidiary companies in this area. Various possibilities were a deal about markets, the effect of which would be to give the Bahrein Petroleum Company some share in markets at present closed to them in return for some understanding as to volume of production; the buying out of the Bahrein Petroleum Company altogether; joint operation/3 operation; or an arrangement under which the position in Bahrein remained unchanged, hut the I.P.C. in return for marketing concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company secured counter concessions from the Standard Oil in respect of the Hasa area. 4* The embarrassing nature of the situation which had been created by the failure of the I.P.C. to give earlier information to the India Office as to their negotiations and by the despatch without warning of representatives to Bahrein was pointed out to Mr.Fraser. The effect of this visit on die Sheikh might well be very unfortunate and might react prejudicially on his attitude towards any arrangement to which the Company might at a later stage wish to secure his approval. Mr.Fraser expressed extreme regret that any misunderstanding should have arisen. He was, he said, most anxious for patriotic reasons to re-establish British influence in this area, and he had hoped that this would be one result of the present discussions. He undertook to give the fullest possible information to the India Office as to the course of the negotiations between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil, on the understanding that it would be regarded as confidential. 5. After further discussion it was agreed that the Political Resident should at once be given confidentially full information as to the position in reply to his telegram of 26th October, No.907; but that, in the event of the Sheikh asking for an explanation of the visit of the representatives, it would be better, particularly having regard to the very early stage which the negotiations had reached, and to the difficulty of forecasting their outcome, that he should be informed that we understood that certain groups of the I.P.C. interested in marketing in the Far East were contemplating tentative discussions with the Standard Oil which might affect/I J 4 * affect the disposal of the output of oil at Bahrein, and that they had been anxious, with a view to these discussions, to form their own impressions as to potential production in the area covered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession,.

Brief Summary of the Oil Situation in th e Middle E a st, September, 1934. !• PERSIA * (a) ANGLJ-PSRSIAN OIL C OMPANY, chairman - Sir John Cadman* Capital - £^6,5 ju,000• The British Government holds a controlling interest in the A.P,0*C* and appoints two directors who have certain rights of veto concerning policy, (b) Concession. Valid until 51st December, 1993, gives exclusive oil rights in South-West Persia, initially over an area of 200,000 square miles, after 1st January, 1939, over 100,000 square miles. Fields . The main producing fields are near Masjid- i-3ulaiman and Haft Khel in the province of Khuzistan. Another field is in process of development by two subsidiary companies (Khanaqin and Kermanshah Oil Companies) is situated near Naft Khana (recently renamed Naft-i-Shah) south of Khanaqin, and lies astride the Perso-Iraq frontier. The Iraqi sector of this field, and the possible field a few miles farther north at Chia Surkh are comprised in what are generally termed the 'Transferred Territories'. These territories were transferred by Persia to Turkey in the frontier delimit ation of 1914, as provided in the Four Power Protocol of 1913. Production is at present confined to the Iraqi sector of the Naft-i-Shah field, which supplies the Alwand Refinery near Khanaqin. Production, however, will by the end of 1936 probably be obtained from the Persian sector also/- 2 - also, where productive conditions have been proved, and transported through a small pipeline to a refinery to be built at Kermanshah. Persia, from time to time, has professed not to recognize the frontier delimitation of 1914, on the grounds of its non-ratification by the Persian Parliament, and may therefore be assumed to claim possession of the Iraqi sector of the Naft-i-Shah oil field. Oil produced in the Iraqi sector and refined at Alwand would, nevertheless, be subject to import duties into Persia as oil of foreign origin, and it has in the past proved more economical to supply North-West Persia from Abadan with oil products of Persian origin. (d) Pipe-lines « The only pipe-lines at present in operation are those connecting the main fields with Abadan, but the Company owns concessions from Persia authorising the construction of a pipe-line from the Naft-i-Shah field to Abadan, and from Iraq permitting oil to be piped from the same field to the Mediterranean. Agreements with the Transjordan and Palestine Governments were concluded in 1933 granting the A.P.O.C. concessions to build a pipeline through these countries to the Mediterranean in Acre Bay, and in return for the concession the Company has guaranteed that for a period of ten years any oil pumped from the Transferred Territories field (Naft-i-Shah) through any other company’s pipe-line (i.e. probably the I.P.C. pipe-line) will be pumped through Transjordan to a Palestine port (Haifa), With regard to the likelihood of the A.P.O.C. making use of the above concessions, it seems extremely doubtful at present whether the oil-fields of the Naft/Naft-i-Shah area will produce a sufficient surplus of oil, after supplying North-East Persia and Iraq, to warrant the expense of building a pipe-line to the Mediterranean. Should the production be sufficient, the avoidance of the Suez Canal dues would undoubtedly be a big factor in helping the Company to come to any decision. They might, of course, use the I.P.C. pipe-line to convey their oil to the Mediterranean, but this would not be feasible if the I.P.C. were already pumping to the full capacity of the pipe. 11 IRAQ. IRAQ PETROLEUM COMPANY. Chairman - Sir John Cadraan.

A pipe-line of 4,000,000 tons annual throughput capacity has been constructed from Kirkuk in the oil field to Haditha on the Euphrates; thence one branch runs through French Syria to Tripoli and a second through Transjordan and Palestine to Haifa; the I.P.C. undertook that tie capacity of the latter branch should be-4- at_least 50/o of the total capacity of the whole system until a total capacity of 8 , 000,000 tons has been reached. It should be noted that this refers to the capacity of the pipe-line only and that the I. P.0, have not undertaken to produce any specific quantity of oil at Haifa, The construction of the pipe-line was virtually completed by July 1934 and the first oil was pumped through to Tripoli, It is hoped that oil will be pumped through the Southern Branch to Haifa in September or October 1934.

(i) Capital . Present capital only £8^,500, which originally was held approximately as follows:- British 51 German 12$ Italian 25$ Franco-Swiss 12% (ii) Concession. This company formed in 1928, acquired from the Iraq Government in April, 1932, a concession for 75 years over oil-bearing properties on the 'fest Bank of the River Tigris. The area is 2CQ square miles. — . )lin -1,—1» The/The Company’s concession provides that it is to remain British, but it is believed that most of the financial backing which will eventually be required for development will be Italian and that the present shareholders' proportion will thus be modified. The company has to pay £100,000 (gold) per annum 'dead rent' increasing by £25,ouO per annum until oil is exported commercially, from when a royalty has to be paid. A company called Mosul Oilfields, Ltd., was formed to operate the concession obtained by the B.O.J., managing director is Lord Cflenconner. The company has paid one instalment of its 'dead rent', but were unable to find the money to pay the 1934 instalment until the Italian group agreed to find the extra funds. The consideration obtained by this group for providing the required sum is understood to be the transference to themselves from the British and French groups of additional shares and voting power in the company, which has thereby given them the largest international holding in the company. The distribution of shares now seems to be as follows:-* British group German group 12% Italian group 46,1 (iii) Wells . The company has not struck oil as yet, and does not expect to do so above 900 feet. Three wells have been sunk which have reached depths' between 600 and 900 feet. (iv) Pipe-line. The company has the right to construct a pipe-line to the Mediterranean and to choose the terminals. The fear that Italian influence might be exerted to delay the entrance of Iraq into the League of Nations prevented our pressing Iraq to insist on the Haifa terminalIf the Company decides to build a pipeline,, its Italian and German constituents wish to take it to Alexandretta, through what is, potentially, one of the most disturbed areas in the Middle East. But the ultimate interest of the Mosul Oilfields Company, the operating Company, would seem to lie in securing an agreement with the I.P*C. to use their pipe-line to Haifa which can always be duplicated if the traffic warrants it. (c) Refining. Admiralty policy has been directed to secure that as much oil as possible shall be pumped to Haifa in order that refining and port facilities shall be developed there rather than at Tripoli. It has been reported that some of the interested companies may refine their portion of the oil at Haifa, but the French share of the oil produced will be shipped from Tripoli as crude oil, to be refined in France. I!! THE ARABIAN LITTORAL OF TH.S PERSIAN GULF. (a) Oil Policy in the Gulf. We have treaty agreements with the Sheikhs on the Arabian shore not to grant oil concessions without our permission. The Admiralty regard the development of this area by British companies essential for strategic x '^) f reasons. The Foreign Office, however, press for an ' ;A - open door policy. Admiralty policy is to use every opportunity to influence the advice to be given by H.M. Government to the Sheikhs in favour of a genuine British Company; and if a concession has to be given to a company not confined to/to British interests, to secure the insertion of certain safeguards for British interests (already agreed to in principle by H.M. Government), including the right of pre-emption in war, refining a certain proportion in British controlled territory, the use of plant which can produce fuel oil suitable for Admiralty requirements, and the employment of a proportion of British subjects. (b) It seems probable that the oil-bearing structure on the eastern side of the Gulf extends to the western shores, running under the Gulf itself. Golour is lent to this theory by the fact that the Bahrein Petroleum company recently struck oil in promising quantity at Bahrein and by the result of exploratory bores at Koweit. In the past the A.P.O*G. surveyed Koweit, Qatar and other places on the Arab littoral without obtaining sufficiently satisfactory results to justify further expenditure, but more recent drillings elsewhere have caused them to review their interest in the whole region. (c) Bahrein. The Eastern and General Syndicate, (a concession purchasing concern), originally obtained a concession to exploit the oil resources of Bahrein from the Sheikh of Bahrein, but sold their concession (subject to a royalty of l/- per ton on production exceeding 750 tons a day) to the Standard oil Company of California. The latter company transferred the ^connjcession to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a wholly owned subsidiary formed in Canada as a British Dominion. Persia has from time to time laid claim to Bahrein, of which she was last in possession about 1783, and has recently appealed to the League of Nations on the subject/- 8 - subject* Persia oonsequently denies the competence of the Sheikh of Bahrein to grant any concession in Bahrein, but this claim has never been accepted, and on a similar basis of former possession it might appear that Persia could put forward a better claim to the Baku oil fields, since it was only about 1805 that she finally lost Baku to Russia. Some 13 wells have been drilled (July 1934) with varying results. It has been reported that the total delivery of four of the flowing wells to storage tanks which have been constructed at Sattra, a small island just off the East Coast of Bahrein, is some 4,500 barrels (say 650 tons) a day, and that the capacity of the three tanks already erected is some 250,000 barrels. A pipe line has been constructed to a deep water anchorage west of Syfttra Island, and an initial cargo of crude oil has been dispatched to California. It is not intended at present to construct a refinery at Bahrein. (d) Kbweit . For some years both the A.P.O.C. and the Eastern and General Syndicate (acting on behalf of the Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania) have been trying to obtain a concession for Koweit proper. Early in 1934 they agreed to form the Koweit Oil Company Ltd., on a 50/50 basis, and through that Company to endeavour to obtain a concession. Negotiations by Mr. Chisholm and Major Holmes on behalf of the Combine were suspended for the summer of 1934 and are likely to be resumed after the hot weather. The result should be satisfactory for Britain, as the control and management will, in practice, be largely British, and all political questions between the Sheikh and the Company will be dealt with through the British Political/Political Agent, to whose advice the Company will defer• Finally, the agreement will ensure that the wishes of the British Government will be met as regards air facilities, harbour, wireless and telegraph developments. Pre-emption in time of war will be assured. (e) Koweit Neutral Zone. This Neutral Zone lies between Koweit and Hasa to the south, and in it Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kbweit have equal rights. Any concession in this area must therefore represent a grant by both rulers, but it is understood that the Standard Oil Company of California, when obtaining their hasa concession from Ibn Saud, obtained also definite options on his interest in the Neutral Zone. Furthermore, in this area the various groups, comprising the I.P.C., the British (A.P.G.C.), Dutch, French. American, and Mr. Gulbenkian, have agreed not to compete with one another for concessions. Ibn Saud is now reported to have granted to one Ydlibi, a British subject of Syrian origin, a preferential right to negotiate with him for any available concession in his territory, in discharge of a commercial debt due by Ibn Saud to him. On this basis Ydlibi, together with persons concerned in the Eastern and General Syndicate, has formed the Arabian- Development Syndicate with the primary object of obtaining a concession in the Neutral Zone. As a result of certain statements made by Ydlibi in London, Sir Andrew Ryan, H.M. Minister at Jeddah, addressed enquiries to Fuad Beg Hamza (the Saudi Deputy Foreign Minister), the replies to which showed that the I Saudi/Saudi Government had gone a long way towards accepting Ydlibi’s proposals, but have not formally committed themselves pending their acceptance by the Sheikh of Koweit. In view, however, of the various parties who appear to have interests in this area, it may be some time before any concession is obtained. Nothing whatever is known about the oil potentialities of this area. (f) Hasa . A concession for the province of Hasa was obtained from Ibn Saud in 1923 by the Eastern and General Syndicate through a Major Holmes. As the Syndicate was unable to % find a purchaser at an early date,, it failed to pay the cash due to Ibn Saud and the concession was forfeited. In 1933 the Standard Oil Company of California obtained a 60 years concession over an area the precise limits of which have never been disclosed, but which has been claimed by the Company to exceed 165,000 square miles. Nothing is known of the potential oil resources of this area, for which the Iraq Petroleum Company unsuccessfully competed. (g) j^atar. (i) Political. — II— I . I &lt; III HI ! ■ The peninsula of &lt;&lt;,atar lies between the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. The Southern boundary of Qatar has never been clearly defined, but it is probable that in the near future, negotiations will be undertaken with a view to fixing definitely the frontier in the area between Qatar and Saudi-Arabia. Qatar is ruled by a Sheikh who has little authority over the interior or the base of the peninsula, which areas are largely the nabitat of migratory bedouin^. who/who are to a great extent under the influence of Ibn Saud. The Sheikh is, therefore, somewhat afraid of taking any steps which might run counter to Ibn Saud's wishes• The Sheikh of Qatar is in special relations with which lay ;own that foreign relations are Great Britain’s concern and, inter alia, preclude him from granting an oil concession without their consent. (ii) Oil . The grant of an oil concession to a foreign company in any of the Arab Sheikhdoms whose foreign relations are, by treaty, the concern of H.M.G., would naturally cause embarrassment owing to the presence of a large colony of foreign nationals. This is particular ly so the case in Qatar owing to its inaccessibility and the political and geographical complications which exist on its southern frontier. H.M.G. have, therefore, decided that it is desirable, in principle, that any oil concession granted in Qatar should be retained in British hands. It is known that Ibn Saud has been trying to exert his influence with the Sheikh in order to persuade him to grant the concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, which wishes to extend the concession it already holds in Hasa into the adjoining territory of Qatar. The American Company is reliably reported to have indicated to the Sheikh that they would be prepared to give him 10% more than any offer made by the A.P.O.C. which has had since 1932 exclusive exploratory rights up till August, 1934, and these rights have lately been extended until April, 1935.- 12 - It may be noted that nothing whatever is known yet, of the oil possibilities of the Qatar Peninsula, but it is believed that, if oil does exist, it is more likely to be found in the interior. Conclusions. In view of the possibility of the Sheikh granting the concession to the American Company in conformity to Ibn Baud's wishes it has become necessary for H.M.G. to bring a certain amount of diplomatic pressure to bear on him to induce him to grant the concession to the A.P.O.C. But it appears that the inducement which would be most likely to turn the scale in favour of the A.P.O.C., is an undertaking by to grant the Sheikh protection against landward aggression. It is obvious, however, that, as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection, the southern boundary of Qatar must be delimited.P.Z. 6453/34. x Ucl Extract from Intelligence Report lTo.12 of 1S34 of the Political Agent, Behrain, for the period 16th to 30th September, 1934.

My dear Warner, Please refer to Ryan’s Confidential letter to you No* 77/81/3 of the 8th January last on the subject of the Standard Oil Company of California’s Hasa Concession. iiyan tells me, in a note from the Khedivial ship bearing him away on leave, that whilst at faif philby informed him that the Saudi Government had just encashed the £gold 20,000. twenty thousand pounds gold payable as second instalment of £gold 50,000. the initial loan. This makes a total of fifty thousand fgold 5,000. pounds gold loan ; and in addition, five thousand pounds gold was paid last year as annual rent. I suppose another £gold 5,000. five thousand pounds gold will soon be due. I will try and confirm all this discreetly. Last night the three Dutch bankers here scouted the idea that Ibn Sa’dd had obtained a secret indemnity from the Im&amp;m (of which, I understand, Philby is convinced), so that, ii true, this 'naft-geld” will be very welcome to repair the wasted sinews ana tissues of the Saudi Treasury.

'Warner, Esq., Foreign Office. ^=1v. 4./ COPY (E 4784/2369/91) A Conversation ^ith Mr. Loomis, Forei g n Trade Adviser of the Standard Oil Company of California. CfA At the request of the American Embassy, I saw Mr* Loomis today* 2. He first of all tried to sound me as to the Persian claim to Bahrein. I explained that there was absolutely no substance in the Persian claim, which was only based on very ancient history, and that, as far as we could see, it was being pressed chiefly for its 'nuisance value' in connexion with certain general negotiations which had long been proceeding between His Majesty’s Government and Persia. The Persians had indeed at one time offered to abandon the claim in return for special concessions in other matters, but this would have meant their 'getting something for nothing'. I told Mr. Loomis that I thought that his company need not take the claim very seriously, and he seemed quite prepared to accept this advice. 3. Mr. Loomis then raised the question of the 1913/14 boundary between Saudi-Arabia and the British sphere in South- East Arabia. He said that he hoped there would be no question of his Company encroaching on territory outside their concession. I explained to Mr. Loomis why we regarded this line as definitely binding in international law, and why it was necessary to maintain it as the legal basis for the division between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the British sphere in South-East Arabia on the other. He appeared to grasp the situation.r .X. 9 h , , i ) v.' X A ! '* ' ■ * J 4. Mr. Loomis also mentioned the ^Kaveit-neutral zone and repeated what he had already told Mr. Warner (see F* 3983). He added, however, that he saw no reason why the various oil interests concerned should not get together and reach some agreement. I said that this seemed to he an excellent plan, and I felt sure that Sir J # Cadman would consider any proposals which Mr. Loomis would like to talk over with him. My own impression was that the various companies concerned could probably help each other in various ways if they agreed* But I pointed out that there was already a strong United States interest in the I.P.C., in which the Gulf Oil of California already participate. 5. Mr. Loomis also asked me a good deal about Mr. Philby, about whom he seemed well informed, and told me a story about a tanker which his Company had sent from Bahrein to Japan, with a view to finding a market for Bahrein oil in the ^r East, where the Japanese purchasers of the oil had made difficulties about taking delivery in view of the Persian claim to Bahrein* 6. Mr. Loomis was most agreeable but I doubt whether he got much more information than he had already received from Mr. Warner as to our general attitude on the questions in which he is interested. On the other hand he struck me as genuinely anxious to prevent unnecessary A.nglo-American friction developing in oil matters in the Middle ?last. (Sgd) G.W.

Mr. Abbott stated that the United States Charge d f Affaires had received Sir John Simon*s note of the 16th February informing him that permission could not be granted i'or* this aeroplane to proceed to Hssa via Koweit and Bahrain and that Mr. Atherton understood the reasons for this refusal and did not wish to dispute it. The United States Government were however anxious that the aeroplane, which would shortly arrive in Saudi Arabia, should after its arrival there be able to fly to Bahrain in cases of urgent necessity, either in order to take to the American Mission Hospital in Bahrain any injured or sick employees of the Company who needed urgent treatment and could not be treated locally, or in order that any/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.

Mr. Abbott was at pains to point out that permission was only being sought for such flights in cases of real urgency falling under one of the two above headings; but, in view of the primitive conditions on the Hasa coast such emergencies might well arise, and it was desirable to provide for them in advance. 3. Sir John Simon will be glad to learn as soon as possible whether Sir Samuel Hoare sees any objection to granting the Company^ application. In his own opinion it would be difficult, in practice, to refuse the necessary permission in cases such as those outlined above and particularly in urgent cases of sickness or accident. He hopes, therefore, that the Company^ request may be favourably considered. 4. A similar letter is being addressed to the Air Ministry. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,$71 IXt) stp/aw.

The proposal with regard to both ~ the flight and the base, appears to me (a) unnecessary and (b) objectionable for various reasons. 2. With regard to (a). (l)* The aeroplane starting from ’Iraq territory and keeping outside the 3-mile-limit from the shore, can avoid flying over Kuwait territory* It can then proceed over Bin S. 44.

Bin Baud, who is the authority concerned, can make whatever arrangements are necessary for the flight. (s). I do not see why the aeroplane cannot he based on §,atif, Ojair, or Hofuf, where Bin Saud can make suitable arrangements. 3. With regard to (b). (1) . His Majesty’s Government have laid great stress on allowing no exceptions t o the rule that private aviators are not allowed to fly down the Arabian Coast, and once we make an exception in favour of this aeroplane, we will have to allow it for all aeroplanes. ( 2 ) . We have also laid stress on the same point when obtaining the necessary prohibition from the Shaildis concerned, #ii ch we have only just received, and the Shaikhs will certainly think it rather peculiar that we should suddenly turn round and ask them to go back on the orders which they have issued. ( 3 ) . It seems to me that to allow an other American Company to establish their base i&gt;n Bahrain is distinctly undesirable, and will lead to endless complica tions. Bor instance, having once got a footing of some sort on the Island for their aeroplane, the Company, if they find oil in Hasa, will probably proceed to make it a regular base and Head Office for all their operations. This will mean a large and further influx of Americans, which from the political point of view is undesirable, especialljr since - as the Company will be working on the mainland/-3' mainland and not on the Island - our means of controlling or influencing them ■will he small# With the Headquarters of two American Companies in Bahrain (The Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Standard Oil Company of California), -American interests on the Island will become extensive and may lead to a demand for American Consular representation in Bahrain which His Majesty’s Government are opposed to# In practice, it will be difficult to prevent the Company - once they are firmly established - from making flights to Qatar or along the m rucial Coast, and in the case of forced landings it is the British Naval, Air and Political Authorities who will have to render assistance# The fact that an American Company based in Bahrain will be working in Saudi Arabia will sooner or later create difficulties of some sort between us, the Bahrain Government, and Bin Sand. which I have received from him, says: 'This (i#e. the basing of the aeroplane on Bahrain) would, I think, be not unlikely to develop into a regular service.” We certainly do not want to encourage the development of an American air service between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia: if such a service ever develops it should, if possible, be in British hands.

Mr. Miller wants to land an aeroplane at T kihrain on its way to Masa and asked me what the position was about getting permission. I said that private aeroplanes were absolutely prohibited from landing in Bahrain and asked whether they could not fly direct to I T asa from Chat’bah instead of coming to Bahrain. I asked them to send me a letter putting their request in writing and explaining what was actually wanted. I said that the prohibition was primarily intended to keep ®ut individual fliers but that if the Company wished to land I should have to place their request before the Political Besident and obtain the views ©f the Shaikh. I asked them to let me have a letter in time to send it across by the mail of the 30th December. 7 specifically asked whether it was intended to use the plane for coming backwards and forwards between Bahrain and Hasa. Mr.Miller said that in cases of emergency or sickness they might wish to do so but that primarily it nould be used for exploration purposes. He later mentioned incidentally that they might wish to make Bahrain to some f extent a bse for their operations, which he added with a smile ’’might bring a little profit to Bahrain as well”, fhe machine is to be a Fairchild Ho.71”, though they did not know what H 0# 71 meant - probably some form of cabin machine. Mr. Miller asked about the position in Saudi Arabia and I said that the question of a plane entering Saudi Arabia was ore for 8e ttle. I asked whether the Company had got his permission and Mr. Miller said that /- 2 - that he underotood that it was heinp obtained. The plane will be shipped from Aneri ca as soon as permits have been arranged for its use. 3. Mr. Miller asked whether Mr. This sell had mentioned anything in the way about wireless corwnuni cat ion between ■^ahr^ n and flaudi Arabia stations. 1 said that he had asked me about it and *hat ? understood that the matter was under f consideration. I said that I had no official knowledge but that I thought th t the 8audi Arabia pe^ople had been in communication with the authorities at ’h»me. Mr. Miller srirtd emphasised the usefulness of the service and I agreed but said that so far as we were concerned the oosition was that the Saudi Arabia Stations ’’would not play”. In this connection I mentioned the ’Hanno’ forced landing at Jubai 1 • Mr. Miller is going to write to me on this subject also. 4* I asked Mr.Miller in what capacity he nronosed to write to me and he said that he was Acting Manager ef the ’’outfit”. He will probably sign himself as Geologi st-in- Charge as apparen+ly he has not yet received the full style of the new Comnany. Mr. Skinner emphasised that he had no connection with the Comnany’s business on the mainland(exceot that he naturally ass isted them in various ways when necessary). Id.

That the single aeroplane at present contemplated by the Standard Oil Company of California might develop into a regular service. (B) * Tha^ since the Standard Oil Company of California are already in some sense based on Bahrain, it would be difficult, in practice, to raise objections to their using the commercial facilities of the Island. (C) . 'That if we place difficulties in the way of the Company getting facilities at Bahrain, it nay encourage them to establish a mainland port.' (d) . 'It is true that the aeroplane now in question might be flown direct from 1 Iraq and be based for fuelling on some place on the Easa Coast, but if the Company/2 - **Company arrange to dump fuel (no doubt bou^it from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) on the Kasa Coast, there will he considerable incentive to Anglo-Persian Oil Company j to arrange for '''anker M Khuzistan M to call regularly at some mainland port (as she does now at ^atar), thereby depriving Bahrain of transit dues*” (E) # 'If the Standard Oil Company of California were to have a regular base here, it might make it feasible for us to exercise more influence over them than would be possible if they were working from a base where we ourselves had less influence* M 3 # (l)* With regard to (A) • Surely the last thing we want to do is to encourage a regular American air service from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia* If such a service ever develops it should be in British hands. (2) * With regard to (B). There is no question of objecting to the Standard Oil Company of California using the commercj al facilities of Bahrain, l.e. getting their supplies, etc* through the Island to the mainland, provided that they are not based on Bahrain* ( 3 ) * With regard to (C). If the Standard Oil Company of California find oil in Hasa, the advantages of having a port there at which their Tankers can call will be so graat that I imagine that they will try to develop such a port whether they have a base in Bahrain or not. ( 4 ) * With regard to (D). I presume that Loch refers to the fuel for the aeroplane, but this represents such a small amount that it will hardly affect the calls of t he 'Khuzi s tan M • ( 5 ) . with regard to (E). Ae pointed out In my/3- my Express Letter Ho.l3S-S of 7th February, paragraph 3 ( 3 ), we shall have very little influence over the Standard Oil Company of California, even if they have their base in Bahrain.

Dated 27th January 1934. Tour Express Letter 26-S of January 20th. While I appreciate objections *hioh you mention and should prefer in principle to have no foreign interests in Bahrain, there are certain local considerations of which T feel that you should be aware before coming to a decision. recently in conversation the possibility of the Standard Oil Company of California wishing to use an aeroplane from Bahrain. I gathered that, though it would be used chiefly for exploration, aeroplane might be used for carrying personnel in case of sickness or emergency. This would, X think, be not unlikely to develop into a regular service. He said incidentally that they might wish to use Bahrain to some extent as a base, which, he added, might bring a little profit to Bahrain as well. They hope too that wireless communication will be established between the Imperial and International Communications Company Limited and the Saudi Arab stations. I asked him why they did not fly direct (I gather that a safe landing ground, not too far off and in touch with civilization, is their immediate object) and also said that they would need to get the 2 Mr. Miller (Geologist-in-charge in Hasa) mentioned sanctior/sanction of the Sawdi Arab Government for flying in Saudi Arabia* H© said that he thought that arrangements were being made to get the permission of the Saudi Arab Govern ment for flying in Saudi Arabia and that he would write to me about the matter of Bahrain, but did not do so* 3. Stand ax'd Oil Company of California are already in some sense based on Bahrain as their personnel land at Bahrain en route to Hasa and their imports are either landed and re-exported from, or transhipped at, Bahrain, which is a source of profit to the Bahrain Government* The Bahrain Petroleum Company, though technically a separate Company, helps the Standard Oil Company of California by putting up their men and making various shipping and other arrangements for them. It would be difficult in practice to raise objections to the Standard Oil Company of California using the commercial facilities adt of Bahrain. 4* If we place difficulties in the way o f the Company getting facilities at Bahrain, it may encourage them to establish a mainland port. It is true that the aeroplane now in question might be flown direct from ’Iraq and be based for x* fuelling on some place on the Hasa Coast, but if the Company arrange to dump fuel (no doubt bought from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) on the Fasa Coast, there will be considerable incentive to Anglo-Persian Oil Company to arrange for anker H Khuxistan M to call regularly at some mainland port (as she does now at Q,atar), thereby depriving Bahrain of transit dues. If they had to make arrangements for the aeroplane, the/'37? 3- the Saudi Arab Go-Ternraent might he encouraged to arrange air facilities on their coast* This might he useful to us in the event of forced landings, hut might prove troublesome in other i»ays. 6. I do not think that Shaikh of Bahrain(or, indeed, others) would he surprised at being asked to make an exception in favour of the Company’s aeroplane, as it would have definite business purpose, which could not he achieved by flying down the Persian Coast. It would, of course, open the door to a srtnnilar request by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, hut I gather this request is likely to he made, sooner or later, in any case* In the eyes of the Shaikh of Bahrain the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Standard Oil Company of California are one Compary(as for practical purposes they are). 7* If the Standard Oil Company of California were to have a regular base here, it might make it feasible for us to exercise more influence over them than would he possible if they were working from a base where we ourselves had less influence. 8. On the other hand, it may be difficult to refuse them facilities at Kuwait (should we wish to do so), if they are given facilities here, and it may be expedient to remind the Company that they cannot have everything that they want on the Arab Littoral* On the information before me, I cannot offer any useful opinion on this aspect of the quest! on. sd.

With reference to your note No. 276 of the 3rd January, requesting permission for an earoplane belonging to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to fly oyer Palestine and the Arab principalities of Koweit and Bahrein on its way to Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to inform you that the necessary authorisation has been issued in Palestine and Transjordan for the aeroplane in question to fly over those territories and to land at Gaza. 2. In the case of Koweit and Bahrein, however, I regret to inform you that general regulations, made by the rulers of thoee two principalities, prohibit entirely all flights by civil aircraft except those of aviation companies which have received or may receive permission to include these places on regular flying services. A strict prohibition of this kind has been found necessary in view of local conditions; the utmost importance is attached to maintaining it intact and no exceptions are made even in the case of British aviators. I am however glad to think that the facilities sought by the company in respect of Koweit and Bahrein are not essential, since it should be possible for the company’s aircraft to reach Saudi Arabia from Basra without flying over Koweiti territory or territorial waters, and to proceed direct to some convenient place in Saudi territory where it is to operate, such/ f Ray Atherton, Esq., etc., etc. , etc. ,■| such as the island of Tanit, which ia included in its itineraiy as given in your note.

They have asked through the American Embassy for facilities for a single aeroplane to make a survey of their Hasa concession, flying from Basra via Koweit to Bahrein and, if no objection is seen, basing their aeroplane on Bahrein. They were warned that private flights were not allowed over either Bahrein or Koweit, but were told that the local authorities would be consulted. objecoion to the grant of these facilities and we accordingly gave the Government of India ana the Hesiuent a lean in the direction of agreeing to them.

Colonel Fowle, after consulting the Political Agents at Bahrein and Koweit is, for the reasons developed in detail in his telegram, opposed. While our original enquiry was addressed to the Government of India he has not repeated his telegram to them (they have sent him a reminder to-day) and in view of tne urgency, as the Embassy are pressing the Foreign Office, the Department wrote to the Foreign Office yesterday expressing general agreement with the Resident’s views, in particular as regards the base. 5. The Foreign Office, I gather, are mm Mlikely to come back, agreeing that the question of KL base need not be pursued, but pressing that we should give the Americans the facilities tney want for a single flight across Koweit and Banrein. There is, I think, much to be said for tne Resident’s view that in the interests of maintaining the prohibition we should give no facilities even for a single flight* There is a grave danger at the moment of the Americans establishing themselves in the north-west corner of the Gulf,(and theTewer special exceptions we make in their favour on principle the better. In the present case/3 case there is no reason why they shoula not ask: Ihn 3auci (to whose interest it is that the Hasa concession should he developed rapidly) to provide the necessary facilities in Hasa, or why they should not fly outsiue Koweit territorial waters and then land in Hasa under arrangements made locally with Ihn Saud’s approval.

Sir, i Itn reference to Air ^iniatry secret letter Ko.S 33834/S6 of the 19th January regarding the proposed air surrey by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company of the territory covered by their oil concession, I aa directed by Secretary Sir John Simon, to transmit to you, as requested, the following further information, regarding the concession. 2* In Jaly, 1933, the standard Oil Company of California o tained fro* King Ibn Saud an oil concession, covering the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia. The text of an agreement between the Saudi Government and the GOiapany was published in the official ‘Uasa-el-Qura’ 1 , of the 14th July, but certain important particulars, inducing the exact area covered by the concession, were ri °k specified in it and were apparently reserved for a second special agreement* which has not been made public. A translation of the published agreement is enclosed; a revised translation is at present being prepared and a copy will be communicate, to the Air Ministry as soon as it is available. it will be seen that Article 19 of this agreement contemplates the possibility of permission being granted to the Cofapany to employ aircraft within the limits of ^audi Arabia, subject to a separate agreement with the Saudi Government on this aubject. from the present application by the California Arabian Stanaard The Secretary of the Air Ministry Oil/Oil Company (which is no doubt a subsidiary of the Coiapany holding the concession) for permission to send out an aeroplane to K1 Hasa along the Arabian coast air route, it *ould appear that they have reached a settlement with the Saudi Government on this point. 3. The Secretary of State concurs in the view expressed by the Air Council that it is undesirable that the Company’s aircraft should be allowed to fly over watar ana the Trucial Coast. This point has also been raised by the India Office (see paragraph 2 of telegram ho. 102 of tne 12th January from the Secretary of State for India to the Government of India a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No.P.245/34 of the 16th January to the Foreign Office ana Air kinistry) and it will be borne in mind in replying to the United States Embassy. 4.

Cv 'IDENTIAL. | ~ “ / BRITISH' 'L3 GAT 10 N, JSDDA, SAUDI ARABIA. 12th Dec ember, 1933. ~y dear Earner, With reference to my letter to you No.3255/353/72 of the 28th November last, relative to the Hasa Oil Concession, I mentioned the matter of the unpublished annexure to the Standard Oil Company’s of California’s concession to Philby on the 6th December shortly after his return from Egypt. I found him quite helpful. He stated that although he did not possess a copy of the secret agreement, he was present in an unofficial but advisory capacity at the 'Cabinet” meeting that finally examined the concession, clause by clause and approved it. He had also something to do with the verification of the translation. He thought he could remember most of the Secret clauses and promised to look through his papers. He was then about to leave for Mecca and promised to let me know soon but he is again in ^ecca and it may be a week or two before X see him next. I give you hereunder, however, the points he mentioned to me off-hand in conversation, as forming part of the secret agreement i • Finanee . The £35,000 gold recently paid by the Company to the Government consisted of £5,0CC gold as rent and £30,000 gold as loan. (Comment: The missing sum in Article 3 is perhaps £30,000 gold and that in Article 4, £5,000 gold.) After a period of several months (I think 6), the C.F.A. Earner, Esq., Eastern Department, Foreign Office.the Company was to pay a further £20,000 gold, making £50,000. Upon oil being struck in paying quantities, the Company was to make a further loan of £50,000 gold - total £100,000 gold. Philby also stated he had an idea there was a provision for the payment of a further £50,000 gold at the end of two years. (Comment: There is no mention of this in the agreement; unless it all forms part of the sum mentioned in Article 3. The sum mentioned in Article 8 - £50,000 - one year after discovery, another £50,000 to be paid). 2. Aeroplanes . There is a clause permitting the Company to operate ’planes in Hasa. (Comment: Article 19) 3. Kuwait Neutral Zone, There is a clause on this subject which Philby thought, ran as follows: The Sa’bdi Arab Government promised to use their influence with the Sheykh of Kuwait to get him to agree with them to give the Company the concession for the whole of the area. In the event of this proving impossible, the Sa’Udi Arab Government would try to get the Sheykh to agree to making identical terms with the Company to- whom he (the Sheykh) eventually gave a concession in his sphere of this zone with the terms Ibn Sa’ftd made with the Standard Oil Company of California. The latter would therefore be at no disadvantage competitively. (Comment: No reference in concession.) 2. I hope that either Sir Andrew or I will be able to send you a fuller statement in the course of a few weeks. I undertook to treat anything that Philby mightmight tell me on this, or any other subject as given in strict confidence. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A.S. CALVERT. P.S. The comments in parentheses refer to the published concession, of course. (Intd.) A.S.Ctne £Otn October about tne iiasa oil concession, I send you the enclosed copy of a revised translation of the concession agreement which we have received from Jedda. We shall be printing this translation so soon as we have settled one doubtful point in it with tne Legation. In the meanwhile, you may like to nave tne enclosed typed copy for purposes of reference, since the translation is in many respects a great improvement on tnat which we sent you under cover of our official letter i vo ^ E 4699/487/2 5 of tne 20th September. Articles 11,13,14, and 16 are particularly improved.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 268j )f the 23rd August last, relative to the Hasa oil concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have the honour to inform you that an official of the company, Mr. W. J. Lenahan, arrived here as its Jedda representative on the 18th October. Mr. Lenahan, who has previously served his company in South America in an administrative rather than a practical capacity, has had no previous experience of this part of the world. In conversation with me recently he stated that five geologists, presumably Americans, had already arrived in Hasa and had been met by Mr. Twitched, who had assisted them in commencing their work. Mr. Lenahan added that more geologists were on their way and were shortly expected to arrive in Hasa. 2. It is understood that Mr. Twitched is returning to Jedda very shortly and that he expects to proceed on leave almost at once. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. [963 x—2]P.Z. 6992/33. (a) On one or two occasions lately His Excellency when discussing the Hassa Oil Concession recently given to the Standard Oil Company, has been strangely definite in his assertion that the King had not included the Kuwait Neutral Zone in the concession. (b) In referring to the Shaikh of Qatar's visit to Riath on 25th August, the Shaikh gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh of Qatar, who was under the thumb of Bin Saud, might easily be persuaded to try and cancel his agreement with the AngLo-Persian Oil Company, at the behest of the King. He further gave it as his opinion that actually the journey to Riath was not connected with oil, but with the loan of £10,000, which the Shaikh of Qatar had made to Bin Saud some time back. He had heard that the Shaikh of Qatar had stupidly reminded the King about repayment and this had greatly angered that monarch. Abdulla ibn Jaloui, his friend, had then secretly instructed the Shaikh of Qatar to come and make his peace, promising himself to act as go-between. Comment .

September 12, 1933. — .^CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 5330/487/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received Sevtember 12.) (No. 268.) L ' Sir, Jedda, August 23, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 235 of the 25th July last, relative to the terms of the Hasa Oil Concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have the honour to report that certain rumours which had been circulating in Jedda during the past few weeks regarding the payment of the first large sum as a loan to the Government proved in the main to be correct with the arrival on the 20th August of the sum of £35,000 gold in English sovereigns. The specie was not, however, landed here owing to some deficiency in the shipping documents, but remained on board the Khedivial steamer, the Talodi, and left with her again the same day for Port Sudan, whence she is due to return to-day. I understand that shipping arrangements were made in London through the Haines Line, by one of whose ships the money was brought to Suez, where it was transhipped into the Khedivial steamer for Jedda. The documents, instead of being sent to the Dutch bank here, who are charged with the handling of the money, were addressed to the local agent of the Blue Funnel Line, and were received by him too late for the £35,000 gold to be landed at the first visit. It will be landed to-day. 2. That this large sum of money, amounting to over £50,000 sterling at present rates, is only a loan has been confidently asserted by persons who claim to have received their information direct from those concerned on behalf of the company, and the repayment, it is further stated, is to be made gradually against the eventual royalties received by the Saudi Arab Government. This arrange ment, if correctly stated, would therefore be provided for in the “special agree ment,” the terms of which have not so far been disclosed. 3. Mr. K. Twitched, who, in the continued absence of Mr. Hamilton, repre sents the company here, states that he intends to leave Jedda about the 28th August for the Hasa coast by car. He has been away from the 1st August on a short tour of inspection, on behalf of the Saudi Government, of the old gold mines in the Hejaz, which it is believed are by no means “worked out,” and returned unannounced on the 14th August, to prepare for the arrival of the company’s consignment of specie to the Saudi Government. 4. It is stated here that active operations are contemplated by the Standard Oil Company of California within the next few weeks, and that oil mining gear is already well on its way to the Hasa coast by way of the Persian Gulf. 5.

Sir, Jedda, July 25, 1933. WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No. 108 of the 30th May last, relative to the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have the honour to inform you that the official announcement was made on the 10th July by Government decree published in a special supplement of the Umm-al-Qura of that date. The decree, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, appeared unaccompanied by the terms of the concession, but announced that an agreement would in fact shortly be published and alluded to a “ special agreement,” which was also to be brought into force. 2. The Umm-al-Qura duly published, in two instalments, in its issues of the 14th and 21st July, the terms of the concession, a document of thirty-three articles, a translation of which I enclose herewith. The concession is to come into force as from the 7th July, 1933, and active operations are contemplated before the end of September 1933. 3. From a brief study of the text, the absence of details in respect of the sums to be paid by the Company as a preliminary payment (article 3), as rent (article 4), and also the lack of information regarding the exact area to be exploited, are conspicuous, and in a number of other particulars the text is, perhaps not unintentionally, vague. The “ special agreement,” to which allusion is made in the decree, must therefore contain these interesting items of ' information, which the parties to the agreement intend, it would appear, should not be divulged. 4. A copy of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (Translation.)

It is understood, in any case, that this right d“ s no? inclul the eran? full light foi the sale of crude or refined products within the limits ol 1 fbt- undermentioned zone or in the interior of the Saudi Arab Kingdom Article 2. The zone which is subject to the full riMit rpfprrpH tn ^ agreement has already been agreed upon between the two contracting parties. IS Article 3. * C ° mpany s ^ aP grant to the Government during the period aereed nnnn in this agreement a preliminary loan (? payment) as already agreed Article 4. a J he C° m P an y shall pay to the Government annually an amount agreed noon sMlt t^TfadVa , e aCiI Ti: thlS m ^ be dehne'd asannLl^nfXh period provided for in arti 1 tFe year s ^ aP P a id within the pe lod piovided tor m article 15 of this agreement, and so long as this agreement is not cance ied the annual rent will be payable at the beginnifg of everfyTr as b^d^rt^ P u Ut ^ nt ° f0rce ’ and ifc ( annual ^nt) must immediatelv after thn d aS b e g ln . nm g of each year, provided that immediately after the discovery of oil in considerable commercial quantities no othei annual rents will be claimed or will be liable for payment.3 4 Article 5. Directly after the date on which this agreement comes into force the Oompany shall proceed with its plans together with other preparations for geological work and arrangements for work, so that it may make use of the cold weather which enables it to undertake effectual field work, and to carry out the clerical work and make reports, &amp;c., during the hot season. In any case, the field work should not be delayed more than the end of September 1933. Such work should be energetically and strenuously continued till the beginning of digging operations or up to the end of the agreement. Article 6. Within ninety days from the date on which digging operations start the Company shall leave or surrender to the Government the places (areas) of the allowed zone which the Company may decide are not needed for further work or for use in another form or manner in connexion with this project. The Company should also surrender to the Government from time to time during the period of this agreement other areas which the Company may decide are no onger required for inspection or investigation and for use for any purpose which may have connexion with this scheme. All the places (areas) which are given up by the Company will be released from the restrictions and conditions of this agreement, but the Company will have the permanent right to employ those areas for the purposes of transport and communications during the duration of this agreement, provided that this practice should have a slight connexion only with the other form or method in which these parts (areas) surrendered by the Company can be used. Article 7. The Company should begin with the operations of digging as soon as it (the Company) discovers the place suitable for the same, and, in any case, if the Company fails to proceed with the operations of digging within a period of three years as from the end of September 1933 (subject to the observation of the provisions of article 24 of this agreement), the Government may then terminate this agreement. Whenever the Company begins with the operations of digging, it should persevere with energy until it discovers oil in commercial quantities or until it terminates this agreement, and if the Company fails to give notice regarding the date on which oil is discovered, then the date to be fixed for this purpose will be counted as from the date on which the Company completed the digging of one well or wells, examines them and discovers that they can supply not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil daily and for a period of thirty days consecutively in conformity with the reliable practice observed in first-class oil fields. The operations of digging include the ordering of tools and other machines and their shipment to Saudi Arabia, and also include the preparation of roads, camps, buildings, fittings, transport, communications and fitting machines and other means for well-digging. Article 8. Immediately after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities the Company should give the Government the loan already agreed upon, and after one year another loan should be given to the Government. The date of paying the first loan will be the date on which oil is discovered in commercial quantities as provided for in this agreement, and the date of offering the second loan will be after one year from that date, and in both cases the Government will grant the Company a period of sixty days’ delay so as to enable it to pay the loan during that period. Article 9. As it has been agreed that the annual rent will be paid up to the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities, and as it has also been agreed that the annual rent should be paid in advance, therefore it is possible that the last payment of the annual rent before the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities may include a certain period after the date on which the oil is discovered, and if this extra period is equal to one-fifth of the year or more, the amount proportionate to that period will be considered as a loan due by the Government. [879 q—5] B 2Article 10. As soon as it becomes possible {i.e., the Company will be allowed a leasonable time for ordering additional tools and for their shipment to Saudi Aiabia to meet the additional work after the date of discovering oil m commercial quantities), the Company should continue digging, by means o wo iggmg machines, till it completes digging all over the fixed zone, m confoimi y wi v the practice observed in first-class oil-fields, or until this agreement expires. Article 11. The Company shall pay to the Government royalty on all crude oil drawn out or stored, and which runs or flows from the field storage, aftei deducting First: Water and other foreign substances. Second : Oil which will be required by the Company for its oidmaiy woik within Saudi Arabia. Third : Oil which will be required for the purpose of manufacturing quantities of benzine and kerosene, which will be supplied fiee to the Government every year in pursuance of article 16 of this agi cement. The amount of royalty on each ton net weight of crude oil will be {a) 4s. gold or its equivalent, or (b) in accordance with the choice which the Company may make at the time of payment of each instalment, 1 American dollar on each ton of crude oil, plus the difference in the rate of exchange in accordance with the average of the rates of exchange for the three months before the payment of the instalment. For instance, if the average rate of exchange is 1 dollar or 14 cents United States currency for each 4s. gold {i.e., that the value of £1 gold has become equivalent to 5 dollars and 70 cents), the amount of royalty on each ton net weight of crude oil will then be 1 dollar and 4 cents. Article 12. If the Company extracts, stores and sells any kind of mineral oil, it should pay to the Government a royalty equivalent to one-eighth of the revenue from sales. Nevertheless, it is understood that the Company is not bound to extract, store and sell any mineral oil, and it is also understood that the Company is not bound to pay any royalty in respect of the oil which will be used by the Company for its ordinary work, machines and other establishments in the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Article 13. The Government have the right, through representatives properly authorised on their behalf, to inspect during working hours the work carried out by the Company, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, and to check the quantities produced. The Company should keep correct accounts and measures of quantities of oil gained and stored and which run from the depot of the field, in accordance with the practice observed in the first-class oil-fields. Government representatives who are properly authorised have the right to check the said accounts at all convenient times. After the expiration of one half-year as from the date on which the oil is discovered in commercial quantities, the Company should submit to the Government a half-yearly account within a period of three months following the said half-year, and submit a statement showing the amount of royalty due to the Government for that half-year. The Govern ment should treat these accounts and statements as confidential, with the exception of figures which the Government may find it necessary to publish for certain financial purposes. The royalty which will be due to the Government should be paid at the end of each half-year, as from the date on which oil is discovered in commercial quantities, and such payment should be made within the period of the three months following that half-year. In the case of any dispute which may occur in respect of the amount of royalty due for a half-year, the Company should hand over to the Government within the fixed period that part of the rovalty which is not in dispute. The dispute which may arise between the two parties should be settled by them, and if they do not come to a settlement in this wav. then such dispute may be settled by means of arbitration provided for in this agreement. Any amount which will be decided after this settlement should be paid to the Government within sixty days, as from the date on which the decision is given.o Article 14. It is agreed that all gold payments provided for in this agreement, whether e\ aie gold pounds or shillings, will be reckoned on the basis of gold pounds, and in accordance with their weight and pureness at the time of payment. It is also agreed that payments may be made in American dollars or pounds sterling on the above-mentioned basis. It is also agreed that in case the payment of the loan and the rent for the first year is made in pounds sterling or American dollars, the late will then be calculated in accordance with the rate of exchange on the date of payment. Article 15. All payments provided for in this agreement and which ought to be paid to the Government should be paid to them direct or to their credit in whatever bank they may fix in writing. The Government have the right to change this bank from time to time provided that ley inform the Company of such action in writing, so as to enable the Company to have sufficient time to arrange for subsequent payment to the new bank It is agreed that the Government shall select this bank,' whether in Saudi Arabia, or m the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, provided that no bank be selected in Saudi Arabia, unless it has a correspondent in the United States of America, England or Holland, through whom the money can be remitted to Saudi Arabia, and if the Company pays in the proper way to the Government am payment through the bank or through the correspondent of the bank for the purpose of its transmission to Saudi Arabia, the Company will be then free of any risk m respect of such payment. It has been agreed that the first payment agreed upon (which is the preliminary loan and the rent of the first year) should be paid within a period of fifteen days as from the date on which this agreement t 01 ^ S /S t0 f° r ? e i° t , he COIT espondents of the Netherlands Trading Society of Jedda (Saudi Arabia) at .New York or London for its transmission and handing over to the Government against proper and correct receipt. The expenses incurred in this connexion will be charged to the Company. If this first pavment is not paid m gold it may be paid in pounds sterling at the rate of exchange at the time the Company pays the said payment to the correspondent of the bank. Article 16. .u ^ fter discover ing oil in commercial quantities within a reasonable period, the Company may choose a place in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of establishing a factory for manufacturing a sufficient quantity of petrol and kerosene to suffice the needs of the Government. It is understood that the requirements or needs of the Government will not include the sale of the same on their part inside or outside the country. ^ The Company should proceed to establish this factory after completing the necessary preliminary arrangements and after obtaining the approval of the Government regarding the place which the Company suggests.

Dear Warnar, In reply to your note of 21st Instant regarding the revised memorandum on Petroleum in Arabia, I enclose two copies, as requested, and also confirm our telephonic conversation yesterday in which I said we had already sent a copy to Laithwaite at the India Office. With regard to your suggestion as to inserting under &amp; (2) of tae memorandum a statement as to the distribution of the capital of Mosul Oilfields Limited, we agreed on the telephone to let the memorandum stand as It is. For your own confidential information, I may say that we were given to understand in May last that the allocation of capital in Mosul Oilfields was 52 per cent British and 48 per cent Foreign as in the case of the parent Britisn Oil Development Syndicate, and that the maintenance of that allocation depended on the ability to raise the British share of the money needed to carry tne Uompany through the next 12 months. With regard to the statement made at the top of page 5 of the memorandum that Mosul Oilfields Limited is not xnown at present to be interested in Sa*udi Arabia, you will no doubt since have seen Farrer , s note of the 11th August relative to the move madd by the German interests in the firm towards coming to an agreement with Ibn Saud for the exploitation of the oil resources of his country by Germans.

CONFIDENTIAL. 5856 i *1 1 w 'S J Section 1. [E 4540/487/25] No. 1. Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia (as revised by Petroleum Department.—(Received in Foreign Office, August 11, 1933.) (A)— Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. Twitchell’s survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, but this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey, ‘ Rift Valley conditions ’ ’ are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Koweit Neutral Zone. —It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) The Farsan Islands and A sir. —Interest in these islands and/or the mainland of Asir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Mokalla. —In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quite unfavourable. (5) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as unfavourable in 1925-26. (B) Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Bagdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Bagdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Slfper cent.; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and the Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia (excluding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories), except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq PetroleumCompany and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between the groups, entered into in 1928. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded the Sultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, but included Bahrein, and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee. On the admission of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows :— Percentage. Anglo-Persian Oil Company ... ... 23-75 Royal Dutch Shell ... ... ... 23-75 French Group ... ... ... 23-75 American Group( 1 ) ... ... ... 23-75 C. S. Gulbenkian ... ... ... 5 00 100-00 As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company mm only represents about 33J per cent. I he Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically a British company, as in article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and i emain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as well as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which UU ^ compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq Petroleum Company. Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Development Company and Mosul Oil-fields {Limited).—On the 20th April, 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq The concession is for a period of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40,000 square miles, comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and north of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming &amp; the British Oil Development Concession was passed and published in the Omdal Gazette on the 29th May, 1932.

The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its subsidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the “ Transferred Territories^”’ under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing for a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate. —This is a British company registered in August 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt. It has, at various times, acquired concessions in Bahrein and Arabia, but has never carried out any really effective work, its sole object being apparently to obtain concessions and traffic in them to other parties. The company at one time approached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of U.S.A.^ (see under (5) below). Its local representative is Major F. Holmes. (5) The Gulf Oil Corporation is a wholly American concern, working in the Near East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gulf Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, refining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as financiers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony-Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S.O., New Jersey, in the I.P.C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained an option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Concession, which the syndicate had secured in December 1925. Eventually, however, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presumably because the Gulf, as a member of the I. P.C., could not hold it. In 1929 it acquired from the Eastern and General4 Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Hasa, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Hasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the .r. • 4 ? f u (6) Standard Oil Company of California.—Mtev the break-up or the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent ^ including the above company. This company is one of the larges 01 companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged 111 producing, refining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. 1 e company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has 01 proper les in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At tunes, however there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, e Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Canadian Corporation has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full paiticu ars of which are not yet available.

The E.G.S came into the field fatei At ^beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home, sm?nested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C. whom His Majes y s Government considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or eaiher the two companies were in touch with each other with a view to sharing interests, and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretoce of breaking negotiations so that Ibn Saud might give the concession to E.G.S in ignorance of B the interest of A P.O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G.S. got the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Saud granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Maior Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell any part of the concession to A P O C and His Majesty’s Government thought of trying to induce Ibn Saud to cancel’ this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus rViP A P O C were left out in the cold. . ^ , ‘The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known but there ar indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Lo Thatand probably the actual concession, included inter aha, provision for the following :— . . (a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a qnpcified manner within nine months. . . (b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months.{c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection’’ in half-yearly pay ments, to begin sixty days after date. (d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,' but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, (a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.’’ The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone. —On the 17th May, 1924. an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, transferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be reinstated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memo randum concludes from a review of the known facts the “impression .... that Ibn Saud did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.' As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other “at least subject to forefeiture,” &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928, that it had “never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the sheikh and discussed the matter. The sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Saud gave the Hasa Concession proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the sheikh a draft draft joint concession in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Saud. About a year afterwards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then cancelled. Ever since the Sheikh of Koweit has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheik of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a 'part of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to Jiave obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became ot this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a concession6 for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn Saud. made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them. Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal, and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “ a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Govern ment ” to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D)— Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows : — (1) Northern Hejaz. —Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) A sir .—Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of influence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa. —After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Company (who sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is under stood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (gold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 55. per ton. (4) Qatar .—The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C.. secured an exclusive option from the sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral Zone .—The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Sand’s consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (6) Farsan Islands. —There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the iVnglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Department that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands. August 5, 1933. o7013 [879 1—1] b CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4540/487/25] No. 1. Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia (as revised by Petroleum Department.—(Received in Foreign Office, August 11, 1933.) (A) —Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Hejaz. —Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. Twitchell’s survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jed^a, but this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey, “ Rift Valley conditions ’ ’ are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Koiveit Neutral Zone .—It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) The Farsan Islands and A sir .—Interest in these islands and/or the mainland of Asir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Mokalla. —In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quite unfavourable. (5) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as. unfavourable in 1925-26. (B) Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Bagdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Bagdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 50 per cent.; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and the Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia (excluding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories), except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq PetroleumCompany and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between the groups, entered into in 1928. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded the Sultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, but included Bahrein, and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee. On the admission of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows :— Anglo-Persian Oil Company Percentage 23-75 Roval Dutch Shell 23-75 French Group 23-75 American Group( 1 ) 23-75 C. S. Gulbenkian 500 100-00 As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company now only represents about 33f per cent. The Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically'a British company, as in article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as well as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which could compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq^Petroleum Company. The Burmah Oil Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Development Company and Mosul Oil-fields (Limited). —On the 20th April, 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq. The concession is for a period of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40,000 square miles, comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and north of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming the British Oil Development Concession was passed and published in the Official Gazette on the 29th May, 1932. This is reckoned as the date of the commence ment of the concession. The company must be and remain a British company registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must be a British subject. There is, however, a large foreign interest in the company. The British Oil Develop ment Company was first registered in 1928 with a* nominal capital of £82,500, the original directors being Sir Edward Manville (chairman), Sir Edward Mountain (chairman of the Eagle Star and British Dominions Insurance Company) (Sir E. Mountain subsequently became chairman of the British Oil Development Company), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, W. R. Brown (representing Lord Inverforth), General Sir A. Mola (Italy), three representatives of the Italian Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, and E. C. Simmons (solicitor). At some stage, but when it actually occurred is not clear from the information available, German and Franco-Swiss interests were also included. (!) In 1932 the American shareholding in the American group (Near East Development Corporation) was held in the following proportions :— Percentage. ' Standard Oil Company of New Jersey .. ., .. .. 41 *. ■Standard Oil Company of New York (now the Socony-Vacuum Company) 41f Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania .. .. .. .. 16f3 The capital in 1931 was stated to be held in the following proportions : — British Italian German E ranco-Swiss Percentage. 52 24 12 12 100 In December 1932 a new company was formed, known as “ Mosul Oil-fields (Limited),” to acquire the shares in the British Oil Development Company and to carry on its operations. The company had a nominal capital of £1 million in £1 shares. In March 1933 the board of this company was reconstructed, and the Foreign Office was informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen {chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro’s Bank), W. R. Brown (director of British Union Oil Company), and Sir Alwin Dickinson (formerly the representative of the British Government on the British Phosphate Commission) as managing director. Italian directors (3) : Professor Alessandro Martelli, Gr. Uff. Arnaldo Petretti, and Gr. Uff. Vittorio Amoretti (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli). German directors (2) : Herr Thomas Brown and Herr M. Hirsehfeld. French director (1) : M. Paul Girod. Iraq Government director (1) : Jafar Pasha-el-Askeri; a total of thirteen. The company is not known to be at present interested in Saudi Arabia. (3) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company {A.P.O.C.). —See at (1) above as to A.P.O.C.’s participation in the I.P.C. and the restrictions imposed thereby. The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its subsidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the “ Transferred Territories ” under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing for a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate. —This is a British company registered in August 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt.

The company at one time approached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of U.S.A. (see under (5) below). Its local representative is Major F. Holmes. (5) The Gulf Oil Corporation is a wholly American concern, working in the Near East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gulf Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, refining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as financiers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony-Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S.O., New Jersey, in the I.P.C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit.

The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affecting Saudi A rabia.

There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharqieh (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitched and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petroleum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable (see under paragraph (A) (1)). (3) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla. —The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. (5) Hasa. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for prospecting rights only, to Ibn Saud in 1921. The E.G.S. came into the field later. At the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home, suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty’s Government considered to have a prior claim.

Cox That draft, and probably the actual concession, included inter alia, provision for the following :— (a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a specified manner within nine months. {b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months.5 {c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection” in half-yearly pay ments, to begin sixty days after date. (d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,” but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, {a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.” The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone.—On the 17th May, 1924. an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, transferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be reinstated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memo randum concludes from a review of the known facts the “impression .... that Ibn Saud did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.' As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other ‘ ‘ at least subject to forefeiture.” &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928, that it had “never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the sheikh and discussed the matter. The sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Saud gave the Hasa Concession proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the sheikh a draft draft joint concession in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the sheikh that he could sign the joint concession, the concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Saud. About a year afterwards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then cancelled. Ever since the Sheikh of Koweit has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheik of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a fart of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a concession6 for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn Saud. made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them, Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal, and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Govern ment ' to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D) —Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Hejaz. —Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) A sir. —Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of influence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa. —After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Company (who sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is under stood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (gold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 5 s. per ton. (4) Qatar. —The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C., secured an exclusive option from the sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral Zone .—The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes's primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Saud's consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty's Government. (6) Farsan Islands. —There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Department that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

My dear Warner, In reply to your letter of 29th June, enclosing a memorandum from Ryan on the position as regards oil concessions in Arabia, we have now gone through the memorandum, which although in many respects an excellent summary, goes into a good deal of past history which we are not in a position to checx. This applies particularly to the historical account of some of the old concessions in .Arabia. I thought it best to revise the memorandum instead of merely letting you have a note of errors and omissions, and I have put in an entirely new section for the and the B.O.D. I have cut out some of Ryan’s remarks about the past history of the Standard Oil Componiee in the United States which do not really seem to be of great importance in connection with Arabia. In revising the memorandum, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to limit it to Arabia, and have, therefore, refrained from giving more than passing references to localities such os Bahrein and Xoweit, which strictly speaking are outside the scope of the memorandum.

Sir, I liare tfee honour to refer to paragraph 13 of the Becord of a Meeting held at the Colonial Office on t he 3rd M ay 1933, to discuss various question;! relating to Oil in the Ferelan Gulf. 2. It was agreed at the Meeting that I should take sfcaps to discover what had actually happened in 1934 shen a Concession in the Meutral Zone was said to have been granted to the eastern and General yindicate Limited. X therefore asked Colonel Dickson to aeccrtadn the required Information from his records, and to seise a suitable opportunity of making a verbal enquiry from the &gt;haikh, without, however, suggesting to His Excellency that we were in doubt as to whether the Concession had lapsed. I enclose for your Information a copy of Colonel Dickson*a report.

As reported on P.2.3189/33 below, the Standard Oil Company of California have secured the Hasa oil concession. Sir A. Ryan’s telegram of 5th June reports an interesting move on the part of Ibn Saud, who has indicated that approaches have been nude to him by the Italians in respect of Asir and the Farsan Islands, and offers to give a British company the first opportunity to deal with possible oil prospects in that area. I understand from Lr. Rendel that |this telegram was communicated to Sir John Cadman, who is doubtful as to whether oil exists in commercial quantities, but who is going into the matter. 2/Sir A. Ryan*s telegram of 1st June is of general interest in connection with the grant of an oil concession for the Koweit Neutral Zone* It was understood that, con sequent on the recent interdepartmental discussions here at which Colonel Fowle was present, the Resident would make it clear to the Sheikh of Koweit in such manner as he thought Pest that we should expect to he fully consulted about any proposal for the grant by him of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral zone and that he must avoid committing himself in any way in advance of our approval. We have not yet, however, received a full report from the Resident of his conversations and do not know whether it proved possible to broach this subject.

Hamilton, representative of Standard Oil Company of California, left May 31st intending to proceed very leisurely to Londonu I have no knowledge of Swiss and Italian competitors mentioned on page 5 of enclosure to Eushirecdespatch No. 28 to Colonial Office. I had heard of possible non-British European competitors including I think French but only in vaguest terms. I think that in report quoted in preceding paragraph Dickson underestimates effect of King's dislike for Hr. holmes. It is increasingly probable that latter came here in April with primary object of securing Ibn Saud’s assent to concession in Koweit and neutral zone and found that there was nothing doing in that direction. He may also have discovered however that he was not persona grata for any purpose except apparently enlargement of field of competition for Ha§a concession. This might explain his rapid departure at the : mbiiieht when the King was expected to • visit Jedda within a few days.'* These considerations might have a bearing on the future developments in connection with Koweit and neutral zone concession if there is any foundation for Dickson 1 s surmise that Sheikh oi KoweitKoweit and Itn Gaud have been exchanging viewe about oil. The King perhaps hopes one day to reduce Koweit to position of his vessel. He night well wish therefore to influence Sheikh’s policy in the sense adverse to nnglo- Persian Oil Company but not necessarily favourable to Holmes, right he not prefer to see Standard California, who are already in Bahrein and have now got concession for Hasa coast, cut out all present candidates for Koweit and neutral zone including Eastern Gulf to which Holmes is committed in respect of these two areas? This is of course mere conjecture as I do not know whether Standard California would themselves wish to enter further areas in question.

Representative of Standard Oil Company, California, secured Rasa concession yesterday under an agreement which has to he ratified by both sides and will not be published until this has been done. Addressed to Foreign Office No, 108, repeated to Bushire No. 122..naiki; tnax oeVore • m^cie hie choice 'between his Majesty' 1 a Government Tor advice. The Shaikh had said that this had always been his intention, and that he would certainly uo so. Lieutenant -Colonel Fowls thoufdit that it was not hupoeeihle that the Shaikh might accept an oiler i’roro the Laetem end General Syndicate whic,:^ on the -aoe of it, wa© leee favourable than the Anglo-iereian offer. This would probably mean that the Shaikh was receiving a eeoret oommiooion from the ^yndioate # Whioh he would not have t#o pass on to his family. 3* in reply to a question Lieutenant^Colonel Sbwle expressed the view that, if the British offer wae clearly the better of tne two, we could certainly advi the Shaikh very otrcngly to accept it, and he would not lightly ignore such advice. toy* Parkinson asked whether definite advice in favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be advice on the merits of any proposal. T/e had in fact already done this in respect of the two original draft concessions, and it therefore seemed to follow that we should be justified in similarly giving advice on any new drafts which mi.vrt os submitted to the dl Mkh by the applicants for the concession. The difficulty, however, seemed to lie in the moment when such advice the two applicants, }\e nuct ref^r the new proposals to violating cur pledge if wo offered the br aikh genuine shouldshould be given. It would obviously be desirable to select a moment when two offers were in the field of which the Anglo-Pereian was definitely the better one. But by selecting any such moment to give the Sheikh advice or to suggest to him that he should ask tor it, we might easily be accused by the Americans of having, as it were, brought down the hammer prematurely, since the Americans would no doubt contend that they would have been ready to go one better than the Anglo-Per si an offer had they been given more time. Moreover, if the Shaikh accepted our advice and decided against the Americans, he would no doubt, in informing Major Holmes (who would inform the Americans) of his decision, try to father the responoibility for the decision on His Majesty’s Government so that some kind of protest from the Americans would probably be inevitable. 60 UYn Parkinson suggested that a copy of our letter to the Shaikh should be communicated to the United States Government. The letter would set out in clear terms why the British offer was thought to be the better, and would advise the Shaikh, in the interests of his Principality, t.o accept it. ? • Mr^ Hen del agreed that this might be done, and said that the Foreign Office had always had in mind that it might eventually be advisable if not to publish, at any rate to let the United States Government have the official correspondence on this subject. Mr. Star!in^ expressed some doubt as to whether such a course would really serve any useful purpose. The value of a concession had to be estimated from the technical as well as the financial point of view, and the Americans would probably find no difficulty in involving HisHis Majesty^ Government in teoHnical arguments as to the respective merits of the rival offers. He pointed out that the Petroleum Department had already examined eonoret proposals put forward hy the two competing Companies, and had found that* on balance, the British proposals offered the greater advantages to the Shaikh. 9. Mr* Hen del expressed the view that this was not a matter which could he taken to arbitration, or made the subject of legal proceedings.. All that could he required of us was that our action should he justifiable on general grounds of equity, ond should he within the framework of our pledge. In other words, if our advice to the Shaikh were ^jiven bona fide on the merits of the proposals put to him, mid if we could put up, if necessary, a reasonable defence to show that we had not violated our pledge., it would probably not be necessary to take any protests w© might receive from the Halted States Government too seriously. 10. Captain Moor e said that the Admiralty felt that, 30 long as our advice was genuinely given on the merits of the case, all legitimate pressure on the Shaikh might be used. 11. This brought up the question of when the limit of the present bargaining was likely to be reached. Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle suggested that the limit would be with the purses of the rivals. Mr* Handel entered a &lt;Mg_T!C^»ggg« ■w rr. caveat that to adopt any particular moment for tendering definite advice to the Shaikh one way or the other might be rex^resented as a violation of our pledge. 18. In the course of the discussion it ©merged that the Shaikh might possibly be waiting on events in Persia in connection with the Anglo-Fersian Oil dispute before comingcoming to a decision. IS. In reply to a question aa to the latest information regarding possible sharing arrangements between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Mellon Group, Lj^utenant^Colonel Fowle said that, so far as he knew, the suggestion was that, if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company secured the concession, an arrangement would be made for the sharing of the marketing and distributing side of the ooncern on a fifty-fifty basis. Mr. Starling said that this agreed with his information and he had ax so been informed by Sir John Cadman that the Anglo- Persian 0 ;.l Company were determined, if possible, to secure the concession. ^ a olonel Fowle suggested that it would facilitate dieouseion of the question if we knew what were Major Holmes* re-actions to the latest Angio-Persian of/car. Major Holmes had now returned to Kuwait, and the Shaikh would certainly by now have consulted him regarding the offer. He therefore thought that the Political Agent might be instructed to approach the Shaikh and ascertain the present position. The meeting concurred in this suggestion, and the terms of a telegram to the Acting Hesident in the Persian Gulf were agreed. A copy of this telegram as It issued is attached to this record, and it was arranged that a further meeting should be held on the 3rd of May, at which the position could be further considered in the X:p#it of any information received in the meantime from Acting Hesident. 15. Two other matters bearing on the oil position in Kuwait were discussed, namely;-- - ——(&amp;) Poaai'ble influence on the Shaikhs attitude oT^Efo e MooK^q^bji^ l y ^^^ar^ene j^ueeiions . Mr. Parki nson said lie presuiTiOd that nothing could ha said to the Shaikh to help matters until some definite conclusion on the part of His Majesty 1 s GoTernment could he communicated to him. Both questions were to he discussed in the near future* and it might then he possible to tell the Shaikh something definite which would help to remote Ms sens? e of cri ©ranee • L i eut en ant “Colonel X ? owXe a^eed that we must wait until we could report definite proposals cm the part of His Majesty 1 s Government« ^ j £H' &gt; . «s 4 T-*'^ ’ cj -rr-? «4 +. ^ r*. h 5 ^! r.''!

C5(7^ ✓ Major Holmes 1 residence in Bahrein. M£-»- ,I&gt;aithwaitQ drew attention to Condition C of the Agreement of the 12th of June I 93 O, and to Major Holnea 5 failure to conform with the terms of that Condition. The Question had been the subject of acrreaponi ence with Jdr. Ballantyne end the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite said tliat, in 1 he light of discussion with Colonel Powle, he thoughi it was for consideration whether the time hid nou come vhen His Majesty's Government should take notice of iSajor Holmes' activities and consider whether some aouicn should not be taken in the matter. He appeared to be the representative in the Gulf not only of the Bat rein Petroleum Company, but of the Eastern and General syndicate, and to spend muoh of his time a.fay from Bahrein conducting negotiations for oonoesaions in other parts of the Gulf. Everybody, he thought, was agreed tha; the wording of Condition C made it clear that Major Holmes ought to spend if not the whole at any rate tie bulk of the year, say ten months, in Bahrein, a t d while it might be said that he had not at present be -n absent from Bahrein at any time when he was needed, an instance had just occurred in which Major Holm' a had approached the Political Agent in regard to an axteision of the Company's prospecting licence, and, having asked for a reply within a certain period, had gone oJf elsewhere without leaving any address.

Thla, thongh poeelhly auoh inforaal oorreepondenoo had taken plaoe in the p&amp;at, was in fact a breach of the agreement vhioh made it oleor that all eomumloationa between the British Resident and the Shaikh met peas through the Political authorities. Be did not think that Major Holmes was regarded, either by the local British authorities in the Persian Gulf, or by the Departments concerned in London, as a particularly satisfactory IndlYldual* He mas under tie impression, too, that the Colonial Office had had reason to believe that Major Holmes was not entirely persona grata to the American Syndicate* He therefore ru^gueted ^ that Mr* Ballantyne might be told that Major Holmes 1 activities were not regarded with favour by Bis Majesty’s Government; that It was essential that a representative of the Company should be continually resident in Bahrein and that a suggestion might be made to Mr* Sall&amp;ntyne that another representative should be appointed in his plaoe. 17* Lieutenant-Cclone 1 Rowle said that he thought that either the Manager of the Baetem Bank, or of the Mesopotamia •Persia Corporation would probably make quite a satisfactory local representative of the Company. Both these persons were British subjects, 18. Mr. Blaxter pointed out that at the time that the Agreement of the 12th of June, 1950 , was under discussion with the Company, Major Holmes was looked uponupon with favour, and his appointment as tbs first local representative of the Company was, in faot, mads at the instance of His Majesty^ Government* The position had, of course, ohanged, but it would have to be remembered in dealing with Mr. Ballantyne that it was His Majesty’s Government, and not the Company, who wanted Major Holmes appointed. ^ Mr. Parkinson said that it would be necessary to explain to Mr. Ballantyne that his interpretation of Condition C was not accepted • i.e. it was not a one-sided arrangement as Mr. Ballantyne suggested, nor was it a sufficient answer that Major Holmes had been available (if this were the case) whenever the Bahrein authorities had happened to want him there. In view of Major Holmes’ activities during the last three years, and in particular his long absences from Bahrein, it might be desirable to raise at the same time the question of getting him replaced by some other more suitable person. But before deciding upon suoh action, Mr. Parkinson said that he thought the Colonial Office should get out a clear statement of the facts as to Major Holmes’ appointment etc. Mr. Laithwaite said that the India Office would be glad to assist in drawing up a statement.

I gather from very confidential conversation with PhiIby that position of oil negotiations is more or less oq follows:- ^ ^ has evolved demands even more onerous than those previously propounded by Minister for Foreign Affairs who was aiming primarily at getting iumn sum of £ 100,000 down and substantial annual payment. Hew demands are inspired by terns of Iraq concession. Main feature appears to be that Saudi government now wants not only lump sum down and annual Payments but promise of minimum royalty of £ 200,000 once commercial exploitation begins. 2. Iraq Petroleum Company reoreeentativea are confinln themselves for the moment to attempts to ascertain minimum te:; t which government will offer. They might rise to payment c lump sum and annual payment much lower than those demanded by Minister of Finance but not more. Philby shares my views th t they are unlikely to do business. 3. Representative of Standard Oil of California returned from bgypt on 9th April. He had offered before departure lu. sum and annual payment (group undec) to amount far short of demands of Minister of Finance. Principals are not icesn on any great increase in offers and he is so disgusted at latest Baud!/ P3audl proposa^e that he has T»efuaed to entertain them anu has also wltharawn hts oreTlous offer. 4. King sti ll has a Iots opinion of Holmes but accedes to his suggestion of a visit in order to enlarge field of competition. Holmes represents himself as being tied to • -'tandard oil of California only in respect of concessions alread, obtained in Persian Gulf and which you doubtless have full particulars. He tells Phllby that his iuv.ediate purpose is geii comment of Ibn Saud so far as he is most interested with Sheikh Koweit to concession in neutral zones and that he has a gentleman’s agreement with Standard Oil of California not to queer their nitch in Hssa provided that they leave him free hand In regard to neutral zone. ho nevertheless Holmes has evolved scheme for Hasa principle which would be to divide whole area into say sixteen blocks which might be taken up sectionally by it and eontributi &amp; proportionate payments approximating to demands of iiiniater of i-1 nanceo J^hilby thinks some such scheme might be acceptable uo goY&amp;rnmsnt but does not believe Holmes has at present serioua backing for it.

They are Mr. (? Major) longrigF, a nice fellow, who was I understand formerly in the •Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, and his assistant kr. Mudarrla, a young Syrian Moslem, educated at Oxford. Cairo gave them a sort of introduction to me by telegraphing to ask me to help over aeeo.miodation e.g. with Qellatly Hankey. I found that the Government had arranged for them to stay at our new hotel and left it at that. I explained that I had no official concern with him but was willing to help him with general information. I gave him a good deal and gleaned the following facts in return. 1. The *Iraq Petroleum Company have been in touch with Fafias v;ahba and the present visit is the outcome of conversations with him. 2. The idea of the •Iraq petroleum Company is that they might get rights in Haas, similar to those recently acquired in Qatar i.e. the right of prospecting for a limited The 'Iraq petroleum Company^ representatives I had a long talk with Longrigg on the 13th March time C•fmk» Warner, Esq., Foreign Office.time in return for a moderate periodical payment, e.g# monthly, but not to buy a pig in a poke by paying big money at this stage for the right of extracting problematic oil, 3* longrlgg seemed to know very little about the proceedings of Standard Oil of California and their representative here Mr. Hamilton, ^witchell 1 ** ally. He was curious to know whether I did. I was able to say truly that I know little or nothing but did not feel ftree to say what I believe to be the ease, namely that the Sa'ddi Government started by asking for a very large sum, too large for Standard Oil of California to agree to. 4. longrigg confirmed previous information of mine that Holmes is peraona Ingrata in Ibn Sard’s eyes. (I believe that this is because of the non-payment of certain dues claimed by the King when the former prospecting concession mentioned in the post script uni to my letter of February 28th. petered out.) 5. longrigg seemed to know very little about rhilby’s position in the natter. He asked me whether yhilbyV an old friend of his, would be a suitable person to take on a watching brief, when he himself left. I eaid yes, if Bhilby felt Tree to do it, but was guarded as to the possible commitments which might deter him. I said that Gellatly Hankey might also be suitable, if it were merely a question of a watching brief, not of cor-troversial business, in handling which their need for standing well with the Sa'tldi Government for general business purposes would hamper them. 6. I gathered frorii Longrirg, what you doubtleaa iaiow already, that the *Iraq petroleum Company and Anglo-xeraianare so closely associated that the Aaglo-Pereian idea of approaching Ihn Sa'ftd from the i'ereian Gulf aide :aerg©e in the preaent approach of the ‘Iraq ietroleuitt Company via Jedda* 7. The ‘Iraq letroleum Company are not bo far interested in oil on the Hed Sea side. So the stage is set, the dramatis personae being an avid khdullah Suleyman, who thiidcs of oil in Hasa as already a marketable commodity; Twitchell and Hamilton featuring Standard Oil of California; Longrigg and Mudarris, representing the ‘Iraq petroleum Company. 3o far as I can understand, Standard Oil of California is as independent as any of the old Standard group, which was formerly headed by standard Oil $©w Jersey but was broken up by the ioaorlean anti-truet legislation. I gather that the interest of Hew Jeraeay and other ^jaerican concerns in the ‘Iraq petroleum Company concession in ‘Iraq doee not stand in the way of rivalry in the present matter between ‘Iraq petroleum Company and Standard Oil of California. As regards the minor possible sersonapes mentioned at 5 above, I doubt very nuch whether Philby is definitely committed to any one but he has been seeing a fair amount of the two Americans and may be leaning that way. I do not think that Oellatly K&amp;nkey are at present concerned in any way, except that, as Shell agents they were told to do what they could for the ’Iraq petroleum Company’s representativee. It may amuse you to know that all the arsons naad above, except of course Abdullah Suleyman, at at ay wife’s re ception on the 13th Aarah; and that the repr^sent^tivee from abroad are all in the same hotel, a Govern-uent institution principally for high class pilgrims.

We have received instructions from our London Principals to approach His Majesty King Ibn Saud for an option over the Hasa territory similar in terms to that obtained by us in Qatar (vide our letter OM/811 of 1st September 1032). As this does not constitute a Concession, I trust we shall be in order in going ahead with whatever arrangements can be made to accomplish this. Chisholm was here recently and returned to Kuwait yesterday. I have asked him to consult Colonel Dickson as to whether Ibn Saud 1 a agent in Kuwait is a reliable and bona fide representative and if he is, to convey a message through him to Ibn C&amp;ud requesting the opportunity of an interview either with him personally or his accredited Representative. If this request met with a favourable reception we should send our small party (consisting X&gt;robably of Haji Willinmaon and another} to the place nominated by Ibn 3aud. It has occurred to us that it might be as well to work through Ibn Saud ! s Kuwait representative as we have reason to believe that his Bahrain Agent has air e ady Lieutenant Colonel T.C. .Fowl®, C.B., Political Resident and Consul-General, Bushire.already been approached by ?£ajor Holmes on behalf of his Syndicate. It may be, however, that his Agents in the two places are of the same family or firm and that our precautions will serve no useful purpose. I should however be most grateful to receive your advice on our best means of approach to this difficult problem and if you have any reason to consider some other initial moves would be more satisfactory perhaps you would kindly telegraph me on receipt of this letter.

Sir, With reference to the second paragraph of my despatch Uo.160 of the 31st March, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of Mr.Twitchell’s second report, dated January 9th, on the economic possibilities of this country. This report, which was communicated to me by the local agent of Huseyn al’Aweyni, deals, as anticipated, with Mr .Twitchell’s journey through Uejd and along the Hasa coast in December and January last. It suffers, even more than previous reports, from hastiness and superficiality, and contains little of interest beyond Mr.Twitchell»s recommendation of Has TanUra as a site for a new Hasa coast port, and his advice that the King should take no steps to develop his possible oil resources in the Hasa district in view of the present world over-production of oil, and in any case not until the borings at Bahrain have been proved. 2. I enclose also, for the sake of completeness, a copy of Mr. Twitchell’s somewhat testy letter to Ibn Sa’fld of February 27th covering his report No.3, which has already been forwarded to you in my despatch under reference. 3.

Trucial Coast. 6. It is impossible for any European to land and start on a journey of exploration in any of the Chiefships without the previous consent and support of this Residency. Probably the only non—official Europeans who have slept a night ashore on this coast in the last century are Medical American Missionaries and commercial or shipping Agents who have been recommended to the Residency Agent. None of such persons can at present obtain permission to live on the Coast. 7. The Residency can obtain the Shaikhs* consent to Geologists making excursions - say of 30 or 40 miles - into the interior 'in order to correlate the geology on the southern side of the Gulf with the known facts as to the geological conditions on he Persian side', but there is no livelihood at present oi any of the six chiefs issuing to any one an Exploration License in connection with a concession to bore for oil. 8. Mth regard to the Islands, which a re nearly all uninhabited, the position is different. As in the case ol Abu Musa and its red oxide concession, the Chief concerned will probably jump at any proposal for a concession. 9. Until the probable existence of oil in any part of the mountainous Ruus al Jabal has been discovered under the Muscat Government’s concession it does not seem likely that the minds of the Trucial Chiefs will be disturbed by proposals from either the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or the Eastern and General Syndicate, which is now installed at Bahrain.54110/1925 P.4385/25 TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident, Bushire (Sent 3.30p.m., 14th December 1925).

In any communications which maybe made AMERYWith reference to your letter of the 3rd November, No.47519/25, regarding the proposed despatch of a geological mission by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Qatar and the Trucial Coast, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he sees no objection to the course which Mr.Secretary Amery proposes to adopt in connection with the proposed visit to Qatar. With regard to the Trucial Coast, however, he feels some doubt as to how far it is necessary or desirable to consult or inform the petty rulers concerned, and /.ould suggest that this question should be left to be decided by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in consultati with the Government of India. On the point of procedure, it appears to His Lordship that sufficient grounds exist to justify the issue of instructions by Mr.Amery in respect of the Trucial Coast as well as oi Qatar. There is a close similarity between the objects oi this mission and of the geological survey which the Company desire to carry out in Kuwait (to which reference was made in your letter of the 10th November, No.49227/25). It is clear that in the former case, if not also in the latter, the principal object of the mission is to investigate the prospects of obtaining oil in the districts mentioned. The subject is therefore, or is likely to be, one of more than purely local interest, and in its relation to the general policy in regard to the oil-bearing resources of the Arabian Coast/ The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S. W. 1.rnmmmmm Coast of the Persian Gulf would appear to he the concern of His Majesty’s Government rather than of the Government of India. Apart from this consideration it appears desirable to avoid the administrative inconvenience of dividing what is in effect one question and issuing instructions from two separate sources upon the Resident’s telegram. Lord Birkenhead would accordingly prefer that Mr.Amery should give the Resident the necessary instructions in regard to the Trucial Coast as well as to Qatar. He will, however, if Mr.Amery should still think this desirable, request the Government of India to instruct the Political Resident, as far as the Irucial Coast is concerned, in the sense suggested above.

Sir, With reference to your letter No.P .5003 of the 22nd of January, 1924, I a ni directed my Mr. Secretary Amery to transmit to you, to be laid before the Earl of Birkenhead, the enclosed copy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company T s proposed mission to Qatar and the Trucial area. 2. Mr. Amery desires me to say at once that it would, in his opinion, be most undesirable to sanction the grant of permission for British geologists to visit the territories in question without first obtaining the permission ; of the Rulers concerned, or to attempt to disguise from these Rulers the real objects of t he intended journey. / '■ ,mT| 4 3 . As regards the Trucial coast, however, the matter appears to be one which is principally for Lord 3irkenhead T s decision. According to the information in Mr. Amery T s possession, the influence of Ibn Saud does not extend to the Trucial Oman, and as such decisions as may be reached in the present case are unlikely to re-act upon Arabian politics in general, or upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with Ibn Said in particular, Mr. Amery’s &lt; interest in the question's corfLned to its importance in regard ! to the oil resources of the area, and does not extend to the political aspect. In this connection I am to invite His Lordship’s reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Thomas’s despatch to the Resident of the 13 th of April, 1924, a copy of which accompanied the letter from this Department No. 46597/23 of the 19 th April, 1924 * So far as the commercial aspect is involved/ THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, INDIA OFFICE.( S ~7 I f iZ, involved, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have already received an assurance that their prior rights in these regions will be respected. Mr. Amery accordingly presumes that Lord Birkenhead will give Lieutenant Colonel Prideaux the necessary instructions regarding the Trucial area. 4. As regards Qatar, I am to refer to the letter from this Department L T o.3697/^4 of the 7^^ February, 1924 , which contained copies of letters to the oil Companies interested in the matter, stating that, on general political grounds, the Secretary of State did not regard the situation in this area as being, or, as likely in the near future to become, sufficiently clear to make it desirable that oil negotiations should be instituted. The reasons which led Mr. Thomas to adopt this attitude at the time were chiefly connected with the obscurity of the position of the Sheikh of Qatar vis a vis Ibn Saud, and he had reason to believe that the Sheikh might have accepted the latter T s over-lordship. Mr. Amery considers however, that this attitude cannot be maintained indefinitely in fairness either to the Sheikh, who was reported in I 923 to be willing to negotiate a concession, or to the Company, who are always in some danger from rival concerns, even though their priority of application has been officially accepted. The immediate difficulty is, however, that even were the Sheikh T s relations to Ibn Saud satisfactorily explained, it has hitherto been mutually agreed that Article YII of the Treaty between His Majesty T s Government and the Sheikh should remain in operation until further notice. This article provides for the admission of British subjects into Qatar for the purposes of trade, and for their protection while resident in/in that territory. While it is unlikely that the Sheikh would object to bringing this Article into operation to the limited extent necessary to cover the contemplated visit of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s geologist, it hag first to be decided whether it will be sufficient to negotiate xvith the Sheikh only, or necessary also to consult the Sultan of Ne jd. xxxxx X X X I am, etc ., (Sd.)

Your telegram dated 8 th December. ivy records shew tlm,t /jiglo Persian Oil Company only actually applied to prospect in Ibn Baud's territory Koweit (and) Bahrain ? Truceial coast and Gulf of Oman. But I know from rerrmrks of their representative at time that they contemplated prospecting over whole ..rab littoral; possibly they thought ^atar was inccaporated in Ibn Saud territory in fact it nearly is. I think their claim to have established precedence to prospect in . 4 atar may be admitted. I think that before either Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Sastem General enters into negotiations it would be advisable for either Political Agent at Bahrein or myself to visit Qatar and see what position is vis-a-vis Ion Saud. In view of Article VI of his treaty with us there seems to be no reason why we should acquies in any claim of his to have authority over .^atar or to claim that negotiations should be conducted through him unless Sheikh Abdulla has made some definite agreement with His Highness admitting latter's suzerainty If position in tnis respect satisfactory I see no reason why Sheikh Abdulla should not be approached to grant concession to Anglo Persian Oil Company, If he proved ,/illin &amp; to grant one no doubt he would agree to Article VII of treaty being brought into force at the same time; I do not tuink other two Articles are of any importance.

(Sent 3.30 p.m. 8th December, 1923) Your telegram of 21st September No.838 Qatar (1) Anglo-Persian having learnt of Eastern General’s application have now applied for concession to which they claim to have established prior claim in virtue of application made in their letter of 24th December, 1921, copy sent you in India Office letter of 30th June, 1921, Application in question only referred to Muscat Trucial Chiefs Bahrein Koweit and Nejd no specific mention being made of Qatar. Nevertheless on reconsideration I think it is clear that it was intended to cover whole Arab Littoral and it appears from your despatch of 8th September to Government of India and your telegram of 9th September 1921 to Muscat that you read it as doing so. In view of obvious intention of Snglo-Persian and similarity between treaty position of Qatar and Trucial chiefs I propose unless you have any objection to admit their claim. (2) May I assume that objections to Eastern General’s , ?21st application cited in your telegram of 22nd September apply equally to Anglo-Persian? Grant of concession in any case appears impracticabl while articles 7, 8 and 9 of 1916 Treaty with Qatar remain inoperative and I presume that present moment is not favourable for attempt to induce Sheikh to give effect to those articles.
