Julius Valerius standing in high relief within a temple facade. At his shoulder he is flanked by a Horus-hawk and a jackal (?). At his feet are an altar and a griffin. \r\n\r\nAt the base are four rows of Latin inscription giving the name and the boy\u2019s age at his death as three. The child is clad in Roman costume and wears the side-lock of youth. In his left hand is a bucket perhaps a type of situla. With his right hand he grasps a circular object which is perhaps an offering which is about to place on the small altar. He is probably intended to represent Horus. The griffin in the lower right corner seems to show Greek influence. While the stela is of a well-known type it is of special interest as an example showing the mingling of classical and Egyptian influences. Latin inscriptions are also none too common in Egypt. The background instead of being smooth and cut is hatched in a very crude way. Extensive but faint traces of bright red paint remain as the background.\r\nCondition: Edges considerably chipped. Paint gone. General condition good.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "14 3/16 x 10 1/16 x 2 3/16 in.
