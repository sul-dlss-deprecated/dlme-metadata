The top is carved with the three-dimensional representation of a cat facing the right with the head turned to the front. The workmanship is a little rough, but detailed. \r\n\r\nThis piece functioned as an individualized amulet of the Divine Consort Shepenwepet II, and was originally mounted or threaded. The image of a cat with kittens conveys the idea of fertility, renewal, and protection, and the name of Shepenwepet the individualization. The amulet should secure the divine status, royal authority of the \"Divine Consort,\" as well as her presence and renewal. It is possible that the amulet was created for the personal use of Shepenwepet, but it is also likely that it was given to a private person to guarantee her patronage. \r\n\r\nThe identification of the lying animal as a cat is possible by posture, content and comparision, but the round shapes of the ears are a litttle uncommon and seem more canine. Nevertheless, the attitude of the animal, and the context make identification as cat most likely.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/24458", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "25th-26th Dynasty", "Reign": "Shabako (715-700 BC), Psammetichus I (664-10 BC)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544563", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.48_Back_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_BackVwA_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_DetA_DD_face_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.48_VwA_DD_hieroglyp", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
