                           Vestalhas been dispatched to Bushire to acquire funds.William Bruce's title in the address of the letter is written as 'Resident at Bussora'. However, it is likely that this is a mistake and that it should read 'Resident at Bushire', as this is how he is typically addressed.Enclosed is a copy of a letter from William Newnham, Secretary to the Government, Bombay to Gideon Colquhoun, in charge of the Residency at Bussora, dated 2 November 1814. The letter instructs Mr Colquhoun to make arrangements with the Resident at Bushire for drawing funds from that treasury.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052054.0x000006#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
