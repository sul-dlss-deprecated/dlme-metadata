As Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad has furnished a written undertaking to abide by the Treaties and obligations KhJL , which iMive been previously accepted by the late Sheikh Said bin Hamad, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf recommends* and the Government of India agree, that His Majesty’s Government should now formally recognise Sheikh Khalid as Regent of Kalba during the minority of the minor Sheikh Hamad bin Said. Provided, therefore, that the Foreign Office and Admiralty (who are being consulted) also agree, it is submitted that the Resident’s proposals be accepted. Although the proposals imply recognition of Sheikh Hamad bin Said as Sheikh of Kalba, it is not proposed that specific recognition should be accorded at this stage. The time for that will come on the termination of the regency, when Sheikh Hamad will be in a position to give a personal undertaking to observe the Treaties and agreements. As a minor (he is 7 years of age) he cannot now give this undertaking, nor can Sheikh Khalid give it on his behalf. It is proposed to make this clear when replying to the Resident. Last year the late Sheikh was granted a perso nal salute of 3 guns (see submission at P.Z. 7725 / 36 , flagged similar salute should be granted to Sheikh Hamad and to Sheikh/2 . Sheikh Khalid while acting as Regent. The Government of India see no objection to the Resident*s proposals&gt; and provided that the Foreign Office and Admiralty also agree there seems no reason for us to raise objection. It will, however, be necessary to obtain His Majesty’s pleasure, and a draft submission is suggested. The matter is of some urgency as the Political Resident is anxious that a decision should be reached in order to enable him to visit Kalba during his forthcoming tour of the Trucial Coast. This tour will commence to-morrow and will end on the 8th December. ■ VDraft Paper P.Z. 7687/37 Department DRAFT SUBMISSION.

Ruler of Kalha, with whom His Majesty’s Government had entered into treaty relations in August, 1936, died at Khor Fakkan, a town within the Sheikhdom of Kalba. Shaikh Said left an only son aged seven years. Control of affairs was immediately undertaken on behalf of the minor Shaikh by Barut who had been the head slave and general factotum of the late Shaikh Said bin Hamad. intrigues following on the death of an Arab Shaikh, the minor Shaikh being left without a close male relative to take charge of affairs during his minority. The primerraovers were the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, who had at one time been Shaikh of Sharjah and was a relative by marriage of the late Shaikh Said bin Hamad of Kalba. The intrigues of the Shaikh of Has-al-Khaimah culminated in his abortive attempt to force the people of Kalba to elect him Shaikh in June, 1937, when he 2 On the 30th April, 1937, Shaikh Said bin Hamad 3. The Shaikhdom thus became exposed to the usual found/ His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India, The India Office, LONDON. S.W.I &amp;ecd. w . r r .rL 22NCV183£ INDIA OFFICE v- 2 - ■found himself isolated in Kalha and was 'brought away in . 'Shoreham*. A report of this proceeding was con- u-iM^tained in Sir Trenchard Towle’s telegrams Nos. 613 and 643 dated 24th and 29th June, 1937, respectively. Shaikh Khalid made a preliminary attempt to enter Kalha territory, hut on the first occasion he found himself unacceptable to the people and returned to Dhaid without endeavouring to advance his claims hy force. 4. Meanwhile Barut had succeeded in controlling Kalha, and on the visit of the Residency Agent on the 29th June, 1937, the notables gave out that they had been unable to select one of themselves as Regent and had formally chosen Barut as Regent during the minority of Shaikh Hamad bin Said. In view mainly of Barut*s servile origin Sir Trenchard Towle felt that it was inadvisable to endorse his election as Regent during the minority, and decided that the first step was to ask the notables to select a Council of Regency, whose recognition could suitably be recommended to TT is Majesty’s Government. 5. At the end of August, 1937, information was recei ved that Khalid had again left Dhaid with a party of 50 men with the object of reasserting his claims to the Regency. The exact motive for this step is obscure, but ? m it may have been prompted by fears of interference on the part of the Muscat authorities. I considered that, if Khalid could obtain the acquiescence of the people of Kalba, his election as Regent (though such an election could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a Council) was likely in the circumstances that had arisen to afford the most satisfactory solution, provided that the minor’s * security could be assured. It was therefore determined to do nothing to discourage him, and indeed, while re fraining/-3- ■fraining ft*om any attempt to influence local opinion, to afford him reasonable encouragement. Accordingly the ^Residency Agent visited Kalba in H.M.S. 'Deptford* in September in pursuance of Sir Trenchard Fowle’s decision to induce the notables to agree to elect a Council to carry on the Regency during the Shaikh f s minority. On his arrival at Kalba on the 14th September he reported that Khalid was then at Khor Rakkan, Barut and the notables of Kalba having now invited him to act as Regent on certain conditions providing for the protection of the interests of the minor Shaikh and the State. Khalid, possibly having in mind the unsuccessful adventures of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaiinah earlier in the year, professed unwillingness to enter the town without the permission of the political authorities, but on receipt of information from the Residency Agent that there was no objection, he overcame this reluctance. He was well received and was elected Regent after having undertaken in writing to safeguard the interests of the minor Shaikh and the State. A copy of this document forms an enclosure to this letter. Acting on instructions the Political Agent, Bahrain, next addressed a letter to Khalid informing him that, before the approval of His Majesty’s Government could be applied for to his appointment as Regent of Kalba, he must renew the Treaties and obligations which had been previously accepted by Shaikh Said bin Hamad. On the 26th October Khalid replied accepting the undertakings uncondi tionally. Copies of the Political Agent, Bahrain’s letter to Khalid dated 1st October and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad's reply thereto form enclosures to this letter. 6. It seems probable that Khalid is the only individual on the Trucial Coast who can be described as being in any way acceptable to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah as Regent of Kalba. Being a Jowassim he is acceptable on tribal//'-V tribal grounds. Having at one time *been Sheikh of Sharjah and 'being related (not too closely) to 'both the two Jowassim rulers on the Trucial Coast he is acceptable to them on family grounds. He is believed to be a man of strong charac ter and, being on friendly terms with the Beni Kitab tribe, should be able to stand alone, so that the Shaikh of Sharjah need not fear that Kalba will fall into the hands of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. Nor need the Shaikh of Bas-al- Khaimah fear that Kalba will again form part of the Shaikh of Sharjah’s territory. At the same time Khalid is not on too friendly terms with either of these Shaikhs and there is little reason for them to fear an alliance between Shaikh Khalid and one of them prejudicial to the interests of the other. It seems likely therefore that the formal recogni tion by His Majesty’s Government of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad as Hegent of Kalba during the minority of the minor Shaikh will be accepted without formal protest by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Bas-al-Khaimah. Bven should protests be forth- % coming, they need not be seriously considered, seeing that the Shaikh of Has-al-Khaimah can have no claim to a voice in the affairs of Kalba, and the Shaikh of Sharjah could only claim the right to interfere in Kalba on the ground that Kalba forms part of his dominions. Since His Majesty’s Government acknowledged the independence of Kalba in 1936, a claim so based could not be considered. 7. I recommend that His Majesty’s Government be pleased formally to recognise Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad as Begent of Kalba during the minority of Shaikh Hamad bin Said, the only son of the late Buler of Kalba and request that I may be instructed to inform him accordingly. Early recognition should assist Khalid to stabilize conditions in the Sheikhdom, and/-5 ana I have therefore thought it clesirahle not to await the return of Sir Trencharcl 7owle before making this recommendation.

Enquiries from Muscat seem to show that Muscat authorities did not intend interference, and matter which caused disturbance at Kalba has been settled loca lly. 3. Khalid bin Ahmad, having obtained support of Naqbiyin, has succeeded in persuading people of Kalba to elect him as regent during minority of Hamad, the late Sheikhas son, whose rights he has undertaken' to safeguard, with Barut, the late Wall, again as Wali. 4. Kalba is now quiet and Khalid has given written undertakings to notables, i am, however, awaiting an undertaking from Khalid that he will abide by Treaty and air agreement made by late Sheikh before recommending opening of Kalba for aircraft. 5. As Khalid is ex-Sheikh of Sharjah and Sharjah subject, I have asked Political Agent, Bahrain, to submit report on Sheikh of Sharjah’s reactions to these developments, after receipt of which, and Khalid’s undertaking, I .ixl consider recommendation to His Majesty’s Government for recognition of new Kalba r/gime. - RESIDENT -C3 3 summary treatment oi’ the Sneikh of Ras al Khaimah wifi have an excellent effect on the Trucial coast in general v/here the full story has been officially promulgated.

Extracts from the Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for the month of June,1937. Kalba. 3. In continuation of paragraph 2 of the Me&amp;r Int.Report. A telegram v^as received from the Political Resident,Persian Gulf, on 1 th June, stating that there was a certain amount of confusion in Ras al Khaimah and that the town was cut off from the remainder of the Trucial Coast by land owing to Bedouin activities. This was followed by a further telegram which reported that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had gone to Kalba with the idea of taking control of the Sheikhdom, the opportunity having presented itself owing to the death of the old Shaikh and the minority of his successor, his son Hamad. He had, however, got into difficulties and finding that he could not get back had sent a message to the Political Resident saying that he thought a sloop should be sent to prevent trouble in Kalba. Actually he had so annoyed Khalid, the ex-Shaikh of Sharjah and Mohammed bin Ali, the leader of the Beni Kitab tribe, that they had turned the Bedouins on to raid the outskirts of Ras al Khaimah and also cut communications in order to prevent the Shaikh from getting home. SHCREHAM took the Residency Agent to Ras al Khaimah, where he proceeded ashore to investigate. On return he stated that all was quiet inside the town but raids were continuing on the outlying parts. The ship then proceeded to Kalba arriving at 0600 on 21st June. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah came off immediately and was interviewed by the Senior Naval Officer. He explained that he had done a good service to H.M.Government by sending for a ship, but was quite unable to/(g) 2 . to say why it was that the trouble had only arisen since his arrival. In accordance with the instructions issued by the Political Resident, he was informed that he would be detained onboard and taken to Bahrain to give a personal explanation to the Political Agent as to why he had interfered in the affairs of Kalba, when he had been expressly instructed not to do so. The Residency Agent then went ashore to report on the situation and collect the Ras al Khaimah followers. He succeeded in getting hold of ten out of the twelve men that the Sheikh had brought with him and brought them off to the ship, where they also were detained. The remaining two men were absent from the town in charge of the camels. It appears that when the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah arrived in Kalba he endeavoured to obtain the signatures of the local inhabitants to a document stating that they v/ished him to act as Regent until the boy Hamad came of age. A few had si ;ned this document, but the more important members of the tribe had absented themselves to Muscat and Khor Pakkan. Indeed the Sheikh even attempted to send ashore a further note to the same effect before the ship left Kalba; this was, hov/ever, intercepted and retained. After the return of the Residency Agent on board,the ship proceeded for Sharjah where the Residency Agent and nine of the followers were disembarked at daylight on the 22nd. The followers finding themselves very unpopular in Sharjah, returned by boat that night to Ras al Khaimah. The Sheikh and his personal attendant were handed over to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on SHOREHAM 1 s arrival there on 23rd June. They were duly detained and the Sheikh was interviewed by the Political Agent on 26th June. On .&lt;7th June he was allowed to return to Sharjah by air at his own expense. At the end of the month he was still at Sharjah but was expected to return to Ras al Khaimah very shortly. As soon as the Sheikh was removed from Kalba all Bedouin activities ceased.

Please see the correspondence “below, regarding the activities at Kalha following the death of Sheikh Said. Kalha is a small strip of territory on the eastern side of the Musandim Peninsula, and was at one time part of Sharjah. It is ahout half-way between Bahrein and Gwadur, on the direct air route to India, and considerable importance is attached to its use as an emergency landing site. As a result of recent negotiations the late Sheikh consented to provide air facilities for this purpose, and in consideration of the recognition of his (and his successors’) independence he undertook to observe the terms j conditions of the treaties, etc. at present binding | upon the other Trucial Sheikhs. Sheikh Said died in May and his son Hamid, a boy aged 12, was elected Sheikh by the people of Kalba. The first reports after the death of the Sheikh stated that Sheikh d Bin Ahmad (an ex—Sheikh of Sharjah) had gathered with a force outside Kalba, with a view to isolating the area and thus forcing the people to ask for him as Sheikh. As the policy of Government with regard to the succession of Sheikhs is non-interference, it was decided to let things take their course, and if Khalid succeeded in making himself Sheikh to consider recognising him, subject to his undertaking to recognise the treaties with H.M.G. which had been entered into by his predecessor. A later report from the Political Resident indicated, however, that notwithstanding instructions to the contrary^certain other Trucial Sheikhs were inclined to intervene personally in Kalba affairs. The chief culprit appears to have been the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah who, with a few followers, proceeded to Kalba, but apparently got into difficulties with the local inhabitants (5063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 IOP and/2. and finally had to appeal to the Political authorities for aid. Through co-operation with the Senior Naval Officer a sloop was sent which, under instructions from the! Political Resident, took the Sheikh to Bahrein. The Sheikhi has received a severe warning from the Political Agent at Bahrein and under a promise to mind his own business in future he has been permitted to return to his own territory. The Political Resident considers/that some further notice of the incident on the part of H.M.G. should be taken, and he has suggested that he should be tt authorised to inform the Sheikh that H.M.G. have heard of h condiict with surprise and regret, but that in view of his promise to mind his own business in the future, they do not think it necessary to take any further action in the // present instance. The Political Resident considers that this action would increase the impression already made on the Sheikh and^subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, it is proposed to approve the Residents proposal. A draft telegram is submitted accordingly. 4»K libln fa ^ / ^ zt ^ ft ^.tTU -A« f Ua vu* '(rMyi* 4 Ihl' uU ac^u. 4^0 — ^ * 4 In iv) 7-Draft Paper. p. z. 4235/37. Department.

With the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry, the local Political Authorities were authorised to re-open negotiations with the Sheikh on the lines approved on P.Z.3902. The negotiations a were conducted by Captain T. Hickinbotham, the Officiating Political Agent at Bahrein, and he is to be congratulated on having succeeded in obtaining all the facilities required on the minimum authorised terms. Captain Hickinbotham*s report on the negotiations, together v/ith (a) the text of the Agreement, and (b) copies of letters exchanged with the Sheikh in connection with the recognition of his independence, form enclosures to Colonel Loch*s letter of the 21st September. (P.Z.7109/36 - flag B). The Agreement itself contains six clauses, viz. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12, which were included at the instance of the Sheikh. In the covering letter Colonel Loch states that he considers that these additional clauses are not harmful, and this opinion is endorsed by Colonel Fowle in his Note of the 7th September (flag C). No reason is seen for dissenting from the views expressed by these officials and it is submitted that the action taken by Captain Hickinbotham be confirmed. So much for the Agreement. With regard to the exchange of letters, it will be observed that in consideration of the recognition of his independence the Sheikh has furnished a written undertaking to observe the terms and conditions prescribed in the Treaties and Agreements at presentbinding on the Sheikh of Sharjah and other Trucial Sheikhs. Here again Captain Hickinbotham is to be congratulated on having obtained the Sheikh*s undertaking within the terms of his instructions. The gift of ammunition which is referred to in paragraph 4 of Captain Hickinbotham*s report need not be objected to. The Sheikh attaches particular importance to the grant of a gun salute, and in his telegram of the 21st September (P.Z.6830/36 - flag P) the Political' Resident recommends that he should be granted a personal salute of three guns, which should be fired as soon as possible in order to show the local world that we have, in fact, recognised his independence. The proposal to grant a gun salute was approved in principle on P.Z. 3902/36, and, with the approval of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, a draft submission to the King is submitted for approval. The Political Resident suggests that the question of making this salute dynastic should be taken up later as there are various local considerations which must be taken into account. (Sgd.) A.C.B. SYMON. 29/x. When the question of the gun salute is disposed of (a reminder from the Resident on the subject is now added) it is proposed to communicate the decision to the Resident and at the same time give covering sanction to the conclusion of the agreement v/ith the additional clauses referred to above - conveying also the Secretary of State's appreciation of the able conduct of the negotiations by the Officiating Political Agent.Letters will also be sent to the Admiralty and Air Ministry regarding Commander Harvey and Squadron Leader Fogarty, and at the same time both they and the Foreign Office will/2 Minute Paper.

Lord Zetland presents his humble duty to Your Majesty and has the honour to submit that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased to approve that the Sheikh of Kalba, in the region of the Persian Gulf, may be granted a personal salute of three guns. Kalba is situated on the Eastern coast of Trucial Oman and is about half way between Bahrein and Gwadur on the direct air route to India; considerable importance is attached to the establishment of an emergency landing site at that place. As a result of recent negotiations the Sheikh of Kalba has consented to provide facilities for this purpose and in consideration of the recognition of his independence he has undertaken to observe the terms and conditions prescribed in the Treaties and Agreements at present binding upon other Sheikhs of Trucial Oman. In consequence the local political authorities have represented that the Sheikh should be granted a personal salute of three guns both as an expression of appreciation of his attitude in regard to the establishment of the landing ground and as a formal recognition of his independence. The proposal has the support of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. (Sgd.) Zetland,iJC/tffi (. 32 jgz-QUFS» ) 4836. PliCrPHKK Qg TBLBaHA M.
