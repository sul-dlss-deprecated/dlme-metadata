Correspondence is chiefly exchanged between the British Legation in Tehran, the Foreign Office in London, and the External Affairs Department of the Government of India. The correspondence includes efforts to ascertain the facts and circumstances of reported incidents, and the ensuing diplomatic correspondence with the Persian Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Incidents covered include: in September 1930, the arrival in Dizzak [Dīzūk], Persian Baluchistan, of British levies in pursuit of camel thieves; in November 1935, the presence of British troops near Kuhak [Nūk Jow], Persia, the Persian Government’s dispatch of 400 troops to the region, the British Government’s insistence that the area occupied by its troops at Gorich Kalag [Gorich Categ] lay in British territory, and assertions that troops were dispatched in response to reports that a Persian occupation of the area was anticipated; in November 1937, the raid of a shop in Pilani Sunt (referred to locally as Kastag [Kastak]) by Iranian customs officials, regarded by British officials as an incursion into British territory.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000038#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000038#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
