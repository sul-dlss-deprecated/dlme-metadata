Harrison, Esquire, Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, LONDON. S.W.l a ■ r: ^ u*- //&lt;• •LB’A copy of 'The Times Air Edition' has been sent by T tk*™ Office bag to the political Resident in the Persian Golf since November last, in accordance with his request, flagged at Ext. 6200 /^j 6 * The India Office is no longer sending copies of the Times to the Government of India through the bag, and the Govemaent of India have arranged with the High Ccmaissioner for 21 copies to be sent to the Infonaation and Arts Deparianent and charged to them* This does not, of course, include the Political Resident's copy, which would be very out of date to him via India. It seems a little hard to ask Colonel Hay to pay for his copy, but it is unlikely that the Information and Arts Department with their greatly reduced budget, would be prepared to stand the cost* The cost of the Public Relations Office in the Persian Gulf is now borne by the India Office vote, and it is suggested that Messrs* Dawson &amp; Sons, Ltd* , should be requested to send a copy of the Times Air Edition to Bahrein by air 1 each day and include the cost in their account for newspapers supplied to this Office (see Mails Branch file attached). The original order was placed by this Office without reference to the Government of India, azkL it seems very unlikely that they will think of supplying a copy to the Itolitical Resident* As this expenditure will be recurring it is necessary for it to be sanctioned in the first instance by the Under Secretary of State.

J In accordance with tlje instructions contained in the attached telegram this Office w;.ll cease Ao trans ait copies of 'THE TIMES AIR EDITION' on behalf of the G. of I. as soon as the High Commissioner's Office can make alternative arrangements. One immediate result of the new arrangement is that with effect from 4th June the copy now sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf will be discontinued. It was found necessary to ask the G. of I, to take over responsibility for the supply of the 'Times' Air Edition because of the high cost of air mail charges devolving upon this Office with the transfer from Service to Civil air transport Whether the G. of I. intend to make arrangements for the Political Resident to receive a copy in future it is impossible to say.
