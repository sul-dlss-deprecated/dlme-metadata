I have the honour to inform you that owing to the increase of worh., the Hofuf and Katif offices need to make daily mails with Bahrein instead of weekly as arranged between Hofuf and Bahrein. I shall be very much obliged if you will kindly issue necessary instructions to the offices concerned. The agent of Hofuf at Bahrein will insure the expenses necessary for the transport of correspondences between Bahrein Hofuf Katif on our account. I request you also to matce the possible facilita tion for distributing the coresponde.nces to their persons; and, the agent of Ho fur at Bahrein can appoint a private person for that service under the Iguardship of the Bahrein office if you see that possible anyhow the only thing we wish, is to f cilitate the r commercial correspondences for the inhabitants of both parts. v.-tWMC.„ni 1, cnt1 , jP* 0.
