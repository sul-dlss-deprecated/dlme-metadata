My dear Mr.Kanoo, I want to thank you once again tor your wonder!ul hospitality. It was really delightful in your lovely home. I only hope I may have the pleasure of coming Dack and. staying as you so very kindly invited me. I am enclosing a copy of the snapshot I took of you, and hope you like it. The one of tne children,unfortunately is not so good - it was a little late m the day when I took it,and also a little too dark in tnat lane. However,when I come back I T 11 have another try. I hope you are keeping well and have quite got over tnat trouble of yours. I shall olten think of the lovely day you gave us in Bahrain. It is one oi the wonderful times of my trip. II you should come to New York,I nope you will do me (ana my lather) the honour ol coming to stay with us. I hope it won T t be long before we meet again,anyhow, either on this side or tnat side of the world. I am, Sincerely yours, Winifred Howard. 277 Park Avenue. New York City.277 Park Avenue. January 8th,1933. My dear Mr.Kanoo, ^ I have been such a long time in replying to your charming' letter. Please forgive me! much has been happening in my life. Among other things I nave been getting married . You asked me once wliy I wasn f t married - do you remember? and I told you it was a long story - well,it is a much longer one now,and when I next go to Bahrain,! will tell it to you. I do hope I can come again before very long. There is such a depression everywhere,though,that it is not easy to get away. Then,again,my father’s health has notvbeen good during this past year and that has kept me tied fairly closely here. As it is,I am with him now,and my husband is in England. I hope all goes well with you and yours. How are those darling little girls I saw that day I was with you? I am still writing things,ann hope to go on doing more and more. Does your offer still hold good to let me come out to your charming house? I hope so,because I want to do it,someday. My husband won’t mind my going - he said so! I wish you all joy and prosperity in tne coming year. My father joins me in greetings to you and yours. Sincerely, yours. Winifred Howard. (Mrs.Peter H.Howard-Clitty).0 m 277 Park Avenue. New York City. August 13th. My dear Mr.Kanoo, v I want to thank you for your very nice letter which I received some time ago. Since then I have had a very great sorrow for my father diea. He and I were such close comrades that it seems as though my world is empty just now. You will understand,! know. Did Yateem tell you that I am coming back to the Persian G-ulf again? He has a story which I am going to write,so am leaving England at the end of September or early October. So, my dream is going to come true,and you will be seeing me again soon. There is so much of interest in your wonderful country that I know I shall find a great deal to write about. I am looking forward to it with very great joy,and in these montns o± lonjlmess, 1 1 will give me a wonderful interest away from the scenes that are filled witn so many associations. Almost as soon as you get this,I shall be beginning my preparations for departure,and will be following close on its heels. No,my husband will not be with me. He has his work to do. He is at sea,an engineer,so I would be left alone anyhow. It is much better to be occupied with work one loves so I am going on with my writing. I shall tell you all about it wnen we meet. All good wishes to you and yours. I am Yours sincerely, Winifred Howara-Clitty.© Southam Priory, near Cheltenham. G-louces ter shire. England. September 25th.

Bushire Printed Letter of November 18th,No:1823-S. 2. So far as I can ascertain here Mrs.Roward-Clitty (who was then Miss fifinifre^ Howard) came on shore for a couple of hours with the Commander and another officer of one of the B.I Steamers,met Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo and went to lunch at Yateem’s garden. She exchanged Y*o or three letters with Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo,the first letteis being in October and Novembfer 1931,just after her visit ana the remainder in 1933. 3. It seems that her intention is to write a story which Muhammad Yateem (Major Holmes T man) is to give her - possibly the story of his life but this is not quite clear. 4. She is apparently proposing to meet Muhammad Yateem at Kuwait and has been trying to get into touch with him through Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo. s. e: MOIPC-&gt;1^573(CSr)nCF—(a 115'-7-5 ro- 1,00,000.

You will note from enclosure that the lady spoke over the telephone to the foreign Office iassport Hepsrtment, and said that she had previously visited Kuwait and knew the Ghaikh. 2. His Excellency replied in writing thfct he did not know :rs.Howard Clitty, but understood that she had been in vited by Pr.kohaioed Yetia (the ,irab f mentioned by ilrs.H.Clitty in h«r application for her passport.)

In a later conversation His Excellenc* told me that 2i years ago he remembered being told that an Buglish Lady, who resided in America, had landed, in comptny with iir.Yatlm, from an up slow am 11 steamer, and had asked to interview him, but that he had refused to see her. He understood thst eho vtr. the same person. 4. *hlle the Maikh did not definitely say that he ob jected to the lady’s presence in Kuwait, I could clearly see that he did at all not like the idea of her putting up with Hr.: obtained Yatim is, as you are aware, Taj or Holmes’© - 2 - with l'r«; ohamed Yatlm* 5« I em in entire agreement with I:ia ^oellency and consider Mrs.Howard Clitty should not be permitted to come to await unless she can find accommodation with the American Mission or some respectable Arab family. 6* Mrs.Howard Clitty, no doubt, is en4tirely unaware that Hr.Mohamed Yatim is a notorious drunioard and evil liver, and actually resides in the 'Prostitute uarter' of Kuwait. Although he is Major Holmes* Agent and very clever at that, no respectable Kuwait man will be seen in his house, and it would be entirely wrong, if an English Lady (who, 1 believe, met Mr.Yatim quite casually on board ship) were to take up her residence with him. 7. lam surprised that the Foreign Office, London, did not think of verifying from me first, the Lady’s statement that she knew the Shaikh and whether the latter hod any ob jection to her visiting his capital. The lady herself might I think, also/hav addressed me, before she thought of this expedition of hers. 8. I notice that the assport Department of the Foreign Office were told to endorse 1 rs.Howard Clitty 1 s passport to Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (except Nejd and the interior). I ma. not quite sure what this latter means. If it is intended that she should land at Jubail, ^atif or Ojair and visit Hassa, I much doubt if she will succeed in face of Bin Baud’s well known views. . » 9. As I understand from a private letter ^ferfft she has sent me that Mrs.Howard Clitty arrives in Basra at the end of November via Bagdad, I am, in anticipation of your approval, sending a copy of this to Mr .Consul Hurst, Basra, and am ask ing him to warn Mrs.Howard Clitty that she cannot proceed to Kuwait, without giving a proper undertaking that she will stay with local Europeans, or at least with an Arab married family, who,- 3 - vfiio,BrQ knoTrn Rnd rcspeoteft. .ritish ’prestige’ forbids that she puts up id.th e young ijrab men living alone, arid In the evil quarter mentioned by me* X have the honour to be, Sir, 'Xour most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonal, lolltical Agent, Kuwait.

Siie is sain to be Hysterical and possibly consumptive. 3. It is understood tnat some ol her draft articles for the Press are of an undesirable type. She regards the Arab as the highest form of man and is very angry at not being permitted to go to Kuwait. Her intention is said to be to give her impressions in a series ol articles in the Press (possibly under a pen-name,which I do not know) and in a move!, it seems possible that she may try to pillory the Political Lepartment. I venture to suggest that it might be useful to ask His Majesty’s Government to have a watch kept for the articles (in s ’ 6 * /both MGrIPC—SI —01(CSP)DCP—{Q*1227)—21-3-30—4,00,000* ' From To iVc.both the British and American Press). If the early ones prove undesirable and harmful^he possibility of warning the press confidentially about her,or of taking other action,might be considered 4.

My dear Gilbert, f With reference to your letter No.P.Z.702/34 of the 3rd February about Mrs.Howard Clitty’s proposed visit to the Persian Gulf, I write to say that the Passport Office have agreed that in future, before visas are given to British women travelling in the Gulf, particularly if they intend to reside in any of the Arab Sheikhdoms, prior reference will be made to the Political Resident. This practice is already in operation as regards visas for foreign women travellers. Incidentally, further enquiry has shown that the lady in question is a British subject, which explains why she was not referred to the local British authorities in the first place.
