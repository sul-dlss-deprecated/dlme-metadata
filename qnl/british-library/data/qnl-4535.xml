Prior, C. 1. it Political Resident in the Persian 8ulf, BushireConfidential&gt; No•G/181-6/3• Sharjah, 20th February 194lo A* I P Will you please refer to my demi-official letter No.G/45-6/3 dated the 16th January 1941. 2. I enclose a copy of Whitteran's report and a sketch map (.not to scale; which I hope will make it clearer. You will notice that, except for the demand for an aerial photograph, the report is non-committal. This is not surprising in view of the fact that it is based on data obtained only from about forty lead-soundings and one day's inspection. At the same time, there can be no quarrel with his conclusions, that the silting of the sea-bar constitutes a serious and direct menance to the prosperity of the town end that the Hattai Bank and the silting caused by the jetty may between . them ruin the alighting area in the not too distant future. 3. I have discussed the question at length with Captain White, who is an ex-master mariner of experience and was associated' with vVhitteron when the latter was inspecting the creek. As a result, it is my duty to bring the following points to your notice. 4. In general, water and tides are tricky things and their behaviour in these parts is complicated by the strong winds that are so prevalent. This being so, it is quite possible that the proposed spurs may produce most unfortunate results. Uo doubt they will divert the ebb tide over the Hattai Bank and in time wash away at least part of it. But this silt must go somewhere and as shown by the pencilled arrows, it may tend to fill up the present deep water channel. Furthermore, a diversion, as proposed, of the direction of the ebb tide may cause a deposit of silt from the Daira shallows in the deep water opposite Gray,Lackenzie 1 s building The iiattai bank is already 2 feet out of water at low tide and only ! about 18 inches under it at high tide. It is doubtful if the spurs / Major R.G.E.Alban,O.B.E., Political Agent,Bahrain. Sec S-//2///&gt; /would ever make it deeper than 3 or 4 feet at high water and therefore, are the probable risks worth the likely results V My own opinion is that, if British Airways wish to take action separately against the Hattai Bank, then we must insist on a written ideranity bond to secure the Shaikh against possible interference with his navigable channels. 5. with regard to the sea-bar, I feel that the report underestimates the magnitude of 'the task. Fairly extensive dredging seems indicated in the first instance and then, after that, large breakwaters may be required to keep the channel clear. The effect of these operations on the rest of the creek would also have to be studied for some considerable period. 6. There is another point on which I know 1 am not really in a position to hazard an opinion but which i cannot refrain from mentioning. The Hattai Bank is not likely seriously to interfere with the landing area for another two years and the proposed open ing in the jetty may be [sufficient remedy. During this period, therefore, it is not impossible that the whole routing policy of British Airways may be radically altered, so much so that the problem of the Hattai Bank may cease to have any imp'ortance. 7. in view of the foregoing, it seems that we should first initiate a careful and l^gthy survey, extending over some months and aided by aerial photography(if available; and an automatic sounder. The latter, 1 understand, is a reasonably cheap machine and would of course be useful in other parts of the (iulf. When we have really sufficient and upto-date data, the services of an expert irrigation engineer would appear inevitable; at least, any work of this importance cannot be left to local labour under the supervision of an Airways coxswain. The Shaikh must also be prepared for heavy initial expenditure and possible recurring expenses and 1 oliink ix. oi fundaiuental importance that, with the possible exception of the openings in the jetty, the various problems should be treated as one integral whole and not taken up in detail.S' © JJUBAI CREEK . Inspection CD burveyso C2) I visited the creek on the 11th, 13th and 14th January, and was given valuable assistance by the Coxswain Captain White: we traversed the creek from the bay to the upper end of the landing ground by launch and took a number of soundings. We had available a detailed survey made by K.D.U'ingbush in 1937 to 1/5000 scale, and a general Admiralty chart to a smaller scale. The quarantine building and the jetty are the I only fixed points from which one can gauge ones position and therefore we were unable to fix the points of our soundings with sufficient accuracy to note them on the survey&lt;» We were however able to detect well defined tendencies which will be discussed later# It has been suggested that an air survey photograph should be made as soon as possible: such a photograph at low- tide will enable us to check our impressions of the growth of sand bank (similar changes which have taken place since 1937 survey. Such a photograph by fixing such landmarks as exist will be of considerable assistance to the coxswain in making soundings. General Descriptions. C3) The sea bar appears to have grown to such a degree that some dredging must soon be put in hand or the harbour will become useless for shipping. Although this is outside the scope of the present problem and the growth of the bar is likely to effect navigetion before having my considerable influence on the landing area of iJie creek, its improvement would be desirable, and I will therefore obtain particular^ of a small excavating plant for working on a pontoon which should be sufficient for such a task. If these particulars ! /v ! * mm-2- / G) were given oo the iihaikh of Dubai by the Political -Kgent it would enable hiin to form some idea of the means to solve his difficulties and might encourage some action® The lower end of the creek, which is used as a harbour is of good depth throughout, and owing to the sides being for the most part, built up with stone its outline is fixedJ this part extends round a bend after which there is a bend in the opposite direction in which a large sand bank has for formeds this is marked on the Admiralty chart as the 'Hattai Bank.' Above here is the landing ground area which will be referred to as the 'upper creek'© present Tendencies (4) The silt in the upper creek is a very fine sand, easily stirred and easily moved by a ^entle current. C'i'he foreshore sand in the sea proper is the same and appears to be broken down to very fine grain by water action;. There was no noticeable evidence of silting in the lower creek, although it is probable that with the building up of the bar, more silt is brought in than taken out. There does seem to be a considerable change of the sandbank at the inlet of che upper creek. This is growing and the main channel on the southwest side is much deeper th :! than shown on the survey and also narrower, xhe tendency appears to be for the current to cut out in to the lower end of the bank and build the upper end, thus increasing the loop. ' I The current through this channel is strong and scours the sand into the upper creek. Deflected from the southwest \ bank it carr^j&amp;sthe silt to the shallows on the northeast siae ' The ebb tide will scour the channel, but does not remove the silt dropped on the northeast shallows, so that there is a tendency to gain.-3- 7 &amp; The adverse effects set up by this baiik are to ay mind the main cause of the present 'oroublesc The upper creek itself is relatively straight and would be likely to be stable if extraneous deleterious effects were eliminated. The newly built stone jetty has caused silting on the sand bank above and below it as would be expected. I did not at first realise that this Jetty is not the one shewn on the 1937 survey, and extends further into the I creek. The causeway out as far as the low water line fulfils a good purpose in creverting dead water above and below which cJ' deposits its si .Lt on these areas which were above low water level and therefore useless. The extension of the Jetty out into the creek has caused this bank to extend out into the creek and has decreased the width of landing area, a tendency which must be dealt with. A proportion of this silt seem to have come from the center of the creek which gave deeper souSnings in many pietct places than shewn in the 1937 survey. On the opposite side it seemed as though there were changes due to secondary effects either of the swirls set up in the inlet channel or the Jetty, but it was very difficult to Judge on the ground. The changes on this bank are not likely to be serious and if the air photograph confirms that they are developing preventive measures can be undertaken. -he Sharjah creek is interesting by comparison as it has a very similar outline to Dubai, and has developed the \ same tendency to silt on the northwest side, which having continued unchecked, has now rendered the creek practically useless. Preventive recommendations —-—• (a) The influence of the Hattai Bank must be corrected andit is thought that spurs on the northeast bank near the R.O.C* site v/ould have the desired effect of directing the ebb flow against the nose of this bank# It may be advisable if the desired effect develops satisfactorily, to place obstructions in the minor channel on the south west side of this bank, to cause it to silt itself. These recommendations will be given in detail after study of the air survey photograph. (b&gt; To counteract the silting caused by the jetty it is proposed that an opening about 12 feet wide should be made at the near of the building, a channel would be started through this and the sides of the causeway would be supported by rails driven into the bed, and strutted across their upper ends at the paveament levelo The channel would be trained by making a rubble wall on the bank side, and an apron of bounders both upstream and downstream would protect the building at the jetty end from scour and direct the flow of the current# If a plan is available I will make a drawing of these proposals in which you may wish the A.i .W.D. to concur# (c&gt; Further training works along the banks of the upper creek may be necessary but would be of a secondary nature. I discussed the general question with i.J3.Lacey whose experience was very helpful. He gave me to understand that large supplies of coral boulder can be obtained at a low rate and this will be exjellenA for constructing spurs and training walls* The works are probably larger than appears on a small il plan, but I think that they represent the only constructive means of improving the creek; they can be carried out with local materials and local labour, and the effects could be studied by means of photographs taken after the training had been in progress some months, so that extension or amendi.ent could be effected. 13Summary 6. A creek with a winding approach such as Dubai will tend to throw up 'banks and to require fairly constant protection. It does seems however that Judicious training can be carried out from local resources which should stop the present deterioration. Also a channel can be made through the jetty to create a scour and cut back the bank, leaving the remainder of the causeway to fulfill its function of building up the bank behind this line® Afte 7 0 After studying of the air photograph any necessary corrections of the foregoing remarks will be made and the oroposals will be marked on the photograph, with sektches etc* 3d.: Berbard Whitteron, a .
