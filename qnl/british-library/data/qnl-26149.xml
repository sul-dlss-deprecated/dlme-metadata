This is based on the analogy of visit of His Majesty the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Govern ment of India consider, however, that as the expenditure is entirely political it ought to be wholly charged to His Majesty's Government. They do not proposeto press this point in the present case in view of the smallness of the amount involved and the fact that this cannot be used as a precedent as Aden will soon pass out of India.

His Majesty sailed from Catania on the 22nd October on board the Royal Yacht ’’Savoia”, escorted by the two destroyers ’’Gorizia” and ''Niobe”. He was accompanied by Signor De Bono, Minister of the Colonies. The party reached Port Said on the 24th October and spent two days there. On arrival they were saluted by the shore batteries and by H.M. S. ''Durban”, v/hich happened to be in the harbour. A company of Egyptian police formed a guard of honour. The Italian Minister came down from Cairo, accompanied by the staff of the Legation and various consular officials. His Majesty after inspecting the various Young Fascist organisations of Port Said, motored down to Ismailia where he visited the monument commemorating the defence of the Canal during the Great V/ar. On the 25th October Zulficar Pasha, Grand Chamberlain of the Egyptian Court, presented the respects of King Fuad and the 'Savoia' sailed for Aden on the same day. 3. The King arrived at Aden on the 29th October, being saluted by the shore batteries and by one of His Majesty’s sloops in the harbour. The Resident is reported to have called on His Majesty on arrival and, with other high officials, to have been invited to dinner on board. 4 The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G. C.S. I. , K. C.V. 0. , 21 DEC 1S54than • • • mm W*' &amp; 4. His Majesty arrived at Mogadisciu on the 3rd November and was accorded an enthusiastic reception. In the course of a very full fortnight he managed to see a great deal of the country; he covered about 1,600 miles by motor caravan, penetrating to the neighbourhood of the frontier with Abyssinia and also crossing the Juba river in order to set foot in Jubaland and cross the line of the equator. r £his section of his tour gave the Italian press occasion to refer gracefully to the most recently acquired territory of the Colonial Empire and to the fact that it had been ceded by Great Britain. For purposes of record I enclose a detailed account, in diary form, of the King’s tour in Italian Somaliland. 5. Sailing from Mogadisciu on the 16th November, the King of Italy, accompanied by the Governor of Somaliland, visited the salt works at Dante and, on his homeward journey to Italy, called at Berbers on the 21st November. The success of the latter visit appears to have been somewhat diminished by the rain. In reporting on it the 'Corriere della Sera”, in particular, paid warm tribute to the friendly relations existing between British and Italian oomaliland. Off Perim the ’’Savoia” was saluted by units of the British fleet sailing East. The King landed in Italy on the 20th November. 6. The Italian press has devoted considerable space to daily reports of the progress of His Majesty’s tour and there can be little doubt that publicity, in the best sense of the word, formed the main object, as it certainly constituted the main result, of His Majesty’s visit to Italian Somaliland, The authorities wished to advertise to the Italian people the existence, and value of their most distant colony, which since it has figured less prominently in recent military historythan the north African colonies, and is a less fertile terri uor/ tn,,:. Eritrea, is not as well known as it deserves to be to the mass of the Italian people. It seems likely that Italy as a whole will now he able to take a more intelligent interest in the present dispute with Abyssinia over the frontier between that country and Italian Somaliland. A lesser, but important, aim of the visit was no doubt to stimulate and reward the 1,700 Italians more or less permanently settled in Somaliland and who are doing good work in the face of very great difficulties. ..nen I was discussing this visit, a colleague who has special sources of information told me that a gold mine of considerable potential value had been discovered in Italian African territory, 1 believe in Somaliland. The greatest secrecy is, however, being preserved with regard to this discovery, and I can see no means at present of verifying the report. 8. In conclusion I may perhaps add that the following story is going the rounds of Rome. The King is said to have wished to remain in Italian Somaliland since to see black people in white shirts was in such pleasant contrast to his daily practice in Rome.

The King then drove by car to the Governor’s Palace where a triumphal arch had been built for the occasion. Native troops lined the route. After a brief halt at the Palace, The King drove to the cathedral where he attended a short service; from there he went to the monument to the fallen on v/hich he placed a bronze wreath; he then visited the Militia barracks where he inspected various Fascist organisations. During the afternoon The King received colonial officials. 4th November .

Dear Department, Yesterday’s bag brought us your official despatch No*932 (J 2574/1942/66) of 30th October in irtiich you ex- pressedlthe opinion that we should be justified in drawing the attention of the Italian Government to the very unsatis factory position for all concerned created by the numerous and contradictory assurances received by His Majesty’s Government over the question of the flying by the King of Italy of his standard on the occasion of the ,, Savoia’8 ,, entry into Aden* we have consulted the Ambassador on this point which is a ticklish one for the following reasons. For. some time past there has been a lamentable lack of co-operation and li aison between the Cerimoniale Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and The Palace here. In the past we have been rapped on the knuckles by The Palace for addressing certain kinds of requests and enquiries, which ultimately concern The King of Italy, through the medium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Last January we were categorically in formed by a high official at the Palace that when the Head of a Mission wished to make any communication to His Majesty, the request must be made in writing to the Prefect of the Palace. Further, the Head of the Cerimoniale Department, though one of the most charming Italian officials we know, is also one of the least reliable - he could not be more accommodating, The Egyptian Department, FOREIGN OFFICE.accommodating, but equally, he could scarcely be more vague. In these circumstances, on receiving your telegram No. 330 of 17th October, we applied to The Palace direct, both on grounds of expediency and of protocol. We need not recapitu late here the series of conflicting messages which subsequently we obtained from The Palace officials, for they are admirably recapitulated in the memorandum enclosed in your despatch. The truth of course is that those who really knew The King's wishes were on board the royal yacht and the liaison between the yacht and The Palace was bad. Added to this, The King himself seems to have changed hie mind more than once. The position being as we have sketched it above, the Ambassador believes that you will not misinterpret our intention if we suggest that any comment which you may wish to make to the Italian Government on this sad story should be made through Grand! in London and not here in Rome. Grand! will know how to deal with your communication. He will send it, no doubt, to the Palazzo Chigi and it will be transmitted in the usual form. If, on the other hand, we are to make the communication, we are faced at once with the difficulty of complaining to the Ministry of contradictory information with which they have had nothing to do, for it all emanated direct from The Palace. We could, of course, explain to The Palace how difficult things have been made for us, owing to the contradictory nature of the assurances received, but this, alas, the Master of Ceremonies knows only too well himself and would not thank us for underlining the obvious: while such a course would not, we imagine, meet your wishes for the Italian Government qua Government would receive no word from us at all. Perhaps, therefore, you would let us know whether you agree or not to the suggestion that the matter might be dealt with more satisfactorily in London.

Visit of the King; of Italy to Aden . In a Note dated Octo'ber 2nd the Italian Ambassador enquired, whether there was any objection to the call at Aden of the King of Italy T s yacht 'Savoia” escorted by the Italian cruiser 'Gorizia' • On October 13th, the views of the other Departments concerned having been obtained, the Italian Ambassador was told that there was no objection to this visit, and a letter was written to Sir Clive V/igram asking him to inform the King of the proposed call at Aden and to take His Majesty’s pleasure as to the treatment v/hich should be accorded to the King of Italy at that place. On October 15th, Mr. Mitchell, replying to the above letter to Sir Clive Wigram, informed us that the King desired that the King oi Italy*s visit should be treated in the same way as the King of Spain’s to Malta in 1927. He also said that the King trusted that King Victor Emmanuel v/ould hoist his Standard, and suggested that it might be possible for His Majesty* s wishes to be made knov/n to the King. The 1927 precedent laid down that the King oi Spain 'whether he be travelling incognito or not 'if his Royal Standard is hoisted, should be received with all 'honours and compliments by both Naval and Military: in fact 'to oe treated exactly the same as if King George himself were 'visiting the island'. On October 17th His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome was informed accordingly, and instructed to make the King’s wishes known at Rome. On October 19th Sir E. Drummond telegraphed in the following terms: 'The King of Italy will fly his Standard on entering Aden, 'and/and wishes me to convey his thanks to the King for His Majesty ,f kind message ,f . On October 25th the Resident at Aden telegraphed that the Italian Consul at that place had informed him that the King of Italy would not fly his Standard, and that the Consul had requested confirmation. On October 26th, at the request of the India Office, His Majesty*s Embassy at Rome were consulted by telephone and later replied that the competent Palace official had said that the King of Italy invariably flew his Standard when travelling in his yacht. On October 27th this telephone message was confirmed by a telegram from. Sir Drummond in which he reported that he had had a visit from the Master of Ceremonies who had repeated that the King of Italy invariably flies his Standard; that His Majesty expected salutes, and if he did disembark, guards of honour, although he desired to maintain the private character of his visit. On October 29th a further telegram from Sir E.

J o o 26th October, 1934. J.2551/1942/166 /''N Dear Laithwaite, In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, the following is the text of the message which was dictated to me by the Embassy at Rome this evening: Your message of this morning regarding King of Italy’s visit to Aden. Content of your message was communicated this evening to competent Palace official who repeated once again that the visit was a private one,but that the King of Italy invariably flew his Standard when travelling in his yacht. He believed but could not, of course, be certain that the Italian Consul at Aden had been misinformed. Matter has now been explained by us to Ministry for Foreign Affairs who have promised to instruct Italian Consul accordingly. J.Gr. Laithwaite Esq,We 'believe position would be met, certainly so far as Italian wishes are concerned, if King of Italy was greeted with appropriate gun salute but was spared unnecessary ceremonies on shor*e, for His Majesty certainly wishes visit to be of a private character. As I told you over the phone, I discussed the position with Warner of the Treaty Department that the requirements of the situation would be met if the ceremonial on the arrival of the King of Italy at Aden were restricted to (l) the firing of appropriate salutes, and (2) the parading of a Guard of Honour on His Majesty’s first landing. Warner considers that since the King of Italy has expressed a desire that his visit should be a private one, the above ceremonial will sufficiently mark the respect which is due to the reigning Sovereign of a foreign country f on his arrival. In conversation Rome Embassy suggested that the easiest.••easiest course would be for somebody to go aboard ’ , Savoia ,, when she berths to discuss the King*8 wishes with the equerry, and this seems to us a most sensible suggestion.

My dear Laithwaite, I spoke to you this evening regarding Reilly's telegram of the l6th October to the Government of India (which was repeated to you and to us) regarding the King of Italy's visit to Aden. Go far as the Colonial Office is concerned, there is no objection to the staff arrangements which he proposes. We have seen your official letter to the Foreign Office Ro.P.Z. 6459/54 of the 17th October, enclosing a draft reply to the Goverament of India (which is to be repeated to the Chief Commissioner), and if you agree, we suggest that you should add to that draft, when it is sent, a sentence to the effect that there is no objection to the staff J.G. LAITHWAITE, ESQ., arrangementsarrangements proposed so tar as the Colonial Of lice is concerned. As I told you on the * phone, the King of Italy is paying a short visit to British Somaliland after he leaves Italian Somaliland. We think that Reilly ought to know of this, as the King of Italy is certain to refer to it in conversation. You agreed and we suggest therefore that a further paragraph should also be added to your reply to the Government of India on the following lines:- 'For information. King of Italy is paying short visit to British Somaliland after leaving Italian Somaliland, probably arriving Berbera l6th November.'k.

Italian cruiser GORIZIA, will arrive at Aden on 28th October and leave again on JOth October for Italian Somaliland. The King's pleasure is that His Majesty should 'be treated in the saiLe way as the King of Spain on the occasion of his visit to Malta, (See Foreign Office letter of 13th October, flag J}. The King has also expressed the hope that the King of Italy will fly his standard at Aden (I gather that the King of Spain did not in fact fly his standard at Malta and that tnere were in consequence no ceremonies on nis arrival). The Foreign Office are telegraphing to-day to the Embassy at Rome to ascertain definitely whether His Majesty proposes in fact to fly his Standard or not, but to give a lead in the direction of his doing so._ u» kA (Xl™ &gt; 2 . The Resident's proposal to communicate the programme contemplated for the King’s visit to His Majesty in advance through the Italian Consul at Aden seems suitable ana the Foreign Office, I understand, agree. If ^ ^ ^ l* \S*\jr Citf w ' n, 'P 3. It seems desirable to keep the matter on an official basis ana a draft to the Foreign Office enclosing a draft telegram of instructions to the Chief Commissioner is attached. The draft touches on the question of the precautions to be taken in connection with His Majesty's visit, Aden is a very scattered place and the forces at the Chief Conmissloner's disposal are very limited. But there is fortunately no reason to anticipate any incident and Colonel Reilly can be relied on to take all possible precautions. 2621 GOOD 3 34Draft Paper. |(0) political Department.

The King arrived on board the
                           Savoia, escorted by the cruiser
                           Gorizia.The majority of the file comprises correspondence between the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, the Aden Chief Commissioner (Bernard Reilly), the Italian Embassy in London, the British Ambassador to Italy (Sir Eric Drummond), the Admiralty, and HMS
                           Penzance. The correspondence concerns arrangements for the King's arrival, the confusion over the public or private nature of the visit, whether the standard should be flown, and what honours and salutes should be granted accordingly.The file also contains a letter from Reilly remarking on the King's visit (folios 20-21), and a letter and report from Drummond providing details of the King's tour of Italian Somaliland (folios 13-18). Later correspondence concerns the confusion over the arrival procedures, and the question as to whether a formal complaint should be submitted, plus details of additional expenses to be met by the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
