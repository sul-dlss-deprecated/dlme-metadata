Muscat - Automatic Telephone System. 11. Investigation of the requirements has been somewhat delayed as a result of a slight misunderstanding over the proposed visit of a Cable &amp; Lireless, Ltd., engineer and a subsequent absence of transport. The situation has now been cleared up satisfactorily, and the engineer should arrive towards the end of April. Once agreement has been reached with the Sultan as to the terms under which the installation is to be operated, completion of the project should take very little time, as suitable material is available for almost immediate delivery. ...usca t - External Communications . • 12. It is understood that so long as the Sultan is residing at Salalah, his messages are cleared by an R.A.F. wireless channel from there to Aden, the majority then being handed over there to Cable and Wireless, Ltd. It also appears that no charge has been made against the Sultan for the handling of this traffic, although there is no confirmation of this fact. If, for example, the traffic is being charged against the R.A.F. account in Aden by Cable o Wireless, Ltd., the Sultam may eventually be faced with a retrospective account, and it is therefore suggested that the matter should be taken up with [the R.A.F. in ^den to ascertain the true facts, so that any (unnecessary misunderstanding with the Sultan may be avoided. cneTdential PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. the 10th/12th Lay* 1947 No. 879 Copy forwarded, with compliments, to The Political Agent, MUSCAT, ^for favour of action on the lines proposed in the last sentence of paragraph 12 if he sees no objection and for any comments he may have to make.Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain* EXPRESS LETTER prom Political Resident, Persian Gulf.
