Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., Foreign Office. 17 FEB 1942 Copy to :- Dear Baxter, We should he grateful for your views on the Government of India’s air mail telegram No. 211 of January 15th (copy enclosed) suggesting that they should hint in their propaganda directed to Persia at the advantages of the abolition or curtailment of conscription. Our latest information as to the method H.D.G. Daw, M.i.I. Major H.'it.Dinwiddle , 2. M.0.12,|W^r Office. proposed for the recruitment of the Persian 1 yFEB 194-2. /4f .(( army is that the War Office, in their telegram No. 52016 of November 15th, suggested in agreement with the Foreign Office that the army should if possible be on a voluntary basis. With this the C.-in-C. India agreed in his telegram No. 18107/G of November 17th. We have, however, seen reports to the effect that the Persian Government are finding it impossible to abandon conscription owing to the failure of their efforts to recruit volunteers. (You will see that the Government of/of India propose to take great .care lest their • propaganda should increase the Persian Government’s difficulties in this respect). 3. On the whole we feel that the proposal is a useful one and that, if it is agreed by the Departments here and by Bullard (to whom the Government of India’s telegram was repeated), it might be approved. Point 3, however, seems to us dangerous and likely to wound Persian vanity; and on this account we feel that it might be omitted. Point 4, on the other hand, might % in present circumstances produce valuable results. An additional point which has been suggested here is that the proposed propaganda theme might refer to the Indian Army and to the fact that recruitment in India is wholly on a voluntary basis. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Law at the Ministry of Information and to* Dinwiddle at the Y/ar Office for any observations they may wish to offer. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PEELExternal D epartment. Please see 'if,8. Pile 14089 Flap A.B.C.D. - “^le C.-in-C. originally proposed a well-paid voluntary force (AX.in SeptemberIn November, C.-in-C. reported (b) that the Persian General staff intended to maintain the system of conscription but to raise forces of volunteers to tide over the time required for the reorganisation of the Army, and that the Assembly were considering a law to increase the pay of all ranks. To this the War Office replied, with Foreign Office concurrence, that, subjectto concurrence of C.-in-C. and H.M. Ambassador, Army should be better paid and if possible on a voluntary basis. C.-in-C. agreed (d). We are not aware whether any further action has been taken, but it may have been left until the problem of a military advisory staff has been solved. From the Government of India telegram, however, it appears that the Persian General Staff have not yet abandoned conscription, probably, as you suggest, because there is not a sufficient number of volunteers. Of the points suggested, No. 3 appears to be dangerous and likely to offend the Persians. We agree that the Foreign Office must be consulted, and would like the War Office also kept informed. In any case, action on the lines proposed should, we feel, be undertaken only in the closest co-operation with H.M. Minister at Tehran.r Copy.

There was no question of their being held in the open. 2. Prom Khorramshahr, however, Ft.M. Vice Consul reports that for the first time for several years crowds assembled in the mosques to mourn the death 'of Imam Ali. The local police did not interfere and the Vice Consul adds that this indication of less interference in religious matters has been widely welcomed. 3. Whatever the Government of India may say about the toleration of processions, I regard any revival of religious demonstrations however orderly as the thin - .

Accordingly and bearing in mind the view xpressed in the second paragraph of Foreign Office *el«fpam to you Ho« 825 of Ifra..Ip^October I have oeen at pains to point out to the local authorities that £K*A w vj, supp ression of religious excesses was one of the M,k****&amp;* benefits of the old regime and that it will be , . better for everyone if the mullaliS are kept where the auTifktfwMbc ^oid ghah put them. tetfcMMjL 4 ‘ A case in point has arisen at Shushtar.

The position is that under the International Sugar Agreement India is debarred from exporting sugar by land. She has obtained a release from her obligation in respect of the year 1941 for sugar bought in India by H.M.G. She will have to apply for a further release in respect of 1942* At present negotiations are in progress for the purchase of a large quantity of Indian sugar by the Ministry of Food. It is intended to send much of this purchase to Persia because of the difficulty of providing shipping to lift Java sugar to/(0610) Wt.25956/236 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;B.W.Ltd. Gp.685 to the Persian Gulf. The idea now proposed involves only atfout one ton of sugar and I imagine that in order to get round the terms of India’s release from the Convention it v/ill he bought by the Government of India on behalf of the British Legation at Tehran. You may like to know that the sugar position in Persia is that after many months during which there were no imports (apart from anything which the Russians may have sent in), 26,000 tons are now either on their way from Java or are about to be loaded. It is proposed to provide shipping for a further 14,000 tons. These arrangements should effectively deal with the present shortage. As regards the future however our ability to provide Persia with sugar largely depends on the success of the current negotiations in India because of the difficulty of shipping Java sugar. I assume that you v/ill send to the Ministry of Pood and the U.K.C.C. copies of your letter to the Foreign Office.^ * FlLic.

Prime Minister’s broadcast speech to the nation (see m y teleg ram No- 9A.6 to Foreign Office repeated to Government of I ndia telegram N o. 769) has been received with sympathy as a statement of the individual’s duty to respect justice and society, if the interi$oi.conditions of the c ountry are to prosper. His speech stressed that all difficulties in Persia’s domestic theatre could be traced eventually to individual slackness of respect for justice and society. ['R 1 ’ ends]. His theme could be used to great advantage in forthcoming Persian broadcasts from London by pointing out that the danger which the Prime Minister asked the Persians to face in their own country is exactly the danger which the Allies and America are facing and fighting in Europe; that is the tyranny of those who have seized power and who have refused to recognise individual rights and duties. It is not desirable to suggest that conditions in Persia are very bad or that the late Shah was entirely an evil influence, but rather that these difficulties, that have been and are being, experienced in Persia [grp. undec.] from individuals in society refusing to recognise their duties to justice and society and that it is fundamentaUy this evil, though on a gigantic scale, against which the Allies are fighting in Europe.

No one denied this but in general people applied the law to others but, considered -;hemselves outside the law. As a result all deprived of security. Therefore, the first principle he would lay down, tnat free people that one whose afiairs governed in accordance wi’ch lav/, thus, anv- one v/ho v/ent against^ the law was an enemy of freedom, ^ iMat ddTdsatian lay in railways, factories, asphalted, streets, as many of his listeners no doubt imagined, said, civilisation lay in education of people and respect la ^ which conditions if observed with them brought these^things. Mentioning briefly three t^nes of govern ment dictatorship,^oligarchy and democracy he stated that +i S x r n na •^ ^re inclined towards democracy. He recalled that Persia had government by people for 55 years but aup.ng these years the people seldom enjoyed' real freedom and respect fbr law. The reason was that they did not know the value oi this^blessing and did not carry out the responsibilities it involved. He reminded hearers that ? lgat ?^ roug r' t responsibilities whereas non-fulfillment brought retribution* In enumerating the responsibilities classes he suated that tne people's responsibility is to choose their representatives and once chosen, control their acnons, placing public interest before personal. Deputy s duty, to exercise care in the execution of the law am not regard ofiics as means to achieve personal ambition: Ministers dutv oO regard themselves as executors o^ the law w c - £ the P^ 1 } 0 state; emplo yees 8 duty tn execute- journalists duty to guide the thoughts of the people; Ring s duty to preserve fundamental laws, watch over 21 state &gt; consider people as his children and so act towards tnem by v/orus and in actions, to be model to the people. Duties of all to speak and act nobly, failing which, affairs of state v/ould not prosper. All classes must co-operate, because c^-^ity of g overnment by people was discord. If ' tlcs _ n 2j observed and personal ambitions placed first, ' tl0 ? s f ae 35 years would return and not only would freedom be lost but country would be destroyed. If people had learnt lesson of experience it could be hoped that these days were over and better days to oon.e. Expressed hope that young ohah ana people would prove themselves.

My telegram No 0 710 repeated only to Government of India. Having heard my views on this pro-Axis article through the Minister for War to whom they had been passed by Military Attache, the Shah sent word that he was very angry about the article about which‘he assured me the Court had no previous knowledge. That this is a lie is established by good evidence besides being confirmed by the Prime Minister. 2. The Prime Minister summoned me this evening to tell me that Majlis intended to propose probably on Saturday 15th that reforms be introduced; He thinks the Shah will probably accept but that nobody will be able to work the mandate with confidence since they will be certain that the Shah will obstruct and wait for revenge. The Prime Minister says that he knows the Shah was unpopular but he has been astounded at the flood of hatred directed against him from everywhere, and that his retention of the Throne has caused deep disillusionment throughout the country* All my evidence goes to show that this is true„v^- 6 w*' PILE. tiK ' Com|,nTO i i 6—^— of the ^ndap' ^ocretary of B**®® (V^ v*/» Foreign Affair^ '2 .^J* lL(A^Jy^j -/jU. y] 9 o 1 &gt; *' 19A1 -Mer-* ^ e i e ^ raI ? ^fP ar ticular secrecy and ^. r /^ / L should be retained by the authorised recipient b^ST? and not Pa-ssed on]. r ^ ^ [Cypher].

Second of 2 parts. r r (3) Prime Minister is convinced that the Shah must go if any reiorm is to be effected: even if he were honest he is too limited in outlook to ' work any system but his own. Continuation of our broadcasts would in the end get rid of the Shah but they should go deeper. Mention of the late Minister of ,far had had excellent effect but there were nunareds of men in prison without cause shown— perhaps merely because the Shah wanted their land. + u (4 2 P™} 6 Minister said that he thought that with the control to which he would inevitably have to submit Crown Prince would do as a ruler at any rate for a time, If the Crov/n prince decided to leave with his father perhaps one of yipunger sons would do. He did not seem at all worried at the prospect of having to rind substitute and this in a sick man was good to see. It must be remembered however that the Prime Minister a nd his Cabinet have accepted our heavy terms while saddled Virith the Shah and that the prospect of .ii? 6 without the Shah seems easy whatever the difficulties. • • V considerq^thp°qhnh be to find anyone now who c.nsijers the Shah can be reformed.

Official notice published Tehran September 13th that by order of His Imperial Majesty the price of bread reduced to 2 krans per 3 kilogrammes. 2. [grp. undec. ? raw material] for Persian broadcast. Reduction m price of bread good thing in principle, but by what constitutional right does the Shah give such orders? Is he paying the difference in price himself? Not at all, apparently poor bakers pay it. When did the Shah give anybody anything from his own pocket? At what price does he sell his rice to monopoly? Let him reduce the price of rice at his own expense. ' Ia. Hu/vvr f f*(*&amp;,X. i tojiU Mil A v\(Ats* uTMrfv ^ iKaJ' ^4, 8 • &amp; • C. fydsLi.
