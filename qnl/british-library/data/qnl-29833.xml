Uhile in Turkey she received regularly remittances for her maintenance via Bombay. Since coming here she has received only one remittance and nothing since March last. She has telegraphed to His Highness the Sultan but has received no reply. I have been asked to make enquiries and to cause remittances to be made.

The lady is registered with the Consulate-General, as a British protected person, and it has been ascertained that her son was in fact a pupil at the English High School in Istanbul from September, 1989, to June, 1932. I am to request that I may be furnished with your ob servations on the letter and with material for an eventual reply.

Your obedient Servant, (Secretary) The Political Agent, Muscat.(translation) 23/5/1940 © \o Istanbul onsulate-Qeneral ' I am the wife of Seyit it Bin Timur, ex sultan of Maskat. Separated from ray husband, I lived for years in Istanbul with my son Tarik Bin Timur, and devoted my life solely to his education and upbringing. In order that he might learn English and have the^bringing essential for his future, I sent my son to the Istanbul English school. But because of illness he was obliged to go to Germany on the doctor's recommendation. Despite this, I never for a moment forsook my efforts to bring up my son as a person / of use to his country. His father left ray son's education to me from childhood, and when my son was eight years old confirmed this in writing. To bring him up I resigned myself to great sacrifices. I was obliged to spend my health, future, and fortune on this goal and did this willingly. As my son grew up, it became necessary for him to learn the conditions and customs of his country. Ks brother Sultan Seyit ait begged me to allow ray son to visit his country on condition lat his education continued uninterrupted. I considered it a more humane and fitting move to accept his brother's wise request despite the proposals made to me by my own or the German Government to ensure his proper education and upbringing. Trusting what was said to me by the person who came on behalf of his brother, I decidec to send him to Iviaskat to visit his father and learn the language. At the moment my son has been nearly 3 years with his brother. Though I receive news of my son’s health from Sultan Seyit Sait, unfortunately I have had no word from himself for 9 months, and for this reason am tormented with anxiety, and in agony of spirit. As a mother who has devoted her life and everything she has to bring up her son as a respectable person, I believe you will appreciate my unbearable, insupportable, anguish. I feel very greatly the fact that ray son is growing up and so deprived of education....education. Accordingly, for Ms education and upbringing, I beg your good offices to send him anywhere you think fit, e.g. bondon, ano send me news of his health. Since I know that for him the wish of the British Government is an order, I hope that Government will take into consideration my request as that of a poor mother who lost all she had for her son, and I expect you as a gentleman to keep my request secret . It is natural for a mother who has bound her health and future to her son f s happiness to try everything. For this reason, I beg you to know that I am in a state of great anxiety concerning your eagerly awaited report of the acceptance of my request for the completion of my son’s education and send my deepest regards.

VConfidential D.0.No. C/444. U4-) August 15th, 1940. /tea* 4 - ZotsUL, At an interview on ttie 12th August the Sultan asked me for my advice regarding his two brothers Tarik and fahr. 2. Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur was born at Istanbul in 1920*21 and is nineteen years of age. His mother is a Turkish lady who left Germany shortly after the outbreak of this war and has now taken up herzesidence in Turkey. Tarik was edu cated in Turkey until he was twelve years old and then until he came to Muscat in 1937 in Germai^y at Frankfurt where he lived. Leaving the cinemas and restaurants of Frankfurt for the ^adhis, heat and floors of Muscat must have seemed a very poor exchange. He found himself compelled to live according to his brother’s ideas of what was right and proper and does not take kindly to walking backwards out of his brother's presence and generally behaving as the young relative of an Arab Ruler is expected to. His allowance is &amp; 60/* a month which for a youth of nineteen with 'Western' ideas in the position that Tarik holds is insufficient. Tarik is of average height and light in colour but over heavy for his age. The Sultan told me that he had pro nounced Nazi ideas when he came here from Germany and although his views have moderated he still has leanings towards National Socialism. He is lazy and self willed and pays not the slight est attention to any one except his brother the Sultan. Last year he was sent to Sur to learn something; of the tribes and their management from the astute Wali, Saud bin Ali. It seems that he did no work there and paid no heed to the instructions of the Vvali but spent his time in such amusement/ as were possible. His Highness said that no official of the Statw could forget that Tarik was his brother and therefore might one day rule so that they were all afraid to exercise any control over him. The Sultan had hoped that he would be able in time to rely on his brother for assistance in the govern ment of the country but he is afraid that he will never be able to do so unless there is a very definite change for the better in the young man's outlook and behaviour. Tarik is unmarried and has* no* desire to marry a girl that he has never seen, so that his choice of a*bride is limited to such Bedouin tribes as the Ahl Whahiba. Unfortunately an alliance between the Ahl Vhahiba and the Ahl Bu Said would prove expensive for the latter as there would always be a number of avaricous Bedouin visiting Tarik in search of money and food, and the 6ultan does not take kindly to paying money for nothing. We have, you will see, to deal with a young man of mixed parentage and even more mixed education who knew nothing of Arabia and Islan until three years ago. He was 'Western' then and now is still more 'Western' than 'Eastern'. 3. I have advised His Highness to send Tarik out to the The Hon'ble Lieut. Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* Camp Shiraz .* - 2 * what Levy when Pettyfer return, and I t his lead an open air life with plenty of exercise for six months* He will be freer than he is at present and will be looked after by a man who has no personal •&lt; concern with the State and who will deal firmly but tactfully with him. He will have an opportunity later of showing if he is capable of taking responsibility and if Pettyfer gives periodical reports on him to His Highness it will be possible to see how he is shaping and plan the future accordingly. His Highness is in favour of my proposal and will probably put it into execution on Pettyfer’s return. I have spoken to Pettyfer about the matter and he is t^uite prepared to take Tarik in hand and try and see, if anything, he has in him. 4 # The case of Fahr bin Taimur is very different but no easier. This boy is 14 years of age and is of Arab descent on both his father abd his mother’s side. He always has been lazy and I gather he was when younger a nomal town bred Arab. For some years he was taught by Ismail bin .Khalil ar Rassasi, the present Governor of ttatrah. Rassasi himself is a man of pecu liar habits and X cannot believe that his influence and teaching scholastic and moral can have been all that could be desired. For some reason the Sultan decided to send the boy to a school in Baghdad. He has now been there for four years and seems to have wested his time very successfully. He has been three years in the Fourth primary standard and as the Sultan himself said would have been superannuated long ago if he had been an Iraqi boy. The out of school life in a big town like Baghdad where he seems to move about with perfect freedom and little or no supervision cannot be good for an Arab boy at the difficult age of fourteen. 5 # We discussed Fahr at length and I advised the Sultan to bring the boy bacx to Muscat as soon as possible v/here he would be under supervision and would not be subject to any political influence. His education must not be neglected and I said I would write to schools in India under European manage ment, they are mentioned in the Indian political Service List, and enquire their terms. The boy is a younger son and the Sultan does not wish to s^cnd fis 3,500/- year on his school fees alone. This being the sum that the Mayo College Ajmer charged when the Sultan himself was there. A further compli cation is that as Fahr only speaks Arabic and a little English he will have to have a special tutor. The Sjiltan had Khan Bahadur Siddiq Hasan, G.B.E., when he was at the Mayo College. The Sultan is much in favour of the boy going to an Indian school as he does not favour schools in Arab States since he dislikes the advanced political opinions which are often held by masters and students alike in those institutions. The Sultan agreed to what I had suggested and also to my sugjgc tion that I should seek your advice on the question. 6. As regards tuiis younger boy I suggest that it would be an excellent scheme for us to follow the German and French examples and ensure that the boy was educated up to our way of thinking. The only way to do this would be to enter the boy at a school where the masters are to a large extent English and where he would be in close association with them. The most suitable place would be the Mayo College, Ajmer and I suggest that the Sultan be offered a Government scholarship there for his brother, that is the Government pay the tuition and board feesfees at the school* I thinic that the Sultan would be very pleased to accept such an offer and would himself provide his brother with a suitable tutor» probably Khan Bahadur Sid&amp;&lt;l Hasan, O.B.E., If this scheme were carried out the result would be that the present Ruler would be in our debt and we should have a close relative of the Sultan, possibly even his heir, who had been brought up to respect English traditions. Naturally I have not discussed this suggestion with the Sultan.Telegram From To No. Dated £ TELEGRAM. - 'Q« - Political Resident, Shiraz • Political Agent, Muscat. - T 316. - August 27th,1940.

Please refer to your Vice-Principal’s letter of the 23rd August 1940 and to the correspondence which you have had with the Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E. I have now t received instructions to correspond direct with you with regara to the entrance of Saiyid Fahr bin Taimur into the Mayo College. A 2. Much as the Sultan would have liked i is half brother to have entered the college in October this year, I am afraid it was really quite impossible. The boy was still in Baghdad in September and I was myself on tour at Gwadur and unable to get into touch with the Sultan. The Sultan is anxious that Saiyid Fahr should join the college at the end of the Christmas holidays and if you are prepared to accept him y then will you please let me know as soon as possible on what date he should be present. 3. The Sultan has asked whether it will be possible on j payment of additional charges for his half brother to be under - your personal supervision and whether it would be possible for him to reside in your house. He tells me that there was such a practice when he himself was a student at the college. Colonel Prior has informed that the terms so far agreed are Rs. 968/- annually and I would be glad to know what percentage j of this amount will be owing for the remainder of the school year. 4. The Sultan has drawn my attention to page 23 of your prospectus and has asked whether his brother could take some of the special subjects and enquired what subjects it would be desirable for him to study. I told the Sultan that it seemed that the special subjects were part of the school curriculum but I would ask you to let me know in due course if Saiyid Fahr showed any aptitude for any particular subject.

The Sultan was not at the College in my time, hut I met him soon after I came here and he has stayed twice with my wife and myself. I shall he very glad to have his half brother next term which begins on 20th January 1941. The hoy should join one day earlier. 3 . I should like to have him living with me, hut my accommodation is limited and I already have 3 hoys living with me. I once had 4 hoys hut two of them were brothers who shared the same room. My English Staff are also full up. Apart from the consideration of avoidirg additional expenditure I think he will he perfectly alright j2 in the Tonk House which has been considerably improved in every way since the oultan lived there. The house is quite close to my house so that I will he able to keep a close eye on the boy without any difficulty and have him to my house frequently. If His Highness however is particularly anxious that the boy should live with me I will see what can ba done. 4. As regards the School fees, these are an annual charge, but as the boy will join at the beginning of the second half-year half the amount of Ps. 9 68 /- will be chargeable in this academic year. I trust this will suit you. 5. With regard to the special activities shown on page 23 of the Prospectus these are features of the regular curriculum and the boy will choose subjects in turn in accordance with his particular aptitude. Some of these activities you will understand are more suitable for senior than for junior boys and this will be borne in mind in helping the boy to choose which to take first.

No. C/450. Muscat, the 9th August, 1941. Please refer to my demi-official letter No. C/444, dated the 15th August, 1940. 2. The Sultan is not satisfied with the progress that Saiyid Fahr is making at the Mayo College and it has been difficult to persuade him to allow the boy to stay there for another six months so that both the school and Fahr can have reasonable time to see what, if anything, they can make of each other. His Highness has now consulted me about the future since he feels the Mayo College experiment must result in failure as his half brother is so very stupid. He suggests Fahr should enlist in the Indian Army and serve for at least the duration of the war, alternatively he suggests that it may be possible for Fahr to be accepted at a military training establishment in India. As the boy, although physically well developed, is only just fifteen years of age I have told His Highness that the idea of enlistment is not feasible at present even if there were no question of * % nationality and that if Fahr was as stupid as he reputed to be the entrance examination to a military training establishment would effectively bar any progress in that direction. 3. At a second interview the Sultan again raised the question and I said I would seek your advice. It would / always be The Hobble Lt.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.always be possible to send Fahr to Bait-al-Falaj but it would not be wise to make the Levy a 'Concentration Camp' for members of the Family. Another alternative is some form of technical training at Bahrain and should military service or training in India be out of the question then His Highness favours this course and I have promised to write to him a note after visiting Bahrain on my way to Kuwait.transmit to you berev/it’a, for such action as may be necessary, a oo^y of a letter addressed to His Majesty f s Cpnsul-General at Istanbul by Madame Kamile Ilgiray, yrfiose correspondence with her son Sayid Tarik bin TaimUr formed the subject of your despatch No. 0/412^ of the 2nd August, 1940. 2. As you are aware, Madame Ilgiray is registered with His Majesty f s Consulate-General at Istanbul as a British protected person, and dir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen would be grateful for your observations on the request contained in the enclosed letter for an increase, at her son f s expense, of £10 (presumably per month) in the pension which she has apparently been receiving from His Majesty f s Government through the intermediary of the Government of Muscat.

The British Consulate-General, Istanbul. Sir, I ain very sorry to be again troubling your goodselves, but, as this is entirely a problem of living, I hope you will excuse me, and, giving your kind considera tion, see that my following petition is carried out. At the time my son. Prince Tarik, left here, it was promised by the man who came to fetch him, Mr. Abdul- minim-al-Zavani, a trade representative of the Muskat Govern ment, that the salary due him would not be cut, but 'he paid to me every three months (i.e. March, June, September and December), making £45 at £15 per month. After his departure in July, 1937, I have received this promised amount only once As for the remaining months, there came £30, at £10 per month I do not know whether it is my right or not, and, if it is, to what extent, to receive these payments from the Muskat Government, but have been taking them as a gift. Of course, a gift cannot have a limit or measure. For this gift I am very, very grateful to the Muskat Government, as it has helped my living. However, as you know, this much money in these days, even for a very humble living, will not be enough. So, up to the present, I have been selling precious articles of my property, in order to make the two ends meet with wh&amp;t your Government has so kindly been giving me. If my health had permitted me, I would not have been ashamed to work for a living, and would not have bothered either you or my son. But, as a result of the haruships I have suffered in order to bring up rn# son properly, I have trouble in blood circu lation and a heart disease. Nov/, there is no more property to sell, but, thanks to God, my son is now of age and can look after his mother. For this reason, I beg of you to add to my income £10 more out of my son’s salary (only) and make sure its continuance. After this much has been in creased, I shall only have been able to put my head above v/ater. I would appreciate it very much if you would kxxi kindly in your reply, let me know my son^ health and his address, as for the last five months I have received no news from him whatever. Also if possible, a large photograph of him would make me very happy and grateful to you all ray life. Av/aiting a reply from your goodselves, I am, Yours very respectfully, KAMILE ILGIRAY P.S. in case of a remittance, please use the following address: C/o Fezci Biraderler Galata Dantibsigorta Han, 4nctl kat No. 29. Telegraphic address: Fezci, Istanbul.CONFIDENTIAL. Political Agency, Muscat September 1st, 1941. From Captain J.B. Hov/es, Political Agent, Muscat To The Secretary, British Embassy, Angora. Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter No.407/2/41, dated the 15th July, 1941, which forwarded a copy of a letter dated the 4th July, 1941, from Madame Kamile Ilgiray, and to say that I have discussed the question of the allowance paid to this U4f with His Highness the Sultan. He informs me that Saiyid Tarik was formerly in receipt of an allowance of £. 15 per mensem on which he and his mother lived. Since his return to Muscat £. 10 per mensem has been remitted to his mother, and he is paid £. 5 plus his salary as an officer in the Muscat Levy Corps. 2. It would assist me in taking up the question again with the State if confidential enquiries could be made about Madame Kamile Ilgiray^ actual financial position, and. I coaid be informed of the result. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant, P 0 litical Agent, Muscat fSince Saiyid Pahr is only just fifteen, it is obvious that the idea of enlistment is not practicable even if it were advisable, and I think that the best course for the present is for him to continue his education at the Mayo College* if the boy is as stupid as His Highness thinks, it is most unlikely that he would be accepted at a military training establishment in India, but it is possible that I might be able to arrange for him to be taken as a cadet in the forces of some Indian State, say Alwar, where he could receive military training as soon as he has reached a suitable age. It would then be possible for him either to return and undertake military work in Muscat, or else to apply to join the Hyderabad State Forces who have a number of Arabs in their army. 2* The Technical School at Bahrain is somewhat of a misnomer, since at present it only’ teaches boys blacksmith and carpenters’ work with a little training as mechanics. I do not think it would be at all suitable for Saiy’id Fahr and none of the al Khalifa have so far contemplated sending their sons to it. i fear that all that can be done for the present is to suggest to His Highness that Saiyid Fahr remains at the Mayo College at any rate until the conclusion of the present school year, and that his future career should be reconsidered, after we have seen what progress he makes.

I am directed by His Majesty’s Ambassador to transrnTt^Herewith a memorandum on this lady’s financial position by the British Vice-Consul at Istanbul. His Excellency concurs in Mr. Page’s observa tions and considers that in view of the high and increa sing cost of living in Turkey a person of Mme. Ilgiray’s standing would require at Istanbul at the present time a monthly income of approximately £ 25&gt; i.e. £ 15 per month more than she is apparently receiving at present. 2. Mr. Page also states that Mme. Ilgiray expressed great distress at the lack of news from her son, from whom she had not heard for over a year. If you see no ob jection I should be grateful if His Highness Prince Tarik could be informed accordingly, and if the enclosed letter from Lime. Ilgiray could be conveyed to him # His Excellen cy considers that in the circumstances there would be no objection to a letter from His Highness to Lime.

Bhe stated that her minimum requirements were two rooms and these, in addition to food and clothing, could not be obtained at less than £kiO sterling a month. Her illheaith also compelled her to incur certain expenditure. 4 . it would seem that the lady^ estimate of her financial requirements is far from exaggerated. At the favourable rate of exchange sterling represents about £T. 145 a month. To meet the cost of living in Turxey to-day this sura is obviously insufficient for a person of her standing.

Sir, 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 407/4/41, dated 8th November last, and to thank you for the trouble which you have taken in this matter. It is probably a clerical error when you write that Madame Ilgiray^ pension is received from His Majesty^ Government; it is, of course, paid by the Muscat State. 2. The Sultan has been away for several weeks, and it was only yesterday that I got an opportunity to have an interview with him on this subject. He then stated categorically that Madame Ilgiray has no claim at all on the revenues ^f the Muscat State, as she was divorced by her ex-husband, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, the former Sultan of Muscat and father of the present Sultan. She did, however, receive an allowance for the years during which her son, Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur, was a minor and was living under her care. This allowance was, strictly speaking, not hers bpt Saiyid Tari^s, as an heir male of Saiyid Taimur. After Saiyid Tarik returned to Muscat, a part of this allowance was still remitted to her, and a part given to Saiyid Tarik; but the Sultan emphasized to me that she has no legal claim on the State. 3. He has now decided to regularize the position by paying the whole allowance direct to Madame Ilgiray's son, Saiyid /■ . '•*** fT f ASaiyid Tarik, who is tine only person reaLlly entitled to receive it. This will take effect from July 1st, and Madame ~ U Ilgiray’s banker’s order at Ankara will be stopped from that date. It will then be left to her son, Saiyid Tarik, to send her privately v^hatever money lie may wish to send. 4* It is impossible to find fault with this attitude of the Sultan’e, and the new position will have the advantage of leaving the responsibility for Madame Ilgiray'e maintenance v» — th her son, who may be expected to feel this responsibility more closely than the Sultan. Under the present arrangement, he regards her maintenance as the responsibility of the State, which it is, strictly speaking, not.

I have been asked by the Muscat Government to address you regarding Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur who should arrive at the Police Training School as soon as transpolk is available for him from here. The fact is that His Highness the Sultan’s Representative here who is looking after Saiyid Tarik, does not trust him to behave prudently regarding the spending of money, particularly on clothes and the like. Accordingly^ he requests me to ask you if yoq^would be so good as to have made for Saiyid Tarik such cjxothes as he requires for his training and games etc. and also if you would order for him any necessities for his work at the Training School. The Muscat Government would pay the bill for any amounts spent by you on this account. 2 . I am afraid this is rather asking a lot of you but if you could see your way to doing it I shall be grateful as I am sure that it would be to the best interests of those concerned.

' Ordinarily he would have gone straight into ^'the Officers Hess and it would have been a simple matter to have given you immediately the financial commitment involved in such a method of dealing with him. As it happened however the Hess was not available, and we were lucky indeed when the Collector Khan Bahadur sheriff • Ahmad All Sahib very kindly put him up until the end of December as his.guest. The Hess became available from the 1st of this month, but only one member of the Service, an Assistant Superintendent of Police attached to the C.I.D. is in residence. Saiyed Tarik also went into the Hess on the 1st and the A.S.P. and he are the two solitary members in residence. Now that the question of his accommodation and lodging has resolved itself, I can give you some details regarding the financial side. The attached statement shows what 1 consider are his minimum requirements in the matter of clothing needed for parades « and games. (I have not put in anything for his private mufti, but he seems to have come provided with this, purchased as he says, in Bombay.) Of the items of clothing and equipment, I have marked those which I have already paid for, or intend paying for, out of school funds as an advance. Thes^ 'payments are in the nature of non-recurring charges. Recurring monthly expenditure is as follows: Mess rent.' ...

I find that I asked the Principal of the Police Training School, Vellore last December for a report on his character and conduct. I have now reminded the Principal. Saiyyid Tarlk's course of training finishes in September next. The Sultan spoke to me about this and said he would like him to remain in India for another year to gain some administrative experience. I promised to see what could be done but confess I feel somewhat barren of practical suggestions. I cannot imagine that any Provincial Government would let loose our half-Turk on a helpless peasantry in any governmental capacity — auch as giving him charge of a police-station or civil sub-division. In either case they would not agree The Hobble Lieut.-Col. C.G. Prior, C.I.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,■■■■■■■■■■■■ - 2 - agree to taking a nan into service for a year.

Please refer to your D.O. letter No.P/41-9, dated the 20th June 1943, concerning the progress made by Said Fahr, younger brother of the Sultan of Muscat. The boy has made very useful progress since he has been at the College, but he is very far from having reached ‘— a standard which would bring admission into a military train ing centre within the bounds of possibility. He is now, I believe, aged seventeen, and he will be promoted at the beginning of next term, in July, into our Fourth Class, which will mean, that if he continues his present rate of progress, he would sit for the Cambridge School Certificate in Dec: 1947. His Bnglish is very weak, which is hardly surprising, considering that he was sent to the College at the age of something like fifteen and arrived knowing not one single word of either English or Urdu: This weakness has of course been a great handicap to him in all his other subjects. Physically he is powerful, clumsy, inclined to grossness - no goodkt games, but a plucky trier. * I am writing from Kashmir without the opportunity of referring to files, and I cannot remember to whom we sent Said Fahr’s progress report; if it was not to Colonel Prior, and if he would like a copy, will you please let me knov/. 1/ Copy of demi-official letter No.703-S dated 31st July 1943 from the Hon*ble Lieut.-Col.

He has agreed that for purposes of status and training, Saiyid Tsrik would be regarded as a Wing Officer and be treated, in every respect as a British officer of the same status. As regards uniform, Sir Aubrey thimts he could wear che Militia uniform which is very simple and can be made on his arrival at Fort Sandeman. For Mess and other occasions, when a more formal uniform is necessary, 3«iyid Tarik could wear his own Muscat Levy uniform if he so desired. His pay would of course be his own affair, or that of the Sultan, and we have ascertained that the minimum monthly sum which Saiyid Tarik would require to keep up Ills position in the Corps (he would of course live vtiatfcxfi in the Mess) would be not less than Rs. 700/- p.m. or to be on the safe side Rs. 800/~ p*m. 3.

He tells me tliat he v.'ishes to leave the 2hob Militia when he has completed six months - with them, i.e. about the beginning of June, spend two months in attachment to a regular unit and then return to Muscat. 3. If the above programme is approved, I could take up the question of his attachment to a regular unit direct with the G-O.C. Baluchistan District. 4. If the Government of India would prefer me to to settle details regarding Saiyid Tarik’s future in direct correspondence with Prior would they kindly instruct me accordingly. 5. Saiyid Tarik appears to be doir^’ very well with the ^hob Militia and is popular with all classes at Fort Sandeman. He started to learn Pushtu and the Commandant is disappointed that he has now given this up. The reason presumably is that he has made up his mind tiiat he wishes to return to Muscat. 6.

His Highness mentioned to me, just before I left Salal&amp;h, that Saiyid Tarik was due to complete his yea^s training with the Zhob Militia towards the end of October, and that he had decided that he would like, in due course, to try him out as Ministar for External Affairs about March next year in place of his uncle Saiyid Shahab ( I have written to you separately on this subject)* 3. Before doing this, however, he would like Saiyid Tarik to undergo some form of Secretariat training, if possible, from the date he finishes in the Zhob Militia until about March 1945 i.e. five months approximately* The Sultan, at my suggestion, had intended discussing this with Sir Geoffrey Prior during his visit to S&amp;lalah, but of course he cannot do so now that the visit has been postponed. I confess I am rather barren of suggestions and all 4 I could think of was the I.C.S.

Saiyid Tarik was In receipt of an allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem from the State in 1937 (vide page 165 of File VTII/B-15 - Vol.I, which is placed below) and it would seem from the last sentence of paragraph 2 of letter at page 13 that this allowance has not been increased since He is sending about Rs. 137 to his mother out of his allowance of Rs. 200 and he could not possibly make her allowance more than what it is at present unless H.H. increases his allowance. May this be marked for discussion at your next interview with H.H. please ?

Present allowance is part of what used to be paid to Saiyid Tarik, when he was a minor and living with her. I said to His Highness that present position reflected adversely on State, i.e. if it gave an allowance at all, its credit required that it should be adequate.
