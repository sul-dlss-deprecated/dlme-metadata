Dear Sir, r Under Article I of the Original Lease dated December 29, 193^? between His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Company, and the Deed of Further Modification dated June 19, 19^-0, Article *+, Para (b), the Company is granted the right to use radio communication in their operations. '2- I understand that, in accordance with the Final Acts of the International Tele-communication and Radio Con ferences held in Atlantic City in 19^7? the radio frequencies employed in any operations must, from January 1, 19^-9^ be registered with the International Frequency Registration Board, :^ v which have their headquarters at Geneva, Switzerland. The allocation and registration of frequencies are, I understand, handled by the appropriate Government Departments of a Member Country of the International Tele-communication Union. In this case I presume that such allocation and registration will be handled by His Majesty's Government for the Bahrein Govern ment . At the present time the Company communication with their exploration field parties is carried out on frequencies of 3287 and 6575 kc/s but these frequencies are also used by the Arabian American Oil Company who are, I am informed, requesting registration of these frequencies for their use through Saudi Arabian Government channels. ^ In the near future, the Company's exploration activities will increase and for this purpose additional radio equipment will be needed and has already been ordered. The operating frequencies, however, have not yet been specified except in fairly wide bands in the frequency spectrum. ^ The radio communications system which is anticipated will consist of a Base Station at Awali and, in the initial stages of the exploration work, Mobile Stations installed on launches. The Mobile Stations will later be used at off shore drilling locations at fixed points for periods of several monthsV 1 n* No. C/PA-329. - 2 - 18th April, 19^-8 It is intended that all stations will operate (transmit and receive) on a common frequency at any one time but two frequencies, fairly widely separated, are required to take care of changes in seasonal and day and night conditions. From the foregoing, it will be observed, the class of service in which the frequencies will be employed do not fall in the definition of either a Fixed or Mobile Service and I believe that request should be made for Special Service. L The proposed stations are shown in the following tabulation which. I believe, includes all the information necessary to make the necessary application.

The increased exploration work contemplated by the Company is scheduled to start in September 19^+5, but in order that the Company may obtain the required crystals to control the operating frequencies for the equipment now on order, it is requested that the allocation be made as soon as possible.

His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, The Agency, Manama, Dear Sir, As discussed with you in our conversation yesterday, I wish to advise that the Company will install an electronic survey aid for use in their seismograph reconnaissance of water covered areas. The equipment for this survey aid is scheduled for delivery from England in June, 194-9# The system itself consists essentially of a radio transmitter, known as the master station, working on conjunction with two other radio transmitters controlled hy the master station and known as slave stations• ^ The request for the allocation of the frequencies on which these trans- /' mitters will operate was submitted in my letter No# PA-8S5 dated February 7th, 1949. In order to achieve the accuracy which such a system is capable of rendering it is desirable that the slave stations be situated at a distance from the master station which is greater than can be accomplished by confining them to Bahrein territory, and in order to cover the areas in which the Company is interested it is desired that the master station be situated in Bahrein, one slave station on Jezirat Farsi and the other slave station on the Qatar peninsula somewhere in the vicinity of Doha, preferably on the coast somewhere betx^en Doha and Umm Said, In addition to the radio transmitters it will be necessary to install temporary living quarters for the operating personnel, which will consist of two Europeans, an Indian cook and possibly two local employees. / Radio telephone coranmnication will also be necessary between Bahrein and these outlying stations and the Company^ request for an additional frequency for this purpose was contained in my letter No. PA-9A6 dated 26th February, 1949. We, therefore, request that permission be obtained to use these telephone channels. The Company will appreciate your early consideration and advice in this matter and your contacting those concerned as early as possible to^ ascertain their views on this subject and whether there will be any oojecoion to the Company leasing land in the areas indicated above for the erection of the radio stations and auxiliary facilities.

POLITICAL AGENCY, bahr;. in, Dated 20th March, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, Bapco want to install an electronic survey aid for use in their seismograph reconnaissance of water covered areas, and expect that the equipment wil^l te delivered in June next. The master station will be in Bahrain, but in order to achieve the accuracy of which the system is capable of it is desirable that two 'slave stations' consisting of radio transmitters controlled by the master station be sited at considerable distances. The most desirable sites for these are (1) Jezirat Farsi and (2) on the Qatar peninsula somewhere in the vicinity of Dohah, preferably on the coast between Dohah and Umm Said. In addition to the radio trar*smitters, it will be necessary to install at the 'slave stations' temporary living quarters for two European operators, an Indian cook, and possibly two local employees. Radio telephone communication will be necessary between Bahrain and the 'slave stations'. They have already asked for the al location of frequencies for these as well as for the trans mitters to be used in the electronic survey aid. They ask for cur assistance in obtaining leases of sites for their 'slave stations', 2, I do not think P.C.L. with their Head Office situated within the Bapco concession can very well object to Bapco 1 s leasing a site in Qatar, but perhaps before asking the Shaikh of Qatar to lease them one, I should confirm this from Lermitte by writing to say that I presume p .C.L. have no objection.

About two years ago when we erected a light beacon on Ifcrsi island the baudi Arabian Governaent protested i d the Persians have recently covered the island with inscriptions to the effect that it is Persian territory. In spite of thiBj I feel inclined to tell the Bahrain Petroleum Company that we have no objection to their establishing their station on tho island provided they come to terms with the shaikh of Kuwait, and that if the island is subsequently proved to belong to another power, they o tt or vacate it or pome to terms with that power. There will almost certainly be protests from the Saudi Arabian ^vemment a d po. sibly also traa the Persian Oorsmnent if *e allow the comptaiy to eetatlish personnel on the island i tut we o&amp;n answer these aid ti e more positive action we take to assert Kuwait's olain to t( o ifland the more likely is ttiat claim to 13000010 estahlished in the long run. 4.

Dear Sir, I would appreciate your kindness in forwarding to His Excellency, Sheikh 'Abdullah bin Jasim al Thani, at Dohar, the enclosed letter of the Bahrein Petroleum Company which sets forth the suggested terms of lease of property upon which the Company will erect a triangulation station. The letter was prepared at the request of His Excellency, expressed to representatives of the Company upon their recent visit to Dohar. At that time His Excellency also stated that payment of rents for the property must be in dollars because he said, the Bahrein Petroleum Company is an American Company and in America dollars are used. When our representatives told him that it is not possible to pay dollars and that the Company is not American, he replied that he knows it is American because the Political Agent had told him it was American. Representatives of the Company did not continue discussion of this matter further. His Excellency has obviously misunderstood the language of His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent.

This Electronic Survey Station is one of a series of such stations which will be used for the generation, by radio transmitters, of a set of stable standing wave patterns. These patterns form co-ordinates, in terms of which a launch, car or aeroplane provided with the necessary receiver can determine its geographic position with great accuracy at any time. The specific use in which these facilities will be employed by the Company is to determine the exact position of seismic events in the conduct of the Company^ Seismograph Survey of the Additional Area. This procedure will eliminate the tedious, and often inaccurate, visual survey methods now employed in this work and thus speed up the exploration of the Additional Area.

The company have replied that they cannot identify Fasht Al Jarah, but the places where they have been Conducting operations, except Arabi, are aithin the jurisdiction of the Bahrain Govern ment and that they are therefore passing on the Amir's letter, except for that part dealing with Arabi, to the Ruler of Bahrain. 2, Regarding Arabi, they have replied separately explaining the reason for their operations and saying that as the Bahrain Government do not claim the island they did not ask any sovereign's permission for its use, that they have no interest in its minerals, that it will require three weeks to remove their installations and that as they have no intention of furthering any claims to sovereignty or prejudice the rights of Ibn Saud they hope his Government will have no further objection to their temporary use of the island in order that they may com plete their survey.
