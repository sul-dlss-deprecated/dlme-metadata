The 10th of August, 1947 Dear Colonel galloway, T enclose a :ranslation of a statecaent broadcast by the Arabic Service, 3.B.C., on the 9 O 1 clocic news this morning, 10th of August, 1947. This 'news' appears to be grossly inaccurate, but is presumably based on the recent visit of the Shaiich of Kuwait to Riyadh, vou may perhaps thinX it worthwhile having tie inaccuracy of the statement made Known to the 3. 3. ^. \ r ours sincerely, The non'ble Lt-Col.

My Dear Donaldsnn, (- \&gt; • l^f^lose copy of a demi-official letter O .C/RS4, dated the 10th AugHst, 1947, from Ranee on the subject of a statement recently broadesst in the Arabic service of the B.B.C. The Shaikn or r^uwait is the only Persisn Gulf Ruler who has visited Ibn Saud recently and while it is iuito probable that the activities of Jews in Palestine and counter-measures were freely discussed (vide correstondence ^ ^ connected with Residency Printed Letter No.1356-S7^dated fZjHl i,; 1 - 1 1^47), you may wish to draw the attention oi the 1:0 the fact that the statement broadcast was far from accurate. The B.B.C. has a high reputation for the reliability of their broadcasts, and for them to broadcast news which in the area to which it relates is so obviously known to be inaccurate is damaging to this reputation. ^ours sincerely, 3d/- A.C.
