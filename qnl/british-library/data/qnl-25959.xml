By making the approach-we should thus again risk precipitating action by the Persian Government3) That if a Persian claim resulted from our action, and the arrears of taxation had to be paid before the completion . of - our troop withdrawal and the expiry of the Treaty, it would entail a heavy gold liability, , • j- l. The arguments for going ahead at once are:- 1) That until we have expressed our view to the Persian (rovernment, the Company remain exposed to-an accusation from the Persian Government, that-by omitting'to collect these taxes they have broken Persian law and have* infringed their concessionary obligation at all times to have regard to the rights, privileges, and interests of the Persian Government, Only by making some sort of declaration to the Persian Government can we supply the Company with a line of defence which they could quote if the Persian Government made trouble for them. What we have in mind is that at some future date an ill disposed • Government might wish to take the opportunity offered by the. Company's weak position in this matter to cancel or alter their concession, ... 2) That if we do not now make a declaration of our views to the Persian Government the company may well expect us to give them a guarantee that we shall indemnify them if the Persian Government ever make this claim on them. * 5* If after further consideration, and, if necessary, conulstations with the Company, you consider that the balance of advantage lies in approaching the Persian Government, I should be glad if you would now do so on the following lines:-. 6 6, You should inform them that since august, 1%1, petrol, oil and lubricants have been supplied to the British, Soviet and United States Forces in Persia by the iinglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, ^ It is understood that these products when supplied .to the .public are liable to certain taxes'levied by the Imperial Government, It is the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that, in view of the principle of international law that one Government should not levy taxation directly upon' another Government, and of the fact .that these products have been bought directly for the use of the allied Forces, and in connexion with the purpose for which they were stationed ? .in Persia, this taxation is not properly leviable on these supplies. You should state that His Majesty's Government have consulted the Soviet and : United States Governments and-understand that these Governments take the same view in respect of petroleum products supplied to the Soviet and United States Forces in Persia. You should’add thatj in view of these considerations, the three Governments have not m fact paid taxes on the petroleum products supplied to their Forces and that His Majesty'^s Government's object in making this statement now is to place the views of the three Governments on record, lest any misunderstanding as to the position should arise at some future date.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00013c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1095</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00013c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1095</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 6207/45 'Persian taxation of oil products supplied to the Allied Forces in Persia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-04T22:14:17</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 6; these numbers are written in pencil and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between the Foreign Office and HM Ambassador, Tehran, in which they discuss whether or not to approach the Persian Government regarding taxation on oil products supplied to the Allied Forces in Persia during the Second World War.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00013c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
