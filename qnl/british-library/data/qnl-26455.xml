(* -- CONFIDENTIAL. [E 8085/549/25] P.Z. .192 1940 December 22. 1939. Section 1. Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax .— {Received December 22.) (No. 169.) My Lord, Jedda, November 30, 1939. THE foreign policy of this country, that is to say, of Ibn Baud, has been fully dealt with in despatches written since my recent return from Riyadh, and a brief note on the armed forces of Saudi Arabia is being sent by this bag. I now have the honour to submit a short report on the internal situation, to round off the position of Saudi Arabia before leaving for another post. There is little in it that has not been said before in despatches from Jedda. 2. Few countries in the world can have a better record for the maintenance of law and order than Saudi Arabia has at the present time. The only crime of violence that I have heard of for months was a case of rape and murder, which was recently punished at Riyadh by the execution of three men in the public square. Theft and robbery continue to be punished with a Quranic severity which makes the immunity enjoyed by highly-placed embezzlers of public moneys rather repulsive. What is most remarkable is the complete suppression of the tribal raid and blood-feud. There is no evidence of the effect which this is having or may have in the long run. It may be suppressing feelings which will break out as soon as the hand of Ibn Sand is weakened or removed. It must be causing an increase of population, which sooner or later must find a livelihood outside the narrow limits of desert pasturage. The oil industry in Hasa will absorb a considerable number (I believe that it already employs over 2,000 workmen), and attempts are being made to utilise existing water supplies to better advantage and to find fresh ones, so that there may be a demand for more cultivators. How far the new opportunities for making a livelihood will keep pace with the expected growth in the population must be a matter of speculation. 3. I have reported more than once, as a matter for regret, the weakness of Ibn Sand’s regime in the matter of administration. The King is evidently a past-master in desert politics and in the maintenance of law and order even m places so unruly as Asir, and, in spite of his lack of personal experience of the outside world, he grapples with the problems of foreign policy with success. But he seems to have no conception of the importance of the revenue and finance side of the administration to the common people, and leaves that to inexperienced and venal officials, whose only unpardonable crime would be to keep the King short of money. In justice to the King, however, or to his officials, it must be recorded that he suggested in August that a National Bank (preferably British) should be established in this country to finance the operations of the Saudi Government and keep the currency stable; and that the threat of wai induced the authorities to promulgate certain financial measures which have had a beneficial effect upon the market in Jedda : the customs dues were reduced, as a temporary measure, by 20 per cent.; facilities were offered which enable the importer to store his goods without charge, and to postpone payment Ol the customs dues on them, until he can sell them; and the Government even offered to lend to importers, without interest, one-fifth of the cost of food-stufts ordeied from abroad The Government has also taken an interest in agriculture to the extent of obliging the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to search for water in various places for the Government, and bringing in Iraqi irrigation engineers to utilise the waters of the “bottomless ” wells of Khar] 100 miles or so from Riyadh. It will probably be found that people like the Minister of Finance Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, and the King’s family will have most of the new land but it is something that production has not been entirely forgotten m the deli Mi t of spending. The drafting of this despatch had just reached this point when news was received from Iraq that certain Iraqi cultivators, attracted by the reports from Kharj, had left for Saudi Arabia. It might have been better [780 y—A] k KI for the Saudi Government to develop the new land more slowly with their own people^ but Ibn Saud will have been flattered to find the tide of migration flowing back from the town to the desert. 4. Over a year ago I suggested that the gradual replacement of income from the pilgrimage by oil royalties, paid direct into a bank abroad by a foreign company, as the main item in the State revenue, should increase the independence of the crown, but this process has been interrupted by the war. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company are confident that the Hasa oil-field is going to be one of the most important in the world, and that it will not be long before Ibn Saud receives from it much more than he ever received from pilgrims, but the increase in the revenue from oil royalties, plus the lump sum received for the new concession granted to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company this year, has been more than offset by the Avar slump in the pilgrimage, and Ibn Saud has just obtained from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company an advance of a million dollars on account of future royalties. No one, except the King and one or two others, know what the financial situation of Saudi Arabia really is and, above all, whether there is a considerable reserve at home or abroad, but the impression made on me is that the King’s cheerfulness about his finances is due to his belief that the war will not last more than another six months or so, and that, if the low figures of this pilgrimage should be repeated next year and perhaps the year after, Ibn Saud might be in serious financial straits. The Minister of Finance is said to have urged the King to have economies made in the public departments, and to have proposed that the King should not come to Mecca this season, but economise in transport and entertaining by staying at home. There was little sign of economy when I was in Riyadh, but it is stated that the King has, in fact, agreed to the division of all estimates into urgent and non urgent and to have ordered the latter to be suspended. 5. It is unfortunate from the moral point of view that the new form of revenue in this country is almost as demoralising as the old. The exploitation of pilgrims is not an elevating means of livelihood, but it is also demoralising to draw a large revenue from a natural product whose extraction depends entirely upon the technical and organising skill of foreigners. But just as fate has given Saudi Arabia a perfect monopoly in the possession of the shrine at Mecca, so it has given them a share in the limited quantity of oil in the world, and one cannot expect them to worry about its effect on their character. I am told that the demoralising effect of easy oil money on the Saudis is already apparent, in that whereas ten years ago the rent of 5,000 gold pounds was counted out with the greatest care, to-day an expenditure of 50,000 gold pounds is con- sidered nothing. But the effect is visible to any observer at Riyadh, where there is a strong contrast between the poverty of the common people and the sprawling waste and extravagance of the Royal households. The huge new palace, built by the King himself without any proper plan, is typical of everything 1 . ’ It is not an overstatement. There are the brothers and uncles and cousins, and the Rashids, and the twenty-five or more princes and their unnumbered sisters, each one the nucleus of a group of idle senmnts and slaves and expensive cars and the men with wives and concubines in addition. And there is no education or moral training or experience to keep a check on the indulgence in pleasure and ^ luxury. Except for the King himself and the two eldest sons (and perhaps another son, Nasir, who, as the son of a slave mother, has been considered Ioav enough m status to be governor of the town of Riyadh), not a single one of the Royal personages does any work. None of the King’s sons have been educated and only four of them have seen anything of the outsidp wnrlH wUa+ fiN said that 2,000 or 3,000 people feed at the King’s expense, and this is probably poned for years by the prolongation of the King’s life, but even during theKing s life the presence of a crowd of idle and expensive sons must be a cause ot serious weakness to the regime. 6. It is impossible to know whether any community of feeling is growing up between say the Saudi tribes near Koweit and the once-turbulent population .in Asir. Probably not. But it can be stated with certainty that there is no ^community of feeling between the Hejaz towns and Nejd. The King speaks with a contempt which must be admitted to be well deserved of the people of the Hejaz, anu while he claims to rule with the approval of Nejd, he cares nothing for Hejazi approval. It is probable, however, that no ruler would be popular in the Hejaz who did not leave to the Hejazis their traditional liberty to exploit the pilgrims for their own advantage. The necessity to find money to subsidise the Nejd tribes, both to induce them to refrain from raids and to be ready to wage war for the King in case of need, has driven Ibn Baud to raise pilgrim dues to unprecedented heights, and not only does he leave the pilgiim little to spend in the Hejaz, but he represses the grosser forms of extortion by which the Hejazi might still squeeze a living out of the “ respected guests of the Holy Land. ’ The Hejazi likes to regard himself as exploited by Nejdis, Syrians and other foreigners,’ 5 and for this view there is some justifica tion. Whether the Hejaz, if independent, could support and defend itself is doubtful, but the Hejazi will think of the evil from which flight at present seems impossible rather than of the alternative ills. It would be sufficient for a pretender to the throne to promise a lowering of pilgrim dues and to hint at a freer hand for pilgrim guides, for him to win much popularity. As I have suggested before, it is conceivable that Hasa and Nejd may one day be the richer half of the peninsula, but whether that would induce the Hejaz to desire to maintain the present connexion would depend upon the policy of the Govern ment. Bhould Ibn Baud live long enough, and should the oil revenue increase as it is expected to do, it would be possible for him to create for the Hejaz such favourable conditions that even the Hejazis might realise their value. The dues on pilgrims would be so greatly reduced that the visitors would be able once more to spend largely in the Hejaz to the benefit of the local people, while the menace of the desert tribes would be kept in check by subsidies paid out of the royalties from Hasa oil. Whether such a situation, which would help towards the unification of the peninsula, would be allowed to develop in peace, would depend largely on the attitude of the northern neighbours of Saudi Arabia, and at present there is little evidence that the rulers of Iraq and Transjordan wish to see a strong, united and independent State on their southern borders. 7.

D.O. No. C/604. The Agency, Bahrain, the Jrd October, 1939* My dear Prior, Abdur 'Ra hman al Qpsaibi applied for an interviev/ yesterday saying he had received a certain telegram from Ibn Saud. I sent word that I was always glad to see him but would he give me some indication what was in the telegram. The telegram then turned into a letter and was said to contain instructions to discuss with me the restrictions on exports from Bahrain in so far as they affected Saudi Arabia. I then sent word that I regretted I could not discuss any such matters with Abdur Rahman who was not an 'accredited diplomatic representative' of the King and was well aware that proper channels exist for such communications. 2. Abdur Rahman then called on Belgrave (whom I had warned). He said that the King had written a private letter to him saying that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain were as one and that there should be no restrictions between them, and so on. The letter of course was not produced. 3 . It is true that we have restricted exports of essential articles from Bahrain in order to keep up supplies and to keep down prices o But no attempt has been or will be made to inter fere with transhipment or re-export cargoes consigned from source via Bahrain to Saudi Arabia. Whether the King has been misinformed and has indeed written to Qosaibi, or whether Qpsaibi has invented the letter in one of the periodic attempts to acquire special status in Bahrain remains in doubt. In case it is the former I am sending a copy of this letter direct to bir Reader Bullard so that he may know the situation with the least possible delay.

Both Belgrave and I keep a careful watch lor indications of Qosaibi efforts to assume a consular position and I do not think there need be any anxiety lest the Bahrain Government should accord the Qosaibis a. higher position than that of a private forwaiding agent for Ibn Saud. 3, In regard to the question of exemption from customs duty on one of their cars, His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain got out of this difficulty cleverly, by actually paying in cash himself the customs duty on it as a present to the Qosaibis I Yours sincerely, Sd.

Bo. 5 Saving. &gt;fi Jfi lj y telegram No. 5 Saving dated 15th April 1959 reported the enormous price the Saudi Government were asking from the Japanese for an oil concession, and in my letter to Mr. Baxter dated the 16th. April I mentioned their anxiety that the exploitation of oil in the Kuwait Neutral Lone should he begun as soon as possible. These facts pointed to a shortage of money and it is now certain that the Saudi Government are in great straits for funds. Apart from advances which they are believed to have taken from C.A.S.O.C and S.A»McS. they owe the undermentioned sums: Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey 25,000 Messrs. Zainal Alireza 40,000 Eastern Telegraph Company 7,000 These sums are in addition to a sum of perhaps £80,000 owing to Sharqieh Limited, most of which is recover able in the form of half the sums collected as hire of motor transport. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey allow the Saudi Government to get into their debt every year and as a set-off they retain the quarantine fees of about £2 a head paid by the pilgrims carried on vessels for which they are the Jedda agents. This year the pilgrimage was smaller than was expected, and on the other hand the Saudi orders were rather heavier. The Saudi Government have more than once got into debt with the Eastern Telegraph Company to the extent of £2,000 or /(S' or so, in respect of bills which ought to he settled monthly, but never for so large a sum as £7,000. Repeated requests from the Lastern Telegraph Company for payment have so far extracted only insignificant sums on account. It would seem that if war or danger of war caused a cessation or a serious falling off in the pilgrimage, the Saudi Government would be in aerious financial straits, even with the income from oil royalties.
