Most of the correspondence is between the Commander of the Persian Gulf Squadron and the Resident in the Persian Gulf. At the beginning of 1852, the Resident in the Persian Gulf was Samuel Hennell, who is the recipient of the first two letters in this file. In March 1852, Hennell was succeeded by Arnold Burrowes Kemball, who appears as both correspondent and recipient. The other officers who appear as both correspondent and recipient are John Patterson Porter, Commander of the Persian Gulf Squadron, and his successor, George Robinson. In addition to the letters between the aforementioned offices there are four letters, addressed to the Commander of the Persian Gulf Squadron, which were originally enclosed with other letters (not present in this file) from the Commander of the Persian Gulf Squadron to the Resident in the Persian Gulf.

                           Clive; Lieutenant James Tronson, Commander of the Honourable Company's brigantine
                           Tigris.Much of the correspondence in the file includes intelligence received from the Native Agent at Sharjah, Hadji Yacoob.
