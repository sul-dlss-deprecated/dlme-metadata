October 1873. CONFIDENTIAL. My Lord, Foreign Office, October 20, 1873. IN obedience to your Lordship's instructions, we have given our careful attention to the recommendations of Sir Bartle Frere for the suppression of the East African Slave Trade, and to the approximate cost of carrying those recommendations into practical effect, and have the honour to submit the following result of our inquiries:— Sir Bartle Frere s Recommendations. Observations and Proposals. (See page 255 of Confidential Correspon dence. Summary of Confidential Report of May 29, 1873.) Measures for Suppression. 1. Abrogation of the permission under the Treaty of 1845, to convey slaves to the Sultan's African dominions, on ground of constant violation by the Sultan of the spirit of the main Articles of the Treaty. 2. Total abolition of Slave Trade by sea, and slave-markets, without compensation. 3. Slave Trade by sea to be declared piracy, and all slaves taken at sea to be set free. 4. Embargo on Zanzibar Custom-houses to prevent slaves being passed. 5. Definition of status of British Indian subjects to prevent their holding slaves. 1 to 4. These are disposed of by the Treaty of the 5th of June. (See page 258 of Confidential Correspondence.) 5. This is an India Office question. Means for carrying out Suppression. 1. Right of search and detention of vessels under French, Turkish, Egyptian, and Per sian flags. 2. Increase of East African Consular Establishment. (a.) Zanzibar to be raised to the. rank of a Consulate-General, with increased staff. (b.) Appointment of a Consul at Mozam bique with jurisdiction in Johanna. 1 Political Agent and Consul-General .. Judicial Assistant, of Indian experience Assistant Agent and Vice-Consul Surgeon, with a Civil Hospital at a cost- of say 400/. per annum. [601] 1.

Money at disposal of Consul-General for Contingencies Total 400 190 4,000 After careful inquiry, we consider that (6.) this establishment, which is slightly less than that proposed by Sir Bartle Prere, is indispensable for the proper fulfilment of the Political, Consular, and Slave Trade duties at Zanzibar. The establishment which has hitherto (7.) existed is quite inadequate for the efficient performance of the duties devolving upon it, which are thus well described by Dr. Kirk:— ' 1. Keeping up political relations with the Zanzibar Government and the represen tatives of other nations. u 2. The Slave Trade suppression in its various branches, including the Yice-Ad- miralty Court allotment, and general super vision over freed slaves landed, the detection and prosecution of slave-traders amoDg our Indian community, and obtaining informa tion of the designs and movements of Arab slave-dealers on the coast and elsewhere. '3. The conduct of all civil and criminal cases wherein a British protege is the defen dant or the accused, and the urging of their rights before the Sultan's courts ; this being a department regulated by the Queen's Order in Council, implies, like the Yice- Admiralty branch, a certain attention to forms and much writing, besides patient examination. £&lt; 4. The purely Consular and commercial business of our mercantile marine, whether European or coasting. 44 5. Correspondence on all the above branches with the various officers in India and England with which this Agency is in direct communication, many subjects requir ing to be noticed and letters copied in tripli cate, besides office copy.' The existing staff for conducting the (8.) above is : — 1st. The Political Agent and Consul. 2nd. One Surgeon, who holds in addition the personal rank of Her Britannic Majesty'sSalary. £ 120 80' 72 108 400 190 4,000 Sir Bartle Frere's Recommendations. (6.) (7.) the (8.) Observations and Proposals. Vice-Consul, and is Assistant to the Political Agent. 3rd. An English Clerk. 4th. One Arabic Writer. 5th. Eight Peons as boat's crew, and employed in carrying messages. Under every one of the heads specified the (9.) work is constantly increasing. After a while it may be hoped that the (10.) work connected with the suppression of the Slave Trade will decrease, but not' till after an interval of several years, and for the present it will be reasonable to anticipate a great increase in this branch of the Consul's duties. The annual cost of the establishment has (11.) hitherto amounted to about2,600/., the whole of which fell on the Indian Government. Thus the total increase would be 1,400/. (12.) a year, less any fees which might be levied on judicial cases. But as the expenses of the establishment (13.) are now to be equally shared by the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, the amount charge able to Imperial funds would only amount to 2,000Z. a year. As regards the appointment of native (14.) Consular Agents, we consider that such ap pointments are desirable; but that it should be left to the discretion of the Consul- General to appoint such Agents at such places as he may think desirable, with such remuneration as he may think fit, provided the total cost on this account does not exceed 400Z. a year. The sum of 190/. for contingencies would, (15. in our opinion, enable the Consul-General to obtain much useful information as to the movements of slavers on different parts of the Coast. (6.) We consider that a Consul is required (16.) at Mozambique, both for Commercial and Slave Trade reasons. He should receive a salary of not more (17.) than 600/. a year, with an office allowance of 200/., and should have jurisdiction within the Portuguese Possessions on the East Coast of Africa, and in the Comoro Islands. Sir B. Frere says:— (18.) ' The external commerce of Mozambique is not very extensive, and hardly any of it is carried on by Portuguese subjects, ' The French and the Banians appear to share it between them ; the Banians collect ing and distributing the articles of trade in detail for a Marseilles firm, which runs several vessels annually, chiefly freighted outwards with goods of English manufac ture. and homewards with ivory and sessa- mum seed. ' The imports reach nearly 250,000/., and the exports nearly half that amount, ! i t4 Sir Bartle Frere's Recommendations. 3. Establishment of corps of trained in terpreters. 2 first class. Pay 8s. per day. 8 second class. ,, 6s. ,, ' 16 third class. „ 3s. „ 26 All with rations when afloat. Selection. —By Consul-General. Employment.—One man to be on board the cruizer, and one third-class man to be in every boat detached for service. Payment. —To be borne on the books of the establishment and paid by the Consul- General, except when afloat, when they should be charged to the Admiralty. Pension. —Under the Indian Uncove- nanted Service Rules. Observations and Proposals. as I was informed by the head of the Cus toms.' (Confidential Correspondence, page 79.) . It may be matter of consideration, looking at the facts thus stated by Sir B. Frere, of the Indian commercial interests at stake at Mozambique, whether this expense should not be shared by the Indian Government. 3. We consider this a question of paramount importance, and one which requires imme diate attention. We would not propose to fix the number of interpreters, but consider that a sum of 2,000/. per annum would be required to cover this branch of the service. We think there should be one first-class interpreter to remain at Zanzibar; but it is possible Dr. Kirk would find that the Guzerati Accountant attached to his Agency would be able also to perform this duty. That there should be one second-class Interpreter always on board each cruizer, and one tbird-class Interpreter to every boat which is detached from the vessel for cruizing purposes. The number thus required would probably amount to thirty men. We agree with Sir B. Frere that the Interpreters should be borne on the books of the Consulate-General, and that they should be selected by the Consul-General and sent out by him on application from commanding officers. Interpreters should have no share in prize money. The cost of Interpreters hitherto has amounted to about 300Z. per annum, so that the increase proposed under this head would be 1,700/. per annum. We would, however, remark that these Interpreters will be useful in many ways at the Consulate-General when not afloat, and would thus obviate any necessity for the increase, suggested by Sir B. Frere, of the number of Peons attached to the Consulate- General. The acquirements expected from the First-class Interpreter would be— Ability to speak, read, and write English, Swaheli, and Arabic. Second-class—To speak English, Swaheli, and Arabic, and to read and write either Arabic or Swaheli. Third-class—To speak English, Swaheli, and Arabic, and read Arabic. From the information furnished by the Admiralty as to the rates of pay now received by Interpreters, and looking to the necessity of obtaining a better class of men, we think that the rates of pay proposed by Sir B. Frere, are not excessive. (19.) (20.) (21.) (22.) (23.) (24.) (25.) (26.) (27.) (28.) (29.) (30.)5 Sir Bartle Freres Recommendations. Observations and Proposals. 4.

There have been hitherto on an average (33.) two ships employed on this coast line at an annual cost of about 45,000/. The squadron now proposed will consist (34.) of twelve ships, including the dep&amp;t or guard-ship, and, for the present, two sur veying vessels at a cost of 17,000Z. a year a piece. The outlay in fitting the depot ship will (35.) be about 25,000Z. But it must be remembered that, exclusive (36.) of Slave Trade reasons, a certain squadron of not less than, say, three ships, including for some time one surveying ship, must be main tained to represent Great Britain in these waters, so that the actual annual increase which may fairly be considered as incurred for the suppression of the Slave Trade can only be counted as nine ships, and cost of, say, 192,000/., till the survey is complete. The charge for the first year will be (37.) higher than' that which will be necessary [6011 CSir Bartle Frere's Recommendations. Observations and Proposals. 5. Survey of coast and rivers. 6. Increase of powers of Resident at Aden. 7. Action on Egyptian Slave Trade by suggesting to the Khedive that his terri tories should be free soil to all future immi grants, and by the appointment of an officer under our Consul-General in Egypt to inspect Red Sea ports and Nile caravan routes. 8. Encouragement of missionary and commercial enterprise. hereafter, as it will include the fitting out of the harbour ship to be stationed at Zanzibar. It has been represented to us, on the (38.) part of the Board of Admiralty, that it would, be only reasonable that the Indian Government should contribute towards the expenditure on account of this squadron. Upon this point we are not unanimous, (39.) but the majority are of opinion that it is a question of much importance, and should be a subject of more detailed consideration between the Imperial and Indian Govern ments. 5. The ' Shearwater ' and 'Nassau 'have (40.) been already detached for this service at an approximate cost of 34,000Z. a year, but, as one vessel would have been required for this survey, irrespective of the Slave Trade, the cost of one vessel only should be charged to the increased expenditure for suppressing the Slave Trade. Increase under this head is therefore (41.) 17,000Z. a-year. (See No. 4.) 6, 7, and 9 touch upon matters into (42.) which we do not feel called upon to enter. 8. We do not consider it within our pro- (43.) vince to express any opinion on this point. So far, however, as the question of the dis posal of liberated slaves is involved in this recommendation, we consider that any ex penditure from p ublic funds should be limited, as at present, to the cost of the maintenance of these persons until an opportunity occurs for enabling them to obtain their own living, which we have reason to believe will not be for any long period. 9. Creation of a Slave Department under the Foreign Office. The total annual expenditure involved in the foregoing proposals would amount to (44.) about 260,800Z., composed as follows ;— Naval Squadron Consular Establishment, including Mozambique Interpreters Total £ 254,000 4,800 2,000 260,800 Increase. £ 192,000 2,200 1,700 195,900 Two very important questions in connection with the affairs of Zanzibar remain to be considered:— 1. The payment of the Subsidy by Zanzibar to Muscat. 2. The Postal Convention for the conveyance of mails from Aden to Zanzibar.1 als. fitting out tationed at us, on the Ity, that it the Indian towards the ^uadron. unanimous, that it is a id should be :onsideration ian Govern- fassau ' have service at an year, but, as lired for this -e Trade, the I be charged ■ suppressing (38.)

India already contributes 70,000Z. per annum to the expenses of the Naval Forces in the Eastern waters. It has not been represented that this sum is insufficient for all Indian purposes, political and commercial. The extension of the Naval Force, and the consequent increase of expenditure (including that of Interpreters) are rendered necessary by the measures to be adopted for the suppression of the East African Slave Trade. Against the appropriation of any part of the revenues of India to the suppression ot this traffic, the Government of India have frequently protested. And I can see no colourable pretext for making the people of India pay for the prosecution of measures purely ot Imperial origin, in which they have no interest, and-with the objects of which they have for the most part no sympathy. , ^ r ^ u ^ ^ I do not object to the paragraph stating that it is matter for consideration whether the Indian Exchequer should not be called upon to contribute towards the proposed Consulate at Mozambique, because I do not know very clearly what commercial advantages to India there may be in esse or in posse to render such an appropriation of our public money justifiable.
