Dear tzC-e t l j j.fl Please refer to your telegram No. C/234 of August 2 regarding an administrator for Gwadur.

We should be glad if you would discuss the possibility of appointing Jamil as administrator for Gwadur with the Sultan and telegraph his decision. I should like to add that we consider a recommenda tion from Sir G. Cunningham as high praise and that a man with Jamil's mild temperament might well be suitable for Gwadur.

Khalil Ahmed- Jamil was appointed as Wazir Las Bela in July 1946 on the recommendation of Sir George Cunningham who had a very high opinion of him. I was not in Baluchistan during his tenure as Wazir but Hickinbotham, who was Political Agent, Kalat, at the time did not have a very high opinion of his' administrative and executive abilities. H'e thought Khalil Ahmad to be honest, rather shy of accepting responsibility and not a strong charector. Khalil Ahmad w r as not happy in Las Bela and left after a short stay of four months and returned to the North West Frontier Province. Yours sincerely, Sd/- Illegible. Major A.L.A.
