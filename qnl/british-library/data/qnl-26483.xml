Copy to *01 JCAi CQMMiTTSE J\JL 1329 Previous Papers :— 3287 2000 12.28 FOR INFORMATION. Please see previous submission on P. 4184/29 below, and Lord Lloyd’s despatch of the 6th June on P. 4490. The report is of interest, though we are less directly concerned with it than the Foreign Office and Colonial Office. It will be seen that we have not discovered the contents of King Fuad’s letter to the Imam, but that those caused great satisfaction to His Excellency. The proposal for a Treaty of Friendship appears to have emanated from the Yemenite authorities, and the Egyptian envoy seems to have had some difficulty in avoiding a definite commitment on behalf of his Government. Paragraph 20 of Mr. Grafftey- Smith’s precis of the report as bearing on Yemenite foreign relations. The envoy's personal impressions on the f utn-rA /future of relations between the Yemen and Egypt summarised in paragraph 21 of the same precis are of much interest. It will be seen that the bait of the Salif salt concessions has been held out to the Egyptians, and that, broadly speaking, the Yemen is asking rather than giving. E* There are three references in this corresponded to Anglo--^gypliaa relations - (a) paragraph 10 of Lord Lloyd's despatch of the oth June on P. 4490. seems hardly probable that we should have suggested to Hosny Bey that he should act as arbitrator when in Sanaa, though the recent use of Commander Craufurd as inter mediary by the Resident, despite our previous explanations that that officer had no official character, will be remembered. (c) paragraphs 16 and 19 of the report. This does not advance matters substantially. It has in the last few days been decided to instruct the Resident that advances for a treaty should come from the Imam, and that overtures are not to be made by us. The interest of thle episode is as illustrating Fuad's desire to increase his prominence in Arabian affairs It remains to be seen whether any substantial results will follow from the mission.1 In any further com^ rnic^ and address—«(l to any person by itatne, but to— lication pn this sirfjject, please quote lyo I'lfm No. :ss—; “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign’Office, London, S.W. i.

No. 516 5 CAIRO. (18907/3) (J 1710/1710/16) 1 46 50 ! 7th June, 1929 K j Sir, With reference to paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 497 of June 6th., I have, after reflection, thought it in expedient to raise with the Prime Minister at present the question of the King^ title in the draft of the proposed Egypto-Yemeni Treaty. 2. Dr. Hafez Afifi told the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to show the Residency Hussein Hosni’s report confidentially. Neither the Palace nor the Prime Minister even know that it has 'been seen by the Residency. It would therefore have been manifestly rather difficult to make any representations on a document communicated in this manner. Moreover, Waguih Pasha assured me that the terminology in this draft Treaty need not cause alarm. In reply to a recent request from the Czecho-Slovakian Government as to the exact title of King Puad, tne ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Contentieux for an opinion. The Contentieux replied that since the independence of Egypt, the title was n King of Egypt' only. An official communication in this sense had accordingly been made to the Czecho-Slovakian Government. The Egyptian Government was therefore committed to the limited title, and in Treaties no other terminology could be used. 3 The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., etc etc., etc.3. In support of this contention of Wagulh Pasha I would Invite a reference to the Perso-Egyptlan Treaty In which King Puad Is described as the 'King of Egypt' only. (see your despatch Ko. 44 - J 3604/2512/16 - of uhe 12th January 1929). I am Inclined to think that any danger of the use of the more ambitious title In a still problematic Egyp^o- Yemenl Treaty is sufficiently remote to justify our post poning action for the present.

Major Champion, whom he met at dinner, explained Anglo** Yemeni difficulties to Iiia, but Koeny Bey turned a deaf ear ) to what he took to be a suggestion that he should act as mediator when in .'ianaa. Colonel I^ake, with whom he lunched, was helpful with maps and photographs of the Yemen, and Boany Bey acknowledges with warm gratitwe the courtesy and I-indness shown him by the Residency in Aden, 3&gt; He called upon the meniean Consul, of whom h© has nothing to say, and upon the Italian Consul. The latter enquired whether the caliphate movement was still strong In Egypt, and gave it as his opinion that Kgypt was the most advanced of Moslem states to-day and that King Fuad was the most suitable candidate to the caliphate, Hosny Bey replied that the Caliphate was hardly discussed in Egypt nowadays*// It was giiiiH 1t| a so* nod. anong ths gener*?.! pttbXia in Aden tlmt Ilia uifislon to the Iisan was ^Tidertalien on behalf of F.H.G, and that its object was the settlement of the Aden-Tenon dispute. This belief Hosny Bey had some diffi- ciilty in dispelling. £ Be left Aden on haroh 17th, arriving at Hodoidahon Tarch 19th. Ba was given a ceremoniously official recep tion, affcaa* which he paid his respects to the Stair 3eif-ul- Isl&amp;ra r.ohammed, con of the Imam and Govemor of Hodeidah. The italr expressed his regret t^jat his own jonrney Italy should have coincided with Bing Fuad*a absence from Egypt in 1937 and that he should thus have failed to meet Kis Majesty. h© asked at once whether Hosny Bey was the bearer of any message freiu Aden, and deplored the policy of bombs and aerial demonstrations. '^ace and an Agreement with Aden would, he said, be welcome to the Yemen if Yemen rights were not prejudiced, and he believed that those now reenonsible for Aden policy were men of goodwill and peaceably inclined. Tills Hosny Bey ventured to endorse, in the light of his conversations In Aden, while making it clear that his mission haa definite official limitations. ^ During his stay in Bodeidah, Hosny Bey met many local notables and officials who betrayed great interest in Egyptian affairs. The reform of A1 Azh&amp;r, the extension of education, the representation of Egypt at international conferences and the prospects of hats superseding tar- boushes on the Turkish model, were popular subjects of oat ©ohiam 5 arid ills replies and hie questions were - it seems - intelligent and by no means tendencious in direc tions either reactionary or revolutionary, hen he took /leave^3 leave of the Haiti* Beif-al-Iolan Kol?fc:;. 3 i,i©d, zh&amp; latter said how mueh he ho. 5 ed t!iat Egypt rould acolst the Ye ien in the path of refoww «. fy»f&gt;ci which constant hostilities had hitherto distracted her r ^osny Bey T;as sure t'iat hie country would be ready to do anything within !aer power to help her sister in language and religion. The Emir‘e Egyptian Secretary, 8 ayeti Hobawsed el .ueisai, waa attaclied to TToony Bey*a service to accompany and assist him during his sojourn In the Yemen, 7 -he party arrived at Sanaa on 1 arch £ 5 th and found no one waiting to receive then. 'fhis, as was apologetic cally explained by H«di Abdullsh ol Acsaeri {described as the Iwam 1 s right-hand and as corresiXinding to Mr P rime Sinister) and by cadi J&amp;oh&amp;med Kagheb Bey (late Thurkish Cavern or of Hodeidah during; the war, now % inis ^er for foreign Affslrtf*), vrbo hastened to greet Hosny } 3 ©y, was due to the Imam* a ignorance of the exact hour of hi# arrival and absence, at that moment, in the country outside ..&gt;anaa. An audienoe with the Imam was at once arranged for the following day, ^ 'Yerythlng was done to Mi Mb# function as ”official* as possible, £#dl el Onsy (Minister of Education and ' Ousters# ”), whom the Inai had delegated to look after Ho#ny Bey ! a confort while in %naa # drove with him tnrougiri st 3 *eets lined with troops in a four-horse carriage to the Palace, where the other two officials mentioned, above ushered him into the Imm 1 3 presence, Hosny Bey handed the Imam King Fuad 1 # letter; lEagheb Bey opened it, and Hosny Bey read it aloud. Its (unspecified) contents gave the team great pleasure anti tlx© concluding words: /%a*’ &amp; aleyk ya anlx^ul-ar^Lb' - provoked hira to tho necefliiary reo^procotion of co\artcay. In the ensuing con versation, the loam said that never in history had kgypt attained a position such as nor, under King Fuad ! s (piidaneo # sho held, Moslems the vorld over raised their heads in pride at hgypt f s ao'uievements, and Kgypt^ King had become tlv* greatest of the Kings of Islam while his country ras the greatest home of religion and the focus of hoalem hopes. Referring to King Fuad 1 *! letter, the Imam expres sed ills delighted belief that it opened a new era in the history of f&amp;fpt-Yemen relations. He thanked King Fuad and his aovemmeut for delegating a special envoy to bring it. Hosny Bey made suitable rej:ly, and the audience end ad. ^ During, the next fev? days, he was kept busy receiving numerous callers, including, apparently, all tlie high officials of ;&gt;anaa, and returning their calls. Ee was given lunch by the Governor of Sanaa but, being the Iisam’s guest, was unable to return such hospitality and he there fore asked the Governor to distribute loG h, x. uollai *8 to the poor of Sanaa in appreciation of these kindneasos received. His visitors pi leu Mm with questions about r&gt;gypt f * renaissance, and Azhov ref r r?as were again the subject of anxious enquirids. Hosny Bey sought - he thinks, successfully, - to dispel fears of subversive development, and explained tli&amp;t the object of the refemaa Is not to prejudice the cause of true religion or to break the best traditions of AX Ashar, but to fit Uie Uleisa bet to* for* ^heir noble work. /c His en€s.eav(uirs bo get about tine city and investigate the local economic situation were frustrated by the /attentions/-N c^Aaa*** ^ y^jrUc-U^f tyr*****- - attentions of the gm^d of honoirr whi.eh acconpariied hlm # dec-pi be his teodeet protests, on all hi a cowing* and goingu. i To this handicap he adds another: With the people of the I Yemen, he emye, suspicion is second nature, // In one of his conversations, iAgheh ney asked whether Hosny B^y carried any authority to negotiate a ‘Treaty of F'ricnaahip, Hosny gey replioci that this wae the first he had heard of such a aug ;eacian, and rerslnded Kagheb Bey of the Xlroitatlons of his Mission, Rnghab Bey later raised the Bubject again, I.ia i, he said, wac very anxious to see such ft treaty signed, Hosny Bfty at last yielded so far ns to say that, if the Inaia would draft a Treaty, ho would take it to Egypt to be studied by the liinlatry of 'foreign A f fa ire, /a hen this draft reached lii.i, he found the .radio to be no peculiar and atsbiguouc that he was unable, without interpretation, to accept responsibility for explaining its meaning in Cairo, Ragheb Bey was therefore c.etaiXea to assist him in the work of exegesis, but he, too, had to confess hiaiself baffled. Ho could only state that it was very like the Treaty between the Ye i©n and Italy. /$ Hoany Bay therefore v/rote a letter to the Iraftm, setting forth the various expressions and phrases whose ambiguity disturbed him and attaching to each his own interpretation or paraphrase, with a request that the Imam would incicate whether these interpret' tions represented what 7/as in his own mind or not. The Ijuau replied, accepting these rea dings of IJLs text and enclosing a second, rather less obscure, draft of the Treaty, for Hoeny Bey to sign before leaving baaaa, liosny Bey again explained his limitations and deprecated, any attempt at cable communication with /CairoCairo on the anbjleet. It was therefore agreed that he ahould take the doe^araont, to subrait it }&gt;eraonally in Cairo. /// tr 'he»i saying goodbye to him cm April 13th the Imam re* oeatod his praises of Egypt and King Fuad, and asked that arrangements might he made for the admission of Yemeni students to Egyptian schools and for Egyptian assistance to the Yemen in the despatch of well-qualified teachers thither. He expressed anxiety about AX Ashar, stating fc* that It was his alarm, inspired by what he had read in the 'Wadlnnll* about /.ahar reforms, that had led him to write to King Fuad. For the latter he had only eulogy, and dee* eribed Egypt as the cynosure of the Moslem world. Hosny Hey was reassuring about Aahar reforms, and took his leave with many expressions of gratitude. /£^ The draft, m renty appears to folio?/ closely that con- eluded between the Yemen and Italy. King Puad is refer red to as 'His Majesty the Yihg of Egypt and the Sudan and the countries of Nubia, Darfour and Kordofan, Sultan Fuad T*. The Imam, as 'Hia Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam Yehym ibn Mohammed mreid-ud-din 1 *. The Treaty is one of n basic friendship 1 * between the two countries. It consists of seven Articles*- (i) 'ing Fuad recognises the absolute independence of the territory of the Yemen, of the Imam and of his (leyemment. (li) The Imam recognises the absolute independence of Egypt, the Sudan, etc., of King Fuad and of his Goyemment. (ill) Mutual recognition of liberty of trade to their subjects trading in each other's territory, Mutual exchange of representatives and consuls A&gt;7by future agr^fement* [7. ^ 1 '^ac* deairtifi thl^ proviaiou tc bf-j left teiaporarlly unfulfilled# ) (iv) liability of aubjecta of one sovereign in territory of the other to local Jurisdiction aud cue' ; ^lercial end private affairs. (v) riec^issions for a Cormercia 1 and Ecenoukla Treaty to follow tlie negotiation of the present treaty of friendship. (iv) The Treaty to be colled 'The yenen-Hgyptlan Treaty of KriendshiP n , and to be oigned in duplicate* (vi) Its diiration to be five years, at the end of hidh fieriou it jaay be renewed, altered or extended. After endorse , nent by the King of Tg}’ ot and signature by the Kgyptian Govern ment and King, it will beooue effective from the date of the receipt of the endorsed copy by tit# Yenen Government in Sanaa. Before leaving fliKM, Bey took Paper ell of his nunarous friends, last of all of Ragheb Bey, ^ho reiterated the anxiety of the Te ion to see th© Treaty with hgypt con cluded as soon as possible. Hagheb Bey charged Kosny Bey wit?, a Message Cor .Colonel Rsilly in Aden to the effect that t)ie way to fin under#tauding with the Inaem 1 # Govern ment was easy if negotiations v;ere entrusted to persona pc S 3 eased of P^.tience and long tempers &amp;nu of the will to agreement, The Yemen, he said, knows that an Agreeiaent with Great Britain ia in her intej^at, so that at least Crest Britain may lielp her against the ambitions of other countries. Che knew that ngland wo&gt;ild not encroach fesjMUi beyond the limits of the n Yine ^l*otectorates n , and was /reaayready, indeed, to reeognlee the Protectorate over thie district, but she required a bare aeknowled^aent of nominal Yemen suzerainty there, so that, if Great Britain should one day abandon her Proteetorate in thoae parts, the Yemen would then have the first right to take possession. If both parties were agreed as to practical results, diplomacy could surely find a formula mutually satisfactory. The danger lay In a continuance of present tension and suspense, for that left the door of intrigue open, especially aa certain other foreign Powers most probably had supporters In the Yemen, who served the interest of their policy there and troubled the atmosphere so long as this dispute re* rnained unsettled. Hosny B©y promised to pass this conversation on, per sonally, to Colonel Reilly, He received, Just before leaving L&gt;anaa, a letter tonefeea* for King Fuad from the Imam. /£&gt; While waiting for a boat in Hodeldah Hosny Bey met Bayed Mohammed Zabara, 'tfayCr of the Palace” in Sanaa, on his way to tfgypt w for health reasons and the printing of a book*.

A common language and religion inspire confidence, fortified by the belief that Egypt lias no imperialistic ambitions like ether conn- trios. Tills preference may open the way to Egypt f s securing a position in tho Yemen such ae no other country can hope to attain. Delay in concurring in the Yemen's proposals rill lead the Yemenis, who are, naturally, a most suspicious race, to believe that Egypt is deferring to the policy of this or that Great Power - which may be opposed to Egyptian pre dominance in the Yemen - and even if Egypt were to obtain a footing in the Yemen after such sus picions had had time to grow, her activities would bo suspect. It is therefor© urged that the Itaaia 1 # wishes with regard to the admission of Yemenis to Egyptian schools snould be met without delay, whether his other proposals are f:vcpr?bly considered or not. The Treaty would enable Egyptian financiers to obtain most valuable concessions; o.g* Galt at Calif.

Sir, vfith referenoe to oorrespondenoe ending with your telegram Ho. 96 of the Elet March laet, I am informed oonfidentially that King Puad has received another letter from Imam Tahia. Hie Majesty had quite properly asked the Ministry of foreign Affairs to draft his reply to the first letter, Out his answer to this second communication was sent in a sealed envelope from the Palace to the Ministry of foreign Affairs, with the request that it be forwarded to the Imam. The Ministry, therefore, has no JcnowJs dge of the contents of this second royal missive. 2. I am unable to represent to the King the impropriety of this procedure, as I would compromise »y informant by betraying knowledge of this incident. 3. My informant, who is in a position to know, expressed uneasiness at the King’s attitude, which, he thought, indicated some sort of underhand dealing. 4. I have forwarded a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Resident at Aden. I have, eto., (3gd. ) LLOYD. High Commissioner.

This telegram, which was sent from Sanaa to the Ministry of foreign Affairs, was communicated to me privately by the Under-secretary of State. £• A telegram from dodelda to M A1 iiofcattam', after reporting the official receptions of the Egyptian envoy and his journey to Sanaa accompanied by Sayed Mohammed El Leissi, the private secretary of the Imam's son 3eif**ul-lslam, states that the Yemenis base great hopes on this mission. 3. In another message n Al Molcattam' states that Imam Tahia has, in his letter to King Puad, expressed the desire that the Egyptian Government should acknowledge Yemeni pass ports, The Imam apparently pointed out that a Yemeni wishing to travel to Egypt via Aden had to obtain a British passport (? laissez-passer), and an Italian passport (? laissez-passer) if he proceeded via Mosawwa. The Imam is also said to have expressed the desire that the Egyptian Government should recognise Yemeni stamps. All letters at present coming from the Yemen are stamped at Aden or Mosawwa. The correspondent understands that the Egyptian Government sees no objection to meeting the Imam's wishes regarding passports but finds it difficult to recognise Yemeni stamps as Yemen does not belong to the Postal Union. The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, X.G etc., etc. , e etc • •4, I am of opinion that all this activity displayed by King /nad in the Yemen ia moat undesirable and should be discouraged* The kin*% against the wishes of his own Uinistera, has just virtually broken off relations with ibn S^ud, whom he obstinately refuses to reoopmise* His Majesty chooses this moment to send a friendly mission to Imam Yahia, who is not only the rival of Ibn 3a*ud but has recently been engaged in active hostility against ourselves. This Egyptian interference can only be interpreted in an anti-British and anti-Ibn 3a*ud sense. Moreover, neither we nor the responsible Egyptian Ministers even know what king i?uad is now writing to the Imam (see my despatch above referred to). 6. I have on several occasions drawn attention to king Quad's ambition to play a rGle in the Arabian peninsula. Possibly he dreams of emulating his more illustrious anosators in some decisive anti-flfahhabi movement. Hie pro-ltalian sympathies also must not be forgotten when considering the possibilities of his action in the Yemen. Anyhow, British interests in Egypt and Arabia have at present nothing to gain by any kind of Sgypto-Arabian association. I think, therefore, that this Yemen incident affords us a very favourable oppor tunity of impressing king itaad with our determination to prevent him from interfering in Arabia. The peculiar position of Yemen at this moment gives us a most reasonable pretext for re present ati (ms to king J*aad, and such an excellent pretext may not recur in the immediate future. I should, therefore, be glad of your authority to inform His Majesty that we regard as sxtrsmely inappropriate his intervention at this moment in a country where Egypt has no interests. I would add that HisMajesty’s interferenoe oan only bo interpreted ae partisan- ship asainst Ibn 3a»ud and is f inoidentally, hardly tantful in Tiew of the unsettled relations between the Imam and the Aden protectorate* 6* I am forwarding copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Hesident at Aden and to His Majesty's Agent and Consul at Jeddah* I have, etc., (3gd.)

M II II II II II II II II tl II II II II II II II II II H II II Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs states that Imam (o±) Y ehia has written to King Fuad asking latter in general terms to assist Yemenis in Egypt. King Fuad is sending a complimentary answer by a cer tain Hussein Kesr i formerly Egyptian Consul at Naples. Under Secretary of State said choice of routes lay between Erytrea and Aden and that Egyptian Government preferred to have re course to us to facilitate enveyh journey from Aden to Yehia and would be grateful if I could give him a letter of intro duction to Governor of Aden for that purpose. He is leaving for Suez tomorrow. Under Secretary of State said that Hussein Hosni would make a report on the situation of Yemenis chiefly from the commercial point of view and that Ministry of Foreign Affairs would let us have any interesting information thus obtained. Under Secretary of State intimated confidentially that the King’s first impulse on receipt of Imam’s letter had been to appoint an Egyptian Consul in Yehia but that His Majesty had since been dissuaded by the argument as to lack of Egyptian interests there. Oriental Secretary, to whom communication was verbally made, expressed some surprise at sudden despatch of this ~ envoy.( 2 ) Egyptian Mission in Yehia at this moment might he interpreted as an anti-British and an anti-Ibn Saud gesture 0 King Fuad’s desire to play a part in Arabian , affairs should presumably be discouraged. On the other hand it would be a delicate matter to prevent departure of envoy. I I propose therefore merely to refrain from giving letter of recommendation asked for and to let Minister for Foreign Affairs know that I regard this precipate Mission with misgiving in that it may be interpreted as Egyptian interference in Arabian affairs. I should be grateful for your views by telegraph. You will doubtless telegraph the necessary instruc tions to Aden direct regarding question of facilities for journey of Egyptian envoy.

Relations between liejaz and Egypt are getting worse owing to King of Egypt’s refusal to recognise Ibn Saud. The latter retaliated by refusing to admit official status of Egyptian consul especially in connexion with service of judicial documents unless Egypt would accord similar status to the Hejaz agent in Cairo whom Egyptian government ignore. Finally Hafez Wahba proposed question of formal status should be left in abeyance until atmosphere became clearer but that meanwhile Egyptian consul in Jeddah and Hejaz representative in Cairo should be allowed to treat with Hejaz and Egyptian authorities on all the usual matters without having the status formally conferred. This offer recognised by Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as reasonable has been rejected by the King of Egypt who now persists in withdrawing acting Egyptian consul from Jeddah on the ground that he may be exposed to an affront in view of present strained relations. Ministry of Foreign Affairs states withdrawal will be effected unobtrusively e.g, acting consul will be transferred elsewhere and not replaced consulate being left in the care of an archivist.
