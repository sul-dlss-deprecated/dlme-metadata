Yours truly To, The Superintendent, Bushire Residency Office, Persian Gulf, Bushire.PERSIA. [October 29.] C onfidential. S ection 24. No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey. (No. 247.) Tehran, 26th September 1906. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 51 of the 27th February last, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a note from the Persian Government on the subject of the sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein claimed by His Majesty the Shah. The Grand Vizier mentions in the inclosed note an Agreement made in 1822 between His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government, in which the former recognise the Island of Bahrein as a dependency of the Province of Ears. I presume His Highness refers to the Agreement made in that year by the British Resident at Bushire and disowned by His Majesty's Government. As I informed the Persian Government, under the instructions contained in your telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last, that His Majesty's Govern ment decline to entertain any further representations on the subject of the Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, I have returned no reply to the Grand Vizier's communication. There are a few outstanding claims at Bushire in which Bahreinis are interested, and I have been for the last year trying to settle these cases amicably with the Persian Government. If it should be impossible to obtain justice for the parties concerned, the details of these claims will be brought to your notice in due course, according to your instructions (see your telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last). (Translation.) I have received and submitted to His Imperial Majesty the Shah your undated letter [19th February last ] respecting Bahrein. I have now the honour to state that, in view of the former proceedings, and also in view of the friendship existing between the two Governments, I did not expect to see the two following paragraphs in your note :— 1. ' His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their opinion, entirely inadmissible'. 2. ' His Majesty's Government consider the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection '. Not to speak of the fact that the spirit of the Treaties explains and demonstrates the rights of the Persian Government over the Island in question, such an answer has never been put forward in the correspondence on the subject which has passed between the high officials of the two Governments in London and Tehran, and apparently it is the first time that such an answer has been given by the British Legation. To refrain from giving a long and detailed reply to this statement, I content myself on this occasion with a reference to a distinct Agreement made I have, &amp;c., E velyn G rant D uff. Inclosure in No. 1. Grand Vizier to Mr. E. Grant Duff. 13th September 1906.between the high officials of the two Governments on the 30th August 1822, and signed by Sir William Bruce, the Special Commissioner of the British Government. In the Agreememt in question the decision about the case was as follows:— ' The Island of Bahrein has always been a dependency of Fars. The Bani Attabeh inhabitants of the Island disobeyed the orders of the Fars authorities and applied to the Military Commander for a flag. The flag will be taken back if already given, and hereafter protection will be refused to the Arabs mentioned above'^ In view of the clear expressions used in your previous note, in which tlie rights of the Persian Government over the Island in question have not been denied, I hope you will continue to follow the former opinion of the British Government in regard to the rights of the Persian Government over that Island, and you will not interpret my telegram addressed to the trading classes in Bahrein to mean anything but a mark of friendship between the two Governments. The telegram in question does not in any way compromise the rights of the Persian Government over the Island. If there is any statement to be made in regard to certain difficulties about the inhabitants of the Island, it is a separate question, which must be settled according to justice. N ote. —I cannot find the exact English text of the Agreement referred to, but I think the Grand Vizier refers to the Agreement made in 1822 between the British Resident at Bushire and the authorities in Fars. This Agreement was not^ ratified by His Majesty's Government, and the Resident was recalled.—A. K. Annex. Memorandum hy Mr, Brant on Agreement with Persia of 30th August 1822 regarding Bahrein. It is quite true that Captain William Bruce (he was not at that time Sir Mr. E. Grant Duff, No. 247. 26th September William) signed, On the 30th August 1906. 1822, an Agreement with His Royal Mr. a. Wiliock, No. 1.25th January 1822. Highness Hoosain Ally Mirza, Prince of Shiraz. The Ilnd Article of this Treaty was as follows :— ' The Island of Bahrein, which has always been subordinate to the Province of Fars and its possessors, the Beni Uttoobee Arabs, who have of late been unruly and disobedient, and had applied to the Commanding Officer of the British Forces for a distinguishing flag ; this flag, if it has been granted, to be withdrawn, and no assistance to be rendered to the Beni Uttoobee Arabs here- after ,, . , » The 4th section of Article V contains an undertaking to give naval as sistance to a Persian expedition against Bahrein. This Agreement was entirely contrary to the views of the Government at Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of Shiraz disavowing the Treaty in strong terms and announcing the recall of Captain Bruce. Not only did the Indian Government disavow the Treaty, but Mr. G, Willock, British Representative at Tabreez, reported that— ' Mirza Baugur, Anhie, who had been deputed to Court to obtain the ratification of the Treaty, did not meet with a favourable reception ; and His Majesty the Shah, whilst refusing his accordance to the stipulations, expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engage ments with the British Government without his knowledge and injunctions , ^ This Agreement was therefore disavowed by the Indian Government in the most explicit manner, and it appears to have failed to secure the sanction of the Bhah. &gt; R.

In reply to your note of 5th January last res pecting the island of Bahrein, I have the honour to state that the object of referring to the Agreement of 1822 between His late Highness the Firman Firma of Fars and ^aptain Bruce was not that the British Government should now say that it has been disavowed. Besides the fact that the agreement is one which has been made between the offi cials of the two Governments and the abrogation of it is not at all 'known to the Persian Government who consider it w binding, the object of ray note was that an officially appointedappointed British Officer (all the British officers have always been known for their experience and knowledge) has recognised the right of the Persian Government over the island in Question and given evidence as to the status of the island at that time, testifying to the rights of Persia as an eyewitness. F.veh if the agreement which has reference to certain measures had, as supposed by the British Government, oeen abrogated, that would not settle the matter and the Persian Government hopes, in view of the Justice which is always expected from the British Government, that the latter will not lose sight of the ancient rights of the Persian Govern ment which had in different cases been recognised by her and will not refrain from acting in harmony on ail occasions. N. B.-The Persian te^t of this note is very confused. Enclosure in Sir C.Spring-Rice 1 s despatch No.61. (Translation. ) -. Sir C. Spring—Rice to Grand vizier, 2t&gt;rd February 1907. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of ^ Your iiighness *s note of the 5th instant on the subject oi the status, of the island 'of Bahrein. I note with surprise that Tour Highness^ states that the Persian Government know nothing of the abrogation of the agreement of 1322 between ^aptain Bruce and the tirman Pima of Pars and consider it binding. As you- are of course aware no engagement between nations is binding until it has been formally ratified by the proper authorities. According to the information in ray possession, and which is doubtless also to be found in the archives of the 'Persian Foreign Office• not only was the Treaty disavowed by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty's Government, but His Majesty the Shah refused to recognist- its stipulations and expressed his displeasure that the Prince V-J J IS of rsia bain en ^ | sisui s ill ern- r { sions. .sed. 2 « cman &gt;n said the wred * s ise- 6 A Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or ins tructions.9 ' Ho: /i/J of 1507, British Pweaidency and.

I have forwarded you two Memorials from Bahrein - one dii ect ov post, sjid the otjier via Bushire and now beg to enclose their copies herewith. I hope they have been per used by you, the Honourable Members. I have to again state that an old man who is an inhabitant of Bahrein itself and who is wise, well-informed and experienced had been to my « house two or three days ago arid we held a conversation about Persia and the Persian Government and meantime a mention was made of Bahrein. He described a detail but I am unable to narrate his statements or reduce them to writing. (Suffice it to say) that I was in a strange state. -he inhaoitants of Bahrein themselves consider Bahrein to belong to Persia, the buildings constructed by the commands of Path Ali Shah and Mohamed Shah still exist (there) and the Bushire Passport Department still records Bahrein as(a tovm in the)interior. What is the reason that there should not be a representative of the (Persian) Go vernment? For what cause there should not be a Persian flagstaff while the British Flagstaff is erected there? On what ground should the (local ) Government be in the hands of the Lnglish? One sing.e man does not think of Bahrein and it will soon pass out of the hands (Bf Persia. The Newspapers constantly dwell upon the (Persian ) Govern ment loans; the Government (i.e. the Shah) pawns his country for the expenses of Luropean tours and makes his suojects captives of.the foreigners and takes loans but does not appoint an official at Bahrein. An income of 10 crores tomans is derived per annum from the date groves, cultivations and the sea of this country. There are 6000 boats at Bahrein which proceedto pearl-banks for pearl-fishing. How much will it be if a Lirah is recovered from every boat annually? not to speak of the Customs and its revenues. 0 my Lords! 0 Delegates of the Persian ITation, it rests with you not to allow such a country to be lost# I have heaid confidentially that the Sultan of Turkey is carrying on secret communication and correspondence with the oheikh of Bahrein. The oheikh will probably go under the Sultan's protection. The L'nglish are trying strenuously to take the Customs from the Sheikh. He has not agreed so far, out he may probably be compelled at last to consent to have them farmed. Their influence will then increase 90%. It will oe tomorrow that Persia's hands will not reach any place, in no way. If Bahrein is lost, the other ports will also oe affected in consequence. The matter rests with the Honourable MembersB (signed) Mohamed Ardakani.■Ho: I83 q of 1907. /vv^Brit-ish Residency ajid Consulate-General, A Busliire, August l o 07.

Major P.Z.Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Report. ~ I saw Gyad Jelaluddin, the proprietor and editor of the 'Habal-al-Matin', and in answer to my questions he said that Haji Mahomed Ardokhani is a Babi. Some years ago he was employed in the ' int at Teheran and was dismissed for having committed some defalcation of Government money. He then came to Bombay and was employed as a clerk first in the office of Agha Mahomed Jafir Ispahan! and afterwards in that of Agha Mahomed Hasan Kashi. He writes a neat hand and is a very good clerk and on that account about two years ago was recommended to him by Ha^i Mahomed Hasan Kashi, but as Haji Mahomed was a Babi, Syad Jelaluddin refused to take him in his office. He added that he too noticed the letter which appeared in the 'Majlis' about the British occupation but he did not attribute its authorship to him as the man has very little knowledge of politics and in his opinion Haji Mahomed was made to put his signature to that article by some one. He further added that the question of Bahrein was occupying the attention of all Persians who are interested in the welfare of their country and they have sent aim copies of all the treaties and agreements which from time to time were concluded between the British Government and the ■ersian Government. In connection with this he referred to the action of the British Government in not allowing the Persians to hoist their flag at/the island of Bani Musa. Had tiie Persians been then allowed to proclaim their sovereignty in that island the spectacle of a German company trying to exploit its mineral wealths would have been avoided. The matter he said is now before the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Persian Governor of Bushire and is sure to give rise to many intricate points. 10th February 1908.Kindly in in regard to pi Office.

Mackenzie, Political Agent, B A H H E Ir * : ' ^ No . / S 2 SOt 1910 . British Reaidanoy and Consulato-Genoral, Buahire, ^ July 1910. To The Political Agent, BAHREIN. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 428 of 17th June and previous correspondence on the subject of the attitude of the local Persian authorities in the Gulf Ports, and of Haji Abdul Nabi in Bahrein in connection with the Pass port Question. 2. The documents received with your letter above quoted * (which are returned herewith) are not 'passports' properly speaking. A 'passport' is a document issued by a Grovornment to its subjects when they wish to travel in a foreign country, whereas those documents are 'passes' purporting to be for use in case of persons travelling between one internal part of i Persia andmother internal port of Persia. Similarly, the Certificates issued and furnished by Haji Abdul Nabi to persons leaving Bahrein are intended to indicate that the bearer of the pass, seeing that he is only passing from part of Persia (Bahrein!) to another port, Bushire, is entitled to exemption from passport fees on arrival at Bushire. It is apparentl^ device which the Persian Government have bethought themselves of for promoting their cherished claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. His Majesty's Minister has asked instructions from the Foreign Office as to whether and what, if any, protest should be made to the Persian Government. I will let you know the result in due course. If His Majesty's Government decide not to trouble to make any protest at Teheran, it may still be feasible Ifaasible an&lt;i advisable for Sheikh Esa to take his own measures, to suppress Haji Abdul Nabi, but for the present no special action should bo taken beyond keeping an eye on the latter's doings.

Pending further communication from you, T am posting copies to India.Buohire /tesidency October 13th 1911, &amp; ' *'&gt; dear . orimer . Please see the correspondence regarding Abdu Nabi Kal Ewaz and the passport question , ending with N Mackemzie 1 b letter No 678 dated 2nd October 1910 • He was here afterwards and we talked it over and T came to the conclusion that with a change of officers just coming on and with difficulties between ourselves and the Persian Govern -ment already galore , it would be better to keep the matter in abeyance for a bit , especially in view of the fact that we hoped soon to have an Qrder in Council for Bahrein which would greatly strengthen our own hands in Bahrein • There it has rested until now . It has however now been brought into issue again by the action of some of Shaikh Esa^ retainers sent over here to buy hawks . (i) an old man whom I kno^ 4uito T.ell named Ghaith and (ii) a companion named S&amp;ieh bin Faleh • They came armed with passpo -ports from Shaikh Esa duly countersigned by you , but the pass -port people at the Sustoms House told them that they did not recognise that passport and took it away • Instead of coming to complain they thereupon produced a Persian ' Ilm i Khabar ' signed by Abdu Nabi , and on the stregth of this they were ex- - cused fees , or let of as Persian arriving from one Persian port to another . Instead of myself raising the question with the Governor , I thought the best thing was to detain the men in the Residency and ship them back to Bahrein by the first opportunity ; this course would both be a warning to other -Bahreinis , and also show the local authorities that we had our eye on them in this -regard . I have written to Shaikh Esa by the hand of my Arab Munshi Haji Abdur Rezaq , who goes over to Bahrein lb§&gt; the mail in connection with another matter 9 on which I am writing to you separately) saying briefly what I have done , anc* that the men will be sent over by the ' Lawrence' in a day or two • Meanwhile I want to consult you as to the procedure which we had now better follow . The m atter was brought to my notice insuch a way here , that 1 could hardly ignore it without prejudiW toShaikh Esa's interests and our own ; but to pursue it at Bahrein means raising the question of the disposal of Abdu Nabi who is the fona et origo of the difficulty , At the time Mackenzie wrote his letter above referred to we were as I have mentioned above having a great many difficulties to cope with and his observations indicated that Abdu Nabi would not be easily disposed of . Now however we are in a much stronger positior , We are Just going to put a cavalry regiment into Bushire and another 1 hppe into Bunder Abbas for German .The South is in a thorough state of abysmal chaos , and no one will bother about Abdu Nabi I imagine . In any case I think all the arrangements I contemplated by Mackenzie for the disposal of suits for and against Abdu Nabi were unnecessary . i don T t suppose he owes much ; if he does he must havo got property in Bahrein . In case of claims owing to him , he can leave aome one with a vakalatnameh to represent him • 1 think all that would be necessary would be for Shaikh Esa to giving him warning , keep him under arrest preferably , we shoul •refuse to intervene , and he would be put on board a ship for Bu -shire . There is no possibility ef preventing him from trading al f -together in the Gulf ports all that can be done is to make sure that he does not return to Bahrein • q'f he is deported I do not see why if we drafted the necessary letters from Shaikh Esa , he should not be deported by the Lawrence at his request , as the matter is 4n any case one in which we sup -port him and shall probably have to discuss for him with the p er~ -sian Government The alternative is that Shaikh Esa should send for him , in your presence , confront him with some of his ' Ilm-i-ilhabar 1 papers and call upon him immediately to deposit say 10-000 rup^ees with Shaikh Esa as secuity for the future good behaviour of himself and his community or household at anyrate , wi oh the threat thhich J:ou could verbally endorse that if caught earing again he would foith -with be deported and would also lose his 10-000 rupees • That solution would perhaps offer less chonce oi complications in connection with claims by or against him , with Bome of which the German firm may be connected • I am very much occupied just now with urgencies on this side , bu it is possible I may be able torun over myself with the H Lawrencbut as regards myneir I can never tell the possibilities from one day to another ,so do not expect me till you see me , and if poa- -sible prepare your answer for despatch to me by return mail arri ~ving on 17th . Consult Shaikh Esa confidentially if necessary , the psition being that it is necessary in connection with this cas to deal with Abdu Nabi , does he still want to deport him and re- -alAse what it involves ( it not being feasible to leave him suf -cient time lor the settlement of cases for or against him ) or does he , and do you , consider that the deposit of 10,000 rupees for good behavious would be a simpler solution . In the case of deportation I would endeavour to run over in the ' Lawrence ' to see you and incidentally bring Abdu Nabi back , in the case of the 10,000 rupees security it would be unnecessary to do more than send the men asross in the ship • This ie a long rigmarile , but I have only had time to think as I typed •ADdun Naooi* I w&amp;lxx, time to triink# Tiie maui is not f I tiilnK f popular with any one aria id 01 low origin.

Things are oeooming very involvea ana airfioult here at present, thanks, I have ev»ry reason to oelleve, to the unwearying rualioioue machinations or Tusut Karioo. I have just oeen through troubled waters as regards Quarantine| the Landing Cargo question has tor some time oeen a souree of anxiety, and it has now come up in a very aggravated ana critical lorm; ana SoTi's case carries ditiiculties with it« Again, the Oazi, She^h Oasim, has oeen straining our relations oy undue persistence in attempting to throw responsioility ror the immorality or Mnfeiama on my shoulders ana lately by an act or familiarity amounting to aiscour- tesy. All these trouoles - ot which I cannot enter into the details - except the la^t small item, are ou^, almost without possibility of question, to the action or instigation of Tuauf Kanoo. 6. I should prefer, therefore, at the moment not to do anything overt to alienate the Persian party. Again, there is more work on hand^ at the moment than we can well deal with, and there is every prospect of work, ooth judicial and political, increasing* I do not, however, put forward as reasons for taking no action, out only to let you know the situation we shall have to face* 7. To return,then, to the question of deportation or security* Tnwwe nay oe some truth in the Shekh r s arguments against the lormar, especially as Aodon Naboi would presumaoly leave his brother here* The arrange ment of his aifairs too woula certainly give some trouble* I believe him, however, to oe quite solvent, ana probably with morewith more claims to recover tban to pay f but the bulk of ills assets are probably In Immovable property aaa not Iramediately -jpealisaoie. I have not yet oeen able to tina out ho* he stands witii tne Germans, Anotner argument against deportation is tnat I aoubt whetner any class or native opinion would hold the onence as great enough to justify the penalty. 8. As regards the security, there would prooaoly oe consideraole difiiculty in eatracting ^ 10 t 000 from him f snort or seising his property • Inhis late case, which I referred to you recently, he has got the Plaintiff to allow him a long time of grace to complete the payment of some 2000/-. Were this alternative deoiaed upon, I should advise that 9 1000/- or 9 2000/- of the V* 10,000 should oe made an actual fine. 9. I think that on the whole we should allow ourselves to oe guidea oy SheKh Isa f s feelings. If he continues as averse to deportation as he was the other day, I think we should not try to force it on Aim. He would not be grateful^ and would see to it that we were saaaled with all the odium. If he pockets any money over the matter, people will not so readily oelieve that hehas been forced to act entirely against his own wishes. 10.

The subject of Persian claims to Bahrain and the attitude adopted by the Persian Government in the matter of the protection of Bahraims in Persia, is doubtless familiar to Your Excellency, and it will be sufficient for me, before mentioning such local developments as have occurred since the matter was last under discussion, to refer to the correspondence ending with Sir G Barclay s despatch No. 116, dated 4th June 1909, to His Majesty s Foreign Office. o Durin^ 1QIO an arrangement was come to with the Shaikh of Moham- ^ . . , - merah, in regard to the protection of Vide enclosure to His Majesty's Minister s des- R i • fulfilled itS obiect in patch No. 3J5, dated 23rd December 1910, to His Bahrain WttlCn naS lUiniieu Rb UUJCCL, ... Majetty's Foreign office. S o far that no further question in this regard has arisen since then in Arahistan, where, so recently as June 1912, the interven tion ot His Majesty's Consul, in regard to a Bahrain subject, has been accepted, aonarentlv without demur, by the Provincial Director of Customs at Mohammerah. ^ * This departmental recognition has also d.'ocr^pa'KoNi 0 /ml«d C lrh nr No:e^be, been accorded, though with some hesita- 1912. tion, at Lingah.* a. in Bahrain itself, the element of petty difficulty and intrigue arising out of the lingering fiction regarding Persia's claim to the Islands, though for the time dormant, still survives. It will be remembered that in July ipiot His + Legation, to Retident, telegram No. 163,dated Majesty's Foreign Office agreed to the 1 7 th ]oly 1910. expulsion from Bahrain by the bhaikh of a certain Persian merchant Abdul Nabi, who had been constructively treating Bahrain as a Persian port by issuing internal coastal tezkarah passes to Persians proceeding from Bahrain to Persian ports. When, however, authority was received for this man's expulsion several circumstances combined to make it necessary to suspend action for the time : firstly, the Shaikh now proved un willing to act against Abdul Nabi, and secondly, it was discovered that the British Indian Director of Bahrain Customs had innocently, in the absence of Abdul Nabi, signed some passes to the same effect, without understanding the bearing of them.As we were at the time engaged in the framing of an Order in Council which would pnt us in a position for dealing with foreigners effectively ourselves, it was ought prudent by the Political Agent and myself, in view of the Shaikh's uncertain attitude and the above circumstances to postpone dealing with Abdul Nabi, until it had been brought into operation. The issue of the said Order has been delayed from month to month, but is on the point of issue, and meanwhile the objectionable practice has not of late been in evidence. ,, Having regard to the fact that the Persian Government based their claim S t V T ,gnty Bah . ram on no better grounds than a Convention, dated 1823 which was not only never ratified but was specifically repudiated by both the Persian and British Governments, the abandonment of the claim would not appear to involve to them any real loss of prestige or and by removing from the category of disputed issues a matter which has caused a vast amount of correspondence and no little diplomatic friction in the past, can only tend to improve our relations with the Persian Government and its local officials. to the rovemSt^irdia 0 ' deSPatCh t0 ^ MajeSty ' S Forei ^ 0ffice and C82FO—44—7-2-13—GCBP Simla.* which it was laikh's Abdul er has iwhile, claim dated y both Id not nd, by a vast only cials.

Bahrein^the 20th Deoeaber 13 e 7) In reply to your letter No. 5843 dated the 16th Dece*ber 1913 on the subject of the passports for Persian subjects travelling to and froa Bahrein. as you are no doubt aware when Sir Percy Oox paid a brief visit to Bahrein on 22nd Novoaber 1915 he directed »e to send for Haji AbduSi Nabi Kazeruni. When this individual turned up he was warned by Sir Percy that his practice of signing passports and thereby arrogating to hiraself the functions of a consular or passport Official was highly objectionable to the Jheikh and also to the British Authority ties. Haji Abdul Na.bi protested vehemently that he did not realise that he was doingobjectionaljle or that sign ing passports resulted in his assuBing a sort of official position (this was of course incrediEble) and that he was only doing what several other pers ^an Merchants had done before him. ihe Resident remarked that he had knowledge of other actions on his part open to objections such as his articles regarding Persia and Bahrein in the Habl-ul-matin and other papers# Haji Abdul Nabi protested that he wouldnever have signed paasporta had he known that the praotice JUmrr .j was objectionable and /| that he would never do it again^tfb aaked what he should do with the Persians when they come worrying hin for passesa and viaus# He told to aend then to the Political Agent interview them cloaed. 3.

The first part of the volume (up to folio 44) contains confidential correspondence between the years 1906 and 1907, in which Persia’s claim over Bahrain is discussed between high-ranking British Government officials. Much of this correspondence discusses Persia’s insistence of its claim on Bahrain, which is rooted in the 1822 agreement between the Fars authorities and the then British Political Resident Captain William Bruce, which subsequent British officials insisted was “not formally ratified by the proper authorities” (folio 21).The next part of the volume (folio 45 onwards) contains correspondence from 1910 to 1913 and involves British officials’ investigations into allegations that the Persian authorities were charging Persians reduced passport rates to travel from Persia to Bahrain. These reduced rates were of a level usually reserved for persons travelling from one Persian port to another, and the levelling of the same fee on Persian travellers headed for Bahrain, was seen by British officials as a manifestation of Persian claims of sovereignty over Bahrain. British officials particularly objected to the actions of one Bahraini resident, Haji Abdul Nabi, who signed passports of Persian travellers, “thereby arrogating to himself the functions of a consular or passport official” (folios 108-09). Most of the correspondence in this part of the volume is between the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox), and the Political Agent (Captain Francis Prideaux until 1909, Charles MacKenzie 1909 to 1910).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
