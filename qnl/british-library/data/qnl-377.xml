I am not in a position to dispute this statement, at the same time I consider it would be as we^l not to rUn the risk of . contamination; it is^ossible to keep the men of the escort to themselves since their quarters are practically % surrounded by buildings. At Bahrain, the Indian Officer in command informed me that seditious speeches had been delivered at the mosque, steps have been taken to keep the detachment away fromfrom bazaars and mosques for the future; the Consulate here Is not in such close proximity to bazaars etc as is the case at Muscat, but it will be readily understood that the risk of contamination is present and the best method of minimising it is by freque^nt changes. Should it be found impossible to sanction reliefs as asked for in my letter quoted above, T would suggest that Officers Commanding Companies (Coy. Hd. Qra• located at Charbar and Bundar Abbas respectively) be permitted to jr carry themout in their companies. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd/- H. H.

On the 11th or 12th of April a raid was carried cut by two shaikhs of the Mutair, Ibn akhwan and. Ibn Jarbu, against the I«wazin tribe of Kuwait• A number of camels and sheep were looted and many casualties are reported to have been inflicted. It is not know whether this raid was carried out with the knowledge or sanction of Ibn Sa^d, and the object, other than the acquisition of loot, is not clear. ( Authority - S.S.Os Basrah and Nasiriyah). MEETING OF AKHWAN CHIEFS IN BORAI D AK. b. Reports state that a general gathering of Akhwan Chiefs was summoned to mii:et Ibn Sa'ud in Boraidah about 4 -th April# The object of the meeting is unknown, (Authority - S.S.O, Nasiriyah). Comment. The summoning of this assembly and its subsequebt deliberations (about which no information has been received) may account for the rumours reported imminent by S.S.O.

CHANGES OF NAJDI AN GOV E RNORS • Reference paragraph 6 Suimnary of Intelligence No, S2 dated 21st April 192^. It appears from later informal tion that one of the objects of the recent conference at Boraidah, over which Ibn Sa^d presided, was the re-arrangement of Governors consequent Kioon the resignation or removal of Ibn ^ssaf from Jauf« It is reported that charges have been laid against Ibn 'Assaf of intriguing with the Trans-Jordaaian Government, Various successors have been named but it is believed that Ibn ^qaiyil is at Jauf and Abdul Aziz ibn Musa^ad, fKXKsxaiiy formerly Governor of Boraidah, at Hail, Abdullah Ibn Jiluwi, of Hctsa has been reports ed as the new Governor of Boraidah, but this has not been confirmed, and he has recently returned to Hasa kKsnxBaiafxxDCKl where he was holding a like appointment, (Authority - S.S.Os Baghdad,Busrah and Nasiriyah). Comment . - It is considered improbable that the detailing of new Governors was the only business transact ed at Boraidah, and it quite likely that discussion included the new situations which have arisen from the failure of the Kuwait conference and the assumption by King Hussain of the title 6f Khalifah. Whether plans for a future offensive against the Hedjaz or Trans-Jordania or both, which were doubtless considered at Boraidah, are for early or indefinite date is still uncertain; an early offensive seems rather less likely than before, but if Ibn Sa^d returns again to Boraidah from Riyadh, wither he proceeded for the ^d, the move may reasonably be taken as a danger signal.so /v)\/ ^ Tue Agency Bahrain 2^/6/24 rs The Hon'ble the Political Resident^Bushire.

The Air Officer Corananding desires me to express his thanks for your hospitality and assistance to the officers and men of the three aeroplanes which recently visited Bahrein. Squadron Leader Peck raised the question of the disposal of the petrol, oil and spares which were left under your charge; You will appreciate the fact that unless there is such a supply of these commodities at Bahrein it will not 'be possible to send any aircraft from Basrah at short notice, as, when they did arrive, they would naturally have to wait for petrol and oil to arrive by steamer for their next flight. On the other hand to raise the question officially would appear to be inopportune as it is non-British soil, and most unlikely to lead to any result. The most satisfactory method from our point of view would be for you to arrange a contract for the construction of a petrol store and store shed in some convenient place near your quarters where the petrol, oil and spares could be locked up. The cost of this 'building will naturally be the responsibility of this command, Would you please therefore consider these proposals and if possible obtain an estimate for the shed and forward this to Officer Commanding, Basrah Group, Royal Air Force. ^ D.

Prideaiuc, C .S .I., C.I .K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated Simla, the 13th October 192b. Withdrawal of military detachments in the Persian Gulf. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Ho. 912-i&gt;. # dated the 29th July 1925, addressed to His Maoesty f s Minister at Tehran, and repeated to you, I am directed to say that the question of the com- -plete withdrawal of the half battalion of Indian troops now distributed at various places in, the Persian Gulf is now under the consideration of the Government of India, and to request that they may be furnished with your considered views on the subject at an early date, and if feasible by telegram. 2. As you are aware. His Majesty^ Government have found it necessary to keep a force in the Persian Gulf at various times since about 1820, and continuously since 1911, in order to protect British interests. rhe strength of this force has varied from time to time according to the requirements of the situation, and had to be increased considerably during the war. 3. The necessity for the maintenance of this firce, which has entailed large expenditure of money, was accepted reluctantly by His Majesty's Government owing to the inability of the Persian Government to put their house in ordeand the idea has always been to withdraw the force as soon as the Persian Government were able to ensure the safety of the lives and property of British subjects in the Southern districts. This was explicitly stated by His ^jesty's Government in 1912 in reply to requests of the Persian Government for the withdrawal of British troops in the Persian Culf. In 1922 too, when the question was again raised by the Persian Government, His liajesty's Government expressed themselves as prepared to consider the withdrawal of the troops as soon as the Persian Government were able to raise adequate forces to replace them. Subsequently, in deference to Persian sentiment, it was decided in 1923 to withdraw the trcops in two stages, at first by reducing the strength to that obtaining before 1911, and later on as soon as circumstances permitted by withdrawing the remainder. The first stage has already been passed, and the troops in the Gulf have been reduced to the half batt- -alion which now constitutes the total strength of all the detachments both on the Persian as well as on the Arabian side of the Gulf. A recent proposal, urged mainly on administrative grounds, to reduce the strength of the detachment at Bushire to half a platoon and to transfer the rest, with headquarters, to Jask has been dropped owing to the opposition of His i^ajesty's Minister at Tehran, who thought that any such redistribution of troops in the Gulf would serve to stir up Persian susceptibilities. His iSajesty's Government agreed with this view, and considered that owing to the disturbed conditions then prevailing in Arabistan, it would be most inopportune to reduce the strength of the garrison at Bushire. 4. Ihere is at present, so far as the Government of India are aware, no immediate kkk cause for anxiety in Arabistan, and moreover, the Government of India do not consider, in the light of experience gained from the recent tribal descentdescent on Muhammerah, that the presence of a comparatively small force at Bushire could influence the situation in Arabistan to any appreciable extent, or would prove of any material help in an a crisis. From a military point of view, the retention of these small scattered detachments of troops in the Persian Gulf is totally unsouftd. f Ihe cost of their upkeep is great, and in the circumstances in which they are placed, their training suffers seriously. Apart from this, the withdraw€vl of these detachments will enable the Government of India to effect the disbandment ot one entire battalion, to which they are definitely committed in the interests of economy. 5. Further, in the light of present day conditions the continued retention of these detachments seems hare; 1 v liucebs* -ary. The value of these detachments in their present strength to give protection has decreased; the arms traffic in the Gulf has for some time past been reduced to small proportions, thus relieving the Government of india of the necessity of maint/aining guards on shore as a preventive now measure, and lastly the Persian Government have achieved an appreciable measure of success in securing control over this part of the country, and would no doubt be prepared to provide special guards for the protection of our Consulates, telegraphs and other establishments wherever and whenever necessary. In fact we already depend solely on the .ersiai guards provided by the Persian Government at many ol the Consulates in Persia, and there is no reason to suppose that British Consulates in the Gulf are in any way more exposed to danger than those in the interior. Indeed there^ seemi even less reason for maintaining our detachments in the Gulf while His Majesty's gunboats patrol the Gulf and have access to the ports where British Consulates and establishments are located. It is on this command of the sea rather than on the maintenance of scattered detachments that our prestige mainlj4 mainly rests. 6. There thus appears no longer any real need for maintain* -ing these detachments and the Government of India are im- -pressed with the financial and military considerations Whicl make their withdrawal a matter of pressing necessity. Politically, the Government of India are inclined to think that the withdrawal would be h warmly welcomed in Persia as a tangible proof of the friendly policy of non-interference and confidence in the Persian Government which His Majesty's Government are now pursuing in 'ersia. It should also, it is expected, restrict the scope of hostile Soviet propaganda, for we shall then have no troops left on Persian soil which the Russian Government could point to as evidence of British designs there. 7. There remains the question of the detachments at % Bahrein and MaBkat. r he political objections to the retention of troops in Persia obviously do not operate here, but the military difficulties are just as great. It is thought that the Levies at Maskat and Bahrein could now car out all local protective duties satisfactorily, but I am to ask for your views particularly on this question. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- A. £. B. PARSONS. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.Your letter No. 386-N., dated October l^tii. I agree that withdrawal is posBlble, but euggest that troope be ear -marked for despatch in an emergen- -cy from Basrah and India. Charbar and Jask stations are close to -t sea. Land side of each is atrongly foaddtftart proteoted by barbed wire. We should, I think, reserve title to criticise efficiency of Persian garrisons and to preso :or replaceraent if necessary. Hen Jam might be guarded by watch -men only, if Navy will pay for them. I would suggest withdrawal of military detach- -ment there some weeks before the others begin lo go. Bandar Abbas. I suggest that cavalty be increased from four to seven, as in Kerman, istan and ^eshed. Bushire. During the Tangistani scare whicli followed attack on Roberts last March we were not impressed by Persian measures to protect twenty-five houses of . urc- -peans scattered over eight square miles of 'Island'. I think we should have besides our two Besidencies a strong house in which to concentrate British community. 1 suggest that house now occupied by Military Detachment should be purchased or rented on long lease by Government. Ordinarily it can be occupied if terms are favourable by Residency Surgeon, Vice-Consul or other gentle- -men who often have difficulty in housing themselves. I also suggest increase of my cavalry guard from nine to sixteen as in Shiraz. It *It would not be imperative to mount more than twelve especially if Government would allow ue one motor cal; in addition. Both in Bushire and In Bandar Abbas it may be necessary to submit proposals for expenditure on housing of Persian Guards, as their mingling with our servants will not be free from objection. Muscat and Bahrain. I recommend that authority be granted for strength of each Levy Corps to be increased by fifty men. Would Government pay the emolu- -ments of Levy Commanders in whole or part as a set-off ? I suggest that this correspondence be shown to Grosthwaite in Delhi. RESIDEMT.r- ^ifrht mpkrsqmal.

Yours sincerely, is i&gt; /I MBHHHKHflS ANIZAH. i ANIZAH. to have come next, and towards the end ot the The great group of the Anizah, numerically probably the largest group in the nomad Ara &gt; tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian Desert or Hamad, which has its base on ^btuc e . with Jauf about as its centre, and its apex at Aleppo. On the left bank of the Lupin ates u pastures North of Dair al Zor and along the Khabur are also visited by the Anizah. A smalle group of kindred tribes is seated round Taima between the Hejaz Railway and the S. W bou us of the Nefud. These will not be further discussed here. The ' Anizah belong to the people of the North Ahl-al-Shimal. The modern ' Anizah tribesman will always claim descent from Wa'il. who belonged to a younger branch ol the Asac group and relate that it is his son ' Anaz who is the founder of the tribe. 1 he tribe is not um ec under one head, but divided into several large sections which maintain an attitude generally fnendlv but which does not exclude raids and feuds between the sections. Their original home is believed to have been a little North of Madinah on the watei shed between the Red Sea and the basin of the Wadi-al-Rummah. In the second halt of the eighteenth century one of those mysterious impulses which, from the beginning of historic times, have set the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula moving Northwards—influences which may spring from an almost imperceptible change in climatic conditions coupled with the gradual increase of population in a land incapable of supporting more than very small numbers—began to disturb the Am/ah and portions of the Shammar. The former tollowed on the heels of the latter into Hamad. The Fad'an and the Hasanah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates and established themselves on le Northern steppes, which are less arid than the wastes of Central Arabia. The ' Amarat, Wulud Ali and Saba' seem eighteenth century the Ruwallah. Their herds have flourished in a climate more benelicient than that which they left I he most famous stocks of horses and the greatest number of camels are found amongst the Northern Anizah Their camel herds are estimated at 6,00,000 head in all, and supply the markets of Egvot Syria and 'Iraq. Badawin of the purest blood and tradition, the Anizah remained entirely beyond the control of the Turkish Government, and, except for a few palm gardens on the Lower Euphrates and a village near Damascus, their Shaikhs have given no pledge to civihza ion and established order by the acquisition of settled land, nor is any part of the Hamad plowed and harvested. Their geographical position gives them the command of the main trade route between Syria and'Iraq, and at the same time compels them to keep on good terms with those who control their commercial markets, i. e., the larger towns on both edges of the Syrian desert. The ' Anizah are hereditary foes of the Shammar and the history of northern nomad Arabi for the last 150 vears has been dominated by the feuds of these two tribal confederations. 'AMARAT (FAHAD BEG IBN HADHDHAL). The ' Anmrat range the eastern portion of the Hamad from Wes^ of Najaf to Dair al Zor In early spring they are usually in the wide depression known as Al Ga rah round Bir Mulussa, 80 miles S W of Abu Kamal. In summer they go to the Euphrates between Ramadi and Dan a Zor. In autumn they usually camp on the edge of the desert West of Karbala in the vicmity ot Shifathah and Rahaliyah. They number some 4,500 tents and 5,000 rifles. Fahad Beg entered into alliance with the British after the fall of Baghdad in 19!/, and has been consistently friendly ever since. He owns an estate at Razazah, 15 miles N. W. of Kaibala. He is now a very old man. but still has a great reputation in the desert. He cordially dislikes the Turks. His son Mahrut manages the active affairs of the tribe. The ' Amarat are friendly with the Dulaim and bitter enemies of the Shammar °! , tht j Jazirah and of the Southern Shammar. They were on bad terms with the Ruwallah. but Pahad Beg and Nuri-al-Sha'lan have now come to an understanding. Their relations with the Saba and Fad'an are not cordial. It is extremely unlikelv that the ' Ainarat will depart from their friendly relations with us depending as they do almost entirely for then supplies on the markets of Najaf, Karbala Shifathah, Rahaliyah and Baghdad. Fahad Beg has received a monthly subsidy of Rs. 17,000 from us since the fall of Baghdad.;/ AN1ZAH. KUWALLAH. (NUKI-AL-SHA'LAN). The chief importance of the Kuwallah from our point of view is the fact that they command the Hit-Damascus road, one of the main trade routes between Syria and 'Iraq. With their powerful confederates the Wuld Ali, the Muhailaf and the Hasanah, who usually in the closest relations with them, they number 7,000 tents. The Ruwallah alone number 5,000 rifies. They wander over the desert from Hama and Homs in the north, where the Hasanah have their summer pasturages and are beginning to settle down as cultivators, to Qasr-al-Azraq, South of the Jabal Druz and down the Wadi Sirhan to Jauf. They extend to the east as far as the sources of the Wadi Hauran. In summer they draw into the Wadi Sirhan. The paramount chief of the Kuwallah is Nuri-al-Sha'lan, whose authority is also recognised by the Wuld 'Ali and the Muhailaf. He is one of the most powerful of all Badawin chiefs. He is bitterly hostile to the Turks and has allied himself with the Sharif. He is not too friendly towards the British and dreads any extension of civilized authority into the desert. After his capture of Jauf from the Shammar of Ibn Rashid in 1912, he was the most successful rival of the Southern Shammar, but Ibn Rashid succeeded in re-capturing Jauf in 1920. The Ruwallah were at one time on bad terms with the Amarat, but Nuri al Sha'lan and Fahad Beg came to a friendly agreement in the spring of 1921J /2-^ 2 No Of 1926 British Residency * Consulate General, Bushire, the &lt;^ u October 1926• a copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to the political Agent, Behrein, for information. $ •&gt; By order. ip vl Captain, Secretary to the political Resident in the Persian Gulf • Endorsement from the Army Department, No. a-39379/5 iA.Gr .2), dated the Slst: September 1926 with enclos ure^.

The military authorities have recently made a detailed assessment of their requirements on mobilization, and find that some 1,850 additional officers are re quired to initiate and operate the mobilization arrangements. The actual strength of the present Reserve is about 150. The conditions hitherto in force have entirely failed to attract a sufficient number of candidates, and no improvement could be expected so long as these conditions were maintained. The new scheme which is based entirely upon voluntary enrolment depends for success on the goodwill and co-operation of employers both official and non- official, and it is considered that a lead given by Government departments will have an important influence in securing the number of officers required. It is therefore hoped that the scheme will receive the active support of the Government of Bombay and that civilian officials employed under the Bombay Government will be actively encouraged to join the reserve to the fullest extent compatible with the efficient maintenance of the civil administration in peace and war.

We have no liiliiary He port as is the case with the Persian areas, and in the event of military operations becoming necessary, as might have been the case last year at Sur, we should he unable to provide such essential information as the location of water, supplies, camping grounds, communications, landing facilities, etc. 4. 1 would therefore recommend that a specially selected officer be sent to Bahrain or Muscat during ^he cold weather to compile a Military Heport with the assistance of the Political authorities, 5).xi.O. Persian Gulf and ^oyal Air .b'orce officers at Basrah. i 5. I suggest the officer be sent under the guise of an Arabic language officer am. his travelling expenses be paid by the General Staff. 6.
