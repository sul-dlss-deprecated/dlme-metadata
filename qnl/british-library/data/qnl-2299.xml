To Tjr The Britiah Le^ation,^ Nepal. ^PL L llie 27th April 1956. /u/ 7 My dear Letcalfe, Li 'r/' &lt; 3'// After reading the account of the difficulties which were entailed in the proposal to send an aeroplane to Lhasa, it has occured to me that should it ever be necessary in future to consider this subject, it would be very worth-while to enquire into the possibilities of flying there in a machine which would settle on and take off from water. I have seen the river at Jalpaiguri and it seems to me that there, or thereabouts, are large enoi^i/ areas of still water for the purpose, jj'rom there the plane would have to go^ Rham lake, the straight line distance is about 120 miles flying over the Himalayas. The highest pass the Tang La is 15,200 feet high and the level of the lake 14,700. Tha lake is over 10 miles long. From here not only to Lhasa but to the North of Tibet is a string of lakes which can be seen from any map of the country. As far as landing in Lhasa is concerned my impression is that the river in tl neighbourhood of Lhasa is quite sufficiently wide and water almost still. Even if there were difficulties in landir^ at Lhasajp I am sure, a landing could be effected on the Tsangpo south of Lhasa. Here the river is in places as much as a mile wide in sumner and t water without appreciable current arkl the road journey on to Lhasa would be a couple of days. I am, of course writing this frozq^ memory and all 1 would suggest is that this question might be gone into if you consider i worth-while. I wrote a note on the part of the Tsang^o south of Lhasa in * Geographical Journal sometime in 1925 and I think there were probably photos with that, which would show what I mean. Unfortu tely I have not got a copy of this paper here. I donot think this plan would be feasible in winter when the lakes are frozen and the rivers might have tibcks of ice floating down them.
