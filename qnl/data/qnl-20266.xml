It notes however that he departed peacefully, and did not undertake any hostile or irregular acts at sea. It reports that the Resident has declined to get involved, though it notes that some level of interference may have been required had the Shaikh opted to blockade Bushire or Karrack [Khārk, Jazīreh-ye].It explains that the Resident considers the Shaikh's claims to be either unjustified, or hiding an ulterior motive. It therefore outlines the Resident's position that he should not be permitted to prosecute his claim through hostilities at sea; it explains this would be contrary to British policy of discouraging hostilities between parties on opposite sides of the Persian Gulf, and cites the example of British policy towards Shaikh Abdullah ben Ahmed [‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah] in support of this claim.The letter also explains that the Resident considers Shaikh Houssein Nasir's restoration to power as not being in British interests, and outlines his history of 'anti-British' behaviour to argue his point.The item has four enclosures:1. Translation of a letter from Meerza Hussan Alee Khan, the Dureya Beggee to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 16 September 1853.The enclosure is informing the Resident that Shaikh Houssein Nasir 'a traitor [who] has rebelled against his own country' has travelled to the region to cause 'mischief'; it notes that as he does not come ashore, and can only be acted against at sea. It therefore includes a request that the Resident uses British forces to repel him.2. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Dureya Beggee, Governor of Bushire, dated 16 September 1853.The enclosure conveys the Resident's refusal to get involved in the case of Shaikh Houssein Nasir, which he regards as an internal Persian matter; it also notes that he does not have a ship available to deploy in any case. It does however state that the Resident should be informed of any irregularity the Shaikh commits at sea.3. Translation of a letter from Meerza Hussan Alee Khan, Governor of Bushire to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 17 September 1853.The enclosure claims that Shaikh Houssein Nasir's movements are manifestly irregular, and expresses the Governor's hope that the Resident will take measures against him.4. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Dureya Beggee, Governor of Bushire, dated 18 September 1853.The enclosure explains that unless Shaikh Houssein Nasir commits any irregular acts at sea, it is not within the Resident's power to interfere.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000021#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
