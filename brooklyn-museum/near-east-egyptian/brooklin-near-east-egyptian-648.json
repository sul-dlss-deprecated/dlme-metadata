Under Amunhotep II and Thutmose IV, for example, craftsmen increased the use of a soft, pastel blue pigment that had been invented during the reign of Thutmose III. Potters also molded vessels in human and animal form, and artisans rediscovered the Middle Kingdom fascination for colorful stones such as red carnelian. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt historians consider the scarabs (beetleshaped amulets) of this era among the finest ever made.
