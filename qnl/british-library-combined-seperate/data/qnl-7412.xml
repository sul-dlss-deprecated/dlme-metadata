Yeates enquires as to whether subjects of the Hadramaut enjoyed capitulatory rights in Egyptian courts. The correspondence consists of a detailed legal discussion of the various definitions of 'British Protected Persons'. In the end it is communicated to Yeates that a decision regarding the jurisdiction of Consular Courts in Egypt over Hadramaut subjects will be provided by the Secretary of State, but only in the event that such a question is addressed to him through one of the courts.The papers dated 1936 (folios 2-8) consist of minutes made by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, Indian Vice-Consul at Jedda. The first minute concerns meetings in Mecca with a Hadramaut subject named Seyyid, and a separate meeting with Shaikh Ali Abdullah Ba Dagaub. They discussed attempts by Osman al Amoudi, leader of the Irshadiya movement in Java, to open schools in the Hadramaut. Al Amoudi is said to have the backing of the Saudi Government. Shaikh Ali also discussed Saudi relations with tribes in the Hadramaut. The second minute documents a meeting with Shaikh Osman el Amudi and Shaikh Ali Badgaish, where they discussed the Qaity dynasty, Saudi intentions towards Hadramaut territories, and dissatisfaction with British involvement in the Hadramaut.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Vice-Consul, Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Hadramaut Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Legal status</topic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Nationality</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000001#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000001#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000001#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
