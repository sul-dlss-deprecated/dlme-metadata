Sir, I have the honour to refer to Mr.Laithwaite f s letter No.P.Z.224/34 dated the 10th January 1934 to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York and to say that the Adviser to the Bahrain Government tells me that the business in question was connected with the supply of domestic refrigerators, for which the Bahrain Government have arrangei in order to encourage increased use of their electric power.Bahrain, January 22, 1934. Dear Colonel Loch, With reference to our conversation yesterday neither I nor Steele have ever heard of or had any dealings with the Guarantee Trust Company of New York. For some years the Bahrain Electric depart ment has corresponded with the Internation General Electric Company (America) from //horn we have pur chased most of the refrigerators in Bahrain. During the last year there has been corres pondence between Steele in his capacity as State Engineer with the International General Electric Company in connection with sales and the possibility of our becoming the sole agents for the refrigerators of this Company. The Company has agreed that we should act as their agents, which suits us, but no agreement has yet been signed although we intend to undertake it. I cannot understand what the Guarantee Trust Company have to do with the matter. Yours sincerely, Lieut Colonel G. Loch, H. B.
