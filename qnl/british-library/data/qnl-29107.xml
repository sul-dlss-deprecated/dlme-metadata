Indian .Judges of the Judicial Oo-'inittee of the Privy Council. Under the appellate jurisdiction Act there are two Judges of the Judicial COiiiidttee of the Privy Council - one European and one Indian - appointed from among ex- Judges of Indian High Courts. Half the salaries of these two judges are paid by India and half by the Treasury. On the assumption that India goes out of the Empire, the appointment of the Indian judge -vitl presumably have to be terminated unless it were decided that he should continue in office even though Indian appeals had ceased to come to the Privy Council. In this event the Treasury would 'nave to pay his whole salary and an amendment of the Act would be required. In any other event, statutory provision might be required to terminate his appointment. The circumstances in which it can be terminated at present need looking into. As a pendant to this I asked Mr. Rowlatt what should be done about appeals which were already under way in the Privy Council at the date of severance. He thought that they should be cut off and not completed, but this might be a matter for discussion and agreement with the new authorities in India. It should be taken up with the Lord Chancellor. 2. Convicts . There is provision whereby (a) Europeans serve sentences in Indian gaols, (b) Europeans sentenced in the Indian Courts for long terras of imprisonment serve their sentences in English gaols. It seems desirable to arrange for Europeans serving sentences in Indian gaols to be got out and transferred to this country, and for consideration to be given to the position in regard to those serving sentences in this country. 3. Lunatics . There will probably be both criminal and ordinary lunatics detained in India in institutions and these will include some Europeans. Should anything be done about thurr 4. Ships . A British ship is any ship registered in a part of H. M. 's dominions. The ordinary thing is for the ship to be registered at the port where it is launched. The position probably is that there are ships on the Indian register owned by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire, and also by companies owned by Europeans and incorporated in India. There are also ships on the United Kingdom register owned by Indians. There is provision whereby the port of registration of a ship can be changed.' It may be that the owners of most ships, seeing what is coming, have taken anyI - 2 - necessary steps to ensure that their ships do not pass into Indian ownership. But there may be cases where this has not been done. It is for consideration whether any action should be taken to deal with this situation. There is also the question of ships on the British register and in Indian ownership. 5. Aircraft . There is a similar problem about aircraft, though probably small in size if it exists in practice at all. Mr. Rowlatt drew attention in passing to the fact that there must be a good deal of property spread out over Northern India owned by the B. 0. A. Cl He thought the position about this ought to be looked at. 6. Customs . As a part of the British Commonwealth, India gets Empire treatment in Customs matters. In addition there are the Ottawa Agreements, was this stricture to be regarded as cancelled if India went out of the Empire or was any attempt to be made to keep it in being in some new form. I pointed out that a foreign India could not have Imperial Preference because all other foreign nations entitled to m. f. n. treatment could then claim the same, I also said that this appeared to be a particular instance of the whole corpus inter-imperial Agreements to many of which India is a party, would not all these automatically come to an end when India ceased to be in the Commonwealth? Mr. Rowlatt thought that they would unless in any case it was in Imperial interests to keep them in being and we wished to have some special arrangement to do so. This appears to involve an examination of all these Agreements and decisions as to what is to be done about them. It also raises the question '. hat happens about these Agreements if power is handed over to more than one authority. 7. Income Tax . At present there is a double tax relief system between this country and India. On the assumption that there will be British companies trading in India, in the future it will be desirable to temper the wind to them as much as possible. Consideration should be given as to whether any thing can be done by agreement with the new Indian authorities to keep this system in being pending the negotiation of a new one. 8. runna . (a) There are provisions in the Burma Act giving protection against discrimination to Indians in Burma. If India goes out of the Commonwealth these provisions appear to be inappropriate and should be repealed. I said that the pace at which Burma was proceeding towards a new constitutionprobably made it unnecessary to take any steps about this, but the matter bad better be looked at. ( 1 °) Burma’s currency is related to India and the Reserve Bank. I told.Mr. Rowlatt that tnis arrangement )^as already being revised and that a Qurrency Board for Burma was being set up in London independent of tbe Reserve Bank. This point bad, however, better be examined also. (c) There is an Order-in-Council under both tbe Government of India Act and tbe Government of Burma Act regulating immigration and providing against prohibited duties. This may require modification. 9. Divorce . The fundamental principle of Divorce Law is that tbe _ l ^^-^ rrr . Courts of the p lace of domicile have jurisdiction. By inai^TiKeivoroc a^L, 1926, arrangements were made ^ whereby English Divorce Law is administered by specially appointed Judges of tbe Indian High Courts. Tbe Judges are nominated subject to tbe approval of tbe Lord Chancellor and decrees etc. granted by tbe Indian Courts are recognised by tbe English Courts, jurisdiction in respect of subsidiary matters such as alimony is with tbe Indian Courts so long as tbe parties are m India, and British Courts when they return to this country, nr. Rowlatt considered that this arrangement must necessarily fall if India became foreign and probably also if India remained in the Commonwealth but became independent. The degree of supervision of tbe Indian Courts in these matters under this Act is such as to be inconsistent with tneir independent status and it is an important feature of tbe scheme that European Judges of the Indian High Courts are chosen to exercise tbe jurisdiction. Fresumablv the European judges will rapidly cease to exist. It may be necessary, however, to take some legislative power to transfer to tbe English Courts jurisdiction in respect of such matters as alimony while the parties are in India. Mr. Rowlatt thought it would be a great relief to petitioners if pending cases at the date of severance could be completed in the Indian Courts. 10 . ferriage. Mr. Rowlatt thought it would be necessary to provide new arrangements whereby European British subjects can be married in India after it ceased to be in the Commonwealth, ihe Foreign Marriages Act would have to be applied to India so- that marriages can take place before the British Consul. Tnis would certainly be necessary in places like Hyderabad where, I believe, marriages at present take place before the Resident. Mr. Rowlatt pointed out the importance of ensuring that when the existing arrangements change the ract is made widely known. Otherwise individuals are liable r*7 - o -- 4 JO) pi to got marriod by t'ae procedure discover years aftewards that ii. Fugitive Criminals . hitherto in their marriage force and to is invalid. There is at present an Empire-wide system of backing of warrants. Under this, the Police in all parts of the Empire cooperate in the apprehension of all fugitive riminals. This will have to be replaced by an extrcationTteaty with India if anything of the kind is to continue. Mr. Rowlatt drew attention to the fact that there would be warrants out at the time of the transfer of power and that if possible the Treaty should contain arrangements for existing warrants to remain valid. 12. Companies. There are registers of companies in the different parts of H.' . »s dominions. It will be necessary to take steps to close the Indian register. 13. Trustee decuriLles . The Indian sterling securities and Indian railway securities take steps on what is over by H. ] will not in lieu. are trustee stocks. It may be necessary to to alter this. (This will depend, of course, done about these securities). If they are taken LG. in return for a capital pay.lent the point arise as no doubt sterling securities will be issued 14. Army. Air Force and Naval Liscipline Acts. If there is any possibility of British forces remaining in India under the new dispensation these Acts will need revision to put them on the same basis as in the case of the Dominions, or on some new basis if India is a foreign power. For example, there is provision in the Army Act for the confirmation of sentences by the Governor General of India. Something of the nature of the Visiting Forces Act will be required. 15. Medical and Dental Professional Qualifications. Something may be required to be done about the continued recognition of professional qualifications by the new Indian authorities. 16. Evidence. Mr. Rowlatt thought there w; s an arrangement for reciprocal taking of evidence before United Kingdom and Indian Courts. This might have to be terminated.'17. Aden. New provision Courts in Aden to (vide Section 288 must be made for appeals from the a High Court elsewhere than in India of the Act and connected Order-in-Counci1). 18. Indian Church Act. Mr. Rowlatt had gone into this ii some detail. It appears_that there are some churches m India which are vested in the Indian Church Trustees and maintained wholly or partly at the expense of the Government of India, and otner churches which are vested in the Government of India. Many of these churches are for the use of the military and are in remote places, for example on the Frontier, where the Indian Church as such would probably not wish to maintain them if the Europeans who attend them are withdrawn irom India. On the other hand, there are probably among the churches vested in the Government of India some in Calcutta, Bombay etc. which have been primarily for the benefit of civilians in Government service but are attended also by ohe European business community. It may be desired that these churches should continue. Mr. kowlatt lelt that this was not a matter which could be dealt with by tae Treaty or by United Kingdom legislation. It would have to be arranged on the spot between the Indian Church ana the new Government of India. He felt, however, that tais Act was an example which showed the desirability of th. new Indian constitution containing a provision comparable oo that in the Eire constitution which provides for all existing laws to remain in force until amended. It may b desirable to try and get a provision of this kind into th^ Indian constitution.FILE COPY. w FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W, 1.

Kent- Please refer to your letter No, Ext. 5 795/4 7 of the 14th March to Kitson about extra-territoriality In Tibet and Nepal. This question ha$ been re-examined in the light of your comments, and after consultation with our Legal Adviser, we agree with your view that our surrender of extra-territoriality in China has no application to Tibet. C/tj }&gt;b Y ou W 1H remember that in War Cabinet paper W.P. (43)267 of 23rd June, 1943^ we were avfoorized to offer to recognise Chinese suzerainty over Tibet on the understandirj that Tibet is regarded as autonomous. This offer was in fact never made to the Chinese, who continue to regard Tibet as part of China, and who, as you will recollect, last t year induced members of the visiting Tibetan mission to participate in the Chinese National Assembly aa delegates of Tibet, a province of China. In the absence, therefore, of Chinese recognition of Tibet*s autonomy, we continue to deny even Chinese suzerainty over Tibet. But I should add that, even were Tibet to come to be regarded as part of the territory of China we do not think that the 1943 Treaty would be applicable to our extra territorial rights there, since by Article 2, the extra territorial rights surrendered are only those arising out of treaties or agreements between Great Britain and China and paragraph 1 of the Annex to the Treaty is linked with that Article. China was not a party to the 1914 Convention under which we acquired extra-territorial rights in Tibet. In view of the above we agree that therewould be no objection to the transfer to India, in our future Treaty with her, of the rights which His Majesty’s Government may still/ E. P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M. G., India Office.still retain in Tibet in virtue of the Trade Regulations of 3rd July,- 1914* _ We also agree that our policy towards Lepal should be guided by the considerations v/hich you mention, and that we should not transfer our rights under the Treaty of 1855 'k 0 Government of India. Whether or not we continue to maintain extra territorial rights in Nepal could be discussed at the time of negotiating the Jurisdiction Agreement, which would cover the organisation of Gurkha recruitment and the position of the recruiting mission. Normal diplomatic status will presumably be accorded to our representatives in Nepal, while the jurisdiction Agreement would cover the personnel of the recruiting mission. Once that has been clearly established the extra-territorial privileges under Article 6 of the 1855 Agreement could, when v/e feel the moment to be opportune, be allowed to lapse.India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1. , tx.

Would not suoh an admission be contrary to the terns of the Anglo-Tibetan Convention of 1914? However this the question ae are now considering is whether any^territorial rights which HM.G. may still retain in Tibet by virtue of the Trade ^Regulations of 3rd July 1914 should be transferred toa future Indian Govemiiient or not* I take it that your view it that the benefit of these regulations should. In oofonon with the obligations thereunder, pass to the new Indian Govesmsnt with the transfer of power* .hat the Indian authorities decide to do with thea after that is a matter for theta and not for ua* As regards i:epal, I should not have thought that the l epalese Goveruaent would have taken the line you suggest* They have never shown any resentment at these rights being retained, though in practice I fancy they are very seldom exercised. But they would hardly claisi that their judicial system is suoh that Britisn subjects in Nepal could be subjected to the jurisdiction of the l epalese Courts in any criminal aiatter. That being so, the quest ion now before us is not whether we should give u the rights which we enjoy under the Treaty of 18 5 between the hast Indian Company and the Eajah of Nepal, but whether those rights should pass to the Indian act oritiea. ur view would be that it &amp;• Y.

Ns regards Tibet, this was in 1943, and still is,technically part of the Republic of China, and therefore our surrender of extraterritorial rights took effect there on the 20th May, 1 943, v^hen the Nnglo-Chinese treaty of the 11th January,1943, was ratified. In any case, we agree that there can be no question of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom now exercising extraterritorial rights in Tibet. Ns regards Nepal, we are inclined to think that the Nepalese Government would resent being singled out for the retention of a system, which has been, discarded elsewhere as derogatory to toe territorial sovereignty of the country concerned. Persons attached to the British Legation would in any case enjoy immunities as usually accorded to diplomatic missions, while the case of British officers^stationed 1 in Nepal in connexion with Gurkha recruitment could '/be dealt with by a military jurisdiction agreement, ■such as th:t signed during the war and still in force with China. On the whole therefore we should be inclined to drop the idea of retaining extraterritorial rights in Nepal. V/ (G.V.

(S t 4) E P. DONM-DSOW -+ •Ext. 8326 A£ _ Dear Beckett, India Office, YThitehall, nondon, 3. W. 1 . 28th January, 1947. We have been considering the question of the amendments that will be necessary in the five Persian Gulf Orders,-in-Council (B.ahreiii, J913, Kowelt, 1*935, Qatar, 1939, Muscat, 1939 and Trucial States, 194^6) when control in the Gulf is transferred ; from the Government of India to li.k.G. on the 1st April, 1947, as is contemplated, bearing in mind the possibility that the Indian Constituent Assembly may before long decide to leave the British Commonwealth. 2. It seems that the problem falls int o two parts. - ..Firstly, it must be decided what laws are to be applied in the Persian Gulf States. The present position is that specific British-Indian laws ,a^re applied by the Orders-in- Council, being either listed in the.schedules appended thereto or referred to in the body of the Orders themselves, and that other laws not specifically mentioned in the Orders-in-Council or their Schedules may be applied in the States concerned by the publications of King’s Regulations by the Political Resident, It is possible that an independent India might pass amendments to these laws which it would be undesirable to apply in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. There seem, to be, therefore, three possible courses for the future: (a) The Indian lav/s at present applied could remain in force but specific amendments to them would require to be applied by Regulation made by the Political Resident before coming into force in the Persian Gulf; (b) The Indian laws at present applied could remain in force but no Indian amendments would apply to them, the Political Resident applying any necessary amendments from time to time as occasion arose; (c) The existing (predomin.uitly Indian) legal system could be scrapped and the corresponding English lav/ substituted, with such adaptations and modifications as appear necessary. It seems to us that, apart altogether from the special provisions required for the determination of tim. various questions arising under Hindu and Mohammedan personal lav/, it would bu highly inexpedient to scrap the British-Indian legal framework tj which the inhabitants of the area are accustomed and with which the Political Officers who administer the law are familiar. Instead of the application of English lav/, which would in mary ways be inappropriate to the conditions, v/e consider, therefore, that the course^ indicated in (b) above is probably the most suitable. 3. The second question is how the functions at present attributed under the terms of the Orders to various Indian authorities are to be performed after the removal of the Persian Gulf administration from the supervision of the. Government of India* Whatever system of lav/ is adopted, it will no longer be possible for reports and references to be made to Indian authorities, or for the deportation to, or trial of accused persons in, India to take place. These functions will have to be transferred to appropriate British authorities. In particular shall have to consider what authority should replace the Governor- General in Council in paragraph 16 of the K owe it Order-in-Council (and correspondingly in the other Orders) for the purpose of confirming death sentences. This is a matter on which we should perhaps consult the Lord Chancellor's Office or the Treasury Solicitor. We should also like to get clear the question of appeal from the decision of the local courts. There / seems W.E.

Konteath's circular to H.D. s of 30th January, regarding legislation to effect the transfer of power. Hr. Baxter drew rny attention to the fact that Section 283 provided for placing upon Indian revenues the liability for certain pensions,and pointed out that it was not practicable for British legislation of the kind envisaged to keep in being a provision that the cost of these pensions shall fall on Indian revenues. I have spoken to Hr. Rowlatt. what he desired to point out was that, if it was intended that the Treasury or some other Department acting on behalf of H. L. G. was to continue to disburse the money due to the pensioners referred to in this Section, then there must be some statutory authority for tnem to make the payments in lieu of Section 283. If, therefore, it is decided that H.. .G. should take over the liability,vis-a-vis the individuals, in return for a lump sum settlement with the Government of India, legislative provision is necessary to authorise disbursement so the individuals. Hr. Baxter has pointed out that Section 282 is in the same class in that it directs payments to be made out of Indian revenues. I have been requested by Sir /illiam Croft to draw your attention to the above point and also to emphasize that it is not, of course, practicable to include in the proposed British legislation provisions intended to operate in India or to be mandatory upon the future Government of India. The only way anything of that sort can be achieved is by the proposed Treaty arrangements. F.F. TURNBULL 11/2/47.HEADS OF DEPART ENTS . I Legislation to efiect the transfer of power 1. It is desirable that consideration should be given as a matter of some urgency to the legislative provision which will be necessary go effect transfer of power in India. 2. Hr. Turnbull has had a discussion with Mr. Rowlatt on these matters and a copy is annexed of a note of the points which r. Rowlatt has made as a result of a preliminary survey of the position. Mr. Rowlatt may produce further points later. In the meantime at Hr. Rowlatt's request a circular letter has been addressed to all Government Departments, a copy of which is also attached. 3. Each Department of the India Office should survey very closely its field of activity with a view to bringing to notice any points on which action will be required in connection with the transfer of power in India. The survey should aim at establishing:- (i) That provisions of the Government of India Act and the Orders-in-Council, statutory rules, and other instruments under it, must be kept in being in whole or in part. (ii) ,/hat modification or adaptation of those provisions will be required. (iii) What amendments of the existing law of this country, other than the Government of India Act, will be required. In considering these matters consideration should be given to the three possible alternatives - (a) that India becomes a foreign State. (b) that India remains within the Commonwealth. (c) that power has to be transferred to more than one authority in India. The recommendations for action should indicate, so far as possible, how they would require to be modified in the event of (b) or (c). 4. Departments of the India Office responsible for or concerned with the various matters referred to in the notes of Hr. Turnbull's interview with Mr. Rowlatt should give those matters early consideration and should, if necessary, enter into correspondence with the appropriate Government Departments in Whitehall in /regardregard to them with a view to reaching agreed conclusions as to shat steps, it vili be necessary to take in each case. Any new matters which come to notice as a result of the survey of the field undertaken in che India Office and which are of concern to other Departments of H. H.G. , should be brought to the notice of those Departments with reference to the circular letter, of which a copy is annexed. It is requested that copies of any such correspondence bo ~ent to the Secretary of the Political Department (Constitutional). 5. It is desirable tho.t the survey of these matters should be pressed forward as raoidiy as possible. The aim should be for Departments to complete their investigation and to have reached conclusions on the points with which they are concerned not later them the middle of March. It is however desired that Departments should report by the 20th February ail matters which it is considered will require provision by legislation or Order-in-CounciI even though further time is required to consider the nature of the provision which will have to be me.de.SECRET X Note of an interview with Parliamentary Counsel, on January. ]947 Mr. Rowlatt, the 22nd • invited me to see him in order that he might outline to me orally the preliminary results of nis conversation of the legislative measures which would be required to give effect to the transfer of power in InJ Hr. Rowlatt began by saying that, while as a general proposition it was fair to say that the main effect it was desired to produce could be achieved by a short measure repealing the Government of India Act, there were certain Sections of the Act which must be kept in being. Up to the present he had noted the following:- , Section 2 88 relating to Aden . This is the iegal basis for the separation of Aden from British India c.nd ol an Order-in-Counci 1 which makes provision for the Government of Aden after separation. Hr. Rowlatt drew attention tip the fa«t that, under sub-Section 288(4). appellate jurisdiction from courts in Aden may be r 0 ^. 0 ,^ f0u rt in India as may be specified in Order', and that, in pursuance of this, appellate -juris diction now lies to the High Court of Bombay. This will require alteration. ' ^ (As a pendant to this Hr. Rowlatt drew attention to the probability that appeals lie from foreign jurisdiction courts in; the Persian Gulf and possibly in iibet, Nepal and Afghahistan, to High Courts in India. This also will require attention). 2 - Section 273, under which there is an Order-in- Gouncil providing for the vesting in Commissioners of certain Family pension Funds, must be kept in being. 3* occtun 285 about liability for pensions in respect o^ service before the commencement of part III of the Act must be retained. , ygctions 311(5) and 178(2) make provision whereby Acts of Parliament may be adapted by Order-in- i Extensive adaptations have been made and these t-Xn h S t&gt; 61n £ thbugti, of course, new adaptations 11 be required. Most of the adaptation arose from the nan^ P t£ 10n X from India and consists of inserting the word Bunn;-’, after '’India' in large numbers of Statutes. , , addition to provisions of the Act which must be qP- f repealing legislation will have to make positive provision for certain matters. On a preliminary examination the following points had occurred to Mr. Rowlatt the /l.i. Provision for t'nc discharge of existing authorities froa their obligations under the Actj for example the discharge of the Secretary of State from liability to pay pensions. . . 2. a provision to deal with the Unclaimed Dividends Fund. This is a Fund to which are paid the dividends due to holders of sterling' India stocks who cannot be traced. Although most of the sterling stock has been bought out, it is possible that the untraceable holders have not been bought out. In any event some provision must be made as to the disposal of the Fund. 3. Provision in regard to property, e.g. the India Office. 4 . If required, a statutory provision for the Treasury to take over liability for payment of pensions etc. to exHiiembers of the Secretary of State's Services and also, if considered necessary, to provide statutory authority for payment bj&lt; the Bank of England of the necessary sum at the expense of India's sterling balances. It is, of course, desired to deal with this matter by agreement if possible. Mr. Rcwlatt then proceeded to deal with a considerable number of matters on which he thought provision or administrative arrangement would be required. These are dealt with in the Annexure? They are exemplary only and Mr. iiowlatt urged that all Departments in v/hitehall should be asked to examine the whole field of their activities with a view to seeing what matters would require to be dealt with on the transfer of power to India, and to make recommendations as to how they should be dealt with. These recommendations should be on the alternative hypotheses (a) That India stays in che Commonwealth. (b) That India becomes foreign. (c) That power is transferred to more than one authority. x The same as that attached to letter to Government Departments.Pol.10319/47. INDIA OFFICE, 'WHITEHALL. 28th January, 1947. Sir, I aui desired by the Secretary of State for India to bring to your notice that the India Office arse giving consideration to the legislation which will be required to effect the transfer of power in India to new authorities to be set up under the constitution framed by the Indian Constituent Assembly. You are no doubt aware that H..LG. have, in the Prime minister's Statement in Parliament of 15th March, 1946, made it clear that India is free to choose whether to remain within the . British Commonwealth, or to become a foreign state. 2. The Indian Constituent Assembly has begun its meetings and a resolution has been moved and passed declaring that the constitution shall be framed on the basis that India will become a sovereign independent republic. It must therefore be assumed to be probable that India will cease to be part of the British Commonwealth. The Constituent Assembly proposed by the Cabinet iission in their Statement of May 16th was intended to be representative of all parties in India and a particular procedure was laid down for the framing of a constitution which it was hoped would enable this to be done with the co-operation of all parties. Differences have, however, arisen between the Congress and the Muslim League as a result of which the Muslim League have withdrawn their co-operation from the Constituent Assembly and its representatives are not at present participating in its work. H.1LG. in their Statement of the 6th December last made it clear that, if a constitution should come to be framed by the Constituent Assembly in which a large section of the Indian population had not been represented, they could not contemplate forcing such a constitution upon any unwilling parts of the country. The implication of this Statement is that, if the constitution is framed without the co-operation of the Muslim League and is unacceptable to the parts of India v/here the Muslims are in a majority, H. M. G. will not be parties to imposing that constitution on those areas. The outcome may therefore be that power in India will have to be transferred to more than one authority. The manner in which this would be done if the circumstances arose has, however, not been decided upon. 3. For the time being the question of the legislation that will be required is being considered primarily on the basis that the transfer of power will be made to authorities set up with general agreement and covering the whole of British India. Parliamentary Counsel has given preliminary consideration to the matters which /wouldwould require.to be dealt with, in this legislation. In essence this would consist of (i) the repeal of the Government of India Act, with the exception of certain provisions which will require to be continued m operation, and (ii) the necessary legislative provisions to enable the sovereignty of British India to be transferred to the new Indian authorities. 4. Parliamentary Counsel have, however, drawn attention, as a result of their preliminary examination of the subject, .to a number of matters which v/ill require examination, and which appear at first sight to require consequential amendment of one or other British Act or of existing administrative arrangements. A list of these points is contained in the annexure. This list does not purport to be in any way exhaustive. The items in it which appear to be of special importance to your Department are:- I.am to request that.your Department will be‘ so good as to give particular consideration to these points and to give their views as to what they consider should be done to meet the situation in regard to them. These points are also being examined further in the India Office and your Department may be addressed further upon them. It is also requested that your Department will be good enough to survey generally the field of administration for which it is responsible with a view to raising any further points on which alteration or amendment of the law which it administers or of existing arrangements will be required consequentially upon the transfer of authority in India. 5, It would be convenient if in your reply you would deal with any points which arise in the light of the three possible alternatives - ' (a-) That India becomes a foreign power. (b) That India remains within the Commonv/ealth. (c) That power in India has to be transferred to more than one authority. 6, I am desired at the same time by the Secretary of State for Burma to point out that a very closely corresponding problem or series of requirements is imminent in relation to Burma. It is contemplated that a constitution making body will be set up in Burma in the early summer and since the constitutional problems confronting it are less complex than those with which the Indian Constituent Assembly is faced, it is not impossible that it may perform its task more rapidly and even complete it to the point of /indicatingindicating the form of constitution which Burma opinion recommends, before the end of the present year, Whatever the rapidity with which the Burmese constitution making body may progress with its task, legislation of the nature indicated in paragraph 3 above will be required in relation to Burma, equally with India, as well as the consequential legislation inoicated in paragraph 4 for the adjustment to the new conditions of such British Acts as it falls to your Department and others in this country to administer. 7. In the case of Burma, no less than India, it is at present impossible to say with any confidence which of the two alternatives (a) and (b) indicated in paragraph 5 above Burma will adopt, thcpi.gh so far as can be judged from the conversations just concluded with the Burma Delegation, there is a greater probability than in respect of India that Burma would opt to remain within the Commonwealth. So far as can be foreseen, there is no likelihood that alternative (c) in paragraph 5 would arise in relation to Burma, which since separation from India has been in effect a unitary State. 8. It will be seen therefore that in surveying, as requested in paragraph 4 above, the British Acts which your Department administers, it will be desirable to bear in mind the amendments or adjustments that will be necessary in relation to Burma as well as to India. In many cases no doubt these will be the same for the two countries under, in either case, the two alternatives that the country m question becomes a foreign power or that it remains within the Commonwealth. 9. I am reluctant to increase unnecessarily the burden which this letter imposes on your Department, and I would suggest therefore that in general yo. r reply should be adaressud to the Indian case and sent to the Under Secretary of State, India Office, with a simultaneous copy to the Burma Office and that m forwarding the copy to the latter, you should, the case arising, draw attention in a covering letter to any instances where in either of the two alternatives predicated the amendment required in respect of India will differ from that in respect of Burma, for whatever reason. 10. It is not possible to assess at present by v/hat date either the Indian Constituent Assembly or the Burma constitution making body will complete its work, but the Secretary of State considers that in order to be prepared for eventualities the preparation /ofof the necessary legislation and also of any preparatory.or consequential administrative measures which may have to be taken should be put in hand as soon as possible. It is tnercfore requested that a reply to this letter may be sent as soon as possible and in any event not later than the 1st march.
