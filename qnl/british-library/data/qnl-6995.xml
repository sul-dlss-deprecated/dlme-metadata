Letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. T. Wilson, K.C I.E., C.S.I., C.M.G., D.S.O., Officiating- Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. No. \V/8. Busbire, Sir, 25th October JU-0. I have the honour to submit for the consideration of the Government of India the following observations on the military measures necessary to ensure the protection of the oilfields in Arabistan Bakhtiari. 2. It was, if my recollection serves me right, laid down by His Majesty's Government during the war that the protection of these fields was a vital British interest, and the G.O.C.-in-Chief in Mesopotamia was instructed to take any measures necessary to ensure the maintenance of a regular supply of oil from the fields to Abadan. o. In Sir P. Cox's Despatch of the 11th September 11)17, Xo. 5510, and in my memorandum on political and tribal developments in Arabistan, dated 11th March 1918, the military measures which had been taken up to that date were described, together with the occurrences which necessitated the despatch of troops, and th^ opinion was expressed that it would be necessary to maintain troops in Arabistan for some years after the war in order adequately to safeguard British interests. 4. More than three years have now passed since the enclosures to the first mentioned Despatch were written, and our troops have been, or are about to be, with drawn completely from Arab .'Stan. 'The present appears therefore to be a convenient juncture for the submission of a further report on the general question involved. I am dealing separately with the political situation generally, and in the present letter confine myself to the military aspect. 5. During 1918 and .1919 a detachment of Indian troops was maintained at Ahwaz, consisting generally of I battalion or less of infantry, with 2 or 3 squadrons of cavalry; detachments were maintained at Shush, IS miles south of Dizful, and at Tembi, 8 miles south of the oilfields, Tembi at the time being the one and only pumping station, and a vital and vulnerable spot. In 1919 (1 speak from memory) the detachment at Tembi was withdrawn, the Bakhtiari Khans once more becoming responsible for its safety. In April 1920 the detachment at Shush was withdrawn and the garrison at Ahwaz was reduced to one regiment, and latterly to two dismounted squadrons, accommodated in a semi-permanent camp on the right bank of the Karun, opposite Ahwaz, near a village called Aminiyeh. G. It is necessary to explain at this point that this camp was origin illy selected in January 1915 on purely military grounds, connected not with the maintenance of internal order in Arabistan, but to meet the advance of a strong Turkish force from Amarah, whose objective was Ahwaz. The camp, which was located on using ground, was repeatedly attacked both by the Turks and Arabs, and we were compelled more than once to reinforce it. With the defeat of the Turkish forces at Shaibah and the advance of the 12th division from Ahwaz to Amarah, the Turkish menace disappeared, but it was con sidered convenient for various reasons to retain the detachment at Aminiyeh, and when later on it was decided to despatch a force to Shush, the convenience of having a self-contained camp on this bank of the river was apparent. ' 7. It is, however, open to question whether a camp on the right bank at Ahwaz is suitable for a force having as its specific objective the maintenance of internal order in Arabistan and the protection of the oilfields. The camp at Aminiyeh is now being dismantled and we are free to consider the question afresh on its merits. 8. During the past two years additional pumping stations along the pipe-line on the left bank of the Karun of equal power to that of Tembi have been erected at Mulla Sani, 24 miles north of Ahwaz ; at Kut Abdulla, some 8 miles south of Ahwaz ; and at Dero Kwain, some 30 miles north of Mohammerah. 3231 40 1.21Each of these pumping stations, which are very powerful and costly, is surrounded by unclimbable fencing of expanded metal, enclosing an area of about 100 X 600 yards. The residential quarters are within a sell-contained ring fence adjoining the main enclosure and in continuation of it, but separated by a road. Two or three European employees, some 30 or -JO natives, Indians, Persians and Arabs, are employed on each of these stations, which are located close by, or within a few hundred yards of, the Karun. I). In addition to this the Company have two large areas at Abadan covering about two square miles on the left bank of the Sintt-al-Arab, also surrounded, or in process of being surrounded by unclimbable fencing. Here is situated the refinery, one of the largest installations in the world, and a great number of tanks of crude and refined oil. 10. At Ahwaz, immediately above the rapids on the left bank, the Company have a large workshop and stores depot containing tools, drilling material, &amp;c., and much valuable machinery. 11. At Darra Khasina, on the left bank of the (largar branch of the Karun, there has been established a powerful pumping station on which the oillields depend for the supply of water, from 50,000 gallons upwards per diem being required. There is also a large dump of plant, c^c. 12. The oilfields themselves are scattered over an area of many square miles and .are constantly being extended. 13. The transportation services of the Company are maintained us follows :— From Abadan to Ahwaz transportation is almost exclusively by river steamer. From Ahwaz to Darra Khasina likewise, material being transported from below to above the rapids by a light line. There is, however, a good motor road along the left bank of the Karun, from Alanikh just above Alohammerah to Ahwaz, from Basrah to Ahwaz in a direct line, from Ahwaz to Dizful, from Dizful to Shuslitar and from Ahwaz keeping on the left bank of the (Jargar to Darra Khasina and then to the oilfields. An alternative and more direct route for light traffic runs from Ahwaz across the Karun by a bridge with a lifting span at Band-i-Qir and then to Darra Khasina, for the most part along the main Shushtar road. 14. Some 100 Europeans, some 400 Indians, and some 7,000 Persians are employed in the oilfields. At Darra Khasina the number of employees is about the same as that at other pumping stations. At Ahwaz the Company have some 20 Europeans, &lt;')0 Indians and -00 Persians or Arabs. At Abadan some 70 Europeans, about l,00o Indians and some 3,000 or 4,000 Persians or Arabs are employed, the numbers varying great!}' from time to time. .15. It will be seen that the undertaking described above is probably unique in the East in magnitude and in the extent of its operations, which have by no means reached their full development. The output has been doubled during the past three years, and there is no reason to think that for some years to come the output will not increase at the same rate. Of some oO borings which have been made and which have proved to be productive, only 10 are now used at present; the production of these .10 is as much as the existing pipe-lines can deal with, and it is probable that no single oilfield in the world owned by one company is equally productive. 16. The work on the oillields in the Bakhtiari has at no time during the last 1'2 years been interrupted even for a day by local disturbances, and in Arabistan only once for about six weeks, on the occasion of the Turkish incursion in 1915 referred to above. The Persian Government are entitled to 10 per cent, of the net profits of the Company, and a proposal is now under consideration to revise this on a basis of Rs. 2 per ton on all oil passed through the Company's pipe-lines. The Bakhtiari Khans are entitled to 3 per cent, of the net profits in respect of oil found in their territories. The Shaikh of Mohammerah derives considerable revenue, both in tiie form ol ground rents and indirectly in other ways, from the presence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, though not so large as he would wish, or as his Bakhtiari neighbours enjoy.The Ruling Chiefs and Governments concerned are therefore directly interested in the maintenance of the Company's operations at full efficiency. 17. Amongst the common people the Company enjoys a good reputation, particularly amongst the Bakhtiari, where they are regarded as the friend of the people and benefactors of the tribe?. They are also looked upon favourably, to the best of my belief, by the Arab population of Mohammerah and Abadan. In Arabistan itself they are in less close touch with the Arab population than might be desired, not through any fault of their own, but because the Arab has an invincible distaste for steady and laborious though remunerative work such as that offered by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, and his place has been taken by Persians imported from the north. IS. The local position is therefore satisfactory, and there is no present reason to anticipate that it will become less so; on the other hand, we know by bitter experience that where foreigners and foreign interests are concerned, public opinion amongst a savage people is apt to change suddenly and the people at large are liable to act in a manner wholly contrary to their own interests and to what may reasonably be believed to be their private and personal feelings when their religious prejudices -and fears are invoked by stupiil or malicious priests or chiefs. This is much less the case amongst the Hakhtiari than anywhere else, and 1 do not consider that it is necessary for the present to make plans for the military protection of the Hakhtiari oilfield ; but in Arabistan the case is different. The population are bigoted Shiah Arabs, who in 1915, notwithstanding the influence possessed over them by the Shaikh of Mohammerah, cheerfully took up arms when the •cry of Jehad was raised by the Turks, and seceded on all sides from the Shaikh of Mohammerah, leaving him with only one or two powerful tribes on whom he could rely, and these tribes were not sufficiently well armed to be in a position to do much against the rebellious elements,'nor was the Shaikh of Mohammerah in a position to supply the deficiency. The arrival of a small British force at Ahwaz in 1915 successfully stabilised the .situation, and the Shaikh had little difficulty in bringing his rebellious tribesmen to heel, and in point of fact his position is more satisfactory now and his control is more -complete than at any time for the past 10 years. Should, however, further unfavourable developments occur in Arabistan, it is not improbable that we should witness a recurrence of the troubles that occurred in 1915. 19. 1 venture to suggest that, having regard to the importance of the general question of the defence oi the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's installations, the ■whole question as to how this can best be done from a military point of view should be specifically reviewed, a military officer being specially sent to Arabistan to investigate the question. In the hope that this may be done, 1 beg to put forward the following proposals :— (1) Blockhouses to be erected by the Company, at their own expense, round all installations which are already fenced in, at suitable intervals, and round Abadan. If this was done 1 am of the opinion that one company could adequately protect the vulnerable and delicate machinery at these stations 1 and the lives of the Europeans -against all probable attacks. Abadan would probably require a regiment to do this effectively, but Abadan would be the last place to be affected, and reinforcements would by that time have arrived. (2) Accommodation for troops to be built by the Company at suitable places in each pumping station ; such accommodation could be utilised in time of peace by the Company's local workmen and in time of disturbance by the garrison, it' sent. (3) A brigade of infantry and a cavalry regiment may be regarded, with a battery of mountain artillery, as an adequate force to be despatched to Arabistan in the event of trouble. (4) A permanent garrison of one battalion of Indian infantry to be maintained in the future at Ahwaz on the left bank in lines surrounded by unclimbable fencing on a site to be selected near the Karun. 2U. It is for consideration whether the cost of the construction of these lines and the cost of maintaining the troops should not be debited to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 1 cannot doubt that it would be in their interests to accept such a debit, but if they are asked to pay they would naturally expect to be consulted as to the 1 TembifDiin-a Klmsiua, Mulla Sani. Kut Abdullah, Dere Kwaiu.location of troops and as to their employment in the event of emergency arising. There- would seem to be no objection to this, as nobody is in a better position than they are to know what developments are likely to occur, and what the most vulnerable- points are. 21. The foregoing proposals have not been discussed with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company specilically. nor with the Shaikh of Mohainmerah, but it is within my knowledge that the Shaikh of Mohannnerah would welcome the maintenance ol' a permanent garrison at Ahwaz, in order to help him to share the burden ol responsibility which he at present bears for the safety of the above installations, and the views of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company can doubtless be obtained in London. 2'J. The Persian Government have for some years past raised no objection to- the presence of our troops in Arabistan, and it seems unlikely that they will do so in the above connection, as their financial interests are so closely bound up with those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and they have doubtless not forgotten that the disturbances in lOlf) in Arabistan involved them in a claim for a very large sum from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for compensation under the terms of the concession. Should the Anglo-Persian Oil Company pay for the force proposed in para. 10 (4), and for the necessary buildings, the position of the force would be analogous to that of the detachment sent to the oilfields with the same object in December 1007, with the cognizance and consent of the Persian Government. 2o. The foregoing proposals have been discussed with Lieut.-Col. Trevor, Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, who desires me to say that they have his general concurrence so far as he is i\t present able to form an opinion. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. T. Wilson, Lient.-Col., I.A.
