Dated January, ^§*4&amp;. Will you please refer to the correspondence resting with Hickinbotham 1 s telegram No.30 of the 10th January, 1945, regarding the Manamah Municipality Bye-laws? ^ pj 2. I am not certain that the Municipal Regulations forwarded under this Agency Printed Letter No.C/947 of 20th June, 1944, are compiled in the best form and should be grateful if a copy of some good Municipal Regulations could be obtained from the Government of India to serve as a model for the redrafting of ours here. 3. One fresh problem that is about to face the Bahrain Government is that of Town Pla/ming and, to ray way of thinking, some system of control of building is essential now that the day is not far off when building materials will be available once more. 4. An example which emphasises the point is the proposal regarding a piece of land owned by the R.A.F. in Ghudhaibiya betv/een the British Overseas Airways Corporation Transit Camp and the Assistant Political Agent's house concei^ng which the R.A.F. are, I understand unofficially, proposing (or may, indeed, have already done so) to sub let to the A.I.O.C. for the construction of Indian Staff Quarters. 5. As you know, Ghudhaibiya is predominantly the residential quarter of the A1 Khalifa family and, being comparatively speaking unbuilt over, could with some thought be preserved from the evils of unplanned construction. 6. I propose sounding His Highness in the near future on tne question of the introduction of a Town Planning Scheme and, with the example I have just quoted before him, I feel certain he will s. 6. MFP—501 S&amp;P—(M-820)—23-7-36—300,000. Pwelcome the proposal. At the same time I should like advice as to the best method to incorporate rules regarding Town Planning under the present regulations in force. My idea was that they could best be included with the Bye-laws of the Municipalities, and if you agree I propose to ask the Bahrain Government (presuming that His Highness agrees to the suggestion) to draw up the rules which I would submit to you for approval in accordance with King's Regulation No,2 of 1936.

Gii'D—S3—60 EAD— 15-4-46—50.Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.5 of 1947.. Hamad Saleh Humaidhi, Director of the Munici pality, submitted his resignation on the 6th ?farch, but His Highness persuaded him to withdraw it. His salary has been doubled and now stands at Rs.1,200/- per month. He has also been provided with a car and a driver at Government expense.(s Extract from ?'nwait Intelligence Summary No.5 of 1947. It has been decided by the Municipality to drive a road GO’ wide through the town from the 'square” to the sea-front. The cost of compensation to property owners alone will amount to several hundred of thousands of rupees. NS.Re. my conversation with you this morning about the R.A.F's intention to sublet the land adjoining the A.P.A's house to the A.I.O.C. for building of Indian staff quarters. I think if we invoked H.H’s sympathy - whicham sure would be forthcoming - we light be able to prevent this project and suggest that the time has come for the Bahrain Government to pass an 'Alan' that no new buildings will be erected in Manamah, Ghudhiaibiya etc. without the approval of a Town Planning Committee after inspection of the plans. The Town Planning Committee for hanamah ight consist of the Adviser, P.A., Presidents of the Municipality and Land Department and a selected number of reputable merchants with the * State F,ngineer3P.W.D. Engineer as technical advisers. To begin with, unti3 a proper P.'d.D. Engineer is employed approval of the Qomnittee would be designed more to regulate building than to ensure good construction work - but it would provide a basis for planning rather than the present ad hoc construction of unseemly edifices on unsuitable sites. Ghudhaibiya and the environments of H.H's palace should surely be preserved from becoming built over by all and sundry. If you think it is any use trying to introduce an elementary form of town planning, I will transfer this noting to the appropriate fil-e. I feel v/e coujd do it now.
