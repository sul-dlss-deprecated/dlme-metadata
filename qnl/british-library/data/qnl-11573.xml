I am perfwadcd, that th^s is the famed Kingdom of Cataye ; for the Catayans are a fort of ‘Tartars, and I know no other Tartars between this Country and China. Caragan lieth from them to the North-Weft 5 Vrgenfhe due North ; China to the Eaft 5 the Tartars of Bal}^ to the South 5 and the Perfians South and by Weft ; and the Cafoan Sea duly Weft. They are almoft continually in Wars with the Perfians. The next Country I am to defcribs is Perfia, in which Land I was never, excepting once, in that part thereof which borders upon the Comub^sy but I have converged with ieveral Perfian Merchants at Ajhacan, who came by Shipping from Gilan, which # when the Wind is very fair and good, they fail in two or three days and Nights. They wear Turbants like the Turks, and ib do the Boucbars. Therefore not having feen much of Perjia, nor having fufficiently informed my felf concerting it, I fhall pafs through it unto the Comuk^s Land, of which I have obtained more perfeft know ledge both by War and Traffick. This Country is bounded on the South by Perfia, on the Eaft by the Cafiian Sea ; Weftward by Circaffia ; and on the North by the River of Tumine 5 on which {lands a Town of the lame Name, from which unto Chahamate, the moft Northerly Habitation of Perfia, is 600 miles A great part of this Country, efpecially Weftward, is very mountainous I could never learn where it doth exa£tly Terminate. I have been in four of their Towns: The firft is Tarkge, Where GiCJar, whom they own for their Prince,doth ordinarily refide. The fecond is De-rheme, in the Mountains. The third 'Derevena, in the fame mountainous Tra6t. The fourth Kojfa, upon a River of the fame Name, not far from the place where it empties it felf into the Cafiian Sea. Thefe Comukes are proper Men and very couragious; and that which makes them more daring and adventurous than moft Tartars, is the goodnefs of their Horfes, and the advantage of their Arms, both oftenfive and defenftve ; for they feldome engage in Wars without Helmets, jacks of Steel, Shirts of Mail, and Targets, which excepting thofe times wherein they fight, hang behind their backs, being very light, and not very large, and therefore not cumberfome. They have, as other Tartars, both Bows and Cymetars, and withal never go without Lances, which they ufe with great flrength and dexterity. In their Apparel they differ little from the Circafiians but as for Religion, they are generally Mahmetans^ and their Language is in fubftance the fame with other Tartars, their vicinity unto the Perfians, Mujcovites and Sbeercajfes, having fomewhat difguifed it. The Countrey they inhabit abounds with Wood 5 part of it is hilly, with Imall pleafant Valleys between the Hillocks; and in feme places, efpecially towards Perfia, and thence into the Land, it hath many great and almoft: inacceffible Mountains, by reafon of their heighth and ftcepnefs. This Land Was reduced under the Government of the Rujfes many years ago, after the en~ ■fuing manner : Evan Vaffilymch being Czar or Emperour of Kuffia, after he had taken Gaffan and Jflracan, fent part of his Army into Circaffia, where they took in Tumeine. Another Body entred the Comukes Country, and poffefTed themfelves of Derevena, Derheine, Tarhyee and Koffa. The Ruffe Emperour conftituted a Voyvod, whom he ordered to reflde in Tarhee, and left with him loeooMen; he ordered alfo at the fame time another confiderable Brigade to flay at Coifa, where he left a great number of Boats and other Veffels, who had brought fupplies of Men and Provift- ons from, Mo/co,.and other Parts of his Dominions. And having, as he appre hended, feenred his new Conquefts, he returned unto Mo fee : Immediately after his retreat, the Cowukes gather’d their whole Force, and fee down before the Town of Tarkee, which after a vigorous refiftance they took, and in it with the Voyvod, feverai Officers of divers Nations, whom with the common Souldiers they fold unto the Cir caffians, Tartars, and other neighb’ring Nations, fothat few were ever afterwards re cover’d. From Tarkge they marched unto Koifa, which by the inftru£lion of Cap tives they did pretty regularly befiegeand aflault, and after feme repulfes took it by (form, killing all the Ruffes, excepting.fuch as efcaped in the Ships and Boats which lay before the Town. The Ruffe Emperour being fpeedily informed of thefe Succef- fes, immediately railed a great Army, with which he ordered all the Cojfacks between the Don and Volga, unto the River of Tumeine, to joyn his Forces, and aflift them, in order unto the recovery of what he had loft, and utter extirpation of the Comukes - Who hearing how highly the Czar was exafperated, and how great a Force was ready to invade them, they began to be folicitous about the Event; and having confulted • ' '**•* • to-Ofiverfej ][ km yf*, |Me 'd unto toftbis he it fccond mtlic tMen i their without it very Bows i great &gt;/;h hce ' 4 f ) ood; fotne it and land been- , at the 8 ?

Whereupon they fenc Ambaiiadors unro Tememe^ where the Rv(fe Army was encamp* cd 5 and after a Treaty with the Czar's Plenipotentaries, they agreed upon thefe Ar ticles, That the Comvkgs ftiould rchore the Towns they had taken, and aid the Empe- rour with fuch a number of Souldiers, as he fhould require, againlt any Enemy what* foever,whereunto their Heads being Sworn,they have inviolably obferved the Agree ment unto this day. Buck’s time we take our leave of Gildar, Prince of ierfa and his Conwkes, and proceed into Sbercajfen Land, part of which as I hinted before, lyes upon the Black Sea, and extends it ielf Unto the Caflian. This fide of CircaJJia which borders upon the Cafpim Sea, is a very plentiful Coun trey ; and as for Fifh, it is fo wonderfully plentiful, that in Tumtim you may ordina rily purchafe a good Sturgeon for two pence, and fometimes for a penny; a mod pro digious quantity of Filh being taken in the Xiver of the Weefira, and about the Eland ot Cbekiene, which is off at Sea not far kom^urmim. On the main Land, over againft this Fifhery, 4 miles above the River of 2er%, there is a great Well, made by a Spring, which fails from a Rock, on the fide of a great Hill* and immediately fills this Little Lake, which whether it is Natural or Artificial,! know not. The Water of this Lake is fo fcalding hot,that the Fifhers flinging in their Sturgeon or other Fifh,it is in a fhort time boyled, as if over a fire, the heat being fo intenfe, that no Man can detain his hand in it for a moment; from which ftrange Quality it derives its Name* being called by the G&amp;racba Colloda i or the Scalding Well. I fhall conclude my Difcourfe with a fhort Account of the Little Nagoy, or of that part thereof which confines upon the Caftian ; for all that ipace between tumeine and Allman^ is by many alefibed unto the Nagoy Tartars. I did before declare, That the Little Nagoy is for the mod part a wide wafle Defart, the word of which is all that fracf which lyeth between Tumeine and Ajlracan. Thefe Tartars have no Town but only Affhowa, which is not properly theirs, though lying in their Countrey, being poflcfled by the Turks. There is a fort of people in this Countrey, whom the Tartars call Sigakes 5 1 could never learn what their language is, or from what Placeor Nation they proceed; nor could I underdand after what manner they live, whether they have any Religion, or Civil Government. Their chief Subfiflance is what they gain from the Tartars ; for they gather fomrimes 2 or 3000, and rob the fmaller Hords of the Tartars, and thofe which are mod remote from help. But fometimes the Tartars difeovering the place of their Retreat or Rendevous, furround them with their Carts, and then fall in, cut themiall od^ never giving Quarter unto any ; no Crime being fo feverly punifhed amongd the Tartars, as Thievery ; which makes me apprehend, that thefe Sigafyszre fome of their own people, who formerly deferred them upon fome extraordinary occafion : But whatfoever is the realon, they do mod irreconcileably hate each the other. The mod noted Places on that fide the Little Nagoy, which regards the Sea* and lye all along the Coad from Tumeine to Adracan, are Sbeerlona Teare .( where I Was fird taken Prifoner by the Tartars ) Peremetka, Arfl Bajh, Moyackye, Bealla Ojbera Bajhmackakg, Kaboylly Macbakpfskp , Cbojhway , and fb over the Volga unto Ajirachan. And co conclude all, /{hall here enumerate all the Places on the Coad near Aflra- which have Names that are confiderable for Havens, Trade, Fifhing, or any other remarkable Circurqdance. Soteeza Bockyrra, Vcujlowa Coffa, Beerulska Coffa, Ewan~ Ibosky Cojfa, Seammz Bogarojfe, TuJJbcleojf Lapateene, Cbaska Cojfa, Crofiia Bogore, Cock* mfktf Coffa, 0 war ska Coffa, Comajhaska Coffa, Colloberinska Coffa, Cocktaborp, Buffanska Lapaten, Kara Buff an ; which lad place is not far from Sheene Mare, which I have formerly mentioned. . I c ^nnot fo exa&amp;ly tell the Circumference of the Cajpian, as of the Black Sea, ha-' vmgbeen only on the North and Wed fide; but howfoever I fhall from what I have foenand learnt from experienced perfons, be enabled to approach very near unto the Truth. The Didance between Aflracan and the Jakff, is 500 miles; from thence unto the Qnnnes of Bochara 500 miles: From Jaxartees to Perfia, and thence unto Gilian ^ac cording unco my Information, 1100 miles.

After 1 \ckInland) before 1 had been long in England^ an opportunity prefenting it fell, I engaged in the Service of the King of Sweden, who had then Wars with the Mufcovites 5 having given fome Confiderable proofs or my Courage, 1 was gradually raifeo unto a Confiderable Command 5 but being engaged too far in a Body 01 the Enemies,! was unhappily taken- Prifoner by^he 2^/, and carried Priioner unto TUfcow, then in their poileffion, ha ving at the fame time Arrears due unto me from the hwede above 5000 Dollars. The Swedes taking no care for my Enlargement, being willing, I iuppofe, to lave io great a Sum of Money,as at my Return 1 fhould have challenged : after T hree years clofe Imprifonment, I wasprofered Liberty by the Mufcmte,uyon condition I would faith- ftillv ferve himagainit all his Enemies * whereunto aflenting, I was fent unto Mofcow, and' there before the Chancellor iworn a 'tolmac^nd. preferred unio a Command lit tle inferiour unto what 1 enjoyed before. And the Foies advancing towaras htofcov? with a great Army, fearing left! fhould go oyer unto them, I was lent unto A{\man where! remained to years,being continually Employed againft the Tartars anc Circaf- fans. By Which means 1 came to know Fettigor, Sneefnagor, Sbadgore, Cabardye and the Great and Little Nagoy, the Comuhes, the dartars of CaJJen, the Kainmkys,CaJJ'ach\, Horda, Caragans, Vngenfh, and Vs beg tartars. During which ..Wars, I conned with great difficulties and hardfhip* in making long Jourmes, faring hardly : Nor was it a (mail labour to make floates in order unto our pafiing over the great Rivers / have mentioned,to fay nothing of the Danger. Befides, we run great hazards in our Jour neying over thofewafte wide howling Defans, which on every fide furrounded us; fre quently Wanting provifions, and iomtimes Guides; fo that had we failed never io little in our Conjectures, we had all perifhed. After Ten years bard Service, in my Return from Conveying Sbollobofe Knez into Shercaffen Land, I was taken 1 Lj one f by the tartars of the Little Nagy, and by them carried unto Ajfowa upon the Mouth of the tana or Von. There 1 was fould unto a Frecopenfan tartar, who carried me along with him towards Crm : But upon the (hallow Waters! very bappdy made my Efcape. I had little Knowledgeof the Country, but having formerly underftood by our Cojfacks at /Iftracan, that great Bodies of the fame name mortal Enemiesuntethe tartars, dwelt upon the Nepper not far beyond Crm$ by the help of the Sun and dtars, I journeyed due Weft many days without any diiaftrous Adventure,until Bound them; who gave me a very kind reception: In this efcape Z travelled slmoft the w hole Leiart of Ingile and Vngule. Vorofensko who then Commanded all th e Cojjacks upon the the JSlep- per, immediately made me a Poskofnekg, from which time for the ip^ceof a.rnoi two years i did accompany them in divers expeditions, in which we vifited moft of tnoie Countries which lye upon the Black Sea, to the no fmall vexation and lofs_ol the in habitants. We kept a Correfpondence with the Cojfacks upon the Von, and frequently afifted each other. And being all Foot, and the Country cxadly level, we travc ea furrounded with Wagons ( which they call a Tabor ) tor fear of the 7 * rtar j ., often fet upon us, but were as often repulfed, we being well accommodated Fire-Arms and fmall Field-piecs, which the tartars do exceedingly fear and willnot ordinarily attempt clofely ,unkis they hav c greatly the Odds in Number. But at ie g ^* v nirfwtaymiiiiiiiittiiiiifinrifliirniMiiii 1 &gt;iriiiifiiiin n 1 niiHi 1111111 upnthe Buxine and Caipian it was my ill Fortune between the Nepper and the Dm to be again taken by the Tartars and by them carried into Cum, where l lived long in great mifery, and was at length lould unto a Tiwariot Spahi living in Anadouk^ ( Anatolia or A fid minor ) with whom I lived 5 years, but in more eafie iervitude than among the Tartars. And to make mV fervice lels irktbme,my Maher beftowed on me a Wadachidn Woman,whom I received for my Wife, chough without the uiuall Solemnities of Marriage, which are pradifed among Chriitians: Underhanding at length that a Lord Ambatfador was rehdent at Conjianiinople in behalf of the King of Great Bfittian, and to manage the Affairs of the Engli(h Nation in Turtys 1 prevailed with my Matter, whole Favour I had gained to grant me my freedom, together with my W ives, if I fhould procure an hundred Dol lars. Whereupon he dilmifled me in the company of a TW^his Friend, who upon my humble ftipplicacion unto your Lordlhip receiving the formetioned Sum, did in the behalf of his Fr lend before the Cady make me free, and leave the Woman alfo at my Difpolal. At the fame time I very happily met with fome VaVaebianGcmlemcn who were lent on a MelTage from their Vapvod unto the Grand Seignor^ They gladly received my Woman, and took her along with them, promifing Upon their Return into their own Country, to Reftore her unto her Parents. F Now chat I may fully latisfie your Lordlhip,that /had really vifited all thofe Coun tries which I have mentioned^ 1 befeech your Lordlhip let your Interpreter try me in thofe Languages wherein he is skilled; and as for others wherewith he is not ac quainted,! am ready to con verfe With any of thofe Nations whom I pretend to know. For although I have never converfed much with Books, yet my great Travel ac companied with a pretty good Memory, will fufficiently Qualifie me to pafs through the Countries I lhall hereafter mention.

HE defire of feeing the World having made me Travel into Pale- ftina and Egypt, would not let me flop there 5 it put me upon a refolution to fee the Red Sea from one end to the other. I went from Grand Cairo, after I had ftaid there above a year i and in two and thirty hours, going the Caravan-\&gt;ace , I arrived at ^ Suez, where I Embarked in a Gaily, which in feventeen days carry’d me, always in fight of Land, to the Port of Gidda, which is half a days Tourney from Mecca. There I was conftrained ( contrary to my hopes, and the promife which the Beig of the Red Sea had made me ) to go afhore on that pretended Holy Land of Mahomet, where a Ghriftian, that is not a Slave, dares not fet his foot* I ftaid there four and thirty days i and then I Embarked m a (mall Velfel, which in fifteen days carried me along the Coaft of Arabia the Happy to Moka, near the Streight of Babel-mandel. Irefolvedto pafs thence to thelfleof Mafowa and Arkki, to get as far as Gouder, the Capital Town of theCountrey of Akbech, or the Kingdom of JEthiopia j but I received certain information, that, fince the Portugmfes had been killed there by the intrigue of the Queen-Mother, or expelled, together with the Jeluit Patriarch, whom they had brought thither from Goa, the Roman Cathohcks were not fafe there •, a poor Capuchin having loft his head at Suakn, for having attempted to en ter into that Kingdom : That indeed, by going under the name of a Greek, or an Ar menian, I did not run fo great hazard, and that even the King himfelr, when he ihoujd know, that I could do him fervice, would give me Land to Till by Slaves, which I tnignt buy if I had money j but that undoubtedly they would forthwith oblige me to ^ rr y&gt; as they had lately done a certain Frier, who had palfed there under the name of a Greek Phyfitian, and that they would never fuft'er me to come away again. Thefe conliderations, among others, induced me to change my refolution. wen aboard of an Indian Veffeh I paffed thofe Streights, and in two and twenty days I ar rived at Suratte in Indoftan, the Empire of the Great Mogol,jn the Year 1055. i found, that he who then Reigned there, was call’d CW-jfete, thatis to fay, Kingo the World*, who, according to the Hiftory of that Countrey, was Son otjehan-Gnyre, which fignifieth Conqueror of the World, Grandchild of Ekbar, w ic is ^ ^ that thus afcending by Hotimayons, or the Fortunate, Father of Ek^-&gt; an is 0 er Predeceffors, he was the ienth of thofe that were defcended from that Jimur-Lengue, which fignifieth the ^me Prince, commonly and corruptly call’d T«r/jw, forenowne tor his Conquefts *, who married his near Kinfwoman, the only Daughter or the rinc ^^ X' -2 The Hiflory of the Late Revolution the Nations of Great Tartary^ call’d Mogols, who have left and communicated their Name to the Strangers, that now govern 'Indoftan, the Countrey of the Indians, though thofe that are employ’d in publick Charges and Offices, and even thofe that are lifted in the Militia, be not all of the Pvace of the Mogols, but Strangers, and Nations gather’d out of all Countries, moft of them Perfians, fome Arabians, and fome For, to be dteem’d a Mogol, ’tis enough to be a Stranger white of Face, and a Mahumetan i in diitindion as well to the Indians, who are brown, and Pagans, as to the Cbrijlians of Europe, who are call’d Franguis. I found alfo at my arrival, that this King of the World, Chah-Jehan, of above fevem ty years of Age, had four Sons and two Daughters i that, fome years fince, he had made thefe four Sons Vice-Kings or Governors of four of his molt confiderable Provinces or Kingdoms i that it was almoft a year that he was fallen into a great ficknefs, whence it was believed he would never recover: Which had occafioned a great divifion among thefe four Brothers ( all laying claim to the Empire ) and had kindled among them a War which'lalted about live years, and whichldefignhereto defcribe, having been prefent at fome of the moft conlidcrable Actions, and entertained for the fpace of eight years at that Court, where Fortune and the fmall ftock of Money ( left me after divers Encounters with Robbers, and the Expences of a Voyage of fix and forty days from ratte to Agra and Dehli, the Capital Towns of that Empire ) obliged me to take a Sala ry from the Grand Mogol in the quality of a Phyfitian, and a little after from Danecb- mend-Kan, the moft knowing Man of Afia, who had been Bal^hh, or Great Mafter of the Horfe, and was one of the moft powerful and the moft confiderable Omrahs or Lords.of that Court. The Eldeji of thefe four Sons of Chah-Jehan was call’d Vara, that is Varius, The Second was call’d Sultan-Sujah, that is, the Valiant Prince. The name of the Third was Aurenge-Zebe, which figniftes the Ornament of the Throne. That of the Forf was Morad-Bakche, as if you fhould fay. Defire accomplifhed. Of the two Daughters, the eldeft was call’d Begum-Saheb, that is, the Miftrefs Princefsi and the youngeft Rau- chenara-Begnm, which is as much as Bright Princefs, or the Splendor of Princeffes. ’Tis theGuftom of theCountrey, to give fuchNames to their Princes and Princefles. Thus the Wife of Chah-Jehan, fo renown’d for her Beauty, and for having aTomb, which much more deferved to be reckon’d among the Wonders of the World,than thofe unlhapen Maffes, and thofe heaps of Stones in Egypt, was called Tage-MehaUe, that is to fay, the Crown of the Seraglio &gt; and the Wife of Jehan-Guyre, who hath fblong govern’d the State, whilft her Husband minded nothing but Drinking and Divertife- ments, was firft called Nour-Mehalle, and afterwards, Nour-Jehan-Begum, the Light of the Seraglio, the Light of the World. The reafon, why they give fuch kind of Names to the Great Ones, and not Names from their Land or Dominion (as is ufual in Europe) is, becaufe all the Land being the Kings, there are no Marquifates, Earldoms and Dut ches, of which the Grandees might bear their Names i all confifts in Penfions either of Land or ready Money, which the King giveth, increafeth, retrencheth, and takes away, as feems good unto him: And ’tis even for this reafon, that the Omrahs have alfo no other but fuch Names j one ( for example ) being called Raz-Audaze-Kan , i. e. a Thunderer j another, Safe Chetyn-Kan, a Breaker of Ranks i a third, Bare-Audaze- Kan, a Man of Lightening i others, Vianet-Kan, or Vanechmend-Kan, or Fazel-Kan, i. e. the Faithful Lord, the Intelligent, the Perfedf, and the like. Vara, the Eldeft Son, wanted not good Qualities. He was Gallant in Converfation, Witty in Repartees, exceeding Civil and Liberal, but entertained too good an Opinion of his perfon, efteeming himfelf alone capable of all, and thinking it fcarce poffibie that any Body was able to give him counfel j infbmuch, that he would give reproachful Names to thofe who pretended to advife him in any thing i whereby it came to pafs, that even thofe, who were moft affe&amp;ionate to him, were (hie to difcover to him the moft fecret Intrigues of his Brothers. Befides, he was apt to be tranfported withpaf- lion, to menace, to injure, to affront, even the gveateft Omrahs or Lords i but allpaifed twer liKe a flafli of light. Though he was a Mahumetan, andpublickly exprefted in the ordinary Exercifes of Religion to be fo, yet, in private, he was Heathen with the Hea then, and Chriftian with the Chriftians. He had conftantly about him of thofe Hea then Docftors, to whom he gave very confiderable Penfions, and who ( as was faid) had inftilled into him Opinions contrary to the Religion of the Land i of which 1 may touch fomething hereafter, when I (hall come to fpeak of the Religion of the Indians■. i imm. —— —UH»r*»-d- — -- , ■ ^ — of the Empire of the M O G O L, oi Gentiles. He alio hearkened of late very willingly to the Reverend Father Bukee &amp; Jefuit, and began very well to relilh what he fuggefted. Yet there are fome who fay* that at the bottom he was void of all Rxligion, and that whatever he pretended in it, was only for curiofity, or, as others fay, out of policy, to make himfelf beloved by the Chriftians, who are pretty numerous in his Artillery i but above all, to gain the Affedii- on of the Rajas^ or Soveraign Gentiles, that were Tributary to the Empire, and to make them of his party upon occafion. Mean time, this hath not much furthered his Affairs, on the contrary, it will appear in the fequel of this Hiftory, that the pretence ufed by Aureng-Zebe , his third Brother, to cut off his head, was, that he was turned Kafer, that is to fay, an Infidel, of no Religion, an Idolater. Sultan Sujah, the fecond Brother, was much of the humor of Vara, but he was more clofe and more fetled, and had better condudf and dexterity. He was fit to ma nage an Intrigue well, and he made, under-hand, Friends, by the force of Prefents, which he heaped upon the great Omrahs, and principally upon the moh powerful Rajas, as Jeffornfeigne, and fome others ? bur he did fomewhat too much indulge his pleafures, inentertaining an extraordinary number of Women, among whom wheft he was , he fpent whole days and nights in drinking, finging, and dancing. He made them Pre fents of very rich Apparel i and heencreafed or leffened their Peniions according as the fancy took him: By which kind of life his Affairs did languifh, and the Affections of ma ny of his People cooled. He caff himfelf into the Religion of the Berfians, although Chah-Jeban^ his Father, and all his Brothers, were of the Turkifh. Tis known that Mabumetanifm is divided into feveral Sects, which made that famous Checksady. Au thor of the Gouliftan, fay in Verfe, which is to this effect inProfe, lam aDervicb Drinker, I feem to be without Religion, and I am known of fixty two Sefts. But of all thofe Sects there are two principal ones, whofe Partifans are mortal Enemies to one ano ther. The one is that of the furhs-, whom the call that is, Sectators of Ofman\ they believing that tis he that was the true and lawful Succeflor of Maho met, the Great Caliph or Soveraign Prieft, to whom alone it did appertain to interpret the Alcoran, aud to decide the Controverfies to be met with in the Law. The other is that of the Perjians, whom the 7 »rJy , call Chios, Rafezys, Aly-Merdans, that is, Se6fa- ries, Hereticks, Partifans of Aly, becaufe they believe, contrary to the belief of the Eurks, that this Succeflion and Pontifical Authority, which I juft now intimated, was due only to Aly theSon-in law of Mahomet. It was by reafon of State that Sultan Su- jab had embraced this latter Sedf, confidering that all the Perjians being C^i^, and moft of them, or their Children, having the greateft power at the Court of Mogol, and hold ing the moft important Places of the Empire, he had moft reafon to hope, that, when occalion ferved, they would all take his part. Aureng-Zebe , the third Brother, had not that Gallantry, nor furprizing Prefence of Dara, he appeared more ferious and melancholy, and was indeed much more judicious, underftandingthe World very well,and knowing whom tochufe for hisferviceand pur- pole, and where to'beftow his favour and bounty moft for his intereft. He was refer- ved, crafty, and exceedingly verfed in diffembling, infomuch that for a long while he made profeilion to be Fakire, that is, Poor, Dervich, or Devout, renouncing the World, and feigning not to pretend at all to the Crown, but to defire to pafs his life in Prayer, and other Devotions. In the mean time he failed not to make a Party at Court, efpe- cially when he was made Vice-King of Decani but he did it with fo much dexterity, art, and fecrefie, that it could hardly be perceived. He alfo had the skill to maintain himfelf in the aftedfion of Chab-Jchan his Father, who although he much loved Vara, could yet not forbear to Chew that he efteemed Aureng-Zebe , and judged him capable to Feign i which caufed jealoufic enough in Vara, who began to find it, infomuch that he could not hold from faying fometimes to his Friends in private, Of all my Brothers I apprehend only this Nemazi, that is, this Bigot, this great Praying-man. Morad-Bakche, the youngeft of all, was the leaft dextrous, and the leaft judicious. He cared for nothing but mirth and paftime, to drink, hunt, andfhoot. Yet he had fome good qualities, for he was very civil and liberal» he gloried in it, that he kept no- thing fecret ^ he defpifed Cabals \ and he braggM openly, that he trufted only in his Ann and Sword : In fhort, he was very Brave, and if th:s Bravery had been accompanied lv ah fome condudf, he would have carried the Bell from all his Brothers,and been King fct Indofan, as will appear in what is to follow. Concerning the t wo Daughters, the Eldeft, Begum-Saheb, was very beautiful, and a B 2 greatThe Hi (lory of the Late Revolution great Wit, paflionatdy beloved of her Father. It was even rumoured, that he loved her to that degree as is hardly to be imagined, and that he alledged for his excufe, that, according to the determination of his Mullahs, or Doctors of his Law, it was permitted a Man to eat of the fruit of the Tree he had planted. He had fo great a confidence in her, that he had given her charge to watch over his fafety, and to have an eye to all what came to hfs Tabic: And foe knew perfe&amp;ly to manage his humor, and even in the mod weighty Affairs to bend him as foe pleafed. She was exceedingly enriched by great Penfions, and by coftly Prefents, which foe received from all Parts,for fudi Nego tiations as foe employed her felf in about her Father: And foe made alfo great Expences, being of a very liberal and generous difpofiUQn. She duck entirely to Vara, her elded Brother, efpoufed cordially his part, and declared openly for him s which contributed not a little to make the Affairs of Vara profper, and to keep him in the affe&amp;ion of his Father j for foe fupported him in all things, and advertifed him of all occurrences: Yet that was not fo much, becaufe he was the elded Son, and foe the elded Daughter ( as the People believed ) as becaufe he had promifed her, that as foon as he foould come to the Crown, he would marry hers which is altogether extraordinary,and aimed never pr add fed in Indvjian. I (hall not fcruple to relate herefome of the Amours of this Princefs, although fout up in a Seraglio, and well kept, like other Women. Neither foall I apprehend , that I may be thought to prepare matter for a Pvomancer s for they are not Amours like ours, followed by Gallant and Gwzfoz/Adventures, but attended with Events dreadful and Tragical. Now ’tis reported, that this Princefs found means to let a young Gallant enter the Seraglio, who was of no great Quality, but proper, and of a good Meen. But among fuch a number of jealous and envious perfons, foe could not carry on her bufinefs fo pri vily, but die was difcover’d. Chah-Jehan, her Father, was foon advertifed of it, and refolved tofurprizeber, under the pretence of giving her a Vifit, as he ufed to do. The Princefs feeing him come unexpeded, had no more time than to hide this unfortunate Lover in one of the great Chaudrons made to Bath in s which yet could not befo done, but that Chah-Jehan fufpeded it. Mean time he quarrelled not with his Daughter, but entertained her a pretty while, as he was wont to do s and at length told her, that he found her in a carelefs and lefs neat podure s that it was convenient foe foould wafoher felf, and bathoftners commanding prefently, with fomewhat a dern countenance, that forthwith a Fire foould be made under thatChaudron, and he would not part thence, before the Eunuchs had brought him word, that that unhappy Man was difpatched. Some time after foe took other meafures, foe chofe for hzx Kane'fair an , that is, her Steward, a certain Perjian called Nazerkgn, who was a young Omrah, the handfomeft and mod accomplifocd of the whole Court j a Man of Courage and Ambition, theDar- lingof all, infbmuch that Chah-Hejikan, Uncle of Aureng-Zebe,proposed to marry him to the Princefs.: But received that Propofition very ill, and belides, when he was informed of feme of the fetret Intrigues that had been formed, he refolved quick ly to rid himfelf oVNazerkan. He therefore prefented to him, as 5 1were to do him honour, a Petele, which he could not refufe to chew prefently, after the cudom of the Countrey. Betek is a little knot made up of very delicate leaves, and feme other things, with a little chalk of Sea-Cockles, which maketh the mouth and lips of a ver milion colour, and the breath fweet and pleating. This young Lord thought of nothing lefs than being poyfoned : He went away from the Company very jocund and content* into his Pakky i but the Drug was fo drong, that before he could come to his houfe, he was no more alive. Rauchenara-Begum never palTed for fo handfom and fpiritual as Begum-Sabeh, hut foe was not lefs cheerful, and comely enough, and hated pleafures no more than her Siller. But foe addided her felf wholly to Aureng-Zebe, and confequently declared her felf an Enemy to Begum-Saheb and Vara. This was the caufe, that foe had no great Puches, nor any condderable foare in the Affairs of the State: Neverthelefs as foe was in the Se raglio, and wanted no Wit and Spies, foe could not but difeover many important mat ters, of which foe gave fecret advertifement to Aur.eng Zebe. Chah-Jehan, fbme years before the Troubles, finding himfelf charged with thefe four Princes, all come to Age, all Married, all pretending to the Crown, Enemies to one another, and each of them making fecretly a Party, was perplexed enough, as to what was fitted for him to do, fearing danger to his own perfon, and forefeeing what after wardsof the Empire of the M O G O L. wards betell him: For, to (hut .them up in Goualeor, which is a Fortrefs where th“ Princes are ordinarily kept clofe, and which is held impregnable, it being fituated upon an inacccilible Rock, and having within it felf good water, and provifion eriotwh for a Oarifon ; that was not foeatie a thing. They were too potent already, each of them having a Princely Train. And again, he could not handfomly remove them far off,with out giving them fomeGovernment fit for their Birth; wherein he apprehended tfow would Cantonize thendelves, and become little independent Kings, as adhiallv rhev afterwards did. Neverthelefs, fearing led they fliould cut one anothers Throat beW- his Eyes, if he kept them (fill at Court, he at laft concluded to fond them away. And fo he fent Sultan Sujab ,his fecondSon, info the Kingdom ot Bengale -, his third Au- mg-Zehe, into Decan-, and the youngeft, Morad-Bakche, to Guzaratte ; giving toIW the eldeft, Cabal and Multan. The three firft went away very well contentwith thofo Government, and there they adfed each the Soveraign, and retained all the Revenues of their refpedive Countries, entertaining great Troops, under the pretence of bridling their Subjects and Neighbours. As to Vara, becaufe the elded, anddefigned to the Crown, he birred not from the Court; Which that he (hould not do, fremed alfo to be the intention of Chah- 'Jeban, who entertained him in the hopes of focceeding him after his death. He even permitted then, that Orders were iffued out by him, and that he might fit in a kind of Throne, beneath his, among the Omrahs ; fot'hat it’feeme'd as if there wire two Kings together. But as ’tis very difficult fbr two Soveraigns to agree Cbab-Jeban,though Vara (hew’d him great obfervance and affedtion, always harbour’d’ .fane diffidence, fearing above all things the Morfel-, and belides, for as much as he knew the parts of Aureng-Zebe, and thought him more capable to Reign than any of the reft he had always ( as they fay ) fome particular correfpondence with him. ’ This it is, what I thought fit to premife concerning thefe four Princes, and their Fa- ther Cbab-Jeban, becaufe ’tis neceffary for the undemanding of all that follows I efteem'd alfo, that I was not to forget thofe two Princeffes, as having been the mbft confiderable A&amp;ors in the Tragedy ; the Women in the Indies taking very often, as well as at Conftantimple, and in many other places, the beft part in the moff important Tran- (adhons, though men take foldom notice of it, and trouble their heads of feekino- for other caufes. 0 But to deliver this Hiftory with clesnrnefs, wemuftrife fomewhat higher, and relate what paffed, fome time before the Troubles, between Aureng Zebe^ the King of Golkpnda and his Vifier Emir-Jemla s becaufe this will difeover to us the character and temper of Amng-Zebe, who is to be the Heros of this Piece, and the King of the Indies, Let us then fee, after what manner Emir-Jemla proceeded, to lay the firfi foundation of the Loyalty of Aureng Zehe, Durmg the time that Ameng-Zebe was in Vecan, the King of Goltynda had for his vilier and General of his Armies this Emir-Jemla^ who was a Eerfian by Nation, and very tanious in the Ifidies, He was not a man of great Extradion, but beaten in Bufi- seb, a perfon of excellent parts, and a great Captain. He had the wit of amaffing g re at Ireafures, not only by the ad mi nitration of the affairs of this opulent Kingdom nut alio by Navigation and Trade, fending Ships into very many Parts, and caufing the’ iatnond Mines,which he alone had farmed under many borrowed names,to be wrought with extraordinary diligence. So that people difeourfed almoft of nothing but of the Niches of Emir-Jemla, and of the plenty of his Diamonds, which were not reckon’d ut by backs. He had alfo the skill to render himfelf very potent and confiderable en- ertaming, befides the Armies of the King, very good Troops for his particular , ’ and o°ve a ] ] a very good Artillery, with abundance of Franguys orChrifiians to manage it. • he grew fo rich, and fo puiffant, efpecially after he had found a way to enter otheKmgdom of Kar nates, and to pillage all the ancient Churches of the Idols of ton r 0 jji tr ^ 5 that tne King or Golkpnda became jealous, of it, and prepared himfelf hin n ^ t u hecaufe he could not bear what was reported of h ll ^ Sit he ufed too great familiarity with the Queen his Mother, that was yet inp-^^ cover ^ nothing of hisdefign to any, having patience, and wait- An came to the Court, for he was then in the Kingdom of Karnates with his k ') * ^ ut one w h^n more particular News was brought him of what had paffed ^vv’cen his mother and him, he had not power enough to 'diffemble any longer , but niarG - rted by Ch()ler r ° fal110 inve&lt; ^ lve s and menaces : Whereof Emir was foon e acquainted, having at the Court abundance of his Wives Kindred, and all his nearefi6 The Hiftory of the Late Revolution neareft Relations and beft Friends pofTeffing the principal Offices. The King’s Mother alfo, who did not hate him, had fpeedy information of the fame. Which obliged Emir, without delay, to write to his only Son, Mahmt Emir-Kan ^ who then was about the King, requiring him to do the bed he could to withdraw with all fpeed from the Court, under fome pretence of Hunting, or the like, and to come and join with him. Mahmet Emir-Kan failed not to attempt divers ways b but, the King cauling him to be narrowly obferved, none of them all would fucceed. This very much perplexed Emir and made him take a ft range refolution, which call the King in great danger to lofe his Crown and Life i fo true ’tis, that he who knows not,to Viffemble, k/ 10 ^ s not howto Reign. He writ to /Iureng-Zcbe y who was then in Vaulet-Abaci, the Capital of Decan, about ffteenor bxteen days Journey from Golkgnda, giving him to underhand, that the King of Golkonda did intend to ruine him and his Family, notwithiianding the fignal Services he had done him, as all the World knew •, which was an unexampled Injufiice and In gratitude - , that this neccffitated him to take his refuge to him, and to intreat him, that he would receive him into his protection *, that, for the reft, if he would follow his ad vice, and confide in him, he would fb difpofe Affairs, that he would at once put into his - hands both the King and Kingdom of Golkonda. This thing he made very eafie , uhtig the following Difcourfe : You need but take four or five thoufand Horfe , of the belt of your Army, and to march with Expedition to fpreading a rumor by the way, that’tis an Ambaffador of CA«/;-Je/w /2 that goes in hafte, about confiderable mat ters, tofpeak with the King at Bag-naguer. The Vabir, who is 'he that is fir ft to be addrefted unto, to make any thing known unto the King, is allied to me, and my crea ture, and altogether mine , take care of nothing but to march with Expedition, and I will fo order it, that without making you known, you fhall come to theGa'te's of Bag- naguer b and when the King fhall come out to receive the Letters, according to cuftom, you may eatily feize on him, and afterwards of all his Family, and do with him what fhall feem good to youin regard that his houfe of Bag-uaguer, where he commonly relideS, is unwalkd and unfortified. He added, that he would make this Enterprife up on his own charges, offering him fifty thoufand Roitpies a day ( which is about five and twenty thoufand Crowns ) during the whole time of the March. Aureng-Zebe, who looked only for fome fuch occafion, h; d no mind at all to lofe fo fair an one. He foon undertook the Expedition, and did fo fortunateh manage his En terprife, that he arrived at Bag-naguer, without being otherwife known than as an Am- baffador of Chah-Jehan. The King of Goltynda being advertifed of the arrival of this pretended Ambaflador, came forth into a Garden, according to cuftom, received him with honour, and having unfortunately put himfelf into the hands of his Enemy, ten or twelve Slaves, Gurgis, were ready to fall upon and to feize his perfon, as had been pro jected h but that a certain OwmrE, touched with tendernefs, could rot forbear to cry out, (hough he was of the Party, and a creature of Emir, Doth not your Majejiy fee that ft Aureng-Zebe ? Away, or you are tak^n. Whereat the King being airighted, flips away, and gets haftily on horfeback, riding with all his might totheFortrefs of Golkon da, which is but a fhort League from thence. ^ - Aureng-Zebe feeing he was defeated inhisdefign, yet was not therefore difeompofed \ but feizedat the fame time on the Royal Houfe, takerh all the rich and good things he finds there h yet fending to the King all his Wives ( which over all the Indies is very re- ligioufly obferved ) and goeth to befiege him in his Fortrefs. But as the Siege, for want of having brought along all Neceifarics, held on long, and lafted above two months, he received order from Chah-Jehan to raife it, and to retire into Decan again * fo that, although the Fortrefs was reduced toExtremities, for want of Victuals and Ammunition of War, he found himfelf obliged to abandon his Enterprife. He knew very well, that it wasDara and Begum that hadinducm Chab-Jehan to fend thefe Or ders, from the apprehenfion they entertained, he ilould become too powerful, but in the mean time he never difcoveFd any refentment of it, faying only, that he ought to obey the Orders of his Father. Yet he withdrew not, without caufing under-Hand payment to be made to him of all the Charges of his Expedition : Bcfides, he rnmied his Son Sultan Mahmoud to the eldeft Daughter of that King, with a promife, that he would make him his Succeffor, caufing him alfo to’give him for a Dowiy the Furtrds and the Appurtenances of Bamguyre. He alfo made the King confent, that all the Silver Money that(hould be Coined for the future in that Kingdom, fhould bear on one fide the hxmsot Chah-Jehan '-i and that Emir-Jemla fhould withdraw with his whole Fami- ly, all his Goods, Troops, and Artillery. LhefeThe Htftory of the Late Revolution undone, and that he that (liould be Conqueror would rid himfelf of all the reft, as for- inei ly Chah- Jehan had done of his Brothers. Sultan Snjab, who had heaped up great Treafures in that rich Kingdom of Bengale , ruining feme of the Rajas or petty Kings that are in thofe Parts, and drawing great Sums hom others, took the Field firft of all with a puiffant Army, and in the confidence he had of all the Ferftan Omrabs, for the Secft of whom he had declared himfelf, he boldly marched towards Agra, giving out openly, that Cbab-Jeban was dead, that Vara had poifond him, that he would revenge the death of his Father, and, in a word, that he would be King. Vara defired Cbab-Jeban to write himfelf to him, and to forbid him to advance further i which he did, alluring him, that his ficknefs was not at all dangerous, and that he was already much better. But he having Friends at Court, who affured him that the licknefs of Cbab-Jeban was mortal, he diffembled, and ceafed not to advance, faying ftill, that he knew very well Chab-Jeban was dead i and if he ftiould be alive, he was defirous to come and kifs his feet, and to receive his Com mands. Auretig-Zebe immediately after, if not at the fame time, taketh the Field alfo in Re- can, maketh a great noife, and prepareth to march towards Agra. The fame prohi bition was made to him alfo&gt; as well {tomCbab-Jeban, as homVara, who threaten’d him. But he diffembleth, for the fame reafon that Sultan Sujah had done, and giveth the like anfwer. Mean time, finding that his Treafure was low, and his Soldiery very inconliderable, hedevifed two Artihces, which fucceeded admirably well’, the one, in regard of Morad-Balybe j the other, in refped of Emir-Jemla. To Morad-Batyh he writes with fpeed a very fair Letter, importing, tW he had always been his true and intimate Friend j that, as for himfelf, he laid no claim at all to the Crown i that he might remember, he had all his life-time made profeffion of a Fahire,b\it that Rara was a perfon incapable to govern a Kingdom 5 that he was a Kafer, dn Idolater, and hated of all the greateft Omrabs *, that Sultan Sujab was a Rafezy, an Heretick,and by confe- tuence an Enemy to Indojian, and unworthy of the Crown : So that, in a word, there m as none but he ( Morad-Bak^he ) that could reafonably pretend to the Succeftion; that the Crown did exped him i that the whole Court, which was not ignorant of his Valor, would be for him ? and that for his particular , if he would promife him , that being King,he would give him leave to live quietly in fome corner or other of his Empire,there to ferve God the remainder of his days&gt; he was ready to make a conjundion with him, to affifthim with hisCounfel and Friends, and to put into his hands his whole Army, to fight Vara and Sultan Sujab j that in the mean time he fent him an Hundred thoufand Rupies ( which make about Fifty thoufand Crowns of our money ) and prayed him to accept thereof as a pledge of his friendlhip ? and that he would advife him to come with all poilible fpeed to feiie on the Caftle of Suratte, where he knew to be theTrea- fure of the Land. Morad-Bahgbe, who was neither too rich, nor too powerful, received with much joy thisPropofition of Aureng-Zebe, and the Hundred thoufand Rupies fent by himj and fhew’d Aureng-Zebe^s Letter to every body, thereby to oblige the Flower of that Coun trey to take up Arms for him, and the fubftantialMerchants to lend him the more wil lingly fuch Sums of money as he demanded of them. He began in good earneftto a6t the King, made large promifes to all, and, in fhort, did fo well&gt; that he fet a good Ar my on foot, of whom he fingled out fopue Three thoufand, who, under the condudof Chab-Abas, one of his Eunuchs, but a valiant man,fhould go tobefiege Szmrttc. Aureng-Zebe fent his eldeft Son, Sultan Mahmoud ( him whom he had married to the Daughter of the King of Golkynda ) to Ewir-yew/^, who was yet employed in the fiege ‘of Kalians, to perfwade him to come to him to Vaulet-Abad, pretending to have mat ter of the greateft importance to communicate to him. Emir, who foon fufpe&amp;ed his intentions! excufed himfelf, faying openly, that Cbah-Jeban was not dead, tbathe had frefh News of his being alive, and that befidesjall his Family being at Agra in the hands of Vara, he could by no means affift Aureng-Zebe, nor declare himfelf for him. Where upon Sultan Mahmoud return’d to Vaulet-Abad, without effecting any thing, and very much diffatisfted with Emir. But Aureng-Zebe loft no courage for all that, but fent the fecond time to Emir, yet not Suit an Mahmoud, but Sultan Mazum his fecondSon, who prefented to him his Fathers Letter, and handled him with that dexterity, fweetne s, and proteftation of friendfhip, that it was not poflible to refift him. Emir therefore prefted the fiege of Kaliane, forced the befieged to furrender upon compofition 3 took theof the Empire of the M O G O L. choice ot his Army, and with all diligence went away with Sultan Mazum. At his ar rival, Aureng-Zebe courted him in the highefl degree, treating him no otherwife than with the name oi Baba and Babagy^ that is. Father, Lord-Father i and after an hun dred Embraces, he took him fomewhat afide, and told him ( according to what I could learn from perfons who knew of it ) Eh at it mu not juft, that having hi* Family at the Court, he jhould adventure to do any thing in his behalf that might come to be known *, but that, after all, there was nothing fo difficult but an Expedient might be found. Give me leave therefore, faid he, to propofe to you a Veftgn, which at firft will poffiibly furprife you , but, fince you apprehend the danger of your Wife and Children that are in Hoftage, the bed way of providing for their fecurity would be, to fuffier me to'feize on your perjon, and to put you in Prifon. It is out of doubt, that all the World will believe it done in earncft : For who would imagine, that fuch a perfon as you would be content to let your felf be laid in Pri fon? In the interim, I could make ufe of part of your Army, and of your Artillery, as you fhall judge moft proper and convenient: Ion alfo could furnifh me with a Sum of mo ney, as you have frequently offered itand be fide s, met h inky I might tempt Fortune further and we might together take, our meafures, to fee in what manner I had heft to demean my fdfi if you would alfo permit, that I might caufe you to be tranjported into the Fortrefs 0/Dau- let-Abad, where you Jhould be Mailer ? and that there. I might have you kypt by my own Son, Sultan Mazum, or Sultan Mahmoud j this would yet better palliate the matter, and I fee not, what Dara could juftly Jay of it, nor how he could reafonably treat your Wife and Children ill* Emir, whether it were by reafon of the friendlhip he had fworri to Atireng-Zehe , or for the great promifes made to him, or the apprehenfion he had, of feeing near him Sul tan Mazum, who flood by, very penfive and well armed, and Sultan Mahmoud, who looked grim upon him for his coming away at the folicitation of his Brother, not at that of his, and bad at his very entrance lift up his foot, as if he would have hit him 5 what ever of thefe Coniiderations might induce him, confented to all what Aureng-Zebe defi- , red, and approved of the Expedient to fufler himfelf to be imprifon’d j fo that Auren?- Zebe being no fooncr gone, but the great Maflcr of the Artillery was feen to approach with feme flercenefs to Emir, and to command him in the name of Aureng-Zebe to fol low him, locking him up in a Chamber, and there giving him very good words, whilfl all the Soldiery that Aureng-Zebe had thereabout, wotK to their Arms. ThVreport of the detention of Emir-Jemla was no fooner fpreal|Sfct a great Tumult arofej and thofe, whom he had brought along with him, althod® |ftonifli’d, yet put fhemfelvcs into a poflure of refeuinghim, and with their Sworcfs drawn ran to force the Guards, and the Gate of his Prifon, which was eafie for them to do: For Aureng-Zebe had not with him fuflicient Troops to make good fo bold an Enterprife, the only name efiEmir- Jemla made all tremble. But the whole matter being altogether counterfeited, all thefe Commotions were prefently calmed, by the intimations that were given to the chief Of ficers of Emirs Army, and by the prefence of Aureng-Zebe, who there appeared very refolute with his two Sons, and fpoke now to one, then to another i and at lafl Pro mifes and Prefects, liberally beflowed on thofe that w T ere concerned. So that all the Troops of Emir, and even mofl of thofe of Chah-Jehan, feeing things troubled, and being without their General, and believing Chah-Jehan to be dead, or, at befl, defpe- r ^tely lick i conlidering alfo the ample promifes made to them of augmenting their bti- P en d, and of giving them at that very time three months Advance, fopn Lifted them- Llves under Aureng-Zebe who having feized on all the Equipage of Emir, even his v ery Camels and Tents,took the Field, rdolved to march to the Siege of Suratte, and to ballen the taking it in ■&gt; where Morad-Bakche was exceedingly embarrafled,bccaufe that bis befl Troops were employed there,and that he found more refiftance in that place than be imagined* But Aureng-Zebe, after feme days March, was informed, that the Go- v ernor had furrendred the Place i for which he fent Congratulations to Morad-Bdkphe, acquainting him withal of his Tranfadlions with Emir-Jemla, and affuring him, that he bad Forces and Money enough, and very good intelligence at the Courts that nothihg was wanting-, that he was dire&amp;ly going to Brampour and Agra i that he had expeded km on the way, and therefore ddired him to join with him., 1 Tis true, that Morad-Bakche found not fo much money in the Fortrefs of Suratte as’ ie bad imagined,-whether it were that really there was not fo much as was reported, 0r whether the Governor had diverted a part of it, as fome believed : Yet notwith- banding that little he found there was ufeful to him, to pay the Soldiers that had Lifted ~ ' h ' v 0The Hi (lory of the Late Revolution themfelves in hopes of the advantages, they (hould make of the imagined vaft Treafure Tstmic. ’Tis not lefs true, that he had no greater reafon to boaft of the taking of this Place in regard there was not any Regular Fortification about it, and yet his Army had lain before it above a month, and would never have reduced it without the who furoittied them with the Invention of Springing a Mine, which rum- hL a great fide of the Wall, call the befieged into fuch a Confternation, that it made hem immediately furrender. The redudlion of this Town did much advance his De- fian Fame proclaiming immediately throughout thefe Countreys, that Morad-Bakck had'taken Suratte i that he had fprung a Mine, which founded very big among the Indians who as yet do little underftand that praaice i and that there he had found a valf Treafure. Notwithflanding this great noife, and all the firfi advapiages, joyned to all thofe frequent Letters and great Promifts of Aurmg-Me, the Eunuch CW- Abas, a Man of good Senfe, of a great Heart, and exceedingly affedl.onate to the Ser- vice of his Mafter 5 was not of opinion, that Morad-Bakche^ fhouid io^ much tye him- felf in Inter eft to Aureng-Zebe^ or precipitate nis conjunction with him, but advifec] }# that he fhouid amufe him with words, and let him advance alone towards that in the mean time there would come certain News of the ficknefs otChab-jebanj that he Qiould firlf fee what Channel Affairs would run in i that he fhouid bortihe Suratte, as a very good Poft, able to render him Matter of a very large and rich Coun trey •, and that perhaps in time he might feize Brampour, which is a very confiderable Paffageof a River, and as ’twere a Bar of Vecart. But the continual Letters and Proteftations of Aurem-Zebe joyned to the fmall Forces, Artillery, and Treafure of Morad-Bal^he, blinded with an exccffive ambition to Reign, made him regardlefs of all other conh- derations fo that he went away from Amadevad, abandoned Guzaratte, and took his way through the Woods and Mountains, with all Expedition, to be at the Rendez- vouz, where Aureng-Zebe had looked for him thefe two or three clays. Great Solemnities of Joy were made at the conjundion of the two Armies, the Prin ces vifited one another, Aureng-Zebe piade a hundred Proteffations and no lefs Promi- fes to Morad-Bak$be , affured him afrefh, and folemnly, of his not caring for the Crown, as alfo of his being there for no other end than to aflift him again!! Vara, their Common Enemy, and to place him in the Throne, which expededhim. Upon this Enterview, and confirmation of Friendfhip, both Armies marched toge ther, continuing always, during the March, in the Proteffations of Friend- ihip,’and in his Courtfhip to Morad-Balybe, treating him never other wife, whether in publick or private, but with the Title of Hazaret, that is, King and Majeffy: So that Morad-Bakcbe was fully perfwaded, that Aureng-Zebe meant fincerely, from an excefs of affedion towards him i whence he even willingly, and without Ceremony, buffered thefubmiffions and refpeds he ftiewed him i inffead of remembring what had lately paired at Golkonda? and of confidering, that he, who had thus hazarded himfelf with fo much boldnefs to ufurp a Kingdom, was not of a temper to live and dye a Fakirs. Thefe two Armies thus joyned made a Body confiderable enough y which begot a great noife at Court, and gave caufe of thoughtfulnefs, not only to Vara, but to Cbahn Jeban himfelf, who knew the great parts and fubtle Condud of Aureng-Zebe, and the Courage of Morad-Bakghe and who forefaw wery well, that a fire was a kindling, which would be very hard to quench. It was to no purpofe to write Letters upon Let ters, fignifying that he was well, and giving Order that they fhould turn back to their refpedive Governments, and exprefling alfo, that he would forget all that had paffed hitherto. All his Letters were not able to hinder their Advance i and as the ficknefs of Cbab-Jeban did tt\\\ pafs for mortal, there being no perfons wanting to bring and fpread fuch News, they ftill continued to diffemble, giving out, that they were Letters counterfeited by Vara\ that Cbab-Jeban was dead indeed j but that, in cafe he were alive, they would go to kifs his Feet, and deliver him from the hands of Vara, What then fhouid Cbab-Jeban, this unfortunate King, do, who feeth, that his Sons have no regard to his Orders i who is informed at all hours, that they march apace to wards Agra in the head of their Armies, and who in this conjun&amp;ure finds himfelf Nk to boot in the hands of Vara, that is, of a man who breatheth nothing but War j who prepareth for it with all imaginable earneffnefs,and with all the marks of an enraged re- fentment againfi his Brothers,but what could he do in this extremity ? He is confirained to abandon to them his Treafures, and to'leave them to their difpofal. He is force to fend for his old and moft trufiy Captains, whom he knows for the moil part t0 je notof the Empire of the M O G O L, very aifedionate to Vara *, he muft command them to hght for Vara^ again# his own Blood, his own Children, and thofe, for whom he hath more dteem than for Vara b he is obliged forthwith to fend an Army again# Sultan Sujah, becaufe ’tis he that is moft advanced i and he is to fend another again# Aureng-Zebe and Mored-Ba\che 0 who no lefs are marching towards him. Soliman Chekguh, the elde# Son of Vara^ a young Prince of about five and twenty years of Age, very proper of Body, and of good Parts and Condud, generous, libe ral, and univerfally beloved, efpecially ot Cbah-Jehan^ who had already enriched him, and who confidered /wra rather for his Succeffor than ZW, was he, that was made General of this Army again# Sujah. Neverthelefs Chah-Jeban, who wiftied much ra ther, that Sujah were returned to Bengale, than that the matter fiiould be tryed by a bloody Combat, which could not be but very Tragical, and wherein he run the hazard of lofing one or other of his Sons, gave him for Companion an Ancient Raja, called Jejfeigne, who is at prefent one of the powerfulleft and riche# Rajahs of all Indoftan y and one of the able# in the whole Kingdom, with a fecret Order not to fight, except it were altogether unavoidable i as alfo to endeavour by all means to induce Sujah to retire, and to referve his Forces for a better occafion} that is to fay, after they fhould have feen the event of the ficknefs of Chah-Jthan, and the fucccfs of Aunng-Zebe y and of Morad-Bahphe. But this young Prince, Soliman Cbekpuh, full of heat and Cou rage, breathing after nothing but to iignalize himfelf by feme great a&amp;ion, and Sultan Sujah fearing le# Aureng-Zebe gaining a Battle fliould fir# make himfelf Mafier of the Capital Towns of the Empire, and Vehly * it was impoifible for the Raja Jeffeigne to keep them from a Combat. The two Armies are no fooner in fight of one another, but they prepare to fall on, and they were not long from giving fome Vollies of Can non. I fhall not relate the particulars of this Fight, for, befides that the narration of it would be too long and tedious, in the fequel of this Hiftory we (hall be obliged to deferibe more confiderable ones, by which the Pceader will be able to judge of this. Tis fufficient to know in general, that the fir# onfet was very (harp and obfiinate on both (ides, but that at length Soliman Chekpuh did urge Sujah with that force and vigour that he difordered him, and made him fly: So that if Jefieigne y and the Vat an Velil-kan, who was one of the fir# Captains and a valiant Man, but an intimate friend of the Raja, and did not ad but being moved by him, had feconded him in good came#, 5 tis thought that the whole Army of Sujah would have been defeated, and himfelf in dan ger of being taken t But that was not the delign of the Raja to deftroy him, no more than it was that of Chah-Jehan, who had given him order to the contrary. Thus then had Sujah time to retreat, and that without lofing any confiderable number of his Men*, yet becaufe Soliman Chehpuh kept the field, and brought away fome pieces of Ar tillery, it was prefently bruited at Court, that Sujah had been totally overthrown. This Defeat purchafed great reputation to Soliman Chekpuh y leflened much the efieem of Sultan Sujah) and cooled exceedingly all the Perfians that had an inclination for him. After that fome days were fpent in the purfuit of Sujah, the Prince Soliman Chekpuh) who every day received News from the Court, and who learned that Aureng-Zebe and Morad-Rackphe did approach with great refolution, well knowing, that his Father Va- ra had no great flock of Prudence, but good ftore of fecret Enemies, refolved to quit the purfuit of Sultan Sujah, and with all fpeed to return to Agra, where in all appear ance Vara was to give Battel again# Aureng-Zebe and Morad-Bakphe. This was the be# counfel he could take, for no man doubts, that if he could have been there in good time, Aureng-Zebe would not have had the Advantage i and D tis even believed, he would never have hazarded the Combat, the Party being too unequal i but the bad fortune of Vara did not permit it. Whilft all that was thus tranfa&amp;ed towards Elabas, which is the place where the Gemna is joyned to Ganges i the Scene was very different on the fide of Agra. At the Court they were much furprifed to hear, that Aureng-Zebe had paflfed the/ River of Brampour, and all the other paffages that were mo# difficult between the Mountains y fo that with all haft they fent away feme Troops to difpute with him the paflfage of the River Eugenes* whilft the whole Army was making ready. For which purpofe there were chofen two of the moft confiderable and the moft powerful of the Kingdom to command it *, the one was Kafem-Kan, a Renowned Captain and very affedtionate to Chah-Jehan, but one that had no great inclination to Vara, and who went not but to oblige Chah-Jehan, whom he faw in the hands of Vara : The other was Jejfomfeigne, a C 2 ' potent12 The Hi(lon of the Late Revolution potent not inferior to J(ffeigne 1 and Son-in-law to that Raja Ram. who was at the time of Etyar fo puiffanr, as if he had been the Emperor of the Raja's. Dara at their farewel exprcfl'ed to them great kindnefs, and prefented them nobly, but Chab- Jehan took his time, before their departure, to charge them in {caret, as he had done the Ra]a 'Jtjfeigne, when he went away in the Expedition againft Snltan Supb with dohman Chokouh. Neither were they wanting, in their March, to fend fe- veral times to Aureng-Zebe and Morad-Bakelie-, to perfwade them to turn back: But this was in vain } their Envoys came not again, and the Army advanced with that dili gence, that they faw it much (boner than they thought uyon a riling ground, not U £ remote from the Pwiver. It being then Summer, and the feafon of the greateft heats, the River w 7 as fordable* which was the caufe, that at the fame time Kajon-kan and the Raja prepared them- fclves to give Battel j befides that, they (bon knew the refolution of Aureng-Zebe that he would force them, fince that,although his Army was not all come up, he oave them feme Vollies of Cannon*, his defign being toamufe them, fearing left they theni- felves (hould pafs the River, not only to prevent his paffage, but alfo to hinder his Ar my from repoliug,and from taking an advantageous poll i which was indeed in great dif- order, and fo tired by their March, and fo faint by the heat, that if at the very firlt it had been affaulted, and kept from palling the Water, it would doubtlefs have been routed without much rdillance. [ 1 was not by in this hr ft Encounter, but thus it was generally difeourfed of, and it agreeth with the after-relation of many of oisr French men, who ferved Aureng-Zebe in the Artillery- ] But they were content to hay at the River-fide, to keep Aureng-Zebe from palling it, according to the Order they had re* ceived. After that Aureng-Zebe had let his Army red two or three days, and by amufing the Enemy,had fitted, it to pafs the River,he made his whole Artillery play, which was very well placed s and he commanded, that under the favour of the Cannon drey (liould pafs the River. Kafem Kan and the Raja, on their part, difeharged theirs alfo, and did what they could to repulfe the Enemy, and to keep him from palling. The Combat was (harp enough at firfi, and very obflinately maintained by the extraordinary Valour of JefJomfeigne. For as to Kafem-Kan, although a great Captain, and a flout Man, he gave no great proof of his Valour in this occaiion j yea, fome accufe him of Treachery, charging him that he had in the night caufed the Bullets and Powder to be hid under the Sand, there being no more of them to be found after two or three difehar- ges. However it be, the Combat for all that was, as I faid, very refolutely carried on, and the Pa'ffage long difputed. There were Rocks in the Bed of the River, which did much embarais,and the Banks in many places were very high and difficult to climb up.But at hd,Morad-Backc.be call himfelfinto the water with fo much refolution and ! force, and file wed fo much valour and boldnefs, that there was no refifiing of him. He palled over, and with him a good part of the Army, which made Kafem-Kan to give back, and call Jcfomjhgne into great danger of his Perfon. For by and by he found the whole Body of the Enemy upon him, and without the extraordinary refolution of his Ragipom who almoft all were killed about him, he had been a dead man. One may judgeof the great danger he was in upon this occafion, by this, that after he had difengaged himielf as well as he could, and was come back to his own, not daring to return to bccaufe of the great lofs he had fuffered, of feven or eight thoufand Ragipom he had but five or fix hundred of them remaining. Thefe Ragipom jxho take their name from the J'Ojj.r,that is to fay,the Children of the Ra- are from Father to Son fuch Men as make the Sword their Profeffion. The Rajas Subjcas they aie,do afiign themLands for their fubfi(lence,on condition to be always rea dy to go to War when furomoned.

He is ready to kill his Son Mabmet Emir-Kan, and will fend his Wife and Daughter to Bafar, or the Market-place of prollituted Women ; and’tis paft doubt, that he would have done fome fuch thing, if with much art and prudence, had not moderated the excefs of his paffion, in remonftrating to him that Emir-Jernla had not fo little condud, nor fo great a friendlhip for Aureng-Zebe, ’as to hazard, and in a manner to facrifice his Family, for the advancing of his Interelf; that Aureng-Zebe muft needs have gulled and enfnared him, by his ufual artifice and cun nmg. As for Aureng-Zebe and Morad-Bakfbe, the happy foccefs of this firft Encounter did o (well their hearts, and gave fuch Courage to their whole Army, that henceforth they believed themfelves invincible, and capable to compafs any thing. Belides, the more to animate his Soldiers, bragged openly, that he had'Thirty thoufand Mara/x at his devotion in the Army of Vara ; and there was fomething in it, asappearedby the fcquel. Mortd-Babgbe was for nothing but lighting, and would march with all dili gence. But Aureng-Zebe reprefented to him, that it was neceffary the Army fhould re- «e(h themfelves for fome time upon the Banks of this fweet River; that in the mean tune he would write to all his Friends, and get a full and certain information of the (fate w the Court, and of the condition of all Affairs. So that he marched not towards till he had relied fome days, and after that he marched but (lowly , to inform of ail, and to take his time and meafures. „ / C p n , CC , rning Cbah ~J eha, h w hen he plainly faw the refolution of Aimng-Zzbz and Mo- rjr - akche&gt; and that there was no hope left to make them turn back, he was in fuch a P^rp exity, that he knew not what to refolve, and forefeeing fome great calamity . he would fain have hind red the M decifive Battel, for which he faw Vara preparing him- pit vv,th great eagernefs. But what could he do to oppofe it ? He was yet too weak of ! 1S 1C j e ^&gt; ai ‘h faw himfelf ftiil in the hands of Dara 0 whom, as 1 have faid he M ^ not mu£ h • So that he found himfelf obliged to acquicfce in his Wil^and to com mitJ 4 The Hi (lory of the Late Revolution roit to him all the Forces of the Empire, and to command all Captains to obey him Immediately all was in Arms: I know not, whether there was ever a more gallant Ar my been in Indofian. Tis faid, that there were little lefs than an Hundred thoufand Horfe, and Twenty thoufand Foot, with Four thoufand pieces of Cannon , without reckoning the incredible number of Servants, Followers, Viduallers, whom Hifrorians methinks, do often put into the number of the Combatants, when they fpeak of thofe formidable Armies of Three or four- hundred thoufand men,of which their Books are full Though this Army was very brave, and ftrong enough to cut in pieces two or three of fuch as Aureng-Zehe had, in which there were no more than Thirty Five or Forty thou fand men in all, and thefe tired and haraffed by a very long and irkfom march, during the height of the Heats *, and but a fmall number of Cannon, in refpe® of that of Vara. Mean time „( which feems hard to believe ) there was fcarce any Body that prc-' faged well for Vara, all knowing, that mod: of the chief Omrahs had no affedfion for him* and that all the good Soldiers that vvere for him, and whom he might confide in were in the Army of Soliman Chetyuh, his Son. And 3 t was for this reafon, that the mod prudent and the mod faithful of his Friends, and Chah-Jehan himfelf, cbunfelled him not to hazard a Battel: Chah-Jehan offering, as infirm as he was, that he would go in to the Field himfelf, and be carried before Aureng-Zehe, to interpofe*, which was looked upon as a very good Expedient for Peace, and for accommodating the Affairs of Chah- Jehan. For 3 tis certain, that Aureng-Zehe and Morad-Bakche, would never have had the boldnefs to fight againd their own Father j and if they fhould have attempted it, they would have fmarted for it, becaufe, befides that the match was not equal, and all the great Omrahs were fo affecf ionate to Chah-Jehan,that they would not have failed to fight refolutely, if they had feen him in the head of the Army, befides this, I fay, the Cap tains themfelves of Aureng-Zebe and Morad-Rakcbe, bore great affecdion and refpctd to this Prince, whofe Creatures they mod were* and the whole Army, in a manner, was his. So that in all appearance, not one of them would have prefumed to draw his Sword againd him, nor he been at the pains of drawing his. Then they advifed Vara, that if he would not hearken to this Expedient, he fhould at lead not precipitate the bufinefs, but delay, ’till Soliman Chehouh, who made all hade to join, were come in. Which was alfo very good counfel, in regard that that Prince was beloved of all, and was lately come home victorious, and had the mob faithful and tne braved Soldiers with him. But ZXmz would never hearken to any Propodtion that could be made to him, and he thought on nothing elfe but to give Battel prefently, and to go againd Aureng-Zebe in perfon. And poffibly he did not amifs, as to his own Ho nour and particular Intered, if he could have commanded Fortune,arid made things fuc- ceed as he contrived them. For theCondderations he had (as he could not forbear now and then to difcover ) were fome fuch as thefe: He looked upon hrmfelf as Mader of the perfon of Chah-Jehan \ that he could did pofe of him as he pleafed j that he was alfo Poffeffor of 411 the Treafuresand Forces of the Empire i that Sultan Sujah was half ruined i that his two other Brothers, with a weak and tired Army, were come to cad themfelves into his hands } that, if he gained the Battel, they could not efcape him •, that he fhould all at once be abfolute Mader, and at the end of all his troubles, and at the height of his wifiies, fo as no body could con- tradid him in any thing, or difpute the Crown with him. Whereas if Chah-Jehan fhould take the Field, all Affairs would be accommodated, his Brothers would return to their Governments, Chah-Jehan, who began to recover/ his health, would refume the Government as before, and all things would return into their fird Channel: That, if he fhould day for Soliman Cbekouh, his Son, Chah-Jehan might take fome defign to his dif- advantage, or contrive fomething with Aureng-Zebe '■&gt; that whatever he could do for gaining the Vidory, the Reputation which Soliman Cbekouh had purchafed , would dill give him all the honour of it. And after that, what would 4 not he be capable to undertake, fwelled with fo much glory and fuccefs, and efpecially being fupported , as he was, by the favour and affedion of Chah-Jehan, and of the greateh part of the Omrahs ? What did he know, whether he would keep any modehy, or any refped for him, and whither his Ambition might not carry him ? Thefe Confiderations mad-e Vara refolve to band out againd the counfel of all, and to purfue his Point. And for that purpofe, he commanded immediately the whole Army to take the Field, and thereupon came to take leave of Chah- Jehan, who was in the For- trefsof the Empire of the M O G O L. ~~ 7 ~ 7 ~TZii This aood old Man was ready to melt in tears, when he embraced him; S failed not to reprefent to him, with a very grave countenance: Well, T&gt;jra r llt Ann ait refolved to follow thine own Will, Go,God bids thee, but remember well (incetnoua ^ nn th $ atu l ta^ heed of ever coming my Prefence. i!

But here he failed t of which I (hall now (hew the occafion and how thereby the Scale was turned to Jureng-Zebe’s advantage ’ Paw perceived that his left Wing was in great diforder, and he was informed, that Ru/taM-Kanand Cbatnfak were killed; that Ramfiigne Komle had too far advanced that he had indeed forced the Enemy, and made way through the midft of them-, but that now he was furrounded every way, and in very great danger. This it was, which made Vara dehfl from his defign of making directly towards Aurerig-Zebe, that he might go to fuccour his left Wing. There at firft the Battel was alfo very ffiarp but Vara at laft carried it 5 forcing and routing all, yet fo, as that there hill remained fomethino that retmed and hopped him. Mean time, Kamfeigne Koutle fought with fo much cou rage and vigour as was poilible. He wounded Morad-Bakphe^ and came fo near him that nt began to cut the Girdles of his Elephant, to make him fall down* but the valour and good fortune of Morad-Bakhe gave not time enough for it. In fhort, never any Man fought and defended himfelf morebmvely, than Morad-Bak^he did on this occati- °n: All wounded as he was, and prehed by thc'Ragipous oi Kamfeigne Routle who were round about him, he was not daunted, nor gave way in the leah, but knew fo t- fu? o S a hhough he was, belides defending himfelf, to cover with his Ihield a Son of his, but of feven or eight years of Age, who was fitting on his hde, he made an Arrow-lhot fo luckily at Ranifeigne Ilsutle, that it made him fall dead to the ground. Vara foon heard the fad News of this Accident but at the fame time he underhood alio that Morad-Bakcbe was in very great danger* the Ragipom fighting furioufly, and like Lions, to revenge the death of their Maher. And though he faw, on that fide the way was very difficult, and that he hill found Lome fmall Body oppofing and retarding him * yet he was determined to rufh through to Morad-Backcbe : And doubt- lefs this was the beh he could do, and that, which was capable to repair the fault he had committed in not doing his bufinefs thoroughly with Aureng-Zebe. But his bad fortune kept him from it, or rather, one of the blackeh Treacheries that ever was ima gined, and the greateft overfight that was ever committed, did caufethe entire lofsand ruin of Vara, Calil-ullab-Kan (he that commanded the thirty thoufand Mogols , which made the right Wing, and were alone able to defeat the whole Army of Aureng-Zebe) did, whilft Vara and his left Wing fought with fo much courage and fuccefs, keep off, as idle as if he were not concerned in the fray, not perrpitting any one of his Horfemen to uioot an Arrow, with a pretence, that they were for a Referve, and that he had ex- prefs Order not to fight but in the lalf extremity. But the true caufe was, that he re- ferved, in his bread the rancour of an old Affront, done him by Vara, when he com manded him to be (truck. But after all, this Treachery would have done no great mifchief, if this infamous Man had contented himfelf with this firft Effedl of his Re- Entment: Behold, how far he carried his rage, and revengefulnefs ! He cut himfelf off rom his ' main Body, and taking only a few men with him, rid with all poifible fpeed towards Vara, at the fame time when he was turning to fall on Morad-Bakpbe, and bein § come fo near as to make himfelf be heard, cryed out with all his force * Mobba- Kcl^bad, Hazaret, Salamct, Elbamdul-ella * God fave your Majefiy, you have obtain ed the Victory * ^what will you do any longer upon your Elephant &gt; Is it not enough, mat you have expofed your felf fo long ? if the lead of thofe (hots, that have been made into your Vais, had reached your Perfon, what would have become of us ? Are mere Traitors wanting in this Army? in the Name of God come down quickly and mke Horfe. What remains more to be done, than to purfue thofe Run-aways. Let Us do fo, nor let us fuffer that they (houlde efcape our hands! f Vara had had wit enough to difcover the cheat, and to confider upon a fudden me confequences of his not appearing any more upon the Elephant, and being no mere fcen by the whole Army, always eying him, or rather, if he had prefently com manded to cut off the Head of this Para fiscal Traitor, he had been Mader of all. But me good Prince differed himfelf to be blinded by thefe fweet words’: He hearkned to . ms advice, as if it had been very true and very fincere* he defeended from his Elephant, £ , , andand took Horfe. But I know not whether there pafTed one quarter of an hour, but he perceived the Treachery of Calil ullah-Kan^ and repented himfelf extremely of the great fault he had committed. He looks about him, he feeketh, he asketh where he is i he faith, he is a Traitor, he will'kill him. But the perfidious Villain is by this time at a good diftarice;•&gt; theoccafion is loll. Would it be bdieved, that as foon as the Army perceived Vara to be no more upon the Elephant, they imagined that there was Treafon, that Vara was killed j and all were frruck with fuch a terror, that every o,ne thought on nothing, but how to.efcape the hands of Aumg-Zebe^ and tofave him felf? Whatlhall 1 fay? All the Army disbands and flyeth. A fudden and ft range re volution! He that law himfelf juit now Vidorious, finds himfelf in a few moments vanquilhed, abandoned, and obliged to fly himfelf to fave his life. Aureng-Zebe, by. holding out firm a quarter of an hour upon his Elephant, feeth the Crown of Indojim upon his Head and Vara for haying comedown a little too foon, feeth himfelf preci pitated from the Throne, and the mod unfortunate Prince of the World. Thus For-- tune taketh pleafure, to make the gaio.orlofs of a Battel, and the decifion of a great Empire, depend upon a nothing. Thde great and prodigious Armies, his true, do fometimes great things i but when once terror feifeth, and diforder comes among them, what means of flopping the Com motion ? 3 Tis like a great Puver broke through its Dams i. it mud overrun all, without a Remedy. Whence it is, that as often as 1 confider the condition of fuch Armies, ddli- tute of good order, and marching like flocks of Sheep, 1 perfwade my felf, that, if in thefe parts one might lee an Army of live and twenty thoufan'd men, of thefe old Troops of Flanders^ under the condudt of Monfeur le Prince, or Monfimr de Jurmie, I doubt not at all, but they would trample underfoot all thofe Ai^ntcs,hqw,numerous fo- ever they were. And this it is, that now maketh me not find it any longer ftrange or in credible, what we are told of ten thoufand Greeks' ? and of fifty .thdufand Men of Alex ander, overcoming fix or feven hundred thoufand Men of Vmm i ( if' it be true, that (We were fo many, and that the Hidorian did not reckon the Servants, and all thofe numbers of Mem which were to follow the Army, to furnifh it with Eorrage, Cattle, Corn, and all other neceflaries. ) Bear only the fivd brunt, which would be no very difficult thing for us to do s and behold, they are all adonifhed : Or, do like Alexander, fet vigoroufly upon one place, if that hold not out, (' which will be very hard for them to do ) you may be fure the work is done i all the red prefently take fright and Eight together. Aureng-Zebe, encouraged by fuch a wonderful fuccefs, is not wanting to turn every done,i to employ skill, dexterity, fubtilty, craft, courage, to profit by all the Advan tages, which fo favourable an occafion puts into his hands. Cald-ullah-Kan is prefect!y with him, offering him his Service,' and all the Troops he could be Maher of. He, on his fide, wants not words of thanks and acknowledgments, nor a thoufand fair Pro- mi fes : But he was very cautious to receive him in his own name? he carried him pre- .fently and prefented him to Morad-Bakche, who, as we may ealily think, received him with open Arms Aureng-Zebe in the mean time congratulating and prailing Morad-bag- cbe, for having fought fo valiantly, and aferibing to him all the honour of the Victory i treating him with the title of King and Majeffy before Caiil-ullah-Kan, giving him un common refpedi:, and doing fubmildons to him becoming a Subject and Servant. In the interim, he labours night and day for himfelf, he writeth round about to all the Otn- rahs, making fure to day of one, and next day of another. Chab-hefir Kan, his Uncle, the great and old Enemy of Vara, by reafon of an Affront he had received from, him, did the fame for him on his part •, and as he is the Perfoa who writeth belt and fubril- left of the Empire of Indojiau, fo he contributed not a little by-his Cabals to the ad vancement of the Adairs of Aureng-Zebe, making ffrong Parties every where againft Vara. In the mean time let us dill obferve the artifice and diffimalation ot Aureng-Zebe,■ Nothing of what he doth, treateth, promifeth, is for himfelf, or in his own Name? he hath ff ill ( for foot h ) the defign of living as a Fabire : all is for Morad- Bakcbe, hs he that commands i Aureng-Zebe doth nothing i his Morad-Bak^be doth all, his he that is dcligned to be King. As for the unhappy Vara, becomes witly all fpeed to Agra, in a defperate condition, and not daring to go fee CM-ye/^;? 5 remembring,doubtkfs,thefe fevere words which he ' J letof the Empire o M O G kt fall, when he took leave of him before the Battel, viz. That he fhould remember not to come before him, if he were overcome. Yet, for all that, the good old Father fentfecretly a trufty Eunuch to him, to comfort him, to alfure him of the continuance of his affedtion, to declare to him his trouble for his misfortune, and to remonftrate to him, that the cafe was not yet defperate, conlidering that there was a good Army with Soliman Chekpuh, his Son, that he (hould go to Debli^ where he fliould find a thoufand Horfe in the Royal Stables} and that the Governor of the Fortrefs had Order to fur- nifli him with Money and Elephants-, for the reft, that he (hould not go further than he needs muft, that he would often write to hiila: And laftly, that he very well knew hovv to find out and chaftife Aurenge-Zebe. 1 have been informed, that Vara was then in fuch a confufion, and funk fo low, that he had not the power to anfwer a word to the Eunuch, nor the courage to fend any one to Chah-Jehan but that, after having fent feveral times to Begum-Saheb, his Sifter, he went away at midnight, taking with him his Wife, his Daughters, and his Grand child Sepc-Chchpuh) and that (which is almoft incredible ) he was attended with not above three or four hundred perfons. Let us leave him in his Voyage to Vehli, gnd ftay at Agra, to conlider the dexterity and craft, wherewith Aureng-Zebe proceeded to ma nage Affairs. He well knew, that Vara, and thofe of his Party, could yet place fome hopes in the vidorious Army of Soliman Chekpuh, and therefore he refolved to take it from him, or to make it ufelefs to him. To this end, he wrote Letters upon Letters to the Kaja Jffiigne, and to Velil-Kan, who were the chief Heads of the Army of Soliman Chekpuh, telling them, that there was no hope left for Vara and his Party } that he had loft the Battel, that his whole Army had fubmitted to him that all had abandon’d him i that he was fled alone towards Vehli that he could never efcape him, and that Orders were diftributed^ every where to feize on him. And as for Chah-Jehan, that he was in a con dition hopelefs of recovery , that they (hould take'good care of what they had to do * and if they were Men of underftanding, and would follow his fortune, and be his friends, they fhould feize on Soliman Chekguh, and bring him to him. Jeff eigne found himfelf perplexed enough, what he (hould do, (fill much apprehend ing and Vara, and more, to lay hands upon a Ptoyal Perfon, well know ing, that fome mifchief might therefore fall on him, fooner or later, even from Aureng- Zebe himfelf. Befides, he knew that Soliman Chekouh had too much courage to let himfelf be taken after that manner, and that he would rather die in defending of himfelf. Behold therefore, what he at laft refolved! Aftet having taken counfel with VelihKan, his great Friend, and after they had renewed to one another the Oath of mutual Fide lity, he went direddy to the Tent ,of Soliman Chekouh, who with great impatience ex- peded him, ( for he alfo had heard the News of the Defeat of Vara his father ) and had already divers times fent for him. To him he frankly difeovered all things, (hewed him the Letter of Aureng-Zebe, told him what courfe was beft for him to take, *£preferred to him the danger he was in i that there was noreafon he (liould truft in Ve- lil-Kan, or in Vaoud-Kan, or in ’the reft of his Army i but that, as foon as he could, he (hould gain the Mountains of Serenaguer , that that was the beft Expedient he could ta ke j that the Kaja of that Countrey being in unacceffible places, and not apprehen ding Aureng-Zebe, would doubtlefs receive him gladly *, and* for the reft, he would foon fee how things would go, and be always in a condition to come down from the Mountains, when he fhould think good. The young Prince underftood well enough by this kind of difeourfe, that there was po ground to truft henceforth in this Kaja, and that there was no more fafety for his Perfon * and that the rather, becaufe he knew that Velil-Kan was altogether devoted f o him, and he faw well enowgh, that there was a neceility to take this courle fuggeft- e d. Whereupon he foon commanded, that his Baggage (hould be put up to march to wards the Mountains. Some of his moft affectionate Friends, as a good number of hianfeb-Vars, of Sajeds, and others, put themfelves in order to attend him 5 the reft of the Army, altogether aftonhhed, remain’d with the Kaja. But that, which was ve ry mean for a great Kaja, and a very fordid barbaroufnefs, was, that he and Velil-Kan f nt under hand fome to fall upon his Baggage, who alfo took other things, and among ffem an Elephant laden with Rupies ot Gold, which caufed a great diforder among thofe fmall Troops that followed him', and which was anoccafion, that many of them D 2 &gt; returned ) / .i.20 Tbe : H/(lory of the Late Revolution return’d andabandon’d him •&gt; and invited alfothe Country-people to fet upon his Men' pillaging them, and even killing Tome of them : Yet he made a fnift to gain the Moun tains, with his Wife and Children, where the Raja of Serenaguer received him with all the honour and civilities he could ddire, alluring him, that he was in fafety, as much as if he were King of that Countrey, and that he would proted and allill him with all his Forces. In the mean time, behold what hapned on Agra's lide. Three or four days after the Battel of Sarnongmr, the Vi&amp;orious Among- Zebe, toge ther with Morad-Rakche, came diredly to the Gate of the Town into a Garden, which may be a little League diltent from the Fortrefs, and fent from thence an able Eunuch and one of thofe whom he moll confided in, to Cbab-Jehan, to falute him with a thou- fand fair Protellations of his afFedion and fubmiffion i that he was exceedingly ferry for what had palLed, and for having been obliged, by reafon of the ambition and evil de- figns of Vara, to proceed to all thofe extremities i that, for the rdf, he rejoyced ex tremely to hear, that he began to find himfelf better, and that he was come thither for no other end than to receive his Commands. Cbah-Jehan was not wanting to ex* prefs to the Eunuch much fatisfadtion, as to the proceedings of Aureng-Zebe, and to receive the SubmiHions of this Son with all poilible appearances of joy i though lie faw very well, that matters had been carried too far, and fufficiently knew the referved and crafty humour of Aunng-Zebe, and his fecret pailion for Reigning j and that there fore he was not much to be trufled, for all his fair words- And yet notwithfianding he fuffers himfelf to be circumvented, and inliead of playing the fureft Chart, by ufing his utmoft power, by birring, by appearing, by caufing himfelf to be carried through the Town, and by affembling all his Omrabs, (for it was yet time to do all this) he goes about to outwit Aureng-Zebe, him that was his Crafts-Mafkr, and attempts to draw him into a fnare, wherein he will be found taken himfelf. He then fends alfo an Eunuch to this Son, to let him know, that he well underflood the ill condudl, and even the incapacity of Vara ', that he could not but call to mind the particular inclina tion he always had and exprefTed towards him, that he could not doubt of his affedionj and laflly, that hefhould come to fee him, and to advife with him what was fit to be done in thefe diforders •» and that he pallionately wifhed to embrace him. Attreng^Zebe-, on his fide, faw alfo well enough, that he was not to trufl too much to the words of Cbab-Jeban, knowing efpecially, that Begum-Sahob, his Enemy as well as Sifter, was night and day about him, and that 5 twas very probable, he adted nothing but by her motion. And he apprehended, that if he fhould come into the Fortrefs, he might be feized on, and ill-treated i as it wasfaid, that the refolution was indeed taken to do fo, and feveral of thofe lufty Tartarian Women, which ferve in the Seraglio, were armed to fet upon him as foon as he fhould enter. Whatever it be,he would never hazard himfelf, and yet fpread a rumour abroad, that the next day he would go to fee his Father Cbab-Jeban. But when the day was come, he put it off till another, and fo he delayed it from day to day, without ever making the Vifit. In the mean time he continued his fecret Negotiations and Cabals, and founded the mind of all the greateft Omrabs, fo far, that at lab, after he had well and clofely laid his Defign, and politickly difpofed all things for the fuccefs thereof, all were amazed to fee, that one day, when he had fent Sultan Mahmoud, his eldeb Son, to the Fortrefs, under a pretence of feeing Chah-Jehan in his name i this young Prince, bold and undertaking, falls prefently on the Guards that were at the Gate, and vigorouily driveth all before him, whilb a great number of Men appointed, who were there all ready, did enter with fury, and made themfelves Mabersof the Walls. If ever a man was abonifhed, Cbab-Jeban was, feeing that he was fallen into the fnare which he Had prepared for others, that himfelf was imprifoned and Aurenge-Zebe Maberof the Fortrefs. Tis faid, that he prefently fent to found the mind of Sultan Mahmoud, promifing him upon his Crown and upon the Alcoran, that if he would be faithful to him, and ferve him in this conjundure, he would make him King i that he fhould come prefently to fee him within, and not lofe this occafion: Befides, that it would be an adion that would accumulate on him the bleftings of Heaven, and an im- mortal Glory * in regard it would be faid for ever, thit Sultan Mahmoud hid delivered Cbab-Jeban his Grandfather out of Prifon. And certainly, if Sultan Mahmoud had been refolute enough to give this broke, and Chab-Jehan could have come abroad to blew hiiufelf to the Town, and to take the Field, noof the Emfire of the M O G O L. no man doubts, but all his great Omrahs would have followed him &gt; nor would An- reng-Zebe himfelf have had the boldnefs nor the favagenefs to fight againif his own Father in Perfon, efpecially fince he mull have apprehended, that all the world would have abandon’d him, and poffibly Morad-Baiqhe himfelf. And ’tis indeed the great fault which Chah-Jeban is obferved to have committed after the Battel, and*' the flight of Vara, not to have come out of the Fortrefs. But yet I have converfed with many, who maintained that Cbah-Jehan did prudently in it. For this hath been a queftion much agitated among the Politicians, and there are no reafons wanting to countenance the Sentiment of the latter fort j who alfo add, that Men almolf always judge of things by the Event &gt; that often very foolifli Enterprifes have been obfer ved to fucceed&gt; and which therefore are approved by all» that if Chah-Jeban had profpered in his deilgn, he would have been efteemed the moil prudent and the molt able Man in the World * but now being taken, he was nothing but a good old Man that fuffer’d himfelf to be led by a Woman, his Daughter Begum ■ which was blind ed by her pailion, and had the vanity to believe,- that Aureng-Zebe would come to fee her, that the Bird of it felf would fly into the Gage, or at leaf, that he would never be fo bold as to attempt the feifure of the Fortrefs, nor have the power to do fo. Thefe fame Reafoners maintaining alfo ftifiy, that the greatefl fault that Sultan Mahmoud could poflibly commit, was, that he knew not how to take the occafion to allure himfelf of the Crown, by the rarefl and the moft generous A&amp;ion that ever was to put his Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do himfelf Right and Jultice, as the So- veraign Umpire of Affairs j whereas, as things now Hand, he mull one day go and dye in Goualeor. But Sultan Mahmoud (whether it was that he feared his Grandfa ther would not keep his word with him, or that he fhould be himfelf detained with in, or that he durlt not play tricks with his Father Aureng-Zehe)vjo\x\d. never hearken to anything, nor enter into the Apartment of Chab-Johan, anfwering very clofely, that he had no order from his Father to go and fee him, but that he was by him com manded not to return, without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortrefs, that fo he might come with all fafety to kifs the Feet of his Majefly. There palled almoft two whole days before he could refolve to furrender the Keys', during which time, Sultan Mahmoud ftaid there, unalterable in his refolutions, keeping himfelf up on his Guard night and day, with all his Troops about him, till at length Chab- Jehan, feeing that all his people that were upon the Guard at the little Gate, little by little disbanded, and that there was no more fafety on his fide, gave him the Keys, with an order to tell Aureng-Zebe, that he Ihould come prefently if he were wife, and that he had moft important things to difeourfe with him about. But Aureng-Zebc was too cunning to commit fo grofs a fault: On the contrary, he made his Eunuch BLtbarkan Governor of the Fortrefs, who prefently (hut up Chah-Jehan, together with Bcgum-Saheh, and all his Women j cauling divers Gates to be walled up, that fo he might not be able to write or fpeak to any body, nor go forth out of his Apartment without permiftion. Aureng-Zebe in the mean time writ to him a little Note, which he (hewed to every body before he fealed itin which, among other things, he told him with dry expreft- iions, that he knew from good hands, that notwithftanding thofe great proteftations of efteem and aifedfion hqmade to him, and of contempt he made of Vara, he had, (or all that, fent to Vara two Elephants charged with Rupies of Gold, to raife him again, and to re-commence the Wan and that therefore, in truth, it was not he that imprifoned him, but Vara, and that he might thank him for it, as the caufe of all thefe misfortunes, and if it had not been for him, he would have come the very ftrft day to him, and paid him all the moft dutiful refpedts he could have looked for from a good Son: That, for the reft, he begged his pardon, and a little patiencev as foon as he fliould have difenabled Vara from executing his evil defigns, he would come him felf and open the Gates to him. ' 1 have heard it faid concerning this Note, that Chah-Jehan in very deed, the fame night that Vara departed, had fent to him thefe Elephants laden with Rupies of Gold, and that it was Rauchenara-Begum that found a way to difeover it to Aureng-Zebe as (he alio had deteifed to him that Plot, which was laid againft him with thofe Tarta rian Women ^ and that Aureng-Zebe himfelf had intercepted fome Letters of Chah-Je han to Varai l have1 he Hifloryof the Late Revolution l have converfed with others, that maintain there is no fuch thing, and that this Writing, whkh Aimng-Zebe ihewed to all, was only to call Sand into the Eyes of the People, and to labour, in fome degree, to juftifie himfclf in fo hrange an action and to devolve the Caufe of it upon Cbah-Jehan and Vara, as if he had°been forced to fuch proceedings. They are things, which are difficult enough well to difcover. However it be, as foon as Cbab-Jehan was (hut up, almoll all the Omrabs were in a manner necellitated to go and make their Court to Aureng-Xebe and Morad-Bakche ■ and (which isalmoft incredible) there was not one that had the Courage toflir or to attempt the lead in the behalf of his King, and for him that had made then) 5 what they were, and raifed them from the dud, and perhaps from flavery it fclf ( which is ordinary enough in that Court ) to advance them to Riches and Honour. Yet fome few there are, as Vanecbmend-Kan, and fome others, that took no fidei but all thp rdf declared for Aureng-Zebe. 5 1 is notwithdandingto be noted what I faid, that they were necdbtated to do what they did. For kis not in the Indies, as in France, or other States of Chrijhndcm where the Grandees and Nobles have large Poffidlions of Land, and great Revenues’ which enables them for a while to fubfiit of themfdvqs. There they have nothingbut Penlions ( as 1 have already touched above ) which the King can take away from them at all hours, and thus ruin them in an infrant i fo that they (hall be coniidered no more than if they never had been, nor have any credit to borrow a farthing. Axreng-Zehe therefore having thus affured himfelf of Chab-Jehan, and of all the Omrabs, took what Sums of Money he thought fit out of the Treafury j and then ha ving left Cbab-beft-Kan, his Unde, Governor of the Town, he went away with Mj- rad- Bakcbe to putfue Vara. f 1 day that the Army was to march out of Agra the particular Friends of Morad-Bd- c»e, efpeeially his Eunuch Chah-Abas, who knew, that the excefs of civility and reffied F ordinarily a iign of impohure,counfclIed him, that fmee he was King,and everybo dy treated him with the Title of Majeffy, and Anreng-Zcbe himfelf acknowledged him for fuch, he fhould let him go to purfue Vara, and flay himfejf with his Troops about Agra and Vebli. If he had followed thiscounfel, kis certain, that he Would have em- baraffed Aareng-Zebe not a little^ but kwap fatal, that he ffiouldnegledfo good advice: Aureng-Zebe is too fortunate i Marad-Bakche entirely conhdeth in his promifes, and in the Oaths of Fidelity they had fvvorn to one another upon the Alcoran. They went away together, and went with the fame pace towards Vebli. ^ When they were come to Mantras, three or four fmall days Journey from Agrajhz friends of Morad-Bakche, who perceived fomething, endeavoured again to peifwade him, that he fhould beware •, affiuring him that had evil dcflgns, and that beyond all doubt fome mifehief was upon the Anvil i that they had notice of it from all parts, and that by no means, for that day at kail, he ffiould go to fee him i that it would be much better to prevent this ftroke the fooneff it might be i that he was only to forbear going to viiit him that day, excuhng himfelf with fome Indifpolkion. But whatfoever could be faid to him. he believed nothing of it,his Ears were hopped to all the good advice that was given him, and as if he had been enchanted by the friend- ffisp of Attreng-Zcbe, he emid not hold to go to him that very night, and to Hay at bupper with him. As foon as he was come, Attreng- Zebe,who expe(Ted him.and had al ready prepared all things with Mirkan, and three or four of his moftfindmate Cap- tains, was not wanting in embracemcnts, and in redoubling his Courtffijp, Civilities u Y miffions ’ infomuch as g enI:1 y topafs his hankerchief over his face, and to wipe oil his fweat andduft, treating him hill with the title of King and Mljehy, In the mean time the Table is ferved, they fup, the converfation grows warrffi they difeourfe or various things as they ufe to do i and at laft there is brought a huge- 1 Bottle of ex- cchent Chiras Wine, and fome other Bottles of Caboul Wine, for a DeSauch. Then ttreng- ebe, as a grave ferious Man, and one that would appear a great Mahumetan, T/ V a r v nimb] y rirerh fom Table, and having with much kindnefs invited Morad-Batybe, wno loved a Glafs of Wine very well, and who rclifhed the Wine V at l as cr ^ c ^ fcrupled not to drink of it to excefs. In a.word, he made himfelf _ ruii 3 5 1 '. fr j a “ cc P* was the thingthat was wifhed i for prefently LomeSer- S i liS were there 5 were commanded away, under a pretence, to let him C ' C P Witn o ut - n ' afi h)g any noife &gt; and then his Zable and Ponyard were taken from. about( of the Empire of the M O G O L. ; 2^ about him: But Annng-Zebe was not long, but camehimfelf and wakened him. He' entred into the Chamberj and roughly hit him with his foot, and when he began to open a little his Eyes, he made to him this (hort and furpriting Reprimand : What means this, [aid he. What (hame and what ignominy is this, that fuch a King as you are, ihould have fo little temper, as thus to make himfelf drunk ? What will be laid both of you and me ? Take this infamous Man, this Drunkard, tye him hand and foot, and throw him into that room tolleep out his Wine. No fooner faid, but it was executed &gt; notwithftanding all his appeal and out-cry, five or lix perfons fall up- * on him, and fetter his hands and feet. The things could not be done, but fottie of , his Men that were thereabout had news of it. They made fome noife, and would enter forcibly &gt; but AUah-Qouly, one of his chief Officers, and the Mafier of his Ar tillery, that had been gained long before, threa.tned them, and made them-draw back. Without any delay, Men were fent through the whole Army to calm this hrft Commotion, which alfo might have proved dangerous i they made them believe it was nothing, they having been prefent,that Morad-Bakche was only drunk, that in that’ condition he had railed at every body, and Aunng-Zebe himfelf, infomuch that there had been a neceffity, feeing him drunk and furious, to keep him apart 5 that the next day they would fee him abroad, after he had digefted his Wine. • In the mean time, the Prefents walked about all night amongft the chief Officers of the Army, their Pay was forthwith encreafed, they had great Promifes made them 5 and as there was none, that had not long tince apprehended fome fuch thing, there was no great won der to fee almoll all things quieted the next morning *, fo that the very next night this poor Prince was (hut up in a little clofe houfe, fuch an one as is wont to be placed on Elephants to carry Women, and he was carried direcffly to Vehli into Slimager, which is a little old Fortrefs in the midft of the Puver. After that all was thus appeafed, except the Eunuch Chah-Abas, who caufed diffi culty enough, Aureng-Zebe received the whole Army of Morad-Bakpbe into his Service, and went after Vara, who marched apace towards Labor, with an intention well to fortifie himfelf in that place, and thither to draw his Friends. But Aunng-Zebe fol lowed him with fo much fpeed, that he had not time to do any great matter, finding himfeif neceffitated to retreat, and to take the way of Multan, where alfo he could do nothing coniiderable, becaufe that Aunng-Zebe, notwithlfanding the great heat, marched night and day i infomuch, that to encourage all to make haite, he fometimes advanced almoif all alone two or three Leagues before the whole Army, finding him felf often obliged to drink ill water like others, to be content with a cruft of dry bread, and to fleep under a Tree, ftayingfor his Army in the midft of the high-way, laying his head on his Shield like a common Souldier. So that Vara found himfelf conftrain- ed to abandon Multan alfo, that he might avoid being near Aureng-Zebe, whom he was,not able to encounter. Here 3 tis that the Statefmen of this Gountrey have rea- foned very diverfiy: For ftis faid,that if Vara, when he went out of Labored calf him- fdf into the Kingdom Cabml, as he was advifed, he would there have found above ten thoufand warlick Men, defigned againft the Augans, the Perfians, and the Vsbecs, and for a Guard to that Countrey, the Governor whereof was Mobabet-Kan, one of the moll potenj and the moft ancient of Indojian, and that had never been Aumig-Zebe's Friend i that, befides, he would have been there at the Gate of Perfia zndVsbecb that he waslikely, that there being no want of Money, all that Militia and Mobabet-Kan himfelf, would have embraced his Party &gt; and that further, he might have drawn aftiftance, not only from Vsbec, but alfo from Perfia, as well as from Hou- mayon, whom the Perfians had reftored to his Country againft Zaher-Kan, King of the Patans, who had driven him thence. But Vara was too unfortunate to follow fo good advice. Inftead of that he went towatds Scimdv, to caft himfelf into the For trefs of Tatabakgr, that ftrong and famous place, feated in the midft of the River Indus. Aureng-Zebe feeing him take this way, found it not fit to follow him further off, being extremely glad that he had not taken the way to Caboul. He contented him- fdf to fend after him feven or eight thoufand Men, under the Gondudf of Mir-baba, his Fofter-brother, and turned bacK with the fame expedition to the place whence he was come, much apprehending left any thing fhould fall out about Agra \ left fome , other of tiiofe potent Rajah/s, as Jffitgne. or jeffomfeigne, fhould make'an attemptof the Empire of the M O G O L. * 25 he was fufficiently perplexed and troubled, not knowing which way to turn. At laft he believed it beft to leave Vara for a time quiet where he was, and to go thither where his prefence and Army was moft neceflaiy, which was towards Sultan Sujah i who had already paffed the Pviver Ganges at Elabas. This Sultan Sujab was come to encamp in a little Village called Cadjoue, and had conveniently feized himfelf of a great c falab j or Refervatory of Water, which is there in the way i and Avreng-Zebe came to place himfelf on the fide of a fmall Torrent, at the difiance of a mile and an half from thence, on Agra's fide. Between both was a very fair Campagne, very proper for a Battel. Aureng-Zebe was no fooner arrived, but be ing impatient to end this War, at break of day he went to face Sufah, leaving his Baggage on the other fide of the Torrent. He fell upon Sujab with an effort unima ginable. Emir-Jemla^ Prifoner of Vecan, and who arrived juft on the day of the Combat, fearing Vara no more,becaufe his Family Was more in fafety, did there alfo layout all his force, courage, and dexterity. But feeing that Sultan Sujab had well fortified himfelf, and was accompanied with a very good Artillery, advantageoufly placed, it was not poffible for Aureng-Zebe to force him, nor to make him retreat from thence, fo as to make him lofe thofe Waters. On the contrary, he was obliged him felf to draw back feveral times, fo vigoroufly was he repulfed, infomuch that he found himfelf in great perplexity. Sultan Sujab not being willing to advance too far into the Campagne, nor to remove from that advantagious place where he was, pretending only to defend himfelf, which was very prudently done. For he forefaw, that Aureng- Zebe could not ftay there long, and that in that hot feafon he would be abfolutely obli-' ged to turn back towards the Torrent for the W^ater ^ and that, when he ftiould do fo he would fall upon his Rear, Aureng-Zebe alfo forefaw well enough the fame thing, and that was the reafon why he was fo forward and preffingi but behold another more troublefome accident. In this very time he receiveth intelligence, that the Raja Jeffomfeighe, who in ap pearance had accommodated himfelf with him, was fallen upon his Rear, and plun- dred his Baggage and Treafure. This News afionifhed him much, and the more, be- caufe he perceived that his Army which had heard of it was thereby frighted, and fal len into diforder. Yet he lofes not his judgment for all this j and being well aware, that to turn back was to hazard all, he refolved, as in the Battle of Vara^ to bear up the beft he could, and to expedf with a fteady foot all Events. In the mean time, the diforder grew worfe and worfe in his Army: Sujab, who was refolved to profit of the occafion, taketh his time , and preffeth him vigoroufly. He that led Anreng- Zebe's Elephant is killed with the foot of an Arrow •, he leads the Beaft as well as he can himfelf, till another could be had in that Leaders place; Arrows rain upon him*, he returns many himfelf, his Elephant begins to be frighted, and to go back. Behold him now in great extremity, and brought to that point, that one foot of his was out of the feat, as if he meant to caft himfelf to the ground, and no man knows what in that trouble he had not done, if Emir-Jemla^ being nigh, and performing like a great Man as he was, beyond imagination, called to him, in holding up his hand 10 j touted, and take flight, like Vara, to fave his life : Aureng-Zebe muft remain Victori ous, carry away the Bell, and bd King of the Indies. Vecan-kju^ Vecari-hou, where is Vecan ? This feems to have been the greateft extremi ty, to which Anreng-Zebe could he reduced. One would have faid&gt; ’twas now and here that Fortune had abandon’d him, and there is almoft no appearance of a poilibi- lity to efcape. But his good Fortune is ftronger than all that: Sultan Sujah muft be \ had employed towards Vara i though there were fome who believed, that there was We are to remember the Battel of Samonguer, and trance, flight ac cident which ruined Vara: 5 Tis the fame over-fight, or rather the fame 1 reafon, which is now deftroying Sultan Sujib. One of his chief Captains* Allab-verdi-Kan^ who (as fome fay J had been gained, ufeth the fame Artifice that Caliltillab-Ran no malice in the cafe, and that it was a meer piece of Flattery. For feeing that the ^Hole Army of Aureng-Zebe was in diforder, he ran towards Sultan Sujabj telling him the fame thing, that Calil-ullab Kan did to Vara^ and begging of him with fol ded hands, that he would flay no longer in fo great danger upon his Elephant. Come down, [aid be, in the name of God, mount on Horfe-back, God hath made you So vereign of the Indies^ let us purfue thofe Fugitives, let not Aureng-Zebe efcape us.'iS the Hifiory of the Late Revolution But not to flay long from declaring the ftrange Fortune of Aureng-Zebe, and the in credible conjuncture that recovers his defperate condition •&gt; Sultan Sujah,not more con- iiderate than Vara,, commits the fame Fault i and he was no fooner come down from his Elephant, but his Army feeing him no more,was ftruck with a terror,believing there was Treafon, and that he was either taken or (lain. Whereupon they disbanded,with out any more ado, as Varans Army did in the Battel of Sawonguer j and the Defeat was fo great, that the Sultan was fortunate in that he could fave himfelf. Jejfomfeigne hearing this unexpe&amp;ed News, and perceiving it was not very fafe for him to tarry there, contented himfelf with the Spoil he had got, and with all diligence marched (freight toAgra^ thence to pafs to his Countrey. The noife was already in Agra &gt; that Aureng-Zebe had loft the Battel &gt; that he was taken, together with Etnir- Jemla, and that Sultan-Suyah brought them both Prifoners. Infomuch, that &lt;M- hejl-Kan, who was Governor of the Town, and Uncle to Aureng-Zebe, feeing Jejfom feigne, whofe Treachery he had heard of, at the Gates, and defpairingof his Life, had taken into his hand a Cup o( Poyfon to make himfelf away, and had, as they lay, in very deed fwallowed it, if his Women had not fallen upon him, and hindred him: So that ’tis thought, if Jeffomfeigne had had the wit and courage to ftay longer in Agra, if he had threatned boldly, and promifed and aefted vigoroufly for the freedom of Chah-fehan, he might have drawn him out of Prifon i fo much the more eatily , be- caufe all Agra was for two whole days in that belief, that Aureng-Zebe was overcome. But Jejfomfeigne, who knew how all thipgs went, and who durft not long ftay there,nor attempt any thing, did nothing but pafs, returning with all fpeed homewards. Aureng-Zebe, who apprehended mifehief from Agra , and fear’d left Jejfomfeigne (hould undertake fomething for Cbab-Jeban, was not long in the purfuit after Sultan Sujab i he turn’d fhort for Agra with his whole Army, where he ftay’d a good while, giving order for all things. Mean time he received intelligence, that Sultan Sujab had not loft many Men in his being routed, for want of farther purfuit j that alfo from the Lands of the Rajas, which are in thofequarters,on the right and left of Ganges, he raifed great Forces, upon the fcore of the reputation he had of being very rich, and very liberal, and that he fortified himfelf in Elabas, that important and famous Paffage of Ganges, which, with its Fortrefs, is the firft In-let intoEengak, And then he con- (idered alfo, that he had about him two Perfons, which indeed were very capable to ferve him, Sultan Mahmoud his eldeft Son, and Emir-Jemlas but he well knew , that thofe who have done good fervice to their Prince, grow often infolent, in the belief, that all is due to them, and that they cannot be recompenced enough. He perceived already, that the former of them began very much to emancipate himfelt, and that every day he became more arrogant, for having feized on the Fortrefs of Agra, and by that means had broken all the Defigns which Chab-Jeban could have formed. Ana as to the latter, he knew indeed the torce of his Underftanding, his Condud, and Va lour*, but that was the very thing which made him apprehend him the more: for knowing that he was very rich, that his Reputation was great, that he pafted for the Firfi Hewer in Affairs, and for the ableft Man in all the Indies, he doubted not, but that after the Example of Sultan Mahmoud, he entertain’d himfelf with big hopes. All this certainly would have been able to perplex an ordinary Spirit, but Aureng-Zebe found a Remedy to all. He knew to remove them both with fo much prudence, and even with fo much handfomnefs, that neither of them found any caufe to complain of if. ffcfoit them both againft Sultan Sujab with a puiffant Army, lettingfecret- lyknow, that the Government of Bengale, which is the belt quarter of Indojlan, was defign’d for him, to hold it during his life, and for his Son after his deceafe, and that thereby he would begin to exprefs to him his acknowledgments for the great Services he had done himj* and that therefore it belonged only to him to defeat Sujab, and that as foon as he {hould have compaffed it, he would make him Mir-ul Omrabs, which is the firft and the moft honourable place of Indojlan, and no lefs than the Prince ot the Omrabs. To Sultan Mahmoud his Son, he faid only thefe few words: Remember that thou art the Eldtjl of my Children, that 'tis for thy felf thou goefl forth to fight *, that thouhafi done much, but yet nothing, if thou overcomejl not Sujah, who is onr greatejl and fowerfulkjl Ene my *, I hope, God ajfijling me, to be foon Majler of the rejh # . With thefe words he difmiifed them both, with ordinary Honours, that is, with richof the Empire of the M O G O L. rich Verts fome Horfcs and Elephants gallantly harnelTed ; making in the mean time ILmir-jernU to confent, that his only Son, Mahmet Emir-Kan, Qiould hay with him for a good Educatjon, or rather for a Pledge of his Fidelity &gt; and Suit an MahmoudAhu his Wife fhould remain mAgra ( which was the Daughter of the above-mendon’d King of Golhnnda J as too troublefom a thing in an Army, and in fuch an Expedition. Sultan Snjah who was always in the apprehenfion , left the Ramf of the lower Bengale which he had ill treated, fticuld be raifed againft him, and who feared nothing more than to have to do wuhErnir-Jemlaj had no fooner received this News but ao? prehending that the paftage to Bengale would be obftru^ed, and that Emir would pafs in fome other place the Puver Ganges, either lower or higher than Elabas raifed his Gamp, and went down to Benares and Patna, whence he betook himfelf to Mogiere, a r i 1 own feated upon the Ganges, a place commonly call’d the Key of the Kingdom 0 being a kind of Streight between the Mountains and the Woods, which are not far from thence. He thought fit to ftay in that place,and there to fortihe himfelf; and for greater fafety, he caufed a great I rench to be made, which I have feem pafiino- that way fome years after, from the Town and River unto the Mountain, being well retolved there to attend Emir-Jemla, and to difpute that paffage with him. But he was fufficiently aftonifh’d, when he was told, that the Troops of Emir, which flowly deicended along the River Ganges, were certainly for nothing but to amufe him i tha t taielf was not there } that he had gained the Raja's of thofe Mountains,which are on t e right hand of the River &gt; and that he and Sultan Mahmoud marchtd apace over their Lands with all the Flower of the Army, drawing ftraight to Rage-Mehalle, to in tercept him: So that he was conftrained to quit, as foon as he could,hisFortificationsi yetnotwithftandinghe made fo much hafte, that though he was obliged to follow thole windings, which the River Ganges on that fide maketh towards the left hand, he prevented Emir by fome days, and arrived firft at where he had time 5 to tortihe himfelf •, becaufe Emir having heard this News, took his March to the left hand towards Ganges, through very ill ways, there to exped: his Troops, which came down with the Body of the Artillery and theBaggage along the Pviver. As foon as all was come, he wenttoattaque Sultan Sujah, who defended himfelf very well for five or fix ays , but feeing that the Artillery of Emir, which played inceffantly, ruined all his ortihcations, which were made but of fandy Earth and Fagots, and that he could not ut with much difficulty make refiftance in that place, befides that the Seafon of the am began, he retired himfelf, at the favour of the Night, leaving behind two great eeces of Cannon. Emir durft not follow him in the night, for fear of fome Ambuffi, putting oft the purfuit ’dll the next morning: But Sujah had the good luck, that at the teak of day there began to fall aPvain, which lafted above three days } fo that Emir cou d not only ftir out of Rage-Mehalle, but faw himfelf obliged to pafs the Winter lere, by reafon of the exceflive Rains in that Countrey, which render the ways fo toublefom for more than four Months, viz.

And hereby Sultan Sujah had the means to retire nmclf, and to chufe what place he would, having time enough to fortifie his Army, j*ud to fend out of the inferiour Bengale for many Peeces of Cannon, and a good num- r Cr , 0 f^ ortu ^G that were retired thither, becaufe of the great fertility of the Coun- re y* ^ or h e inuch courted all thofe Portugal Fathers, Miftionaries, that are in that Pro duce, promilmg them no lefs than that he would make them all rich, and build Chur- nes for them wherefoever they would. And they were indeed capable to ferve him, it u ng certain, that in the Kingdom of Bengale there are to be found no lefs than eight Mefficks Th ° U ^ nC * FamiIies Frau &amp; ms ■&gt; Portugals , and thefe either Natives or ftt Sultan Mahmoud, who, for the reafon above-mentioned, was grown fierce,and - pued, perhaps, to greater things than at that time he ought, did pretend to command me Army abfolutely, and that Emir-Jemla ffiould follow his Orders, letting alfo from jj rn j t0 ^me fail infolent words in reference to his F ather Aureng-Zebe, as if he were ob- £ gCd ^ hlm for the Crown, and uttering Expreffions of Contempt and Threat againft whT' cau fod great eoldnefs betwixt them two, which lafted a pretty me, untd Sultan Mahmoud underftood, that his Father was very much diffatisfied ^ lt is conduct: And apprehending, left Emir had order to feize on his perfon, he mt away to Sultan Sujah, accompanied with a very fmall number, and to him he E 2 ' ! made28 The Ht (lory of the Late Revolution made great promiCes, and fwore Fidelity. But Sujab, who feared Auren^Zebezud Emir- fcmlTs fnares, could not truft him, having always an Eyj upon his Ad ions, wTthout giving him any confiderable Commands which he fo difgufted, that tor^ months after, not knowing what would become of him, he left Sultan Sujab and re- turned to Ewir, who received him well enough, alluring him, that he would write in his behalf to Aunng-Zebe, and do his utmoll to make him forget that fault. I think fit here to take notice, on the by, of what many have told mz viz. That this Efcapc of Sultan Mahmoud was altogether made by the Artifices of Auren^Zebe, who cared not much to hazard this Son of his to try to deffroy ^, and who was glad enough, that whatever the Event were, he might have a fpecious pretence to put him in a place of furety. However it be, he afterwards fhewM hunfelf much diffatif- bed with him, and wrote to him a fevere Letter, in which he enjoin d him to return to Vehli, but giving order in the mean time, that he fhould not tar. tor he no fooner had paffed the River Ganges, hut he met with Troops that ftopthim, and put him up in a fmall Chair, C as was done to Morad-Bakph J and carried him to Gouakor, whence ’tis thought he will never be fet at liberty : Aureng-Zebe by this means freeing himfetf from great perplexity •, who then alfo let his fecond Son, Suit an Mtzum, know, that the point of Reigning is fo delicate a thing, that Kings muft be jealous even of their own fhadow i adding, that if he be not difcreet, the like may befall him what had befallen his Brother, and that he ought to thmkAurmg-Zebe was not a Man, that would fuffer that to be done to himfelf, what Cbahjekan did toms Father jam- Guyre, and what he had alfo lately feen done to Chah-Jeham - ^ . And indeed we may on this occafion fay, that if this Son continue to behave him felf as he hath done hitherto, Aureng-Zebe will have no caufeto fufped him, and ro be diffatished with him: For noSlavecanbe more tradable, and Aureng-Zebe hme never appear’d more carelefs of Greatnefs, nor more given to Devotion than he: let 1 have known Men of Parts, who believed, that he is not fo in good earnu , at } u perlative policy and craft, like that of his Father, which we may have the prooi o in Whilft all thefe things were thus tranfaded in Bengale, and that Sultan Sujab xMd the heft he could the Forces of Emir-Jemla, palling now on one fide °t the River Ganges, of a Channel, or fome other River, ( for thatCountrey is full of them; t en on the other i Aureng-Zebe kept himfelf about Agra, going to andtro i and at ieugt , after he had alfo fent to Goualeor, he came to Debit, where in goo ear neft he took upon him publickly to ad the King, giving order for all Affairs ot the Kingdom, and efpecially thinking on means to catch Dara, and to get him out ot -u- zarutte, which was a very hard thing, for the Reafons already mentioned. ut tne great good Fortune, and the lingular dexterity of Aureng-Zebe foondrew himtnencc, which now follows next to be related. . c jejfomfeigne, who had retired himfelf to his Countrey, and made the beftot wnac he had taken in the Battel of Kadjoue, raifed a ftrong Army, and wrote to Vara, uat he (houldcometo Agra as foon as he could, and that he would join with his r orces. Vara, who had by tjiis time fet on foot a pretty numerous Army, ( though it conlil c , for the moll: part, but of gathered people J and who hoped, that approacniog to -• gra, many of his old Friends, feeing him with Jeffomfeigne, wouldmot fail to join wit him alfo, immediately leaveth Amadevad, and marcheth with great fpeed to^ pnm, feven or eight days journey from Agra. But jejfomfeigne kept not his word with !m * The Ka)a Jeffeigne interpoied to make his peace with Aureng-Zebe, and to fallen nim to his Party, or, at leaft, to hinder his defign, which was capable to ruinehimieit, an to make all the Raja's rife j and wrote to him feveral Letters, giving him to under an the great danger he went to expofe himfelf to, by efpoufmg a Party in that Extrem ty as that of Varas was i that he fhould well confider what he was going to do, t a he 5 went about wholly to deftroy himfelf, and all his whole Family S that Aureng- would never forgive him \ that he was a Raja as himfelf i that he fhould thin a on pa ring the blood of the Ragipous b that if he thought to draw the Raja's to his ^ h he would find thofe that would hinder him from it. In a word, that it was a u in , which concern’d all the Gentry of tndojan, and excofed them to danger, if wf J given to kindle a Fire, which would not be extinguifb’d at pleafure. And lamyV ^ would leave Vara to himfelf, Aureng-Zebe would forget ail that had palled, an P ^2 of the Empire of the M O G O L. fent him with all he had taken, and give him that very inftant the Government of Guzaratte, which would be very convenient for him, that Gountrcy being near his Lands ? that he could be there fn full liberty and fafety, and as long as he pleafed, and that himfelf would be Caution for all. In a word, this RajazdLcd his part fo well, that he made return to his Land, whWR Aureng-Zebe approached with his whole Army to Afmire, and encamped in the fight of that of Vara, And now what could this poor Prince Vara do ? He feeth himfelf abandoned, and fruftrated of his hopes. He confiders, that to turn back fafe to Amadevad was impof- fible in regard that it was a March of Thirty and five days i that it was in the heat of Summer j that water would fail him i that they were all the Lands of Raja’s5 Friends or Allies of Jejfeigne or Jeffomf eigne *, that the Army of Aureng-Zebe , which was not harafled like his, would not. fail to follow him. ’Eis as good ^ faith he, to perifh here j and although the Match be altogether unequal, let us venture all, and give Bat tel once mere. But alas ! what does he mean to do ? He is not only abandoned by all, but he hath yet with him Chah-Navaze-Kan, whom he trulls, and who betrays him, and difcovers all his Defigns to 3 Tis true, that Chah-Navaze-Kan was punilh’d for his Perfidioufnefs&gt; and kill’d in the Battel i whether it was by the hands of Vara himfelf, as many told me, or ( which is more probable J by fomeof Au- nng-Ztbe’s Army, who being fecret Partifans of Vara, found means to get to him,and to difpatch him, fearing left he fhould difcover them, and have fome knowledge of the Letters they had written to Vara. But what did it benefit him at that time,that Chal&gt; Navaze-Kan was dead ? Vara fhould have fooner follow’d the advice of his Friends, and never have confided in him. , . The Fight began between Nine and Ten of the Clock in the morning: Vara s Ar tillery, which was very well placed on a little Eminency, was loud enough i but, a? was faid, moft of the Peeces without Bullets i fo was he betray’d by all 1 J Tis needlefs to relateW other Particulars of this Battel &gt; it wa? properly not a Battel, but a Rout. I fhall only fay, that hardly the Onfet was begun, but Jejfeigne was near and in light of Vara, to whom he fent word, that he fhould flie prefently, unlefs he would be ta ken. So that this poor Prince, being altogether furprifed, was conffrained to run away inftantly, and with fo much diforder and precipitation, that he had not leifure to put up his Baggage. It was no fmall matter, that he was able to get away witn his Wife, and the reft of his Family. And’tis certain, that if the Raja- Jejfeigne would have done what he could, he could never have efcaped i but he always had a relpeot to the Royal Family i or rather, he was too crafty and politick,and had too great fore- caff, to venture to lay hands on a Prince of the Blood. - ^ # . , This unfortunate Prince, deferred by almoft all, and finding himfelf accompanied but of Two thoufand Men at moft, was forced in the hotteft of Summer to crofs, without Tents or Baggage, all thofe Countries of the Rajas, that are almoft from AJ-* mire to Amadevad. Mean time the KoullU, which are the Countrey People, and the worftof all the Indies, and the greateftPcobbers, follow him night and day, rifle and kill his Soldiers, with fo much cruelty, that no Man could ftay Two hundred Paces be hind the Body, but he was prefently ftripp’d naked, or butcher’d upon the leaf! refid- ance. Yet notwithftanding, Vara made fhift to get near Amadevad, when he hoped, that the next day, or foon after, he Ihould enter into theTown to refrefh himfelf, and to try once more to gather again fome Forces : But all things fall out contrary to van- quifhed and unfortunate Men. . , The Governor, whom he had left in the Caftle of Amadevad, had already received both menacing and promifing Letters from Aureng-Zebe, which made him lofe Cou rage, and incline to that fide •, infomuch that he wrote to Vara, forbidding him to come nearer, 'if he did, he would find the Gates (hut,and ah in Arms. ^ Three days before 1 met this unhappy Prince, by a ftrange Accident, when he. obli ged me to follow him, having no Phylician about him i and the Night before that he received this News from the Governor of Amadevad, he did me the favor to make me come into the Karavan-Serrak^ where he was&gt; fearing left the Koulis ihould affaffinate me: And ( what is hard enough to believe in Indojian, where the Grandees efpecially are fo jealous of their Wives ) i was fo near to the Wife of this Prince,that the Cords of the Kanates, or Wind fereen, which enclofed them, ( for they had not fo much as a poor Tent) were faftned to the wheels of my Chariot. I relate this circumftance by the by only, to (hew the extremity Vara was reduced to. \ v ntmThe Hiftoryof the Late Revolution When thefe Women heard this fad News ( which was at the break of day, as I well remember ) they broke out upon a fudden into fuch grange cryes and lamentations that they forced tears from ones Eyes. And now behold all was in an unexpreHibk confulion : Every one looks upon his Neighbor, and no body knows what to do , or what will become of him. Soon after we law Vara come forth, half dead, now fpeak- ing to one, then another, even to the meandt Soldiers. He feeth allonilh’d , and ready to abandon him. What counfel ? whither can he go ? he mult begone inllant- ly. You may judge of the extremity he muft needs be in, by this fmall accident I am going to mention. Of three great Oxen of Guzaratte^ which 1 had for my Chariot one died the Night before, another was dying, and the third was tyred out, ( for we had been forced to march for three days together, almolt night and day, in an intole rable heat and dull: ) Whatever Vara could fay or command, whether he alledged it Was for himfelf, or for one of his Women that was hurt in her Leg, or for me i he could not poifibly procure forme, whetl erOx, or Camel, or Horfe: So that he was obliged, to my good fortune, to leave me there. I faw him march away, and that with tears in his Eyes, accompanied with four or five hundred Cavaliers at molt, and with two Elephants, that were faid to be laden with Gold and Silver i and 1 heard them fay, that they were to take their March towards Tatabakar i for he had no other Game to play, though even that feem’d in a manner impoffible, conlidering the fmall number of People left him, and the great fandy Defarts to be waded through in the hotteft feafon, mod of them without water fit to drink. And indeed mod of thofe that fol- low’d him, and even divers of his Women, did there peridi, either of drought, or the unwholfom waters, or the tirefom ways and ill food i or ladly, becaufe dripped by the XmlUs above-mention’d. Yet notwithdanding all this, Vara made hard (hid to get to the Raja Katcbe &gt; unhappy even herein, that he peridi’d not himfelf in this March. v f This Raja at fird gave him a very good Reception, even fofaras to promife him adidance with all his Forces, provided he would give his Daughter in marriage to his Son. But Jeffeigne foon wrought as much with this Raja^ as he had done with Jef- fomfeigne ; fo that Vara one day feeing the kindnefs of this Barbarian, cooled upon a fudden, and that confequently his Perfon was in danger there,he betakes himfelf to the Purfuit of his Expedition to Tatabakar. To relate how I got away from thofe Robbers, the Roullis^ in what manner I moved them to companion, how I faved the bed part of my fmall Treafure, how we became good Friends by the means of my Profeffion of Pbyfick, my Servants (perplexed as well as my fdf ) fwearingthat 1 was the greated Phylician of the World, and that the People of Vara, at their going away, had ill treated me, and taken from irie all my bed things: How, after having kept me with them feven or eight days, they had fo much kindnefs and generofity, as to lend me an Ox, and to condudf me fo far, that I was in fight ot Amadevad: And ladly, how from thence after fome days I returned to Vehh, having lighted on an occafion to go with a certain Omrab palling thither, in which Journey 1 met from time to time, on the way, with Carkaffes of Men , Ele phants, Oxen, Horfes, and Camels, the remainder of that unfortunate Army of Vara. Thefe are things, 1 fay, I mud not infid upon to deferibe them. Whild Vara advanced towards Tatabakar, the War continues in Bengale, and much lenger than was believed, Sultan Sujah putting forth his utmod, and playing his lad Game againd Emir-Jemla : Yet this did not much trouble Aureng-7;ebe, who knew twas a great way between Bengals and Agra^, and was fufficiently convinced of the pru dence and valor of Emir-Jemla. That which difquieted him much more was, that he {aw Soliman Chekgnb fo .near ( for from Agra to the Mountains Tis but eight clays Journey ) whom he could not mader,and who perpetually alarm’d him by the rumors that went continually about, as if he were coming down the Mountains with the Ra ja. Tis certainly very hard to draw him thence : But behold how he manages the matter to compafs it. He maketh the Raja Jeffeigne write one Letter after another to the Raji of Serenaguer, promifing him very great things, if he would furrender Soliman Cbekoub to him, and menacing War at the fame time, if he fhould obdinatcly keep him. The Raja an- fwers, L bat be rvould ratber lofe bit Ejlate, than do fo unworthy an A ft ion. And' Aureng- Zebe, feeing his refolution, taketh the Field, and marcheth diredfly to die foot of the Hills,of the Empire of the M O G O L. frills, and with an infinite number of Pike-men caufeth the Rocks to be cut, and the Railage to be widen’d. But the Raja laughs at all that *&gt; neither hath he much caufe to fear on that fide. Aureng-Zebe may cut long enough, they are Mountains inacceffible to an Army, and ftones would be fufficient to flop the Forces of four Indoftans j fothat hewasconftrained to turn back again. Vara in the mean time approacheth to the Fortrefs of Tatabakar, and when he was but two or three days journey off, he received News, that Mir-baba, who had long held it befieged , had at length reduced it to extremity: As I afterwards learned of our French, and other Frangnis that Were there, a pound of Rice and Meat having coft there above a Crown, and fo of other Vidfuals in proportion: Yet the Go- vernour held out j made Sallies, which extreamly incommoded the Enemy j and fhew’d all poiTible prudence, courage and fidelity * deriding the endeavours of the General, Mir-baba, and all the menaces and promifes of Aureng-Zebe. And this alfo I learned afterwards of my Country-men, the French, and of all thofe other Franguis that were with him i who added , that when he heard Vara was not far off, he redoubled his liberalities, and knew fo well to gain the hearts of all his Souldiers, and to encourage them to do bravely, that there was not one of them, that was not refolved to Tally out upon the Enemy, and to hazard all to raife the Siege, and to make Vara enter j and that he alfo knew fo well to caft fear and terrour into the Camp of Mir-baba, by fending Spies about very cunningly to affure that they had feen approach with great refolution, and very good Forces» that if he had come, as was believed he would do every moment, the Army of the Ene* my was for disbanding upon his appearance, and even in part to go over to him. But he is ftill too unfortunate, to undertake any thing profperoufly. Believing there fore, that to raife the Siege with fuch an handful of Men as he had, was impoflible j he did deliberate to pafs the River Induf, and to endeavour to get intoPerfia'i al though that alfo would have had mighty difficulties and inconveniencies, by reafort of the Defarts, and the fmall quantity of good waters in thofe parts &gt; befides, that upon thofe Frontiers there are but mean and Patans, who acknowledge neither the Perfian nor the Mogol. But his Wife did very much diffwade him from it, for this weakreafon, that he muft, if he did to, exped to fee his Wife and Daughter Slaves of the King of Perfia b that that was a thing altogether unworthy of the Grandeur of his Family, and ’twas better to die, than to undergo this Infamy* Vara, being in great perplexity, remembred, that there was thereabout a certain Patan, powerful enough, called Gion-Kan, whofe Life he had formerly faved twice, when Chah-Jehan had commanded he ftiould be caft under the feet of an Elephant, for having rebelled divers times: He refolved to go to him, hoping that he could give him fufficient Succours to raife the Siege of Fatabakar *, making account, that thence he would take his Treafure, and that going from thence, and gaining Kandahar, he could caft himfelf into the Kingdom of Caboul, having great hopes of Mokahct-Kan % who was Governour of itj beeaufe he was both potent and valiant, well beloved of his Country, and had obtained this Government by his (LWa’s) favour. But his Grandchild, Sepe-Chebuh, yet but very young , feeing his defign, caft himfelf at his Feet, intreating him for God’s fake, not to enter into the Country of thatP^/i. His Wife and Daughter did the fame, remonftrating to him, that he was a Robber, a revolted Governour, that he would infallibly betray him &gt; that he ought not to ftand upon the raifing of the Siege, but rather endeavour to gain Caboul, that the thing was not impoffible, foraftnuch as Mir-baba was not like to quite the Siege to follow him, and to hinder him from getting thither. Vara, being carried head-long by the force of his unhappy Deftiny, rejeded this counfd, and would hearken to nothing of what waspropofed to him, faying, as was true, that the March would be very difficult, and very dangerous j and maintaining always, that Gion-Kan would not be fo mean, as to betray him s after all the good he had done him. He departed, notwithftanding all that could be faid to him, and went to prove, at the price of his Life, Thatnotruft is to be given to a wicked Man* This Robber, who at firft believed that he had numerous Troops following him, gave him the faireft reception that could be, and entertained him with very great kindnefs and civility in appearance, placing his Souldiers here and there among his Subje&amp;s, with a ftrift order to treat them well, and to give them what refreffiments the92 The Hiftory of the Late Revolution the Country afforded : But when he found that he had not above two or three hun dred Men In all, he quickly (how’d what he was. It is not known, whether he had not received home Letters from Aureng-Zebe^ or whether his avarice had not been tempted by fome Mules Laid to be laden with Gold &gt; which was all that could be faved hitherto, as well from the hands of Robbers, as of thofe that conveyed it Whatever it be, on a certain morning, when no body looked for any fuch thing, all being taken up with the care of refrefhing themfelves* and believing all to be fafe • behold this Traitor, who had bellirr’d himfelf all night to get artned Men from all parts, fell upon Dara ; and Sepe-Chekpuh, killedTom'e of their Men that Hood up to de fend themfelves} forgot not to feme on the loads of the Mules, and of all the Jewels of the Women s made Vara to be tyed fad upon an Elephant, commanding the Exe cutioner to lit behind, and to cut off his head upon the lead fign given, in c^fe he Ihould be feen to reiiff, of that any one fhould attempt to deliver him. And in this ft range pofture he was carried to the Army before fdba bak$r, where he put him into the hands of Mir-baba, the General, who caufed him to be concluded in the com pany of this fame Traitor xo Labor, and thence to Vebti. When he was at the Gates of Vebli, it was ddHbeiatcd by Aureng-ficbe, whether he fhould be made to pafs through the mid If of the City, or no, to carry him thence to Gouakor. Many did advife, that that w&gt;as by no means to be donei that fome diforder might arifei that fome might come to fave him j and befides, that it would be a great dilhonour to the Family Royal. OTers maintained the contrary, viz. That it was abfolutely neceffary he Ihould pafs through the Town, to affonifh the World and to (hew the abfolute Power of Aureng-Zebe, and to difabufe the People, that might Hill doubt* whether it were himfelf, as indeed many Omrahs did doubt i and to fake away all hopes from thofe, who Hill preferved fome affedfion for him. The Opi nion of thefe la ft was followed i he was put on an Elephant, his Grand-child, Sepe- Cbekpuh, at his fide v and behind them was placed Rhadur-Kan, as an Executioner. 1 his was none of thofe brave Elephants of Ceilan or fVga, which he was wont to ride on, \vith gilt Harnefs and embroidered Covers, and Seats with Canopies verv hand- fomely painted and gilt, to defend themfelves from the Sun: It was an old Caitiff Animal, very dirty and natty, with an old torn Cover, and a pitiful Seat/all Open. There was no more feen about him, that Necklace of big Pearls, which thrfe Princes are wont to wear, nor thofe rich Turbants and Veils embroider’d/ All his Drcfs was a Veil of courfe Linnen, all dirty, and a Turbant of the fame, with a wretched Scarf of Kacbimre over his head, likeaVarleti his Grarid-fon, Sepe-Cbeionb, being in the fame equipage. In this miferable pofture he was made enter into the Town, and to pafs through the greateft Merchant-ftreets, to the end that all the People might fee him, and entertain no doubt any more whether it was he. As for me, I fancied we went to fee fome ftrange Maffacre, and was aftonifti’d at the boldnefs of making him thus pafs through the Town i and that the more, becaufel knew that he was very ill guarded , neither was I ignorant, that he was very much beloved by the lower fort of people, who at that time exclaimed highly againft the cruelty and tyranny oiAureng-Zebe, as one that kept bis Father in prifon, as alfo his own Son Sultan Mahmoud, and his Brother Morad- Bakcke. 1 was well prepar’d for it, and with a good Horfe and two good Men I went, together with twoothers of my Friends, to place my felf in thegreateft ftreet, where he was to pafs. But not one Man had the boldnefs to draw his Sword, only there were fome of the Fakjres , and with them fome poor people, who feeing that infamous Gion-Kan ride by his 5 ride, began to rail and throw ttones at him, and to call him Traitor, All the Shops were ready to break for the crowd of Spectators, that wept bitterly &gt; and there was heard nothing but loud Out-cryes and Lamentations, Invectives, and Curfes, heaped on, Gion-Kan. In a word, Men and Women, great and fmall (fuch is the tendernefs of the hearts of the Indians) were ready to melt into tears for compailiotr, but not one there was that durft fur to refeue him. Now after he had thus palled through the Town, he was put into a Garden called Beider-Abad. There were not wanting to te\\ Attreng-Zebe, how the People at this light had la mented Vara, and curfed the Patan, that had deliver’d him j and how the fame was in danger to have been ftoned to death, as alfo that there had been a great apprehen- fton of fome fedition and mifehief. Hereupon another Council was held, whether heof the Empire of the M O G O L. he fhpuld indeed be carried to Goualeor, as had been concluded before i or whether it were not more expedient to put him to death, without more ado &gt; Some were of opinion, that he ihould go to Goualeor with a ftrong Guard, that that would be enough j Danechmend-Kan , though Vara s old Enemy, infilling much upon that But Rauchenara-Begum, in purfuance of her hatred againft this Brother of hers, pufhed dunng-Zebe to make him away, without running the danger there was in fending him to Goualeor j asalfodidall his old Enemies, GaliMah-Kan, and Cbah-hejl-Kan, andefpecially a certain Flatterer, a Phyfitian, who was fled out of Per/w, firft called Halqm-Daoud, and afterwards being become a great Omrab named Talyrrub-Kan : This Villain boldly rofe up in a full alTembly, and cryed out, that it was expedient for the fafety of the State to put him to death immediately, and that the rather, be- caufe jie was no Muffulman \ that long fincehe was turn’d Idolater, without Religion, and that he would charge the Sin of it upon his own head: Of which im precation he foon after felt the frnart i for within a (lion time he fell into difgrace, and was treated like an infamous Fellow, and dyed miferably. But Aumig-Zebe] carried away by thefe inflances and motives, commanded that he fhould be put to death, and that Sepe-Cbekpub^ his Grand-child, fliould be fent to The Charge of this Tragical Execution was given to a certaimSlave, call’d Nazer^ that had been bred by Cbah-Jeban, and was known to have been formerly ill treated by Dara, This ^Executioner, accompanied with three or four Parricides more, went to ZWj, who was then himfelf dreffing fome Lentils with Sepe-Cbekpnb his Grandchild. He no fooner faw Nazer, but cryed out to Sepe-Cbekottb, My dear Son, behold thofe that come to kill us ! laying hold at the fame time of a fmall Knife, which was all the Arms that were left him. One of thefe Butchers immediately fell Upon Sepe-Cbekgtih j the others, upon the arms and legs of Dara^ throwing him to the ground, and holding him under, Till cut ,his throat. His Head was forth with carried to the Fortrefs of Aureng-Zebe, who prefently commanded it to be put inadifh, and that watet fhould be fetch’d \ which when brought, be wiped it off with an Handkerchief, and after he had caufed the Face to be wafhed clean, and the blood done away, and was fully fatisfled that it was the very head of Dara^ befell a weeping, and faid thefe words j Ah Bed-Bakt !

Take it away, and bury it in the Sepulchre of Houmayon, At night, the Daughter of was brought into the but afterwards fent to Cbab-Jeban, and Begum-Sabeb, who asked her of Aureng-Zebe. Concerning Varans Wife, (he had ended her days before at Labor ; She had poyfon’d her felf, forefeeing the extremities fhe was falling into, together with her Husband. Sepe-Cbekoub was fent toGoualeor. And after a few days, Gion-kan was fent for, to come before Zebe in the Affembly : To him were given fome Prefents, and fo he was fent away j but being near his Lands, he was rewarded according to his defert, being killed in a Wood. This barbarous Man not knowing, or not confidering, that if Kings do fometimes permit fuch A&amp;ions for their Interefl, yet they abhor them, and fooner or later revenge them. In the mean time, the Governour of ‘Tatababr^ by the fame Orders that had been required of Vara, was obliged to furrender the Fortrefs. It was indeed upon fuch a compofition as he would have, but it was alfo with an intention not to keep word with him. For the poor Eunuch, arriving at Labor, was cut in pieces, together with thofe few Men he had then with him, by Kalil-ullab-kan , who was Governour there of. But the reafon of the non-obfervance of the Capitulation was, that there was come intelligence, that he fecretly prepar’d himfelf to go diredly to Soliman-Cbekoub, Sparing no Gold, which under-hand he conveyed into the hands of our Rrangm, and to all thofe that were come with him out of the Fortrefs to follow him, under pretext of accompanying him as far as Vehli to Aureng-Zebe , who had often faid , that he Ihould be very glad to fee fo gallant a Man, and who had fo valiantly defended himfelf. There remained therefore none of the Family of but Soliman-Cbekpub, who could not eafily be drawn away from Serenaguer, if the had been fteady to his firll Declarations. But the fecret practices of the Raja Jcffeigne, the promifes and threats cf Aureng-Z.be, the death of Vara, and the other Rajas his Neighbours that had been gain’d, and were prepared by the Orders, and at the coll of Aureng-Zebe, to make War againlthim, did atlaftfliake the Faith of this perfidious Protedfor, a«d F madethe Hiftory of the Late Revolution made birr coiifcrst to tbeir demands. Sepe-Chekoub, who was advertifea of it, fled through the mid if of thofe horrid Countries and tearful Defarts, towards the great Libet But the Son of the Raja, fbon purfuing and overtaking him, caufed him to be a {faulted with Hones. The poor Prince was hurt feized, and earned to vvheiEe he was imprifon’d in Serengmf, that little Fortrefs, where at hr If- they had put MdiW- d Aurem-Zebe, to obferve what he had pra&amp;ifed towards 'Dara, and that no body mieht doubt it was Solman-CheLouh himfelf,' commanded him to be brought before him in the prefence of all the Grandees of the Court. At the entry of the Gate, the Chains were taken from his feet, leaving thofe he had about his hands, which feemed gilt. When this proper young Man, fo handfome and gallant, was feen to enter, there was a good number of Omrahs that could not hold their tears ? and, as 1 was in formed, all the great Ladies of the Court, that had leave to fee him come in, fella weeping. Aureng-Zebe, who appear’d himfelf to be touched at his misfortunes, began to fpeak very kindly to him, and to comfort him s telling him amongft other things, that he fhould fear nothing, that no hurt fliould be done to him-, on the contrary, that he fhould be well treated , and therefore be of good courage -&gt; that he had caufed his Father to be put to death for no other reafon, than that he was turn’d Kafer, and a Man without Religion. Whereupon this young Prince returned him the Salem, and bleffed him, abating his hands to the earth, and lifting them , as well as he could, up to his head, after the cuftom of the Country i and told him with refolution enough, That if he were to drink the Fouft, he intreated him that he might dye prefently, bein? very willing to fubmit to his Fate. But Aunng-Zebe promifed him publickly, that he fhould drink none of iti that he fliould reft fatisfied as to that, and not en tertain any fad thoughts about it. This being faid,he once more repeated the Salem ': And after they had asked lym feveral Queftions, in the Name of Aureng-Zebe, touch ing that Elephant which was charged with Roupies of Gold, taken from him when he went to Serenaguer^ he was fent to Gouahor to the reft. This Fouft is nothing elfe elfe but Poppy expreffed, and infufed a night in water. And ’tis that potion, which thofe that are kept at Goualeor, are commonly made to drink } I mean, thofe Princes, whofe heads they think not fit to cutoff: This is the firft thing that is brought them in the morning, and they have nothing given them to cat ’till they have drunk a great cup full of it i they would rather let them ftarve. This emaciates them exceedingly, and makeththem dye infenfibly, they lofing little by little their ftrength and under- ftanding, and growing torpid and fenfelefs. And by this very means ’tisfaid, that Sepe-Cbekpttb , and the Grand-child of Morad-Rahfbe , and Soliman-Cbekoub , were difpatch’d. As to Mdrad-Bakcbe, he was made away by a more violent death. For Aumg- Zekfeeing, that though he was in prifon, yet the generality had an inclination to him, and that many Verfes were fpread in the praifeof his Valour and Courage, thought himfelf not fafe enough by putting him to death in private, by giving him Feufl like others apprehending, that his Death would be ftill doubted of, and that that might on^ time or other occafion feme commotion, and therefore devifed the following Charge againft him. .The Children of a certain Sayed, very rich, whom he had caufed to be put to death in Amadevad, to get his Eftate, when he there made his preparations for War, and borrowed or took by force great Sums of Money from all the rich Merchants, ap peared in full A’ftlmbly, making their complaints, and demanding Juftice, and the Head of Morad-Bahbe, for the Blood of their Father. Notone of the Omrabs dim! contradidf it, both becaufe he was a Sayed, that is, one of Mahomet's Kindred, to whom great Veneration was paid *, and that every body fnfliciently underftood thede- fign of A ureng-Zabe, taking this fora pretence to rid himfelf openly oi Morad-Bakche, under a fhew of Juftice. So that the Head of him, that had killed the Father oi the Plaintiffs, was granted them without any other form of Procefs. Whereupon they went, with neceffary Orders iffued out for that purpofe, to cut it off hvGouakor. There remained no other Thorn in the Foot of Aureng-Zebe but Sultan Sujab, who kept himfelf ftill in Bengalee but he alfo was forced to yield at laft to the power and fortune of Aurer.g- Zebe. There were fent fo many Troops of all forts to Emir-Jemla, ihat at laft he was encompaiTed on all ftdes, both on this and that fide oi the River Gans.es &gt;•i-:v; ; ..;.-.vi.?v. .; ; ;U; of the Emfire of the M 0 GQ L. Ganges-, fo that he was necetTitattd to flye to which is the hit Town of gale on the Sea fide •, and here comes the conclufion of this whole Tragedy. This Prince being ddlitute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whether to flye, fent his eldefi Sop, Sujtan-Banque, to the King of Racan ox Moy, a Heathen or Idolatrous King, to know whether he-would givehim leave to make his Country his plact of refuge only for fome time, and do him tire favour, when the Mm foils 6t the Seafon-winds fhould come, to furnilh him with a VdCl for M sha, from thence to pafs into fome part of Eurky or Perfa. That Fung fent anfwcr, t ha the (houJd be very welcome, and have all poffible alliftance. So Sultan Banque returned to Daly with fome Galeailes, manned with Frangm (I mean, with thofe fugitive Portugals] and other firaggling Chriftians, that had put themfelves inTervice to that King, driving no other Trade than to ravage all this lower Bengalee upon which Sultan Sujah emhzxked with his whole Family, ws. his Wife, his three Sons, and Daughters. They were well enough received i whatever was neceffary for their fubldtance, fuch as that Coun trey would afford, v^as provided for them, in the name of that King. Some months pafs, the Seafon of the favourable Winds come in, but not a word of the Veffd, though he demanded it no otherwife than for his Money i for as yet he wanted not Rupies of Gold, nor Silver, nor Gems : He had too great a plenty of them j his Riches were, in all appearance, the .caufeof his ruin, or at lead contributed much to it. Thofe barbarous Kings havyT no true generofity, and are not much refrained by the Faith they have given, regarding nothing but their prefent Interefls, without fo much as confidering the mifehiefs that may befall them for their perfidioufhefs and brutality. To get out of their hands, one mud either be the dronger, or have nothing that may tempt their avarice. Sultan Sujah may long enough follicit for a Vedcl i all is in vain, he effects nothing : On the contrary, the King begins to {hew much coldnefs, and to complain of his not coming to fee him. 1 know not, whether Sultan Sujah thought it unworthy of himfelf, and too mean a thing to give him a Vifit i or rather, whether he fear’d, that being in the Kings Houfe he might not there be feized on, to take a- way all his Treafure, and then be delivered into the hands of ILmir-Jemla, who icr that purpofe promifed, in the name of Aureng-Zebe&gt; great Sums of Mony, and many other confiderable advantages. Whate^r the matter was, he would not go thither himfelf, but fent his Son Sultan Banque, who being near the Kings Houfe, began to Ihew liberality to the people, throwing out to them a good quantity of half Rupies, and whole Rupres, of Gold and Silver. And being come before the King, he prefented him with dore of Embroideries, and of rare pieces of Gold fmiths-work, fet with pre cious Stones of great value, excufing his Father, Sultan Sujah, as being indifpofed, and befeeching him in his name, that he would remember theVeffel, and the promife made to him thereof. But all that did not advance his bufinefsi on the contrary, five or fix days after, this King fent to Sultan Sujah, to ask of him one of his Daugh ters in Marriage which he could never refolve to grant him, whereat this barbarous Prince was highly offended. What then could hg do in this cafe ? The Seafon paffeth away. What (hall become of him ? What other refolution can he take, but to do a defperate A&amp;ion ? Behold a drange undertaking, which may give a great Example of what Defpair can do! Although this King of Racan be an Heathen, yet there is in his Dominions dore of mingled with the people, that are retired thither, or have been, for the mod part, taken Slaves, here and there, by thofe Frangux above-mentien’d. tan Siijih did und r-hand gain thefe Mahumetans and with two or three hundred Men, whom he had yet remaining of thofe that follow’d him from Bengale, he refolved, one day to fall unpc&amp;cdly upon the Houfe of this Barbarian, to kill all, and to make himfelf proclaim’d King of Racan- This was a very bold Enterprife, and fuch a one, as htid more of a Dcficrado in it, than of a prudent Man. Yet notwithdanding, as I Was inform’d, and by what 1 could learn from many Mahumeians, and Porhtgals, and Hollanders, that then were there prefent, the thing was feafible enough. But the day before the droke was to be given, the Defign was difeover’d s which did altogether overthrow the Affairs of Sultan Sujah, and was foon after thecaufe of his ruin. For not finding hereafter any way more to recover himfclf, he attempted to dy e towards Hgu •, which was a thing in a manner im poffible, by reafon of the vad Mountains and Forrefis to be paffed. Eefides, he was immediately purfued fo clofe, that he was over- * F % taken n36 The Hiflory of the Late Revolution, &amp;c. taken the fame day he fled. It may well be thought, that he defended himfelf with as much courage as was poflible. He killed fo many of thofe Barbarians, that it will f carce be believed, but he was fo overpow’red by the multitude of purfuers, that he was obliged to quit the Combat. Sultan Banque^ who was not fo far advanced as his Father, defended him alfo like a Lion but at length, being all bloody of the wounds by flones poured upon him from all fides, he'wasfeized on,and carried away, with his two little Brothers, his Sifters, and Mother. As to the Perfon of Sultan Sujalt himfelf, all what could be learnt of it, is this: That he, with one Woman, one Eunuch, and two other perfons,got up to the top of the Mountains that he received a wound in his Head by a ftone, which ftruck him down, but yet he rofe again -, the Eunuch having wound his Head about with his Turbant, and that they efcaped through the midft of the Woods. I have heard the Relation three or four other manner of ways , even by thofe per forms that were upon the place. Some did affure, that he had been found among the dead, but was not well known : And I have feen a Letter of the Chief of the Dutch Fadfory, confirming this. So that his difficult enough to know aright what is be come him. And this it is,which hath adminiftred ground to thofe fo frequent Alarms given us afterwards at Debit : For at one time it was rumored, that he was arrived at Maflipatan, to joyn with the Kings of and Fifapour i another time it was related for certain, that he had paffed in light of Suratte with two Ships, bearing the Red Colours, which the King of or the King of Siam had given him } by and by, that he was in Perfia^ and had been feen in Cbiros ^ and loon after in Kandahar ready to enter into the Kingdom of Cahoul it felf. Aureng-Zebe one day faid fmiling, that Sultan Sujab was at\al\ become an or Pilgrim. And at this very day there .are abundance of perfons who maintain that he is in Perfta, returned from Conftantittople, whence he is faid to have brought with him much Money. But that which confirms more than enough, that there is no ground for any of thefe reports, is that Letter of the Hollanders j and that an Eunuch of his, with whom I travelled from Bengale to Ma- Jlipatan, as alfo the Great Mailer of his Artillery i whom I faw in the Service of the Kingof Go/teta, have allured me, that he is no more in being, though they made difficulty to fay any more concerning him - , as alfo, that our French Merchants, that lately came out of Perfia and from Hijpaban^when I was yet at Vehlf had in thofe parts heard no news at all of him-, befides that, I have heard that a while after his Defeat, his Sword and Poynard had been found: So that ’tis credible, that if he was not killed upon the place, he foon dyed afterwards, and was the prey of fome Robbers, or tygers, or Elephants, of which the Forrefts of that Country are full. However it be, after this laft Adfion his whole Family was put inPrifon, Wives, and Children, where they were treated rudely enough i yet fome time after they were fet at more liberty, and they received a milder entertainment: And then the King called for the eldeft Daughter, whom he married. Whilft this wasdoing, fome Servants of Sultan Basque, joyned with divers of thofe Mahumetans which I have mentioned, went to plot another Confpiracy like the firft. But the day appointed for it being come., one of the Confpirators, being half drunk, began too foon to break out. Concerning this alfo I have heard forty different rela tions, fo that 5 tis very hard to know the truth of it. That which is undoubted is this, that the King was at length fo exafperated againft this unfortunate Family of Sujab, that he commanded it fihould be quite rooted out. Neither did there remain any one of it, that was not put to death, fave that Daughter which the King had made his Wife. Sultan Banque^ and his Brothers, had their Heads cut off with blunt Axes j and the Women were mured up, where they dyed of hunger and mifery. And thus endeth this War, which the lull of Pieigning had kindled among thofe four Brothers, after it had lafted five or fix years, from 1655, or thereabout, to 166a or 166 1 -, which left Aureng-Zebe in the peaceable poffeilionof this puifTant Empire. *- , r .* V-' The End of the First To m e.articular Events: OR, The moft confiderable Paflfages after the War for Five Y ears, or thereabout, in the Empire of the Great Moo'd l. HE War being ended, the ‘Tartars of Vsbec entertained thoughts of fend ing Ambafladors to Aureng-Zebe. They had feen him fight in theirCoun- trey, when he was yet a young Prince i Chah-Jeban having fent him to JiL command the Succors, which the Kan of Samarkand had defired of him againft the Kan of Ball^ They had experienced his Conduft and Valor on many occalions, and they confider’d with themfelves, that he could not but remem ber the Affront they did him, when he was juft taking the Capital Town of the Enemy: For the two Kans agreed together , and obliged him to retreat, alledging' That theyapprehended he might render himfelf Mafter of their whole State, juft as ? Efyar had formerly done of the Kingdom of Kachimere. Befides, they had certain intelligence of all he had done in Indoflan, of his Battels, Fortune, and Advantages s whence they might fufficiently eftimate, that though Chab-Jehan was yet living, yet Aureng-Zeb^ was Mafter, and the only Perfon that was to be owned King of the Indies. Whether then they feared his juft refentments, or whether it was, that their inbred Avarice and Sordidnefs made them hope for fome confiderable Prefent, the two Kans fent to him their Ambaftadors to offer him their Service, and to Congratulate him up on the happy beginning of his Reign. Aureng-Zebe faw very well, that the War bong at an end, this offer was out of feafon, and that it was nothing but fear or hope, as wefaid, that had brought them. Yet for all this, he received them honourably j and, fince I was prefent at their Audience, l can relate the Particulars of it with cer tainty. They made their Pceverence at a confiderable diftance from him, after the Indian cuftom, putting thrice their hands upon their heads, and as often letting them down to the ground. Then they approached fo near , that Aureng-Zebe himfelf might very well have taken their Letters immediately from their hands j but yet it was an Omrab that took and open’d them, and gave them to him. He forthwith read them with a very grave countenance y and afterwards commanded, there fhould be given to each of them an embroider’d Veft, a Turbant, and a Girdle of Silk in Embroidery , which is that which they call that is, an Habit from head to foot. After this, their Prefents were call’d for, which confifted in fome Boxes of choice Lapis Lazulus^ divers Camels with long hair, feveral gallant Horfes, fotne Camel-loads of frcfh Fruit, as Apples, Pears, Raifins and Melons &gt; ( for S tis chieflyTYkc that furnifhes thefe forts °f fruit, eaten at Debit all the Winter-long y ) and in many Loads of dry Fruit, as Prunes of Bokjra^ Aprecocks, Railrns without any ftones that appeared, and two other forts of Raifins, black and white, very large and very good. Aureng-Zebe was not wanting to declare, how much he was fatisfied with the Ge- nerofity of the Kans^ and much commended the Beauty and Ftarity of the Fruit,Hor fes, and Camels y and after he had a little entertain’d them of the ftate of the Acade my of Samarkdtnd^ and of'the Fertility of their Couhtrey, abounding in fo many rar6 and excellent things, he defired them to go and repofe themfelves, intimating with- all, that he fhould be very glad to fee them often. They came away from their Audience full of contentment and joy, not being much troubled, that they had been obliged to matte their Pteverence after the Indian cuftom, though it have fomcthing of flaVHh in it y nor much refenting jt, that the King had 1The Hifloryof the Late Revolution not taken their Letters from their own hands, I believe if they had been required to kifs the ground, and even todo fomething of a lower nature, they would have com plied with it. 'Tis true, it would have beep in vain, if they had ddired to make no other Salute, but that of their own Countrey, and to deliver to the King their Letters with their own hands j for that belongs only to the Ambaffadors of Perfia, nor have thefe this favour granted them,but with much difficulty. They hay’d above four months at M/i, w hat diligence foever they could ufeto be difpatch’d, which did incommode them very much ^ for they fell almoft all fick, and even Lome of them dyed, becaufethey were not. accuftomed to fuch heats as are in In- doftan, or rather becaufe they were fordid, and kept a very ill Diet. 1 know not whe ther there be a more avaricious and uncleanly Nation than they are. They laid up the Money which the King had appointed them for their maintenance, and lived a very mi- ferable life, altogether unworthy of Ambaffadors i yet they were difmifTed with great honour : The King, in the prefence of all the Onirahs, presented each of them with two rich Ser-apahs, and gave order that Eight thoufand Rupks (hon'd be carried to their Lodgings, which amounted to near Two th.oufand Crowns each. He alfo gave them for Prefents to the Kans their Mailers, very handfom Ser-apabsjioye of thericheft and bed wrought Embroideries, a good quantity of fine Cloth,and Silk-fluffs,wrought with Gold and Silver, and fome Tapeflries, and two Poynards fet about with precious ftones. During their flay, I went thrice to fee them, being prefented to them as aPhyfician by one of my Friends, that was Son of an Vsbec x that had made his Fortune in that Court. 1 had a defign to have learned fomething in particular of their Countrey, but y I found them fo ignorant, that they knew not fo much as the Confines of their State, much lefs could they inform me of any thing concerning the Tartars that have conquer’d China of fete years: In ffiort, they told me nothing that I knew not before. I had once the CuricKty to dine with them, which liberty l obtained eafily enough. They are not Men of much Ceremony ? it was a very extraordinary Meal for fuch a one as I, it being meet Horfe-f^efti i yet tor all this I got my Dinner with them •, there was a certain Ragou, which I thought paffable: And I was obliged to exprefs a liking of fo exquifite a Difh, which they fo much lull after. During Dinner, there was ailrange filence i they were very bufie in carrying in with their whole hands, for they know not what a Spoon is i but after that this Horfe-ildh had wrought in their ftomachs, they began to talk, and then they would perfwade me, they were the mod dextrous at Bows and Arrows, and the flrongefl Men in the World. They call’d for Bows,which are much bigger than thofe of Indcfian, and would lay a wager, to pierce an Ox or my Horfe through and through. Then they proceeded to commend the (irength and valor of their Women, which they defcribed to me quite otherwife than the Amazons^ telling me very wonderful dories of them, efpecially one, which would be admirable indeed, if 1 could relate it with-aTrfrtarf*«Eloquence,astheydid : They told me, that at the time when Aureng-Zebe tva&amp;z War in their Countrey, a Party of Twenty five or Thirty Indian Horfemen came to fall upon a fmall Village i whilft they plundred, and tyed all thofe whom they met with to make them Slaves,an old Woman faid to them, Children^ be not fo mifchievoas, my Daughter is not far off, (he 'will be here very fliortty, re treat if you be wife, you are undone if foe light upon you. They laughed at the old Wo man, and her Advice,- and continued to load, to tye, and to carry away her felfj but they were not gone half a Mile, but this old Woman, looking often backward, made a great out-cry of Joy, perceiving her Daughter coming after her on Horfe-back i and prefently this generous She Tartar, mounted on a furious Horfe, her Row and Arrows hanging at her fide, called to them at a didance, that die was yet willing to give them their Lives, if they would carry back to the Village all they had taken, and then with draw without any noife. The Advipe of this young Woman affeded them as little as that of her old Mother i but they were foon adonifh’d, when they found her let die at them in a moment three or four great Arrows, which druck as many of their Men to the ground, which forced them to fall to their Quivers alfo. But die kept her felt at that didance from them, that none of them could reach her. She laughed at all their Effort, and at all their Arrows, knowing how to attack them at the length of her Bow, and to take her meafure from thedrengthof her Arm, which was of another temper than theirs: So that after die had killed half of them with her Arrows, andput than into diforder, ftie came and fell upon the reft with the Zable in her hund and cut them all in pieces. The Ambaffadors of Tartary were not yet gone away from Debit, when Aureng-Zebe fell exceeding fick \ a violent and continued fever made him fometimes lofe his un- derftanding: His Tongue was feized with fuch aPalfie, that he loft almoft his fpeech, and the Phyficians defpaired of his Recovery i nothing was heard for the time , than that he was gone, and that his Sifter Raucbemra-Begum concealed his death out of de- fign. It was already bruited, that the Raja JeJJbmfeigne, Governor of Guzaraite.wzS on the way to deliver Chah-Jehan that Mobabet-Kan ( who had at length obeyed the Orders of Aureng-Zebe) quitting the Government of Caboul, and being already on this fide Labor to come back, made hafte alfo with Three or four thoufand Horfe for the fame end i and that the Eunuch Etbar-tyn, who kept Cbab-Jeban in the Fortrefs of Agra , would have the honour of his delivery. On one fide we fee Sultan Mazunt bellir himfelf exceedingly with Bribes, endeavouring by Promifes to allure himfelf of the Omrabs, fo far, as that one Night he went difguifed to the Raja Jejfeigne, entreat ing him with expreffions of deep refped, that he would engage himfelf for his in- tereft. We knew from other hands, that Rauchemra-Begum, together with Tedayfyn, the great Mafter of Artillery, and many Omrahs, declared for the young Prince Sultan Ek^ bar, the third Son of Aureng-Zebe, though he was but feven or eight years old j both Parties in the mean time pretending, they had no other defign than to deliver Cbab- Jeban : fo that the People believed, that now he was going to be fet at liberty, though none of the Grandees had any fuch thing in their thoughts, fpreading this Rumor,on ly to gain Credit and Goncourfe, and becaufe they feared, left by the means of Etbar- \an, or fome other fecret Intrigue, he ftiould one day appear in the Field. And indeed of all the Parties, there was not one that hadareafon to wilh for his liberty and reflora- tion to the Throne, except Jejfomfeigne, Mohabet-kgn, and fome others, that as yet had done no great matter to his difadvantage. The reft had been all againft him , at leaft they had vilely abandon’d him. They knew very well he would be like an un chain’d Lyon, if he came abroad: Who then could truft him ? And what could Etbar- kan hope for, who had kept him up fo clofe ? I know not, if by fome Adventure or other, he ftiould have come cut of Prifon, whether he would not have flood Angle, and been alone of his Party. But though Aureng-Zebe was very flick, yet for all this he gave order for all things, and particularly for the fure cuftody of Cbab-Jeban his Father - , and though ha had advifed Sultan Mazum to go and open the Gates to Cbab-Jeban, in cafe he fliould die, yet he omitted not to have Etbar-hgn inceflantly writ to. And the fifth day , in the height of his ficknefs, he caufed himfelf to be carried into the Aflembly of the Om- ™bs to (hew himfelf, and todifabufe thofe who might believe him to be dead, and to obviate popular Tumults,or fuch Accidents as might have caufed Cbab-Jeban to be fet at liberty. The (evepth, ninth, and tenth day, he made himfelf to be carried again into the faid Aflembly for the fame reafon , and, what is almoft incredible, the thir teenth, after he had recolleded himfelf from a Fit of Swooning, which occafioned a rumor through the wholeTownof his being dead, he called for two or three of the greateft Omrabs, and the Raja JcJJeignc, to let them fee that he was alive, made him- felt to be raifed in his Bed, called tor Ink and Paper to write to Etbar-hain, and fent for the Great Seal, wh\ch he had. txuhed with Rauchenara-Bagum, and commonly en- ciofed in a fmall Bag, fealed with a Seal he always wore about his Arm, fearing left.(he had already made ufe of it for her defigus. I was nigh my Agab, when all this News was told him, and I undertiood, that lifting up his hands to Heaven, he faid, What a Soul is this? A matcblefs Fortitude and Courage of Spirit ! God preferve tbee Aureng- Zebe, for greater things, certainly he rvdl not that thou Jhouldeft yet die. And indeed at- ter this Fit, he recover’d by little and little. He had no fooner recover’d his health, but he fought to get out of the hands of Chah-Jihan, and Begum-Saheb, the Daughter of Dara, to fecure the Marriage of 5 «/- tan-EkJjar, his third Son, with this Princefs, on purpofe thereby to gain him Authori ty, and to give him the greater right to the Empire : For he it is, who is thought to be by him deligned for it* He is yet very young, but he hath many near and powerful Relations at the Gourf, and is born of the Daughter of Cbah-Navaze- ftan , and confe- quciitlyThe Hiftory of the Late Revolution —V » —— quently of the Blood' of the Ancient Sovereigns of Machate *, whereas Sultan Mah moud and Sultan Mazum are only Sons of Ragipontnu, or Daughters of RajLs. Thefe Kings, though Mahumtans^ do, for all that, marry of the Daughters of the Heathen, either for State-intereft, or for extraordinary Beauty. But Aureng-Zebe, wasdifap. pointed in this defign : It will hardly be believed, with what height and tiercenefs of {pint Chah-Jeban and Begum reje&amp;ed thePropolition, and the young Princefs her fell, who, in the fear of being carried away, was for feme days defperate, and protefted file would rather kill her felf an hundred times over, if it were poilible, than to mar- ry the Son of him that had murthered her Father. He had no better fatisfa&amp;ion from Chab Jehan about certain Jewels which he asked of him, in order to tinifii a piece of work which he caufed to be added to a famous Throne, which is fo highly efieemed. For he fiercely anfwer’d, That Aureng-Zebe foould take m other Care, but to rule better than he did i that he Jbould let bis Jhme alone s that he was weary to hear of thefe Jewels i and that the Hammers were ready to beat them to dull, the firft time he fhould be mportund again about them. The Hollanders Would not be the laft in doing Reverence to Aureng-Zebe : they had thoughts of fending an Ambafiador to him. They pitched upon Monfieur Adrican,the Commander of their Fa&amp;ory at Szmzfte*, and being a right honefi man, and of good fenfeand judgment, not negleding to take the counfelof his Friends, he well acquit ted himfelf of this Employment. Aureng-Zebe, though he carries it very high, and afieds to appear a zealous Mahumetan, and confequently to defpife the Frangm, or Chrifiians, yet thought fit to receive them with much Refped and Civility. He even was ddirous, that this Ambafiador Ihould complement him in the mode of the Fran- guis, after he had been made to do it the Indian way. 3 Tis true, he received his Letters by the hand of an Omrah b but that was not to be taken for any Contempt,he having fiiew’d no more Honour to the Ambafiadors of Vsbec. After this, he intimated to him, that he might produce his Prefent i and at the fame time he caufed him, and fome of his Train, to be drefled with a Ser-Apab embroider’d. The Prefent confified of (lore of very fine Scarlet, fome large Looking-glafles, and divers excellent pieces of Chi- mfe and Japonefe work, among which there was a Faleky, and a Tack^avan, or a Field- Throne of admirable workmanfhip* This Ambafiador ^was not fo foort difpatch’d as he wifn’d, it being the Cuftom of the Kings of Mogol to detain Ambafladors as long as they well can, from a belief they have, that 5 tis the interefiof their Greatnefs, to oblige Strangers to give long At tendance at their Court!, yet he was not kept fo long as the Ambafiadors of Vs bee. ( Mean time he had the misfortune, that his Secretary died there, and the reft of his Re tinue began to grow fick. When the King x difmified him, he gave him fuch another Ser-Apah embroider’d, as the firfi was for himfelf and another, a very rich one, for the General of Batavia, together with a Poynard, fet about with Jewels, all accompa nied with a very obliging Letter. The chief Aim of the Hollanders in this Embafiy was, to make themfelvcs imme diately known to the King, thereby to gain Credit, and to intimidate the Governors of the Sea-Ports, and other places, where they have their Fadories &gt; that fo they may not attempt, when they pleafe, to infult over them, or to trouble them in their Trade? thereby letting them know, that they had to do with a potent Nation, and that hath a door open to addrefs themfelves, and to complain immediately to the King. Their End alfo was, to make it appear, what interefi the King had in their Commerce b and therefore they (hew’d long Rolls of Commodities, bought up by them through the whole Kingdom, and Lifts of confiderableSums of Gold and Silver,every year brought thither by them b but faying not a word of thofe which they draw thence, from the Copper, Lead,Cinamon,Cloves,Mufcadin,Pepper, Wood of Aloes, Elephants, and other Gommodities which they vend there. About this time, one of the moft confiderable Omrahs of Aureng-Zebe addrefted him felf to him, and reprefented, that this multitude and variety of perplexing Affairs} and this perpetual Attention of mind in him, might foon caufe a great Alteration in his Temper, and a dangerous Inconvenience in his Health. But Aureng-Zebe, feemmg to take almoft no notice of what that Omrah Laid, turn’d himfelf another way, and approaching to another of the prime Omrahs of the Court, a perfon of great know ledge and judgment, fpoke to him in this purpofe (as i was informed by the S° n this Lord, who was my Friend. ) '* ouof the Empire of the M O G O L. Tott other Sages^ are you not all of the mind ^ that there are times and conjunctions fo urgent, that a King ought to hazard his life for his Subjects, and facrifice himfelf for their defence with Arms in his hands ? And yet this effeminate Man would diffwade me from ta king pains, and dehort me from watching and follicitude for the Public^ and carry me by pretences of Health, to the thoughts of an eafie life, by abandoning the Government of my People, and the management of Affairs, to fome Vifr or other. Doth he not tyow , that Providence having given me a Royal Extraction, and raifed me to the Crown of Indoftan hath not made me for my felf alone, but for the good and fafety of the Public^, and for the procurement of franquility and Happinefs to my Subjefts, as far as that may be obtained by ice and Power? He feeth not the confequence of hisComfds, and what mifchiefs do at tend Viftrjhips. Voth he think it to be without reafon, what our Grand Sady hath fo generoufly pronounced, 0 Kings, ceafe, ceafe to be Kings, or govern your Kingdoms your felves ? Go tell thy Countrey-man, that 1 fhall well likg of the care he is confiantly to takg of the faith ful difcbarge of his PIdee s but advife him alfo, not any more to run out himfelf fo far as he hath done. We have natural inclination enough to a long, eafie, and carelefs life , and there need no Counfellors to Jhakg off bufinejs and trouble. Our Wives, that lie in our bofom, do too often, befides our own genius, incline us that way. At the fame time there happen’d an Accident, that made a great noife at Vehli, ef- pecially in the Seraglio, and difabufed a great many, that could as hardly believe as my felf, that Eunuchs, though they had their Genitals quite cut away, could become amorous as other men. Vidar-kan, one of the chief Eunuchs of the Seraglio, who had built an houfe, where he came often to divert himfelf, fell in love with a very beautiful Woman, the Sifter of a Neighbor of his, that was an Heathen Scri vener. Thefe Amours lafted a good while, before any Body blamed them, fince it was but an Eunuch that made them, which fort of men have the priviledge to go where they pleafe &gt; but the familiarity grew fo great, and fo extraordinary betwixt the two Lo vers, that the Neighbors began to fufpedfr fomething, and to rally the Scrivener,which did fo touch him, that he threatned both his Sifters and the Eunuch to kill them, if they ihould continue their Commerce. And foon after, finding them in the Night lying together, he ftabbed the Eunuch out-right, and left his Sifter for dead. The whole Seraglio, Women and Eunuchs, made a League together againft him to make him away j but Aureng-Zebe diflipated all thefe machinations, and was content to have him turn Mahumetan. Mean time ’tis thought, he cannot long avoid the malice and power of the Eunuchs i for 5 cis not, as is the common faying, with Men as with Brutes j thefe latter become gentler and more tradable when they are caftrated &gt; but men more vi cious, and commonly very infolent, though fometimes it turneth to an admirable Ffc delity and Gallantry. It was alfo about the fame time, that Aureng-Zebe was fome what difeontented with Rauchenara-Begum, becaufe (he was fufpeded to have given Accefs to two young Gallants into the Seraglio, who were difeover’d, and brought before Aureng-Zebe. Yet this being but a fufpicion, heexprefled to her no great refentment of it &gt; nor did he make ufe of fo great rigor and cruelty againft thofe poor men, as Chah-Jehan had done againft the perfon above fpokenof. The matter was related to me by an old Portuguefe Woman ( that had a long while been Slave to the Seraglio, and went out and in at pleafure ) as followeth : She told me that Raucbenara-Begum , after (he had drawn from a young man, hidden by her, all his Ability, deliver’d him to fome Wo men, toconveyhimaway in the Night thorough fome Gardens, and fo tofave him: But whether they were difeover’d, or whether they feared they ftiould be fo, or what elfe might be the caufe, they fled, and left him there wandring in the midft of thofe Gardens, not knowing which way to get out : And being at laft met with, and brought before Aureng-Zebe, who examined him ftrkftly, but could draw nothing elfe bom him, than that he was come in over the walls, he was commanded to get out foe fame way by which he entred : But it feems, the Eunuchs did more than Aureng- Z'tbe had given order for, for they caft him down from the top of the walls to the bot- tom. As for the other young Gallant, this fame Woman aflured me, that he was found 'yandring in the Garden like the firft i and having confefled that he was come in by foe Gate, Aureng-Zebe commanded likewife, that he alfo ftiould pafs away again by foe fame Gate , yet referving to himfelf a fevere chaftifement for the Eunuchs, G finceThe Hiftory of the Empire fmce not only the honour of the Royal Houfe, but alfo the fafety of the King’s p er- {on is herein concerned. Some months after, there arrived at Debit feveral AmbafTadors, almoft at the fame time. The hrft was Xerif of Meccba, whofePrefent did confift in fome Arabian Kor ies : The fecond and third Ambaffadors were, he of the King of Hyeman , or Happy Arabia^ and he of the Prince of Bajfora, who likewife prefented Arabian Hoiks, The two remaining Ambafladois were fent from the King of Ethiopia. To the three hrft no great regard was given - , they appear’d in fo miferable and confufed an Equipage, that it was perceived they came only to get fome money by the means of their Prefent and of the many Horfes, and other Merchandize, which under the pretence of Ambaf fadors, entred without paying any Duty into the Kingdom, there to be fold , and to buy for the money a quantity of Indian Stuffs, and fo to return, without paying likewife any I mpoll at all. But as ;o the Ethiopian Embafly, that deferves to be otherwife taken notice of i the King of Ethiopia having received the News of the Revolution of the Indies , had a defigp to fpread his Name in thofe Parts, and there to make known his Grandeur and Magnificence, by a fplendid Embaflfy : Or, as Malice will have it, or rather as the very truth is, to reap fome Advantage by a Prefent as well as the reft. Behold therefore this great Embafly ! He chofe for his Ambalfadors two perfons, that one would think were the moft confiderable in his Court, and the moft capable to make fuch a Defign profper. And who were they ? The one was a Mahumetan Merchant, whom I hadfeen fome years ago at M(9%, when I pafled there coming out of Egypt over the where he was to fell fome Slaves for that Prince, and to buy of the money, raifed thence, fome In dian Commodities. And this is the fine Trade of that great Chrijlian King of Africa. The other was a Chriftian Merchant of Armenia^ born and married in Aleppo^ known in JEthiopia by the name of Murat. I had feen him alfo at M^, where he had ac commodated me with the half of his Chamber, and affifted me with very good Ad vice, whereof l have fpoken in the beginning of this Hiftory, as a thing taking me off from pahTing into Ethiopia^ according to my firft defign. He alfo came every year to that place, in that King’s Name, for the fame end that the Mahumetan did,and brought the Prefent which the King made every year, to the Gentlemen of the Englifh Dutch Company of the Eaft-Indies, and carried away theirs. Now the King of Ethiopia, futably to his defign, and the defire he had of making his Ambaftadors ap pear with great Splendor, put himfelf to great Expences for this Embaffie: He gave them Thirty two young Slaves, of both Sexes, to fell them at Moly, and thence to make aSum of Money to bear their Charges. A wonderfulLargefs ! Slaves are com monly fold there for Twenty five or thirty Crowns apiece, one with another. A con fiderable Sum. Befides, ,he gave them for a Prefent to the Great Mogul Five and twen ty choice Slaves, among which there were nine or ten very young, proper to make Eunuchs of. A very worthy Prefent for a King, and he a Chriftian, to a Mahumetan Prince ! It feems the Chriftianity of the Ethiopians is very different from ours. He added to that Prefent, twelve Horfes, efteem’d as much as thofe of Arabia, and a kind of little Mule, of which I faw the Skin, which was a very great Rarity, there being noTyger fo handfomly fpeckled, nor Silken Stuff of India fo finely, fo varioufly, and fo orderly ftreaked, as that was. Moreover, there were for a part of the Prefent, two Elephants teeth, fo prodigious, that they affured it was all that a very able bodied man could do, to lift up one of them from the ground. Laftly, an Horn of an Ox full of Civett, and fo big, that the Aperture of it being meafur’d by me, when it came to Dehli, it had a Diameter of Half a Fcot, and fomewhat better. All things being thus prepared, the Ambaffadors depart from Gondez, the Capital of Ethiopia, fituated in the Province of Dambea, and came through a very troublefom Countrey to Beiloul, which is a difpeopled Sea-Port over againft Moha, nigh to Babel-mandel, not daring to come ( forReafons elfewhere to be alledged ) the ordinary way^if the Caravans, which is made with eafe in Forty days to Arkjkg, and thence to pafs to the Ifle of Mafoua. Du ring their ftay at Beilout, and expe&amp;ing a Bark of Mofy, to waft over the there died fome of their Slaves, becaufe the Veffel tarried, and they found not in that place thofe refrdhments that were neceff'ary for them. When they came toMoka-&gt; they foon fold theit Merchandize, to raife a Stock of Money according to order. But they had tl is ill luck, that that year the Slaves were very cheap, becaufe the Market was gluttedglutted by many other Merchants, yet they raifed a Sum to purfue their Voyage: fhey Embark d upon an Indian Veifel to pafs to Suratte $ their PafTage was pretty good'? they were not above Five and twenty days at Sea 5 but whether it was that they had made no good proVifion for want of dock, or what elfe the eaufe might be 3 many of their Slaves and Horfes, as alfo the Mule, whereof they faved the Skin, died. They were no fooner arrived at Suratte, but a certain Rebel of called Seva-Gi, cams and ranfacked and burned the Town, and in it their Hotife, fo that they could fave nothing but their Letters, fome Slaves that were fick, or which Seva-Gi could not light on, their Ethiopian Habits which he cared not for, and the Mule’s Skirt, and the Ox’s Horn, which was already emptied of the Civett. They did very much exagge rate their misfortune s but thofe malicious Indians that had feen them arrive infuch a wretched condition, without Provilions, without Habits, without Money, or Bills of Exchange, faid, that they were very happy, and (hould reckon the Plunder of Suratu for a piece of their beft Fortune, forafmuch as Seva~Gi had faved them the labour of bringing their miferable Prefent to M/r, and had furniflit them with a very fpecious pretence for their beggarly condition, and for the fale they had made of their Givett* and of fome of their Slaves, and for demanding of the Governor of Suratte Provifi- ons for their fubfiftence, as alfo fome Money and Chariots to continue their Voyage to VehlL Monheur Adrkan^ chief of the Dutch Fadk&gt;ry, my Friend, had given to the Armenian Murat a Letter of Recommendation to me, which he deliver’d himfelf at Dehli, not remembring that 1 had been his Hoft at Mokp, It was a very pleafant meet-^ ing when we came to know one another, after the fpace of five or fix years. I em* braced him affe&amp;ionately, and promifed him that I would ferve him in whatever I could i but that, though I had Acquaintance at the Court, it was impoffible for rqe to do them any conllderable good Office there : For lince they had not brought with them any valuable Prefent, but only the Mule’s Skin, and the empty Ox’s Horn, and that they were feen going upon the ftreets without any Paleky orHorfes, fave that of our Father Miffionary, and mine (which they had almoft killed) cloajthed like Beg gars, and followed with fetfen or eight Slaves, bare-headed and bare-foot, having no* fhing but an ugly Sharfe tyed between their Legs, with a ragged Cloth over their Left ^houlder, paffing under their Left Arm like a Summer-Cloak , (ince, I faid,they were iq fuch a pofture, whatever I could fay for them was infignificant i they were taken fok Beggars, and nobody took other notice of them. Yet notwithftanding I faid fo much of the Grandeur of their King to my A gab Danechmendkpn, who had caufe to hearken to roe, as managing all Foreign Affairs there, that Aureng*Zebe gave them Audience, received their Letters, prefented them each with an Embroider’d Veft, a Silken Embroider’d Girdle, and a Turbant of the fame, gave order for their Enter tainment, and difpatched them in a little time, and that with more honour than there was ground to expedf: For in difmiffing them, he prefented them each with another fuch Veft, and with 6000 Kupies for them all, which amounteth to about 300© Crowns,of which the Mahumetan had four thoufand,and Muratjbec&amp;ufe a Chriftian,but two thoufand. He alfo gave them for a Prefent to their Mafter a very rich Ser-apah or Yeft, two great filver and gilt Trumpets, twofilver Tymbals,aPoynard cover’d with Jewels, and the value of about twenty thoufand Francs in golden and filver Kupies^to kt their King fee Money coined, as a Rarity he had not in his Countrey : But Aureng* Zebe knew very well, that thefe Kupies would not go out of the Kingdom, and tha|t they were like to buy Commodities for them : And it fell out fo» for they laid them °ut, partly in fine Cotton Cloth, tomakeftiirts of for their King, Queen, and their only lawful Son that is to be the Succeffor } partly in fllken Stuffs ftreaked with Gold or Silver, to make Vefts and Summer-Drawersob partly in Ewg/i/^ Scarlet, to make two Arabian Vefts of for their King alfo&gt; and laftly, in Spices, and in ftoreof coarfer Cloth, for divers Ladies of his Seraglio, and for the Children he had by them, all with* out paying any Duty. for all my friendftiip with Murat, there were three things that made me almoft re** pent to have ferved them. The jirjl, becaufe Murat having promifed me to leave with me for 50 Kupies, a little Son of his, that was very pretty, of a delicate blacky without fuchafwelled Nofe, or fuch thick Lips as commonly, the Ethiopians have, broke his word with me, and let me know, that he fhould take no lefs (or him than 300 Eupks, For all this, I had thoughts of buying him, for Rarity’s fake, and that tThe Hifiory of the Empire m ; a W f aY a Father had fold rue his Son. The ficond, becaufe I found that Murat, as well as the Mahutnetan, had obliged themfelves to Attren&amp;rZebe that they would em ploy their intereft with their King, that he might permit in to rebuild an old Mofauee ruined in the time of the Portugals, and which had been built tor a Tomb of a er eat Vervich which went from Mecha into Ethiopia, for the propagation of Mabumeta- nifm, and there made great progrefs. They receiv’d of Aureng-Zebe two thoufcndtf*- ties for this Engagement. This Mojquee had been pulled down by the P^g 4 /, when they came with their Succors into Ethiopia, which the then King, who turn’d Catho- lick had asked of them againft a Mabumetan Prince, invading his Kingdom. The third becaufe they detired Aureng-Zebe, in the name of their King, t© give them an i/cif and eight other %oks,which I well remember, were of themoft reputed in the Mahumetan Religion : Which proceeding feemed to me very unworthy of a Cbri- (tian Embaffador, and Gbriftiau King, and conhrmed to me what 1 had been told at Mo- ka that the Chrijlianhfy of Ethiopia muft needs be fome odd thing ? that it favors much of Mahumetanifmfind that the Mahumetant increafe exceedingly in that Empire, efpe- cially fince the fortugals, that came ia there for the Reafon lately expreffed,were either killed, upon the death of the King, by the Cabal of the Queen-Mother, or expell’d to gether, with the Patriarch Jefuite, whom they had brought along from Goa. During the time that the Ambaffadors were at Vebli, my Agah, who is more than ordinary curious, made them often come to him, when I was prefent, to inform him- felf of the State and Government of their Countrey,and principally to learn fomething of the fource of the Nile, which they call Ababile, of which they difcourfed to us as a thing fo well known, that no body doubted of it. Murat himfelf, and a Mogol, who was returned out of Ethiopia with him, bad been there, and told us very near the fame Particulars with thofe I had received of it at Moika, viz. That the Nth had its Origine in the Countrey of Agaw &gt; that it ilfued out of the Earth by two Springs bubling up, near to one another, which did form a little Lake of about thirty or forty paces long i that coming put of this Lake, it did make a confiderable River: and that from fpace to fpace, it receiv’d fmallRivers increafing it. They added, that it went on circling, and making as ’twere a great Ifle ? and that afterwards it tumbled down from fteep Rocks into a great Lake, in which there were divers fruitful Hies, bore of Crocodiles, and ( which would be remarkable enough, if true ) abundance of Sea-Calves, that have no other vent for their Excrements than that, by which they take in their foodi this Lake being in the Countrey of Vambea, three fmall days journey from Gondar, and four or five days journey from the fource of the Nile. And laftly, that this River did break out of this Lake, being augmented with many River-waters, and with feveral Torrentsfalling into it, efpecially in the rainy Seafon, (which do regularly begin there, as in the Indies about July, which is very confiderable and convincing for the inunda tion of the Nile) and fo runs away through Sonnar, the capital City of the King ot Emgi, Tributary to the King of Ethiopia, and from thence paffeth to the Plains ot Mefre, which is Egypt. r u anf The Ambafladors were not wanting to fay more than was liked on the iuDject ex their King’s Greatnefs, and of the ftrength of his Army, but the Mogolian did not ovcrrmuch agree with them in it ? and in their abfence reprefented to us this Army, which he had feen twice in the Field, with the Ethiopian King on the head of it, as the moft wretched thing in the world. They alfo related to us divers Particulars of that Countrey, which I have put m my Journal, one day perhaps to be digefted and copied: In the mean time I (hall infert here three or four things which Murat told me, becaufe l efteem them very extrava gant for a Chilian Kingdom. He faid then, that there were few men in whobefides their lawful Wife, had not many others, and himfelf owned that he had two, without reckoning her which he had kfr at Aleppo: That the Ethiopian Women did not fo hide themfelves, as they do in the Indies among the Mahumetans, nor even as among the Gentiles: Fhat thofe of the meaner fort- of People, Maids, or marrie Women, Slaves or Free, were often together pell-mell, night and day, in Chamber, without thofe jealoufies fo common in other Countries: That the worn of Lords did not flick much to go into the houfe of a Ample Cavalier, whom t ey knew to be a Man of Execution: fhat if I had gone into Ethiopia,thty would loon nav obliged me to marry, as they had done, a few years fince, to a certainJ Kx of the MOGOL named himfelf a Greek Phyfician: that an ancient tnan, of about Fourfcore years of age, did one day prefent to the King fourfcore Sons, all of age, and able to bear Arms i and that the King asked him, Whether he had no more but them &gt; To whom having anfwer’d, No, but only fome Daughters, the King fent him away with this reproach j Begone, thou Calf, and be alhamedfor having no more Children at that age, as if Women were wanting in my Dominions! that the King himfelf had at leaft fburfcore Sons and Daughters running about pell-mell in the Seraglio, for whom he had caufed to be made a number of round verniftied flicks, made like* little maze » thofe Chil dren being fond of having that in their hand like a Scepter, diftinguilhing them from thofe that were Children of Slaves, or from others living in that place. Aureng-Zebe fent alfo twice for thefe Ambafladors, for the fame reafort that my Agah did, and efpecially to enquire after the ftate of Mahuntetanifm in that Country, lie had alfo the curiofity of Viewing the skin of the Mule, which remained, I know not how, in theFortrefs amongft the Officers» which was to me a great mortiflca* tion, becaufe they had defigned it for me for the good fervices I had done them. 1 made account to have one day prefented it to fome very curious perfon in Europe. I urged often, that together with the Mule^skin, they ffiould carry the great Morn to fareng-Zebe, to (hew it him j but they fear’d, leafl he ftiould make a queftion, which would have perplexed them » viz. how came to pafs, that they had faved the Mom from the plunder of Suratte^ and loft the Civet ? Whilft thefe Ambaffadors of Ethiopia were at Vehli^ it came to pafs that Aureng' Zrbe called together his Privy Gouncel, and the moft learn’d perfons of his Court, to chufe a new Mafter for his third Son, Sultan Eckbar , whom he defign’d for his Sue- ceflbr. In this Gouncel he (hew’d the paffion he hath to have this young Pririce well Educated* and to make him a great Man. Aurenge-Zebe is not ignorant of what im portance it is, and how much 5 tistobe wiffied, that as much as Kings furmount o- thers in Greatnefs, they may alfo exceed them in Virtue and Knowledge. He alfo well knows, that one of the principal fources of the Mifery^ of the miTGovernment, of the un-Peopling, and the decay of the Empires of Afia proceeds from thence, that the chil dren of the Kings thereof are brought up only by Women and Eunuchs, which often are no other than wretched Slaves of RuJJia, Circajjia, Mingrelia, Gurgiflan and Ethio- pia j mean and fervile, ignorant and infolent fouls. Thefe Princes become Kings, when they are of Age, without being inftru&amp;ed, and without knowing what ’tis to be a King &gt; amazed when they begin to come abroad out of the Seraglio, as per fons coming out of another World, or let out of fome fubterraneous Cave , where they had lived all their lifetimes wond ring at every thing they mtet, like fotnahy Innocents j believing all, and fearing all, likd Children, or nothing at all, as if they were ftupid: And all this, according to their Nature, and futableto the firft Images imprinted upon them &gt; commonly high and proud, and feemingly grave* but of that kind of pride and gravity, which is fo flat and diftafteful, and fo unbecoming them, that one may plainly fee, 5 tis nothing but brutality or barbaroufnefs, and the efled of fome ill-fludied* and ill-digefted Documents &gt; or elfe they fall into fome childiftl civi lities, yet more unfavoury* or into fuch,cruelties, as are blind and brutal** or into that mean and grofs vice of drunkennefs, or into an exceffive and altogether unreafon- able Luxury, either ruining their bodies and underftandings with their Concubines* or altogether abandoning themfelves to the pleafures of Hunting, like fome carnive-* tous Animals, preferring a pack of Dogs before the life of fo many poor people, whom they force to follow them in the purfuit of their Game, and fuffer to perilh of Hunger, heat, cold,and mifery. In a word, they always run into fome extreme or other, being altogether irrational and extravagant, according as they are carried by their fta* tural temper, or by the firft impreffions that are given them * thus remaining, almoft all, in a ftrange ignorance of what concerns the ftate of the Kingdom* the reins of the Government being abandoned to fome Vifir, who entertains them in their ignorance and in their paflions, which are the two ftrongeft fupports he can have to rule always according to his own mind, with moft affurance, and the leaft contradidion ** and given over alfo to thofe Slaves their Mothers, and to their Eunuchs, who often know nothing but to continue plots of cruelty, whereby they ftrattgle and banifh one ano ther, and fometimes the Vilirs, and even the Grand Signors themfelves 5 fo that no tnan whatfoever, that hath any Eftate, cart be in fafety of his life.The Hifiory of the Empire But to relurns after all thefe Ambafladots, which we have fpoken of, there came at lad news* that the Ambaffador of Perfia was upon the Frontiers. The Perfian Omrahs * that are at the fervice of the Mogof fpred a rumor that he came for affairs of great importance i though intelligent perfons much doubted of a Gommiffion of that nature, confidering that the time of great conjunctures was paired, and thatthofe Omrabf^ and the other Perfians did what they did, rather to make a Ihow, than for any thing elfe. Mean time, on the day of the Entry, this Ambaffador was received with all poffible refpect: The Bazars, through which he palfed, were all new-paint ed, and the Cavalry attending on the way for above the length of a whole League. Many OmraFs accompanied him with Mufick, Tymbals and Trumpets, and whenhe entred into theFortrefs, or the Palace of the King, the Guns went off. Aumg-Zebe received him with much civility, and was content he Ihould make his Addrefs to him after the Per/i0» mode, receiving alfo, without any fcruple, from his hands the Letters of his King i which, out of refpeft, he lifted up even to his head, and after wards read them with a grave and ferious countenance: Which done, he caufed an embroider’d Veft to be brought, together with a richTurbant and Girdle, command ing it to be put on him in his prefence. A little after, it was intimated to him,that he might order his Prefent to be brought in, which confifted of five and twenty as hand* fome Horfes as ever I faw, led, and cover’d with embroider’d trapings i and of twenty very ftately and lufty Camels, as big as Elephants : Moreover, of a good number of Boxes, faidto be full of moft excellent Rofe-water i and of a certain diltilled water, very precious, and efteemed highly cordial i befides, there were difplayed five or fijfc very rich and very large Tapifferies,'and fome embroider’d pieces exceeding noble; wrought in fmall flowers, fofine and delicate, that I know not whether in a]\ Europe any fuch can be met with. To all this were added four Damaskiri’d Swords, with as many Poynards, all cover’d with Jewels &gt; as alfo five or fix Harnaflcs of Horfes, which were much efteem’d, being alfo very fine and rich, the fluff being raifed with rich Embroidery fet with fmall Pearls, and very fair Turcoifes of the old Rock. It was obferv’d, that Aureng-Zebe beheld this Prefent very attentively &gt; that he ad mired the beauty and rarity of every piece, and that feveral times he extolled the Ge- nerofity of the King of Perfia *, affigning to the Ambaffador a place among his chief Omrahs, And after he had entertained him a while with a difeourfe about the incon* veniencies and hardfhips of his Voyage, he difmift him, and made inflance, that he fliould come every day to fee him. During the four or five Months that the Ambaffador ftaid at Debit, he was always Splendidly treated at Aureng-Zebe's charge ; and the greateft Omrahs prefented him one after another j and at laft he was very honourably difmifTed: For Anreng-Zebe had him apparelled with another richor Veft, to which he added confiderable prefents for himfelf, referving thofe he intended for his King, ’till he fhould fend an Ambaffador exprefly j which fome time after he did. Notwithftanding all thefe teftimonies of honour and refpedf which Aureng-Zebe had fhew’d to this Ambaffador, the fame Perfians, above fpoken of, gave out, that their King had fenfibly reproached him in his Letters, with the Death o(Dara, and the Imprifonment of Cbab-Jehan, as a&amp;ions unworthy of a Brother, and a Son* and a Mufulman \ and that he had alfo hit him with the word Alem-Guire, or Conquerour of the World, which Aureng-Zebe had caufed to be engraven on his Coyn. But’tis hard to believe,that the King of Perfia (hould do any fuch thing to provoke fuch a Vi- diorious Prince,fince Per/w is not in a condition to enter into a War with Indoflan j 1 am rather apt to believe, that Perfia hath work enough to keep Kandahar on the fide of \ Indofian, and the Frontiers on the fide ofTurky: Its Forces and Riches are known &gt; it produceth not always fuch great Kings as the Chah-Abbas , Valiant, Intelligent, and Politick, knowing to make ufe of every thing, and to do much with fmall expences.' Ifit w 7 ere in a condition of undertaking any thing againft Indo(lan, or really fenfible of Piety and the Mufal-Man Faith, why was it that in thefe laft troubles and Civil Wars, which continued fo long in the fat fti 11 and looked on, when Dara, Cban-Jehan, Sultan Sujah, and perhaps the Governourof Caboul defired their afliftance s and they might with no very great Army, nor great expences have feized on the faireft part India, beginning from the Kingdom of O&amp;w/, wnto the River Indus, and beyond it, and fo made themfdves Umpires of all things t yet notwith ftandingof the M O G O L. (tending there muft needs have been feme oflenfive Expreilions in thofe Ferfian Let ters, or elfe the AmbafTador muft have done or faid foniething that difpleafed Aunng- Zebe i becaufetwoor three days after he had diftnilTed him, he made a rumor to be fpread abroad, that the AmbafTador had caufed the Ham-ftringsof the prefen ted Hor- fes to be Cut) And the Ambaffador being yet upon the Frontiers, he made him return all the Indian Slaves which he carried along wkh him, of which he had a prodigious number. Mean while, Aureng-Zebe was not fo much concern’d, nor troubled himfelf fo much with this AmbafTador, as Cbah-Jeban, upon a like occafion, did with him, that was fent to him from the great Cbah*Abbas. When the Ferfans are in the humor of Rallying againft the Indians, they relate thefe three or four little Stories of them ; They fay, That Chab-Jeban feeing that the CourtQiip and Promifes made to their Am- baffador were not able to prevail with him, fo as to make him perform his Salute after the Indian Mode, hedevifed this Artifice i he commanded to (hut the great Gate of the Court of the Arnty, where he was to receive him, and to leave only open the Wicket, through which one man could not pafs but very difficultly, by hooping and holding down his Head, as the fafhion is, when one maketh an Indian Reverence, to the end that it might be faid, he had made the AmbafTador put bimfelf in a pofture, which was fomething lower than the Indian or Salute i but that that Ambaffa- dor being aware of this trick, came in with his Back foremoft: And that Cbab-Jeban y out of indignation to fee himfelf catch’d, told him , Eh Bed-baty , 1 bete fTretcb, doji thou tbin\ thou comefi into a Stable of Ajfes, fetch or thou art ? And that the AmbafTador, without any alteration , anfwer’d, Who would not thinly fo , feeing fetch a little Door 2 Another ftory is this i That at a certain time Chah-Jehan taking ill fume coarfe and fierce Anfwers return’d to him by the Ferfian Ambaffador, could not hold to tell him, What, hath Chah-Abbas no other men at his Court, that he muft fend to me fitch a Fool at thy felf 2 And that the Amhaffador anfwer’d, He hath many better and wifer than me, but to fetch a King, fetch an Ambaffador. They add, That on a certain day Chah- Jeban, who had made theAmbaffador to dine in his Prefence, and fought fome occa fion to affront him, feeing that he was bufie in picking and gnawing of Bones, asked him fmiling , Eh Eltchy-Gi, My Lord Ambaffador , What jhall the Vogt eat 2 And that he anfwer’d readily,jfGcbo3/,that is,a Difh of PulfejwhicRis the food of the meaner fort of People, and which he faw Chah-Jehan eat, becaufe he loved it. They fay alfo. That Chah-Jehan once asked him, What he thought of his new Dehli (which he was building) in comparifon of Hifpahan ? And that he anfwefd aloud, and with an Oath, Billah, Billah, Hifpahan doth not come near the dujl of Dehli *, which Cbab-Jehan took for a high Commendation, though the Ambaffador mocked him,be caufe the duft is fo troublefomat Dehli. Lafily, They relate that Chah-Jehan one day preffing him to tell him. What he thought of the Grandeur of the Kings of compared to that of the Kings of Ferfia 2 HeanfwerM , fhat, in his opinion, one could not better compare the Kings of In* aia than to a large Moon of 15 or 16 days old, and thofe of Perfia, to a fmall Moon of two or three days. And that this Anfwer did at firft pleafe Chah- Jehan, but that foon af ter he perceived, that that Comparifon did him but little honour, the Ambaffador’s fence being, that the Kings of Indoftan were decreafing, and thofe of Ferfia in- creafing. Whether thefe Points are fo commendable, and fuch marks of Wit, every one is bee to judge, as he feeth caufe. My opinion is, That a difereet and refpe&amp;ful Gra** vity is much more becoming Ambaffadors, than Rallery and Roughnefs, efpecially, 'vhen they have to do with Kings, who will not be rallied with, witnefs an Accident that befell this very Ambaffador j for Chah-Jehan was at length fo weary of him,and is freedom, that he called him no otherwife than Fool j and one day gave fecret or der, that when he ffiould enter into a pretty long and narrow Street, that is near the ortrefs, to come to the Hall of the Affembly, they ffiould let loofe upon him an ill- conditioned and fierce Elephant i and certainly, if the Ambafifador had not nimbly leapt out of his Faleky, and, together with his dextrous Attendants, (hot fome Arrows in to the Trunk of the Elephant, which forced him to turnback, he had been utterly fpoiled. vThe Hiftory of the Empire It was at this time, upon the departure of the Perfian Ambaffador, that Aunng. Zebt received with that admirable wifdom his Tutor M^//^*^/^theHihory of which is rare and confiderable. This old man, who long fince had retired himfelf towards Cabouf and fetled himfelf on fome Lands, which CM-had given him, had no fooner heard of the great fortune of Aureng-Zebe his Difcipline, who had overcome Vara and all his other Brothers, and was now King of Indoftan 3 but hfe came in hafte to the Court, fwelled with hopes of being prefently advanced tonolefs than the digni ty of an Omrab. He maketh his Court, and endeavors to engage all his Friends, and Raucbenara-Begum, the King’s Sifter, employs her felf for him. But yet there pafs three whole Months, that Aunng-Zebe does not fo much as feem to look upon him i till at length wearied to have him always at his Elbow, and before his Face, he fent for him to a place apart, where there was no body but Hakim-lul-Moithih 3 Danech- mend-kan, and three or four of thofe Omrahs, that pretend to Science, and then fpoke to him to this effed: C as I was informed by my Agab. ) What is it you would have of me Doctor ? Can you reafonably deftre I Jhould makg you one of tbe chief Omrahs of my Court? Let me tell you, if you had injimfied me as you jhould have done 3 nothing would he more jufi: For lam of thisperfipafion^ that a Child well educated and intruded 3 is as much, at lea(l , obliged to his Mailer as to bis Father: But where are thofe good Documents you have given me ? In the firfi place you have taught me, that all that Frangiftan ( fo it feems they call Europe ) was nothing , but 1 tyoro not what little Ifland, of which the greatefi King was he of Portugal, and next to him he of Holland, and after him he &lt;?/England i and as to the other Kings, as thofe 0/France and Andalufia? you have reprefented them to me as our petty Raja’s j telling me, that the Kings of Indoftan were far above them all together, and that they were the true and only Houma- jons, the Ekbars, the Jehan-Guyres, the Chah-Jehans, the Fortunate ones, the Great ones, the Conquerors and Kings of the World i and that Perfia and Usbec , Kach- guer, Tartar and Catay, Pegu, China, and Matchina did tremble at the name of the Kings of Indoftan : Admirable Geography l Tou jhould rather have taught m exactly to diftingmjh all theft different States of the world, and well to underjiand theirfirength, their way of fighting, their Cujloms, Religions, Governments and Interefis'■&gt; and by the per- ufal of folid Hiftory, toobferve their Rife, Progrefs, Decay, and whence, how, and by what accidents and errors, thofe great Changes and Revolutions of Empires and Kingdoms have happened, I have fcarce learnt of you the name of my Grandjires &gt; the famous founders of this Empire i fo far were you from having taught me the Hiftory of their Life, and what courfe they too\ to make fitch great Conquefts. Tou had a mind to teach me the Arabian Tongue, to read and to write, I am much obliged to you ( forfooth ) for having made me lofe fo much time upon a Language,that requires ten or twelve years to attain to its perfeftiotr, as if the Son of a King jhould thin\it to be an honour to him, to be a Grammarian, or jome Doftor of the Law, and to learn other Languages than thofe of his Neighbors,when he can not well be without them j he, to whom Time vs fo precious for fo many weighty things,which he ought by times to team. As if there were any jpirit that did not with fome reluttancy, and even with a kind of debafiment, employ it felf in fo fad and dry an exercife, fo longfotn and tedious, as is that of learning words, . Thbs fadi Aureng-Zebe refent the pedantidt Inftrudtions of his Tutor &gt; to which tis affirmed in that dourt, that after fome Entertainment which he had with others, he further added the following Reproof. .. c Know you not, that Childhood well govern’d, being a ftate which is ordinarily c accompanied with an happy memory, is capable of thoufands of good Precepts an 1 Inftru&amp;ions, which remain deeply imprefled the whole remainder of a man’s life, an ‘ keep the mind always raifed for great A&amp;ions ? The Law, Prayers, and Sciences, may c they not as well be learned in our Mother-Tongue, as in Arabic}^ ? You told my ra- c ther Cbah-Jehan, that you would teach me Philofophy. 3 Tis true, I remember very c well, that you have entertain’d me for many years with airy queftions, of things 11a ‘ afford no fatisfa&amp;ion at all to the mind, and are of no ufe in humane Society, empty ‘ Notions, and meer Phancies, that have only this in them, that they are very har to c underftand, and very eafie to forget, which are only capable to tire and fpoil a goo c underftanding, and to breed an Opinion that is infupportable. I ftill remember, t a c after you had thus amufed me, I know not how long, with your fine Philofopny, a ‘ I retained of iti was a multitude of barbarous and dark words, proper to bewi er,‘perplex, and tire out the beft Wits, and only invented, the better to cover the vani- £ ty and ignorance of men like your felf, that would make us believe, that they know c all, and that under thofe obfcure and ambiguous words,are hid great myfteries^which c they alone are capable to underhand : If you had feafon’d me with that Philofophy, 1 which formeth the mind to ratiocination, and infenfibly accuftoms it to be fatished 1 with nothing but folid Reafons i if you had given me thofe excellent Precepts and ‘Dodrines, which raife the Soul above theAffaults of Fortune, and reduce her to an ‘ unfliakeable and always equal temper, and permit her not to be lifted up by Profperi^ l ty, nor debafed by Adverb ty ^ if you had taken care to give me the knowledge of ‘ what we arc, and what are the firft principles of things i and had aififted me in form- c ing in my mind a fit Idea of the greatnefs of the Univerfe , and of the admirable c order and motion of the parts thereof &gt; if, I fay, you had inftilled into me this kind 4 of Philofophy, I fhould think my felf incomparably more obliged to you, than Alex- andir was to his Ariflotle &gt; and believe it my duty to recompence you otherwife,than c he did him. Should not you, infteadof your flattery, have taught me fomewhat of 4 that point fo important to a King, which is, what the reciprocal duties are of a So- 4 vcreign to his Subje&amp;s, and thofe of Subjects to their Sovereign ? And ought not you 4 to have confider’d , that one day I fhould be obliged with the Sword to difpute my ‘ Life and the Crown with my Brothers ? Is not that the defliny almofi ot all the Sons 4 of Indoftan? Have you ever taken any care to make me learn, what ’tis to befiege a 4 Town, or to fet an Army in Array ? For thefe things I am obliged to others, not at 4 all to you. Go, and retire to the Village whence you are come,and let no body know 4 who you are, or what is become of you. At that time there arofe a kind of Tempefl: againfl: Aftrologers, which did not dif- pleafeme. Moft people of Afia are fo infatuated by Judiciary Aerology ^ that they believe there is nothing done here below, but ’tis written above v for fo they fpeak. ) In all their Undertakings therefore they confult Aftrologers. When two Armies are ready to give Battel, they beware of falling on, till the Allrologer hath taken and de termined the moment he fancies propitious for the beginning of the Cpmbat. And fo, when the matter is about ele6ting a Captain-General of an Army, of difpatching an AmbaiTador, of concluding a Marriage, of beginning a Voyage, and of ooing any other thing, as buying a Slave, putting on new Apparel, €^c. nothing of all that is done, without the fentence of Mr. Star-Gazer'j which is an incredible vexation, an a cuftotn drawing after it fuch important confequences, that l know not how it can tu - lift fo long : For the Aftrologer muff needs have knowledge of all that pafleth, ant ot all that is undertaken, from the greateft Affairs to the leaft. ,, . . , But behold, it happen’d, that the prime Aftrologer of the King was drown d which occaiioned a great noife at Court, and was a great diferedit to Aitrology : for he be ing the perfon that determined the moments , of all Enterprizes and Actions tor the King, and the Omrabs, every one wondred, how a man lo experienced, and that for fo long time had difpenfed good Adventures to others, could not forefee his own mil- fortune. There were not wanting thofe, who pretended to be wifer than,others, and faid, that in Frangijian, where Sciences did flourifti, the Grandees do fufpect all luch kind of people, and that fome hold them even no better than Mountebanks, that us much doubted, whether this knowledge is grounded upon good and folid reaions, and that it may very well be fome fancy of Aftrologers,or rather an Artifice to make them- felves neceifary to the great ones,and to make them in fome meafure to depend on them. All thefe Difcourfes very much difpleafed the Aftrologers i but nothing 1 ^ em fo much as this Story, become very famous, viz. That the great Chah-Aaos King o er- fia, commanded to be digged and prepared a little place in his Seraglio to make a ar- den i that the young T rees were all ready, and that the Gardener made account o plant them the next day. Mean time the Aftrologer taking upon him, laid, a goo nick of time rcat to be obferved for -planting them, to makg them proffer. Cbab- emg content it ftiould be fo, the Star Gazer took his Inftruments, turned over his books, made his Calculation, and concluded, T-hat by reafon of fucb and fuch a Conjunc ion an Affect of the Planets, it was neceffary they Jhould be fet prcfently. The Mafter- ar ener&gt; who minded nothing lets than this Aftrologer, was not then at hand •, yet tor all tha , they fell to work immediately, making holes, and planting the Trees, im 0 felf fetting them, that it might be faid, that they were Trees fqt withCbab-A M s own hands. The Gardener returning at Night? was fufticiently amazed when he awThe Hiftory of the the work done *, and finding that the right place and order defigned by him, was not taken &gt; that, for Example, an Apricock- Tree fiood where an Apple-Tree Ihould hand, and a Pear-Tree where an Almond-Tree i being heartily angry with the Aftrologer, caufed all the Trees to be plucked up again, and laid them down, with fome Earth about them, for next morning, the time chofen by himfelfi The News hereof came foo'n to the Ears of the Aftrologer, who prefently told Cbab-Abas of it: He forthwith fent for theGardnerand with fome indignation asked hxmJVbat had made him fo bold,as to full up thofe Toung Erees be bad planted with bis own hand? That the time had been fo 'exafily taken for them, that fo good an one would never be had again &gt; and that fo he had marred all. The rude Gardener, who had a Cup of Chim-Wme in his head, look’d afide upon the Aftrologer, and grumbling and fwearing, (aid to him thefe words, Billah, Billah, that mu\\ needs be an admirable point of time whieh thou haji taken for tbefe Trees, Vnhappy Ajlrologer! They were planted this day Noon, and this Evening they have been plucked up again. When Chah-Abas hearcj this, he fell a laughing, turned his back upon the Aftrologer, and went away. I (hall here add two Particulars, though hapned in the time of Chah-Jeban, becaufe fuch things fall out often enough, anddo withall give occafion to obferve that ancient and barbarous cuftom, which makes the Kings of India Heirs of the Goods ot thofe that die in their Service. The firft was of Neikpam-kan, one of the molt ancient Om- rabs of the Court, and who for the fpace of 40 or 50 years, wherein he had always been employ’d in confiderable Offices, had heaped up great ftore of Gold and Silver. This Lord feeing himfelf near his End, and thinking upon this unreafonable cuftom, whieh often renders the Wife of a great Man, upon his deceafe, poor and miferable in an inftant, and neceifitates her to prefent a Petition,begging fome fmall Peniion for her fubfiftence, and for that of her Children, who are conftrained to lift themfelves for common Soldiers under fome Omrah, who, I fay, confidering this with himfelt, fecretly diftributed all his Treafure fo indigent Knights, and poor Widows, filled his Trunks with old pieces of Iron, old Shoes, Rags and Bones, and locked and fealed them, telling every body that they were Goods belonging to Cbah-Jeban the King. Thefe Trunks, after his death, were brought before Chah-Jd&gt;an, when he was in the Aftfembly, and by his command inftantly opened in the prefence of all xht Omrahs , that faw all this fine Stuff, which fo provoked and difeompofed Chah- Jehan, that he role in great fury, and went away. The other is only a piece of Gallantry. A rich Banean, or Heathen Merchant, being a great Ufurer, ( as moft of them are ) who had always been in Employment, and in the Pay of the King, came to dye. Some years after his death, his Son did extremely importune the Widow, his Mother, to let him have fome Money : She finding him to be a prodigal and debauched Vouth, gave him as little as (he could. This young fool, by theperfwafion of others like himfelf, made his Complaints to Chah-Jehan, and was fo filly, as to difeover to him all the Goods his Father had left, which amounted to Two hundred thoufand Rupies, or Hundred thoufand Crowns. Chah-Jehan , who foon got an itch for this Treafure, fent for the Widow, and commanded her in the, open Affembly to fend him an Hundred thoufand Rupies, and to give Fifty thoufand to her Son, giving order at the fame time to put her away. The old Woman, though furprized at this Command, and perplext enough, that fhe was fo fuddenly thruft out, without the liberty of fpeakin^, yet loft not her judgment, but with a loud voice gave out, That ffie had fomething of moment to difeover to his Majefty : Whereupon be ing brought in again, fhe faid, God fave your Majefty j I find that my Son hath fome rea- fon to demand of me the Goods of his Father, as being of his and my flop and blood, and therefore our Heir j but I would gladly kpow, what Kindred your Mayfly is to my deceafed Husband, to be his Heir. When Chah-Jehan heard fo plain a piece of Rallery, and a difeourfe of Parentage of the King of the Indies, with a She-Banian, or Idolatrous She-Merchant, he could not hold laughing, and commanded fhe fhould be gone , and that nothing fhould be asked of her. But to return,! fhall not relate all the other confiderable things that have happened fince the end of the War, that is, fince 1660. unto my departure, which was above b* years aft- r s though doubtlefs that would tend much to the defign I had in relating the other Particulars, which is, to make known the Genius and Temper of the Mogols and Indians. This I may do in another place : Here l fhall only give an Account of five °r fix Particulars, which thofe that fhall have read this Relation,will doubtlefs be curiou^o.Thethat though Aureng-Zebe made Ch ah-Jeh an his Father, to be kept in the Fortrefsof Agra with all imaginable care and caution * yet notwithhanding he ftill left him in his old Apartment with Begum-SahebJnis eldeft Daughter, his other Women, Singers, Dancers, Cooks, and others, nothing of that kind was wanting to him. There were alfb certain Mullahs^ that were permitted to come and to read the Alcoran to him (for he was become very devout.) And when he thought ht,there were brought before him brave Horfes, and tamed Gazelles ( which is a kind of Goat ) to make them fight with one another i as alfo divers forts of Birds of Prey, and feveral other rare Animals, to divert him as formerly. Aureng-Zebe himfelf ufed an Art to over come at laft his fiercenefs and obftinacy, which he had hitherto kept, though a Pri- foner. And this was the effedt of the obliging Letters, full of refpecS: and fubmififion, which he often wrote to his Father, confulting him often as his Oracle, and exprefiing a thoufand cares for him j fending him alfo unceffantly fome pretty Prefent or other, whereby Chah-Jehan was fo much gained, that he alfo wrote very often to Aureng-Zebe touching the Government and State Affairs, and of his own Accord fent him fome of thofe Jewels, which before he had told him of, that Hammers were ready to beat them to Powder the firft time he fhould again ask for them. Befides, he confented that the Daughter of T&gt;ara^ which he had fo peremptorily denied, fhould be deliver'd to him j and granted him at length that pardon and paternal bleffing which he had fo often defired without obtaining it. Yet, under all this, Anreng-Zebe did not always flat ter him j on the contrary, he fometimes return’d fharp Anfwers, when he met with ftrains in his Fathers Letters that were pregnant, or exprelfed fomethingof his former height and authority. Of this we may judge by the Letter, which l know from a very good hand was once written to him by Aureng-Zebe^ to this effed: : Sir, Ton would have me indijpenfably follow thofe ancient Cufoms^ and make my felf Heir to all thofe that are in my Pay with the wonted rigor : An Omrah^ and even a Merchant can no fooner dye, and fometimes even before his death, but we feal up his 'Trunks, and feize on his Goods, and make a fined enquiry into his Eft ate, imprisoning and ill-treating the Officers of the Houfe to difcover to us all he hath, even to the leaf Jewels* I will believe that there is fome policy in doing fo, but it cannot be denied, that dis very rigorous, and fometimes very unjuji , and to fpeak^ the very truth, we may deferve well enough, that the fame fhould befall us every day, what hapned to you from your Neikman-kan, and from the Widow of your rich Indian Merchant, Moreover ( faid he ) it feems, lam by you reputed proud and haughty now I am King : As if you kpew not by the experience of more than Forty years of your Feign, how heavy anOrnament a Crown is, and how many fad and rejilefs Nights it paffeth through : as if I could forget that excellent p off age of Mir-Timur , (commonly called T'&amp;mbtxXm ) which is fo ferioufly delivered to us by that great Grandfather of ours, Ekbar, to the end that we might the more weigh the importance and value of it, and confider, whether we have caufe to pride our felves fo much in a Crown, Tou well know, that he faid, that the fame day wheriTimur to^Bajazet, he made him come before him, and having fixed his eyes on him fell a laughing', at which Bajazet being highly offended, fiercely faid to him, Laugh not at my Fortune, Timur i know that ’tis God that is the Difpenfer of Kingdoms and Empires i and that the fame can befall you to morrow, that hath befallen me to day. Whereupon Timur made this ferious and brave Anfwer, I know as well as you, Bajazet,that ’tis God that difiributeth Kingdoms and Empires j I laugh not at your ill Fortune, God forbid Iftiould do fo: But beholding your face, l fmiled, and had this thought, That certainly thefe Kingdoms and Empires muff in themfelves be very little and contemptible things in the eyes of God, fince he giveth them to perfons fo ill made as you and I both are s a deformed one-ey’d man, as you j and a lame wretch, as my fclfi Tou require alfo, that abandoning all my other Employments, which I believe very neceffary for the efiabiifhment and happinefs of this State, I fhould think on nothing but Conquefis, and the enlargement of the Empiref I mufl confefs that this is indeed the bufintfs of a great Monarch, and of a Soul truly Koyal, and that Ifhould not deferve to be of the Blood of the Great Timur, if I were not of that mind, and had not fuch inclinations. Mean time, I think I fit not idle, and my Ar mies are not ufelefs in the Kingdoms of Decan and Bengale : But we mufi alfo aver, that the greatefiConquerors are not always the greatefi Kings') that we too often fee a Barbarian ma-^ k^ng Conquefis, and that thofe great Bodies of Conquefis do ordinarily fall of themfelves, and by thtir own weight. He is a great King, that kpows to acquit himfelf worthily of that Great and Augufl Employment and Charge of Kings, which is to difpenfe Jufiice to their Sub- jeftsfoc. The reft is not come to my hands. H 2 TheThe Hifiory of the Empre The fecond is in regard of the Etnir-Jemla. It were to injure this great Man, to paf s by with filence his deportment to Anreng-Zebe after the War, and the manner of end ing his days. This eminent perfon after he had difpatched the Adair of Bengale with Sultan Sujab (the fecond of thefe four Brothers) not like Gmk#n&gt; that infamous Tatan w'nb. Dara i nor like the of Serenagmr with Soliman-Chelyub i but like a Great Captain and dextrous Polititian, purfuing him as far as theSea-lide, and ne~ eeflitating him to fiy and to efcape out of his hands 5 after, I fay, he had done thefe things, he fent an Eunuch to Attreng-Zebe, intreating him, that he would give him leave to tranfport his Family to Bengale i that now that the War was at an end,and he broken with Age, he hoped he would grant him the advantage of ending his life i n the company of his Wife and Children. But Aureng-Zebe is too fliarp-fighted, not to pierce into the defigns of Emir, He feeth him triumphing over Sujab j he knows his great credit and reputation, and that he hath the efteem of a very wife, undertaking, valiant and rich man i and that the Kingdom of Bengale is not only the beft of all Indoftan, but ftrongof it felf, and fur ther, that this Emir is in the head of a well difciplin’d Army, which both honours and fears him. Befides, he is not ignorant of his ambition, and forefeeth well enough, that if he fhould have with him his Son Mabmet-Emirkan , he would afpire to the Crown, and at lead take full poffeflion of Bengale^ if he fhould not be able to ad vance things further. At the fame time he is alfo well aware, that, there is danger in refufing him, and that he may pollibly prove fuch a man, as in cafe of denial, may run into feme dangerous extream, as he had done in Golkonda* How then, think ye, did he carry himfelf in this conjundure ? He fends to him his Wife and Daughter, and all the Children of his Son : He maketh the Emir a Mir-Vl Omrab, which is in that Empire the greated degree of honour that a Favourite canberaifed to: And as to Mabmet-Emirhan, he maketh him the Great-Bakebps, which is a dignity and charge like that of our Great Mader of the Horfe, the fecond or third Office in the State, but fuch an one as abfolutely obligeth the pofTeffor of it to be always at the Court, not fuffering him, but very difficultly, to be abfent from the perfon of the King. The Emir foon perceived, that Aureng-Zebe had skilfully put by the droke, that it would be in vain the feccnd time to ask of him his Son &gt; that he could not do it with out offending him} and that therefore the fafed way would be to red contented with all the tedimonies of Friendfhip, and with all the Honours, together with the Go vernment of Bengale j being in the mean time always upon his guard, and in fuch a podure, that fince he could attempt nothing againd Aureng-Zebe (hould not be able to attempt any thing againd him. Thus have we feen thefe two Great Men carry themfelves to one another: And in this condition did affairs remain foralmod a yeari till Aureng-Zebe, too well know ing that a great Captain cannot be long at red, and that, if he be not employed in a Foreign War, he will at length raife a Domedickones propofed to him to make War upon that rich and potent Raja of Acbam, whofe Territories are on the North of Vake, upon the Gulf o{ Bengale. The Emir, who in all appearance had already de- hgned th*is fame thing of himfelf, and who believed, that the Conqued of this Coun try, would make way for his Immortal Honour, and be anoccafion of carrying his Arms as far as China, declared himfelf ready for this Enterprize. He embarked at l)akg with a puiffant Army, upon a River which comes from thofe parts i upon which having gone about an hundred Leagues North-Eadwardj he arrived at a Cadle cal led Azo, which the Raja of Acbam had ufurped from the Kingdom of Bengale, and poffeffed for many years. He attacked this place, and took it by force in lefs than hfteen days j thence marching over Land towards Chamdara, which is the Inlet into the Country of that Raja} he entred into it after 26 days journey, dill Northward: There a Battel was fought, in which the Raja ofAchamwas worded, and obliged to retreat to Guerguon, the Metropolis of his Kingdom, four miles didant from Cbamdara. The Emir purfued him fo clofe, that he gave him no time tofortide himfelf inGm- gmn : For he arrived in fight of that Town in five days, which condrained the Tap, feeing the Emir’s Army, to fly towards the Mountains of the Kingdom of Lajfa, and to abandon Guerguon, which was pillaged, as had been Chamdara. They found there vafl riches, it being a great, very fair and Merchant-like Town, and where the Wo men are extraordinarily beautiful. Mean time, the feafon of the Rains came in foonerof the M O G O L. (boner than ufually* and they being exceffive in thofe parts, and overflowing all the Countrey, except fuch Villages as hand on raifed ground, the Emir was much em- baraffed. For the Raja made his people of the Mountains come down from all .pam thereabout, and to carry away all the provifions of the Field j whereby the£/»z&gt; 5 s Ar my ( as rich as 5 twas ) before the end of the rains fell into great heights, without being able to go forward or backward. It could not advance, by reafon of the Moun tains very difficult to pafs, and continually pelier’d with great Rains j nor retreat be- caufe of the like Rains and deep wayes i the Raja alfo having caufed the way to be digged up as far as to Cbamdara: So that the Emir was forced to remain in that wretched condition during the whole time of the Rain i after which, when he found his Army diftafted, tired out, and half ftarved, he was neceffitated'to give over the Defign he had of advancing, and to return the fame way he was come. But this Re treat was made with fo much pains, and fb great inconveniencies, by reafon of the dirt, the want of Vi&amp;uals, and the purfuit of the falling on the R.ear,that every body (but he) that had not known how to remedy the diforder of fuch a March, nor had the patience to be fometimes five or fix hours at one pafTage to make the Soul- diery get over it without confufion, would have utterly perifh’d, himfelf, Army, and all j yet he, notwithftanding all thefe difficulties and obftacles, made a fhift to come back with great honour and vaft riches. He defign’d to return thither again the next year, and to purfue his undertaking, fuppofing that Azo^ which he had fortified, and where he left a flrong Garrifon, would be able to hold out the reft of the year againft the Raja. But he was no fooner arrived there , but Fluxes began to rage in his Army : Neither had himfelf a body of Steel more than the reft i he fell ftek and died, whereby Fortune ended the juftapprehenfions of Aureng-Zebe. I fay, the Jujl appre- henfions; for there was none of thofe that knew this great man, and the ftate of the affairs of Indoftan^ who did not fay, Tis this day that Aureng-Zebe is King of Bengdle. And himfelf could not forbear to exprefs feme fuch thing j for he publickly fa id to Mahmet-Emir-kan--&gt; You have loft your Father, and I the greateft and the moft dan gerous Friend I had j yet notwithftanding he comforted this Son, and withal affured him, that he would ever be a Father to him. And whereas ’twas thought, that he would at leaft cut off his Salary, and make Inquifition into hisTreafury, he confirmed him in his Office of Bakchit, augmented his Penfion to a thoufand Rupies a month, and left him Heir of all the Eftate of his Father, although the Cuftom of the Country empower’d him to feizc on all. The third is concerning Cbah-be(l-kan y whom Aureng-Zebe made firft Governour of Agra^ when he went out to the Battel of Kadjom againft Sultan Sujah i and after ward, Governour and General of the Army in Decan j and at laft, after the death of Emir-Jemla^ Governour and General of the Army in Bengale , together with the charge of Mirul Omrah which Emir-Jemla had poffeffed. This Cbab-bejRkan is he, whom in our Hiftory we have mention’d as Uncle to Aureng-Zebe, and one that hath fo much contributed to his happinefs by his eloquent and skilful pen, as well as by bis intrigues and counfels. It would be injurious to his Renown alfo, to be filent of the important enterprife, which he undertook prefently when he entred upon his Government i and that the rather, becaufe Emir-Jemla, whether out of Policy, or for anothercaufe, had no mind to tempt him , as alfo, becaufe the particularities, which I am going to relate, will ffiew not only the paffed and prefent ftate of the Kingdoms of Bengale and Raban, which hitherto hath not been well deferibed to us by any j but alfo fome other things that are worth knowing. To the end therefore that the importance of Cbah-heft-tyiri’s attempt may be well underftood, and a good Idea be had of what paffeth about the Gulf of Bengalee we are to know, that thefe many years there have always been in the Kingdom of Rakan °r Moy, fome Portuguefes, and with them a great number of their Cbriftian Slaves, and other Erangm, gather’d from all parts, ‘that was the refuge of the Run-aways from Goa* Ceil an. Cochin, Malague, and all thofe other places, which the Portuguefes formerly held in the Indies j and they were fuch as had abandoned their Monafteries, men that had been twice or thrice Married, Murtherers: In a word, fuch as had de- fervedthe Pvope, were moft welcome and moft efteem’d there, leading in that Coun try a life that was very deteftable , and altogether unworthy of Chriftians , info- much that they impunely butchered and poifoned one another, and affaftinared their ownThe Hiftory of the Empire own Priefts, who fometimes were not better than themfelves. The King of Rafyn in the apprehenfion he hath ever had of the Mogof kept them, for a guard of his Fron tiers, in a Port-Town called Chategon^ giving them Land, and liberty to live as they pleafed. Their ordinary Trade was Robbery and Piracy. With feme fmall and light Gallies they did nothing but coali about that Sea, and entring into all Rivers there about, and into the Channels and Arms of Ganges^ and between all thofe Lies of the lower Bengalee and often penetrating even fo far as fourty or fifty leagues up into the Country, furprized and carried away whole Towns, Alfemblies, MarketSi Feaftsand Weddings of the poor Gentiles, and others of that Country, making Women Slaves great and fmall, with ftrange cruelty \ and burning all they could not carry away. And thence it is, that at prefent there are feen in the mouth of Ganges fo many fine Hies quite deferted, which were formerly well peopled, and where no other Inhabi tants are found but wild Beads, and efpecially Tygers. This great number of Slaves, which thus they took from all quarters, behold what ufe they made of. They had boldnefs and impudence enough, to come and fell to that very Country the old people, which they knew not what to do with •&gt; where it fo fell out, that thofe who bad efcaped the danger by flight, and by hiding themfelves in the Woods, labour’d to redeem to day their Fathers and Mothers, that had been taken .yefterday. The red they kept for their fervree to make Rowers of them i and fuch Chridians as they were themfelves, bringing them up to robbing and killing j or elfc they fold them to the Portuguefes of Goa, Ceilan, St. Thomas, and others, and even to thofe that were remaining in Bengale at Ogouli, who were come thither to fettle them- felves there by the favour of Jehan-Guyre , the Grandfather of Aureng-Zcbe, who fuffered them there upon the account of Traffick, and of his having no averfion to Chridians, as alfo becaufe they promifed him to keep the Bay of Bengale clear from all Pyrates. And it was towards the Ide of GaUes, near the Cape of Palmes, where this fine Trade was. fThefe Pyrates lay there in wait at the paffage for the Portuguefes, who filled their Ships with them at a very eafie rate i this infamous Pvabble impu dently bragging, that they made more Chridians in one year, than all the Milfio- naries of the Indies in ten i which would be a drange way of enlarging Chridianity. Thefe were the Pyrates that madt Chah-Jehan, who was a more zealous Mabutrn- tan than his Iathtx Jehan-Guyre, to exprefs at lad his pallion, not only againft the Reverend bathers the Jefuits, Midionaries of Ag/a, in that he caufed to be pulled vdowm the bed part of a very fair and large Church that had been built, as well as that of Labor, by the favour of Jehan-Guyre, who as l faid, did not hate Chrifiiani- ty » an d upon which there dood a great Steeple with a great Bell in it, whofe found mighty be heard over all the Town , not only, I fay, againd thofe Jefuits, but alfo againd the Chridians of Ogouli: For being impatient to fee them connive at the Pyrates, to make the name of the Franguis formidable, and to fill their houfes with Slaves that were his own Subjedfs, he waded and utterly ruined them, after he had both with fair words and menaces drawn from them as much money as he could: And becaufe they were indifcreetly obdinate, in refufing what he demanded of them, he befieged them, and caufed them all to be brought to Agra, even their very Chil dren, their Prieds and Friers. This was a mifery and a defolation not to be paral lel! d i a kind of Bahtljunian tranfmigration. There they were all made Slaves: The handfom Women were (hut up in the Seraglio, the old Women and others were didributed among divers Omrahs. The young Lads were circumcifed , and made an ^ rTien a ^ e renouncec ^ f° r t he mod part their Faith, either terrified by the threatnings they heard daily, that they fhould be trampled upon by Elephants, or drawn away by fair Promifes. 5 Tis true, that there were feme of thofe Friers, who perfided, and that the Miffionaries of Agra, who notwithdanding all this un- happinefs, remained in their houfes, found means afterwards, partly by Friends, part ly by Money, to get many of them away, and to have them conveyed to Goa, and to other places belonging to the Portuguefes. They were alfo the fame Pyrates, who feme time before the defolation of Ogouli, offered to the Vice-Roy of Goa to put the whole Kingdom oERahan into their hands tor the King of Portugal but he refufed, they fay, this offer,, out of arrogance and jealoufie, and would not fend thefuccours, which for that end was demanded of him by a certain Baflian Confalve, who had made himfelf head of thofe people, and was becomeof the MOG O L. become fo potent and confiderable, that he married one of the Kings Daughters •, be ing unwilling that it ihould be faid, that a man of fo mean Extradion as this Bafiian was, had done fucb a Mailer-piece. But it may be faid on this occaiion, that this is not much to be wondred at, confidering that the Portuguefes in the Indies by fuch a condud have divers times been faulty on the like occaiions, in Japan, in Pegu, in Tthiopia, and other places j not to mention, that by this way, and that perhaps by a juft Divine chailifement (as they all frankly confefs themfelvesj) they are become a prey to their Enemies, and fallen fo low in the Indies, that I know not whether they wiii ever recover there-, whereas formerly, before they were corrupted by vice and degenerated through pleafure, they made all others tremble in thofe partsi toraf- much as then they were brave and generous men, zealous for the Chriftian Religion, confiderable for gallant exploits and for riches j all the Indian Kings fecking 'their friendfhip. Bdides this, the fame Pyrates feized at that time on the lile of Sondiva, an advan tageous Poll to command a part of the Mouth oi Ganges: In which Ule a certain Augujlin Frier, a very famous man, a&amp;ed the King for many years, having taken a courfe, God knows how, to rid himfelf of the Commander of that place. Moreover, the fame Robbers took Snltan-Sujah at Dak,a , to carry him away in their Galeaffes to Kalian, as we related above, and found means to .open his Coffers and to rob him of good (lore of Jewels, which afterwards were fecretly, and at a very cheap rate, fold in Rak^in, mod of them being fallen into the hands of people that had no skill in them, and afterwards into the hands of the Hollanders , and others, who knew how to buy them up quickly, making thqfe fellows believe , that they were foft Diamonds, and that they would pay them according to the degrees of their, hard nefs. Laftly, They are they that for many years have given exercife to the Great Mogol in Bengak i having obliged him there to keep always Garrifons every where upon the Paffes, and a great Militia, and a Fleet alfo of Galeaffes to oppofe their courfes, and who, notwithftandingall this, have made fhift to make ftrange devalfations, and often to enter far into the Country, and to laugh at all the Souldiery of the Mogols t in regard they were become fo bold, and fo dextrous at their Weapons, and fo skilful in piloting their Galeaffes, that four or five of them duck not to fet upon fourteen or fifteen Mogolians, which they alfo a&amp;ually worded, and took or run aground. And upon thefe Pyrates Cbab hefi-kgn cad his eyes as foon as he came dnto Beng. le, taking a refolution to deliver the Country of this plague of people, that had fo long waded it i and defigning afterwards to pafs on, and to attack the King of Rahan, ac cording to the order of Aurenge-Zebe, who at any price had a mind to revenge the blood of Sultan-Sujab, and all his Family, that had been fo cruelly handled, and to teach that Barbarian, how the Blood Royal was to be regarded and ebeemed on any occafion whatfoever: Behold now with what dexterity Cbab hejl-hja carrierh on this defign! Knowing that ffis impoffible topafs any Cavalry by Land, no not lo much as any Infantry, from Bengale into Rakan, becaufe of the many channels and rivers upon the Frontiers-, and alfo that on the other fide, thofe Pyrates of Cbatigon, whom we jud now were (peaking of, would be powerful enough to hinder him from tranfporting them by Sea j he thought upon this experiment, viz. to engage the Hollanders in his defign. He therefore fent a kind of Ambaffador to Batavia , empowering him to treat upon certain Conditions, with the General of that Company, joyntly to fub- due the whole Kingdom of Rahgin j as formerly Cbab-Abbas fubdued that of Ormus, in conjunction with the Englijh. 1 he General of Batavia feeing the thing to be polfible, and that it was a means more and more to break the Portuguefes in the Indies, and that it would turn to a very good account to the Company, difpatch’d away two Men of War for Bengale, to favour the tranfportation of -the Mogolian Troops in Ipight of thofe Pyrates. But obferve what Cbab-beft-kjn did before thefe Men of War arrived : He equipped agreat number of Galeaffes, and many large Veffels to tranfport the Army i threatned the Pyrates, utterly to fpoil and ruin themi acquainted them with the defign of Aureng-Zebe upon that a potent Army of the Dutch was near, that they fhould think on themfelves and their families, if they were wife j and in a word, if they would abandon the fervice of the King of , and take that of A ur eng-The Hiftory of the Empire Jureng-Zebe, he would procure very good conditions for them,diftributeamongftthem as much Land in Bengale as they deiired, and pay them the double of what they had now. 3 Tis doubtful, whether thefe Menaces and Promifes made impreffion upon them, or whether it was not an Accident that moved them , they having about that time affaf- fallinated one of the chief Officers of the King of Katyn, and apprehending a punifli- ment for that Crime : However it be, they were caught, and they were one dayilruck with fuch apanick terror, that they fhippM themfelves all at once in forty or fifty of their Galealfes, and wafted over to Bengale to Cbah-befl-tyn, and that with fo much precipitation, that they hardly took time to embark their Wives and Children, and what elfe was mofl: precious to them. Cbab~he(l-tyn receiv’d them with open Arms, courted them exceedingly, gave them very confiderable Pay, and without letting them cool, made them, jointly with his whole Army, to attack and take thelfleof Sondiva, which was fallen into the hands of the King of Katyn, and thence to'pafs with all his Horfe and Foot to Cbatigon, About this time the two Holland Veffels arrived, but Cbab-beft-tyn, who thought that henceforth it would be eahe for him to compafs his delign, thanked them. I faw thefe Ships in Bengale, and their Commanders, who were but little contented with fuch thanks and liberalities of Cbab-hefl-tyn. As to the Pyrates, fince now he holds them faft, and hopelefs of ever returning to Cbatigon,md Lath no more need of them, he makes nothing of all thofe large Promifes he made them, and treats them not as he ffiould, but as they deferve, leaving them whole months without Pay, and not looking upon them otherwife thanTraytors, and infa mous men, unfit to be trufted, after they have fo vilely deferted him, whofe Salt they had eaten fo many years. After this manner did Cbab-be(i-tyn put an end to this Rabble, which, as I faid, have ruined and difpoiled all the lower Bengale. Time will fhew whether he will be as happy in the remainder of hisEnterprize againfi the King of Katyn. The fourth Particular is concerning the two Sons of Aureng-Zebe, va. Sultan Mah moud, and Sultan Mazum. He ftill keeps the firft of them in Goualeor, but (if one may believe the common report ) without making him take the Pouf, which is the ordinary Drink of thofe that are put into that place. As to the other, though he hath always been a pattern of refervednefs and moderation, yet one knows not whether he was not too forward in making a Party, when his Father was fo extremely fickj or whether Aureng-Zebe have not upon other occafions perceiv’d fomethingthat might give him caufe of jealoufie or whether he had not a mind to make an authentick proof of both his Obedience and Courage. However it be, one day he commanded him in an unconcerned manner, in a full Affembly of theOmrabs, to go and kill a Lyon that was come down to the Mountains, and had made great havock and wafie in the Countrey &gt; and this he did, without giving order to furniffi him with thofe firong and large Nets, which they ar$ wont to employ in this dangerous kind ol hunting in a real mnodi telling the great Hunting-Mafter, who prefently call’d for thofe Nets,that when he was Prince, he did not look for fuch Formalities. It was the good fortune of Sultan Mazum, that he profper’d in this Attempt, not lofing any more than two or three men, and fome Horfes that were wounded, although, on the other hand, the matter went not off fo pleafantly, the wounded Lyon having leapt up to the head of the Sultan’s Elephant. Since that time, Aureng-Zebe hath not been backward to ex- prefs much Affection to him, he hath given him even the Government of Vecan, though with fo little power and treafure, that there is no great caufe to apprehend any thing upon that Account. The fifth thing touchcth Mohabet-tyn, the Governor of Kaboul, whom Aureng- Zebe took from his Government, and generoufly pardon’d * not willing, as he faid, to lofe fo brave a Captain, and that had lluck fo clofe to his Benefactor Chab-Jehan. He .made him even Governor of Guzuratte, in the place of Jeffomfeigne, whom he fent to make War in Vecan. It may very well be, that fome coniiderable Prefents he made to Kaucbenara-Begum, and a good number of excellent Perftan Horfe and Camels, where with he prefented Aureng-Zebe, together with fifteen or fixteen thoufand Eupies or Gold, did contribute to make his peace. On this occafion of mentioning the Government of Kaboul, which borders upon the Kingdom of Kandahar, which is now in the hands of the Perfians, I (hall here brieflybriefly add fome particulars, that ferve to this Hiftory,and will hill more diicover that Country, and declare the Interefts between Indojtan and Perfia, which no body, that I know of, hath explained hitherto. • 1 Kandahar, that flrong and important place, which is the Capital and the fwaying Ci ty of this Noble and Rich Kingdom of the fame Name, hath in thefe latter Ages been the fubjedt of grievous Wars between the Mogols and Perfians, each of them pretend ing a Right thereto. El$ar&gt; that great King of the Indies, took it by force fr6m the Perfians, and kept it during his life. And Chah-Abbas, that famous King of retook it from Jehan-Guyre-i the Sort of Ekfcar., Afterwards it return’d to Chah-Jehan Son of Jeban-Guyre, not by the Sword, but by the means of the Governor Aly-Mer» dan-fyn, who furtendred it to him, and went over to live at his Court, apprehending the Artifices of his Enemies, who had brought him into disfavour with the King of Perfia, that fent for him to make him give an accompt, and to deliver up his Govern ment. The fame City was befieged, and retaken afterwards by the Son of Chab-Ab bot, and fince that befieged twice again, yet without being taken by Chah-Jehan. The firft time it was faved from being taken by the ill underftanding and jealoufie between the Perfian Omf ahs, that are Penfioners of the Great Mogol, and the moft powerful of his Court, asalfo by the refped they bear to their Natural King: For they all behaved themfelves very effeminately in the Siege, and would not follow the Raja Roup, who had already planted his Standards upon the Wall on the fide of the Mountain. The fecond time it was faved by the jealoufie of Aureng-Zebe, who would not fall into the breach of the Wall, that our Eranguls, the Englijh, Portuguefes, Germans and French had made by their Canon, though it was a large one j being unwilling to have it faid, that in the time of Vara, who was, in a manner, the firft mover of that Enterprife,and was then in the City of Caboul, with his Father theFortrefs oi Randa^ bar was taken. Chah-Jehan, fome years before the late trouble, was alfo ready to be- fiege it the third time, had mtErnir-Jemla diverted him from it, advifing him to turn his Forces towards Vecan, ( as hath been faid j ) with whom Aly-Merdan-kpn himfelf concurred, who was To earneft in his diffwading him from it, as to fay to him thefe words, which I fhall punctually relate, as having fomething extravagant in them: Tour Majefty will never take Kandahar, unlefs you had fuch aTraytor there at my felfi except you were refolved never to bring a Perfian into it, and to makg the Bazars or Markets wholly free, that it, to lay no Impojl on thofe that furnijh the Army with pro* vifiofo i '' # .. f * • ' . r • ' . . ’&lt; At length, Aureng-Zebe, like the others, had prepared himfelf in thefe latter years to befiege it alfo &gt; whether it was that he was offended at the tart Letters, written to him by the King of Perfia, or by reafon of the affronts and ill treatment which he had offer’d to Tarbiet-hgn his Ambaffador Mhat hearing of the King of Perfia's death, he turned back, faying, ( which yet is not very credible ) that he would not meddle with a Child,' a new King* although-C/^'^/iw^«, who hath fucceeded his Father, is, in my opinion, about 25 years of age. The fixth particular wepurpofed to fpeakof concerns thofe that have faithfully fer- ved Aureng-Zebe. Thofe he hath almoft all raifed to great places. For firft, as we have already related, he made Chah-heft-kyn, his Uncle, Governor and General of the Army of Vecan, and afterwards, Governor of Bengale. Next, he made Mir-kan Governor of Kaboul i Then Kalil-ullah-kpn, of Labor &gt; and Mirbaba, of Elabos » and Lasker-katt, of Patna. The Son of that AUah-Verdi-kan of Sultan Sujah, he appointed Governor of Scimdy, and Fazel-kan, who had confiderably feifv’d him both by his counfels and dexterity, he made Kane-faman, that is, Great Steward of the Houfe Royal: And Va~ nechmend-kgn. Governor of Vehli, with this particular grace and priviledge, that fince he is perpetually employed in ftudies and foreign Affairs, he fo difpenfeth with him for not coming twice a day ( after the ancient cuftom ) to wait on the King in the Affem- bly, as not to retrench any thing of hispenfion for his abfence, as he doth to the other Omrahs, if they fail. He hath given to Viamt-kpn the Government of Kacihmer (alias Cafmere ) that little, and in a manner inacceflible Kingdom, which Ekfrar fei- zed on by craft, that earthly Paradife of the Indies y which hath its Hiftories written in its peculiar Language, whereof I have an abridgment in the Perfian Tongue, made by the command oT Jehan-Guyre, containing a large Catalogue of many very ancienf - ' ■ I ' , . Kings,5 * The Hifloryof the Empire Kings, that often were fo powerful, that they fubdued the Indies as far as China. 3 Tis true, that Aureng-Zebe difmiffed Nejabat-kgn, who did very well in the two Battels of Samonguer and Kadjoue, but then ’tis not fit at^ all, that a Sufijcft ftiould ever reproach his King, as he did, with the fervices done him. ,, As to thofe infamous men, Gion-kan and Nazer, ’tis known, that the farmer hath been recompenced as he defervedj but the other no man knows what is become of him. . ' . - 1 . ' What concerns Jeffomfeigne and Jejfeigne^ there is fomething as to them that is intri cate, which Khali endeavour to unfold. There is a certain Heathen revolted from the King of Eifapourj who knew howto poffefs himfelf of many important Fortreffes,and of fome Sea-ports of that King. His name is Seva-Gi^ that is, Lord Seva. He is a flout man, vigilant, bold, and undertaking in the higheft degree, who gave Chah-kit- \an more work and trouble in Decani than the King of Vifapour with all his Forces, and all his Kama's joined with him for their common defence : Infomuch that having defigned to take away Cbah-heft-\an and his Treafures out of the midft of his Army, and of the Town Aurenge-Abad^ he carried on his defign fo far, that he had eftedfed it, if he had not been difcoveFd a little toofooni for one night, accompanied with a number of refolute Fellows he hath about him, he was got into the very apartment oi Chab-fieft-kgri) where his Son, who was forward in the defence, was killed, and himfdi grievouily wounded i Seva-Gi in the mean time getting away as well as became: Who for all this was fo far from beiag daunted, that he undertook another very bold and very dangerous Enterprife, which fucceeded much better. He took two or three Thou- fand chofenmen of his Army, with whom he took the Field without noife, fpreading a report by the way, that it was a Raja going to the Court. When he was near Sx- ratte^ that famous and rich Port of the Indies, inftead of marching further, (as he made the great Provoft of that Country, whom he met, believe) he fell into that Town, where he fiaid about three days, cutting off the Arms and Legs oi the Inha bitants, to make themconfefs where were the Treafures v fearching, digging, and load ing away, or burning what he could not carry with him. Which done, he returned, none oppofing his return, loaden with millions of Gold, Silver, Pearls, Silken Stuffs, Fine Linnen, and other rich Merchandife. Jeffbmfeigne was fufpe&amp;ed to have had fince intelligence with this Seva-Gi, which was the caufe that Aunng-Zebe called him away iiomDecan’i but he, infiead of going to Debit, went to his. own Territory. I forgot to mention, that in the plunder of Suratte, that Ringleader like a Saint, had fo muchrcfped tathe Houfe of theReverend Father Ambrofe, a Miifionaiy CapHcian, that he gave order it ffiould not be plundered j becaufe, fate he, I know that the Fathers Frangm are good men. He had alfo regard to the Houfe of the deceaied de hale, becaufe he underftood that he had been great Almoner. He alfo confidefd the Houfes of the Englijb and Dutch, not from Devotion, as he did the former, but be caufe they were in a good pofture of defence* efpecially the Englijb;, who having had time to fend for affiftance from fome of their (hips that lay near the Town, behaved themfelves gallantly, and faved, befides their own, feveral other houfes near them. But a certain Jew of Cmjlantinople, who had brought Rubies of a very great value , to fell them to Aureng-Zebe, carried away the Bell from all, by faving himfelf bom the * bands of Seva-Gi‘, for,rather than to confefs that he had any Jewels, he was brought thrice upon his Knees, and the Knife held up to cut his Throat: But it became none Lave a Jew, hardly in Avarice, to efeape in fuch a manner. Touching Jeff eigne, Ring Aureng-Zebe made him content to go General of the Army in Decan, fending Sultan-Mazum with him, without any power. He prefently and vigoroully befieged the principal Fortrefs of Seva-Gi, and knowing more than all the * left in matter of Negotiation and Treaty, he fo order’d the bufinefs, that Seva-Gi fur- rendred before it came to extremity , and then he drew him to Aureng-Zebe’s party againft Vifapotir, King Aureng-Zebe declaring him a Raja, takipg him under his pro- te&amp;ion, and giving the Penlion of a very confiderable Omrab to his Son. Some time after, Aureng-Zebe defigning to make War againft Ferfta, wrote to Seva-Gi fuch obli ging Letters touching his Generofity, Ability andCondud:, that he made him refolve, upon the faith of Jeffeigne, to come to him to Debit. There a Kinfwoman of Aureng- Zebe, the Wife of Cbab-hejt-1{an, ( who was then at Court) by the influence ftie had upon the fpirit of Aureng-Zebe, perfuaded him to arreft him that had murder’d herSon, wounded her Husband, and fucked So that one evening Seva-Gi fa w his Pavilions befet with three or fourCW^j i but he made ihift to get away in the night® Thisefcape made a great noife at Court, every one accufing the elded Son of the Raja JeJJ'eigne to have aflided him in it. Jeffeigne-&gt; who prefently had news that Aunng-Zcbe was very angry with him and his Som and was advifed no more to go to the Court,was day and night upon his guard, apprehending led Aunng-Zebe ftiould take this for a pre tence to fall upon his Lands, and poifefs himfelf of them. Whereupon-he alfo foon left Vecan to fecure his Ellate &gt; but when he was at Brampour^ he died. Yet notwith- danding Aureng-Zebe was fo far from expreffing any coldnefs or refentment to the Son of Jejfeigne, that he fent to condole with him for the death of his Father, and con tinued to him his Penfion j which conrirms what many fay, that it was by the confent of Aunng-Zehe himfelf, that Seva-Gi efcaped, forafmuch as he could retain him no longer at Court, becaufe all the Women there had too great a fpleen againft him , and looked upon him as a man that had embroiled his hands in the blood of his Kinfmen. But to return to Vecan^ we are toconfider, that that is a Kingdom, which thefe For ty years hath conftantly been the Theater of War, and upon the fcore whereof the M?- gol hath much to do with the Kings of Golkonda, and of Vifapour, and divers little So- veraigns, which is not to be underftood r unlefs it Be known, *what confiderable things have palled in thofe Parts , arid the condition of the Princes that govern them. - ■ ' '■ ' All this great Peninfule of Indeftan, cutting it from the Bay of Catnbaja unto that of Bengak, near Jaganrate^ and palling thence to Cape Comorin was fcarce two hundred years fince entirely ( fome mountainous Parts excepted ) under the Dominion of one only Prince, who confequently Was a very great and very potent Monarch-: But nowit is divided among many different Soveraigns, that are alfo of different Religions. The caufe of this divilion was, that the King Ramm, the lari of thofe that have polTefTed this mighty State entirely, did imprudently raife threeBlave-s, Gurgis^ he had about him too high, fo as to make them all three Governors of places: The firfi , of the gre&amp;teft part of thofe Countries, which at prefent are polTelTed by the iMogol in Deem, about Vanlet-Abad^ from Bider^ Paranda, Suratte^ unto Narbadar: The fecond , of all the other. Lands, now comprehended under the Kingdom of Vifapour : And the third , of all that is contained under the Kingdom of Goltynda, Thefe three Slaves grew very rich, and found themfclves fupported by a good number of the Mogols, that were imthe fervice of Ramras^ becaufe they wete all three Mahwnetans, ot the Se6fc ChyM, like the Perfians. And at length they all revolted together with one accord,kil led King Ramm, and return’d to their Government, each taking ujxm him the Title of Cbah ot King. The HTue of Ram^y not finding themfelves flrong enough for them, were content to keep themfelves in a corner, viz. in that Country which is com monly call’d Karnateks in our Maps, Bifnaguer, where they are dill Rajas to this very day. All the reft of the State was alfo at the fame time divided into all thofe Raja's Naiques, and petty Kings, fucH as we fee there. Thefe three Slaves and their Pofteri- ty have always defended themfelves very well in their Kingdoms,: whil’ft they kept a good mutual Correfpondence, and affifted one another in their grievous Wars againft the Mogols. But when they once came to think every one to defend their Lands aipaf t, they foon found the effects of thek divifion. For the Mogol fo well knew to take his time upon that occafion, ( which is ndw about Thirty five, or Forty years fince ) that he poffefs’d himfelf within a little time of all the Country of Nejam-Cbab , or King Nejaniy the fifth or fixthof the Family of the firft Slave, and at laft took him Prifoner in Daulei-Abady the Capital, where he died. &gt; v &lt; • After that time, the Kings of Golkonda have maintain’d themfelves well enonghi not as if they could compare with the power of the Mogoly but becaufe the Mogol hath always been employ’d againft the two others i from whom he was to take Ambery Pa- randay Bidery and fome other places, before he could conveniently march towards Gol- kynda. And becaufe they have always been fo politick, being very opulent, as to fur- nifti under-hand the King of Vifapour With Money, and thereby to help him to main tain a War againft the Mogol : Befides that,they ever have a confiderable Army on foot* which is always ready, and never fails to take the Field, and to approach to the Fron tiers, at the time when there is News that that of the Mogol marches zgaiviR Vifapour &gt; to let the Mogol fee, not only that they are always ready to defend themfelves, but alfo that they could eafily affift the King of Vifapour^ in cafe he (hould be reduced to any ex- I 2 tremity.* \ 60 ' 'The Hiflory of the Empire tremity. Next, which is very confiderable, they know alfohow to convey Mony un derhand to the Chieftains of the Mogolian Army ^ who thereupon advife the Court, that it is more to purpofe to ztt3.ch Eifapouv^ as being nearer to T)auht-Abad. Fur ther, They fend every year very confiderable Prefents to the Great Mogof by v/ay of Tribute, which confift partly in fome rare Manufadures of the Country-, partly in Elephants, which they fend for from Eegu^ Siam^ zn^Geilan^ partly in fair ready ma ny. Laftly, The Hogol confiders that Kingdom as his own, not only becaufe he looks upon the King thereof as his Tributary, but chiefly iince that Agreement heretofore fpoken of, which the prefent King made with when he belicg’d Golkpnda-, and there beingalfo no place able to refift, even from Vanlet-Abad unto Goltynda , hd judgeth, that when he (hall think fit to pufhfor it, he may take in the whole Kingdom in oneCampagne &gt; which, in my opinion, he would certainly have done, if he did not apprehend, left fending his Forces towards the King of Vifapour (houkl en ter into Decan j as, no doubt, he would do, knowing it to be very important to his Confervation, that that Kingdom may always fubiift as now it is. From all which, fomething may be underflood of the In te re As and Government of the King of Golkgnda with the Mogof and what way he taketh to fupport himfelf againft him. Yet notwithftanding afi this, I And this State much (haken, in regard that the King that now is, lince that unhappy Adair of Aureng-Zebe and Emir-Jemla, feemstohave loft heart, and as 5 twere abandon’d the reins of the Kingdom,not daring anymore to-'go forth of thisFortrefs of Golkpuda, nor fo much,as appear in publickto give Audience to his People, and to render juitice,according to the cuAom of the Coun try: Which difcompofeth things very much, and occafions the Grandees to tyrannize over the meaner fort of People, and to lofc even their refped: to the King,often flight ing his Commands, and confidering him no more than a Woman i and the People, weary of the injuflice and ill treatment, breathing after nothing but Attretig-Zehe. Tis eafie to judge of the Areights this poor King is in, by four or five Particulars I am about to relate. Thefirff, that Anno 16 Sj. when I was at Golhgnda, King Aureng-Zehe having fent an ^mbaflfador Extraordinary to declare War to tflat King, unkfs he would furnifli him with Ten thoufand Horfe againft Vifapour ^ he did extraordinary honour, and give exceflive Prefents to that Ambaffador, as well for him in particular, as for Aumig- Zehe^ and made an agreement with him, to fend him, not Ten thoufand Horfe, but as much Mony as is neceflfary to maintain fo many i which was all that Aureng-Zebe look ed for. The fecond is, That Aureng-Zebe's AmbafTador in Ordinary, that is conffantly at Golkpnda, commands, threatens, ftriketh, gives Pafs-ports, and faith and doth vvhat- foever he will, no man daring with the leaft word to crofs him. The third is. That Mahmet-Emir-kan , the Son of Emir-Jemla, though he be no more than a Ample Omrah of Aureng-Zebe^ is yet fo much refpecfted through that whole Kingdom, and efpecially in Ma/lipatan, that the Eaptata^ his Commillioner, is, as ’twere, Mafter thereof, buying and felling, bringing in and fending abroad his Mer chants Ships, no Body daring to contradidf him in any thing, nor to demand any Cuftoms. So great was once the power of Etnir-Jemla his Father in this Kingdom, which time hath not yet been able to root out. The fourth is, That the Hollanders fcrupk not to threaten him fometimes, to lay an Embargo upon all the Merchants Ships of the Country that are in that Port, and not to let them go out, until their demands be grafted &gt; as alfo to put in ProteAations againft him : which I have feen adually done, upon the account of an Engltjb Vdfel, which they had a mind to take by force in the Port of Maflipatan it felf, the Gover nor having hindred it, by arming the whole Town againft them, and threatning to put Fire to their Fa&amp;ory, and to put them all to death. A fifth is, That the Portuguefes, as poor, and miferable, and decayed, as they are in the Indies, yet fticknot to threaten that King alfo with War&gt; and that they will come and fack Majlipatan, and all thatCoaft, if he will not render them that place of St. Thomas, which fome years ago they chofe to put into his hands, rather than to be conftrained to yield it up to the Dutch, J Yet for all this, I have been informed in Golkonda, by very intelligent perfons, tjiat this King is a Prince of very great judgment, and that whatever he fo does and fuf- fers, is only in policy, to the end to provoke no body, and principally to remove all fufpidon 'fufpition from Aureng-Zebe, and to give him to underftand, that he hath in a manner no fhare any more in the Kingdom : But that in the mean time a Son of his, that is kept hid, grows up, the Father watching for a fit time to declare him King, and f 0 to laugharthe Agreement made with Aurerfe-Ztbe. Of this, rime will (hew us more ; in the mean time, let us confider fomcwhat of the Intercfts of Vifapour. The Kingdom of F/p^w i^ath alfo not been wanting to fupport it felf, though the Mogol do almoff continually make War againft it *, not fo much as if he of Vifapour were able to bid head to the Mog&amp;lian Forces, but becaufe there is never any great effort ufed againft him. For it is not very frequent there, no more than ’tis elfewhere for Generals of Armies to defire the end of a War •, there being nothing fo charming, as to be in the head of an Army, commanding like little Kings, remote from the Court It isalfo grown to a Proverb, That ZW is the Bread and Life of the Soldiers of In- dojlan. Befides, the Country of Vifapour is on the fide of the Mogol's Dominions of a very difficult accefs, upon the account of the fcarcity of good Waters, Forage, and Vi&amp;uais i and becaufe Vifapour, the Capital City, is very ftrong, and fituate in a dry and fieril Country, there being almoft no good Water but in the Town. And hil ly , becaufe there are many Forfreffies in that Country , feated on Hills hard to climb. Yet notwithftanding all this, that State is much ffiaken, if confidering that the Mo* gol hath taken Paranda, the Key, as ’twere, of that Kingdom i as alfo that fair and ffrong Town Bider, and fome other very important places: But principally,becaufe the laft King of Vifapour died without Heirs Males, and he that now calls hrmfelf King, is a Youth, whom the Queen, Sifter of the King of Colbpnda , hath raifed, and taken for her Son ( a favour tor which he hath made an ill return, having (hew 5 d no efteern ^ for this Queen after her return from Mecca, under the pretext of fome ill demeanor in heron a Dmbh'VcM that carried her to M&gt;kj :) Laitly, becaufe that in the diforders of that Kingdom, the Heathen-Rebel, Seva-Gi, above difeourfed of, found means to fejze on many ftrorsg Holds, moftly feated on fteep Mountains, where he now adeth the King, laughing at the Vifapour, and the Mogol, and ravaging the Country everywhere from Suratte, even to the Gates of Goa, This notwithftanding, if he wrongs Z7p- pour one way, he helps to fupport it another, forafmuch as he is refolutely bent 3 againft the Mogol,' preparing always fomeAmbufti, and cutting fo much work for his Army, that there is no difeourfe, no apprehenfion but of Seva-Gi } infomuch that he hath come and lacked Suratte^ and pillaged the Ifle of Burdes, which belongs to the Portu- guefe, and is near the Gates of Goa. The feventh Particular, which I learn’d atGolkpnda, when I was come away from Dehli, is the death of ChakVfdjan *, and that Aureng-Zebe had been exceedingly aifedf- ed therewith, having difeover’d all the marks of grief, that a Son can exprefs for the lofs of his Father: That at the very hour of receiving that News, he went towards Agra j that Begum-Saheb caufed theMofquee, and a certain place, where he was at firft to flop, before he entred the Fortrefs, to be hung with richly embroider’d Tapifteries: That at his entring into the (he prefented him with a great Golden Bafon wherein were all her Jewels, and all thofe of Chah-Jeban \ a ( nd in (hort, that (he knew to receive him with fo much Magnificence, and t© entertain him with that dexterity and craft&gt; that ffie obtain’d his pardon, gain’d his favour, and grew verv confident with him. ' To conclude, I doubt not, but moftof thofe, who (hall have read my Hiftory, will judge the ways taken by Aureng-Zebe, for getting the Empire, very violent and horrid* I pretend not at all to plead for him, but defire only, that before he be altogether con demned, reflexion be made on that unhappy cuftom of this State, which leaving the fucceffion of the Crown undecided,' for want of good Laws, fetling it, as amongft us, upon the eldeft Son, expofeth it to the Conqueft of the ftrongeft, and the moft fortu- nate&gt; fubjeding at the fame time all the Princes born in the Royal Family, by the con dition of their Birth, to the eruel necellity either to overcome, or to reign, by deftroy- ing all the reft, for the affurance of their power and life, or to periffi themfelves, for the fficurity of that of others: For I am apt to believe, that upon this Confideration, the Reader will not find Aureng-Zeb fo ftrange as at firft it appear’d. How ever I am perfuaded, that thofe who (hall a little weigh this whole Hiftory,will not take Aweng-Zebe for a Barbarian, but for a great and rare Genius, a Great States-man, and a Great King. A Letter62 The Hifiory of the Empre A Letter to the Lord COLBERT, of the Extent o{ INDOS fAN ; the Circulation of Gold and _ Silver, coming at length to be fwallowed up, there, as in an Abyfs; the Riches, Forces, Juftice, and the principal Caufe of the Decay of the States of ASIA. My Lord, \ ' S ince it is the Cuftom of Afia, never to approach Great Perfons with Empty Hands, when I had the Honour to kifs the Vert of the Great Mogol Aweng-Zebe, I prefented him with eight Roupies^ £ A Roupy is about Half a Crown ] as an expreffion of refped: &gt; and the illuftrious Fazel-kan^ the prime Miniher of State, and he that was to eftablilh my Penfion as Phyfitian, with a Cafe of Knives garnilhed with Amber. My Lord, though I intend not to introduce new Cuftoms in France x yet I cannot forget this upon my Return from thofe Parts i being perfuaded, that Lought not to appear before the King, for whom I have a far deeper Veneration, than for^a- reng-Zebe j nor before Ton, my Lord, for whom I have a much higher Efteem, than for Fazel-tyn, without fome little Prefent to both, which is rare, at leaft, for its Novelty, though it be not fo upon the account of the prefenting hand. The Revolution of In- dojlan, by reafon of its extraordinary Occurrences and Events, hath to me feemed worthy of the Greatnefs of our Monarch, and this Difcourfe, for the quality of the matters therein contained, futable to the rank you hold in hisCounfelsi tothatCon^ dudf, which at my Return appear’d to me fo admirable in the Order, which I found fet- led in fo many things,that I thought incapable ofitj and to the paflionyou entertain to make it known to the Ends of the Earth, what a Monarch we have, and that the French are fit to undertake, and with Honour to atchieve, whatfoever you fhall have defign’d for their Honour and Advantage, ’Tis in the Indies, my Lord (whence I am lately return’d,after twelve years abfence) where I learn’d the felicity of France, and how much this Kingdom is oblig’d to your cares i and where your Name is fo diifufed, and fo well known. This were a fair Theme for me to enlarge upon i but my Defign being no other than to difcourfe of things New, I muft forbear to fpeak of thofe that are already fo notorious to all the World. I (hall doubtlefs pleafe you better, by endeavouring to give you f6me Idea of the hate of the Indies, which I have engaged my felf to give you an account of. My Lord, You may have feen before this, by the Maps of Afia, how great every way is the Extent of the Empire of the Great Mog*?/, which is commonly call’d India, or Indoftan. I have not meafufd it Mathematically j but to fpeak of it according to the ordinary Journeys of the Country, after the rate of three whole months march, tra- verfing from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of Gdtynda, as far as beyond Kazni near Kandahar, which is the firftTown of Verfta, I cannot perfuade my felf otherwife, but that it is at leaft five times as far as from Faris to Lyons, that is, about Five hundred common Leagues. Next, You may pleafe to take notice, that of that vaft Extent of Land, there are large Countries that are very fertil, and fome of them to that degree, ( for Example, that whole great Kingdom of Bengale) that they exceed thofe of Egypt, not only up on the account of the abundance of Rice,Corn, and all other things neceffary foi life* but alfo upon the fcore of all thofe Commodities fo confiderable, which Egypt is ddh- r' tute of, as Silks, Cottons, Indigo, and fo many others, fufficiently related by Au thors. ; . Moreover, That of thefe fame Countries there are many that are well enough peopled and cultivated, and where Tradefmen, though naturally very lazy there, are not want-^ ing, either from Neceffity, or other Caufes, to apply themfelves to work, a^ toTa- pilferies, Embroideries, Cloth of Gold and Silver, and to all thofe kinds of SilkSilk and Cotton Manufadiures, that are ufed in the Country, or tranfported to other' N You may further obfefve, how that Gold and Silver circulating as it were upon the Earth, comes at lad, in part, to be fwallow’d up in this Indian. For of that which comes Out of Ammca, and is difperfed through the feveral Kingdoms of our Eume, we knoWj that one part ts carried into Imky many ways, for the Commodities drawn ^ nce ’ 3 j j , anot !l7 P art ^ SCOnve y e&lt; ^ by the way of Smyrna, for the Silks afforded there: That all Turfy generally needs Coffee, which comes out of Hve- man, or Happy Arabia, and is the common Drink of the Turks : That the fame Turkvzs wdlas Hyeman and Perfia cannot be without the Commodities of India i and that thus all thofe Countries are obh'ged to carry to over the Red-Sea, near Kabel-mandeU and to Paffora the utmoft part of the Perfian-Gulfi and to tandar-Abbaff or Gomoron near toOrmus, a part of thatGoId and Silver, that had been brought into their Coun- VJ 5 X r thence tranfported into Indojlan, in Veffels, that yearly, in the feafon of the Mounjons, come purpofely to thofe three famous Parts : That on the other hand all thole Ships of India, whether they be Indian ones, or Dutch, or Enriifh, or PortumeCe that every year tranfport Merchandife out of Indoftan to Pegu* Tanafferi, Siam, Ceilan Achem, Macaffer, the Maldives, Mefambic, and other places, bring, back alfo much Cold and Silver from all thofe Countries, which meets with the fame Deftiny that the other doth: l hat of that quantity of Gold and Silver which the draw from japan, 0 which is horcd with Mines ) a part alfo comes to be at length difcharged in this Indofian : And that laftly, what is carried thither dire&amp;ly by Sea, whether from Portugal, England, or France, feldom comes back from thence but in Merchandife rbf* reft remaining there, as the former. I very well know, that it may be faid, that this needs Copper,Cloves Nut- megs, Cinamon, Elephants, and fundry other things; which the Hollanders carry thi- ther from japan, the Molucques, Ceilan, and Europe i as alfo that it hath occalion for Lead, which in part, it is furniflfd with out of England &gt; likewife for Scarlet, which ic hath Iwm France : Moreover, that it ftands in need of a good number of Horfes it being certain, that from the fide of Vsbec it receives yearly more than 2 500. That out of Perjia alfo it is furnilhed with abundance of the fame j as alfo out of Ethiopia Arabia, ^h^ Ports of Mobg, Baffora, and Bander-abbafy : Befides, that it needs that noreor frelh Fruit, which comes thither from Samarkand, Ball-hear a, and Perfia as Melons, Apples, Pears, and Grapes, that are {'pent at Dehli, and bought at great Rams almoft all the Winter long * as well as dry Fruit, which are had there all the year long* and come from the fame Countries, as Almonds, Piftaches, Nuts, Primes* Abricots’ Ratlins, and the like. And that laftly, it wants thofe little Sea-cockles of the Maldives which ferve for common Coyn in Bengale, and in Tome other places i as alfo Amber- gnece, carried thither from the faid Maldives and Mofambic, Rhinoceros-horns Ele phants-teeth, Musk, China-difhes, Pearls of Baharen, and Tutucoury near Ceilan ^ and 1 know not of how many other things of this kind. 3 But all this makes not the Gold and Silver to go out of that Empire,becaufe the Mer chants at their return freight their Ships with the Commodities of the Country, finding a better account by fo doing, than if they (hould bring back Mony, fo that that him ^ t ^ at In ^°fl an proves, as we have faid, a kind of Abyfs for a great part of the Gold and Silver of the World, which finds many ways to enter there, and almoff none to iffue thence. In a word, you may take notice, that this Great M»gol makes himfeif Heir of the or Lords, and of the Manfeb-dars, or petty Lords, that are in his Pay j and ( which is of very great confequence ) that all the Lands of that Empire are his Pro- priety, excepting fome Houfes and Gardens, which he giveth leave to his Subie&amp;s to leil, divide, 01 buy atnongft them, as they {hall think fit. hefe are tne things, which fufficiently (how, both that there muff needs be a very great fjore of Gold and Silver in Indojlan, though there be no Mines i and alfo that the reat Mogol, the Soveraign of the fame, at leaff, of the beft part of it, hath immenfe Revenues and Riches. . t ot ^ er band, there are alfo many things to be obferved, which are a poife - 0 . ” ^hes. The firft, that among thofe vaft tra&amp;s of Rind there is much which « nothing but fand and ileril Mountains, little Tilled or Peopled: That even of thofe nat would be fertile, there is much, that is not ufed for want of Workmen , fome of /. ^ * - whichThe Hijiory of the Empire which have periih’d by the top evil treatment of the Governors,who often take from them their neceffary livelihood, and fometimes their very Children whom they make Slaves when they are not able, or are unwilling to pay: Others have abandon’d the Field for the fame reafon, and defponding out of the confideration that they labour’d only for others, have caft themfelves into Towns, or into Armies, to ferve there for Porters, or waiting men, and many have fled to the lands of the Kajus, becaufe there they found lefs tyranny, and more kindnefs. • . • The fecond is. That in this fame Extent of Country there are fundry Nations,which the Mogol is not full Matter of, moft of them retaining yet their particular Soveraigns and Lords, that obey him not, nor pay him Tribute but from conftraint, many, that do little j fome, that do nothing at all i and fome alfo, that receive Tribute from him, as we (hall fee anon. Such are thofe petty Soveraigns, that are feated on the Frontiers of Perfia, who almoft never pay him any thing, no more than they do to the King of Jperfia : As alfo the Baleuches and Augans^ and other Mountineers, of whom alfo the greateft part pay him but a fmall matter, and even care but very little for him: wit- nefs the Affront they did him, when they flopp’d his whole Army by cutting off the Water, which they kept back within the Mountains, when he patted from on the River Indm to Cahouf to hy to Kandahar, not fufferingthe Water to rundown into the Fields, where was the Highway, ’till they had receiv’d Prefents, although they ask’d them by way of Alms. Suchare alfo the a Mabutnetan People, iffued from the fide of the River Ganges towards Bengale &gt; who before the Invafion of thp Moguls in India, had taken their time to make themfelves potent in many places, and chiefly at t)ehli&gt; and to render many thereabout their Tributaries. Thefe Patans axe fierce and warlike, and even the meanett of them, though they be waiting Men and Porters, are ftill of a very high fpirit, being often heard to fay by way of fwearing, Let me never he King of Dehli, if it he net fb: A People that defpife the Indians, Hea then, and Mogoh, and mortally hate the laft&gt; flill remembring what they were formerly, before they were by them driven away from their large Principalities, and conftrained to retire hither and thither, far from Debit, and Agra, into the Mountains, where now they are fetled, and where fome of them have made themfelves petty Soveraigns, like Rajas, but of fmall firength. Such an one alfo is the King of Vifapour, who pays to the Mogel nothing, and is al ways in War with him i maintaining himfelf in his Country, partly by his own For ces, partly becaufe he is very remote from Agra and Dehli, the ordinary places of Re- fidence of thz Great Mogol'■&gt; partly alfo, becaufe his Capital City Vifapour is ftrong, and of difficult accefs to an Army, by reafon of the ill Waters, and the want of Forage on the way i and partly becaufe many Rajas join with him for their common defence,as did the famous Seva-Gi, who, not long fince, came pillaging and burning that rich Sea-port, Suratte, and who fometimes will pay little or no Tribute. Such is likewife that potent and rich King of Golkgnda, who underhand gives Mony to the King of Vifapour, and hath always an Army ready on the Frontiers tor his own defence, and for the afllftance of Vifapour, in cafe he find him too much prefled. Of the like fort are more than an hundred Rafis, or confiderable Heathen Soveraigns, difperfed through the whole Empire, fome near to, others remote from Agra and Dehli: amongft whom there are about fifteen or fixteen that are very rich and puiffant; fuch as is Rana ( who formerly was, as ’twere, Emperor of the Rajas j and who is faid to be of the Progeny of King Porus j) Jejfeign&lt;e and Jeffomfeign #, which are fo great and powerful, that if they three alone ttiould combine,they would hold him tackj each of them being able, in a very fhort time, to raife and bring into the Field Twenty five thoufand Horfe, better Troops than the Mogdls, Thefe Cavaliers are call d Ragi- pouts, or the Children of Rajas. They are men, who, as I have elfewhere Paid ? carr y Swords from Father to Son, and to whom the Rajas allot Land, on condition to be ah ways ready to appear on Horfeback, when the Raja commands. They can much hardffiip, and they want nothing to make them good Soldiers, but good Order and Difcipline. ' . The third thing to be noted is, That the Mogol is a Mahumetam not of the Sea cal led Chios, who follow Aly and his Off-fpring, ( fuck as the Perfians are, and confequent- ly the greateft part of his Court &gt; ) but of that, which follows Ofman, and thence are call’d 0 [manly;, fuch as the Tariff are.

From thence let us proceed to the Infantry in which wc (hall contider the Mufquetiers, and all thole men on loot that at tend the Ordnance, where fomething will occur to be faid of their Artillery. It is not to be thought, that the Omrabs or Lords of the Mogol s Court are Sons of great Families, as in France i All the Lands of that Empire being the A%&gt;fs Propriety, it follows, that there are neither Dutchies, nor Marquifats, nor any Family rich in Land, and fubfifiing of its own Income and Patrimony. And often enough they are no t fo much as OmraVs Sons, becaufe the King being Heir of all their Eftates, it i s confcquent that the Houfes cannot fubfift long in their greatnefs *, on the contrary, they often fall, and that on a fudden, infomuch that the Sons, or at leaif the Grandfons of a potent Qwivtzb are frequently, after the death of their Father, reduced, in a manner, ' to Beggary, and oblig’d to lilt themfelves under fome Omrah for fimpie Horfemen. Tis true, that ordinarily the Uogol leaves fome fmall Pen lion to the Widow, and oftenal- fo to the Children &gt; or, if the Father liveth too long, he may by particular favour ad vance them fooner, efpecially if they be proper men, white of Face, having as yet not too much of the Indian Complexion and temper, and fo palling, yet for true Mogols : Though this advancement by favour do always proceed in a flow pace* it being almoft a general cuftom, that a man muft pafs from fmall Pays and fmall Places,to great ones. Thefe Omrabs then are commonly but Adventurers and Strangers of all forts of Nations, fuch asl have fakh which draw one another to this Court’, men of a mean defeent, fome of them flaves i moft of them without inftrudion, which the Mogol thus raifeth to Dignities as he thinks good, and degrades them again, as he pleafeth. Amongft thefe Omrabs, fome are Hazary, ethers Don Hazary, others Penge, Heck, and Deb Hazary, and even ( fuch was the King’s eldeft Son ) Dovazdeb Hazary, that is to fay, Lord of a thoufand Horfe, of twothoufand, five thoufand, feven, ten, and twelve thoufand s their Pay being lefsor more in proportion to the number of Horfes i I fay, of Horfes, becaufe they are not paid in refped of the Horfemen, but of the Horfe, the Omrabs having power to entertain Horfemen of two Horfes a man, to be the better able to ferve in the hot Countries, where ’tis a common faying, 7bat tbe Horfiman that hath but one Horfe, if more than half a Footman. Yet we mutt not think, that they are oblig’d to entertain, or that the King effedfively pays fo many Horfe , as thefe great names of Dovazdeb ox Hecbt Hazary do impart, that is, 12000, or 8000 Horfe. Thefe are fpecious Names, to amufe and attrad Strangers i the King determines the number of Horfes in adual fervice, which they are bound to entertain, pays them according to this number j and befides that, he pays them a certain number which they are not bound to entertain i and this is that which ordinarily makes the principal part of their Pen- lions *, not to fpeak of what they finger out of the Pay of every Horfe man, and of the number of the Horfes i Which certainly amounts to very confiderable Penfions’, efpe cially if they can obtain good Jab-ghirs, that is, good Lands for their Penfion. for I faw, that the Lord, under whom I was, that was a Penge-bazary, or one of five thou fand Horfe, and who was only obliged to entertain five hundred in effed, had, after all his Cavalry was paid, remaining for his Penfion near Five thoufand Crowns a month i though he was Nagdy, that is, paid in Mony drawn out of the Treafury, as all thofe are, that have mot Lands. Yet notwithftanding aH thefe great Penfions, I fee none but very few that are rich, but many that are uneafie and indebted : Not that they are ruin’d by keeping too plentiful Tables, as elfewhere great Lords frequently are i but that which exhaufteth them, are the great Prefents which they are oblig’d to make to the King at certain Feftivals of the year, every one after the rate of his Pay next, the vaft Expences they muft be at for entertainin^their Wives, Servants, Camels, and ma ny Horfes of great value, which they keep iq their particular Stables. The number of the Omrabs, as well of thofe, that are in the Field in the Provinces and Armies, as of thofe that are at the Court, is very great. I never could precifely learn it v nor is it determined: But I have never feen lefs of them at Court,than twen ty five or thirty, that are thus Penfionaries according to a greater or Jefler number of Horfes to be entertain’d by them, from 12000 downward to 1000. Thefe are the Omrabs, that arrive to the Governments and principal Offices of the Court and Armies^ that are, as they fpeak, the Pillars of the Empire, and that keep up tfie fplendor of the Court * never going abroad, but richly deck’d , fometimes riding on Elephants,fometimes on Horfeback, fometimes carried in a Pakky or Chair, commonly attended by a good number of Horfemen, to wit, of thofe that have the Guard at that time,a§ alfo by many Footmert marching before, and on his fides, to make way, to drive away the Flies, to take off the dud with Peacocks tails, to carry water for drink,and ibme- times Books of Accompts, or other Papers. All thofe that are at Court, are oblig’d, under a confiderable Penalty, to come twice every day to falute the King in the Affembly, once about Ten or eleven a clock in the morning, when he renders Jufticei and the fecond time, about fix hours at night. They are alfo oblig’d by turns to keep the Guard in the Gaftle once a week , during twenty four hours. Thither they carry at that time their Beds, Tapifferies and other Moveables, the King furnilhing them with nothing but Provihons of Meat and Drink, which they receive with great reverence, making a treble obeifance, with their face turn’d to his Apartment, their hands down to the ground, and then lifted up upoii their heads. Befides, .they are oblig’d on Horfeback to follow the King whitherfoever he marcheth in any weather, rainy or dufty, whether he be carried in his Chair, or on an Elephant, or a Field-Throne, which laft is done by eight men carrying him on their fhouldersj eight others marching on his fide, to relieve the others? himfelf being in all Marches well cover’d from the inconveniencies of the Weather, whether he go to War, or to Hunt, or to exercife his Soldiery. And this attendance thok Omrahs ar£ to give, except fome of them be exempted by the M^o/, becaufeof their peculiar Of fices, or upon the account of freknefs or old age, or to avoid embarafment, as com monly ’tis pra&amp;ifed, when he goeth only to fome neighbouring Town to hunt, or to fome houfe of Pleafure, or to the Mofquee, there being thenfeldom any about him but thofe that keep the Guard that day. Manfebdars are Cavaliers of Manfeb, which is patticular and honourable Pay} not fo great indeed as that of the Omrahs^ but much greater than that of the others * they being efteemed as little Omrahs, and of the rank of thofe, that are raifed to that dig nity. , , Theft acknowledge alfo none for their Head but the King, and they are generally ob liged to whatever we have faid the Omrahs are. In a word, they would be true Om- rabf, if they had, as divers heretofore have had, fome Horftmen under them ? whereas they have ordinarily but two, four, orfixHorfes, having the King’s mark, and their Pay goes so higher than from 200, to &lt;5oo or 700 Roupks a month. Their number al fo is not fixed, but much exceeds that of the Omrahs, there being of them at the Court always two or three hundred, befides thofe that are in the Provinces and Ar mies. Rouzindars are alfo a fort of Cavaliers, but fuch as have their Pay by the day, ( as the word it ftlf imports ) which yet fometimes is greater than that of many Manfeb- dars, bat not fo honourable i but then they are not bound, as the Manfebdars, to take at afttprice ( which fometimes is not too reafonable ) of thofe Tapifferies and other Houfhold-ftuff, that hath ferv’d for the King’s Palace, Their number is very great i. they enter into the meaner Offices, many of them beingClerks, Under-Clerks,Siguet- Men, and the like. Simple Cavaliers, are thoft, that are under the Omrahs \ amongft whom the moft confiderable, and having moft Pay, are thofe that have twoHorfes marked on the Leg with the mark of their Omrah. Their Pay is riot abfolutely fixed, but depends chiefly from the generofity of the Omrah, who may favour whom he pleafeth. Yet the Mogol s intention is, that the Pay of a fimple Cavalier or Hdrftmari be no lefs than twenty five Roupies, or thereabout a Month, ftating his account with the Omrahs upon that Foot. . . . The Pay of the Foot is the leaft j and their Mufljuetiers are pitiful men, unlefs they difeharge when their Mufquet leans on that fmall wooden Fork hanging to it ? yet even then they are afraid of lingeing their great Beards, and of burning their Eyes, but moft: of all, leaft fome T&gt;gen or evil Spirit burft their Mufquet. Some of theft have 20 Roupks a Month, fome 15, fome 10. But yet there are fome Gunners that have great Pay, efpecially thofe of the Franguk or Cbriftians, as Portuguefes, Englijh, Dutch, Ger mans, French, that retire thither from Goa, flying from Englijh and Dutch Companies. Heretofore when the Mogols did not yet know how to manage Artillery, their Pay was very great. And there are yet fome of that time, who have 200 Roupks a Month ? bu£ now they will receive none for more than thirty two. . K a TheirThe Hijlory.of the Empire ■ ■ , .. .. _ - Their Axtillery is of two forts? the one is the great and heavy Artillery, the other the light. As for the former, 1 remember, that whejj the King after his Sicknefs went with his whole Army abroad into the Country, diverting himfelf .every day in Hunt ing, fometimes of Cranes, fometimes of the gray Oxen, fa kind of Elks.) fometimes of Gazels, Leopards and Lions, and making his progrefs towards Labor and Kacb- mire (that little Paradife of India ) there to pafs the Summer, the Army had Seventy pieces of Cannon, molt of them call, not counting the two or three hundred Camels carrying each a fmall Field-piece of the bignefs of a good double Mufquet, faflned to thofe Animals. The other light Artillery is very brave and well order’d, confiding 0 f fifty or fixty fmall Field-pieces all of Brafs, each mounted on a little Chariot, verydine and well painted, with a fmall Coffer before and behind for the Powder, drawn L two yery fair Horfes, driven by a Coachman like a Cakche, adorned with a number of fmall red Streamers, each having a third Horfe led by the Chariot for relief; The great Artillery could not always follow the King, who often left the Highway and turn’d fometimes to the right, fometimes to the left hand, eroding the fieids,toffhd the true places for Game, and to follow the courfe of the Rivers, lhat therefore was to keep the Highway to go the more eafily, and to avoid the embarafments, which ic would have met with in the ill paflages, efpecially in thofe Boat-Bridges made to pafs Rivers. The light Artillery is infeparable from the perfon of the King, it marcheth away in the morning, when the King comes out of his Tent v and whereas he com monly goes a little atide into the places for Game, this Artillery paffeth on ftraight with all poffible fpeed, to be in time at the Rendezvous, and there to appear before the King’s Tent, which is there made ready the day before i as are alfo the Tents of the great Omrahs : And this whole Artillery giveth a Volley juff when the King enters into his Tent, thereby to give notice to the Army of his arrival. The Militia of the Field is not different from that which is about the King: There are everywhere Omrahs, Manfebdars, Roufindars, fimple Horfemen, and Foot and Ar tillery where-ever any War is made. The difference is only in the number,which is rr^ch greater in the Field-Army, than in the other. For that Army alone, which the Mogol is conftram’d perpetually to maintain in Vecan, to bridle the potent King of Golkonda, and to make War upon the King of Fifapmrjmd upon all the Raja’s that join with him, muff confift at leaft of twenty, or twenty five thoufand Horfe, fometimes of thirty. The Kingdom of Kaboul^ for its ordinary Guard againft the Perfians^ Augans , P&gt;a- Inches, and I know not how many Mounteniers, requireth at leaft Fifteen thoufand. The Kingdom of Kachmin, more than Four thoufand i and the Kingdom of Bengale, much more j not counting thofe that are employ’d in the War, which muff almoff al ways be maintain’d on that fide* nor thofe which the Governors of the feveral Provin ces do need for their defence, according to the particular extent and fituation of their Governments, which maketh an incredible number. Not to mention the Infantry, f which is inconfiderable ) I am apt to believe with many others,well inform’d of thefe matters,that the number of the Horfe in a&amp;ualfer- vice about the King’s Perfon, comprehending the Cavalry of the Raja’s and Patatir, mounteth to Thirty five or forty thoufand i and that this number, joined to thofe that is abroad in the Field, may make Two hundred thoufand, and better. I fay, that the Infantry is inconfiderable i for I can hardly believe, that in the Army which is about the King, comprifing the Mufquetiers, and all the Gunners and their Mates, and whatever ferves in this Artillery, can amount to much more than Fifteen thoufand i whence you may make a near guefs, what the number of the Foot muff be in the Field. So that I know not whence to take that prodigious number of Foot which fome do reckon in the Armies of the Great Mogol, unlefs it be, that with this true Soldiery they confound all the Serving-men and Vi&amp;uallers that follow the Armyi for in that fenfe I fhould eafily believe, that they had reafon to reckon two or three hun dred thoufand men in thatArmyalone which is with the King, and fometimes more* efpecially when ’tis certain, that he is to be long abfent from the Capital City : which will not feem fo ftrange to him,that confiders the multitude and confufion of Tents,Kit chens, Baggage, Women, Elephants,Camels, Oxen, Horfes, Waiting-men, Porters,Fora!- gers, Victuallers, Merchants of all forts, that muff follow the Army i nor to him, that knows the State and particular Government of that Country, wherein the King is the foie Proprietor o f all the Lands of the Kingdom? whence it neceffarily follows, that a whole Metropolitan City, fuch as Vehly and Agra, Hveth of almoff nothing but of the Soldiery,7 ° The Hifloryof the Empire of Roupies. A Rottpy is about twenty nine pence. An hundred thoufand of them make a Lecque and an hundred Lecques make one Kourour. [ So that the fix Koutours would mah&gt; about fieven Millions and an half Englifh Money. ] 5 Tis true, I do not compre- hend in this great Treafure that great abundance of Goldfmiths work, fo varioufly wrought in Gold and Silver i nor that vail ftore of precious Stones and Pearls of a very high value. I doubt, whether there be any King in the World that hath more. The Throne alone, cover’d with them, is.valu’d at leaft three Kourors &gt; if 1 remember aright: But then, it is to be confider’d alfo, that they are the fpoils of thofe ancient Princes the Patans and Rajas, gather’d and piled up from immemorial times, and dill increafing from one King to another, by the Prefents which the Omrahs are obliged year ly at certain Feftival-days to make him i and which are efteemed to be the Jewels of the Grown, which it would be criminal to touch, and upon which a King of Mogol in cafe of neceffity would find it very hard to procure the lead Sum. feat'before I conclude, I (hall take notice, whence it may proceed, that though this Empire of Mogol be thus an Abyfs of Gold and Silver, ( as hath been faid, ) yet not- withftanding there appears no more of it among the people, than elfewhere i yea, ra ther that the People is there lefs Monied than in other places. TheM r eafon is,that much of it is confumed in melting over and over all thofe Nofe and Ear-rings, Chains, Finger-rings, Bracelets of Hands and Feet, which the Women wear,but chiefly in that incredible quantity of Manufactures, wherein fo much is fpent, which is loft, as in all thofe Embroideries, Silk-ftuffs, enterwoven with Gold and Sil ver, Cloth, Scarf, Turbants, &amp;c. of the fame. For generally all that Militia loveth to be guided from the Omrahs to the meaneft Soldiers with their Wives and Children, though they ftiould ftarve at home. The fecond. That all the Lands of the Kingdom being the Kings propriety, they are ' given either as Benefices, 1 which they call Jah-ghirs, or, as in Eurky, Elmars^ to men of the'Militia for their Pay or Penfion ( as the word Jah-ghir imports: ) Or elfe they are given to the Governours for their Penfion, and the entertainment of their Troops, on condition that of the furplus of thofe Land-revenues they give yearly a certainfum to the King, as Farmers *, Or laftly, the King, referveth them for himfelf as a particu lar Domaine of his Houfe , which never Or very feldom are given, as Jah-ghirs, and upon which he keeps Farmers, who alfo muft give him a yearly fum i which is to fay, that the Ehnariots^ Governours and Earmors have an abfolute Authority over the Country-men, and even a very great one over the Tradefmen and Merchants of the Towns, Boroughs, and Villages, depending from them: fo that in thofe Parts there are neither great Lords nor Parliaments, nor Prefidial Courts, as amongft us, to keep thefe People in awe : nor Kadis or Judges, powerful enough to hinder and reprefs their violence, Nor, in a word, any perfon, to whom a Country-man, Tradef-man, or Merchant, can make his complaints to, in cafes of extortion and tyranny, often pra&amp;i- fed upon them, by the Soldiery and Governors, who every where do impunely abufc the Authority Royal, which they have in hand, unlefs it be perhaps a little in thofe pla ces that are near to Capital Cities, as Vehli and Agra-s and in great Towns and conn- derable Sea-ports of the Provinces, whence they know that the complaints can be more eafily conveyed to the Court. Whence it is, that all and every one ftatid in con tinual fear of thefe people, efpecially of the Governors more than any Slave doth of hisMafter: that ordinarily they a fifed: to appear poor and money-lefs, very mean m their Apparel, Lodging, Houftiold-ftufif, and yet more in meat and drink , that often they apprehend even to meddle with Trade, left they fhould be thought Rich, an o fall into the danger of being ruined : So that at laft they find no other remedy to fe- cure their Wealth, than to hide and dig their money deep under Ground, thus netting out of the ordinary commerce of men, and fo Dying, neither the King nor the State having any benefit by it. Which is a thing not only happens t fants and Artizans, but ( which is far more confiderable ) amongft all forts of Mer chants, whether Mahumetans or Heathens, except fome that are in the Kings,,or feme Omrahs Pay, or that have fome particular Patron and fupport m pWer: But principally among the Heathen, which are almoft the only Mafters of the Trade a Money, infatuated with the belief, that the Gold and Silver, which they hide in their life-time, (hall ferve them after death. And this, in my opinion, is the true reafon, why there appears fo little money in Trade among the People. _ But thence arifeth a Queftion very confiderable, viz. Whether* were not more exp^ -of the M O G O L. dknt, not only for the Subje&amp;s, but for the State it fclf, and for the Sovereign, not to have the Prince fuch a Proprietor of the Lands of the Kingdom , as to take away the Meum and Tmm anaongft private perfonsi as 5 tis with us; For my part, after a ftrid comparing the State of our Kingdoms, where that Meum and holds, with that of thofe other Kingdoms, where it is not, I am thoroughly perfwaded, that it is much better and more beneficial for the Sovereign himfelf, to have it fo as 3 tis in our parts. Becaufe that in thofe parts where his otherwife, the Gold and Silver is loft, as I was juft now obferving: There is almoft no perfon fecure from the violences of thofe Timariors, Governours, and Farmers: The Kings, how well foever they be dif- pofed toward their people, are never almoft in a condition ( as I lately noted ) to get Juftice adminiftred to them, and to hinder tyrannies ? efpecially in thofe great Domini ons, and in the Provinces remote from theGapital Towns } Which yet ought to be 9 as doubtkfs it is, one of the chief employments and confiderations of a King. Befides, this tytanny often grows to that excefs, that it takes away what is neceflary to the life of aPeafant or Tradefman, who is ftarved for hunger and miferywho gets no Chil dren, or if he does, fees them die young for want of food i or that abandons his Land, and turns fome Cavalier’s man, or flies whither he may to his Neighbours, in hopes of finding a better condition. la a word, the Land is not tilled but almoft by force, and confequently very ill, and much of it is quite fpoiled and ruined, there being none to be.found, that can or will be at the charge of entertaining the ditches and channels for the courfe of waters to be convey’d to neceffary places &gt; nor any body that care to build Houfes, or to repair thofe that are ruinous»the Peafant reafoningthus with him felf : Why fhould I toil fo much for a Tyrant that may come to morrow to take all away from me, or at leaft all the beft of what I have, and not leave, if the fancy taketh him, fo much as to fuftain my life even j(ery poorly ? And the Timariot, the Governor and the Farmer, will reafon thus with himfelf i Why fhould I beftow mony,and take pains of bettering or maintaining this Land, fince I muft every hour expedf to have it taken from me, or exchanged for another ? I labour neither for my felf, nor for my Chil dren j and th:*t place which I have this year, 1 may, perhaps, have no more the next. Let us draw from it what we can, whilft we poffefs it, though the Peafant ftiould break or ftarve, though the Land Ihould become a Defart, when I am gone ! And for this very reafon it is, that we fee thofe vaftEftates in Afia go fo wretchedly and palpably to ruine. Thence it is, that throughout thofe Parts we fee almoft no other Towns but made up of earth and dirt &gt; nothing but jruin’d and deferted Towns and Villages, or fuch as are going to ruine. Even thence it is, that we fee (for Ex ample ) thofe Mefopotamias, Anatolic?Paleftina’s, thofe admirable Plains of Antioch^ and fo many other Lands, anciently fo well tilled, fo fertile, and fo well peopled, at the prefent half deferted, untill’d and bandon’d, or become peftilent and uninhabitable Bogs. Thence it is alfo, that of thofe incomparable Lands of Egypt it is obferv’d, that within lefs than fourfeore years, more than the tenth part of it is loft, no people being to be found, that will expend what is neceffary to maintain all the Channels, and to teftrain the River Ni/e from violently overflowing on one hand, and fo drowning too much the low Lands, or from covering them with Sand, which cannot be remov’d from thence but with great pains and charges. From the fame root it comes, that Arts are languidiing in thofe Countries, or at leaft flouriih muchlefs than elfe they would do,or do with Us. For what heart and fpirit can an Artizan have to ftudy well, and to apply his mind to his work, when he fees, that among the people, which is for the moft part beggarly, or will appear fo&gt; there is none that confiders the goodnefs and neatnefs of his Work, every body looking for what is cheap, and that the Grandees pay them but very ill, and when they pleafe. The poor Tradefman often thinking himfelf happy, that he can get clear from them without the Korrah y which is that terrible Whip that hangs nigh the Gate of the Omrabs, Further, when he feeth that there is no help at all ever to come to any thing, as to buy an Office, or fome Land for himfelf and Chil dren, and that even he dares not appear to have a Penny in Ca(h, or to wear good Cloaths, or to eat a good Meal, for fear he fhould be thought rich. And indeed the beauty and exadtnefsof Arts had been quite loft in thofe Parts long ago, if it were not that the Kings and Grandees there did give Wages to certain Workmen, that work in their Houfes, and there teach their Children, and endeavour to make themfelves able in order to be a little more confider’d, and to efcape the Konah *&gt; and if alfo it were Aor, that thofe great and rich Merchants Towns, who are prote&amp;ed by good and powerfulw 7 2 The Hiftoryof the Empire powerful Patrons, pay’d thofe Workmen a little better: Hay, a little Better i for what* fine fluffs foever we fee come from thofe Countries, ’we muff not imagine that the Workman is there in any honour, or comes to any thing * 5 tis nothing bu^meer Necellity, or the Cudgel, that makes him work, he never grows rich i it is no fmall matter, when he hath wherewith to live, and to cloath himfelf narrowly. If there be any mony togainof the Work, that is not for him, but for thofe great Merchants of Towns, I was juft now fpeaking of i and even thefe themfelves find it often difficult enough to maintain themfelves, and to prevent Extortion. ’Tis from the fame caufealfo, that a grofs and profound Ignorance reigns in thofe States. For, how is it poffible, there ftiould be Academies and Colleges well founded where are fuch Founders to be met with ? And if there were any, Whence were the Scholars to be had ? Where are thofe that have means fufficient to maintain their Chil dren in Colleges ? And if there were, who would appear to be fo rich ? And if they would, Where are thofe Benefices, Preferments, and Dignities, that require Knovvledg and Abilities, and that may animate young men to ftudy ? Thence it is like wife, thatTraffick languifhes in all that Country, in comparifon of ours. For how many are there, that care to take pains, to run up and down, to write much, and to run danger for another, for a Governor, that (hall extort, if he be not in league with fome confiderable Sword-man, whofe Slave he in a manner is, and that makes his own Conditions with him ? It is not there, that the Kings find for their fervice, Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, Sons of rich and good Families, Officers, Citizens, Merchants, and even Tradefmen, well born, well educated, and well inftru&amp;ed men of Courage, that have a true affection and refpedf for their King, that often live a great while at the Court, and in the Army, at their own Expences, entertaining themfelves with good hopes, and content with the favourable afpe&lt;5t of the Prince i and who, upon ocicafion, fight manfully, covetous to uphold the honour of their Anceftofs and Families. Thofe Kings, I fay, never fee about them, but men of nothing, Slaves, Ignorants, Brutes, and fuch Courtizans as are raifed from the Duft to Dignities j and that for want of good Education and Inftru- dion, almoft always retain fomewhat of their Offfpring, of the temper of Beggars,en riched, proud, unfufferable, heartlefs, infenfible of honour, difingenuous, and void of affection and regard for the honour of their King and Country. Here it is, where thofe Kings muft mine all, to find means to defray all thofe prodigious Charges, which they cannot avoid for entertaining their great Court, which hath no other fource to fubfift but their Coffers andTreafiJre, and for maintaining conftantly the vaft number of Sol diers, neceffary for them to keep the People in fubjedrion, to prevent their running away, to make them work, and to get what is exadted from them, they being fo many Defloerado^ for being perpetually under hatches, and for labouring only for others. Thence it is alfo, that in an important War that may happen (which may be almoft at all times ) they muft almoft of neceftity fell the Govermpent for ready Mony , and immenfeSums, whence chiefly that mine and defolation comes to pafs which we fee. For the Governor, which is the Buyer, muft nothebe re-imburfed of all thofe great Sums of mony, which he hath taken up, perhaps the third or fourth part, at high in- tereft ? Muft not a Governor alfo, whether he have bought the Government or not,fincl means as well as a Timariot and a Farmer, to make every year great Prefents to a Fiftr, an Eunuch^ a Lady of the Seraglio^ and to thofe other perfons that fupport him at Court ? Muft he not pay to the King his ufual Tributes, and withal enrich himfelf, that wretched Slave, half famiftfd, and deeply indebted when he firft appear’d, without Goods, Lands, and Revenues of his Houfe, fuch as they all are. Do not they ruine all, and layallwafte? I mean thofe, that in the Provinces are like fo many fmall Tyrants with a boundlefs and unmeafur’d Authority, there being no body there, as hath been already faid, that can reftrain them, or to whomaSubjedl can have refuge,to favehim felf from their Tyranny, and to obtain Juftice ? ’Tis true, that in the Empire of the Mogol, the Vakea-rievti } that is, thofe Perfons, whom he fends into the Provinces to write to him whatever paffefh there, do a little keep the Officers in awe, provided they do not collude together (as it almoft always happens ) to devour all, as alfo that the Governments are not there fo often fold, nor fo openly as in Tmky i I fay, not fo openly ( for thole great Prefents, they are from time to time obliged to make, are almoft equivalent to Sales ) and that the Governors ordi narily remain longer in their Governments i which maketh them not fo hungry, fobeg- * ' ’ §ariy ? *garlf) and fo deep in debt, as thofe new Comers, 'and that confequently they do not always tyrannize over the people with fo much cruelty j even apprehending, left they (hould run away to the Rajas } which yet falls out very often, Tis alfo true, that in Perfid the Governments are not fo frequently nor fo publickly fold asin Turky i the Sons of the Governors alfo fucceedihg often enough to their Fa thers i which is alfo the caufe, that the people there is often not fo ill treated as in Turky, and occafions withal, that there is more politenefs, and that evenfome there arethataddi&amp;themfelves to ftudy; But all that is really but a flight matter i fhofe three States otTurky, Perfia and Indojian, forafmuch as they have all three taken away the Meum and Tmm as to Land, and propriety of Poftcffions ( which is the foundation of whatever is good and regular in the World ) cannot but very near refemble one ano ther: they have the fame defedt, they muft at laft, fooner or later, needs fall into the fame inconveniencies, which are the neceffary confequences of it, viz. Tyranny, Ruine and Defolation. Far be it therefore, that our Monarchs of Europe fhould thus be Proprietors of all the Lands which their Subjedls poffefs. Their Kingdoms would^e very far from be ing fo well cultivated and peopled, fo well built, fo rich, fo polite and flouriftiing as we fee them. Our Kings are other wife rich and powerful i and we muft avow that we are much better and moire royally ferved. There would be Kings of Dcfarts and Solitudes, of Beggars and fuch as thofe are whom I have been represent ing •, who, becaufe they will have all, at laft lofe all j and who, becaufe they will make themfelves too rich, at length find themfelves without riches, or, at leaft, very far from that which they covet after, out of their blind Ambition and Paflion, of be ing more abfolute than the Laws of God and Nature do permit. For, where would be thofe Princes, thofe Prelates, thofe Nobles, thofe rich Citizens, and great Merchants? and thofe famous Artizans, thofe Towns of Pari*, Lyms^ Ihouloufe^ Rouen, London, and fp many others ? Where would be that infinite number of Burroughs and Villages, all thofe fair Country-houfes and Fields, and Hillocks, tilled and maintained with fo much Induftry, Care and Labour? And where would confequer^tly be all thofe va'ft Revenue^ drawn thence, which at laft enrich the Subjedls and the Sovereign both ? We Should find the great Cities, and the great Boroughs rendred inhabitable, becaufe of the ill Air, and to fall to ruine without any bodies taking care of repairing them i the Hil locks abandoned, and the Fields overfpread with the Bufties, or filled with peftilential Marifhes, as hath been already intimated. A word to our dear and experienc’d Travellers: They would not find thofe Fair con- veniencies of Travelling &gt; they would be obliged to carry all things with them,like the Bohemians ? and all thofe good Inns, for example, that are found between Paris and Lyons, would be like ten or twelve wretched Caravans-ferrahs, that is, great Barns,rai- fed and paved, fuch as our Pont-neuf is, where hundreds of men are found pel-mel to gether with their Horfes, Mules and Camels, where one is ftifled with heat in Summer, and ftarved of cold in Winter, if it were not for the breathing of thofe Animals, that warm the place a little. But it will be faid, we fee fome States, where the Meum and ’Tmm is not, f as for example, that of the Grand Seignior, vvhichvve know better than any, without go ing fo far as the Indies ) that do not only fubfift, but are alfo very powerful, and en- creafe daily. Tis true,that that State of the Gr.Seignior,oi fuch a prodigious Extent as it is,having fo vaft a quantity of Lands, the Soil of which is fo excellent, that it cannot be deftroyed but very difficultly, and in a long time, is yet rich and populous &gt; but it is certain alfo^ that if it were cultivated and peopled proportionably fo ours, ( which it would be, if there were propriety among theSubjedfs throughout) it would be a quite different thing *, it would have people enough to raife fuch prodigious Armies as in old times, and rich enough to maintain them. We have travelled through almoft all the parts of its we havefeen how ftrangely it is ruined and unpeopled s and how in the Capital City there now need three whole months to raife five or fix thoufand men. We know alfo, what it would have come to ere this, if it had not been for the great number of Chriftian Slaves that are brought into it from all Parts. And no doubt but that, if the fame Government were continued there for a number of years, that State would de-* ftroy it felf, atid at laft, fall it by its own Weaknefs, as it feems that already it is hard ly maintained but only by that means, I mean, by the frequent change of Governors * k 1 ' L ther©V The Hiftory of the Empire there being not one Governor, nor any one man in the whole Empire,that hath a penny to enable him to maintain the leaft thing, or that can almoit find any men, if he had money. A ftrahge manner to make States to fubiift ! There would need no more for making amend ot the Seditions, than a Brdma of Pegu, who killed the half of the Kingdom with hunger, and turned it into Forefts, hindring'for fome years the Lands from being tilled, though yet he hath not fucceeded in his Deiign, and the State have afterwards been divided, and that even lately dva&gt; the Capital Towm, was upon the point of being taken by an handful of China Fugitives. Mean time we muft confefs, that we are not like to fee in our days that total mine and deftrudlion of this Empire we arc fpeaking of, (if fo be we fee not’tome.thing worfe ) becaufe it hath Neighbors, that are (b far from being able to undertake any thing againft him, that they are not fo much as in a condition to relih him, unlefs if be by thofe. fuccours ,of Grangers, which the remofenefs and jealoufie would make flow, fmall, ahd fufped. But it might be yet further obje&amp;ed, that it appears not, why fuch States as thefe might not have good Laws, and why the People in the Provinces might not be enabled to come and make tfceir Complaints to a Grand Fi/ir, or to the King himfelf. 5 Tis true, that they are riot altogether deftitufe of good Laws, and that, if thgfe which are among!! them were pbferved, there would be as good living there, as in 'any part of the World. But what are thofe La ws good for, if they be riot obferved, and if there be no means to make them to be executed ? Is it not the Grand LT/zr, or the King that appoints for the People fuch beggarly Tyrants, and that hath no others to fet over them? Is it not He that fells thofe Governments-? Hath a poor Peafant orTradefman means to make great Journies, and to come and feek for Juftice in the Capital City, re mote, perhaps, 150 or 200 Leagues from the place of his Abode ? Will not the Go vernor caufe him to be made away in his journy ( as it hath often hapned ) or catch him fooner or later ? And will he not provide his Friends at Court, to fupport him there, and to reprefent things quite other wife than they are ? In a word, this Governor, hungry as well as the T imariots and Farthers ( that are all men for drawing Oyl out of Sand, as the Perfjan fpeaks, and for ruining a World, with their heap of Women-har- pies, Children and Slaves ) this Governor, I fay, is he not the abfolute Mafter, the Superintendant of Juftice, the Parliament, the Receiver, and all ? It may perhaps be added, That the Lands, which'riur Kings hold in Vomaine^ are no lefs well\ tilled and peopled, than other Land. But there is a great difference between the having in propriety fome Lands here and there in a great Kingdom (which changes not the Conftitution of the State and Government ) and the having them all in pro priety,, which would alter it altogether. And then we in thefe Parts have Laws fo ra-. tional, which our Kings are willing to be the firft to obferve, and according to which they will that their particular Lands {hall be governed as thofe of their Subjects are, fo as to give way, that Addons of Law may be laid againft their own Farmers and Offi- &gt; cers, To that a Peafant or Tradefman may have means to obtain Juftice, and to find remedy againft the unjuft violence of thofe that would opprefs him : Whereas in thofe Parts of I fee almoft not any refuge for thofe poor People i the Cudgel and the Hammer of the Governor being in a manner the only Law that rules, and decides all Controverfies there. Laftly, It may be faid, that ’tis at leaft certain, that in fuch States there is not fuch a multitude of long-lafting Suits of Law, as in thefe Parts, nor fo many Lawyers of all forts,'as amongftus. It is in my opinion, very true, that one cannot too much applaud that old Perftan Saying, Na-bac Kouta Beter-Ez, hacVeraz^ that is, Shortln- jujiice w better than long Juftice, and that the length of Law-Suits is unfufferable in a ; State, and that it is the indifpenfable duty of the Sovereign, by all good means, tq en deavor a remedy againft them. And 5 tis certain, that by taking away this Meum and t Iuum, the Root would be cut of an infinite number of Law-Procefles, and efpecially of almoft all thofe that are of importance, and long and perplexed', and confequently there would not need fo great a number of Magiftrates, which our Sovereigns do em ploy to adminifter Juftice to their Subje&amp;s, nor that fwarmof men, which fubfift qnly by that way. But ’tis alfo manifeft, that the Remedy would be an hundred times vvorfe than the Difeafe,confidering thofe great inconveniences that would follow there upon, and that in all probability the Magiftrates would become fuch as thofe of the Aft- atick^ States, who deferve not that Name', for, in a word, our Kings have yet caufe to glory upon the account of good Magiftracy under them. In thofe Parts, Lome Mer chantschants excepted, Jufticeis only among the meaneft fort of People, that are poor, and of an unequal condition, who have not the means of corrupting the Judges, and to buy falfe Witneffes, that are there in great numbers, and very cheap, and never puniflied 0 And this I have learn’d every where by the experience of many years, and by my felici tous Enquiries made among the People of the Country, and our old Merchants thatare in thofe Parts, as alfo of Ambaffadors, Gonfuls and Interpreters i whatever our com mon Travellers may fay, who, upori their having feen by chance* -when they palled by, two or three Porters, or others ot the like Gang, about a K^dy^ quickly fhfpatching oneor other of the Partied, and fometimes both, with fome la&amp;es under the foie of their Feet, or with a Maybale Baba, fome mild words, when there is no Wool to Iheer, who, I fay, upon fight of this, come hifkSfand cry out, O the good and ftiort Ju- ftice ! O what honeft Judges are thofe in refpedf of ours! Not confideringin the mean time, that if one of thofe Wletches, thaf is In the wrong,” had a couple, of Crowns to corrupt the Kady^ or his Cle^cs, and as much to buy two falfe WitnefTes, he might ei ther win his Procefs, or prolong it as long as he pleafed. In conclufion, to be fhort, 1 fay,i That tHe I taking away this Propriety of Lands among private men, would be infallibly to introduce at the fame time Tyranny,Slavery, Injufiice, Beggary, BarbarifinVPefolatlon, and to open a Highway for the ruine and de- flrudtion of Mankind, and even of Kings &lt;and States: And that oil the contrary f this Meum and T'mm^ accompanied with the hopes that every one (hall keep,what he works and labours for, for himfelf and'his Children,- as his own, is the main foundation of whatever is regular and good in the World : Infomuch that whpfoeyer (hall call his eyes upon the different Countries and Kingdoms, and taketh good notice of what fol lows upon this Propriety of Sovereigns, of that of the People, will foon find the true fource and chief caufe of that great difference we fee in the feveral States and Empires of the World, and avow, that this is in a manner that which changes and diverfifieth the Face of the whole Earth. . ■ ■, X 11 'the End of the SECOND 'TOME*7 6 I , • l. Monfieur deh M 0 T H E k VAT E R, WRITTEN At D E H LI, fVLr u i C O N T A IN I N G The 'Defcription of DEHLI and AGRA , and divers (particu lars difcovering the Court and Genius of the Nlogols md Indians. SIR, Know that one of the firft Queftions you are like to ask me, at my return in France, will be. Whether Debit and Agra are Cities as fair and large, and as well peopled as Farit. Concerning its Beauty, I ftiall tell you by way of Preface, that 1 have fometirties wonder’d to hear our Europeans, that are here, defpifing the Towns of the Indies, as not coming near ours, in refpedt of the Edifices. Certainly they ought not to refemble them i and if Paris, London, and Amfterdam, flood in the place where Vehli is, the greateft part of them muft be thrown down, to build them after another manner. Our Cities indeed have great Beauties and Embelliftiments, but they are fuch that are proper to them, and accommodated to a coldClimat. Debit alfo may have its Beauties peculiar to it, and futable to a very hot Climat: For you are to know, that the heat here obligeth all People, even the great Lords, and the King him- felf, to go without Stockings, in a kind of Slippers only, a fine and flight Turbant on their Heads, and the other Garments accordingly i that there are months in the Sum mer fo exceflively hot, that in the Chambers one can hardly hold ones hands againfl a Wall, nor ones head on a Cufliion: And that People are oblig’d for the fpace of more than fix months to lie without covering, at the door of their Chamber, as the Rabble doth in the open Streets, or as the Merchants, and other People of feme Quality do, in feme airy Hall or Garden, or upon fomeTerrafs well watered at Night: thence you may judge, whether if there were fuch fireets as that of St. Jacques, or St. Denis, with their Houfes Chut, and of fo many Stories high, they would be habitable ? And whether in the Night, efpecially when the heats are without wind and fluffing, it would bepof- fible to fleep there ? And who is there (I pray ) that would have a mind in Summer, when he returns on Horfeback from the City half dead, and in a manner ftifled of the heat and duft, and all in a Sweat, ( for fo it is ) to go climbing up an high pair of Stairs, which often is narrow and dark, to a fourth or fifth Story, and to abide in this hot and. fuffocating Air? On fuch occafions they defire nothing,but to throw down into the Sto tnack a Pint of frefli Water, or Lemonade, to undrefs, to wafli the Face, Hands and Feet, to lie down in fome cool and fhady place all along, having a Servant or two to fan one by turns, with their great Panbat, or Fans. But, to leave this, we fliall now endeavour to entertain you with the reprefentation of Vehli as it is, that fo you may judge, whether it be truly faid, that it is a fair City.Cities of Indoftan. 77 It is nov^ about forty years that Cbab-Jeban, Father of the Grand-Mogol Zebe now reigning, to eternize his memory, caufed to Be built a Town contiguous to old Veblf which he called after his Name Cbab-Jean-Abad, and by way of abbreviation Jean-Abad j that is to fay, a Colony of Cbab-Jeban? defigning to make it the Capital of the Empire, inftead of Agra, where he faid, that the Summer heats were too vio lent. This nearnefs hath occafioned, that the ruines of old Debli have ferved to build a new City &gt; and in the JMex they fcarce fpeak any more of Debit, but only of Jeban- Ahtd, Yet notwithftanding, fince the City of Jehan-Abad is not yet known amongft us, f intend to fpeak of it under the old name of Debit, which is familiar to us. Debit then is a Town altogether new, feated in a plain Campagne, upon a River like our hoire, called Gemna, and built along one fide of the River only i there being but one Boat-bridge to paf$ over into the Plain. This Towrvis furrounded with Walk, except the River fide: thefe Walls are of Bricks, and without a confiderable defence, they be ing without a Ditch, and having nothing to flank them but round Towers after the old way, diftant from each other an hundred common paces, and a rampart behind them, four or five foot thick. The cornpafs of thefe Walls, comprising the Fdrtrefs, is not fo big as is commonly believed: I have gone it round with eafe in three hours i and I be lieve not, though I was on Horfeback, that I difpatched more than one league in aii hour: 5 tis true, that if you will take into the Town a very long Suburb, which goeth towards Lab§r&gt; as alfo what remains inhabited of old Debli, which is likewife a great and very long Suburb, and befides, three or four fmall Suburbs moife, all that would make in a dired: line above a league and a half, and fuch a compafs which I cannot well determine, becaufe that between the Suburbs are great Gardens, and large fpaces not built &gt; but I may fay, that thus taken it would be bt a prodigious bignefs. The Fortrefs, in which is the oc Seraglio, and the other Royal Apartments, which I (hall hereafter fpeak of, is built round upon the River i yet there is between the Water and the Walls a pretty large and long fandy fpace, where commonly Elephants are exercifed, and where frequently the Militia of the Omrahs and Rajas is muflered in the King’s prefence, who looks out of the Windows of one of his Apartments. The Walls of the Fortrefs, as to their round antick Towers, are very neat like thofe of the Town, but they are partly of Bricks, and partly of a certain red Stone refembling Mar ble, which maketh them look fairer than thofe of the Town i befides that, they are much higher, flronger and thicker, being able to bear fome Field-pieces that are there planted towards the Town j and incompaffed alfo, excepting that fide which refpe&amp;s the River, with a fair Ditch, walled up with Free-ftone, fullof Water and Fifh. But yet whether they are confiderable for ftrengtha battery of fome middle fized Cations would, in my opinion, foon caft them down. Round about the Ditch there is a pretty large Garden, at all times full of Flowers and greAi Apricocks, which together with thofe great Walls all red, maketh a very fine fight. About this Garden is the great Street, or rather the great Place Royal, to which the two great and principal Gates of the Fortrefs do anfwer, and to thefe Gates the two chief Streets of the Town. In this great Place it is, where the Tents of the Rajas are, that are in the King’s Pay, to keep there every one in his turn their weekly Guard i whereas the Omrabs and the Manfebdars, or fmall Omrabs, keep it within the Fortrefs, Thefe little Soveraigns are not pleafed to fee themfelves thus and fo long ftiut up in a Fort. In this very Place it is, where at the break of day are exercifed the Horfes of a^ long Royal Stable, near it. And here ’tis alfo, that the Kobattyn, or great Commilfioner of the Cavalry, carefully vieweth the Horfes of thofe Cavaliers, that have been received into Service, to the'end that if thefe Horfes are of ‘furkjfian, or fartary, and large and firongenough for Service, the King’s Mark, and that of the Omrahs, under whom fuch Cavaliers are to be lifted, may be branded upon th^m : A thing not ill devifed, to pre vent the mutual Loan of Horfes in the Mufters. This fame Place is alfo a kind of Bazar, or Market, of an hundred things fold there, and a Rendezvous of Players, and Jugkrs of all forts, as the Pont-neuf at P arif» It is no kfs the Meeting-place of the poor Afirokgers, as well Mabumetan as Heathen. Thefe Doctors (forfoothj fit therein the Sun upon a piece of Tapeftry, all covered with duft, having about them fome*o!d Mathematical Inftruments, which they make ftiew of to draw Paflengefs, and a great open Book reprefenting the Animals of the Zodiac^ Thefe M ' me A* Dehli dnd Agra cafital men are the Oracles, but rather the Affronters of the Vulgar, to whom they pretend to give, for one Paytfa, that is, a penny, good Luck i and they are they, that looking up on the Hands ana the Face, turning over their Books, and making a (hew of Calculati on, determine the fortunate moment when a Bufinefs is to be begun to make it fuccefs- fuL The mean Women, wrapt up in a white Sheet from Head to Foot, come to find them out, telling them in their Ear their moff fecret Concerns, as if they were their Confeffors, and ( which fmells very flrongly of Stupidity and Folly ) entreat them to render the Stars propitious to them fuitable to their Defigns &gt; as if they could abfolutely difpofe of their Influences. The mofl ridiculous of all thefe Aflrologers, in my opinion, was that mongrel Fom* guefe, fugitive from Goa, who fate in that Place with much Gravity upon his piece otTa- peflry, like the refl, and had a great deal of Cuftom, though he could neither write nor read, and asfor Inftruments and Books, was furnilhed with nothing elfe but an old Sea- Compafs, and an old Komijh Prayer-Book in the Portu^uefe Language, of which he (hewed the Pidures for Figures of the Zodiack: AtalBejtias, tal Ajlrologuo : For (uch Beads, fuch Aflrologer, faid he to the Reverend Father Faze, a Jefuit, who met him in that Place. I here fpeak only of the pitiful Aflrologers of the Bazar *, for there are others in thefe Parts, that are in the Courts of the Grandees, and are confidered as great Clerks, and are very rich j whole Afia being overfpread with thisSuperftition. The Kings and the great Lords, who would not undertake the lead: things without confulting them, allow them great Salaries, that they may read to them what is written in the Heavens, ( for fo they fpeak here ) and take out for them that fortunate moment, I waS lately fpeaking of j or find out, at the opening of the Alcoran^ the decihon of all their Doubts. To return j thefe two principal Streets, which I faid do anfwer to the two Gates of the Fortrefs, and to the Place, may have twenty five or thirty common paces in breadth, and they run in a flreight line as far as you are able to fee : Yet that which leads to the Gate of Labor, is much longer than the other j but they are both alike as to the Houfes. There is on both Gdes nothing but Arches, as in our Place Royal j yet with this diffe rence, that they are but of Bricks, and that there is not any Building upon them, but only theTerrafs. There is alfo this difference, that they are not continued Galleries. Thefe Arches are generally fevered by Rails that make Shops which are not to be (hut, where Tradef-men work in the day, where Bankers fit for their Bufinefs, and where Merchants fet out their Wares, which at night they lock up in a Magazin, the little Door of which, to be (hut, is in the bottom of every Arch. It is upon this Magazin, which is in the back-part of the Arches, that the Houfes of Merchants are built and raided, which make a Shew good enough towards the Street, and are alfo pretty convenient, being well aired, out of the way of the duft, and ha ving for their floor the terraffes of the Arches, upon which they can walk to look out upon the Street, and to deep at night in frefco. But excepting thefe Houfes of the chief Streets, and a few others, there are not many of thefe fair Houfes, that are thus raided upon Terraffes •, nor are even thefe two Streets univerfally furnilht with them, there be ing mofily upon the Magazin, or on the fide, nothing but a fmall Building, not feen from the Street, the great Merchants having their Houfes fomewhere elfe, whither they retire at night. Befides thefe principal Streets, there are yet five others, which indeed are not fo long nor fo flreight, but for the reft are altogether like them. There are alfo a great many other Streets eroding thofe on all fides, whereof there are alfo dome furniflit witn Arches &gt; but becaufe they have been built piece-meal by fuch particular perfons, as have not obferved the Symmetry that was requifite, they are, for the moft part, neither fo large nor fo (freight, nor fo well built as the others. Amongft all thefe Streets are fpread every where the Houfes of the Manfebdarr^ or little Omrabs, and thofe of the men of the Law, as alfo of many great Merchants, and other private men j of which there is a good number that are paffable. It is true, there are but few that are all of Brick or Stone, and there is even a good number of thefe, that are made all of Earth only, and thatched &gt; but for all that, they are convenient, becaufe they are generally airy, being furniftied with Courts and Gardens. Nor are they dif* - greeable within, forafmuchas befides the fine moveables, thefe thatched Coverings are fupported by a layer of certain long Canes, that are hard and ftrong, and very pretty, and becaufe alfo thek earthen Walls are plaftered over with very fine and very white Chalk. . ^ongftCities of Indoftan. Amongft thefe Houfes I have been fpeaking of, that are tolerable, there is alfo a pro digious riumber of other fmall ones, that are only made up of Earth and Strata, where all the (imple Cavaliers, and their Servants, and all thofe little people of the Market, that follow the Court and the Army are lodged. It is from thefe thatched Houfes that t&gt;ebli is fo fubjedi: to Fires. This Jail: year there were burnt above fixty thoufand fuch, at two or three times that they took Fire, when there blew certain impetuous Winds, that rife chiefly in Summer. The Fire was fo quick and fo violent, that it furprifed the Houfes, and matiy Horfes alfo that could not be time enough loofened &gt; and there were even fomeof thefe poor Women burnt, that never had been out of t\\z Seraglio, and that are fo weak and ftlamefaced when they fee people) that they know nothingelfe but to hide their Faces. And it is upon the account of thefe pitiful Houfes of Earth and Straw, that I look upon f)ehli almoft no otherwife than as many Villages joyned together, and ( which I have already faid in another place ) as a Camp of an Army, a little better and more commo- dioufly placed, than in the Field. As to the Houfes of thcOmrahsi that are alfo up and down in this City, and princi pally upon the River, and even in the Suburbs: You are to know that in thefe hot Countries, to entitle an Houfe to the name of Good and Fair, it is required itfhould be commodious, feated in a Place well aired, and capable to receive the Wind from all fides, and principally from the North) having Courts, Gardens, Trees, Confervatbries, and little jets of Waters in the Halls, or at leafl at the Entry &gt; furnilhed alfo with good Cellars with great Flaps to tfh the Air, for repofing in the frefti Air from twelve till four or five of the Clock, when the Air of thefe Cellars begins to be hot and fluffing: or having in lieu of Cellarage certain that is, little Houfes of Straw, or rathet of odoriferous Roots, thatare very neatly made, and commonly placed in the midfl of a Vamm near fome Confervatory, that fo the Servants may eafily, with their Pompion- bottles, water them from without. Moreover it is required for the beauty of an Houfe, that it be feated in the midfl: of fome great Parterre, that it have four great Divans or Ways raifed from the ground to the height of a man, or thereabout, and expofed to the four Parts of the World, to receive the Wind and the Cold from all the Parts it may come from. Laflly, it is requifite fdr a good Houfe to have raifed Terrajfes, to fleep up- oivin the night, fuch as are of the fame Floor with fome great Chamber, to draw in ones Bed-ftead upon occafion *, that is to fay, when there comes fome Tempeft ol Rain or Duft, or when that roufing freflinefs of the break of day awakens you, and obliges vou to look for a Covering: or elfe when you apprehend that fmall and light Dew ol the morning, which pierceth, and caufeth fometimes benumming and paralitical Symptoms ip the Limbs. As to the interior part of an Houfe, it is requifite that the whole Floor be covered with a matterefs of Cotton four inches thick, covered with a white fine linnen Sheet during Summer, and with apiece of filk Tapeftry in Winter : That in the mofleonfpi- cuous part of the Chamber, near the Wall, there be one or two cotton Quilts, with fine flowered Coverings, and fet about with fmall and fine embroidery of Silk,wrought with Gold and Silver, for the Mafler of the Houfe, or Perfons of Quajty coming in, to fit upon i and that every Quilt have its crofs Board, purfled with God, to lean upon : that roundabout the Chamber, along the Walls, there befeveral of thefe crofs Boards, as I juft now mentioned, handfomly covered with Velvet or flowred Sattin, for By- flanders alfo to lean upon. The Walls five or fix foot from the Floor, muft be almoft all with Niches, or little Windows, cut in an hundred different manners, orfhapes, ve ry fine, well meafured and proportioned to one another, with fome porcelain Veflels and Flower-pots in them &gt; and the Ground muft be painted and guilded, yet without any figure of Man or Beaft, their Religion not allowing thereof. This is as near as I know, the Idea of a handfom and convenient Houfe in thefe Parts: And as there is a good number of them inVehli, that have all thefe Qualities mentioned, or at leaft in part, accorditig to which they are more or lefs fair and gal lant: I believe one may fay, without any injury toourTowns, that Vehli is not with out Houfes thatare truly handfom, although they be not like ours in Europe. Concerning the Appearance and Riches of the Shops, ( which is the thing that com tributeth molt to the beauty of our Towns in Europe) although Debli he the Seat of a ve- *y potent and magnificent Court, and confequently the refort of infinite quantities and varieties of rich Wares &gt; yet we are not to imagine, that you (hall find there our Streets M 28o Dehli and Agra capital of St. Denis i I know not whether there be any fuch in all /Ifia* And even as to the moft fine and the moft rich Stuffs, they are commonly but in the Magazins, their Shops are not furnifiit with them : So that for one Shop that maketh any (hew, that is, where there are fold thofe fine forts of Linnen, thofe Stuffs of Silk ftreaked with Gold and Sil ver, Cloth of Gold, Turbands embroidered with Gold, and other Commodities of great price j you (hall always find five and twenty and more, that are filled with nothing but Pots of Oyl and Butter, and Panniers one upon another full of Rice, Barley, Peafe Corn, and many other forts of Grain and Legume s which are the ordinary Food not only of all the Gentiles^ that never eat any meat, but alfo of the meaner fort of the Ma- bumetans^ and of a good part of thofe of the Souldiery. It is true that there is a Fruit-market that maketh feme (hew. One may there fee in Summer abundance of Shops full of dry Fruit, that come out of Balk, Bobgra, and Samarkand, as Almonds, Pifiaches, fmall Nuts, Raifins, Prunes, Apricocks, and the like. And in Winter there are found excellent Raifins frelh, black and white, brought from the fame Countries, well wrapt up in Cotton i alfo Apples and Pears of three or four forts, and of thefe admirable Melons that lafi: all Winter. But all this Fruit is very dear i I have feen Melons fold even for a Crown and an half a piece. And they are in deed the great delicacy and expence of the Omrahs, I have often feen in the Houfe of ray Aga, that there was eaten in Melons in one morning for more than twenty Crowns. There are none but the Melons of the Country that are cheap in Summer, but thofe are not fo good. The Grandees only, that take care to fend for Seed out of Ferfia, and to get the Ground well fitted 'for them, may eat good ones i yet that but rarely neither, * the Ground being not fo proper but that the Seed degenerateth the very firft year. It is true, there is yet another Fruit called Amba, or Mangue, which in its feafon, during two Summer months, is found in great plenty and very cheap •&gt; but thofe of Dehli are none of the belt, being very loofe and fiafhly : thofe oi Bengal a, Golkpnda, and Gea, are admirable. It hath a certain fweetnefs fo peculiar, that I doubt whether there be any Comfit in the World fo pleafant. There are alfo Fateques, or Water-Melons in abundance, and almoff all the year long i but they alfo do not thrive well at Debit j they never have their meat fo ruddy, firm and fuggary *, and if there be any good, they are not to be found but amongft the Great ones, who take the pains of making them grow as Melons, with extraordinary care and coil. There be alfo up and (fown in Dehli Shops of Comfit- makers i b,ut all their Comfits are very ill done, being fullof Duft and Flyes. There are befides many Shops of Bread every where, but becaufe they have no Ovens like ours, it is never well baked: yet in the Fortrefs there is fold fome that isreafona- bly good i and the Omrahs caufe fuch to be made in their Houfes that is very delicate, fparing no new Butter, Milk, nor Eggs: yet though they leaven it, it is always much inferior in goodnefs to our Bread of GoneJJe, and to thofe other forts of excellent Bread of Paris, it favouring always of the Cake or Simnel. In thefe Bazars there are alfo fome Tents, where they trade in Roft-meat, and in dreffing I know not how many forts of Difhes i but all that is but beggarly, na|iy, and ill meat. I fear you fometimes meet with the fielh of Camels, Horfes, or Oxen, dead of (icknefs : I do not much truft them j fo that if you will eat any thing wortheating, you muft have it dreffed at home. ^ There are alfo many Shops every where where they fell Fleflh ■&gt; but you muft take heed, left they give you Mutton for Kid i the Mutton and Beef, but efpecially Mutton, though well enough tafted, being here very hot, windy, and of ill digeftion. The beft meat here is young Kid, but it is very rarely fold in the Market by Quarters i fo that if you have a mind to eat any, you muft buy a whole and a live one i which is inconvenient enough, becaufe the meat is fpoiled between one morning and evening, and is common ly fo lean, that it is tafielefs. Ordinarily you find in the Shambles nothing but the quarters,of great Kids, which often alfo are very lean and hard. It is true, that fince I have learned fomething of the manner of the Country, I find both Meat and Bread good enough, becaufe I fend my Servant to the Fortrefs to the King’s Caterers, whoare've- ry ready to let him have what is good for good payment, though it coft them nothing. And it was in reference to this, that one day I made my Agah fmile, when I told him that I had 1 know not how many years lived by artifice and dealing, and that for all the 150 Crowns pay he monthly allowed me, I was ready to be ftarved &gt; whereas in France for half a Roupy, I could every day eat as good a bit of meat as the King. TheyCities of Indoftan. They have no Capons, all that People bang too tender-hearted towards all Animal* but Men, whom they need for then Seraglios. But the Markets are full of Hen* That are very good and cheap : Among the reft there is one fort of little ones, that I hailed /Ethiopian Mens, becattfe they have them skin black like which are very tender and very delicate. r 5 vcr / Pidgeons 'hereare but no young ones, becaufe they will not kill them young; they wou d be ( fay they ) too fmall and it were ill done to kill fuch poor little Animals. 5 There are alfo Partridges, but fmaller than ours, and generally ( feeing they brin» them afar off alive, knowing how to take them with Nets ) they are wcrfe than ou- b ' “ '' l - Dud,! “ d 'hey .Ifot Concerning Fijh, the People here are no great FiOi-mongers i yet at times one meefq with very good F,(h, cfpecially of two forts, the one refemble Jour Pike, and theo- ther our Carp ; but that is only when it is not cold, for the Indians fear that much more han we Europeans apprehend heat. And if at any time you meet accidentally with any, the Eunuchs, who love them exceffively, (I know not why J) carry them prefently 1 - way. None but the (Wuhave power to make men hih when they pkafe, which they do with the that great common Whip always hanging at their Gates. from all that Ihavefaid, you may by the By fee, whether a man ought to leave Pa- re to come to Debit to make good cheer. Certainly the Grandees have all thines but that is upon the account of their many Servants, of the and of the plenty of Money. And thence it was I once faid, that at Vehli there is no mean ; there you muff either be a great Lord, or live miferably : for I have cxperienced.it my felf, in a man ner dying ot Hunger this good while, though I have had conliderable Pay, and was re- lolved to ipare nothing that way, becaufe commonly there is found nothing in the Mar kets but the refufe of the Grandees. Befides that, the foul of aFeaft which is good Wine, is not there; not that no Grapes do grow there to make Wine, ( for 1 have drunk tome itAmadevad and Golkonda, in theHoufesof and Hollanders, that was not ill &gt; but becaufe it is prohibited to make Wine, in regard that not only by the Uw ot Mahomet, but alfo by that of the Heathen, it is not permitted to drink any : So that it is very rare to find Wine, and that which we find comes out of Perfia from by Land to Bandefabafy, from thence by Sea to Smatte, and from hither by Land A r itCOmeS fr ° m tiic Canaries, brought alfoover Sea to Smatte by the Dutch. And both are fo dear, that the coft ( as the faying is ) maketh it lofe the taite, tor a Bottle holding about three pints cometh often to fix or feven Crowns, and more. That which is of this Countreys growth is called Arac, a ftron* Water made of Sug^r not refined, and even this is expreily prohibited to be fold, and there are none but fhnftians that dare drink of it, except others do it by health. This is a Drink very hot and penetrant, like the Brandy made of Corn in Poland. It fo falls upon the Nerves, that it often caufeth (baking Hands in thofe that drink a little too much of it, and cafis them into incurable Maladies. Here we muff accuftom our felves to fair and good Water, and to Lemonade, which is excellent, and may be made with imall charges, and doth not fpoil the Stomach. But to fay all, a man hath no great in clination, in fuch hot Countries as thefe to drink Wine j and I am willing notice fhould be here taken together with me, that the abftinence from Wine in thefe Parts, ioyned ° the general fobriety of the Natives, and to the fweats and perpetual tranfpiration made by the pores, are the caufe ( in my opinion J that we almoft know not what is neCout, the Stone, Aches of the Kidneys, Rheumatifms, Quartans , and that thofe mat bring any of thefe Sickneffes hither, as I did, are at length totally freed from them: and further, that the Pox it felf, though very frequent, is not fo cruel nor fo pernicious nere as m Europe : fo that People generally live here more healthily than with us. But men on the other hand, there is not fo much vigour here in People, as in our cold Cli~ rnaf i and this feeblenefs and languor of body is a kind of perpetual malady, very troubleiom to all, efpecially in the great heats of Summer, and efpecially to the Europe- ans, whofe bodies are not yet inured to heat. As for Shops of excellent Handy-craftfmen, that is alfo a thing we mufi: not look fof nere : all we find is but very little j not that the Indians have not wit enough to make nem fuccefsful in Arts, they doing very well (astofome of them ) in many Parts of ^ 5 , li bdn g ^und tbat they have inclination enough for them, and that feme of em make ( even without a Mafkr ) very pretty woskmanlhip, and is&amp;itate fo well82 Dehli captal out Work of Europe, that the difference thereof will hardly be difcerned. I have fe en . atnonaft thetneven of our kind of Guns, very hne and very good i and pieces of Gold- fmifht Work fo well done, that 1 doubt whether in Europe they could be made better. I have affo feen in Pitt ™and Miniature fuch curious and delicate pieces that 1 admi red them Amongft others, I have feen the Combats of Ectyar, reprefented upon a Buckler by a famous Painter, who was faid to have been feven years working at jt, which feemed to me an admirable piece of Work. It is man.feft, that they want no thing but good Matters, and the precepts of Art to g.ve them ,i.ft proportions i and above all, that life of the Face, to which they have not yet been able to attain, fhe Reafon therefore why in the Shops of Debit there are rarely found good Handy-craftf- men is not want of Wit, but contempt of the Workmen, who are ill treated, and whofc WoA is debafed m too low a price. If fome Ornrab or Manfibdar will have anv thing made by a Workman of the Bazar, he will fend for him, and make him work ini manner by force, and afterwards pay him as he pleafeth i and the man will think himfelf happy too, if in part of payment he receive not the K&lt;»rr A What heart then can a poor Workman have to take pains to fucceed in his Workmanlh.p ? Heconhders nothing but to difpatch his Work, thereby to earn fometh.ng to put Bread into Ins .Mouth So that if there be any of them that fucceed, they are of thofe whom the great Lords entertain in their Service, and that work only for them. Touching the things within theFortrefs, where are the Smtgto, and fome other Royal Edifices, you mutt not look for a Louvre, or an Efeurtal i thofe Buildings do not referable ours, nor by what I have faid, ought they to referable them: it is enough that they have that ftatelinefs, which is proper to the Climat. I find nothing remarkable at the entry, but two great Elephants of ftone, which are on the two fides of one of the Gates. Upon one of them is the Statue of Jaml, that famous Raja of Cbitar, and upon the other, that of Polta his Brother. Thefeare thofe two gallant Men, that together with their Mother, who was yet braver than they, pit fo much Work for Eckbar ; and who in the Sieges of Towns, which they maintained againft him, gave fuch extraordinary proofs of their Generofity, that at length they would rather be killed in the out-falls with their Mother, than fubmit: and for this Gallantry it is, that even their Enemies thought them worthy to havethefe Statues eretfted for them. Thefe two great Elephants, together with the two refolute Men fitting on them, do at the firft entry into this Fortrefs make an impreflionoi I know not what greatnefs and awful terror. frt After you have paffed this Gate, you find a long and large Street, divided in o by a Channel of running Water, and having on both fides, as our Pont-neut, ak)ng railed Wall five or fix foot high, and four broad *, and further off fome Arches (hut, that follow one another all along in the form of Gates. It is upon this long railed me that thofe Clerks, Controllers, and other fmall Officers fit to do their Office,^ without being incommoded by the Horfes and People that pafs along beneath. An^ it is ter alfo where the Manjeb-dars, or little Omrabs^ are at night to keep the Guard, inc Water of the Channel runneth dividing it felf through the whole Seraglio, zv\d at iengm falleth into the Ditches to fill them. It is drawn out of the River by a Channel opene five or fix leagues above Debli, and conveyed crofs the Field, and that throug o Rocks that have coft great pains to be cut in divers places. And this is very near w a may be feen at the entry into one of the two principal Gates, that anfwer to t eg r If you enter at the other Gate, you alfo find prefently a pretty long and large Street, having its rifings on the fides as the other, together with Shops upon them in Iku or rn Arches. This Street is properly a Bazar, which is very commodious during the ie . of the Rains and Summer, becaufe it is covered by a long and large Vault, whten n on the top great openings to let in light. t , j uc t uW Befides thefe two Streets, there are many other fmall ones on the right and lett n , that lead to the Apartments, where the Omrabs keep their Guard, each ,n hI , ’ once a week, for twenty four hours. Thefe Places are ftately ones for Corps e ’ the Omrabs driving to beautifie them at their own charges. Thele are ordinan y &amp; raifed Places refpe&amp;inga that hath its little Channels of running a ’ 0 f ConferVatories and Jets of Water. The Omrabs during the twenty our Guard, take no care for their Table, the King fending them all their eat rea T, ^ fed, and they being but to receive it, as they do, with very much Ceremony ■ . ^ •• ■ \ ' ' T ' ' &gt; mCities of Indoftan. fp&lt;A making three obeyfances of thanks, by elevating their Hand noon their Head and bowmg down to the ground, their Face turned toward the King. ' ’ There are alfo found many raifed Walks and Tents in fundry Places that are the Offices of feveral Officers. Befides, there are many great Halls that are the Kar-hanay, or Places where Handy-craftfmen do work. In one of thefe Halls you ffiall lind Em ’ broiderers at work, together with their Chief that infpects them i in another vou ffiall fee Gold-fmiths; in a third Pidurc-drawers i in a fourth Workmen in Laccl ; i n o thers, Joyners, Turners, Taylors, Shoo-makers , in others, Workmen in Silk and pur fled Gold, and m all thofe forts of fine Cloth, of which they make Turbands Girdles with golden flowers, and thofe Drawers of Ladies, that are fo fine and delicate as that fometimes they lalt them but one night, though they often coinhem ten or twelve Crowns, when they are of that falhion, as I have mentioned &gt; I mean, enriched with thofe fine Embroideries of Needle-work. ’ cnnenecl WIth All thefe Handy-craftfmen come in the morning to thofe Kar-kgnays, and work there all day long, and at night return to their feveral homes, every one palling his Life qui etly, without afpiring above his condition: for the Embroiderer maketh his Son an Em broiderer, the Gold-fmith maketh his Son a Gold fmith, and a Phyfician in a Town maketh his Son a Phyfician; and no body marrieth but with thofe that are of his Trade • which is religioufly obferved, not only among the Heathen, that are obliged to it by their Law, but almoft always among the Mahometans themfelves : Whence it is that you may often fee very handfom young Women, that remain unmarried, paifing their time as well as they can, though they might meet with good Matches, if their Parents would or could marry them into another Family, efteemed lefs noble than their own. After all thefe Apartments, we come at length to the Am-bs, which is fomethine very Royal. This is a great fquare Court with Arches, as may be our Place RcyaH with this difference, that there are no Buildings atop, and that the Arches are fevered from one another by a Wall, yet fo that there is a fmall Gate to pafs from one to the other. Over the great Gate, which is in the middle of one of the fides of this Square thereis a large raifed Place, all open on the fide of the Court, which is called Naoar- krnay, becaufe that is the Place where the Trumpets are, or rather the Hoboys and Tim bals, that play together in confort at certain hours of the day and night: but this is a very odd confort in the Ears of an European that is a njw comer, not yet accuftomed to it: for fometimes there are ten or twelve of thofe Hoboys, and as many Timbals, that found altogether at once ; and there is an Hoboy which is called Kama, a fathom and an hafl long, and of half a foot aperture below; as there are Timbals of Brafs or Iron, that have no lefs than a fathom in diameter: whence it is eafie to judge, what a noife they muft needs make. Indeed this Mufick in the beginning did fo pierce and ftun me that it was unfufferable for me; yet I know not what ftrange power cuftom hath, for I now find it very pleafing, efpecially in the night, when I hear it afar off in my bed upon my Terrafs ; then it feemeth to me to carry with it fomething that is grave, ma- jeflical and very melodious. And there is fome Reafon for this melody; for feeing it hath its Rules and Meafures, and that there are excellent Mailers taught from their youth to manage it, and perfe&amp;ly know how to qualifie and temper thofe ftrong founds of the Hoboys and Timbals, it cannot be otherwife, but they mud thence obtain fome lympathy that cannot be difpleafing to the Ear, provided ( as I faid J that it be heard at a diftance. And even for this Reafon it is, that they have placed the Nagar-kanay very high, and remote from the Ears of the King, as you will hear by and by; Over again!! the great Gate of the Court, upon which is the Nagar-k^anay, beyond the whole Court, there is a great and ftately Hall, with many ranks of Pillars high raif- p 3 ver y air V, °P en on three fides, looking to the Court, and having its Pillars and Ground painted and guilded. In the midft of the Wall, which feparateth this Hall rom the Seraglio, there is an opening, or a kind of great Window high and large, and «• high that a Man cannot reach to it from below with his hand: There it is where the mg appears ieated upon his Throne, having his Sons on his fides, and fome Eunuchs handing, fome of which drive away the Flyes with Peacocks-tails, others fan him with great Pans, others Hand, there ready with great refpedt and humility for feveral Servi- | Sl Thence he ieeth beneath him all the Omrahs, Rajas, and Ambaffadors, who are al- 1 ° al, ot thcm Handing upon a raifed Ground encompafled with filver Rails, with their tyes downwards, and their Hands doffing their Stomachs: fomewhat further off he feefhM t i / 8 4 Dehli and Agra capital feeth the Manfebdars, or kffetOmrabs, which are alfo all handing m the fame poftute and refpeca as the Omrabf do: and fomewhat further off, m the remaining part of the Hall and in the Court, he feeth a great crowd of all forts of People. For there it is where the King every day about noon giveth a general Audience to alb which is the Reafon that this great Hall is called that is, Place of Audience, or a Place of Meeting common to great and fmall. ui i n a v During an hour and an half, or thereabouts, whilft this AlTembly laheth, the King is diverted by feeing pafs before him a certain number of the handfometl Horfes of his Stables to fee whether they be welldreffed, and in good plight. So he doth feea good number of Elephants pafling alfo before him, whofe dirty bodies are then well v waftied and cleanfetf, and painted black like Ink, except that they have two great ftreaks painted red, which from the top of their Head come down to their Trunk, where they meet. Thefe Elephants have then alfo certain deckings embroidred with a couple of lilver Bells hanging down on thefides, faftened to the two ends of a great iilyer Chain, paffing over their Shoulders i as alfo certain Cow-tails of the great Tibet^ white and very dear, hanging at their Ears like great Muftachoes : and two little Elephants well accoutred going by their fides, as if they were their Slaves and appointed to iervethem. Thefe great Colofles, as if they were proud to fee themfelves fo bravely adorned and at tended, march with much gravity &gt; and when they are come before the King,the Con- dudfor that fits upon their Shoulders, with a pointed Iron in his Hand pricketh them, and fpeaketh to them, and maketh them bow with one Knee, and lift up the Irunk into the Air and make a noife, which the People take for a ‘Taflim, or ha ute. After thefe Elephants there are brought divers tamed G^zel/ej*, which are made to fight with one another j as alfo fome Nilgaux^ or grey Oxen, which in my opinion are a kind of Elands and Rbinocerofs, and thofe great Buffalos of Bengala with their prodigi ous Horns to combat with a Lion or Tiger? like wife Leopards, ot Panthers tame , which he ufeth&lt;in the hunting of Gazelles: further, fome of thofe handfom hunting Dogs of Vsbeck,of all forts, every one with his little red Cover*, ftore of Birds of prey of all kinds, fome of which are for Partridges, others for Granes,others to b upon &lt; ares, and, as they fay, upon the very Gazelles, beating their Heads and blinding them with their Wings and Claws, • r t f Often alfo one or two of the Omrabs caufe at that time to pafs their Cavalry tor a review before the King : the Omrahs coveting that their Horfemen fhould appear gallant, advantagioufly decked with extraordinary Garments, and their Horfes trappe wit Iron, and harneffed with l know not how many different and odd fathions. The King taketh fometimes pleafure himfelf to caule Cutlafes, or Oiprt Swords, to be tryed upon dead Sheep, brought to him without the bowels, and very Y 5 up, where the young Omrahs, Manfeb-dars and Gourze-berdars, or Mace- carers, nv to (hew their force and dexterity by cutting afunder the lour Legs joyned toget er, an the Body of the Sheep all in one broken r . A#4rc* Mean time all thefe Divertifements are nothing but an Interlude of fenous M • for as I have faid, the King omits not to make a Mutter ot his Cava ry, an view them himfelf. We have feen, that the War being enaed there is not one Cava lier, nor any other Souldier, but He hath feen him and examined him, either to i his Pay, or to leffen it, or quite to caftiier him. Befides it is feen every day, that he commands the Petitions, which are {hewed him afar off in the crowd o t e eop , be brought to him and to be read : ordering the Parties concerned to approac , examining them, and often cauling Juftice to be done them immediate y, a t o S hath the Adalet-kanay, the Chamber of Juftice, where he ordmarffy isfreknt week, attended by his twofirft Kadys, or Chief Juftices : and though alfo^a one ot_ time in the week he hath the patience to hear in private, ^ *P acc ° ten Perfons of the common People, whom a good and rich old Man pre Whence it appears ( to note that by the By) that thofe Kings, how barbaro efteemed by us, do yet conftantly remember, that they owe juftice to tn All what I have been relating to you of what is tranfa&amp;ed in this AffemHyoFthe^ hpts, feems to me great and royal j but that which hath extreamly o £ n e gw a kind of Adulation too mean and flat, commonly heard in that j lace.

If the King faith at Noon-day, it is Night, you are to fay, behold the Moon and the Stars, This Vice paileth even unto the People. I have feen an hundred times People of Mo- gol, who having need of me in fome Bufinefs, made no fcruple to come and tell me to my Face for a Preamble, that I was Ariftotalis, Bocrate , and Abouyfma Vlzaman i the Ariftotle, the Hippocrates, and the Avicenna of the Time. At firft I endeavoured to fence my felf againir it by this ordinary Complement, that I was none fuch, and was far infe rior to the merit of thofe Men : but that made them worfe s fo that I thought it better to accuftom my Ears to their Flattery, as I have done to their Mufick. I cannot forbear imparting to you this little piece of Flattery, becaufe that will let you fee the more how far they carry it. A Pendet Brachman, or Heathen Dodfor, whom I had put to ferve my Agah, at the entring into his Service would needs make his Panegyrick, and after he had compared him to the greateft Conquerors that ever were, and told him an hundred grofs and impertinent Flatteries, at laft concluded ferioufly with this j ff'hen you put your Foot into the Stirrup, my Lord, and ivhm you march on Horfe-bacfin the front of the Cavalry, the Earth trembleth under your feet, the eight Elephants, that hold it up upon their Heads, not being able to fupport it. I could not hold laughing, and I drove leri- ' cully to tell my Agah, who could not hold neither, that then he would do well not to goonHorfe-back but very feldom, to prevent Earthquakes, which often caufe fo great Mifchiefs. Who quickly made this Reparty with a confirained Countenance between ferious and imiling : And it is therefore that I caufe my felf ordinarily to be carried in a Pale- ' ky* *'. • - '■; &gt;' ■ ■ But no more of this: from the great Hall of the Am-kgs one enters into a more retired Place, called the Gofelkane, that is, the Place to walh in. But few are fuffered to enter there &gt; neither is the Court of it fo great as that of the Am-kas: but the Hall is very handfom, fpacious, painted and guilded, and its Floor raifed four or five foot high. There it is where the King is feated in a Chair, his Omrahs handing round about him, and giveth a more particular Audience to his Officers, receiveth their Accompts, and treateth of the mofi: important AfFairsof State. All the Omrahs are obliged to be with out fail every evening at this AfTembly, as in the morning at the Am-ktfi elfe fome- thing is retrenched of their Pay. There is only my Agah Danechmend-kgn, that becaufe he is a Perfon of Learning, and perpetually bufie in ftudying, or in foreign Affairs, is difpenfed with, except Wednefday, which is his day of being upon the Guard. Thefe ' are indifpentihleCuftoms, and it is very juft they Ihould be fo in refpect of the Omrahs, becaufe they are in a manner fo in refped of the King: for he almoft never faileth to be at thefe two Affemblies, unlefs fome urgent Affair do fupervene, or he be exceeding lick. And we did fee, that Aureng-Zebe, even in his laft Sicknefs, which was very dangerous, failed not to make himfelf to be carried thither once a day at leaft. It is true, he being fick to extremity, that if he had not been feen there, the whole King dom would prefently have been in diforder, and the Shops fliut up in the City. Whilft the King in this Hall of Gofletynay is bufie, as I was faying, they omit not to let pafs before him moft of the things that are made to pafs at the Am-kas. There is only this difference, that this Affembly being held in the evening, and the Court being then kfs, the review of the Cavalry of the Omrahs is not made, as in the morning at the Am-tys : but then there is this of particular, that all the Manfeb-dars that are upon the Guard do falute the King, and pafs before him with Ceremony enough : before them marcheth with fufficient Pomp- that which is called the Kours, which are many Figures of Silver carried at the end of fome great filver Sticks, that are very fine and ve ry artificially made •» of which there are two that reprefent two great Fifties, two o~ thers that exhibit a phantaftick Animal of an horrid figure, by them called Eiedeba j o- thers that reprefent two Lions, others two Hands, others Scales, and many more where of they make Myfteries. Amongffthefe and are mixt many Goar- ze-berdars, or Mace-bearers, who are chofen Men, tall of Stature, and of a good Mean, ( fpoken of elfewhere ) and appointed to prevent Diforders in Affemblies, and to run about withfpeed tocarry the Orders, and to execute the Commands of the King. N f I now- .Dehli and Agra I bow wi&amp; I could lead you about in the Seraglio^ as I have done in the reft of the Fortrefs : but who is the Traveller that can fpeak of that as an Eye-witnefs ? I have fomedmes entred into it when the King was not at Dehli^ and I think pretty far, up 0n die occafion of a great Lady, that was fo fick that die could not be carried to the Gate according to cuftom i but I had always a Covering of Kachemire over my Head, which like a great Scarf hung down to my Feet, and an Eunuch conduced me by the Hand like a blind Man, fo that I cannot particularly defcribe to you what it is. Only in gene ral I can tell you, according to what I have learnt from fome Eunuchs, that in it there are very handfom Apartments fevered one from another, more or lefs great and (lately according to the Quality and the Penfions of the Women i that there is almoft no Chamber but it hath at its Door a Store-houfe of running Water &gt; that kis full of Par terres, pleafant Walks, (hady Places, Rivolets, Fountains, Jets of Water, Grbtta’s, great Caves againfi the heat of the day, and great TerrafTes raifed high, and very airy, f 0 deep upon in the cool s in a word, you know not there what kis to be hot. They prin cipally boaft of a little Tower refpeding the River, being, fay they, covered with Plates of Gold, as thofc two that are at 4 gra, and within all Gold and Azure, very handfom and rich Figures and Looking-glaffes. This is very near what I can tell you of the Fortrefs,, yet before we leave it, let us return once more to the Am-bfl. I am now going to reprefent it to you after the man ner I faw it at certain Fehivals of the Year, efpecially at that which was kept after the War for an extraordinary rejoycingi for this is one of the mod remarkable things 1 have feen* The King appeared iitting upon his Throne, in the bottom of the great Hall of the Am-kai, fpiendidly apparelled. His Veit was of white Sattin Fowred, and raifed with a very fine Embroidery of Gold and Silk. His Turban was of Cloth of Gold, having a Fowl wrought upon it like an Heron, whofe foot was covered with Diamonds of an extraordinary bignefs and price, with a great Oriental Topas, which may be faid to be imtchlefs, {tuning like a little Sun. A Collar of big Pearls hung about his Neck down to his Stomach, after the manner that fome Heathens wear here their great Beads. His Throne was fupported by fix high Pillars, or Feet, faid to be of maifie Gold, and fet with Rubies, Emeralds and Diamonds. I am not able to tell you aright, neither the number nor the price of this heap of precious Stones, becaufe it is not permitted to come near enough to count them, and to judge of their water and purity. Only thisf can fay, that the big Diamonds are there in coofufion, and that the Throne is eflirmted to be worth four Kmrmre? of Roupies, if I remember well. I have faid elfewhere, that a Rmjiie is almoft equivalent to half a Crown, a Leeque to an hundred theufand Rou- pks, and a Kmrour? to an hundred Lecques : fo that the Throne is valued forty millions of Roupies, which are worth about fixty millions of French Livers. Cbab-Jehan^ the Father of Aureng-Zebe, is he that caufed it to be made, to fhew fo many precious Stones as fucceifively had been amaffedin the Treafury, of theSpoyls of thofe ancient Fat a ns and and of thePrefents which the Ommhs are obliged to make yearly upon cer tain Feftival days. The Art and Workmanfhip of this Throne is not anfwerable to the Matter: that which! find upon it beff devifed, are two Peacocks covered with precious Stones and Pearls, which are the work of a French-man, called— that was an admirable Workman, and that after having circumvented many Princes with his Doub lets, which he knew how to make admirably well, Fed unto this Court, where he made his Fortune. Beneath this Throne there appeared all the Otnrahs in fpiendid Apparel, upon a raifed Ground covered with a great Canopy of purFed Gold with great golden Fringes, and inclofed by a filver BaliFre. The Pillars of the Hall were hung witb Ta- peftries of purFed Gold, having the ground of Gold * and for the roof of the Hall, there was nothing but great Canopies of Fowred Sattin, faftened with red filken Cords, that had big tufts of Silk mixt with threads of Gold hanging on them. Below there was , nothing to bcfeenbut great filkcnTapeftries very rich, of an extraordinary length and breadth. In the Court there was fet abroad a certain Tent they call the AJj&gt;ex, as long and large as the Hall and more. It was joyned to the Hall by the upper part, and reached almoft as far as to the middle of the Court b mean time it was all inclofed by a great BaliFre covered with Plates of Silver. It was fupported by three Pillars, being of the thicknefs and heightof aBarge-maft, and by fome leffer ones, and they all were co vered with Plates of Silver. It was red from without, and lined within with thofe fine Chines, or Cloth painted by a Pencil of MaJUpatan, purpofdy wrought and contrivedCities of Indoftan. with fuch vivid Colours, and Flowers To natural drawn of an hundred feveral falhions andihapes, that one would have faid, it were an hanging Parterre. Thus was the great Hall of the Am-kas adorned and fet out. As to thofe arched Galleries, which I have fpoken of, that are round about the Court , each Omrab had received order to drefs one of them at his own charges. And they now driving who ftiould make his own mod dately, there was feen nothing but pur- fled Gold above and beneath, and rich Tapedries under foot. The third day of the Fead, the King caufed himfelf to be weighed with great Cere mony, and after him diversOrirabs, in great Scales, and with Weights faid to be of maffie Gold. I remember that all the Omrabs expreffed a great joy, that the King weighed two pounds more now than the year preceding. Every year there are held fuch kind of Fedivals, but never any was feen done with fo muchfplendor and charge. It is faid, that that which induced Aureng-Zebe to celebrate this fplendid Fead, was nothing elfe but to make the Merchants of purfledGold reco ver themfelves, who had whole Magazins full of it, much fpoiled in thofe four or five years of War, wherein they could not fell them. Thefe Expences of the Omrabs were great i but the fimple Cavaliers paid their {hare of it, becaufe that the Omrabs after the Fcad made them take off that Commodity to make Veds thereof. There is an ancient Gudom accompanying thefe heads, which little pleafeth the Om- rahs : And it is this, that then they are by refped: obliged to make feme fair Prefents to the King in proportion of their Pay. There are fome, that to appear brave, or for fear of being fearched for the Rapines by them committed in their Offices and Govern-, marts j or to purchafe the Favour of the King, in the hopes of having their Penfions augmented, make him Prefents that are extraordinary. Some ( which is ordinary enough ) do prefent fine Veffels of Gold fet with precious Stones b others prefent fair Pearls, Diamonds, Emeralds, or Rubies i others ( which alfo is very common) give him, without other Ceremony, a quantity of thdfe pieces of Gold, that are worth a- bout a Pidol and an half. I remember, that Ameng-Zebe, being gone tovifit ( during this great Fedival ) his Vifir Jafer-tyn, notas Vifir, but as a Kinfman, and under the pretence of defiring to fee a piece of Building, whieh he had caufed to be raifedanew, Jafer-han prefented him in thefe pieces of Gold, with the value of an hundred thoufand Crowns, fome good Pearls, and one Ruby valued forty thoufand Crowns j but which Cbah- Jeban, who was admirably well skill’d in Jewels, difeovered not to be worth five hundred Crowns , the which perplexed the firii Jewellers exceedingly, that had been deceived therein. There is another thing fometimes attending thefe Feafts, which is odd enough : And that is a kind of Fair, then held in the Mebale^ or the King’s Seraglio. The Women of the Omrabs and of the great Mavfeb-dars, or little Omrabs ( I mean thofe that are the handfomefi and the molt gallant ) are theShe-Merchants that keep the Fair, and fell Commodities i the Kindis the Merchant that buyeth, as alfo all thofe or Prin- ccffes, and other great Ladies of the Seraglio. The Wares are fine purfled Gold, or rich Embroideries of the new faffiion, fome rich Ribbons well wrought upon Cloth of Gold, or fome pieces of that fine Cloth which is worn by the great Ladies, and other fuch Merchandize of great price'. If they have ever a handfom Daughter, they forget not to bring her along with them to let the King lee her, and fo make her known to thofe Begums. The jeff of this Fair is, that the King comes to bargain with thofe She- Mcrchants, like a petty Merchant, penny by penny, contefting that they are not in ear- neffi that it is too dear, that he will give no more than fo muchj that the Merchandize of fuch an one is far better, and the like. The Women, on the other hand, do their, befi to make good their part, and without confidering that ’tis the King, ( which is the heft of the fport ) they contend and ftand upon their price, till fometimes they come to high words, as that that is to be a Merchant of Snow, ( one of their phrafes ) that he underfiands nothing in the matter of Wares, that he may go to another Place, that that Commodity is not for him, &amp;e. The Begums do the like, or worfe, for they fometimes fall to downright railing, fo that there is fuch a cry andnoife, and boufonnery, that it cannot be parallel’d. But when any price is agreed on, whoever buyeth on this or that fide, the King payeth, and the Begums pay, all withready money: and it alfo falls out often enough, that the King and the Begums, infiead of Silver Roupies, let Aide ( in favour of the handfom She-Merchant, or her Daughter ) fome Roupies of Gold, as if 3 twere by mifiake, and without taking notice of any thing. The She-Merchants alfo N 2 take88 Dehli and Agra capital - I take it in like manner, all paffeth with exprellions of rallcry and gallantry. Cbah- Jehan^ who did not hate the Sex, would hill multiply this Fair, and have it at all Fe- ‘ Itival days, though he knew it did not very well pleafe fome Omrabs. But there is one thing, which to me feems to be a little too extravagant i which is, that thepublick Women, I mean not thofe of the Bazar^ but thofe more retired and coniiderable ones, that go to the great marriages in the houfes of the Omrahs and Manfib-dars to fing and dance, thofe that are called Kenchen, as it you fhould fay, the guilded, the blojfming onesi that thofe , Hay, did alfo enter in the time of Chah-Jebm into the Seraglk at fuch Fairs, and there pa {fed even the whole night in tinging and dancing. Thefe are not of that fort which proftitutethemfelves promifcuouily to all i and they are moll of them handfome and well apparelled, and excellent fingers and dancers, after the mode of the Country, furprifmg in the fupplenefsof their body, and the nimblenefs of their motions, yet in the upfhot of the rank of Publick Women. C bah-Jeh an was not content only to have them come to the Seraglio at thofe Fealls, but when they came to falute him, according to that antient cuftom that obligeth them to come every Wed- nefday to doobeyfanceto the King in the Amhas^ he often made them to enter there, and to pafs all night with him in fuchfports and boufanries^Aureng-Zebe is more ferious, he fuffers them nottocome into the Seraglio : he permits only foot to abrogate the cuft om) that they may ordinarily come every Wednefday to give him the or Salute, in the Am-k#^ at adiftance, but theymuft prefently return home again. Bur lince we are upon thefe Feafts and Fairs, and (peak of thefe Kinchzfts, what hurt were it if i ihould tell you a ifory to make you merry, of one of our French Men * lince Plutarch is of opinion, that little things are not always to be paffed by , and that they often mind us more of the genius and temper of men than the greatejl. This French Man called Bernard, was at this Court about the latter years of King Jehan-Gune, &lt;He muff needs have been fome good Phyfitiam, and withal Excellent in Chirurgery, accord ing to the relations that are made of him. He vvas welcome to Jehan-Guire, and be came very familiar with him, to that degree that they drank and debauched together. Nor did this Jeban-Guire ever think on any thing, but a good cup and merriment, leav ing the management of the State to his Wife, the renowned Nour-Mebale, or Nour-Jeban- Begum, which he ufed to fay, had wit enough to govern the Erfspire without his giv ing himfelfany trouble about it. Befides that this our Country-man had of the King ten Crowns daily pay, he gained yet more by treating thofe great Ladies of the Seraglio, and the grand Omrahs, that all made ufe of him, and prefented him who could heft, becaufe he was both fuccefsful in his Cures, and extraordinarily favoured by the King: But he was a man that could keep nothing, what he received with one hand, he at the fame time gave away with the other,fo that he was known and loved by al],efpecially by thofe Kenchens, upon whom he made great expences, having always a fet of them that paffed the night at hishoufein finging and dancing. Meantime he chanced to fall in love with one of thefe Women that was young and beautiful, and danced exceeding well; but the Mother apprehending leaft the Daughter, by proftituting her fell, ftiould lofe her ftrength and vigor (as it will fall out) would not let her go cut of her fight: fo that could never find any other way to compafs his ends but this. One day when theKing made him a Prefent in the before all theOmrahs, for a confi- derable Cure he had done in the Seraglio, he very fubmiflively gave his Majefty thanks* waving the Prefent,but inftead of it, begged this favour of him, that he would vouchfafe to give him this young Kencbeny, whicl\ he was amorous of, and which Food behiiid him, ready to make the ufualobeyfance to the King. The whole Affembly brake out out into laughter to fee him wave the Prefent, and to hear him make fo ridiculous a de mand, he being a Chrifiian, and the Woman a Mahometan and a ifBut Jeban- Guire, who never troubled his head much with Mahometanifm, and could not hold laughing aloud, prefently commanded that this young Woman (hould be given him, faying, Lay heron his (boulders, and let him carry her away. So faid, fodone ? and in the prefence of the whole Allembly this ife«ck« was put on Ber/i^’s back, who went away thus charged, and carried her to his houfe. I cannot forbear giving you here fan account of a divertifement, which ufually tnefe Feafts end with, and which is unknown to us in Europe : and that is the combat of the Elephants, which the King, the Ladies of the Court, and the Omrahs do behold from feveral apartments of the Fortrefs, and which is (hewn before all the people in this great fandy place which looks to the River.Cities of Indoftan. , v They raife a wall of earth three or four foot broad, and five or fix foot hfoh. The two Elephants that are to fight, meet one another face to face,one on the one fide of the wall, the other on the other, each having two Riders upon him, thatfo, if the firft who fi s on his fhoulders (havmg a great pointed iron in his hand, to turn the Bead on he right or left hand) (hould fall, the other, who fits backward, may caft himfelf into h / ^ h£fe RlcJcis Guides, do animate their Elephants to the Combat and vigoroufly to fall upon their enemy, now flattering them, and by and by chid inf' them as cowards, and very rude£ Kicking them with their heels. After they have been a good while thus chafed and puflit on, then you (hall fee thefe two bulky mafles come to the wall, and bluntly afiault one another, and give fuch cruel blows with their teeth head and trunk, that you would think they would foon firike one another dead. This fightcontmues a while, then ceafeth, and begins afrefh fevcral times, until the mud- wall being overthrown, the flouteft of the two pafleth upon the other, maketh him turn his bac.-s, purfucth him with blows of his teeth and trunk, and gets fuch an hold- aft upon him, that there is no means of feperating them, except it be with the Cber- (yrt, that is, certain artificial fires caft betwixt them, this Animal being very fearful of fire: whence it comes, that fince Fire-arms have been ufed in Armies, Elephants do almoft nogood at all. Itistrue indeed, that fome of thofe brave ones that come out of CeihH) are not fo timerous i but that is not till they have been whole years accuftomed toit bydiichargmg every day Muskets before them, and by carting fquibs between their legs. Meantime, this contfkSt of the Elephants would be no fuch difpleafing light iht were not fo crue^t often happening, that fome of thofe poor Guides are trod under toot and pe«m : for the Elephants in the combat have this malice, that they Itrive above all things to (trike with their trunk, and to pull down the conductor of their ad- verfary * and thence it is,that on the day when thefe poor Riders know they are to make the Elephants fight, they bid farewel to their Wives and Children, as if they were con demned to death. That which encourages and comforts them, is, that if they efcape and quit themfelves well of their doty, the King increafcs their pay, and commands a lack of P eyfjas, which amounts to about fifty French Li vres, to be forthwith given them or if they be killed upon the fpot, he orders that pay to be made to the Widow, and the Office to be given to his Son, if he have any. There is another mifehief, which of ten accompameth this combat i which is, that in this great throng there are always tome perfons overthrown by the Elephant, or trod under foot by the Horfes and .People^ that on a fudden run away all at once,and fall one upon another,when the Elephants are enraged, and the one purfueth the other, fo that then one cannot at any nearnefs look on but with danger. For my part, the fecond time I faw it, I did fufficiently repent for having approached fo nigh, and if I had not had a good Horfe, and two good Servants, 1 believe 1 mould have paid for my curiohty as dear as others. But tis time we (hould leave the F ortrefs, and return into the City, there to obferve to you two things I had forgot. The firft is the great Mofqnee' feen afar off in the midft of the Town, (landing upon a rock, flatted to build upon, and to make round a- bout a large place for four long and fair Streets to end upon, and anfwering to the. four tides of the Mofquee, viz. one to the principal Gate, or Frontifpiece, another behind that, and the two others to the two Gates that are in the middle of the two regaining hdes. To come to the Gates, there are twenty five or thirty fteps of fair and large otones going round about, except the back-part, which is covered with other great Qyarry-ftones to cover the unevenefs of the cut Rock: which contributes much to make thisFabrick make a (hew. The three Entries are (lately, there is nothing but Marble, and their large Gates are covered with Copper Plates exceedingly well wrought. Above me principal Gate, which is much ftatelier than the two others, there are many fmall lurrets of white Marble as well without as within i that in the middle is much big ger and higher than the two others. All the reft of the Mofquee, I mean from thefe t itee Domes unto the great Gate, is without covering, becaufcof the heat of the Coun try i and the whole Pavement is of large (quares of Marble. I grant willingly, that • I s j. r _ uc ^ ure not according to the rules and orders of Architecture, which we efteem is indifpenfably to be followed i yet I obferve nothing in it that offends the eye i but rather find all to be well contrived, and well proportioned : And I do even believe mat if In p*™ we had a Church of this way of Architecture, it would not be diiliked’ i there were nothing elfe in it but that’tis of an extraordinary and furprifing afpect* nd becaufe that, excepting the three great Domes and all the Turrets, which are ofDehli and Agra capital 90 ~~~~ white Marble it appears all red, as if all were nothing elfe but great Tables of red Marble, though it be nothing elfe but a hone very eafie to cut, and which even flaketh off in time &amp; 1 (hall add by the by, that if it be true what is faid of the quarries of this done, 5 tis remarkable, that it grows again every year i whether it be by a petrefcent water yearly tilling it, or otherwife, I decide not. _ .. ^ t . t ^ This Mofquee it is to which the King repaireth every Friday ( which is the Sunday of the Mahumetans ) to pay his devotion. Before he goes out of the Fortrefs, the Streets he is to pafs, are conftantly watered becaufe of the heat and dull. Two or three hundred Mufquetiers are toftand and make a lane about the Gate of the Fortrefs, and as many more on the tides of a great Street that ends at the Mofquee. Their Muf- quets are ftnall, but well wrought, and they have a kind of Scarlet-cafe with a little dreamer upon them. Befides there muff be five or fix Cavaliers well mounted ready at the Gate, and ride at a good diftance before the King, for fear of raiting dud i and their office is to keep off the people. Things being thus prepared, the King is fecn to come out of the Fortrefs feated upon an Elephant richly hamaffed, under a Canopy with Pillars painted and guilded or elfe on a Throne (hining of Gold and Azure, upon two beams, covered with Scarlet or purfled Gold, carried by eight chofen and well accou tred men. The King is followed by a body of Gmrahs, fome of which are on horfe- back, feme in a Palekey. Among thefe Omrahs there are many Manfeb-dars^nd Mace- Bearers' fuch as 1 have before fpoken of. And though this be not that fplendid and magnificent ProcdTion, or rather Mafcarade of the Grand Seignior, (I have no pro- perer name for it ) nor the warlike order of our Kings, it^ being altogether of another faftiion, yet for all that there is fomething great and royal in it. The otkr thing 1 had forgot to acquaint you with, is an Edifice in the City, called the Karvanfarah of thePiincefs i the renowned Begum-Saheb^ddcft Daughter of CM- Jehan, having caufed it to be built at her charges, and willing to contribute fomething to the decoration ol the Town, as all the Omrahs ffrove to do to pleafe Cbab-Jehan. This is another great Square, arched like our Bdlace-B-oytil^ but ffill with this difierence, that one Arch is feparate from the other by a wall, and that in the bottom of every Arch there is a little Chamber *, and befides that, above the Arches there is a Gallery which rangeth round about the building, to enter into as many high Chambers, as there are below. This Place is the Rendezvous of all the great Merchants, Perfians, Vsbeckj^ and other Strangers that ordinarily do tbere had empty Chambers convenient enough, to ftay in for fome time in great fafety, the Gate being (hut every night. If there were a fcore of fuch Structures in divers parts of Paris, Strangers newly arri ving would not be in that trouble, as often they are to find fafe Lodgings i for there they might be until they had feen their Acquaintance, and looked for good Accomoda tion : betides that they would ferve for Magazins of all forts of Commodities, and for the Rendezvous of all Merchants Strangers. # . Before we leave l fhall add a few lines in reference to this quefhon, which doubtlefs you’l make, viz. Whether in Vebli there be as much People and Gallantry as at Paris ? Certainly when 1 confider thofe three nr four Cities of P arts that are one a- bove another, all thofe Chambers and other Rooms full from top to bottom j when farther conlldcr that incredible throng and confution of Men and Women, of nor e rocn and Paffcngers on foot, of Chariots, Sedans and Coaches, and that there are but tew great Piazzas and Gardens in Paris &gt; this City feems to me a Nurfery of the V/orld,and l ean hardly believe, that there are as many People in M/f. Yetnotwithftanding when I rpfied upon that multitude of Shops on one fide of Vebli, and on the other, upon the vaft extent of that City, and that there are never lefs in it then 35000 Cavaliers, not tofpeak of the Houfes of the Omrahs that of all thefe Cavaliers, there are very few but have Wives and Children, and a great number of Servants having their Houles apart as their Mafters •, and that all thefe Houfes fwarm with Women and Children : tnat in many places of though the Streets be broad, and there be but few Chariots and no Coaches, yet at the hours when the heat fuffers People to come abroad tor their bulinefs, there is great confufion '.When ( 1 fay ) l confider all this on the other an , do not well know what to determine about the queftion, and I imagine, that it there e not altogether fo much People in Vebli as in Paris, at leaft there wants not much of if. Concerning the number of gallant People, it muff be acknowledged, that t er ^ this difference between thofe of Paris and Vebli, that of ten Perfons met with upon Streets of Paris, you (hall fee feven or eight well cloathed and of fome faunon, w 1Cities of Indoftan. no Man wi count rafcaliy or beggerly People &gt; whereas inDehli^ for two or three Perfons that are pretty well covered, you (hall always find feven or eight poor and rag* ged People i the Army which is there drawing after it all that crew of Beggers and Rafcals. Yet this is to be acknowledged for a truth, that in as well as in Paris one meets with a very great quantity of Perfons well made, gallant, well mounted’ well dreiied, and w^ell attended. And indeed,to be upon the great Place before the Fortrefs af the hours when all thofe Omrahs, Rajas, and Manfeb-dars go to the AlTembly and to the Guard, that hath fomething, great and fpiendid in it: when you lliall fee there every where arrive thofe Manfeb-dars well accoutred, {Lining with Gold, and well mounted, a couple of Men going before them to make place, and as many behind } when you fhall alfo fee many of thofe great Omrabs 2nd Rajas riding upon proud Elephants and feme of them on Horfe-back like the Manfeb-dars, and moil of them fitting in their rich Paletys, carried upon the {boulders of fix men, their back leaning againft fome thick Cufhion of purfled Gold, chewing their Petek, to have a good breath and vermilion lips, with a Servant on the fide carrying a Tooth-pick, and a Porcelain or filver Spit ting-Veflel i and two more, fanning him and keeping off the flies and duft from him with Peacocks-tails j and three or four others marching before to put by the People i to which is to be added part of their Gavalry fl mean the braveft and beft mounted ©f them ) following after : When, I fay, all this is feen together marching, as hath been faid, with the crowd made there as well as at Paris, it will not be denied to be fome thing great and very gallant. As to the Country about Vebli, it is confiderable for its fertility * for it beareth Rice, Millet, and three or four other forts of Legumes, f which is the ordinary food of the common People ) Corn, Sugar, Indigo, and all that in abundance. At two leagues off the City on Agra's fide, in a place by the Mahumetans called Koja Kotubeddine,xhcxo is a very antient Edifice which hath been a Temple of Idols, where are Infcriptions that muft alfb be very antient, the Charadrers of them being fuch that no body knows what they are, and different from thofe of all the Languages of the Indies, On another fide, at two or three leagues diftance from the Town, you fee an Houfe of pleafure of the Kings, which indeed is a ftately and Royal Houfe, but yet you muft oot think it approach to Fontain-bleau, or to St. Germain, or to Verfaille. Neither muft you imagine that in this Gampagne of Vehli there are any St. Cloux, Chantilly's,Meudons, Liancours, Vaux, Ritelles, and many fuch others ; or that you fee there any of thofe 0- ther inferior Houfes of pleafurebelonging to fimple Gentlemen, Citizens and Merchants. The Maxime, That the Subjedfs of a Kingdom have no propriety in any thing hinders aU that.

Set afide Maturas, where you fee ftill an antient and ftately Temple of Idols, and excepting fome Karavan-farrahs , that are well enough, found on the high-way to fervefor night-lpdgings, I find nothing confiderable there, but that Royal Alley of Trees planted by the command of Jehan-Guire, and continued by the fame order for an hundred and fifty leagues, with little Pyramids or Turrets exeded every half league, to mark the ways, and with frequent wells tb afford drink to Paffengers, and to water the young Trees. or A Ci R A. , T O pafs to the defeription of Agra, you have the Idea of it, if you have well taken thatofMtf/A at leaft in refpedfc of its feituation, which is alfo upon the Gemma, and in regard of the Fortrefs, or Royal Houfe, andofmoftof the Buildings. It true, that Agra hath this advantage over Vehli, that being a City where the Kings have already refided a long while, viz. fince Akber, who caufed it to be built, and called it after his name Ahfer-abad, it is of greater extent then Dehli, and hath more of thofe fine Houfes of the Omrahs 2nd Rajas, and more of the hixKarvanfarrahs , as alfo more pretty Houfes ofStone and Brick belonging to particular Perfons i befides that it hath two famous Tombs, of which I {hall fpeak hereafter : But then it. hath thefe pifadvantages, that it wants Walls •, that having been built altogether by one defign, it hath not thofe fair and large Streets of uniform buildings as Dehli j and that excepting four or five~cf thofe principal Streets of Merchants, which are very long and well N enoughand Agra capital enough built, all the reft for the moft part, is nothing but a number of little Streets, ftreitiht without proportion, and nothing but windings and turnings i which caufes fttange confufions P when the Court is there.

What will it be then when the Loxvre, that work which was once thought would never be feen but in deligu and upon paper, fhall be finilht ? I have purpofely added the word Artificial, becaufe fpealc- ing of the beft Perfpedives that are, we muft always except when one is in a Boat in the midft of that great Channel,over againft the point of the Seraglio: tot there you [hall find your feif altogether furprized, as 5 twere in the midfi of iome great and vaft inchanted Amphitheater •, but in this Perfpecftive the Workmanihip ot Natm is moft confiderable, whereas in that of Pam ^rt and Dexterity is moft conlpicuous, which doubtlefs renders it more eminent, forafmuch as thereby it looks more.I ikc the Seat of a great King, the Capital of a great Empire, and is really, without^ fiattenng our felves, and all thofe beauties of Debli, Agra, and Conftantinople, well coniidered aiM compared, the faireft, the ficheft, and the chiefeftCity of the\/ond. ^ w In Agra the Reverend Fathers the Jefuits have a Church and a Colledge,where in pri vate they teach the Children of feme twenty five or thirty Chriftian families, that have (I know not how) gathered and fettled themfelves there by the charity of thole fathers the Chriftian Dodrine. It was Etyar who (in the time of the great power of the i&lt;r- tugwzes in the Indies) called them, and gave them a penfion for their ( ubl f ten ^ 5 mTtting them to build Churches in the capital Cities of Agra and Labor. And ms Jehm-Guire favoured them yet more. But Chah-Jehan, Son of jeban-Gmre, a |P “ fher of Aureng-Zebe now reigning, took from them their penfion, caufal tnmr^ t at Labor to be pulled down, and the greateft part of that in Agra, overthrowing a o the Steeple of the Church, wherein that Bell was that could be heard over a Town. . Thefe Fathers the Jefuits entertained great hopes of theprogrefs of Chriftianity m the time of King Jeban-Guire, becaufe of his contempt of the Mabutnetan Law, an^ the efteem he profelfed to the Cbrijlian, even giving way to two of his Ne P bews ^° j 0 ?* brace the Chriftian Religion, and to a certain Mirza-Zul-Karmin (that had been ok 1 the Seraglio, and, was drcumcifed) to turn Chriftian too, under the pretence t ^ born of Chriftian Parents,and Son of the Wife of a rich Armeniangtvhkh Jehan-Gwre 1 * caufed to be brought to him into the Seraglio. - * „ The fame Fathers fay, that this King, to begin in good earneft to countenanc «- Chriftian Religion, detigned to put the whole Court into the habit of the Franqui, * that after he had prepared all things for it, and even dreffed himfelf in that falmon&gt;_ called to him one of the chief Omrahs, asking his opinion of this drefs i but that ^ ^ Omrah altogether furprhed at it, having anfwered himwery ferioufly , that it ^ ^ very dangerous thing, he thought himfelf obliged to change his mind, and tuxn ^j ie f e Into raillery . • ‘Cities of Indoftan. Thcfe Fathers affirm further, that,he being upon the point of death, comm anded that they (hould be called to make him a Chriffian, but that then they were not maH ^ acquainted with it. Many fay, that this is not fo, and that he died as he had live/ without any Religion, and in the deOgn he had, as well as his Father EtW tofet himfelfup for a Prophet, and to become the Head of a particular Religion of his own compofure. However it be, there is another thing I have learned of a Mahumetan that wasSon to an Officer of Jehan-Gum ? namely, that this King beibg one dav in a debauche, called to him a certain Religious man of Florence^ whom he called Fa ther Jtecb, as being a little fiery man } and after he had commanded him to fay all he could againji the Law of Mahumet, and/fir the Law of Chrift, in the prefence of ma ny knowing Mullahs, he would have made this terrible tryal of both thofe Laws viz That a great Pit fhould be made, and a good Fire in it, and that Father with the Gofpel under his arm, andoneof thofe Mullah with the Alcoran under his, ffiould caft themfelves both together into that fire, and that he would embrace the Law of him that ffiould not burn. But that the fad countenance of the Mullah, altogether aftoniffit and the compaffion he had of the Florentine Father, who accepted the condition divert’ ed him from it. Whatever the truth ,be of this ftory, 3 tis certain, that whilft Jeban- Guire lived, thefe Fathers were refpe&amp;ed and honoured in this Court, and that they conceived great hopes of the advancement of Chriftianity in thofe parts j but that fince that time they have had no great caufe to hope much of it, except perhaps what they received by that familiarity, which our Father Buze had with Vara. But 1 ffiall fay no more of this matter of our Millions, intending to give you a particular long Letter of it another time. v , Certainly I cannot but exceedingly approve of Millions, and the good Miffionaries efpecianyour Capucms and Jefuits, and fome others of our neighborhood, becaufethey give meek inllru&amp;ioos,without that indifereet zeal and tranfport which is expreffed by fome others, and they charitably entertain the Chriftians of the Country in their Reli gion, whether they be Catholicks, or Greeks, or Armenians', Neftorians, Jacobites, or others * and forafmuch alfo as they are the refuge and comfort of poor Strangers and Travellers, and by their knowledge, fober and exemplary life, they confound the igno rance and licentious life of the Infidels: which feme others do not always pra&amp;ife * who therefore would do better to keep themfelves clofe in their Convents, and not come hi ther and give us a mafquarade of our Religion, and by doing fo, and by their ignorance jealoufie, loofnefs,and theabufe of their authority and character, become a ftumbling- block to the Law of Jefus Chrijl. But a particular thing infers no general j and notwith- ftanding thofe mifearriages, l very much applaud the Millions, and pious and learned Miffionaries, they are abfolutely neceffary : it is the honour and prerogative of Chriffi- anity, to have every where thorow the World Subftitutes of the Apoflles. But after all that L have feert, and after all the converfe and difeourfe I have fo often had with thofe obffinate Infidels, I may take leave to fay, that I almoft defpair to fee ftruck fuch great ftroaks, as the Apoftles did, who converted two or three thoufand People in one Sermon: finding by experience, and knowing very well upon other accounts, after I have travelled through all the places of the Millions in the Eaft, that all the Miffionaries together, not only in the Indies, but in all the Mahumetan Dominions,do indeed by their Inftru&amp;ions, accompanied with Charity and Alms, make fome progrefs among the Gentils, but do in ten years not make one Ghriftian of a Mahumetan. Truly thele In fidels have high thoughts of our Religion, they never fpeak of Jefits Chrifl but with great veneration^ and they never pronounce the word Ay fa, that is to fay, Jefus, without adding that of Azeret, which is Majejty. They even agree with us, that he was mira- culoufly born of a Virgin-Mother, and that he is the Kelum-Allah, and the Rouh-Allah, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God: but Tis not to be hopedrfhat they will approve the reft of our Religion, fo as to abandon theirs in which they were born, and their falfe Prophet, to embrace ours, what reafbns foever be given them. Our Ghriftians of Europe ought to Wifti, and even to employ their Power, Care and Charity, that Miffi- omries may be fent over all, fuch as may be no charge to the People of the Country, and whom want may not induce to do mean things, as well for the reafons already al- ledged, as for this caufe, that they may be ever ready to lay hold on all occafions,always to bear witnefs to the Truth, and to labour in the Vineyard when it ffiall pleafe God to give them an overture. But for the reft we ought to be difabufed, and not to fuffer our felves to be fo eafily perfwaded of fb many ftories, and not to believe the thing to O v bet Dehli and Agra capital be fo facil as fome make it. TheSed is too much libertine, and too attractive to quit if, it is a pernitious Law, which hath been introduced by Arms and Force, and tfjH gets ground by thofe means : and I hardly know any other way capable to (hake and root it out. If therefore there intervene not fome of thofe grand and extraordinary itroaksof Heaven, and God by his powerful and particular Providence interpofe not, (as we ought always to hope, according to the great appearance there have been in China] in Japan, and in the Perfon of King Jehan-Gyire ) confidering the irreverence of the Ghriftians in their Churches, fo diflbnant frotn our belief of the part icular prefence of God upon our Altars, and fo different from that deep and ailoniOiing refpecfi which thofe Infidels bear to their Mofquees, where they would not fo much as turn their heads, or fpeakthe lead: word to one another j there will alwayes be great obftacles to their Converlion. _ In Agra the Hollanders' have alfo an Houfe, \^here ordinarily they keep four or five perfons. Formerly they had a good trade therein felling Scarlet, great and fmall Looking-glaffes, plain Lace, and Gold and Silver Lace, and fome fmall Wares* and in buying Indigo, which is gathered round about Agra, but efpecially at Bianes, but two leagues diftant from it, and whither they go once a year, having an houfe there for that purpof^ * as alfo in buying thofe cloths of Jelapotir and Labpm, atfeven or eight days journey from Agra, where they alfo keep an hoiifC, and whither they fend fome Fadlors once a year. But now they fay, that there is little profit for them in that trade,whether it be that the Armenians drive the fame traffick, or that ’tis fo far from Agra to Suratte,ot that commonly fome mifchief or other befalls their Caravams, which muft pafs by Amada- vad ovcx all the Countries of the Rajas to avoid the ill ways, and the mountains that are on the fide of Gznleor and Brampour, which is the nearer way. Yet notwithllanding tbefe difcouragements, they will never (I believe ) abandon this Factory, as the Eng- lifb have done theirs in that place,if it were for nothing elfe but their Spices,which there they fell very well, and for having fome of their People near the Court taking care of their concerns: fince it cannot beotherwife, but that frequently fome trouble will befal their Factories by the tyranny of the Governors and other Officers, now from the fide of Bengala and Eatna, another time from Suratte and Amadavad. Wc will conclude this part with thofe two wonderful Maufolees, or Tombs, that give to Agra{o much advantage over Dehli, It was Jehan-Guire that caufed the firft to be ere&amp;ed to honour the memory of his Father Eckfcar * and Cbah-Jehan raifed the other in honour of 'taje^Mehale his Wife, that extraordinary and celebrated Beauty of the In dies, whom he loved fo paflionately, that’tis faid, he never enjoyed any other Woman but her whilft (he lived, and that when (he died, he was in danger to die himfelf. I (hall not (fay todifcourfe of the Monument of Eckhar, becaufe whatever beauty is there, is found in a far higher degree in that ot Taje-Mehale, which I am now going to defcribe unto you. You may therefore reprefeht to your felf, that at the going out of the City of Agra Eaft-ward, you enter into a long and broad paved ftreet, which rifeth gently, and hath on one fide an high and long wall, making the fide of a fquare Garden that is much bigger then our Ealace-Royal * and on the other fide a row ot new houfes arched, fuch as are thofe of the principal Streets of Dehli above fpoken of.^ Having gone the length of half the Wail, you (hall find on the right hand of the fide of the Houfes a great Gate well made, by which one enters into a Carvan-firab, and over againfi it on the walls fide, a {lately Gate of a great fquare Pavilion, by which you enter into the Garden between two Confervatories built up with Freeftone. This Pavilion is longer then ’tis large, built of a Stone like red Marble, but not fo hard. The Fron- tifpiece feems to me very magnificent after their way, and as high as that cf St. Louys in the Street of St. Antony. It is true, you do not there fee Columns, Archi-traves, . and Cornilhes cut out after the proportion of thofe Five Orders of Archite&amp;ure (b re- ligioufly obferved in our Palaces: it is a different and particular kind of ftru&amp;ure, but fuch an one as wants no agreeablenefs even in the unufualnefs of its contrivance, and which in my opinion, would very well deferve a place in bur Books of Architecrure. I is almod nothingbut Arches upon Arches, and Galleries over Galleries, difpofed and or dered an hundred different ways &gt; and yet all appears (lately, well enough contrive and managed. There is nothing that offends the eye * on the contrary all is plea ing, and a man cannot be weary in beholding it. The laft time I few it, I was there wit one of our French Merchants, who alfo could not behold it enough. I durfi not tel im my thoughts of it, apprehending l might have fpoiled my gull, and framed it accor -Cities of Indoftan. 9&gt; » { t0 {haf 0 f Indoftan : but he being lately come from France, I was very glad to hear him fay, he had never feenany thing fo augufi: and bold in Europe. , ? After you are fomewhat entred into the Pavilion to pafs into the Garden, you find felf under an high Vault made like | Cap, which hath Galleries above round about and below, on the right and left fid# twp Divans pr Gaufeys, made up of earth of ekht or ten foot high. Oppofite to the Gate there is.a great Arch quite open, by which you enter imp an Alley, which cuts almoft the whole Garden into two equal parts. This Alley is by way of terrafle fo large, as that lix Coaches can pafs on it abreftj paved with great fquares of hard Stone, raifed fome eight foot high above the Gardenr plots - and divided in the middle by a Channel walled up with Free-ftone, having jets of water at certain diftances. After you have gone twenty five or thirty paces upon this Alley, turning your eye to behold the Entry, you fee the other face of the Pavilion, which though it be not comparable to that which looks to the Street, yet wants notits ftatelinefs, being high and of a firudure approaching the other. And on both fides of the Pavilion, along the Wall of the Garden, yon fee a long and profound gallery by way of terrafle, fupported by many low columns near one another. And in this Gal lery 5 tis, that during the Teafon of the rains, the Poor are permitted to enter, who come there thrice a week,receiving Alms from a foundation made there by Chab-Jehan for ever. Advancing further in this Alley, you discover at a diftance before you a great Dome, where is the Sepulchrir, and below on the right and left hand you fee divers Alleyk of a Garden fet with Trees, and feveral Parterres covered with Flowers. At the end of this Alley befides the Dome before you, you difeover on the right and left two great Pavilions ’ built of the fame Stone, and confequently looking all red as the firft. Thefe are preat and fpacious fquare Edifices, made By way of Terraffe, opening by three Ar ches, and having at the bottom the wall of the Garden, fo that you march under them as if they were high and large Galleries. .‘ v . L r ., I (hall not ftay todeferibe unto you the Ornaments within thefe Pavilions, becaufem refped of their Walls, Ground-plot, and Pavement, they are not much unlike the Dome which I am going to delineate unto you, after I fhall have obferved, that be tween the end of the Alley ( which we have fpoken of ) and the Dome, there is a pret ty large fpace of a floor, which I call a Water-Parterre, becaufe that the diverfly cut and figured Stones you march upon, are there inftead of the Box-Wood of Parterres. And 5 tis from the midft of this Parterre, that you may conveniently fee a part of this Edifice where the Sepulchre is, which remains now to be confidered. . ... &gt; It i s a great and vaft IWze of white Marble, which is near the height of that of our Val de Grace in Faris, furrounded with many Turrets of the fame matter with Stairs in them. Four great Arches fupport the whole Fabrick, three of which are vifible, the fourth is clofed in by the wall of an Hall, accompanied with a Gallery, where certain Mullahs ( entertained for that end ) do continually read^the Alcoran, with a proround refped to the honour of taje-MebaVe. The mould of the Arches is inriched with Tables of white Marble, wherein are feen engraven Urge Arabian Chara cters of black Marble , which is very agreeable to behold. The interior or concave part of this Dome, and the whole wall from top to bottom is covered with white Marble i and there is noplace which is not wrought with Art, and hath not its peculiar Beauty. You fee ftore of Agat, and fuch forts of Stones, as are employed to inrich the Chappel of the great Duke of Florence much Jafper, and many other kinds of rare and pretious Stones, fet a hundred feveral ways, mixt and enchafed m the Marb e that covers the body of the Wall. The Quarries of white and black Marble, that make the floor, are likewife fet out with all imaginable beauty and ftatelihefs. . Under this Dome Isa little Chamber incloiing the Sepulchre, which I have not feen within, it not being opened but once a year, and that with great Ceremony, notfuf- fering any Chriftian to enter, for fear ( as they fay ) of Prophaning the Sandity of the place : but really by what 1 could learn, becaufe it hath nothing rich or magnificent in if. There remains nothing elfe, then to give you occafion to take notice of an Alley m the faihion of a Terraffe, twenty or twenty five ordinary paces large, and as many or more high i which is betwixt the Dome and the extremity of the Garden, whence you fee below you, at the foot of it, the River of running along, a gr^at campagne of Gardens, a part of the Town of Agra, the F ortrefs, and all thoi? fair Houfes pt the Cmrah that are built along the water. There remains no more, I fay then to caufe you to obierve this Terr#, which taketh up almpft the whole length of one ^^Dehli and Agra capital Garden, and then to defire you'to judge, whether I had reafon to fay, that the Maufol um, or Tomb of Taje-Mehale, is fomething worthy to be admired. For my pa rr \ a not yet well know, whether I am not fomewhat infedfed fiill with Indianifme i’butl mufi needs fay, that I believe it ought to be reckoned amongft the wonders of th- World, rather then thofe unfliapen maffes df the ^Egyptian Pyramids, which I was weary to fee after I had feen them twice, and in which I find nothing without but pieces of great Stones ranged in the form of fteps one upon another, and withi/i nothing but very little Art and Invention. ^ A Letter written to Mr. Chapelain, fent from in P-erJia, O&amp;ob. 4.1667. concerning the Super- fiitions, ftrange Falhions, and Dodrin of the Na tive Indies, or Gentiles ofWhence may be feen, that there are no Opinions lb ridiculous and fo extravagant , which the fpirit of Man is not capable of. SIR, I F ! fhould live whole ages^ I know not whether I could ever forget thofe two Eclipfes of the Sun, of which I faw one in France in the Year 1654. and the 0- ther in the Indies at Debit in the Year 1666. if I remember aright. The former feemed very remarkable to me upon the account of the childifli credulity of oar common people j and of that pannick terror which had fo feized the heart, that ome bought Drugs agaihfi the Eclipfe&gt; others kept themfelves clofe in the dark in ^ j* r &gt; veS5 anc ^ thefr well-clofed Chambers j others caff themfelves in great multi* u es into the Churches ; Ibofe apprehending fome malign and dangerous influence, and ^fe beheving thatthey were come to their laft day, and that the Eclipfe would !? a lS e v 1 , 6 r° un aations of Nature, and overturn it, notwithfianding any thing that the aJJendiS) Rohervalf 3 and many other famous Philofophers could fay or write againft t is perfwafion, when they demonlfrate, that this Eclipfe was of the fame nature with o many others that had preceded without any mifehief, and that it was a known acci- ent, torefeen and ordinary , which had nothing peculiar, but what fome cheating Attrological Mountebanks might have deviled. That which I faw at Debit feemed alfo very confiderable to me, by reafon of the ri- icu ous Errors and Superfiitions of the Indians. At the time when the faid Eclipfe was to appear, I went up to' the Terraffe of my houfc, which was feituate on the fide o the River Gemna y thence I faw both fides of the River, for near a league in length, covered with the Heathen Idolaters, that flood in the water up to their girdle, demure- y ooking up into the sky, to the end that they might plunge and waih themfelves at the moment when the Eclipfe fhould begin. The little Boys and Girls were dark naked i the men were almofVfo too, but that they had a kind df fcarf round about their thighs tocover their nakednefs : and the married Women, together with the young Maids that were not above fix or feven gears' old, were, covered with a fingle cloth. Perfons of condition, as the Rajas, or foveraign Princes of thofe Gentils, (who commonly are about T C f, 5 anc ^ * n t ^ ie P a y anc l fhe Serrahs or Exchangers, the Banckcrs, j ewellers, and other great Merchants, were mofi of them gone to the other fide ot the waterwith all their family, and had there put up their Tents, and faftnsd in the River certain Kanates, which are a kind of skreens, to perform their Ceremonies, and conve- n.enf y to wafh themfelves with there Wives,foas not to be feen by others. Thefe I^o- iaters no fooner faw the Eclipfe begin, but they raifed a great cry, and all at once plunged themielves wholly into the water,l know not how many times one after another &gt; hand-ing up afterwards in the water, and lifting up their eyes and hands to Heaven, muttering and praying with great devotion, and from time to time taking water with their hands' 3 which they threw up towards the Sun, bowing down their heads very low -moving and turning their arms and hands fometimes one way, fometimes another, and thus continuing their piungmg, praying and apifhnefs unto the end of this Eclipfe i at which time every one retired, cafting fome pieces of Silver aigood way off into the wa ter, and giving alms to the hrachmans or men of the Law, who failed not to be at that Ceremony- I took notice, that at their going out of the water, they all took new cloathes that were laid ready for them folded up on the fand, and that many of the de- youter fort left there their old garments for the Brachmans. And in this manner did I fee from my ierranethis great folemnityof the Eclipfe j which was celebrated after the fame manner in the River Indus and Ganges, and in all the other Rivers as alfo in the Receivers of water in the Indies, but efpegally in that of the Tanaifer, where Were met together above an hundred and fifty thoufand perfons, come together from all parts of the Indies, becaufethe water of it is on that day reputed more holy and effi cacious than on any other. 1 The great Mogol, though he be a Mahumetan, fuffers thefe Heathens to go on in thefe ola fup^rflitions, becaufe he will not, or dareth notcrofs them in the exercife of their Religion, and betides it is not performed without prefenting him, by the hands of the Bracbmanszs Commiffioners, a Lecque or an hundred thoufand Roupies, which are worth above fifty thoufand Crowns, for which he returns nothing but a few Vefts and an old Elephant. Now you (hall fee thofe folid reafons (foifooth) which they alled^e for this feah, and for the Ceremonies by them obferved in it. We have (fay they) our four Beths, that is. Books of the Law, Sacred and Divine Writings, given us by God through,the hands of Brahma. Thefe Books do teach us that a certain Veuta J which is a kind of corporeal Divinity, very malign and mif- chievous, very black and very filthy {thefe are their own expreflions in their language) feizeth on the Sun, blackens it as Twere with ink, and fo darkens it: Ibat this Sun 2 which is alfo a Ueuta, but of the beft and the moft beneficent and perfe&amp; Divinities, is at that time in very great pains and terrible anguifh, to fee himfelf thus feized on and mifufed by that black villain : That Tis a general duty to endeavour to deliver him from this miferable condition j which cannot Be effeded but by the force of prayers, walkings and alms, and that thefe anions are of a very extraordinary merit to fuch a degree, that an alms given at that time is worth an hundred given at another. Who is there, fay they, that would not give cent pour cent ? Sir, thefe ate the twoEclipfes I fpoke of which I (hall hardly ever forget, and which miniiter occalion to me to proceed to fome other extravagancies of tbefe Geritils, whence you may draw what confequerices you (hall pleafe. In the Town of Jagannat, which is feated upon the Gulf oIBengala, and where is that famous Temple of the Idol of the fame name, there is yearly celebrated a certain Feaff which lafls eight or nine days, ifl remember well. There is found an incredible number of people, as there was antiently in the Temple of Hammon, and as Tis at this day at Mecca. This number, kisfaid, amounts fometinaes to above an hundred and fifty thoufand perfons. They make a (lately Engin of wood, as I have feen of them in Jpany other places of the Indies, with I know not how many extravagant hgures,almoft fuch as we are wont to paint Monfters with two heads or bodies, half man and half bead, or gigantiek and terrible heads, Satyrs*; Apes or Devils j which Engin is put up on fourteen or lixteen wheels, fuch as the Carriages of Cannons may be,which fifty or nxty perfons more or lefs do draw, or thruft forwardsUpon the middle of if appears food confpicuouily the \&amp;o\ Jagannat, richly dreffied and adorned, which isthustranf- ported from one place to another, . / . . The drd day that they (hew this Idol with Ceremony in the Temple, the crowd is dually fo great to fee it, that there is not a year, but fome of thofe poor Pilgrims, that Come afar off, tired, and haraffed, are fuffocated there i all the people bleffingthem T! r , been fo Happy, as to die on fo holy an occafion. And when this Helliffi numpham Chariot marcheth, there are found (which is no Fable ) perfons fo fooliffi- } credulous and fuperditious as to throw themfelves with their bellies under thofe large 3 nd heavy wheels, whicji bruife them to death, having fuffered themfelves to be per vaded, that there isnoa&amp;ion fo heroick nor fo meritorious as that, and that Jagennat H at the fame time receive them as his Children, and caufe them to be born again in a Uate q( ff licity and glory. . ThsCities of Indoftan. about the dead Corps, and the Widow in her loofe hair, looki ng pale, yet with dry and fparkling Eyes, fitting and crying alfo aloud, and beating her Hands, as the re/l with a kind of Cadency, upon the Feet of her Husband. The out-cry and rioife being ended, I approach’d to this Company of people, and addreffing my felf to the Widov^ I gave her foftly to underftand, that I came from Vanecbmend-kgn i that he had appointed a monthly Penfion of two Crowns, to each of her two Sons, but on condition that flie fhould not burn her felf, to the end, that fire might take care of them, and breed them up as was fit i that elfe we knew ways enow to hinder her from burning her felf, if (he were obfiinate for it,and to make thofe repent,that fhould allure and incite her to fuch an unreafonable refolution, efpecially fince none of her Kindred was fatisfied with it, and that fhe would not be counted infamous, as thofe are that want the refolution to 5 burn themfelves after the death of their Husbands, when they have no Children. I often inculcated to her all thefe confiderations, without hearing a word of anfwer from her 5 though atlaft fhe faid, looking fiercely upon me : Well, if I am hindred to burn my {elf, v 1 am refolved to break my head againft the Wall. Then faid 1 by my felf j What Di abolical fury doth poffefs thee ? And ftfher l artfwer’d, full of indignation: Then take* thy Children, thou unhappy Creature, and ait their Throats, and burn them with thee £ for they will be llarved, I being ndW ready t6 return to '&amp;anecbmend-hgn&gt; and to annuli their Penfion. Thefe words beiifg fpoken by me, with the loudeft and moft menacing tone 1 could, made impreffion upbrfthe fpifif of this Woman, and upon that of all the af- fiftants : She prefently, without any reparty, let her Head (ink down upon her knees, and mod of die old Women and Bracbmans went away. Whereupon her Relations, that were come with me, entred and parlied with her. And I, thinking l had done enough, took Horfe, and came away to my Lodgings, fuppofing they would do the reft well enough! In fhort, about evening, when I was going to give an account to my Jgab of what I had done, I met with her Parents, who thank’d me, and faid, that the dead Corps had been burnt, and the Widow perfwaded to remain alive. Concerning the Women that have adually burn’d themfelves,! have fo often been prefent at fuch dreadful fpedfacles, that at length I could endure no more to fee it, and I retain ftillfome honour when I think on’f. Yet I (hall reprefent to you fome of them, but pretend not to exprefs to fhe life, with what courage and refolution thefe poor Women atchieved fuch a direful Tragedy j for there is nothing but the Eye it felf that can exhibit a right idea thereof. When I was pafifing from Atnadevadto Agranovct the Lands of the Rajasjhzt are in thofe parts, there dtme news to us in a Burrough, where the Caravane refted under the {hade ( ftaying for the cool of the evening,* to march on in their journey) thafa certain Woman was then upon the point of burning her felf with the Body of her Huf- band. I prefently rofe and ran to the place where it was to be done, which was a great Pit, with a Pile of wood railed in it, whereon I faw laid a dead Corps, and a Woman, which at a diftance feem’d to me pretty fair, fitting near it on the fame Pile j befides four or five Brachmans , putting the Fire to it from all fides * five Women of a middle age, and well enough dretfed, holding one another by the Hand, and dan cing about the Pit, and a great Crowd of People, Men and Women, looking on. The Pile of Wood was prefently all on fire, becaufe ftore of Oyl and Butter had been thrown upon it, and I faw at the fame time through the flames, that the Fire took hold of the Cloaths of the Woman, that were imbued with well-fented Oyls mingled with Powder of Santa! and Saffron. All this I faw , but obferved not, that the Woman was at all difturbed \ yea , it was faid, that fhe Had been heard to pronounce with great force thefe two words, Five,. ‘Two, to fignifie, according to the Opinion of thofe that hold the SoulsTranfmigration, that this was the ^tb. time fhe had burnt her felf with the fame Husband, and that there remain’d but two times for perfection 5 as if fhe had at that time this Remembrance, or fome Prophetical Spirit. But here ended not this Infernal Tragedy : I thought it was only by way of ceremony, that thefe five Women fung and danced about the Pit *, but I was altogether furprifed, when I faw, that the flame having taken hold of the cloaths of one of them, fhe caft her felf with her Head foremoft into the Pit, and that, after her, another, being overcome by the flame andfmoak did the like: And my aftonifhment redoubled afterwards, when I faw, that the remaining three took one another again by the Hand, continued their dance without any apparent fear, and that at length they precipitated themfelves, one after another into the fire, as their companions had done. It troubled me fufficiently, that I knew not what that \ meant &gt;Dehli and 'Agra capital meant *, but I learnt (hortly after, that thefe had been five Slaves, who, having feen their Miftrefs extreamly aiflided at the ficknefs of her Husband, and heard her prumife him that fhe would not furvive him,but burn her felf with him, were fo touch’d with compafiion and tendernefs towards this their Miftrefs,that they engaged themfelves in a promife to follow her in her refolution, and to burn themfelves with her. Many per- fons whom I then confulted about this cuftome of Women burning themfelves with the Bodies of their Husbands, would perfwade me, that what they did was from an excefs of affe&amp;ion they had for them: But I underfiood afterwards, that it wasonly aheffeft of Opinion, prepoffeffion and cuftome i and that the Mothers, from their youth befot- ted with this fuperftition, as of a moft vertuous and moft laudable a&amp;ion, fuch as was unavoidable to a Woman of honour,did alfo infatuate the fpirit of their Daughters from their very infancy : Although, at the bottom, it was nothing elfe but an Art of the Men the more to enflaye their Wives, thereby to make them have the more care of their health, and to prevent poifoning of them. But let us proceed to another Tragedy, which I (hall rather reprefent to you than many others, at which I have been prefect, becaufe it hath fomething uncommon in it. 5 Tis true, I was not there my felf j but .you may,4.Q -as 1, who do not (land out a- gainft crediting thefe things, becaufe,ifave feen fp iT^y-of them which feem’d incredi ble to me. This adf ion is grown fo , famous in ^he that n0 body doubts of it, and it may be, that even your felf have already lieard df + ffin Europe. Tis ofa Woman, that was engaged in fome Love-iftrigues with a young Mahume- tan her Neighbour, that was a Tailor, and could play finely upon the Tabor. This Woman in the hopes (he had of marrying this young man, poifon’d her Husband, and prefently came away to tell her Tailor, thafiit was'time to be gone together as they had projected, or elfe that (he (hould be obliged to burn her felf. The young Man fearing, left he might be entangled in a mifehievous bufine r s, flatly refufed her. The Woman, not at all furprized af it, went to her Relations, and advertifed them of thefudden death of her Husband, and openly protefted that fhe would not furvive him, but bum her felf with him. Her Kindred well fatisfied with fo generous^ refolution, and the great honour (he did to the whole Family, prefently had a Pit made, and filled with Wood, txpofing the Corps upon it, and kindling the Fire. All being prepar’d, the Woman goes to embrace and bid farewell to all her Kindred that were there about the Pit, among whom was alfo the Tailor, who had been invited to play upon the Tabor that day, with many others of that fort of Men, according to the cuftome of theCoun- try. This fury of a Woman being alfo come to this young Man, made as if (lie would bid him farewell with the reft i but in ftead of gently embracing him, (he takethhim with all her force about his Collar, pulls him to the Pit, and tumblerh him together with her felf into the Ditch, where they both were foon difpatch’t. She which I faw burn her felf, when I parted from to travel into Tcrfa in the prefence of Monfieur Chardin and Paris, and of many Englifti and Dutch, was of a middle aige and not unhandfome. To reprefent unto you the undaunted chearfulnefs, that appear’d in her countenance, the refolution with which fhe marched, wafti’dher fdf, fpoke to the people i the confidence with which (he look’d upon us,^ view’d her little Cabin,made up of very dry Millet-ftraw and fmall Wood,went into this Cabin,and fate down upon the Pile, and took her Husband’s Head into her Lap, apda Torch into her own Hand, and kindled the Cabin, whilft I know not how many Bmbmans were bufie in kindling the fire round about: To reprefent unto you, I fay, all this, as it ought, is not poifible for me j 1 can at prefent fcarce believe it my felf, though it be but a few days fince I faw it. Tis true, that I have feen fome of them, which at the fight of the Pile and r ire, appear’d to have fome apprehenfion ) and that perhaps would have gone back, but tis often too late : Thofe Demons, the Brachmans, that are there with their great Sticks, aftonifh them, and hearten them up, or even thruft them in &gt; as I have feen it done to a young Woman that retreated five or fix paces from the Pile, and to another that was much difturbed when fhe faw the Fire take hold of her Cloaths, thefe Executioners thurfting her in with their long Poles. Yet I have often feen one, that is ftill a fome Woman, and had faved her felf out of their Hands, falling into the Hands of the Gadous, that fometimes meet there in great numbers, when they know that ’tis fome fair and young Woman that is to be burnt, and that hath no great Kindred, nor muc Company with her : For the Women that are afraid of the Pile, and fly away from it,knowing tiiat they cr.nnot be received again amongftthe Gentiles, nor live with them ’ becaufe they repute them infamous, after they have committed fuch a fault, and brought fuch a difgrace upon their Religion, fuch Women, I fay, are ordinarily the prey of this kind of Men, who are alfo counted infamous in theMer, and that have nothing to loofe. A Mogolian durll not fave, nor receive any, for fear of bringing himfelf into great trouble. Some Patuguefes living in Sea-ports, where they were ftrongeft, have fometimes carried away fome of them. For my^part, I have often been fo enraged a- 1 gainft thofe Brahmins , that if I durif, I had ftrangled them. I remember, among c- thers, that at Labor, I faw a very handfome and a very young Woman burn 5 d :I be lieve (he was not above twelve years of age. This poor unhappy Creature appear’d rather dead then alive, when (lie came near the Pile i (he (hook, and wept bitterly : Mean time three or four of rhefe Executioners, the Brahmans , together with an old Hag, that held her under the Arm, thruii her on, and made her (it down upon the Wood, and lead (he (hould run away, they tied her Legs and Hands, and (o burn’d her alive. \ had enough to do to contain my (elf for indignation •, but I was forced to content my felf with detefting this horrid Religion, and to fay by my felf, what the Poet once faidof fuch another, upon the occaiion, of Ipbigenia, whom her own Father dga- memnon facrihced to Diana, for the intereif of the Grecians, amongft whom he was one of the principal Leaders. —'Lantum Religio potuit fuadere malorum ! ' ■ - r .. / ■ • Thefe are certainly very barbarous and very cruel Cuftomes, but that which the Brah mans do in fome other places of the Indies \s yet more fo : For inftead of burning thofe Women that will dye upon the death of their Husbands, they bury them in the ground alive up to the very Throat, and then two or three of them fall at ofice upon them, and wring their Neck round, and fo choakthem, covering them quickly with fome earth, and then marching over their Heads. But let us pafs to fome other Guftomes of thofe Countries. Moft of the Gentiles burn their dead * but fome there are, that do no more than with fome Straw broil them on a Rivers fide, cafiing them thereupon from the height of a deep Bank into the Water : Which I have often feenupon the River G^/zger. Some of thefe Gentiles there are, who, when they perceive a lick perion near death carry him to the fide of a River (at which barbarous adfion I have been once prefent) and then firft put his Feet into the Water, and afterwards let him Hide down as far as to his Throat, and then when they think he is now expiring, they fink him quite un der Water, and there leave him, after they have made a great clamour, and clapping with their Hinds: Andthis 5 fay they, to the end that the Soul leaving the body may be wafti’d trom all the impurities, (he may have contra&amp;ed in the Body. And this is not only areafon given by the Vulgar i fori have fpoken with the moft Learned of them, who deliver’d the fame with great ferioufnefs. But let us go on to other extravagan cies. Amongft that vaft number and great variety of Fatyres, Derviches, or R-digous Hea thens of the Indies, there is abundance of them that have Convents, in which there are Superiours, and wherein they make certain vows of Chaftity, Poverty,and Obedience, leading foodd a life, that I doubt whether you can give credit to it. Thefe are com monly called Jauguis, as if you (hould fay, Vnited to God. You (hall fee many of them fit (lark naked, or lie days and nights upon Allies, and commonly enough, under fome of thofe large trees, that are on the (ides of the 'Talabs or Ponds, or elfe in thofe Gal leries that are about their Deum or Idol-temples. Some of them have their Hair hang-* ingdown to the middle of their Legs,and that wreathed into feveral parcels, as the large Main of our Barbes, or rather as the Hair of thofe that have the iicknefs of Poland caA- led the Of thefe I have feen fome in divers places, who held one Arm, and fometimes both, lifted up perpetually above their Heads, and that had at the end of their fingers wreathed Nails, that were longer by meafure than half my little finger. Their Arms were fmall and lean as ot hedfica! perfons, becaufe they took not fufficient nou- Vifemem in that forced pofture, and they could not let them down to take any thing with them, either meat or drink, becaufe the Nerves were retired, and the Joints were filled and dried upiwherefore alfo they have young Novices, that ferve them as Holy men with very great refpedf. There is no Megera in Hell fo terrible to look on, as thofe Men arc, alll [be Gentiles of Indoftan. haked, with their black skin, long Hair,dried Arms, and in the pofture mention’d, and with crooked Nails. I have often met in the Field, efpecially upon the Lands of the wnole fqua- drons of thefe Faquires^ altogether naked, dreadful to behold. Some held their Arms lifted up in the pofture mention’d others had their terrible Hair hanging about them, orelfe they had wreathed them about their Head i Lome had a kind ot Hercules s Club in their Hand i others had dry and ftiff Tiger-skins over their Shoulders. I faw them pafs thus quite naked, without any fliame, through the midR of a great Bur rough, i admired how Men, Women, and Children could look upon them fo indifferently,with out being moved no more than if we fhould fee pafs fome Eremite through our Iheets i and how the Wqrnen brought them almes with much devotion, taking them for very holy Men, much wifer and better than others. ^ ri . , 1 have feen for a long while a very famous one in Veblf caked Sarmet, who went thus ffark naked along the fireets, and who at length would rather fufTer his Necii to berntnff than to out on any deaths, what promifes or menaces foever Aftreng-Zebe might fend to him. _ , , I have feen m^iy of them, who out of devotion went long Pilgrimages, notomy al together naked, but charged with Iron-chains, like thofe that are put about the Legs of Elephants. Others, who, out of a particular vow. Rood for (even or eight day’s up right upon their Legs, which thereupon fwell’d as big as their Thighs, without fitting or lying down, or without repofing themfelves other wife than by leaning fome hours of the night upon a Rretched Cord: Others, who flood for whole hours upon their Hands without wavering, the Head down, and the Feet upward : And fo of many others forts of pofluresfo conflrain’d, and fo difficult, that we have no Tumbler able to immitate them i and all this it feems upon the accourft of Religion, of which yet their appears not the leafl fhadow in it. - All thefe fo extraordinary things did (to tell you the truth ) exceedingly lurprize me at firfl, 1 knew not what tofay or think of it. Sometimes I look’d upon them as a re mainder, or rather as the Authors of that antient and infamous Sed of the Cynkbs, but only that I found nothing in them, but brutality and ignorance, and that they feem d to me a kind of Trees, fomewhat moving from one place to another, rather than rati onal Animals. Another time I confider’d them as Men altogether Enthufiaftical * though as 1 lately faid, I could not find any fhadow of true Piety in all they did. oome- times I thought, that this lazy, idle, and independent Life of Beggars might ave fomething attradfive in it. Sometimes I imagin’d that the vanity, which creeps in every where, and which is as often found under the patched Mantle oiViogenes, as under the comely Garment of Tim, there might lurk that Spring, which might fet a going fo many Engins i and then refledting withal upon the miferable and auflere life they led, 1 knew not what Judgment to make of them. . , , . , ’Tis true, that many fay, that they do not .exercife thefe flrange aufierities out in ie hopes they entertain of becoming Rajits in their renafcence, or ot returning again in a more happy life. But, as I have often told them to their Faces, how is i P° 1 e any Man to refolve upon Rich a miferable life from the hope of another, that is t0 e ^ longer, and hath alfo, intheupfhot, but very little happinefs in it, thoug«i cut nou.^ return a and evtn a Jeffeingtte or a Jeffomfeingue, which are tire two n 0 ‘Pj’ 1 Rajas of the Indies &gt; There mufl needs, faid I, lie fomething elft under it, which you have no mind to difeover to us, or you muR be arrant Fools. * &gt; , AmongR thofe I have been fpeaking of, there are fuch that are believed to e ru Saints, illuminated and perfedt Jauguis, entirely united to God. 1 hefe are peep e t have altogether abandon’d the World, and fcqueAer’d themfelves into fome very re^ mote, corner or Garden, like Eremites, wit hout ever coming to Town. If you carry them any meat, they receive it i if they do not, ’tis believed that they can live wit ou it, and fubfifl by the foie favour of God in perpetual fafling, prayer, and pro oui meditations : For they fink themfelves fo deep' into thefe raptures, that they lp enci hours together in being infenfible, and beholding in that time, as they give out, himfelf, like a very bright and ineffable Light, with an unexprdlible joy ana on, attended with an entire contempt and forfaking of th£ World: For thus muc^ of. them, that pretended he could enter into this rapture when he pleated,? and * ^ often in it, told me i and others that are about them, affirm the thing with om ferioufnefs, that they feem to believe in earncR, as if there were no impokere ^Gentiles of Indoftarii God alone knows whether there be any truth in it, and whether in this foiitude and fading the imagination debilitated, may not fuffer it felf to be carried away into thef- r'dTV „° r u Wh l th rn h J ey bC ‘ hat k ‘ nd of natural R^Ptures, into which Cardan faid he fell when he lifted i and this the rather, becaufe 1 fee, there is ufed fome Art in what they do, forafmuch as they prefcnbe to themfelves certain Rules by little and little to bind up their Senfes,: For they fay, for Example, that after they have faded many days uhng nothing but Bread and Water, ’tis requifite hrd to keep themfelves alone retired from all company^ direding the Eyes fkadily towards Heaven for a while then gently cadmg them down again, and then fixing them both foas to look atone’ and the fame time upon the tip of their Nofe equally, and as much on one fide as the other Twhich is troublefome enough) and remaining firm and intent in that podure until fuch a Light do come, Whatever the matter be, I know, that thefe Raptures’ and thefe ways of falling into them, make the great Mydery of the Cabala of fauauvs as ihzSoufis&amp;a alfo. I call it Mylhry, becaufe they keep it very fecret amongd them \ and if it had not been for this Tendet or Indian Do&amp;or, ts&gt; whom Vanecbmend-kan zzve a Penfion, and who durd hide nothing from him j and if alfo Vanecbme 'nd-kan had not known the Myderies of theC^/^ of the I diould not havedifeover'd fo much of it. I know befides, that as for the extremity of Poverty, of Fadings and Auderi- ties, that alfo can do much to it. We mud not think (or I am much deceived^ that any of our Religious Fryars or Eremites go in this point beyond thofe Men, nor gene rally beyond all the Afiatick Monks i witnefs the Life and Fadings of the Armenians* Copthtbes^ Greeks, Neftorians^ Jacobites^ and Maronites. We mud rather avow, that we are but Novices, when compared with thofe Religious Men: But then we mud alfo acknowledge, according to what I have experimented, in refped: of thofe of the Indies^ that they can much more eafily bear hunger than we can in our colder Climates. There are others very differing from thofe, but very drange Men like wife * they are almod perpetually travelling up and down, they deride all, take care of nothing, Men that brag of fecrets, and who, as the people fay, know no lefs than to make Gold, and fo admirably to pepare that a grain or two of it taken every morning re- doreth the body to perfect health, and fo drengthens the Stomach, that it feeds gree dily *and digeds with eafe. This is not all : When two of thefe Jauguis, that are emi nent, do meet, and you dir them up in the point and power of their knowledge or Jtmguifme, you (hall fee them do fuch tricks out of fpight to one onother, that I khow not whether Simon Magus could have out-done them. For they divine what one think- eth, make the Branch of a Tree bloflbme and bear fruit mlefs than an hour, hatch Eggs in their bofome in lefs than half a quarter of an hour, and bring forth fuch Birds as you demand, which they make fly about the Chamber, and many fuch other prodigies. 1 mean, if what is faid of them be true i for I remember, that one day my Agahfent for one of thefe famous Diviners, and when he was come, agreed with him to give him the next day 300 Rcupies, which is about 150 Crowns, if helhouldtellhim, as he faid he would, his prefent thought, which he was to write before him upon a paper : As alfo, that I my felf made a bargain with the fame,to give him 25 Roupies, if he fliould ^mne mine * but the Prophet failed us, as alfo did at another time one of thofe pretended producers of Birds, to whom I had alfo promifed 20 Roupies. I am ftill to be under flood, if it be true what is faid of them. For, as for me, 1 atrrwith all my curiofity Hone of thofe happy Men, that are prefent at, and fee thofe great feats i and if I fliould chance to fee any of fuch things as are thought ftrange, lam always confidering and Peeking, whether the thing may not be done by fome Juggle, Art, or Trick of Leger demain ; and I am fometimes even fo unhappy, or, if you will, fo fortunate, as to find out the cheat, as I did him, that made a Cup run, to difeover who it was, that had fiolen money from my Agah. Laflly, there are fome in many places, that are quite of another way than all thofe I have dilcourfed of. Their Life and their Devotion is more meek and more poliflit * they go over thefireets bare-foot and bare-headed, girt about with a S^arfe hanging down to their Knees, and having a white Sheet which pafleth under their right Arm, and comes out over their left Shoulder like a Cloak, without other Cloaths under it. They are always very clean and neat in all things, and commonly go two and two together with great modefty, holding in their Hand a fmall Earthen Trevet with two handles, very neat. They do not go goflfiping from Shop to Shop, as many of the other Fakires do. They go freely every wherfe into the Houfes of the Gentiles, where they are wel-The Gentiles of \ n &amp; Q $ Lan , come, and much made of-, they betog efkem’d a Bldling to the Houle. They are by no means to' be accufed of any thing, though it be well enough known, what in fueh vl fits among the Women paffeth. But 5 tis the cuhom,they are in poffellion of being Saints for all that, and any Houfe thinks it felf honour’d with their vifit. But it is not only there fo j many other places there be in the World, where things are not fo ftri&amp;ly look’d to. But that which I find molt ridiculous in thofe people is, That they are im pertinent enough, to compare themfelves with our Religious Men, they meet with in the Indies. I have often taken pleafure to catch them,ufing much ceremony with them, and giving them great refped i but 1 foon heard them fay to one another, This Fran- g«i.f'knows'who we are, he hath been a great while in the Indies, he knows that we are the Padrys of the Indians. A fine comparifon, faid I within my felf, made by an impertinent and idolatrous rabble of Men! But we (lay too long upon thefe Heathen-Beggers : Let us go on to their Boo\s of Law and Sciences: you may afterwards judge, whether mofi: of what I am going to fayofit may be put, as l think it maf, in the number of Extravagancies. Do not wonder, if, though I know not the Hanfcrit, the language of the Beam’d ('of which fomewhat may be faid hereafter, and which is perhaps the lame with that of the old Brahmans ) do notwithfianding tell you many things taken out of Books written in ti at Tongue. For you muft know, that my Agah Vanechmend-tyn, partly upon'my felicitation, partly out of his own curiofity, took into his ferviceoncof the famoufelf Fendets that was in all the Indies, and that formerly had had a Penfion of Vara, the Elddf Son of King Chah-jehan and that this Pendet, befides that he drew toour Houfe all the mofi Learned Pendets, was for three years confiantly of my converfation. When i was weary of explaining to my Agah thofe late difcovcrks 'ot' Harvey and Pecquet in Anatomy, and of difeourfing with him of the Philofophy of Gajfmdi and Vef-cartes, which 1 tranflated to him into Perfian ( for that was my chief employment for five or fix years ) that Pendet was our refuge, and then he was obliged to difeourfe, and to re late unto us his fiories, which he deliver’d ferioully and without ever fmiling. Tis true, that at lafi we werefo much difgufted with his tales and uncouth reafonings, that wefcarce had patience left to hear them. They fay then, that God, whom they call Achar, that is to fay, Immoveable or'im mutable, hath fent them four Books, which they call Beths, a word fignifying Science, becaufe they pretend that in thefe Books all Sciences are comprehended. The firft of thefe Books is call’d Athen-babed, the fecond Zager-bed, the third Retybed, the fourth Sama-bed. Conform to thedo&amp;rine of thefe Books,this people ought to be difiinguilh’f, as really they are, into four Tribes : The firft is of Bracbmans, Men of the Law, the fe cond of Quetterys, Men of Arms j the third, Men of Befcue or Traficty commonly called Banians j and the fourth, Men of Seydra, that is, Handy-crafts Men and Labourers. And thefe are fo diferiminated, that thofe of one Tribe cannot marry into another, that is, a Brahman cannot marry with a Woman Quettery, and fo of the reft. They all agree in one Do&amp;rine, which is that of Pythagoras concerning the Metem- pfyebojis or Tranfmigration of Souls, and in this, that they muft not kill or eat of any Animal. However there are fome of the fecond Tribe that may eat of them, provided it be neither Cows nor Peacocty-ftetth they all having a great veneration for thefe two creatures, efpecially the Cow, becaufe they fancy I know not what River lying between this Life and that to come, which they are to pafs by holding themfelves faftonaCows- tail. Poifibly their ancient Legiilators had feen thofe Shepherds of Egy/tf, crofting the Nile, by holding with their left-hand the Tail of an Oxe, and in their right-hand a Stick to guide him with i or rather they have imprinted in them this refpecl: for Cows, becaufe they draw from them Milk and Butter, which is a great part of their fubfiftance i and becaufe alfo they.are fo ferviceable for the Plough, and confequently for the Life of Man i and that the rather becaufe it is not fo in the Indies as in our Parts, for maintaining fo great a number of Cattle as we do : if but half as many of them Ihould be killed in the Indies, as there are in England or France, the Country will quickly be deftitute of them, and the Land remain Untilled. The heat is there fo violent for eight ' mopths.of the year, that all is dry, and that Oxen and Cows are often ftarved, or dye of eating trafhin the fields like Hogs. And ’tis upon the account of thefcarcity of Cat-* tie, that in the time of Jehan-Guire, the Brahmans obtain’d an Ed Eft, that no Cattle fhould be kill’d for a certain number of years, and that of late they prefented a Petition to Ameng-Zcbe, and offered him a confiderable fum, if he would make the like Pro hibition.1 be Gentiles of Indoftan. hibition They remonftrated, that for 50 or 60 years part much Land had remained Unploughed, becaufe the Oxen and Gows were become too fcarce and too dear. It may be alfo, that thefe Law-givers confidered, that Cows and Ox-flefh in the Indies isnot very favoury, nor wholefome, unlefs it be for a little time in Winter, during the cooler feafon: Or laftly, that they \^ould take the People off from mutual cruelty, (to which they were too much inclined,) by obliging them, as by a Maximeof Religion to exercife humanity to the very Beafts, and by making them believe, that killing or eat ing an Animal,it might happen that they did kill or eat one of their Grand-lires! which would be in .hprrid crime. x ' \ '7 - • V .y According to the Docffrine of thefe Beths, they are obliged to fay their Prayers at leaf! thrice every day, in the morning, at noon, and at night, with their face turned to the Eaft. They are alfo bound to waff their whole body thrice, or at leaff before they eat i and they believe, that °lis more meritorious to waff themfelves in running water then in any other. And it may be, that the Legiflators in this point alfo have had a refped to what is proper and convenient for thisGountrey, where nothing is more de fir able then waff ing and bathing. And they hnd it troublefdme enough to obferve this Law, when they are in cold Gauntries: I have feen fome of them that were like to die becaufe they would there alfo obferve their Law of waffing their Body by plunging 5 themfelves into Rivers or Ponds, when they found any near i or by throwing whole buckets of water over their heads, when they were remote from them. When I told them upon occafion, that in cold Countries it would not be poffible to obferve that Law, of theirs in Winter ( which was a lign of its being a meer human invention ) they gave* this pleafant anfwer : That they pretended not their Law was univerfal j that God had only made it for them, and it was therefore that they could not receive a Stranger into their Religion: that they thought not our Religion was therefore falfe, but that it might be it was good for us, and that God might have appointed feveral differing ways to go to Heaven &gt; but they will not hear that our Religion ffould be the general Re ligion for the whole earth, and theirs a fable and pure device. Thefe fame Books do teach them, that God having determined to create the World, would not execute it immediately, but made firit three Perfedi Beings: the firft was which fignifieth Penetrating into all things i the fccond Be/chen, thatis Exit ing in all things', and the third Mehahden, that is, great Lord. That by the means of Brahma he created the World, by the means.of Befchen he preferveth it, and by the means of Mehahden he will deftroy it. That it is Brahma, who by the command of God did publiflithe four Beths, and that therefore he is in fome of their Churches rcprefented with four Heads. Astothofe three Beings, 1 have feen fome European Miilionaries that were of opinion, that thefe Gentils had fome Idea of the Myftery of the frinity j and faid, it was expref ly contained in their Books that there are three Perfons, and one only God. For my part, 1 have made the Fendets fufficiently difcourfe upon this point j but they declare themfelves fo poorly, that I could not dearly underhand their fenfe. I have even heard fome pf them, who faid, that thefe are three Creatures very perfect, which they called Deutas. yefrwithout explaining well what they underftood by this word Veiitas i as our antient Idolaters never explained what they meant by thefe words Genius and Numina, which is f I think) the fame with Veiita among the Indians. ’Tis true, that I have fpoken with others of the moft knowing amongh: them, who faid, that thefe three Beings were indeed nothing but one and the fame God, confidered three manner of way, viz. as he is the Producer, Confervator, and Deftroyer of things j but they faid no thing ot three diftindt Perfons in one oiiely Deity. Moreover I have feen the Reverend Father TLoa, a German Jefuit aind Miffionary at dgra, who being well verfed in their Hanfcrit, maintained that their Books did not °nely import, there was one God in three Perfons, but that even the fecond Perfon of their Trinity was incarnated nine times. And that I fnay not be thought toafcribeto felf the writings of others, I ffiall relate unto you word for word, what a certain of Cbir^x hath lighted upon, which he related when the above-mentioned Fa- that Koa paffed that way to come back to Rome. The Gentils ( faith he ) do htild, that the fecond Perfon of the Trinity was incarnated nine times, and that becaufe of divers peceffities of the World, from which he hath delivered it: But the eighth Incarnation the moft notable i for they hold, that the World being inflaved under the power of Giants, it was redeemed by the fecond Perfon, incarnated and born of a Virgin at ^ &lt; midnight.Jhe Gentiles of Indoftan. midnight the Angels finging in the Ait, and the Heavens pouting down a (howet of flowers all that night. This favours much of Chriftiamty : But then there follows a Fable again, which is. That this God incarnate killed hrft of all a Giant that flew in the Air, and was fo big as to obfcure the Sun, and by his fall to make the Earth to fhake and that by his great weight he funk as deep as Hell &gt; that this God incarnate b e i n a wounded in the fide, in the hrft conflidd with this Giant, fell, but by his fall put his Enemies to flight i that after he had raifed himfeli again, and redeemed the World, he afcended into Heaven •, and that by reafon of his wound, he is commonly called the Wounded in his Side. In the tenth Incarnation, which (hall then be, when according to our fupputation Antichrift (hall come, the World (hall be delivered from the flavery of the Mahumetans : But this is oi^a vulgar Tradition, which is not found in their Books. „ , — . . , . .m V t • r They fay alfo, that theTbird Perfon of theTrimty hath manflefted himfelf to the World i concerning which they relate, That the Daughter of a certain King, being fit to be married, and asked by her Father, whom (he v/ould marry, anfwered, that (he would not be united but to a Divine Perfon j and that at the fame time, the Third Per fon of the Trinity appeared^ the King in the form of Fii£ i that that King forthwith gave notice of it to his Daughter, who prefently confented to the Marriage i That this Perfon of the Trinity,though altogether in a flry appearance,was called before the King’s Council, and feeing that the Counfellors oppofed this Marriage, took hold of their Beards and burned them, together with the whole Pvoyal Palace, and then married the Daughter. Ridiculous! They add, that the flrftlncarnation of the fecond Perfon, was in the nature of a Liony the fecond, in thatof a » thethird, in that of a Torftwye s thefourth, inthatofa Serpent the fifih in that of a Brahma She-Dwarfr onely a foot and a half high i the hxth, in that of a Monller, a Man-Lion &gt; the feventh, in that of a Dragon j the eighth, as hath bepmf^id already j the ninth, in an Ape j the tenth, in that ofa great Cavalier. Concerning this I (hall acquaint you, that I doubt not but that the Reverend Father lioa, hath takeh all he faith of this matter out of the Books of ^ the Gentiles, and that is the main ground of their Mythology. I had written many things of it at large in my Papers, and had alfo taken the Figures of their Gods or idols, which I had feen in their Temples, having alfo got of them the Characters of their Language Hanjcrit &gt; but bod ing at my return all thofe things, or at lead the belt part of it Printed in the China lllufl- rata of Father ifirckr, who had obtained it at TCome from the fame Father Loa j I (hall content my felf to have named the Book to you. ’Tis true, that the word Incarnation, which the Reverend Father ufeth, was new to me, having never feen itfo exprefly ufed i l had only heard fome Tendets thus explaining the thing, viz. That God had formerly appeared in thofe Figures when he did all thofe wonders they relate. Others explained it to me after this manner, to wit. That it was the Soul of certain Great Men, fuch as we might call Hero’s, that hadpafled into thefe Bodies, and that thefe were thu's become Dent as, or to fpeak in the phrafe of our old Idolaters, fome powerfu and confiderable Divinities, Numens, Genios , Demons, Spirits j for I fee not that this word Deiita can (ignifle any other thing : But this fecond Explication of tke Pendets, cometh in effed to the tirfl, for as much as moftofthem believe, that our Souls are Portions of God. _ , r Others there were that gave me a much fublimer Explication, faying, That all thole Incarnations or Apparitions, which their Books fpeak of are not to be underflood a ^ or ing to the Letter,but Myftically,forafmuch as thereby are explained the feveral Attributes of God. Some there were, and thofe of the mofl: learnedj acknowledging to me can didly, that there was nothing more fabulous then thofe Incarnations, and that they were only the Inventions of Legiflators, to retain People in fome Religion : And though this werefo, if there were nothing elfe but this, (’which is common to them all) t a our Souls were Portions of the Deity, it were to be exploded in found Phylo op without making any Myfteries in Religion of it, feeing that in refped of our Souls we fhouldbeGo^, and that in effeCt it fhould be our felves that had impofed upon us a Pveligious Worfliip, Metempfychofes, Paradice and Hell, which would be ridiculous. 1 (hall here add a few words, to declare that I am not lefs obliged to Monfleur w ry Lor, and to Monfieur Abraham Roger, then to the Reverend Fathers Kircher am I had compil’d an hundred things relating to the Gentiles, which I found in the Boo so^ thofe Gentlemen, and which would have been a great trouble to me to range t lC1 ^'/ he Gentiles of ■ Ittdoftan. they have done. I (hall therefore content my felf to fay fomething in General to you of their Studies and Sciences^ not indeed in that good order which poffibly you might exped, but juft as I have learnt, it, and as ’tis probably found in their Books i I mean by fragments, and without coherence. The Town of Benares , which is feared upon the Ganges in a very fine and rich Coun try and place, is the General School, and as ft were the Athens of the Gentry of the Indies i where the Bradmans and the Religious fthofe that addidhhemfelves to ftudy) come together. They have no Colledges nor Claffes ordered as with us, me thinks ftis more after the way of the School of the Antients s the Mafters being difperfed over the Town in their Houfes, and efpedally in the Gardens of the Suburbs, where the great Merchants do fufter them, Of thefe Mafters fome have four Difciples i o- thers fix or feven ; and the moft famous, twelve or fifteen at moft, who fpend tenor adouien years with them. All this ftudy goeth on very cooly, becaufe moft In^ dians are of a ftow and lazy humour, to which the heat and diet of the Country contri butes much i and becaufe they are not animated to induftry as we, by that great emu- f lation, and by the great hopes we have of coming thereby to great preferment. They ftudy leafurely, and without much tormenting themfelves i eating their Kicheryot mix ture of Legums, which the rich Merchants caufe to be dreffed for them. Their firft ftudy is of the Han ferity which is a Language altogether different from the common Indian, and not, kno wn but by the Pendets. And this is that Tongue, of which Father Kircher hath pubhftit the Alphabet received from Father Koa. It is called Hanfcrit, that is, a pure Language i and becaufe they believe this is to be the Tongue, in which God, by the means of Brahma, gave them the four Betbs^ which they efteem Sacred Books/they call it an Holy and Divine Language. They pretend alfo, that it is as antient as Brahma, whofe Age they do not reckon but by Lecqttes, or hundred thoufands of years, but i would gladly have a warrant for fuch an extraordinary Antiquity* However, it cannot be denied that ftis very old, in regard that the Books of their Re ligion, which certainly is very antient, are written in this Tongue, and befides that, it hath it’s Authors in Philofophy and Phyfick in Verfes,and fome other Poems, and ma ny other Books , of which I have feen a great Hall quite full in Benares. After they have learned the (which is very difficult to them, becaufe they have no Grammar worth any thing) they commonly apply themfelves to read the Fa rm, which is as it were the interpretation and fum of the Beths, which are very large, at leaft if thofe be they which were ftiewed me at Benares : and befides they are fo very rare, that my Agab could never find them to be fold, what induftry foever he ufed in it. And they keep them very fecret, for fear leaft the Mahumetans ftiould lay their hands ort them and burn them, as they have already done feveral times. After the fome fall upon Philofophy, wherein certainly they go not far. I nave already intimated, that they are of a flow and lazy temper, and are not excited by the hopes to obtain feme good place by their ftudy. Among (heir Philofophers there have principally been fix very famous, who make fo many dirferentSedfs &gt; which caufeth alio a difference and an emulation among the 1 Pendets or Dodtors: For they know, that fuch an one is of rhisSed, another of ano ther, and every one of them pretends his Dodrine to be better than that of others, and niore conform to the Beths. There is indeed another, a feventh Sed, which is called Pme whence do proceed twelve other different Seds j but this is notfocommonas the odiers , the Votaries of it being hated and defpifed as a company of irreligious and atheiftkal people, nor do they live like the reft. All thefe Books fpeak of the firfi principles of things, but very differently. Some fa}', that all iscompofed of little Bodies that are indivifible, not by reafon of their folidity, hardnefs, and rcfiftance&gt; but fmalnefs} adding divers things which approach to the opinions of Democritm and Epicurus, but with fo much confufion that one knows not where to [alien, all feeming like a rope of fand : which yet may be as much or more the fault of the Pendets, which feem to me very ignorant, then of the Authors. Others fry, that all is made up of matter and form &gt; but not one of them explains tmfeif clearly about the matter, and lefs about the/mw. Yetfo much I have found, t at they underftand them not at alias they arc wont to be explained in our Schools, by oucingrhe form out of the power of the Matter: For they always alledge Exam ples of things Artifickil, and among them that of a Veffel of foft Clay, which a Pot- ter and fliapes divers ways* e , ft' Others—————— ——.——-&lt;&gt; ' io8 The Gentile o/’Indoftan. Others hold, that ail is compofed of four Element! and a nothing ■, but they do not at all explain themfelves concerning Mixtion and Tranfmutation. And as tor their nothing, which comes near to our privation, they admit I know not how many forts of them, which (I believe ) they underhand not at all, nor are able to make out toothers. There are alfo fome, that maintain light and dartyiefs to be the firh Principles, and fayathoufand impertinent and confufed things upon it, making long-winded difcour- fes, which favour nothing at all of Philofophy, but are like the talk of the vulgar. Others there are that admit privation for the Principle, or rather privations, 'which they diftinguifh from nothing, and of which they make long enumerations, io ufelefs and little philofophical, that I can fcarce imagine them to be in their Books, or that their Authors could have entertained themfelves with fuch uncouth things. Laftly, fome of them do pretend that all is compofed of accident! &gt; of which alfo 7 they make odd, long, and tedious enumerations,, and fuch as favour only force Petti fogger, that can amufe the common People. *' Touching thefe Principles in general, they all agree that they are i ourpro- du&amp;ion out of nothing not having come (it feems ; into their thoughts, as it hath nei ther to many others of the antient Philofophers : Yet they fay, that there is one of them that hath touched fomething of it. As to PhyficJ^, they have many little Books that are rather colle6Hons of remts then any thing elfe i the molt antient and chief wherefore is in Verfe. I (hall here tell you, that their prattice is fufficiently different from ours, and that they ground therofelves upon thefe Principles: That one who is fick of a Feaver, needs no great nouriihment i That the main Remedy of fickneffes, is Abltinence: That nothing is worfe for a fick Bo dy then Flefh-broth, nor which corrupts fooner in the Stomach of a feverilh Patient: That no Blood is to be let but in great and evident neceflity, as when you apprehend fome tranilation into the Brain, or finde fome confiderable part, as the Chelf, Liver, Kidneys, enflamed. Whether this Pra&amp;dce be better then ours, I leave to Phyfitians to decide •, but 1 fee that ’tis fuccefsful among them. The fame pradf ice is not peculiar to the Phylitians of theGentils, but the Mogolian and Mahumetan Dodfors, that toWow Avicen and Aver- roes, do alfo very ftri&amp;ly obferve it, efpecially as to Meat-broths. 5 Tis true that the Mogols are fome what more prodigal of their Blood then the Gentils, for in thofe ficknef fes wherein they fear thofe accidents lately fpecified, they commonly blood once or twice : but thefe are none of thofe petty venefedtions of the new invention of Goa and Paris, but they are of thofe plentiful ones ufed by fhe Antknts, of 18. or 20. ounces of Blood, which often come to a fwounding, and frequently choak the Difeafe in the ve ry beginning, as Galen faith, and as I have often experimented. Concerning Anatomy, I may fafely fay, that the Gentils underhand nothing at all of it, and they can fpeak nothing as to that fubjcdl but what is impertinent. Nor is it a wonder they are fo ignorant in it, fince they never open any Body of Man or Beall: they do fo much abhor it, that when I opened fome living Kids and Sheep before my Agah, to make him underhand the Circulation of the Blood, and to Ihew him the Pecquetian Veffels,through which the Chyle at lah comes into one of the ventricles of the Heart, they trembled for fear and ran away. Yet notwithllanding they affirm, that there are hve thoufand Veins in Man, neither more nor lefs, as if they had well count ed them all. Touching Aftronomy, they have their Tables, according to which they forefee the Eclipfes i-and though they do it not with that exa&amp;nefs as our European Allronomers, yet they come pretty near. Mean time they difcourfe of the Eclipfe oftheMooffi as they do upon that of the Sun, believing that it is the Rah, that black Villain, and mif- chievous Vekta, whoat that time feizeth on the Moon and blackens fkr. They hold alfo, that the Moon is an hundred thoufand kpjfes, that is, above fifty thoufand Leagues above the Sun : that Ihe is lucid of her felf i and that 5 tis fhe, from whom we receive a certain Vital Water, which gathereth and difpofeth it felf in the Brain, defeending thence as from a fource into all the members for their fun&amp;ions. Befides this, they are of opinion, that the Sun and Moon, and generally all Stars are Dentass that kis night when the Sun is behind the Someire, that imaginary Mountain, which they place in the mid ft df the Earth, and make I know not how many thoufand Leagues high, and to Which they give the drape of an inverted Sugar-loaf &gt; fo that tis not day with them, but whe.n the Sun gets out from behinde this Mountain.The Gentiles of Indoftan. In Geography they have fped no better. They believe the Earth to be flat and tri angular, and that it hath fevenftories, all differing in beauty, perfediion, and inhabit tants j each of which is encotapaffed, they fay, by its Sea i that of thefe Seas one is of Milk, another of Sugar, the third of Butter, the fourth of Wine, and fo forth: fothat after one Earth there comes a Sea,and after, Sea an Earth &gt; and fo on unto feven,begin- ning from Someirs, which is in the midft of thefe fiories: that the firft ftory, which is at the foot of Someire, hath Vent its (ox its inhabitants, which are very perfedf j that the fecond Contains like wife Veutaf, but lefs perfect * andfo the red, ftill leffening the perfedfion unto the feventh, which they fay is ours, that is, cf men far lefs perfect then all the Veiitas * and lalfly, that this whole Mafs is fuflained upon the heads of divers Elephants, which when they ftir, caufe an Earthquake. All thefe ftrange impertinences,, which I have had the patience to relate, have often made me think, that if they be thofe famous Sciences of the antient of the Indies, very many have been deceived in the great opinion they entertained of them. For my part, I can hardly believe it, but that I find the Religion of the Indians to be from immemorial times ‘ 5 that 3 tis written in the Language Hanfcrit^ which cannot be but very antient, lince its beginning is unknown, and 3 tis a Language, not imderfiood but by the Learned j that all their Books are only written in that Tongue : All which are as many marks of a very great Antiquity. Let us now add a few words about the worjhip of their Idols. ‘ , When I defeended along the River Ganges, and paffed through Banares, that famous School of all the Indian Gentility, I went to fee the chief of the Pendets^ who - hath there his ordinary refidence. ThisisaF^re, or Religious Monk, fo renowned for his knowledge, that Chah-Jehan, partly for his Science, partly to pleafe the gave him a Penfion of 2000 Roupies, that is, about 1000 Crowns. This was a big and proper Man, goodly to look on j who for all his Cloaths had nothing but a white filken Scarified about his wafte,and hanging down to his mid-leg,with another red Scarf about his fhoulders like a little Cloak. I had often feen him at Dehli in this pofture before the King, in the Affembly of z\\ the Omrahs, and marching upon the Streets, fometimes on foot, fometimes in a Palefyy. I had alfo frequently feen and many times converfed with him, when for a whole year together he conftantly came to our conference before my Agah, whom he courted, that he might procure him again that Penfion which Aureng-Zebe (being come to the Crown) had taken from him, that he might appear a great Mufulman. In the vifit I made him at Banares, he was exceedingly courteous to me, and even gave me a Collation in the Library of his Uoi- verfity, attended with fix of the molf famous Pendets of the Town. When I found myfdf in fo good Company, I prayed them all to tell me their fenfe about the Adora- tionof their Idols i intimating to them, that I was leaving the Indies, extreamly fcandalized upon that fcore ; and reproaching them, that that worfhip was a thing againlf a ]i reafon.and altogether unworthy fuch Scholars and Fhilofophers as they were 0 Whereupon I received this Anfwer. /&gt;/ We have indeed ( fa id they) in our Deuras or Temples, ft ore of divers Statues, as thofe of Bra ham, Mehaden, Genich and Gavani, who are fame of the chief and the moft perfect Lkiitas : and we have alfo many others of lefs perfection, to whom we pay great honour, pro frating our f elves before them, and prefenting them Flowers, Rice, fcented Oyls, Saffron and fttcb other things with much Ceremony, but we do not believe thefe Statties to be Brahma or Bechen, See. themfeIves, but only their Images and Reprefentations, and we do not give them that honour, but upon the account of what they reprefent. They are in our Temples, becaufe: tis necejfary for praying well, to have fometbing before our eyes that may fix the mind &gt; and when we pray, it is not the Statue we pray to, but he that is reprefented by it. For the ref,we acknowledge that ’tis God that is abfilute, and the only Omnipotent Lord and Mafter. This is, without adding, or fubtradfing any thing, the refolution they gave me. Butj to tell you true, this feemed a little too much accommodated to our Chriflianity, in re- fpeef of what I had learned of it from feveral other Pendets. &gt; After this, I put them upon their Chronology, where they pretended to (hew me far higher Antiquities then all ours. They will not fay, that the World is eternal i but they make it fo old, that I almoft know not which is beft. Its determined duration, fay they, is of four Dgugue. This Dgugue is* a certain determined number of years, as amongft us we have a feculum (an Atge) with this difference, that an Age of ours con tains only an hundred Tears, but their Vgugue is made up of an hundred Lecques, that . CL 1no A Voyage to Kachemire, is 5 -an hundred times hundred thoufand years. I do not precifely remember the number total o£ the years of each Vgugtte *, but this 1 know very well, that the firft, called Sate. Dgugue, is of twenty five Lecques of years : that the fecond, which they call Trita^ is of alx)ve twelve Lecques : the third, called Vuaper, of eight Lecques and fey four thou fand years, if I remember well: and the fourth, cal[ed Kak-Vgugue, is of I know not how many Lecques. The three firft, fay they, and much of the fourth, are elapfed *, fo that the World (hall not laft fo long as it hath done, becaufe it is to perilh at the end of the fourth, all things being then to return to their firft Principles. I made them com pute again and again, to have their age of the World aright i but finding that that perplexed them, and that they agreed not among themfelves about the number of the Lecques, I contented my felf to fee that they make the World exceeding old. But be ing prefled a little to make out this Antiquity, they pay you with nothing but little fiories, and at length come to this, that they find it fo in their Beths, or the Books of their Law, given them by the hands of Brahma. After this I urged them concerning the nature of the Deiitas, of which I defired to be particularly intruded i but 1 received nothing but what was very confufed. They fatd, that there were three forts of them. Good, Evil, and Indifferent ones, that were neither good nor bad h that fome thought, they were made of Fire, others of Light &gt; others that they wextBiapek^ of which word I could not get a clear explication) only they faid, that God was Biapek^ and our Soul was Biapel^, and what is Biapehjs incorruptible, and depends neither from Time nor Place : 'that others would have them to be nothing dfe but Portions of the Deity v and lafily, that fome there were, that made them cer tain kinds of Divinities fevered and difpenfed over the World. I remember, that I alfo put them upon the nature of the Lengue-cherire, whichifome of their Authors do admit: But I could obtain nothing elfe of it but what I had long fince underfiood from our Tendet, which was, That the feeds of Plants and Animals are not formed anew, but were contrived ,in the firft produdfion of the World, and difpenfed abroad every where and mixed in all things i and that they are (not only potentially but a&amp;ually) the very and entire Plants and Animals, though fo fmall, that their parts cannot be diftinguifht, but when being put into a convenient womb, and there nouriftied, they extend themfelvesand increafe : So that the feeds of an Ap ple and Pear-Tree are a Lctigue-cherire, that is, a little entire and perfedf Apple and Pear-Tree, having all itseffential parts: And fo the feeds of an Horfe, an Elephant, and a Man , &amp;c. are a hengue-cberire \ a little Horfe, a little Elephant, a little Man, in which there w 7 ants nothing but the Soul and Nourifhmentto make them appear what they are. For a conclufion, I (hall difeover to you the my fiery of a great Cabala, which in thefe laft years hath made great noife in Indojlan, becaufe certain Fendets, or Heatheniui Do&amp;ors, had pofTeffed with it the minds of Vara and SuItan.Sujah, the two firft Sons of Chah-Jchan. You cannot but know the Do&amp;rineof many of the Antient Philofophers, touching that gze&amp;tSoul of the World,which they will have our Soulsand thofe of Animalsto be por tions of. If we did well penetrate into Plato and Arijiotle,we might perhaps find that they were of this fentiment. It is in a manner the general Dodtrine of the Heathen Fen- dets of the Indies, and ’tis the fame which ftill maketh the Cabala of the Soufys, and or the greateft part of the learned Men in Perfia, and which is found explained in Per- fun Verfes, fo fublime and emphatical in their Goultchen-raz or Parterre of Myftenes • which is alfo the very fame of Dr. Find’s, whom our great Gaffendus hath fo learne y refuted *, and that wherein moft Chymifts lofc themfelves. But thefe Indian Gabali s or fendets I fpeak of, drive this impertinence farther than all thofe Philofophers, an pretend, that God, or that SoveraignBeing, which they call (immutable,) hat produced or drawn out of his own fubftance, not only but alfo whatever is material and corporeal in the Univerfe i and that this production was not meer ^-r 1 ?? i £ by way o£ an efficient caufe, but by a way refembling a Spider thatproducetha We » which it draws forth out of its own body, and takes in again when it will* Creation therefore, fay thefe Dodors, is nothing dfe but anextradionand extenfion, w JC^ God maketh of his own Subftance, of thofe webbs he draws from his own bowels &gt; as Ve[lrv8ion is nothing elfe but a reprifal, or taking back again this Divine Subftance, an thefe Divine webbs into himfelf: So that the laft day of the World, which they MaperU or Praha, when they believe that all ftiall be deftroyed, (hall be nothing e ^1 be Gentiles' of Indoftan. ] but a general reprifal of all thofe webbs which God had drawn forth out of himfelf. There is therefore nothing C/a they go on) that is real or dfadfive in all we think, we fee, hear, fmell, tafte or touch : all this World is nothing but a kind of Dream and a meer lilufion, in regard that all this multiplicity and diverfity of things that appea&amp;tous, is nothing but one and the fame thing, which is God himfelf i as all thofe ieveral Num- bersof io 3 20 3 i 00 5 iooo, axe indeed nothing but one and the fame unity many times repeated. But if you demand any reafon for this phantafie, or any explication of the manner, how this iflfuing from and reprifal into the fubftance of God, this ex- ' tenlion, and this variety of things isrpade i or howit can be, that God, being not cor poreal but Biapek^and incorruptible, fas they acknowledge) fhould yet be divifible into fomany portions of Bodies and Souls i they never make any other return, but offpme pretty comparifons, as, That God is like an immenfe Ocean^ in which if many Vials full of Water (bould be floating, they would, wherever they (hould move, be found al ways in the fame Ocean, in the fame Water i and that coming to break, their Water would at the fame time be united with their whole, and with that great Ocean of which they were portions. Or they will tell you, that it is with God as with Lights which is the fame through the whole Univerfe, and which yet appears an hundreddif- ferent ways, according to the diverlity of the Obje&amp;s it falls upon, or according to the feveral colours and fliapes of Glafles through which it Ihineth. They will pay you, 1 fay, only with fuchkindof flmilitudes, that bear no proportion at all with God, and are good for nothing, but to caft dufl into the eyes of the ignorant people : And you muft not exped any folid Anfwer from.them, if you (hould tell them, that thofe Vials would indeed be in a like Water, but notin the fame'-, and that it is indeed a /% light o- verallthe World, but not the fame: or if you (houldmake any other obje&amp;ions a- gainflthem, they return always to the fame coroparifons, pretty expreffions, or as the Sonfys, to the fine Verfesof thdt Goultchen-raz* Now Sir, what think you ?

CONTAINING x 1 ' * ' ■' ‘ , Tfc Occafton anti Citufe of this Voyage of Aureng-Zebe ; together with an account of the fate and pofture of his Army, and I he Equipage and ordi nary Provifons of the chief of his Cavalry j and Jo me curious particulars ohfervable in the Voyages of the Indies. sir, ' S ince that began tofiwd himfelf in better health, it hath been conlhntly reported, that he would make a Voyage to Labor, and go from thence to Kachemm y to change the Air, and to be out of the way of the approaching Summer heats, for fear of a relapfe : That the more intelligent fort of men would hardly be per i Waded, that as long as he kept his Father Chab-jean prifoner in the fort of Etgfa, he would think it fafe to be at fuch a diffance. Yet notwithftanding we have found, that Reafonoi State hath given place to that of Health, or rather to the Intrigues of Raucbenara-Legam, who was wild to breath a more free Air than that of the Seraglio, and to nave her turn in (hewing her felf to a gallant and magnificent Army, as hey Siitfer. had formerly done during the Reign of Cbab-jean. _ He departed then the &lt;5^ of December, about three a clock in the afternoon* a d«\ and hour that muft needs be fortunate for a great Voyage, if we may give cfedit to the Gentlemen Alirologers, who have fo decreed if. And he arrived at Chacb-lirnar, his Houfe of Pleafure, diftant about two Leagues from hence * where he fpent hx whole dayes, thereby to give to all fufficient time to make neceffary preparations for a Voyage, that would take up a year and an half. We have this day news, that he is gone to encamp on the way of Labor, and that when he hath flayM there two dayes, he intends to continue his march without any further expectation. He hath with him not only the Thirty five thoufand Horfc, or thereabout, and 10000 Foot, but alfo both his Artilleries, the great or heavy, and the fmall or lighter, which is call’d,7ha Artillery of the Stirrup, hzczute it is infeparable from the perfon of the King, whereas the Heavy fometimesleaveth him to keep the high and well beaten Roads. ^ The Great Artillery is made up of feventy pieces of Cannon, moft of them caff &gt;ot which feme are fo ponderous, that they need twenty yoke of Oxen to draw them &gt; and fome of them require Elephants to help all thofe Oxen, by thruftmg and drawing the wheels of the Wagons with their Trunks and Heads when they kick in any deep way, or are to pals fame keep mountain. That of the Stirrup is compofed of hky or1 The Paradije of Indoftan. £xty fmall Field-pieces, all of Brafs, each carried upon a little pritty and painted Chariot (as hath been already faid in another place J beautified with many little red Streamers, and drawn by two very handfom Horfes, driven by the Gunner himfelf, to gether with a third Horfe, which the Gunners Affihant leads for a relief. All thefe Chariots go alwaies a great pace, that they may be foon enough in order before the Tent of the King, and difcharge all at once at the time of his entry, to give the Army notice. All thefe great preparations give us caufe to apprehend, that in head of going to Kachemire, we be not led to befiege that Important City of Kandahar, which is the Frontier to Perfia i Indoftan and Vsbeck^, and the Capital of an excellent Country,yield ing a very great Revenue, and which for this very reafon hath been ever the bone of contention between the Per fans and Indians, Whatever it be, there is now a neediity to difpatch at V?hlf any bufinefs whatfoever notwithftanding i and I fhould find my felfmuch caft behind the Army, if 1 fhould tarry any longer :Befides I know, that my Navabj or Jgah Damch-mend-kan ft ays for me abroad with impatience: He can no more be without philofophiling in the afternoon upon the Books of GaJJendi and Def-Cartcs, upon the Globe and the Sphere, oi upon Anatomy, than he can be without beftowing the whole morning upon the weighty matters of the Kingdom, in the quality of Secre tary of State for forrain Affairs,and, of Great Mafter of the Cavalry. 1 (hall depart this night, after I have given the laft order for all my buftnefles, and provided all neceffaries for my Voyage, as all the principal perfons of the Cavalry do i that is, two good Tartarian Horfes, whereto I am obliged by reafon of the one hundred and fifty Crowns of pay, which I have by the month &gt; a Camel of Perfia, and a Groom i a Cook, and another Servant, which muft be had ordinarily to march in thefe Countries before the Horfe, and to carry a Flagon with water in his hand. I alfo have provided the ordi nary lltenlils, fuch as are a Tent of a middle fizc, and a proportionate piece of foot- Tapiftry i and a little Bed with girdles, made up with four ftrong and light Canes, and a Pillow for'the head:, two Coverlets, whereof one folded up fourfold ferveth for a Matraffe} around Table-cloth of Leather to eat uponj fome Napkins of dyed Cloth, and three fmall Sacks for Plate, which are put up in a greater Sack, and this fack into a very great and ftrong Sack made of Girdles, in which are put all the provifions, to gether with the Linnen of the Mafter and Servants. 1 have alfo made provifion of ex cellent Rice for five or fix dayes, for fear I fhould riot alwayes find fo good j of fome fweet Bsfcuit, with Sugar and Anis&gt; of a linnen fleeve with its little iron-hook, to let, by the means thereof, run out and to keep curdled milk and of ftore of Limons with Sugar, to make Limonade i&gt; fuch Milk and Limonade being the two great and foveraign refiefhments of the Indies : All which, as I faid, is put into the laft named Sack, which is fo large and heavy, that three or four men have pains enough to lift it up: though two men do nrft fold and turn one fide upon the other when it is full, and though the Camel be made to ftoop very nigh it, and there need no more than to turn one of the tides of that Sack upon the Camel. All this equipage and provifion is abfo- lutely neceftary in fuch Voyages as thefe. We muft not look for fuch good lodging and accommodations as we have in^our Country. We muft refolve to encamp and live after the Arabian anil Tartarian mode, without expecting any other Inns than Tents* Nor muft we think to plunder the Country-man j all the Lands of tne Kingdom being in propriety to the King • We are well to confider, that we muft be fober and prudent, and that to ruine the Countryman, were to ruine the Demefne of the King. That which much comforts me in this march, is, that we go North-ward, and depart in the beginning of the Winter after the rains &gt; which is the right feafon for travelling in the Indies, be caufe it raineth not, and we are not fo much incommoded by heat and dull. Betides that, I rind my felf out o‘f danger of eating the bread of orof the Mar ket, which ordinarily is ill baked, full of (and and duft v nor obliged to drink of thofe naughty waters rvhich being all turbid , and full ot naftinefs oi so many people and beads that fetch thence, and enter into them, do cauie fuch fevers, which are very hard to cure, and which breed alfocejrtain very dangerous worms in the legs. They at tuft caufe a ^reat inilamation, accompanied with a fever, and ordinarily come forth a little after the Voyage..although there have been fome, that, have ftay d a whole year and more before they appear'd. They are commonly of the bignefs and length of a fmall Vnl-ftring, fo that one would fanner take them for fome nerve than for a worm, and they muft be drawn out little by little, trom day to day, gently winding tnun y ' about114 A Voyage to Kachemire, about a little twig of the bignefs of a needle, for fear of breaking them. This, I fay comforteth me not a little, that 1 find my felf exempt from thefe inconveniencies i my having vouchfafed me a very particular favour &gt; which is, that he hath appoint ed to give me every day a new loaf of his houfe, and a Sonray of the water of Ganges with which he hath laden feveral Camels of his train, as the whole Court doth. Souray is that Tin-flagon full of water, which the Servant, that marcheth on foot before the Gentleman on horfeback, carriethin his hand, wrap’t up in a fleeveof red cloth. Or dinarily it holdeth but one pinte but I had fome of them exprefly made, that hold two. We (hall fee, whether this cunning will fucceed. The water cooleth very well in this Flagon, provided that care be hadalwayesto keep the fleeve moifl, and that the Servant that holds it in his hand, do march and flir the air, or elfe that it beheld towards the wind i as is commonly done upon three pretty little flicks, croffingone another, that they may not touch the earth iFor the moiflnefs of the linnen, the agi tation of the air, or the wind, are abfolutely neceflary to keep the water frefhi as if this moiflnefs, or rather the water imbibed by the fleeve did keep out the little igneous bodies or fpirits that are in the air, at the fame time when it giveth entrance to the nitrous or other parts, which hinder the motion in the water, and caufe coolnefsj in the fame manner as Glafs keeps out Water, and giveth palfage to the Light, by reafon of the particular texture and difpofition of the parts of the Gkfs, and the diverlity there muft be between the particles of Light and thofe of Water. We do not ufe this Timflagon for keeping our water cool but imthe field: When we are at home, we have Jars of a certain porous Earth, in which it is much better cooled, provided it be expos’d to the wind, and moiftenM with a Linnen-cloth, as the Flagon i or elfe, ufe is made of Salt-peter, as all perfons of quality do, whether in Towns, or in the Army,- They put water, or any other liquor, to be cooled, in a round and long neckedTin- flagon, fuch as are the Englifli Bottles, and for the (pace of half a quarter of an hour this Flagon is flirr’d in water, into which hath been cafi three or four handfuls of Salt-peter j this maketh the water very cold, neither is it unwholfome, as I did ap prehend j but only that fometimes it caufeth gripings at firfl when one is not acculbm- ed to it. But to what purpofe, to play fo much the Philofopher, when we fhould think to de part, and to endure the Sun, which at all feafons is incommodious in the Indies, and tofwallow the dufl, which is never wanting in the Army, to put up, to load, and to unload every day our Baggage, to help the Servants to faften flicks, to draw Cords, to put up Tents, and to take them down again, to march in the day, and in the night, to devour cold and heat, and in a word, to turn Arabians for a year and an half, during which/ime we are to be in the Field. Adieu) I fliall not fail to acquit my felf of my promife, and from time to time to inform you of our Adventures i and befides, fince the Army for this rime will make but (mail Journeys in its march, and pafs on with all that pomp and magnificence, which the Kings of Indoftan do affedf, I {hall endeavour to obferve the mofl confiderable things, that I may impart them to you, as foon as we fball arrive at Labor.The Paradije of Indoftan. n THE SECOND LETTER; CONTAINING The Number and Magnificence, the Order and the Difpofition of the Tents o the Great Mogol in the Field: The Number of Elephant sfiamels,Mules and Porters, necejfary to carry them : The Difpofition of the Bazars or Royal Markets : That of the particular Quarters of the Omrahs, or Lords and of the reft of the Army : The extent of the whole Army, when encamped: The confufion there met with ; and how it may be avoided : The Order of preventing Robberies: The different Manners of the March of the KJm, the Princeffes, and the reft of the Seraglio : The danger there is in hew# too near the Women : The feveral ways of the Royal Hunting, and hm the Kjng hunts with his whole Army: The abundance of people there is in the Army, and the method of making them all fuhft/h SIR, T His indeed is called marching with gravity, and as we fpeak here a la Mogole, : it is no more but fifteen or fixteen dayes Journey from Dehli to Labor, which make lit tle more than fixfcore Leagues &gt; and yet we have fpent almoft two months on this way. Tistrue, the King with the heft part of the Army went fomewhatafide from the high* way, the better to enjoy the divertifcments of Hunting, andfor the conveniency of the water of Gemna, which we went to look for on the right hand, and which we leifurely followed long enough in our hunting, crofting fields of tall grafs, full of all forts of game, where the Horfemen could fcarce be feem At prefent, whilft we are at reft, I am going to make good what I have promifed you in the Title of this Letter j ho ping (hortly to make you come to Kacbemhe, and to (hew you one of the heft Coun tries in the World. When the King is in the field , he hathufually two Camps, I mean two Bodies, of Tents feparated, to the end that when he breaketh up and leaveth one, the other may nave paired before by a day, and be found ready when he arriveth at the place defign’d to encamp it: And ’tis therefore, that they are called Peiche^kanes as if you fhould fay, Houfes going before; Thefe two Peicke-kgnes are almoft alike, and there are requifite a- bove threefcore Elephants, more then two hundred Camels, above an hundred Mules, and as many more Porters to carry one of them. The Elephants carry the moft bulky things, fuch as are the great Tents, and their great Pillars, which being too long and too heavy, are taken down in three pieces. The Camels carry the lefler Tents: TheMulesy the Baggage and Kitchins. And to the Porters are given all the little moveables, and fuch as are delicate and fine, that might eafily be broken i as Porcelain,which the King wfually imployeth at Table: thofe painted andguilded Beds, and thofe rich* which I {hall fpeak of hereafter. One of thek two Peicbe-tynef, or Bodies of Tents, is no fooner arrived at the place defigncd for encamping, but the Great Marftial that orders the Lodging, chufeth fome fair place for the Kings Quarters *, yet with a regard, as much as is poftible, to theSym- rcitry and order that is to be obferved for the whole Army 5 and he marketh out a Square, of which each fide is above three hundred ordinary paces long. An hundred Pikemen prefently clear and level this pace,making fquare planes to raife theTents upon, and furrounding all this great Square with Kanates or Skreens feven or eight foot high, which they faften with cords tyed to flicks, and with perches fix’t in the ground, by couples, from ten to ten paces, one without, and the other within, inclining the one upon the other. Thefe Kanates are made of a ftrong cloth lined with ftained Linnen. In the middle of oneof, the tides of this Square is the Entry or Royal Gate, great and Magnificent, and the Indian fluff which ’tis made of, as alfo thofe Stuft's, of which the whole fide of the Square of the face is lined without, are far better and richer than me others. The \A Voyage to Kachemire, Thefirftand the greateft of the Tents, that is reared in this Inclofure, i$ called Am kyv becaufe it is the place where the King and all the Lords in the Army do afTembl' about nine a clock in the morning, when the Mbkgm, that is, the ufual puBlick IVhe^ ing is held. For, the Kings of Indoflan, although they are in a march, do not difpenc' but very rately with this almoft inviolable cuftom, which ispafs’d into a kind of Du ty and Law, viz. to appear twice a day in theAflembly, there to give order for wH' Affairs, and to adminiher Juftice. The fecond, which is little lefs than the firft, and a little further advanced into the inclofure, is called, Gofl-kgne, that is to fay, a place to wafli in : And here 5 tis where all the Lords every night meet, and where they come to falute and do obeifance to the King, as ordinarily they do when they are in the Metropolis. This Affembly in the evening is very inconvenient to the Omrabs i but it is a thing that looks great and late ly, to fee a far off, in an obfcure night, in the midft of a Campagne, crofs all the ' Tents of an Army, long files of Torches lighting thefe Omrabs to the Kings Quarters and attending them back again to their Tents. Tis true, that ' thefe lights are not of wax as ours, but they laff very long. They are only an Iron put about a flick, at the end of which are wound raggs of old Linnen from time to time, which is moidned with Oyl, held by*the Link-men in their hands in a Brafs, or Lafton-£agon&gt;itha lonp and Freight neck. ” The third Tent, which is not much lefs than the two firff, and is yet furtherad* vanced into the Inclofure, is called Kalvet-\dne, that is to fay, a retired or the Privy . Council-place, becaufe none but the firft Officers of the Kingdom enter into it i and 5 tss there where the greateft and the moft important Affairs are tranfadfed. Yet further into the Square are .the particular Tents of the King, en'cofnpafsM with fmall Kanates or Skreens, of the height of a man, and lined with ffained Indian Stuff, of that elegant workmanfhip of Maflipatam, which do reprefent an hundred forts of different flowers :and fome of them lined with flowred Sattin with large Silk fringes. The Tents joyningtothe Kings, are thofe of the Begum or Princeffes, and the offer great Ladies and She-Officers of the Seraglio, which are likewife encompafs’d, as thofe of the King, with rich Kanates * and amidff all thefe'Tents are placed thofe of the low er She-Officers, and other ferving-Women, alwayes, upon the matter, in the fame order, according to their Office. The Am -kjs, and the five or fix principal Tents are raifed high, that they may be feen at a good diFance, and the better fence off the heat. IVitbout it is nothing but a courfe and Frong red cloth, yet beautified and Friped with certain large Fripcs, cut variouFy and advantagiouFy to the eye : But it is lined with thofe fine Indian flowred Stuffs, of the fame work of Majlipatam i arid this work is raifed and enriched with filk, gold and filver Embroideries having great Fringes, or with fome fine flowred Sattin. The Pillars fupporting thefe Tents, are painted and guild j One marcheth on nothing but rich TapeFry, having matraffes of Cotton under them four or five inches thick, and round about thefe TapeFries there are great fquare Rails richly cover’d to lean upon. ' &gt; . In each tbe two great Tents where the Affembly is kept, there is raifed a Theater richly adorned, where the King giveth Audience under a great Canopy of Velvet, or pur fled with gold. ^ In the other Tents are found the like Canopies, and there you may ^ee alfo fet up certain Karguats, that is, hne Cabinets, whofe little doors are (hut with Silver-locks. To conceive what they are, you may reprefent to you two fmall Squares of our Skreens, fet upon one another, and neatly round about faFned to one another with a Silken-Fring &gt; yet fo that the extremities of the fides of the uppermoF come to incline upon oneanother.fo as to make a kind of a little Tabernacle with this difference from our Skreens, that all the tides of thefe are of very thin and flight Firr-boards, painted and guild without, and enriched round about with gold and Silk-fringes, and lined within with Scarlet, or flowred Sattin, or purfled with Gold. And this is very near what I can tell you of what is contained within the great Square. What concerns the particulars that are without the Square i there are fir ft two pretty Tents on both the two fides of the great Entry or Royal Gate, where arc found two ciioi^e Horfes fadled, and richly harnefs’d, and altogether ready to be mounted upon occafion, or rather for State and Magnificence. On the two fides of the fame Gate are placed in order thofs fifty or thrcefcore fmall Field-I The Paradife of Indoftan. Field-pieces, that make up the Artillery of the Sirrup above mention’d, and which dif- charge all together to falute the King entring into his Tent, and to give notice thereof to the whole Army. Before the Gate there is alwayes left void, as much as may be, a great place, at the end of which there is a great Tent, called Nagar-kgne, becaufe that is the place of the Timbals and Trumpets. Near this Tent there kanothef great one, which is called Tchauky+kgne, becaufe it is the place where the Omrahs keep guard, every one in his turn, once a week twenty four hours together &gt; yet notwithftanding moft of the Omrahs on the day of their guard, caufe, clofe by, to be rear’d one of their own Tents, to be the more at liberty, and&lt;to have more elbow room. , ' • , ‘ : Round about the thr^e other fides of the great Square are fet up all the Tents of the Officers, which are alwayes found in the fame order and difpofition, unlefs it be that the place permit it not: They have all their peculiar names *, but as they are hard to pro nounce, and I pretend not to teach you the Language of the Country, it will be fuffici- ent to tell you, that there is a particular one for the Arms of the King-, another for the tich Hameffes of Horfes i another for Vefts purfl'ed with Gold, which are the ordina ry Prefents beftow’d by the King. Befides, there are four more, near one another \ the M of which is defigned for keeping Fruit i the fecond for Comfits } the third for Ganges water, and the Salt-peter to cool it j and the fourth for the Betele^ which is that Leaf, whereof I have fpoken elfewhere, which is offered to friends, as Coffee is in and chew’d to make ruddy lips, and afweet breath. Next to thefe, there are ^ fftcen oriixteen others that ferve for Kitchins and what belongs to them. Amongff all thefe Tents are thofe of a great number of Officers and Eunuchs. Lafily, there are four or five long ones for led Horfes, and fome others for the beft Elephants , and all thofe that are for hunting. For there muff needs be a retreat for all that great number of Birds of prey, that are always carried for Game and Magnificence *, and fo there muff be for thofe many Vogs^ and thofe Leopards ferving to take wild Goats j for thofe Nilgauspr gray Oxen,which I take for Kicks i for thefe Lions and Rhinocerofsjhat are led for greatnefs i for thofe great Bufalo's oiBengale fighting with Lions ) and laffly for theffe tamed wild Goats, they call Gazelles* that are made to fport before the King. Thisvaft number of Tents, now fpoken of, together with thofe that are within the great Square, make up the King’s Quarter, which is always in the middle, and as ’twereinthe center of the Army, except the place do not allow it. It will eafilybe thence concluded, that this Quarter of the King muff needs be fomething great and royal, and afford a very fine profped, if one behold from fome high place this great bo dy of red Tents in the midft of the Army, encamped in a fair and even Campagne, where may be fully feen all that order and difpolition that is to be obferved in the whole. After that the Great Marfhalof the Camp hath chofen a place fit for the Kings’s Quar ter, and hath made ihe Am-kas to be fet up highetf of all the Tents, and by which he istotakehismeafureforthe ordering and difpofing the reft of the Army accordingly 5 He then marktth out the Royal Bazars or Markets, whence the whole Army is fur- niffit with neceftaries, drawing the firft and the chief of all,like agreat Street running firaight, and a great free way traverfing the whole Army, now on the right hand, and by arid by on the left of the and the King’s Quarter, and always in the ftraight- efi line that may be towards the encamping of the next day. All the Royal Bazars^ that are neither fo long nor fd broad, commonly crofs this firft, fome on this, others oni the other fide of the King’s Quarter *, and all thefe Bazars arc difeern’d by very high Canes like great pearches, which are fixt in the ground from three hundred to three hundred paces or thereabout, with red Standards, and Cows-tailes of the great Ti- / bet faftned on the top of thefe Canes like Pcrirwigs. , The fame M^rftul defigns, next, the place of the Omrahs, fo as they may always keep the fame order, and be ever as near as may.be the Ring’s Quarter &gt; fome on the fight, others on the left hand, fome on this fide of him, others beyond himj fo that none of them may change the place that hath been once appointed for him, or that him- felf hath defired in the begiiiing of th,e Voyage. The Quarters of the Omrahs and Rajas, as to their particular order and difpofition, 2 te to be imagined in a manner like that of the King : For commonly they have two A eicbe-kgnes with a Square ofwhich inclofeth their principal Tent and there of their Women &gt; and round about thefe are put up the Tents of their Officers and • - . . . . / , &gt; R. Ga-A Voyage to Kachenjire. Caya-lkis, with a peculiarwhich is a ftreet of fmall Tents for the lowerfort of people that follows the Array, *md furniHieth the Carap with Forage, Grains, Rice' Butter, and the other things that are raoft neceitary ^ whereby they are fo accommoda ted, that they need not always go to the Royal Bazars^ where generally all things are to be found as in the Capital City. Each Bazar is marked at the two ends by two Canes planted in the ground, which are ast all as thofe of the. Royal Bazars, that fo at a good di/iance the particular Standards fahned to to them maybe difcovered, andthefeve- ral quarters diftinguilh’t from one another. The Great Omrahs and Rafts affed to have their Tents very high. But they muff beware Jed th^y be too high, becaufe it may happen, that thriving, paffing by, might perceive it, and command them to be thrown down i of which we have feen an ex ample in this lad march. Neither mud they be altogether red from without, fince thofe of the King alone are to be fo. Ladly, out of refped they mud all look towards the Am-lyts, or the Quarter of the King. The rdidue of the fpace between the Kings Quarter, and thofe of the Omrahs and the Bazars, istaken up by the Tents-of the Manfeh- 'dars or little Omrahs, and of that infi nite nurriber of great and fmall Merchants that follow the Armyiof all thofe that belong to the Law i and ladly, of all fuch as ferve both the Artilleries : Which maketh indeed a prodigious number of Tents, and requixetha very great extent of ground. Yetitis not all true what is faid of either of them. And I believe, that when the whole Ar my is in a fair and even Campagne .where it may encamp with esfe, and that, follow ing the ordinary plot, it conies at length to be lodged, as near as maybe, in around (as we have often fcen it does, upon this road) the compafs of it will not beabove two Leagues, or two Leagues and an half i and with all this there will yet be left here and there feveral void places. But then the great Artillery, which taketh up a great trad of ground, very often a day or two go before. Nor is all true, whart is faid of the drange confufion, which commonly driktsan adonifhment into all new comers. For a little acquaintance with the method of the Army, and feme heeding of the order obferved in the Camp, will foon enable one to avoid all embarafment, and to go to and fro about his bufinefs, and to find his quarter again j forafmuch as every one regulateth himfelf by the King's Quarter, and the par ticular Tents and Standards of the Omrahs, that may be feen afar off, and by the Stan dards and Perriwigs of the Royal Bazars, which may alfo be feen at a great didance. Yet for all thefe marks it will fometimes fall out, that one Qiall beextreamly per plexed, and even rn the day time, but efpecially in the morning, when a world of people do arrive, and every one of thofe is bufie and feeks to ledge himfelf: And that not only, becaufe there is often raifed fo great a duff, that the King’s Quarter, the Standards fif the Bazars and the Omrahs (which might ferve for guides) cannot be difeover’d : But becaufe a man finds himfelf between Tents that are putting up, and be tween cords, which the leffer Omrahs, that have no Peicbe-kane, and the ManfeVdars ffretch out to mark tlreir lodgings, and to hinder, that no way rnay be made nigh them, or that no unknown perfon may come to lodge near their Tents, whereoften they have their Women : If in this cafe you mean to get by on one fide, you will find the wayef; obfirudfed by thofe ffretched-out cords,|which a troup of mean Serving-rneti handing there with big cudgels, will not fuffer to be lower'd, to fuffer the Baggage to pafs l if you will turn back, you’l find the wayes (hut fince you pafTed. Andbereit is, where you muff cry out, fform, intreat, make as if you would ftrike, and yet well be ware of doing fo, leaving the men, as well as you can, to quarrel againff one another, and aider wards to accord them for fear of feme mifehief j and in fhort, to put your felf into all imaginable poftures to get away thence, and to make your Camels pafs: But the great trouble (s, when a man is obliged to go in an evening to a place fomewhat re mote, hccaufe that thofe offenfive fmoaks of the fire of green Wood, ofCowfhares, of Capie,1-dung, which the common people then make in their kitchins, doraifea miff ( efpecially when there is no wind) fo thick, thatyou can fee nothing at all. I have been three or four times furprized with it, fo as not to know what to do. Well might I ask the way , I knew not whither I went, and I did nothing but turn. Once, amor!g other times, I was conftrained to flay fiill this miff pafTed, and the Moon rifen. And another time l was forced to get to the Aguacy-die, todye down at the foot thereof, ana there to pafs all the night as well as I could, having my Servant and Horfe by me. This Aguacy-dk is like a tall Maff, but very flender, whichcan.be taken down in threeThe Paradife of Indoftan. mum V pieces, and 3 tis planted toward the King’s Quarter, near that Tent which is called Nagar-kgne. In the evening is drawn up to the top of it a Lanthom with a light burn- ing^init all night long&gt; which is very commodious, as being feen a great way offj arid thither it is that people gone aftray do retire, from thence to get again to the Bazars^ and to ask the way, or there to pafs the reft of the night &gt; for no body hinders one from doing fo&gt; and a man may be there in fafety from Robbers. It is called die^ as if you ihould fay, light of Heaven, in regard that from a far olf it appears like a Star. For the prevention of Robberies, each Omrah caufeth a guard to be kept all the nightlong, in his particular Camp, of fuch men that perpetually go the round, and cry Kaber-dar, have a care. Beiides, there are round about the Army fet guards, at five hundred common paces from one another, that keep a fire, and cry alfo Kaber-dar,. And over and above all thefe, the Cotoual, who is, as ’twere, the great Prevoft, fends out Troups of Guards every way,that pafs through all the Bazars, crying out and trumpetting all night long. Yet for all this, fome robberries there are now and then committed j and ’tis neceflary alwayes to be upon ones guard, to go tofleep by times, that fo you may be awake the reil of the night, and not to trulf your fervants too much to keep guard for you. . , But let us now fee, how many different wayes the Great Mogol is carried in the Field. Ordinarily he caufeth himfelf to be carried on mens fhoulders, in a kind of Sedan or Litter, upon which is a Tad-raven, that is, a Field-throne, on which he is feated : And this is like a magnificent Tabernacle with pillars, painted and guilded, which may be (hut with glafs, when’tis ill weather j the four branches of the Litter are cover’d with Scarlet or purpled Gold, with great Gold and Silk-fringes i and attach branch there are two robuif and well-cloathed Porters, that change by turns with as many more that follow. # . a . , r , . Sometimes alfo he goeth on Horfe-back, efpecially when tis a fair day for huntings At other times he rideth on an Elephant, in a Mikdetober, or Hauze -&gt; and this is the moft fplendid appearance : For, the Elephant is decked with a very rich and very mag nificent Harnafs j the Mikcdember, being a little fquare Houfe or Turret of Wood, is alwayes painted and guilded i and the Hauze, which is an Oval feat, having a Canopy with Pillars over it, is fo likewife. In thefe different Marches he is alwayes accompanied with a great number ot Umrahs and Rajas following him clofe and thick on horfe-back without any great order: And ail thofe that are in the Army are obliged to be at the Jmtys at break of day, unlels he do exempt them from it upon the account either of their peculiar Office, or their great Ape. This march is very inconvenient to them, efpecially on hunting dayesi forthey muff endure the Sun and Duff: as the fimple Souldiers, and that fometimes until three of the clock in the afternoon *&gt; whereas, when they do not attend the King, they go at eafe in their Pakhis, clofe cover’d, if they pleafe, free from the Sun and Duft i fleepmg in them couched all along as in a bed, and fo coming in good time to their Tent, which exceeds them with a ready dinner, their kitchin being gone the night before, after fupper. About the Omrabs, and amongft them, there is alwayes a goo num ero Horfe-men well mounted, call’d Gourze-berdars, becaufe they carry a ill o 1 Mace of Armes. There are alfo many of them about the right and left wings, that precede the perfon of the King, together with (fore of Foot men. Thefe Gourze- berdars are Choice-men, of a good men and a fair Ifature, appointed to carry orders, and having ail of them great flicks in their hands, whereby they put peop e a i e a a good difiance, and hinder that no body march before the King to incommode him. After the Rauf marcheth a train mixed of a great number of Timbals and Trump • 1 have already laid in another place, that this Train confifts of nothing but of figures ot Silver reprefenting flrange Animals, Hands, Scales, Fifties, and other myfterious things, that are carried at the end of great Silver-flicks. j r At laft a great t roup of Manfeb-darr, or little Omrah, well mounted, and furniftlt with Swords, Arrows and Quivers, follow after all the former : And this Body is much more numerous than that of the Omrabs, becaufe, befidcs that all thofe that are of the Guard dare not fail to be at break of day, as the Omrahs, at the gate of the Kings Tent to accompany him; There are alfo many, that come amongft them, to make their Court, and to become known there. rv 2A Voyage to Kachemire, The Piinceffes, and the great Ladies of the Seraglio are alfo carried in fundry fa(h- ions j fome are carried, like the King, on mens (boulders, in a ‘Tchaudoule, which is a kind of ‘Tattravan, painted, guilded, and cover’d with great and coftly Net-work of Sj]k of divers colours, enriched with Embroidery, Fringe, and thick pendant tufts. 0- thers are carried in a very handfome Palelys clofed, that are likewife painted and guil ded, and covered with that rich (ilken net-work. Some are carried in large Litters by two ftrongCamels, or by two fmall Elephants, inftead of Mules : and in this manner I have fometimes feen carried Rauchenara-Begum i when l alfo obferved, that in the fore-part of her Litter, being open, there was a little She-flave, that with a peacocks- tail kept oif from her the Flyes and Dub. Laftly, others are carried upon Elephants richly harneffed, and cover’d with embroider’d deckings, and great Silver-bells, where thefe Ladies fit, ralfed, as ’twere, into the middle region of the Air, four and four in Mfy-detnbers latticed, which always are cover’d with filken Network, and are nolefs fplendid and ftately than the Tchaudoules and Vfattravans.' I cannot forbear relating here, that ill this Voyage I took a particular pleafure in be holding and confidering this pompous march of the Seraglio. And certainly nothing more (lately can be imagined, than to fee Raucbenara-Begum march firfi, mounted upon a lu fly Elephant of Pegu in aMikcdember, alUhiningof Gold andAzur, attended by five or fix other Elephants with their Mi^dembers^ almoft as fplendid as hers, filled with the principal She-Officcrs of her Houfei fome of the moll confiderable Eunuchs, richly a- dorned, and advantagioufly mounted, riding on her fide, each with a Cane in his hand j a Troup of ‘Tartarian &amp;yd Kachemirian Maids, of Honour about her, odly and fantallically drelied, and riding pm very pretty Hackney-horfes i and lallly, many other Eunuchs on Horfeback accompanied with (lore of Pages and Lackeys, with great Hicks in their hands, to make way afar off. Mtex fids Raucbenara-Begum, 1 faw pafs one of the prin cipal Ladies of the Court, mounted and attended in proportion : And after this,a third in the fame falhion i and then another, and fo on to fifteen or fixteen all, (moreor lefs) bravely mounted and accompanied accordiug to their quality, pay, and office. Indeed this long file of Elephants to the number of fifty, or fixty, or more, thus gravely marching with paces, as’twcre, counted, and withal this gallant train and equipage, does reprefent fomething that is Great and Royaland ifl had not beheld this Pomp with a kind of philofophical indifference, I know not, whether I (hould not have fuffer- ed my felf to be carried away to tfiofe extravagant fentimentsof moll of the Indian Po ets, who will have it, that all thefe Elephants carry as many hidden Goddeffes. Tis true, one can hardly fee them, and they are almolt inacceffible by men , it would be a great misfortune to any poor Cavalier whofoever, to be found in the F ield too near them in the march i all'thofe Eunuchs, and all the cruc of Servants are to the higheft degree infolent, and delire nothing more than fuch apretext andoccafion to fall upon a man and give him fome Baftinadoes. I remember, I was once thus unfortunately furprized, and certainly I had been very ill ufed, as well as many other Cavaliers, if at length I had not rcfolved to make my way out by my fword, rather than fuffer my felf to be thus maim ed as they began to order the matter and if by good luck I had not been provided with a good Horfe, that carried me vigoronfly out of the prefs, when I put him on thorow a torrent of people, that was to be repaffed. And it is grown in a manner a common Proverb of thefe Armies, That, above all, one muff beware of three things: Firfi, Not to let one felf to be engaged amongfi the troups of the chofen led Horfe, they ne ver failing to firike : Secondly, not to come into the places of Hunting : Thirdly, not to Approach too near the Women of the Seraglio. Yet notwithftandingby whatl hear, it is much leis dangerous here than in Perfiab for there’tis death to be found in the field in fight of the Eunuchs that attend them, though you were half a league dilfant from them. It is required, that as many men as there are in the Villages and Burroughs, where they pafs, do all abandon them and retire afar off. As to the Hunting of the King, I knew not firft how to imagine what is commonly faid, which is, that the Great Mogol goes to hunt with an hundred thoufand men: But now I fee, it may very well be faid, that he goes to hunt with above two hundred thoufand j nor is it a thing hard to comprehend. In the neighbouring places to Agra and Df/?/r, along the river Gemna as tax as to the mountains, and even on both (ides ot the high way to Labor, there is abundance of untilled Lands, fome of Copfe-woo , and fome of Grafs above a mans height: In all thefe places there are great numbers ot Guards, unceffantly roving up and down, and hindering all other people from huntinThe Paradife of Indoftan. except Partridges, Quailes and Hares, which the Indians know to take with nets: So that every where in thofe places there is very great.ftore of all kind of Gatac. This being fo, the hunting guards, when they know that the King is in the field, and near their quarters, give notice, to the Great Hunting-mafter, of the quality of the Game, and of the place where moft of it is: then the Guards do line all the avenues of that quarter, and that fometimes for above four or five Leagues of ground, that fo the whole Amy may pafs by, either this or that way, and the King being in his march may at the fame time enter into it with as many Omrahs, Hunters and other perfons as he fliall pleafe, and there hunt at his cafe, now in one manner and then in another, according tathe difference of the Game. And now behold firft, how he hunteth the Gazelles or wild Fawns with tamed Leopards. I think, I have elfe where told you, that in the Indies there is ftoreof Gazelles^ that are in a manner fhaped as our Hinds or Fawns j that thefe Gazelles commonly go in feveral troups, and that every troup, which never conhfts of above five or fix,is alwaies follow’d by one only male, difcernable by the colour. One of fuch troups being dif- cover’d, they endeavour to make the Leopard fee them, who is held chain’d upon a little chariot. This crafty animal doth not prefently and dircdly run after them, but goes winding and turning, flopping and hiding himfelf, fo to approach them with more ad vantage, and to furpme them : And as he is capable to make five or fix leaps with an almoll incredible fwiftnefs, when he finds he is within reach, he lanceth himfelf upon them, worrieth them, and gluts himfelf with their blood, heart and liver: If he fail-' eth ( which often happens ) he hands Hill, and it would be in vain for him to attempt to take them by running after them, becaufe they run much fafier, and hbld out longer than he. Then the Mailer comes gently about him, flattering him, and throwing him fome pieces of flefh, and thus amulinghim, puts fomething over his eyes to cover them, and fo chains him, and puts him upon the chariot again. One of thefe Leopards gave us once in our march this divertifement, which frighted ftoreof people. A troup of Gazelles appear’d in the midfl of the Army, as they will do every day j it chanced that they paffed clofe to two Leopards thar were carried, as they ufe to be, upon their little chariot. One &lt;?f them not blinded, made fuch an effort that he burft his chain, and darted himfelf after them, but without catching any of them: Yet the Gazelles^ not knowing which way to efcape, being purfued, cried after, and hunted on every , lide, there was one of them that was forced to repafs again near the Leopard, who*’ notwithftanding the Camels and Horfes that peflred all the way, and contrary to what' is commonly faid of this Beall, that it never returns to its prey when it hath once failed of it, flew upon it and caught it. The hunting of the Nilgaux or gray Oxen, which I faid were a kind of Kicks, hath no great matter in it. They are inclofed in great Nets, that are by little and little drawn dofer together, and when they are reduced to a (mail compafs of enclofure, the King, the Omrabs, and the Hunters do enter and kill them atpleafure with Arrows, Hall-pikes, Sables or Mufquets j and fometimes in fo great numbers, that the King fends quarters of them for prefents to all the Omrahs. TheGameof the Cranes hath fomething of divertifement. ’Tis a pleafure tofeethem defend themfelves in the Air againll the Birds of prey i they fometimes kill fome of them i but at length, not being nimble in turning, many flrong Birds mailer them. Of all the Games that of the Lion is the moll Royal, becaufe there is none but the King and the Princes that can exercife it ( unlefs it be by a very particular leaves.) but it is alfo the moll dangerous. The manner of it is this. When the King is in the held, and the Hunting-guards have difeover’d the place of the Lions retirement •, they tye fall an Afs there-abouf, which the Lion foph comes to devour, and without caring to look out for other prey, as Oxen, Cows, Mutton or Shepherds, he goes to feek for drink, and returns to his ordinary lodging place, where he lyes down and fleeps until next morning, when he finds another Afs in the feif-fame place, which the Hunters have fallned there as the day before j and when they havte thus baited and amufed him feveral dayes in the fame place, and now know that the King is nigh, they at length tye fall another Afs, but whom they have made to fwallow a quantity of opium^ to the end that his flelh may the better lull aflecp the Lion, and then all the Country-men of the circumjacent Villages fpread large and hrong nets made for that purpofe, which they alfp by degrees reduce to a fmall compafs, as is pradifed inthe hunting^of the Nilgaux. All things thus prepar’d, the King mounted on an Elephant trap’d withnon, being attended by the great Hunting-mafter, fome Omrabs riding alfo on Ele phants, by abundance of'on Horfe-back, aiid by a numerous Hundp&lt;&gt;' guard on foot, arm’d with Half-pikes, approacheth to the Nets from without S With a great Mufquet (hoots at the Lion j who when he finds himfelf wounded comes diredly to the Elephant, as his cuftom is i but he meets with thofe big Nets tfoppine him, and the King (hoots fo' often at him, that at laif he kills him. Yet in this laii hunting there was a Lion that leapt over thefe Nets, fell upon an Horfeman whofe Horfe he kill’d, and then ran away : But the Hunters met with him, and inclofed him again in the Net, which caufed a great difturbance to the Army j we were three or four dayes padling in fmall torrents running down the mountains, Betwixt under wood and fuch long grafs as that Camels hardly can be feen thereiri i and happy were thefe that had fome provifion of vi&amp;ualsi for all was in diforder : the Bazars c&lt;k\d not range themfelves, and the Villages Were remote. The reafon why we were to fiop there fo long, was, that as it is a good fl/wea with the Indians when the King Kiffe a Lion, fo it is a very ill one, when he faileth, and they think that the Shte would run great hazard if they ihould not mafter him. Hence ’tis alfo that they tnake manv Ceremonies upon the account of this Hunting i for they bring the dead Lion before the King m the general Alembly of the Omrabs, and after he hath been well viewed and exactly meafur’d, ’its recorded in the Archives, that fuch a King, at fuch a time flew a Lion of fuch a bignefs, of fuch hair, of fo long and large teeth and claws not omitting the lead circumftances, ’ 1 (hall here only add a word in reference to what is commonly faid of the Opium, that the Afs is made to fwallow, viz . That one of the chief Hunters affur’d me, that it was but a tale of the vulgar, and that the Lion flept fufficiently without it, whenhehad his belly full. Now to return to our march i when the great Rivers, which in thefe quarters com monly have no Bridges, are to be patted, there are made two Boat-Bridges, about two oi tnree hundred paces diftant from one another i which they know well enough how to chain and fafren together. Upon them they calf earth and draw mingled'together which preventeth the Hiding of the animals. The fird patting upon, and the coming’ rom it are only dangerous, becaufe,^ that befides the great croud, which thencommon- y throngeth , and the great confufion and embarafment, it often happens that pits or limes are made when ’tis moving earth i and then you (hall have Horfes and burthen’d Oxen turn ole upon one another, over whom people do pafs with an incredible diford er ; which would be yet greater, if all were to pafs in weday : But ordinarily the King encampeth out half a League (rom the Bridge, where he days a day or two, and he ne ver almod encampeth farther than half a League from the River on the other fide of the ridge, that (o me Army may have at lead three days and three nights to pafs more conveniently, ° r Ladly, as to the number of people that is found in the Army, it is not fo eafie a thing to determine it. It- is fo differently fpoken of, that one knows not what to judge of if. What I can tell you of it in the general, that is mod probable, is this: Thatin tms march there were at lead, as to Souldiers and 'others, an hundred thoufand Horfe- mcn, and above an hundred and fifty thoufand Animals, asHorfes, Mules or Elephants i hat there were near fifty thoufand Camels, and almod as many Oxen or Attes, that lerve to carry the gram, and other provifions of thefe poor people of the Bazars, their wives and children : for they lugg all with them, as our Bohemians do. Upon this meaiure you may reckon pretty near the number of theferving people, fuppofing that nothing 15 there done but by the force of fervants, and that I, who am but iqjheraukof a ava icr or two Horfes, can hardly do my bufinefs with lefs than three men : Some lay, that in the whole Army, there is fcarce lefs than between three or four hundred ou an per ons. Others reckon more i others lefs. No body ever told them to de- ermine t ic precife number. I can fay nothing of certainty, but only that ’tis a pro- cilgious and almort incredible number; but then you are to imagine, that ’tis all tnc-capital City, that marcheth, becaufe that all the Inhabitans of that Town, living ? ° Urt 3 , t ^ e Arm W ar e obliged to follow them, efpecially when the voyage IS to be long, as this ; or elfe they muft (iarve. i he difficulty is to know, whence and how fo great an Army can fubfiftin the Field, O van a number of people and beads.

I proteft unto you, without any exaggaration that the heats have been fo exceilive, that fometimes they have reduced me to extremity, infomuch that I knew not in the morning whether I fhould live till night. The caufe* of this extraordinary heat is, that the high mountains of Kacbemire being on the North of our road, keep from us all the cool wind that might come and refrelh us from that Quarter, and do refied the fun-beams upon us, and leave the field burnt up and choa- king. But to what purpofe, to play the Philofopher, and to feek reafons for that, which perhaps will kill me to morrow. x THE FIFTH LETTER.

But, God be thanked, I feel the Air a little cooler * my Stomach, Strength and Tongue are returned. So then take this ac count of our new kind of march and trouble. Yefter-night the King firft of all, together with Kauchenara-Begum* and the other Women of the Seragliof the Raja Ragnat that performs the Office of the Vizir, and Rafel-kan the High Steward, went away from this burning place, and laft night the great Hunting-mafler departed with fbme of the greateft and moft neceflary Officers of the Ptoyal Family, and many confiderable Women.

There are alfo abundance of Bees &gt; and (which is rare in the Indies^ there are found no Serpents, Tigers, Bears, Lions, but very fel- dom. So that it may be faid, that thefe are not only very innocent Mountains, but flowing with Milk and Honey, as werethofc of the Land of Promife. Beyond thofe middle-fizM Mountains, there rife Others, very high ones, the top of which are alwayes cover’d with Snow, and appear above the ordinary Clouds and Mills, alwayes calm and clear as well as Mount Olympus, ^ ; \ Out of all thefe Mountains do iffue innumerable Sources and Rivulets on all fides, which the Inhabitants know how to convey to their Rice-fields, and even through raifed Ground unto their little Hillocks s and which, after they have made a thoufand other little Rivulets, and a thoufand Q/c^ta 5 / every where, come at laft tomeet, and to make a very fair River, that carrieth Boats as bigas our River of Seine, and after it hath gently turn’d about the Kingdom, ^nd pa fled through themidft of the Capital City, finds, its out-let at Bararnmle between two fteep Rocks, and having afterwards taken in many fmall Rivers that come down from the Mountains, falls about Atex into the River War. &lt; All thefe Rivulets defeending from the Mountains, make the Plain and all thofe Hillocks fo fair and fruitful, that one would take this whole Kingdom for feme great Ever-gmn Garden, intermixed with Villages and Burroughs, difeovering themfelves between Trees, and diverfified by Meadows, Fields of Rice, Corn, and divers other Legumes, of Hemp, and Saffron*, all interlaced with Ditches full of Water, with. Channels, with fmall Lakes aud Rivulets here and there. Up and down every where are alfo feen fome of our European Plants, Flowers, and all forts of our Trees, as Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricots, Nuts, Vines. The particular Gardens are full of Melons,Water melons, Skinets, Beets, Radilhes, all forts of our Pot-herbs, and of fome we have not., Tis true, there are not fo many forts of Fruit as with us, nor are they fo excellent as purs j but I believe that that is not the fault of the Soil, but that, if they had as good Gardeners as we, knowing to cultivate and graft Trees, to chufe proper places and proper Stocks, and to fend for Grafts from Forreign Countries, they would have as manyandas goodas we* becaufe among that number of divers forts, whichloftpii caufedtobe brought to me, 1 have frequently met with very excellent ones. ^ ^ The Capital City, which is of the fame name with that of the Kingdom* is with- out walls * ’tis three quarters of a League long, and half a League broad * feituate in a Plain, about two Leagues diftant from Mountains, which feem to make as ’twere a Semi-Circle *, and (landing upon a Lake of fweet Water of four or five miles incom- pafs, which is made up of Live-Springs, and of Rivulets running down the Moun tains, and difgorgeth it felf by a Navigable Channel into the River which paffeth through the midft of the Town. This River hath in the Town two wooden Bridges over it for communication. MoftHoufes are of Wood, but well built, and of two or three Stories high * not as if they had not very good Free Stone there ( many old Idol- Temples ruined, and other Buildings made of it, being yet to be feen * ) but the abundance of Wood, eafily defeending from the mountains by little Rivers, which it is cafi into, maketh people find that way of Building turn to better account. The Houfes that (land upon the River have aimed all of them their little Garden, lyingtipon the Water * which maketh a very pleafant Perfpedive, efpecially in the Spring and Sum mer, when men walk on the River-fide. The other Houfes that (land not upon the Paver, have alfo almoft all of them fome Garden *, and there are a good number ok fuch, that have a Channel anfwering to the Lake, and a little Boat to go and divert themfelves upon it. i u In one^nd of the Town there appears an Hill, loofe from all the reft, which maketh another very agreeable Perfpcdfive, becaufe on its Declivity there (land very fine Houles with Gardens, and on the top aMofquee and an Heremitage well built with a Garden, and^ftoj-eof fine green Trees : And ’tis upon the account of thefe Trees and Gardens, that in the Language of the Country ’tis called Haryperbet, as if you (hould fay, the Mountain of Verdure. ^ : v - ■ ' _ ■ 1 * r Opfjbfite to this Hill there is feen another, on which there is alfo a Mofquee, but a little one, together with a Garden, and a very ancient Building, which feemstohave been a Temple of Idols, though they call it TaU Souliman^ that is, the Throne of Solo- ( becaufe that Sohman, as xht Mahumetans fay, caufed it to be built when he came to ' S 2 G Kache-128 A Voyage to Kachemire, j Kaebemire 'i but how they will prove, that Salomon made this Voyage, I know not ‘ r , . . tK . oecnUa, that ’tis full of little Ifles, which are as many Gar- The h P ’ H gteen in t he midft of the Water, by reafon of thofe fruk bearing Trees, and o!Pthe Walks, on bothTides fet with Arbors, and becaufe they fruit bear g &gt; i ar » e -leaved Afpen-trees, Handing at two foot diftance from one anothe' 7 the biggeft whereof may beclafped about, but as tall as Mafts of great Ships, having 1 only a tuft of Branches at the top like Palm-trees, Beyond the Lake, upon the fideof the Hills there is nothing but Houfes and Gardens of pleafure, the place having been found wonderfully proper for it,asbe.ng in a very fine Air, in the view of -the Lake, the Ifles, and the Town, and full of Sprtngs and R Themoft admirable of all thefe Gardens is that of the King which is called CU- limar. From the Lake, one enters into it by a great Canal, border d with great green Turfs This Canal is above five hundred common paces long, and runs twixttwo large Alices of Poplars: It leadeth to a great Cabinet in the midft of the Garden,where begins another Canal far more magnificent,which runs with a little “fing unto the end of the GardemThis Canalis paved with large Free-Stone s its flopmg fide cover d with the fames and in the midft of it, there is a long Row of Jets of Water, from : 5 to .5 foot. There are alfo, from fpace to fpace, great Rounds of Water fcrving for Store- houfes, whence many Jets of Water, varioufly figured, do fpnng up . And this Canal tnds at another Ptcat Cabinet, wbicb is almoft like the niit» ^ Thefe Cabinets, which are in a manner made like Power, feituate in the middle of the Canal, and encompaffed with Water, and confequently between thofe two great Alices of Poplars, have a Gallery that reigneth round about, and four Gdtes oppofite to one another; two of which do refpeft the Alices, with two Bridges o pals over one on one fide, and the other on the other s the othef two look upon the oppofi e Canals. Each Cabinet confifts of a great Chamber m the midfi ot four other Met Chambers,which are in the four Corners: All is painted and guilded within, the great Chamber as well as the little ones, having Sentences with great Letters in the Per/im Tongue written upon them. The four Gates are very rich, t eyarema eo grea Stones with two Columns, taken from thofe ancient Idol-Temples, rumdby CW- Jeban. The price of thefe great Slopes and Pillars is not well known, nor what kind of Stone they be ; though it appears fufliciently, that tis a fort ofprecious Stone, finer than Marble or Pofphyrc. r . From all that hath been faid, one may eafily conjedture, that I am fomewhat charmed with Kackmirc, and that I pretend, there is perhaps nothing m the world like it for fo fmall a Kingdom. It deletves very well to reign over al thofe neighbouring Mountains as lar as Tartary , and over all Indian , as tar as Ceilon , as once it did: And ’tis not without feme caufe, that the ^ call it the Terrefirial Farad# of the Indies •, that Fctyar took fo much pains to make himfelf Maher of it i and that his Son Jeban-Gttire became fo amorous th f reo ^ th he could not leave it &gt; and often faid, he would rather lefe all his Empire, ian mire. And from the time that we arrived there, all the Poets, both Kacfjem f m h Mogolians, ft rove to make Poems to the praifeof this little Kingdom, to preen to Aureng-Zebe, who gladly received and rewarded them. 1 remem er, * ^tam g others, there was one, that exaggerating the extraordinary height or the , ou ” r encompaflmg it, and rendring it almoft inacceffible any where, thefe Mountains was the caufe, that the Heavens did retire into the figure o a » as we fee it? and that Kacbemire being the Mafter-piece of Nature, and t e in q the Kingdoms of the W6rld, it was futable it fliould be hard of zccds, and to enjoy an undifturbed peace and tranquility, commanding all? and not beinglia e manded by any. He added, that the reafon why Nature had furrounded it with Moun tains, of which fome, namely thehigheft and moft remote, were alwaies white an covered with Snow, the lowermoft and the next to the Plain, all green an with Wood, was, becaufe that the King of the Kingdoms of the World was o themoft precious Crown, the top whereof was to be of Diamonds, and the bo Emeraulds. If the Poet had added ( faid I to my Navab Vanechrmnd-lyn &gt; wh willing to make me admire all thofe Poems ) that all thofe great Countries o tains that environ it, as the little Tifor, the State of the Raja Gatnon, aogttParadife of Indoftan. SerenagHer, are to be comprehended under the Kingdom of Kachemirei Cnee accordine to the Hiftory of the Countrey, they once depended from it, and confequently that the River Ganges on the one fide, that of Indus on the other, the Cbenau on a third and the Gemma on the fourth, do iffue out of Kaebemre ; that thefe Rivers with fo many others that run thence, do countervail the Gihon, the Pifon, and the two others j C™. 2 . and ifat laft he had concluded, that this was certainly the true Terreftrial Paradife ra, 14! rather than that in Armenia, this would have much enhaunced the worth of all his Commendations./ ' ' The Kachmmsns have the Reputation of being a very witty people, much more in telligent and dexterous than the Indians, and as fit for Poefie and Sciences as the Per- f ans. Befides, they are very induftrious and willing to take pains &gt; they make Pale- hy** Trunks, Bed-fteds, Standifhes, Boxes, Spoons, , and many other pieces and all of good and very handfome Workmanfhip, fent over all the Indies. They know how to give it a good Vernilh, and fo dexteroufly to counterfeit the Veins of a certain Wood that hath very fine ones, by applying Gold-firings upon it, that there is nothing finer. But what is peculiar and confiderable in them, and which draws the trade and Silver into their Countrey, is that prodigious quantity of Stuffs call’d Cbales which they work there, and employ their little Childeren in. Thefe Cbales are certain kinds of Stuff an Ell and a half long, and about an Ell broad, which are embroidered at each end with a kind of Embroidery about a Foot large. The Mogols and Indians both Men and Women, wear of them in Winter upon their Heads, paffing them ove£ their left Shoulder like a Mantle. They make two forts of them* one, of the wool of the Countrey, which is finer than that of Spain j the Other, df a Wool, or rather of an Hair, they call taken from the Breaft of a wild Goat of the great Tibet. Thefe latter are of afar greater price than the former; neither is there arty Cafior fo foft and delicate. The mifehief is, the worms get eafily into it, uhlefs you have a particular care often to unfold and air them. I have feen of thefe which the Omrabt purpofely caufed to be made, which coft an hundred and fifty Roupies; Of the others that are made of the Wool of theCountrey, I have feen none that cofts above fif- ' . ' ' ' . - ' . / , , : Tis obferved of thefe Chalet, that, work them never fo carefully in Patna, Agra, and Labor, you (hall never make the Stuff fo foft and fine, as in Kacbemire \ which is commonly imputed to the particular Water of the Gountrey: As at Majlipatan they make thofc fine fluffs, which become fairer by waftiing. The Kachemirians are alfo famous for their good complexion. They look as well as our Europeans, and have nothing of a Tartarian flat-nos’d and little ey’d Face, as thofe of Rachguer, and moft of the people of the great Tibet. The Women efpeci- ally are very beautiful j and therefore all Strangers, that are new-comers to the Court of Mogol, are furniftied from thence, that fo they may have Children whiter than the Indians, and which by thefe means may pafs for true Maga//. And certainly, if one may judge of the Beauty of the retired Women by that of the common People, met with in the Streets, and feen up and down in the Shops, we muft believe, that there are very handfomones. At Labor, where they have the repute of being proper and fiend- or, and the handfomeft of the Brown Laffes of the indies fas really they are) I ufed an Art which is ordinary among xhz Mogols, which is, to follow fome Elephants, ef- pecially thofe that are richly harneffed &gt; for affoon as thofe Women hear the two Bells hanging on the fides of thofe Beafts, they all put their heads out of the Windows. The fame Trick I ufed here i and I made alfo ufe of another, in which I fucceeded very well \ it was devifed by an old and famous Matter of a School, whom I had taken to help me to underftand a Perftan Poet. He made me buy ftore of Confits * and he being known and welcom every where, carried me into above 15 houfes, telling them that I was his Kinfman, newly come out of Perfia, that I was rich and to be married: As food as we came into a houfe, he diftributed Confits to the Children, and prefently all came about us, Women and Children, great and final!, to have their (hare, or to be feen This curiofity alone cofi me many a good Roupy j but it confirm’d me, that in Kacke-* mire there are as fair Faces, as in any place of Europe. There remains only to impart unto you what I obferved moft confiderable between the Mountains, from Bember hither, (with which perhaps I (houldhave begun 5 ) and after having given you account of fome other little Voyages I have been obliged to make v ^r spartsof this Kingdom, you will learn all I could come to know of the reft °f the circumjacent Mountains. Con- TheA Voyage to Kachemire, Concerning therefore firft our Voyage, frorn Bember hither, it feem d to me furpriGng enough, to find my felf From the firft night that we parted from Bember, and entred into the Mountains, pafs from a Torrid to a Temperate Zone : For, we had no fooner mounted this dreadful \Vall of tfie ; World, l mean, this, high , ft,eep, black and bald Mountain, of Bembety but that in defceqding on die; other fide, we found an Air that was pretty tollerable, ficfti, gentle and temperate. But that which furptifed me more in thefe Mountains, was, to find my felf, in a trice, tranfported out oi the into Europe. For, feeing the Earth covered with all our plants and (hrubs, exept IlTop, Thyme, Marjoram, and Rofemary, I imagined I was in ft)me of our Mountains of Auvergne, in the midft of a Foreft of all our kinds of Trees, Pines,: Oaks, Elms, Plane-trees. And I was the more aftoniftfd becaufe in all thofe burning Fields of In- dcjiatiy whence \ came* I had feen almoit nothing of all that. Among other things relating to Plants, this furprifed me, that one and a halfdays joumy from Bember 1 found a Mountain, that was cover’d with them onbothfides, but with this difference, that on the fide of the Mountain that was Southerly, toward the Indies, there was a mixture of Indian and European Plants, and on that which was ex- pofed to the North l cbferv’d none but ones &gt; as iftheformeir had participated of the Air and temper of Europe and the Indies, and the other had been meetly European. , . r - ; \ ^ As to the Trees, I admired this natural courfe of Generations and Corruptions: Below jn thefe bottoms, where perhaps no man ever was, I faw hundreds that were falling, or fallen, one upon another, dead and half rotten of age i and other young and verdant ones growing out of .the foot of thofe that were dead : Some of them alfol faw burnt, whether it was from Lightning, or that in the heat of Summer they had taken fire by rubbing themfelvcs againftone another, when they were agitated byfomc hot and impetuous wind i or, as the Country-people fay* that they take fire of them- fdves, when they are grown okl and dry. I admired alfo thole natural Cajcatas of water, which we found between thofe “Rocks. We met, among others, one of them fo wonderful, that doubtlefs, it can not be parallel’d. One feeth a far off from the fide of an high Mountain, running down a Torrent of water in a Channel cover’d with Trees, and precipitate it felf in ^ trice to the bottom of a ftjep Rock of a ftupendipus height, with a noife that is able to ftrike one deaf, dike a Cataraft* There was eredfed near it, a Theatre, upon a Rock, which Jehan-Guire had caufed purpofely to be made plain, that the Court pafT' ing, might there.repofe themfelves, and from thence with conveniency beholdthisad- mirabie W ork-man-lhip of Nature v which as well as thofe old Trees, I was juft now fpeakingof, feems to refemble fomething of great Antiquity, and of the firli produ- eftion of the World. - All thefe divertifements were blended with an odd accident. On the day, that the Ring went up the Mountain of Pire-penjale, which is the higheft of all, and whence one begins to difeover a far off the Country of Kacbemire i on that day, I fay, that the King afeended this Mountain, being followed by a longrowof Elephants, upon which Fate the Women in Mikdembers, and Embarys , one of. thofe Elephants was frighted by beholding, as the I/z^ax would have it, fuch a long and fteep afeent, and fell back upon him that was next , and he upon the next, and fo on to the fifteenth, fo that not one of them being able to turn in this way, which was extreamly rude and fteep, they all tumbled into the precipice. It was good fortune for thofe poor Women, that the precipice it felf was not very fteep, fo that there were but three or four of them kill d &gt; but the fifteen Elephants remai’nd upon the place. When theft bulky Maffes do once fall under thofe vaft burthens they are loaden with, they never rife again, though the way be never fo fair. We faw them two days after, in paffing by, and 1 obferved fome of them yet ftirring their Trunk. This accident put the whole Army, which had mar ched four days along the Mountains in file, into greatdiforder, hecaufe to recover thefe Womenandall that vvreck, a flop was made for the remainder of that day and all the night, every one being neceflitated to ftop where he was, becaufe it was in many places impoftibie to advance or go back, and none had near himohofe Porters that carried hb Tent and Victuals. As for my felf, I was notin the ' worft condition, having fo un means to creepout of the way, and totake the conveniency of a fmall place to lye down hi,,/for my felf and my Horfe. And, to my good luck, one of my fervants that o- low’d me, had a little bread, which we Glared together. I remember, itwas th? re&gt; 7 be Faradife of Indo/fan. Where ftirring Tome ftones we'found a great black Scorpion, which a young Mogul of my acquaintance took, and fqueeied it in his own hand, and then in the hand of my fervant, and at lad in mine, without our being dung by him. This young Cavalier faid , that he had charm’d him, as he had done many others before, by a padageof the Alcoran^ which he would not teach me, becaufe, he jaid^ the power of charming would pafs to me and leave himfelf, as it had paded to him by quitting his Teacher. In traverfing this fame Mountain of Pire-penjale, Where the Elephants tumbled down,. there occurr’d, thofe things which call’d to my mind fome of my former philofophical thoughts. 'The fiAi was, tnat in lefs than an hour we felt Summer and Winters for in afeending we did fweat grofs *drops, all men going on foot in a burning Sun i and when we came to the top ot the Mountain, we yet found the Icy Snow, that had been ;ut to open the way &gt; there was a Frod upon a milling Rain, and th^reblew a wind focold. that all people (hook and run away, efpecially the filly Indiant, who never had feenlce or Snow, nor felt fuch a cold. The fecond was, that in lefs than two hundred paces I met with two quite contrary winds &gt; one from the North, which blew in my face afcending&gt; efpecially when I came near the top, and another frdm the South, which blew againd my back in de fending i as if this Hill had protruded exhalations out of its bowels from all Tides, which coming forth had.caufed, a wind that had defeended and taken'its courfe in thofe two oppofite dales. The third was the meeting an old Hermit, that had lived on the top of this Moun tain fince the time of Jehan-Guire^ and whofe Religion was not known*, though it was faid, that he did mjracles, caufed drange thunders when he would, and raided dorms of Hail, Snow, Rain and Wind. He look’d fomewhat favage-like, having a long and large white Beard uncombed. He asked alms fomewhat fiercely, fuffer’d us to fake up water in earthen cups, he had ranged upon a great done*, made fignewith his hand, importing that we fhould fpeedily march away, and grumbled at thofe that made a noife, becaufe; faid he to me, ( when I was come into his Cave, and had a little fweetned his looks with half a Roupy, which with much humility I put into his hand)a noife raifeth furious dprms and tempeds. Aureng-Zehe^ faid he further, did very well in following my counfel, and not permitting to make a noife : Chah-Jeban al ways took care of the fame i but Jehan Guire once mocking at it, and caufing Trum pets and Cymbals to found, was like to have perifhed here. In reference to the little Voyages I have made in divers parts of this Kingdom,behold the particulars I took notice of as I paired. We were no fooner arrived at Kachemire^ hut my Navah Danecb-mend-kan fent me, together with one of hisHorfe-men for a Con voy, and a Country-man, to one of the extremities of this Kingdom, three fmall days journey from hence, upon the relation made him, that this, was the very time to fee the Wonders (for fo they fpeak of them) of a Spring that is-thereabouf. Thefe Wonders are, that in the month of May, the time when the Snow begins but to melt, this fountain, for about the fpace of fifteen days, regularly flows and dops thrice a day, at break of day, at noon and at night: Its flowing ordinarily lafts three quarters °f an hour, more or lefs, and that plentifully enough, to fillafquare receptacle, having to go down to it, and being about ted or twelve foot broad, and as many foot deep. After the firfl fifteen days, its courfe begins to be lefs regular and lefs copious s and at length, after a month or thereabout, it quite flops and runs no more for the reft nf the year, unlefs it be, that during fome plentiful and long rains, it -flews ircef- fantly and without Rule, as other Fountains do. The Gentiles have on the fide of the Receiver a little Temple of the Idol of Brare &gt; which is one of their falfe Deities *, and thence it is that they call this Fountain Send-Brary, as as if y6u fhould fay, Water of Brares and that thither they come from all parts in pil grimage, to bathe and fanefihe themfelves in this miraculous water. Upon the origin °f this Water they make many fables, which 1 fliall not recite to you, becaufe I find not the lead fhadow of truth in them. During the five or fix days ot my day there, l did jjdiat poflibJe I could to find the reafon of this Wonder. I did attentively confickr the fixation of the Mountain, at the fqot of which this Spring is found : I went to the Ve ry top with great pains, frarching and prying every where. I obferved that it ex tends it fell in length from North to South s that ’tis fever’d from other Mountains, which yet arc very near to it *&gt; that it is in the form of an Afles back j that its top, which ,Sver y Eng, hath not much more than an hundred paces where it is larged j that one ofA 'Voyage to Kachemire, oftbefideof the Mountain, which is cover’d with nothing but green grafs, is expo' fed to the Ea'ft, yet fo that the Sun comes not to (bine on’t before eight a clock in the morning, becaufe of the other oppolite Mountains 9 and laftly, that the other fide, which isexpos’d to the Weft, iscovered with Trees and Bullies. All this being confidered \ did imagine, that the heat of the Sun, together with the particular fituation and the in ternal difpofition of the Mountain, might very well be the caufe of this pretended Miracle , that the Morning Sun, coming briskly to ftrike on the fide oppofite thereto 1 heats it, and melts part of the frozen waters, which during the Winter, when all was covered with Snow, had infinuated thernfelves into the inner parts of the earth ofthis Mountain', that thefe waters penetrating, and by little and little running down unto certain beds of quick rock, which retain and convey them toward the Spring-head caufe the flowing of the Fountain at Noon i Thar the fameSun, raifed to the South 3 and leaving that other fide, now growing cold, for to ftrike with its beams a!’twere perpendicularly, the top, doth alfo melt other frozen waters, which likewife run down by little and little as the other, but by other turnings, unto thofe rocky beds, and caufe the Flowing at Night: and that laftly, the Sun heating likewife this Weftern fide produceth the like efiedf, and caufes the third flux in the Mornings which is flowei than the two others, either becaufe this Weftern fide is remote from the Eaftern where the Source is 9 or becaufe that being covered with wood, it is not fofoon heated i or by reafon of the cold of the night* Now I found this my reafoning the more cogent forafmuchas it feems to agree with what is affirmed, that in the fisft days the water comes in greater abundance than in the latter* 2nd that at laftitftops, and runs not at all * as if indeed in the beginning there were of thofe frozen waters greater plenty in the earth than at laft. It feems alfo to agree with what is obferved, that there are fome days in the beginning, in which one flux is found more abounding than the other, and fometimes more at noon than in the evening or morning, or in the morning more than at noon* it commonly falling out fo that fome days there are hotter than others, pr that fome clouds arife which interrupt the equality of the heat, and confequently make the flux unequal. 1 Returning from Send-brary I turn’d a little afide from the road to go and lye at Achiavel, which is an Houfe of plea Cure of the ancient Kings of Kacbemire, anuatpre* fent of the Great Mogol. That which moft adorns it, is a Fountain, the water where of diffufeth it felf on all fides round about that Fabrick (which is not defpicable) and into the Gardens by an hundred Canals. It breaks out of the Earth, as ifbyforae violence it afeended up from the bottom of a Well, and that withfuch an abundance as might make it to be called a River rather than a Fountain. The water of it is ad mirably good, and fo cold that one can hardly endure to hold ones hand in it. The Garden it felf is very fine, there being curious Walks in it, and ftore of Fruit-beating Trees, of Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricocks and Cherries, and many jets of waters of various figures, and Ponds replenifti’d with Fifh, together with a very high Gz/bta of water, which by its fall maketh a great Nape of thirty or forty paces long, which hath an admirable eftedf, efpecially in the night, when under this Nape there is put a great number of little Lamps fitted in holes purpofely made in the Wall * which maketh a curious fiiew. from Achiavel I went yet a little more out of my way to pafs through another Roy al Garden, which is alfo very beautiful, and hath the fame pleafantnefs with that of Acbiavel^ but this is peculiar in it, that in one of its Ponds there are Fifties that come when they are called, and when you caft bread to them * the biggeft whereofhave gold en Rings in their Nbfes, with inferiptions abqut them, which they fay that renowned Nottr^Meballe^ the Wife of jeban-Guire^ the Grandfather of Attrena-Zebe, caufedtobe faftened in them. ■ . I was no fooner returned from Send-brary^ but Danecb-mend-kan^ well fatisfied with my Voyage, made me undertake one more, to fee another fare Miracle, as he call d it, which ffiould be capable to make me foon change my Religion, and turn Mttjjdntan* Go, faith he, to Baramottlay^ which is not further from hence than Send-brary » thefe you fliall find a Mofquee in which is the Tomb of one of our P/Vez or Saints, which ftillevery day works Miracles in curing Pick people, that flock thither from all parts: It may be, that you will believe nothing of all thofe miraculous Cures you fhallfte» but you will at leaft believe one Miracle, which is done every day, and you may with 1 your own eyes: And that is of a big round ftone, which the ftrongeft man JS hardly 'i ' . ■ ■he: ParacUfe of Indoftan. hardly able to raife in the leaft from the ground, but yet eleven men, by praying to that Saint, lift up, as if it were atfraw, with the end of their eleven fingers, without any trouble at all, and without being fcnlible of any weight. Hereupon I began this journey alfo, accompanied ? with my Horferwan and the Gountrey-fellow, and beings arrived- at Baramewlay&gt; l found it a place pjeafant enough. The Mofquee is fufficient- ly well built, -the Tomb of the pretended Saint well adorn’d, add round about it there was here of people of great devotion, who faid they were fick. Near the Mofquee there was a Kitchen with large Kettles full of Fkfh and Puce, which, in my opinion, was the Magnet .'drawing the Ijdi people thither, and the Miracle that cured them. * On the other fide was the Garden and the Chambers of the Mullahs, who with great convenkney, and delight fpend their life there, under the fliadow of the miraculous ;r San^ity of this T/re, which, they are not .warning to cekbrate’:,But as I am always 1 very unhappy in fuch occahpns, he did no Miracle that day upqn any of tKe fick.' As’ for the great: which Was,//?e bufmefs l came for i there were Eleven Cheats of' thefe MxUhs that crowded together in a,round, and by their long Vefts hundred me : from feeing well in what t man.nc:r they tpok and lifted it up, yet faid all, that they kld it only with the end of one of their fingers, and fliaf if ^as^as light as a feather. For my part, who had my eyes open,and IcoVdophfarrowly, f! perceived well enough, that they took'great , pains, and they feetn^d to me, that they ufed alfq the thumb,- which they held very, him upon the feepn^ finger bent aiid dldfed : But yefi was not wanting to cry out as well as the Mullahs and all the other ailiftants, Kararfiet, Karamet, Miraclef .Miracldj giving at the fame time-a Rpupy for the Mullahs, and with great (Hew of demotion praying them to favouf. pae with Tuffering trie once to be one of the Eleven lifter's up of the Stone. They did.'hefitate.long before they refol^dtnpermit jf, but having giventhem another Roupy, ,and'made, them belkve 1 was perfwaded oh the truth of the Miracle, one of the Eleven gave, me nis place, they ddubfId* imagi ning, that Ten of them joyned together would beTufficieht to do the bufihefsy though I fhould not add much to it, and that they' wpulTfo range themfelves knd crowd to gether, that! fhould perceive moving of .ip?pp(lure; But they found themklves cgfegioufly i deceived, when they favy, thajt rhp §ione, which I would not fupport But^ only by the end of my hrigpr^, r alwayes hkliped and fell to thy fide, untill at length a found it needfary to/put my thumb to it, and ;tp hplTit ^ith my finger as they did P and then we lifted it up from the earth,, riot Without mtfcji' pain. Notwithftand- ing which, when I faw that they all looked u]pon me a (quint, not knowing what to make of me, 1 Fill went on crying like the reff, Miracle, Miracle, and over and above caking to them another Roupy to feciire my felffrom being fton d j and frealing away from among the crowd, I presently took hbrfe, without eating or drink ing, and left the Saint and the Miracles to thofe that had faith enough to believe them . Obferving, as I pa (Ted along, that famous opening, which is an outlet to all the waters of this Kingdom, of which I have already faid fomething in the beginning of this Book. //. ^ ■ . v I left my way again, to approach to a great Lake, which I faw a fa roff, thorough the middle whereof paffeth the River that runs ro Baramoulay. It n&gt; full of Fifh efpecially Eds, and covered with Ducks and wild Fowl, and many other River ow . is w ere the Governour comes in Winter, at which time his covered with thefe creatures, to di- vert bitnfelf with fowling. In the midft of this Lake there is an Erermtage with its little Garden, which, as they lay, doth miraculoully flote upon the water and where the Eremite pafoeth his Life without ever going from it. Befides which they make a thoufand other ridiculous tales of it, which’are not worth reciting, un es per aps you wiilexcept what feme have told roe. That it was one of foofe ancient Kings ofK^- wtVe, who out of curiohty cauied this Eremitage to be built upon t uc ^ cams an. to one another. ,, , , . , • . I hence 1 went to find out a Fountain,whsch hath fomething that s raie enougi in ■&gt; biabling up gently, and rifmg with feme little impetuciity, and making {mall buok s ot air, and carrying with it, to the top, fome fmall Sand that is very tine, whichgoeti away again as it came, 'the Water becoming kill, a moment alter it, without ebulhuon, and without bringing up Sand, and foon after beginning afrefh as beforei and fo continu ing its morion by intervals, which are not regular, but the on er, as v.y a y&gt; con fills in this, that the leak noife, made by fpeaking, or by knocking onesfootagaink the ground, moveth the water, aiid makah.it xun ai^ bubbkeas was laid, Yet Uound194 A Voyage to Kachemire, Plainly, that fpeaking or knocking availeth nothing to produce that cffia and that it moveth as well when one faith nothing, as when one fpeaks or knockch. But now, ran r e 0 f it that tequireth more thinking than 1 have bellow’d upon it i unkft one Ihould fay, that the Sand, bf falling down again, obftruaeth the narrow Channel of this fmall and weak Spring, until the water, being clofed up and kept in .t make an effort to remove and raifeagain the Sand, andfo to d,(engage itfc If i orrather, that fome wind, pent in the Channelof the Spring, tifes by turns, as it comes topafs ' MeTwSconfidered this Fountain, we entred into the Mountains to fee a great I ake which hath Ice iri Summer, and looketh like a httletcy Sea, having heaps of Ice, made and unmade by the Winds. Afterwards we paffed through a certain place, ail’d that is. White done i which is famous for being full all the Summer long of all forts of Flowers like a Partem ,and for this observation that when much people * ' t ? ither mill{inj , a great noife and much ftimng the air, there prefently falls a fhowerofirain. This is cfrtain, that when, fome years fince, went thither, he was in danger of perilhing by the great and extraordinary ram furvemng though he hid commanded, they fhould make the lead noife they could. This agreed with what mv Eiemite of had told me. .. , . . , And now I was going toa Grotta of odd congelations, which is two days purney from thence y but I received news, that after my fo long abfence my Navah was trou- b 'As' toircondition of the neighbouring Mountains round about, I have, fince our being here, done what poffibly 1 could to inform my felf about them y but I have pro fited^ but little,, for want of people that are intelligent and obferve things y yet not- withfianding 1 will not omit to relate to you what 1 have learn d of it. The Merchants of Kachemire, that go every year from mountain to mountain, ga thering fine Wool to make thofe Stuffs I have above been fpeaking of, do all agree, that* between the mountains, which mil depend from K^emire, there are found veiy fine places of good land, and that amongft others there-ts one place, which pays it tribute in Leather and Wooll, fent for by the Governour every year y and where the Women are extream handfome, chaff and laborious y tlwt there uaffo aether ar et off from Kachemire, which alfo pays its tribute m Leather a^ W^ and h«h venr pretty though but fmall, fertil plains, and moft pleafant vallies, abounding mLom, Rice AppIes! Pears, excellent Apricocks and Melons y as alfo in Raifins yielding ray good’ Wine y the Inhabitants whereof have fometimes tefufed to pay the nibute, re« upon the difficulty of acccfs to their Country y but there hath always been aw f found to enter and to reduce them. The fame Merchants agree alfo, that among th other Mountains, that are morediftant and dep^d no more from Mot re, there likewife found very pleafant Countrys, peopled with very handfom Whites, but 1 asalmoft never come out from their homes y of which fome have no Kings, , far as could be perceived, any Religion y only that fome of them do eat no Hln, ing them unclean. ., ', l * j meirripfl a I (hall add here, what I was lately told by a good ancient man, tha Wif? of the ancient Family of the Kings of Kacbemire. He faid, that when / Gain made a ftri&amp; inquiry after all thofe that were of that Family, taken, and thereupon fled with three Servants crofs thefe mountains, n r f ma |i a manner whither he went y that thus wandring he came at la in ° a y Canton, where when it came to be known who he was, the inhabitants cam o him and brought himprefents, and that, to make up their kmdncfs, lh J hi “ ( hat him in the evening one of the beautifulleft of their young Maidens, pi y he would bed with her, becaufe they defited very much to have iffi* of his (h£ paffing from thence into another Canton, not much dilhnt trem , . o j- ^ people likewife came to fee him, and to prefent him » butt at ^ e , Lj mt hcir evening was far different from the other, in that thefe inhabitants rou ^ ^ ^’s own Wives, arguing that thofe of the other Canton were ea s, , QLjy^th Blood would not remain in their houfe, fince the Maidens would carry th them into the houfe of him, to whom they (hould be married. between the I may further add, thit fome years fince, there beinga difiention i i t he pre- family of the King of the little 'Tibet, which borders upon ^ tenders* to the Crown did fecretly call for the alliftance of the GovernoI he Paradifeof Indoftan. who by order ef Chah-Jeban gave him powerful fuccours, and put to death or flight aH the other pretenders, and left this man in the pofliffion of the Country on cond: tiOn of an annual Tribute to be paid in Cryftal, Musk and Wool. This petty King could not forbear coming to fee Aimng-Zebe, bringing with him a prefent of thofe things i juft now named j but he had fo pitiful a Train,That I ftiould never have taken him for what he was. My Navah entertained him at dinner, that he might receive the better information concerning thofe Mountains. I heard him fay, that his Country on the Eaft fide did confine with great Tibet b that it was about 30 or 40 leagues broad j tha^ there was indeed fome little Cryftal, Musk, and Wool, but for the reft very poor i and that there were no Gold Mines as was faid that in fome places there was very good fruit, efpecially Melons i that they had very hard Winters,and very troubleiome, becaufe of the deep Snows 5 and that the people, which formerly had been Heathen, wasalmoft all become Mahometan, as himfelf, namely, of that Sed called Cbia, which is that of all Perfia. Befides, that fevenieen or eighteen years ago Cbah^yehan had attempted to make himfelf Mailer of the Kingdom of the Great Tibet, as formerly alfo had done the Kings of Kacbemire^ i that his Army after fixteen days difficult march, always among Mountains, did beliege a Gallic which they took ? that there remain’d no more for him to do, than to pafs aPuver, which is famous and very rapid, and thereupon to march dire&amp;Iy to the Capital Town, which he would have eafily carried, the whole Kingdom being in a panick terrour s but that the feafon being far fpent, theGovernour of Ka- chemire, who was the General of that Army, did apprehend he ffiould be furprized by the Snow, and fo returned, leaving in that Gaftle a Garrifon, which, whether it was from fear of the Enemy, or from want of Efficient provifion, he could not fay, foon a- bandon’d it j which broke the defign the Governour had of returning thither the next Spring. Now that the King of this Great Tibet knows, that Aureng-Zebe is at Kacbemire, and threatens him with War, he hath Cent to him an Ambaftador, with Prefents of the Countrey, as Chryftal, and thofe dear White Cow-tails, byway of ornament faften’d to the ears of Elephants, as alfo Musk, and a Stone of Jacbenoi great price, becaufe of an extraordinary bignefs. This Jachen is a blewifti Stone with white veins fo hard that it is wrought with nothing elfe but the Powder of Diamond, highly efteemed in the Court of the Megol. They make Cups of it and other velfels, of which I have fome richly wrought with threads of Gold, of very curious Workmanffiip. The Train of this Ambaffador did confift of three or four Cavaliers, and ten or twelve tall men, dry and lean, having three or four hairs in their beards like the Cbinefe, and plain red Bon nets upon their heads like our Seamen, the reft of their Garments fuitable. I think there were four or five of them with S words, but the reft marched behind the Ambafla- dor without any rod or ftick. He treated with Aureng-Zebe in his Mafters name, pro fiting that he would fuffer a Mofque to be built in the Capital City, wherein Prayers mould be made after the Mahometan way •, that the Money, henceforth to be coined, ffiould on the one fide have the Imprefs of Aureng-Zebe, and that he would pay him a ‘-’ertain annual Tribute. But’tis believedj that as foon as this King ffiall know that Aureng-Zebe is gone from Kacbemire, he will laugh at all this Treaty, as he did formerly at that, which he had made with Chab-Jehan&gt; This Ambaftador had in his fuit a Phyfician, which was faid £0 be of the Kingdom ofLajfa, and o£ the Tribe Lamy or Lama, which is that of the men of the Law in that Country, as the Brahmans are in the Indies with this difference, that the Brahmans have no Caliph, or high-Pneft, but the Lamians have one that is not only ackpawledged °r fuchby the Kingdom of Laffa, but alfo by all Tartary, and who is honourfd- and re ferenced like a divine perfon. This Phyfician had a Book of Receipts, which he would ' We was fo &gt;or Do ctor. He was much wedded to the Metempfycbofis or Tranfmigration of Souls, and was f H of admirable ftories of it &gt; among the reft he related of his great Lama, that when f was old and ready to die, he aftembled his Council, and declared to them, that now oc was palling into the Body of a little Child, lately born, that this Child was bred up with great care, and when it was about fix or feven years old, they brought to it ftore f houffioid-ftuff pel mel with his own, and that the Child was able to diftinguiffi thofe, ffiat were or had been his from that of others: Which was, aid thisDodfor, an au- ' T 2 thentiek sever iell to me j tne writing of it feem’d, at a diftance, fomewhat like ours tnadehim begin to write the Alphabet, but he w^ote fo flowly, and his writing in refpedt of that in his Book, that we foon fudged, this muft needs be a pcA Voyage to Kachemire, themick proof of the Tranfinigration. For my part, I thought at hrft he rallied, but I found at laft, that he fpoke very ferioufly. 1 was once to fee him at the AmbalTadors With a Merchant of Kachemire^ that knew the Language of Tibet, and was an Interpre ter to me. I made as if I would buy fome Stuffs he had brought to fell, which were feme kind of R-atines of about a foot and an half broad &gt; but it was really to learn fome- thing of that Countrey, yet it was no great matter I obtain’d from him. He only told me in general, that all the Kingdom of the great Tibet was, in comparifon to his, ami- ferable Countrey, full of Snow for more than five months of the year j that his King made often War with the Tartars } but he could never diftinguifh to me, what kind of Tartars they were. At length, after I had made a good many Queflions to him, without receiving any fatisfa&amp;ion upon them, I faw I loft only my time with him. But there is another thing, which is fo certain, that no body here doubts of it. ’Tis not yet twenty years, that there went Caravans every year from which crof- fed all thofe Mountains of the great Tibet, entred into and arrived in about three months at Cataja^ notwithftanding the very ill ways, and the rapid Torrents j which latter are to be paffed over Cords ftretched from one Rock to another. Thefe Ca ravans brought back Mush^, China-wood, Rubarb, and Mamiron, which laft is a fmall root exceeding good for ill Eyes. Repairing over the great Tfe they alfo loaded themfelves with the Merchandife of that Countrey, viz. Musl^, Cryftal and Jacben, but efpecially with ftore of very fine Wool! of two forts, one of Sheep, and the other called Touz, which is rather, as I have faid, a kind of hair approaching to our Caftor, than a Wool!. But fmee the attempt, which Chah-Jehan made on that fide, the King of the great Ti- bet hath altogether ftmt up the way, and fufters not any onz Uom Kacbemire to enter into his Countrey : And thence it is, that the Caravans at prefent go from Ratna upon the Ganges, not pafling through his Countrey at all, but leaving it on the left hand, and coming diretftly to the Kingdom of Lajfa. Concerning this Kingdom, here called Kacbeguer, which doubtlefs is that which our Maps call Kafcar, I {hall relate to you what I was able to learn of it from the Merchants of the Countrey it felf, who, knowing that Aureng-Zebe was to ftay a while at Kacbe- min, were come thither with a good number of Slaves, of both Sexes, whom they had to fell. They fay, that the Kingdom of Kacbeguer lyeth Eaft of Kacbemire, drawing a little Northward i that the ftiorteft way thither was to go diredfly to the great T/% i but that paftage being obftru&amp;ed, they Were forced to take their way through the littte Tibet j that firft they went to a fmall Town, call’d Gourtcbe, the laft Town depending from Kacbemire, and four days journey diftant from the fame s that from thence in eight days they came to Eskgrdou, the Capital City of the King of the little 7?^, and thence in two days more to a fmall Town call’d Cbekgr, likewife belonging to the little Tibet, and fituate upon a River very famous for being Medicinalthat in fifteen days they came to a great Foreft upon the Confines of the little Tibet, and in fifteen days more to Kacbeguer a fmall Town, once the Seat of the King of Kacbeguer, which is now at Jourkgnd, lying fomewhat more to the North, and ten days journey diftant from Ka- cheguer. They added, that from the Town of Kacbeguer to Katay ’tis no m&amp;e but two months voyage j that every year there go Caravans, bringing back of allthofeCom- moditics I have named, and pafting into Rerfia thorough Vsbecl^, as there are others that do pafs to Patna in Inf oft an. They faid moreover, that to from Kacbeguer to Ratay, Travellers mull get to a Town that is eight days journey from the laft Town of the Kingdom of Kacbeguer i that the ways from Kacbemire to Kacbeguer are very difficult i that among others there is a place, where, in what feafonfoever it be, you muft march for about a quarter of a League upon Ice. This is all, I could learn of thofe parts, which though indeed it be very much confufed and very little, yet will it be found much, confidcring I had to do both with people fo ignorant, that they almoft knew not to give a reafon of anv thing &gt; and\v\(\\ Interpreters, who, for themoft part, know not how to make the Queftions to be underftood, nor intelligibly to deliver the Anfwers made thereto. I thought once, I would have here concluded this Letter, or rather this Book, and taken my leave of you until! I came to Debli, whither we are now returning :But fince I am in the vein of writing, and at fome leifure, 1 fhall endeavour to give you fome fatisfa&amp;ion to thofe Five particulars, you demanded of me in your laft Letter in the name of Moufieur Tbevenot, that illuftrious perfon, who daily giveth us more difeove- ries, without going out of his ftudy, than we have learned of thofe that have gone round the World. The&gt; The Paradife of Indoftan. The firft of his demands is, Whether it he true, that in the Kingdom of Kachemire there ate Jews fettled there from immemorial times &gt; and tf fo, whether they have the Holy Scripture, and if their Old T eft ament be altogether conform to ours ? The Second is, That l would give yon an account of what I have ohferved touching the Mounfons, or the Seafon of the ordinary Rains in Indies. The Third is, That I would give you my Ohfervatrons, and declare to you my Thoughts concerning the wonderful regularity of the Current of the Sea, and the Winds in the Indies. The Fourth is. Whether the Kingdom of Bengale is fo fertile, fo rich, and fo beautiful^ as Tis jaid to be ? The Fifth is, That I would at length decide unto you the old Controverfie touching the Cmfes of the Increafe ef the Nile. Avfver to the fir ft Demind, concerning the Jews. I Should indeed be very glad, as well as Monfieur The, venote that there were Jews to be found in the Valley of thofe Mountains, who might be fuch, as I believe he would have them &gt; I mean, of thofe Ten Tribes tranfported by Salmanaffen But you mayaffurehim, that if anciently there have been of them in this place ( as there is fome reafon to believe there were, ) there are none of them at prefent, and all the inhabi tants of it are now either Gentiles or Mahumetansi and that perhaps Tis China, where leymay be found. For I have lately feen,in the hands of our Reverend Father,thejefuit of Vehli, fome Letters of a German Jefuite written from taking notice that he had there feenfome of them,that had preferved the Jewifh Religion and-the Old Tdfament, that knew nothing of the Death of JESUS CHRIS T, and that they would even have made this Jefuite their Kacan, if he would have forborn to eat Swines fldh. Mean time bere ztto are not wanting feveral marks of Judaifm. The firfi is, that at the entring into this Kingdom, after having paffed the Mountains of Pire-penjale, all the Inhabitants I faw in thefirft Villages feemed to me to be Jews, in t heir garbe and meen, and in Something peculiar, which maketh us often difeern Nations frome one another. I am not the only perfon, that hath had this thought j our Father, the Je fuite, and many of our Europeans had the fame before me. The fecond is, that I have obferv’d, that among the meaner fort of the people of this Town, though they be Mahumetans, yet the name of Moufa, that is Mofes, is much ufed. The third, that commonly they fay, that Salomon came into their Country, and that it was he that cut the Mountain of Baramoule to give an outlet to the waters. The fourth, that they fay, Mofes died at Kachemire, and that his Tomb is one league diftant from this Town. The fifths that they pretend, that that little and very ancient Edifice, which appears from henpe upon an high mountain, was built by Salomon^ and that thence they call it to this i^ery day the Throne of Salomon. So that 1 would not deny, but that fome Jews may have penetrated hither i and that in length of time they may have loft the purity of their Law, turned Idolaters^ at laft Mahumetans. Inftiort, we fee ftore of the Jewilh Nation that have pafled into Per/?*/to Lar, Ifpahan, and alfo into Tndojlatt on the fide of Goa and Cochin: \ have been informed, that there were of them in Ethiopia, even gallant and military men, and fome of them fo confiderable and po tent, that there was one of them, fifteen or hxreen years agoe, that had attempted to make himfelf King of a little Country of the Mountains of a very hard accefs j if it be true, what two Ambaffadours of the King of JEthiopia, that were lately in this Court, related to me. Anfwer'to the Second Demand, about the ftated Rains in the Indies. t He Sun is fo ftrong and violent in the Indies all the year long, and principally for the fpace of eight months, that he would burn all, and render the Country , barren and inhabitable, if Providence had not particularly provided and difpoTed things in fo admirable a way, as that in the month of July, when the heats are moft violent, Kains begin regularly to fall, which continuing for three months together, do temper the Earth, and render it very fruitful^ and fo qualifie the Air that it may be endured* Yet are not thefe Rains fo regular, that they fall always juft at the fame time, of which ^ have, made many obfervatiens in different places, and principally atVehli, where I hvf'jd s lone while. The like i$ found in other Countries, and there is always fome AA Voyage to Kachemire &gt; dift'erence in the time from year to year: For fonaetimes they begin or end a fortnight or three weeks fooner, fometimes later i and there are alfo fome years, in which they are not fo plentiful as in others', infomuch that two years, together it did almoft not rain at all *, which caufed much Sicknefs, and great Famine. Befides, there is alfo this difference in refped of Countries different and remote from one another, that thefe Rains ordinarily begin fooner, or are more plentiful in one than in the other. Forex- ample, in Bengale and along the Coali of Coromandel^ as far as to the I fie of Ceilan^ they begin and end a month fooner than towards the Coafi of Malabar: And in Bengale thefe Rains are pouring down for four months, and fometimes continue for eight days and nights together without intermifiion j Whereas at Vehli and Agra they are never fo flrgng, nor fo durable, there palling fometimes two or three whole days without any Rain i and ordinarily the whole morning from break of day until about nine or ten a clock it rains but very little or nothing. But the moft confiderable difference! have j obferv’d, is, that the rains in divers places come from different quarters of the World, as about Vebli they come from the Eafi, where lies Bengale \ whereas, on the contrary, in the parts of Bengale and upon the Coaft of Coromandel they come from the South j and upon the Coaft of Malabar they proceed almoft always from the Weft. I have alfo obferved another particular about which they all agree in thofe parts, viz. That according as the Heat of the Summer comes fooner or later, is more or lefs violent, and lafts longer or a fhorter time j the Rains alfo come fooner or later, are more or lefs plentiful, laft longer or a fhorter time. Thefe Obfervations have given me ground to believe, that the Heat of the Earth and the Rarefadfion of the Air muft be the principal caufes of thefe Rains, and draw themi forafmuch as the Air of the Seas, which lie near round about the Lands, being colder, more condenfed, and more groffe, filled with clouds which the great heats of the Summer raife from the waters, and which the winds drive and agitate, difchargeth it felf eafily upon the Land, where the Air is hotter, more ratified, in more motion and lefs refifting than upon tfyeSeas, fo as that this difcharge is more or lefs t&amp;rdy and abundant, according as the Heat comes fooner and is more violent. Sutable to the fame Obfervations I was perfwadcd that if the Rains begin fooner upon the Coaft of Coromandel than upon that of Malabar^ 5 tis by reafon that the Sum mer begins there fooner, it being poflible'that there it may do fo for fonrie particular jeafons, which perhaps would not be hard to find, if the Country were well examin’d: For we know, that according to the different fituation of a Landin reipedt of Seas or Mountains, and according as’tis more Sandy, or Hilly, or Woody, the Summer comes there either fooner or later, and with more or lefs violence. ~ I am further perfwaded^ that it is no wonder, that the Rains come from different quarters i that upon the Coaft of Coromandel^ for example, they come from the South; and upon that of Malabar from the Weft s hecaufe that in all appearance it muft be the neareft Seas that fend them, and the Coaft of Coromandel is nearer to the Sea, which lyeth Southerly in refpedt of it, and is more expofed to it, as the Coaft of Malabar is to the Weft of it, lying towards Bahelmandel, Arabia^ and the Gulf Oi Ferjia. Laftly, I have imagined, that if at Dehli, for example, the Rains come from the Eaft, it may yet he that the Seas which are Southerly to it, are the origin of them j but that they are forced by reafon of fome Mountains, or fome other Lands where the Air is colder, more condenfed and more refifting, to turn afide and difcharge themfelves another way, where the Air is more rarified, and where confequently they find lefs re- liftancc. I forgot to tell you, that I alfo obferved at Debit, that there it never rains to purpofe, till for many days there have paffed ftoreof Clouds Weft ward as if it were neceffary that thofe fpaces of Air which are beyond Debit Weftward, fhould be firft filled with Clouds, and that thefe Clouds finding there fome obftacle, as it may be fome Air lefs hot and lefs rarified, and confequently more condenfed and more able to rcfift, or fome other contrary Clouds and Winds repelling them, fhould become fo thick, fb burthen- fom and fo heavy, that they muft fall down in Rain, after the fame manner as it often enough falls out, when the Wmd drivcth the Clouds againft fbme high Mountain. Anfm rTbe Paradife of Indoftan. i Jrtfrver to thz third Demand, which is concerning^ the Regularity of the Cur rent of the Sea, and of */;eWin&amp;s in the Indies. ^ • A S foon as the Rains do ceafe ( which ordinarily comes to pafs toward s themonth of Offober, }it is obferved, that the Sea taketh its courfe Southward, and that the cold Northern VVinds arifeth. This Wind blows for four or five months without intermiflion and without dorms, always keeping the fame equality as to its ftrength and quarter, unlefs it change or ceafe a day or fo by accident, but then it returns again unto its former place and temper. After that timej for two months or there about the other Winds do reign without any rule. Thefe two months being pad, which is call ed the Intermediate fcafon, or, according to the Hollanders, the Wavering or Changing Seafon, the Sea returns back from South to North, and the South-wind rifeth to reign alfo in his turn for four or five months, as the Current of the Sea doth: fothat them pafs two months of intermediate feafon i during which, Navigationis very difficult and dangerous, whereas during the two Seafons it is very eafie, pleafant and without peril, except it be about the end of the feafon of the South-wind. Hence you may find caufenot to wonder, if you hear that the Indians^ though elfe very timorous and inex pert in the art of Na vigation, do notwithdanding make pretty long and confiderable Voyages i as when they fail from Bengale to TanaJJ'ery, Achem, Mslaque, Sian and Ma- fyjfar j or to Mj flip at an, Ceilan, the Maldives, Moka, and Bender-Abaffy *, becaufe they take their time to go with one good Seafon, and to return with the other. ’Tis true that oft enough they are furprifed and cad away j but that is, when they cannot dif- patch their affairs in good time, or fail of taking their meafures. Our Europeans a\fo do fometimes lofe themfelves, though they be far better Sea-men, bolder and more underftanding, and their Ships better condition’d and equipped. Of thefe two intermediate Seafons, that which maketh the South-wind is incompar ably more dangerous than the other, and much more fubjedt to tempeds and dorms: And even in the Seafon it felf this wind is ordinarily much more impetuous and unequ al than that of the North. And here I mud not omit to give you a remark, which is, that about the end of the Seafon of the South-wind, during the time of 1 the rain, al though there be a great calm out at Sea, yet ’tis very tempeduous near the Goads» to thediftanceof fikeenor twenty leagues: whence the Ships of Europe or others, when they will approach the Indian Goads, for example, of Suratte, or Majlipatan, muft be very careful of taking their time to arrive jud after the Rains &gt; or elfe they run great hazard of being fplit and lod upon the Goad. This is very near what I could obferve of the Seafons in thefe parts» of which I nwch wi(h I could give you a good reafon. I (hall venture to tell you, that it came into my thoughts, that the Air, which environs the Globe of the Earth, ought to beedeemed to have a (hare in it, as alfo the Water of the Sea and Rivers, forafmuch 2 s both the one and the other gravitate upon this Globe, tend to the fame Center of ,f &gt; a nd fo are in fome manner united and faden’d to it) fo that from thefe three Bo dies, the Air, the Water and the Earth, there refults as’twere one great Globe. Next, that the Globe of the Earth being fufpended and balanced, asitis&gt; in its place, in that free and un-refided fpace, where the Creator thought good to place it, would be cap- able to be eafily mov’d, if fome adventitious Body diould come againd it and hit it. Thirdly, thzt the Sun having pad the Line to move towards one of the Poles, fbrexam- P the Arttiqicc, coming to cad its rays that way, maketh there impreffion enough to deprefs a little die Arfiiqxe Pole, and to do that more and more according as it advan- ceth towards the 1 ‘ropiqne y letting it rife again by little and little, according as he returns towards the Line, untill by the force of his rayeshedo the like on the fide of the^«tar- tiqite Pole, . Rthefe fuppofitions, joyn’d to that of theViurnal Motion of the Earth, were true, it were not mothinks, without reafon what is commonly affirm’d in the viz. *hatthe concludes and carries with him the Sea and Wind. For ifit be true, that having p a flp cc j t j ie Lj ne to go towards one of the Poles, he caufeth a change inthedi- jediion of the Axis of the Earth, and a depreffion in the Pole on that fide, the other ‘°le mud needs be raifed, and that confcquently the Sea and the Air, being two fluid a nd heavy Bodies, run down in this inclination : fo that it would be true to fay, that tlle Sun advancing towards one Pole, caufeth on that fide two gieat regular Currents, - viz.

Upon |his ground, me things;' it might be fa id, that there are no other but two main oppotite Fluxes of the Sea, one from the fide of the Pole Ar&amp;iqw, the other from that of the Autartique y that if there were a Sea from one Pole to the other, that paffed through pur Etirope, we ijSuld fee, that thefe two Currents would there be regular every where, as they ire' imtlie Indies, and' that that which hinders this regularity of the Flux from being genefalj, is, that the Steis are' intercepted by Lands, which impede, break, arid vary their Courfe V in like manner as fome fay, that the Ordinary Flux and Reflux of the Sea is hindtpdfn thofe 'Seas that lye in length, as the Mediterranean doth from EalVto Well.

As'to the Commodities of great value; arid which dra w the Commerce of Strangers thither , I know riot, whether there be a' Country in the World, that affords more aiv greater variety: For, be tides'the Sugar I have fpokeri of, which may be numbred among ^The Paradife of Indoftan. the Commodities of value, there is fuch here of Cottons and £/%, that it may be faid, that Bengale is as 5 twere the general Magazine thereof, not only for or the Empire of the great Mogol^ but alfo for all the circumjacent Kingdoms, and for Europe it felf. I have fometimes hood amazed at the vaft quantity of Cotton-Cloth of all forts, fine and others, tinged and white, which the Hollanders done, draw from thence and tranfporu into many places, dpecially into Japan and Europe i not to mention what the Enghjhj Portingal and Indian Merchants carry away from thofe parts. The like may be faid of the Silks and Siik-Stufls of all forts : One would not imagine the quan tity, that is hence tranfported every year i for, this Country furnilhes generally all this great Empire of Mogol as far as Labor and Cabouf and moft of the other forrain parts, whither Cotton-Cloth is carriedi 3 Tis true, that thefe Silks are not fo fine as thofe, of Perjia, Syria, Sayd and Barnt i but then there is alfo a great difference in the price &gt; and I know from good hands, that whofoever (hall take 'care of choofingthcm well,and of getting them well wrought, may have very good Stuffs made of therm The Hol landers alone have fometimes (even hundred or eight hundred men of the Natives at work in their Fa&amp;ory of Kajfem-Bazar j as the Englifh and other Merchants have theirs in proportion. It is alfo in Bengalee where that prodigious quantity of Salt-peter is found i which is fo conveniently carried down the River Ganges from Patna, and where the Englifh and Dutch load whole Ships full for many places of the Indies and for Europe. Laftly, 3 tis Bengale, whence the good Lacca, Opium, Wax, Civets long Pepper do come i and even Butter is to be had there in fo great plenty, that though it be a grofs Commodity, yet notwithftanding 3 tis thence tranfported into divers places. It cannot be denied that the Air, in regard of Strangers, is not fo healthy there, efpecially near the Sea: And when the and Ho/Wcr/firft came to fettle there many of them dyed i and I have feen in Balafor two very fine Englijh Ships, which having been obliged, by reafon of the War of the Hollanders^ to flay there above a year, were not able to go to Sea, becaufe moft of their Men were loft. Yet fincethe time that they have taken care and made orders, as well as the Hollanders y that their people (hall not drink fo much Bouleponges, nor go fo often a'fhore to vifit the Sellers of 4 rac and Tobacco, and the Indian Women i and fince they have found, that a little Wine of Bourdeaux, Canary or Cbiras is a marvellous Antidote againft the ill Air &gt; there is not fo much ficknefs amongft them, nor do they now lofe fo many men. is a certain beverage made of Arac, that is, of ftrong water, black Sugar, with the Juice of Limon water, and a little Mufcadine upon it &gt; which is pleafant enough to the tafte, but a plague to the Body and to Health. . As to the Beauty of the Country, you are to know, that all takingitnear an hundred leagues in length on both (ides of Ganges•, from Kaje-mehale unto the Sea, is full of great Channels, formerly cut out of the River with vaft labour, r ^ ac |j' ing far into the Country for the conveniency of tranfporting Commodities, and the Wate^ it felf, which by the Indians is counted the heft in the world. Thefe Channels are on both (ides lined with well-peopled Villages and Burroughs of Gentiles, and the large Fields, lying near them, bear abundance of Rice, Sugar, Corn, Legumes, Muflard, Sezamum for Oil,/^//Mulberries of two or three foot high, to feed Silk worms. But then the vaft number of great and fmall Kies, that are in the midft of Ganges, and fill all that great fpace of fix or feven days journey, ( as there is in lome places of this Pviver from one fide to the other i) this giveth an incomparable eau ,y to the Country : For, they are very fertile, filled with fruit-bearing Trees, Ananas s, and all forts of verdure, and interlaced with a thoufand little Channels, which you cannot fee the end of as if they were fo many Water-mails all covered with 1 rees. Ine worft of it is, that many of thefe Kies that are next the Sea, are now abandoned by rcafon of thofe Corfaires, the Franguys of Rahgn, elfewhere fpoken of*, and that they have at prefent no other Inhabitants but Tigers ( which fometimes fwim over from one Kle to the other ) and Gazelles, and Hoggs, and Poultry grown wild. And fis upon the account of thefe Tigers, that for people travelling between thefe Itttle Kies in fmall boats, as ufually they do, 3 tis dangerous in many places to land j betides, great care is to be had, that the boat, which in the night is fattened to Trees, be not too near the Bank i for there are now and thenfome men furprifed i and I have heard it laid, that Tigers have been fo bold as to come into the boats, and to carry away men that were aileep, chufing the biggeft and fattett of them, if one may believe the Watef-men ot he Country. ‘ , V I142 A Voyage to Kachemire, I remember, I made once a voyage of ten days, from fipli to Ogottli, between thofe Ifles and Channels i which I cannot forbear to relate to you, becaufe there paffed not a day without fome extraordinary accident. My Chaloupe of feven Oars was no fooner got out of the River Fipli, and advanced 3 or 4 leagues into the Sea along thd 1 coaft to gain the Ifles and the Channels, but we faw the Sea covered with Fiflies like huge’ Carps, purfued by a Shole of Dolphins. I made my men row that way, and faw that moft of thofc Fiflies lay along the Coaft as if they were dead i that fome advanced a little, others played and tumbled as if they were drunk. We all la boured to take fome of them, and we caught *24 with our hands without any difficul ty. Viewing them I obferved, that out of all their mouths there came out a bladder (like thofe that are in Carps, ) which was full of Air, andreddifli at the end. I ima gined eafily, that this muft be the bladder which kept them from linking 4 but 1 could not conceive, whyitftiould thus come out of their mouth, unlefs it were that they had been long and clofely purfued by thofe Dolphins, and had made fo great an effort to fly away as to make this bladder thus fwell, and colour, and to hang out of their mouth. I afterwards told this thing to an hundred Sea-men, but they could not be lieve it, and I never found but one Dutch Pilot, who told me, that failing once upon the Coaft of China, he had met with the like, and that prefently they put out their Boat to Sea, and took, as I did, with their hands abundance of Fifties. The day after, about even, we came among thofe Ifles, and after we had look’d fora place, where’twas likely no Tigers would come, we landed, made tire, dreffed a couple of Pullets, and our Fifti, which was excellent. Prefently after Supper l made my men row until night, and for fear of lofmg our way between thole Channels in the dark, we retired out of the great Channel, and found a good flicker in forae fmall Creek, where we fatten’d our boat to a thick branch of a Tree, far enough from the Land, for fear of Tigers. In the night, when I was watching, there fell out a Thilofophical accident, of which kind two had happen’d to me afore in Debit. I faw a Rainbow of the Moon, which I ftiew’d to all my Company, and which very much fur- prifed twoFortuguefe Pilots I had taken into my Boat at the deflre of 3 ftdend, who had never feen nor heard of fuch a thing. The third day we went aftray between theft Channels, and if w 1 aid not met with fome Portuguefes making Salt in one of the Ifles, that diredied us in our way, I know not what would have become of us. But behold another Philofophical accident. ^ In the night, being got again under flielter in a little Channel, my Portuguefes th^t ftill were concerned about the Rainbow ot the laft night, and whom that Obfervation had made more curious to behold the Heavens, awaken’d me, and fliew’d me another, as fair and as well form’d as that was, which I had ftiewed them. Mean time 1 would not have you think, that I miftook an Iris or Rainbow for a Corona, or Crown. There is no month almoft but at Dehli thefe Lunar Rainbows are feen in the feafon ot the Rains, when the Moon is high above the Horizon : And I found that it muft be fo &gt; having feen of them three or four nights one after another, and fometimes double ones. They were not Circles about the Moon, but oppofite to her, and in the like Pofition with Solar Rainbows: And as often as I have feen them, the Moon was Weft ward, and the Rainbow Eaftward. The Moon was alfo near full j which in my opinion, isne- ceffary » becaufe at other times fhe would not have light enough to form any. Lafily, thefe Rainbows were not fo white as the Crowns ufe to be, but much more coloured, infomuch that there might be difeerned in them fome diftin&lt;ftion oi Colours. And thus you fee, how I have been more happy than the Ancients, who, according to Arijtctk, had obferved none fuch before him. , The fourth day about evening we retired out of the great Channel, as we uled 0 do, into a very fair place of fafety j but had one of the moft extraordinary nights t at ever I knew. There was not a breath of wind, and the Air wasfo hot and mining that we could fcarce breath. The Bufhes round us were fo full of thofe little mining worms, that they feem’d to be on fire * 5 and there arofe fires here and there, whic were like flames, and frighten’d my Sea-men, who faid, they were D ev 'k* the reft there arofe two, that were very extraordinary » one was a great Globe or r &gt; which in falling and fpinning lafted above the time of faying a P atcr nolier ’ an ^ other, which lafted about a quarter of an hour, was like a little Tree all in a n a J Tlc ‘ The night of the fifth day was terrible and dangerous. There arofe fo great a or , that though we were under the (belter of Trees, and that our fmall Boat was \\The Paradife of Indoftan. faften’cf, yet notwithltanding all that, the Wind broke our Cable, and was caftine into the great Channel, where we had infallibly pcnOi’d, if 1 had not, together with my two Portuguefef, prtfently laid hold on the Branches of fome Trees, where we held fall for above two hours, whjlft the ftorrae lafted : For there was no afliitance ro be ex- pcded from my Indian Oar-men, whom fright had made incapable to help us in this occalion. But, what was moft troublefome and amazing, there fella Rain as ifithad been pour’d down with buckets, which tilled our Boat, and was accompanied with liich Lightning and Thunder-claps, very near our head, that every momenf we thought we (liould fink. ■ , The remainder of our Voyage unto the ninth day, when I arriv’d at Omli we pafed very well and -with pieafure •, dor i could not be fatish’d with behold ingVuch beautiful Countries: Mean time my Trunk and all my Baggage was we^ mv Pnllprc dead, myFilh fpoilcd, and all my bifcuit drunk with water. Aufoer to the Fifth Qwflion, about the Increafe of the Nile. I do not know, whether I (hall acquit my felf, inrefpedtof this Fifth Queliim, as it were to be w idl’d : But I (hall faithfully impart to yog what / have fetdownof it after I had twice obierved the Nile's Increafe, and carefully examined the fame, and’ taken notice withal of fome things in the Indies, which have afforded me greater aids for it, than that Learned Man could have, that hath fo ingenioufly written of it though he never fiaw Egypt but in his Study. I h^ve already faid in another place, that at the time when the two Ambaffadours of Mthiopia were at Debit, my Jgab Danechmend-han, who is extraordinarily curious, fent often for them, to inform himfelf, in my prefence, of the Condition and Govern- ' taent of their Country •&gt; and one day, amongti other things, we occafion’d thtm to difcourfe of the Source of the Nik, which they call Abbabile s whereof they fpake to us as a thing fo knovyn that no body doubted of it, and where one of thefe Ambaffa dours, and a Mogoliati, that was return’d with him out of JEthiopia, had been in perfon. They told us, that it taketh its Origin in the Country of the Agsws, and iffueth out of the Earth at two big bubling Springs, near one another, which form a final 1 Lake of about thirty or forty paces long i that at the coming out of this Lake it is then al ready a pretty River, and. that from place to place it receiveth other Rivers which en large it. They added, that it runs bending, and forming a great Pen-infule, and that after feveral Cafcatols from fteep Rocks, it falls into a great Lake, which is not above four or five days journey from its Source, in the Country of Dumbia ox Dembed, three little days journey from Gander, the Metropolis of that having traverfed that hake, it iffueth thence fweU’d with all the waters that fall there, paffeth through Sonnar, the principal City of the King of Euneys or Barbaris, tributary to the King of Mthiopia, running on and making the Cataracts, and fo erKring into the Plains of which is ^ _ / . ' V After we had learned thefe particularities of the Source aud Courfe of the Nile, I asked him, (to judge whereabout the Source of the,Nile might be ) towards which part of the World they believed the Coultrey of wherein is GoWer, to be, inre- fyedfof Babel-mandel? But they knew not what to anfwer to this, but only, that they went alwayes Well ward, and efpecially^ the Mahumetdn Ambaffadour, f who was obliged to know better, and to take more Notice of thePofition ofthe World, than the CbrijUan, becaufe the Turks are obliged in faying their Prayers to turn th.emfelves towards Mecca ) did affure me, that l was not at all to doubt thereof: Which did afloniff me ve ry much, becaufe, according to their Defcription, the Source of the Nile fliould be much on this fide of the JEquinoclial) whereas allour Maps with Ptolomie place it a good way. beyond it. We alfo asked them, at what time it did ufe to rain in JEthiopia, and whether there were regularSeafons of Rain as in the Indies'? To which they anfwer’d, that it ni ffd almolt never upon that Coafi of the Red-Sea, from Suaken-Arktko, and the file Mdfouva to fiabelmandei, no more than it doth at Mol^i, which is on the other fide, ln Happy Arabia but that in the Heart of the Country, in the Province of an 4 in that of Dumbia ahd the circumjacent places it rained much for two of the hot- months of the Summer, and at the fame time when it rain’d in the Indies b which was alfo, according to my computation, the very time of the IncreaTe of the A/iff in144 A Voyage to Kaehemire, Egypt. They faid further, that they knew very well, it was the Rain of JEtbiopU which fwelled the Nile, overflowed and fertdixed the ground of it by the flime it carried upon it ^ and that it was even therefore, that the Kings of Ethiopia pretend ed a Tribute to be due to them out of Egypt, and that, when the Mahumetans made themfelves Matters of it, ill treating theChriftians of the Country, they had a mind to turn the Courfe of the Nile another way, viz. into the Red-Sea, thereby to mine Egypt and to render it infertile ; but that this deiign mifcarri'ed by reafon of the great difficulties in effeddng the thing. All thefe particulars, which I had already learned, when I patted over to Mopa, from a dozen Merchants, that come there every year in the name of the King of Ethiopia to attend the Indian trading Veffels, are coniiderable to make us judg, that theM/e increa- feth not but by the Rains which fall without Egypt towards the Source of that River: But the particular Obfervations, I have made upon two Increafes of this River, make them yet more'fo*, for, in reference to all thofe Stories, that are made of it, as, %&lt;n 5 tis on a determin’d day it begins toincreafe that on the ttrtt day of itsincreafe , there falls a certain Dew, which maketh the Plague ceafe, fo.thatno body dieth anymore of it after that hath once fallen j and that there are peculiar and hidden caufes of the overflowing of the Nile: In reference, I fay, to thefe flories, I have found during the faid two Inundations, that they are but tales fancied and amplified by the people df Egypt, naturally inclin’d to fuperttition, and amazed to fee a River fwell in fummer in a Country where it rains not: And I have found, that’tis no otherwife with the Nik than ’tis with other Rivers, that fwell and overflow by plentiful Rains, without any fuch fermentations of the nitrous foyl of Egypt, which fome havefnggetted as the caufe thereof. I have feen it fwelled above a foot, and very turbid, near a whole rhonth before that pretended determined day of its Increafe. I have obferved during its increafe, and before the Channels were open’d, that when it had grown for fome days a footer two, it afterwards decreafed little by little, and then began to increafd a new, and fo went on to increafe and decreafe without any other meafure but that of the Rains that fall nigh the Source, and, as is often feen in our River Loire, according to the fall of more or lefs Rain in the Mountains whence it flows, and the days or half days of fair weather there. In my return from Jerufalem, going up from Damietta to Cairo, I chanced to be upon the Nile abbut a month before the pretended day of the Derp-fall, and in the morning we were all wet of the Dew fallen in the night. I have been in Kofette at fupper with Monjteur de Bermon, Vice-Conful of our Nation, ' &lt; eight or ten days after this day of the Vetv-iaU, when three perfons were ttruck with the Plague, of whom their died two within eight days, and the third, which was M. de Bermon himfelf, had perhaps not efcaped, if I had not pierc’d his Plague-fore j which prefently infedfed my felf like others j fo that, if l had not forthwith taken fome Butter of Antimony, I might have been as wella&amp; they, an Example of the little certainty there is in the Plague after the Dew, but this Emetic Medicine in the beginning of the Evil i wonders, and I kept but three or four days wkhin doors &gt; during which, I remem* er, my Bedouin that ferv d me made no fcruple fo drink, in my prefenee, the remain der of my broth, to encourage me, and from his principle of Predettination, to laugh at the fear we have of the Plague. Yet Experience (hews, that after the day of the Dew the Plague is commonly not fo dangerous as before, but the Dew contributes nothing to that j tis only in my opinion, that then there is a greater opening of the th^b^d'*^*^ ^ VCS a VCnt *° ^ ie ma hgn and pettiferous fpirits, that were fhutup in Moreover, I have carefully enquired of fome Matters of Boats, that had gone up as far as the end of the Plains of Egypt, that is, to the very Rocks and Cataradlsj who attured me, that when the M/e did overflow in the Plains of Egypt, where that pre tended fermenting Nitrous Earth is, ’tis at the fame time much fwelled between thofe fountains of the Cataracts, where, in all appearance there is no fuch Nitrous Earth* Befides, I have made diligent enquiry of thofe Negro's of Sonnars, that come to ferve , _ at Cam, and whofe Country, being tributary to the King of Ethiopia, as 1 havefaki, iyes upon the Nile between the Mountains above Egypt j and they have attured me, that at the fame time when the Nile is high and overflowing in Egypt, ’tis fo alfo with them.!' Vi ' iwu by reafon of the Rains then railing in their Mountains, and higher up in the Country oi Hab/che or ^Ethiopia. The Observations i have made in the Wie/, concerning the regular Pvains that fell at the fame time when the Nile fwells in Egypt, are alfo very confiderable in this mat ter, and may make you imagine, that the Indus, Ganges, and all the other Rivers of thofe parts are fo many Niks, and the Land, that is near their fall into the Sea, fo many Egypts. This was my thought of it in Bengale, and what follows are the very words 1 fet down about it. i 7 . That great number of Ifles which are found in the Gulf ofBengala at the Mouth of the River Ganges, and which by lapfe of time are join’d to one another, and at length with the Continent, put me in mind of the Mouths of the Nile, where I have obferved almoft the fame thing*, fo that as 5 tis faid, after Ariftotle, that Egypt is the Workman- (hipof the Nile , fo it may be faid, that Bengale is the Work of Ganges, only with this , difference, that as the Ganges is incomparably bigger then the Nile, fo he carrieth with him towards the Sea a far greater quantity of Earth *, and fo forms greater and more lilands than the Nile j and that the Hlands of the Nile are deftitute of Trees, where as thofe of Ganges are all covered with them, becaufe of thofe four months of conftant and plentiful Rains that fall in the heart of the Summer, and render it needlefs to cut Channels in Bengale, to water and enrich the Earth, as they do in Egypt. It is juft fo with Ganges and theother Rivers of Indoftan, as with the Nile v this and thofe increafe in Summer by the means of Pvain, which qrdinarily fall at that time *, except that then, and almoft never, there are no Rains in Egypt, but a little toward the Sea, and that it rains not about the Source of the Nile &gt; whereas in the Indies it rains in all the Countries, through which any Rivers pafs i except the Kingdom of Scymid towards the Eerfian* Gulf, where is the Mouth of the River Indus j it happening that in Pome years it doth not rain there at all, though for all that the Indus Cwclls there, and the Fields are water’d by the means of cut Channels, juft as in Egypt. For the reft, concerning the defire of M ‘Tbevenot, to impart to you my Adven tures of the Red-Sea, of Suez, of Tor, of Mount Sinai, of Gidda (that pretended Holy Land of Mahomet, half a days Journey diftant from Mecca &gt; ) as alfo of thelfie of Camarane and Louhaya, and of whatever I could learn at Moh# of the Kingdom of JEthiopia, and of the moft commodious way to enter into it i thefe particulars, I fay, I (hall in time draw fair out of my manuferipts, if God permit.

A Letter felt from Chinas in Verjia, June 10 th 1668. To Monfieur Chape He ; Concerning his Defign of repairing again to hx Studies y about fome Points re lating to the Doclrme of Atoms, wci to the Nature of the Mind of Man, My dear Friend^ I Did always believe what Monfieur Luillkr, Laid, That it would only be a Tran- fport of Youth, and that you would quit this kind of Life, fo much difpleafing to your Friends, and at length return to your Studies with more vigour than ever. I have been informed from Indoftan by the laft Letters of my Friends, that you are now in good earneft, and are going to take a flight with Democritus and Epicurus, far be yond the flaming Walls of the world, into their infinite Spaces, to fee and vidtorioufly to report unto us what may, and what may not be done, Et ultra procefftt longe flammantia, See. to take a Review, and to fall upon a ferious meditation of the nature of thofc Spaces, the general Place of things j upon thofe infinite Generations and Corruptions of their pretended worlds by their alledged fatal Concourfe of Atoms , upon the Nature, Indi- vifibility, and other Proprieties of their Atoms j upon Liberty, Fortune and Deftiny j the Exiftence,Unity,and Providence of Godiupon theufeof the Parts of Animals*, upon the Soul, and all the other fublime matters they have treated of. For my part,! cannot condemn this Defign,the inclination we have to know,being na- turakon the contrary I am bound to believe,that it belongs but to great Souls to elevr.te themfelves to fuch high Enterprizes, in regard it is principally by this means, that a tnan can make appear what he is, and the advantage he hath above other Animals. But as the higheft Undertakings are commonly alfo the moft dangerous, this certainly is not without much danger. For though we feem to have a peculiar inclination and affedH- on tofruth j yet it feems alfo, that we have another very ftrongone to Liberty and In dependency, not to acknowledge a Mafter above us, and to fay, to believe and to do all according to our Phanfie, without the fear of any, and without an obligation to render an account for any thing *, fo that if we be not upon our Guard, this latter Inclination will carry away the Bell &gt; and if we flay upon the Reafons that carry us to this liberty, and content our felves with flightly confidering thofe that might take us off from it i we (hall foon find our felves engaged in a flrange life, or at leaft be in fufpence between both, and tofled up and down between a *Tmay be that this is fo, and 'Tlmay be that it is notfi', lukewarm, or cold, flow, and indifferent to what concerns the End and Rule of our life. Moreover methinks, that moft Philofophers fuffer themfelves eafily to be carried a^ way to this vanity of believing, that to entertain Opinions beyond the vulgar, is the way °( being reputed Rare and Excellent Wits, they taking pleafure even to vent fuch Opi nions as fomething Myfterious, belonging to none but men of great Knowledge , and grounded on deep and weighty Reafons i although they be not too much perfwaded memfelvesofwhat they affirm. So that if fuch men do not take great care on that hand a uo, they (hall not fail to be feized on by the aforementioned vanity,and whilft they go jbout to perfwade others of what they are not perfwaded themfelves, they (hall iq- fcufibly fall into that very Belief •, like a Liar, who after having often related one and t^e j le fame Untruth, or at laft believes it to be a Truth i Or atleafl they fliall in the end Jallintothofe unquietnefles, may be 3 s, and indiffercncies, which I have mention’d in- . ^ of attaining that flateof folid tranquility and fublime knowledge, which they pro- Iri ifed, and wherewith they flatter’d themfelves. Laftly, there is no doubt, that though we have this inclination to learn, yet we are withal very lazy j we defire indeed Knowledge and Truth, but we would have it very v '• , cheap,148 Atoms and the Mind of Man. cheap} without much Labour and Watching, which are irkfome things, and often difturbing our health} yet neceffary evils if we will know thoroughly the leak thing arid tnakp our felves capable to give a foild Judgment thereof. And thence it comes' that if we be not conftantly upon our Guard, and contend not perpetually with our flolhful- nefs, we (hall foon come to flatter our felves with this belief*, That to know things' there needs not fo much painful fludy i and fo not being to refolve upon an uncelfant Labour, we fuffer our felves to be eafily furprized with that Appearance of Truth, which ihineth forth in the Reafons commonly produced by thefe Gentlemen, called lesEfprits forts* inftead of ferioufly examining them, that fo they may not be made to appear to us beyond what they contain of ftrength, nor the force of thofe that make againft them be hid and difguis'd i as often enough happens, either by ignorance or preventi on, orclfe by the vanity and prefumption of thofe perfons, that make it their bufinefs to dogmatize i orlaiily, by, 1 know not what, unhappy pleafure we generally uke in fuffering things to be exaggerated to us, or in exaggerating them our felves, tending to nothing elfe, than pleafantly to deceive one another. Thus, my dearFriendyo tell you freely my thoughts of your Defign i methinks,that in Philofophy, and efpecially in the ftudy of thofe high matters which you undertake there is no middle way: I mean, that ert&amp;er we muft, without fo much fubiiming our ' Wits, fuffer our felves to be fweetly carried away by the Currem, which fo many men of good fenfe, and that are reputed honeft perfons and good Philofophers, do follow ( which to meTeems to be the beft and furefl, as well becaufe of the great Labour, this ftudy demands, as of the danger there is, that in Pmlofophizing but by halves’ and not penetrating things to the bottom, we get nothing by the bargain but difquieting Doubts, making us unhappy the reft of our days, and leaving us often very vicious, and uneafie to Society *) Or elfe, if we will Philofophize, to do it to purpofe, and that, without fearing the labour, and without fuffering our felves to be furprized by the vanity of coveting to pafs for extraordinary Wits, as alib without fuffering our felves to be carried away by that unhappy inclination of defiring to live without a Maker and a Law ’, that, I fay, without thefe, we fall refolutely upon the ftudy, and from a pure love to Truth, we become obftinate in weighing and weighing again all that comes be fore us, in meditating, writing, converfing, debating i in a word, in f ^getting no thing of what may contribute to improve eur underftanding, and to render it more intelligent. As to what at prefent you demand of me by your laft, viz- that I (hould impart to you what came into my thoughts when I was difcourfing with our Vanecbmend-kan, the Learned Gentleman of Afia^ about all thofe matters, you are now applying your Stu dies to: Khali fell you freely,and without flattering my felf,that you might addrefs your lelf to a more intelligent perfon than me^bftt to none, that hath ftudied them with more care, then I have done. For I have not only contented my felf, exactly to weigh the ryafonsof all that ever I could come to fee of both Ancient and Modern Authors, Arabians alfo, and Perftans, and Indians \ but I have farther conferr’d an hundred times .with .whatever great men I could any where meet with, fo far as that I have often fain d, when I was with thofe Efprits forts^ as they will be call’d, that I was not averfe rrom thqir Sentiments, to the end that they might conceal nothing from me. But chat being a thing of great prolixity, it will be better, fince you are now on the way to re turn into Europe^ to refer that matter to our Meeting there, when we (hall be able by word of mouth better and more conveniently to declare our thoughts to one ano- ther. Yet notwithflanding, that I may not feem to becarelefsof your deiirc, 1 (hall in the mean time tell you thus much of the nature of our Underftanding, fhat it feemsto me very rational to believe, that there is fomething in us more perfe 61 and excellent, than all that which we call Body or Matter. You know, according to the Idea that Ariflotle hzth given us of the Fifl Matter or things, that nothing can be imagin’d fo imperfedt, as it. For, in fliort, to be nothing but a certain Neque quantum, neque quale, is, methinks, to approach to a Nothing as near as may be. You know al(b, that all the perfedfions and proprieties, which Ve~ mocrim and Epicurus attribute to their Primitive Bodies, ortotheflrft and foie Matter 0 . things, comes in a manner to this, that there are certain ftnall and very folid Beings, without any vacuity in them, and indivifible j all having flame particular and effential figure, fo that there is an infinite number of round ones, f for example ) an infinity Pyratnidal, an infinity of Square, and infinity of Cubick, Hooked, Pointed, gularAtoms and the Mind of Man, u | ar ones -, and To an innumerable number of other kinds of different Figures i all moveable of their own nature, and of an unimaginable Celerity i yet fome of them r ere proper for the fcnfible motion of Concretions than others, that is tofay^ for dif- ensaoing and feparating themfelves, or for flying fooner and more cafily away than others in the diffolution of Compounds, according as they are more or lefs.fmall, or more or kfs round, or more or lefs poliflfd and llippery : And laftly, that they areal! eternal by their nature, and confequently all incorruptible and independent (as they pretend A though they be without any fenfe, reafon and judgment. You know, I fay, that all the Proprieties of their little Bodies come, very near, to what. I have now faid of which Iddire you to be mindful, that fo we may hereafter judge, whether they be capable of what is aferibed to them. t , . Yet to take nothing from the force of their Principles, and to undeceive you i if you b e ij eV e p have call off Atoms , Ifhall avow to you frankly, that the morel confider th^tVivifibn to Infinity ot any portion of Finite matter, the moreabfurd and unworthy of 1 PhMopher it (cems tome : and I believe the Reafor*, which are alledged to prove ■ it to be as captious as thofe, which Zem, fuppofing this fame divtfibility, brought to biovc that there was no motion fince Mathematical Points, Lines and Superficies, which L ve n 0 beinn but by the Underftanding, and are without profundity, ought not to be transferr’d and applied to Bodies Phyfical, which cannot be without all the dimenf.ons, and are the workmanflrip of Nature : To which add that a Philofopher ought fo a- vo'd as much as is poffible, to dive into Infinity, that being a deep and dark Abyfs, ■which often fetveth men for nothing elfe but to hide themfelves, and in which the wrt of man is at a perfccPi lofs. _ ^ ., . « . Moreover, 1 acknowledge, I am frill of that opinion, not ot/js that Atoms are nidi- , vilible, becaufe they are little portions of Matter or little hardBod.es, refilling, and inpenetrable (proprieties as effential to Matter, as Extenfion) and betaufe they are pure, mattcrcondnued,without any parts that are only contiguous, and of which each hath its particular and determinate S u per flee i but alfo that the feparanon, disjunction ordif* fociationof parts mecrly contiguous in a compound, is( in my judgment, the only divi. lion conceivable : fo that ’tis not poflible, not only to divide any Atome, tha is any por tion of matter purely continuous,though wefhould fuppofe it as longas a Needle, fmee that to divide it with Sciffers , for example, or other wife you muff come to tome pe netration, which is inconceivable to us s and that ,t muft needs be that fometh.ng of the Needle, fome portion or fome part (if it may be faid, that there are P^ ts * n a whole wh re there are no contiguous ones) do yield, and yet that t.s inconceivable, how it were able to yield to the Sciffers that ftould prefs it, or to make other anterionr ones yield without penetration *, and that the more, becaufe the parts preffed, and the part’d the Sciffers that fhould profs, are both of them of the fame Nature an^ the fame force both hard refifting and impenetrable. So that the UoCtnne ot Atoms haTh this Meat advantage that it doth not fo much as its Principles, by deman ding tg^u out of nter favour the Inability of the Prim.tiveBod.es ■, forafmuch »Kfi k -«i.a fc, ,k, ... . n«, l»w o« -*«* “ r i: ssssf Ss&amp;tA Ss sx i 1 ” D °S7‘p.oof bSS co^poukd, ho» flb.il fc.v.r rii &gt;• ““'trsit; k“ sir, iww k f. dif P .f,d .h„ ,k,&lt; Ihould ™.

Laftly, l (hall very willingly agree, that the Sed of Democritus and Epicum, fit being fuppos’d’ that the Atoms are the workmanfhip of the Almighty and ^All-wife hand of God, ) hath very great advantages above the reft , in that it can give a more probable reafon of a great number of confiderable effeds of Nature, where others come Ihortj and in my opinion, there are none but fuch as have not examined things thoroughly, and compar’d other Seds with it, that can doubt thereof. But to imagine and to perfwade my felf, that their Principles, with all thofe advantages, at length are capable, as they would have it, by a particular concourfe, order, union and difpofition, how admirable foever, and even by an intelligent guidance intervening, to arrive to the forming of fuch an Animal as is Man in his operations i This is that, my dear Friend^ which 1 could never think poftible i it hath ever appeared to me contrary to Reafon and good Senfe, and will doubtlefs, appear fo to you, provided you have the patience to recoiled what you have heard an hundred times, and which I am now going to repeat to you atter my own way. It is .not that 1 mean to preach to you, and to make you believe I am become a very good man after my return fa Traveller like my felf, and brought up in the School of Atoms, might poftibly do Miracles, which I know not whether men would believe any thing of» ) Be perfwaded, that if I take upon me to difeourfe to you, it is not out of any vanity or affedation, but from my inmoft fenfe, and with all poftible hncerity. Nor is it, that I pretend, with all this Preamble, to have found any new Pveafons in the Indies s exped no fuch thing, l pray : I do almoft defpair as well as Cicero, that men fhould ever find any thing more upon this Subjed beyond what hath been already found. It would be no hard task for me to (hew, that all what the Mo derns have faid concerning it, is either nothing, or nothing new j There would need no more, than to begin with taking up again, what Gajfendi znd Arnault have written about it againft Des Cartes, to which 1 find not, that he hath made any Anfwer : And it were to be wiftied, that he had been able to anfwer them fo demonftratively and magifterially, as it feems he would have men believe he did : I fhould embrace, and little lefs than adore the Author of a Demonftrationupon this Argument) and to fuch an one the following Verfes would be much more defervedly applicable, than to that ancient Atomift i Qui genus hum mum genio fuperavit, &amp; omnts Prrtftinxzr Stellas^ exortus uti Mthtrem Sol. I ftiall therefore defire but one thing of you, which is, That you would pleafe to make ( which feems to me the only thing to be done here ) a ferious refiedion upon what paftethn?ft/w2 us, and upon the operations of our Underftandirig &gt; and that thereupon you would tell me lincerely. Whether you think, that there is a proportion between the perfedion of thofe operations, and the imperfedion of what we call Body or Mat ter , fuppoting ( what you will eafily grant me ) that how much foever you ftrain your mind, you ftiall never conceive any other thing in Atoms, and generally in all that s Body or Matter, than thofe proprieties already enumerated, Size, Shape, Hardnefs, Indiviftbility, Motion i or, if you will (which matters not here ) Softnefs and Divifi- bility. I promife my felf, that you will readily grant me this Requeft, which is, to go over again thofe ingenious and agreeable thoughts of yburs, that have been drawn out ot your Memories', and thofe many other Fragments of the fame force of Wit, that have been left behind, and generally all thofe other Poetical Tranfports and Raptures ot your Homer, Virgil, and Horace, which feem to have fomething of Divine in them. And you will not refufe in that ferenityof mind and Philofophical temper, wherein fometimes you are in the Morning, to make fome refledion upon four or five things, that feern to me to deferve very well the attention of a Philofopher. The firft is, 1 hat our Senfes are not only ftruck by Bodies fo, as the Eyes of a Statue or an Automaton) but that we feel their impreflion, the titillation and pain, and that even we perceive*5 Atoms and the Mind of Man. that we feel, when we fay, I perceive that this or that pleafeth my tafte much more or much lefs than ordinarily j that my pain ismuchlefsor much more than it was i and fo of an hundred things elfe. The fecond. That often we ftay not there, but deduce thefe particular Conclufions j We ought therefore to follow this v or we ought to ftmn that: And afterwards, thefe genera/ones * All what is good, is to be followed •, and all what is evil, is to be avoided. The third. That we remember whatispafled and confider what is prefent, and fore-fee what is to come. The fourth, That fometime- we endeavour to penetrate into our felves, into that which is inmoft in us, as I now do° when I am fearchmg what I am j what is this Reafoning power that is within me * what are theie thoughts i thefe ratiocinations, afid thefe reflexions I make refleXine thus upon my felf and my Operations. The fifth. That being refolutely (et to meditate upon a thing, we fometimes make new Difcoveries, find new Reafons, oratleaftfee thofe that have been found already, weighing them, and comparing one with another *nd fometimes drawing thence fuch Confequences, as (hall depend from a greater num ber of antecedent Pjropofitions, which may be feen as 3 twere in one view, and concur all to deduce fuch a Gonclufion &gt; as it comes to pafs in all Sciences, efpecially the Ma- thematicks *, wherein our Spirit (hews I know not what force and admirable extent. Thefe few refleXions might fuftice for what I demand of you * and that the rather becaufe as I can fay more comes almoft to the fame thing. But you muft refolve for once to endure the Style of thefe Countreys of Afia, the Air of which 1 have breathed fo long, and to have the patience further to caft your Eyes on a thing that feems to me very confiderable, which is, That we know not only particular things that make impreilion upon our Senfes, but that our Underfi:anding 5 by I know not what admirable force and ca pacity, taketh occafionto know and to form to it felf Ideasoi athoufand things, that fall not immediately and wholly as they are under the Senfes j for example, that Man isaReafcnable AnimaU that the Sun is much bigger than the whole Earth j that’tis impolfible, one thing fliould be at the fame time and not be &gt; that two things, being e- qual to a third, are equal among themfelves *, that the abfenceof the Sun caufeth the Night, that all what’s generated is fubjeX fo corruption * that of nothing nothing can be natuJ lally made i as not any thing that is, can naturally return to nothing j that of necef- fity there is fomething Eternal and Un-created in the Univerfe, God, or the firft Mat ter of things, or both, or that God created this Matter, and that either from all Eter nity or in Time: And an infinity more of other great and vaft thoughts, and remote from Matter, of which we fcarce know by what door they have entred into our Mind. - Now, all thefe aXions, I have been fpeaking of, that argue fo great a force and pow er, capacity and extent of the Mind of Man j all thofe intern Motions &gt; that peculiar State which we cannot perfeXly explain, but yet plainly feel and perceive in our felves, when we attentively refleX ©n what paffeth within us, and confider our operations i All tnofe AXions, I fay, ahd interiour Motions* or whatever you will call them, can they indeed to be aferibed to Spirits, to a Wind, to Fire* to Air, to Atoms, to Particles of a Subtil Matter, and, in a word, to any thing that hath no other Qualities or Propri eties than what can be comprized under this word, Body, how fmall and fine and nim ble foever it may be, into what texture ordifpofition foeverit maybe caft, and of what motions foe ver it may be m^de capable ? It cannot: we ftiall never be able to imagine that thefe things are meet Local Motions of fome Engine barely Artificial, dead, infenfi- blc, without Judgment, without Reafon: Thefe can never be any of thofe inward aXions I have mention’d, as, That I fee or know that I know * that I fee I reafon» that I fee thofe reafonings, and perceive that I fee them. Moreover, let us a little caft our Eyes upon fome of the main Propofitions of Euclid^ (not to fpeak of thofe of Archimedes, Apollonius, and fo many others j) For my part, when I think only on the ^jtb. of the ift. of Euclid, I there find fomethittg fo great and noble, that I avow to you, I can hardly believe that it was an Humane Invention: ho that I lliould imagine, that it was therefore that Pythagoras, after he had beenfo hap py as to find this incomparable Propofidon, was fo raviftied and tranfported, that he made that famous Sacrifice to thank the Gods, and had a mind to declare thereby, mat this Invention furpaffed the reach of an Humane Underftanding. Yet I would not therefore fay, that there is reafon to believe, that in Man there is a particle of Divinity, or fome fuch thing. This is an unreafonable Tenet of fome toicty, and of the Cabalijls ofPerfia, and of the Brachmans of India, who, toacknow- / X 2 &lt; lectaeAtoms and the Mind of Man, kdg,e openly the Nobknefs and Perfe&amp;ion of the Spirit of Man, chofe rather to caft thetnfdves into this extremity, than to believe it to be fo bafeand imperfect, as to be all Body and Matter. l am far from entertaining fuch a Sentiment j you will fee in the Letter to Mounfieur Cbapelain, that I cannot believe this to be an opinion defenfibleby a Fhilofopher : But this 1 do, I obferve in Man, as well as thofe Stoicks and others fomething fo perfedf, fo great and high, that #to opinion feems to me an hundred times lefs ahfurd, than that, which holds that in Man, and'even in the whole Univerfe there is nothing but Body, but bodily and local Motions, .but Atoms, but Matter. Lord! When 1 think on’t, who is that man, how little of good fenfe foever he may have, tuat can perfwade himfelf, that when an Archimedes, a Pythagoras, and others of thofe great men, had thofe effe&amp;s of the Mind, and were in their deep Meditations there was then nothing in their Heads and Brains but what was Corporeal, nothing but Vital and Animal Spirits, nothing but a certain Natural Heat, nothing but Particles of a very fubtil Matter, or nothing but Atoms, which, though they be Infenfible, and without all Underlhnding and Reafon, and do not fo much, ( according to the Do ctrine of the Atomills,) as move but by a fatal and blind motion and hit, ftiould yet come to move and concur fo luckily and wonderfully, that, as once by fuch a concourfe they had formed the Head of thofe Great men, fuch as it is with thofe innumerable Organs fo induftrioufly order’d and difpos’d*, fo alfo they flhould then be fo lucky as to form and produce thofe fubtil thoughts, and profound meditations i or rather that they (hould come to move themfelves in all thofe Organs info wonderful a manner, as at laft to fall into a certain Order and into a certain Difpolition andmarvellous, that they themfelves were that Conceiving, Seeing, Meditating, thofe admirable Pro- politions, and thofe Divine Inventions ? Add to this, when we find our felves, upon fome Affront, or other Difpleafure re ceived, ready to fall into Choler and Rage, and yet flop our Paflion j I pray, this in ternal Commander and Command, which we feel, this kind of Obedience, of modera tion and retreat, thatismade, for example, upon the account of fome confideration of Honefty, of Honour and Virtue, and again ft that natural Inclination we have to be re- venged i what is that inteiiour motion and ffate ? Can it be rationally faid, that 5 tis nothing but fome Rollings,. Counter-motions, Reflections, and peculiar conjunctions and textures of Atoms or Spirits, or of little Maffes or Particles of Matter, which are made within thofe Nerves, thofe fine Membranes, thofe very fubtil Channels and Or gans of the Brain, Heart, and other parts of the Body ? Thefe are pure Chimeras, A word more concerning Lztoj?: When in the apprehenfion of taking an ;//part for a good, we keep our felves in a poyfe, feeking within our felves all the reafons that are for and againf and ferioufly pondering and examining them i this apprehenfion, this refearch, this ballancing, and the refolution we at lafi take to do or not to do the thing i all that, all thofe motions, &amp;U that inward (fate and way of Being Cl fpeak in noother terms than they) fhall it be nothing but a fortuitous and blind concourfe of little Bodies? Is’t pofLibk that you can imagine or perfwade your felf this? torece himfelf, that fworn Partifan of the Epicurean Sedf, could not do it, norrefolve to attribute to Atoms alone thofe free motions of the Will, For if the Will, faith he, is drawn away from fatality,and raifed above Dctiiny,Et fatis avulfavoluntas,&amp;cc,]r[ow can he,with all his clinamen ordevi- ation of Principles, have believed in good earneft and without ferupk, that there is no thing but and nothing done in us, more than elfewherc, but by a natural, eternal, independent, immutable and inevitable concourfe of Atoms? He was not ignorant, that that being fo, neither the Will, nor any other thing whatfoever could be drawn and exempted from that concatenation and eternal and inmmutable Sequel of Motions and Cauifes&gt; that would follow and fucceed one another by eternal Orders abfolutely neceffary and unchangeable. Bcfides all this, I Could put you in mind of many Reafons that are wont to be al- ledged upon this Subjedv You know that great man, who hath colledfed more of tfrem than a fcore of very good ones. But that would be to abufe your Patience too much s and frefides Ifee not,thdt there is much more of any importance to be confidered hereupon, -than what I have lately reprefented unto you. I could alfo tell you, how I judge that all Objections, made upon this point, may be moil rationally anfwer’d v but I know, that you are not a perfon, for whom Books are to be made. I fhall only mention two things to that purpofe. Thesis, That Yis true what they fay, That Eating, Drinking, Health? NaturalAtom and the Mind of Man. _ | ^ li.i „ ■ r • . Heat, the Spirits, and a good Difpoiition of Organs, (all which are natural things, and astheyfpeak, depending from Atoms as Principles and the firft Matter) are things ne- celfary to all thofe Thoughts, Reafonings and Reftedtions 5 and, in a word, to all thofe Internal Operations I have mentioned. This is a thing that cannot be denied, and which every one doth too feniibly experiment not to aver it: But thence to conclude, that wh^tfoever intervenes and concurs to form thofe Operations, is only and meerly Body, f Atoms, Spirits, Subtil Matter, is that which, after the leaft Refle&amp;ion made upon their Excellency, and upon the, imperfection of Bodies or Atoms, or upon the littler£- femblance there is in their Qualities to Operations, can never with any goodfenfe be granted: So that,methinks the moft that might be allow’d, would be, that the Atoms, and Spirits, and all thofe other things alledged, are indeed neceffary as condi tions ordifpofitions, or the like, and not as the firft and abfolute Principles, and as the fotd caufe of the Operations i but that there is requifite fome other thing than all that, fomething nobler, higher, and more perfedi. The fecond thing is, That his true alfo, that we cannot form aright, or, as they fpeak, a next and pofidve Idea of what is above a Body or of any thing that is not Body : This, indeed, we cannot do, in my opinion, whilft we are in this mortal ftatefo ftridt- Jy united to the Body i the dependance of the Bodily Senfes, that fomuch confine and obfcure the light of our Underftanding, hinders us from it: But I fee not that thence it is to be concluded, that therefore there is really nothing Body, or Atoms, or Matter. For, how many things are there, of which we have no fuch pofitive Idea, which yet Reafon obligeth us to avow that they have a real Being ? Or rather, how- few things are there, of which we have any True Idea's ? Have thefe Philofophers themfelves any pofitive of their Atoms ? They acknowledge that their fmalnefs is fuch, that it cannot be fo much as imagin’d by hearing this word pronounc’d or explain’d: fo far are they from being capable to fall under our fenfes, and from im printing in us a true and pofitive Idea •&gt; and yet notwithftanding they believe, and conclude from Reafon, that they are. A Mathematician, hath he the pofitive Idea of the Magnitude of the Sun? Itisfo prodigious, and fo far remote from the capacity of the Senfes, that we are not able even fo much as to imagine it fuch as it is j arid yet for all this, there is none that is not fully perfwaded and convinced thereof by the-feree-of Demonftrations, and that knows not perfe&amp;ly, that he exceeds by far die bignefs of the Globe of the Earth. And befides, it is not true, that the nature of a thing may be known two manner ol ways *, either pojitively, as when it falls under fome one or more of our Senfes, or a§ when we give a pofitive Definition thereof^ or negatively, by faying what it is not: Now I (half grant, that we are not capable to know the Principle of our Operations or Ratiocinations by the firfi way, to fay what it is, and how thofe Operations are made and produced. Alas! we are not fo happy b we fhould need other Senfes far more perfedf than all thofe we have. We are not born to dive and Philofo- phizefo far: , ! .V \ lav i da pyxclufit fpeciem natura vide ad/. ' i ' ’’ ' ■; 5 ( r - : ' ' ' &lt;- ^ ■ - . - • r , But we ought alfo to acknowledge, that at leaf! we are capable to know it after the fecond way : So that, if we cannot fay truly and pofitively what it is, we can at leaft fay, and certainly know what it is not: I mean, that from the perfection of the Qpera** tions, which we do evidently fee to be fuch as that they have no proportion with all thofe proprieties and perfections of Atoms* and do univerfally furpafs the reach of what is meerly Body *, we can deduce a certain Gonclufion, that the Principle of fuch Operations, and thofe Operations themfelves mu ft needs be fomething above all that s Body or Corporeal. Which is here fufficient for me, who at the beginning engaged my felf no further, and pretend not, that we can make a true and pofitive of that Principle b but only that we can and ought to conclude by Ratiocination, that there rouft needs be fomething, as hath been faid, that is far more perfeCf and far more noble than all that is in the rank of Bodies, whatever its being or Nature may be. But ftiall l make an end, fully to difcover unto you my thought ? You well know, whether I am a perfon that taketh pleafure in vaunting, or in forging Untruths, or to fpeak things at random in a matter fo important as this. It cannot be denied,^ that there is a very great difference between the Operations of Brutes, and thofe admirable Operations of Man, of which we now treat: I fpeak not only in refpeCf of thofe of their outward .....I 54 Atoms and the Mind of Man. t utward feiates, butalfo in reference to thofe of their inward ones, or their Imagina* tion. AW that is fo much beneath the Reafoning of man, that we muft avow, there is / not any proportion, and that thofe of Man proceed from a very differing and infinitely more perfedt Principle. Notwithftanding all that (and this is the thought I would declare to yob) Ifhould think that perfon an hundred times lefsabfurd,^ that fhould go about to maintain, that in the Principle of thofe Operations of Brutes, whether it be of their internal or even their external Senfes, there were fomewhat more perfed than Corporeity and all that may be underftood and comprehended under the name of Body, or Matter, or Spirits’, than him, that fhould pretend the Principle of the Operations of Man were meerly Corporeal: So much do I take this Opinion to be out of all reafon, and unworthy of a man of good Judgment. Certainly it can be no ferious Philofo- phy i it can be nothing but an Excefs of Vanity, that hath caff thofe Philofophers, we have fpoken of, into fuch an irrational Extream. They doubtlefs faw, that their Sed had great Advantages above all the reft, in being able to explain with much Eafe and Probability abundance of the moft confiderable Efjfe&amp;s of Nature, only by Local Moti on, and the Order and particular Difpofition of their Matter, Corpufcles or Atoms: And thence they would make us believe, that by the fame Principles they could give an account of all, and explicate whatever concerns the Spirit of Man, and the Operations thereof. My Dear Friend, have not you and I concluded an hundred times, that how much foever we ftrain’d our Underftanding, we could never conceive, how from Infenfible Corpufcles there could ever refult any thing Senfible without the intervention of any thing but what’s infenfible *, and that with all their Atoms, how fmall and how nimble - foever they make them, what motions and figures fbever they give them, and in what order, mixture or difpofition they range them,(yea and whatever induftrious hand they affign them for guidance, they would never be able (ftill fuppofing with them, that they have no other proprieties or perfedfions than thofe recited) to make us imagine, how thence could refult a Compound, I fay not, that fhould be Keafoning like Man, but that fhould be meerly Senfitive, fuch as may be the vileft and the moft imperfedf Worm on Earth. How then dare they pretend, that they will make it out, how thence can refult a thing Imagining, a thing Reafoning, and fuch an one as fhall be the Imagina tions and Ratiocinations themfelves ? f For my part, ifyou’l believe me, let us lay afide all that prefumption and vanity of thofe Efprits forts » let us not pretend to be able to explicate the nature of the Princin pie of ourReafonings in the fame manner, as we might do the other things phat fall under our Senfes, and let us not play the Geometers upon it. We are not, as I have already faid, happy enough for that i ’tis a thing which cannot be done in this mortal Rate, and in this great depeiidance from the corporeal fenfes in which we ftand. Yet notwithftanding we ought to form a higher Ista* of our felves, and not to make our Soul to be of fuch bafe alloy, as thofe PHilofophers, too corporeal in this point, would have us do. We ought to believe for certain, that we are infinitely more noble and more perfedf than they make us, and refolutely maintain, that though we cannot ex actly know what we are, yet we know very well and very certainly, what we are not &gt; which is, that we are not altogether of Mire and Dirt, as they pretend.

Other Oblerva- tions I collected from the Tunquineji themfelves, with whom I have had ieveral Difcourles, during the time that I was at Batavia and Bantam , where they principally trade. And that which gave me the more light was this, That thofe Merchants feveral times bring along with them fome of their Bonnes or Priefts, as alfo fome of their Learned Men to teach their Children to Write and Read. For thefe Mer chants when they make a Voyage by Sea , carry all their Families along with them. And from thefo Bonze’s and other Learned Men I had feveral Obfervattons and Memoirs in Writing, as being defirous to be inform’d by me of the Government and Situation of our Frafice. And as I was ntver without in Atlcts and fome other particular Maps, they Were raviflvd with admiration i when I fihew’d them the Structure and Compofttre of the whole World, and the Situation of its foveral Kingdoms and Eftates. Therefore may the Reader with the more pleafiife and delight petufe thefo Relations ? when he has fo muehreafon to be perfiiaded that they are cordially done , and that they are made public by a perfon whofe fineerity has nodefign to abufe him. My Brother , who Was a perfon both cun ning and contagious, and one that lov'd to Travel as well as niy felf, having heard much talk in the Indies of the Grandeur of the Kingdom of Tunquin, refolv'd to go thither, and as he had a partieulat gift to learn a Language in a little time, he foon grew familiar with the Malaye, which is the Language of the Learned in thofe quarters of Afia, as Lathi is among Us in Europe: He underftood that Silk, Musk, and other Commodities of the like nature, were much cheaper there then in other places adjoyning , and that the People dealt with more fairnefoand honefty. Upon the encourage ment of which Information he prepar'd a Ship, and nude Jus Voyages with good feccefs. He always earn'd with him a good Sum of Money • and more then that,he ftor'd himfolf with a confide table number Of fmalt Cnriofitiesv tO prelent the King and his Nobility, tccording to the general Cuffom of alf the Eaftern Countries: -Thus footir piftar bin; King!

Thus he came to be well receiv’d the firft time that he fet foot in the Country 5 fo that the Cuftomer being by him oblig d with a fmall Clock, a pair of fmall Piftols, and two Pictures, which Were the Pictures of two Curtefaijs, imme diately gave notice to the King of his arrival. Thereupon having order to attend the Court, and coming to kils the King’s hands, the whole Afiembly was lurpris’d to hear a Stranger, born in a Country fo far diftant, fpeak the Malaye Language fo fluently. The King gave him a favourable reception, and kindly receiv’d the Prefent which he brought along with him. It was a very noble Sword, of which the Handle and Hilt were all over enchac’d with Rubies and Emraulds, with a Backfword Blade. To this he added a pair of Piftols, adorn’d and inlaid with Silver, S. ’Perfian Saddle and Bridle, embroider’d with Gold and Silver , a Bow and Quiver full of Arrows, and fix Pictures, like thole Which he had given the Cuftomer. Thele things highly pleas’d the King, who prelently drew forth the Sword out of the Scabbard, the better to look upon and confider it. At length one of his Sons took it up , to try whether it would fit his hand as well as thole of his own Country, and offer’d to make a blow. My Brother, feeing the young Prince handle the Weapon gracefully enough , after the manner of the Country , told the King , that if he pleas’d, he would i'how the King how they handled that Weapon in France , of which the King readily confented to be a SpectatoiW. This was my Brother’s firft Reception at Court ; for he made feveral Voyages to Tunquin , and every time that he return’d, they ftill the more and more obligingly entertain’d him But that which fix’d him more in the good opinion and favour of the King and Lords of the Court, was his frolic and gentile behaviour in playing with them for feveral large Sums, infomuch that being one that ventur’d deep, he loft above ioooo Crowns in one Voyage. However the King, who was a generous Prince, would not fuffer him to be a loler , but gave him thole confiderable Prelents that luppli d his Ioffes. By means of my Brother’s: thus long fojourning in Tmiquin , and the familiar acquaintance which he had at Court, together with the Trade which he drove in the Kingdom, as he was diligent to inform himfelf of all the Curiofities of the Country , it was eafle for me upon B a the'H A P&lt; A New and Varticular Relation of the tke fame foundation to lay the Structure of thefe Memoirs. Thought may fafely fay, I was no lefs laborious in my own particular, and by the frequent Difcourfes which I had with a great number of the Tunquinefes, with whom I met both at Bantam and Batavia that came thither to Trade, and whom I often treated at my own Expences, to inform my felf of the particular Ceremonies and Cuftoms of their Country. Thus you fee the Grounds and Foundations of this Rela tion , which is both faithful and exact, and by which that noble Country, of which the Deferiptions hitherto have been fo obfcure and uncertain, (hall be truly difcovef d and let forth, fuchasitis ; declaring withal, that no other Con- fideration or Intereft, then that of fpeaking truth, has incited me to undertake this Defcription. For the better obfervation of a right Method in puriiiance of this Relation, and to conduct the Reader graiatim to the more perfedt knowledge of this Kingdom, I will fpeak firft of its Situation, its Extent, and its Climate. Next I fhallcome todifcourfe of its Qualities, its Riches, audits Trade, which are the three Springs and Sources of the Strength and Force of a Nation. Next I fhall give an Ac count of the Cuftoms and Manners of the People as well in their particular OEconomy and Civil Society, as in relation to their Marriages, their Vifits and Feftivals. Next to this We fhall give a brief Account of the Learning, and learned Men, and among them of their Phyficians, and theSubjed of their Art, that is to fay, of the Difeafes particular to the Country. We fhall alfo give a Relation of the Original of the Government and Policy of the Kingdom of Tunquin, of the Condition of the Court, of the Inauguration and Fune rals of their Kings, and in the laft place of the Original of the Inhabitants. And I dare ingage, that the Map of the Country, and the Cuts which were drawn upon the place, will no Ids contri bute to the Divertifement of the Reader, then to the Expla nation of the Matter which they contain.L- ■i Kingdom of T u n Q- u i n. CHAP. II. •; J -f t , * jj, “ | . Of the Situation and Extent of the Kingdom uiri. J O E {hall have the left reafbn to admire where fore our Predeceflbrs had io little knowledge of this Kingdom, when we confider that: having formerly been a coniidcrable part of China, the In habitants in the fame manner as the Chimfes did, kept them- felves dole within their own bounds, never minding to have any Commerce with other People , whom they con temn’d and lookt upon as 'Barbarians come from the other part of the World But now that they -find that Strangers come to find them out in their own Territories, they begin to fee that other People have as good Government as them- felves ; which has bred in them a delire to Converle and Trade with Foreigners ; lb that now they affociate them- felves in friendly manner with all other People, as 1 have obferv’d them to do both at BataYut and Bantam. Mod people believe this Country to lye in a very hot Climate - neverthelefs it is now known to be very temperate, by reafon of the great number of Rivers that water it ; which, together with the Rains that fall in their Sealons, caule a bask frefhnefs of the Air - which indeed happ’ns mod ufuaily over all the Torrid-tyn* 5 as * have obferv’d in my Indian Travels .From whence we may alfo have reafon to believe the Country to be very fruitful and thick inha bited. » - V : ; To the Eaft this Kingdom lies upon the Province Of Can ton, oneol the beft of China. To the Weft it is bounded by the Kingdom of Brdma. To the North it borders upon two other Provinces of ( hina, Jmnan and Quanfi. To the South it lies upon Coclnnchinaj and the great Guiph of the fame name.' ^ To return to the Climate , the Air is fo mild and tem perate , that all the year long leems to be but one continual Spring • Froft and Snow are never there to be leen; andbefides, the Peftilence , the Gout, the Stone ■ and other Difeafes fo frequent in &amp;ro/?e 5 there are never known. There are but two Winds, which divide the whole Year between them - the one blowing from the North , the other from the South, and both continuing the fahie for fit months together. The firft refrefhes the Earth in that manner, that there is nothing fo delightful as the Country of Tunquin. The Other begins to blow from the end of January to the end of July ; and the two laft months are their months of rain. The greateft inconvenience is 6 that there arife once in leaven years , as well in this Country as in other parts of the Indies , thofe hideous and terrible Tempefts , that blow down Houfes i tear up Trees by the roots, and make ftrange Defolations. They feldont laft above four and twenty hours, nor are their lad Effects to be felt but only upon the Seas of China , Japan , Cochin- china , Tunquiny and the Manilles ? being rarely known in any other Seas. The Aftrologers of thole parts believe that thefe terrible Tempefts proceed from the Exhalations that rife out of the Mines of Japon. It comes with that fuddain force that when it furprizes a Veflel out at Sea, the Pilots have no other remedy then to cut down all the Mafts ? that the ftorm may have the lefs force upon the Ship. In this fair extent of Land, almoft: equal to that of France, are leveral Provinces, wholelimmits are not well known; the Tunquinefes being no great Geographers, nor having bin over curious to write the Annals of the Nation. But the moft: underftanding and knowing among them affur d me at Batavia , that the whole Kingdom contain'd above twenty thoufand Cities and Towns. They alfo affirm’d that there might be many more, but after the manner of their Neigh bours the Coc/?mc/;me/er, many of the People choole rather to upon the Water then upon the Land ; fo that you fihall fee live the greateft: part of their Rivers coverd with Boates, which lerve them inftead of Houles; and which are very neat ? though they alfo keep their Cartel in them.

It is water’d by feveral Rivers which inter-gut and glide through the Country: J~ome of wh-Ach carry ■Galleys of goodibiirtheri ? and large Shallops, very rcormpodibps for .trade. Yet in all .the Country .there grow T s neither Corn nor Wine, by reafon of the want of rain, yyhich never falls but in the Months of fane pudJyly. But it benas an infinite quantity of Rice , ^hieh is the chief fufbrnaoce of the People. Of this Rice,affpithey make theirOirink, befides jyhich they have good ApaViU or Sttong-ayater. Their Fruits are excellent, but much different from burs, as are alio the Trees that.be,ar thern. The qhiefe.ft of thofe Trefes are the Palm-tree, Which bears a Fruit biggei thenin any part oi J fid. The Nut is about the bignels of a Map’s Head; in ffiape like a Coco-nut 5 the Shell is very hard , and-being openld, the Pulp withip is as white as Snow, having a taft like Our Almonds, and every one of the Fruits contains about two glafsfuls of Liquor, very refrciliing and pleafing to the Palate. The GogaVier, very .much refemples our Lawrel, of which there are two forts; the o'pe [bears a ! Plum, green without and red within : but the Fruit of the other Tree, which is in much more efteerri, is yellowifll without and w hite within, the top of the Fruit being like a final 1 . Nofegay : the Pul|&gt; is full of fmall Kernels, lefs then thole of a Pomegranate •• and if they be eaten before they are ripe they bind the belly , whereas being eaten when 1 they are come to full maturity they work a contrary effect. Formerly this Fruit was not known m'the Kingdofti of Tun- quin, but after the (Portugals lea ted themfelves at Maoio, they carri’d feveral Plants thither, fo that now the Fruit is grown’ very cpmtaon. The Tapager bears a Fruit which very much refembles a fifratl Melon, the tall whereof is vety delicibus. The .L-rfJcr grows upright .and .{freight,' .like the.Maftof a8 A New and Particular Relation of the Ship ^ bearing no Branches but at the top 3 which makes it appear like a Crown. The Fruit which it produces is like a Nutmeg, but a little more round. The People break this Nut, and bruifing it together with Betle leaves^mix both with a little Chalk, and make ufe of the Powder to keep their Teeth clean, to dye their Lips of a Vermilion colour, and to keep their Breath Iweet. They have but two forts of Figs , the one like ours, and the other like thole which are call'd Adam's Figs, as long as a Man's finger. . There is alfo another Tree, Very like otit Jfillow, which they call the Toivder Tree , becaule that of the Wood they make Charcoal, and of the Coal a Powder which they make ufe of in their Wars. The Jambager is another Tree, that grows Very high, which bears a Fruit about the bignefs of a Citml-Cucum- ber, the Pulp whereof is full of Kernels like a Granate, very cooling and pleafant, and very frequently eaten in the Seafdn of heat. The High-ways are alfo planted with Trees on both lides for the convenience of Travellers: And there are Lome of thefe Trees fo big that two or three thoufand men may ftand under them , like that at , or Bandar Abaffi y by me dele rib d in my Relations of Terjta , and of which many other Travellers have made mention. When the Branches of thefe Trees are about ten or twelve foot long, there iffue forth other little Branches which turn downward, and by little and little defeending to the ground, take root and afterwards become as it were fo many Pillars to fupportthe -Branches. There are feme of the Mafler-Bxmches three hundred Paces long, which are lupported by thefe out growing Branches at the diftance of every ten or twelve foot. The Fruit is of the bignefs of one of our great Nuts, the Shell whereof is red, containing within nothing but a Kernel like a grain of Millet. The Rere Mice feed upon 'em, and alfo make their Nefts in the trees. Thefe Rere-mice are as big as a good Pullet, infomuch that their Wings are above a foot and a half long. They -never light upon the tree like other Birds, but you fhall fee them all the day long hanging at the branches of the trees, faflen'd by their Claws to the tree with their heads downward. Upon every Wing v,,, : they/: j 9 they have Seven as it Were little Hooks or Claws, fo that being ffiot, they never fall to the ground, blit temain fixed to the branches,that at a diftance you Would take thern to be iome great Pears that hung upon the tree. They are ac counted a gteat dainty among the P ortu^dh y who leave their Pullets to eat them. Tis true that their Flefli is very white, and when they are young they are a delicate fort of Diet! 1 happen’d to eat or them two or three times with the Per- ttw-ds, -who thought they had oblig’d me with a great dainty and had I not known what they were, I Ihould have taken them for Pullets. And now lam talking of the Delicacies of the Country, I will tell you of one fort of Dyec which is very Angular. This Food is the Meft of a certain Bird which is no where to be found , but in the four Mauds that he upon the Coaft of Cochtnchina, and of Which you have the Figures in the Table J. ©, Thefe Birds are about the bigneis of a Swallow , and build their Nefts in Inch a manner, that they are neither too clofe compa&amp;ed, nor alto gether transparent; they are like an Onion compos’d of feveral rings and envelopings ; that compoSe a Neft of a cer tain Sort of Gm'rin ,which is fteep’d in warm water,and mix’d with all the Sawces which are made both for Fiili and Flefli. It is tranfported all over India and into Holland for Guviofitie’s Sake. You would believe in eating thofe Meats which are fealon’d therewith, that thoie Nefts were compos’d of all the Spices in the Orient. 1 havfe not only brought this Diet into France, and prefented of it to leveral Perfons of Quality, but 1 have alio my Vouchers for the truth of what I relate, ieveral of my Friends who have brought it from Holland, among the reft M. de Vilkrmoiit, whole Name is famous for his Travels into the Eafl-Indies .He and all thoie that have eat thereof agree with me, that all the Spices of the Eaft put together , do not give that effectual relifh and favour as thele Nefts do , to the Meats and Difhes wherein they'' are us’d. Near to thefe four lilands, where thefe Birds Nefts are found, are five others mark’d in the Map i, z, z,, 4, in thele five iflands are fuch infinite number and ®£h excellent Food, that the Tunquinejes and Coclimchinefes do R ot believe they have entertain’d their Friends at a Banquet as they ought to do, till the Tortoifes are brought in. Thoie’ C two/ IO A New and Particular Relation of the two Nations pickle up great quantities of them, and fend them abroad, which is a vaft trade among them • and indeed the chiefeft occalion of the Wars between them is, becaufe the Cochinchinefes do all they can to hinder the Tunquinefes to fifh for them , alledging that thofe Seas and Iflands belong to them. Neither is the Meat but the Shell alfo of great efteem, and one ot the great eft Commodities for Trade ni Jfia. Tunquin alfo affords great ftore of Ananas and Orange trees, of which there are of two forts : the one that bears a Fruit no bigger then an Abricot • the other bigger then thole of Portugal: both alike in taft, and being to be gather'd from the tree for fix months together. They have alfo two forts of Citrons, the one yellow, the other green • but both the one and the other fo tart and fowhr, that they cannot be eaten without offence to the Stomach. Neverthelefs, the Juyce is made life of as we do here of Aquafortis, to cleanfe Copper, Tin, and Iron, before we gild thofe Metals, as alfo for Tinctures 1 , efpecially thofe of Silk. They are alfo made ufe of for Lyes to whiten Linnen , and to take out Spots* Through all the Territories of the Great Mogul they make ufe of this Juyce of Citrons to whiten their Calicuts; whereby they make them fometimes fo white that they dazle the fight. They make great quantities of Silk in the Kingdom of Tmquin , of which both rich and poor make themfelves Garments. The Hollanders, who thruft themfelves in every where, where there is any hope of gain, carry off fucha quantity every year, that it is now become the chiefeft part of that Commodity which they carry to Japon • whereas before they fetch’d their Commodities from Perjta, (Bengda, or China. As for iweet (melding Flowh's, the Tunquimfes have but one fort, which they call the Flow'r of Bague. It grows like a large Nolegay, and the Branches of the Shrub that bear it, fpread themlelves crawlingly upon the ground. As they have great ftore of Sugar, fo they eat very much, while it is yet in the Cane, not having the true Art to refine it: and that which they do grofiy refine, they make into little Loaves weighing about half a pound. They eat very much, making ufe of it always after Meals to help digeftion.

Theft Elephants are of a prodigious bighfcfs, neither are there any fo tall nor fb nimble in any part of j for they will bow thernftlves, and ftoop fo low , that you may get upon their bafcks without help. They have no Cats, but they have Dogs that ftrve for the fame purpofe, and will watch all night to kill the Rats and Mice , which affe i'ery large and very troublefbm. Very few Birds are to be ften in the Air ; Which toward the evening grows duskifh, by realon of thofe vaft number ©f Ghats that gef into the Hcufes in the night time and hinder people from fleeping, not only by the nolle Which they make, but With their con tinual flinging ; which is one of the greafeft inconveniencies of the Country^ For remedy whereof in fome meafure, an hour before they go to fleep they take the HUsk or Chaff of the Rice,which flies from the Rice when it is beaten, and drew it upon a fmall Fire in a Fire-fhoVel,and fb let it Irtioak', and by that means they kill or drive thole Flies away. Bo lides this, they cover the Bed with a Pavilion br Tent that trails upon the ground, made like a Net With very fmall holes to let in the Air. But notwithftanding all the pre vention can be us'd, they will be about a man when he rifts f the morning. But there is yet a far greater inconvenience in this Country, which proceeds from the infinite numbers of white Emmets, which though rfiey are but little, have teeth' fofharp , that they Will eat down a wooden Poft in a Ihort time. And if great care be not taken in the places where you lock up your Bales of Silk , in four and twenty hoVirs they will eat through a Bale,as if it had been laW’d in two in the middle. Several of them have fallen.from' the Ciel- rng into my Neck , where they rais’d Blifters upon the Skin, which piefently fall again being wafli’d with cold Water.A Netp and Particular Relation of the I have told ydu shat Hens and Ducks arc infinitely nufrie- rous in Tmquiu * I will now tell you how they prefefve the Egg s of thefe Creatures^which they Will keep for two or three years together without being fpoil’d. They fait them, and to make them take fait, they fill a-Veffel full of Water, and throw a good quantity of Salt into it. If the Egg fink to the bottom, the Pickle is not goodrj then they throw in more Salt, till they find that the Eggs Iwim. T he Pickle being thus made, they take Allies , and make them up into a Paft With this Pickle : and in this Pafl they enclofe every Bgg by it felf, and then wrap it up in a leaf of an Herb, riot unlike one of our Pear-tree leaves, but much larger, and then put the Eggs into Earthen Pots clofe coter'd : after which manner they keep their Eggs for two or three years together. In other parts of the Indies where there is great ftore of Oyl, as in the Dominions of the Great Mogul, the Kingdoms of and Arochan, they put their Eggs into great Earthen Pots well varniftfid, and then fill the Velfel with an Oyl Which is made of a fmall Seed like Rape-feed. Fofas for $allad Oyl, after you are once pafifd Aleppo^ you fee no more Olive-trees over all but only in one place of tyerfia near Cochin, where between tke Mountains lies a little Valley about a League long and half a League broad, full of Olive- trees , but they make but very little Oyl, preferving the Olives only to eat. But to return to the Eggs • they are the chief Provifion which they eat a Ship-board. But the Eggs which are preferv'd in Salt are preferred much before thole that are kept in Oyl | becaufe that in tiling the firft, there is no need of carrying Salt to Sea, or of boiling Salt with their Rice* When they eat them , they boil them till they are hard, and with every mouthful of Rice they eat a Pea’s bignefs of Egg, which is as good and better then Salt with their Rice. As to what remains, there are neither Mines of Oold nor Silver in the Kingdom of Tunquin , neither do they Coin any Money. tkPoi ling! ®M i fa i^oifer ‘ilk tee o' tijoi lti$ I itPec k t Idinf V feol V , G H A P- n(injjdoi itEattiti i an 0(1 'apta : Vailej, )f Olive' vitigtli Eyiiei ioretw \ tkti pitlitii* tkyi* lafrii Saltw^, of !AP Of the Kterns „ Trade t m of tTuflawirii i; h !i jj»rij H E chief Richei of the Cdtitifrj? of 'tiimpUtt cdnfift Ini the great {^taantity of Silks which they fell to thfe r Hollahikts, arid Other Fcreigriers, &amp;ttd irt theif num Aloes.

If the Wood be oily, the bignefs of a Pea will lerve to throw upon the fire , which being a little inoiften’din Water, will yield as much fmoak as a dry piece as big as a Man’s fill. Which is the reafon, that if it be oily and good it Wants no price. One of the chief Prcfents. as I have obferv’d in another part of this Book, which the &lt; Portugals of Goa Cent to the Emperor of Japan, was a' piece of Lignum Aloes, fix foot long, and two round. It coft 40000 'Tardo's Or 54000 Litres. Ids fo much the morepleafure and profit to trade with the People of Tmqmn , by how much the more faithful and frank they are in their dealing then the Chirtcfcs, Who will deceive you if they can ; fo that it is a hard thing to be too’ ttfttoing for them, as I have often found by experience. When you have fold them any Commodity, and they find that their Bargain is not very advantageous , their general way of getting' Off is this : As they have generally three forts of Reals, One fort that is full weight, others which are %ht, four, others eight per Cent, if they have no friind to : ®*“ 1 m their bargain, they offer to’pay yob ^ r5?wfefe 'in light Reals, which they have dipt themfelves • and fo you are deceiv’d. There are no Inch People for Trade iri the World : they refufe to deal in nothing 5 even in old Shoes, and if you will fell them but one of them too, they! buy it, Without ever enquiring why you will nbt fell the other. But for thofe of Tutiquin they are ttiore blunt and plain in their dealing, fo that it is a pleafure to have to deal with them. I have told you, there are neither Mines of Gold dr Silver in Tunquin , neither do they Coin Money there. So that in Trade they make ufe of certain Lingots of Gold, as they are brought out of China, fome of which amount to 300 Livres of our Money, others to fix hin der'd. They alfo make ufe of Bars of Silver as they are brought from Japoh. As for finall Payments they either cut the large Bars into rntall pieces, to which purpofe they have their Scales, like our Stelleers • or elfe they pay in Foreign Coin, which are the Reals of Spain generally. This Gold and Silver is brought from China, and Japan, in lieu of thole vaft quantities of Silk which are exported out of the Country , which with Musk and Lignum Aloes are the chief Riches of the Kingdom. . . ■ , ..j* , -—i ? . .• , ', :. r ■ CHAP.

Place thif next to. The King of T'urupum fetting out for the War —Kingdom of T u n cl u i n, jaw in the year 1649, when the King was preparing to make War againft the King of Cochmcbmd, for certain Ships which the Locbmcbinefes had taken from the Tmiqumejes : though the Quarrel was taken up by certain Embaffadors which the King of Cochincbina jent to the King of Tunquin, to whom the former made fatisfadlion. The Army that was then prepar'd to march upon this Expedition was compos'd of 8000 Horle 3 94 thoufand Foot, and 722 Elephants; 13 o for the War 5 and the reft to carry the Tents and Baggage of the King and the Nobility; and 318 Galleys and Barks, very long and narrow, with Oars and Sails and this was that which my Brother law. The Con dition of the Souldiery is very toillom and laborious, and of little advantage in the Kingdom of Tunquin. For they are all their life time fo ti'd and engag'd to the Service of the Wars, that though they are capable of other Labours for the lupport of their Families, they are not permitted td undertake it. Thofe days that they are not upon the Guard, they are oblig'd to attend their Captains where-ever they go, and two days in a week they are compeli'd to Exercife with their Bows and Arrows in their prelence. Their Com panies confift of a hundred or a hundred and thirty Men, and they of each Company that have made the beft (hoc, have one of them two Months Wages, the other one, which is paid them in Rice. He that makes the worft fhot, next time he mounts the Guard , is oblig’d to ftand Centinel double his time. All the Captains look upon it as a great piece of glory to have their Souldiers Arms and Weapons neat and bright. If they find any ruft upon them, they fconce them eight days Wages for the firft fault, and for the fecond they are very feverely chaftis'd. As for thofe that ferve in the Galleys, they are entertain'd and lifted propor- tionably. And fometimes the Captains fend their Souldiers 1 aboard for feme days, that they may learn to row. For it is one of thechiefeft Paftimes of the Kings of Tunquin to (ee the Mock-fights of the Galleys. W hen he has a mind to delight himlelf with this Divertilment, the King, with feme part of his Court, removes to one of his fair Palaces, that ftands upon one of the largeft Rivers in his Country ; and it is a great Honour for any ot the Captains whofe Souldiers if carry the Victory. Now as the Victory is only got by the forceforce of the Oars, it happens fometimes that there are fome Souidiers who ftrain themfelves fo hard, that they fall down dead with the Oar in their hands: for the King is the only Judge of thfe Combat. Wherein the pleafure that he takes is inch, that he fends an Elephant to the Captain that obtains the Victory, and gives him three Months Wages belides. If any Souldier chance to die in this Exerciie, his Widow or his Heirs have two years Pay, But notwithftanding all their pain and labour, their Wages are fo fmall, that they are not able to maintain their Wives and Children. But in regard they Marry very young in this Country , the Wives as well of the Souidiers as of all the meaner fort of people, take care to learn fome .'Trade befides, that they may be able to maintain their Families. The Captains alfo have their work prepar'd for them. For they are oblig'd to look after the King's Elephants, and to manage them for the Wars, and fo to breed them, that they may not be afraid of Wild-fire, or any other Artificial Fires : as alfo to build places all along the Rivers, for the Galleys to ride flicker'd in, when they can no longer live out at Sea.

' V I T f • A I ■' CHAP. VI. Of the Manners and Cutfoms of the People of the Kingdom of Tunquin. He People of Tunquin are naturally mild and peace ful, fubmitting eafily to reafon, and condemning the Tranlports of Choler. They efteem the Ma nufactures of ftrange Countries far beyond thole ol their own ; though they are not very curious of feeing any other Countries butehofe where they were born ^ and where, as they fay, they always deiire to live, to honour the Memory of their Anceftors. They have a tone in fpeaking , natu-■«»i«w«iiM»«iunaaBPOi rally foft and pleating ; happy memdrieSj and in their Lan guage, which is very florid, they uie feveral appolite Com panions. 1 hey have good Poets among them, and People that love Learning ; in which relpedt they are no way infe- riour to the Chine/es, their Neighbours. 'The Tuitquiiiefes, as Well Men as Women, are for the moft part well proportion'd, of an Olive Complexion, very much admiring the whitenefs of the Europeans. Their Notes and Faces are not lo flat as thole of the as being generally better made. Their Hair is very black , which they ufually wear as long as it will grow, being very care ful in combing it. The Common People plait it in treifes, and tie it like a great Roll upon the top of their Heads. But the Nobility , Men of Law, and Souldiers j tie their Locks about their Necks, that they may not flutter in their Faces. They do not believe their Teeth to be handfom, till they have made them as black as jet 5 and they fuffer their Nails to grow ; the longeft being accounted the fairelf. Their Habit is grave and modeft, being a long Robe that reaehei down to their heels, much like that of the without any diftindtion of Sex. This Habit is bound about at the waft with a Girdle of Silk, interwoven with Gold and Silver, the Workmanfhip whereof is alike On both fides. As for the Souldiers, their upper Garments reach no farther then their Knees ; only their Breeches reach downtO the mid Leg, without either Hole or Shoes. The vulger fort of People are altogether Haves for one part Of the year. For unlefs they be the Citizens Of the Capital City, where the King keeps his Court, all the other Handicrafts of what Trade loever, as Joyners, Carpenters, Lockfmitlis, Mafons, and the like, are oblig’d evety year to Work three Months at the King’s Palace ; and two Months, Or Moons more (For the Tunquinefes reckon their Months by the Moon) for the Mandarins, or great Lords. The reft of the year is for themfelves, all which 'time they have liberty to work for the lupport of their own Fahiily. This Service in their Language is call d Viccipian , or tne Condition of d Starve. But they are liable to other drudgeries worfe then thole before mention’d ; as to lop Trees, with which they chiefly feed their Elephants. This is a fevere days work, to Which they were condemn’d by the great Grandfather of D18 A New and Farticular Relation of the the King that now reigns, after he had put an end to the Civil Wars that turmoil’d his Kingdom, and that he had brought his rebellious Subjedts to fubmit themfelves. They had occafion'd him a great deal of trouble, and in regard he could not fubdue them without a great hazard of his Army, his Council advis'd him to famifh them ; but he ra* ther chofe to give them their Lives, and to condemn them and their Polterity to this laborious Service, of which he might in time reap the benefit. 1 have told you elfewhere that the Tunquinefes take great delight to live upon the Rivers, which are there free from Crocodiles and all other dangerous Animals , which haunt the Waters of Nde and Ganges. Where we are to obferve, that thefe Rivers overflow their Banks every year, after the Rains are fall'n, with that terrible violence^ that many times they carry away whole Towns and Villages, at what time a good part of the Kingdom looks like a Sea, refembling the lower Egypt urider Water upon the Inundation of Nik C H A R VI L Of the Marriages of the Tunquinefes, and their fe verity toward Adulter ejfes. H E Tmquinefes cannot Marry without the confent of the Father and Mother, or if they be dead, with- JH out the allowance of their neareft Kindred. They muft alfo have the permiflionof the Judge or Governour of the place where the Marriage is to be made, for the obtain* ing of which they muft give him feme Prefent. But in regard they were wont to exaft upon the poor people more then they were able to give them , fo that many Marriages were difappointed, to the great damage of the Public • the King, who reign'd in the year 1639, being inform'd of thele Extor* tions, and their ill Confecpences, ftt forth a Law to regu late thole Abufts, and to curb the Authority of the Gover- nours. He order'd that the young Man who was defirous to Marry , fhould pay no more then fuch a Sum, according to 0 unfa total; tfctt fta A]'S;I Bent I# l ffii tit it Mi ifif tic ^tfft I'tojjilj; !t M| “'ti!

Now in regard the Common People, both Men and Women, are naturally laborious, all chat the Maids can get they preferve for their Portions, and to buy them :Wo or three handfom Garments, with a Neck-lace ol Coral or yellow Afnber, and a Certain number of Beads, to garniih their Locks ; which they fuffer todiang down upon their Backs ■ accounting the beauty of their Harr to coniift in the length. There is no Wedding kept without a great Feaft - artd they mutt be very poor when the Feaft- lafts not above three days • ■ for fomefimes they junket for nine days together. The next day after the Wedding the Bridgroom calls the Bride his Sifter, and Hie calls the Bridegroom Brother. The Law of the Land permits the Man to divorce his Wife when lie pleafes, which they do many times for very flight caufes. But the Woman has not the fame Priviledge: oracleaft, if flic defire a fepafrartiotf, it is much more difficult to obtain; and the occafion mr'ift be very notorious.' The coifs lyiti- Tlii aouti okiii' Bf® icfis '£jif :of Got® it fey that this Law 1 y/as made to keep the Women in fub- ieci;iott,and to oblige them to be refpeiflful to their Husbands. When the Husband defires this feparatiori, the Ceremony is this. You muft know* that many of the Eaftern People never touch theft Widtuals with theft hands, but make ule of two' little fticks about fix inches long, gilt andvarnifh’d; Which lerve them inftead of Forks. The Husband then, when he goes about to repudiate his-Wife, takes one of his owm-flacks; and-one ofhisWife''s, and living broken them, they take eachfonfe half, and tow it up in a piece of Silk, irt which they keep-it. Then the Man is bound to reilore the Woman what fhe brOtight with her, and to keep the Chil dren which thdy had' between them.- But thefe Divorces are noi! half fofifcjuent as formerly; : - The Laws are abb very rigorous againft Aduirereflfes. So that if a womiffiaCcUsYl 1 of this etime be COUvidfod thereof, fheis'eaft to an Elephant bred upto this purpole, who pre- feritly throws her Up into the Air with his Trunk, and when fhe comes to the ground, tramples her under liis-foet, till he can perceive no life in her.

It is the Cuftom in the Eciji, when a Prince dies, to fiuit up inthemoft private and retir'd part of all his Palace all the women which he made ufe of in his life time. There they are allow'd two Maids to attend them, they eat alone, and fee no perfon living any more to the very day of their deaths. I cannot tell by what means one of the Princes of the blood had got a view of one of the deceafed King his Uncle's wives ; but being defirous to fee her again, and to overcome all difficulties that oppos'd him, and to deceive the Guards that watch'd the Dores,he made ufe of a flight not eafily dif- cover'd. For you mull know, that in the Kingdom Tunquin, as in all the Kingdoms of Jfia, in the Houfes of the Kings and other great Lords, the Kitchin is ulually feparated from theHoufe, and that the Garden is between them 3 fo that for the better carrying the Meat from one place to another, the Servants make ufe of a kind of Flasket, or rather Iron Cheft. And to keep the Meat warm, the Difhes arefup- ported by little flicks laid athwart, about an inch diftant one from another, under vyhich is an Iron Plate with holes pierc'd quite through, about half a foot above another, which makes the bottom of the Cheft 5 between which Plates they put lighted Coals, to keep the Meat warm. Thefe Chefts being to be carri'd by two men, the Tunquinefe Prince plaid his game fo well, that he was put into one of thefe Chefts wherein the Princefles Meat was wont to be carri'd up into her Apartment. But he was not there many days before the thing was difcover'd. He was prefently brought before the King, who caus'd him to have feveral weighty Chains to be put about his Neck and Waft, and upon his Hands and Leggs 3 and thus chain'd and manacled, he order'd him to be led about for five Months together, to be feen by the People. After that he was fhut up in a clofe Pnfon , where he remain'd feven years, till the death of the King , whofe Son coming to the Throne, let him at liberty, upon condition hefhould ferve as a private Souldier upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom. As for the Princefs fhe was fhut up in a little Chamber upon the top of a Towr, where fhe remain’d twelve days without having any thing given her to eat or drink 3 after that the Chamber was' I r i kh' . 1 31 -i Kingdom of T u n o_u i U.

The two Maids that ferv’d her had a little more favour, for they were thrown to the Elephants, who prefently trod them to death. The two Porters of the Cheft, or Flaskets were tfd to four imall Galleys, by the two Hands, and two Leggs, and as they Row'd feveral ways were pre fently difmembred.

Generally they make their Vifits about Noon, in the hotted cime of the day ^ and then every one walks with a Train fuitable to his Condition. The Princes and Mandarines ride upon their Elephants- or elfe they are earn’d in a kind of Litter i where they may either fit or lie. Six Men carry it, and behind them follow fix more to eafe them by times. Their Train confifts generally of fifty or fixty Perfons • neither are they permitted to exceed that number; As for the ordinary Gentry^ and Officers of the Court, they ride a Horle-back, not being allowed above (even or eight Servants to attend them. They chew Bede continually, as all the other Afiaticks do in fiich places where it is to be had: And when, any one comes to vifit another, it would be taken for a great affront, if at his taking leave, he fhotild not be prefented with a Box of Bede, to take what he pleasd. The richer that Box is, the more Honour is given to the Perfon to whom the Bede is prelented : Infomuch that when a Prince is about to be marrfd, he ufually lends three of thefe Boxes to his Spoufe, of winch I have leen fome at 21 \§ u j Fi; J ! ; | iu ijirl i W22 A Neiv and Particular Relation of the the Apartments of fome of the Princes that came to the Court of the Great Mogtd, which were worth above 4 or 500000 Livres 1 One ihall be cover'd with Diamonds ano ther with Rubies and Pearls, another with Emraulds and Pearls, or elle with other Jewels. The Tunquinefes take it for a. great difhonour to have their Heads bare, which is only far Criminals, whom they caufe to be fliav'd fo loon as they are taken. So that it is a diffi cult thing for a Criminal to effiape the hands of Juftice for wherever they go, when they find tha t a r nan has no Hair, he is taken and earn'd to the Governour, who caufes him to ? be nail'd to a Crofs immediately. They fit crofs legg'd , after the manner of the Jfiatic People. At great mens Houfes, in the Halls, where they receive their Vifits, there is as it were an with a kind of a Bedfted rais d about a foot from the ground. It is cover'd with a very fine Mat,, made of little Reeds bound together, as it were with fine thread. For it is not the Cuftom to fpread Carpets upon the Floors, as in other Not that the deernefs hinders them from making rfe^of them , for thefe Mats coft them more then a fineCarpet would'do, but becaufe they are cooler to fit Upon, and becaufe the Putties do not get lo eafily ihto them* Being l bought one of thefe Mats of zt&amp;utotjtokftfe j which w^s admir d for its finertefi.

As for their Diet the Tmrquinefes are not very curious. The Comm^r People^ are contenfetf with Rice boil'd in w r ater, and^ dri d Fift, or faked Eggs. For as for Flefh they dif none but at their FeflSvalsi : The great Lords are fexvT every d^f with 1 Flefh* andTiffiy feut their Cooks know not what / belongs.to‘bak d Meats; Olherwife they are more neat in their Kitchins and Chambers then we , only they make no nfibeithen of Napkins or Table-cloaths. Whatever is fee before them tU eat, is lerv'd in little Plates, not fo big as our Trenehers, being made of wood lacker'd with all forts of Plow rs*, tike the Cabinets which are brought from Japan*mbAll tbefe Plates are brought up , rang'd in order, in a large Voyder, lacker'd like the Plates. Ulually the Voyder holds tenor twelve Plates, and the Meat is cut in little pieces., about the bignels of a, Hazle Nut. They make ufe neither of Spoons, nor Knives, nor Forks, but only of thole little Sticks, of which I have made mention in the foregoing Chapter, never touching their Meat with their fingers. toDilcourfe , they alway allow the Eldeft the honour of beginning, bearing a great refpect to them, that are aged. But the Youngeft, at the Table, is never permitted to begm the Dhcourfe. They waflh their Hands, their Mouths, and Faces before they fit down , but never after Meals. And when they defire to know whether every one has had his fill, they ask him whether he have eaten his.Rice, according to the Cuftom of the Ancient Fathers in Scripture, who, by Bread , meant the whole Repaft. Neither is it a Cuftom among them to ask one another how they do l but how naany Meafures of Rice he eat for his Dinner, ar&gt;d whether he eat with an Appetite. This is a general Cuftom among all the Idolatrous Indians , unlefs in the Dominions of the Great where they eat not Rice only, but Bread, and there they ask in civility how much Rice they boil'd, and how much Meal they bak'd for Bread j for the more he eats, the better in health they think a man is* Among all the Paftimes of the Tuncjuinefes there are none are only Acfted in the Night-time • but thofe which are pre- fented the day that they firft behold the new Moon are the heft. They laft from Sun-letting to Sun-rifing, and they are let out with beautiful Decorations and Machines, very pleafing to behold. They are excellently well skill d in reprelenting the Sea and Rivers, and making a fliew of Sea- fights, and Combats between Galleys and Barks, though they have leldom more then eight A£tors, Men and Women* The places appointed for thefe fights, are great Halls, the third part whereof the Theater takes up, the reft being fill'd with Benches for the Spectators. Upon each fide of the Theater, is a Box very fiimptuoufty fee out referv’d for the When there are feverai fitting at the Table, either at their ordinary' Meals, or upon fome Feftival, th^y account it a great piece of Manners to be filent • or if they have a defire wherein they take fo much delight as in Comedies, which Kin 1A New and Particular K elation of the King when he pleafes to come. The A&amp;ors and Actreffes are very magnificently clad. The drels for the Womens heads being a kind of Miter or Diadem, which exceedingly becomes them, from the hinder part whereof two Ribonds, three fingers broad, hang down below their wafts. Both the one and the other h£t their parts very perfectly, and, according to their manner, obferve an exadi time in their Dancing. At one of the corners of the Hall fit the tvVo Judges of the Comedy, one of whom beats time upon a Brafs Drum. Their othdr ordinary Paftimes, elpecially for the Lords and Mandarins, are Fiftiitig and Hunting, though they take more pleafure in the former , by reafon of the plenty of Fifh which their Rivers afford them. But, as I laid before, they follow thefe fports only upon the days that are permit ted them,as being better husbands of their time then we, not fparing any part of it from bufinefs. So that they who at the beginning of that little knowledge which we had of thefe f People,wrote that their Manners and Cuftoms were wild and barbarous,w r ere mifinform’d. For as there is no reafon to doubt of the truth of what I affirm,and what others have confirm'd by other Relations, we may well conculde from what l have faid, That all the Duties of Civil Society and Politenels are not confin'd within our Europe± but that the Kingdom of T«?z- quin, anciently a part of China, ftill retains the good Govern ment and Civility of the Cbmefes themfelves. CHAP. IX. the Learned Men in the Kingdom Tunquin. C yErtain it is, that the Tunquinefes have a very great inclination for Learning, and that they apply them- ^ felves to their Studies with diligence and luccefs: for that they cannot be advanc'd without it to the Offices and Dignities in the Kingdom. I do not here, by Learning, mean the underftanding of the Languages of our Learned Menom OJ 1 U N Q_ u I N. Men of Europe, which are altogether unknown to the Eaftern People , and much lefs the Philofophy of Jriftotle, of which they never fo much as heard. But we mean the knowledge ol the Laws of their Country , by means whereof they obtain the charges of Judicature- the Mathe matic ks, and particularly Aftronomy , to which all the Ori entals have a great inclination , as being great obferyers of the Stars, by whole afllftance they flatter themfelves to be able to foretel things to come. The Tunquinefes are alfo paffio- nate lovers of and ^Poetry, as being great admirers of Comedy and Tragedy, of which thole two Sciences are the main Compofition • fo that the Muficians and A&amp;ofs of Tunquin are accounted the bell in the whole Eaftern part of the World. That you may acquire Nobility by Learning ? in your Youth, youmuft pafs through three degrees, of the'6)Wc, the Toucan, and the Tanfi, from which degree you may afeend to that of the Nobility. . To attain the firft degree ^ it behoves the Youth of Tunquin to apply themlelves for eight years together to their Studies / and that very clofe, to enable themfelves for the Office^of a Notary, Proftor, and Advocate , to which there is nothing more conducing then to fpeak Eloquently in public. At the end of eight years, they are examin'd concerning the duty of thole Employments« and if arty one fail to give an Anfwer to the Queftions propounded, he is lent back again as incapable to obtain any Employment for the future, or to ftudy any longer. For thole that acquit themlelves well of their Examination, which is very rigorous, their Names are let down in a Regifter, and prelcnted to the King, who firft grants them the liberty to take upon them the Title of Symk ,, and then if it be their aim to enjoy the Quality of Toucan, they are com manded by the 7 anft s to ftudy Mujtc , Aftrology, and Toejie, not only to be able to be judge of it, but alfo to perform themfelves upon occaflon, : For to be good judges of Co medy, which is a great Honour among them, it behoves them to be both good Comedians and Muficians. Nor in deed is there any Paftime more frequent then that of the -Theater in this Country-for there is never any folemtt Feftival among them , which is not accompany’d and fee E forthA New and Particular Relation of the forth with Artificial Fire-works 3 in making whereof thefe People are exquifite &gt; after which they have their Come dies ? with Machines, and change of Scenes in every Ad. Befides this, their Adors have a prodigious memory , fo that let the part be never fo long, they never make ufe of Prompters to affifl them, as we do in Europe. They that will learn the Mathematkks , muft make their own Inftruments themfelves, and Ipend five years in this ftudy. They are examin'd every year , and if they fail to anfvver Inch Queftions as are ask'd them, for the firft four they are pardon'd; but at the end of the five years, if upon the grand Examination, they fail to anfwer the Queftions demanded them by the Tanfis , they are utterly degraded 5 whereas if they fatisfie their Examiners, they are permitted the Name and Dignity of Voucarn After thirteen years thus fpent, before they can arrive to the degree of a Tanfi, they muft fpend four years more in learning to write and read the Charader tofucha certain number of Words. For the life of a Man would not fiiffice to learn to write and read the Cbinefe quite through. The reafon is, becaufe that as to this particu lar , it is not in China as in other Nations, where one Word is compos'd of leveral Letters. The Cbinefes for every Word have a different Figure , all which Figures are very numerous, as you may eafily conjedure* By the by let me tell you , that thefe Figures are made with fmall Pen cils, and that the Cbinefes make tile of a certain Ink, which is made up into a Pafte, and fo moiften'd in Water as you make ufe of it. They have alio another fort of Colour for certain Words, But they cannot make ule of Pens, as our Euro peans , which are made of Quits - nor of thofe of other Eaftern People, which are made of fmall redifh brown Reeds, the beft of which grow in certain Merfihes in the Kingdom of Tegu and Jracban. But to return to the Students of Tuncpuin , they are alfo oblig'd to underftand the Laws and Cuftoms of the Chinefes, as well as their oWn •, and the laft four years being at an end, the laft and great Examination is made in the great place, within the Enclofure of the Palace of Ttmquin, which is a ftately Marble ftrudure.

After that they return to Court, to inftruft themfelves in the affairs of the Kingdom, and the King’s Houfe, and to perfect themfelves in the knowledge of thofe things, which is the way to obtain the Dignity of a Man- dam.

But more particularly they apply themfelves to the beating of the Pulfe, and its diverfity of Meafure, by which they chiefly pretend to underftand the caule of the Difeafe, and what Remedy to make ufe of for cure. And therefore when they go to feel a Pulfe, they feel it in feveral parts of the Body • and according to the diverfity of the party and the beating, they judge of the quality of the Diftemper. Therefore upon their firft coming, they feel the Patient in three places, firft upon their right fides, and fecondly npon their left. By the Pulfe which they feel upon the wrift of the right hand, they guefs of the condition of the Lungs 5 by that which they feel upon the Vein of the Arms, where gene ^ king Me Aid tain for t of ft) Wen U u ifliinee rteii ku f ti fciui Vtc *iGl ^enom of T U N Q_ u I N. generally People are let Blood , they guefs at the Diftem- pers of the Stomach j and the Region of the Kidneys. The Pulfe of the left Wrift difcovers to them the conditioii of the Heart: By that in the Veins of the left Arm, where ufually they let Blood, they are inform’d of the eftate of the Liver. By the Pulfes of the Temples, both right and left * they give a more exquilite judgment of the Kid neys. They are very careful to count how many times a Pulfe of a fick Perfon beats in the time of one Refpiration • and according to thefe feveral Pulfes, they tell yoit which part of the Body is particularly diftemper’d, whether the Heart, the Liver, or the Lungs 5 or whether the Diftem- per proceed from any outward caufe, as from Cold, Sadneis, or any other diforderly Paflion. They never make ufe of any other Remedies but of Herbs and Roots, vi/hieh they choofe themfelves ; there being no diftin&amp;ion among them of and fbyfcian. Thefe Herbs they mingle fbmetimes with a little Ginger , which they boyl in Water, and give the Decodfion, being drain’d, to the Patient. They have very good Receipts for the Purples, Epilepfie, and feveral other Difeafes which are accounted incurable in Europe. They make ufe of China Ink to flop a Dyfentery, and for the cure of Wounds. When the Sea Ebbs from the fhoar upon thefe Coafts, they find upon the Sand a little fmall kind of Crabs, which dye immediately, and by the heat of the Sun, which is there extraordinary , become as hard as a Stone in a fhort time • thefe the Tunquineje Phyficians beat to Powder, and give to their Patients in Dyfenteries, and Feavers, fometimes in Jfia VttiC , fometimes in plain Water. They mightily ad mire the Herb Tea, which comes from China and Japan - which latter Country produces the beft. It is brought to them in Tin Pots elofe ftop’d, to keep out the Air. When they would ufe it, they boyl a quantity of Water, accor ding to the proportion they intend to ufe, and when the Water feeths, throw a fmall quantity into it, allowing as much as they can nip between their Thumb and fore-Finger to a Glafs. This they preferibe to be drank as hot as they can endure it, as being an excellent Remedy againft the Headach , for the Gravel, and forthofethat are fubjeft to’ the Griping of the Guts - but then they order a little GingerA New and Particular R elation of the to be put into the Water when it' boyls. At Goa &lt; ftataVu^ and in all the Indian Fadcones, there are none ot the &amp;ro- peans who do not ipend above four or fi ve Leaves a day 5 and they are .careful to preferve the bpyfd Leal lor an Evening Sallad 3 with Sugar, Vinegar, and Oyl. That is accounted the heft Tea which colours the Water greeneft 5 but that which makes the Water look Red, is little accounted of. * In Japan.. The King and great Lords, who drink To?, drink only the Flower, which is.much more whol fom, and of a tali much more pleafmg. But the Price is much different, for one of our ordinary Beer Glaffes is there worth a French Crown. . ^ . :: The moft dangeroug-. Diftempers that befall the Tmufui- nejes , moft ufually happen when the bad Air lurprizes the People ^ for of a hidden ,it deprives them of their Speech, and then Death fuddenly follows without a fpeedy Remedy. The beft Remedy for this hidden Diftemper is to mix fome Counterpoifon wkh jqua FiM - i n head of W ine, and to let the Patient drink it as hot as he can. The Patient alfo mujLat the fame time be, rubhl with a Cloth dipd in Jfua ■ FiU,, . where Ginger lias been boyPd. This takes away the pains caus'd by cold Winds, and unwhollbna Airs. Thoughipme for the more Ipeedy cure of rhefe pains ,Tay the Patient upon a Bed made only of Girts, four Fingers diftant one from the other - and then letting a Ghafing-difli iinderneath , cauie the fick Perfon to Iweat in a Cloud of Frankincenle, till the pain is gone, repeating the fame thing Morning and Evening. As for Blood-letting, it is by no means us'd in that Coun try. They make ufe of Fire , elpeciaily for the Purple- Feaver, a Difeafe fo dangerous in France. For the cure of this, the Phyfitians of Tunquin take the Pith of a Reed, which they dry very well • dip it in Oyl, and fet it on Fire: and then apply to every Purple Spot one of theie lighted Wicks. The Spot will give a whif like a fmall Squib,- and that's an infallible fign that the Venom , is gone out or the body- This Remedy is feldom apply xl but in the night time , becaufe the ; Spot does not appear fo well in the day time. And the Phyfician mult be very cafeful, that when this Venom flies out of the Patient's Body, it does not find a way into his own : for then there is no Remedy, • hutbut Death. There are feme Phyficians that will prick the Purple Spot with a Needle , and let out the Peftilential Blood ; after which they burn the part To prick'd, and then mb it with Ginger 3 not permitting their Patient to take the Air in 20 days after they are cur'd- While they are under cure , they drink nothing but Water, with Citron- peel boyl’d in it j and abftain from Fleflh and Butter. They give them to eat Rice boyl’d in Water , and fait Fifh 5 but the more they abftain from eating and drinking, the fooner they are cur'd. r And indeed it is a wonderful thing to lee the excellent effects of their Remedies in fo fhort a time ; for they have no lingring Diftempers to hold them years together, as they do among us. — !■■■■■■ I!■ ■■■■■« .1 I ■ —HW.I. .

What is ,re- ported of the firft Tunquinejes, That they were without Governours, and without Kings, is altogether fabulpnSfj like to that which is related of a certain Infant of three years of Age , who appearing before a great Affernbly of the People, exhorted them to free themfelves from the power of the Chineses^ who were their Oppreffors. Upon which a lovely Horle miraculouily .appearing to the laid Infant, he mounted the Horfe^ andimmediately lettitig for ward with thofe that were gather'd alter him, as alfb others that appear'd as wonderfully or affift him^ he fet upon the Chinefes , and defeated them in Rich manner, that they never durft venture after that to return any more to reepnejuer what they had loft. But the moft certain, truth .of ; I.m ic nas oeen govern a oy nx various rauuucs. x ue, mu afliimd the Title of fving was a famous R&lt;ibbef^.^y^p|? 'K! ^ m pI A New and Particular Relation of the Name Was Din, who having gather'd together a great Number of Maleeontents, and Vagabonds, became fo powerful and formidable through his own Valour, that after feveral bloody Battels gain'd, it was no difficult thing for him to leize upon the Throne. But he did not reign long in peace, for the moft part of the People rebell'd againft him j and in thefirftBattel that he fought, he loft his Life. However his own Party won the day ; and having left two Sons, his eldeft reigned three years ; after whofe death, the younger Brother rul'd in his Head, but dy’d foon after, neither of the Brothers leaving any iffue behind them. After that the Kingdom was milerably diftrafted by feveral Civil Wars , till the weaker Party calling in the Chinefs to their Affiftance, became the moft puiffant; -Then it was that a certain Mandarin, of the Family of Lelequel, was advanc'd to the Throne, who being a valiant and prudent Prince, reftor'd tranquillity to the whole Kingdom. Who,whenhe faw himfelf Eftablifh'd in peace, built that large Palace, which they, who have feen it, admire, as well for it's Circuit, as for its magnificent Strudlure, beitig all of Marble of divers Colours, both within and without. This King had but one Daughter, who foon after her Father's death , the better to fecure her fclf, marry'd one of ffie moft powerful Mandarins in the Coiihtry, of the Houfe of Tran. But foon after, one of her Subjects rebelling againft her, gave her battel, took her Prifoner, and put her to death. Having thus got the Power into his hands, the Rebel ufurp'd the Throne; but nine years after, he was alio flain in Battel by his own Subjects, who had call'd the Chinefes to their Affiftance. They being thus Matters of the Kingdom, held it for twenty years, and let Covemours over every Province. But at length the Mandarins grew weary of their Oppreffion, becaufe of the heavy Tributes which they laid upon the Tuncjuinefa fo that a valiant Captain of the Houfe of Lc,having aftembled a numerous Power together, gave the Chinefes three Battels, and in every one overcame them. The Chinefes thus expelH out of Tunquin , the Coriquerour feiz'd the Grown, and in his Family the Regal Government continu'd for above four- fcore years. After which time, a great Lord, of the Family &lt;&gt;f Mdrrf which had formerly enjoy'd the Scepter ,and being affifted by a great Number of difcontented Per- fons, of which the beft_ regulated Kingdoms are always joy'd the Fruits of his Victory but a ffriall while. For two years afterwards, a Mandarin, of the Houfe of Irk having efpous'd the Daugliter of another great Lord openly declar’d War againft his Soveraign , with a defign utterly to exci; pate the Houfe of Marr. Unhappily for him,death put aifop to his defigns, though he left two Sons behind him, able enough to have purlu’d his undertakings. But the elded, naturally timorous, and fearing to engage himfelf in a dangerous War, voluntarily liibmitted himlelf to the King , who gave him the Government of a Province, and marry’d him to one of his Sifter’s Daughters. The younper Brother being a valiant Prince, and haying his deceafed iiimgrtic advantages,would giveear to nothings but Out of his ambition to Reign himfelf continu’d and iucccfsfully ac- complifh d what his Father had begun; In the fecond Battel which he gave the King , who was therein perfori, he took him Prifoner, together with his Brother , who had fubmitted tb him, and fome few days after he put them both publicly to death at the head of his Army ; the one as in unjuft ufurper of the Throne ; the ether as a delertor, who had abandon’d his Father’s Army, and fo ill follbw’d his intentions. Now though as Vidtor he might eafily have alcended the Throne , and tak’n upon him the Name and Title of Kiri°y yet he would not accept of any higher Title then that bf General of the Army; and the better to Eftablifli himfelF in his Authority, and to gain the affection of the People j he caus’d Proclamation to be made through all che Provinces or the Kingdom, that if there were any Prince of the Houfe of Le yet remaining alive, he fhould fhew himfelf, with full afiurance that upon his appearing , he fhould be put into pofteffion of the Kingdom. There w.w but one to be found, F who1 I II It V | 34 A New and Particular R elation of the Who had been fo clofely purfn'd by the Houfe of Marr, while it rul'd ? that to fave his Life he was forc'd to abfeond himfelf in the Frontiers of the Kingdom, under the Habit of a private Soldier. The General was overjoy'd to find that there was yet a lawful Heir of the Houle of Le to be found , that he might place him upon the Throne. So that fo foon as he was known to be of the Legitimate Race, all the Equipage and Attendance of a King was lent to him^ with Order to all the Provinces as he pafs'd along, to receive him as if he were already crown’d. The whole Army march’d two days march to meet the King, and brought him to Cheeo, the capital City of the Kingdom , where he was plac'd in the Throne of his Father, and with great Pomp proclaim'd King ol Tunquin* But General 2 rm,who car'd not fo much for the Royal Title 5 as the Royal Power, fo order'd his bufinefs, that leaving to Le all the outward fhew and Pomp of Royal Authority, he referv'd to himielf the whole command of the Army, and the greateft part of the Revenues of the Kingdom abfoliitely to dilpole of at his own pleafure. So that from that time to this hour , we may affirm that there has been, and ftill are, two Kings of Tunquin y of which the firfthas only the Name and Title of King, and is call'd Bma , and the Ibcond Cboiia, who has all the Authority, difpofing of all things at his pleafure, while the other remains fhut up in his Palace like a Slave, not permitted to ftir abroad but upon certain days: and then he is carry'd through the Streets of Checo 3 like an Image, though with a magnificent Train and Royal Equipage. He has generally 2000Soldiers for his Guard,- and fometimes 20000 which are quarter'd upon the Frontiers, chiefly to ward Cochinchina. He alfo has ready upon the Frontiers 50 Elephants for War. And upon the Rivers of the Kingdom where the Enemy can come to damage him, he ufually keeps 100 great Galleys, with a vaft company of fmall Galliots, to which the Soldiers and Rowers that belong, have more pay then the others at Land. And theie, that they may row with more ifrength, row {landing, with their Faces toward the Prow , quite contrary to our Row ers , who turn their backs. The King gives public Audience almoft every day; but he makes no Edi&lt; 5 t, or public Decree, that is of any effect. tkli, ‘ ftflor small i&gt; lie 1® S ttided it State tope tie dea iteaiw ftedliti tie Pt toad leingj ligii.C lip ol to wk ttk |end t Ik S&gt;ke, Court, ^en, ^do hive ^ci( ^e, Hit Wif ic be not alfo Sign’d by the At thele Audiences he has with him thirty two Councellors of State, and beiides thefe , a hundred others to judge of all Appeals of the Kingdom. The Eunuchs have a very great Power at Court, as in all other Courts of Jfia j and the King, as to his moft important affairs, confides more in them then in his own Children. The eldeft Children do not always fucceed their Father 5 for the ( boti-t ,or General, with all the Goun- cellors , which are generally his Creatures, thought it con venient , that when the Kang fhould have more Sons then one, he fhould make choice oi whom he pleas’d to lucceed him. So that fo (bon as he has nam’d him p the } attended by the principal Officers of the Army; Councellors of State, and Eunuchs, come to congratulate ihim; and to give him their Oaths to fet him upon the,Thrbne after the death,of his Father; and for the other Brothers they are always fluit up in the Palace, asinaPrilon, without medling with any affairs of State. They never cftic out of the Palace but four times a year p/and they rrefer ftay abroad above fix days at a time, the Officers that attend them being put upon them by the Cbmd / who is as it were K^'d high Conftabie of the Kingdom. The;-firft’of&gt; thefe fix days of liberty theylgo.to:.vifit.theTernples, and the-Prieffsj to whom they give large Alms; the two next days they take their plealure in hunting - andi the three laft days they fpend&lt; their tirfie upon the Rivers, in Galleys fumptuoully frimffl’dand adorffidiunm /! n/; aadjogoj c .oflw t .miil i , The Kingdom of .'Tmicjum is divided into eight large Pro- vinces ; every one of which has itsGovernour, and its Ma- giftrates, from whole fentence there lies an Appeal to the Court. We fliould wrong this Cbuntry to fay that there Wefe no Nobility therekvp as indeed .there:, are none in moft Kingdoms of Ajia. But 'they irriift all attain,to this degree their merit ; feme byithe Warrspnd -fome by their Learhtn^. They who attain theffi Nobility by Arms, have wherewithaiE to live handfo'mly atr home;;; and they begin to learn their Exercifes betimes pat fartheft by eleven or twelve years of Age. - The firft thing they are to underftand , is how to handle their Swords- the.Blades ofg which are (Freight: y long, and broad, like-thofe oflthe.Smt^f» s, having, but one 'Edge/ They -are ate taught maim: with their .Bo ws'■ F ?, ah'd innA New md Particular Relation of the and to fire a Musket with Matches, (for they know not theufeof Fire-Locks) to ride the great Horle, to (hoot running, and to manage thzit Zagays^ which are a fort of Staves, cheek'd with Iron, like a Half-Pike. When they are ready in all thele Exercifes ? then they learn to make all forts of Artificial Firerworks} a$ alfo how to in vent new ones ? tQ make life of them againft the Elephants. By the way L mufl needs tell you, there are fome of thefe Ele phants as I have feen feveral times, that are fo accuftom'd to thefe Artificial Fires, that they regard them not at all, neither are any way difturb'd at the Scjuibs that are thrown, and go off under their very Nofes and Bellies. Neverthe- lefs of zoo of thele Creatures which the Eaftern Kings carry to their Wars at a time , you flhall have hardly fifteen that are lb hardy and valiant. So that unlefs their Gover- nours take not great, care, inftead of running upon the Enemy, they turn upon their Friends, and put the whole Army into a moft diffnal confufion 5 ax you fiiall hear by the following j Story r . For Anrenge-Zeke , the prefent Great Mogul , being then a young Prince, obtain'd of Cha-gehm , his Father, to let him have the command of an Army of threefcore thoufand Men, and fourfcore Ele phants • and with this force,: out of his Antipathy to the Chriftians, he laid Siege fo Daman , a Town belonging to the Tortugdls , fourteen Leagues from Surat. The Gover- nour was a perfoa of greqx Valour i and had alfo two Sons with him, who, together with himfelf, had both ferv'd the King of France. He had alio in the Town eight hun dred Gentlemen, who voliintarily put themlelves into the Garrifon for its defence, Tom all parts &lt; of India where the (Portugiiefex had ta do, and were aHexcellently well mounted. For the (Portugalsr: at that time made ule of none but Arabian Horfes, the wotff of whichxofl: a thoufand Crowns at leaft. The Governour finding that the:Indian Vrincc began to prels hard, upon him, having already made two Affauhs, refolv'd With all his Cavalry and Infantry to make ^ Salley upon Sun day Morning, eaufing them to fix at the ends of their Spears and Lances certain Artificial Firevworks, to which they were order'd fuddenly to give fire, as: foon as they lliould gain the Elephants Quarter. This defign was fo fucceisful, that when it came to be executed,the Elephants were fo fuddenly terrified.ix.tr/gaom of 1 u n o_ u i n. temfi’d, chat running impetuoufly through the Indian Army- they trod to the ground , and cut in pieces with the Swords and Seiches which were fatten'd to their Trunks, what ever flood in their way. The Tortugals taking advantage of this confufion, made no lels havock among the amazed Multi tude, whom they nad furprizd lecurely and profoundly afleep. Foi they had an opinion, that the ^Portugals would never attack them upon the Sabboth day, believing they had the fame veneration for that day which the Jem had; Blit they Were utterly deceiv’d, in io much chat the 'Portu- gals , by virtue of this Stratagem lb clofely purfud, obtain d. a notable Victory, to the utter deftruftion of 2000b of Aurmge-Zebes Army , the fpoils whereof are reported to have amounted to above twelve Millions. But to return to the Kingdom of I mutt tell you, that the Tunquinefes have often wag’d War againft the tbinefes] becaufe the firft would not pay the latter the Tribute which was accorded them by a Treaty made by one of their Kings, of cheHoufe of Le. But in the year the Chmcfes , feeing that the Tartars had made themll-lves Matters of their Country, made a Peace with the Ttmqutnefes , wherein it was agreed, that the faid Tribute fhould be no longer paid / but that they fhould every year fend an Embaflador only tb fequ'm 5 to do homage tothe Emperour of China. As for their Juftice and Policy , they obferve a very exa£t Order and Regulatioh over all the Kingdom of Thnquin , as well in their Cities, as in the Gbuntry. So that few of the heft regulated Kingdoms exceed them. More efpecially they have a great care, for the public good, tb repair the Bridges and High-ways 5 arid every Quarter of a League there is Inch Provision made , that any Traveller may there meet not only with Water, but Fire alfo to light his Pipe, being generally great Iffioakers of Tobhcco. As for Murder, they are very exact in pimittiing that crime. For they carry tire Peribn apprehended before thri* In,4rr^ _ o t-i 4 t-ji /Of-! l-»/**-*-* n (1?

So that if there be no agreement made , then it behoves the next of kin to be the Executioner himfelf, and put the Criminal to that death to which he is before condemn'd. CHAP. XI I. Of the Court of the Kings of Tunquin. Lthough the King, as I have already faid, have not much Authority in his Kingdom, which is govern'd altogether by the General , who has the whole Militia at his Devotion , yet he is highly honour'd by his Subjects, and he keeps a very fplendid Court. The firft and fifteenth day of every Month , all the Mandarins who are the Grandees of the Kingdom j are bound to come in their Chinefe Habits to kifs the King's hands. The Con- ftable, or General, was formerly wont to perform the fame Office, but by degrees he has obtain'd a dilpenlation, and only lends another Prince in his Head. As lor all the: other Mandarins , Gbver-nours of Provinces, Judiciaries ,, and Military Officers, every year they go to kifs the Choiia’s hands, and to congratulate him upon the firft day of the year,which is the fifteenth of thofifth Month ■ as alio when, he has obtain'd any great. Victory over his Enemies. So himfelf. 'Tis alfo the : cuftom of the Tunquinejes j among theMen , chat when they meet any Perion higher in condi tion then themfelves, they make four profound obeyfances to the.very Earth, But for the Women, what ever their condition be among themfelves, they never make but one. They who are defirous to be admitted into the Palace to fee the King, are oblig’d to put On Violet Robes.^ and their Servants muft be cl^d inthe fame colour.

He gives them Pains of Gold, every one worth fix hundred livres; and Bars of Silver, amounting each to forty fix Livres. The fame day he alfo releaies all Prifdners, both Criminal arid Debtors, provided the crime donotdeferve death; and that the debt do not exceed two Bats of Silver. Aifo every year ^ the three laft days of the lafi: Month , the 40 Manddnm, who £re the chief Councellors of ^tate, take the Oaths of all the Lords and Officers of the Courts and of their Wives 5 taufing them to fwear to be faithful to the King, and if they know of any thirig that Concerns the King's perfon , or his Kingdoim, to difcover it. All Go- Vernours of Provinces give the fame Oaths to the Lords and Gentlemen under their JurifdidionSj and the Governours of Cities to the Citizens, and other Inhabitants* They that difcover anyTreafon never fail of any reward- only with this diftindiori, in reference to the quality of the Per- fons that reveal it. For as for the Mandarins and Gentle- men, the King rewards them according to his Own' plea- lure : But as for the meaner fort, Whether Men or Women, they are enrtobFd, and gratiffd with a reward of 50 Pains of Gold , and 500 Bars of Silver, which in all amounts to 51000 Livres. But they efteem their Nobility far beyond their Money. At certain times of the year , there is a Muftef of the Youth of the feveral Provinces - and all thole wffio are found not to be either of the Nobility, or not to have learnt any Trade, are p re fen tly enroll'd for the Service of the King 3 who every five years make choice of fuch as he in tends for his Guard, and fends them to the Frontier Garrb fens. There are fome who endeavour to get off by Money - hue if they be difeover’d , both the Officers and the Soldier are puniflYd without redemption.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Ceremonies obferv’d when the Kings of Tunquin are advanc'd to the Throne. B Efore we (peak of the Enthroning the Kings of Tunquin, and of the Ceremonies that attend it ? it behoves us to relate the manner of their letting out of the Palace, when they go at any time to take their plea- fure. The King is leated upon a mofl: magnificent f alan- quin , carry'd by eight Men, where he may be beheld by all the People • the Lords and Officers of the Court attend ing him on foot, provided he do not go out of the City; for when he goes 'into the Country he rides upon an Ele phant , and the Lords follow him on Horfe-back. When the Queen Mother 3 or his firfl: Wife go abroad, they are likewife carry'd upon a clofe Talanquin , with Lattice-Win dows, to the end 3 they may fee and not be leen; and behind the Talanquin follow the Maids of Honour on foot. The Mandarins, and great Princes, folemnize their Birth days every year , with great Feafting, Paftimes, Come dies, and Fire-works, and all their Friends and Kindred fail not to attend them to honour the Solemnities. In the year 1645, the eldefl Son of the King, who was by his Father appointed for his Succeffor , upon one of his Birth days fihew'd the Court all the divertizements he could imagin , and the King who had a great affe&amp;ion for him, fent him a thoufand Pains of Gold , and five hundred Bars of Silver, to the value of 120000 Litres* At which time,large Alms are diftributed, efpecially to poor Widows and Prifoners* When fki Jtli^ illtht ' ^ wh Efinjh hiJico 1 | Here i lief lento Ae tef oi bif lonrte mg tin tie Pa, lot, t foot • fin, at Courtc eigfito! to tie tie LorKingdom 0/' T u n cl u i n. ” 'When the King dies, and leaves feveral Sons, they fee up him whom (when alive) he chofe for his Succelfor. The third day after the Deceafe of the King, the Conftable with all the Military Mandarins ,the Lords of the Council, and all the Covernours of Provinces, repair to the Prince’s Ap- pii-merit, where they prefent him with a Habit, af- which having mounted him upon an Elephant, they bri w him into one of the great Courts of his Palace, which is all covered with Cloth of Gold and Silver as with a Tent. ThereJt is, that being placed upon a Throne magnifi- candy enrich’d, all the Mandarins proftrate themfelves up on me Earth with their Heads downward ; in which po- ftu :e ha ving lain for feme time, they rife, and doling their Hands together, with their Arms and Eyes lifted up to Hea ven, they fwear to the new King to be faithful to him till death- This firft Ceremony being over, the new King, to * (hew himfelf liberal upon his firlt coming to the Crown, caufes four Panes of Gold, and fix Bars of Silver, to be gi ven to eve y one. But to diftinguifh the Conftable from the teft, he gives him twenty Panes of Gold, and forty Bars ol Silver: and to the Prefident of the Council or Chancel- lour ten of Gold and twenty of Silver. Thefe Prefents be ing thus made, feveral Pieces of Artillery are fired round, the Palace, accompanied with feveral Volleys of fmall Shot, there being then in Arms above 30000 Horfe and Foot*; and then the King is fet upon a magnificent falan- qm, and the Conftable and chief of the Council ride before upon lovely Horfes. Sixteen of the principal Officers of the Court carry the King, vi ^eight Military Mandarins, and eight of the Council. And in this manner they fet forward to the Apartment of the deceafed King, from whence all the Lords retire for two hours, except the Eunuchs ; and then it is, that the Pnncefles, Ladies of the Court, and chief Wives of the Mandarins, cometokifs the King s Hand, and congratulate his Advancement to the Throne. Which done, all the Lords return again to a noble Feaft after the manner of the Countrey ready prepar d. Their Viands are not fo delicate, nor fo delicioufly drels d as ours, neither have they fo much variety. ’Tis true, they have thole ‘Birds-nests , already mention’d, which they mix in the moft part of their Difhes, which gives the Meat a taft of G almoftA New and Particular Relation of the almoft all forts of Spices. Of all the Meats which they eat Colts Flefli is in mo if efteem, and Dogs Fleflh, neither 0 f Which agree with our Palates. The Feftrval is concluded with Comedies and Fireworks, which la allft the night. The next day the 90000 Men that gave their Volleys of fmall Shot the day before, are drawn up in good order in a Held next, and all the principal Officers of War, Colonels, Captains, and Lieutenants, leave the Frontiers to be at the fame place. Then the King mounted upon his Palanquin, and carried by fixteen of his principal Officers, the Conita- ble and grand Squire riding before, and attended by leveral other Commanders on foot, with feveral Mummers that play and dance before the (pallanquin, goes forth of his Pa lace, the Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, and other Warlike In- ftruments, filling the Air with their Martial Sounds. In this Pomp, and with this Equipage, the King being come to the Camp, quits his Palanquin, and mounts one of his great Elephants of War, which are us'd to the noife of the Guns and fight of the Fireworks. Being thus mounted, he rides into the middle of all his Troops, in which place all the Officers fwear Fidelity to him ; after which he beflows his Gifts upon them, to every Colonel two Panes of Gold, and forty Bars of Silver ♦ to every Captain the half of what he gives a Colonel, and to every Lieutenant the half of what he gives a Captain : and as for the Souldiers, they have every one a Moneths Pay. Thefe Prefents being made, the whole Army difcharges three Volleys, and then every Com pany retreats into a large Hint, where they have Meat and Drink prepar'd for them, enough to ferve them a whole day and a night. In the fame Field is alio let up a fair woo den Palace, fumptuoufly enriched within with Paintings and leveral pieces of Workmanfhip in Gold. There the King Ipends all the night, fome part in Feafting, feme part in Plays and feeing the Mummers dance, and the reft in be holding the Fireworks. The next day the King leaves his wooden Palace, which is afterwards fir'd by the Souldiers, as well as their own Hurts, and io returns to the City. Be ing arrived at his Palace with the fame pomp that he went forth, he (eats himfelf upon his Throne, and there fhew 7 s his Liberality to thofe that made the Fireworks, to the Come dians and Dancers, and all the reft that were any way con- tributary,43 Kingdom of T U n q u t n. tribti-ory to the fetting forth the Pomp of the, Then he gives Acceis to all the People, and two Commiih- oners, one for the Merchants, and the other for the Handi crafts, make a Speech to the King, the fubftance whereof is; that all the Burgefles and Inhabitants of the good City of Cbeco do acknowledge him for their King, and that they will be faithful to him till death. The Speech being ended, the King ptefents the Body of the Merchants with 50 Panes of Gold, and 3 00 Bars of Silver; andtheBodybftheTradd- men with ao Panes of Gold, and 100 Bars of silver. The People gone home, every one ftrives who fhall fpend moft in Feafting and Comedies, adding of their own to the Kings Bounty • lb that every Quarter of the City is full of Jollity and Rejoycing for a week together. Some days after come the Conifoifiioners for the Commonalty, from all parts, of the Kingdom, who in the behalfot their Cities and Towns make known to His Majefty the univerfal Joy of the People for their lawful Prince, affuring him of their Fidelity, and of their Service againft the Cbtmfes* They name particularly the ( hineles, becaufe the Tmcjuinefes hive no greater Ene mies than they, and for that the Hatred between them is ir- reconcileable. The King oblerving the good will of his Peo ple, teftifies his Acknowledgment in this manner : All that have not time Out of mind been Rebels to their lawful Sovereigns, but have eonftantly taken up Arm's for their Defence, are dilcharged for a year from all Taxes and 1 m- pofitions; and for the reft, Who have at any time former;y aim led the Enemy, they are onely exempted for fix moueths,: All Prifoners for Debt partake alfoofthe King’s Bounty, fo chat after the Prefident of the Council has made aCorfipo- feron with the Creditors for half the Summe, the King pays orifices the King fends to the Temples of his falfe Gods, to' be there offer’d to the Idols. fand,befides the value of a million in Panes ofGoldjTiifues, 1 and ' ilks, to adorn the Idols, and Orange-coloUred Calicuts for the Tionkes, and thole that attend the Service of the fd- rais.

The idolatrous Princes alfo confume incredible Summes to adorn the [ Ta&lt;rods and Images of their falfe Gods. There are fome of them three foot high, all of maffy Gold.* others of Silver bigger than the Life. The new King after all thefe Ceremonies are Over, takes his time to go and give thanks to his falfe Deities for his co ming to the Crown when the Moon firft changes, {hutting himielf up for the firfl week with the Bonnes, and living in common with them With a great deal of Frugality. During this time he vifits the principal Hofpitals, to fee how the poor people are us d, elpecially the old Folks, whom they have in great Veneration, to whom he diftri- butes new Alms • for naturally the Tunquinefes are very charitable. To conclude, he makes choice of fome fair Situation, where he orders the building of a new fagod, which he devotes to fome of his Idols. Thus his Devotion being ended, upon the firft day of the fecond Quarter, lie mounts one of his Elephants of War, attended by all the Officers of his Court on Horfe-back, and ten or twelve thoufand men on foot, chofen out of the whole Army to attend him. All the fecond Quarter the whole Court flays in a certain Plain, where are three Houles fet up, one foi the King, one for the Conftable, and one for the Prefident of the Council 5 with a world of Huts for the reft. There are alio feveral fmall Cabins fet up, which are not covered and clofed but upon one fide, which they turn as the Wind blows ^ and thefe are the places where they drefs their Vf ffcuals: For at that time the King allows two meals a day to all his Attendants. , Through this Plain runs the River of — — which is very broad in that place. Id pod this River are leveral Galleys richly gilded and painted, but efpecially the Ad miral, which exceeds all the reft in Magnificence. The Prow, the Poop, the Ropes, the Oars, but onely that part which goes into the Water, glitter all with Gold * the Ben ches very ingenioufly painted, the Rowers well clad. For there the Rowers are all Souldiers and Freemen, contrary to the Cuftom in The Souldiers in their youth are taught to handle their Oars, and have fomewhat better Pay cian the Land-Souldiers.

The feveri days being pall, the King calls before him all the Souldiers of the Galleys with their Officers, and gives them two moneths Wages extraordinary, as he does to his Land- Souldiers. 'Tis a wonderful thing to behold the vaft num ber of Fireworks which they throw about, as well upon the Land as upon die Water.

At every quarter of a Leagues end are fet up Huts, where is ready prepar'd Water to drink, and Fire to light their Tobacco. After the Pomp is over, and that the King is returned home, the Cloth is taken up and given td the Sonnes. As to the t&amp;der of their March it is thus: The two men that go formoft of all, are the two Ufhefs of the Door of the King’s Chamber, who go repeating aloud the Name of the d^Tafed King, carrying each of them a Mace of Arms, the .bole whereoi is full of artificial Fireworks. The twelve that follow, are the twelve chief Officers of the Galley, which draw the Tomb whereon the King’s Name is written. Then follows the grand Squire on Horfeback, attended by two others. Next appear twelve led Horfes, which are led two by two, fix of which have their Bridles enrich’d with thin Plates of Gold, and their Saddles embroydered.

They fet upon the Tomb of the deceafed good ftore of Viduals andComfitures, out of a belief that the dead are the better for them. For their Priefts keep them in that blind Error for their own advantage, and io well order their bufinefs, that there is nothing left by morn ing. The fame thing is pra&amp;ifed by the Cbinefes at Bata- Via, where they have a place without the Town to bury their dead, which puts me in mind of this Story : Every evening the Guard is relieved as well in the City as in the Fortrefs. At the fame time alfo they put forth eight Souidi- ers and a Corporal at each Gate of the City, who go the Rounds about the Walls of the City, and as far as within Ca* non-fliot of the Walls, being fearful of being furprifed by the King of Mataran , or 'Bontam, their Capital Enemies.

CHAP.Of the Religion and Super tfition of the Tuttquinefcs . ; j i . i:: t :' ‘ • V ] T ile Tunquinefes as to matters of Religion are divided into three Sedts: The firffc takes its original from an ancient Philolopher called Cbnfuttils^ whole Me mory is very famous over all Chirm, and the neighbouring Countries. T heir Dodtrine afferts that Man is compos’d ot two parts, the one fine and fubtil, the other material and grols; and that when Man dies, the lubtiler part goes into the Air, and the groffer part flays in the Earth. This Sect nuintains the ufe of Sacrifices, and adores the leven Planets. But among all their Gods and Idols they have four in parti cular veneration 5 the Names of thefe Gods are %itu ! inA, lie- tolo, ^aniona, and (Bratna. They have a GoddelS alfo,Vyhofe Name is Satishana, which is Hie whom the Wortieh adore 5 but for the King and the Mandarins, efpecially die more ftm dious fort, they adore the Heavens. The lecorid Sedt had fa, its Founder a certain Hermite called and is followed by the moft part of the meaner people. He has taught theni the Tranlmigration of Sonls^ and haserijbynd his Followers to obferve 10 Commandments. The fitil is, That they flrall not kill. 2. That they fhall not Ileal. That they fhall not defile their Bodies- 4. That they {ball not lye. 5. That they fhall not be un faithful in their words/ 6. That they fhall reftrain their in ordinate Defires. 7. That they fhall do injury to no nfari. $. Thta-j they fball not be great Taikers. p. That they fhall not give way to their Anger. 10. That they fhall labour to their litmoft to get Knowledge. . As for them that delign lo live a Religious Life, they mi/ft renounce the Delights of this Life, be charitable to the poor, overcome their Paffions r and give themfelvCs up to Medita tion; He taught moreover, chat after this Lite there were ten diffindf: places of joy and Torment: and that the Con temners of this Law' fhould feel Torments proportionable r: . J,!. H toA New and Particular Relation of the to their Offences, without any end of their Torments. That they that endeavour’d to fulfill his Law, and had fail’d in any point, they ifiduld wander in divers Bodies for 2000 years before they entered into happmefs. But that they who had perfectly obeyed his Law, fhould be rewarded without fiuffet ing any change of Body. And that he himfelf had been born ten times, before he enjoyed the Blifs which he poffeifed, not having in his firft Youth been illuminated with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained. This Cbacabuut was one of the greateft Impoftors that ever was in /Jia ! having fpread his Opinions over all the Kingdom of Siam, over a great part of the Provinces of Japan, and from thence into Twlquin, where he died. The third Sed is that of Lant to whofe fables the jL- ponnejes and Cbinefes give great credence, but the T mijumefes more. He. was a Cbmefe by Nation, and one of thegreat- eft Magicians in the Eaft. He made a great many Difciples, who to authorize this black Impoftor, and the more to im- poie upon the people, made them believe that the Birth of Lantbu was miraculous, and that his Mother carried him in her Womb, without lofing her Virginity, feventy years. He taught much of Chacabouts Dodrme ; but that which won the Hearts of the people was, that he ftill exhorted the Grandees to build Hofpitals in all Cities where there had been none before. Infomuch that fevcral of the Nobility betook themfelves to thofe places to look after the Sick, as did alio a great number of the Bonzes for the fame reafon. While rriy Brother was there, the Cbom, a great Enemy to thefe Vagabonds, fent for a great number of Bonzes and Says, or idle Fellows, and picking out the fbongeft and bell proportion’d. Tent them away to the Frontiers for Soul- diers. . i is the Cuflom of the Tunquinefes to adore three things in their Houfes : . The. firft is the Hearth of their Chimney made of three Stones The fecond is an Idol which they call Ttenfa, which is the Patronefs of Elandicrafts, as Sculp ture, Painting, Goldfmith’s work, &amp;c. So that when they put forth a Child to learn any of thofe Trades, before they let him work they Let up an Altar, and facrifice to this Idol, to the end he may, inhale into the Lad wit and aptnefs to learn, i he third is the Idol Buabm, which they implorean Altar, and fend lor the r Boh%es and Says to faerihce to this Idol. To this purpofe they make great preparation ot all forts of Viands, and then prelent him with leveral gilt Papers, wherein are written leveral Magic words, endea vouring by that means that he may not initer any misfortune to befall the Houfe they are going to build. There are iome TunijumeJcs that adore the Heaven^ others the Moon, and others the Stars There are alio iome that adore five parts of the Earth, making a fifth part in the middle of that which is known to us, and to them alio, but eonfufedly. When they worihip them, they have for each of the parts a particular Colour. When they adore the Northern part, they clothe themieives in black • and the Difhes and Table whereon they lay their Sacrifices are like- wife black. When they worfhip the South their Habit is red • when the Eaft, green • when the Weft, white • and when they adore the middle of the World, they wear Yellow. They offer Offerings likewife to Trees,Elephants, Horfes, Cows,and almoft to all other forts of Animals.They that fti&gt; dy the Chinefe Characters ate accuftomed eveiy fifth moneth of the year , to facrifice for the Souls ot the dead who were never buried. They believe that by fo doing their Under- ftandings (hall be more enlightned for the apprehending of all things. Every year, at the beginning of the year, they have a great Solemnity, to honour after their death thoie who in their life-time have done any noble aCtion, and were re nowned for their V alour, reckoning in that number thoie that have been fo hardy as to rebel againft their Princes, as being men of Courage. Three days before this great So lemnity, which is perform d m a large Field, they let up ieveral Altars, fome for the Sacrifices, others for the Names of the UluftriousMen whom they defign to honour.The Eve before above 4.0000 Souldiers (pend the night in this Plain, where all the Princes and 'hidyulaviiis are ordeied to meet, with their Elephants and led Horles, and the King himlelf crocs thither in perion. After they have finiiiied afi their Sacrifices, and burnt good ftore of Incenfe to the Honour of the dead, the King and all the Mandarins make three pro- id z found2 A New and Particular Relation of the found Reverences where the Altars are ; then the King (hoots with his Bow and Arrows five times againft the Al- tarSj where lie the Names of thofe that were lo rafii as to rebel againft their Sovereigns. After that the great Guns go off, and the Souldiers give three Volleys of final! Shot 3 to put all the Souls to flight. Then they burn all the Al tars, and a great number of gilt Papers, which were made life of at the Sacrifices 5 concluding all with a moft hideous ihout of all the Souldiery. Which done, the Says y and Inch like people, come and devour the Meat that was made uie of for the Sacrifices. The firft and fifteenth days of the Moneth his a wonder ful thing to hear the Chiming Din of their great Bells. For thofe are the more elpecial Holydays fet apart fortheWor- fhip of thefeGods, and all the Sonnes and Says give them more than ordinary Worfhip upon thofe days, redoubling their Prayers, and repeating upon thofe days every one of them a ftrange kind of Charm fix times over. At thefe times feveral people bring Meat and Drink to the Sepul chres of their Kindred, to facrifice for the good of their Souls to eat. The !Bon%es fail not to be there, and when the others have paid their Devoirs the ’Bonzes fall to^ and what they cannot eat they give to the poor. But for all the au- ftere Lives of thefe Bonnes and Says, neither the King nor the Mandarins make any account of them, fo that they are in credit onely with the common people. In the Kingdom of Tunquin, where the great Cities have feveral Bagents, there is hardly a Town or Village that has not one, and for every Bagod at leaft two Bonzes and two Says. But there are feme Bagods that maintain forty Bonzes and as many Says, who live in common under a Superiour, they keep to the Doctrine of Cbacabout, and a Goat is the Idol which they adore. They wear about their Necks a kind of Necklace, confiftmg of ioo Beads, very big and made of Tood. In their Hands they carry a Taff^ which is headed with a Bird ofvarniflfid Wood. They beg for their living, and arC not like the Bonzes in other Kingdoms, who beg Alms as it were their due 5 thefe on the contrary ufe all the modefty and humility that may be 5 never taking more than is needful for efeem : and if they have any thing to Ipare, they give it to the poor Widows or Orphans that cannot gettheir living. I heir Orders permit them to marry ? provi ded they leave their Monaftery. They affift at the Funerals of great where they lay a kimd of Orizon, founding their Trumpets and Carnets, while the Bells in their fawds go at the lame time. The Tunquimfes aifo have a great veneration for two Magicians, and one Magiciaaefs. The fell of their Magi cians, whom they call fay-bm, makes them believe that he knows the Events o! things to come 5 fo that when they have any occafion to marry their Children, build a Houfe, buy Land, or undertake any bulinefs of Confequence, they confult this Oracle so know what {ball happen to them. The Magician courteoully receives them, and with a coun terfeit modefty demands of them (for Example) the Age of the perfon concerned. Then taking into his hands a great Book about three fingers thick, wherein ate the Figures of Men, half Men, and leveral forts of Land and Water Ani mals, of Circles* Triangles, and Squares, he goes to work, and at the fame time puts into a Goblet three Pieces of Cop per, whereon are engraven leveral Characters onely up on one fide. After he has flhaken the Pieces in the Cup, he throws them upon the ground as at Crofs and Pile 5 if all the Characters lie undermoft he looks no further in his Book, but looks upon it as an unfortunate fign ; but if one or two Characters come up, he looks in his Book, and makes the perfbn believe what he pleales. But if all the Characters happen to turn uppermoft, then the Magician cries out, that the Party is the moll fortunate in the world. The fecond Magician is called Tbay-tPhou-Tbouy, to whom they have recourle in all their Sicknelfes. When any fick perfon comes to him, he takes a Book full of Figures like the former • onely the Form of the Book is different, for this is not above an inch thick, and about four fingers long, with eight Panes full of Cyphers. If after feveral Apilli tricks which he aCts before the fick perfon to amufe him, he affirms that the Diftemper comes from the Devil, he him- felf, together with the fick party and they that brought him, do Homage to the evil fpirit : this Homage confifts of le veral Sacrifices, and the Friends of the fick party prelent to the Devil, or rather to the Magician, a Table furnifh d with Rice and other Viands.

He not able to undergo that milerable coiirfe 0 f life, relblved with himfeif rather to die, than live in that mean condition. Thereupon having at feveral opportuni ties made a (Lift to make up a little Pack of what bethought was moft fit for the Mountainiers of me ifland^ he watch'd his time and Hole out of the Forty and took his way direilly toward the Mountains. With thefe Highlanders he liv'd four years, in which time having learnt the Trade and Lan guage of the Countrey, he ventur'd to return to the Holland ers again, who received him kindly, as being willing to underhand the Government of the People, and by what means they might traffick with them. Whereupon the young man made them this Relation. As for the Government of the People he Paid, that over every fix Villages there was an Overleer with four Counci lors, wToadminifter juftice, and punifli the finalleft Theft with Death. The Men are crucified 5 the Women are laid along upon a thick Beam of Wood, and then with a Scimi tar their Bodies' are divided into three parts. The Men are lb puniflFd for Theft or Murde^ and the Women for Theft or Adultery. If it be a Pety Larceny, not above the value of a Shilling, they give them an hundred LalTies with a Whip, and bum them in the Cheek. They that believe rhemlelvesto heunjuftly dealt with, whether in Civil or Criminal Caufe, enter their Appeal to go to the North Eaft part of the Ifland, in which divifion of the Ifiand there (lands a City by the Sea-fide, where he that commands all the Highlanders refides. At the end of our Moneth of March feveral of thefe Highlanders refort to this City, elpeciaily the Merchants, who carry along with them all their whofe Stock that they had hoarded together the year before in Morns of Oxen, Harts, Bufulo's, and Raw Hides y and then return again at the end of April, bringing back in reairn of their Commodities Japon and China Stuffs, Clothes, and Linen of the fameCountrey, and Gold and r Silver Japonefe Money, of various Coyns and Value.

He did all he could to difcover the truth, but after he had travelled two or three days Journey, the People would let him go no further. For at the end of every three or four hours travel there are Guards fet, who examine all Travellers whither they go • neither will they let their own Countrymen pafs,bnt Inch as go about their Law or to trade. Moreover he told them, that if they would give him Goods to trade withall, as Amber, Coral, Looking Glaffes • but chiefly fome Skins of the Sea Fill], which is rougher than Seal-skin, he would endeavour to get to the very City it felf where the Ships ride. Thefe Skins are greatly efteemed by the Natives to adorn the Scabbards of their Cutlafles and Swords. For ufually upon the back of this Fifih you fhall find nine little Stones, which make a kind of a Rofe, eight in a Circle and one in the middle, as you fee thefe nine difpofed in their exaft order. When the Tortugue^es traded onely to Japonj it is incredible how dear they fold thele Skins. Fojr if Na ture had well let thefe Stones at an equal diftance, and even in bignels, one of thefe Skins would yield above ten thou- fand Tiafters, and more. This Filli is caught in the ( PeryL?2 Gulph, where I have feen of them, but I faw but very few fo perfect as that which I have deferib'd, which would in thole Countries yield ten thoufand Crowns. But to return to the Story • the Governour gave the young man what he defired, and lent him going : but the Chinejes loon after expelling the Hollanders out ofthe Illand, it was never known what became of the young man. It may be wondered why Formofa was taken fo foon i but here were two Reafbns, fir ft the faint-heartednels of the Governour, and fecondly his breach of word to a French Souldier of ^ouerij calfd Abraham du Fuys • for he having lerved out his time of feven years, defifd leave to be gone, but the Governour, after he had promis'd him fair at firft, at length abfolutely refufed him. Soon after the Chinefes came to befiege the place. The Souldier thus difappointed, and feeing himlelf coop'd up who might have been free, had the Governour lo plealed, ftudied a fatal revenge upon all his Countrymen • for being by this means grown defperate, I % w.;6o A New and Particular R elation of the Watch’d his opportunity, apd flinging himfelf from the Fort into the Sea, iwam directly to the Enemy. The Gover- nour offered 200 Pieces of Eight to any perfon that would venture after him, and bring him back dead or alive. A Serjeant accepted his offer, but it was to get loofe as the other had done ; and fo they got both fafe into the Enemies Quarters. The Cbinefes preiently carried them to the Ge neral Coxtma • and he being a perfon of Valour and Difcre- tion, made very much of them, whereupon they readily and willingly inform'd him of the ftrength and condition of the Fortrefs. They alfoadvifed him to remove his Batte ries to the Weakeft part of the Town, whereas he was then affaiiing it where it was moft ftrongiy fortified : which if he would do, they afiur’d him he flrould be foon Mafter of the Fort. The General was thinking a little before they came to have railed his Siege., but upon their eiicouragetti'ent he fell on again according to their dire&amp;ion • and aslie was preparing for a general Afiault, the Holland Commander, fearful of lofing his Life and his Eftate, beat a Parley, and furrendef d the place upon Articles. During the Siegb the Hollanders made a Salley, but were beaten in again, and fourteen of their men Were taken Pri- ioners. The Cbinefes finding thole iourttei men in their power, arid remembering how cruel the Hollanders had been to their Nation when they took any of them at Sea, brought Die foiuteen men all together, put out one eye of each, cut orf their Noles, Ears, and one hand, and lo lent them back to tne Fort, with order to tell the Commander, that the Dtitcb had'taiight them that kind of Mercy. . 11 j.» i v ; J v..*~ Oi.

Of Maurice Ifland, where they cut ^ 1 ' ^ ^ Wand call'd Maurice Ifland lies almoft in 84: i degiees of Longitude, and 11 degrees of Sourhern ^ Latitude, being but 2 degrees and minutes from theTropick of Capricorn, right over ^gainft the middie of the great bland of Madagajcar, which it Has upon the Weft from whence it lies 140 Leagues, and is in compafs about 60 Leagues. It bears great quantities of Ebony : and here it was that the Hollanders did formerly fend their Slaves their baniftfd and condemn d Perfons, to cut that fort of Wood, which is Labour much more fevereand cruel than that of Rowing in the Galleys. The whole Ifland is fubjedt to thofe violent and outrageous Tempefts call'd Ouravans, which nothing can withftand/o that the People are forc'd to dig themfelves Holes in the ground, not being able to keep their Huts Handing. Neither had the poor Creatures any other Food than a little boil'd Rice, and about a Farthings worth ot Salufifli among four for a whole day. Since that the Price of Ebony being brought very low 3 the Dutch have forfaken the Ifland, the Profit not bearing the lorry Expell ees which thofe poor Creatures put them to. So loon as this Tree is cut down it muft be fawed into' Planks, and then buried feven or eight foot deep in the Earth, which ought to be fomewhat moift. There thole Planks muft lie two years, and fometimes three, if the Wood be very thick After that the Wood is fit to be wrought up on, neither will it fplinter or fplit, and will the fooner ad mit or a glittering Poliihme it. This Maurice Ifland puts me in mind of a Story, that the Sieur Loockcr told me, concerning what befell him in his Voyage from Holland to DataYia in the Year 1644. Cha Abbas thefecondof that Name, King of Terjia, having a great delire to learn to paint, fignified to the Hollanders at Hijpaban, that he defired them to lend into Holland for tome per-62 A New and Farticular Relation of the perfon who was excellent both in Deligning and Painting. Thereupon the Chief of the Fa&amp;ory wrote into Holland, and upon his Letters the Company fent away Loocker, to oblige the King; and to do him the greater honour, gave him the charge of Merchant of the Veflel, who is equal with the Captain, during the Voyage; to whom the Wind and Sea- fon was very favourable till they came to the Cape of Good Hope • but after they had doubled the Point, the Pilots bare too much to the North, whereas they fliould have fleered directly Eafl; fo that when they had made the Height of the Ifland of Madagafcar, they met with nothing but contrary Winds. For it is oblervable, that all the year long there blows but one Wind toward Maurice Illand • fo that a Ship may go thither in eight or nine days, but cannot return in thirty or forty. For you muft fleer Weftward to 30 de grees, and from thence Ball ward to 14 or 15 degrees, and then you light upon Maurice Ifland. Five days together the Ship was but rudely handled by the florm ; which at length grew fo violent, and the Sea fo boifterous, that all the great Cabin was broken to pieces, the Beak of the Ship carried away, and the Foremafl made unferviceable. Thir teen days together they remained in this miferable conditi on, tofs'cl up and down by the Sea and Wind, all which time they never faw the Sun, unable to take any height or ob- fervation where they were. The fourteenth day it cleared up, and the Sun appeared, and then taking the Height they obferved themfelves to be not far from, the Maurice Ifland, which was very true • for the next day by break of day they found themfelves not above two Leagues from the Illand ; and they found themfelves upon the North fide of the Ifland, whereas the Hollanders liv'd upon the South. And there fore perceiving that if the Wind did not change, it would be a long time, and that with great difficulty too, before they could fetch a compafs about the Ifland to come to the Fort where the Hollanders were, they call'd a Council, where it was refolved that Loocker with ten Souldiers fliould be put on fhoar, and that he fliould endeavour to get to the Fort by Land, there to make provifion of Water and Refrefh- ments for the reft of the Company, againft they coulcf come about. Maurice Ifland has this advantage, to be furnifhed with excellent Water, and great ftore of Goats, Oranges, Cure tte on it id Eiri loir tlelll 10 fente (kin A (otac kb (kg Ik wbk Ske I, * ii kk?

'Leotkir thereupon with ten Souldiers was pile on flioar in a Shallop, with Provifions for lie d.1vs. In of Was the bland in that part above eight or ten Leagues broad which they thought to travel in few days: but the Woods were fo thick, that had they not been well provided ofCar- penters Hatchets and Axes, they could never have made their way. The full day they traveil'd not above a L&amp;Wue, and the next day not above as much more, being ftill forced to hack their way along with great travel and pains. So that being now weary and fpent, they laid them lei ves upon the ground to repole themfelves, aftd get a little deep. When they wak’d they heard the voices of feveral people, which much rejoyced them, believing them to be the Slaves and poor Creatures that were cutting Ebony not far off..- Thereupon they fell to Work to get as near them as they could : but the Woods proved lb thick, that they de- fpaird of doing any good. Neverthelefs the Further they advanced, the clearer they could hear the voices of the peo ple, fomelpeaking Dutch, others Dortugutfe. Whereupon Loocker caus'd one of the Souldiers in his company that had a ftrong voice, to call out in the Dortuguefe Language, to the people to come and help them. But infteadofthat they all betook themfelves to their heels, and fled to the Commander's Lodge, telling him that there were Devils in the Woods, and that they had call’d to them in the Portugal Language. The Commander feeing both the Souldiers and the Slaves in Inch a dilmal amaze and terror, knew not at firft what to think ; however he endeavoured to refettle their diftraftion, and to revive a fort of people that were half dead with fear. The next day Be perfuaded them bo return to their Work, perfiiading them to lay afide their vain Fears, which proceeded onely from idle Apprehenfi- but they flatly denied him,tel ling him that they would ons rather die, than return to be torn in pieces by the Devil. However, others that had not been prelent at the accident, and therefore gave not lb much credit to the report, profer- ed to lee the utmoft of this bufinefs, provided any one thatA New and Particular Relation of the had heard the voice would bring them to the place. Away upon this went a good number of them together, and co ming to the place fell to work. Now becaule Loocker and his Companions having labour'd all the night before, were fallen afleep 5 for a good while the Workmen heard no voice at all, nor fo much as any thing ftirring, fo that they began to laugh at thole that had brought them thither, who ftill obftinately maintained the truth of what they had heard. This Difpute at length began to grow fo hot and fo loud that at length they wak'd Loocker and his Fellows, who be ing now got nearer to them by means of their laft nights la- bour, heard diftindly every word they faid, and notwith- ftanding their diftrefs could not chufe but laugh. Soon af ter Loocker and the Souldiers call'd out again, Work toward us, they cried, we are Hollanders, come and help us out of the Wood, and we mil.put an end to the dijfute. But the Workmen no looner heard them, but away they ran for their Lives, and when they came to the Lodge, they were fo har'd, fo fear'd, and quite out of breath, that the Governour in vain endeavour'd to get the lead tittle of a word from them. At length being come to themfelves, theyaflur'd him that it was too true that the Devils were in the Wood, and that the more to deceive and wheedle them, to day they had not onely fpoken Vortuguefe, but Dutch too. This put the Go vernour and all into a deep Confternation, inlomuch that they were all at their Wits end. But the next morning Loocker- and his Gang having made their way through, the Centinel fpied them firfl: from the Fore, and by the dif- charge of his Mufquet gave notice of the approach of the Devils. And then it was that the poor affrighted Mortals, laying afidc their fears, and going forth to meet their own Shapes, found them to be a company of their Countrymen in diftrefs, whom they then received into their kindnefs, to give an account of their Misfortunes.

There is no Cavalry in Europe fo well clad or mounted as his • the Horlemen all upon Ecrfian or Arabian Steeds. Nor is his Foot Guard lefs fumptuous: His Halberdiers wear their yellow Satten Doublets, Scarlet Breeches lac'd with Silver Lace, and their Silk Stockins. But this onely for the General's Guards • for thofe which they fend abroad to their Forts and Garrifons, it is a great pity to fee how poorly they are attir’d, and how meanly fed.

This was Nuts to the Captain: lb that being return'd to Batavia, h&amp; wviBX he went immediately to vifit the Ge neral, and deliver him the Letters which concerned the Car go. immediately according to cuftom the General invited him to dinner, at which time it is ufual for the General to inform himfelf of the Condition of the Factory. Among the reft of the queftions the General asked the Captain whe ther he had any Counterband Goods aboard, or any that were not upon the Company's foie account. To which the Captain anfwered, that all the Goods belonged to the Company, except four Bales, which the chief Fador at Mafhp&amp;tan had particularly recommended to his care^ as be longing to Madam General. This being publickly fpoken in the prefence df a great many that were at Table, the Lady &amp;hat was not aware of foch a blow, was not a little furpnTd, and thd Generali himfelf was not a littie iri wrath, fternly ask'd her how fire durft undertake to trade without his knowledge. Prefently ftie denied the whole matter, and averred that the Captain was miftaken,and took her for feme other perfon. But the General lent for the Pifcal, and or der'd him to go forthwith with the Captain, and fetch the four Bales afhoaf 5 which being done, he order'd further that the Goods fliould be carried into the public Hall of the Town Houfe, with a Writing fix'd upon them, that who ever own'd thofe Goods fhould come and claim them • but Ho body same.

The Fleet being ready to depart, there was a Cabin built on purpoie for this Niece, and the Company having pre~ fented her with feveral pieces of TifTue and Silks, recom mended her to C. the Viceadmiral’s care.- This Cap tain had been feveral times at the Indies before, and was both rich and a Batchelour : fo that when the Ship was Out at Sea, he fail’d not to fliew all the refpeits imaginable to this Niece. Now this young Virgin not being accuflomed to the Sea, upon the lean: guft of Wind flie was half dead 5 and all that time the Captain would not ftir from her Bed- fide, for fear any Accident fhould befall her. And as he was thus diligent not to ftir from her Bed-fide in fowl, ’tis verily believ’d he was feldom far from it in fair weather ; and that inftead of fitting by her Bed-fide, he (bmetimes got fairly into it. But whether he were within or without, moft certain it is, that before Madam Niece arrived at B.i- tavia, ftie found her felf to be with child, though {he fb difcreetly concealed it, that none in the Veflel percei ved it. , . , , , The Vefiel had no {boner paffed the Strait that lies to ward 'Bantam, but Madam General with a great number of her Friends in feveral little Barques came out to meet Ma dam Niece, and were not a little furprized to find her to be a perfon fo well clad and handfom withall, without any appearance of what fihe had been before.

The She General who look'd up on herfelf to be a kind of a Queen at Batavia, look'd upon it as a high offence and indignity for a Tarpaulin Captain of a Ship to dare to make her luch a Propofal 3 having alrea dy refus'd fuch Matches, perfons that might come to be Privy Gounfellors of all the Indies. Neverthelefs within a day or two after the Captain renewed his Charge, but then in a Ma jeftic Fury fhe utterly forbid him the Fort.

Jr After the Hollanders had taken feveral Prizes from the (portugue^es by Sea, they wanted a place of Retreat, where they might repair their endamaged Ships, and repofe after' the toils of the Sea. At firft they caft their eyes upon the Ifland of Java, in that place where the Englifh had built a fmall Convenience for their Trade. There is a Road in that part, where Veflfels ride fecurely all the year, into which a River dilcharges it lelf that will receive Shallops of good burthen, for above a thoufand Paces. The Water of this River is moft excellent • for being carried never fb far to Sea, it never ftinks, nor engenders Worms • which can only be faid of the Thames and befides. The Hollanders therefore came and lay upon the point of a River, over againft the place where the Englif? had their fmall Houfe. They had with them then the greateft part ofthe Ships which they had in the Indies, laden with thofe great Bales of Cloth which come from Demale and the Coaft C? cn t of Surat, fo big that a dozen men can hardly manage them. Thde Bales they landed, and of them made a kind of Forti fication, planting a good number of great Guns between them : For they never wanted great Guns ever fince they traded alone to Japon, the onely Kingdom of the World abounding in Copper • from whence they brought prodigi ous quantities to Macao and Goa, where they call their Artil lery. ThusA New and Particnlar Relation of the ^ N ---' — —ili Thus the Hollanders thought that by Sea no body could endamage their (mail Fortification, made of Bales of cloth, which was defended by their Veflels Which they had in the Road: But by Land they were afraid that the King of the Ifland, vizj either of Materan or bantam i might di~ fturb them. Qbferving therefore the Situation of the Ifiand, which on that fide was all covered with Woods, which reached on that fide within a League of the Sea and that where they ended, to the Shoar there was no other way but a Bank, which feparated the Marfh from the River; So that the Hollanders the better to fecure themfelves againft the two Kings, refolved to raife aTower upon the Bank. In this Tower they planted feveral Culverins and finall Pieces, cramm'd with artificial Wildfire, and every evening relieved thsir Guards. The King of Materan perceiving this, and believing that the Hollanders would not flop here, advanced a powerful Army to pull down the Tower. To which purpofe he brought with him great Chains of Iron, and Cables made of the Coco Flax 5 believing that by the favour of the Night, having got his Chains and Ropes about the Tower, by the ftrength of his Men and Elephants he might eafily pull it down. But having faiFd in his Enterprize,and for that the Hollanders Artillery kill’d him abundance of Men, he retreated with his Army. But it was not long be fore he return’d again with a more powerful Force by Land, and alfo a great Fleet of fmall Veflels to aflifl: him by Sea. With thefe Forces he gave a furious Onfet a lecond time, which the Hollanders with no lefs vigour fuftained, and beat him off. But nothing difeouraged with his lofs, he refolved to give a third Onfet, onely he flaid fome few days in expe ctation of more Forces. Inthemean while one of the moft: confiderable Captains of his Army was accus’d to the King not to have done his .Duty: though leafonably advertiz’d that the King was re- folv’d to feize upon his perfon, and cut him to pieces. For you muft know, that among the Javans when any perfon has merited Death, they tie the Offender all along upon a great piece of Timber, and the next Lord or great perfon that has a mind to try the goodnefs of his Scimitar, comes and cuts the Body into four pieces, the firfl: ftroak being made upon the Breft, the fecond upon the Pit of the Stomach, ther third upon eke lowes part of . the Belly ^ The if they be Men, are burnt: • if Women, tllrown'ed the. bo®s, which they keep for that purpefe.

To insraciase himfelf, he told the 'Dutch General all the Kang's Detigns m reference to the carrying the place ; where he would make his Onfct, and what number of men he had. This however did not foffi- ctently cheat up the General, who* knew his own Weaknefi. So that the ja^mefe perceiving him ftill penfive, I find (faid be) that thou art afraid of the King’s firength, and reafon thou haft, bat be rat’d by me : Thou aft not ignorant that the Javanmn are rigid Obfervets of the Law of Mahomet, and that if any Uncleannefs from a Chriftian hand falls upon their Clothes, they fling them* a way, and fpend fix whole days in wafhing themlelves, before they believe chemfelves dean. Hdar theity faid he | let all the Ordure and Dung of the; People chat are with thee be heaped in a place together, and made fluid in Pots for that pikpofe ; and when they mount their Ladders, fpare not for’Showres of that Liquor, and I warrant ye they will retreat falter than they came on. Farther continued he 5 I know that the points of their Ar rows and Cries are poiforfd, and that this poifon is fb ftrong, that whoever are wounded therewith die itiddenly, unkfsthey have recoitrle to this onely Rerhedy • which is to preierve their own Excrement, and to dry it to powder - and when they find themlelves wounded’, to take a little of the powder, and drink it off in a finall Beet-glafs of Water. The General obferving what the Lord had faid,w’heit the Enemy mounted their Ladders, luftilybelmeafd them with the Liquor,which he caus'd to be prepar'd againfi: their coming • fo that inftead of gaining the tops of their Ladders, they made all the hafte they could do#n again • but being hindred by thole that follow'd them, they threw themfelres headlong to the ground • by which mearts feveral of therri Were maimed, and leveral kill'd outright. Thus the Artriy disbanded in a moment, and the Emperotir was the firft that took his flight. Vanderbroug obferving the diforcferly Re treat of the Enemy, took a final! Party ridih and puf-A New and Particular R elation of the fu'd the flying Enemy, who being enclofed by thofe in the Fort, that Tally'd out upon them, Were tniferably etlt in pie- ‘ ces. But the General having left the greatdF patt of his men, and returning onely with a fniall and very incorifider- able Company, the JaVanners who had hid themfelves in the Merfhes for fear, relum'd courage^ and fuddetlly fell up on him in his return, and fo encbmpafs’d him otl evOry fide^ that it was impoflible for him to efcape. However they de fended themfelves ftoutly for a while, but being wounded with the Arrows and Cries of the Indians, and riot being provided of the forementioned Antidote, they died imme diately. The General was taken alive, not fo much as wounded 5 for as he told me afterwards himfelf, he found they had no defire to kill him. So foon as he was taken they carried him to the Emperour, who as foon as he law him bid him not fear any thing, but told him withally that it was his pleafure, that he lliould command his Men to quit the Fort and Tower, and be gone • otherwife that he Would make both him , and all thole that lliould fall into his Hands, perpetual Slaves. At the fame time the Empe rour with his principal Officers, and the General with a good Guard, came to the Foot of the Wall of the Tower, where the General in the Malay Language, laying before them his own misfortune, and the improbability of their holding out long, commanded them to quit the Fort, after they had embarqued whatever they law fitting, but onely 6 Pieces of fmall Canon, 200 Bullets, and 500 Quintals of Powder. The Emperour was overjoy'd to hear what the General faid, and thought himfeli lure of the Fort and Tower. But then the General turning to the Emperour, told him, that none of his men underftood Malay, and that therefore it would be convenient for him to repeat the lame in ilemijh* Which being granted, he Ipoke to the Souldiers in Flemifh&gt; and ordered them quite the contrary • that is to fay, that they Ihould not be Traitors to their Countrey, but hold out the place till death, not minding what became of him • and to that end, that they fhould bid the Infidels forthwith re tire, or elfe they would immediately fire all their Guns up on them. The Emperoitr aftonilh'd at their Relblution re treats, and carries the General with him. Being thus re tir'd, the General made him believe that he would find a means ( i# 1 ' Iflte Ifife, |nieai fjfrec Ik( jtnices nation iereth ikfsa ion at tli mfelf te oft ice, Oned M bi Sites, a iBag&lt; aa (eve It was 1 id i) dofti; ind 1 louod kingri iliin Mere iitia: k°f did:s X [iltllj %: % % m swiltl ■t it®. ttlls fail lit feta ittie jond m han H W ;esof jttlet.

In the mean while the General found an Opportunity td get into a imall Barque } and to get to the Edi ; t;where he was joy fully receiv'd. This Recital I had from his own mouth. The General having done this and feveral other erriinerit Services for the Company, and acquitted himfelf with Re putation and a fair Eftate, was delirous to return home, where the Prince of Orange, and feveral of the States had no lefs a defire to fee him. Streight he took up his Habita tion at the Hague, and for a good while liv'd fplendidly- gave great Prefents and Entertainments to the Prince, and feveral other Grandees of Holland, by which means he rari himfelf into fo great an Expence, that he was forc'd to de fire of the Company, that he might return into their Ser- vice* * ■'' • One day the Prince of Orange asking him what Rarities he had brought out of the Indies, he call'd for five Silver Plates, and fetting them upon the Table, drew out five little Bags out of his Pocket, and emptied a leveral Bag up on a feveral Plate ; which furpriz’d not onely the Prince, but feveral others of the States then preient, to lee fuch a number of Diamonds and other Jewels of a vaft value. It was not without lome difficulty that he was again en tertain'd by the Company ; but at length they lent him Ad miral of two Ships to Batavia, where being arriv'd, the Ge neral and Confuls made him Admiral of the Fleet that was juft bound for the Coaft ol Coromandel, Surat, and Berjia. Being return'd to Batavia,General and the Coun cil fent him to Malaca, which the Hollanders then befieg'd, and where they found a ftouter refiftance than they imagin’d.

This Bark caufes the Tary and Sugar to boil and ferment like new Wine. When the Tary and the Sugar have fermented for above ieven or eight hours, they diftill them in an Alembic, and make Strong Water, which is ftrpnger or finaller, by how much the more often or ler it is is full of Cows; for they are all Idolaters in this Country, that onely worjlhip their Cows for their Gods, feed upon their Milk, and eat nothing that has Life.

After the taking of Cochin, of which we have given a full Relation in our Indian Travels, General Vangom, whocom- manded^atthe Siege, became fo haughty that he delpis’d all the other Officers, as well Military as thole that belonged to the Government and Juftice of the City. However to recompence one of the ^ajas by whole means he had ta ken the City, he perluaded him to quit the Name of %aja, and to alfume the Title of that he might have the Honour to let the Crown upon his Head. To this end he made great inquiry through his whole Army for a Gold- jfnich, 4 of Mi kip di 2 ( iQiO im\\ i Tfc&lt; 'ineei] botnet •‘tei t) 1 ?)2ni ^.nie l lCr ier( ^fOf]Countrey about Cochin irnfth, and having found out one that undertook it, and caus'd him to make a Crown of maffie Gold, that weigh'd near ten Marks, which I believe the found more im convenient and weighty upon his Head, than an old Muc- kenaei with thiee coineis oouhq a'oouc nis I _ ieaci ; \vhicii is the mark of the ^{ajas Sovereignty, While they were making this Crown there were great preparations for the Ceremony : It was performed in a Gar 7 den near the Town, where was fee a large Tent fpread all over with painted Calicut. Within was a Throne erected with a Canopy of Cb'ma Damask, and all the Steps to the .Throne were cover'd with Qerftan Tapiftry. T he day being come, the greateft part of the Army,Offi cers and Souldiers* went to fetch the who lay in his Hut a quarter of a League off 5 where they mounted him upon one of two Elephants which the General lent him, be ing attended iikewife with two led Horfes, and two Talm- cjuins for more State, Being come to the place, he was clad in a Scarlet Robe with great Hanging Sleeves,and fo brought in where Vangows was fitting upon his Throne , with a Sword and a Crown by him. The (Rgtja being come to the Foot of the Throne, the Major of the /\rmy took the Sword, deliver'd him by the General, and girt the ^aja, who then afcending the Steps of the Throne, proftraced himfelf be fore the Holland General while he put the Crown upon his Head. Then the new King rifeth up, and lays his Hand upon the Head of a Cow that flood near the Throne. Which done, kneeling with his Hands clafp'd, and lifced toward the Head of the lame Cow, he took his Oath to be true and faithful to the Company, and to embrace their IntereAs. On the other fide the General promis'd him on the behalf of the Company, that they fliould affifl him when he fhould have occahon againfl his Enemies. Which Solemnities be- ing very gravely perform'd, the Mufquettiers gave three Volleys, and the new King was conducted back to his Hut wflh the fame Pomp that he was brought. Thus you fee the Pride of a Pepper Merchant, to make Kings and domineer over Crowns. One other famous AT of Varmus muft not be fomottem You muft know, that at the caking oS: Cochin the Jefuits had in thaH City one of the fiireft Libraries in all Jf a ) as wellA 'New and Particular Relation of the for the great quantity of Books feme them out of Europe] as for feveral rare Manufcripts in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, ferfian, Indian, Chinefe, and other Oriental Languages. For in all the Conquefts of the fortugals, their iirft care was to fummon ail the Learned People of the feverai Nations, and to set all their Books into their hands. During that little time which the Jcfuits ftaid in /Ethiopia they had copied out all the good Books that came to their knowledge, and feat all thole Books to Cochin, They had ftaid longer in Ethio pia, had it not been for the Jeaipufte of the Patriarchs, and their Bilhops, which are very numerous • la that if there be two men in one Village that belong to one Cntirch 5 the cniei- eft calls himfelf Bifhop, At their' Ceremonies of Baptifm when they name the Holy Ghoft, they apply a hot Iron to the neck of the Infant, faying that the Hely Ghoft dekended upon the Apoftles in the fhape of Fiery Tongues. The Pa triarchs and Bifliops were jealous of the Jefuits, finding that they had infinuated themfelves into the favour of the king and Grandees of the Court. Which lo enraged the Ethiopi ans, that they caus'd the People to mutiny, preaching that the King was about to alter the Religion of the Country,and to draw along with him leveral ol the Lords. And the Fury of the People grew to that height, that whatever the King could do or lay, he could not appeafe their Fury '. So that they put him in prifon, and eledled his Brother in his place. The caufe of this diforder was laid upon the Jefuits, and was the reafon that they were expell'd the Kingdom • neither had they icap'd fo, but that they were afraid of the Governour of Mozambique, and the ^Portugals that inhabit all along the Coaft of Africa. But to tell ye what became of this Library, General Vangous made no conlcience to expofe it to the ignorance of his Souldiers, fo that I have leen the Souldiers and Seamen tear leveral ofthofe beautiful V olums to light their Tobacco. tM H fit Ufa 1 To loch iCrin icre| iil\y W( CHAP*the Sicur Hoilcbranti Glins, of at Ormus.

To remedy thefe -Inconveniences Sieur Hollebrand refol- ved to build a bigger War eh onfe. Among the reft oi the Workmen that were imployed in this Building was a Gun- fmith, who came in the interim in a Ship from ButaVia. This poor Fellow was imployed to make Locks for the Warehoufe • for in thofe Parts they have no other Keys, or Locks either, than what are made of Wood * So that it was a Crime for him to be found idle at any time. And there fore the Prefident finding him one Sunday in the Afternoon drinking with two of his Companions that came from the Ship to fee him, gave the Fellow half a dozen good Licks with his Cane, and would have given him more, but that the Smith being a fturdy Fellow, and feeling the Blows fmart, wrefted the Stick out of the Preiident s Hands, and flung it out of the Window. For which the Prefident, upon pre tence that the Fellow had ftruck him four Blows, whicn was untrue, as I mv felf being there could witnefs, fent him la den with Chains to the Ship, where he would have tried him for his Life, in a full Court of the Merchants of the Fa- dory : but they refufing him, for very madnefs heA New and Particular R elation of the two Notaries, that he had a power over, went to the Ship alone, made’the Officers of the Ship, and condemn'd the Fellow to be hang’d.

For the perfefting of which Work the Hollanders wanted Slaves: whereupon a Confiiltation was had where to get Slaves. To which Anfwer was made that there was no better place than the PrinceVlflands. Which being concluded, the General of Batavia difpatch'd away three the biggell Ships belonging to Batavia.

Being arriv'd at Ormus he left the Fleet there, and haften'd to Iftahan, and from thence to Casbin, where then the King was. But his Embaffie had not that efFedt as he expefted : For he thought that the King would have been frighted at the node of a Fleet of feven great Ships that lay at Ormus, but he was miftaken. For the Perfean knew he need not fend any Force againft the faid Fleet, in regard it would be ruin'd without: It being ^mpofiible for our Europeans to flay at Ormm in the heat of Somer, as well by reafon of the Heat, as for want of Water ; for there is no good Water at Ormus&gt; nor upon any part of theCoaftof Perfia, but what is kept in Cifterns, and that full of Worms. 'Tis true, that upon the Coafl of Arabia there are Wells of good Water, but when the Arabians dif cover any Ships upon the Coail, they comedown all in Arms to defend their Wells; for it is their profit to fell their Water, and that at a very dear rate, to thole that are in ne- ceflity. Now the King and Council not being ignorant, that the longer the Fleet lay at Onnus, the worfe would be its con dition, would not give the Commander his firft Audience in two moneths. During which time there died above half the Men; for from lix a clock in the morning till four in the afternoon , if any of the Seamen went to take a little Air upon the Deck, he prefently fell down dead. The Admi ral was to blame not to make provifion of Water being bound for flich a place as Ormus.

For the Lords of Terjlt never take any Prefents themfelves, for fear it fliould come to the King's Ear. But there is a private Bill fent to the Party for whom it is intended^ and he fends whom he thinks fit to receive it. Had he fo done, and doubled his Sum of rooo Venetian Ducats, perhaps the Jtbemadoukt might have us'd him more kindly, efpecially for fo long time as that King had. For whatever a, PredecelTor does, a Succeffor changes many things. So that if the decealed King have given any Houfe or Land to any perfon, itmufl: be confirm ed by the fucceeding King in his firftYear, or elle the Gift returns to the King. It is the fame thing if any perfon builds a Houfe upon the King's Demefns : which has been a great inconvenience to the Aujhn Friers and bare-foot Carmelites^ becaufe their Houfes are built upon the Lands which Cha Abbas gave them of the Royal Demefns. -So that every time a new King afcends the Throne, they are forc'd to make the Jthemadoulet new Prefents, fomttimes to the Value of the Land: for it is a rare thing to find a prime Minifter that is a Friend to the Chriftians. But the Jefuits and Capuchins, who came after them, provided better for themfelves, each of thofe Orders having bought the Ground upon which their Houfes are built. The Commander feeing that he could notcompafs his Defign, and that the Jthemadoulet would abate nothing of the forty four Tomans which he demanded, went to the Divanbegai and told him, that buying the fame Goods of particular perfons, they might be had for thirty two, or at moft for thirty three Tomans. To which the 'DVanbegal nn- fweredhim, That all thofe particular perfons paid the King Cuftom, and Convoy upon the Road, the Cuflom alone amounting to Eighteen per cent, which the Hollanders did not pay : and that there was not a Year wherein they did not bring in Goods to the Value of 3 0000 Tomans ; and that if account fhould be taken of the Silks which they carried away, and of the Goods which they brought in, the doulet ought to make them pay near 50000 for Du ties. The Commander ill fatisfied with this Anlwer went to his Lodging, and without asking the Advice of the Mer chants that were with him, or of his Frenchman, who better underflood the Pradice of the Court, or without taking his M leaveA New and Particular Relation leave of the King, return'd privately to Mahan intending for ‘Bander where the Fleet lay. The Atbemadoukt being arfvemz d of his hidden departure, was very much offend ed ; fo much the more becaufe at the Commanders firft Ar rival he had done him great Civilities, even to the furnifii- ing his Lodgings after the European manner, with a Bed Stools, and fables. Thereupon he gave notice thereof to the King, who when he heard of it utter'd thefe words Hcos any one given him any dijlafte, or is he turn’d Fool? He (hall he glad to come back again* J Being come to Ijpahan, to the great wonder of the Franks who heard nothing of his taking leave of the King he be- gan to make up his Pack, intending for Gomrom, in cafe the King did not lend for him again,- which he did, 'tis true but not with thofe Compliments which he expected - for he flatter d h &gt;mfelftbat the King would have petition'd him to um - The King lent fot him indeed,but his Compliment was not very pleafing ; for the perfon that brought the Meflage told him, That it was the King's pleafure hefliould fpeedily return and if he would not go willingly he had Older to carry him by force.

G Eneral Speck, before he came to his Imployment, had a Daughter by a Woman which he kept onely as his Miftrefs, not as his Wife. After his time; was out he returned into Holland, and not being willing to carry his Daughter along with him, knowing that fhe would go off better at HataVia than in Holland, left her to the care of General Com, who fucceeded him in his charge. The Girl was fair and left rich, fo that her Father was no fooner gone, but fhe had many Suitors that courted her, without any confideration of her Birth, among all which there was none that fhe fancied, like one that was a Superior Merchant of the Fort, for whom fire had a particular efteem. Nei ther did fhe believe but that General Com would have given his confent upon the firft requeft, knowing the young man to be of a good Family. Neverthelefs they were both de ceiv'd • for being ask’d, he utterly denied to yield to any ’ M z fuch84 A New and Particular Relation inch matter. However, the young Man and the Maid con tinued their Fidelity to each other, and that with fuch a clofe relpeft, that at length the Virgin's Belly began to fwell V hereupon flie made one of the Ladies of the City acquaint ed how the cafe flood, as alfo of her Council, believing mat the General upon notice how Affairs went, would mar 1 y her to keep all things private. But fo foon as the Lady had revealed the Myflery, he was fo far from anfwering tneir expectation, that he threw the young Man laden with Fetters into pnfon, and fhut up the young Woman clofe r n oner m her Chamber. Next day he call'd a Council declard to them the Matter of Fad, and gave his Opinion’ that the young man deferv'd to lofe his Head, and that the Maid fnould be whipp'd. The Council were of a contrary J udgmenc, and advis d him to reconcile the Mifchance by a Marriage. But notwithftanding all their perfuafionT the General refolv d to have his own humour, the next day pri- vately fent for the Executioner, and caufing the young xMan and the Maid to be brought into his Hall, commanded the Man s Head to be forthwith ftruck off, and the Virgin to be whipp d though big with Child. The Sieur Goyre commanded the Holland Fleet that was lent to the he landed all his Souldiers, and moft of his Mariners.

This Couple had been feven years married without any Children ;- fb that the Woman defpairing of her Husband's Abilities, and to know where the fault lay, refolved to beftow her Fa vours upon one of her Slaves, who was well ihap’d but ve ry black • chufing rather a private Familiarity with him,than with any young Hollander, whofe frequent Vifus might breed fufpicion. It feems the fault did not life in her, for her Sable Gallant had fo improv’d his Talent, that in a fhort time Hie found the effects of Change. In Ihort, the Wo mans Belly fwell’d, and her Husband thinking his time had been 5 come, began to boaft of his Manhood, and great Joy there was among the Friends of the Woman upon the hopes of Iflue. Great Provifions were made againft the Lying in, and the General himfelf made choice of for Godfather. But when the good hour was come, and the Woman delivered their Toy was turned into Mourning, for the Cnild piov d one of the footy Qf-fpring of the Sun-burnt race, a perfect Black. The Husband and Mother of the W oman blufh d as red for flume as the Child was black, and the Gomps hung down their heads like Bulruflies : nay the Husband was lo tranfported with fury, that he could not hide his relolution to murder his Wife, for bringing fuch a piece of hve Char- cole into the world. But he was prevented, and lecur d in the Fort by the General, till by the intermiffion of Friends, who wifely laid before him the original caule of his WilesA New and Particular Relation of the Tranfgreffion, they were ac length made Friends, and the Slave for having fhew’d himlelf a Man, was condemn'd to tug at the Oars m the Galleys that go to fetch Stone for the life of the City. , Now as a White Woman may bring forth a Black f 0 lometimes a Black may be deliver'd of a White Child For at Bar atm a Cafe/s Wife, as black as himfelf, was deli, ver d of a white Child. The Cafer feeing his Child white would have immediately fallen upon his Wife and ftranded her, had not the good women that affifted at her Laboir prevented him, and one of thofe Goffips was fo cunning as to run to the Jeluits Houfe, who are well refpeftel by thole Blacks, to defire Father Thomas de Bare, who had a long time been Redor at Agra, to come to the Houfe 1 relent y the Father came with another of the Fraternity and finding the Cafer ftamping and flaring almoll out of his wits, and in open hollihty without all reafon, to ap- peafe his fury ask d him whether he kept any Hens and -whether he had any that were black.

Though for all the jeliut s Companfon it was believ'd that fome Bovtmal ^culcuer had quarter'd with his Wife, which was the reaion Ge r.jat more than ulual Production. To condude thcre was a certain woman, the wife of one of the Counlellors of BataVia, who had both kindnefs and affection for a Merchant of the Fort, who was both young and handiom. And it is the Cuftom in that Coun- rrey to oe not onely kind but free, fhe had for feveral years 10 well lupphcd his wants, that he was Company for the belt. It happen’d that this Counfell or was fent abroad up-on feme Negotiation, and ftaid longer than he thought he Should have done. For this reafon Money grew Short with the Lady ; fo that her Gallant coming for a Supply, and {he not having ready money to anfwer his Expectations, She gave him a Gold Chain worth 400 Crowns to pawn for his prefent Neceffities till {he could redeem it. But this Fatal Chain was the diffolution of all their former Love: For the young Gentleman being ftreighten’d for Money, and find ing no perfon that would lend him fo much Money as he wanted upon it, very fairly goes and offers it to a Goldfmith to fell. While this unfortunate Lover was driving his Bar gain in the Shop, who in the name of ill luck Should come by but one of his Miftreffes Slaves, and Spying the Chain in his hand, runs and tells her Patronefs how She had Seen her Gallant imploy'd. Who Surpriz'd that her Gallant Should go about to fell the Chain, when he had onely promis’d to pawn it in private and Sure hands ; now (quoth She) all will out, there will be the Devil upon Dun when my Husband comes home • and I forfooth that have liv'd credibly thus long, muft be the {port of my Neighbours and the talk of the Town..

She alfo gave the fame notice to the chief of the Chinefes, anddefir'd the Advocate Fifcal to make a public Search. Well, by thefe means the Chain was quickly found, and the Merchant whatever he could fay for himfelf was apprehended and put in prifon 5 loon after he was condemned for a Thief, and Sentenced to tow all his life in the Stone Galley, which is the Galley that fetches Stones for the u(e of 'Batavia. But happy for him, General Vanderhris Lady falling into a hard Labour before the time of Executibn, and defiring his Pardon at fech a Solemn Juncture, eafily obtain’d it, teafonably reco vering him from the Misfortunes of Folly and Neceffity.RELATION OF A M £&gt; Of the Caufe of the ‘Perfecntion of the Cbriftians in thofe ISLANDS, H E Modern Geographers have made Defcriptions of by means of fuch conjedures as they have drawii from the Relations of certain Mer chants who have traded in thofe Countries. But in regard there are very few Merchants who are skilful in Geography , as being fuch who only mind the profit and advantage of their Voyages, thofe Defcriptions have prov’d very uncertain. As to the knowledge of the Ancients 3 in reference to this part of the World, it is no lefs imperfed; and it is but only by conjcduretothisday, that we believe the of Ptolemy to be that Ifland which is now calfd Niphon. That which I could learn of moft certainty, was by the Relation of feveral perfons who have Traveled thefe parts, that the Empire of Jap on is at prefent compos d of leveral lilands, of which fbme perhaps may not be ablblute Iflands, but rather Peninfula s , and particularly thofe that make a part of the B LandLand of Teffo, the Inhabitants whereof are VaiTals and Tributaries to Japov. Neverthelefs a Holland Pilot, who has been induftrious to dilcover whether the whole Country it felf were an Ifland, ora Continent adjoyning to thatvaft Trad of Land call’d unknown to this day 3 in diofe parts where it extends it felf behind to the bottom of Tartarie Nudhan, faith) that it is feparated from Jafon by a narrow Sea, which at this day is call’d 'the sfreights of Sanguar. Through all the Iflands of Japon, where formerly were accompted to have been 66 Kingdoms, there are three remarkable for their largenefs, of which that of largeft extent is called Niphon , the next^/^0, and the third Xicock. The Japonners accompt it a Journey of twenty feven dlys from the Provincf of , to tfe Country of rdjfo; and they 1 %farther, that this Country 4 f Ycff 0 * in tjioie parts which are remote frOmliieSea , is fo full of inacceffible Mountains, that thofe $afohners who have attempted a difeovery by Land , could never accomplifli their defign, being difeourag’d by the length of the Journey, and the difficulties and badnefs of the ways. The Ifland of Niphon is four times as big as the other two 5 and there is alfo a Mountain thereia that vomits up Flames of Fire, like Mount Etna in Sicih s fomnerly it was dilfinguwd into thirty five Kingdoms, but at %is day it is only divided into five parts, the names whereof are Jamafoit , Jet fen, Jetfefen, Quanto, and Ocfotf, lying all in order as you travel from Weft to Eaft. Thefe five parts are again divided into feveral Provinces. The Ifland of Ximo, or Say cock, is fitnated to the South-Weft of Niphon, being abOwMtfo Leagues in circuit. The Ifland of Xicock is feated by the South of Niphon, being about 120 Leagues in compifs. The other Ifl a rids that lye round about are not lo confiderable, for in thofe Seas lye fevbral Iflands fcatter’d up arid down, as in the Archi pelago , between the Morea and the Coafts of Afia the Jefs. As to the reft, I refer the Reader to the Map annexed, believing it to be very true, as having been made upon the places themfelves. The Emperour at prefent keeps his Court in the City of Teddo/m regard the Air is there more temperate , and the Heats not fo violent 5 but when he has a Son that is arriv’d to the Age of fifteen years, he fends him to Surunga, there to refide, till the death of his Father makes him way to the TKrone. Since Ted do has been made choice mf for the Seat of the Empire, it has. fo greatly eslarg’d it felf from day to day, that it is at prefent three Leagues in length, and three in breadth, very populous, and the Houfes ftanding very elofe together. When the Emperour rides through the City, or that there is any publick fhew to be feen 9 it is impoffible to get by the crowd of the people, though the Women are not permitted to be of the number. The Emperours Palace is cover’d with Plates of Gold, to which the Palaces of the Lords are every way correfpondent in Mag nificence 5 fo that afar off the City affords the richeft and moft magnifi cent Profped: that was ever beheld: Though it be not fo beautiful within, by reafon that the ordinary Houles are built only of Wood. The Great Dairy keeps his refidence at Meaco , which is alfo a very large City, containing above a hundred thoufand Houfes * it was formerly the capital Seat of the Empire, at what time the Dairy's were laid afide. So foon as he is Crown’d by the Bonzes , who are the Priejis and Lawyers, beds then no more toexpafe himfelf to the light of the Moon, nor to(have his Head, or cut his Nails. The Natives report, that the Empire of Japon was formerly govern’d by a Prince call'd Dairy, who had acquir’d fo high a reputation for Holinefs, that his Subjects ador’d him as a God, and that to increafe the awe and reverence of the people, he fuffer’d his Hair and Nails to grow, affirming, that it it was a piece of Sacriledge to make ufe either of Razor or Sizzars. The Princes that fucceeded him, though they had only the name of Kings, have ftill preferv’d the fame cuftom, believing that it becomes not their Gran deur to appear in view of the Moon, as being Sons of the Siw. ]f he have a Daughter that is ripe for Marriage, the Emperour is oblig’d to Marry her , and (he it is that bears the Title of Emprefs, though fhe fliould happen to have no Children, which is contrary to the Maxims of all the Eaftern Monarchs , who give the Title of Queen and Sulta- nefsonly to her, among all the reft of their Wives, that is firft brought to Bed oft a Male Succeflbr to the Crown. At the end of every feven years , the Emperour fends one of the chief Princes of his Court to the Dairy with a Basket full of Earth, and to tell him, that all the Lands which the Emperour commands, are at the Dairy s Devotion-, and indeed the Empire belongs to him by right of Succeffion , though at prefent he enjoys only the title, and very large Revenues, which render him highly confiderable in the Empire. The Jap owners are Idolaters, and adore the Sun -, but though they have a great number of Temples and different Idols, yet they are not over obftinate in their Devotion, only the Emperour is very fevere againft all other Religions. They never ftir out of their Native Country to travel, unlefs it be to China ^ and the Land of Yeffo; and within thefe few years the Emperour has prohibited his people under extream penal ties, from having any Commerce with Foreigners, the chiwefes and Hollanders excepted. He had receiv’d Ambarfadours at feveral times from feveral Princes, but never fent any of his own to them again. Neverthelefs it is affirm’d, that feveral Lords of thefe Iflands newly converted to the Faith, in the year 1585 , fent their Children toRome^ to render their acknowledgments to Gregory the Thirteenth 5 and that being return’d back in the year 1587, to Goa, they were afterwards receiv’d and welcom’d again into their own Country with great marks of joy. The little inclination which they have to Navigation and Tra ffick, proceeds in part from the great abundance of all things necef- fary for Human fupport, which their own Country produces 5 and then in the next place from thejealoufiesof the Emperour, who is afraid of the alterations which new Religions may make in his Government 5 for they are very fickle, and eafily leduc d after Novelties,which has keen the occafion of many Revolts, and Civil Wars, iiWQuabacondonwtt^d the Empire out of the hands of the Dairy, and reunited all the Provinces. They are fo fiery and revengeful, that upon the leaft affront given them, if they cannot have an opportunity of a prefent revenge, they wil rip up their own Bellies, and kill themfelves. I was told a Story to conhrm ‘ this. Two young Lords that ferv’d the Emperour myt m the Palace, and joftl’d one the other by accident 5 the moft furious of the two was immediately for drawing his Sword. The other told him, the place was not convenient, that he was going to wait 5 but that ft he would ftay for him in fuch a place, he would give him fatisiadhon. Accordingly the party that thought himfelf affronted went and ftay 3 d,buthis impatience was fuch, that after he had fray’d awhile, not finding the other to come, he ripp’d up his own Bowels for very vexation. Upon which the people crowding about him , ask’d him the reafon of his killing himfelf^ to which they could draw no other anfwer but this ex /cowardly Ratkal bds affronted, me. By and by the other comes, makes way through the throng, and furpriz’d with what he beheld; Poor Creature , laid he, thou need'ft not have doubted my being at good a* my word this Dagger ffall affurethee of it: And fo faying, he kill’d himfelf upon the place, and fell by the others fide. There is no Nation under Heaven that fears Death lefsthan this, or that is more enclin’d to cruelty. If any Prince or great Lord makes a Feafr for his Friends, at the end of the Feaft he calls his principal Offi cers , and asks ’em, if there be any that has fo much love for him as to kill himfelf before the Guefts for his fake. Prefently there arifes a difpute among them who fhali have the Honour; and who ever the Prince is pleas’d to name , rips up his Belly with a Gric, which i$ a kind of Dagger, the poynt whereof is Poyfon’d. This cuftom is alfo practis’d upon the Death of their Mafters, or when they lay the Foun dations of any Palace-, forthey are fo fuperftitious as to believe, that thefe Victims are necefrary to render both the Owners of the Building , and the Habitation fortunate. They puniffi all manner of Theft with Death. ’Tis alfo a capital Crime among them to play for Money. Adultery is only puniffi J d in the Women: But Coynage of falfe Money, fetting Houles on Fire, Deflowring andRaviflfingof Virgins,are not only puniffi’d in the perfons of the Criminals, but allb of thofe who are next of kin to them. The Women live retir’d, and are very faithful to their Husbands. The Emperour having put to Death one of the Lords of his Court, out of hopesto.enjoy his Wife; flie fearing violence, befought the Emperour to give her time to confider, which was granted for fome few days. At the end whereof fhe ffiu't her felf up in a Room with her Children •* and after ffie had delivered a Paper to one of her Servants to carry to the Emperour, ihe let the Chamber a Fire, and burnt both her felf and her Children. The Emperour met with nothing eife in the Paper but reproaches of his Tyranny, and atteftations of joy from the Lady, that ffie had the opportunity to Sacrifice her felf to the memory of her Huf- band. Several other frories I have heard, which make me believe, that this Nation is not uncapable of doing addons worthy z Roman Vertue. V ... ;: The Portugals were the firft people of Europe that difeover’d the Iflands of C japcn. They were thrown upon the Coaft by a violent Storm, in the year 1542 , and underftanding that there was great ft@re of Gold and Silver in the Country, they return’d with a defoliation to fettle them- lelves. The firft place where they thought to fix was neer City, which Hands about four Leagues from the Sea: But becaufe there ■is but one Road, &amp;nd that not very fecure neither for Shipping, they remain d there not above five years. At length they took poflefrion of a little forfaken 111 and call’d Kifma , which they peopl’d afterward’s 5 but fince the lafr Perfeeution of the Chriftians, the Portugals were forc'd to abandon itdiaving no more Commerce with the Japonners. How the Hollanders came to ered their Fadories there, I tail tell the Reader in another part of this Relation. SevenSeven years after the firft coming of the Portagds to Jupon, S't. Franc® Xavier made aVoyage thither to Preach the Gofpel.The firft place where !u» Landed was the Ifland of Niphon &gt; 'w\\Qx&amp; he ftay’d two years and foirte Months, and travel'd feveral par;s of thefe Iflands; but his principal ddign being to go to china , he took (hipping accordingly. TheVeifel was no iooner out at Sea, but Su Francis fellfick, fo that the Captain put him afliore again in the Ifland of Seehcn , by others call’d Haynan, belonging to china , where in a few days after he dy’d, and never was in Chim , as feme have reported and believ’d, his death the Ohiiftian Religion Ipread it felf very much irt China iht people being very docibIe 5 and apprehenfive of the inftrudions which were given them $ but the behaviour of the difpkafing the Principal Governours 5 and thole who had iijoft Power at Court, they did them ill Offices to the Emperotir, and the Bonzes miflildn^tfoe new Religion, and jealous of the effeds thereof, were the fomenters of continual perfecutions againft the new Converts, pretending they favour’d the defigns of the fortuguefes. Neverthelefs the Chriftian Religion daily got footing, and perhaps the whole Nation would have embraced it, if the covetoufnefs and wicked- nefs of the Chriftians themfelves had not been the chief impediment of their converfion. The Hollanders did all they could to lay the fault upon the Portugals , but the truth will eafily appear by the Letter written toons Leonard C ampen , ^Hollander, wherein it is faid , that when the Hollanders were ask’d by the Natives what Religion they were of, they made this anfwer, We are m ebrifiians , we are Hollanders* I do not go about to blemifh a whole Nation for the fault of aTew , hut only to /hew what a dangerous thing it is.,to make an ill choice of Officers upon the fetling of a new Commerce in Regions fo remote. The Holland Baft-India Company having fet out a Veflelfor Batavia ? put aboard about a do^en young Boys, and as manyCkk, taken out of the Hofpitals in the Country. Among thefe Boys there was one who was design’d to ferve in the Kitcliin, but Formne made him an laftru^ ment of one of the greateh Misfortunes that ever bafdfl our Age; During the Voyage, the Merchant having obferv’d him to he a Boy of a ready wit,and for that reilbn believing that he migiit one day proveler^ viceable to the Holland Company, caus’d him to be taught to write and read 5 wherein he improv’d fo well in a Ihort time, that being come to Batavia, he was thought capable of a higher Employment The Velfel being arriv’d, the General and his Council refold’d to fend the lameVellel to Japon, with fome part of the Lading which was brought from Europe, Thereupon the Merchant was commanded uponthis Voyage , and the under Aceomptant happening in the mean time to dye, this Boy was by him advanc’d to the place, and by the Merchant carefully inftrutfledin the knowledge of the Baft-India Trade. The Veffei being arriv'd at Firando , the new under Accomptant believing no place more proper for him then that to raife his fortune, refolv’dto leave his Benefador, and therefore when the Ship was to return, hehidhimfelf out of the way, till he knew the Ship to be far enough on ward on her Voyage, a nd by that means becoming a Member of the Fadory 5 he grew fo perfed in the Language of the Natives, and To ufeful to the Company, that at length he came to be.Prefident of the Fadory* the Authority of which Employment fo puff’d himup, that he was not only for continuing and upholding the Commerce of his own 5 but excluding ail other Nations. Now, as I have already obferv’d, the Portugds were the firfi: Traders, and the firft that propa gated the Chriftian Religion in thofe parts- therefore it was that the Chriftian Japomers would not Trade with any but the Vortugds, as having known them longer, and finding them more true to their words. This the Prefident obferv’d, and made it his bufinefs to render them obnoxious at Court, and by vertue of his Prefents , engag’d the Gover- noursof Provinces, and other great Lords, to favour his defign. However, the Vortngds wanted neither friends nor confederates. And though they were not in a condition to be lo liberal as the Prefident, yet they made alhift to defend themfelves, and render his under-hand Dealings ineffettual. Thereupon finding that thofe Tricks would not take, he had recourfeto thefouleftof Calumnies ^ for he counter feited a Letter written in the Porfuguefe Language, containing a difeo- very of a defign of the Chriftian 'jApouticvs to have made a general In- furre&amp;ion, and a particular Confpiracy againft the perfon of the Em- perour. This Letter he carry'd to a Lord of the Country, intowhofe favour and confidence he had wrought himfelf, who prelently thought it to be his duty to give intelligence of fo important a defign to the Court. 1 ~ 4 f t . The Prefident inform’d him by what accident the Letter came to his hands, and gave an account of fueh circumftances, as made his Impo- fture look with a probable countenance, relating, how that the Hoi- Unders had taken a Portugd VefTel returning from Japon to Goa^ and that the Holland Captain having taken this Letter among other Papers, open’d it, and perceiving of what confequence it was, had fent an Expreis to the Prefident to proceed as his prudence, and the affection of the Dutch Company toward the Emperour fhould guide him.^ That the Fortugals, who were but Subje&amp;s to the Spaniards , had a pernicious Maxim, not to fuffer any Religon but their own in any place where they had to do, and that for their own ends they never fpar’d either the Liie or Liberty of Man 5 that they thought it an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to cut the Throats’of thofe whom they could not convert. Amdlaftly, that the Hollanders were a people that accorded with all Nations and Religions, and minded nothing but their Trade. The Lord believ'd all thefe fraudulent Calumnies, and fent a Copy of the Letter to the Emperour, the fubftance whereof was, That the Spaniards in xho, Philippine Iflands , and the Vortugds in Japon, being m confederacy with the Chriftians of the Country, had fent to the Gover- nour of Goa to fend by a time prefix’d eight or ten Vefiels, with Men and Arms, but efpecialiy a good number of Officers to command the Revolters, for that then there would be a numerous Army ready, and that they fhould eafily make themfelves Mafters of Japon. The Portugals were then under the Dominion of the Spaniard, and though they would fuffer no Spaniard in their Indian Acquifitions but the Viceroy, yet feveral of the Religious Orders did flip into japon, carried thither by a true and real zeal 5 yet this zeal, when once indih erect, does as much mifehief as covetoufnefs it felf. The Father Path lip, for fo they call the Jefuits in the Indies, by reafon that their Churcn in Goa is dedicated to St. Paul • thefe Jefuits I fay, had made a P. ro grefs, and gain’d great credit among the people, notwithUandingtheir continual peiTecutions, according as the Ilords ol tfe'Co^'ntsry verc vveii 01 ill affedted towards therh. Their number therefore encreas d, and the new Converts had thisadvafitage,.tha$lihc.yjentli^h’d them!eives by Trading with the PoringaU , who had ii^ade pohtive Agreement not to Trade with the Bw&amp;i. , ThisdprovQj^d againd tliem, and the multitude of the Chriilians io fan ^ugm^nte'd the Empeioui s jealoufies and fears 5 that in a .foort time .they prodUiC'd the efFeds of open rage and cruelty.- The jejmts had converted to the Faith a great Lord of thq .Kingdom, who hv d mo ft c o m m on 1 y a t Bug sn, in the Illandof Xitm v a per] bn of great Intereft and Power in the I {land. He hid four SbtWy tAMer of which liv’d with him, and following his Example,, had Catholick Faith. The Father was Baptis’d by the name of i the eldeft: of the two was call’d Framfc , and the youngelpC/^?:^;&gt; the two eldeft: Sons were at Court in great favour with the Emperour. The younger of the two that had embrac’d the. Chriftian Bieligiorii^ ad, di^ed himfelf wholly; to the ftudy of the Scripture , and retir’d with the ‘Jefuzts to their Seminary. His Example had wrought with a great number of young Lords, and as he was eloquent befic|s§., fee wa? of great ufe to the leftists in preaching the Gofpel, and reclaiming the people from the groffnefs of their Errors. The Japonaers are naturally endow’d with a noble mind;, andgreat inclination to Learning 5 fo that there is nothing wanting in that FTajtioi* but able Teachers. Not but that they have Dolors of thek own &gt; |he Dairy's Court is full of them 5 where they prefcrve the Annals of tfrek Country, and pretend that Printing and Artillery were in uft among them before they were known m Europe. From this Court come all their Books, in regard the perfons that attend upon this Prince apply themfelves only to their Studies. It is reported, that they learnt all tftefe things by their frequent Commerce with thecfowefes , and that they are alfo originally defeended from them. And in truth, the greateft Pro vince ol the Iftand of Niphon is call’d Qjgmto y according, to the name of the Sea-Coaft part of china, where lies the greateft Traffick be tween the Japomers znd chznefes. Moreover, if there be any credit to be given to the chine [e Htftories, they fay it was but a I’m all part of their vaft Empire, which extended it felf from North toSouth 56 Degrees: of Latitude, from the Frozen Sea to the Equinodial Line , ^ing, boun ded to the Weft by the Cafyian Sea 5 and extending E aft ward over all the Southern America to New spam. Father Thomas Barr , a Portugmfe y has often told me when I was at jgra , a capital City of the Great Mogul \ where the Jefuits have a very fair Houfe, that this and feverai other young Lords improv’d themfelves fo far in ftx or feven years, that they were as Learned as their Makers thcmfelves , and that they were more zealous in converting tnofe of their Nation. Now the lefrits at that time had no Houfe for thelnftrudion of Youth and Profelytes, and therefore they deftr’d this young Lord to lend them one of his. Thereupon he.having four very fair ones, with great Revenues belonging to them, gave that which was neareft to the City to his Converters, A while after, the youngefo of his Sons fell fick , and was carried to this Houle for the Aufo fake &gt; where he recover’d by the care of the Fathers, and the Prayers of the Chriftians * but his Father did not long enjoy the pleafure of fo great8 A Relation a Cure, which feem'd almoft miraculous ; for hedy’d at what time both his Sons and the Chriftians ftood moft in need of his protedtion. The two eldeft, who were with the Emperour, undemanding the the Death of their Father, came to take poiTeffion of their Inheritance, and demanded of the Mmts the Houlb which their Father had given them for mjupon no Parent can alienate theEftateof his Children 5 nay when they come to fuch an Age, he is obug d to put them in poileffion of their Eftates, referving only fuch a proportion to himfelf. The jc[uiU, loth to part with fo fair a convenience, would not quit their hold though it were for their own quiet, and to engage die whole Family to ftand by them in their time of trouble. This refulalpro- vok’d the two Brethren, and this quarrel between them and die Jtfuits happen’d at the fame time that the Prefident was labouring to bring about his defigns. He had notice of this dilpute, and as he was a great Impoftor, he made it hisbufmefstoenflame the two Brothers, n&lt;« only againft the Jefuits , but againft the Aor^/nn general, giving them a Copy of the Letter which he had fram d, as is before-men- non d. • r i ■&amp;- * * ’ Thefe two Lords&gt;who were Favourites of the Emperour, joyning Intereftof State to their particular Intereft, made their complaints at Court with extraordinary aggravations ; urging that there was no fecurity for the Eftates of particular Men, for the quiet of the Empire, nor the Life of the Prince , unlefs not only all the Portugal! , but alio all the Natives of Jat/on , who had luck’d their Errors, were exterminated out of the Illand. To make good the reafons of their Exafperation they Ihew’d the Emperour a Copy of the Letter, and put him into fuch a fright, as well for his Perfon, as the Empire, that he would admit of no iuftification on the other fide. &gt; , , r , .. Some of his Lords, who were Friends to the Portugal!, belought him to examin the truth of what was alledg’d, before lie proceeded to utmoft extremities againft a whole Nation, and againft his own Subjects. But he was inexorable , and prefently gave private Orders to certain Commifiioners, to go through ail the Provinces of the Empire and to banifh not only the Portugds, but alio all the Chrnlian Nativ es. Now in regard they had their private confederates, as well in the Court, as in other places, they had intelligence, in all parts,of the cruel refolution tak’n againft them, though none were more zealous and taithiui to them then the two Lords of Ximo , Francis and chtries. Thereupon the Chriftians met together to confult for their own fafety, and their common prefervation, and feeing all attempts to juftifie themle ves prove ineffeaual, they refolv’J to ftand upon their guards, and to dye in the defence of their Innoceixcy and Rehgron. The two Lords put themielves at the head of the Chriftians Army, tne elder of w uc i ul beenaSouldier, andunderftood the Artof War- the younger kept up their Spirits and Courages by his continual Exhortations. The Emperouds Commiftioners underftanding that the Chnfhans were thus embody’d , gave him fpeedy notice thereof, but laid nothing either’of the number of rheir Forces, or of their defigns. The Jejm,! and Auftin Fryars at Goa, told tne, that the Army of the Chnllians ton- fifted of above 40000 Men, befides thofe recruits that came up to tnem before and after the Battel was fought f heThe Emperour not beleiving that the Army was fo numerous, Tent againft them at firftnot above 25 or 30000 Men 5 Under the Com mand of the youngeft of the two Lords of Ximo , that liv’d at Court. But thofe Troops were no fooner upon their March, but he rais’d new Forces , and fent another Army after them, confifting of 40000 Men, commanded by the young Lord, to whom the Dutch Prefident had (hew’d the Letter hrfl: of all. The Chriftians having intelligence of the approach of thefe two Armies, prepar’d to receive them, choofing an advantagious place to intrench themfeLves. The firft Army foon appear’d in fight of the Chriftians, who lay fo encamp’d, that the Imperialifls could difcover no more than one part of them. However, before the Engagement, the youngeft of the Chridian Brothers advis’d his other Brother to fend to the General of the Emperour’s Army,who was their Brother likewife,to defire Peac^, and to befeech him to intercede for them to the Emperour, and to affure him , that they were ready to lay down their Arms, and throw themfelves at his Feet, and to juftifie their Innocency. Tothis purpofe a Letter was fram’d and lent to the General, but the Meffenger that carry’d it was nail’d to aCrols in fight of the whole Army of the Chriftians, and at the fame time the Enemy came on with great fury to affail them. . y r u _ The Fight lafted almoft three hours with equal advantage * the Cap tain of the Imperialifts feeking every where for his Brothers, while they ft rove to avoid him. The Chriftians, who knew that all their fafety confifted in their Vidory, and that there was otherwife no hope of par don , fought with fo much valour, that the Imperialifts were fore d to give ground. Their General was flain upon the place, and at length the whole Army of the Idolaters w r as cut in pieces. This Vidory wrought the Converfion of feveral of the Idolaters 5 and the Chriftians, after they had given thanks to God three days toge ther , prepar’d themfelves for a fecond Combat, not doubting but the other Army would fet upon them while they were weary, and weaken’d by the laft Battel. But that General more prudent then the former, only pofted himfelf where the Chriftians could not come at him, and writ to the Court the particulars ol the Defeat of the firft Army, upon which heexpeded the Emperour’s Orders. y ,, r , In the mean while,the Army of the Chriftians daily encreas d, 10 that in a fe w days they were above fifty thoufand ftrong. / The Emperour, refolv’d to ftifle this Revolt in the beginning, lent Orders through all his Empire to make new Levies • and ail the while the Daw Preiident’s Confederates ceas’d not to aggravate him againft the Chriftians, not fuffering the other Courtiers to open his Eyes, and prevent lo unjult a profecution. The defeat of his Army had put him into .luch a rage be- lides, that though the Captains of the Chriftians Army did all they could to clear themfelves from the falfe accuiations laid upon tnem, an to obtain their pardons, there was no polEbility of being heard. ^ ^ The Emperour call’d his Council, where the wifeft were of opinion, that it would prove the beft way to receive the lubmimons oi theChn- ftians, who offer’d to lay down their Arms upon a general pardon, and the free exercife of their Religion. But the Prefident s Cabal carry d it beyond this fober advice, and the Emperour, exafperated by his Impo- ftures , took the wrong courfe. Thereupon the Council relolv d w ^all (peed to raife a vail Army, which was tojoyn with the other, and fo to ruin the Ghriftiabs all at a blow. The Dairy alfo, who is con- fulted upon all important affairs, approv’d this Council. Thereupon the Lords who are oblig'd to furnilli theEmperour with Men, firove who fhould bring their Troops and Companies hrfl: to the Randevouz appointed , which was neer the place where the fecond Army lay ; fo that when both Armies werejoyn’d together, there was in the Field a Body of 150000 Men, The Brother of theGeneral, who was (lain in the firfl: Battel, commanded under theEmperour, who refolv’d to go in perfon. But firft of all he caus’d a Proclamation to be made in his Camp, whereby he forbad any Quarter to be given to any Chriftian , unlefs it Were the two Brothers, whom he intended to punifh openly 5 and that they who left the Field before the Chriftians were banilh d,lhould be put, they and their Kindred, to the moft cruel Deaths that could be imagin’d - but that they Ihould be rewarded that brought the Head of a Chriftian to the Emperour. The Copies of this Proclamation were fcatter’d in the Army of the Chriftians, though they did no harm but only encou rag’d them againft the Idolaters, feeing there was no hope of pardon. Neverthelefs the youngeft of the two Brothers offer’d to go and throw himfelf at the Emperour's Feet, to implore his clemency in the name of the whole Army 5 faying withall,That he fhould accompt himfelf happy to fuffer Martyrdom to fhew his Innocency 5 but they would not fuller him to ftir. All he could obtain from them, was to write a Letter full of refpeft, fubmiffion, and repentance for what had been already done*, declaring that they were ready today down their Arms, if the Emperour would grant them pardon &gt; and the free Exercife of their Religion, offering with the hazard of their Lives to make out the falftty of all thofe things wherewith they had been accus’d. This Was by an Idolater carry’d to a certain Lord who fecretly fa vour’d the Chriftians; but the Emperour toar it without reading it, vowing at the fame time, that he would never return to his Court ’till the ietefet* ters were all extirpated. The Chriftian Army underftanding the Em- perout’s refolution,minded nothing more then their own defence. ’Tis true, the Ground where they lay w r as advantagious enough for the fmallnefs of their Number, but the Idolaters were three to one 5 befides that theldolaters of theCountry, who favour’d the Chriftians before, now declar’d all againft them fo foon astbey faw the Imperial Array. So that now both Armies lying fo near together, feveral hot Skirmifhes pafs’d between ’em- and at length it came to a general Battel. At firft: ■the Chriftians overthrew the Idolaters, not able to ft and before them: with fo much vigour did the youngeft of their Chieftains affail them. He was remarkable for his Habit that day, but more remarkable for his courage-, fo that the Field was cover’d with the Bodies of theftain, fear and dread poftefting the yielding Enemy. But while the Vidor forgot his Brother’s advice, and purfu’d too far from theBody of the Army, he was encompafs’d on every fide, wounded, and being carried away by the prefs of his Enemies, was at length taken, and lead before the Ernperour. His eldeft Brother, more experienc’d in War, railed and recall’d thofe that had follow’d his Brother, and till Night maintain’d ■the advantages, which he had got over the Imperialifts, who vvereftili fupply’d with frefti Succoursjas neceflity requir’d. The next day the Fightwas renew’d again by break of day 5 and with a fuccefs as honourable 3 but more bloody to the Chriftians. The third day the Emperour enrag’d at filch a refiftance^ caus'd them to be fet upon m feveral places at one titQe. The General of theChri- IHans Army rode from Rank to Rank, encouraging the So.uldiers both by his Exhortations, and his Example: but at length having receiv’d feveral wounds, he was overlaid by the multitude of his Enemies that crouded to his deftru&amp;ion. And now the General being loft , and the Chriftians having no perfon to command them , it ceas’d to be a Com bat, and became a Maftacre. However, refolving to dye with their Swords in their hands, they flung themleives into the thickeft of their Enemies, and Sacrific’d themfelves to their own Innocency. Their Camp was foon forc’d, and all theoldMen, Women, and Children put to the Sword , except feme few that efcap’d and hid themfelves in the Mountains, who afterwards made a relation of this bloody Story.’to them who rehears’d it to me. * \ * This was the deplorable end of the Chriftians , and indeed of the Chriftianifme of iapon, which the Prefident procur'd by his impoftures and fallacies. And it has been made appear by three exad accompts,that there has periflfd, either in Battels or by Tortures , above 60000 Chri ftians. The eldeft of their Captains fuffer’d a moft cruel Martyrdom for feven days, neither could any offer, that the Emperour could make him for his Brothers and his own Valours fake, induce him to renounce the Chriftian Faith. After that, there was a kind of Inquifition fet up thorough the whole Empire, which lafted for feveral years, : whereby thofe that perfeverdintheFaith, were condemn’d to moft intolerable Torments, in fo much that the Relation which rm yweti , a HotUndefy whofe credit it would be a vanity to queftion in this particular, cannot be read over without Horrour. In fixteen years, that is, from 1613 to 1629, the Chriftians were fo multiply’d, that there were above 400000* but in the year 1649, the fame relates, that thofe Jdponners who were brought from thence by the Company’s Ships to Am- jlerdam, affirm’d, that Chriftunity was utterly extirpated out of the I(land. Being at Ogti, a large Town upon the faireft Armor the Ganges , i met a Holland Merchant, who had ferv’d the Company in a long time, and had made feveral Voyages. He came thither With two Ships laden with Bars of Silver and Copper , which he had exchang’d for Silks, which the Hollanders buy at Bengde. This Merchant know ing I was there, came to vifit me* and I finding him to beafincere honeft Man , and well verft in the affairs of Japan, efpecially in reference to the laft perfecution of the Chriftians, grew cove tous of his converfe , and invited him often to my Houle. In our familiar difeourfes concerning the fettlement of the Hollanders in the Erf-lndiesy and of the extraordinary gain which they make by their Trade there,and paffing thus from one thing to another,at length d him who was the Author and Contriver of a Maflacre fo horrid, as that was reoorted to be. Vv'hereupon he related to me all the particu lars of which I have here made a recital, and many more which I have forgot or omitted, as being either not pertmeiit to my lubjea , or e lie alreadv related by others. He had his information from iuch or the Natives that had efcap’d out of the Battel, and feveral of the Idolater G z Mer-Merchants, in whole memories the fad was then frelh: and indeed he was fo ingenious in his Story, that I could not find any motive to in cite me to mifdoubt the truth of it. For many times he could not for bear fhedding tears, and to interrupt his difcourfe with his fighs, often imprecating Heav'ns Vengeance upon the Prefident, and protefting he ^wonder'd the Company employ’d him fo long. But God referv’d his punilhment to himielf. For thedeferts of his crimes always atten ding him, and provoking judgments and misfortunes upon whatever Enterprize he took in hand, he miferably perilh’d in fight of Lisbon in fair weather. All the men in the Ship were fav’d * only he returning to recover a certain Cabinet of Jewels which he had there, the Ship fplit, and the Vortngds had the fatisfadion to fee him fwallow’d up in the Sea, who had been the occaiion of the Ruin of fo many of their Country-men in Jafori - and immediately they rang their Bells in the City for joy of his Death. In my laft Voyage to the Indies I was at Bandar-Abajfi , where the Hollanders \\zvq a Fadory. Thither arriv’d twoVeffels from Japon to take in Silks, which xhz Hollanders buy of the Perfians to exchange in Japan. The Captain of one of the Ships told me, that during feveral trading Voyages which he had made to that Ifland , the Emperour had caus’d two Inquifitions to be made after the Chriftians • in the fM: of which the Inquifitors met with 247 , who were all moft exquifitely tormented to Death 5 in the latter they only found 63 , among whom were feventeen Children, twelve Girls and five Boys, of which the eldeft Were not above thirteen years of Age. Among all the perfecutions which the ChriRians fuffer’d, there was none comparable to this for extremity of Torments: For the Japonners are the moft ingenious in cruelty of any people in the World, and the moft conftant in fuffering. For there have been Children from ten to a dozen years old, who for 60 days together have endur’d to have their Bodies faften’d to the Crofs, half burnt, half torn in pieces, while their Executioners forc’d them to eat, on purpofe to prolong their Lives in mifery - and yet they would not renounce the Faith which they had embrac’d. Neither did this barbarous Inquifition extend only to the Chriftians, but to their Kindred and Relations, nay, to their very Neighbours. For if a Prieft were taken in any Houfe, all the people in that Houfe, and the Houfes adjoyning, were hail’d to Execution, for not having made the difcovery. At the beginning of every year there is a new Inquifition, at which time all that can write are requir ’d to fubfcribe, or elfe the chief of the Family fubfcribes for all the reft, that they neither are Chriftians, nor are acquainted with any Chriftians,and that they abominate Chriftianity as a Religion dangerous to the State. Von John of Braganza , being advanc’d to the Crown, that fudden change which in one day, and without the leaft Tumult in Lisbon, wrefted the Crown of Vortugal from the King of Spain y wrought the fame effedt at Goa. All the Portugals at Goa at the fame time acknow ledg’d their new Soveraign * the Viceroy who was a Spaniard , was fent away to Spain by thefirft: Veffels that were homeward bound 5 andZto Philip de Mafcarennaa, a Portugal, Governour of Ceylan, came to Goa, and took upon him the command of Viceroy.So foon as he came to the Government, his firft thoughts were how to Eflabliih the Trade of xkzTortugds mjapori^ which when they were expelTd , amounted to three Millions of pW/j yearly, one being worth twenty feven Sow of French Money. The hopes therefore of regaining lo great a lofs, made him toward the^end of the year 1^42, take a relolution to fend a folemn Embaffy to the Emperour of faponfm- niflfd with magnificent Prefents: Tor which reafon he made choice of what was moft rare, and mo ft likely to be acceptable to the Emperour, and the Grandees of his Court. The moft coftly of thefe Prefents was a piece of Lignum Aloes , otherwife call’d wood of Calamhoar y four Foot in length, and two Foot in Diameter* a larger piece then which the Indies had never feen , having coft 40000 To this lie added a great quantity of fair Coral Beads ot an extraordinary bignefs. This is the moft acceptable Prefent that can be fentto the Lords of Japon, which they faften to the Strings wherewith they draw their Pouches together. With thefe he fent a great number ot Carpets and Hangings of Cloth of Gold, Silver, and Silk, and feveral pieces of Tiffue of Gold and Silver. Tis laid the whole Prefent coft the City of Goa above eight hundred thoufand Pardo’s, which amounts to about %6666l. 13 s. 4 d. of Englifl? Money. Befides all this, the two great Ships which were prepar’d for the Embaflador, carry’d one of them 5oPeeces of Canon , and the other 35 , both laden with all forts of Commodities which are efteemfd and priz’d in J^/^amounting to about 83333 /. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling. The Equipage of the Embaffador was no lefs lumptuous. And becaufe the Viceroy would not be thought to give any occafion of offence to the Emperour, he would not fuflfer one jefuit in the Train, but only four Augujiins for the Admiral, and four jacobins for the other. Men of difcretion and condud. While I was at Goa, in the year 1648, I met with fome of thefe Fathers, who gave an exad accompt of the Embaffy. They made a profperous Voyage, and arriv’d happily at their in tended Port. But you muft underhand, that when any Ship arrives at Japon, no perfons are permitted to come afhore, ’till the Governour of the place have an accompt who they are, that they may give notice thereof to the Emperour, and know his pleafure,whether they (hall be received or no. In the mean time the Ships rode in a very dangerous place, at the entry of the Haven, into which there was no fleering, without the afftftance of the Native Pilots. The Governour of Nangafaqui furpriz’d to underftand that they were Portuguefes , wrote in all haft to the Emperour. The Dutch Prefident being inform’d of the news, play’d all the pranks he could, us’d all the contrivances imaginable to fruftrate thefuccefsof the Embaffy, and to ruine the Veffels that brought the Embaffadour and his Prefents. To which purpofe he found a way to bribe the Courrier, who was fent with the Emperours Orders5 fo that inftead of twenty days, which were fufficient for his journey , he made it abov^two Months before he deliver’d his difpatches. During which time the two Ships had (uflfer d very bad weather upon theCoafts, and endur’d many a fevere Storm. At length the Orders came that none fhoirld be permitted to Land but the Embaffadour , the two Captains, and the two Pilots, to give an accompt of the fubjedl andcaufeof their coming. The Embaffadour being Landed acquainted the Governour that he came to complimenttheEmperour in the behalf of the King his Mafter, and to allure him that they were no longer under the Power of the King of Spain. That about a year lince, a lawful Heir of fortugdh^ recover’d the Diadem of hisAnceftors which the had ufurp’d. That this new King was fo juft and generous a Prince 5 that underftanding that fome of his Subje&amp;s had deferted the Illand of Japon, without paying their Debts, he had now fent to make a general fatisfadiion • but chiefly out of that refped which obliges all Soveraigns newly come to the Crown, to give notice thereof to tnofe Princes, whofe friendfhip they defire. The Governour inform’d the Emperour of all thele things 5 but the Prefident having as good intelligence by means of his Friends at Court, alledg’d to the Emperour that they were Rebels, who came from the utmoft parts of the Weft, to bring the News and Example of their Revolt to '\apon: That the natural reftlefnefs of this Nation caus’d fre quent difturbances and revolutions among them. That they were never long at reft themfelves, nor would fuflFer others to be at quiet. That confidering the experience he had had , he could not be either too cau tious for the fecurity of his perfon, or the tranquillity of his Empire. Laftly, that the Emperour and the Empire would be ruin’d paft reco very , if thofe people were ever admitted to fet footing therein. This Counfel well feconded by the reft of the Cabal, eafily made an impreflion in the Heart of the Prince naturally Barbarous, and an Enemy to the Chriftians* Thereupon he fent an Order to the Gover- nour to invite ail the whites aboard , and to treat them for eight days in the beft manner he could. At the end of eight days they were order’d to repair aboard again, and at the fame time he made a Prefent to the Embafladour, and chief of his Train, confifting of fix great Cabinets, and fix Coffers lacker’d with black, with Figures in Relief, intermix’d with fpangles of Gold , all the Embellifhments being of Maflie Gold. With them were fix Cabinets, and fix Coffers, lacker’d with Red, Embellifh’d after the fame manner with Silver. I faw fome of them when I was at Goa, and I muft confefs I never beheld any fo rare and beautiful in that kind , which made me admire the ingenious Induftry of the Artiftsof ^apon • Our imitations of their workmanfhip being no way comparable to them. The Embaffadour having receiv’d his Prefent, had Order to remove all the Goods in the fecond Veffel into the Admiral. He would have made great Prefents to theGovernour, who refus’d them 5 telling the Embaffadour withall, that he had exprefs command to refuie them, and to declare to the EmbafTadour, that if he did not make haft away, he would fink his Ship. That the Emperour his Mafter had made a new prohibition , forbidding all Tortugals and Spaniards to venture near hj^ Dominions upon any pretence whatfoever; nay , though it were upon pretence of anEmhaffy, upon pain of being criicifi’d upon theplace, without liberty to fpeakfor themfelves. As for the Debts of the Porttt- gals, he had undertaken to difcharge them himfelf-, only he had fent that Prefent to the King his Mafter to thank him for that Embaffy. The Embaffadour had no fooner remov’d the Goods out of the fecond Veuel into the Admiral, but they fank her before his face. And not contented with that affront, the Governour lent for all the Blacks that were in the Admit al, and cutoff their Heads, pretending they were Indians, and that, as fuch, they could not be ignorant of the Rigorous prohibitions . ' which1 of JAP ON. which the Emperour had put forth, forbidding all Strangers, except the Hollanders, to fet footing in Jap on. After the Portugal Embaffadour was thus barbaroufly fruftrated and dilmifs’d, he fent News thereof to the General at Batavta , urging him to execute the deffgn which the Hollanders had upon Macao . telling him alfo, That though there were a probability of a League between the Hollander and the Portugal againft the Spaniard, yet that it could be no harm to feize Macao beforehand, as they had made themfelves Matters of feveral places , while the Portugals were under the King of Spain, The General taking the Prefident’s advice, was ready to fet Sail upon this enterprize, when a Meffenger from Portugal brought him the News of the Treaty concluded between Portugal and Holland; as alfo of the Navy which the Hollanders had fent to Lisbon to aid the Portug^ls, At firft he made as if it had been a falfe Rumour, and put the Meffenger in Prifon* neverthelefs while he delay’d the departure of the Fleet, he receiv’d exprefs Orders from his Superiours to Treat the Portugals as Friends and Allies. So that he was conftrain’d to turn all his Forces againft the Molucca Iflands, then in thepoffettion of the Spaniards, The Prefident was very forry for the laftNews, by reafon that the General and he had great defigns upon the Conqueft of that place, and had promis’d the Company by that means to make them abfolute Matters of the Trade of china, and of all the Eaft. True it is, that Macao is very advantagioufly feated for thofe that defign to be Matters of thofe Seas, efpeoialiy upon the Coafts of Quantmg and Fockien, which are the Provinces, whither are brought down all the Merchandizes of this Empire. It lies at the Mouth of the Gulph of Canton^ , in a fmall Pemnfrla adjoyning to a larger Ifland, and built upon a kind of a Pro montory, on three Tides environ'd with the Sea, which no Ship can come neer by reafon of the Flats, unlefs it be on that fide next the Port, which is defended by a ftrong Fortrefs. This City drew from the only Fair of Quanchiu 1300 Chefts of Silks of all forts, every Cheft con taining 150 pieces, and 25^0 Lingotsof Gold, not reckoning the raw Silks, the Gold Wire, and other Merchandizes: whence it may be eafily judg’d what advantage the Portuguefev made of it 5 and wherefore the Prefident defir’d fo much to expell them from thence. But his Defigns were disappointed, not only by the revolution in Portugal , but alfo by the lols which x\\e Hollanders luftain d of the Ifland of Formofi , which the chinefes took from them, following rhe advice of a French Souldier, whom the Governour of Tayovan had refus’d to difmifs after his time was out. For the better underftanding this accident, you rnuft know that the Hollanders being fetid in fapm, and having excluded ail other Nations from thence, except the chinefes^ whorn the Emperour permitted to return, after that the Maffacre com- mitted by the c japonners in a City of China ^ of which they had adettre to make themfelves Matters, had caus’d a Ceffation of the Commerce between the two Kingdoms, and conftrain’d the Emperour of cJoam to fet a price upon the Heads of the fapomers. Neverthelds the Hdan* ders did all they could to make a new Rupture between the people , or elfe themfelves to feize upon fome place that lay proper to ruin the Trade of the Chine fes to Japon. To this purpofe, not daring to attempt upon the Portuguejes , they over-ran the Seas which environ’d the neighbouring Iflands, and took the I 5the VelTels of the Chine[es which were bound for Macao, exercihng if range Cruelties upon the people that had efcap’d into thofe Ifiands, after the irruption of*the Tartars into China. Coxinga, the Son of chinchilunge, that famous Pirate, who fav’d the remainders of that ruin’d Empire, then commanded thofe people, and was become formi dable to the Tartars themfelves. Who to revenge himfelf upon the Pirates, undertook the Siege of Tayovan, where they ufually retir’d, and by gaining that place drave them wholly out of Formofa. This is a large Ifland plac’d at the poynt of the Phillip fines , ff retch ing out in length from North to South, and to the Weft lying oppofite to the Provinces of Fockien , and Quantung. The Chinefes call it ‘lali- eukieu. Since which time,’tis very probable that the Spaniards gave it the name of Formosa, from its beauty and fertility. They being the firft people of Europe that difeover’d it, and inhabited it 5 and upon one of its Promontories to the North built the Fort of Kiting. The natu ral Inhabitants live almoft all in the Woods and Mountains, where they maintain themfelves by hunting the Hart, and wild Boar, whofe dry’d Flelh, Skins, and Horns they fell to the Sangleys, who in exchange bring them other neceftaries. The little Ifland of Tayovan lent its Name to the little Fort which the Engtijhbmh , over againft the great Ifland 5 it was very convenient for the Hollanders, who made great advantage of theCattel, Hides, and Horns, both of Harts and Bufalo’s, which they carry ? d from thence,and fold to the chinefes and japonners,who make great ufe thereof infeveralof their Trades and Manufa&amp;ures. But the ehiefeft advantage which the made of this Ifland confided in this , that it lay in the middle way between Batavia and Japop, and ferv’d as a place of fecurity for their Ships in bad Seafons, and to take in refrefhments. There alfo they laded off feveral of the Goods of the Chinefes, which they took by way of Piracy from the chinefes, or .which were broughifthem by the Sangleys, who are the Original Merchantsof the chinefes, fetled at the Philippines, butwhodrive the greateft Trade of that Country, independent from the Spaniards. Coxinga* though an Idolater and a Pirate, baniftfd out of his Country, and provok’d by the Hollanders, had fo much humanity as to fend to the General at Batavia to fend away Veffeis to fetch away his Men, and de liver’d them all without fuffering them to receive the lead injury, He had his Friends and Favourers in the Emperour of Court , as being a declar’d Enemy to the Tartars , whole neer Neighbourhood the Japonners cannot endure. For fo quick a Conqueft of fo many Lands and Provinces in fewrn years, as it were only upon fight of the Enemy, had very much alarum’d them. He by his Friends acquainted the Em perour of the ads of Hoftility, committed by the Hollanders againft the chinefe Merchants: Adding moreover , that they had made private propofitions to league themfelves with the common Enemy-, and that it was one of the Nations of the North, born for the defolation of other Countries , and to invade the Peace of Empires. That they had fetled themfelves- in the Iflands of the Eaft only by treachery and violence. That for fome years fince, they had made it their bufinefs to cruife the Seaslbefween china and Japon : , on purpofe to make themfelves abfolute Mafters of the Trade , and that if he did not take a fpeedy courfe, they would do the fame mifehief in his Dominions which the Tartars had done mchjna. TheThe Prefident had much ^do to divert the Storm, for the moft potent Lords- Court, although his Penfioners and Friends,began to open their:.Eyes, and in fome meafure took part, faying, That the Chwefis were unfortunate enough, in being laid waft by the Tartars^ without being perfecuted and afflicted bythe/^/Wm-.' That feeing that after they hid been, expelfd their Country, they had nothing left but their Boats, and fome lew Flocks for their places of refuge, it was a piece of inhumanity to difturb them in their laftSanauaries, and to deprive them of their liberty of the Sea, and their Commerce with ^4^ , from whence thole miferable Lxiles had their chiefeft fupport. The^-rjf, the Merchants, the vulgar People, all tookxh^ Chmefes pam Thereupon the Emperour lent for the Prefident, and told him , I underlfand , laid he, that thy Company abufes my Prote&amp;ion, and that their Veffels, inftead of being contented with the Trade which I have.permitted them, prefume to pl^y the Pyrates upon the Chwfes , and to trouble the Seas, adjoyning to my Empire. If I hear any more of thefe complaints, I will caufe thee and all thy Nation to be Cru cified. I know not how the Prefident appeas’d the Emperour’s fury 5 this I know in general, that the Hollanders made a fecret alliance with the Tartars againft Coxinga. Him the Inhabitants of Fockien call’d to their afliftance, having rais’d an Army of 200000 Men; whereupon he went to aid them with a very powerful Navy. After feveral Skir- mifties;, thsTartars and Ghwefes came to a pitch’d Field, where the Captain of the Tartars having plac’d the beft part of his Cavalry in Ambufli, order’d his Men to retreat by degrees, till they had drawn the Chinefes into the Ambuicade •, at what time the Tartars encom- paffing them on every fide, kill’d 80000 upon the place • Ccxinga with his Navy not being able to relieve them. During this War, the Hollanders took their opportunity, and made themfelves Mafters of the llland of Fifbers, between Formofa and the Coaft of Fockien. In a fliort while after Coxwga dy’d , and Savia his Uncle, the richeft Merchant of china, who out of his own revenue had disburs’d the expences of thelaftWar, grew weary of the charge^ and was defirous to make Peace with the Tartars. Of which one of the Sons of Coxinga being advertiz’d, feiz’d upon his Uncles perfon , and fihut him up in a clofe Prifon, where he kill’d himfelf for madnefs. The Hollanders overjoyM at the Death of Savia, who had always hin der’d them from the Trade of the Province of Fockien, fent a Navy againft his Nephew in favour of the Tartars , who made War againft bimall along the Sea-Coaft. Several Combats happen’d between the ‘juncks of the iflanders and the /-WW Veffels in view of the Tartars , who fatisfi’d themfelves with being only Spedators. But all the benefit which the Hollanders reap’d from the advantages which they obtain’d over the Jjlanders , was only to put into the Hands of theTartars the Cities of Bemos aed Quefmoy , and all the places thereabouts, which coxinga s Party poffefs’d before. For notwithftanding all their kindnefs, the Tartars would not afftft them to retake Tayovan • fo that they only were content to build certain fmall Forts in the fmall Ifiands adjoyning to Formofa : and fince my return from the Indies , 1 never could inform my (elf of the truth of die iffueof that Enterprize. But the Hollanders were nofeontent with their (ettlement at Firmando^ which was an Iflaod both desert ana barren, (eated upon aStreight, D wwhich ieparates the Point of the Land of Core a from Jap on , a place no way commodious for their Defigns of Engroffing the Trade of China, as being too remote from Nangifaqui: Befides, that the North and South Winds are fo violent at their Seafons in thisStreight, between the two Coafts, that it is impofTible to come near the (hoar when they blow. The Prefident therefore having fuchgood luck in the Expulfion of the Vortugals out of Japon , doubted not but that he might obtain the fmall Ifland of Rifma , an Uland that had been wholly deferted ever fince the Habitations of the people had been deftroyU At firft he only defir’d leave to build a fmall Tenement for the conveniency of the Faftors. Now between this Ifland and Nangifaqui , there is only a narrow Frith) not above a Musquet Shot over. Here the Prefident defir’d the Gover- nour that he might make a Bridge of Boats for a moreeafie intercourfe between the City and the Port. The Governour gain’d by Prefents, gave him leave to build the Bridge • but feeing that the Hollanders made an ill ufe of it, and that they came too frequently and numeroufly into the City, he built two Forts at both ends of the Bridge, and furnifh’d them with Souldiers, who were to take notice who pafs’d to and fro. He alfo publilh'd an Order, That fuch Hollanders as came by day into the Town , (hould return to their Lodgings before night, upon pain of Death. This Order, and the little conveniency which they had for Lodging in their own Quarters, very much troubl’d them 5 fo that the Prefident made new Applications at Court, and obtain’d leave to build a Factory, and Warehoufes for their Goods. The Governour thereupon fent a Surveyor to the Hollanders, to mark out the Ground which the Emperour had given them to build upon. This perfon being largely rewarded, made them good meafure, and yet they were not contented 5 fo that in the Night-time they had enlarg’d their Quarters, by removing the firfi: marks. The Governour, being advertiz’d thereof, began to be very angry. but they found means to appeafe him with their Prefents: fo that he eafily condefcended to the flight reafons which they gave him for what they had done. Thus in a Sort time they finiflf d their work, which was without encompafs’d with a Walt, much like a Garden Wall, but within contain'd a real Fort, flanck’d and lin’d according to all the Rules of Art 5 and which, the outward Wall being beaten down , not only defended their Bridge, but commanded the entry into the Haven of Nangifaqui, They took great care not to admit any but Hollanders , for fear their Defign fhould be difeover’d. So that when the whole was finilh’d, the Prefident gave advice to the General at Batavia what he had done, defiring him to fend him eight Brafs Guns, fo broken, as to be eafily put together in the places where they were broken. He adviz’d him alfo to put them up in Hogfiieads, pack’d up like other Goods* and inftead of Mariners, to fend a good number of Souldiers, habited like Mariners, for the fecurity of the Faftory. But this Stratagem had not that fuccefs which heexpe&amp;ed - for about that time the Emperour had fent a new Governour to Nangifaqm: So that when the Ships arriv’d at Batavia, the new chang’d Officers, being more vigilant then Refor mer, coming to weigh the Bales as they were put afhore, and finding certain Hogfbeads at the bottom of the hold, which they could not re move by reafon of their weight, they prefently brake them up, and perceiving there the broken pieces of Canons, carry d fomeof themtotheGovernour 5 who immediately Tent intelligence thereof to Yeddo^ of which the Prefident had as fuddain notice by his Penfioners. He having his invention at command, repairs forthwith to the Emperour’s Court, and there tells the Emperour, That he had received Orders from his Superiours to prefent him with certain Peeces of Canon, made according to the nevyeft Invention of his Country, the ufe whereof was fo convenient, that they were with little difficulty and trouble to be drawn up, and made ufe of,where others could not poffibly be brought to play: and that he thought no Prefent could be more acceptable or fer- viceable to him, to render him Vi&amp;orious over his Enemies. Upon this the Emperour was very well fatisfi'd , and fent to the Governour of Nangijafii to fend him thofe Guns, andwithail, not to moleft the Hollanders 5 either in their Fa&amp;ory, or in vending their Wares, Having fo fortunately difengag’d himfdf out of thefe Briers, he lays another defign, and fends to the General at Batavia , a perfon of a turbulent and unquiet Spirit like himfelf, to fet out two Veffels, to make a difeoveryof all the Coaftsof Japon, and particularly of thofe Coafts which were next the Gold Mines, and to fee if they could find any fafe Harbour for Ships to ride in , in thofe tempeftuous Seas, or any places proper to fortifie, that they might no longer depend upon the uncertain humour of the Court of Japon, which was as inconftant as their Seas. The General provided two Ships, and furnifiui them with excellent Pilots, good Souldiers, expert Mariners, and Provifions for two years, with all other Neceffariesand Inftruments, as well for del ving as building. One of the feven of the General’s Council was chos’n Supervifor of the Enterprize. Tis faid , that thofe two Veffels skirted all along the Coafl: of Japan, from the Haft to the South, and from the South to the North, fetching a compafs about the Iflands to the 47 deg. of Northern Latitude, and that they difcoverM oneIfland which they call’d The States Jjland, and afterwards touch’d upon another Land which they nam’d The Company s Land, inhabited by White people, with long Hair, habited after the falhion , which they found to be a Continent adjoyning to Niulhan, and Corea ; and that after they had wander’d a long time upon the Sea, without any other defign then to make new Difcoveries, they pafs’d through the Streights of San^uar, which fepa rates the Land of Ye ftp from japon, and kept along thofe Coafts of Japon to the Eaft, to obferve the Bays of Aizu, and Xendai, where are the Gold Mines. In that part a furious Tempeft took them, in fight of the Mountains, wffiere the Gold Mines lye, which lafted four days together. The fecond of thefe Veffels run full againft a Rock, and fplit her felf, with the total lofs of every Mothers Son in the Veffel. The Admiral held out a longer time, but coafting the Land where 'he Mountains of Sataque appear, the Tempeft grew fo violent, that fhe alfb brake agaioft the Rocks. In thisjccond Ship- wrack only the Admiral, and thirteen perfons more efcapd, partly by the help of the Planks, and partly by Swiming. The Jafonners upon the Coafi: prefently ran to view them, and wonder’d to fee people in thofe parts, whole Language they did not underftand. Neverthelefs, they entertain’d them civilly enough 5 but in regard they were Stran gers, and that there was a ftrift prohibition not to, receive any Stran gers among them upon any pretence whatfoever, they w ere at a great fofs w hat to do with ’em, One, wifer then the reft, advis’d his * ~D 2 BrethrenA Relation 20 Brethren to carry them to the Emperour, whofe counfel was follow’d, and fo they took their journey toward Teddo , which was above a hun dred Leagues off. The Emperour, being inform’d of their arrival, order’d that they Should be civilly us’d. and at the end of eight days fent for them, and caus’d them to be ask’d, of what Country they were, and whatDefign brought them into his Seas? The Admiral, who w T as a perfon of a ready ingenuity, anfwer’d. That he was o. Hollander, who all his life time had ferv’d his Country as a Sonldier , where he had the command of a thoufand Horfe, and two thoufand Foot, at what time Fortune, or rather the care of preferving his Honour, forc’d him from his Native Soyl. I was, faid he, one of the chief Commanders in the Army, 'and though I fay it, my Service had gain’d me a fair reputation. The Prince, who commanded us, had a great confidence in me, which made one of his near Relations jealous of me 5 fo that he was not only content to do me all ill Offices with the General, but fought all occa sions to pick a quarrel with me. I dare be bold to fay, that had he not been fo nearly related to the Prince, I fhould not have taken his affronts fo long patiently. But at length he provok’d that patience to fuch a degree, and fo deeply and openly affronted me , that I was conftrain’d to meet him with my Sword in my hand. His misfortune and mine fo order’d it, that I kill’d him at the firft puili. My Friends affifted me to make my efcape, and kept me hid for fome days, thinking to have ap peas’d the Princes anger * but it continu’d fb violent, that they advis’d me to abfent my felf for fbme years. Therefore to render my Exile lefs tedious, and that I might be ftill doing fomething for the Service of my Country, I defir’d my Friends to furnifh me with two Ships, with a refolution to feek out and deftroy all thofe Pirates that infefted the Indian Seas. I have been in chace of them for a whole year together. and fometimes we met with Tempefts fo violent,that drave us we know not whither our (elves, my Pilots not being experienc’d in the Eaftern Seas, v Soon after meeting with another Temped: no lefs rude and boydrous, we were forc’d to let our Ships drive as the Winds themfelves w r ere pleas’d to force them, which at length drove us upon the Goads of this Empire, where we have fuffer’d Shipwrack, not having fav’d above fourteen of four hundred , which I brought along with me. Happy in fuch a misfortune, to be cad: upon the Territories of a Prince (b potent and generous, that, no quedion, will have compaffion upon our miferies. When the Interpreter had repeated this Relation to the Emperour, the Prince T and all the Lords of the Court Were very much concern’d, and admir’d both the Courage arid Alped: of the Stranger. The Emperour fent him very rich Prefents, and to all thofe of his Company 5 and gave Order, that he diouldbe condu&amp;edto, to the Holland Fadory , and that he fhould be well treated upon the way, during the whole journey, which was five and twenty or thirty days Travel. There this famous Champion Ray’d four Months, inexpedation of the Ships that come every year from Batavia to Jafon 5 fo that he had time enough to make a full Relation of the Lands which he had oblerv’d, and of all the particulars of the Shipwrack. One day as he was telling how he bed cajoll’d the Emperour, and that the Prefident was applauding thequick- ncfs of his wit for inventing fuch an imaginary piece of Knight- df :1 c Errantry,Errantry , a. yaponefi Boy that lerv’d the Prefident, heard all the dif- eourfe without being obferv d by his Mailer. Some. Months after the Prefident had beaten tins Boy , which he, as all the are ot a fiery and vindicative Nature, relolving to revenge, went tothe Governour of Nangifaqui , and repeated to him the whole Difcourfe between h.s Mailer and the Admiral. The Governour, finding it to be a bulinefs ot importance, Ibnds advice thereof to the Court &amp; The Emperour was lo enrag’d at the injury and affront put upon him that he commanded the Governour to Hop the Admiral and his Train and to lend him with a good Guard to Teddo , and not to let any Ship enter the Harbour, ’till he had had a full Examination of the matter This Order was not fo fecret, but that the Prefidents Friends had notice thereof, who prefently gave him intelligence of it fofeafonably that the Admiral was fent away before the Order came to the Governour Eight days after, three Holland Veffels arriv’d at Kifma, to whom the Governour fentexprefs command to keep out at Sea, and not to come adiore. The Prefident feigning to be lurpriz’d at this Prohibition, went to the Governour to know the reafon, who gave him this Anfwer, The Emperour, laid he, is acquainted with your tricks, you fhallhave no more kindnefs from me- I have fent to Court to give notice of the arrival of your three Ships, and I fhali follow my Orders when they come. Upon this the Prefident made no doubt but the Admiral’s ftory was difeover’d 5 and recolle&amp;ing with himfelf that he had beaten his Japonefe Boy, and that he was run away from him, he foori conje&amp;ur’d at the Author of all the mifehief. In fhort, the Governour receives his Orders, the Tenour whereof was, That he fhould fend away the three Veffels, without permitting them to land either Men or Goods* and that he fhould tell the Prefident, That the Emperour was fatisfi’d that the Admiral was a Cheat and a Spy, whom he intended to punifli feverely*, and therefore, if he did not fend for him tojxpon bythefirfl opportunity of the Winds, he would put to Death all thole of his Nation, and fling their Goods into the Sea* Upon the return of three Ships to Batavia , there was no fmall burly burly in the Ifland • for by them they underftood the danger that their Country-men were in, if they did not fend back the Admiral* There upon an extraordinary Council was call’d , to deliberate upon an affair of fo great importance, who were all of one mind, that the Admi ral was to be fent back, and that it was better for one tofuffer, then a whole Nation. The Admiral being advertiz’d of this their refoluti®n, publickly pro- tefted againft the violence and injuffice they were about to do him telling them, that he was born a Subject of the Republick of Holland, who had only the Power of his life and death; that in their Service, he would expofe his life to a thoufand hazards, but that he was not oblig’d to facrifice himfelf for the particular Interefts of a private Trade. The Minifters took his part, and made it a cafe in Religion. The common people mutiny J d againfl: the General, and the Tumult grew to that heat, that the Sea-men were fent for from aboard their Ships to difperfe the multitude. At length, by the interpofition of aMinifter , the bufinefs was brought to a conclufion ; who perfwaded the Admiral by his fmooth Language, to appeafe the diforderof the 3 eople, by fubmitting to the Refult of the Council, Thereupon he promis’dnromis'd to return to Japo , propvided they would allow him wliaTbe demanded, not only for his reward, but alfo that wmui (hould bear him out in that fame new part which he had in his head to ad. _ Tfirft he demanded two Ships magnificently trim d , a I rain of fifty chofenMen every one of which was to have three changes or Haoic, of the richeft Stuffs that could be had: Moreover 50000Crowns for his Voyage, a Cupboard of Gold and Silver Plate, with all Equipage proportionable, and that thofe that accompany d him fliould rcipedt him, asaperfonof great Quality. , . , , % r ,, * • 3 All this was allow’d him, and the Admiral departed from Batavu, znd arriv’d well at Nangtfrqm. The Governour iurpnz d at the beauty of the Veffels could not believe them to be Merchants , and therefore lent to know who they were; but he was more furpriz’d when he knew that it was the Admiral, Forthwith he difpatch d a Courner to the Lm- oerour to give him notice, and to inform him with what magnificence the Admiral was return’d. The Prefident alfo fent, that he might have a favourable reception, and to defire his Friends to let the Lmperour know, that this was a Perfonof great Quality, whom an Honourable Adtion had driven from his Country, and that he no (ooner underftood the accufation that lay againft him, but that he was return d with that Equipage that became him, to juftifie himfelf. ’Till the Order came, the Governour, according to cuftom, cans d all the Sails and Rudders of the Ships to be brought to him, not per mitting any perfon to come afhore. At length the Order came, that the Admiral and his Attendants (hould be receiv’d into the City, toge ther with all things neceffary for their perfons, and that they fhould be convoy’d to Teddo , and that in all places where they came,_ they fliould be nobly treated. The Prefident accompany’d the Admiral to aflift him, as well with his Councils , as with the favour of his Friends Their Entry was very magnificent, and the nchnefs or their Habits brought the people from all parts, as being mainly greedy after No velty fo that the noife thereof was fpread ail over the Court : Yet the Emperour would not admit them to their Audience upon the day winch 1 Two Months were elaps’d, during which time the Admiral kept open Table, and difplay’d his dafling Riches to the Eyes of the and being of a quick and apprehenfive wit, he caus’d himfelt to be in- fttufted in the Language of the Ifland, and in a fliort time he beganto un derhand many Words. When the Emperour fent for him,he clad himieir and his Train in a richer Habit then that which they had on when he made his Entry. At firft the Emperour feem’d to be angry; lunderltanc, faid he, that thou art an Impoftor and a Traytor, that thy bum' obfcure, and that thou art come as a fpy into my Kingdom, and thereto I am refolv’d to punifh thee according to thy merits. &gt; Wheu the Interpreter had explain’d the Emperours words, Admiral with an undaunted countenance, Sir, faid he, a Pnnce o great as you are, {hould rather be a comfort and fupport to the un oi - nate, then add to their afflidion. Fortune, that perlecutesme, in nothing been more cruel to me, then in raifing thofe Calumnies, with which (lie has endeavour’d to blemiih my reputation with your i ‘ iefty. She might expell me my Country, and cad: me upon unknov^ /anrl ftw 1 * 3 \A 7 nr 1 rl . blit” fhp nan never inipme mme thoughts unworthy of my Birth. This is the feeond time I have been within your Dominions, the firft by occafion of Shipwrack, thefecond to obey your Majefties commands. The firft accufes none but the Winds. And had I been guilty of what I am accus’d,! (hould never have ventur’d my felf into your hands fo far off from your Power. But ^ Sir , my Accufers have one advantage which I have not *, they fpeak your Language, I underhand it not, nor how to make you apprehend the truth of my junification. Allow me eight Months to learn the Speech of your Country, and then, if you will befogratious as to hear me , I make no doubt but to confound my Accufers, and to fatisfie your Majefty in all things. The Emperour was furpriz’d, and mov’d with his Anfwer , but more efpecially at his requeft of eight Months to learn the Languagei I grant it thee, faid the Emperour, for it is but juft that a perfon ac cus’d fhould have both the Liberty and means to do it. And in the mean time I will take care that thou be honourably entertain’d in all places where thou haft a defire to refide. The Admiral us’d this Liberty with fo much prudence, and got fo much the love of the Courtiers by his carriage and his liberality, that by their converfe, he not only learnt the Language, but by Ivertue of their good Charader, the Emperour would often fend for him, and ask him feveral Queftions concerning our Europe , in reference to the Qualities of the Countries, the Manners of the People, the feveral Forms of Government, the Extent of the feveral Kingdoms, their Riches , Strength , and War-like Difcipline ; of all which, the Admi ral gave him fo handfome an Accompt * that the Prince took great de light in hisDifcourfe. And at length he had gain’d fo much the favour and confidence of the Emperour, that he utterly laid afide all the ill thoughts which he had of him , and condemn’d to Death, as a falfe Witnefs, and a Traducer, the Japonefe that had accus’d him. After fo fortunate an efcape, the Admiral thought it but common prudence to make a fair retreat in the Grandeur of his Reputation , and thereupon he took leave of the Emperour, who loaded him with Honours and Prefents. The Courtiers were alfo lorry for his departure, fo that fomeof them accompany’d him back, and took order for his entertain ment, which was very magnificent all the way to Nangifaqui , where he took Shipping a few days after, and return’d to Batavia* All the People throng’d to the Port to fee him when he Landed. He told them in few words the fuccefs of his Voyage. Some applauded his ingenuity and courage 5 others extoli’d the Service which he had done the Company and Nation. The Council receiv’d him alfo with thanks and praifes, and gave him all the Gold and Plate which he had brought back. A while after he departed for Amftcrdam, where he was no fooner arriv’d, but he prefented a Petition to the States General againft the Company, for fending him back to , and for reparation of the violence and injury done him. The bufinefs was long in debate, but at laft the Company was condemn’d to pay hirri great damages, and Intereft for the fame. But to return to the Prefident: He began now to be weary of being confin’d to one Factory, though he made up his Pack well enough where he was. But his Ambition carry’d him farther, and he thought he had done Service enough to be advanc’d to a higher Dignity. Neb7 24 A elation ther was his prefence fo neceffary at Japon, where he had fettl’d the Dutch Trade in as good a condition as it could well be. And in truth, the Hollanders had then almoft the whole Trade of the Eajl-indies. They had taken from Bi/ghjh, Forme ft, Ambojna, mAVooleron, and by that means engrofs’d all the Trade of Cloves, Mace, andNutmegs. They had taken Baton by furprizc. The Inhabitants of the Celebes, Ternate, and Tidor, were become their Vaffals-, and the King of Ma- caffar having made an Alliance with them, had ejipdi’d the ivrtqgsstfes out of his Dominions. By means of their Faftories in Sumatra they had got all the Pepper Trade of the Weftern Coaft of that Wand into their hands, befidesfeveral other advantages which they had in feveral other places, where they had encroach’d upon the Portugds, Spaniards, and the Engkjb themfelves. The -India Company at that time enter tain’d 140*Ships, part Men of War , and part Merchant-men, pro vided with great Guns , Ammunition, and Provifionof all forts, and in thefe Ships above 6000 Men , part Souldiers, part Mariners. Bata via was the Soul of their Conquefts,made upon the Ruins of theP^r^- otiefes, which had they lain ail together, would have made a large Empire, and by which they might have grown infinitely rich, had not the expences of their Navies and Souldiers eaten out the gains of their vaft Trade. One of their wifeft Generals told me frequently, m have, faidhe, hut too many Fortrejfes, we need m more then the Cape of Good Hope, and Batavia, Fatt one swell fettl'd, good Ships, andhonejl Men to ferve ws. For in fhort, their Officers pillage unmercifully,and caufe the Commerce and Dominion of their Country-men to be detefted by the Indians, through their Covetoufnefl and Cruelty. I know my felf,that in the year 1664, the Expences of the Hollanders in the Fall-Indies amounted, commmihus annis, to twelve Millions a year, not to reckon Shipwracks, decay of Ships, and waft of Goods, and yet their Cargo’s for Afia and Europe have not amounted to above ten Millions *, and fometimes the Cargo’s are fo mean, that the Receits do not anfwer the Expences. Neverthelefs their perfeverance and courage were worthy of admiration. For what could be more to be admir’d , then to fee that a final! number of Merchants, affembled at firft upon thefinglefcoreof Trade, fhould afterwards prefume to make War in Regions fo far diftant, aflail fo many Princes and Nations, plant fo many Colonies, befiege fo many Cities and Forts, and laftly, let forth fo many Navies at fuch prodigious Expences, that it would put many potent Soveraigns to a plunge to do as they did if This was the Eftate of the HollandEaJLjndi a Company, atwhattime thePrefident, the principal Subjed of this Relation , was recall’d from Japon to Batavia, there to take upon him the Office of Chief Fnrettor. He carry’d thither great ftore of Wealth, and built feveral magnificent Houles in the City. His Authority alfo was very large v but he exer cis’d it according to his ufual cuftom, and was hated by all the Officers of the Company , and the Citizens themfelves. He thought himfelf fecure of the Employment of General, but he was deceiv’d in his hopes; upon which he took pet, and return’d for Amjfardam, where he livd quietly for fome years. At length his turbulent and ambitious Spirit put him upon new Defigns, to revenge the injury which bethought he had receiv’d. To which purpofe he return’d to the Indies. His undertaking was not fo profperous for thofe that employ d him , and who merited to I0 Jit int ret_JV*. A R E I.

The Thirteenth of July, 1665. the Sieur Lalia , Gentleman in Extraordinary to the King, and the Sieur de U BouUye, a Gentleman of Anjou^ with the Sieurs Beber &gt; Mariage , and du Pont, Deputies of the new French Company, for the fettling of Trade in Perfia and the Indies , arriv’d at Ijpahsw, and took up their Lodgings at Zulpha, being the Suburbs of the fame City, where alfo at that time liv’d the Sieur Vpfioile , a French Merchant. Ldin and Poulaye, without faying any thing to the Deputies, deliver’d to L* Ejloile the Letters which Monfieur had written to him; the Infcrip- tion whereof was thus. T 0 Mr, L’ Eftoile, firft Valet du Chambre to the King of Perfia , or in his abfence , to Mr, Logis, his Son in Law, Which was not a little to be admir’d at by \\\z Franks, who had fojourn’d any time in that Country , to find that Monfier Botdaye , who had been be fore in Perfia , and (liould have better underftood the Cuftom of the Court, (hould be no better able to inftrud a Secretary of State , then to let him give the Title of Falet du Chambre to the King of Perfa, who wIk file (jjT fj with , ti ] wJiie : Gran : bo: ! wait In For i finy, Lette: | of tin ! to fee 1 ' of thf fldii T e Dotnit td, lengtl tb 1 Iffth placet Ho Jay ; cbi/is ] Hew to the Atler corre( 2d in, Style, aod pi all the pany, teds, btiei tlier tc Saving Mgn b tc be, Som fen bfo ao(l w } ttlfai T'Negotiation of the Deputies y &amp;c. who has none to ierve him in his Chamber but Eunuchs, and never fuffers v a C hrijtim to touch his Habits, for fear of being defil’d. The purport of the Letters , was to admonilh VEjloile to fupport, affifty and protect the Deputies in the Bufinefs upon which the Com*, pany had fent them *, and in cafe of Ioffes by the way, to furnilh them with fuch neeeffaries as they fhould want. The King of Perfu was then three days journey froni ifpahw 5 for which reafon a Meffenger was difpatch’d with a Letter to the Nazar , or Grand Mafter of the Houfe, and another to the Mirztfekw , or his Lieutenant, to Enow whether his Majefty would command them to wait on him there, or whether they fhould expert his return to ifpahan. In the mean while the Deputies could not agree amongft themfelves: Lor the three Merchants Beber ^ Mariage , and du Pont affirm’d , that the two Gentlemen were only interefted by the by in this Negotiation - and that having no right to take cognizance of the Affairs of the Com pany, they ought not to trouble themfelves any farther, then the King’s Letters dire&amp;ed them, in the affairs of the Company. That the Effect of the King’s Letters was no more, then that two Gentlemen, defirous to fee the Court of were joyn’d with the Deputies of the Com pany 5 and therefore it belong’d to them only to treat with the Minifiers of the King of Perfia. That the Gentlemen had no more to do then to deliver the King of France's Letter to the Perfian King , and to defire a nomination of Commiflioners to treat with the Deputies. This con- teft, which all the Franks in vain endeavour’d to compofe, came at length to t\is Nazar's Ears 5 who was flrangely furpriz’d at it, having then a defigti to procure an Order from the .King to remove out of jfpaban and the Suburbs , all the chrifiiam of what opinion foever, and place t hem over againft Zalpha. However, the Deputies rais’d new obje&amp;ions and difficulties every day • which Father Raphael of Mans, Superiour of the Order of Capu chins in Perfia , employ’d all his credit and induftry to accommodate. He wrote them out feverai forms of a Letter, which they were to fend to the Nazar • but thofe that pleas’d the one Party, did not like the other. At length Father Raphael^ weary of fcribling and altering, amending and corre&amp;ing , and all to nopurpofe- told them ferioufly , they did ill to adin fuch a manner, and to infiff upon idle formalities 5 that the Per fan Style, wherein they ought to write to the Naz^ar , ought to be concife and plain, without fuperfluities, or impertinencies• and laffly, that all their contentions did but redound to the difadvantage of the Com pany , whofe Interefts they pretended to manage. After feverai con- tefts &gt; Father Raphael y at iaft, finifffd the Letter to the content of both Parties, which was tranfcrib’d into the Perfian Language ; with ano ther to the Mirzateker , and both were difpatch’d away. Hhz Nazar bavin 0- read it, prefentiy inform d the King of the French Companies defign', and of the arrival of the Deputies. His Majefty commanded him to let them know that they were welcome, and that in a fhort time, he would return to tfpffan , and give them Audience. Sopc few dayes after, the Court return’d to Jfpahan^ and while the King flopp’d at one of his Houfes near the Gates of the City, the Nazar fent for Father Raphael , to know of him who th&amp;French Deputies were, and who had fent them into Perfia , to which the Father gave him the beft fatisfa&amp;ion he could. For the Nazar wonder’d that they were . - ~ 1 ' ' £ 2 cor ne .^nujucome into the Kingdom, and fent, as they laid, from fuch a potent Prince, and yet that the Gbvernours of Erivariatift Tauri* Ihould know nothing of their paffage through thofe Cities. The Athemadoulet alfo was in the fame Aitonifhment *, and it gave them reafotl to fufped both the Quality of their Perfons, and the Reality of their Commiffiom For either they were ignorant of the cuftbm of the Country,-or elfe they did ill to travel mogniio, like ordinary Tradefrhen, and Perforrs of mean condition. But Father Ktfhd'tt having afford them, that they were fent by the King of Erance to fettle a Company of Trade, and that he had Letters of Advice thereof out of Europe , the Nazar bid Father Raphael tz\\ the Deputies they (hould be irt a readinefs, for that the King would give them Audience in a few days. But the former mifunderftanding, ftill continuing between the Gen tlemen and Deputies, Father Raphael fearing fome mifehievous confe- quence of it in the prefence of the King, or that they fliould make fome difpCite for priority, the Father reprefented to the Nazar, that whereas the Deptuies were of two Orders, the one of Gentlemen, and the other of Merchants- therefore to take away ail fufpition of jealoufie, it would do well, that His Majefty would be pleas’d when he admitted them to their Audience, to permit the Gentlemen their feats on the one fide, and the Merchants on the other. Which the Nazar approv’d, and the King allow’d of the fame day. The 27 th of September, the King being at his Palace of Scader- jUas/ ? upon the bank of the Rivet, between the Bridge of Zulpha, .and the Bridge of Schiras, causa a preparation of Artificial Fire-Works to be made, which came to above iooo L and early in tile Morning caus’d notice to be given, that he intended that day to give audience to the King of Franee s Deputies. Father Raphael alfo had Order to be ready with the Deputies, to the end, the Meheiner/der , or Mafter of the Ceremonies, might not be oblig’d to wait. Accordingly that very day the Mehemender came to L'Efloile's Houfe, and from thenee con duced the Deputies, with all their Train, and the reft of the Franks then refident in thofe parts all mounted on Horfe-back, with a marchfo flow and grave, and for the advantage of the fight fo far about, that it was almoft Night before they arriv’d at Scader-Ahhas ; at what time the Mehemender enter’d the Palace alone, leaving the Merchants at the Door. In the mean while, the Merchants believing that Father Raphael did notfavourthemfomuchas the Gentlemen, cry’d out aloud, that they w^ould have an Interpreter alfo for themfelves, or elfe would go no farther. Fa^heV Raphael, who aded only by the /fear’s Order, and for the advantage of the F/mr/j Nation, told them, that whither they went any farther or no it was all One to him: that for his part he was not there as an Interpreter, either for the one or the other, butonlyin obedience to the King’s commands. In the mid’ft of this debate the Mehemender return’d to carry the De puties to their Audience 5 five hundred Musketeers being rank’d in order upon the bank of the River, to give them a Volley as they pafs’d along. Lh^Jide^emenders march atfirft was flow and grave,but approaching the place where the King was, and from whence he had a view of the De puties, he caus’d them to double their pace to the foot of the Steps, where the Lackeys took offtheir Shooes-and from thence they proceeded into the Hall of Audience, where the Katis, and other great Lords were fitting.2 9 Negotiation of the Deputies, &amp;c. fitting. Upon each fide ftood the Youth of Quality-* fumptuoufly clad in Tiffue oi Gold and Silver, their Cloaks and Mantles being lin'd with Martins, Sables, and other rich Furs. The Deputies being come into the King’s prefence, the Mehemender caus’d them to kneel, and bow thetr Heads to the Ground three times: That done, he caus’d them to rife , and lead up Z^/z/zbythe hand alone , as being the perfon who had in charge the prefenting of the Letter to the King. After him follow’d Bonlaye y and the reft of the Deputies, and thus they mounted up to the place where fate the Athemadoulet^nd the Nazar* The King was feated upon a ScaffoldLome what higher then the reft, encom- pas’d with 150 young Gentlemen magnificently clad, to whom the Sienr Lalin^ at the head of the Deputies, made his compliments in French, and then humbly prefented the Kings Letter, feafd with a flat Seal upon a flying Label, enclos'd in an Embroider’d Box, with the Arms of France and Navar, in relief, upon the Lid. Father Raphael explain’d to the King the effed: of Lalins Speech., After which the King gave a little bow with his Head, and at the fame time gave a fign to the Mafter of the Ceremonies to carry them back to their places. Being came to the bottom of the Hall, where the Officers had Order to feparate the Gentlemen from the Merchants, the Officers by miftake put Bottlaye with two of the Merchants, and Manage one of the Mer chants with Ldin, which made BouUye cry out aloud in the Turkifb Lan guage Menbeg-Zadde , I am a Gentleman - but the thing being done, and the King being prefent, there was no help. Then the P^^Mufick began to play for a quarter of an Hour; which having given over, the Mafter of the Ceremonies-came again, and carried up Father phael, and the two Gentlemen, as he fuppos'd, of which Manage by the fo rementioned miftake happen'd to be one, again to the King: at what time Lalm with a comely grace made his Harangue, and fet forth theoccafion of his Deputation to HisMajefty, of which HisMajefty teftifi’d his good liking by a nod of his Head. For Lalin had a handfom prefence, and fpake with an acceptable Tone, and his magnificent Habit very much added to tlie comely Air of his Perfon. The Speech was expounded by Father Raphael- which when he had done, the King ask’d the Deputies feveral Queftions, and then with his hand made them a fign to retire to their places, beck’ning at the fame time to Father Ra- fhael to ftay- and caufing him to come near him, more particularly in form’d himfelf of the Power of the King of France, the Extent of his Dominions, his Military Difcipline, and his Councils: of all which the Father gave him the heft accompt he could, and then with the King’s leave , retir’d to his place. This Scene being over , a Flagon of Gold, and a Giafs were fent to the Deputies, attended with a Abort Banquet of Fruits, and other (brts of Food * the Inftrumental and Vocal Mufick playing all the while. Which being over, the King again lent for Lalin, Manage, andLathex Raphael, and after afhort Difcourfe, having difmifs’d all butfather Raphael, he fell into a difpute with him touching the Unity of the Divine Nature, ithe necelfity of one Prophet, and how Mahomet was the Seal and Crown of all Prophets. He feem d to admire that the Franks, who had the Reputation of being People or Wit and Difcretion, could think Chnfito be a God: to all which parti culars, the Father endeavour’d to give theKing the beft ktisfaCtion he could. But then, Tather Raphael being defirous that the three Deputiesfliould partake of the King’s favour as the other two had done. Where upon the King fentforthe other three Deputies, and having difcours’d awhile with BouUye , while Father Raphael interpreted between them, in alhort while he difmilVd them all again, but Father Raphael, with whom he enter’d into a more jocular Dilcourfe then the former, of the Colours, Black and White, and of the Beauty of the Women, the King confeffing that naturally he did not love Brown Women, the White completion being more agreeable to him, as being that com plexion which alone compos’d the Beauty of Women. The Father modeftly made his anfwer, that Beauty confifted only in fancy- for that the Perfians lov’d thick anddiull Eyebrows, which were not at all eheem’d in Prance, Then the King cafting his Eyes upon the Box wherein, the King of Letter lay, he took otat the Letter, and obferving it to be a fmall piece of Parchment, and not fuch a one as he had receiv’d from feveral Princes, and Potentates of Europe, nor indeed like thofe which the Jefttits had brought him formerly from the King of France himfelf, in a fair piece of Parchment, with a large Seal deep cut, he gave evident Demonftrationsof his contempt of it, and was about to have thrown it away. Father Raphael perceiv’d him to be out of humour, to whom the King in purfuance of his diflike, faid , Ra phael, Inever receive open Letters without a Seal, take it, and let me fee it no more, for I do not believe it comes from fo great a King as the King of France , and at the fame time made him a lign to retire. He durlt do no otherwife then take the Letter, and fo returning to his place, he told both Lalin and Mariage what had pafs’d in his Difcourfe be tween him and the King. Two hours, after that, were fpentin be holding the Mummeries of their common Dancers, a paftime very ufual in Perjia, Which being over, the King fent again for Lalin, Mariage , and the Father ^ and after fome few Queftions, to whith they gave thebeft Anfwers they could, he again difmifs’d both the Deputies, retaining only Father Raphael with him. The Father, then taking his opportunity, told the King, that he had always obferv’d it to be the cuftom of the Athemadoulet to caufe the Letters, which the European Princes fent His Majelfy, to be interpreted in his prefence. And therefore, added the Father, I befeech Your Majefty to permit me to give the King of Prance’sLzttzt to Khz Athemadoulet , to the end, it may be truly interpreted to him according to ufual cuftom. Thereupon the King made a fign to the Father to give it him, and glad he was to be fo rid of it. The Father obferving the King in a good humour, fpoke to him in behalf of the other three Deputies, that he would be pleas’d to admit them to be fent for a fecond time, in regard the others had been fent for three times. But the King told him, it was enough for him to fpeak to the Gentlemen, let his Minifters talk with the Merchants. The Father being then difmifs’d, he fent for alone, for whom he fhew’d himfelf to have a very great kindnefs and affedion 5 and at the fame time commanded the Nazar to bring him the next day, together with Yzxhzx Raphael , and the Genevefe , who was retain’d in his Service, to Court, for that he intended to be merry with them. Then he went on,and told Lalin,that fo foon as the French Ships were arriv’d,he would fend an Embaftadour to the King of France , and make a ftridt Alliance with him. Lalin reply’d, that His Majefty of France defir’d nothing more. Why then, reply’d the King, is not my Alliancefuffi- , cientNegotiation of the Deputies, &amp;c. 3 1 cient, but that you muft go feek the Alliance of the Blacks, from whom you will not draw thofe advantages, with which 'you flatter yourfelves? For you muftknow, that the Deputies kept their affairs fo fecret, that no body knew of them but all the World, the Servants as well as the Matters. Not confldering, that the Perfians are good Poli ticians, and that that Court is never without Spies. Therefore the King knew, that as foon as the Deputies had difpatch’d at his Court, they were to depart for the Indies , with which Nation he keeps no good Correfpondence. And for that reafon, he was not a little offended with them, though they endeavour’d to perfuade him, that their Errand to the Indies was only for Linnen and Spices. The Deputies prefented to the King a very fair Fuz.ee , together with the Kings Pidlure, in little, drawn to the Life, which was fo much the more efteem’d, becaufe at the fame time feveral large Cuts had been brought to ifpahan, and prefented to the King, which perfe&amp;ly agreed with the Pidure in Oyl, by which the whole Court was convinc’d that it was the real Portraiture of the King. When thefe Prefents were laid before the King, he ask’d the Deputies, for which of the Eattern Na tions the French had moft affetttion • to whom M. Lalm made anfwer, that certainly for the Perfian • thereupon the King return’d , that cer tainly they had reafon • for that the Perfians were white , like the French, and that it w^as impofhble for them to have any affedion for the Indians who were black. At length the King, to fhew the Deputies his higheft favour, would have them drink the HEZARD P1CHE , in a golden Cup, which holds about a Pintof Paris. Reorder’d the Wine to be the fame which he drank himfelf, which was in a Bottle of Chryftal Glafs, Budded with Diamonds. drank couragioufly, and fodid Mariage ^ but Father Raphael made a fair exeufe, and got off. After midnight the Zerhaftes , or Table-Cloaths of Cloth of Gold were fpread upon the Floor, and feveralroafted Viands very hot of the Spice, and Difhes of Salt Fifh , purchas’d from the Cafpian Sea, were brought and fet upon the Cloaths • together with feyeral Paftrie Meats , dry d Raifins, Comfits, Almonds, and Piftaches, and other provocatives to drink. The repaft being ended, feveral Buffonsw r ere brought in, who Sung and Dancd after the Turkifb fafhion, and made a hundred wry Mouths and ugly Faces. Among the reft of the Divertifements, there were two Men introduc’d, that play’d one againft another with each a Battoon in his hand, with a piece of Linnen dipt in Naphta, ty’d to the end of the Stick, which caft forth a very clear brightnefs in the dark 5 at the fame time four artificial Whirle-Winds were made to rifeone after another, which were all hovering in the Air at once, and in a continual Agitation. ^ Three Hours after Midnight the Mafters of the Ceremonies came to raife the Deputies to take leave of the King; and fo leading them to the lower end of the Hall, after a profound reverence, they retir d, not one perfon beflde ftirring out of his place, to the end they might lave time to take their Shoes without confufion. When they were gone, the Kin^ difmifs’d the Court, and then it is that the croud is 10 , that not one in twenty but lofes their own , and gets whofe-ever Shoes he can lay his hands on. . The Deputies and Father Raphael being upon their return home, by that time they got half way,met an Officer belonging to the Athemadoulet, -h;who told Father that his Matter expeded the French Begzades at his Houle by Ten a Clock next Morning, to treat them, by his Majefties Order. Father Raphael^ Ldin, and Boulaye^ were pun&amp;ual to their time 5 and no fooner did the Athemadonlet know of their arrival, but he came down into his Hall of Audience, to receive them, where he had alfo order’d a very fair Banquet to be ready for their entertainment. There Father left them, while he went with the Atbemadoulet's Secre tary, to Tranttate the King of France's Letter into the Perfian Lan guage; which being hnilh’d, and he come again into the Hall, after ieveral Civilities paft on both fides, the Father and the Deputies return’d to Zalpha. The Merchant Deputies offended at the Honour which the Gentle men had receiv’d, would have gone in their Turn*, but Father Raphael told them , that it was not the Cuftom in Perfia to vifit the Prime Mi- nifter, without being feat for. lathe Evening, Father Raphael, and the Begzades received new Orders to attend the King, but the King ftirr’d not out that Evening, fo that their Journey was in vain. The Merchants ftifl perceiving the Honours which were done the Gentlemen, and believing Father Raphael to be the caufe of all, they began to rail at him, and give him foul Language, and threaten’d to write into France to give an accompt of his behaviour. Father Raphael netled at the Language of the Deputies, told them, that he had done what in him lay to procure them the fame Honours, which the others had receiv’d, though they were fodittle fenfible of it. That he would continue his endeavours for the Advancement of their Affairs, though not for their own fakes, yet for the fake of the Company, that had fent them. Which anfwer, though it were fliarp enough, and fliew’d that the Father was angry, yet he did not forget, that they were his Coun trymen ; fo that he ventur’d to carry them twice to the Prime Minifter of his own accord, contrary to the Cuftom. The firft time he was not to he fp.oken with. The fecond time, he made an Errant to him with the three Deputies , to prefent him a Copy of the Letter from the Diredors of the Compinyyin the Perfian Language *, at which time he fhew’d them the Deputies, acquainting him withal that thofe were the Perfons with whom he was to treat in point of Trade. To which the Athemadeulet reply’d, that he had no Commiftton from the King to meddle with thofe Deputies, but only, to entertain the Begzxde that brought the King’s Letter, which he had already done. Thereupon the Father defir’d him he would be pleas’d to fpeak to the King to nomi nate Committioners to treat with them , which the Athemadculet pro mis’d to do. That day in the evening, a Mettenger was fent to Father Raphael , to acquaint him, that the King had appointed the Nazar to treat with the Deputies the next day, and to know their demands. Of which the Father gave the Deputies quick intelligence. The nextiday, being the Firft of September , Father fail’d not to be with the Deputies very early in the Morning , to bring them to thz Nazar 5 but he was very much furprizM to fee, that they would not go altogether, but ftill loo’k with an evil Eye one upon another, and continued their former differences. To the end therefore that he might fet things to rights, he went to the Nazar, arnd'told him , that he thoughtit would be thebeft way for the Merchants Deputies to come ;dv firft?Negotiation of tbs Deputies &gt; &amp;c. 3 firft becaufe that they were the Perfons with whom he was chiefly to TreaV The Ndzf.r anfwer’d , that the King underftood that they were all five in the fame Commiflion joyntly. To which, when the Father anfwer’d the fecond time, that it would be the bell; way to do as he had propos’d 5 The Nazar with a Surly Countenance, why, What’s the matter now &lt; laid he to the Father; Are not you Fremh-mcn alham’d to be thus at odds one with another , and to give all the World, nay the very Foot-boys occafion todifcourfe of your Divilions t What would they havens think of them and their Commifliont Are they fo little afraid of offending the King t Or, is their King more indulgent then the King of Perfu who would never pardon fuch faults in his Subjects' To this rebuke the Father made no reply. Only he defir’d the , that he mifht have two Horfe-men to attend the Deputies at Znlfha, telling the Nazar not a word of hisdefignto bring the Merchants an Hour fooner then the Gentlemen. This fell out to the Fathers defire ; Forthe Father lent one of the Horfe-men to Zalpba, to the Gentlemen, with order to drink with them, and nottobeover hafty, but to bring them fair and bftlv along with him; with the other he made haft to the Merchant D 'Duties f and caufing them to double their pace, they got betimes to the Atom’s Houfe, where they were civilly receivd. prefented the Nazar with the Deputies Comm.flion tranflated into the Per/,* language, after which they fell into a difeourfe, which lafted above SqSrtesof an Hour, concerning the Cuftoms Tolls, and Qua ky o? the Merchants , and thejuftnels of the french intheir Dealing, They had juft finilh’d their Difeourfe of Trade, when the Nazar was advertiz’d that the three Gentlemen were arriv’d; who thereupon Sefir’d Father ^W to go and receive them. The Father went and waked upon them in, neatly chiding them for having ftayd fo long, and making the Nazar wait. Well faid he, no w you are to g et ^ er ’ S 0 into that Cabinet, and write down your demands, and the Articles of vour Commiflion. The Merchant Deputies, which had now dif- cours’d with the Nazar what they had to lay , were well enough con- tentTto enter into a General Conference with the Gentlemen. Then calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, they made a draught of their Demands, die chief of which were, three Years Immunity from Cuftoms and Tolls to bemn from the time of the arrival of our Ships ; and that Ifrer that they fliould enjoy all the Priviledges and Favours granted to attertnat, t y ,lio defir’d precedence above all other Nations,, - «•«» tolted, t h« they h,d at the Court of the Grand Signiot. And Mly, they tequ.td a Home i m write them in the mfian Charader; which being done , ^dtetSiStn the hearing of the Depn.iea, the took the Paper to prefent to the king. w i t h Mufic, both Vocal Thus after ' f ir ® a g Ue J^ er / dl i s &gt;d by the Ar, Z ,r , who- bid and laftrumental, t p t ^ wou | d do them all the Favour that themrely uponhtscare J Majefties Anfwer in a fhort time. K DqSV^ISaiydwithrUa«-; s teoegtion.• afterwards a Prefent, which was a Shame both to the Nation and the Company , that pretended to fuch great and high things 5 and endea vour’d to fix an opinion of their Wealth and Grandeur among Strangers. For they fent him only a Tin Cup Enamel’d , and eight little Gales of Perfpe&amp;ives, or Looking-Glaffes, the whole not amounting to above 40 Crowns. They alfo made much fuch another Prefent, but meaner to the Mirzdteker , confifting of about a Dozen Pair of Gilt Sciflars for Women. Wemuft fpeak the Truth : For they were not a little laught at for their ridiculous Prefents, which were the Scorn and Contempt of thofe that receiv'd them, when the Deputies were gone. To Father Raphael they prefented a Purfe, with 40 Tomans , or Six Hundred Crowns in it, believing that he would never accept of it* and indeed he refus'd it with {corn 5 not a little angry with them , that they fhould have fuch mean thoughts of him 3 as to believe him Mercenary. Two days after 5 the gave notice to the Father, that the King had granted the their Demands 5 and had order’d every one of them a Ca/aat, or a Veft-Royal, and in refpedlof Superiority, a Horfe for Monfieur La/in. That the Kings Anfwer and the Grant were both ready for the Dire&amp;ors of the Company , according to their defire. The King was then onward upon a journey to Afazandran ^ three days Travel from Ifpahan, at one of his Palaces, call’d Tajahat. A Pleafant Situation, in the mid’ff of a great Valley 3 fiiaded with Trees and full of Villages. The Ninth of came a Letter from the Nazar ^ to Father Ra phael, fignifyiug the King's Pleafure, that both he and the Deputies fhould repair to Tajabat with all fpeed. Thereupon the Father and they made fuch haft, that in lefs than three days they got to Taj ah at , where the order’d them to lye in the Houfe of an Armenian Renegado. The King fent them immediately eight or ten bottles of Wine, with four Gold Dilhes, full of lovely Fruits, and Tapiftries for their Dining Room. But thefe Prefents occafion’d new Quarrels 5 For there being two Fa&amp;ions, and both living apart, there was a great difpute who fliould have this prefent. Father Raphael, having done all that poffible he could to reconcile the bufinefs, and not being able to perfuade them, in a juft Paffion, bid them take their Swords and Piftols, and go and decide the Quarrel in the Field. Till now, faid he, I have done all I could to conceal your deteftable divifions from the Court, which neverthelefs, isbut too well acquainted therewith : Is it your defign to publifii your own Ignominy, and to make not only your /elves, but the whole Nation of the French ridiculous to the Perfians ? At length they were fo far reconcil'd , that one Room ferv’d them to Feed, and con/equently the fame Furniture. For the Fathers reproofs had put them a little out of Countenance. . The Seventeenth of Ottober , the Mehemander came to the Deputies Lodgings, and brought five Royal Vefts- The Richeft, which was of Tiftiieof Gold, was for Monfieur Lalin^ the next, not altogether fo rich, for Monfieur Boulaye- and the other three of a lower price, for the Merchants • The value of the whole might amount to 600 Crowns, for which the French Deputies moft generoufly gave the Officers that brought them *5 or 30 Crowns, as a Gratuity. The Officers of the Stable'Negotiation of the ‘Deputies ^ &amp;c. Stable alfo brought two Horfes for the Gentlemen , for which they receiv’d fix Crowns in Gold, as a reward. I confefs, I (hould have been afiiam’d of fuch a poornefs of Spirit, at fuch a time as that. At length alfo the Ragan or Patent for the Company was deliver’d into the Hands of the Deputies, faithfully Tranllated by Father Raphael to this E(fed:. . &lt; u That whereas the Merchants of the Kingdom of France, who are cc favour’d by the Favour extreemly Royal, and the Juftice exceflively tc Royal, being made conftant in the hope and participation in the ’have prefented their Petition, which is arriv’d at the Ear cc cc cc cc a u CC time, nave piuLiucu j. , &gt;v . . of the Minilters Commiflioners for the Court of Grandeur and high Fortune-, Their Intentions and Demands have found^theVifageof Acceptation, and we have (Iri&amp;ly commanded,that theConfervatours of Rights, Tolls and Priviledges, acknowledge them for exempt and priviledg’d, during the fpace of Three Years; and that there be nothing demanded upon their Goods and Fadfories, conformable to the requeft of the Deputies , &amp;c. The next day, the Mehem^der Jinchi , came early in the Morning to attend the Deputies, and bring'them with all (peed to the Court; Where being admitted into the Garden, they met the King a Hone- back and all the Court a Foot. The Athenmdoulet held the King s Anfwer to the King of France, in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, Seal d with the Kings Seal upon red Spanijh Wax. The Sieur , and the reft of the Deputies were order’d to go neer and Kifs the Kings Boot, who kept his Grandeur, without (peaking a word. When they had fodone, the Athnnadoulet calling them to him, there, laid he , theie is the Anfwer for the Grand Cha , that is , for the King of the Kings of France The Deputies having made their Obeyfances to the King, the whole Court took Horfe; and the King took the Road of Cuban ; and within an Hour, that Campaign, which lookdlike a thick peopld City, became as Defert as the moft part of Pcrjia&gt; _ The Deputies, having read over the Patent, began to find many defeds and Mariaoe would fain have follow’d the Court for amendments, and would have perfuaded Calm and Father Raphael to have gone along with him. But Father Raphael over-perfuaded them to return firft to their Lodgings at zdpha , and there to hear the Patent diftindly rea Tver and to confider better of it. When they came to Zulpha , ,nd that they had debated upon the meet Letter of the Patent, then they were worfe mad then they were before. Then there were lo many Cavils, fo many Difputes, fomany Exceptions, and fo many Expo- fitions put upon the Words Conformably and Reafimhly , that theymuft cet a Horfe back immediately. Boulaje (topp’d this fury for a while; So that after many Difputes and Confultations, it was agreed , that as chief of the Negotiation , and £d//», (hould follow the Court ; and that Rmlaye , Rreber, and Dupont, ihould proceed forward to the The Sieur L’Etloile, and all the reft of the Franks wereof opinion, that Ldtn (hould forthwith depart {ot France with the Rmg s Letter. But their Counfel was not follow’d, and fo the Deputies divided them- (elves * Ldin and Mar me to follow the Court, which was then remov d And the other three to purfue their Journey to riie Faft Indies The two former fain would have had Father ^ tne h ,. , tn f |, e (Pourt • but he fairly exeus d himlelf. have accompany d them to tne t-ourt, uui. ^ r NeitherNeither would L’Eftoile permit his Son 5 to whom he allow'd 20 Tomms a Year , to return to the Court, choofing rather to fend him to Bander with the other three. Whereupon, the Seventeenth of November^ they fet forward upon their Journey. DuPont, without doubt, was the moft folid and judicious of all the Merchants, but he took it fo to heart, to fee the dif-union among them, that he fell into a languifhing Difeafe at Ifpahan , and dy’d not far from S chi rat. As for Lalin and Manage , they left Ispahan the Fifteenth of Decern- her, and arriv’d at Court foon after, where they lay a long time neg- le&amp;ed , their Divifions ftill continuing, which made them contempti ble to the Perfians , and ruin'd the Affairs of the Company. One Evening, the Nazar fent them a Flow’r, advifing them, that as that Elow’r never chang’d 5 fo it became them not to vary in their Refolutions. After a long and tedious ftay , Manage obtain’d fome few impertinent Alterations in his Patent 5 and permiflion to make Wine at Sclnrus, as the Engliflj , Hollanders , and Portuguefes had. With thefe Alterations they both leave the Court 5 and Manage would certainly have accompany’d Lalin , who had an intention to lee Araevil ^ Tauris, and Kom , had he not been folicited to return to Zal pha, by a Young D alii ah , that had fmittenhis heart. For by the means of anold Woman, the Mother of one of his Lacqueys, he had de bauch’d a young Armenian Virgin, whom he kept privately to himfelf; yet not fo privately , butthenoife thereof was quickly fpread all over Zidpha. Alhhe Armenians were fcandaliz’d at it, and lent to feize the Baud, to punilhher, by their Laws, as fhe deferv’d. Mariage adver tiz’d thereof, flew out of his Lodging to her affiftance, and to prote&lt;5l her from Juft ice. But feeing the People in an uproar, and finding the Stones to flye too thick about his Ears, he was forc’d to mind his own fafety, and to feekfor fhelter in the next Houle where he could be ad mitted. But the Bufinefs was not fo put up, for the Armenians , won- dring to fee that a Deputy of an Illuftrious Company, who was come to the Court of Perfia upon fo ferious an Affair, fhould do fo much wrong to his Nation, by publickly appearing info fhameful an A&amp;ion, and fo unworthy of a Perfon in public Employment, that they refolv’d to profe- cute him all manner of ways. They were refolv’d, to that end, to have fent into Prance zx\ Exprefs , to have Complain d to the King of his ill Management and bad Behaviour. But Manage at length reffor’d the ^Armenian Girl which he had kept clofe lock'd up 5 after which time the AmeniAtos look’d upon him but with fcorn and contempt. Lalin being return’d to Ijpahan , departed thence the 22th of Novem- her, 1666. for Bander , with a Refolution, to Travel into the Indies. But he fell lick at Bander , and thinking to return to Schiras , for the Air’s fake, he dy’d by the way at a Village call’d Bend-Ali. A Gen tleman endow d with noble Qualities, and whole Gentile and Generous behaviour was an honour to his Nation. The Thirtieth of the fame 3 Manage alfo left ijpahan, and departed for Bander, with one Father Mercier, a jefuite, whom he took along with him as his Almoner, and Lems V Eftoile , his Kalmaehi, or Interpreter: There he flay’d four Months for the arrival of the Ships, ^ noneGo rahig, and the heats encreafing, he refolv’d to fpend the reft of the Year at Schiras, As for the jej'uit, and young V Efimle, becaufe[JBr Negotiation of the Deputies , &amp;c. 37 becaufe there was no Converfebut with the people of the Country 5 they returned back to Jfpahan. Ron Lye and Reber arriv’d at Suratte the firft of April, 1666. Being come to the Bar , they fent to Father Ambrose , chief of the Million of the Capuchins , who prefently attended them w 7 ith a Sloop, which he had obtain’d of the Governour, and brought them home to the chins Houfe, w^here they flay’d till they departed for Agra. Some time before was arriv’d there a Merchant of Aleppo, who had run him- felf out at heels, and of a Maronite Chriftian was become a Roman Catholick, in hopes to patch up his broken Fortune, being in truth a meer Counterfeit, and a Hypocrite: For thefe Levantine Chriftians feldom change their Religion, but upon foitie motive of Intereft, and when they have got a good Sum together, they prefently whip back a^ain into their ow r n Country, and for a fmallpieceof Money obtain absolution of their Patriarch. Thus feveral of the Religious Franks that travel out of Europe into Afia are often deceiv’d, making a great nolle of their Converfion of k\\q, Levantines, when the Converlion,at the bottom, is only an outward Converfion , and a meer piece of Gul- lery. Among many others that I could relate, I will only mention of zBrancifcan, call’d who coming with 400 Crowns, one or thereabouts, in his Pocket, for his fubliftance, a Maronite (vcxqXx, him out, and under the pretence of giving him the Honour of his Conver fion to the Catholick Religion, never left him till he had fuck’d him dry, and turn’d the Channel of his Money. This Maronite WiwQhmt before mention’d, whofe Name was Chelebi, fhew’d himfelf very zealous for the Capuchins, and he had reafon enough ; for xhzCapuchins of Aleppo had been very ferviceable to him, and had help’d him in his Affairs when they were at the low r eft ebb. They were overjoy’d at his arrival at Surat, and gav'e it out immediately that it was he that had given them Money for the building their Houle and Church. But when I came to look over my Accompts, I found that the Money that had pay’d'for the Ground and a good Ilia re of the building, came put of my Purie 5 Father Ambroije having promis’d that I fhould be reimburs d upon my return to Paris. But 1 never heard more of my Money, nor indeed did lever look after it. The reafon why the Capuchins were willing that the Aleppo Merchant, who never had disburs’d a Peny, fhould own the Expences of their Houfe and Church, is this* becaufe no Frangui Chriftian is permitted in the indies to enjoy the propriety of Houfes, or to make any reparati ons of thofe which they hire, without the leave of the Governour of the Place. Both the Englifb and Holland Companies are only to the 'Indians * the Great Mogul having fuffer d from the Chriftians in feve ral places, where under pretence of repairing or adorning certain Houfes , which they poffdVd by way of propriety, they have fo well fortiffd them, that when the Governours have come to require any Duties from them, they have madp them good fo long, till they have forc’d the Governours to yield to their demands. ■ r } r a So foon as the Deputies were landed at they prefently fpread abroad a report, that there were feven or eight Ships belonging to the French Company that would fuddainly follow them.The Merchant was overjoy’d to hear the News, and was m g re f hopes , that by the favour of the Capuchins , and the advantage which he had of fpeakingfeveral of the Afiatick Languages, that thegreateft part of French Merchandize would pafs through his hands. Upon thefe hopes he made great Treats, and prefented large Prefents to the Deputies, and maintain’d their Servants at his own Charges. He found the De puties to be fufficiently covetous, but he was ftili in great expe&amp;ations, that his civil Entertainments, and the Prefents which they receiv’d from him, would oblige them to acknowledge his kindnefs, and that one day he Uiould find himfelf repay’d by the management of their bufi- nefs; but he was foully miftaken. For it coft him above 1500 Kupes, part which he fpent upon them himfelf at Surat, and partly what his Nephew furnifh’d them withall at Agra for their prefent occafions. Three or four days after their arrival at Surat,the Englijh Prefidentfent to vifit them by fome of his Council, and would have waited on them himfelf, but that he lay then ill of the Gout. The Holland Commander did the fame with his Council, {hewing all the civilities and kindneffes that lay in his power 5 and a few days after invited them folemnly to a great Feafi:, with as many as they could bring along with them. In the midftof their Jollity the King’s Health was fent about, and after that, the Profperity of the French Company 5 which oblig’d Boulaye to begin another Health to the happy Progrefs of the Holland Company. But when it came to Mr. Behers turn to drink it, notwithstanding all that Bodaye , and the reft of the Company could fay to him, they could not oblige him to pledge it. Nay, he did worfe then this, for he threw the Glafs, Wine, and all at his Feet-, and when he had fo done, he rofe in a heat from the Table, and after a pitiful manner left the Company, and went home to his Lodging, though without any attendance, if he Hollanders were fo difcreet as to take little notice of his folly , but remain’d very merry at the Table with Mr. Bodays till Midnight. But they could not forbear telling their Friends, that they wonder’d, in regard there were fo many difcreet and ingenious Men in France , that the Company fhould make choice of fuch a Fool for the management of fuch an important Affair as he was fent about 5 and that they forefaw he would do the Company no fmall injury. While the Deputies ftay’d at Surat , the Governourof the place, at the requeft of Father Ambroife , entertain’d them, and Ihew’d them all the refpeft that could be fhew’d to Strangers. One day that they were in Difcourfe together, he told them, that if they would follow his Counfel, he adviz’d them not to go to Court till their Ships were arriv’d. But feeing that they were refolv’d to the contrary , he offer’d them Money, Horfes, and Souldiers, to attend them , with Letters of Recommendation to fome of the Grandees of the Court. TheC^i- hander, or Provoft of Merchants, made them the fame offers that the Governour had done $ all which they refus’d very obftinately. More then this, they behav’d themfelves very ill, in reference to the Prefents which the Governour and the Cha-Bander fent them, for they gave their Servants that carry’d them not a Voight , which is look’d upon as a very dirty a&lt;ftion in the Indies. For the Indians never give their Ser vants any other Wages, then what they get by carrying Prefents from their Matters. And the more they have given them , the more Honour it is, both for him that receives, and him that fends the Prefent. The Deputies then being refolv’d for Agra , hir’d their Waynes, and their Oxen to carry their Luggage, and five and twenty Souldiers for their1^ Negotiation of the Deputies, &amp;c. 93 their Convoy. They likewife made a great noife, of their being honour’d from fo Great a King, and fo Noble a Company. Upon which fcore, they ought to have had five or fix Wains for their Baggage, every one their Pallaqmn and a Led-horfe, and every one a Flag with their Arms or their Cyphers, which is the gentile way of Travelling in India , and as I was always wont to travel. But they took but five and twenty Souldiers, whereas they ought to have hir’d an hundred and fifty at the rate they talk’d. But inftead of fo doing, threeDays Journey frombegan to quarrel with BouUye , that they had too great a Train at their heels, for which he blam’d the Advife of Father and the Merchant of ^Aleppo: That for his part lie would pay for no more than four Souldiers, and that it he would not fend the reft back, he thould pay them himlelf. Upon which &gt; they agreed to fend back the fix Souldiers which the Governour had order’d to attend them as far as Brampour; upon their difmiflment, not giving them fo much as the Worth of a Pipe ot Tobacco. When they came to (-Agra, the Nephew of Cbelebi, the (-Aleppo Merchant, fail’d not to wait upon them, and to offer them hislervice. There was at thattime a Frcficb Chirurgeon, whole Name was James, he fpake good Indian, and was married in the Country to the Daughter of a Portugal: The Nahab, the King’s Uncle and Grand Vizier , had a great kindnefs for this Chirurgeon 5 and by his procurement it was , that the Deputies had Audience of Giafer-Kan, for fo was the Nahao call’d. They requefted of him, that by his favour they might prefent a Letter from their King to the Great Mogul, as alfbthat they might be admitted to treat concerning the Settlement of aFnw^Trade in the Countrey. The Nahab told them, that he would fpeak to the King, and take care that they fliouldbe admitted to their Audience in a little time. With that he order’d them to be conduced to the Lodgings appointed for them, which they found ready furnifli’d with all necefiary provifion for the Belly 5 but their Lacqueys and Servants were to cook it themfelves ; for it is not here as it is in Persia , where the Meat is lent ready dreft out of the King’s Kitchin to the Embaffadors Table. The mbab ,who underftood that they had brought no Prefents, neither for him, nor any of the Grandees of the Court, nor for the Kinghimfelf, was not over hafty to admit them to their Audience. So that it was above a Month before the Deputies could fet Eyes upon the mhab again, though the Chirurgeon, arid other usd a their Intereft in their behalf. Being very weary of this Delay, they gave it out, that they could ftay no longer at ^, in regard they were to be at Surat upon the Arrival of the French^ Veffels. Upon which falfe Report, the Nakd fent to them for the png their Mafters Letter, that he might prefent it to the Great Mcgul himfelf. Upn this Demand of their Letter, they were quite Wank not bei 'S^ u ^^ with the manner how the Kings of /^ receive thofe Letters whtc are brought them by Embaffadors : For they never receive any with their own hands, but fuch as comeAm anc T Ptters -recording to the Grandeur of the Kings that fend them, are out into the hands of the Grand Officers of the Court, who pirefem them to the King: And the more potent thekmg is, from whom tire Letter comes, through the fewer hands it paffes before it is pfx ente Ii to the Great Mogul. For the prefent State of Europe and iMfu is very well known in the Court ot the Great Mogul&gt; and the Difference between the Soveraigns of both 5 in reference to their Grandeur and Puiffance. Neither is there a Stranger that enters into the Kingdom, of whom the Governour of the Frontier Province does not give advice to the Nahab ; and if he appear to be a perfon of Ingenuity, there’s no help for’t 5 but he muft go to Court, where he is earefs'd, on purpofe to get information of the Country from whence he comes. But to return to the Deputies, they obftinately refuf’d to fend the Letter to the Nahab: Atwhichhe was not a little troubl’d 5 fearing left upon the Arrival of the French Veffels, it might be the occafion of a Rupture, and hinder the conclufion of the Treaty of Commerce. Moreover he was not a little jealous, left they fhould feize upon the Great Mogul's Veffels in their Voyage to ^Mecca , as Hugh Lambert the Holland Pyrat did , who took all the Baggage belonging to the Queen of Hifapour, when fhe was going to Mecca and Medina. The Nahab having made thefe Reflexions to himfelf, fo wrought with the King, that he confented that the Deputies, contrary to cuftom, fhould be admitted into his prefence, there to give the Letter into the Hands of the Prime Minifter, to be by him prefented to the King. This, as I faid before, was an unufual favour 5 and yet the Deputies were fo obftinate, as to reje&lt;ft this Propofition , faying, that they would rather return home, and carry back their Letters , then not prefent them to the King themfelves. This obftinacy of theirs, to maintain their own conceited humour againft the Cuftom of the Countrey, was very much blam’d by all people , that admir’d at the patience of the Nahab, who at length fent them word , they might take their own courfe, fince they refuf’d the Honours which he would have done them. After that, the Deputies ftaid ten or twelve days in the City, flattering themfelves, that the Nahab would comply with their Folly 5 but they were deceiv’d. For the Nahab offended at their idle carriage, took fuch order, that not one perfon living , either Merchant or other, went to vifit them all the while. So that they refolv’d to return to Surat, in expe&amp;ation of their Ships. When they left^^, they went and lay two Leagues off from the City in the Field, fetting up one Tent apiece, (and thofe pitiful ones Heaven knows) to ferve for them and their Servants, whereas they might have lodg’d with more fecurity in a fair Inn that flood not far off. Now it is the Cuftom at the Great Moguls Court, that every Night fome Prince or great Lord keeps Guard in his turn for a Week together , having under him five or fix thoufand Horfe, that beat the Road for three or four Leagues round the place where the King quarters. A Party of thefe Horferaen fcouting by the Deputies Tents, and enquiring whofe they were, one of the Servants reply’d, that they were the Tents of the French Deputies: of which the Horfemen gave immediate notice to their Captain, at that time the Grand Provoft of the Empire. A Perfon handfom, well endow’d, and a great Lov^r of Strangers, who had raif’d himfelf by his Valour, as being mJbyjfin by Nation. So foon as he underftood that they were the French Deputies, he lent one of his principal Officers, with fifty Horfe, to defire them to give them leave to guard them that Night, becaufe they were in no fecurity, and for that if they came to any mifchief the Head of their CaptainNegotiation of the Deputies t &amp;c. Captain muft anfwer for it. But they very ill reeeiv d the kind proffer of the Provoft, proudly anfwering, that they were ftrong enough to guard themfelves, and the firft that came near them Ihould know whe thcr the French had Courage or no, adding withal, that if their Captain were afraid, they would guard him, with a deal of other fcumlous riftra hioh verv much lurprisd the Officers. ~ The next day they let up their Tents about a quarter of a League far ther becaufe they cxpedtcd fomething to be brought them from gr*. Jhtcontevd or Grand Provoft admiring they made fuch flow journeys, and that they had now pitch’d in a more dangerous place then before^ fent tlieV?me Horlemen with the fame proffer, or elle that they would be o ?s‘dTo lye in an Inn where they might be fafe. Bmlaye was of the mi d that fo kind an offer fhould not be refus’d: but Beber gave them nnhin^ but bad language, reviling their Captain, that he was afraid rvfidgoaWye with his wives, offenng if he pleas d to go and fruard them. § He (poke half Portuguefe, half Italian,whichbein 3 a k nd Franca, fomeof the Horiemen made a fluft to underftand h m, and having made a report to the Grand P-joft of his n dent Anfwei; the atnK Horfe came and cut In'the Cords oioebers Tent,thinking to have let it fall about his ears, ut he found a way to quit himfelf by the a Lfl friss, wL 1 . ^» j a h r eonfiaer, he tooK ms puuc „ „ rr^uf Tree But by the con* league off, where he nlthing to fay to him ; being fequence he found that the Ho . h j m p 0 r had they fatisfi’d when they fa w Be er a , have left him, till they had quite not thought him lb, might fan done his bufinefs.

As for TSeb , who lov'd good Cheat when it coft him nothing, as being a true exemplar of covetoufnefs, he com plain o of the Mutts entertainmentjthough they out-run the Conftable to treat him like a Deputy. His man who had more wit than he,and plainly faw what a trouble he was to has Hofts, made them a merry relation of the Noble Table which his Mafter kept for him, how he had made pro- vifionof a Barrel of Herrings; which when Invitations fail’d, hewa- rily fed upon, rubbing his bread with the tail togive ita For rnypart, faid the Boy, I am but a poor Servant, yet I have made afliift to fpend an hundred and fifty Crowns which I had got in the fervice of the Conlul of Smyrna. T was my misfortune to be inveigl’d out of his fervice, for I was with a Noble Mafter where I got Money • but in this man s let vice I have eaten all that I had got before. Two days after I arnv d at Agra^nd heard of Beber’s being wounded and where he lay and went to give him a vifit. And as I never went unprovided in my travels with all things neceffatly, I had fome Oyntments and Plafters , which were very fervweable to him. ‘ . Ic ^ a , n f a , fie . thin § obferve that Bodaye was glad of the opportu nity of Beber s being wounded, that he might have the foie honour of giving the Letter to the King. For he pretended to be the true Envoy nanv t ^ , tha - Beher was onl y fent » bear him com- pany. La BohUjc therefore believing that the bufinefs vVould take efFeft perluaded the Chyrurgton already mention'd to folicit the Ndnb who’ had akindnefsforhim, foclofej that thereby the Nahab permitted him to bring the Letter. Bu t BouUye who thought he fhould gi ve i t himfelf to the King, was much mrpnz’d when he faw that the Nahab. who had g, ot , the Later into his own power,gave it to one of themeaneft Officers of his Court, who by the Prime Minifter’s order, gave it to another and he to a third, who brought it back to the Nahab, who at length pre- j lt f° ^but in the prefence of BouUye. And thus you fee the Effedof the ridiculous pride of the Deputies BonUye was forc’d to flay m an outer Court, having two more to paf thorough before he came into the King’s Quarter. Where,while he re main d big with expectation , word was brought him, that the King would return an Anftverto the King his Mafter, fo foon as the Ships fhould be arm d ; and lo he was forc’d to go back to his Lodging with he melancholy diffatisfadion of afruftratehope. r a w , ounded G ent!ernan being new cur’d, but ftill very lame d°- 1 , 1 ' d f A udle , ncc ^ the WaW, that he might have juftice for the’mff- admitfcffih b r a ' Affilffi , natl ° n and a Robbery.

But the Nahal? either laugh’d at him or took little notice of what he faid. For indeed by Bebers outward appearance, and deportment, no man could make any other judgment of him, but that he was a poor fpirited fellow, and one that knew not what it was to live. For all the Europeans that travel into Perfia and the Indies are always richly habited , nor would any of them keep Be her company, who by his Habit look’d rather like a Footman, than a Depu ty of a Royal Company of Trade. At length a whim took him to makehimfelf a fuit of painted Calicut, after the Fm^Fafbion, the like whereof had never been feen in the Country. the whole Suit not Handing him in above 13 Livresznd 13 Sous. For the trimming of his new Suit he took off the Ribbands of his old Cloaths, which he was two days lathering, and fmoothing with a Taylers Goofe. When he had got this rare Habit upon his back, he went to vifit theiV*^ who was then attended by the Principal Lords of the Court. Who when they faw him enter, fell all a gazing upon him, and ask’d one another whe ther that Frangui were turn’d Faquir , or a Dervich of Hoffen Mamout which they ufually call the ragged Saint. For you muft know, that all the Faquirs or Derviches that are of this Order, never apparel themfelves but with fuchrags as they pick up in theftreets, and if they meet with any pieces better than other , they make of them a kind of Galoon to trim the reft. They alio carry half Pikes, with a great company of Tatters faften’d to the end of them, to make a ihew of their beggery. Be- ^/s Habit very much furpriz’d the Nahab y and all others that beheld him fo ridiculoufly accoutei’d. As he pafs’d one morning by my win dow, I bid him good morrow, telling him withal, that he look’d more fpruce and gay than he usd to do. He reply’d , that he had reafon fo to do, for that he had receivd Letters from Surat, by which he had advice, that the Country people upon the Coaft of Gape St. John had decry’d four Veffels out atSca, which they could not make to be either or Hollanders, from whence he concluded that they were the Companies (hips 5 and that he was going to the Nahab with the News. But I pre vented him at that time,telling him that I had often obferv’d that rafcally fort of people to come both to the Englijh and Hollanders,with fuch kind of Intelligence, onpurpofe to get Money-, when indeed they had never feen any fuch fight, and admonilhing him not to believe Reports upon fuch flight foundations. I ask’d him what date his Letters bore? he told me, thirty days ago. Then, hid I, if the difeovery had bin true, the Nahab would have had notice of it in fourteen 5 and then he would certainly have told you of it,or my felf 5 for it is but two days fincel took my leave of him. Thereupon he took my counfel and refolv’d for Surat in a few days. Three days after that the Chirurgeon had given in his Bill for the Cheft of Medicaments that he had loft among Beber’s Baggage, he was fo touch’d in Confcience, that he fell fick, and dy’d in two days. Upon his death-bed he ask’d pardon of God for the Cheat which he had con- fen ted to, to ask 4000 Roupies for that which was really worth but four hundred 5 200 of which he had receiv’d from the Charity of thef^- guis, the reft upon the fale of a Horfe. For my part, finding that Beber was refolv’d for Surat y I made what haft I could out of Agra , to be quit of his company. But the fecond day'Negotiation of the Deputies, &amp;c. day after my departure, having fet up my tent by a Rivers fide, juft as' I was going to dinner I fpy’d Beber coming, not could I get rid of him afterwards till I came to Surat. So that we were forc’d to travel toge ther 5 though he committed a thoufand Impertinencies by the way. Among the reft , he put one trick upon the Chief of the Cherajfs or Bankers at Bramfour, not to be palled over in filence. In regard the ways were bad &gt; and that he had but one pitiful weak Chariot 5 and four weak Boys, which with the help of Oxen, were hardly ftrong enough to help him out when he ftiick in the mire , he fel- dom came to his journeys end till two or three hours after me.Now upon the report that ran of the French Ihips being feen out at Sea , and the general belief that Beber would be one of the Principal Truftees of the Company, feveral, as I faid before &gt; courted him, and fought to engage his Friendship. Being arriv’d at Br am four , the Chief of the Cher off's ^ attended by a dozen of his fervants came to vilit us. Upon the firft acquaintance^^ told him that he wanted a Fallaqui'ti to go to Su- rat, whereupon the Chera.ff civ\Wy offered him his, and caus’d it to be trimm’d up for his better accommodation. Beber thought that trimming would have bin finilht in one day, when indeed it requir’d three or four. The next day I order’d my Coach to be got ready, and order’d my PaU Uquin to be carri’d away. Beber^ who verily believ’d that the Compa ny's {hips were already in the Road of Surat , began to curfe arid banri the Cheraff, who prefently came to him and endeavour’d to appeafe hirri with good words. He told him, it could be no prejudice to him to ftay a day or two * for by that time the Roads would be better, and he might travel the fafter. But Beber , being tranfported with pafliori , Was fo far from taking the cheraffs reafons for fatisfa&amp;iori, that fnatching a Cudgel out of his Waggoners hands that ftood next to him, he gave the C three or four good Licks crofs the Ihoulders. The Merchants and other people that were in the Inn, wereftrangely furpriz’d atfucha piece of rudenefs, and ran out prelently , fome with Stones, and others with Cudgels, making a hideous noife, and crying out, that they had never feen the like. They took it for a moft enormous Crime, toftrike the Chief of the cheraffs , above fourfcore years old , whofe very age ought to have bin protection enough from fuch an Affront. Good luck it was for Beber, after fuch aralh aCtion committed , that I was well known at Brampour, having been there ten or twelve times, and in fome of my Travels having dealt for above 200000 Roupies. There were none of the cheraffs with whom I had not dealt by Letters of Exchange, and very few Merchants or Brokers who had not had fome bufinefs ot other upon my accompt. They cry’d out, fpeaking of me 5 See there the Monfieur Franqui , with whom we have dealt fo often , yet never heard him give us an ill word. Another good chance he had to meet there the Cout ev all's Lieutenant, and three Merchants of Surat • and thus be tween us, having diiingag’d Beber out of the Brabble wherein he had fofillily bemir’dhimfeft, we made him get into my Coach, andfopackt him out of the City. I follow’d him two hours after : for had he ftaid longer in Brawpour ^ I believe the Faquirs and Derviches would have beat outhis brains. For he was no fooner gone, but a great number of that fort of rabble came to the Inn, crying out, Where was that Dog of i. Cafer that had beaten the Cheraff. Thereupon , feeing the Multitude encreafe, I ftoleoutof the Town, without faying a word, and rid onThe Persian ‘travels fall but by the way.

There are Caravans which confift of Cmt lS which are the moft ufual *, in regard that Camels are cheap, and for that fome Catnds will carry as much as three Horfes, others as much as four or five. But arnono the Caravans of Camels, there are feveral Horfes and Mules, which the Merchants themfelves ride upon } it being very tedious to ride upon a Camel when he only goes a foot-pace, but very pleafant when he goes upon his large trot. There are other Caravans that confift: only of Horfes •, and among thefe, if the Merchant have none of his own, he may hire one. The Servants ride upon thofe Horfes that are lead laden-, but at you may meet with feveral good Horfes very cheap, f ro[n thirty to fixty Crowns. As for thofe perfons that are either unwilling or unable to be at any expence, they make ufe of Afles, of which there are enow to be had. Above all things, youmuft take care to provide Pack-Horfcs to carry your Wine.! for the Camel-Mafters being Mahometans^ will not permit you to lade their Camds with any fuch Liquor } that Beaft being particularly confecrated to Mahomet, who fo ftri&amp;ly forbad the fife of Wine. You put your Wine in Bottles made of wild Goats Skins, with the hairy fide turn’d innermoft, afid well pitch’d within. There are fome of thefe Bottles from which they take off the Hair-, but they are notfo good, as being feldom without holes. Thefe Camel-Mafters are an infolent fort of people, which you fiiai! never know how to deal with, unlefs you can bring them to punilhment. There was one that play’d me fome of his jades tricks in the Road from Smyrna to Tauris ; but when] came to Efcrivan, I complain’d to the Kan,who prefentiy caus’d a hundred Baftinado’s to be giv’n him upon the fpot. Nor is there any other way to bring thofe ScQundrels to reafon,efpccially at and fuch other places, where the Merchants have their Confuhi who upon the leaft complaint to iheCady have Jufticc done them imme- diately. The examples of fome of thefe Camel-drivers that have been paid off, keep the reft in good decorum } and they will be very tractable for a good while after. The Journies of the Caravans are not equal \ fometimes not above fix hours travel, fometimes' ten, and fometimes twelve \ it being the convenience of Water, which is not every where to be met with, that is the Rule of Lodging the C arm tv.. At all times the travels more by night than by dayin Summer to avoid the heat, and at other times, that you may be fure to have day enough to fet up your Tents. For if the Caravan fhould come to pitch in the night, it would be impofiible for them to find where to fet up their Tents, to drefs and look after their Beafts, make ready their Kitchins, and provide things neceflary for fo large a Company. True it is, that in the depth of Winter and in the great Snows, they feldom fet out till two or three hours after midnight; and that fometimes theyftay till day-break. But in Summer, according to the Journey which they intend, they fet out either at midnight, or an hour after Sun-fet. The laft time I went from Smyrna the Caram confifted of fix hundred Camels, and almoft the fame number of Horfe. Sometimes their number is greater, fo that the Camels going but by one and one after another, aCaravanfeems tobe an Army, and whether it be in travelling or lodging, they take up a world of Ground. Now by reafon they travel all night in Afia, it happens that the Air is indifferent wholfom; and that the Travellers, that lye for the mod part upon a Carpet fpread upon the Ground, find themfelves very little inconve nienc’d by it. ' The Camels that go into Ferjia through the Northern Provinces of Turkih travel like Horfes in a Cart, by feven and feven *, they are ty’d together by aCoi‘4 about the bignefs of a Man’s little Finger, and a Fathom long faften’d to the Pack- faddleof the Camel that goes before, and to the Head-harnefs of the Camel that follows. Thofe little Cords are made no ftronger, to the end that if the Camel before (hould chance to fall into any hole, the Camel behind fhould either keep him up, or elfe not be' pull’d in after the other. And to the end that the Camel-driver who leads the foremoft, may know whether the other fix follow him or no, the laft Camel has a Bell about his Neck, which if it ceafe to ring, ’tis a fign thatNegotiation of the Deputies 5 &amp;a «•«'’ - * ' ' 11 I. ■ M.—■I.I.-I .. .. , ,, great River that flows from the Mountains of the South , which wafh- ing the City of Btroche^ from whence it takes its Name 3 falls into the Bay of Cambay. When we came to our lafl: Rage, which is a great Town, call’d noli, from whence it is but 14 Leagues to Surat, ^^rfentoneof his Hirelings to give notice thereof to Father Ambrose. When the News came, the Father went with the Merchant, often already men tion’d, to borrow the Englijh Prefident’s Coaches: and there were about 15 or 16 more Coaches all in a train, with feveral Horfemen and Mer chant Banians that made haft to meet the Deputy, This happen’d upon the firft of November, 1666. They earn’d with them Provifion enough to make merry , and every Banian had his Prefent ready. For my part, I as foon as I had faluted the Father Capuchin, I went dire&amp;ly to my Lodging, where I had left two Servants to take care of a Sum of Money which I had receiv’d of the King of Perfia, unwilling to hazard it upon the Road. For in whatever part of the Indies I came , I had credit enough to buy without Money. I only gave my Bills for payment at Jlgra, rtfapour, Golconda, ox Surat, where I generally left my Money, as having receiv’d it there for the moft part of the Lords or Kings of the Country. As for Beber , he was no Changeling , the follies that he committed are too numerous to be related: but how he began the year 1 66j r) is not to be omitted. . ’ , M. Thevenet, upon his return from Madrafpatan and Golconda , lodg’d in the Capuchins houfe. Beber going to vifit him , told him, that the Capuchins were the Hollanders Spies, and that he had often ad vis d Father Ambrofr to break with them, and not to go anymore to their Houfe. That while he frequented their Society, tho French Company would be fure to find fome obftacle in their Trade when the Ships ihould afrive • and that if the Hollanders had not been at Hgra, they might have done what they pleas’d with the King. That the hundred thoufand Roupies which they had prefented to the King and Grandees of the Court, had hinder’d them from obtaining what they defign’d. By which it appear’d, he underftood not the humour of the, Hollanders h for they are not fo liberal: nor would all their tricks , or prefents have any thing avail’d them, the Great Mogul being defirous that all Nations fliould be welcome to his Dominions, efpecially Merchants, as well they that import little , as they that bring in much. M. Thevenot^ told him , that he had never obferv’d fo much of the Hollanders in all his travels * for if it were true, that they had fuch a defire to hinder the Trade of other Nations, they would not afford them paffage in their Ships, or to put their Goods aboard, as they often did. Moreover, they fend away many times one or t wo Ships according to the quantity , laden ail with Aran- sers Goods, from Aft ox SuxAt , in which Ships , there is not oft times fo much as one Bale belonging to the Company. And this, added he, is farther obfervable, That they afford their Freight cheaper then tho Ewlijh, or any other Nation, who have Ships in thele parts. Thus Monfieur Thevenot endeavour’d to convince M. Beber 5 who would have had Father Ambrofe have fallen out with the Hollanders But he knew better things then to difoblige perfbns to whom he was .o much beho ing as he was every day. For every week they allowed the horde a certain quantity of Bread and Meat, and upon Faft-days .ent them Fdh,Eggs, Brandy, and Wine, which were no fuch unkindneffes to be quarrelFd with. Monfieur Thevenot at the fame time told Beber , that he ihould do well to repay Father Ambrose the Money which he had borrow’d to pay for the Coach which he had broken to ferve him, as alfo that which he had given the Seamen, for trying if they could difcover the Companies Velfels upon the Coaft. But he turn’d his deaf ear to that difcourfe, and would never be perfuaded to reimburfe the Money which Father Ambrofe laid out for him. Monfieur Thevenot perceiving his unwillingnefs, and preffing him to do things handfomly, put him into fuch a chafe, that he fell a fwearing after fuch a violent rate, in a Parlour, that was parted only by a thin board from the place where the Mafs was faid, that one of the Fryers, juft ready to go to the Altar, came forth to defire him to leave his blafpheming. But Beber s infolence took his admonition fo ill, that he-very rudely beat the Fryer in Mr. The- venoTs prefence 5 fwearing, That had it not been out of refped: to him, he would have knockt him q 5 the head. The Capuchin being fo inju- riouflyus’d, came to Me, being hardly able to ftir his neck, byrealbn of one of the blows that had given him. I chaft his neck with Oyl of Coco’s, and wrapt it up warm : but we durfl: not fpeak a word of Beber s idle a&amp;ion , for fear of expofing our felves to the laughter of the English and Hollanders , who would have made good fport with it. Befides thefe Enormities, he put away his Servant that had fav’d his Life, and kept his Wages. After that he went to lye at an Apothe caries houfe, whofe Name was Mouillon , who came from Goa , with a good quantity of Bortugal Wine 9 and kept a Tavern at Surat. While he lay there he had a great Cdnteft with the Merchant, who receiv’d the 240C0 Roupiesj which the King had given him for the lofs which he alleadg’d that he and his Chyrurgeon had fufhin’d. For the Merchant would acknowledge the receipt of no more then 23900 Roupies &gt; the other Hundred being deduded for Fees of the Treafury. He alfo main tain’d, That the Merchant had receiv’d the 12000 Roupies which the King had allow’d him for the lofs of his Blood : but it was known that the Grand Treafurer would never pay that Money. Thus when he faw that his Cheats were difcover’d to all the World, he began to bethink him- felf how to get away: and we obferv’d, that he would fain have quitted without noife. But there is fuch good Order taken both by Land and Sea, that no perfon can go away without the knowledge and leave of the Governour. For as the Countrymen that come from the other fide of the water cannot return unlefs they fhewa mark in their hands made with red Earth at the Cuftom-houle • neither Horfe nor Coach can ftir without a Note from the Chabander , and another for the Ra dars , who lye fometimes two or three Leagues from the Town. Beber neverthelefs had fome afturance from his Vintner, that he might get into a Boat, by bidding the Boatmen carry him to a large Town on the other fide of the water. The Mailer of the Boat ask’d him for his Ticket, but anfwer’d him with his Cudgel, forcing him for ward, and telling him, he was not to demand Billets of fuch a perfon as he was. Ashe was got half way the River a great number of Souldiers hollow'd after the Boatmen, to row the Strangers back afiioar. But Xeber laid his hand upon his Sword , and compell’d the Boatmen to go forward. That evening, Beber being return’d, the poor Boatmen were apprehended , and baftinado’d till they were almoft maim’d. TheNegotiation of the Deputies , &amp;c. 49 people cri’d out, that it was the Frangui that ought to be fo fervid, and not the poor Watermen, who had done nothing but by conftraint. Thus did this Envoy behave himfelf both in Perfia and India, to the great hindrance of the French Nation. Now let us fee what became of both and after all their Extravagancies. The Sicur de U BouUye , according to the accompt given by the Hollan ders that were at Agra^ left the Town five or fix days after my departure. Knowing I went to Surat^ he had plaid his game lb well with me, that he got a HamperoftwelvelargebottlesofWinefor i$%Rou(ies^ though they coft me more , for which he gave me a Note of his hand , that I have {fill in my cuffody , to be paid at Surat , upon the arrival of the French Companies fhips. From thence he travell’d to Fatm , where he If aid nine or ten days, partly with the Englijh , partly with the HA#- ders : from whence he departed for Daca, the Refidence of the Governour of the Province. The Governour of the Province of Bengale was then the Great Mogul's Uncle, whofe name was , a potent Prince, who has always under his Command thirty or forty thoufand men. At Patna, Boulaye had a projed, that from thence he might eafily pafs into china, and to that purpofe he there embarqu’d with fomeiV^# Souldiers, who were going to lift themfelves under But after that, to this hour, it never could be certainly known what became of him: but by all probable conjedfures, it is verily believ d, that the Per ft an Souldiers murder’d him and his little Slave, in hopes of fome good booty. Ol the truth whereof, the Obfervation that follows was no fin ail evidence. About a quarter of a mile from Daca lies a Town, where live feveral mungrel Portugal Officers, belonging to the Gover nour of Bengale , as Canoneers and Carpenters, and fome of the fame Nation that ferve in the Cavalry of Cha-Ejl-Kan, There they have alfo a (mail Church very well built, where an Auftin Fryar officiates, to whom, about three months after 5 &lt;W^’sdeparture from Patna , a cer tain Perfian in the Habit of aSouldier, with two more companions , brought two large Books, the one in Folio , and the other in Quarto to fell. The Fryar, who was a mungrel alfo , underftood no ; but finding them not to be in. the Portugal Language, would have flopp’d the Books as ftoln from the Hollanders , had not the Souldier been too ftrong for him. Thefe Books were thought to have been Boulayefts * who, to my knowledge, had twoCheftsfull, well bound ^ in reading whereof lie fpent the greateft part of his time. His Avarice was his Ruine - for had he taken a Bark by himfelf, as I did when I went from Tatna /and had oblig’d the Watermen to give him good fecunty, he could have run no hazard. For my part I took one with four and twenty men- and every one, knowing I never fpar’d for coft, gave me excellent fecurlty. Thefe Barks are little Galliots,, which will undertake to carry you to your journey’s end, and name your own day. If you will lye a (hoar every evening, they will fet up your Tents-and itop at any Town or City to take in Provifions. I never made fo plealant a Voy age in my life, nor with left trouble. For in thefe Barks, there is a Room where the Sun cannot come in , where you may repole in the day time, and fit in the cool Air on that fide from whence the Breez comes. There is another place cover’d for your Kitchin ; and another htt e Garderobefor the private deeds of Nature. .By the way I kill d gieatftore of large Geefe, Cranes, and Crocodiles, which I gave the Water men , who were very glad of thern 5 for they fold them in the Towns as they row’d along. The people in thofe quarters are very good natur’d and officious. Dyet is little worth, as being the place where you may buy a hundred Pullets for a Crown: and for three or four Pence,you may buy a Filh of a prodigious length and bignefs. ■fo^/send was no lefs fad. For when the Companies Ships were arriv’d, M. who commanded them,and M. with an Armenian^ who had the management of the chidfeft part of the bufinefs, had been acquainted with what had pafs’d at Surat , between Beber and the Capuchins. Prefently Affedions and Interefts parted. Caron Rambos took Beber s part 5 the Armenian held for the Capuchins 5 which was at length the ruin oi Beber and Rambos, The Holland Commander going aboard to vilit the Sieur Caron , upon his return would not permit the Captain to ftir out of his Cabin • fo that Rambos and the Armenian took upon them to wait upon the Commander. Upon this Occafion the Armenian took upon him to precede Rambos, and briskly threw him- felf before the French -mm *, who being provok’d at the Affront, gave the Armenian a fwinging cuff o’ the Ear before all the company. To be fhort, the Sieur Rambos, and holding all together, the Ar menian found himfelf too weak to refill: : and in regard he had the Management of the Cafh, he was accus’d of Misbehaviour, and was condemn’d to be hang’d. But becaufe they could not execute the Sen tence which they had given at Surat, they fent him away to the Council Royal of the Ifland of Madagafcar, of which M. Mondevergue was chief 5 who was fofar from confirming the Sentence given at zurat , that he admitted the Armenian to juftifie himfelf 5 and finding that he was not only innocent, but that he might be very ufeful to the Company, he fent him back to Surat with mote power then he had before. This put Beber and Rambos into a fit of Defpair, to fee the perfon whom they thought to have ruin’d, now above them. Thereupon they found a way to get 12000 Roufies a piece for their Wages, which they pretended to be due from the Company : and with that and 24000 Roupies which Beber hzd of his own they Embarqu’d both together for Goa. Where, being arriv’d, Beber dy’d foon after: But as for Rambos, he return’d home again through ifpaban.ill 5 1 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE A D E OF THE EAST* INDIES. Hat Nation which lias a defign to fettle a Trade in the Bdft-Indies , muft be fure in the firft place, to poffefs themfelves of a convenient place in that Country, to catine their Ships, and (helter themfelves during the tempeftuous Seafons. This want of a good Haven is the reafon that the Enghflj have not made thofe advan tages which other wife they might have done 5 becaufe it is impolSble that any YefTel Ihould remain in thofe Seas without being carin’d, or elfe eaten by the worms. Therefore, becaufe it is a long wav from Europe to the Baft -Indies , it would be requifite to have a retreating place at the C^ cf good Hope, xo take in fredi Water and Provifions, whether going or coming; but efpeciallyin theirreturn, in regard that the Ships beingthenladen,can- not take in Water for any long time. , , ' ,^ 1 : , The Road of the Ifland of St. Helen's , where the Enghib have built a Fort, is a very commodious place : and if the Water be not lo good upon the North-fide, yet the Plain is an excellent fpot of Ground to low, with convenience of all things neceffary for human fupport. _ This advantage the English and Dutch have depriv’d all_ other Nations of, by their Forts upon the Cepe of good Hope, and St. Helen s. And there fore fome River’s mouth , near the Cape of good Hope, ought to be fought for, for the fame purpofe, which would be far more convenient then the Dauphin //land, where there is no Trade but that of buying Caetel for their Hides; which being a Trade of fo little conferee, would ruin a Company to follow it. _ ♦ t, „ The reafon why I make this Propofal is, becaufe that in the year 1648, two Portuoal VelTels being bound from Ltsbon to the Eajl-Indtes , and refolving to touch at the Cape, to take in frefh Water, m.ftook their juft Depths, fo that the Sea running high, they fell into a Bay, 180 Leagues from the Cape, upon the Coaft that looks to the Weft. In tha^5 2 Observations «po« i'*rj.i'rw ,. 1 ^liur g —'-»*»■ ■• '■—■* . ■. .i—■■■» m , ,, — , Bay they found a River, whofe Water was very good 5 and the Blacks of the Country brought them Refrefhmentsof all forts of Fowl, Filh, and Bullock's Befh. There they (laid above 15 days , and before they fet fail, they took two of the Negro s , which they carri'd along with them to £ 7 ^ ? to teach them the Language 5 on purpofetotry if they could difcover by them any knowledge of the Trade of the Country. The Dutch Commander at Surat defifd me 3 to inform my felf, when I went to Goa , what the Portugals had learnt from thofe two Negro j. But one St, Amand , a f rench Ingeneer , who was Supervifor of the Fortifications of Goa^ told me, That he could not make them learn one word of the Language • and that he could only guefs by their figns, that they had fome knowledge of ^Ambergreece and Elephants leeth. The Portugals however made no quehion but to meet with Gold, if they could find a way to trade higher up i’ the Country. The Revolutions of Portugal, and their Wars with Spain have hinder'd them from making any more particular difcovery of the Coalt. Which it were to be wiilfd the French would undertake, provided they gave no caufe of jealoufieto the Hollanders) of what they were going about. There is alfo a neceffityof pofiefTing, or at leaft having the liberty of fome place near to ride fafe in , and to wafh and tallow in , in cafe they Ihould be Raid by the Rain-Seafons. The reafon is, becaufe that during that ill feafon, at what time it is impoffible to keep the Seas, the jealous of his Fortrefs of Surat buffers no Foreign Veflel in the River, where neverthelefs, the Ships being unladen, may ride fecurely from the terrible Tempefts that laft for five Months. The only fecure place for the Companies Veffels would be the Tov/n of Dia y belonging to the Portngals, The advantage of the fituation is eonfiderable for feveral reafons. The circuit of the City contains almoft 400 Houfes, and might be capable to receive a greater number of people, where the Ships would find all conveniencies during their ftay.^ It is feated upon the Coafl of Guzerat) upon a point of theGulphof Cambaye, looking toward the South-eaft. The form of it is almoft round 5 and above half the Circle environ’d by the Sea. It is not commanded by any Hill; and the Por tugals have begun thofe Fortifications, which might be eafily finhh’d. It contains feveral Wells of very good Water, and a River which falls into the Sea near the City, whofe Water is better then that of Surat y or Souali) and the Harbouris very commodious for Shipping. The Vcrtugals , when they had firfl: fettl’d themlelves in the Indies , kept there a Fleet compos'd of Galleys , Brigantines, and other light Veffels, whereby they made themfeivesMafters, for a long time , of all the Trade of the Places we have treated of. So that no Ship could trade,without the Governour of Dias Pafsport,who made it in the Name of the Viceroy that liv'd at Goa. The Impofition, which the Ships paid, was fufftcient to maintain the Fleet and Garrifon, and to enrich the Go vernour befides;. When the Rain-Seafons are over, that the wind fits at North and Nqrth-eafl:, yon may fail from Dia to Surat m three or four Tides with light Veffels; but great Ships that are laden muff fetch a compafs about the Bank. The City has no Land belonging to it, but what it Rands upon, yet k would be no difficult thing to agree with the Raja , or Govervour of theTrade of the E a s t-I n d i e s. the Province, and to obtain as much as fliould be fufficient for the Inha bitants. Neither is the Land about it very Fertile, andbefides, the people are the poorefl: in the whole Empire of the Mogul. Neverthelefs the Country is fo well ftor’d with Cattel, that an Ox or a Bufalo will not coft above two Pidflers, '*^ ^t : ’'ktij&amp;r* The Bnglijh and Hollanders make ufe of thefe Cattel to feed their People, and to fparetheProvifions of their Ships, while they ftay at iiouali. But it is obfervable that the Bufatis flefli in thofe parts caufes frequent Dy fenteries, which the Bullocks Belli or Beef never does. The Raja that commands the Country has only the Title of Governour for life. Which is common to moft of the Rajas in the CMogul’s Em pire , whofe Anceftours were Lords of Provinces, where now their Defendants only enjoy the Titles of Governours. Having thus got polfedionof a good Poll 5 the next thing of Impor tance is to choofe out two men confiderable for their Honefty, Prudence, and Skill in Trade, who are to be allow’d the full of their Expences. Thefe two perfons are to ferve the Company, the one in the nature of a Prefident, with a Council, confifting of a certain number of perfons, toaffift him. The other in the quality of a Broaker, who muft be an Idolater of the Country, and not a Mahumctan^ in regard all the Work men he has to deal with are Idolaters. Civility and Faith of Promife are altogether requifit to gain Credit among Grangers. And thefe particular qualities are requir’d in the particular Broakers, who are under the Broaker-General in the Pro vinces where the Factories are fettl’d. Good Intelligence is neceffary for thefe two perfons, to underftand the alteration of Manufactures. This alteration happens either through the craft and fubtilty of the Workmen and the Merchants themfelves, or by the correfpondence of the Broakers and Workmen. » Which alteration may caufe fomuchdammageto the Company, that the Broakers (hall gain ten and twelve i’ the hundred by it. If the Prefident and Broaker-General combine with the particular Broakers and Merchants, it will be a difficult thing for the Company to avoid being deceiv’d • but if thefe two perfbns are but faithful and honefh, the fraud may be eafily remedi’d by changing the particular Breakers; The Officers of a Company may be unfaithful to their Truft in this refpeCl i When a Veffel arrives in Port, the Prefident for the Nation receives the Company’s Letters, and the Bills of Ladings upon which he calls his Council, fends for the Broaker, and gives him a Copy of thefaid The Broaker fbews them to three or four of the principal Merchants of the Country, who are wont to buy by whole fale, If the Prefident and the Broaker hold together for their own profit, the Broaker imtead of facilitating the fale as he ought to do , advifes the Merchants to be fhie, and to offer only fuch a price: Then the Prefident fends f°£ Broaker and thefe two or three Merchants 5 % and in the prelence 0 * ® Council he asks the Merchants what they will give for the Goods m the Bills of Lading mention’d If the Merchants are refdute to giveV Observations nfon the no more then fo much 5 The Prefident puts off the Tale 15 days longer, more or lefs, as he pretends himfelf prefs'd to fell. In the mean time he fends for the Merchants feveral times for a fliew, and at length, to avoid fufpicion, and to difcharge himfelf, he asks the advice of the Council, and as they approve, orders the delivery of the Goods to the Merchant. But though the Temptations be very great, to which thefe two Offi cers are fubjed:, byreafonof their pow'r, their frequent opportunities, and their diftance from their Superiours, the Company, befides their being wary in their Eledion , may remedy thefe diforders by depriving them of that pretence, which the Dutch Commanders and Breakers have, of being conftrain’d to fell off prefently to the Merchants in grofs, to avoid the expences of delay. The Errour which the Hollanders commit in this refped is, That their Officers befpeak every year upon Credit all the Goods which they have occafion for in the Empire of the Mogul, according to the Orders which they receive from Batavia, The credit of this Advance cofts them fometimes twelve , fometimes fifteen fer Cent ; lb that fo foon as their laden Veffels are arriv'd in the the Port where they are to be fold, they are oblig’d to fell them prefently off at the Merchants rate firft offer’d to their Broakers, to make up a prefent flock to pay off their credit for the Goods befpoke for their Ships to carry back again, and to get more credit for the next year. This is that which cherifhes that confederacy between the Prefident,the Broaker . and the Merchant, who makes advantage enough of this neceflity of felling. ^ . Whereas the better way were, for them that carry the fame Comnp- dities which the Hollanders do, to carry Money alfo to pay theWolk- men for the Goods befpoken for the next year. j The Company making this advantage ffiall not be put to pay that great Interefl of 12 and 15 fer Cent, : and befides, they ffiall have better Goods, and better cheap. The Ships loading ffiall be ready before they . arrive in Port • and being quick laden they may return before the bad Seafon. Neither ffiall the Company be put to fell their Goods at a loyi r price $ becaufe their Broakers will have time to flay for the coming of Merchants from other parts 5 or elfe becaufe they have time enough to fend them to other places, where they arefureof a quicker fale. Obferve alfo, That it is far more profitable to carry to the Indies Gold and Silver in Ingots, rather then ready coin’d 5 for being coin’d the Money is valu’d only according to their Alloys 5 and there is always a •defalcation made for the charge of Coinage. The Breaker alfo, if he be diffionefl, may combine with the Mailer of the Mogul's Mint, which is fettl’d in feveral parts of the Empire, and put a lower value upon the Gold and Silver then it deferves, by telling the Prefident and Council, that upon the touch it appears to be no more worth. But it is an eafie thing to avoid this deceit, provided the Prefident be a perfon of credit and prudence, by fending for one of the Refiners of Gold and Silver, that live in the Country, who perfe&lt; 511 y underfland the Touch of Metals, and to let him Effay the Gold and Silver before the Breaker’s face. This is that which the Sieur walkznton did for the Holland Company • ' ' injfr their Fa&amp;ory it'Cafik^aStr , where be bought every year fix or (even thoufand Bales of Silk. For by this Effay he found , that his Erbaker Icing in confederacy with the Mafter of the Mint, had cheated the Company of one and a half and two per Cent, in the value of the Gold and Silver which was brought him from jf^» 5 as well coin’d as in bairr, to a very confiderable fu'tti of Money. ^ t\ l Jxl F*— \ j •Kr-tA &gt;4 ^v» c ebuzen 0 co aife Weights or Scales unduly poisu. , ^ , 4 ... But thatfraud is eafdy avoided, if the Prefident and his Council Will be but to patient as to fee their Metal weigh’d themfelves, and take care thatthe Weights be right, and the Scales true. . ' , f One of the moft important Obfervationsin reference to the Tradeot the 'Company, and difeiplineof their Fadories is this : ;‘ n j [ o prevent the Nlerch3.nts cr under-Nlerclients 3 AccoiTipt&amp;lits snu r.'-der Accomptants, who officiate under the Commanders and Btoakers, rrom drivimr any particular Trade by themfelves, for they having a fontilkrlty with the men of Manufacture, and finding by the Letters Of Advice what Goods are likely to be moft vendible next year, buy them up noon their own accompts , and find a way to lade them off in the Com pany’s Veffels, to the great dammage of the whole, though to the great gain of particular people, _ . , f - And this the Prefident permits them to do , either for his own In- tereft, or by connivance under the pretence of their fmall Wages. The Captain of the Veffel alfo winks at what they do,. becaufe he has a Ipell for loading and unloading. And becaufe thefe people having no great Stocks, are defirous to put off their Goods with the firft opportunities, they give order to their Correfpondents to under-fell the Company ten or twelve in the Hundred, which is the abfolute ruin of a Trade. . To remedy this diforder there ought to be a Fifcal, or King s Procftor, in every of the chief Factories belonging to the Company, toad in the K H^i^tTbe independent foom^the Prefident and the Breaker, in the Exercife of his Office-, fo that he may have an eye, as well upon their behaviour, as upon the demeanour of the under Officers.

Of the C dicuts: am first of the painted Calicut call'd Chites. C Hites or Painted Calicuts, which they call Calmendar^ that is to fay, done with a Pencil, are made in the Kingdom of Golconda ; and particularly about Majlipatan. But there is made fo little , that though a man fhould employ ail the Workmen that underfland the Art of weaving Calicuts, he would hardly find enough to make three Bales. The Chites which are made in the Empire of the Great Mogul are all printed 5 and nothing fo beautiful, neither for the figures nor the fine* nefsof the Linnen. Thofe which are made at are the coarfeft, and confequently the cheapefl of all.. They are fold by Gorges , every Gorge confifting of twenty pieces, which coll from 16 to 30 Roupies. The which are made at are fold from 20 to 50 Roupies the Corge^ or thereabouts. Thele Chites ferve for Coverlets for Beds, for Sofra’s or Table*cloaths after the Country-fafhion, .Pillowbears, Handkerchiefs, but more efpe- dally for Wafkoats as well for the men as women in Perfia. The fine Cdicm- chites are made at Brampour ; and are us’d for Hand kerchiefs by thofe that fnuff Tobacco. The women alfo, over all make Veils of thefe Calicuts, to wear over their heads, and about their fhouiders, which Veils are call’d Ormis. The Bajia s or Calicuts painted red,blue,and black, are earn’d white to dgra , and Amadahat ^ in regard thofe Cities are neareft to the places where the/W^ds made that is us’d in colouring. They coft from two Roupies to 30 or 40 a-piece, according to the finenefs and the quantity of Gold at the ends, and fometimes upon the fides. The Indians have a way to dip fome of thefe Calicuts in a certain water that makes them look like Water’d-Chamlets, which adds alfo to the price.

Indigo. T Ndigo comes from feveral parts of the Great A/^«/s Empire, and 1 according to the diverfity of the places it differs in quality, and con ^nth^firTplace, it comes from the Territories of Buna, indma , and f rUv nr rwo’s iournev from Agra: which is efteem d the beft of all.

The ufual price is from 3 6 to 40 Roupies. There grows alfo Indigo foine 36 leagues from Br am four , about a great Village call’d Knout , and round about the neighbouring Towns in the road to Sunt: Of which the Natives ufuallymake above a hunder’d- thoufand Roupies. There comes Indigo alfo from Bengda , which the /MW-Company tranfports for Mafipatw. But they buy this and that of Brampour and Amaddnt, cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, then that of Agra. Indigo is made of an Herb which they low every year after the rains are over : which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it three times a year; firft when it is about two or three foot high. and they cut it within half a foot of the ground ; the firft cutting far exceeds the two latter. . The fecond cutting is worfe then the firft by ten or twelve in thehunder’d. And the third worfe then the fecond by 12 in the hunder’d. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Pafte, and obferving the colour. The colour of that Indigo which is made of the firft cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others: and that which is made ofthe fecond is more lively then the third. When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they make with Lime, which becomes fo hard, that you would jud^ it to be one inure piece of Marble. They are generally fourfcore or a hunder’d paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quire up with the Herb. Then they bruile and jumble it in the water till the leaf, tor the ftalkis worth nothing, becomes like a kind of thick mud. This ~” ln § done, they let it fettle for fomedays 5 and when the letling is all at the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When the water is al drain’d out, they fill feveral baskets with this llime, and in a plain Field you lhall fee feveral men at work, every one at his own basket, making up little pieces of Indigo flat at the bottom, at the top jharp like an egg. Though at Amndabat they make their pieces quite flat like a (mall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Mer chants, becaufe they would not pay cuftom for an unneceffary weight, before they tranfport their Indigo out of Afu into Europe, are very careful to caufe it to be fifted, to feparate the duft from it; which they fell afterwards to the Nativ :s of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They that lift this Indigo muft be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath before their aces, and that their noftrils be well-ftopt, leaving only two little holes tor their eyes. Befides, they muftevery half hour be fure to drink milk, which is a great prelervative againft the piercing quality of theduft. Yet notwithftandmg alt this caution , they that have fifted Indigo for nine or ten days, fhall fpit nothing but blew fora good while toge ther. Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the fifters, and when I came to break it in the evening it was all blew within. ^ As they take the Pafte out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes, they lay them in the Sun to dry. W idh is the teafon that when the Merchants buy Indigo, they burn ionic pieces of it, to try whether there be any duft among it. For the atives wbtvtakc the Pafte out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps, !t y, ^ lnt L ieSa , ’ whlt h mixes with the Pafte, and fouls it. Butwhen the Merchants burn it, the indigo turns to Afhes, and the Sand remains. • ovettoours do what they can to make the Natives leave their Knavery;‘Dominions of the Great Mogul, &amp;c. 61 Knavery 5 but notwithftanding all their care, there will be fome deceit. * Sdt-Peter, \ G Reat ftore of Salt-Peter comes from Agra, and Patna • but the refin’d cofts three times more then that which is not. The Hollanders have fet up a Ware-Houfe fourteen Leagues above Vatna^ and when their Salt-Peter is refin’d , they tranfport it by water by Ogueli. A Mein of refin’d Salt-Peter is worth feven Mamoudi’s. . Spice. C Ardamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves and Cinnamon, are all the different forts of Spices known to u$; I put Cardamom and Ginger in the firfl: place, becaufe that Cardamom grows in the Territories of Fifapour, and Ginger in the Dominions of the Great Mogul. And as for other Spices, they are brought from other Foreign parts to Surat } which is the grand Mart. Cardamom is the moft excellent of all other Spices, but it is very fcarce 5 and in regard there is no great ftore in the place where it grows, it is only made ufe of in dfia , at the Tables of great Princes. Five hundred pound of Cardamoms, are pric d from a hundred to a hundred and ten Rials. ^ # . ‘ Ginger is brought in great quantities from Amadabat ^ where there grows more than in any other part of Afta ; and it is hardly to be imagin d how much there is tranfported candited into Foreign parts. Pepper is of two forts. There is a fort which is very fmall, another fort much bigger 5 both which forts are diftinguilh’d into ftnall and great Pepper. The larger fort comes from the Coaft of Malavare ; and corin and Calicut are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of P r ifafour, being vended at Re jap our, a little City in that Kingdom. ^ The that purchafe it of the Malavares^do not give Money for it,but feveral forts of Commo dities in Exchange 5 as Gotten, Opium? Vermilion, and Quickfilver5 and this is the Pepper which is brought into Europe. As for the little Pepper that comes from Bantam^ Afchen^ and fome other parts toward the Eatt, there is none of it carried out of Afia^ where it is fpent in vaft quantities, efpecially among the Mahumetans. For there are double theGrains^ot fmall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper 5 befides that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth. c The little Pepper that comes to Surat^ has been fold (ome years of thirteen or fourteen Mamoudi’s the Mein • and fomuch I have feen the Englilh give for it, to tranfport it to Ormm ^ 54//^, andtheReaSeav As for the great Pepper, which the Hollanders fetch from the Coaft or Malavare, five hundred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty- eight Reals 5 but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they pzinCent, percent. , t. The Nutmeg, theNutmeg-Flow’r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, only Spices which the Hollanders have in their own hands. The three firlt come from the Molucca Iflands y the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from the ffland of CeyUn. s -j-* s62 The CJommodities of the ’Tis obfervable of theNutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never planted, which has been confirm’d to me by feveral perfons that have liv’d feverai years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nut meg being ripe, feveral Birds come from the Iflands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be digefted. The Nutmeg then befmear’d with a vifcous matter, falling to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one oblervation upon the Birds of Paradife. Thefe Birds being very greedy after Nut megs, come in flights to gorge themfelves with the pleafmg Spice, at the feaion, like Felfares in Vintage time • but the ftrength of theNutmeg fo intoxicates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, wherethe Emets in a fliort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds of Paradife are faid to have no Feet* which is not true however , for I have feen three or four that had Feet 5 and a 'French Merchant fent one from Aleppo as a Prefent to Lewis the Thirteenth that had Feet j of which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl. But notwithlfanding all the Hollanders Pfoje&amp;s, you may buy Cloves at Macaffar without purchafing them of the Hollander ; in regard the Iflan- ders buy them of the Captains and Soldiers, which the Hollanders have in thofe places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange Rice, and other neceflaries for the fupport of life, without which they would ftarve, being very fadly provided for. When the Natives of Macaffar are thus furnifli’d of Cloves,they barter them in Exchange for fuch Commodities as are brought them 5 fome- times they give Tortoife-Shells in exchange, and Gold Duft 5 by which the Merchant gains fixorfevenin the hundred, being better than the Money of the Ifland, though it be Gold , by reafon the King oft- times enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are Amhoyna, ElliasySeram, and Bouro. The Iflands of alfo, in number fix, viz.Nero^ Lontour^ Foulcay, Rofeguin^ndGrenapuis, bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The Ifland of Qrenapuis is about fix Leagues in compals ^ and ends in a fharp point, where there is a continual fire burning outot the earth. The Ifland Damme 9 where there grows great ftore of Nutmegs, and very big, was difcovePd in the year 1647, h^Abel Tafman 9 a Dutch Commander. The Price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them fold to the Hollanders at &amp;urat, was as follows. The Mein of Surat contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of our Pounds, at fixteen Ounces to the Pound. A Mein of Cloves was fold for a hundred and three Mamoudi’s and a half. A Mein of Mace was fold for a hundred and fifty-(even Mamoudi’s and t tr' J a hair. Nutmegs for fifty-fix Mamoudi’s and a half. &gt; Cinnamon comes at prefent from the Ifland of Ceylan. The Tree that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They never take offbut the firfl: and fecond, which is accounted the beft. They nevermeddle with the third, for fliould the Knife enter that, the Tree would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon , which they learn from their youth. The Cinnamon Spice is much dearer to the Hollanders then people think j for the King of CeyUn^ other wife call’dDominions of the Great Mogul, &amp;c. Kin^of Candy , from the name of his principal City , being a fworn Enemy to the Hollanders^ fends his Forces with an intention to furprize them , when they gather their Cinnamon* fo that they are forc’d to bring feven or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten* This the Vortngals were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of the Branches, and boil’d it till the Water was all confum’d. When it was cold, the upper part became, a Pafte like white W ax * of which they made Tapers to fet up in their Churches, for no fooner were the Tapers lighted, but all the Church was perfum’d. Formerly the PortUgah brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the Raja's about Cochin. But the Hollanders have deilroy’d all thole places, fo that the Cinnamon is now in their hands. When the Portugals had that Coaft, the £ngli(h bought their Cinnamon of them, and ufually paid for it by the Mein fifty Mamoudi’s.

Neverthelefs, the Hollanders buy it y and carry it into Perfi* for the fame ufe of painting. That which remains after the colour is drawn off, is only fit to make fealing Wax. That which comes from Pegu is not fo dear, though as good for other Countries. The difference isoniy this, that it is not lb clean in Pegu, where the Pifmiresfoul it, as in BengaU, where it grows in a heathy place, full of Shrubs, where thofe Animals cannot fo well come at it. The Inhabitants of Pegu never make any ufe of it in painting , being a dull fort of people, that are in nothing at all induftrious. The Women of Surat get their livings by cleanfing the Lakejafterthe Scarlet colour is drawn from it. After that they give it what oolour theypleafe, and make it up into Sticks for fealing Wax. The Lnglijh and Holland Company carry away every year a hundred and fifty Chefts. The price is about ten Pence the pound. Powdefd Sugar is brought in great quantities out of the Kingdom of BengaU; it caufes alfo a very great Trade at Ougeli, Patna, Daca, and other places. I have been told it for a very great certainty, by feveral ancient people in BengaU , that Sugar being kept thirty years becomes abfolute poifon, and that there is no Venom more dangerous, or that fooner works its effcft. Loaf Sugar is alfp made at Amadabat , where they are perfe&amp;Iy skill d in refining it 5 for which reafon it is call’d Sugar Royal. Thefe Sugar Loaves ufually weigh from eight to ten pound. Opium is brought from Brampour, a Town of good Trade between Agra and Surat. The Hollanders buy great quantities, which they truck for their Pepper. Tobacco alfo grows in abundance round about Brampour; fometimes there has been fo much that the Natives have let vaft quantities rot upon the ground, for want of gathering. Coffee grows neither in Ferfia nor in Jndia, where it is in no requeft- but the Hollanders drive a great Trade in it, tranfporting it from Ormns into Per ft a , as far as Great Tart ary , fr om,Ba Ifara into Chaldea , Arabia , Mesopotamia, and the other Provinces of Turky. It wasfirft found out by a Hermite, whofe name was Sheck-Siadeli , about twenty years ago, before which time it was never heard of in any Author either ancient or modern. Lain Silk Wares may be alter’d in length, breadth, and quality. The quality fhews it felf when they are of an even thread, when the weight is equal, and when there is no Cotton thread in the Weft. The Indians not having the art of gilding filver, put into their ftrip’d Wares threads of pureGold/o that you muft count the quantity of Gold threads to fee whether the Silk have its due number. And this alfo you muft obferye in your Silks wov n with Silver. As for Taffata's, you are only to mind whether the pieces be all of a finenefs, and to fee by unfolding fome of them, that there be nothing within to augment the 'Weight, and then weighing ail the pieces by thecnfelves, to fee that they all agree. Deceits in Silk Wares. TheDeceits is Indian Commodities.

The eye of the Broaker is to judge of the kr P l nefs, beauty, and fincnels of thofe Carpets which are wrought with Gold and Silver, and whether they be fine and rich.

The finenefs U dilcern d by the eye, the length and breadth by the meafure. But the Indians pradile a more cunning way, which is to count the number of threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the finenefs of the kantling. When the number fails, it is either more tranfparent, more narrow, or more courie. 1 he difference is fometimes fo difficult to be perceiv’d, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great deal. For it is nothing to coulen a Crown or two Crowns in a piece that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Thofe that whiten thf ft Calicuts, to lave charge^ of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts exceffively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury , and lowers the price.

As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and printed as they come out of the Loom, the Merchant muff take care that what he befpeaks be finifli’d before the end of the Rains, for the thicker the Waters where they are wafh’d, the more lively will the printed and painted colours appear. It is eafie to diftinguifli between the printed and the painted Calicuts* and between the neatnds of the work: but forthe finenefs and other qualities, they are not fo eafil^difcern’d 5 and therefore the Broaker muft be more careful. cheats in Cotton.

F the effe&lt;5l of Education may be liken’d to a fecoad Birth, I may truly fay, that I came into the World with a defire to travel. The daily difcourfes which fe« verai Learned men had with my Father upon Geogra phical fubjedis, which my Father had the reputation of underftanding very well, and to which, though v\ rv young, I was with much delighf attentive, inipix'd u betimes with a defign to fee fome part of thole CountrieSjWhich were reprt fented to me in the Maps, from which I never could keep off my Eves* By two and twenty years of Age,therefore I had feen the faireft Regions of Europe, France, England E\\z Low Countries,Gtrmany, Switzerland, Poland 9 Hungary and Italy ; and I fpeak indifferently w^eli the Languages mofl neceffary and moft generally fpoken. My firft faiiy was into England, where at that time Reigned King ames ; from thence I paisd into Flanders to lee Antwerp, my Father’s Native Country, and fo into the Low Countries, where my inelinatiori to travel became the ftronger, by reafon of the great Concourfc of Stran gers which I met at that crouded thither from all parts o the World 1 Having feen wnat w r as mofl confiderable in the united Provii ce* &gt; I^ pafsd into Germany, and when I came to Etorimbergh, by the way of Frankfort and Aufpurgh, the noife of the Armies that were marching into Bohemia to retake Prague, inftilFd into me a delire to go to the \Vars, where I might learn fomething, that might,be uleful to me in the feries of my travels. I was not above a days journey from Normlergf$. when I met a Colonel of Horfe, whofb name was Hans Brener &gt;&gt; the Son of Philip Brener, QoMtxnonic of Vienna, who engag'd metof ow him into Bohemia, Sometime after I bore the fame Colonel comp ny to I i erina, who prefen ted me to the Governour of Raah , his ! ! ncie, then Viceroy oiHungary alfo ; who receiv’d me into his Family as one oi his Pages, for it is a ufual thing in Germany for Gentlencns Sons to ferye in that quality ’till, five and twenty years of age, and feldom to quit that lervice, till they have a Commiffion for a Cornet, or Enfigns place. Four years and a half I ferv’d the Viceroy, when the. Prince of Mantua came to Vienna , to engage the perour l. certain [3 ,. * lefistns V* ‘The Design of defigns of his own without fuccefs. At that time the Count of whofe Sifter the Viceroy had Marry’d, was chief Minilter to the Prince &gt; of Mantua ; and coming to vifit the Viceroy at Javarin, I was ap pointed to attend him during his ftay there. Upon his departure, he told the Viceroy , that the Prince of Mantua had no perfon about him that underftood the Language, and that therefore he might be fure that the Prints would take it for a great kindnefs, to permit me to attend his perfon during his ftay at the Emperours Court. This was % thing eafily granted to the Count of Arc ; who thereupon earn’d i«e-along with him to Vienna, where having had the good fortune not to difpleafe the Prince, he teftify’d to me at his departure, that he fliould be glad to fee me at where he would not forget the fervices;! had done him. This prefently infus’d into me a defire of feeingefpe- cialiy upon the opportunity that: offer’d it feif not long after. _ ForMonfieur de Sabran^ the King of Frames Envoy to his Impe rial Majefty , being to go for and defirousbfone that under ftood the German Language to bear him company , I laid hold of the occafion; fo that in eight days we got to Venice. While we flay’d at Venice , I took a view to my great fatisfa&amp;ion, of that moft Celebra ted City, and in regard it is in many things like to Amflerdam^ as in Situation, Qreatnefs, Magnificence, Commerce, and Concourfe of Strangers? my being there did but ftill reinforce my inclination to wvel. From Venice I went to Mantua with Monfieur de Sabran y where the since being glad to fee me again, gave me my choice of an Enfjgn, r of a place in the Company of the Ordonnance of the Duke his Father, accepted the latter as being glad to be under the Command of the 'onde de Quiche^ who was then Captain. At the Siege of Mantua \ had ike to have been flain, but for the goodnefs of a Cuirafs which I had chofen out of the Princes Magazin, being hit with two Bullets above and upon the left pap, which had enter'd, had not my Arms been excel lent proof: So that after I was recover’d of my Bruifes, a longer fta 3 f it Mantua did not agree with my defire to travel. Therefore fome time after the Siege was rais'd, I took leave of the hince, who gave me an honourable Pals, by vertue whereof five or fix dorfe-men bore me company back to Venice. From Venice I went to VaurCita^ from Lauretta to Rome, from Rome to Naples^ from whence ; returning to again, I {laid there ten or twelve dayes. After that T went to fee Florence^ Pifa, Ligorn&gt; and Genoa, from whence I Embark’d V-r MarfeHies. From Marfeilies I hafted to Paris*, where I could not ftay long; for being defirous to fee Poland, I pafs’d once more into Germany through Switzerland, after I had tak’n a furvey of the principal Towns of the Cabins. I went by the Rhine by Water, to viftt Sirasburgh and Brifack; then fv by Land crofting Suabia, I pafTd through Vlme and Aufpurgh to go Munich.

But about two Leagues from Clogam, meeting with Colonel Butler , a Scotch Gentle- man , Colonel^of one of the Emperours Regiment of Horfe,who afterwards ktlld rPale^leyne in purluance of the Orders he receiv’d I gave over my firft intended journey.

For fear of being Robb’d he had convey’d them before into the hands of a few, in Ratislone, his Correfpondent, to be deliver’d to his Son at his coming. This young man arriving at Ratishone , went to the Jew, who told him that he had receiv d a fmall Casket of Jewels from his Father, which he might take away, when ne pleas d.

Thereupon the Officers carrying the Body to the fame publick-iioule, as being next at hand, his face was no fboner waui d, but the Woman and Maid of the Houle knew him to be the fame young man that had been there drinking with the few not long oefore.

Concerning the Channel of which Sea, I muft make one Ob- fervation; that though there be no part of the Sea but has one Current, yet this has two quite contrary one to another. That part next to Europe carries the VefTel to the Black Sea ; and that next Afia brings it back again to the Mediterranean. So that you have no more to do but to crofs over from one Shore to the other. ' The Winter being over, the two French Gentlemen purfu'd their Voyage for Alexandretta. But for my part, I having another defiga in my head, flay’d at Conftantinopie, in expeftation of se£ a Caravan „ which the people told me from Month to Month was coming * I was then ignorant, and did not underftand that every year there were five or fix Caravans that went from Bur fa.

At length, after I had continu’d eleven Months in Conflcmtinofle , I de parted with a fair and numerous Caravan for Ifpahan , which was the firft time I travell’d into Afia. After that I made five others, wherein, I had time better to underftand the Qualities of the Countries, and the Genius of the People.

' / ' A ' ■ . - '. e- . ' Of the &lt;lfoads from France to the hither parts of Afia, and the (places from whence they ufually fct out for Ifpahan. ' Man cannot travel in Jfia, as they do in Europe 9 nor at th% fame Hours, nor with the lame cafe. There are no weekly Coaches or Wagons from Town to Town ; befides, that the boil of the Countries is of feveral natures. In j 4 fia you fhall meet with feveral Regions untill’d and unpeopl’d, either through the badnefs of the Climate and Soil, or the (loth of the Inhabitants, who rather choofe to live miferably, than to work. There are vaft Defects to crofs, and very dangerous, both for want of Water, and the Pvobberies that the j 4 rabs daily commit therein. There are no certain Stages, or Inns to entertain Travellers. The bcft Inns, efpecialiy in Turkie, are the Tents which you carry along with, you, and your Hofts are your Servants, that get ready thofe Vi&amp;uals which you have bought in good Towns. You fet up your Tent in the open Field, or in any Town where there is no Inn : and a good fhift too in temperate weather, when the Sun is not too hot, or that it does not rain. In the Carvanferds or Inns which are more frequent in Terfia than in Turkic, there are perfons thatfurnifh you withProvifions, and thcfirft come arebeft ferved. As for Turkic it is full of Thieves, that keep in Troops together, and way-lay the Merchants upon the Roads, and if they be not very well guarded will certainly rob them: nay many times murder them. A mif- chief prevented in Pcrfia by the well order’d convenience which is provided for Travellers. To avoid thefe dangers and inconveniences, you are oblig’d to ftay AThe Persian Travels. Book. I t for the Caravans, that go for Perfia or the Indies, which never fet out but at certain times, and from certain places. Thcfe Caravansfet out from Cenflantinomic, Smyrna, and Aleppo. And it is from one of thefe Cities that a Traveller muft fet out, that intends for Perfia, whether he keeps company with tfie Caravan, or will hazard himfelf alone with a Guide asonce I did. I will begin with Conflantinople, from whence you may go either by Land or Sea • and either by Land or Sea there are two ways to go. The firft of thefe by Land is that which I took with Monfieur Chapes and Monfieur St. Liebau y By the way take notice, that PTenna is the half-way near-upon between Paris and Confiaminople. The fecond Road is kfs frequented, but iilefs inconvenient and lefs dangerous: for there are need of the Emperour’s Pafports, which he does not grant very freely: befides that here-isho fear of the Pirates of Tunis or Argier y as when you embarque from Marfeilks or Ligorn. If you intend this way, you muft go to Venice ; from Venice to Ancona, from whence feveral Barques are bound every Week for Ragufa. From Ragitfa you fail along by the Shore to Dura^z.o a Sea* Port of Albania j trom whence you travel the reft of the way by Land. From Vurazzo to Albanopolis, diftant three days journey, from thence to Moneftier, juft as far ^ from Moneftier you may either take the left hand through Sophia, and Philippopolis,ox the right through Jnguifcher, three days journey from Moneftier, and ten from Adrianople, fron^ whence in five days you reach CoMantimple through Selivrea. This laft way is part by Sea and part by Land .* but there are two other ways alto gether by Land, above and below Italy, according to the diftinilion which Antiquity made of the two Seas that almoft encompafs it. You may embark at Venice, and fayling along the Gulf which is free from Pirates, you muft double the Cape of Matapan, the moft Southern Point of all to enter into the The other way is from Marfeilles or Ligorn, from whence feveral VdTels are bound for the Eaft. Thefafeft way is to go'along with the Rngli^) or Holland Fleets, that u- fually arrive at Ligorn either in the Spring or in Autumn, and part juft againft the Morea, to the feveral parts whither they are bound. As the Wind ferves, thofe Fleets fometimes make Sail between the Jfland of Elba and Italy, and by the Tower of Mejfina: fometimes below and Sardigna, within fight of Malta, Thus you muft come within fight of Candy, ,whether you are bound for Conflantinople, Smyrna, or Alex andrett a, from whence it is but three days journey to Aleppo: from one of which three Cities, you muft necdTarily begin your journey, if you intend for Terjia. y Some take Egypt in their way, ufing through Alexandria, Cairo, and Damiata, whence feveral VefTels are bound for Joppa-, or St. Johns of Aera, which is not far off: from thence to Jerufalem or Damafcus, and from thence to Bagdat or Babylon, . If you will venture in a fingle Veffel not ftayingfor the Fleets, you may hire a Veffei from Ligorn to Naples, from Naples to keeping along by the Shore, and lying aihore every night. I took this way, and went from Meflina to Syracafe, where are to be feen the moft remarkable footfteps of Antiquity..’Tis like a City underground, and near to it is a great Rock which has been made hollow, at the bottom whereof if a man whifper, they that are at the top may hear him. They call this Rock Dionyfius the Tyrant’s Ear .* for being at the top, he eafily underftood what the People laid of him beldw; and difeovered the Counfels of the chief Men* of Syracufe, whom he kept prifoners there. Syracnfe has nothing of that fplendour whichrenown’ditwhen it wasthe Miftrefsof all Sicily, and when Greece, jealous of her power, made War upon her. But the Soil is very plentiful, and theGalliesof Maltavtry often take in their Provifiops there. Near the City is a fair Convent of Capuchin Friers, going out of which, you may walk for half an hour between two very high Rocks, where there are feveral little Cells with every one a Garden, where the Friers foriietimes retire, and it is certainly one of the moft pleafing Solitudes in the World. From Syracufe I went to Malta, where you muft wait for feme Ship that is bound for. the Eaft.Chap. IT. of Monfieur Tavernier. CHAP. li. Of the Iftad from Conftantinopie to Ifpahati, which the Authof kept in his firft Travels into Perfia.. I T is feldom that any Caravans go from Conflantinopfe into Perfia but from Bur- fa they go every two Months: Bur fa is tfte Capital City of Bithynia y not a- bove three days journey from Conftantinoprlloi a little more. Thefe two Roads meet at Chabangi? where you may be trom Burfa in two Days : and fot will only fpeak of the Roads from Conftantinoyle to Jfpahan. This Journey is to be under taken either with the Caravan of Camels, or elfe ten or twelve Men in a Company, Well mounted and well arm’d. From Conftantinopie you crofs over to Scutari^ upon the Coaft of Afta. Setting out from Scutari, the firft days journey is very pleafant, over Fields gayly painted with Flowers in their ieafon. At firft for fome time together, on both fides the way, you fee nothing but fair Sepulchers with their Pyramids, and you may eafilydifcern the Womens Monuments from the Mens. For there is a Turbant upon the Pyramid of the Mens Sepulcher, but the Pyramids of the Womens Monuments are trimnvd with the Head *Attire which is worn by the Women of the Country. That Evening you muft lye AlCartali y a Village of Bithynia, the next Day at Ce- bifa, antiently Lybijfa, famous for the Tomb of Hannibal. In that place there are two good Inns, and two fair Fountains. The third day you come to Ifnich, which is thought to be the ancient Nicea , one part of the City is built upon the defeent of a Hill, the other part upon a Plain that reaches to the Sea, and makes the Golf of Ifnich. The Haven confifts of two Moles made of Free-ftone, and three ^reatEnclofures encompafs’d with Walls, which ferve inftead of fo many Arfenals, wherein there are Store houfes full of large Timber, for building Houles and Galleys. The Country round about being an excellent place for Hunting, and the Soil bearing rare Fruits, and rich in Wine, caus’d Sultan jftmuratt to build &amp; Seraglio in the higheft part of the Town, from whence there is a profpetf: at the fame time both over the Sea and the Country.The Jews inhabit the greateft part of the Town, dealing chiefly in Timber and Cot i. When the Wini ferves, you may go from Conftaminople to Ifnich in feven or eight Hours, there being no danger in the paffage. The fourth Diy you ftay at Chabangi , a fmall Town built qpon the fide of a Lake call’d Chaban Giguf where there are two Inns. From the beginning of the Lake for two Leagues together you travel partly over Mountains, partly by the Lake- fide, where in tome places the Horfe will be up to the Belly. This Lake is not above ten Leagues in compafs; but it yields great ftore of large Fifh, infomuch that I have bought a Pike two Foot and a half long for three Soits. Many Emperours have had a defign to make a Cuttout of this Lake into the Sea, for the more eafie tranf- porting to Conftantinopie the Timber which grows upon the Mountains near the Lake. And it the Grand fiery who by a Miracle dy’d in his Bed, and left his Sonfuc- ceffor to his Employment, had liv’d fome Years longer, he had no queftion added this to the reft of thofe famous Wotks that eterniz’d his Memory. Departing from Chabangi,you come to lye at Night upon the Bank of a River call’d Zac.ryt , which r tins Northward and falls into tbzBlackSea. It is a River plentiful in Fbn, and you crofs over it with a wooden Bridge. There is neither To wn, nor Inn in thatpMce ; but a League from the River is a great Town call’d the chiefeft part of the. Inhabitants wherepf are Armemians, Thither we fent for excellent good Wine, and other necefTary refrefhments. From that Pjver ibCancoli, where you lye the next Night, and have your choice of four Inns} you travel all the day in the Merfhes, over wooden Bridges and Caufeys. fuskebafar is the next place, a fmali Village with two Inns. F^om tftence to CVsr- gkefiar, a great Town, with one Inn, built upon a River, where there is great ftore of Fiih taken, which the inhabitants td\\Bourma bakuky^ that is to fay, the A 2 FffiThe.

Pelia ov is a City feated at the foot of fevcral Mountains the Inhabitants whereof are for thei^oft £ar£ Thefe Mountains are very high, and extend themfclves along the Road for Two days journey. They are fall of feveral forts of Trees, which are ftreight and tall like Firr-Trees : £nd divided by fo many Torrents,which it would be hard to pafs over,where it not for the Bridges that the Grand Vifier Knprigli caus’d to be built. Irt Regard the foil of thefe Moun- tains is very fat, there would be no drawing for the Horles after great Rains or the melting of theSnow, hadnotthe fame Vifier caus’d all the Ways re be Pay’d and Pitch’d, evenzskt asConftanttnopjt. A Work of greaf charge, in regard there is not a Flint in any part of the fountain, and for that the Stone is ^fetch'd a great way off. There are abundance of Pigeons as big as Hens, and of ah excellent raft, which not only pleas’d our Appetites, but afforded Us very goodPaftime to (hoot them. Between the City and the Mountain, there is a Plain about two Leagues in length j near to which, there glides a River that waters it, and very much contributes to its fertility. It is an excellent Soil, and produces all things neceffary for humane Life. Upon each fide of the way I counded above Twenty Churchyards- For it is the cuftomof the Turks to bury near the Highway, be- lieving that the Travellers pray for the Souls of the deceas’d. Upon every Tomb there is to be feen a Marble Pillar, half fix’d in the Earth : of which Pillars there are fo great a number, of various Colours, that it is from thence conje&amp;ur’d, that there were a very great number of Chriftisn Churches in Polia^nd the parts there abouts. They affur’d me likewife, that there was a vaft quantity of thefe Pillars in the Villages up and down in the Mountains which the Turks every day pull down and fet up their Tombs. Bsndourlour is a Village in the Mountains where there is one Inn. Gerradar is beyond the Mountains, where there are two Inns. ' has two Inns, and lyes in a good Country. Caragaler is a Town where there are two Inns. Cofaar is a Village with one Inn. Tocia is a great City fituated upon rifing Hills, that joyn to very high Moun tains. Upon the Winter Weft, there appears a fair Champain Country, water’d by a Stream that falls into a River of a greater bignefs, call’d Gufelarmac. Upon the higheft of the fmaller Hills toward the Eaft, there is a Fortefs, where a refides*, and in the Town is one of the faireft Inns upon the Road. Thegreateft part of the Inhabitants are Chriftian GV^x, who have the advantage to drink ex. cellent Wine, with which the Country furnilhesthcm in abundance. Jgifenfalou (lands upon a River, and there is an Inn and a fair Mofquee in it. O&amp;entan is a little City feated at the fcot of a Hill, upon which there (lands a ftrong Caftle, and below two very commodious Inns, The River (jufeUrmc, broad and deep, wadies the South-fide of the City, which you crofs over one of the faireft Bridges that ever was feen. It confiftsof Fifteen Arches, all of Free- ftone, and is a work that (hews the Grandeur of the Undertaker. Somewhat at a diftance from the Bridge (lands Six Corn-Mills all together, with little wooden Bridges to go from one to another. This River falls into the Euxin Sea,about eight days journey hort\Oz.eman. . e esiziUr is a great Town, where there are two Inns. Delekiras is a great Village, with one Inn. Thefe Four days Journeys are very dangerous, by rcafon that the Ways arc narrow, and commodious for Robbers. They are very numerous in this Country j and therefore underftanding that we were way-laid, wefentand defir’d a Convoy of the Bajha, who lent us fifty Horfemen. Amafut is a great City, built upon an afeent in the hollow of a Mountain. It has no profped, but only from the South over a fair Plain. The River that runs by it comes from Tocat^ and throws it felf into the Black-Sea, iour days journey from Arnafia. You crofs it over a wooden Bridge, fo narrow that not above three perfons can go a-breft. To bring frefh Water to the City, they have cut a League into Rocks as hard as Marble, which was a prodigious Labour. On the Weft-fid?, upon a high Mountain, (lands g Fortrefs, where they can come by no other Water thanChap.II. 0/Monfieur Tavernier. 5 what they preferve in Cifterns when it rains. In the middte of the Mountain is a fair Spring, and round about it are feveral Chambers cut out of the Rock ? where the Dervichs made their abode. There are but two Inns, and thofe very bad ones, in But the foil is good,and bears the belt Wine and Fruits in all Natolia* Ainabachar, is the name of an Inn, diftani a quarter of a League from a great Town where they fetch their Provifions. Tiircall is a great Town near to a Mountain^upon which there (lands a Caftle. The River that comes from Tocat v#fhes the Houi'es, and we caught excellent Filh in it. In that place is another of the faired Inns upon the Road. From T nrcaH you may travel in one day to Tgcat) where the Road from Smyrna to Ifpahan meets. Toe at is a good fair City built at the foot hf a very high Mountain, fpreading it feif round about a great Rock that dands aimodin themidft of the Town, upon the top whereof a high Cadle commands the neighbouring parts, with a good Garrifon in it. It is very ancient, and the remainder of three others that dood there in former times. The City is very well inhabited with Turks, who are the Lord Con trollers- Armenians, Greeks, and Jem. The Streets are very narrow, but the Houfes are indifferent well built*, and and among feveral Mofquees, there is one very magnificent, which feems to be newly rear’d. There wasalfo a very fair Inn going up, which when I lad traveled that way, was not quite finilh’d. There is one thir r; more particular and more commodious at Tocat, which is not to be found in any Inns upon the R6ad, That round about all the Caravanferas in the Town, there are Lodgings which they let out to Merchants, that defire to be by thcmfclves out of the noife and hurry of the Caravans, whiles they day at Tocat. Befides that, in thofe private Lodgings you have your liberty to drink Wine, and provide for the red of your Journey j which is not fo eafily done in the publick Inns, where the Turks will have an eye upon the Merchants, to draw Money out of their pockets. The Chriftians have twelve Churches at Ttfcvtf, and there refides an Archbifhop, that has under him feven Suffragans. There are alfo two Monaderies for Men, and two for Women ; and for fourteen or fifteen Leagues round Tocat, the Country is all inhabited by Armenian Chridians, but very few Greeks being intermix’d among them. The greated part of thefe Chridians are Tradefmen, and for the mod part Smiths. A fair River runs about half a quarter of a League from the City, which rifes near to Eraerom, and is crofsM at Tocat over a very beautiful done Bridge. Upon the North fide of the City, it waters a Plain three orfourdays Journey in extent* and two or three Leagues broad. It is very fertil, and replcnifh’d with fair Vil lages very well peopl’d. A man may live very cheap atlocat: the Wine is mod excellent, andallfortof rare Fruit very plentiful. It is the only place in aUAJia where plenty of Saffron grows, which is the bed Commodity you can carry to the where a Pound, as the Years fall out, is worth thirteen or fourteen * Franks, * Every Frank though the Wax that preferves it, be as much in weight as the Saffron. This City, being 2 s. with the Lands belonging to it, ufuailyisthe Dowager Sultanejfes ]oynturc. There derling, is only an Aga and a Cady, that command there in the behalf of the Grand Signor: for the BaJJja, from whom they receive their Orders, lives ztSivas, which is the ancient and a very great City, fome three days journey from In (hort, Tocat is one of the mod remarkable Thoroughfares in the Ead,where are continually lodg’d the Caravans from Perfia, Diarbequer, Bagdat, Conjfantinople, Smyrna, Synopses, and other places *, and here, the Caravans turn off, as they are varioufly bound. They that are for Conftantinople, take to the Winter Wed upon the right hand *, they that are for Smyrna, incline to the Summer Wed, upon the left hand. When you fet out either way out of Tocat, there is a Toll-gatherer that counts all the Camels and Horfes that pafs by,and exa&amp;s for every Can el a quarter of a Rixdollar, and for every Horfe half as much. As for the Horfes or Camels that carry the Paffengers or their Provifions, they pay nothing. This con. ualconcourfe of the Caravans trolls the Money about at Tocat, and makes it one of the mod con- fiderabie Cities of Turkic. Setting out of Tocat to go to Erzerom, you difeover a little Village fofttuated v v under a Hill, as if the Mountain lay atop of it ^ and between that Mountain and the River, the Road is very narrow where the Caravan is to pafs. In this Road it was, that we met the Grand Pifier returning from Hunting, with a Train of four hundredThe Persian Travels Book j[. hundred men: fo foon as he perceiv'd us, he fil’d off all his men to give us lib^ to pafs by. But among all the Company, there was not above four Franks U p 0 ^ which he particularly caft his Eye } which made him lend for t c Caravan Bacchi to Know who we were. The Caravan Bacchic to avoid the ill Confequences of jealoufie which the Ftfier might have of the Franks, at a time when the Grand Fifier made War in Perfia, told him we were Jew, at which the lhaking his Head reply’d only that we did not look like fuch, and happy it was for us that he took no farther notice. For it was twenty to one, but that upon better confideration he might have fent after us to have ftopt us. But when he came home to his Lodging he found a flaying for him, with Orders from the Grand Signor to take off his Head, which were prefently executed. For Amnrath being troubl’d for the lofs of his Army, had no way but to revenge himfelf upon the perl on that had the command of it. Notwithftanding that the reft atTocat, yetthey ftay likewife two or three days at which is not above two Leagues diftant from it; for Charkiiquea is a great I own in a lovely Country, between two ferti! Hills, where there grows exc llentWine. It is for the moft part inhabited by Chriftians, who are generally Tanners. The fine blew Goat leather Skins being dreft in Tocat, and the.Parts thereabout. It is thought the Water contributes very much to their &gt; Art. For Tocat is as famous for the blew Goats-leather Skins, as Diarbequir and Bagdai are for the red, AfouJJhl or the ancient Niniveh for the yellow, and 0«r/4 for the black,. About two tnoufand Paces from this Town, in the midft of a Plain riles avail Rock, uporuheNorth-fide whereof you afeend about nine or ten Heps into a Chamber with a Bed. a Table, and a Cupboard in it, all hewn out of the Rock. Upon the Weft fide you afeend other five or fixfteps that lead to a little Gallery, about five or fix Foot long, and three broad, all hewn out of the Rock, though it be of an extroardinary hardnefs. The Chriftians affirm that St. Chryfoflom made this Rock his retiring-place during his Exilement, and that he had no other Bed or Bolder than the Rock it lelf, in a place where they (hew you the print of a Man’s Body.Hence it is, that the Caravans, confiding for the moft part of Chriftian Merchants, ftay at Charktiqueu, to pay their Devotions to this Rock, where the Bilhop of the place, attended by fome Priefts, with every one a Taper in their Hands, goes and fays Mafs. But the main Reafon is, becaufe there grows excellent Wine in this place, which being cheaper by half here, than it is at Toe at, obliges the Armenians to flop here, to provide themfelves for the reft of their Journey. Two Leagues from youcrofsbver very high Mountains, with Pre cipices on both fid es. It is the cuftom of the Armenians, when they hear of the approach of a Caravan, to ride out two or three days journey to meet their Coun-/ try-men and carry them frefh Provifions. Thefeof C bar liqaeu coming to meet our Caravan, three of the Armenians took a large Morning-draughts, which made them fo Pot-valiant, that they would needs ride before to the Town alone by them felves j but by the way they were fet upon by fix Horfe men that came from the North, where there are higher Mountains than thole which we were to crofs.Imme- diately the Thieves darted their Half Pike^ at Toe Armenians, in fo much that two of them fell down mortally wounded, and the other fav’d himfelf among the Rocks, but the Thieves got their Borfes and Goods, which were valu’d at ten thou- fand Crowns. The Caravan at the top of the Hill beheld the misfortune of thofe poor men which their own folly had brought upon them, but could not help them, by reaf&lt;$h of the narrownefs of the ways; befides, that the Thieves knowing ail the by-turnings, were prefently out of fight. And therefore it is a dangerous thing to leave the Body of the Caravans, either by Haying too far behind, or running too fall before: and fome have fuffer’d for diftancing themfelves not above five hun dred Paces frcn?^ ; t. 'j The do nota^Hnake their Journeys all alike *, but come to their Stages fometimes fooner, fometimes later, according as they meet with Waters and Inns, or places fit to pitch their Tents in, to which places the Natives bring Provifion and Provender from the Mountains. There are fome places where there is a need- fity to provide Straw and Barley for two or three days. If you travel in May, wh£n the Grafs is high, it cofts nothing to feed the Horfes and Camels For as7 Chap. II. of Monfieur Tavernier. foonasthe Cptravan is lodg’d, the Servants go and cut the Grafs from off the Hil locks, where it is much better then upon the Plains. But while the Beafts feed only upon Grafs they are much weaker, and cannot travel fo far as at other times. From the Mountain where the Armenians were fet upon, you come to Almom y a little Village upon a River, which you crofs, over a Bridge of Wood. Going out of Almous, you crofs a large Plain, at the end whereof you lodge upon the Bank of a fair River , call’d Toiifanion-fou, which falls into the River of Tocat. Having pafs’d this River, you afeend a high Mountain, which the People of the Country call Kara behir-be^Hiendren^ov y the Mountain that flops the Grand Signors^ for it is very’rugged, and you mult of neceflity alight to alcend it. In that bad WaytwoHorfes that carry’d each of them two Bales of Cloth burft under their Burthen, which prov’d excellent Food for feveral Tartars that were before us, and were pitch’d in the place where we intended to have lodg’d our felves} fo that \ve were forc’d to go a quarter of a League farther. Thefe Tartars when they heard of our two dead Horfes, made immediately to the Mountain fifteen or fixteen of them with all joy imaginable to devour it. They flea’d the Horfes, and when they came back (fori flay’d to fee them) they brought every one a great piece of Flefli between the Saddle and their Horfes backs. For by that means the Flelh mortifies, and bakes as it were, through the motion and heat of the Horfc, and fo they eat it without any more a-do. 1 faw one of them that took a piece of thofe Horfes Flefh, and after he had beaten it foundly between two nafty Linnen Clothes with a piece of Stick, fet his Teeth in it, and devour’d it with a very greedy ap petite. Upon the top of the Mountain which I have mention’d, there is a Plain, and in the midftof the Plain a Fountain call’d Chefme-beler y or, A Fountain of Chrijlah near to which, on the South-fide, there ftands a Village. From the place where we lodg’d, we came to a little Town called Adras, the In habitants whereof are all Armenians. Afpidar is but two Leagues from Adras, and is but a Village. Jsbeder is another Village in the Mountains, where the Caravan generally flays one or two days; as well to pay the Cuftom, which is the fourth part of a Rixdollar upon every Camel, and half as much for every Horfe *, as for the excellency and cheap- nefsof the Wine, where every Man provides for himfelf. Twice we pafs’d by and paid nothing, in regard that the Caravan was too ftrong for the Toll-gatherers; and were it not that they flay for the Wine, they might go dire&amp;ly forward without paying any thing. . Leaving Jsbeder^ we came to another great Town in the Mountains; all the Houles are hewn out of the Rock upon which it isfeated, as are alfo all the Stair- Cafes. From this Village, having pafs’d a River, over a wooden Bridge, at the endiwherepf there ftands an Inn, you come to Zacapa, another Village, from whence through very narrow paflages, where you arc forc’d to unload the Camels, and carry your Goods upon Mens (boulders for thirty Paces together, you come to encamp in a little Plain. It lyes at the foot of a high Mountain, which they call Dikmebelly beyond which lies the Townafter which you crofs three Rivers; one fordable, the other over two Bridges,' and then you come to a Village call’d (farmem. From Garmeru you go to Seukmen, another Village; from Seukmen to Louri ; from Louri to CbaouqueU) which are two very handfom Towns* I faw an Old man at Chaouqueu who was above a Hundred and Thirty Years old, who wh&amp;i Sultan Amurathbti\zgz&lt;\Bagdat y gave his whole Army as much Oats as ferVd them one whole day. In recompence whereof, thz Sultan exempted him and his Children from all Taxes and Tolls for their Lives. ? Leaving Chaoucjueuy you come to a high craggy Mountain which is call’d dogtiy or. The Bitter Mountain. The Ways being narrow^, the Caravann fare d to travel fmgle; and then it is that they count all the Horfes, and all the Camels ^ every Horfc and every Camel paying to the Caravan- Mafter a certain Duty, which amounts to a good Sum if the Caravan be numerous. One part of that Money is to pay feven or eight ArmeniansyfCosx gpard the Caravan all the way ^ another part defrays‘The Persian Travels. Book. I -- - ft defrays the Ejipences upon the Road ; and the remainder is the Captain of the Ca ravstn’s Profit. Having pafs’d this Mountain, you come to lodge in a Plain which they call Gio- ganderefey and from thence to Erzerom you meet only with three Villages by th' way, Ackikdld-) Ginnis, and Higia y which are the Caravans Stages. During thefe three laft days journeys, you keep all along the Banks of for the'mofi parf which is yet but narrow, taking its fource Northward of Er&amp;erom. Tis a wonderful thing to fee the vaft quantities of large Aftaragiu that grow ail along the River with which you may load feveral Camels. J A League on this fide Ertercm the Caravan is conflrain’d to flop ; for the Officer of the Cuftom-Houfe accompanPd with the Bajha’s Lieutenant, comes here and tyes all the Bales and Chefts with a crofs Cord, upon which fee puts a Seal, to the end that when the Merchants come to the Town, they may not be able to take out any Bags of Money, or any pieces of Stuff on purpofe to hide them till they go away. The particular Bufinefs of the Bajhas Lieutenant in meeting the Caravan is. to fee whether the Merchants be. well provided with Wines. And if he defire any Bottles, whether it be then, or in the City, where they are not affiam’d to vifit every Merchant, there is no refufing them. For there grows no Wine at £rz.erom y all that is drank there being a fmall Wine of A4ingrelia y which is always green: which forces the Merchants to furnifh themfelves'with Wine at Tocat which they may do fufficiently to laft them into Berfia. The Officer of the Cuftom- Houfe generally allows the Caravan three days to reft *, during which time, he fends to the principal Merchants fome Fruit and other fmall Refrefhments, by which he isnolofer. After the three days are over, becomes and opens all the Bales and Chefts, and takes a particular account of all the Merchandizes. This Search and the changing of Beafi^, caufes the Caravm to'ftay generally twenty or five and twenty days at Erz^erom. * Erzerom is a frontier Town of Turkic toward Perjia. It is fituated at the end of a large Plain environ’d with Mountains, the Plain being beautified with many fair Villages. If you take in the Caftle and the Suburbs, it may pafs for a City, but the Houfes are ill built of Wood, without ajiy neatnels or proportion. There are fome Remains of Churches and of the ancient Buildings of the t/Trmenians y by which you may conjedure that it never was very beautiful. The Fortrefs (lands upon a high ground, with a double Wall, fquare Towers clofe one to another and a pitiful Moat. The^^refides there but in a very ill Houfe, all the Buildings about the Fortrefs being in a bad condition. In the fame Enclofure there is a litfle rifing Ground upon which they have rais’d a fmall Fort, wherein the Janifary- ^lives, and where the Bajha has no Power. When the Grand Sionor has a mind to the Head of this Bajha, or any other confiderable Perfon in the*Province he fends a Capjgi, with order to the Janifary to fend for the Perfon to the little Fort, where the Execution is prefently done. One Example hereof I faw in my laft Travels into Pcrfia : For the Bajha of Erzerom not having fent Twelve thoufand men fo foon as the Grand Signor requir’d them for his Wars in Candy, the fame Capgi that brought the Sentence of his Death, had the fame Order for the Exe cution of the Bajhaof Kars ; and meeting this Capigi upon the Road in a Village, upon his return for Conflaminople, he would needs (hew me whether I would or no, the Heads' of the two Bajha's, which he was carrying to the Grand Signor in a Between the firft and fecond Gate of the Fortrefs are to be feen four and twenty I ieces of Cannon, moft excellent Guns, but lying one upon another without Car riages. They lye at Erzerom to be ready upon all occafions when the Grand Signor makes war againft the Perfians. ^ There are in Erzerom feveral great Inns*, this City, like Tocat, being one of the greateft Thoroughfares in Twkie. The Country about it bears Wine, but not very good, and in regard the People are ftridly forbid to drink Wine, the Merchants are forc’d to buy it very privately, for fear it ffiould come to the know ledge of the Cadi. Though it be very cold at Erzerom, Barly grows there in fouity days, and Wheat in fixty, which is very remarkable. The Cuftoms paid there for the carrying out of the Gold and Silver, and upon all other Commodities, is very fevere. Silk, that comes out of Perjia, pays {our and twenty Crowns for a CamefsChap. IV. of Monfieur Tavernier. Camel’s Load, which is eight hundred Pounds. For in the mountainous Coun tries a Camel’s Load is no more •, but in the plain and even Countries they make ’em carry above ten hundred weight. A Load of Indian Calicutspays a hundred Crowns; but the Loads of Linnen are much heavier than thofe of Silk. As for other Commodities, they pay Six yer cent according to their value. From this Stage the Caravan lets forward to a Fortrefs call’d Hajfan /CzLz,where you muft pay half a Piafter for every Camels or Horfes Load going from Erzerom to Erivan, but returning you, p &gt;y but half as much. Leaving this Fortreis,you mull go and lodge at a Bridge near to a Village which is caW&amp;Coban Cupri. Over this Bridge, which is the faireftin the whole Journey, you crofs two. Rivers which there meet, one is the and the other is a Stream that falls from a Mountain call’d Bingniely both which disburthen themfelves into the &lt;tAras^ The Caravan ufually ftays a day or two at this Bridge 5 becaufe the Cara van divides it felfat this place, fome continuing on the High-road, others taking the Road of Kars, as well to avoid fording the Aras feveral times, as the paying a great Duty upon the great Road, where they exadfc four Piafters upon every Camel’s Load, and two upon every Horfe-Load, whereas at Kars you are dif* tnifs’d for half fo much. I went Kars Road twice*, but it is longer,and more troublefome than the other. As foon as you leave the Bridge, for the firft four daysyou travel over woody Mountains, and very defert Countries, where you meet but with one Village; but coming near Kars the Country is more plcafant, and well manur’d 5 bearing all forts of Grain. Kars is in 78 Deg. 40 Min. of Longitude, and 42 Deg. 40 Min. of Latitude 5 irravery good Soil. The City is very large, but thinly peopl’d, though Provifion be very plentiful and very cheap. But the Grand Signor always choofing that place to rendezvouz his Army, whenever he intended to recruit it, and to lodge his People there which he fent to build Villages ^ theKingof‘Per/fc* has ruin’d ail the Country, as he did at Sulfa, and in many other Frontier places, for nine or ten days journey together. From Kars to 8 rivan the Caravan makes it nine days journey, and lyes where h can find mod convenience, there being nocertain Stages. The firft days journey ends at a Monaftery and a Village, the one no lefs deferted than the other. The next day you come to the Ruincs of a great City, call’d Anikagae, in -the Armenian Language the CV&gt;y 0/ Ani, which was the name of an Armenian King that was the Founder of it. By the WaB, on the Eaft-fid€, runsa rapidftream that falls from the Mountains of Mingrelia, and empties it felf into the River o-' Kars. This City was very ftrongly fituated • being placed in a Merfh, where are to be feen the Remains of two Caufeys that only lead to the Town. There are the Ruines of feveral Monafteries; among the reft two that are entire, fuppos’d to be Royal Foundations. From thence to for two days jourhey, you meet with only two Villages *, near thglaft of which you ride by the fide of a Hill, whether wh^en the Caravan pafiesby, the people bring Horfes from feveral parts to be fold. The Great Road from the Bridge, where the Caravan parts, lyes thus : Two Leagues from the Bridge, on the right hand toward the South, lyes a great Mountain which the People of the Country call Mingol. In this Mountain there are abundance of Springs, and from one fide of it falls Euphrates, from the other fide the River of which empties it felf into the-/^/ fourteen ©r fifteen Leagues on this fide Erivan. The^naf, which the Ancients call’d falls from other Mountains Eaftward oi Mingol, which after many windings through the Upper rmenia, where it receives many other Rivers that fwcli its Streams, it difeharges it felf into the Cafpian Sea, two days journey ft&lt;}tsiShamaj(i» ppon the Frontiers of the ancient The whole Country is inter-cut by the Rivers Aras and Kars, and fevcral other Streams that fall into them, inhabited by very few, but what are Chriftians} thofe few Mahimetam that live among them being fofuperftitious, that they will not drink the Water of any of thofe Rivers, nor wafh in them 5 believing them impure and ( defil’d by the ufe which the Chriftians make of them.

Cmafinr is the firft Village where you lodge after you leave the BridgeofcW^I Kupri, going to Brivan. Hahcarcara is the next Stage to Co?ttafour : this is a great Town alfo inhabited by Chriftians, but the Houfes are built all underground like Caves. Coming thither the 'jth of Marcia 1655, [the Snow was fo deep that there was no ttavellin? fo that we were forc’d to flay there eight days. But the Cuflomer of £r^row under- ftanding in what a bad condition we were, came in perfon with five hundr edHorfe to make way for us, and fen t for the Country people round about to clear away the Show. But it was not fo much out of kindncfs to js, as for Msown Intereft For a new Officer being to fucceed him upon the 22 d oi March-, and our Caravan being very numerous, he would have loft above an Hundred Thoufand Crowns had we not come to Br^rom before that day. Many of the Paflengers were almoft blinded by continually looking upon the Snow, the colour whereof very much dims the Sight: for prefcrvation whereof the Travellers are Wont to wear black Cyprefo Hoods, made on purpofe, oyer their faces. Others wear furrd Bonnets fring’d about with Goats hair, which being long, falls over their Eyes, and does altogether as well as the Hood. The Caravan is ufually twelve days upon the Road, hQmBrz.eromt§ Brivan, Leaving Halicarcara, you ford the Araa three times, and crofs it the next day again: for it winds exceedingly. A League and a half from the place where you ford it the fourth time, upon the top ofa high Mountain ftands a Fortrefs call’d Kaguifgany which is the laft place which the Turk* poftefs on that fide. The Cm ftomers that live there come to the Caravan to take their Toll,which is four Piafters for every Camel loaden, and two for every Horfe loaden. In the year 1655 the Caravan lodging about a League from the Fortrefs of Kaiuifgan, the Mountains adjoyning being inhabited by Chriftian Armenians^ there came &lt;0 us a poor Bifhop attended by fifteen or fixteen perfons, among which there were certain Priefts who brought us Bread, Fowl, and Fruit, defiring the Charity of the Merchants, who recompcnc’d them to their fatisfa&amp;ion. About four or five Months after, this Bifhop had one of his Eyes ftruck out by a Janifary. That wicked Fellow came to the Town where the Bifhop liv’d,and lighting upon the Bifhop,ask’d him for Money, which becaufe the Bifhop had none to give him,in a rage he ftabb’d him in the Eye with his Dagger. Complaint was made to the tsiga* who *tis thought would have punifh’d the Offender, but he fled, and left the Bifhop without remedy of fatifi fattion. From the laft place where we encamp’d near the went and lodg’d the next day upon the fame River, jn the fight of a Village not above a quarter of a League. The Next day we crofs’d the River that runs from it/zr/, and parts Turkic from Perjja. The next day we ftop’d upon the Banks of Aras, half aLeague from a little Town 5 and this is the laft time you fee this River which you are conftram’d to pafs fo often. * Leaving we came to lodge in a plain, in fight of a Town which is not far cliitant. The next day the Caravan lyes in the Field, and tlfe next day it comes to ^ place where there are three Churches, whence it is but halfa days journey from CHAP.

Ill/ of Mo nlieur Tavernier. i i Nunnery for Virgins. The ^rmeniuns call this place EgmUfw, or the Only Danok- which is the Name of the chief. Church. You may find in theiu Chronicles, That it began to be Built about three hundred Years after Chrift, and that the Walls being rais’d to a good height, the Devil came huhe Night and pulPd down what they bthlt up in the Day, which he did for feveral Years: but that one Night Chrilt hirhreff appear’d, and that from that time the Devil furccas’d to moled them anymore; i'o that they finiih’d the Church. It is dedicated to St. Gregory y whom the Armenians have in very great veneration. And there is a Table of Stone, whereupon, according to their Chronicles, Chrift reded when he appear’d to St. Gregory. They that go into the Church, kifs this Stone with a very folemn Devotion. n The fccond is built in honour of a Princefs. that came with forty Virgins of Qua. lity to Grfgory. This Lady an King Caus’d to be thrown into &amp; W T eli full of Serpents? but (he receiv’d no harm. For fhc JiV/d, therein 14 Years by a great Miracle, and from that time to this, the Serpents that breed thereabouts never did any harm. That Idolatrous King had a defign to have enjoy’d that Princefs* who was very handfome, and all her Companions j but they overcame himby their Virtue: who thereupon, feeing he could not have his Will, put them all to f)eath. The Cuftom of all the Armenian^ as w^ell thofe that come out of Verfia^ as thofe that travel into Ve-'fia, is to perform their Devotions at thefe Three Churches *, and the Caravan flops ufually five or fix days ,during which time theyConfefs, and receive Abfolution from the Patriarch. ■, j The Patriarch has uhder him forty (even Archbiftops* ahd every Archbifhop has under him four or five Suffragans, with whom he lives in a Convent, where there are feveral Monks under their Jurifdi&amp;ion, So foon as they have faid their Mafti which is generally done an Hour after Day, they all go to work, and to dig and delve for their living. TRe Revenue of the Patriarch is 600000 Crowns or there* / abouts: for ikW thi Armenian Chriftians that are above fifteen Years of age, ought to pay him yearly five Sous. However there are many that do not pay him, by reafon of their poverty. Yet their defett is fuppli’d by the rich, who fomettmes pay him two or three Crowns a Head. But this Money does not ftay in the Pa triarch’s Pocket: nay he is fometimes behind hand *, for he is engag’d to relieve the poor Armenians, who have not wherewithal to pay the which is an Annual Tribute that they owe to the Mahometan Princes, to whom they are fubjeft: Other- wife needftty would force them to become Mahometans \ and they, their Wives and Children would be liable to be fold, which the Grand Patriarch labours all he can to prevent. Every Archbilhop fends him out of hisDiocefs what is neceflary to be rais’d for that intent. So that the Patriarch does but only receive it with one Hand, and pay it with the other } making no profit to himfelf of a Revenue which he has out of 400000 Villages, which the Archbiftiop of Sh Stef hens affirm’d to me tobe under his Jurifdi£Uon. / sj return’d from Perfia in the Year 1655, I came to the Three Churches about the end of February y the Caravan ftay’d there eleven Days, as well by reafon of the great Snows that ftop’d up the Ways, as for that the Armenians refolv’d to keep their Carnival there, and after that to perform their Devotions.The next day I went to vifit the Patriarch, who was fitting crofs-leg’d upon a Mat. There were four Aroh- bi{hops,and nine Biftiops fitting about him in the fame pofture, among whom there was one that fpake very good/ m/ww. 1 (fayed with him three Hours; and while we were difeourfing together, in came one of the Monks of the Covent, who had not fpoken to any perfon whatfoever in Two and twenty Years, by reaftm of a Penance that was impos’d upon him. Never did Man appear fo meager and de formed} but the Patriarch fent for him, and by his Authority commanded him to break filence, which he did, by fpeaking atthe fame Inftant. The Saturday before Shrove*Smday the Patriarch invited all thcC4raz/4tf,as well Maftcrs as Servants, to hear Mafs the next day, and then to dine at thfc Covent. Mafs being concluded, the People were brought into a long Gallery, about 1$ or aoFoot broad, there being a Table on both fides, made of feveral Stones, 2nd Benches next the Walls. At the upper end of the Gallery (lands a Table four Foot fquare, over which is a vaulted Roof fuftain’d with four Pillars, which ferves B 2 1 fof/ JjK 12 The Persian ‘Travels.

Then fix Bifhops with Ladles took out the M ’ out of the great Platters, and putting it into IdTcr, ferv’d both the Tables Em one had alfo his earthen Pot of Wine, which was very good, and was fill’d up! when it was empty. The Patriarch and the two Archbilhops eat nothing but r Eggs, and a few,raw Herbs; no more did the other Archbilhops that fate at the At the end of theFeaft, aBifhop comes with a Paper and Pen and Ink inh* Hand, and asks ©f every one what he pleafes to Subfcribc for the Benefit of the Church} then every one propofing, according to his Devotion, the Bilhop writes down the Names of the Perfons, and the Sum which they mention *, which he comes and gathers the nextday. There are forae rich Merchants that will give two ToMm but the meaneft Servant will give an Or. The Bifhop having done writing, the Ta’ ble was clear’d, and then they brought us Melons and other Fruits. In afhort while after the Bells rung to Evening Service, andthePeopIe went to Church. After EveningService the Patriarch fent for me to behold a Combat of of which there are great ftore in that Country, fome ferving to Till their Ground' while the Female ones yield ftore of Milk, of which they make Butter and Cheefe , and which they mingle with all forts of other Milk: There arc fome of thefe female Beafts that will give twoand twenty Pintsof Milk aday. They brought us into a wide Enclofure, to behold the Sport, wherein there were^eight Bufalo's.' To provoke them oneagainft another, they Ihew them a Red Cloth, which puts them into fuch a Rage, that there were two that dy*d with the ftroke of their Horns upon the place, and there were none of the reft which were not very much lam'd. The Sport being at an end, they bring a great quantity of Wood, which they pile together on purpofe to fet it on Fire. When the Wood Was heap dm as big a Pile as they intended, one of the Archbilhops prefen ted ala- per of white Wax to all the Company, both Matters and Servants, who every one agreed with him what they (hould give the next day for their Tapers. The Tapers being lighted, the Patriarch with a Stick like a Biftiop’s Crofier, march’d before, Tinging an Hymn, attended by all the Perfons both Ecclefiaftica! and Secular, Ijll they had in that manner walk’d three times about the Pile. When the Pile C r m u L ishtC&lt; ^ J herewas great ftriving who fhould have the Honour. One of the Merchants offer d a quantity of Oyl, for Lamps for the Church; another out-did him, and a third proffer’d more than he; and the Honour of Lightingthe i? given to him that offer d moft. Immediately upon that every one put out his laper: For they efteem it a moft precious bufinefs; believing that the lighting . thofeTapersinaStorm &gt; and throwing it into the Sea, is a prefent Charm agamftShipwrack.

Now in regard it was Night, every one ran out with Torches in their Hands, and fomemade Fires before their Doors, where Chrift: was to pafs along. This Feftival among the Armenians is like that of Candlemas-fay and they call it in their Language, Ter en Areche?

It is not a hundred Years fince this Patriarchal Church was in a much meaner Condition: Butfincc the great Sha-Ahas put the Armenians upon Traffick, they have very much enrich’d themfelves: For as they go'* great Gains} fo they made great Vows, and gave largely to the Church: , » , whereinChap. III. of Monlieur Tavernier. wherein there are now as rich Ornaments as in any Church of Chriftcndom. The Choir of the Church was hung round with a Venetian TifTue of Gold. The Pavement alfo of the Choir and the Body of the Church, together with the Steps to the Altar, were fpread with rich Tapeftry. For they all put off their Shooes before they go into the Church *, nor do the Armenians kneel as in Europe, but ftand all the while upright. When they hear Mafs, they fit after the Mode of the Country, but when the Leffons are reading they ftand up. Ail the Service-time their Heads are cover’d, unlefs at the Elevation of the Hoft, for then they take off their Bonnets, and kifs the Earth three times. There was upon the Altar a Crofs, with fix Candlefticks of Gold^ and upon the Steps to the Altar four Candlefticks of Silver five foot high. After they had fung feveral Hymns, the Patriarch feated himfelf in a Chair cover’d with Silk Tapeftry, four Archbifhops fitting with their Backs to a Pillar at his right hand. The Service was folemnly perform’d by an Archbifhop, with two Bifhops on each fide of him. After the Archbilhop had made certain Prayers, he took the Book wherein he had read the Gofpel and gave it the Patriarch, the Archbifhops, Bifhops, and all the People to Kifs. On the one fide of the Cover of that Book there are two Relicks enchas’d, which are cover’d with Cry ft al, which was the fide of the Book that was given to beKifs’d. The Ceremony being ended, many went to Kifs the Patriarch’s Hand, and fo retir’d. Ten Leagues from Erivan, toward the North, appears a great Lake, wherein there is an Ifland, upon which is built a very fair Covent. The Monks that live there, live fo auftere aLife, that they never eatFifh or Fldh above four times a Year : neither do they fpeak one to another, but upon thofe four Days. The reft of the Year .they feed only upon Herbs, which they gather out of the Garden: for fay Aey, it is not Falling, to eat either Butter or Oy I. The Bread which they eat is brought from the neighbouring Villages: and the Ifland is replenifh’d with all forts of excellent Fruits. On the one fide of the Lake nearer to Erivan is a large Plain, wherein there are fix Monafteries. One of which is entirely hewn out of the Rock, with the Pillars that fuftain it, being feated in a very hard Rock. The Armenians call that Church Kickart in their Language, and the Turks in theirs Guicurghieche, that is. See and away. In this Church, according to the Traditions of the is kept the Lance wherewith the Side of Chrift was pierc’d ; the Figure whereof I caus’d to be drawn upon the Place. The Armenians have this Lance in great Veneration, faying* that it was brought thither by St. Matthew. Five Leagues from Erivan, towards theSouth-Eaft, begins the Mountain Ararat ; which will be always famous for being the refting-place of NoaWs Ark. Half aLeauguefrom that Mountain, where the Plain begins to grow level, ftands a Church upon a little Hillock, clofe by which are feveral Pits like Wells. They report that it was into one of thefe Wells that Cerda, an Armenian King, caus’a St. Gregory to be thrown, becaufe he would not Worfttip his falfe Gods. Between this Church and£m^« are to be feen theRuines.of the Ancient the Seat of the Kings of Armenia, which demonftrate that it has been a great City: befides, there appear the Ruines of a fair Palace. Erivan lies in 64Degrees, 20 Minutes of Longitude*, 41 Degrees, 15 ML mites of Latitude *, in a moft plentiful Country of all things,neceffary for Humane Life, but efpecially abounding in good Wine. It is one of the beft Provinces of all Perfia, and yfelds the King a very large Revenue, as well by reafon of the goodnefs of the Soil, as for being the great Thoroughfare of the Caravans. The yearly Revenue of the Governour only, otherwife call’d the Kan of Erivan* amounts to above ,20000 Tomans, which make 840000 Livres. This City ly ing upon the Frontiers of both Empires, has been taken and retaken by ihcTarkt and Perfians, feveral times. By which means the old City being ruin’d, they have built a new one^ 800 Paces on this fide, upon a Rock, at the foot whereof, upon the Weft-fide runs a rapid Stream : it is call’d by the Name of Sangui*Ci]a, and in many places it is deep and full of Rocks. You crofs it, over a fair Bridge of three Arches, in which are built little Chambers, where the Kan retires in the heat of the day. It is full of Fifti, efpecially Trouts, which neverthelefs are dear enough. This River comes from a Lake called Gigaguni-, about 25 Leagues toward the North ?The Pe r si an ‘Travels Book 1. North, and falls into the Aras, that runs not above three Leagues off to the South Though this City be fortified to the Weft by the River,yet it is never the ftrongcr by reafon of the Hills on the other fide which command it: and in regard it is built upon a rock, the Moats of the Fort are not above threeor four Foot deep. f n fomirplaces the City isfecur’d With a double Wall with fevcral Towers 3 but the Walls bedog only of Earth, as arcmoft of the Houfes, the Rain does moremif- chief, than the Cannon would do. That part of Erivan to the North-Weft, i s l kind of Suburb, but far better inhabited then the City: for there live all the Mer chants and Artificers, together with the Chriftian Armenians^ who have four Churches there, with a Monaftery. And of late years they have built alfo a very f a j r Inn in the fame Quarter. In the City there only lives the Km, with the Military Officers and Sooldiers *, the Km\ Lodgings lying upon the River. The Governour is a Perfon of great Power, and has always fufficient Forces about him to guard the Frontiers. The Summer being very hot at Erivan, he lyes in Tents upon the Mountains during the Heat. When a arrives, he is forc’d to give the King advice thereof: and'ifany AmbafTador come thither, he is bound to maintain him at his own expence, and to caufe him to be conduced to the Territories of the next Governour, who is oblig’d to do the fame. So that Ambafladors are not bound to be at any Expenees in the Territories of the King of Etrfia. Four Leagues from the City are high Mountains, where the Natives that inhabit the hot and -Sun burnt Countries toward Chaldea, come Twenty Thoufand together, tofeekout good Pafturage for their Cattel^and about the end of Autumn return again into their own Country. I cannot compare this Mountanious Tra£I,whether for its Valleys 1 and Rivers, or for the nature of the Soil, to any Part that I have feen, better than to that proportion of Switzerland, which is call’d the Cemtry of Vanx : and there is a Tradition among the Natives, That certain people that inhabited between the and Mount and which compos'd a Squadron Alexander s Army, having ferv’d him in his Gonquefts, feated themfelves in this part of Armema^hkh they found fo like their own Country. From Tocat to Tatreis the Inhabitants are for the moftpart Chriftians. Which large Traft of Grouud being that which the Ancients call’d the Province of Armenia,^ no wonder to meet with fifty fiians for one Mahometan. There are many ancient rmenian Families in Erivan, Which is their native Country •, but they are well us’d by the Governours,who being far diftant from the Court, do what they pleafe. This City not being far remote from the Province from whence the Silks come, is the place where aJl the Buyers and Sellers refort. But neither in Erivan, nor in any other part of Terfia are the Merchants put to open their Bales at the Cuftom-Houfes, as in Turkic, They only pay certain Duties toward fecuring the Highways *, which Duties they call ries, and thofe thaegather them Raders. - % The Kans or Governours of Provinces in Perfia are civil to Strarigcrs, efpecially to thofe that they like, or that ffiew them any thing of Curiofity. The firft time that I went into Per/w I took a yourtg Watchmaker with me, and coming to Erivan, I carried him to the Kan who was then Governour. It was at a time when Watche? were very rare in Perfia', and the Kan, underftanding what Trade the Young Man was of, told us he iyas the firft Watch-maker that ever had been in Pcrfa : Thereupon he brought thkyoung man a Watch tomend, and that he might havef the pleafure of feeing him Work, he lodg’d us in a Chamber next his own, and made us drink with him every day; for he was a true Toper, and com- pell’d us to drink with him from four in the Afternoon ’till near Midnight, in a place which he had made on purpofe, in his Garden, to take off his Glaffes. This was he, that having deliver’d Erivan to went along with him to Conflantinople, and became his Favourite for teaching him to Drink. Amur at left a Garrifon of 22000 Men in the City; but Sha-Shefi the Perfian King begirt it prcfently with aftrong Army; and planting himfecurely uuder one of the Hills that command the City, he batter’d it inccffantly with eight Pieces of Cannon .* the fourth day he made a Breach, and though he had the repute of a Coward, he was the firft at the Affault, and took the City .* aru. jecaufe they would not yield at his Summons,he put all the Garrifon to the Sword.For which was quit with Sha- afterwards, though not in fo noble a way ; for enteringa Viftor into Baodat,\\Q put all the Perfhans to the Sword, after he had given them his',word to the contrary, and promis'd to fpare their lives.

A Continuation of the fame %ocul from Erivan to Tauris. T ufually takes up ten'Jays journey for the Caravan to go between Erivaa and Tauris-j and Nakfivan is almoft in the raid-way between both. The Ifirft days journey you travel through large Plains fow’d with Rice, and water’d with feveral Rivulets. The next day you contiue to Travel through Plains of the fame nature, in figh t of the Mountain which is full of Mona- fteries, leaving it upon the South. The call this Mountain The Mountain of the Ark\ becaufe the Ark of iV&lt;?^refted upon it. It is as it were unfaften’d from the other Mountains of Armenia^nd from the half-way to the top, it is continually cover’d with Snow. It is higher than any of the neighbouring Mountains; and irnhyfirft Travels I faw it for five days Journey together. So foon as'the Armenians, difeover it, they kifs the Earth, and lifting up their eyes to Heaven, fay their Prayers. Yet you are to take notice, that the Mountain is hid in Cloud* for two or three Months together: In thtf plains that you crofs in this fecond days journey, to the Southward a League and a half from the High way, is to be feen a work of great Art; being the Ruines of a Magnificent Caftle, where the Kings of Armenia were wont to refide in the time of their Hunting Divertifements*, more efpecially when they continu’d their fports at the Mallard and Heron.The next day we lodg’d neat to a Village whefe there was good Water, which conftrain'd the Caravan to flay there; there being none to be met with for ten Leagues farther. The next day you muft Travel one by one through the Pafs of a Mountain, and crofs a large River nam’d which falls into-^r^. It is fordable when it is low, but when the Snow melts and fwells the ftream, you muft go a League out ©f your way to the Southward to crofs it, over a Bridge of Stone. From thence you go to lodge near a Village call’d Kalifakjend, where yoii are forc’d to fetch your Water a good way off. The firft days journey is through a Plain, at the end whereof you meet with art Inn,call’d (landing upon a Rivulet; which was fimlh’d in 1664. The Head of this Rivulet fprings three or four Leagues higher toward the North} and half a League below Water congeals and petrifies; and dfthofe Stones is the Inn built. TheStorieis very flight; and when they have need of it, they make Trenches all along'the Stream, and fill them with the fame Water, which in eight or ten Months turns into Stone. The Water is very fweet, and has no bad taft ; yet the Country-men thereabouts will neither drink it, n(rpvater their Grounds with it. ThcArme^ nians fay, that Sem the Son of iV^Kus’d the Rock to be hollow’d, out of which this R iver ilfues; which four or five Leagues from its Head, and two from the Inn, falls wxoAifas. From this Inn to Nabsivan is but afmall Journey^ Naksivan 9 accordingaccording to the Opinion of the Anreniansy is the moft ancient City of the World- built about three Leagues from the Mountain upon which the Ark of refted’ from whence it alfo takes its Name for Nak in the Armenian Tongue fignifies a Ship, and Swan, rifling otrepoflng. ’Twas a great City, now wholly ruin’d by the Army ci Snltan Amurath. There are the Remams of feveral rare Mofquee?, which the Turks have deftroy’d*, for the and deftroy oneanothers Mofquecs as faft as they fall into one anothers pofleflion. This City is very ancient* and the report,that it was in this place where went to live, when he went out of the Ark. They fay further, that he was Buried here *, and that his Wife has a Tomb at upon the Road to 7 W;*. There runs a little River by Nahivan, the Water whereof is very good *, ,the Spring, whereof is not far diftant from the Head of the River of Karabagler. The Armenians drove a great Trade in Silk formerly in this Town, which is now very much abated: however^ there is a JGo* which has the Command there. All the Country between Erivm and Tauris was wholly deftroy’d by Sha-Abas King of T*erfla, and the firftofthat Name* to the end that the Armies of the not meeting with any fubfiftance, might perifh of themfelves. To.thispurpofe, he fent all the Inhabitants of Znlf* and the Parts adjoyning into Per//4, Old and Young, Fathers, Mothers, andChil, dren, with which he planted new Colonies in feveral parts of his Kingdome. He fent above 27000 Families of Armenians into GMilan, whence the Silks come * and where the harfhnefs of the Climate kill’d abundance of thofe poor people, that were accuftom’d to a milder Air. The moft confiderable were fent xojflahm, where the King put them upon the Trade of Silk, and lent them Commodities, for which they paid upon the return of their Markets, which fuddenly fet the tatnians upon their Feet again. Thefe are they that Bir t the City of Zulfa, which is only feparated fromby the River of calling \X.New Znlfa, to diftinguifh it from the old City, which was the Habitation of their Anceftors. A third part of the people were difpers’d into other Villages between Ifpahan and Sciras. But the old People dying, the young ones geRerally turn Mahumetans: fo that now you can hardly meet with two Chriftian in all thofe fair Plains, which their Fathers were fent to manure. Among the Ruines of Naksivan appear the Ruines of a great Mofquec, which Was one of tht moft ftately Buildings in the World: which fome fay was built in memory of Ntah’s Burying-placc. As you depart out of the City, near to the River that runs by it, appears a Tower, which is an excellent piece of Architetfttre; It is compos’d of four 3 )«Ws joyn’d together, which fupport a kind of a Pyramid, that feems to be fram'd of twelve little Towers * but toward the middle it changes its Bgure, and lelfening like a Spire, ends in a Point. The Building is all of Brick, but as well the out-fide as the in fide is over-fpread with a kind of Varnifti of Parget, wrought into Flowers, like EmbofsM work. Ti$ thought to have been an Edifice, fet up by Temur*leng when he had Conquer’d Perfia. between Naksivan and Zulfa, on each fide, as well to the North as to the South, there are ten Govents of Qht\ft\dx\ Armenians, diftant about two or three Leagues one from the other. They acknowledge the Pope, and are govern’d by certain Religious Dtfwwwdwj of their own Nation. And to keep up their Religion, they fend from time to time to Rome certain Children born in the Country, to karn the Latin and Tongues, and other neceflary Sciences. It is thought there are in this Quarter above fix thoufand Souls that abfolutely follow the Doftrine of the Church of Rome * only that they fing the Office and the Afafs in the Armenia Tongue, that all the People may hear and underhand them. The Archbifhop, being ohofen, is fent to Rome to be confirm'd. He refides at a great Town, which is one of the moft lovely places in all Afia * the Wine and Fruits that grow there are very delicate, befides the abundance of all other things necefiary for Humane Life. Every Covent ftands near a great Village: the chiefeft where I have been twice, hAw rener, the fecond Abraghonnex, the third Kerna, the fourth Soletak^, the fifth Kouchkachen, the fixth Giaouk, the feventh Chiabonnez, the eighth Araghowk, the ninth Kattzukj the tenth KifouJ^, which lyes upon the Frontiers of Curdifianoi Ajfyria: Here it is, that the Armenians believe St. Bartholomew and St. Matthffl to have been Martyr’d, of whichthey pretend to (hew fome Relicks at this day.

They alio live very auftere lives* feeding upon nothing but Herbs. That which makes them fo poor, is the often change of Tyrannical Governoufs, whom they are oblig’d to prefent with large Gifts But in regard they cannot give much, thofe Governours have no kindnefs for them ; for which rcafon, being inftigated b/thofe other who are able to oblige them, they ufc them fofeverely, tint they are often forc’d to complain to the King ^ which i have many times feen done at Isfahan. A League and a half from the chief of thefe Covents there is a high Mountain, feparated from all thcreft,which rifes like a Sugar loaf, as doth the Pike of a Tena- rijf. At the foot of this Mountain are certain Springs, that have the virtue to heal thofe that are bit by Serpents j in fo much that Serpents carry‘d to that place will dye immediately. When the Caravan is ready to fet out from Nathan for Zutpha, which is not above a days journey from thence, the principal ufually go out of the way to the Govent of St. Stephen, which lyes to the South. Now the Road from Naksivan to St. lyes firft to a great Village call’d EccUfia-) where live the richeft Armenians, that drive a great Trade in Silk, and have built them a very fair Church. Two Leagues from Ecdefia you muft crofs the River u 4 ra* \n a Ferry-Boat* being as it weie iqueez d between two Mountains in that place: Once I went over upon the Icc. About two Musket (hot from thence, (you muft crofs over a Bridge, another River that falls into the Aras, From the foot of the Bridge you begin to aicend a little Hill, at the top whereof you meet with a great Village,call’d Shambe', all the Inhab.tants whereof, as well Men as Women, grow Mad at 18 years 6f age; but it is fuch a madnefs that it is not miichievous. Some believe it to be the Punilhment of Heaven, for that their Forefathers in thefe Mountains perfeCuted St. Bartholomew and Afanhew. From hence to Stephens it is not abovea League, but the Way is very trdubfe- fom. Sc. Stephen’s is a Convent built not above 30 years ago* It ftandsupon the Mountains, in a barren place, and of difficult accefs. But the reafon why the Armenians chole that place before any othef, is becaufe that.St. Bartholomew and St. Matthew rmxd thither in the time of their Perfccution. They add, that St.Matthew did a Miracle in that place} for that there being no Water there before, he only (truck his (tick upon the Ground/ and prefently there arofeia Spring. This . pnng is about half a quarter of a League from the Convent, under a Vault with a good Door to it, to keep the Water from being wafted.The Armenians goto vifit this Spring in great Devotion, having laid the Water into the Covent with Pipe*.

Between eight and nine in the Morning the Clo th was laid *,before which time we faw abundance of the Neigh bouring Country people, w ho brought Wine, Fruits, and other Frovifions, and prflented all to the Archbifhop. While we were at Breakfaft news came that a certain Bimop was dead, in his return to the Three Churches •, whithei^hc was fent by the Patriarch to gather certain Duties due from the Villages. Immediately the Archbifhop rifing from the Table with all his Affiftants, and having made a Prayer for the Dead,fent aBifhopand fix Monks to fetch the Corps *, who returning a little after Midnight, the Body was iprefently laid in the Church upon a Carpet fpread upon the Ground, with the Face turn’d toward the Altar. In the mean time, a great number of Wax-candles were lighted, and all the reft of the Night two monks watch’d by turns to Pray for the Dead. Early in the Morning the Archbifhops,the Bi(hops,and all in Religion Orders, iaid the Office for the Dead, which lafted half an Hour; and at the end of the MaG they brought the Corps to the Altar, fo that they made the Feet of the Corps to touch it. Having fo done, they took off the Linn en Cloth that cover’d his Head, at which time the Archbifhop anointed him in fix places'with the Holy Oyl, faying certain Prayers every time.Then they cover’d him again,and faid other Buyers, which lafted half an Hour. Thefe Ceremonies perform’d, they carry’dthe Corps out of the Church with Crofles and Banners, and every one a Taper inhis Hand. As the Corps pafs’d by, one of the Bifbops put a Paper in his right hand, containing theie words, I came from the Father r and I return to the Father* Being brought to the Grave, upon a little Mountain near the Covent, and fet down,the? faid other Prayers which lafted a quarter of an hour. In the mean timeaBiftop going down into the Grave, took away all the Stones and made the place fmooth, after, .which the Corps was let down wrapt in a large Linnen Sheet. Then the Bifhop,' according to ther cuftom, rais’d his Head a little higher thanhisBody, turning his face to the Eaft. Which being done, the Archbifhop and AffifiaM took every one a handful of Earth, which the Archbifhop bleft, and givingit to the Bifhop, he ftrew’d it over the Body. Then the Bifhop coming out again, the Grave was fill’d up.

It carries no Boats till about two Leagues below, ( for upward it will hardly bear a piece of Timber ) and in regard the Country grows low and extends it felf into Plains, there is no fear of Rocks, the courfe of the Stream being very quiet. There was a fair Stone-Bridge, which Sha-Abas caus'd to be broken down, when he wholly deftroy’d the Town, that it might benh harbour for the Turks. Neither by the Ruines, nor by its Situation, doth it appear to have been a City of any ancient Beauty ; the Stones were clapt unskilfully together without Morter, fo that the Houfes were more like Caves than Houfes. The North-Weft fide was moft inhabited, there being nothing on the other fide worth taking notice of. The Lands about being very fertil, there are certain Families return’d, who live very quietly. Cogia Nazar, one of the chief Armenians that went out of Zulfa, growing rich by Trade, and being in great reputation with Sha-Abbas, and Sha-Sefi his SuccdTor, who made him Kelonter, or Chief Judge of the Armenian Nation, built two great Inns, for the Honour of his Country, in 'Znifa, upon each fide of the River one.

We left the Caravan, that takes the great Road, and never goes the other way, becaufe it is full ©f Rocks and Stones that fpoi! the hoofs of the Camels. However Iwas'willing to fee a new Country* which 1 {hail deferibe before I come to the great Road.

The next day, after we had kept along by the Banks of the &lt;fs 4 ras for five or fix Hours, we came to Aftabat, which lyes a League from the River, where we ftaid above two Days to divert our felves. This is but a little City, but a vjery neat one 9 where there are four Inns, and every Houfe has its Fountain. The great plenty of Water makes the City very fruitful in all things-, more especially in good Wine. This is the only Country in the World that produces the Ronas, for which there is a vaft utterance all over Perfia and India. The Ronas is a Root that grows in the Earth ftke Liquorice, and is not much bigger. The ufe of it is to dye Red, and this is that Red which gives that beautiful tin&amp;ure to all the Calicuts that come out of the Afov/ffs Country. Though the Roots which are pulPdoutof the Earth are . very long', yet they cut them into pieces not above as long as a Man’s Hand, for the better accommodation of Carriage. It is a wonderful thing to behold at Orrines whole Caravans laden with this Ronas, which they Ship off from thence to the Indies. 1 ' The Root is full of Joyce, and yields a very high Tin&amp;ure ^ for I remember that an Indian Veffei that was laden with it, being call away in the Road of Ormw, where the Bags of Ronas floated, the Sea look’d of a red colour for fcveral days. Departing from Aflabat, it behov’d us to provide our felves with Straw and Barley for ourHorfes, underftanding that we ffiould meet with none all that days journey. From thence we travelfd upon a defeent for an hour together to the River which we crofs’d in a Boat; and all the reft of the day we travel’d through Mountains, over Torrents and Stones. That Evening we lay upon the Bank of a fmall Stream. a The day following, after we had travel’d through a fpacious Valley for two or three hours, we afeended a high Mountain, at the top whereof we met with two or three pitiful Houfes, where we ftopt that day. The next, which was the fifth after, we left the Caravan, wz travel’d upon a C 2 defeeneIke Persian _ Book! defcent for two or three hours, till we came to a great Village neatly fituated where there grows excellent Fruit. There we repos’d for an hour or two ; and from thence we came to a great Stone-Bridcfon a River where there is no Water but when the Rains fall* It falls into the Lake Rcumi^ but the Water of the River is fo ibwr and ill tailed, efpecially when it is low, that it is not to be drunk. About a quarter of a League from the Bridge are three long Stones fet in the Ground like Pillars: the Natives fay that they were placed there for a Monument, inthefam e place where Detriits t\\e Son of Hyftafyes was elefted King bv the cunning of the Gentleman of his Horfe: froai whence to Tanris is but half a'League. The Mouru tains of the which we crofs’din this Road, andthofc which run along toward the ancient Parthians, are the moft fertii in all Perfia. They bear Corn and Fruit in abundance; for upon the high Mountains there are fair Plains fow’d with Wheat which are extraordinary fertii. The Springs which rife there, and Rains which fall give a frelher beauty and a higher tail to what grows there, more than inany other part of iV/* that wants Water *, and the produdls of thofe Fields are of a higher price. Now for the great Road. The having crofs’d the Stream where we left it) lodges the next.Night upon the Banks of v 4 n#,over which it ferries the next Mor ning. It does not go thorough Zulfa, though it be fo near it 5 becaufe that on the other fide of the City, there are three Leagues of Way very bad and unfre' quented. For which reafon you mufl leave Zulfa on the right hand, which is not much out of the way. After two hours travel you go by a Bridge which iscall’d Sugiac ; after which you come upon Heaths encompafs’d with high Rocks. All this days journey you meet with no Water, but only one little Fountain, and the Water is fo bad that the Bealls will hardly drink it. The day following you travel through an even Country, but very barren • where you meet with nothing but a forlorn Inn*, though it be a place where Coil has been bellow’d, and built all of Free-done, that was fetch’d a great wav off. The next Stage is Mar ante famous for the Burying-place of Neatis Wife. The Town is notverv big ; retobling rather a Thicket than a City : but the fituation is very pleafant, in the middle of a fertii Plain adorn’d with feveral well peopl’d Villages. This Plain does not extend above a League round about Mar ante , the Country beyond it being all oarren. However it is not altogether unprofitable; for being a continual d feeing for the Camels, which are there bred for the Caravani. Which is the reafon that there are lo many Camel-Maders at Sugiac and Mar ante who furmfti great part of the Road. At Mar ante you muft pay thirteen Abaffi's ot four Crowns for every Camel’s Load, for the fecurity of the Road. S Leaving Mar ante, you lodge the next night a League from Sonhiana in abuffiv Plain, where the Water is worth nothing •, alter you have travell’d a mix’d Country, barren enough, where you meet with but one Inn in a Valley : but it is a very ‘ ai . r , onc : Sofhtana is an indift'erent large City, which you cannot fee till you come T . • ltj b J [ eaf f ° f t , he , §reat nui:nber of Trees planted in the Streets and round about it, which makes it look rather like a Foreft than a City. . ^ nex ;,^y? which isulually the tenth days journey from Erivatt, the Caravan, haying crofs d fair, large and fertii Plains, arrives at Thofe Plains are water’d with ieyeral Streams that fall from the Median Mountains •, but the Water is not all ol the lame goodnefs, for there is feme which cannot be drunk. 3 r be ^- en S&lt; ’f fe&lt; V !n , d lyes a Hill, from whence you have t &amp; 0 V r ert ^ P,ainS V U r whlch theArnl y of Encamp’d, hk k ber ' c g d Tanm.

Some think; that Tauris was the ancient Ecbatane, the MarepoUt of the Empire of the Medes* It is at this day a gveat City and well peopl’d, as being the Mart for Turkic', CMujcovyi the Indies, and Perfia, There are an infinite number of Merchants, and vaft quantities of all forts of Merchandize: particularly of Silk,, which is brought out of the Province of GuiUn, and other places. There is a?fo a great; Trade for Elorfes, which are handfom ^nd cheap. Wine, Aqua vits, and indeed all forts of Provifions are cheap enough • and Money trolls about in that place more than in any other part of Afm. Many ^Armenian Families have got great Eftates thereby Trade, and underftand it better than the Perfians. A little River, the Water whereof is very good, runs through the middle of Tauris -Jfs call’d Sc/^&gt;z~ kaiej over which there are three Bridges to crofs from one part of the City to the other. . The moft part of the Buildings in Tauris are of Bricks bak’d in the Sun *, the Houfes not being above one or two Stories high at moft. The tops of theHoufes' are terralVd ‘ the Roofs within are vaulted, and plaifter’d with Earth mix’d with chopt Straw, which they whiten afterwards with Lime. In the year 1658 the City was almoft ruin’d by Sultan Jmurath , but it is ajmolf ajl rebuilt again. There are in it Bazars, or Market-houfes, which are well built, and roahy Inns vejy, commodious, two Srories high. The faireftis that of Mtrz.a-Sade Governourof the Province, who caus’d it to be built with a Market-houfe adjoyning, to which he has added a Mofquee and a Colledge, with good Revenues. The great Trade of renders it renown’d over all Afm : for it has a con tinual Traffick with Turks, Arabians, Georgians, Mengrelians, Perfiam , Indiansf Mufcovites, and Tartars. The Bazaars or Market-hogles, which are cover’d, are always full of Goods: for there are fome which are peculiar to the Handicraft- Trades •, the mpft part whereof are Smiths, fuch as make Saws,’ Axes,' Files, and Steels to ftrike Fire, with Tobacco-ftoppers belonging to them. Some there are that make Pad-locks: for the Faftern People fatten their Doors only with wooden Bolts. There are alfo Turners, that furnifti the neighbouring Parts with Spinning- Wheelsand Cradles: and fome Goldfmiths, that make trifles of Silver. But there is abundance of Silk-weavers that are Artifts, and work very neatly ° 7 and indeed there are more of thofe than of any other Trade. Here it is that they drefs the greateffi part of the Shagrin-Skins that are vended fo plentifully all over Per fa *, for there are none unlefs it be the Country-people, but wear Boots orShooesof Shagrin- Leather. This Leather is made either of the Hides of Horfes,, Afles, or Mules, a*d only of the hinder part of the Hide ; but the Afles Hide has the beft; grain. There are to be feen at Taurus, Ruines of the ftately Edifices round about the great Piaz.z.a, and the neighbouring parts: they have alfo let run to ruine four or five Mofquees of a prodigious height and bignefs. The mofl: magnificent and thebiggeft ftandsasyou go out of the Town, in the Road to Ifpahan. The Perfans will not come near it, but look upon it as defil’d, and a Mofquee of He- reticKs, in regard it was built by the Sounnis, or the followers of Omar. *Tisd vaft Structure fairly built, the Front whereof is fifty Paces broad, with an afeent of eight Steps. It is lin’d without with Brick-work varnifh’d with different Co lours; and adorn’d within with very fair Painting A Pantique, and abundance of Cifers ajid Letters in Gold and-Azure. Upon two fides of the Fore-front are reard two APmarets or Towers very high, but not very wide, yet with Stairs to go up to the top. They are lin’d with varnifh’d Brick-work, which is the ufual Ornament of the /V/JWz Buildings: and at the top (land two Cupola's, form’d like the Turbants which the Perfans wear. The Gate of the Mofquee is not above foup Foot wide, cut out of a great tranlparent white Stone, four asd twenty Foot high, «md twelve broad.. Entring at the Door of the Mofquee, you come intoa fpacious IlUomo, thirty fix Paces in Diameter, rais’d upon twelve Pillars within, and fup- ported by fixteen without, which Pillars are very high, and fix Foot fquare. Below there h a Baluftradeo’r Rails that run round about the Building, with Doors to go iV. ~ - J. ^ VThe Persian Travels Book! from one fide to the other: and the Foot of every Pillar, which .s of white Mmble, is hollow’d into little Niches equal with the Floor, where the People put their Shooes when they go farther to their Devotions. The infide of the Wal! s , s varnifh’d in Squares of ieveral Colours, with Flowers, Cifers, and M.on Letters intermix’d, and wrought in Embot’d work, fo well panted fo well gilded that it feems to be but one piece of Work, cut out with a pair of Sciffars. From this Duomo you pafs to another Idler, but more beautiful in its kind. The lower pait is of tranfparent white Stone, of the fame nature with that in the Front, cut in great Panes like a Door that never opens. This Duomo has no Pillars, but eight Foot high, it is all of white Marble, where are to be feen Stones of a prodigious length and bredth -. The infide of the Vault is a violet Enamel, painted with aU forts of Flowers in Flat-work, buttheoutfideof both the Duomo sis cover d with varnilh’d Brick-work, and Flowers enabofs’d ji la Morefqae. Upon the nrft the Flowers are black upon green, upon the fecond, white Stars upon black: which diverfity of Colours is very pleafingto the Eye. Near the Door out of which you enter into the lefier Duomo, on the left hand, Hands a Chair of Walnut-tree curioufly carv’d, and fatten’d to the Wall, itftands upon a Platform rais’d fix fteps high, without any Canopy. On the right hand Hands another Chair of the fame Wood, and an exquifite piece of Werkmanfhip ; with a kind of State over it 01 the fame Wood, fatten d to the a . There is a little Rail about it, and the Platform is four fteps high. On^ the South fide ot the Mofquee there are two white tranlparent Stones, which when the Sun (hines Upon them look red: And fometimes after the Sun is fet, you may read at thole Stones by the refte&amp;ionof the Sun beams. . ' r , Juft againft the Mofque^on the other fide is another Front, which is the only Remain of a ruin’d Building. It was the abode of the She dolman, or the Chief Prieft, There had been large Baths which belonged to it , but they are all deftroy’dy fome others there were of lefs note, which are not lookt after. In the great Piazza of Tanris ar\d in the parts adjoyning, ftands a fair Mofquee, aColiedge, and a Caftle, which fall to decay, thefe Buildings being forfakeny by reafon they were made ufe of by the Sounm's, which were followers of Onw.

' The Capuchins have a very convenient Houfe at Tauris •, for Mima-Ibrahim Go- Vernour of the Province, whole credit is equal to the Kan of Taunt &gt; which is the chiefeft Command in Per favours him very much with his proteftion. This Governour has made hirafelf very confiderabie at Court, and very much refpeacd by the King for his indefatigable pains, and his extraordinary agility in augmenting the King’s Revenue: having found out fuch ways for that purpofe, as never entred into the thoughts of any that preceded him in the the fame Employment. He is very curious to learn all the Noble Sciences, which is a quality very rare among the Per- fans : He alfo takes great delight in the Mathematicks and Philofophy, diicourfmg often with Gabriel de Chinon, Governour of the Capuchins Govent in Kauris. But the great defire which Mirz.a-Ibrahitnh^dy to have his two Sons taught by the fd Gabrielj was the chief motive that made him fo favourable to that Covent. He bought the Friers a place to build their Houfe, and liberally furnifti d them for the Expence of the Work* When the Sun fets and rifes, there are a certain Company of People, who are oblig’d to make a hideous noife with Drums and Trumpets in the Meidan, or great Piazza of the City. They ftand upon one fide of the Piazza in a Gallery fomewhat rais’d, which is a Cuftom obfe^v’d in all the Cities under the Per fan Government. As you go out of Tauris upon the North-fide, there is a Mountain cloie by? there being only the River between it. The name of it is Einali-Zeinali y and rot' merly there ftood upon the top of it a fair Hermitage of the Armenians, which t e Mahometans have converted into a Mofquee. At the bottom of the Mountain ftands a Fortrefs and a Mofquee, which they let go to mine, becaufe they were m by the Ottomans.

It is not certainly known who built thrs Tower, but the Arabian' Letters upon the Gate afford us lome reafon to conclude that it was a Mahometan flrudlure. In the year 1651 there happen’d a terrible Earthquake in 7 mrii and the parts thereabouts, by which many houfes were over turn’d, and this Tower then cleaving from the top to the bottom, a good part of it fell down, and filPd up the hollow withinTide.* Befides the little River that runs by Tanris, there is another bigger to be crofs’d about half a League from the *C ity, over which there is a very fair Stone-Bridge: Near to it Hands a Sepulcher, cover’d with a little where the lay that the Sifter of Iman Rina lyes interr’d *, and they have it in great veneration.The River that runs under the Bridge comes from the Mountains of the North,and falls into the Lake Roami, thirteen or fourteen Leagues from TWiR'They tall it &lt;Aggi- jfbu, or Bitter-water • for the Water is very bad, and without any Firti. The Lake which is fifteen Leagues in compafs, has the fame quality,the Water being blackifh: the Fifti that happen into it out of other Rivers that fall into it, prefently become blind, and in a (hort while are found dead by the Shoar. This Lake takes its name from a Province and a little City,which areboth call’d p€ww/,beir*gnot above Elevefr Leagues from In the middle of the Lake, upon the way that leads to a little City call’d Toko- riant, there is a little Hill that rifes infenfibly, the afeent whereof is very fraooth, and out of it there rife many little Springs. The farther they run from the Head, the wider grow the Streams. And the Earth which they water is of two diftinft qualities:, the firft Earth that is digg’d lerves to make: Lime: the next to that isa hollow fpungy Stone, th%is good for nothing: but under that again is a white tfanfparent Stone,which you may fee through as through Glaff,which being fmooth and polifh’d Terves to adorn the Houles.

Over all Peryw, efpecially itomtmrts to and from thence to youmeet every day with Inns at an equal diftance. The next day you defeend a Mountain, in very rugged and narrow way. At the foot of this Mountain there are two ways for the Merchants to choofe that will, go to Jfpahffl. They that will go the ordinary road and the direcT way throogh Kom ,«md Kachan, leave a Lake upon the left hand that parts the two Roads*, and they thatwill go through Ardevil and Casbin &gt; two other good Cities,leave the Lake upon the right hand, and coaft along by the fide of the Mountain.

This City is famous, as well for being the firft Market of Silks that come from GniUn^ from which it is not far off * as alio for the Sepulcher of 5 ^, the firft of that name. King of Perfia. The avenues to it are very pleafant, being as itwcrc Alleys of great Trees, which are call’d Tchinar, planted in a ftreight line, at a due diftaq^f.

There is but one which is handfom, at the end whereof is built the Armenian Church. A little River runs through the middled the City, which defeending from theneighbouringMountains runs from Eaftto Weft. It is by Induftry brought into many Cuts to water the Gardens, and in many places there arc very fair Trees planted,which are very delightful to the Sigh. The Meydan or Market-place is a very great one ; more long than round * where Hands a very fine Jnn, upon one fide, which the Kan caus’d to be built. There are fevcral others in feveral parts of the City, which have the Profpedl over feveral lovely Gardens, cfpecially that which belongs to the King ; to which you go through a long and (lately Walk of four rows of Tree?, at the end whereof fiaodi a large Gate that gives you entrance. Though the Country about Ardevikk proper to bear Vines, yet there are none thereabouts* nor is there any Wme made till about four or five Leagues from the City .The Armenians that dwell in the City are very well ftor'd with it; though there be no place in all Fer/ia, where there is fo much Caution toib^us’d, cither as tothe Importingit, or the Drinking it j both which muft be don&lt;i very privately : Whidh proceeds from the Superftition * the Ter pans having fo peculiar a veneration for that place,that they believe it a fin to fuffer Wine to be publickly drank therein.

The Caravan is ulually hve days between Ardeiul and Arm, between and between 7 V&lt;w and Casbin two more. Haifa League on this fide Taron you muft crofs a great River over a ttone Bridge, and half a League beyond you come to Kalkal, Arion is a little City* Taron and Kalkal are two great lowns; and there arc but thefe three places mail Perfiawhere there grow any Olives, or that they make any Oyl. Leaving Kalkal^ you travel ovey a Plain tor three hours,at the end whereofis a Way which you you cannot get over iiUefs than four hours. 1 he way is lb bad that the Horfes and Mules can hardly get up but for the Camels,they muft take the lower Road, which is alfo very tedious, and full of Stones,which the Torrents tumble down, and it is three or four Leagues about. When you are up, the Country is level, and you have not above three Leagues to Casbin. Casbin Ayes in 87 Degrees and 30 Minutes of Longitude, and 3 6 Degrees and 15 Minutes of Latitude. It is a great City, the Houles whereof are low and ill built *, except feven or eight, which are next to the King’s Gardens. It has na Walls* and indeed the beft half of the City is in Gardens. There are three Inns, with Market-places round about * one of the three being large and^ commodious. It is inhabited altogether by Mahometans or if there be any ChriHians, they are very few. , The Soil about Casbin produces Piftaches. The Tree that bears that is never bigger than a Walnut-tree of ten or twelve years om^ The great quantity of Pifta ches that are exported out of Perfia come from Malayert;&amp; little City twelve Leagues from Ifrahan , toward the Eaft. Thefe are the heft Piftaches in the World, and the Country being of a large extent, produces them in fuch abundance, that it furnilhes all Perjia and the Indies. Leaving Casbin, you come to a little Village where there is but one Inn • and you travel that day fix Leagues through Countries fertil enough, and well water’d. The next day you travel through a good Country, and in nine or ten hours you come to Denghe. This is a great Village at the foot of a Hall, through which there runs a fair River. It abounds with excellent both White and Claret Wine, where the Travellers take care to replenifti their Bottles. But generally they never lye here ; being defirous to go a League farther, for a good Inn’s fake, which makes it a handfom Stage.

In this City is one of the faireft Inns in all Pcy fitt* Two hours after you leave Miana, you rnuft crofs a River, over a fair Bridge which runs to decay ; the Arches whereof are hollow within *, it is built of Brick and Free-ftone, being near as long as Pont neuf in Pari*. This Bridge Hands almolt at the foot of a Mountain call’d Kaplenton. Sha-Jba* caus’d all the way to be Pav’d, becaufe the Land is fo fat and doughy, that when it thaws, or that the leaft Rain fails, it is impoflible for the Caravan to pafs. Befides, there are a fort of Caraels in Perfia, that when it comes to rain in a deep Soil, are not able to keep their Legs: nay through the weight of the Burthens which they carry,their very Qua- ter s wilt rive from their Shoulders, and their Bellies will burrt. So that before the way was pav’d, they were forc’d to fpread Carpets in the moft flippery ways where thofe Camels were to pafs: which cnuft be ftiil done in fome places, where the Pavement is worn away. u At the lower part of the defcent toward T/j^Wz, upon the knap of a Hill which Hands by it felf, appears an old forfak’n Fortrefs: it is near the Highway, and a River, which falls into the Cafpian Sea, after ithas crofs’d the Province of Gmlan{ where it is cut into feveral Chanels. But generally the Corn and Fruits which grow in Perfia by the help of Water forc’d into Chanels, are of little eHeem, and much cheaper than thofe that grow in the Provinces whole Fertility is not Arti ficial. Moreover, that fort of forc’d Grain will not keep above a Year; and if you keep it longer, it breeds a Vermin that eats it. ’Tis the fame thing if the Com be ground; and more than that, there breeds a Worm in the Flower, that makes it lb bitter that ’tis impoflible to eat it. On this fide the Mountain Kaplenton appear at a diflance two others very high, one toward the North call’d Saveland, another toward the South call’d Sehand : there is a third, which cannot be feen in//p^i^tf-Road, being two far but of the way, near the City of Hamadan. Thefe three Mountains are full of Springs, from whence moH of the Streams do fall that water Perfia ; And the Perfians do fay , that formerly there were many more of thefe Springs, but that about a hundred Years ago feveral of them have been dry’d up, or otnerwife no body can tell what is become of them. There are feveral Villages near the Mountain that pay nothing to the King, but are oblig’d to fend him a certain quantity of Rice and Butter, for the ufe of the Mofqaee at Arde 'ail. They have alfo one great Priviledge, That if a Man commits a Murther, and flyes to any of thefe Villages, he cannot be apprehended, nor can the King himfelf puniHi him. :i Leaving the River that runs at the foot of the Mountain Kaplenton, you come to a fair Inn call’d TJhamalava, built fome years ago : and for thirteen hours after, travelling over a very barren Country, you meet with another Inn, which is call’d Sartcham, Handing in a very defert place: which makes the iW*™, that lye there to fecure the Highways, very infolent, finding themfelves fo far from any Towns ot Villages. , From Samhamyou come to a River, by the Banks whereof you travel a good while, till you come to an Inn which is call’d Digbe, near a large Village. The Stru&amp;ure is very handfom, the lower part being of Free-flone undulated with red and white, and very hard. The nest day you travel a very uneven Country, till you fall into a deep Valley, at the end whereof you meet with Zangan, a great T own and ill built. How ever, it has a very fair Inn, which when I went IsH to Jfpahan was fo full, that I had like to have lain abroad in the Rain, but for the Courtefie of two tnenians. From you go to an Inn, where you muH pay the Duties due to the Kan of Sultanie. is a very large City, which you leave half a Mile from the Road, near to a Mountain. Formerly it had in it very beautiful Mojquees, as may be eafily conjcftur’d by the Ruines that remain. Many Chriftian Churches alfo were con., D 2 verted‘the Persian travels Book I. verted into Mofquees • and if you will believe the Armenians, they will tell you that there were in Sultanie near eight hundred Churches and Chapels. three Leagues from Sisltanie (lands an Inn, and a. League farther a great Town call’d Jja , where there is another very commodious Inn, and mod excellent Wine. / ' From thence you go to Habrtr, an ancient City and oi a lar^&gt;e extent* but very much ruin’d, inhabited by Armenians for the mod part: Here, for the good Wines fake the Travellers day to recruit their Bottles. From Habar, after feven hours travel you come to a Village call’d Vanin. Front Zan7an to Partin you reach in two days. It dands in a fertil Plain, where there are feverd other Villages. It is not above three Leagues broad, being enclos’d on each fide, to the EadandWed, with a row of high Mountains. Having pafs’d this Plain, you come to a barren Country and ill inhabited, which lads all the day, till you come to Saxava. You pafs by the Ruinesof a Village, where there are but two Houfes danding , with the Tower of a Mefqnee, which is very high and (lender. Then you come to a Mud-wall’d-Inn, built fome few years fince ^ and near to that a Cadle call’d Khiara, upon the peek of a Hill, but very ill built. , . / . . Sexava is a little City in a Soil that bears excellent Nuts. The Inns that are there being built of Earth, and being but little, are very handfomand covenient, their number fupplying the defedl ol their fmalnefs. From Sexava, after feven hours travel, you come to a great Inn, call’d Ugibu^, which was formerly a nobler place than now it is, danding alone in a Field. Three Leagues from thence you meet with another fpacious Inn, call’d Cochkeria-, and four hours farther you come to the Inn Denghe, where the two Roads meet which I fpake of in the foregoing Chapter. From itenghe to Kom are three days journey, over a barren, dry, and defert Country, where there is no Water but Cidern-water, except in fome very few places, where it is v6ry good. Four Leagues from Denghe is a fair Inn ; and three Leagues farther Hands another, about a Mile from a Village to the South, where there grows excellent good Wine, white and red. From this lad Inn to is not above three hours travel with the Caravan. Sava is a good City in a fertil Plain, where there are feveral Villages. The greated Trade of the Town is in little grey Lamb-skins, the curl whereof is very neat, of which they make Furrs. Two or three Leagues beyond Sava the Country is very well manur’d, and after you have forded a River half a League from the City, after two hours travel you come to one of the faired Inns in all which was finifli’d when I went lad to Jftahan. From thence to Kom it is about feven or eight hours journey, through a dry and fandy Road: but half a League on this fide Kom the Land is very good and fruitful. Kom is one of the great Cities of Terfia, in a fat Country abounding in Rice. There grow alfo excellent Fruits, particularly large and excellent Granates. The Walls are only of earth, with little Towers clofe one to another} and the Houfes being only of Earth, are never the handfomer withinTide. At the entry into the Town, youmuderofs a River, over a done Bridge, and then turning to the right hand over a fair Key, you come to an Inn very well built and very convenient. That which is mod remarkable in Kom is a large Mofqnee, no lefs in veneration a- mong the Perfians, than the Mofquee of Ardeiiil. There it is that you may fee the Se pulchers of Sha-Sefi and Sha-Abas the Second; as alfo the Tomb of Sidi-Fatima, the Daughter of Iman-Hocen, who was the Son of Hdy and Fatima-Zuhra the Daughter of Mahomet. The great Gate of the Mofquee anfwers to a Viaz.z.a more long than broad, where dands an Inn and certain Shops, which without-fide arefomewhat beautiful. One of the fides of the Piazza is clos’d up with a tow Wail, over which appears the Shore,and a River which you crofs at the end of the ‘Piaz.&amp;a-Ovex the great Portal of the Mofqaee (ta.nds an Infcription, in Letters of Gold, in the praife of Sha-Abas the Second. The fird place that you enter into is a Court ot more length than breadth, which may be term’d a Garden, in regard that on each fide of the Alley in the middle, which is pav’d, there arefeveral fquare Beds oi Flowers, yellow Jafmin, and other Plantsy which are rail’d in by a Rail that runs al the length of the Alley on each fide. It is not an eafie thing for the Chridians toChap. VI. of Mordieur Tavernier. . ' ' .'f-' . !■!*■■■ Ml get into this Court, efpecially fuchwhofe Habits and Afpe£l they do not Iike r : But as I cloth’d and carry'd my felf, I never was deny’d entrance into anyplace ei ther in Terfia or India. In this hrft Court on the left hand as you enter, are little Chambers, where they that receive the Alms, which by the Foundation of the Mofquee arc to be diftri- buted every day, come and eat their proportion, and then go their ways. Thofe Chambers ferve as an ftifylum to thofe that cannot pay their Debts, as at the Mofqne? of *Ardeiiil. Neither are thefe Priviledg’d places like ours, where they that retire muft live at their own Charge: For in Perfia they are fed at the expence of the Mofquce *, and being in that manner freed from Care, their Friends more eafdy bring their Creditors to Compofition, Out of the finl: Court you pafs into a fecond, which is larger, and all pav’d ‘ and from that into a third, which is fquare, and rais’d like a Terrafs. You enter into it through a large Gate, at the end of an open PafTage, where (land the Lodging of the Ado hH alos. Out of that Court by an afcent of Brickwork of ten or twelve Steps, you enter into a fair Court, which is alfo rais’d like a Terrafs; in the midft whereof is a fair Fountain. It is continually fill’d by little Pipes of Water which run into it, and is empty’d by others that carry the Water into feveral parts of the whole Endofurc. There are fome Buildings in this Court, but one of the Tides of it is taken up with the Front of the Mofqaee-, wdiich is no difpleafing Stru&amp;ure. There are three large Gates belong to it, very well expanded, according to the mode of the Country* with a Brick-wall before, about the height of a Man, with Holes in it for Light’ madelikeaLozange. The Threfhold of the middle Gate is cover’d with a plate of Silver 5 and between thefe three Gates and that of the c Duomo are feveral Do&amp;ors that hold Books in their hands, and read perpetually. This M&amp;fquee is Oaagonal, and at every angle is a fmall wooden Door of Walnut- tree, varnifh'd with grey and yellow. The Tomb of Sidi.Fatima is at the farther part of the CMofqiiee, there being only room for one Man to pafs between the Wail and the Tomb. It is encompafs’d with a large Silver Grate, fixteen Foot fquare* the Bars whereof are round, and knob’d in thofe places where they crofs each other * it is lighted by feveral Lamps of Gold and Silver: which altogether is very pfeafing to the Eye. The infide of the Mo/quee, to the elevation of the Angles that fupport the DuomO) is compos’d of fquare Tiles varnififd over with divers Colours *, and the Cuyola of the Duomo^ as alfo the Vault of the Portico of the Mofquee^ is a Morefco piece of Painting in Or and Azure. Upon each fide of the Mofquee, and near the fide where the Tomb of Sidi-Fatima (lands, appears a great Hall, where the Royal Alms are diftributed to the Poor, which confiftof Pilaw and other diet, very well dreft From this Tomb you turn to the left hand toward an Afcent, diftant five and twenty or thirty Paces; and at the top !of this Afcent is a Door, over which there is an In- fcription in Honour of Sha-Aba* the Second. The Door being open’d, (hews you the place where the Body of that King repofes: and through another Door with a Grate in it, you may difcover, under a fmall Buomo, the Tomb of Sha-Sefi his Father; which is cover’d with a Carpet of Cloth of Gold. They were conti nualiy at work upon the Tomb of Sha-Abas, which they laid, they woold make very famous. 3 I had not been two hours in Kom y but a multitude of People ran by the Inn Gate all in extraordinary haft. Asking what the matter was, they anfwer’d me, that it had been a day long defign’d for the two Prophets to fight. Therenpon I went was crow ^ e ^&gt; that I had much ado to get to fee. In the fiift place a fuffiaent number of Tumblers and Puppet players, divided into two Bands, kept the middle ol the Piazza, and made a fugicient Ring for the Combat. Each Band held a Bull by the Horns, one of which they call’d Mahomet, and the other Haiy : and whether it were by accident, or by the cunning of the Buif- Mafters, after an obftinate Combat, wherein the Beads foam’d again with heat and rage \ Mahomet at length quit the Field, and yielded Haly the Viaory. Then all the People (houted for joy, and ail the Piazza was fill’d with the noife of Mutes and Ha ytboys *, and every one coming as if it were t® adore Haly, cry’d out , Wor k* of fjod, that Haly hat made! At length they bring the Bull Haly unaer a Gate, with his Head turn’d toward the People *, where after theyThe Persian Travels Book I. have rub’d him to refrefh him, after a Combat fo courageoufly maintain’d, every one fends him Prefents, which arc all the Tumblers profit. The Kano* Governour of Kom, who was prefent with a hundred Horfes richly trap’d to behold the Sight, fent the Bull a Prefent of ^oTornans, or 750 Crowns. They who accompany’d him, and the chief Inhabitants of Kom , gave him fome a Garment, others a Girdle. Neither did the meaneft of the People fpare to fend or carry him Fruits, or ©ther^ things, according to their abilities. r , , , The Kan was a Lord who was very civil, and there was no Stranger that did not commend his behaviour, in regard he was fo obliging. ? So foon as I came to the place, whether it was that he perceiv d me with a Dutch man that I had brought along from Confiantino^le^ or whether any one had inform’d him that there were Strangers near him,he fent for us, and after he had ask’d us fome Oueftions concerning the occafion of our Travelling, he fent for a Seat and causd us to fit down. Then he ask’d us whence we came, and what we did at Iftahan • to which when we had anfwer’d him, that we went to wait upon the King, heap- proved our Intention, complaining that we had not given him advice of our Arrival. In the Evening he fent us fcveral Delicacies, among the reft, fix fair Melons, and four Bottles of excellent Wine. He appear’d to me fo brave and generous a Perfon, that I was very much trou bled afterwards for his being in dis favour with the King, and his death, which enfu’d. For this ^finding the Walls of the City, which were only of Earth, and the Bridge over the River to be out of repair, without writing to the King, of his own head, laid a flight Impofition upon every Basket of Fruit that was brought into the City. Now there arc in all the Cities of Terfia^ perfons who are bird to take an account every Week what the Commodities may be worth, and to take care that no more than fuch a Toll be laid upon any thing ^ which they tax among themfelves, and when they had fet the Rate, they caufe it to be cry’d at the beginning of every Week. Sha-Sefixhzn reign’d, it being the year 1632. The King being inform’d by thefe people of the Impoft which the Kan had fet upon Fruit without his knowledge, was fo engag’d againft him, that he caus’d him to be brought in Chains to Jfpahan, where he us’d him with a ftrange feverity. For at that time the Son of the Kan flood at the King’s Elbow, it being his Office to give him his Pipe and his Tobacco, which is a very honourable Employment m Perfia. When the Kan came, the King caus’d him to be carry’d to the Gate of the Palace, in the prefence of all the People, and then commanded his Son to pull the Hair of his Father’s Muftaches by the roots from his Skin. After that he commanded him to cut off his Nofe and his Ears; after that to put out his Eyes, and laftly to cut off his Head. When he had done the Execution according to the King’s pleafure, he commanded him to go and take poffeflion of his Fathers Government, and allowing him an experienc’d Old Man for his Lieutenant, he fent him to Kom with thefe words} If thou govern*]} no better than this dead Dog has done, I will fht thee to a more cruel Death than this. Leaving Kom, for four hours you travel over a fair Champain Country, after which you come to a fair Village with five or fix Inns in it. Beyond that is nothing but Sand, till you come to a place call’d Abfchirim, ot Frejh-water, where there are three Inns at a Diftance from any Villages. From Abfchirim to Cachan is fix hours journey through a Corn Country, and ftor’d with great Villages. Cachan is a large City, well peopl’d, and furnifh’d with all things neceffary for humane fubfiftance: There is an old Wall about it which is fain down in many places, fo that there is no need of feeking for Gates to get into the City. On that fide which looks toward Ifpahan the Soil is good, and produces great ftore of Fruit and Wine, which the Jews take care to make. It is reckon’d that there are in Cachan a thoufand Families of Jew* in Ifpahan about fix hundred ; but in Kom there are not above nine or ten. Not but that there arc many Jews in Perjia, but thole that live in Ifvahan, Cachan and Kom, boaft: themfeves particularly of the I ribe of Judah. T here are an abundance of Silk-Weavers in Chachan that are very good Woik- men, which make all the beft purfl’d Sattins mix’d with Gold and Silver, that come out of Perfia.

As well the Inn as the Gardens were made by the order of firft of that Name, who was at a vaft charge* The Inn. is above a hundred Paces fquare, built of Brick two Stories high, containing twenty r fix vaulted Chambers of a reafonable bigneis. It was a Structure too fair to be fo little regarded, as now it is, being much fain to decay. In the middle of the Court was a Fountain to receive Water, which is fpoil’d. The Perfians and Turk* are of that bad humor* rather to build new Houfcs than to repair old Buildings. , For which reafon they have ftnee built at Cachin four or five Inns, as fair and cotbmodious as that of Sha* Abas. This Cuftom is grown to that height, that the Children are fo far from taking care to repair the old Houfcs where their Parents liv’d, that they will not fo much as live in them after their deceafe, covetous of the honour of building Houfes for thcmfelves. T \ , : r 1 •- • y Before we leuve Cachan you muft take notice, that as you are to travel from that City to 6 ttiUnj}ox\ cannot avoid travelling thorough Plains for twelve hours together* which are all pure Saif, and there is nothing to be met with by the way, but one Ciftern ; nor can the Water which is in it be otherwife than very bad. , , Leaving Cachan y you crofs a Plain of three Leagues, after which you enter in among the Mountains, where you come to a very fair Inn of Brick. From thence you defeend a pleafant Vale, where you travel a long time by the fide of a Ri ver, over a very narrow way. At the end of the Valley you meet a great Wall, which croftes it, and joyns the two Mountains together. This Wall is above a hundred Paces long, above thirty Foot thick, and fifty high. It was the Work^of the Great Sha-Abasy whole defign it was to ftop the Waters that fall from the Mountain, and to make a Receptacle for Water in that place, to ferve his occafions. At the foot of the Wall there is a ; Sfuce, which being let down keeps in the Water*, but is pull’d up to let out the Water over all the neighbouring Lands to the Plain of Cachav. From this Receptacle to Cor on is about two hours travel. - : . Coron is a very large Village, and well peopl’d, in a Soil environ’d with high Mountains,, and planted with great ftore of Walnut-trees* The Houfes confift but of one low Story, being built of Flint-ftone *, but the Inn therein is very fair and commodious. This Village confifts but of one Street, but it is almoft half a League long, and very troublefom in the Winter, by r'eafon of d great River that runs through it. and the great quantity of Stones that lye in the way. All about this Village, as in feveral other places of Perfidy there, are a great number of Sha~ sales y which are a kind of Foxes* that in the night time make an ugly noife *, for if but one cry, all the reft will make anfwer, and fet up a howling. From Corow you muft travel three Leagues between Mountains, after which you have but twelve Leagues to Ifp ah an. It is a continued Plain that extends it felf beyond the City, and in many places the Soil is very good. At every three Leagues end you meet with Inns. The firft is call’d Achaha-AcacamaU * the fecond, which is the half-wav between CoroH and Ifpahany is call’d Miphiaconr. This place confifts riot only of one Inn, for there are many others, fo that it refembles a large Vil lage. From Michiacour you come to Aganwray another Inn, but ill built; and from Agarmra, after you have travePd three Leagues through a Fit and fertil Country you eome to Ijpakan.

The Turks have almoft quite deftroy’d it: making ufe of the Stones to build a For t two Leagues from the City, upon the Gulf, where the pafifage is very narrow y which the Ships are forc’d to fa lute as they inter in, and to-fpeak with when they fail out. Moreover that they might not be put to fend for Stones a-far-off, they eonfulted whether they mightnot make ufe p( the Stores of theChriftians Monuments, as alfoof thofe of the Jw, which are near the Shore: But they took very few, whether out of kindnefato the Tombs, or whether they did not think them fo proper for ufe as the Stones of the Amphitheater. This Cafile had not been long built, but upon an occafion very remarkable. In the laft Wars of the T arks with the Venetians, the Ottoman Fleet having been beaten in the Archipelago, the Grand Signer refoiv’d to refit another to Sea, and thereupon fent to all the parts of his Empire, where he knew any Englifh or Holland Veflels ufually were wont to ride, to follicit them to ferve him lor his Pay. More particularly he aim’d at thofe Veifels whichf were in Smyrna, where there were generally more than in any other Port. But the Captains, who reje&amp;ed his Propofition of fighting againft Cut Venetians^ believing that he would put fome force upon them, fudctenly hois’d Sail and got away ; it being at a time when he could not keep them in, having no'Caftle then built to command them; The Grand nettl’d at the.refufaLof the Captains, as an affront done to his ^ . an&lt; ^ t0 i^ ce ^hat the Ships could come in and go out, without any let or ttioieftation, bethought himfelf (to the end he might keep them for the future under;' iubjeftion ) of building a Fort upon the Gul^ in fuch a part where the Veffels mull ncceflarily touch; where now there lye great Cannons level with the Water, which ho VelTel can efcape. Ever fince the Convoys will not come to Smyrna^ as they were wonttodo, but lye out at Sea, out of the reach of the Fort. . Near to the Sea are yet to be fe.n fome Remains of a Church, two fides whereof leem tohave been diftinguifli'd into Chappels by little Walls, which are yet ftanding: cut the Natives doubt whether they be the Ruines of a Church dedicated to St. Toly sarpi or of an ancient Temple of J anuji - haS bcen oftcmiraes * u[n ’d either by the Wars, or by the Earthquakes r i C happen there. One time that I (laid there, there happen’d one, which 01a not lilt long, but was very terrible. About fixty Paces from the Sea arc to be i cern the Ruines of great Walls two Foot under Water; and at the end of the City. Chap. VII. of Monfieur Tavernier. City that locks toward the Winter-Weft, near to the Sea, appear the Ruines of a Mole, and certain ancient Magazines., The Engkfk Merchants have ciig’d among .the Ruines of Smyrna^ and have found great (lore of fair Statues, which they tranfported into their own Country. There are ftiil found fome or other every day •, but when the Tnrks find any, they disfigure them prefently. It may beconjedur’d, that there was one of a prodigious bignefs, by a great Toe broken off of fomc one, arid for which I paid fufficiently, out of the defire I had to buy it. 1 fent itto Paris to a Perfori of Quality, who look'd upon it as a great Curiofity. This Toe was of a hard white Stone, and well fhap’d, and by the proportion whereof, the Figure could not be judg'd to be lefs than the Coloffus of Rhodes. Upon that fide of the City where the Mole was, ftarids an old Caftle of no defence, at the foot whereof the Sea makes a fmall Creek, where fometimes the Galliesof the Grand lye. . The City is well peopl'd containing no lefs than fodrfcore and ten thoufand Souls. There are reckon’d no lefs than 60000 Turks, 15000 Greeks, 8000 Armenians, and about fix or feven thoufand Jews. As for the European Chriftians that Trade there^ their number is very fmall. Every one of thefe Nations has the exercife of their Religion free to themfeives. The Turks have in Smyrna fifteen Mofqaees, the Jews feven Synagogues, the ^Armenians but one Church, the Greeks two, and the Latinei three. There are alfo French Jefuits, and Italian Obfervantins, or a fort of Grey Francifcans. The Turkl, the Greeks, the Armenians, and Jews live upon the Hill; but allthe lower part toward the Seals inhabited only by the Chriftians, Enotijh, French, Hollanders, and Italians. The Greeks have alfo in the fame Quar ter' an old Church, and fome few fmall Houfes, where Sea-men make merry. All thefe different People of Europe are geherally known in Smyrna by the Name of Franks. Every Nation has its and the French Confttl has two Fice-Cohfuls under him *, the one at Scalanova, the other at Chio. Scalanova, or the New Port, is two Leagues beyond Epheftu, and being a good Haven, the Veffels were wont to unlade there *, but the Turks would not permit it any longer. For that Place being the Dowry of the Grand Signor's Mother, the F/Ve-Gw/a/agreed with the Governour of Scalanova, who permitted the Tranfpoi*- tation of Goods to Smyrna, which is not above three little days journey with the earavan : A thing that fpoii’d the Trade of the City, and injur’d the Officers of the Cuftom-Houfe. Whereupon they Petition’d the Grand Signor that no more Goods might be unladed at Scalanova : fo that now no more Veffels go thither, unlefs it be to take in frefh Vi&amp;uals. Chio is one of the greateft Iflarids in the Archipelago, of which in another place : but tbe Fice-Confd that lives there has no more bufinefs there than the other at Scalanova', for the Veffels that touch there, neither unlade not export any Goods! from thence. The Quarter of the Franks is only a long Street, one fide whereof lyes ripon the Sea •, and as well for the Profpeft, as for the convenience of Unlading Goods, the Houfes upon the Sea are much dearer than thofe that lye upon the Hill. The Soil about Smyrna is and abounds in all things neceffary for humane fupport *, but particularly in good Oyl and good Wine. There are Salt-Pits alto half a League from the City, toward the North. The Sea affords great ftoreof good Fowl is very cheap *, and in a word, S»*ymus a place of great plenty. There is a lovely Walk all along the Sea to the Salt Pits, where generally abundance of People walk in the Summer-time to take the frefh Air : and there being more liberty at Smyrna than in any other part of Turkic, there is no neceffity of taking a Janifary along, when a man goes abroad. If a man loves Fowling, it is but taking a Boat, which lands him two or three Leagues from the City, toward the Mountains, where there is fo much Game that he can never return empty. For the value of three Sous you may buy a red Partridge at Smyrna, and all other Fowl is proportionably cheap. j But if Smyrna have thefe great advantages, it has alfo its inconveniences: the Heats are very exceffive in Summer, and indeed they would be infupportable, were it not for the Breezes that come off the Sea: thefe Breezes rife about ten in the Morning, and continue till the Evening *, but if they fail, ? tis very bad for the E Inha- ' -i V‘The Persian Travels Book!. Inhabitants. Befides, there hardly paffes a Year but the City is infefted withtta Plague, which however is notio violent as in Chriftendom. The Turks neither fear it nor die it, believing altogether in Predeftination. Yet I believe, if the Inha bitants of Smyrna would take care to drain away the Banding Puddles that gather in the Winter about the City, they &lt;jrould not be fo frequently molefted with the Plague as they are. It is moft rife in May-, Junr, and July 3 but the malignant Fevers that iucceed it in September and Ottober are more to be fear’d, more People dying of them than of the Peftilence. In all my Travels I never was in Smyrna at thcfe unfortunate Seafons. There is no Bajha in that City } it being govern d only by a Cady, who is not. fo ievere to the Chriftians as in other places: For fhould he abufe his Office, Conftantinople is at hand, where you may complain to the Mifti, and have relief; who for fome good Prefent may be eafily perfwaded to depole the Cady, as being glad of the opportunity to difplace him, and to put another in his room. . • ; TheCuftoms of Smyrna yield a^rcat Revenue to the Grand being paid there very exa&amp;ly. But were there a certain Rate put upon Commodities, the Mer chants, who Would otherwife be lolers, would not ftudy fo many ways as they do to deceive the Cuftomers: For thofe Cuftomers lay what Price they pleafe upon Com&lt; modities, valuing that at a thoufand Crowns, which perhaps is not worth three hun- dred, being abfolute Mafters of the Rate. In my laft Voyage to Smyrna, four Butch Women that went thither in our Ship from their own Country, carry’d a-fhoar under their Coats whatever I had of rich Merchandize: for the Turks have fuch a refpeft for that Sex, that they will not fomuch as offer to fearch them. If a man be tak’n in ftealing Cuftoms, thefe is no other punilhment than to pay double. The Trade of Smyrna is very great, and the principal Merchandizes which the Tranks tranfport from thence, are raw Silk, which the Armenians bring out of Terfia •, Chamlet-yarn, and Chamlct or Goats-hair, which come from a little City call'd Angonri, fifteen or fixteen days journey from Smyrna, Cotton twilled; Skins and Cordovans of leveral colours ; Calicuts, white and blew *, great quantities of Wool for Mattrefies, Tap’ftries, quilted Coverlets, Soap, Rhubarb, Galls, Va- lanede, Scammony, and Opium-, which four laft Commodities are to be had in the Countries near to Smyrna, but not in great quantities. The Caravans come generally to this Town in the Months of February, June, and Otfober ; and depart again to the Countries from whence they came the fame Months. Ephefus not being above a day and a halfs journey from Smyrna, on Horfe-back- I took an opportunity to go thither. There were twelve of us that joyn’d together, Franks Hollanders, who took three along with us, and three Horfes to carry our Provifion. We travel’d this little Journey in the Summer, and fetting out of Smyrna about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, we rode through a Country part Plains, and part Hills, till we came to a great Village, where we fup’d. After we had ftaid there three hours, we took Horfe and travel’d till Midnight, to avoid the Heats: By the way we met with nine or ten Arches, very narrow^ which we could not conjedlure to be any thing elfe than the Ruines of fomcAque- dua. From thence to Fphefus the way is very pleafant, through little Thickets watred with Rivulets. A quarter of a League from Fphefas you meet with another CMofquee, which was formerly a Chriftian Church, built out of the Ruines of the Temple of Fpheftu. 1 his Mefcjuee ftands enclos’d with Walls,and you muft afeend up to it by two Afcenti of twelve Steps a-piece, which bring you to a'large Paffage. From thence you enter into a large Cloyfter, the Arches whereof are fufta'in’d with Marble Pillars of feveral colours, delicately wrought ^ and the lower part of the Gallery, which runs along three of the fides, that confifts of great Squares of Stone. The Mfquee takes up the fourth fide upon the left hand, the Gate being in the middle. The Mofquee itfelf is a wide Arch, fupported by five Columns, all of moft exquifite Work. There are four of Marble, and every one of a different Colour; but the fifth is a mod: rare piece, being of Porphyry, aed the bignefs of it makes it fo much the more to be admir’d. Ephefus does not look like a City, being fo abfolutely ruin’d, that there is not * Houfe Handing, It was built upon the defeent of a Hill, in a fituation not much unlikeok Wii .

The City feems to have been very large for you may difeern upon the top of the Gates the compafs of thfc Walls, with fevers! fquare Towers, fome of which are ftill landing : and there is one very remarkable having two Chambers in ir, one of which is a very fair one, the Walls and Pave ment whereof are Marble. &lt; , ; . : . The famous Temple of Diana Hood at the bottom of the Hill near one of ti e Gates of the City; There remains nothing .of it at prefent but the great Portal, which is entire. The Vaults of the Arches under grounditand to this day,and are very large bat all full of naftiriefs. We went in with Lanthorns; and though you tnuft creep to ? get in, by realon that the Wind has almoft ftopt up the . Hole, by gathering the Pull about it, yet when you are in, you njay go upright i for the Arches are high and fair, and little the work. Near the Gate lye four or five Columns upon' the Ground, «nd near to that a Fountain^ ten Foot in Diameter, and two deep The People of the Country report, that it was the Fountain wherein St Tofo*' Baptiz’d the Chriftians. For my part, as 1 have feen in the Mies feveral Pa&lt;ibd, and Edifices much more beautiful than ever the Temple oi.Epbcfiis could be • f believe it rather to have been a Bafin wherein the People put their Offerings of which there are feveral fuch that belong to the The Greeks and Arme- nimss, but above all the Prmki, when they go to Efbefm always endeavour toi break off fome piece of that Bafin, to carry it away with’em as a Relick- but the Stone is fp hard, that they can break off but very little at a time. . Not far from the Temple appears another Gate of the City,' over which there lyes a great Stone feven or eight Foot fquare, with an embofsfd Figure of 3 Curtius that Famous .Roman ,who threw himielf, Horfe and Arims into the eapfirS F-rrh for the good of Ms Country, Many Merchants have offer'd Money for liberty to carry it away, but cannot obtain leave. About five hundred Paces from EMm is the Grotto which they call the Seven Sleepers, at the bottom of the fame Hill where the City was built. , •• .. . : v _ . ; - trom Efheffis we went to Skahnov^ which is not. above two Leagues off that time you come half the way, the little River that runs by falls into the Sea, m the mouth whereof there are always a great number of GW Barks filhin* for Sturgeon. Of the Spawn of this Filh they make Cave are, and drive a great' Trade in it m thofe Parts: then they take the molt delicate and fmalleft Entrails of that hlh, which they fill with the fame Spawn, of which they make a kind of aflat Pudding, as long as a Bisket, which they call Botargo. This they dry in the Smoair and cut it afterwards in dices to cat. Upon this and the Cuttle-fifh the Pc- netwy feed during their Lent, which is very aufeere. f a Port of which I have already fpoken , and thither we came by ieyen a Clock.in the Evening .. where the Gpvcrnour of the Place, .more civil thin uiually the Turks areaccuftPmd to be, made us very welconl. In the Evening one of. our Janmearies had quarrel’d with one of our Servants who thereupon had beaten him, and therefore he complain'd to the Fellow’s uZ fter, who not giving him that iatisfadion which he defir’d, thereupon the Turk ftudy d to be reveng d upon the whole Company. For this reafon, upon feme pre- ttna-orother, he went before, the better to bring about his defign. We ftafef till tne Morning, and then departed early from Scalamva, and by Nooti we came with_good Stomachs to the Mofcjnee neat Epbeftes ,where we had been the day before • And lome of the Company thought it a very convenient place to dine in, i’the w er f Upon for our Provifions, with a Boracho of Wine, and ano- .mw hsrm ^ u/ ea tj n g m the Paffagc into the Mofquec, not dreaming f m ' , W j bad not ocen long at it, when we perceiv’d two or three Turks lL^™ tW ,, 0 ,?

Chrijhnn TDogs^ cry 5 d tfceyj when they came near us, to eat And drink, in a Mofquee, and profnne a holy place as you do, at a time that renders the offence more criminal! No, cry’d 1 , aniwering for the reft, we drink no Wine, we drink, nothing hut Water, and you may tajl it, faid I to him that was the moft bufie; with that I caus’d a Glafs to be pour’d out and givhhimy and I gave one of the Turk* a private wink, who underftanding it was apromife of gratuity, turn’d about to his Comrades, and cry’d, 'Tis 'very true, they drink no Wine. However in regard they had Orders to bring us before the Cady, there was no contending. Thereupon I and three others undertook to anfwer for all the reft. The Cady revil’d us as bad as the Janifary at firft • but he was not only furpriz’d, but vOjry much troubl’d, when they all unanimouOy affirm’d that we drank no Wine, believing they were confederates with us. But I had cunningly dipt eight Ducats into the Hand cf the Turk, to whdtn I had made afign with my Eye, who over-joy’d at fo plentiful a gratuity, had over perfwaded his Comrades not to fay anything againft us. The Cady, though he did not like their Teftimony, yet call’d forC^e for us, according to the cuftom of the Country, and Pent us to his Lieutenant *, who having been often greas’d in the Fift by the Smyrna. Merchants, receiv’d us very kindly, and told us that the Cady was but newly come to his Place, and was needy; however a fmall matter would content him. There upon we gave the Lieutenant twenty-five Ducats, who moft certainly went Inips with the Cady, and fo return’d us to our Company, who were much afraid we would not have come off fo. W e were rcfolv’d to return to Smyrna not the fame way we came, and fo we took another Road, which was a very pleafant wayj partly over firm Sands, and partly thorough Meadows, where we met with feveral narrow Dikes very well Pav’d* Then we crofs a rugged high Mountain, and lay in a Mahumetan Barn. The ftext day we return’d to Smyrna, having finifh’d our fmall Journey to £phe\ta in five days. When we told the Consuls how the faniz.ary had betray’d us, they made their Complaint to the Janizary Aga and the Cady, who, for his punilhment put him out of the ConfitTs fervice, which is an advantageous Employment. For befides that the are exempt from the Duties of War, they are well plac’d •, for there is never a Merchant that is not beneficial to them fome way or other; efpeciaily at good times, as New-years-day and other Feftivals. Nor could the Janizary have been more feverely punifti’d; for the Turks love Money above all things in the World. But to return to our matter. The Rendezvouz of all the Caravans is generally two Leagues from the City, near a Town call’d Pongarbachi. The day of their fetting out being fix’d, every one provides himfelf for his Journey, and meets the Evening before at the place appointed, to be ready at the hour. ^ From to Toc^r, is thirty-five days journey with the Caravan, and thelaft time I went we made it thirty^eight from Pongarbachi. The firft day we travel’d eight hours through a Country wht&gt;fe profpeft was not unpleafing, leaving fome Villages more than a League from the Road; and we lodg’d in a Park, near the River Pattolus ; which is a fmall River, the Sand whereof fhines, and is of feveral colours. Which caus’d Antiquity to call Golden- Sanded. It falls from the Mountain Tmoltu, and after it has water’d the Territory of Sardis, mixes with the River Hermus, that throws it felf into the Archipelago through the Gulph of Smyrna. The Mouth of it is not above two or three Leagues from the City, toward the North. The next day in fix hours we came to Burgout, a little City in a Plain. AH Chriftians that live not in the Territories of the Grand Signor, and pais that way, once a Year pay or a Tribute of four or five Crowns: butthePw^fare exempt, both at Burgout and over all Turkic. There refides a Bajha in this City y and we were conftrain’d to flop there a whole day* becaufe the Caravan that comes from Perfia arriv’d at that time, fo that they were forc’d to change their Camels.

In the Morning we pafs’d over the Ruines of the ancient Sard#, the Capital City of Lydia, and Seat of Kins Crafm. There were ftill to be feen the Ruines of a large Palace and two fair Churches, with a great number of Pillars and Corniches of Marble. This City having held out fix Years againfl: the Army of 7 inmr-kng, whobefiegd if ib foonas he had taken it, in revenge he utterly deftroy’d it. There is a Village near Sander of the fame Name, where Hood the City, which was one ol the Seven Churches mention’d in the Revelation. The fifth day we rode for leven hour 4 through a Country, but ill manur’d, and took up out Stage in a Flam upon the fide of' River* ’ The fixth day we paiVd by the Walls of the ancient Philadelphia, call’d atprefent AlUchars, which was alfo one of the Seven Churches of Afia. There is fomething of Beauty ftill remaining in thofc Walls, and the City is very large, but ill peopl d* It is fituated upon four little Hills, at the foot of a high Mountain overlooking a fair Plain to the North, that produces excellent Fruit. To witnefs its Antiquity, there is yet the Ruines of an Amphitheater, with certain Sepulchers* from whence the Inhabitants report that the Chriftians took out the Bodies that were buried there, and tranfported them into Enrobe, believing them to be the Bodies Of Saints. It is now all deftroy’d, but re-built of Earth by the after their mode. It was formerly one of the principal Cities of Myfia, and in regard it was alway very fubjeft to Earthquakes, the moft part of her Inhabitants liv’d in the Country. I he laft time I travelM that way, in the year 1664, the feventeenth of jHnc, t\itTurk£ were feafting and rejoycing upon the News, as they faid, which they had receiv d* of the defeat of the Chriftians in Candy. But the News was falfe, and only con triv’d to encourage the People ; for the Grand Signor was then making Levies in thofe Parts. We lodg’d that day, after feven hours travel, rtpon the Bank of a fmall River, a League and a half from Philadelphia, The feventh day we travelM eleven hours over a Mountain, where thole Frees plentifully grow that bear Galls, and Valanede, Which is the fhell or find of an Acorn, that Curriers make ufc of to drefs their Leather. We lodg’d in a Meadow on the top of a Mountain which is call’d Jjagli-bogafe, or, The Mountain cf Robbers. . The eighth day we continu’d our Journey over the fame Mountain, which 1$ a very bafren Country where there is no Provifion to be had. We travel’d but fix hours, and lodg d near a River in a Plain call’d Sarroacabaqui. ^ The ninth day the Caravan travel’d thorough dry Lands, where there is not one Village to be feen, and lodg’d near a bridge built over a River call’d Copli-fon, m the Plain of InahL , , . , The tenth day, after we had tf avel’d eight hours over an unfcven and barren Coun try, we ftopt in a Valley near a River call’d Bana-foH, the Water whereof is not good. In the Night there arofe a Tempeft that put us all in a diforder, and the Rain that fell was as cold as if it had been in the depth of Winter. We were Wet to the Skins, and were forc’d to tjirow Coverlets over the Bales to keep the Goods from being fpoyl’d. , . The eleventh day We travelM through a pleafant Country, between Vales adorn a with a moft delightful Verdure ; and we were in view as we pafs d along of certain hot Baths, though very little regarded. We lodg’d upon the Banks of a fmall River, by the fide whereof we had travelM for fome hours. The twelfth day we continu’d our Road for fix hours between the fame Vallies, and lodg’d by a River. , The thirteenth day, we traveiM eight hours* and ftopM near to a Village in a Country call’d Doiigaflh. c j 1 • - The fourteenth, after a Jdurney of feven hours we pafs’d by the Walls of Carajfar, that is, The BlackCity of Aphiom or Opium • becaufe it has a Proipett over a fair and large Country well cultivated, where they fow great ftore ot Pop pies, whence they draw their Opium or Aphiom, as the 7 urks call it. . - Aphiom-Carajfar, is a great City, dirty and ill built, the ancient Name whereof I could never learn, for the Greeks and Armenians are very ignorant. But ac cording to all probability and the fituation of the place, it ought to be the anaent Hierapolis fituated upon the Maunder , a famous River of the Leuer Afia, thatThe Persian Travels Book? ■ - * ■“ —■— — ——- __ t i • winds and turns t*ne moft of any Rivfir in the World. And inde^wTarTth more to feek, in regard the TWi?* change the ancient Names according to their ov? 2 euftom and pleaiuve, and give no other Names to Rivers than that of the princi ! City through which they pafs; or eife deriving their Names from the Colour! their Sands, There is to be teen in that City an ancient Caftle of Free-ft 0 nc ud° the Point of a high Rock, feparated from the Mountains that are next it towd the South, which make a Semicircle. All the Armenian Chriftians, Subjefts to th King of palling thorough Aphiom Car afar muft there pay Carr age, from which ' they are not exempted, though they have paid it before at Erzerom or elfewher The Caravan does not flop at Aphiom far afar, as well for that there arc no Inns bT what are ruin’d, as for that about a League farther there is a place where you ha- excellent Fifb, and very cheap, and they of the City bring Barley, Straw, and other things which the Caravan wants. The Caravan thcxcioxo. that day lodgesmjn the Banks of Maunder, which is to becrofs’d over a Bridge not far diftant from a fmail Village. In this River are great ftore of Crawfifh and Carps *, and the Fifter tnen will be lure to attend upon the Caravan, I have ieen fome Carps there above three Foot long. The fifteenth our Caravan began to part it felf, fome for Tocat, fqme for the Rond to Aleppo the one part taking the right* hand Road toward the Winter-Eaft for y the other the left-hand Road North-Eaft, for 5 After we were parted, we travel’d two or three hours in fight t&gt;f one another They that go to Aleppo, fall into Tarfus, where St. Paul was born, and from Tarjtu io AUxandretta, But we continu’d our Road to Tocat, and after we had crol's’d a great Plain, having travd’d fix hours, we lodg’d in a Merfhy place near a final Village. There is one thing remarkable in this Road as in many others whiefi manifefts the Charity of the For in moft of the high Roads, that are far from Rivers, they have fet up Cifterns, whither when the Rains fail, the neigh, bouring Villages bring Water for the Travellers, who would eife be very tiia'ch diftrefs’d. The fixteenth wetravel’d eight hours through a yery even Country, butfilW nur'd,,; where we faw a little City call’d BoaUmndi, There are fome Mofutii? which the 7 *^ have built out of the Ruints of the ancient Greeks Churches, front.. whichthey have taken Pillars of Marble, and other pieces of Architedure, to addin their Sepulchers without any order at all, which you meet with very often upon the high Roads •, the number is the greater,. becaufe they never lay two Bodies in one Grave. There is alfo in this City an Inn , cover’d with Lead, which is all the Beauty of it; nor do Travell ers make any ufe of it but only in foul weather.

Once as I came out of Perfia they would needs give me a tad of their Art, notwithftanding all the care I took.

That if you tranfport it, before you make it into Bales, you muft throw Salt-water upon it whicfe keeps the Worms out of it, and preferves it from rotting. Now voumuft take notice that they never dye this Wool, it being naturally of a clear Brown, or a dark Alh-colour *, and that there is very little of it White, which is alio much dearer than the other, as well for that it ns fcarce, as becaufe that the Mufti's the Mouttatfs and other perfons belonging to the Law- never wear any Girdles’or Vails (wherewith they cover their Heads when they pray) but White : for at other times they wear them about their Necks, as the Women do their iSCclf Into this Province of Kerman almoftall the Gaiires are retir’d, and they are they that only Trade in this Wool, and have the whole Manufadure of it.

To which purpofe, I departed from Ormus, and took Guides along with me to (hew me the way to Kerman, whither I could not get on Horfeback in Ids than twenty-feven days. 1 dare fay that Alexander the Great didnot march this way into the Indies : for in the whole extent of the -Country there is no Water to be met with but in fome certain places, and in the hollow of fome Rocks, where there is not enough neither to water eight or ten Horfes. Befides, in fome places a man is conltrain’d, by reafon of the Mountains, to fetch a great compafs about *, for a Foot-man that makes his way through thofe Rocks, (hall go farther in half an hour than a Horfe-man can do in four. Kerman is a large City, which has been often ruin’d by being feveral times taken and re-taken •, nor is there any thing handfom jn it, but only one Houfeanda Garden, upon which the Lift Kans have beftow’d avaft expence to make the place delightful. They make there a fort of Earthen ware which comes very near to Tort elan, and looks as neat and as fine. As foon as l arriv’d, I went to vifit the Kan, who made me very welcom, and gave order to the Gawres to furnifh me with Bread and Wine, Pullets and Pigeons, which in thofe parts are fat, and as large as little Capons. The Gaures are they that make the Wine*, and to make it more fweet and pleafant, they take away the Stalks, and never prefs any thing but the meer Grape. Y TheiGztf was but newly entred into the pofiefiion of his Government, and being dcfirous, according to the cuftom of the new Governours, to have a noble Sword and Dagger, with a rich Furniture of his Horfe, which requir’d fome Jewels, I prefented him with a Diamond worth eight hundred Qrowns, which he caus’d to be fet in the end of the handle of his Dagger. He alfo defir’d to have of me^as many more Jewels as came to feven or eight hundred Livres: and by the Prefent and the Bargain I facilitated my purchafe of the Wool which I intended to buy. Two days afteer he invited me to his Entry-Feaft, which he made forthe cheif of the City *, and knowing I wanted a Mule, he f^nt me one well worth a hundred Crowns. This is the Nobleft Carriage in all Verfia , which the great Perfonages choofe before Hqi fes, efpecialiy when they are in years. But it was not the Kan alone who was civil tome. A young Lord, who liv’d in Kerman., and was at the Fcaft, whofe Father had been formerly Kan himfdf, took great delight to difeourfe with me concerning my Travels *, and offer’d me his fervice in a very obliging man ner. Now the Verfians are very curious, and great admirers of the Rarities of Forein Countries: which inclination led the young Lord to enquire of me whether I had &lt;3)0$ any Fire-Arms, telling me he would content me for them to my fatisfa&amp;ion. The next Morning I prefented him with a Carbine, and a pair of Piftols that pleas’d hirti exceedingly *, and a little Watch, for which I would take no Money, whereat he . leem’d to be not a little troubl’d. However he lent me a (lately Horie worth about two hundred Crowns, or twelve Tomans. This young Lord was of a clear humour, civil, accomplifh’d, generous,and did every thing \yith a good grace. So that when he Pent me the Hoffc, he lent to entreat me withal, if I did not like that Horfe, to come and choofe which Hik’d bed in his Stable. F ’ 1 By4 2 The Persian Travels Book I.

But while Sha-Abas liv d, there was no perfon that durft open his li ps againft the fo much was he in favour, and that juftly, with the N.ng. Sha-Seft fucccedmg his Grandfather Sha-Abas, and being very young, the Nazar s Adverfaries thought they had now a fair Game to play. Thereupon the V\ ' Eunuch?.,&gt; . Chap. IX. of Monfieur T A VER NIER. 43 Eunuchs, who are always at the King’s Ear, i'uggefted to him many things to the difadvantage of the Grand Mafterbut whatever they fiid, the Ring gave little heed to their Tales. At length, one day when the King was looking upoh certain bkains and ©aggers fet with precious Stones, one of the Eunuchs told him thofe were trifles, and then defird his Majefty to fend for a Scimeter that the Grand Sfmor had lent Sha-Jbas, all over let with Diamonds. True it is, that the Grand Slumr had fent a rich Scimiter to Sha-Ab&lt;u, but Sha- Abas had defac’d it long before Mahomet's time, and had made a noble Jewel of the Scones th.at adorn’d it. There upon this Scimitar was fought for in thelreafury, where Mahomet was chief Offi cer-, but not being to be found, the King was troubl'd, finding it regiftred in the Book of Prefents. Then certain Eunuchs and Grandees of the Court took their opportunity to rip up Mahomet's Life ^ they reprefented to the King how many Inns, Bridges, and Dikes Mahomet had built at his own charge ; what aHoufehe had rear'd for himfelf, fitting for his Majefty to live in: and aggravated withal, that he could not do fuch great things as thofe, without purloining notably from the Publick Stock; for which he fliould do well to call him to an account. As they were thus difeourfmg, Mahomet edme irlto the Prefehce, to whom the King (not receiving him as he was wont to do) fpoke fome hard words about the Scimiter that could not be found : telling him withal, that he would fee if the all reft of the things in the Treafury were agreeable to the Regifter, dnd then gave him fifteen days time to give in his Account. Mahomet not at ail mov’d, reply’d to the King, that if his Majefty pleas’d he might come to the Treafury to morrow: and withal be- fought him fo to do, though the King a fecond time gave him fifteen days. There upon the King did go to the Treafury next morning, according to Mahomet's defire, and found all things in good order ^ having heard before what became of the Sci- miter. From thence he Went to Mahomet s Houle, who made the King a mean Prefect: For it is the cuftom, that he whom the King honours with aVifit, muft make a Prefent to his Majefty. After the King had receiv’d it, he walk’d up and down, and viewed the Chambers, Halls, Parlours and Pvooms of State*, and wonder’d to fee them fo ill fet out with plain Felts, and courfe Carpets; whereas in other Lords Houles a man could not fet his Foot upon any thing but Cloth of Gold and Silk. For the King, as they had fet the Naz^ar out, expend toh^ve found other things ; which made him admire at fo great a Moderation info higH a degree of Honour, Now at the end of a Gallery, there was a Door loekt with three great Padlocks. Of this the King took no notice : whereupon the Meter^ who is the White Eunuch, and chief of his Chamber, as he came back, fhew’d the King the I)oor that was fo ftrongiy Padlock’d *, which made the King fo curious to Pave it open’d: withal, asking Mahomet what he had got there lock’d up with fo much care ? Oh Sir, faid he, it behoves me to keep that loekt, for there is all the Eftate I have in the World. All that your Majefty has feen in this Houfc is yours, but all that is in that Chamber is rrtine, and l dare affure my felf, your Majefty will be fo gaacious as never to take it from me. Thofe words inflam’d the King’s curioflty fo, that he commanded the Door to be open’d : But he was ftrangely furpriz’d, when he faw nothing more within than Mahomet's Sheep-hook, that lay upon two Nails, his Scrip wherein he us’d to put'his ViOuals, his Bottle for his Water, his Pipe, and his Shepherd’s Weeds, all hanging againft the Wall. The beholding the King’s aftonilhment at futh a Sight, Sir, faid he, when the King Sha-AbaAo\ind me in the Mountain keeping Goats, then that was all I had, and he took nothing from me: I befeechyour Majelty that you would not deprive me of thefe things neither*, but rather, if you pleale, let me refume them again, and fall to my old calling. The Ki!^touch’d at fo high a piece of Virtue, caus'd himfelf to bedifapparel’d, and gave has Habit to the Nanar, which is thegreateft Honour that theKing of Perfiacm beftow dpon a Subjeft. Thus Mahomet continu'd and dy*d honourably m his Employment. This brave Perlon was the Proje&amp;or of all the Frank* in Perfia : and it any one had done them wrong, upon complaint he did them Juftice immediately. One day as I was {hooting Ducks, r upon the River of Ifyahan near the Gardens 3 with two Servants, fome of the Nazar's people that did not know me fet upon me, and would have taken away my Gun; which I would not let go till I had broke the Stock about the Shoulders of the one, and fiung the Barrel at the other’s Head. Thereupon I took form of the Franks F 2 *■&lt;- The Persian ‘travels Book I. along with me, and complain’d to the iStaz^ar : He teftifi’d his lorrow for what had Happen’d, and gave us evident Proofs thereof, by the blows which he caus’d to be laid upon thofe that had done me the injury. Another time, -Sha'Sefi being upon his return from Cuilan^ his Tents were fet up near Zulfa in Armenia, where the King ftaid to hunt two or three days. Now among the reft of the Courtizans that follow’d the Court, to divertife the King with Dancing and Mummery, there was one who was perfcftly h^ndfom, to whom the King had already lent Prefents*, which could not be unknown to any Lord i’the Court. But the Naz.ar$ Son, for all that, being in the heat of Youth, got this Courtizan tohis fl Tent, and there lay with her: which came to his Father’s Ears next day. The whether out of his zeal to the King, or whether it were an efFe£t of his prudence to prevent the King’s anger,which would have certain ly been the death of his Son, caus’d him to be drub’d, after the manner of the Coun try, and baftinado’d all over, till the Nails of his Toes dropt off, and that his Body was almoft a perfea Geliy. Which when the King underftood, together with the Young Man’s Crime, he Paid no more, but that the Nazar had done wifely by ; punifhing his Son himfelf, to prevent his Juftice. But to return to the Road from Kerman tolfpahan. The nrft day that I feCoiit from Kerman, at my Stage in the Evening 1 met with a rich Moullaio, who feeing I had Wine, civilly offer’d me fome of his Ice to cool it. In retaliation, I gave him fome of my Bottle. He invited me to his Houfe, which was well built, wkh a handfom Garden with Water in it. He entertain’d me with Spoon-meat, according to the mode of the Country; and when I took my leave, he fill’d my Baracho with' very good Wine. ^ The following days I faw nothing worthy obfervatioo; the Country being as I have already delcrib’d it. . - lyes in the Road, almoft in the mid-way between Kerman and Jfpahafi, m 93 Deg. 15 Min. of Longitude, and 13 Deg. 45 Min. of Latitude. It is a great Town in the middle of the Sands, that extend themfelves for two Leagues round it: fothat when you leave Tezd you muft take a Guide, for upon the leaft Wind the Sand covers the Highway, whereby a man may be apt to fall into Holes, which feem to have been either old Citterns, or the Ruines of ancient Buildings. Between the Town and the Sands there is a little good Soil, which produces excellent Fruits, but above ail. Melons of feveral forts: the Pulp of fome is green, of others yellow and vermilion ; and fome there are, the meat whereof is as hard as a Renneting. IThere are alfo very good, Grapes, and good Wine*, but the Governour will not permit the Inhabitants to make Wine. Some therefore they dry, and of the reft they make a kind of Confeaion to eat with Bread. There are alfo abundance of Figs, which are large and well tafted. Theydiftil vaft quantities of Rofe-water, and another fort of Water with which they dye their Hands and Nails red, which they fqueeze out of a certain Rocft call’d Hina. There are three Inns iW City, and feveral Bazars or Market-places cover’d and vaulted, which are full of Mer chants and Workmens Ware-houfes. They alfo make at Tezd feveral Stuffs Silk intermix’d with Gold and Silver, which they call 7 and another fort of Stuff of all pure Silk, call’d tDarai) like our fmooth ftrip’d Taffata’s. Other Stuns they made, half Silk half Cotton *, others all of Cotton, like our Fuftians. They make alio Serges of a particular Wool, which is fo fine and delicate, that it looks hanu- fomer, and is much better than Silk. , Though I had nothing to do, I Raid in Tezd three days, becauie I met with tomz Armenians ot ray acquaintance. In which time 1 found the general Opinion to be true. For certainly the Women of Tezd are the hand fomeft Women in ail Terfia. There is no Feaft made, but five or fix of them come to diverts fe the Guefts with Dancing, who are generally none of themeaneft Beauties and Converfations among them. However it comes to pafs, the Perpan Proverb is, That to live happy f a Man mufi have a Wife of Yezd, eat the Bread of Yezdecas, and drink the Wine of Schiras, , , .v ‘b?,.

Right againft the Head of every Horfe there is a Nich with a Window into the Lodging- Chamber, out of which every man may fee how his Horfe is look’d after. Thefe Niches are ufualiy fo large, that three men may lye in them*, and there it is that the Servants ufualiy drefs their Vi&amp;uals, There are two forts of Inns. For fome are endow’d; where you may be re ceiv’d for Charities hike; others, where you muft pay for what you call for. There are none of thefirft, but between Budaand Conflantinofle. Nor is it lawful for any others to build fuch, but only the Mothers and Sifters of the Grand Signor, or fuch Fibers, and Bajhas as have been three times in Battel againft the Chriftians. In thefe Inns, which are built out of Legacies, there is a very good allowance of Diet to Travellers, and at your departure you have nothing to do but to thank the BenefaQor. But from Conftantinople to Perfid, there are none of thofe endow’d Inns only fuch where you have nothing but bare Walls. It is for you to provide Utenfils for your Kitchin, and a Bed to lye on : as for Provifion, the people bring Lambs, Pullets, Butter, and Fruits in their feafons: or elfe you may buy it, provided before hand by the Matter of theHoufe. There you alfo meet with Barley and Straw for the Horfes, unlefs it be in fome few places that I have been at upon the Road. In the Country you pay nothing for your Chambers *, but in the Cities you pay fomething, though it be but a fmall matter. Ufualiy the Caravans never go into the Towns, which are not able to contain fo many People and Horfes. When you come to your Quarters every one looks after his own Chamber, for there is no regard to Poor or Rich: fometimes out of Breeding, or out of Intereft, an ordinary Tradeiman will give way to a great Merchant *, but no man k permitted to leave the Chamber which he has once made choice of. In the night the Inn-keeper (huts up his Gates, being anfwerable for all things that (hall be loft *, for which reafon he keeps a Guard about the Inn. ' N '••• • '■' As for the ‘Perfian Caravanfira’s, they are more commodious, and better built than thofe of Turkic, and at more reafonable diftances, throughout almoft all the Country. By which defeription of Inns it is eafie to obferve, that though thefe Caravan [era’s are not fo commodious for the Rich as our European Inns, yet they are more convenient for the Poor, to whom they never refufetogive admittance: ho perfon being oblig’d to eat or drink more than he pleafes} but every one being allow’d to fpend according to his Stock, without grumbling. You may travel in Turkic or Perfia, either with the Caravan, or elfe in company, ten or twelve together, or elfe alone with a^Guide, The fafeft way is to go with the Caravan, though you are longer upon the Road, by reafon of the flownefs of their march, efpecially when the C^m/^jconfift of Camels. The Caravans are as it were great Convoys, which confift of a good number of Merchants, that meet at certain times and places, to put themfelves into a con dition to defend themfelves from Thieves, that are very rife in Troops in feveral defert places up6n the Road. Thefe Merchants choofe among themfelves a Caravan- Bafhi , who orders them how they (hall march, afligns the places of lodging at night, and who with the chief of the Caravan, is a kind of Judge of the differences that i -fall but by the way. There is .no honed man that covets the employment •, for the Caravan-BAjhi, being to difcharge feveral fmail duties upon the Road, however he behave himielf, is dill fulpefted for his fidelity. When the Turks are rooft nume rous, they make choice of a Turkb when ^e Armenian Merchants are tnoft, they choofe an Armeniani , , - There are two forts of Caravans. There are Caravans which confift of Camels which are the mod ufual •, in regard that Camels are cheap, and for that fome Camels* will carry as much as three Horfes, others as much as four or rive. But among the Caravans of Camels, there are feveral Horfes and Mules, which the Merchants themfelves ride upon } it being very tedious to ride upon a Camel when he only goes a foot-pace, but very pleafant when he goes upon his large trot. There are other Caravans that confift only of Horfes *, and among thefe, if the Merchant have none of his own, he may hire one. The Servants ride upon thofe Horfes that are leaft laden-, but at you may meet with feveral good Horfes very cheap, from thirty to fixty Crowns. As for thofe perfons that are either unwilling or unable to be at any expence, they make ufe of Afles, of which there are enow to be had. Above all things, you mud take care to provide Pack-Horfes to carry your Wine ; for the Camel-Mafters being will not permit you to lade their Camels with any fuch Liquor ^ that Bead being particularly confecrated to Mahomet, who fo ftri&amp;ly forbad the ufe of Wine. You put your Wine in Bottles made of wild Goats Skins, with the hairy fide turn’d innermod, affd well pitch’d within. There are fome of thefe Bottles from which they take off the Hair*, but they are notfo , good, as being feldom without holes. Thefe Camel-Mafters are an infolent fort of people, which you dial) never know how to deal with, unlefs you can bring them to punilhrnent. There was one that play’d me fome of his jades tricks in the Road from Smyrna to ; but when] came to Efcrivan, I complain’d to the Kan,who prel'ently caus’d a hundred Baftinado’s to be giv’n him upon the fpot. Nor is there any other way to bring thofe Scoundrels to reafon,efpccially at and fuch other places, where the Merchants have their Confab) who upon the lead complaint to theCWy have Jufticc done them imme. diately. The examples of fome of thefe Camel-drivers that have been paid off, keep the red in good decorum \ and they will be very tra&amp;able for a good while after. The Journies of the Caravans are not equal} fometimes not above fix hours travel, fometimes 1 ten, and fometimes twelve } it being the convenience of Water, which is not every where to be met with, that is the Rule of Lodging the Caravan. At all times the Caravan travels more by night than by day in Summer to avoid the heat, and at other times, tfiat you maybe fure to have day enough to fet up your Tents. For if the Caravan diould come to pitch in the night, it would be impoffible for them to find where to fet up their Tents, to drefs and look after their Beads, make ready their Kitchins, and provide things neceffary for fo large a Company. True it is, that in the depth of Winter and in the great Snows, they feldom fet ouf till two or three hours after midnight; and that fometimes they day till day-break. Tut in Summer, according to the Journey which they intend, they let out either at midnight, or an hour after Sun-fet. The lad time I went from Smyrna the Car mm confided of fix hundred Camels, and almofi the fame number of Horfe. Sometimes their number is greater, fo that the Camels going but by one and one after another, a feems to be an Army*, and whether it be in travelling or lodging, they take up a world of Ground. Now by reafon they travel all night in Afia, it happens that the Air is indifferent wholfom; and that the Travellers, that lye lor the molt part upon a Carpet fpread upon the Ground, find themfelves very little inconve nienc’d by it. .v / The Camels that go into Perfia through the Northern Provinces of travel like Horfes in a Cart, by feven and feven *, they are ty’d together by a Cord about the bignefs of a Man’s little Finger, and a Fathom long *, faften’d to the Pack- faddle of the Camel that goes before, and to the Head-harnefs of the Camel that follows. Thofe little Cords are made no ftronger, to the end that if the Came before fhould chance to fall into any hole, the Camel behind fhould either keep him up, or clfe not be' pull’d in after the other. And to the end that the CameMnver who leads the foremoft, may know whether the other fix follow him or no, t e faff Camel has a Bell about his Neck, which if it ceafe to ring, ’tis a fign that lome,48 Th Persian Trav Book I. deep Snows, wherein you (hall find them almoft buried the next mor- * When the Caravan comes near the place where it intends to ftop, every Mer- rhant rides betore to take up a convenient place for himielt and his Goods, f or which he covets a rifing Ground, that if it (hould happen to rain, the Water may Tun from the Bales.

Nons there any contending with thefe Camel-drivers and Muletere, for as they are a rude fort of people, a Man runs the hazard of his Life by conteftmg alone: of which one Example may fuffice for all. Setting out one day from Bander-Abaffi, for Ifpaban, with a Mcrchant of Babyhn, as we came to the Inn where we lay the firft night, which was call’d Gaetchy the Merchant commanded one of his Slaves who was a Oaf tr of Mozambique , to fetch him fome frelh Water at the Ciftern, to drink: The Cafer went thither and return’d without any Water, telling his Mafter, that the Camel-drivers and M* leters threaten’d to beat him, and would not let him come near the Cittern. The Merchant either ill advis’d, or not knowing the cuftom, bid him hack, and kick thofe that refus’d him. Whereupon the Cafer returning, and finding the fame refiftance as before, began to give ill language to the Camel-drivers, fo that one of them happen'd to ftrike him. Upon that tht Cafer drawing his Sword, ran him into the Belly, fo that he fell down dead : Thereupon the whole Rabble fell upon him, bound him, and carry’d him back to Bander-Abaft for the Governour to put him to death. The Mafter of the Cafer, accompany’d by feveral Merchants, went to the Governour and reprefented to him the infolence of thofe people, and how thebufmefs had happen’d. Upon which the Governour took the poor fellow outo! ■ their hands, and caus’d him to be kept Cafe-, after that, he caus’d ten ot a dozen of thofe Muleters to be feiz’d, and orderd'd them to be foundly baftmado d, fo hindrins a Merchant’s Servant from fetching Water for his Mafter.

Thefe Camels ufually cairy a thoufand Pound weight: but if the Merchant has any hank upon the Camel driver, he will lay upon every Camel fifteen hundred weight, thereby making two of three Burthens. This the Merchants do, when they come near the Cuftom-Houfes, efpecially that of which is the moftfevere. The Merchant does this for his own Profit: So that when the Cuftomcr miftrufting, de mands how fo many Camels come to tvavel empty, he makes anfwer, that they were Camels thatcarry’d Provifion : But the Cuftomer mbfi: commonly winks at that good Husbandry of the Merchant, for fear of lofing his Cufiom, and obliging die Merchant to take another Road. , .

He verily believing they had been fat and in good cafe, but they were only blown up. For thofe Cheats have a trick to cut a Hole near the Tail, of which the Purchafer takes no notice, and which they know neatly how to fowup again: In this Hole they will blow till they have puft up a lean Camel, that he (hall appear as fat and plump as the founded that ever fed : whereby they often deceive the quickeft fights, efpecialiy when the Hair is all off, and that the bare Skin is all rub’d over with Tar.

This Knight had landed his Men, and laid them in Ambufcade; but unfortunately his Defign was difeover’d, fothat the Caravan^ that might have been eafily furpriz’d, flood upon their Guard. • ' / We were near the Coaft, when we difeover’d a Skiff with fifteen or fixteen Turks, that were fent by him that commanded four Galleys of Rhodes to demand the Cuftomary Prefent from our Captain. Thofe Galleys then anchor’d at Paujfes } and had there difeharg’d therr.felves of their Provifions of War for Bagdat, which the Grand Signer was going to befiege. And it is the cuftom, that when the Great Turk's Galleys are out at Sea, that whatever ftrange VefTd paffes by them mi fend them a Prefent, either willingly or by force. When the Bajha oftheSea, who is the Admiral of the Turks, is in Perfon at Sea, the Veflcl which he meets is not excus’d for 2000 Crowns: fo that when he fets out UomConflantinople tocruife, the Veflelsof the Franks do all they can to avoid him. There are Tome that will feek to efcape in fight of the Galleys, but it has coft them dear. And if happen’d, 1 that one day the Wind fiackning, they boarded a Veflel of Marfeilles, the Captain and Notary whereof were both feiz’d , and drub’d Till their Bodies were aboil: bruis’d to a Geliy, and they had like to have dy’d upon it, without being thebettq; in their Purfes; for the rudenefs of the Chaftifement did not excufe them from paying the Money which was demanded. Whether our Captain knew any thing of this Example, or whether it were out of his natural heat of Valour, he laugh’d at the Skiff-men, bidding them be gone, and telling them he had no PrefentsfoE them but Cannon-Bullets. Thereupon the Men return'd to their Galleys, who foon deliver’d us from the true fear we were in, that the gallantry of the Captain had drawn us into an inconvenience. For while we kept the Sea cl'ofe by the Coaft, to obferve the Countenances of the Turks, they weigh’d Anchor, and turn’d their Prows toward Rhodes. However, before they left us they fent us a Broad fide, and oiir Captain, whatever we could fay, fent them another, which render’d us more guilty. For the Turks pretend that when their Navy is at Sea, or only one Squadron, and that a ftrange Veflel is in fight, (he is bound to come as near as the Wind will permit her without being hal’d, for which they will otherwife make the Commander pay very feverely. TheConfuIs and Merchants of Aleppo underftanding what had pafs’d . very much blam’d the Captain, fearing a worfe confequepce of the bufinefc? But by good fortune the mifcarmge was ftifl’d and never went farther. The fame day the Wind veering to the Weft-North- Weft, we fail’d into the Road of Alexandretta, where we came to an Anchor, about a quarter of a League from the Land.

However ^hey mufi; be nien who love Money at a ft range-rate , that accept of thofe Employments. For the Air, like that of Ormuiy is generally fo bad, eipecially in the Summer, in fo much that they who do not dye, cannot avoid very dangerous DnTcmpers. if there be any fo drong that they can hold out for three or four Years, and can accuftom themfelves to a bacl Air, they do well to (lay there *, 4 m for them to betake themfelves to a good Air, is to hazard their Lives. Mr. Philips the Frighfh Conful has been the only Perfon that ever liv’d two and twenty Years at AiexAndretta: but you muft know he was a brisk merry M in, ani of an excellent temper ol Body } and yet for all that he had been forc’d to be cauteriz’d. That which renders the Air To bad, is the great quantity of (landing Pools and Plalhes in J he neighbouring Plains, extending to the Ead and South ; but when the great Heats begin to approach, the moft part of the Inhabi tants retire to a Village call’d Belan^ upon the next Mountain to the City, where there are very good Waters and excellent Fruits. They come alfo -thither from Aleppo, when there is an appearance of a Peftilence^ and yet there are few people in this Village who are not troubled with a fort of Fever, that makes their Eyes look' yellow and hollow; which they never can remedy as long as they live About half a League from Alexandretta, on *the right hand of the High way, jud againft the Merfh on the other fide, is a Tower whereon are to be feen the Arms of Godfrey of Bulloign. In all likelihood it was built for the defence of the High-way, which is.enclos’d between thele two Merches, whofe Fxhalations are cry noxious. It is but three little days journey from Alexandretta to Aleppo, and fome well mounted have rid it in two. The Franks are not permitted to ga thither on Foot. For before that Prohibition, in regard the way was fhort, every Sea-man that had a hundred Crowns, more or lefs, went on Foot to Aleppo, and got eafily thither in three days, with little expence. Now bccaufe they had but little Money to fpend, and were willing to djfpatch their bufinefs, they would not Hand to give Four or Five in the Hundred extraordinary for what Goods they bought, which was of dangerous confequence to the Merchants For you muft obfefve, that when the Ships arrive, the firft man that either out of rafhnefs or ignorance, gives two Sous more fo\r a Commodity that is not worth a Crown, fets the Price, and taufes all the whole Commodity to be fold at that rare. So that the Merchants that lay out ten or twelve thouland Crowns together, are very carefulleft thofe Saylors (hould get before them, and enhance the Price of the Market. : To remedy which inconvenience, the Merchancs obtain’d an Order, That na Strangers fhould be permitted to go a-foot from Alexandretta to Aleppo, but that they Oioufdbe bound to hire Horfes, and to give for every Horfe fix Piafters thi ther, and fix back 5 which expence would foon eat out the Profit of a poor Mari ner’s fmall Sum. llfuaily you (lay at sAlexandretta three or foordays, as well to reft your felf, as to make fame little Provifions for your Journey to For though you meet with good Stages at Evening, yet the Jamfaries will be very glad to eat by the way. . . , /: ■, - - ; . . ':v:; p:■ - &gt; Setting out from Alexandretta, we travePd over a Plain to the foot of a Mountain which is calPdto. There is a wide Gap in the midft of this Mountain, which giving liberty to che North-Eaft Wind, when it blows hard, doth fo enrage the jlodd of Acxandre:ta, which is otherwife very calm, that no Ship can ride there at that time. In fo much that all Ships that happ’n to -be there when the Wind xifes, prefently weigh, and get out to Sea, for fear of being caftaway. Almoft at theE R S 1 a. n Tr the top of the Mountain.you meet with an Inn ; but though it be very f d i r with Fountains round about it, yet Merchants never flop there, but goon aI°M 5 farther to a Grecian that ipeaks good Lalian, and whole entertainment is indiffe ^ good, confidering the Country. When you go away, you give him a Crown for v,?! accommodation, which is the manner at other Stages, by a cuitom, which the Fr&lt;n themfelves having eilabliih’d,. will never be left off. ^ pefeending down the Mountain you difeoyer the City of Antioch^ built n a Hill. Formerly the Road lay through that City, but the Janizaries 0 f ? place exafting a Fiafter from every perfon thattravd’d that way, that Road is n C difus’d. Antioch once made more noife in the World, being faFn to ruine C vc fmee the Chanel, that ran from the ( i ty to the Sea, where Galleys might rick hss been dop’d up by the Sands that have encroach’d upon the Mouth of tb Haven. e When you are at the bottom of the Hill toward the North, you difeover aCaftle builtupon a Hill ftanding by itfdf, from whence you have a profpeSl over a good part of the Plait* ef Antioch. It is about fifteen Leagues long, and three broad in that part where the Road lyes. Somewhat move than half the way, you meet with a long Caufey parted by feveral Bridges, by reafon of certain Rivulets that crofs it, without which the Road were hardly pafiable. The frequent Revolts of Bagdat and Balfara, which the Grand Signor has been forc’d fo often to befiege caus’d the Grand f^ifier in the Reign of Achmat to undertake this Caufey, which together with the Bridge was finifh’d in fix Months, that was looktupon asaMiia- cle. This was done for the more eafie paffage of the Artillery, and other Provifions of War, that veere brought out of Romania and Cmc? to the Siege of Bagdat, which could never have been done, but for this Caufey. At the end of this Caufey Rands a Bridge, very long and ftrongly built, under which runs a River, which, with the other Rivulets that wind about the Plain, forms a Lake toward the South that is call'd the Lake of Antioch. This Lake affords a great Revenue, byreafon of the Eds that are caught there, which 'are taken two Months before Lent, and tranfpprted to Malta Sicily^ and other parts, of Italy: This Plain is very full of Olive-Trees*, which produces that great Trade of Soap, that is made at Aleppo, and tranfporied into Mejopotamia , Chaldea, Perfia, and the Defert; that Commodity being on£ of the moft acceptable Prefents that can be made to the Arabians. Sallet Oyl is alfo in great efteem among them: fo that when you make them a Prefent of it, they will take off their Bonnets, and rub their Heads, their Faces, and their Beards with it, lifting up their Eyes to Heaven, and cry in their Language, God be thank’d. Therein they have lo!l nothing of the ancient cuftom of the Eafiern People, of which there is often mention made in Holy Scripture. About a League and a half beyond the Plain, you meet with a Rock, at the foot whereof is a little deep Lake, wherein they catch a world of Fifh thatarelikeouf Barbels. 1 have kill’d them with my Piftol; and found them to be of an excellent taiV, though they are not regarded at Aleppo. Two hours after you ford a River which is call’d Afrora ; though if it have hap pen’d to rain, you mull {lay ’till the Waters are fai’n. Having pad the River, upon the Banks whereof you (lay to feed your feif and your Horfes, you come to lye at a poor Village call’d Shacjuemin, where there is an Inn. Here the Country- people bring Provifiohsof Food to the Travellers; and whether you eat or no, you mufl pay a Pi after, according to the cufbom which the Franks haveeftablifh’d. After you have pafs’d the Plain of Antioch as far as Shaqttemin , the Horfes in Summer are fo ternbly tormented with a fort of great Flies, that it were impofiible to travel three or four hours together , were it not for going out of the Road, either to the right, or to the left, and riding through the Fields, which are full of thofe Burrs that our Clothworkers make ufe of: For. in regard they grow as high astbe Crupper of the Horfe, they keep the Flies off from flinging and tyring the HodS. Leaving the Village of Shaquemin, the Road lyes among Stones \ and for half this tedious way* for two or three Leagues round about, you fee nothing bat d# Ruihes of ancient Monafterics. There are fome of them which are built almoftall of Free ftone *, and about Haifa days journey toward the North, quite out of tfie Road, Hands the Monaftery orSt, the with the remainder of hisle famousi ChafxM. ■ tf/Moniieur Ta vernier. 57 famous Pillar, which is ftill to be iecn.

CHAP. II. 1 . ' ,. 1 ■ 1 ■ ■ ,) The Defcription of Aleppo, no ip the Capital City of Syria. Leppo is one of the moO: famous Cities in all Turkic , as well for the b'gnels and beauty of it, as for the goodnefs of the Air, and plenty of all things} together with the great Trade which is driv’n there by _ __ all the Nations of the World, it lyes in 71 Deg. 41 Min. of Longitude, and 36 Deg. 15 Min. of Latitude, in an excellent Soil. With ail the fearch that I could make, I could never learn how it was anciently call’d. Some would have 4 t to be Hi trap oils, others Beroeai And the Chntiansof the Country agrde with the latter. The Arabian Hiftonarrs that record the taking of it, call it only dUb, not mentioning any other name. Whence this Oofervatioh is to be made. That if the Arabians call it Aleb, others AUp the reafon is, becauie the Arabians mever ufe the Lerter P in their Language. This City was taken by the Arabians m rhe fif eenth Yearoi thewhich was about the Year of CHRIST 637, iri the Reign of Heraclm Emperour of Conflantmople. The City is built upon four Hills, and the Caftle upon the higheit that ftands in the middle of Aleppo, being fupported by Arches in Tome place,, for fear the Earth fhould rumble and moulder away from it. The Caftle is large, and may be about five or fix hundred Paces in compafs. The Walls and Towers, though built of Free ftone, are of little defence. There is but one Gate to enter into it from the South, over a Draw-bridge, laid over certain Arches crofs a Moat about fix or feven Fathom deep. There is but one half of it full of Water, and thataftanding Puddle to boot*, the reft is a meer dry Ditch- fo that it cannot be accounted a whoifom place. However there is Water brought into the Caftle through a large Pipe from the Fountains in the City 2 and there is a ftrong Garrifon kept in X The City is above three Miles in circuit, and the befthalf of it is unmoated; that Moat there is not above three Fathom deep. The Walls are very good, and all of Free-ftone *, with feveral fquare Towers, diftant one from the other about four- fcore Paces; between which there are others alfo that are lefs. But thefe Walls' are not all of them of an equal height, for in feme places they are not above four Fathoms from the Ground. There are ten Gates to enter into the City, without either Moat or Draw-Bridge ; under one of which there is a place that the 1 arks have in great veneration *, where they keep Lamps continually burning, and report that Eliflsa the Prophet liv’d for feme time. There is no River that runs through Aleppo, and but only a Mall one without the City, which the Arabians call Co'ic, However, though indeed it be but pro perly a Rivulet, yet it is very ufeful to water the Gardens, where grows an abun dance of Frutit, particularly Piftaches, much bigger, and better tailed than thofe that comes from the parts near Casbin, But though there be no River, yet there are ftoreof Fountains and Receptacles of Water, which they bring from two places diftant from the City. T , r H The$8 The Persian ‘Travels The Edifices, neither publick nor private, are very Eandforn, but only with fide} the Walls are or Marble of feveral colours, and the Cieling of Foli^' Fret-work, with Inscriptions in Golden Letters. Without and within the there are fix and twenty Atcfquees y fix or (even whereof are very mapnsfi' with {lately Dhowo's, three being cover’d with Lead. The chideft anti la of all, was a Chnftian Church which they call’d Alhha^ cr Ltftcn'd unto : which' thought to have been built by St. Helen. In one partot the Suburbs alfo {Wirf another Mofqnee , which was formerly a Chriftian Church} in that there is S thing worthy obfervation. In the Wall upon the right fide of the Gate there* a Stone to be feen two or three Foot fquare, wherein there is the figure of a hand fora Chalice* and a Sacrifice over the hollow of it, with aCrefcent that covers th Sacrifice, the two Horns whereof defeend juft upon the brims of the mouth of th Chalice. One would think stfirft that thofe Figures Were in Mofmc Work: but it is all Natural, as I have found with feveral other Franks having ferap’d the Stone with an Iron Inftrument, when the Turk* were out of the way. Several Confuls would have bought it, and there has been offer’d for it 2000 Crowns} but the BajhaT of Aleppo would never iuffer it to be fold. Half a League from the City lyes a pleafant FI ill, where the Franks are won t to take the Air. On the fide of that Hill is to be feen a Cave or Gmto, where the Turks report that liv’d for lome few days; and for that there is an ilJ-fhap’d figure of a Hand imprinted in the Rock, they farther believe it to be the Hand of Haly. There are three Colledges in Aleppo y but very few Scholars, though there be Men of Learning that belong to them, who have Salaries to teach Grammar, and their odd kind of Philofophy, with the Grounds of their Religion, which are the Principal Sciences to which the Turks apply thcmfelves. The Streets of the City are ail pav’d, except the Bazar's, where the Merchants and Handicraft-Tradefmen keep their Shops. The chiefeft Aitifts, and the moft numerous are Silk and Camlet-Weavers. h\ the City and Suburbs there arc about forty Inns*, and fifty publick Baths as well for Women as for Men, keeping their turns. ’Tis the chiefeft Paftimefte Women have to go to the Baths; and they will fpareail the Week long to carry a Collation, when they go at the Weeks end to make merry among themldvres m thofe places of privacy. . . The Suburbs of the City are large and well peopl’d, for almoft aD the Chriftbss have their Houfes and Churches there. Of which Chriftians there are four forts in Ahppo ^ I mean of Eaftern Chriftians, that is to today, Greeks, Armenians, Jacobin or Syrians, and Marcnites. The Greeks have an Archbifhop there, and arc about fifteen orfaxteen thoufandin number; their Church is dedicated toSu George. The Armenians have a Bifhop, whom they call Kertabet *, and are abou* twelve thou* fand in number; their Church is dedicated to the Virgin. The Jacobites being about ten thoufand, have a Biftiop alfo • and their Church is likewife dedicated to tic Virgin, as is that of the Armenians. The JITaronites upon the Pope, not being above twelve hundred ; their Church being confecrated to St. £/z^. The Romani tholicks have three Churches, ferv’d by the Capuchins, Carmelites, and Jefuits. They reckon that in the Suburbs and City of Aleppo there are about 250000 Souls. There is avaft Trade at Aleppo for Silks and Camlets, but chiefly for Gall-Nuts, and iF r danede, which is a fort of Acorn-fhell without which the Curriers cannot drefs their Leather. They have alfo a great Trade for Soap, and for feveral other Commodities ; the Merchants repairing thither from all parts of the World. For not to fpeak of the Turks, Arabians, Per flans, Indians, there are feveral Engftfh, hfr Hans, French, and Hollanders, every Nation having their Conful to carry on their In- terefts, and maintain their Priviledges. Nor does this place happ’n to be fo great a Mart, through the convenience of the two Rivers of Tigris and Euphrates, as fome have writt’n; by which they fay foch vaft quantities of Commodities are tranfported and imported out and into the City. For had that been, I (hould never havecrofs’d the Defert, coming from Bagdat to Aleppo ; nor at another time, going from Aleppo to ‘Balfara, And as for Euphrates, certain it is, that the great number of Milk built upon it, to bring the Water to the neighbouring Grounds* have not only render'd it unnavigabk, hut mdc it very dangerous. ; .1 ooli 1 #( ''Hitt '*•'4 Sllfol, 'Vi, Of lid 'Ofll, 3 tco?eiij OOtll of t World | ’dtliel!

As for Tigris, it is not navigable hill beyond Babylon down to Ba/fira, where you may take Water, and be at,in nine cays. But the Voyage is very inconvenient, for at every Town wdiich the have upon the River, you muft be hal’d, ancl be forc’d to leave fome Money behind you. Sometimes indeed the Merchants of ATonffuldn^ Bagdat’, and others that come out of Chaldea to Trade at Balfara, carry their Goods by Water from Bagdat-, but in regard the Boats are only to he tbw’d by Men, it takes them up a Voyage of feventy days. By this you may judge of the time and expence of carrying Goods by W ater up the River TMpJrrates to Bir where they are to be unlad’n for Aleppo. In fhort, if the convenience of Morat-fm (for fo the Turks ca\\ Euphrates) were to be had, and that Goods might be tranfported by that River, the Merchants would never take that way: for the Arabian Princes, with their People an 1 their Cattel lying all the Summer long upon the Banks of the River, For the fake of the Water and the Grafs, would make the Merchants pay what Toil they pleas’d them- fefves. , ; I faw an Example of this, coming one time from Babylon to Aleppo. In all which Road we met but with one of thofe Arabian Princes, who lay at Anna : yet he made us pay for every Camel’s Load forty Piafters. And which was wo/fe, he detain’d us above five Weeks, to the end his Subjedb might get more of our Money by felling us their Provifions. The laft time I pafs’d the Defert, I met another of thefe Arabian Princes together with his Brother, both young Men : He would not-' let us go a ftep farther, unieis we would exc hange two hundred Piafters in fpecie for Larins, the Money of the Country ; and he forc’d iis to take them what ever we could urge to make it appear how much wefhould lofe by them. And indeed we faid as much as we could, for the difpute lafted two and twenty days to no purpofe * might overcoming right. By this you may guefs what the other Arabians would do’ who are not a jot more civil ; and whether the Merchants would get by taking the Road of Euphrates. The City is govern’d by a Baft)a, who commands all the Country from Alexan- dretta to Euphrates. His Guard ufudly confifts of three hundred Men, and fome years ago he was made a Vizier. There is alfo an Jga or Captain’qf the Cavalry, as well within the City as without, who commands four hundred Men. There is another Aga who has under him feyen hundred Jamjaries, who has the charge of the Gates of the City 3 to whom the Keys are carry'd every Evening, neither has he anydependance upon the Bajha.~ The Gaftle is alfo under another Commander^ fent immediately from Conftantinople, who has under him two hundred Musketeers, and likewife the charge of the Cannon; of which there are about thirty Pieces v eight great Guns, the reft of afmallfize. There is alfo anctherW^ or Captain of the City, who commands three hundred Harqdebuzes •, hcfide r Sou-Ba/hi, who is a kind of Provoftof the Merchants, or.Captain of the Watch, going the round every Night with his Officers though the City and Suburbs. He aifo puts in Execution the Sentences of the Bajha, upon Criminal Offenders. In Civils there is a Cadi, who fits foie Judge, without any Afliftants, of all Caufes as well Civil as Criminal *, and when he has condemn’d any Man to Death, he fends him to the Bafia, together with his Accufation, with whom the ^4^ does as he pleafes. This Cady makes and diffolves all Contrafts of Marriage *, all Afts of Sale and Purchafe pafsin his prefence. He alfo creates thefworn Mafters of every Trade, who make their infpeaion that there may be no deceit in the Work. The Grand Signors Duties are receiv’d by a Tefterdar, or Treafurer-General, who has under him feveral Receivers in divers places. In matters of Religion, the A/fufti the Chief, and the Interpreter of the Law, as well in relation to the Ceremonies, as in all Ecclefiafticai differences. Among thefe Interpreters of the Law there is a Chieke or Dodtor, appointed to inftrudl thofe that arc newly converted to Mahnmetanijm^ and to teach them the Maxims and Cu- ftomsof their Religion. Three days after I arriv’d at Aleppo 7 Sultan Amur at made his Entry, going to H 2 * his 55 &gt; if /i if fo7be Persian ‘I ravels Book II. his Army, which was upon its march to the Siege of Babylon. Now yourauft take notice, that not Far from toward the Eaft, there Bands a Houfe inha bited by the Der'vies, which are a Religious Order among the Ti.rh ; though it formerly belong’d to the Monks of St. Bafil, and was a fair Covent. It is Bill i n g ooe { repair, the Walls of the Chambers, Halls, and Galleries being all Marble. ° £|j the Dervies of thisHoufe went half a League From the City, as far as Mount ' tomect the Grand Stgmr ; and the Superiour, at the Head of the reft, having made a Speech to his Highnefs, two 'Dervies came and made their obeifance in particular Which being perform’d, from that place to theCaftleof f6r half an hours march together j they went juft before the Grand Signor's Horfe, turning round continually with all their might, ’till they foam’d again at the Mouth, and dazPd the Eyes of thofe that beheld them. There are fome of thefe Dervies that will turn in that manner for two hours together, and glory in that which we account Folly*; . • C While the Grand Signor ftaid at Aleppo^ the Bdfoa of C^r^came thither with a thoufand Janifaries: And indeed, there never was a fight of Men more adive or better order’d. Every one of them had Scarlet Breeches that reach’d down to their Ancles, with a Turkie-Kobe of Bnglifh Cloth, and a Waft-coat of Calicut painted With feveral Colours. The moft part had Buttons of Gold and Silk^ and as w^ll their Girdles as their Scimitars were adorn’d with Silver. The Bajlu tnafch’d at the Head of this Magnificent Regiment in a modeft Garb *, but the Marnefs of his Horfe was as rich as his Habit leem’d to be carelefs, having fpar’d for no Coft to appear before the Grand Signor in a Barely Equipage. There is a neceflity for a Man to ftay iome time at Aleppo, as well to difpofe of his Affairs, and in expectation 'till the Caravan be ready, unlefs he will venture himfelf alone without a Guide, which 1 have done more than once. And thus much fot Aleppo, next to Conftantinople m&amp;Cayro, the moft confiderable City in all the Tnrkijh Empire. v- ii-11 I.. CHAP. III.

This Caravan, with which I travel’d, fet out upon C/^w^f-day, con fiding of about fix hundred Camels, and four hundred Men, Mafters and Servants together: the being only on Horfe-back, and riding before, to find Water, and convenient places to lodge in. I muft confefs I had the convenience my felf to ride my own Horfe, which I kept all the while I was at Aleppo. A liberty permitted the Franks only at Confiantinopht Brkyrna, and Aleppo for at Damas, Seyde, or Cayro } none but the Confulsare fuffcr’d - - ■ k. to, - 1 - ■ ■■ - -^r- ■r.nrir..._ Chap.

The next day we diflodg’d by day-break, and by noon we came to a place whe e there were five Weils, about five hundred Paces diftant one from the other. The Water was excellent, and caus’d us to r'eplenifh our Borachos : and about fodr a Clock in the Afternoon we lay at a place where there was no Water. The next day near noon we met with two Wells, but the Water wa's not goodi and only the Camels drank of it, there we a lib lodg’d that night. Having now travePd two days m the Defert, I will defenbe it in a few word^. You begin to enter upon it two or three Leagues from Aleppo, where by de grees you meet with nothing but Tents ihftead of Houfes. It ftretchcs out tothe \Vinter-Eaft, all along the Euphrates to Balfara, and the Shoar of the Gulf of Eerfla^ and upon the South to the Chain of Mountains that divides it from Arabia Tetrm and Arabia the Happy. 1 hefe Defcrts are almoft quite thorough nothing but Plains of Sand, which in fome places lye loofer than in others.:, and are hardly pafiable till the Rains are but newly tai’n, and have knit the Sands together. Tis a rare thing to meet with a Hill or a Valley in thefe Deferts ^ if you do, there is as Purely Water, and as many Bufhes as will ferve to boyl a little Rice. For thoughout the whole De- fert there is no Wood to be found} and all the Bavins and Charcoal that you can load upon Camels at will not laft above eight or ten days. Therefore you mufi: take notice, that of fix hundred Camels that pafs through the Defert, there are fcarce fifty laden with Merchandize, which is generally courfe Cloth, fume little Iron Ware, but chiefly black and blew Calicuts, which the Arabians make ufe of without ever whitening them. All the other Camels are only laden with Provifion, and all little enough } fo many People being to travel for fo many days through ib tong a Tra&amp; of Ground where there is nothing in the World to fuftain Life and Soul together. * ' , f v • For the firlt fifteen days travel we met with Water but once in two days, and fometimes not above once in three days. The twentieth day after we fet out from Aleppo, the Caravan lay at a place where there were two Wells, and the Water very good. Every one was glad of the convenience of wafhing his Linnen, and the Ca* ravan-Bajhi made account to have (laid there two or three days. But the News that we receiv’d, caus'd us to alter our Refolutions. For we had no fooner giv’n order to dreL our Suppers, when we faw a Courier with three &gt; 4 ^, all mounted upon Dromedaries, who were fent to carry, the news of the Taking of Babylon to and other Cities of the Empire. They Hop’d at the Wells to let their Beafts drink*, and immediately the and the principal perfonsof the Caravan made them a fmall Prefentof dry’d Fruits and Granates. Who thereupon were fa kind as to tell us, that the Carriage which carried the Baggage belonging to the Grand Signor arid his Train being tyr’d, his Officers would be fare to feize upon ours, if they fhould chance to meet with us: they advis'd us moreover not to come near Anna, left the Smir fhould flop us. Upon this news, we departed three hours after midnight*, and keeping dire&amp;Iy to the South, we put our fdves into the midft of the Defert. Eight days after we came to lye at a place where were three Wells, and three Or four Houfes. We fiaid there two days to take frefh Water, and we were juft fetting forward again, when thirty Horferaen well mounted came from one of the Emirs, to tell the Caravan Bajlji that he muft Hop his Caravan. We ftaid impa tiently for him three days} and at length he came, arid was prefented by the Cara* van-BaJhimth apiece of Satin, half a piece of Scarlet Cloth; and two large Cop per Cauldrons. Now although thofe Cauldrons could not but be very acceptable to an Arabian Prince, who moft certainly had none fuch in his Kitchin, vet he did not feem contented with his Prefent, and demanded above four hundred Crowns We contefted feven or eight days to have kept our Money in our Pockets, but in vain, fo that we were forc’d to rate one another, and toraifehim hisSum*, which bein^ piid, he treated the chief of the Caravan with Pilaw, Honey, and Dates, and when he went away, give them five or fix Sheep ready boyl’d. Three days after we had left this Arabian Prince, we met with two Wells near certain old decay’d Brick Buildings. The Water of thofe Wells was fo bitter, fhat the Camels would not drink it: however we fill'd our Bor actio's , thinking7 he Persian Travels Book II. it would have left its bitterneis by being boy I'd : but we found the contrary From thole two Weils that were good for nothing, we travePd fix days before we met with any Water, which with their three days before, made nine •, and all that time the Camels never drank, as I have hinted already. At the end of nine days we crofs’d a Billy Country for three Leagues together, at the feet of three of whiqh Hills there were three {landing Pools. The Camels, that line It the Water half a League off, put themfelves upon their great trot, which is their manner;of runnino and no fooner came to the Pools but they crouded in all together, which caus’d the Water to be thick and muddy. Thereupon the Caravan-BafLi icfoVd to ftay there two or three days together, Till the Water wasfetPd. Here we had alfothe opportunity to boyl us fome Rice, there being good (lore of Bufhes that grew about the Lake. But above all, the People were overjoy’d that they had’ an opportunity to make Bread, which they do after the following manner. Firft thtydig around Hole in the Ground, half aFootdeep, and two or three in diameter, which they I croud full of Bufhes, and then fet them on fire, coveringthem with Bricks or Stones ’till they are red hot. in the mean while they prepare their Dough upon a Scfr^ or round piece of Copper, which ferves at other times for Table and Table-Cloth to eat upon. Then they take away the Afhes and Bricks, and making the Hole very dean, put in their Dough, and covering it again with the hot Bricks or Stones, leave it fo Till the morning. The Bread thus bak’d is very well tailed, not being above two Fingers thick, and as big as an ordinary Cake. While we flay’d at the three Ponds, I {’pent my time in killing Hares and Par- tridge, of which there was very great plenty in thole parts. The night before wc departed we fill’d our Baracko's again, the Water being very good and clear; though it be nothing but Rainwater preferv’d in thofeCavides, whi.h in the Sum. rner are dry again. But now the Caravan-Bajhi y feeing we had travel’d already nine days without finding any Water, refolv’d to leave the South, and to keep to the Well; and if he met not with Water in two or three days, to take to the North-Eaft, or Winter-Eaft, in quell of the River Euphrates. Two days after we had chang’d our Road, wc pafs’d between two little Hills, . where we met with a Pond* near to which were two Arabians, each with his Wife and Children, tending a Herd of Goats and a Flock of Sheep. They toldusthey were going toward Moujful, and put us in the beft Road to find Water *, and indeed, from that place to Balfara, we never travelM three days together, but we met with enough. • ' ‘ Five days after we had left thofe two Arabians, we difeov'er’d a large Palace all of Brick; which fhew’d fome probability, that the Country had been formerly fow’d, and that the Bricks had been but nt with the Straw. To the Palace belong’d three large Courts*, in every one of which were fair Buildings, with two Stories of Arches, j one upon another. Though this large Pile was Handing, yet no body liv’d in it, nor could the Arabians, (very ignorant in Antiquity,) tell us by whom it was built. Before the Gate of the Palace there is a Lake with a Channel, the bottom whereof is brick’d, as alfo the Arch, which iscven with the Ground. This the Arabianshdwt to have been a conveyance of Water from Eapbrates: which lurely could never be, in regard that Euphrates is above twenty Leagues diftant. From that Palace we kept to the North-Eaft, and after we had travel’d five days, we arriv’d at a pitiful Town, formerly call’d now Afeched-Ali, whereof) AiahomeCs Son in-law lyes buried in a plain Mofyuee. Generally there Hand four . Tapers lighted about the Tomb, and certain Lamps burning over-head, whichare faflen’d to the Roof. Though the Perfians have AH info much veneration, yet tl^ey rarely go in Pil grimage to his Tomb. The reafon is, becaufe that there being no waytocoraeat it, but through BagAat, which is under the Dominion of the Great Turk, thercis a demand of eight Piafters from every Pilgrim; which is an Impofition thatnoway pleafes theKing of Per ft a. Sha- Abas Homing the t his Subje&amp;s fhould be tributary to the Turks? endeavour’d to divert them from this Pilgrimage by another fort of Devotion, which he fet up at upon the Road from Tauris to Candahar.

For befides the Lamps and Tapers that burn continually, there are only two MoulUh's that read the Alcoran according to cuftom. In this Town there are only three or four bad Wells of brackilh Water, and a dry Chanel, which they fay made to bring the Water of Euphrates to the Town for the benefit of the Pilgrims AsforFoodp we met with nothing but Dates, Grapes, and Almonds, which the People fold at a dear rate.

Two days journey from Ali\ Town, bynineof the Clock in the morning we met two young Arabian Lords, that took upon them the name of They were two Brothers, one of the age of feventeen years, the other of thirteen-and as we pitch’d our Tents, they pitch’d theirs dofe by us; which were of a very fine Scarlet Cloth ; and among the reft there was one cover'd with Purple Velvet lac’d with a rich Galoon-lace. .10 foonas they were fettl’d in their Tents, the Caravan- Bajhi and I went to wait upon them; who underftanding that there were Frankt in the Caravan, ask’d me whether 1 had any Curiofities to fell them-, but when f made them anfwer that I had nothing worthy their Purchafe, they would not believe me, and therefore commanded the Caravan Bajhi to fetch my Trunks that they might be open’d in their prefence. While the were opening, one of the chief perfons about thole Princes would not fuffer any of the reft of the slrabs to come near, for though moft of the Arabs are great Thieves, yet fome of them are perfons of great integrity. Now 1 had in my company a young Painter who had in his Cheft fevcral engrav’d Cuts, part Landskips, part Figures, together with the Pictures of certain ( ourtiLns drawn to the Waft. The young Lards made choife only of twenty of thofe Courtifans, which I would have prefented to them but they gave me to underftand, that they knew how to pay for what they had’ and efpecially the youngeft, who feem’d to be very generous; him I pleas’d in art extraordinary manner; tor his Teeth being very foul, I order’d a Chirurgeon that I carry’d along with me at the fame time to clean them, which he did to the erea&lt;- fatisfaftion of the young Prince. Thereupon they fent me and my Train, of their beft Victuals they had. The Caravan Bajhi prefented them with half a piece of Scarlet, and two pieces of Tiflue of Gold and Silver. When we were ready to co the young Sultan gave me twelve Ducats for my Pictures, and fent the Caravan Bajhi and my fell' two Frails of the beft Dates that we had met with fince we left Aleppo. t About midnight the Princes diflodg’d, and took to the North toward Euphrates We let forward after them, driving Northward toward the fame River After we had travel’d four davs we met one of the moft potent Dmi-r of who coming from the Smith, and going Northward, was to crofs the Road that we kept He was about fifty years of age, well made, and of a comely prefence. He had not then above two thoufand Horte, of thirty thoufand which we heard ’had pafs’d bv fome days before. Behind the two thoufand Hotfe were fifty Camels that carrv’d his Women ; their Cajavas being cover’d with Scarlet-cloth fring’d with Silk In the midft of thd'e Camels there were fix encompafs’d with Eunuchs, the Fringes of theCajavas being Silk, Silver, and Gold. The ^Arabians do not feem to be jealous of their Wives, as in Turkje and other places-, for they led their Camels by our Caravan, never requiring us to rejire, as is the cuftom in other places. They lodg’d a quarter of a League off, where we thought to have pitch’d, for the conveniency of two or three Ponds, which they depriv’d us of. This Arabian Prince had a great number of lovely Horfes richly harnefs’d; others he had that were neither iadl d nor bndl d, yet the Riders would turn them with a Wagd which way they pleas d, and upon a full gallop would flop’em, by only holding them by th« Hair Hchad feme Horfes of an exceffive price; and this is to be obferv’d, that they are never inoa. J The Caravan-Bajhi believing he could not cfcape fcot-free from fo powerful a Prince, among the Merchants of the Caravans found out a rich Saddle, with Bridle and Stirrups, which were all fet out and garniih’d with mafly Silver, with an embroider’d‘The Persian Travels Book II. embroider’d Quiver full of Arrows, together with a Buckler, the whole coming to about eleven or twelve hundred Livers*, and adding to thefe of his own apiece of Scarlet, four pieces of TiiTue of Gold and Silk, and fiK pieces oi Tilfue of Silver and Silk, made a Prefent of all together to the Emir. But he refus’d all, demanding only two hundred thoufand Piajiers for Larins : which exchange being no way for the Merchants profit, rais’d a great difputc. But at length, confidering that it was in his power to ftop and ftarve us there, we only endeavour’d a Compofition •, which was obtain’d. Thereupon he took the Prefent, which perhaps he would not elfe have done. For two days that we (laid to weigh the Money, he fent Pfovifions to the chief of the Caravan •, and at our departure, he fent m twelve Frails of Dates, and I four young Camels'that might be worth about forty Crowns a-piece. , Two days after we rnet a Schekj, who among the Arabians is one of the chief of •the Law. He was going to Mecca, crofs feme part of Arabia the Happy, with a t Train of ten or twelve Camels. He flaid all night with us, and one of his Servants having beendangeroufly wounded about two days before with a Musket-bullet, ray Chirurgeon dreft him, and gave him Salve and Tents, for which he was extreamly thankful He fent me to Supper a great Difb of Pilaw, and the next day a whole Sheep. The Caravan-Bafln Iikewife prefented him with two Ells of Scarlet. The next we met with nothing worth obferyation, but the day following we met another Emir, of about Five and Twenty years of age, who came from Euphrates , and was travelling into the Hap^y Arabia. He had with him about five hundred Hotfe, and three hundred Camels that carry’dhi^ women. Hepre- fenlly Cent to know what Caravan it was, and under (landing that it confifted of ' many Franks, among whom their was a Chirurgeon : He fent again to delire the Caravan Eajhi to follow with the Caravan, to the place where he intended to pitch his.Tents, which was not far out of the tvay. We did not think to have gone fo Li that day, but he led us to the beft water in all the Defert., The Princes Tent being fet up, he fent for my Chirurgeon , with whom 1 went along to know what his pleafure was. He had upon his left Arm a Tetter, with a mod filthy Scab as broad as a Crown pieces and this went and came at certain times in the year. He prefently ask’d the Chirurgeon whether he could cure him ? to whom the Chirurgeon made anlwer* that the cure was not impofiible, provided he knew where to get fuch remedies as were convenient: For had he laid, he cOuli have abfo- lately cur’d him, the Emir would have carry’d him away with him, withont any farther Ceremony. Thereupon he would have giv’n the Chirurgeon five hun- drcdCrownsto have bought Medicines. But I made anfwer, that the cure would not ceft fo much, and that if the Chirurgeon could meet with proper Drugs, I would lay out the Money my fell The content with that anfwer, fentoric of bis chief People to Batjara, to come back with the Chirurgeon, when he had , bought his Medicines. He himfelf (laid there three days in cxpe&amp;ation of him; but | after we had pretended to feck for what we wanted, up and down the Town (for we enquir’d for fuch thingsas we knew were not to be had) we fent him back word that vye could not find what we look’d for, ancPdefir’d his excufe, in regard | the attendance of the Chirurgeon would be of no ufe, where he had not proper ;• remedies j which was the only way we could think of, to get cleverly rid of him, niU ■ : . . &lt; • - J . . . A The next days Journey after we had left the Arabian Prince, was through a Country altogether uninhabited; but the day following, which was the fixty- fifth and lad day of our being in the Defert, we met after fome time, with the ruines of fame houfes on both Tides the way • which made us eonjc&amp;urc, that fo®e great City had flood formerly in that place. At length we came to Balfara, which I (hall deferibe in another place. While I flay’d at Balfara, which was about three weeks, an Ambaflador the Great Mogul arriv’d there, who from Conflantinople went to Bagdat to congra tulate the Grand Signor for the Conqueft of that City, which he had taken k 1 * 0 fhort a time. The Emperour prefented him with three flately Horfes, and alittk Watch, the Cafe whereof was fet with Diamonds and Rubies. But the Ambai- fader not knowing what belong’d to that little Engin, winding it up the wrong way, broke the ftring. Coming to he fent to the to defire them IQ mend his Watch-V for he fear’d the lofs of his head, (hould he return to fos.III. tf/Monfieur Tavernier. Mafter, and notfliewhim the Watch entire. It was at their Home that 1 then lav* and therefore not knowing what to do with it, they ciefirU me to (hew my skill: Thereupon I put on a new iTring. But the Anjbaijador, when he urideiftood to whom he was beholding, though it were but a trifle, profer’d me all the fervice and kindnef| imaginable. Thereupon the Carmelites and Jaguflin Fryars defir’d me to requefl of the Ambaflador in their behalf, that he would obiain the Great Turks proteaion for them , in cafe he took Balfara , that their Houfes and Churches might be preferv'd ; which I did, and obtain’d by his means full pro- te^ion from the Grand But they had norffeed of it, For the did not make any attempt upon Baljara, hearing, that the were advancing ^ befldcs that the rainyYeafon was at hand, which will not permit an Army to keep the Field : So that had Bagdat held out eight days longer, the Grand Signor would have beeri cqnftrain’d to have rais’d the Siege* Having fpoken oi the Arabian Horfes, I mufl: needs fay, that there are fome that are valu’d at a very high rate. The Mogul's Ambaflador gave for fome tbee 3 four, and fix thoufand Crowns, and for another he offer’d eight thoufand Crowns ’ but the Horfe would not be fold under ten, and fo he left it. When He wafcgot home into the Indies, and had prefented the Mogul thbfe Horfesrwhich he had carry’d along with him, being very lovely Creatures ^ he told his Mailer how he had offer’d ejght thoufand Crowns for a Horfe more beautiful than any of them } but becaufe the Owner would not let 111111 go under ten, he left him. The King incens’d that his Arabaflador has flood for* fo.lmali a Sum, when it was for one of the greateft Monarchs in the World, upbraided the poornefs of his Spirit, and banifh’d him for ever from his prefen.ee, into a Province far diftant from the Court. Thereupon the King wrote to the EngUjh to buy him the Horfe, who accordingly did fo, and brought him to Surat, where the Governour-repaid them their Money. But the Horfe dy’d at Brampour. Nor mufl I forger, that while I was at Balfara, twice there flew by fuch a pro digious number of Locufts, that a far-off they appear’d like a Cloud, and darkn’d the Air. They pafs by Baljara four or five times in the year, the Wind carrying them into the Deferf, where they alight, and moft certainly dye. Should they not be thus wind-driv’n, there could nothing live upon the Earth in fome parts of Chal dea They fwarm all along the Terfian Gulf, and when the Veffels come to Ormus at the time of the year, there are little Shops where people fell Locufts fry’d in Butter to thofe that love that fort of Diet. Once I had the curiofity'to open the Beliy of a Locuft fix Inches long, and found therein feventeen little ones that Itirr’d* whence it is eafie to guefs how thofe Infeas come to be fo numerous, efpeciaUv in hot Countries. ' : J There are feveral Barks that go from Ormm to furnifli both (ides of the Terfian, Gull, where the people eat neither Bread nor Rice. I agreed with the Mafler of P n&lt; i Barks, and made my agreement that the Bark fhould not be above halt laden; for generally they lade them too deep, and in foul weather they are forc’d to throw half the Fixight over-board, to*fave the refl. From Balfara to the mouth of the River Euphrates, it is reck’nd to be twenty Leagues of Frefh-water. We (laid feven whole days for a Wind, which proving favourable, we came to Brander~ric, ih forty-eight hours. This is the place where you muft land, if you intend for Perfia, uhlefsyouare bound for Ormus.

To the lame place come Affes lad n with Dates, which I was forc’d to hire for want of Horfes. We were fix days upon the Road from thence to CaiLerom. This is a Mountainous ountry, where there is Wood enough ^ but you muft lodge in the Fields, for P er r e '0 Inns upon the Road. The way is pleafant in fome places, along the i r ~ s 0 - evera ^ RRulets, and through verdant Groves ftor’d with great quantities ? ? urt e ®* kill’d a good many* which we eat, part with Pilaw, inftead of rienns; lome we rofted, making Sticks to ferve for Spits; Caz.trom is a little Gity ill built, where there is but one Inn, and that none of the /ho t mvitmg to Strangers neither. From Caz-erom to Schiras it is five days journey. *The Road lyes over very craggy W ^ Mountains,Ik Persian Travels Book II,- Mountains, Which had been impafTable, but for the Liberality of M CouU-Km Governour of Schirtts. He made Ways where there were none before, and joyn’l Mountains together by Bridges, in Countries which otherwife had been inacceffible In the midftof the Mountains is a wide gap or difcontinuance, from whence a Plai extends it felf of about twenty Leagues in circuit. It is inhabited by y^onlv who are Silk-Weavers. In cheie Mountains you met with Tents, where the Chal]' ms fojourn, that come for cool Air and Pafturagc in the Summer.

Three days journey fr&lt;am Schirl/vL pafs the Mountain of Mayen, a little City where there is nothing worthy obferva- tion. Two days journey from thence you enter upon the Plains of the Province of Cafcuzar , whefe the King of Perfia keeps his Race-Horfes. The next davl arriv’d at Yejdecas^ where the bed: Bread in Per fid is made. This is a little City U po n a Rock, wherein there is a very fair Inn : at the foot whereof runs a little River that glides into the Valley, wherein grows that excellent Corn which is utter’d in Rrearl from that City. In three days I went from Ye[deciu to ifpahatt. This was the fir ft Road from A- leppo to Jfpahan. C HiA P. IV. Of the 'Road from Aleppo to Ifpahan, through Mefopotamia and Aflyria, which I traVeWd in my third Voyage to the In. dies. Departed from Paris in my third Voyage to the Indies upon the fixth of -Dccewfor 1643, and went ioLigom, where I found the T) 0 th Fleet ready to fet Sail for the Levant. The Veflel wherein I embark’d feeming rathera . Man-of-War than a Merchant-Man. W£ pafs’d through the Chanel of Mejfma, and lay there at an Anchor four days before the City. From thencepaf- fmg by the Morea, we enter’d into the Archipelago, where the Fleet parted, ac cording as every Ship Was bound. Our Ship fayl’d dire&amp;ly for the Port of AIcxm drelta, but though the Wind were favourable, we were ftop’d for feme time by a Pirate that met with us off the Eaftern Point of Candy. We endeavour’d to have got dear of him} but the Pirate gaining upon us, we made ready. Thereupon the Pirate gave us three Broad-fides, that went over the Ship without doing us any harm: which we anfwer’d by as many from our Ship, the firft whereof brought his Fore-maft by the Board *, and the third Shot Went through the Fore-caftle and kill’d him fome Men, as far as we could difeern. At that very inftant one of our Mariners cry’d out from the Top-maft-head, A Sail from the South. Thereupon the Pirate left us* and made Sail after her: and we, glad of fuch an efcape, purfu’d our Voyage to Alexandretta, where we happily arriv’d * 7 from whence I took Horfe fot Jlcffo, as I have already deferib’d. The fixth of March I departed from Aleppo in the company of two Capuchin Friars, Father Raphael Father Yves, and the Venetian whofe name was Dminici de Sanflis. From Aleppo to Bir, where you crofs the Cuphraies, it is four days journey for the Hiwfe-Caravan. The Country is well wooded, and well manur’d. Thefeventh of March the great Rains that fell hinder’d us from getting to the ufual Stage, fo that we could not gain Te/^cW, another Town, where there is no Inn: which conftrain’d us to ftop a League on this fide, and to go to a Cave that was able to contain three hundred Horfe. This is a Cave where the Bedouins Feeders of Cartel thereabouts oft retire, who live after the'manner of the ArM cither in Rocks or in poor Hutts. The Cave has been hollow’d from time to tiinei there being feveral Niches in it like little Chambers. 4 Dur Caravan-Bafti feeing {meChap. IV. 0/ Moniieur Tavernier. fome Ambufcade, rode thither before to view the place, but finding it em^ty and free, we relied there that night, and the nest night ca ! me to lye at Mtz^ara^ which is only a ftnall Village without an Inn : Neither wa? there any thing remarkable upon that Road. Oaly that near the Cave, in the Mountain, there is very good Water s And formerly upon the Mountain ftood a Caftle, of which fome fuines are ftill re maining. From the top of the Mountain there is a fair Profpeift as far as you can fee* over very fair Plains on every fide, and in ieveral places very gooa Land, water'd by divers Channels which are brought from the River Euphrates. All the Rivolets alfo that you crofs from Aleppo to Bir come from the fame River. The fourth day after we parted from Aleppo, being the ninth of March., we came to the banks of Euphrates. Bir is on the other fide of theRiver ^ andbecaufe that fometimes the Goods cannot be unladen all in a day; their is a fair and large Inn, to defend the Merchants from the which would elfe difturb and rob them, were not they and their Goods in that manner fecur’d* 1 s You crofs the Euphrates in large Ferry Boats, and as foon as you are got over the other fide of the River, the Cuftomer and his Odker^comes and tells the Bales, and writes down the names of the Merchants to whom they belong. The Caravan does not lye in the Town, which is built like dx\ JAmphiiheatre upon the brow of a very craggy Mountain, but pafies forward over ;a feurvy Road to an Inn upon the top of the Mountain. Near the Inn there are feveral Chambers p it out of the Rock, where they that cannot get room in the Inn are forc’d to lye. That Evening the Cuftom-OfBcer comes to receive his duties, being two Piaflers upon e ery load of Goods, whether upon Horfe or Mule, though the Mules carry more than the Horfes*, and half a Ptafter for every Bead that carries Provifions. But for Saddle Hotfes or Mules there is nothing demanded. The Bir, or Btrygeon^ as the Natives call it, is a large City for an Eadern City, fituated upon the brow of a Hill. Below upon the River ftands a Cadle that de clares its Antiquity, it its half as long as thie City, but narrow, and without any other Fortification, faving only a Tower that fcours the River, in which there are . eight or nine pitiful Culverins. In the highedpart of the Town dands another Cadle where the Governour refides, who is an Aga, whom fome call a Bajha, having un der him two hundred Janifaries^ and four hundred SpahPs. The City is ill built* as are the mod part of the Cities of Turkic : But there are an extrordmar pi; nty of all things, excellent Bread, good Wine j and great dore of the bed fort of Fi(h. , ‘ ..... _ 4 . ? , The tenth day after we had travePd ekv’n hours In the fird Lands of Mefopo r tamia, that lye between the two Rivers Euphrates and Tigre, which at prefent they call Diarbtki we came in the evening to Sharmley. This is a very good Town, with a fair Inn, and Baths round about it. About twice Mufquet-Shot from thence,’ ftands a Mountain alone by. it felf, like Montmartre near Paris : Round about it are Plains, and at the top of it ftands a Fortrefs, with a Garrifon of two hundred Spahis, by reafonthat the vMrabs fometimes crofs Euphrates, and make incurfioris upon that fide. In the year 1631, the Grand returning from Bagdat, where he had loft the greateft part of the Grand $ ignores Army, not being able to take the City; fearing the lofs of his head if he return’d to Conftantinople, and knowing himfelf to be in great edeem among the Souldiers, refolv’d to quarter himfelf upop this Mouirain, and to eredt a Fortrefs to feciire himfelf from the temped that threaten’d, him. No doubt but if he could have brought about his deftgn, he might have made himfelf Mafter of all Mefopotamia, and would have put the Grand Signor to a great deal of trouble. For if you intend for Aleppo, whether it be from Tauris, Mojful, or Bagdat, unlefs you travel thorough the Dcfert, you mud pafs through Sharmley, under the command of this Fortrefs, for Provifion and Wa ters fake. The work was gone fo far forward, that there was a good defence ras’d, ahd the Ftfier had already enclos’d all the Mountain together with the Inn, with a Wall almoft twenty foot thick, and three fathom high, when he was ftrangl’d by thofe in whom he mod confided, the Grand Signor having gain'd them either by threats or by rewards. ... _ , .... The eleventh, after a Journey of ten hours we came to. where theC^r^- trrfttufually days eight or ten days; for here it is that they live that hire the Horfes and the Mules, who' have always fome bufinefs in this place. We lay at an Inn .. . / • I 2 ' k threethree or four hundred paces diftant from the C ity toward the North. When the Inn is full, the reft retire into the Grotto’s which are near at hand, and are very good quarters. Here the Toll-gatherer prefently comes and counts the Bales with, out op’ning them. They that carry any Sacks muft pay for half a Load.*, if not, he op’ns the Sack to fee if there be any Merchandife therein, for then the Merchant tnuft pay the whole duty. Ourfa is the Capital City of Mefopotamia^ built as they fay, in the fame place where Abraham liv’d, and where ftood the ancient Edeffa, where the people of the Country report, that King Abdgxnu generally kept his Court. There are ftill to be feen the ruines of a Caftle ; from w'hence they add, that the fame King fent to Ctftf/Sr for his Piaure, and offer’d him his Kingdom and his people to defend him againft the Jews^ whom he underftood to be his Enemies. The Chronicles of the Armcrtiar/s repoitt) that A b agar us was their Country-man, and that in his Reign they began to be Chriftians, and to be Baptiz’d by the hands of an Apoftle, whom CHR IST fent to that Prince after his Refurrettion. Neither is this Caftle yetfo far ruin’d, but that there is (till to be feen a fpacious Hall, and three or four hand- fom Rooms with fome reliefs of Mofaick work. I was curious to fee what ever Was remarkable in this City. And firftthey led me to a large Fountain which rc- fefnbles a Fifh-pond, the Spring whereof is under the Foundations of the principal Mofqttee, which was built in honour of Abraham. The Chriftians of the Conn, try fay, that it was in that place where he pray’d, before he went about toSacrf ficehis Son Ifaac, and that two Springs of Water arofe from the two places where hereftedhis knees, which now feed the large Fountain I have made mention of. It is pav’d with Free, ftone, andfo full of Fifh, that if you throw them in a little Bread, they will follow you from place to place as you walk by the fide of the Pond. There is no medling with them *, for the Turks have a great veneration for thofe Fi(h,which they call Abrahams Fifh. Befides that, the place about the Fountain where the Water wid’ns it felf to water all the City, is cover’d with very fair Carpets, for about twenty paces in bredth* This Fountain at length falls into a little River that runs by the Walls. As for the Grotto where the two Springs rife, there U no going into it before you have pull’d off your Shooes, and it is a great favour for a Chriftian to fee it *, fuch a favour as coft me fix Piafters. I alfo faw the Church, under the portal whereof, they fay, St. Alexis liv’d feventeen years a private life. Itfhnds in the middle of a Church yard, in the higheftpart of the Town, in the poMon of the Armenians. But. their principal Church is about a quarter of an hours walking from the City, built by St. Apkm?, who is there buried. The Monaftery • (lands yet entire, enclos’d with fair Walls. In the Church I faw a large Bible in Armenian Charafters. The Sepulchre of St. Ephren is in a Cave at the foot of the Mountain, to which there alfo belongs a Chappcl, where they keep three or four Lamps continually burning. There are other up and down the Mountain, where are to be feen very ancient Sepulchers of the Chriftians. The City o\ 0 w\^ j isfeated in a good foil, very well manur’d, which extends it felf out of fight to ward the Eaft. There are feveral pleafant Gardens near the walls, water'd by little Channels brought thither by Art. The foil produces good Wine, fothat , a man may live as well at Ourfa y as in any part of Turkic. While I flay’d there, I kill’d abundance of Feldfares in thofe Gardens; and indeed there is great ftore of wild Fowl all the Country over. The Walls of the City are of Freeftone, with Battlements and Towers*, but within, the houfes are fmall, ill built, and ruinous: And there are feveral void fpaces in the City, which makes Ourfa to look rather like a Defert than a Metropolis. -The City is Govern’d by a who has under him a hundred and fifty Janifaries^ and fix hundred Spahi's, Handing more in need of Cavalry than Infantry, by reafon of the Incurfions of the Arabians y efpecially in harveff time. In fhort, Ourfa is the place where they drefs fuch great quantities of Cordovan Skins, by reafon of the waters particular to the Country, which give them that peculiar beauty. The Yellow Skins are dreft at Ourfa y the Blew at Tocat) and the Red at Diarbtquir. The twentieth of March, wefetoutof Ourfa, and after a Journey of fix hours, we lay at a pittiful Village where the Inn was fain all to decay. There is a Foun tain of excellent water by it, which is all the convenience of the place, for there is no Provifion to be had. ^ ** &gt; Thei okll ff’il Ct H; i, ate 8ii ™§ft« ,et0 kk '^loniclfjjj ^hisR(| °j|l e 5 wli Caftlc^j )r four hi fe wfetft in whliK the priii(| )f 5out toSjol &gt; places wIk nentiono[| alittfeBtoi ^nd, Tin nfe Fidi# ain where i ’ Carpets,!: ttle Riven! ere knogi for a Chi ch, under I life.

' 1 ■ 1 The twenty-hrft we travei’d nine hours, and came to lye near fcveral Caverns which are very deep *, at the /ntry whereof there are little RopuiS, which arelup- pos’d to be the places where the People of the Country liv’d that fed their Cattel thereabouts. There is alfo Rain-Water to be had in fome of the Concavities of the Rock. Half this days journey you muftpafs over Rocks, where it is almoftimpof- fible, and very dangerous to keep your Horfes back. The twenty fecond, having travePd elev’n hours, we lodg’d near a Cavern, having forded a River that runs at the foot of it. There are two great Giotto's on each fide where Travellers take tap their Quarters , and whither the Natives of the Country bring Provifions both for Horfe and Man. The Toll-gatherers, coming from a Fort about three Leagues diftant from thefe Caverns, here exa&amp; iwo Tiafiers and a half for every Horfe and Mules Load and fearch your Sacks, to fee if there be no Merchantable Goods therein. About half the way of this days journey you meet with a City quite deferted by the Inhabitants *, and about an hours march after that, with Tombs of Stone, in the middle whereof (lands a Crofs, with Armenian Chz- * The twenty-third we travel’d elev’n hours, and lay at 'Dadacardw. This appears to have been a great Town, but is all ruin’d: nor is there any thing remaining but a long S:one ridge very well built, under wdiich runs a River that is very broad when it overflows. The People of the Country have no other Habitations than the Hollows of Rocks *, yet they bring to the Travellers Hens, Butter, Cheeie, and other Provifions ? which they fell very cheap. The twenty-fourth we travd’d nine hours, and lay at a place call’d Cara, built Upon a KUi. The Caravan lay at the Inn-, but the two Capuchins and I lay at a private Chriftian’s Houfe, who carry’d us to the Church, where was then thcVer- tabet or Bilhop of CMerdin. It was a pitiful poor Church, where they had nothing but two Planksfuppprted with four Sticks inftead of an Altar. They dare not leave any Furniture in it, but asfoon as the Prieft has faid Service, he muft have a care to take away every things as well the Planks as the Covering of the Altar, which was only a Painted Cloth -.‘For the Turks that travel that way, if it be foul weather, will break open the Door, put their Horfes there, burn the Altar, and take away whatever they find. &lt;v \. 1 ' ' &lt; . In the Village where we lay, there was a Pond, the fidcs whereof were fuiC rounded with fair Free-ftones, which were fetch’d from the Chriftian Churches, and the Tombs of the Chriftians thereabouts. Among the red, there was one very large Stone, with an Epitaph upon it in large Latin Letters $ whereby wfc knew it to be the Tomb-ftone of a Norman Gentleman, who had been a Captain of Foot. The BHhop inform’d us, that it is recorded in the Armenian Stories, that the French were a long time in this Country, at what time the Chriftians were Mailers of Syria. This Country is all a large Plain, about twenty Leagues in length •, which might be well manur’d, and make the Inhabitants rich, did not the Tyranny of the TVfcr, and fhe Incurfions of the zA^rabs, reduce them to the utmoft degree Of Poverty. The twenty-fifth, after we had travel’d eight hours, we lay at a Village call’d Cbufafar, where there was no Inn. There were formerly three great Monafteries, a quarter of a League one from the other. The Turks have ruin’d two, all but the Steeples of the Churches that belong’d to them. The third, which (lands all entire, and is the faireft Pile of Building, ferves for a Mofquee. They have made Shops' round about the Cloyfters, in the middle of which is a fair Spring of Water. The twenty feventh we lay (lill at Confafar, being the place where you muft pay the Cuftoms of Diarbequir, which is not above two days journey off, amounting to two Tiafters and a iourth part, for every Load of Merchants Goods. ^ , Merdin is not above two Leagues from Coufafdr. This is a little City feated upon a Mountain, with good Walls, and a fair Fountain replenilh’d from the Caftley which (lands upon the North-fide, in a place yet higher, that commands the City ; where there lives a who has under him two Hundred Spahis r and four hun dred Janizaries. Merdin is tfie place where was born the Lady Maani Gioerida 7 the firft Wife of Vietro de la F'alle, fo well known for his famous Travels. As for Coufafar^ which is a large Village, it is inhabited for the mod part by Ar* me man Chnftians and Neftorians. The Armenians perform Divine Service in theic pwn Language*, the Neflorians in the Chaldaic. The latter (h^w d me twoBiblps jnThe Persian Travels Bookll in a large Volume, in the fame Language, writt’n in Vellum, all the CapitaTCtr’ being in Gold and Azure.

When Service is done, they put them ina Cheft, and hide them Ground, I would have giv’n 200 Piafters for the oldeft, but they durft not f 11 ^ in regard it belong’d to the Church, and was not at their difpofaJ. C !t) The twenty-feventh, after we hadtravei’d nine hours, we arriv’d at Kard ■ which had been formerly a great Town, and no doubt inhabited by Cbriftians • ^ •appears by feven or eight Churches half ruin’d, though the Steeples are little’th 5 worfe. They (land at a good diftance one from the other*, and upon the North fid 2 of one of thole Churches there is a Gallery, at the end whereof, through a M Door you defeend about a hundred Steps, every Step being ten Inches thick. Whe 6 you come under the Church, you meet with a larger and bigger Vault, ftipported with Pillars. The Building is fo contriv'd, that there is more light below than in that above *, but.of late years the Earth has Hop’d up feveral Windows. The great Altar is in the Rock *, on the right fide whereof is a Room, which receives the light from feveral Windows contriv’d in the Rock. Over the Gate of the Church was a great Free-ftone, wherein were certain Letters that I could notread. On the NorthTide of the fame Church under Ground are to be feen two great Cifterns each four hundred and fifty Paces long ; with two great Arches, fuftain’d with feveral Pillars. Every year they fill them with the Water that falls from the next Mountain and makes a kind of a River. A quarter ofa League from the Church, you defeend the Mountain for above a hundred Paces together.among the Rocks, on each fide whereof are Rooms cut out of the Rock, Upon every Door there is a Crofs-and in every Room as it were a Bench, and a Table, with a little place about the length of a Man, like a Bedded, all cut out of the Rock. At the bottom of theRockis a Hall, round about the Wall whereof is a Bench to fit on. The Roof is all plain without any Arch y in the middle whereof there is a Hole to the top of theMoun! tain : but in regard it gives no Hght, ’tis very probableTwas only made to let out the Smoak when they dreft their Meat y or elfe tolet in thefrefh Air, as I have feen in many Villages ..upon the POrgan Gulf. Upon the higheftof thofe Mountains Hands a paltry Village, where they buy their Viftuals. But before the Caram arrives, certain Merchants ride before to inform themfelves from the Herdfmen whether they-know of any Thieves in the Grotto's, that often hide themfelves there in expedition of Prey. In the year 163^) Sultan Arnurat going to befiege Babylon) march’d this very wnyj as well to fee thefe Ruines, as to give order for the demolifliing a Fort that flood not above two Leagues off of Karagera^ which the Thieves of the Country made their place of retreat He alfo at the fame time caus’d the Road to be clear’d for four days journey, by ordTing the Stones to be pickt up and laid in heaps, all along the Road. He alfo built a Bridge over the River. And indeed, that March of the Grand Signer was very advantageous to all Travellers thatpafs this way. The twenty-eight we travel’d eight hours, and came to Nesbitt) anciently B fibvs. Two or three hours travel on this fide, near the Road, is a kind of Hermitage, being a fmall Room enclos’d with Walls, the Door whereof isfo low, thataMan muH creep upon his Belly to get in. Three or four ymu went and perform’d their Devotions at this Hermitage, believing it to be the place where the Prophet £li^ was buried. ; . : . The Country from Coufafar to Nesbin is a large Plain, where for the firft days journey you (hall fee no other green Herb upon the Ground but only Pimpernel 5 the Roots whereof are fo large, that there are feme a Foot and a half in diameter. The next day, tne Fields arc cover’d with a large thick Leaf, the Root whereof is bulbous, and as bi£ as an Egg. There are alfo great Hore of yellow, red, and violet Flowers, Tulips of feveral colours, Emonies, and fmgle Daffadillies. Bot in general Mefopotamta is a very barren Country, and there are very few places that can be better’d by Art or InduHry. Nesbitt is only the Shadow of the ancient Nifibis, being now only a large Village; the Inhabitants whereof are ChriHians, both ^Armenians and Nefiorians. OmCa* ramn lodg’d a little beyond, in a Church-yard adjoyning to one of the Armenian Churches.

When .service Was done, after fome few Complinients' between us, he led us down under the Church into a Chapel, where he (hdw’d us the Sepulcher of St. Janies Bifhop of Nifibis. In the Church yard is a Stone about a Foot thick, and fix high *, upon which were laid feverai Candles of Waxand Tallow, which the Poor offer in their Neceffities* but efpeckliy in their SicknefTes. They believe that Stone to have been the Pecieftal for the Statue of fome Saint, which the Turks have defac’d: fo that they give the fame Honour to the Pedeftal, as they would have gtVn to the Statue. There arc alio fome Roman Chara&amp;ers to be feen, but half worn out, and (paces brok’n off in fome parts: fo that I could not learn, in Honour of whom that htatue wa^ erected. Half a League from Ntibin runs a River, which you crofs over a Stone-Bridge. Iri the way to the River are (everal pieces of Wall, with an Arch, which made me Con jecture, that formerly the City extended as far as the River. Twice Musket-fhot from the River you meet with a Stone half buried, upoit which are written certain Latin Words; whereby it appears that it was the Tomb- ftoneof the Genera! of an Army that was a French-man: but I could not read his Name, which time had defac’d. The fame Bifhop inform’d us, that formerly the CMcors having befieg’d City, there came fuch a prodigious company of ftrange Flyes, and did (b torment both Men and Hories, that they were forc’d to ftrange the Siege. You muft pay the fame Toll at Nisbin as in other places, that is, two Fiaflers and a half for every Mule or Horfcs Load. We lay there three days toge ther, to furnilh our felves with Provifions ’till we came to Moujful, which is five days journey from Nisbin ; the Country between being altogether defert and uninha- * bited. There is no Water to be found but in two places, and that hot very good neither *, near to which you (hall (ce fome few Herdfmen grazing their CatteL The firft of April we departed from Nisbin *, and after We had travel’d eleven hours, we lay near to a River, whither certain Shepherds brought us Hens to fell. The fecond we travel’d ten hours, and lay at a paltry Town, where we met with nothing to eat. V * f The third we travel’d thirteen hours, and lodg’d by a pitiful Fountain, the Water whereof was hardly good enough for our Hories. The fourth we travd’d ten hours, and came to lodge by the Bank of a little River* near to which appear’d the Ruines of a Bridge and a Caftle. The fifth we travel’d eleven hours, to reach Mwjfttl, which is not fat from the ancient Niniveh. &lt; 1 Aioufful is a City that makes a great (hew without, the Walls being of Free-ftone; but within it i$ almoft all, ruin’d having only two blind Market-places, with a little Caftle upon the Tigris, where the Bafha lives. In a word, there is nothing worth a Man’s fight in Moujfal, the place being only confiderable for the great concourfe of Merchants*, efpecially the Arabians anti Curds, whieh are the Inha bitants of the ancient ^JJyria, now call’d Curdifian, where there grows great plenty of Galls, and for which there is a great Trade. There are in it four forts of Chriftians, Greeks, Armenians, Neflorians, and AFaronites. The Capuchins had a pretty Dwelling upon the Tigris •, but the Bajha laying a Fine upon them, becaufe they went about a little to enlarge it, they were for’d to quit it. The City is go vern’d by a Bajha, that has Under him, \&gt;att Janizaries, part Spah?s, about three thoufand Men. There are only two feurvy Inns in Moujful, which being full when we came, I caus’d my Tent to be fet up at the Meydan, or great Market-pLce. Now to fay fomething in general of the difference of the two Rivers^ Tigris an^. Euphrates, in reference to their Courfe arid Waters: I obferv’d that the Water of / Euphrates appear’d fomewhat red *, and that the Stream was not fo fwiftas that of Tigris, which feem’d to be whitifti, like the Loire. As for its Courfe, Euphrates runs a far longer way than Tigris. But now let us crofs the Tigris, over a Bridge of Boats, to view the fad Ruines of a City that has made fuch a noife in the World } though there be nowfcarceany appearance of it's ancient fplendour* Niniveh was built upon the left Shoar of the Tigris, upon jdjfyria-hde, being now only a heap of Rubbidi extending almoft a League along the River.

Entring thus intoTV^, we met with a high Mountain cover’d with fair Oaks, which bear the GallNuts, fo high that the Caravan was Tome hours ere it could get to the top. As we attend- ed but efpecially when we were up, we heard fevgal Muskets go off. At firft we thought the people had been hunting the wild Boars or Stags, o\ which the Moun tains are full: but the report of the Guns being too loud and too thick for Hunters, we flood upon our guard; and I believe we ihould have mended our paces, had we knovyn what was intended us. Befides, I remember’d that the Country people would not fell any thing but for Powder and Bullet, which the Caravm-Bajhi advis’d me not to let them have, for fear they fliould makeufe of it againft our felyes. From the Mountain we defcended into a Ter til Plain, water’d with feveral Rivers*, and night approaching, we fet up our Tents, not fearing any thing, becaufe we were in the Dominions of the King of Perfia, where there is fo much fecurity in travelling. After that we fent our Servants to the Tents of the Country-men, but they brought us nothing but Bread made of Acorns, than which the poor people thereabouts eat no other. This Acorn is about the bignefs of our Nuts; and once I met witha Branch that had thirty Acorns, and twenty-three Gall-Nuts, all at one time growing UP The Province which we travel’d through then, compos’d the greateft part of the ancient jiffyria. But now to come to the Story of Dominico de Santis the F emm, He had Letters of Credence from the Pope, the Emperour, the King of and the Republickof FmcV, to the King of Perfia *, and he went in the Caravan through the Grand %w’s Territories, never difcoveringhimfelf who he was*, but coming into Perfia, he took upon him without fear the Title of Ambalfador from the Commonwealth of F wtice. From the Plain where we lodg’d, it is two days journey to a good big Town, to which belongs a Fortrefs, where the Governour of the Proving has a Lieutenant, with about two thoufand Horfe under his Command. The For%&amp; is upon the right hand toward the South, after three hours riding upon the High-way. lo this Lieutenant, the Caravan-Bafii was according to duty bound to give notice of the Arrival of the Caravan, and an account of the Perfons and their Merchandize. This Venetian was a perfon ill fitted for the quality of an Ambaffador, being a perfon of no Parts •, which made me wonder that fuch great Princes, and fo wife a Commonwealth, (houldfend fuch a perfon upon a Concern of that importance. For the Grand Signor then aflailing Candy, he was lent to excite the King of to engage him in a War againft the^TV^, thereby to keep off the Storm that threaten’d Chriftendom. Thereupon I told the Ambaflador, that it was neceflary for him to give the Commander of the Fort firft notice of his coming, to the end he might give advice thereof to Sotyman-Kan Governour of the Province, whole duty it was to advertife the King. Thereupon he requefted me to fend my Inter- preter, which I did. Upon whofe intelligence the Lieutenant of the Fort came to Compliment the Ambaflador on the behalf of the chief Commander, and to conduct him to the Caftle. ' , , ., r „„ Thereupon the AmbafTador, my feif, and my Interpreter, together with loa Armenian Merchants went with him, travelling for three hours over the Mountains By that time we came half the way , as we pafs’d through a Wood, we hear as it were fome perfon give a Whiftle-, at which when the Lieutenant, perceiv an tobefomewhat ftartfd, he carry’d us to the place from whence the Whittle caM where we faw a Serpent about as big as a Man’s Thigh, and about twelve t long, whofe head was fqueez’d between two Trees, that put him to pai n - / r , that Mountain we defeended into a pleafant Plain, where the Commander o Fortrefs ftaid for us,under his Tent. He had fet it up by the fide of a River, u ^ the (hade of feveral great Walnut-trees. So foon as he faw us, he role trm great 'Silk Tapeftry Coverlet, and faluted us in a moft civil manner, telling affuredly Sha-Jbas, his Mafter, would be very glad to hear that the Monajcn Chriftendomhad fent him an Ambaffador, and that be would write toS X^ whofe duty it was to advertife the Emperour. Thereupon he wrote and dt P ^ away a Meflenger, giving him order to tell the Deroga, or Judge of tn ^ through which we. were to pafs, that he fhould make Provision ° r Horfes’till we tame to the Governour.

( ter he had civilly treated us, he fent his Lieutenant back with us again to the Caravan, About ten a Clock the next night we diflodg’d, and the Lieutenant and fix Soldiers attended upon us \ who told us he had order not to leave us, ’till he had brought, to Solyman Kan.~ The nest night we lodg'd between two Mills, among feveral Tents of Herds meri. Here it was that the Commander had order’d that we fliould be trcatrd by the De~ rega. A Deroga, as 1 have laid, is the Judge of a,Village : But this J}er?g 4 'm&amp; chief of many Families, iome of which wtrctf.Mefopotamia r -othets bt-■■Arabia, Thefe are all Herdfmen that never live in Houfes, but retire with their Ca t e to the holes in the Rocks, where partly Nature, partly Art, have contributed to makt them convenient Habitations. So loon as we were ahgnted, four ancient men came and led the AmbalLdof andi myfelf to the DerogasTcnt. It^feem’d to confifl: of many Rooms, with a Ha]l in the middle, ’ fpread witri Perfian Carpets. He caus’d us to fit down upon Cufhions, and then prclented us with a Pipe of Tobacco, and Water to wafh our Feet. Af ter he had nobly treated us, and that we were upon taking our leaves, the Deroga Was very njjiih troubl’d that we had made a fmall Prefent to his Son ^ telling^ that it was a crimeior him to take any thing of the King’s Guefts, efpeciaHv from Strangers that had come fo long a Journey. The next day we lodg’d in a place where there was fuch a prodigious quantity of Lillies that the Ground was almoft cover’d With them. There were none '■hat- were white, being for the moft part of a fair Violet colour, with a ftreak o- Red. in the middle of every leaf ^ they dre like our Lillies, but much bjggcri And to drink the infufion of the Roots of thefe Lilliesj elpecially thole whofe Leaves are. blackeft, for fifteen days together, is a molt Sovereign remedy agaiml the Pox Not long after came a Perfon of a goodly Aipeft, who feem’d to be an Arabian^ but he 1 poke the Perfian Language, whom Soymun Kan had lent tO;Compliment the Ambafiador. He carry’d us to the Tent which thf Governour had caus’d to be fet up in a Garden near the Town, ' where he alfo Lodg’d the Capuchins. The Ambafc dor alfo fent to Compliment the Kan by my interpreter $ an * when the hour was come that we were to fet forward, he gave order to fix of the Captains of fiis Ca valry to accompany the Ambafiador. The fiou% where the Governourjiv’d in, was one of the moft beautiful in Perfia. And as for the Governour himfeif^ we found him in a Gallery that look’d upon the Garden, the Floor being all fpread over with, Tapeftry of Gold and Silk , with large Culhions of Cloth of Gold all along the. Wall. After fome Queftions and difeourfe concerning the Affairs of Europe, they ferv’d in Supper, which confifled of feveral Dilhes*, but no Wine wtis to be had y our drink being only Sherbet and the juice of Granates, with Sugar for thofe that defir’dit. We were along time at Supper, for’tis the cuftom of Per/£* that when one man riles, another takes his place and falls too, in fo much that the Matter of the Feaft muft have the Patience to flay ’till feveral have tak’n their turns y and when, every one has done, the Cloth is tak’n away without any more to do^ Here the Ambafiador committed an abfurdity • for there are no Silver or Gold Spoons in Perfia, but only long Wooden Ladles that reach a great way. Now the AmbajOTa- dor reaching his Ladle to a Purflane-Difh full of Pottage that was fealding hot,. Clap’d it prefently into his mouth ^ but finding it fo hot that he could not endure it, after feveral feurvy faces, he threw it out of his mouth again into his hand, in the prefence of all the Company. After we had ftay’d five days at Sneirne, the Caravan-Bajhi fignifi’d His defire to furfue his Journey. Thereupon the Ambafiador took his leave of the Governour* prefenting him with a Watch and a pair of Piftols} who in retaliation prefented the Ambafiador with a {lately Horfe, and a Colt of two years old. . The next day we diflodg’d, and purfu’d our Road to Amadan, which is nOt above three days Journey from Sneirne. Amadan is one of the largeft and moft confiderable Cities of ‘Perfia^ feated at the foot of a Mountain, where doarife an infinite company of Springs that do water all the Country.. The Land about it abounds in Corn and Rice, wherewith itinm.ilhp K 2 the‘The Persian Travels Book E the eteateft part of the neighbouring Provinces. Which is the rejfon that fom e of the Ptrfian Stateitnen hold it very inconvenient for the King of /Vp to keep Baodat, as well by r'eaibn of the vaftnefs of the Charge, as alfo for that it draws from Jmadan that which fhoutd fupply other Provinces. On the other fide, it y cafte for the Grand Signer to hold it, by reafon of the neighbourhood ol umia Myri *,and the Arabs ,Enemies to the by which means Prcvi. fions a’re very cheap, which the people would not know where to put off, if the King &gt; of Perfta were Lord of Bagdat. , , n ■ ... We ftaid at Amadan about ten days, by reafon'of the Rains y during Which time the Caravant cannot travel. While we tarry’d there, we were vifited by fevenl Sabyl oman Chriftians, who were glad to fee that we had efcap’d the Clutches of the B T(ha of Baodat, who had giv’n order to the Bajha o( Kark°u, and the % of Sharaffon that corhmands the Fiontiers of Turkic, tofCiz.e us, and carry us back lo gafdat. For which we might have thank’d the Ambaffador, and a malicious that came along with us in the Caravan from Aleffo who finding the Feaft of the Tabernacles to be at hand, and that we had a great way to left us at» vivehy to keep the Feftival with the Jem of Babylon. ^ Where that he might infi. nuatehirafelf iniottitBafia's favour, he inform’d him that there was a Fmguk in the Caravan, whom he look’d upon as a Spy, and that he was an Envoy into frrfin from the Commonwealth of renice .-‘for he carry’d ho Merchandize, btit had three Cherts fail of rich Habits, and feveral other thing?, which he took fotPrefehtsto the Per/tan King. For out of vanity or folly, the Venetian had feveral times open’d his Chert and expos’d his Gallantry to view. And yet he was fo clutch-fifted and niggardly in every thing, that when there was any occafion to reward the Kan\ Ser- vant, of any of the Country-men that brought us the Dainties of the place, it came all out of my Pocket. So that I left him to my Interpreter and the two Ca^ucbm&gt; and with three Servants and a Guide, after I had ftaid at Jmaetan three days, l took Horfe for Jjvahan. . t . When I came there, the Nazar or Mafter of the Kings Houlhold hearing I , had left an Ambaftador behind the with the Caravan, enquir’d of me what manner of Pcrfon lie was, but I pretended I had but little converfe with him, unwilling to dilcover his mean Spirit. The Evening before his Arrival the Atozr fent to give the Frinoniz. notice in the King’s Name, that they fbould be ready to go meet the Ambatfador the next day •, which we did, and brought him into the City and through vAU's Gate, that joyns to the King’s Palace. Now ’tis the cuftom for all Ambafladours to falute that Gate, by reafon of a white Marble Stone made like an Afles back, and which ferves for a Step: being, as they report, brought am ciently out of Arabia, where M \W&amp;. So foon as you have ftrid over that Stone without touching it, which were a great crime, you enter into a kind of a Gallery, where there are Rooms on each fide, which ferve for a Sanauary for Criminals, which the King himfelf cannot fetchout of that place. That day that the new King receives his Enfigns of Royalty, he goes to ftride over that Stone •, and if by negli gence he fhould chance to touch it, there are four Guards at the Gate, that would make a (hew of thrufting him back again. =, . f But now the Mafter of the Ceremonies being ready to condua thd Ambamdor to the Apartment alotted him, as an AmbalTador that came from three great Mo- narchs, and a potent Commonwealth, hedefir’d to lodge at the Houfe of oncT/Vw Tentalet, defcended from Venetian Parents} whereupon the Mafter of the Ceremonies conduaed him thither, and caus’d his Dinner to be brought him. While we were eating, I counted thirteen Languages fpoken at the Table; Latin, French, Dutch, Englijh, Low-Dutch, Italian,'Portuguez, Perfian, Turkjjh, Arabic, MUfi) Syriac, Malaye, which is the Language of the Learned, that is fpoken from the River Indus to China and Japan, and in all the Iflands of the Eaft, like Latin in Europe not reck’ning the little Morefco or Gibbrifh of the Country. So that it is a difficult thing to obfervewhat is talk’d in one Company, where the Difcour e begins in one Language, ispurfu’d in another, and finifh’d in a third: and fort e TFurki and Armenians, they never fpeak above three or four Languages at nioit. Now to (hew you the Civility of the Perfians\ the Mafter of the Ceremonies ca to the Ambaffador and told him, that if he did not like the Cookery of the fit had Order from the Attwadmkt,who is as the Grand Vizier in Turkic, to' Chap.

Upon which the covetous AmbafTadour accepted his offer, and two hours after there was a Bag brought him of 50 Tomans, which amount to about 800 Crowns. The Frank being offended at his balenefs, flighted the Ambaffador, and left him to keep Houle by himfelf, which was poor enough God knows; an Onion or a Turnep ferving his turn for a Meal. Some days after, lie had audience of the King, to whbtn he pfelfinicd his Letters Credential from the Pope,.the bmperour, the King of Poland, and the Commonwealth of Venice. Thole from the three laft were well receiv’d, bccaufe the Seals were of Gold, and lor that the Paper was embelifh’d with curious. R^cifhes: but the Pope’s Letters were reje&amp;ed with fcorm. becaufe the Seals w^rco^fy pf Lead, as the Bulls are uiually Ical’d *, and for that the Writing was very plaiop L!0»r the Kings of Per fa, who are very nice, love things that are gay totheEye--, otl&gt;crwife they look.upon themfelves to be affronted.

How to behave himfel f; efpecially being loeclips’d as iiems by a real Ambaffador that Arriv’d at Jfpahanfame time after. All tHe Frank wen'tfforth to meet hint, and the Matter of the Ceremonies made Him the fame proffers as he had done to the Venetian : but he nobly anfwer‘d, That what ever it were Th#t the King of Perfa im him, he Ihould take it for a very great Honour: other wile, if he would have eaten Gold, the King his Matter would have allow’d him; 3 0 Miate .Such prions as behave themlelves with.decency .and a good grace, are the perfons that tho^phriftian Princes fhould fend info Pcrfia, who are the moltreffad Wits, and the beft T Politicians of d\\ Afia. To conclude thejStory of the Venetian, I will give you his CharaTer. An Indian naturally of a good Wit Having embrac’d Chnftianity and an Ecclefiaftical Life, went to Rome xo conipieaf his Studies which he had begun at Goa - 7 whether, tbe Pope, taking an affe'ftion to him, fent him afterward as hL Vicar. 'Dominica de Santi* being then at Rome t put himfelf into his lervice, and follow’d Him into the Indies, where I faw him the firft time I went, ina mean condition. Upon his return to Venice, where he was in no credit before, h^«db people believe that he underftood the Trade of Afia 3 whereupon fome particular Merchants trufted him with feme Goods, which werecaft away, at Thus poor and bare he return’d to Goa, where he got'800 Crowns by a charitable Gontribution. ; From thence he travel’d to Ijvaha/i, where befell into the acquaintance- of Father Rtgordi * Jefuire. with whom he went into Po/W: where making his brags of the great knowledge he had of the Affairs of Perfia, the Ring gave him that Commiffion which I have already mention’d* The Emperour follow’d his Example, and the Commonwealth of Vmice did the fame : and to give the more luftre and authority to his Embaffy, they got the Pope to joyn with them. But alas! both Dominico deSantis, and all fuch perfons as he, that go into Afia without Brains and good Behaviour, do but proftitute the Reputation of the Princes that fend them. Such another was Father who after he had been thruft out of Goa by t\[t Portugals, went to Ijfahan, - where he infmuated himfelf by a Propofnion which he made of Marrying the King of Perfia, who was then a very young Prince, to the Dutchefs of Orleance. Under which pretence he was well receiv’d and treated by the King 3 Irom whomhe alfo receiv d fome Prefents by virtue of that Propofal, which was good fport to the Dutchefs whenfhe heard of it. . r ,, As for Pas. Venetian, the Atemadoalet, who was very glad to be rid of him, dehr a t\[t Mafcovite Ambaffador, who was then upofi his return home, to take him along with him, which he did as far as the Cafpian Sea, where they take Shipping for Sjftracan ; but there the Majcovite told him he could carry him no further: thereupon he was forc’d to come back to Ifpahan, and fo to travel to Goa, whence the Portugal* (hipt him home for Charities fake. But when he came to Vwice, he was fo far from being well receiv’d, that the Senate had like to have punifh’d him feverely for giving fo bad an account of his Negotiation. * , u i C H A PCThe Persian 'Travels Book Ik CHAP.

The Grand Mafler goes to the Church of St. John, accompanied with all the chief Commanders in their Rpbes of Command, and the greateft part of the Knights/ All the Country-men and Citizens are up in Arms upon that day, and marchthe hm call'd the Auveman hoyfo, with the Knight that goes to fetch the Standard This Knight is clad ina Cafibskpf Criuafon Velvet,, with a Crofs of the Order bt fore and behind. He wears a Helmet upon his head, and carries the Standard upon his fhoiilders ,; and by him marches the Grand-Mafter’s Page, who carries a Sword in one hand, and a Dagger *in the other, both very .richly Embellifh’d andgiv’n the the Order by C 4 R LSS the fifth. The Page that carry’d the Sword and Dagger was the youngeft Nephew of Pope Innocent the tenth. The Soldiers and Of 7 tizens marching before to the Church door make a Lane for the Knight and thePacc to pafs on to the Altar, where the Knight makes three bows, and having doncas much to the Grand-Mafkr, places himfelf on the right hand of the Grand-Maflers Chait, and the Page on the left. Then the Mafs and the Mufick begins, and while the Gofpel is reading, the Grand-Mafter takes the Sword and the Dagger out of the 1 Pages hand, and holds them with the points upward all theremainiins oartof the Mafs. During the Elevation of the Hofl, the Knights repeats the farne Ceremony as at the beginning-, and then the Bells ring, the great Guns go off, and the Soul- diers give three Volhes. Mafs being ended, the Grand-Mafter retires, accom pany d as before, only that he is then attended by all the Ecclefiaftical perfons of the City, snd coming out of the Church, he proceeds with all the Infantry marching before him toward our Lady s of Victory, where they all go in proceflSon.

In the Kingdom of Cyprus that there is an i^rchbifhop, an^ three Suffragans, the Archbifhop takes, upon him the Title of Nicofia j to which belongs with all the Country between Nicofia and Famagofta, with the Territories of Nicofia and ail the Villages round. He has a Houfe about a League from Nicofia, where Ae cniefelt of his Revenue lies. Some years fince he caus'd the high Altar of the Church to be painted and guildec!, being, a neat piece of Workman(hip. : Thus the Archbifhop has under his Jurifdiduori all the middle part of the Wand, and fome part toward the Eaft. The BilTops are the Bifhops of Paphos, Larneca, and' iZtxines* „ &lt; v 1 i}, - &lt; The Greeeks are very much addicted to the obfervation of their ancient Cuftoms and Ceremonies * 7 and generally their MaifTes are very long. Upon Sundays and Holy-days they fife between one and two of the Clock in the Morning to fing Mat- tens. To which purpofe there is a Clerk that goes from door to door and knocks with a Hammer, to wake the people, and then cries out with a loud voice, Chri* '{Ham go to Church. The men and old women fail not to go as beinjg more zealous but the maids and young women never go out of doors iti the night for fear of the Turks. There are feven or eight Villages, the Inhabitants whereof arc Maronites, who came from Mount Libamts, and fpeak Arabic at home, but G&gt;^ among the Wanders. They follow the Romijh Religion, arid have their Churches peculiar to themfelves. - . . , The Wand of Cyprus is no wholefom Air, being fubjeft: to thefpoil of a fort of Locufts, that fome Summers deftroy all their Fruit and Corn During the heats they hover in the Air, which they will darken with their number like a thick Cloud*, but when the North Wind blo^vs, it carry’s them into the Sea, where they perifh.

There’s aifo a Mine of White Alome, which is theftone call’d Dami- antlius. J Tis thought that the Ancients had a way to fpin this Alome into a kind of Cotton, and fo to mdke out of it a certain fort of Cloath that vf ould not confume in the Fire, but only be the more perfe&amp;ly whiten’d thereby. The formerly- bury’d the dead bodies of their Kings deceas’d in Shrouds of this kind of Linen* and then putting them into the Fire, found the bodies all reduc’d to afhes, but the Cloth whole *, out of which they took the afhes, and carefully put them into an Urne, which was prepared for their prefervation. , . | When the Baftia of Cyprus has a mind to view the Fortrefsbf Emagofta, he fends to give the Bey, who is Governour thereof, nqtice of it. For it is at the Cover- nours choice whether he will give him admiffion or no. The Bajha Bdi-Ciorgi * being a comely old man of above a Hundred and two years of age, fetting out of Nicofia in his Litter with about two hundred Horfe , when he was-come withia half a League of Famagofla, the Governour of the place fent his Lieutenant with a. hundred Horfe to Compliment him, and to conduft him tothe Towm Immediately they took upon them the Guard of the ‘Bajhd’s Litter, who was not permitted to take along with him above eight or ten of his principal Officers. The Canons roar’d at his entry, and he was-treated magnificently, but he lay not in the Town, be ing conduced back by the fame party tothe place where they met him in the Morning. Tlpon the third day of Qftober we fet Sail about three a Clock in the Morning with a Weft-North-Weft Wind, and about Noon we were within.fight of Famagofla, into which place we could by no means be admitted, by reafon of the Wars be-: tween the Turks and Venetians.

VIL Continuation of the %pad ivhicb the Author kept in the fourth Voyage into Afia, and particularly of his pajfage upon f/;e Tigris from Nineveh to Babylon. f' k ^ HE fifteenth of February we putofl from Mmfful, and after we tad fwam fix hours, we came to lye near a hot Bath, about a Musket-fhot from the Tigris. It was throng’d with Sick people that came thither for their Recovery. We kept our felves upon the Watch all night •, but for all we could do, the ^Arabs ftole two Coverlets from a Merchant, and a Cloaths that was gone into the Bath. Jbe fixteenrh, after we had row’d about five hours, we came to a huge Dam- it is 200 Foot wide, and makes a fall in the River of about 20 Fathoms fteep. The Arabians faid that Alexander the Great made it to turn the courfe of the River- others will have it, that Darius caus’d it to be made to hinder the paflage of the mI cedonians by Water. However, we were forc’d to land our ielves and our Goods, and to lade them upon Horfes which the Arabs brought us. The pafiing this Dam is worthy obfervation. For it is a thing of wonder to fee the all of a hidden fall above fix/core Foot, and yet to be kept by the Teather-Bottles dill above Water. The Water-men that guide the Boat, tvethem- felves and their Oars fall to a Pearch bent like a Semicircle, to defend themfelves from the force of the Water. And indeed this is the Dam that renders Tigris navigable. ^ ’ The Kilet being come to the place where we exported it, we put our Goods abbard, and lay in the fame place upon the Bank of the River. For the Arabs, ifthey perceive the Merchants afleep, cut the Cords of the Kilet, and fetting it a-drift, iwim after it, and rifle away what they pleafe. The feventeenth, after three hours rowing we met with the River Zab, that empties into the figrig, upon C'haldeaMc. Half a League above the River Hands n fait Caftle of Brick upon a little Hill y but no body dwelling in it, it runs to mine. We ^ere twelve hours thaf day upon the Water, and came to lye at a place which was full of Wood, where we made great Fires, and fhot off cur Muskets often in rhe night to.fcare the Lions. I he eighteenth we were upon the Water eighteen hours, and lay upon the Bank of the River, upon AJfyria-bAe. That Evening the brought us Milk- Meats, and frefh Butter. They Bvim from the other fide of the River with aPBoracho under their Stomachs, and another upon their Heads, wherein they bring their Commo dities *, for which they will have no Money, but only Tobacco, or Bisket, or Pepper. ^ ^ . ‘ . The nineteenth, in four hours time we met with a River call’d Ahum fou, or TV River of Grid. It flovys from the Mountains of the Medes, and I travel’d by the ude of it for thrceedays together, returning from Taurjs to Aleppo, and pafling the Tigris to Mefieu The VVater of the River is of an excellent taft, and it falls into Tigris p$tisTA(fyriaT\ie. &gt; All along the on the fame fide, are great floreot Bituminous Springs, and other Streams of hot Water that fmcll of Sulphur. All that dayday. we law none but drabr and.CW; marching along the Banks of the River, the Curds upon Asfefopotumlu fide, and the jdrdbs upon osljfyria fide. They were at War and both fidesmarch’d in very good order. The Young men went formofi with Bows and Arrows, and feme Muskets, but feveral Half-Pikes. Next to them their Wives, Virgins, and Children, with their Catte!, Herds, and Camels; after which march’d 3 the Old men in the rcai. As well the Cur us as the ^lr ubiuns fent out H^orfe-men to front upon the high Grounds ; for as Toon as they find any advantage, they prdent- ly fwim their Horfes over the River and fall on. Now becaufe we would not trufl thole fort of People, we row’d nineteen hours to avoid ’em. The twentieth we were eleven hours upon the Tigris, and came to lye at a Town call’d Tcgrit , upon Mefopotama fide. There belongs to the Town a Caftle half ruin’d, and yet there are {till fome handfom Chambers tobefeen. Upon the North and Eaft, the River ferves for a Moat; but upon the Well arid South it has a deep Artificial one pav’d with Free-ftone. The Arabians fay that formerly it was the ftrongeft place in all Mefopotama, though it be commanded by two Hills not far from ir. The Chriftians dwelt half a League from the City, where the Ruincsof a Church and part of a Steeple are frill to be feen, whereby it appears to have been a a confidersble Pile of Building. The twenty-firft, after we had row’d three hours, we met with a Town upon AJfyria fide, which was call’d Amstrel-totir , from the name of a perfon that lyes inter’d in a Monaftery, whom the people account to be a Saint. Therefore is it a place of great Devotion among them, fo that great numbers of Votaries go thither in private. That day we were twelve hours upon the Water, and lav upon the Banks of the River. v - • 1 The twenty fecond, having been upon the Waters two hours, we met with a great Chanel cut out of Tigris to water the Lands, which tuns up as far as juft over- ngainft Bxgdat, and there falls into the Tigris again. Coming thither, we landed upon Chaldea fide, by reafon that there were certain Tur^ with us, who would of nccefTity perform their Devotions at a place call'd Sumatra. In the fame there is a Mcfcjuee net above half a League from the River ; to which many Mahometans pay their Devoirs, cfpecially IndUrisanA Tartars, who believe forty of their Pro phets to be buried there. When they knew us to be Chriftians, they would not permit us, no not for Money, to fet our Feet in it. About five hundred Paces from the Mofcuee ftands a Tower very ingenioufly built. There arc two Stair-cafes without, that belong to it, made twirling like a Periwinkle.fhell: one of which Stair, cafes was built deeper into the Tower than the other. I would have taken better notice of it, could I have been permitted to have come nearer ir. Only I oblerv’d that it was made of Brick, and that it feems to be very ancient. Half a League from thence appear three great Portals, that look as if they had been the Gates of iome great Palace. And indeed it is not improbable but that there was fome great City thereabouts 5 for, three Leagues all alyngHhe River there is nothing to be feen but Ruines, We Were twelve hours that day up'on the Water, and lay upon the Banks of 'Tigris, according to cuftom. The twenty-third, we were twenty hours upon the Water, and all the day lon&lt;* wc faw nothing upon either fide of the River but pitiful Hutts made of the Branches of Palm-trees, where live certain poor people that turn the Wheels, by means whereof they water the neighbouring Grounds. We alfo met that day with a River call’d Odoine, that fills into Tigris upon the fide of the ancient Chaldea. The twenty-fotn ih, we were twenty two hours upon the W^ater together, never ft ir ring off from the Kilet. .The reafon is, becaufe the Merchants having tak’n out oi the Kilet, all thcor Money and the beft part of their Merchandizes, give them to the Country people, who ca% them very faithfully to Bagdat, whither they to fell their own Commodities: which the Merchants do, to avoid the payment of Five in the Hundred, in the City. I trufted them alfo with feveral things of which tney gave me a very good account, as they did to ethers, being contended with a imall matter for their pains. The twenty-fifth, about four of the Clock in the Morning .we arriv’d at Bapdat, wnicri is as ufuaily cailci Babylon, They open the Gates by fix, and then the Cuftomers come to take an accountof the Merchandize, and to fearch the Merchants themfelves. If they find nothing about ’em, they let the Merchants go : but if ' ' L 2 ' thovThe Persian Travels Book II. they have any thing about ’em which ought to pay, they carry the perfonstothe Cuftom-Houie, v/here they write down the quanuty of the Goods, and let them go. All the Merchandize upon the Kilet is carry’d thither alfo, which the Mer chant fetches away again in two or three days, paying the Cuftom: All which is done in very great order, without any noife or difturbance in the lead. Though Bagdat ufually bear the name of Babylon, yet it is at a great diftance from the ancient Babylon, whereof in due place. But now for Bagdat, as it Hands at this day. Bagdat is a City feated upon the River of Tigris, on the Coaft of Perfia, and fe. parated from Mefofotama by the fame River. It lyes in 33 Deg. 1 5 Min. of Ele vation. The Chronicles of the ^Arabians report that it was built by one of their Califs nam’d Jlmanfour , in the year of the Hegyra of Mahomet 145, and of Chriftianity 762, or thereabouts. They call it Var-al-fani, that is, the Hotfe of Peace. Some lay it deriv’d its name from a Hermitage that flood in a Meadow where the City now (lands, whence it was call’d Bagdat, or, a Garden bequeath'd. About forty years ago digging up the Foundations of an Inn, the Work-men found a Body entire, habited like a Bifhop, with a Cenfor and Incenfe by him. And in the fame place feveral Cells of Religious Houfes (hew’d themfelves: which makes it very probable, that where Bagdat is built there was anciently a great Monaftery, with feveral Houfes where the Chriftians inhabited. The City is about fifteen hun dred Paces long, and fev’n or eight hundred broad, and cannot polTibly be above three Miles in circuit. The Walls are of Brick, and terrafs’d in iome places, with large Towers like Baftions. Upon all thefe Towers there are mounted about fixty pieces of Cannon, the biggeft whereof carries not above a five or fix Pound Ball The Moats are wide, and about five or fix Fathom deep. There are not above four Gates 3 three upon the Land-fide, and one upon the River, which you muft crofs, over a Bridge of thirty-three Boats, difiant one from the other about the bredthef one Boat. The Caftle is in the City, near to one of the Gates call’d El-Maazan, upon the North fide. It is partly built upon the River, cncompafs’d only with a fingle Wall, terrafs’d in fome places; and adorn’d with little Towers, upon which are planted about a hundred and fifty Cannon, but without Carriages. The Moat is narrow, and not above two or three Fathom deep, neither is there any Draw-Bridge before the Gate. The Garrifon confifts of three hundred Janifaries, commanded by an Aga. The City is govern’d by a Bajha, who is generally a Vizier. His Houfe is upon the fide of the River, making a fair (hew 3 and he has always ready at com mand fix orfeven hundred Horfe. There is alfo an tAga that commands three or four hundred Spahi’s. They havebefides another fort of Cavalry which is call’d Gin- guliler, that is to fay, Men of Courage, commanded by two Agas *, and ufually there *are about three thoufand in the City and the Towns adjoyning. The Keys of the Gates of the City and the Bridge-Gate are in the cuflody of another Aga, who has under him two hundred There arealfo fix hundred Foot men, who have their particular Aga , and about fixty Cannoneers, who were at that time commanded by an expert Artift that went by the name of Signor Michael,who pafs’d for a Turk, though he were born in Candy. He put himfelf into the Grand Signors fervice, when he went to bohego. Bagelat, in the year 1638. Though the TV^had the good fortune to carry the City in a fmall time *, not fo much by virtue of the Breach which Signor Michael had made in the Wall, as the Sedition and Revolt that happen’d at the fame inflant, the Story whereof was thus in fhort. The Kan that fuflain’d the brunt of the Siege at firft, was originally an Armenian, and his name was Sefi-couli-Kan. He had commanded the City a long time, and had defended it twice from the Army of the Turks, who were not able to take it before. But the King of Terfia having lent one of his Favourites to command in his room, who had enter’d upon his Command before the Cannon had made the Breach, theold Kan finding himfelf difplac’d by the Commifiion of the new Governour, rather chofetodye, than furvive the Affront which was put upon him. To which purpofe he fent for his Servants, the Officersof the Army, his Wife and Son, and taking three Cups of Poy fon in his Hand, he commanded his Wife,if ever fhe lov’d him,now to (hew the marks of her afFe&amp;ion by generoufiy dying with him. He gave the fame exhortation to his Son *, and fo ail three together drank up the Poyfon, which procur’d their ipeedy death.TheSouldiers, who had a great love for their Governour, havinghaving beheld la clifinal a Spectacle, and knowing the Grand Signor was preparing for a general Alfault, would not obey their new Kan, hut began to aft like i\e- volters*, and to that purpofe they agreed to deliver up the City, upon condition they might march away with their Arms and Baggage : but the Turks oid not keep their words.* For lb foon as the Turks were got into the City, the Bajha’s told the Grand Siwor* that to weak’n the force of the Perfian, it was neccftafy for him to put to the Sword all the Souldiers that were in the City: arid thereupon thetd were above twenty thbufand maflacr’d in cold Blood. The Turks had feiz’d upon the Capuchins Manfion, but Signor Michael chief of the CanonncerS, got it to be reftor'd them again. As to the Civil Government of Bagdat, there is none hut a Cady^ who does all, afting even the Mufti, with a Skiekelaflon or Tefterdar, who receives the Revenues of the Grand Signor. There are in it five Mofquees, of which two are indifferently well built, and adorn’d with Duomo’s cover’d with varnifhVi Tiles of different colours. There are alfo ten Inns, all ill built, except two, which are reafonably convenient. In general, the City is ill built *, there being nothing of beauty in it but the Bazars, which are .all arch’d*, elfe the Merchants would no: be able to endure the heats. They muft alfo be water’d three or four times a day *, for which office feveral poor people are hir’d upon the publick charge. The City is full of Trade, but not fo full as it was, when in the hands of the King of Perfia: for when the took it, he kill’d mod of the richeft Merchants. However there is a great confluence thither from all Parts*, whither for Trade, or for Devotions fake, I cannot tell: becanfe they that follow the Sect of Haly, do believe that Haly liv’d at Bagdat. Befides, all they that are defirous to go to Mecca by Land, muft pals through Bagdat, wherb every Pilgrim is forc’d to pay four SPiafters to the, Bafia. You muft take notice that there arc in Bavdat two forts of Mahometans, the firft are call’d Rafedis, or Here- ticks *, the fee &gt;nd , Obiervers of the Law, in all things like thofe at Conftantinople. The Rafedis will by no means eat or drink with a Chriftian, and very hardly with the reft of the Mahometans: or if they do happen to drink out of the fame Cop, or to touch them, they prefently wafh themfelves, as believing themfelves unclean. The others are not lb fcrupulous, but eat and drink and converfe with all the World. In the year 1639, after the Grand Signor had tak’n Bagdat, a Rafedi who was a Carrier of Water not only refus’d to give a Jew to drink, who defir’d it of him in the Market-place, but abus’d him alfo in words. Thereupon the Jew com plain’d to the CWy, who immediately lent for him, and caus’d his Boracho and his Cup to he brought along with him *, when he came before him, he ask’d for his Cup* and gave the jew to drink, and then made the Porter drink alfo out of the fame Cup : After that, he order’d the Rafedi to be Baftinado’d, and this LefTon to be taught him while he was chaftifing, That we are God’s Creatures, as well Mahometans, as Chriftians and Jews. Phis has made them left zealous in their Superftition, though they are the chiefeft part of the Inhabitants of the City. As to their Funerals, I have particularly obferv’d, that when the Husband dyes, the Wife pulls of all her Headgear, and lets her Hair fall about her Ears; then {he all befmears her Face with the Soot of a Kettle, and having fo done, frisks and leaps about after fuch a ridiculous manner, as from others would rather produce, laughter than tea? s. All the kindred, friends and neighbours meet at the Houfe 0! the deceas’d, and ftay for the Celebration of the Funeral. At what time the Wo men ftrive to out-vie one another in a thoufancl Aptfn tricks, clapping their Cheeks, yelling like mad people *, and then of a hidden letting themfelves to dance to the found of two Drums, like thofe which theTabor-and-Pipe-men carry, upon which the Women beat for a quarter of an hour. Among them there is one more ac- cuftom’d to this fool’ry than the reft, that fills your Ears with mournful Dinns; to which other Women make anfwer,by redoubling their Cries, which may be heard at a great diftance. It would then be a vain thing to feek to comfort the Children of the deceas’d *, for they feem to be fo much befide themfelves, that they are not in a condition to hear any thing. And they arc oblig’d to carry themfelves in that manner, unleft they intend to run the reproach of not having any kindnefs for their Parents.- When the Corps is carry’d to the Grave, abundance of poor people go before with Banners, and Crefcents at the ends of Sticks, finging moft difmal Dirges all the way. The Women are not to be at the Interment, who are notThe Persian Travels Book II. to go abroad but only upon Thurfdays, when they go to the Sepulchers to Pra 7 (o&gt;* the Dead. And becaufe that by their Law the Husband is,oblig’d to lye with hi lawful Wife upon Thurfday-night or Fryday.night, upon Wedneiday-roorninp tl'e ’ Women go to the Baths, where they perfume their Pleads and Bodies with a iweet Water. They may go abroad fometimes at the other feafom, ’when their Husbands give them leave to vifit their Kindred *, but then they are to be wrapt ur&gt; f roril Head to Footjthat it is impoffible for their Husbands themfelves to know them if the V meet ’em i’the Streets. By the way take notice, that the Wonien, unlefs they be fuch as are very poor, would rather (lay within all the days of their l\ V rJ than go abroad without a Horfe. And it is a certain fign to know .a Curtifan fron an honeft Woman •, for that the Curtifans put their Feet in the Stirup, and the honeft Women only in the Stirup-leathers. The Women of Bagdat are very richly habited after their fafhions but they are not contented to wear their jewels about their Necks and Wrifts, for they hang them like Bracelets about their Faces, and will bore holes in their Ears to put in a Ring. The Arabian Women only bore the reparation between the two Noftrils, where they wear hollow Rings, as well to fpare coll as for lightnefs *, for fome are fo big, that you may almoft thrufl your Fid through them. Beyond ail this, the more to beautifie themfelves, they make a round Ring about their Eyes with a certain fort of Blacking: And as well Men as Women, intheDeiert, put the fame near their Eyes, to prefer ve them, as they fay from the heat of the Sun. Of Chriftians there are three forts: NeJIorians, who have a Church •, Armenians and Jacobites, who have none, but go the Capuchins , who adminifter the Sacra- ments to them. The Chriftians go in Devotion to a Chappel, about a fhort quarter of a League from the City, dedicated to a Saint whom they call Keder-Elias, paying a fmall Fee, for admiffion, to the Turks, who keep the Keys. Two days jourriey from the City Hands another ruin’d Church in a pitiful Village, where they fay, that St. Simon and St. Jude were both Martyr’d and Buried. If a Chriftian dyes, all the reft come to his Burial, and returning home, find a Supper prepar’d to welcome them} the next day they return to the Grave, and pray for the deceas’d » and the third day there is a Dinner for all comers and goers. Sometimes there will be a hundred and fiity perfons at a Burial. They repeat the fame Ceremonies for the feventh, fifteenth, thirtieth and fortieth days afterwards ; having a great veneration for the Dead, for whom they pray too often. This cuftom of Feafting is very in convenient for the Poor ^ for they being defirous to imitate the Rich, run themfelves fometimes fo far in Debt, that they are forc’d to fell their Children to the Turks to difeharge themfelves. There are leverai Jews alfo in Bagdat, but more that come every year in Devotion to vifit the Sepulcher of the Prophet Ezekiel, which is a day and ahalfs journey fi om the City. In fhort, fince tipe taking of Bagdat by Sultan Amur at, the number 0. Inhabitants cannot be lefs than fifteen thouland Souls j which fhews that the City is not peopl’d according to its bignefs. About a day and a halfs journey from the Point of AJefopotamia, at diftance almoft equal between Tigris and Euphrates, there appears a vaft Heap of Earth, which tne people call^to this day Nemrod. It Hands in the midft of a wide Plain, and oiay be aifeover d a great way off. The vulgar fort believe it to be the Remains of the Tower of Babel-, but there is more probability cf the ArabiansOJmon, who call it Agariouf, and believe it to have been built by an Arabian Prince, who always kept a Beacon at the top to aftemble his Subjecfs together in time of War. T his Heap of Earth was about three hundred Paces in circuit *, but it is not eafie to guels at the ancient height, the reft being fall’n to mine, but'only eighteen or twenty Fathom. It is built of Brick dry d in the Sun, every Brick being ten Inches Iquare, and three thick. Ihe Building is thus rais’d, yllpon every rowof Canes or Reeds bruis’d to pieces and mix’d with Wheat-ftraw, and fpread an Inch and a half thick, lye {’even orders of thefe Bricks with a little Straw between each*, then another Bed of Reeds, and fix rows of Bricks; then a third with five rows, decrcafmg in that manner ’till you come to the top. I he form of itfeems to have bven rather fquare than round ^ and in the higheft partof that which remains there appears a Hole like a Window* if it were not rather an Out-let for Water, ora x0ie f° r l ‘ le Scaffolding.

The Chronicles of the Country fay, that thefe were the Ruines of the ancient Ba rn hylon. We follow’d that Arm of Tigris that runs along the Coaftof Chaldea, for fear of tailing into the hands of the Arabs, who were then at War with the Baft)a of Babylon, denying to pay the ordinary Tribute to the Grand Signor. We were ten clays upon the Water in our paffage from Bagdat to Balfara, and lay every night ( upon the Wetter, dreffing our Victuals in the Bark. For when we came to any Villages, we fent our Servants a-fhoar to buy Provifions, which we had very cheap.

' ' ^ After this we came to Gorno, a Fortrefs upon the point where the two Rivers meet befides two other fmall Cattles upon each fide, fo that there is no paffing without leave. Upon the Fort of Gorno, which was well furnilh’d with Cannon, we fawthc Prince of .Balfiira’s Son, who was Governour of the Fort. And here it isthatthe Account of the Cuftoms is taken. But though they are very exsC in fearchina the Barks, they are very civil, for they fearch no body. However left any Goods (hoold be hid between the Planks of the Ships, over which they generally throw Fagots and Canes, the Cuftomers bring a great Piercer, with which they bore the Tides of the Bark quite through for the ditebvery of conceal’d Goods. The Goods are Rc°ifiet’d MGirno, but the Cuftoms are always paid at Bslfara, according to theacccmw givn fromtheFort. ^ The fame day entrinj? into the Chanc! that is cut out of Euphrates to Balfatd we met the chief of the Holland Fadory taking his pieaiure in a Boat cover’d wiih Scarlet, who took me with him to Balfara. .M/47V1 ftands upon the fide of Arabia deferta^ two Leagues from theRuinesof a City, which was formerly call’d Beredon, and anciently flood in the Defert to which the Water was formerly conveigh’d out of Euphrates in a Brick Chanel’(till to be feen. By the Ruines it appears to have been a great City, from wfience the Ardkim fetch away the Bucks and fell them at The City of Bal/ara is half ,a i-eague from Euphrates, which the Arabians in their Language call or the River of Arabia. The Inhabitants of the City have made a Chanel to it about half a League Io»g, which bears VelTels of 150 Tuns •, at the end where- or ftands a Fort, fo that no VefiTcl can get into the Fort without leave. The Sea is above fifteen Leagues off, but the Tide comes up to the Chanel, and fills the River other nfteert Leagues upward beyond Gorno. The Country Is fo low, that were it not for a Dam that runs along the Sea-flioar, it would often be in danger of being drawn d. The Dam is above a League m length, and built all of Free-flone fo ftrong, that the fury of the waves can do no-injury, though it lie open to a Boyftrous Sea, it is not above a hundred years fince Balfara belong’d to the Arabiansoi the Defert, and had no commerce with the Nations of Europe. For thofe people were contented to eat their own Dates, having fo great a quantity, that they only live upon them. Tis the fame thing all along the Gulf on each fide; for from Halfarato the River Indus for above fix hundred Leagues together, and all along theCoaftof Arabia to Majcate, the poor fort of people know not what it is to eat Rice, but live upon Oates and Salt-filh dry’d in the wind. The Cows eat no Grafs, and though they go abroad in the fields, they find little or nothing among the bulhes which is proper for them to eat.

Turkj thould remain peaceable Maliers of the Cityj where they have a Bajba for Governour. But this Treaty endur’d not Irrtg ^ for in the middle of the City there is a Cittadel, call d Aufhel Bajha, or the Bafhas Court, which the lurks built ^ fo* that the Garrifon being Turks and the Inhabitants Arabians who could not endure to be curb’d, they oft-times quarrell’d with the Turks and came to blows. There upon the Arabians of the Defert came to the relief of the Citizens and befieg’d the Bajha in the Fortrefs. At length becaufe there could be no fuch agreement made, but that one party or other took an occafion prefently to break it, there was one whofe Name was A iud, who after many contefts and revolts which hadalmolt tyr’d him ; refolv’d to rid himfelfof the trouble, and fold his Government for forty thoufand Fiafters to a rich Lord in the Country, who prefenfly rais’d a fufficient number of Souldiers to keep the people in awe. This great mah took upon him the name of Efrafiu Bafha, being the Grandfather of Hujfen Bajha, who was Gover nour at the time when I pafs’d through before. This Efrafis threw off theTurkjffr yoak, and took upon him the title of Prince of Balfara. As for the Bajha that fold his Government, he no fooner arriv’d at Conjianmopk, but lie was ftrangl’d. But after Amurath had taken Ba^dat, the Prince of Balfara was glad to feed him conti nually withPrefents that chiefly confided in Horfes, which are very beautiful in that Country. The Great Sha-Abas having taken 0 mus, fenta powerful Army under the C ommand of Iman- Kouli- Kan Governour of Shir as, to take in Balfara. W hereupon the Prince finding himfdf too weak to relift fo great a Pow’r, made anagreement with the Defert Anbians to breakdown the Dam that flops the Sea.Which being per form’d, in came the Sea tumbling fifteen Leagues to Balfara, and four Leagues be yond it, which conftrain’d the Perfians, furrounded with 1 water, and hearing at the fame time of the death of Sha- Abas, to raife theirSiege. Since that inundation, fe- veral Lands and Gardens have been utterly barren, or Have bom very little, by reafon of the Salt which the Sea has left behind. - The Prince of Balfara has enter’d into Leagues with feveral ft range Nations, fo that whencefoever you come, you may be welcome. There is fo much liberty and fo good order in the City, that you may walk all night long in the Streets without mo- leftation. The Hollanders bring Spices thither every year. The Englifh carry Peper and fome few Cloves, but the Portugals have no Trade at all thither. The Indians bring Calicuts, Indigo, and all forts of Merchandizes. In fhort, there are Mer chants of all Country’s, from Conftantinoplei Smyrna, Aleppo, Damafcus, Cairo, and other parts of Turkje, to buy fuch Merchandizes as come from the Indies, ivith which they lade the young Camels which they buy in that place, for thither lihe Arabians bring them to put them to fale. They that come from Viarbequir, Mou~ JJitl, Bagdat, Mefopotamia-, and AJfyria, fend their Merchandizes up the Tigris by Water, but with great trouble and expence. In regard the Boats are to be tow’d by men, that cannot go above two Leagues and a half in a day, and againft the Wind they cannot ftir, which makes them oft-times between Balfara and Bagdat to be above fixty days, nay there have been fome that have been three months upon the Water. The Cuftoms of Balfara amount to five in the hundred, but generally you have fbme favour (hew’d you, either by the Cuftomer or the Prince himfelf, that the Merchant does not really pay above four in the hundred. The Prince of Balfara is lb good a Husband, that he lays up three millions of Livers in a year. His chiefeft Revenue is in four things, Money, Horfes, Camels, and Date-trees, but in the laft confifts his chiefeft wealth. For all the Country from the meeting of the two Rivers to the Sea, for the fpace of thirty Leagues together,is all cover’d*with thefeTrees, nor does any one dare to touch a Date, ’till he has paid for every Tree three fourths of a Larin, or nine Sous French. The profit which the Prince makes upon money, proceeds from this, that the Marchants that come from abroad are oblig’d to carry their Keals to his Mint, where they areCoyn’d and converted into Larins, which is worth to him eight in the hundred. As for his Horfes, there is no place in the world, where there are more fit for travel, or handfomer (hap’dv for there are fome that will travel thirty hours together and never draw bit, efpecially the Mares. But to return to the Palm-Trees it is worth obfervation, that there is more Art to bring up thofe Trees than any other. The Natives dig a hole in the ground, wherein they heap a great quantity of Date-nuts in*a Pyramidical form, the top &gt; M whereof9° The Persian Travels. Book II. whereot ends in one tingle Nut, which being cover’d with Earth produces the tree. Moft of the people of the Country do fay, that in regard there is among t h e Palm-trees the diftindfion of Male and Female, that therefore they muft be pla nte ^ one by another, for that otherwife the Female Tree will bear no Fruit. But others affirm that nicety to be unneceffary •, and that it fuffices, when the Male is inBloflbfn to take a Flower from the Male, and put it into the Heart of the Female a littfe above the Stem *, for unlefs they (hould do fo, all the Fruit would fall off before it came to maturity. There is at Balfara a Cady that adminifters Juftice, and who is eftabliffi’d by th e authority of the Prince that commands there. In the City are alfo three forts of Chriftians, Jacobites, Neftorians, and Chriftians of St. John, There is alfo a Houfc of Italian Carmelites V and there was a Houfe of Portugal Auftin-Fmts, but they have forfak’n the Town ever fince their Country-men quitted the Trade. The Chriftians of St. John are very numerous at Balfara, and the Villages there- labours j who anciently liv’d by the River of Jordan, where St. John Baptiz’d; and from whom they took their Name. But fince the time that Mahomet conquer’d Paleftine, though Mahomet formerly gave them his Hand and his Letters of p r j. viledge that they fhould not be molefted, neverthelefs they that fucceeded the falfe Prophet refolv’d to extirpate them all *, to which purpofe they ruin’d their Churches, burnt their Books, and exercis’d all manner of cruelties upon their per- (bns: which oblig’d them to retire into Mefofotamia and Chaldea, and for fome time they were under the Patriarch of Babylon, from whom they leparated about a hundred and fixty years ago. Then they remov’d into Perfia and Arabia, and the Towns round about Balfara y as Souter, Vejfoul, Rumez, Bitoum, Mono, Endecav, Calafabat, Aveza, Vega, Dorech-, Mafquel, Gumar, Cariamws, Balfara, Onezer, Ztc\ Loza, Nor do they inhabit City or Village by which there does not run a River, And many of their Bifhops have aflur’d me, that the Chriftians in all the foregoing places make above five and twenty thoufand Families. There are feme among them who are Merchants *, but the moft part of them are Trades-men^efpecially Gold- fmiths, Joyners, and Lock-fmiths. Their Creed is full of fables and foul errours. The Perfians and Arabiant call them Sahbi, a People that have forfak’n theiy own Religion, to take up a new one. In their own Language they call themfelves Mendai Jahia, or THfciples of St. John, from whom, as they afeertain us, they have receiv’d their Faith, fheir Books, and their Traditions. Every year they celebrate a Ftaft for about five days, during which time they go in Troops to their Biftiops, who Baptize them according to the Baptifm of St. John. They never Baptize but in Rivers, and only upon Sundays. But before they go to-the River they carry the Infant to Church, where there is aBilhopwho reads certain Prayers over the Head of the Child i from thence they carry the Child to the River, with a Train of Men and Women, who together with the Bilhop go up to the knees in W ater. Then the Bifliop reads again certain Prayers out of a Book which he holds in his Hand, which done he fprinkles the Infant three times, faying, Beefmebrad er-Rabi, Kaddemin, Akjreri, Menhal elgennet Alii Koulli Kraleltf or, In th 'Name of the Lord) firfl and lafi of the IVorld and of Paradife, the high Creator of nil things. After that, the Bifhop reads fomething again in his Book, while the God father plunges the Child all over in the Water j after which they go all to the Parents Houfe to feaft. If any tax their Baptifm for inefficient, in regard the Three Perfons of the Divinity are not nam’d therein, they can make no rational defence for them felves. Nor have they any knowledge of the My fiery of the Holy Trinity, only they (ay that Chrift is the Spirit and Word of the Eternal Father. They are To blind as to believe the Angel Gabriel to be the Son of God, begotten upon Light j yet will not believe the Eternal Generation of Chrift, as God. Yet they confers he became Man, to free us from the Puniffiment of Sin; and that he was conceiv’d in the womb of a Virgin without the knowledge of Man, by means of the Water of a certain Fountain which (he drank of. They believe he was crucifi’d by th e Jews *5 that he rofe the third day; and that his Soul afeending up to Heaven, his Body remain’d on Earth. But like the Mahometans they corrupt their Faith, by faying, that Chrift vanifti’d when the Jem came to take him, and that he deluded their cruelty with his Shadow. ■ . . ‘ ■ ', -. ' ■ .

In the Eucharift they make ufe ot Meal or Flow’r, kneaded up with Wine and Oyl: For, fay they, the Body of Chrift being compos’d of the two principal parts, Flelh and Blood, the Flow’r and the Wine do moft perfedly reprefent them s behdes, that Chrift athis Supper made ufe of Wine only, and not of Water. They add Oyl, to figniiie the benefit we receive by his favour of the Sacrament, and to put us in mind of our Love and Charity towards God and our Neighbour. To make this Wine, they take Grapes dry’d in the Sun, which they call in their Lan guage Zebibes, and calling Water upon them, let them fteep for fo long a time. The fame Wine they ufe for the Confecration of the Cup. They make ufe of Raifins, in regard they are more eafie to be had than Wines the Perfians, e(pe- cially the Arabians, under whofe Government they live, not permitting, nor indeed allowing them the ufe of it. Of all people that follow the Law of Mahomet, there are nonefo oppofite to other Religions, as thefe Perfians and Arabians about T&gt;al(ara* The words of their Confecration, are no other than certain long Prayers, which they make to praife and thank God, at the fame time bleffing the Bread and Wine, never making mention of his Body and Blood s which they fay is not at all neceffary, becaufe God knows their , intentions. After all the Ceremonies are ended, the Prieft takes the Bread, and having eaten fome of it, diftributes the reft to the People. As to their Bilhops and Priefts, when any one dyes, who has a Son, they choofc him in his place s and if he have no Son, they take the next a-kin that is moft capable and beft inftru^ed in their Religion/ . They that make the Ele&amp;ion, fay feveral Prayers over him that is ele&amp;ed. If he be aBiftiop, after he is receiv’d, and that he go about to Ordain others, he ought to faft fix days, during which time he continually repeats certain Prayers over him that is to be ordain’d Prieft, who alfb for his part fafts and prays all the faid time. And whereas I fay the Father fuccedes the Son, it is to be obferv’d, that among the Cbriftians in thofe Parts, both Bifhops and Priefts marry, as do the reft of the people * only if their firft Wife dye, they cannot marry another unlefs (he be a Virgin. Moreover, they that are admitted &gt; to Ecclefiaftical Fundfion, muft be of the race of Biftiops or Priefts *, and their Mothers muft have been always Virgins when they were marry’d. All their BHhops and’Priefts wear their Hair long, and a little Crofs wrought with a Needle. When there is any Wedding to be, the kindred and perfons invited go toge ther with the Bridegroom, to the Houfe where the Bride lives. Thither comes the Bifhop alfo, and approaching the Bride, who is fitting under a Canopy, he asks her if (he be a Virgin. If (he anfwer that (he is fo, he makes her confirm it by an Oath. After which he returns to the Guefts, and fends his Wife with foipe other skilful Women to make an infpedion. If they find her to be a Virgim the Biftiop’s Wife returns and makes Oath of it y and then they all go to the River, where the Bkhop re-baptizes the Couple to be marry 5 d. Then they return toward the Houfe, and making a flop before they come quite near it, the Bridgroom takes the Bride by the Hand, and leads her feven times from the Company to the Houfe, the Bilhop following them every time, and reading certain Prayers. After that they go into the Houfe, and the Bride and Bridegroom place themfelves under the Canopy, where they fet their Shoulders one againft another, and the Bifhop reads again, caufingthem to lay their Heads together three times. Then op’ning aBookof Divination, and looking for the moft fortunate day to confummate the Marriage, he tells them of it. But if the Biftiop’s Wife do not find the Bride to be a Virgin, the Bifhop can proceed no farther, fo that if the young Man have (fill a mind, he muft go to fome meaner Prieft to perform the Ceremony. Which is the reafon that the people take it for a great difhonour to be marry’d by any other than the Biftiops i for when a Prieft marries, ’tis an infallible fign that the Bride was no Virgin. The Priefts alfo, in regard they take it to be a great Sin for a Woman to marry not being a Virgin, they never marry any fuch but by conftraint, and to avoid enfuing inconveniencies j for fbmetimes in defpite they will turn Mahometans* The reafon of the Infpedtion is, that the Husbands may not be deceiv’d, and to keep the young Girls in awe. As to what they believe touching the Creation of the World, they fay, that the Angel Gabriel undertaking to create the World according to the command which M 2 7 * God- 9 2 The Persian Travels. Book II, God gave him, took along with him three hundred thirty-Iix thoufand Demons, and made the earth fo fertile, that it was but to Sow w Corning and Reap at Night. That the fame Angel taught Adam to Plant and Sow, ana all other neceffary Sciences. Moreover that the fame Angel made the feyen Iowa Spheres, the lead whereofreaches to the Center of the World, in the fame manner as the Heavens do all contriv’d one within another. That all thefe_ Spheres aie of different Metals, the firft next the Center is of Iron, the fecond of Lead, the third of Braf s , the fourth ofLaten, the fifth ot Silver, the fixth of Gold, and the feventhof Earth. The feventh is that which contains all the reft, and is the chiefeft ot all, as I being the moft fruitful and profitable to Man, and the moft proper to preferve Man. kind, whereas the reft feem rather to be tram d For its deftruchon. They believe that over every Heaven there is Water, whence they conclude that the Sun fwirnsina Ship upon that Water, and that the Maft of his Ship is a Crofs, and that there area | great number of Boys and Servants to guide the Ships of the Sun and Moon, 1 Bdides, they have the Pidture of a Barqqe, which,they fay belong d to the Angel t Bacan^ whom God fends to vifit the Sun and Moon, to fee whether they move right or no, and keep clofe to their duty. V , . In reference to the other World andLife tOvComej they believe there is no other World, but where Angels and Devils, the Souls of good and bad r elide. ^ That in that World there are Cities, Houfes, and Churches, and that the Evil Spirits have alfp Churches, where they piay* fiogiog and rejoycing upon Tnftruments, and Feafting as in this World. That when any one lies at the point of ueaih, three hundred and fixty Demons comeand carry his-Soul to a place full of Serpents, Dogs, Lyons, Tygres, and Devils » who, if it be the Soul of a wicked man, tear it in pieces &gt; but being the Soul of a Juff man, it creeps under the bellies of thofe Crea tures into the prefence of God, who iits in his feat of Majefiy to judge the V \odd That there are Angtls alfo that weigh the Souls of Men in a badance, who being thought worthy, are admitted immediately into Glory. That the Angels and Devils are Male and Female, and beget Children. That the Angel^Grf&amp;rie/ is the Son of God engender’d upon Light, and that he has a Daughter call’d Soum who has two Sons. That the Angel Gahrielhzs feveral Legions of Demons under him who are infteadof Souldiers, and others that are his Officers of Juftice, whom he fends from Town to Town, and from City to City, to punilh the wicked. In reference to Saints, they hold that Chrift left twelve Apoftles to Preach to the Nations. That the Virgin Mary is not dead, but that (he lives fomewhere m the World, though there be no perfon that can tell where (he is. That next tohet St. John is the chiefeft Saint in Heaven , and next to them Zacbarias and ElizM of whom they recompt feveral Miracles and Apocryphal Tales. For they believe that they two begat St, John only by embracing j that when he came to beet age they Marry’d him, and that he had four Sons which he begat upon the watersof Jordan. That when St. John defil’d a Son, he pray’d to God, who drew him one out of the water j fo that St. John had no mote to do with his Wife but only to give ta the Child to bring up. That he dy’d a natural death, but that he commanded to Difciples to Crucifie him after his death, that he might be like Chrift. Laftly,!* he dy’d in the City of Fa/fer, and that he was buri’d in a Chryftal Tomb, broi#t by miracle to the City, and that this Sepulchre was in a certain Houfe near the Rivo Jordan, , t They highly honour the Crofs, and (ign themfelves with it j but they are vet} careful of letting the Turkf obferve them j and during their Ceremonies, they etjj Watch at their Church doors for fear the Turks ftiould enter, and lay fome unju Fine upon them. When they have ador’d the Crofs, they take it in two pie&lt;$, which they never put together again, ’till their Service re-begins. The r^lon vi) theyfo adore the Crofs is drawn out of a Book which they have, Entitul a Tt van. Where it is written that every day early in the Morning, the Angels ta e Crofs and put it in the middle of the Sun, which receives his light from ,f , as Moon alfo doth hers. They add, that in the fame Book are Pictur’d two Ships, 0 of which is nam’d the Sun, the other the Moon *, and that in every one o Ships there is a Crofs full of Bells: And moreover, that if there were not a Lro thofe two Ships, the Sun and Moon would be depriv’d of Light, and the Ships 1 fufferShipwrack.

The other in the Month of Augiift, that alfo lalts three days, which is call’d the Feaft of St. J^/?. The third which lafts five days, in Jum, during which time they are all re-baptiz’d. They obferve Sunday, doing no work upon that day. -They neither Faft nor do any penance. They have no Canonical Books, but a great number of others that treat of nothing but Witchcraft, in which they believe their Priefts to be very crafty, and that the Devils are at their beck. They hold alT Women to be unclean, and that it is not at all available for them to come to the Church. They have one Ceremony, which they call the Ceremony, of We Hen^ of which they make great Accompt, which is not lawful for any to’ perform but a Prieft Born of a Virgin at the time of her Marriage. When a hen is to be kill’d the Prieft puts off his ordinary habit, and puts on a Linnen Cloth, girding his \Vafte with a fecond , and throwing a third about his (boulders like a Stole. Then he takes the Fowl, and plunges it in the water to make it clean * after which he turns toward the Eaft and cuts off the head, holding the Body in his hand’till it has bled out all the blood. While the Hen bleeds, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he were in an extafie, he repeats in his own Language thefe words following; In the name ofGod^ may this flefh he profitable to all that eat of it ? They obferve the fame ceremony when they kill Sheep. For firft, they cleanfe the place very carefully where the Sheep is to be kill’d, waftiingit with water, and ftrewingit with boughs, nor is the number of people fmall that affifts at this Ceremony, as if it were at fome folemn Sacrifice. If you ask them why it is not lawful for the Laity to kill Fowls? They anfwer that it is no more lawful for them to kill than to confecrate them i and that is all the reafon which they bring. They eat of nothing dreft by the lurhyb and if a Turk, ask them for drink, fo foon as he has drank, they break the Cup. And to make the Turks more hateful, they Ti&amp;ure Mahomet like a great Gy ant, (hut up in Prifon in Hell with four more of his Parents s and they fay, that all fhe are carry’d into the fame place full of wild Beads to be there devour’d. They pretend all to Salvation. For, fay they, after the Angel Gabriel had fram’d the World by the command of God* he thus difcours’d him. Lord God^ faid he* behold I have built the World as thou didll command me. It has put me to a great deal of trouble^ and my Brethren alfo&gt; to raife fuch high Mountains that feem to fufiain Heaven. And who indeed was able to make way for Rivers through Mountains without va(l labour y and to give every thing its proper place? Moreover^ great God, by the aid of thy powerful Arm y we have brought the Wirld to fo much perfedion, that men cannot thinly upon ary thing needful for them y which is not to be found therein. But infiead of that fatU- fallion which I ought to have for having accompli (h^d fo great a work^ I find no reafon but to be altogether griev'd. When God demanding the caufe, the Angel Gabriel anfwer’d ; My God and Father y I will tell you what affii&amp;sme* becaufethat after the making of the W)rld as 1 have done y I forefee that there will come into it a prodigious number of Jews, Turks, Idolaters y and other Infidels y Enemies of your ITame y who will he un worthy to eat and enjoy the Fruits of our Labours. To whom God thus reply’d: Never grieve, mySon y there jhall live in this World which thou hafi built, certain Chriftians °f J°hn who fhall be my friends, and fhall be all fad'd. Upon which the Angel admiring how that fhould be! What, faid he, will there not be feveral Sinners among thofe Chriftians, and by confequence will not they be your Enemies? To whom God thus concluded : That at the day of Judgment the Good (hould Fray for the Wicked, and by that means they (hould be all forgiven, and obtain Salvation. Thefe Chriftians have a ftrange Antipathy againft the Blew Colour call’d Indigo, which they will not fo much as touch. For certain yen?/dreaming that their Law fhould be abolifti’d by St. John, told it their Country-men. Which they under- ftanding, and feeing that St. John prepar’d to Baptize Chrift, in a great rage, fetch’d a vaft quantity of Indigo, which they call Aft// in their Language, and flung it into Jordan. They add alfo that thofe Waters continu’d unclean for feme time, and had hinder’d the Baptifm of Chrift, had not God fent his Angels with a large Veffel of water, which he caus’d them to fill out of Jordan before the Jews had defil’d it with Indigo j for which reafon God particularly Curs’d that Colour. CHAP.The Persian Travels. Book II, CHAP. IX. A Continuation of the Road from Balfara to Ormus. 1 ' i T He tenth of April we fet out from Balfara for Bandar-Cong^ for which paffage we hir’d a TmWe or a Barque for the purpofe* for they which are laden with Dates are generally lo overcharg’d s that if a Stornuifesj they are in danger of being overfet. The River Balfara is very (j an l serous, by reafon of the Sands which alfo lie up and down the Perfian Gulf and are very prejudicial to Navigation in that place . On both tides the Gulf that fepa- rates Perfia from Arabia the Happy, live a fort of poor people that follow no other Trade than tithing fo poor, that when they bring tith to your Vetfel, they require nothing for it but Rice i and not the beft neither, but^ fuch coarfe fluff as we feed our Hens and Pigs withal. I gave them a Sack of thirty or fourty pounds, and bid them make merry with it, but they told me, they muft be careful how they fpent fuch Rice as that, unlefs it were for their Sick, or at their Weddings j fo that if the reft of Arabia the Happy be like that, affuredty 5 tis rather a moil unfortunate Country. n- • There are feveral Ides in the Perfian Gulf, but the chiefefi of all is the lile of Baharen^ where they fi(h for Pearls, of which I have fpoken in its propet place. Near to the place where Euphrates falls from Balfara into the Sea, there is a little Kland, where the Barques generally come to an Anchor, in expectation of the wind, There we flay’d four days, whence to Bandar-Congo, it is fourteen days Sail, and we got thither the twenty-third of April, This place would be a far better habitation for the Merchants than Ormus where it is very unwholefom and dangerous to live, But that which hinders the Trade from Bandar*Congo is, becaufe the Road to In Isfobad, by reafon of the want of Water, and cnggf narrow ways, which only Camels can endure * but from Orw?#/1 to the way is tolerable. We flay’d at Bandar-Congo two days, where there is a Portugal Fadfor, who receives one half of the Cuftoms by agreement,with the King of Perjia. By the way take notice, that they who will go by Water from Ormus to Balfara, muft take the Natives for their Pilots, and be continually founding befides. The thirtieth ^ we hir’d a VefTel for Bander-Abaffi, and after three or four hours Sailing, we put into a Village upon the Sea-fide, in the Ifland of mifhe, Kectynijhe is an Ifland three Leagues about, and about five or fix from Omus, It excedes in Fertility all the Iflandsof the Eaft, that produce neither Wheat nor Bar* ley i but at Kectynifbe is a Magazine of both, without which Ormw would hardly fubfift, in regard it furnifhes that City with moft of their Provifion for their Horfes, There is in the Ifland a Spring of good Water, for the prefervation of which, the Perfians have built a Fort, left the Portugals when they held Ormus, fhould get it into their Pofleflion. In 1541. and 1642. the Hollanders falling out with the King ofPerfta about their Silk Trade, befieg’d this Ifland. For the Ambafladors of the Duke of Holfhin conr ing into Perfia, the Dutch were jealous that they came to fetch away all the Silk j and thereupon enhanc’d the Market from forty-two to fifty Tomans. When the Ambafladors were gone, the Dutch would pay no more than forty-four, which was two Tomans more than they were us’d to do. The Kingnetl’d that they would not ftand to their words, forbid that they fhould make fale of their Goods ’till they had paid their Cuftoms, from which ’till that time they were exempted. Thereupon the Hollanders befieg’d the Fortrefs of Keckrnijhe, but the Heats were fo intolera ble, that they were forc’d to quit their defign with great lofs of their Men* and at length by great Prefents to the chief Courtiers, they obtain’d to pay no more than forty, fix Tomans. ^ . , 1 harec is an Ifland nearer to Ormus than Kechpni(he y well inhabited, and 10 iior with Stags and Hinds, that in one day we kill’d five and forty. , From Keck?ni(he we Sail’d for Omus, where we arriv’d the firft of May* ^Chap.

The Soyl about the PerGan Gulf is dry Sand and without Water, fo that it is impoffible to Travel by Land from Omuf to Balfara .The Merchants would be glad to find a way through the Coaft of Arabia to get to Mafdate, whence there might a cut be made to Sindi Dm or s«ra t , which are the three chief Ports of India.

Book IJ) carryU along with me, one that was well vers’d in that iort of Commodity. ^ was a Norman Gentleman nam’d de ReviVe then at Smyrna, who would n eedsacco tI1 pany my Fador, fo that they went both together in a Veil'd thatcarry’d the F re J Ambaffador and his Lady to Conjlantinople. 1 his Gentleman had two or three thoy. {and Ducats in his Purfe, wanting neither wit nor courage, be! ides a good prefer. but perhaps he was more hafty in his proceedings than the referv’dnefs of thatCou n .’ try requir’d. He had left the Service of the Mufcovdes, thinking to find an employ, ment in the Service of the Venetians at Candy » but failing in his expectations, he re. (plv’d to travel into Verfia. While he was at Confiantinople, the Jem, wholay h 0 y upon all opportunities of gain, foon found out my f a£tor i and befides the Pearls which he defired to fee, they fhew’d him feveral other rich Stones to try whether they could draw him in j Cor he had refus’d the Pearls becaufe they held them at too high a Rate. The Norman Gentleman fdl into their acquaintance i and picking out the richeft, told him, that being refolv’d for the Indies, he had a mind to W out four thoufand Ducats in Pearls/ He |dded alfo, that he would pay him half in Money, half in Goods, and at the fame time Ihew’d the Jew two thoufand D mS) which the yen? had already devour’d with his eyes. Some four days after, the Jm brought the Gentleman four fair Pearles with fome Emrauldsj and you may befme they eafily agreed upon the price, in regard the Gentleman had a defign to put a trick upon the Jew* Thereupon he fhews his Ducats x (econd time, which they®, who thought he had a Cully, prefently told out as his own. After that the Jm defiring to fee the Goods, which made up the other part of the payment, the Gen- tleman without any more ado told him, that all the Merchandize which he had to- pay him, was a good ftrong Quartan Ague which had held him a long time, and indeed fuch a one, that he could not poflibly meet with a better, but that he would not over-rate it, in regard he ask’d but two thoufand Ducats for it. The Jew who was rich and in great credit at Court, was fo incens’d at his raillery, that he had like to have made a wicked dir about it. For as he had heard him fay, that the Gentleman was going into the Indies and Perfia, he might have ealily caus’d him to have been apprehended for a Spy. But in regard the Jem can do nothing in point of Trade without the affiftance of the French Merchants, he adviz’d with fotne of them, who perfwaded him that it was an Ad of folly, which it better became him to excufe, and defil’d him to take his Goods again, and put up the bufmefsi which with much ado they perfwaded him to condefcend to. The Gentleman fear ing left the Jews underhand (hould do him a private mifehief, ftole away with what fpeed he could, and return’d to Smyrna. De Keville being thus return’d to Smyrna, put himfelfinto an Almadier, which is a fmall Veffel of War, that generally touches at Cbw and Rhodes, being bound for Cyprus, from whence there is always fome convenience or other to get to Aim- dretta. From thence he went to Aleppo* and while he flay’d there he met with two French-mcn, the one whofe name was Neret, the other Hautin, who was an Ac* comptant. They had four Wooden Chefts full of falfe Stones ready fet, by which they flatter’d themfelves to be great gainers in Perfia. They went from Marfeih to Seyde, from Seyde to Damas, hearing that there was an opportunity to Travel to Bagdat with the Topigi-Bafhi. This Iopigi-Ba(hi or chief of the Engineers, was he that affifted Amurath in the taking of Bagdat * in recompence whereof the Grantl Signor gave him a Timar, or Lordfhtpin Damas worth four thoufand Crowns a year. Now it was his cuftom every year to vifit Bagdat, and to flay there during the Seafon, that there was any probability of the King of Perfia % belieging it \ which Seafbn not lafting above three or four Months, when that was over, he return’d to Damas. He ufually had about thirty Horfe with him, with which he never made it above eighteen or twenty days, taking the (horteli cut diijetftly through the De* fert, where the Arabs are commanded to bring him Vi&amp;uals upon the Road. And he is willing at any time when be has this opportunity, fo condu6t the Franks that defire it that way, in regard they are never ungrateful to him for it. Thefe two therefore having defir’d that they might be taken into his Company, thf Topigi-Bajhi readily confented * provided they could flay ’till he went, wmc would not be’till two or three Months j with which anfwer they were well fitish • But the two Franks had not flay’d at Damas above feven or eight days but they k acquainted with a Spaht* a Kenegado of Marfeilles y who proffer’d to carry themChap. X. of Monfieur Tavernier. through the Road of Mefopdtamia, fo that they (hould be at Ifpaban before the Topigi-Bafhi) fet out from Vamat. Thereupon they privately departed out of Damaf without acquainting the Topigi-Bafhi^ who underftanding they were gone after the courtdie he had offer’d them, was fo enrag’d at their uncivility, that he fent two of his Arabian Servants dire&amp;ly through the Wildernefs to the Ba(ha of Bagdat, to give him advice of two Frankj that were to pafs that way, who were moft certainly Spies, defcribing them withal from head to foot. In the mean while the twoFrank/ being arriv’d ztOurfajhc Spabi&amp;s he had contriv’d his own defign at'Damas, goes to the Rajha of Our fa, and informs him that he had con duced thither two Frank/, who could be no other than Spies. Thereupon the Bafha feiz’d upon them and all their Goods, among the reft he laid his paws upon feven hundred Piafters, of which the Spabi no doubt had his (hare. And this may ferve for inftruCion to Travellers to have a care hotv and with whom they Travel in Turkie. While the two French-mm were in hold at Ourfa by one (brt of Treachery, the Norman Gentleman and his Companion arriv’d at Bagdat. But they had no fooner fet their feet upon the ftiore, when the Bajha verily believing them, to be the perfons, ot whom the Topigi-Bafhi had giv’n him notice, caus’d them to be brought before him, and feiz’d upon their Goods and Letters, of which they had feveral for the Conful of Aleppo, and other rich Merchants for Perfia, The Bafha fent for the Capuchins to read thofe Letters, but not believing them, he fent for a Sicilian Phyiician which he had in his Service, and his Treafurer who had been a Slave tak’n in CWy. But neither Phyfician, Treafurer, nor Capuchins would in terpret any thing in prejudice oi the French-men yet all that could not preferve them from being (hut up in a Stable full of dung, and from being threaten’d to be Shot out of a Cannon’s mouth if they would not eonfefsthe truth/ Thereupon the Capuchins and the Cadi beg’d him to fufpend his Sentence’till the Arrival ofthe chief of the Cannoniers, to which he readily confented. When the Topigi-Bajhi came, the Bafha commanded the Prifoners to be brought before him. But when the Topigi-Bajhi deny’d them to be the perfons, the Bajha grew intofuch a rage, that he no kfs reproach’d the Topigi-Bafbi for Treachery, than he had accus’d the others. Which fo incens’d the Topigi-Bajhi on the other fide, that he never left till he had obtain’d the releafe of the two French-meni yet not fo, but that the Bafha would have his due* fo that Reville was forc’d to leave fome of his Ducats behind which the Jew (hould have had. But now to return to Smyrna where I expelled the Caravan for fome time in order to my Journey into Perfia. Every thing being provided, we fet forward in the Road for Tauru, which I have at large deferib’d, nor was there any thing worthy obfervation all the way. I Will only take notice, that when we departed from in re gard the heat was fo extream, we left the common Road toward the North, and took the way through the Mountains, where there is always a frefh Breeze and ftore of (hady Lanes. In many of which high Mountains we met with Snow, and abun dance of excellent Sorrel \ and upon the tops of fome of thofe Mountains, we met with feveral forts of (hells, as it had been upon the Sea (bore, which is very extraordinary. From Erzerom we went to Cars *&gt; from Cars we came to Erivan. The Kan was not there then, being retir’d during the heat into the Mountains, a days Journey from the City. His Lieutenant telling me that I could not well pafs farther without paying my duty to the Kan •, I follow’d his advice, and found him in his Tent in a fair Dale, where there was a great quantity of Snow: and where when it began to melt, appear’d feveral beautiful Flowers, fo that Summer and Winter feem’d to lodge both in the fame place. The entertain’d both me and all my Company moft nobly for ten days. I drove aTfo a fmall Trade with him. por I durft not (hew him the rarities I had, being defign’d for the King. For as in Tidia, fo in Perfia, nei ther will the King look upon any thing which his Subje&amp;s have feen before, nor will the Subjects buy any thing which the King has feen, it being an affront to prefent any thing to the King which he had formerly view’d, and the Subject buys nothing rare but what he intends to prefent.'

I carry’d with me the value of about four hundred thoufand Livers, p?rt in Jewels, part in Goldfmiths work and other curiofities, which ! defign’d f° r tbe King of Perfta and the Great Mogul. Being at Lyons I bought a Steel Mirrour round and hollow, about two foot and a half in Diameter, would immediately melt a Half-Crown by the heat of the Sun-beams: and if you feta Candle by it in the night, you might read two hundred Paces off in your Bed by the reflection. Ytorn Lyons I rode to Marfeilles, and fet Sail for Ligorn the tenth of January^ 16(54. in a fmall Bark, but being fear’d by a great Veflfel that we faw oflf at Sea, we came to an Anchor in the Port of Agate, two Leagues from Frejw, where there flood a pittiful Fort with two or three Houfes. There we alfo went afliore and faw a Garden, the Alleys of which werediftinguiftfd withrows of Citron and Orange Trees, which look’d as Green in the depth of Winter as in the midft of Summer, with feveral other curiofities after the mode of Italy. We were no fboner got aboard again, but we perceiv’d another Veflel making into the fame Port with full Sail. It was a Veflel which the Matters of the Forein Office at Toulon, had fet out Hx to j .The Persian Travels. , Book ill to force all Ships that were hound into Italy to pay certain tuflcms, vj/hich r of Marfeilles would not pay when they came into the Port of Toulon. Thereun^ forefeeing that there would be mifchief done, I .called for my littleChefls that cc tain’d my Goods of greateft value, carrying feme part my ielf, and giving? reft to one of my moft trufty Servants, thmling to have skipt into a Genoa B a l that lay hard by us, but inftead of leapinga-board, I fell into the Sea:whereL re?ifon of the Tumult I had perifti’d without relief, had I not by*good for tune hicikoil ofa Cable and redeem’d my felf. At what time one of my Servants, luckily coming to my aid, with much ado drew me up fafe again. s Having efcap’d this danger, 1 got a*ftioar with fuch of my Servants as I had about me, and meeting with a Bark of Frontignan that carry’d Languedocl^W]^ tQ the Coaft ofI hir’d him lot Ligorn', and letting Sail, we hr ft touch’d P4 ■franca^ and afterwards at Monaco. At Monaco 1 went a-ftioar, and went to wait upon Madam the Princefs, who Chew’d me the Rarities in the Caftkr, among the reft, fevera! pieces ofextraordinaiy Painting, feveral pieces of Clock- work and Gbldfmiths- work. But among all hr Curiofities (he Qiew’d me two pieces ol Ciyftal, about the bignefs of two Fills each in one of which there was above a Glafs full of W^.to*, in the other a good quan tity of Mofs *, which were clos’d in by Nature when the Cryftal firft con geal’d. Monaco \s a Caftle fituated upon a fteep Rock, advancing out into the Sea j which advantage, together with others which it receives from Art and Nature, renders it one of the moft confiderable Forts in Italy. The next day finding the Fro«//g&gt;M«-Veirel to be deep-laden, and that it made little Way, I took a Faluke, arid kept along by the Shoar, which was moft pleafantly adorn’d with beautiful Villages and Houfes, as far as Savona *, wl ejie Lchang’d try Faluke, to compleat the reft of the way which 1 had to Genoa. Half the way we did very well, but the Wind rifirtg, we were forc’d to put into a great Town, where we landed^ and from thence, having but nine Miles, I got in good time by Horfe to Genoa* There can be no Profpedf certainly more pleafing than that nine Miles riding. For on the one fide you fee nothing but a continu’d Row of magni- ficent Buldings and lovely Gardens * on the other a calm Shoar, upon which the Waves feem not to beat, but lovingly to kifs. Arriving at Genoa&gt; I met with the reft of my Servants*, and at the end of two days lembarqu’d For Ligorn^ where we arriv’d in four and twenty hours. From Ligorn I went to the Court of Florence, to wait upon the Grand Duke. By whom I had the honour to be admitted into hfs Chamber, where I found nobody attending but one Mute, who had a long time fei v’d his Highnefs: and I obferv’d that they underftood one another by Signs, as perfedfl as if the Mute had had his Speech and Hearing. So that when ever the Duke fent him into his Clofetfor any Papers or other thing whatfbever, he never fail’d to bring the right. After I had tak’n my leave of the Duke, he fent me a noble Prefent of Wine and Fruits ^ but that which I valu’d more than all the reft, was a Cafe of Medicaments and Counter-poyfons, in the compefition whereof the Italians are very exqiiilrte. And yet they did me no fervice *, for when I came into the hot Countries their fermentation was fb ftrong, that all the Oyls and Treacles broke their feveral Boxes, that I could fave nothing of that precious Prefent. The next day, being thetwenty-fixth of March 166^ I embarqu’d with all my Servants in a Dutch Veflel call’d Ihe JufHce. The twenty-feventh we ftaid in the Road, expe&amp;irg the reft of the Fleet, con. fifting of eleven Ships, two Men of War, and nine Merchant-men i four of which were bound for Smyrna, thexe. lot Ancona, and two for Venice.

At eleven a Clock in the Evening we had but little Wind at North-North-Weft, fo that we made not above fourteen Leagues of way. The thirry-ftrft the fame Wind continu’d, with a high Sead but about nine at Night the Wind chopping about to the Weft, we kept our former. Courfe. The iirft of Aprils by eight of the Clock in the Morning we difcover’d the three Hands that lye before Trepano, Levanzo^ Niaretima^ and F a vagina. The fecond and third the Weather was ill, and the Wind unconftant, fo that we made but little way. The fourth, by break of day we difcover’d the Hand of Pantalarea. The fifth by Morning we found our felves w ithin a League and a half of the Coaft of Sicily, juft againft CapePtJfaro, at what time, the Weather being fair, we had a view of Mount Gibello^ all cover’d with Snow.

But the feventh in the Morning, the Weather being fair, we difcover’d Cape Spartivento'i and the fame Wind continuing all that day, toward Evening we fail’d in view of other Hands of Calabria, The eighth we found our felves near to Cape Borfano^ and all the reft of the day we fail’d in view of Cape Stillo and Cape delle Colonne. The ninth we made little way. But on the Tenth in the Morning the Wind coming about to the South, we found our felves at the entry of the Gulf of Venice^ between Cape St. Niary and the Coaft of Greece* where the Mountains were cover’d with Snow. About ten of the Clock we tack’d to our own Courfe, while the Ships that were bound for Venice and Ancona entered the Gulf. The tenth by Morning we faw two little lilands, the one call’d Famo, the other Nlerlera, and were in fight of Corfu. About Noon, the Wind being at Eaft, we kept out at Sea *, and about Evening abundance of little Birds lighted upon our Cordage, of which we caught enow to make a lufty Fricafie. We alfo caught four Falcons, Owls&gt; and good ftore of Turtles. t ( The eleventh and twelfth the Wind being at Eaft,we lay hovering about the Shoar, without making any way. The fourteenth and fifteenth having the Wind at North-Weft, we were two days without feeing Land, yet we caught good ftore of Birds.

From eight in the Morning ’till three in the Afternoon we were becalm’d &gt; but then a good brisk Weft Wind carry’d away all our little Birds. The feventeenth and eighteenth we were becalm’d. The nineteenth in the Morning, the Wind being at Norths Weft, we difcover’d Cape Gullo % between Modon and Coron, in the Morea.

As for the Road I (hall fay nothing, only relate fome PafTages that fell out by the way. Being come to the fourteenth of September we encamp d in apleafant green place between the Caftle and the old Town? for we would not lye in the Inn, becaufe we heard that feveral fick people lodg’d there. We ftaid there two days) during which time I refolv’d to wait upon the Kan^ I found him in a Room made in one of the Arches of the Bridge which is built over the River, which I have deferib’d already, with feveral Captains and Officers about him; when he had ask’d me whence I came, and whither I was travelling, he caus d a Glafs of Liquor to be fill’d me. After that I prefented him with a Profpedive-Glafs, fix pair of ordinary Spe£tacles, twelve other pair of Spectacles that caft feveral Reflexions, two little Piftols, and a Steel to ftrike Fire, made like a Piftol. All which pleas d him extremely well 3 efpecially the Spe&amp;acles, for he was fixty years of ageThereupon he commanded a Lamb, Wine, Fruit, and Melons to be carry d to my Tent, and that I fhould want nothing. After that we fate down to Dinner, but lobfervd the Kan himfelf drank no Wine, though he prefs’d me to it. The reafon was, becaufe he was an Jgti, that is, one that had made his Pilgrimage to Mem tor then it is not lawful to drink Wine, or any other inebriating Drink. After Dinner, finding him in a pleafant humour, I refolv’d to complain to him of one of the Cuftom-Officers about an injury he had done me. For it is ufual with the Cuftomet in this place to op’n the Chefts of all the Merchants, both ’Turkf and Armenians,^ the end that if they have any thing of Rarity the Kan of Eriv'an may fee it. or many times, he buyes what pleafes him beft to fend to the King.

The twenty-fixth of September we departed from Erivath and the ninth ot Novem ber we came to Tauris, taking the ordinary Road. At Erivan twoof my Servants, the one a Watch-maker, the other a Gold-fmith, dy 5 d j I left them lick there, but caus’d them to be buried in the Church-yard belonging to the Armenians. One of them dy’d in fifteen days, of a Gangrene, which eat out his Mouth and Throat *, being the Difeafe of the Country. Though had the Armenians known that one of them had been a Proteftant, they Would never have allow’d him to have been bury’d in their Church-yard. Hereobferve the exa# Juftice, wherewith the Per fans preferve the Goods of Strangers. For the Civil Judge hearing of the death of the Watch-maker, caus’d Ids Chamber to be feal d up . to the end the Goods might be prelerv’d for the kindred of the deceas’d, if they came to demand them. I return’d to Tauris a twelve-month after, and found the Chamber clofe feal’d up. We ftaid twelve days at Tauris: during which time I refolv’d to attend the Kan of Shamaqui, a frontier Town of toward the Caftian Sea *, hut I found him not there, in regard it was Harveft feafon, at what time he goes to gather the King’s and his own Duties. 1 wo days journey on this fide Shamtqui you pafs the Aras, and for, two days journey you travel through a Country ail planted with white Mulberry-Trees j the Inhabitants being all Silk-Weavers. Before you come to the City, yon muil: efofs over feveral Hills; But I think 1 fhould rather have call’d it a great Towns where there was nothing remarkable but a fair Cable which tfie Kan built himfelf, I fpeak of the time part: For as I return’d from thisprefent Voyage of which I now write, when I came to TWi* lunderftood, that there had happen’d fuCh a terrible Earth quake in the Town as had laid all the Houles inheap &gt; none cfcaping that difmal fubverfion, but only one W atch-maker of Geneva, and one more who Was a Camel- driver. I had leveral times defign’d to return into trance through Muftovyi but 1 durftnever adventure, being certainly inform’d that the Mujcoviterxtvci permitted any perfon to go out of Mufcovy into Perfia, nor to come out ot Perfia into Mtif- covy. So that it was by particular connivence that that favour was granted to: the Duke of Hate’s Ambafladors. This laft time I was refolv’d to have try’d Whe ther I could have open d a Palfage from Per fib through Mufcovy intoFfance, but the * Ruine of Shamaqui deterr’d me. We departed from fauris the twen'ty-fecond of November, from Whence to Cafhan we met with nothing confiderable, but only one of the Mufcovite AmbalTadors upon his return into his own Country, with a fmall Retinue of fixty, his Companion dying at Ijpahan. , Upon Sunday the fourteenth of December taking Horfe by three of the Clock in the morning, the Ice bearing very well, we came to Ijpahan about noon: but in regard it was flippery before day, and very plafhy after the Sun was up, the JoUrney was both tedious and troublelbm.

From Arzlan-chaye you go to Seueral^ This is a City, water’d by a River, that alfo falls into Euphrates. It is environ’d with a great Plain to the North, the Weft and South. The way which the Horfes, Mules^ and Camels keep is cut through the Rock like a Channel, two Foot deep, where you muft alfo pay half a Pi a f w ' for every Horfe-load. From Seuerak you come to Bogazi, where there are two Wells, but not a Houfe near s and where the Caravan ufually lodges# From Bogazi you come to Deguirman- Bogazi^ and from Vegnirman-Bogazi to Tdirzatapa, where there isonly an Inn. From Mirzatapa you come to Diarbequir^ which the 7urhy call Car-emu. is a City fituated uponarifing ground, on the right fide of which in that place forms a Half-moon y the defcent from the Walls to the Rivet being very fteep. It is eneompafs’d with a double Wall *, the outward Wall being ftrengthned with fixty-two Towers, which they report were built in Honour of the fixty two Difdples of JESUS CHRIST. The City has but three Gates, over one of which there is an Infcription in Greek and Latin, that makes mention of one Conflantine. There are in it two or three fair Piazzas, and ^ a magnificent Mofquee, which was formerly a Chriftian Church. It is furroundcd with very decent Charnel-houfes, near to which the Moultab's, Vervi’s, Rook-fellers and Stationers do live, together with all thofe other people that concern the Law. Aboutj League from the City there is a Channel cut out of Tigris , that brings the Water to the City i And in this Water are all the red Marroquins walh’d that are made at Viarbequir, furpafling in colour all others in the Eaft: which Msnufa&amp;ure employs a fourth part of the Inhabitants of the City. The Soil is very good, and yields according to expectation y there is excellent Bread and very good Wine, nor is there any better Provifion to be had in any partofPer/Lz: more efpecially, there is a fottof Pigeons which in goodnefs excel all the feveral kinds that we have in Europe, The City is very well peopl’d, and it is thought there are in it above twenty tnoufani Chriffians. The two thirds are Armenians, the reft Neflorians, with fome few Jacobites. There are alfo fome few Capuchins, that have no Houfe of their own, but are forc’d to lodge in an Inn. The Bajha of Diarbequir is one of the Viziers of the Empire. He has but an incon- fiderable Infantry, which is not muchrequifitein that Country y the Curds and AT which infeft that Country being all Horfe-men. But he is ftrong in Cavalry, being abk to bring above twenty thoufand Horfe into the Field. A quarter ©f an hours riding | on this fide Viarbequir there is a great Town with a large Inn, where ihcCmmi l that go and come from Perfia rather choofe to lye than at Viarbequir •, in regard that in the City-Inns, they pay three or four Piajiers for every Chamber, but in w Country-Inns there is nothing demanded. I At Viarbequir, you crofs the Tigris, which is always fordable unlefs whenii Snow and Rains have fwell’d it y for then you muft go a quarter of a League high«) and crofs it over a great Stone-Bridge. Half a League on the other fide of m Bands a Village, with an Inn, which is the Rendevous of the whole Caravan, w where they that firft come have time enough to provide themfelves for a Journeyo nine or ten days, as far as Betlis. For though you may find Towns and InnstM enough upon the Road, yet there is no good Bread to be met with. . When the Caravan proceeds, the firft days journey is fourteen hours on Here* back, and you come to lye at Shaye-batman, where you muft pay a Pia(ier for eveif Horfe-load.

Coming near Betlis you muft travel a whole day among high fteep Mountains, that reach two miles beyond, with Torrents on each hde j the way being cut out of the Rock on each fide, where there is but juft room for a Camel to pafs. The City ftands between two high Mountains^ equally diftant one from the other, and about the height of Montmartre. It is built like a Sugar-loaf, the afcent being fo fteep on every fide, that there is no getting to the top,but by wheeling and winding about the Mountain. The top of all is a Plat form, where ftands a Caftle well built, at the Gate whereof is a Draw-Bridge. Then you pafs through two great Courts, and then into a third, oppofite to the Be/s Apartment. It is very troublefom to get up to the top of the Caftle, and a Man muft be very well Hors’d that does it. There is no other perfon but the Bey and his Efquire, who is permitted to ride up on Horfe back. There is one Inn within the City, and another as it were without, in which the Merchants rather choofe to lye than in the other, by reafon that it is ready to be overflown when the Torrents fwell, that run throngh every Street. The Bey, befide the ftrength of his Paffes* is able to brbg above five and twenty thoufand Horfe into the Field j and a very conliderable Body of Foot, compos’d of the Shepherds of the Country, who are to be ready at a Call. I went to wait upon the Bey himfelf, and made him a Prefent of two pieces of Satin, the oneftreakt with Silver, and the other with Gold; two white Bonnets, fuch as the Turfy wear, very fine, and adorn’d with Silver at the top j together with a fute of HandkerchifFs, ftreak’d with Red and Silver.

For though Fjrc be inthe Territories of the Grand Signor, yet the Persian Money is better lik’d than his own Coyn. Van is a great City upon the fide of a wide Lake of the fame name. There ha good Fortrets belongs to it, that is feated upon the top of a high Mountain which ftands by it felf. There is but one fort of Fifir in the Lake, a little bigger than a Pilchard, of which they take great ftore in the Month of April, For about a League from the Lake there is a great River that is call’d Bendmabi, which de fending from the Mountains of Armenia, empties it felf into the Lake. Now in * March when the Snow melts and fwells the River, vaft numbers of thefe Fi(h come . down the River into the Lake i which the Fiflier-men obferving, fo flop up the Mouth of the River that the Fifii cannot go back s for elfe they would not flay above forty days i at which time they catch ’em up in wide-mouth’d Baskets at the Mouth of the River, thinking to return *, it being lawful for any man to fifh.The people drive a greatTrade in thefe Filh, tranfporting them into Perfta and Amenia^o^ the Perfians and Armenians both, drinking Wine at the end of their Feafts, they then bring this Difh to the Table fora Reli(hing*bit. The people of Van tell a Story, how that there was a certain rich Merchant who farm’d the whole Filkry, paying a good fum of Money for it to the Ba(ha\ who thereupon fiddly forbad any to fi(h but the Merchant j whereas before it was free for any man. But when the Filhing-feafon came, and that the Merchant thought to have caught his FiOi, he met with nothing but Serpents. So that after that time the Fifhery was never more farm’d. And there ferns to be fomething in in for the Bajhas, who area fort of people that will lofe nothing they can get, would be certain to farm the Fifti again and again, were there not fome ftrange reafon to hinder it. There are two principal Iflands in the Lake of Van \ the one call’d Adaptions, where there ftand two Covents of the Armenians, Sourpbague and S ourp bar a: the other liland is call’d Limadafi, and the nkme of the Covent is Limquiliafi, all which Armnitn Monks live very aufterely. From Van to Darcheeky From Darchecl^ to Nucbar , it hands in the Territories of a Bey of Curdijlan, being a paltry Village confifting of two or three little Houfes. Thefe Bey’s area kind of particular Lords, upon the Frontiers of both the Empires of Turkje and Perfia, who care for neither : for they lye fo fecure among the Mountains, that there is no aflaulting them by force. The Curds in general are a brutilh fojt of people *, who though they ftile themfelves Mahometans, have very few Moullah’sio InffrudF or teach them. They have a particular veneration for black Grey-hounds: fo that if any perfon ftiould be feen to kill one of them, he would be knock’d o the Head immediately. Neither does any one dare to cut an Onion with a Knife in their prefence * but it muft be fqeez’d between two Stones by him that intends to make ufe of it i fo ridiculoufly fuperftitious they are. The Bey to whom Nucbar belongs has his Toll-gatherers in that place, who exact fixteen Abafffs for every Horfe-load, befides a Prefent which the Caravan^Bm is oblig’d to prefent him, which comes fbmetimes to feven or eight Tomans: fome* times more: for otherwife the Bey would be fure to watch the Caravan at force feurvy place, and plunder it to fome purpofe. As once it happen’d to a Caravan, with which my Nephew went along in the year 1672} though he had theg&amp; ocl lucklofe nothing more than one*Gamel laden with Englijh Cloth, and anot er with his Provifion. The Bajba of Van and the Kan of Tauris took the Field wit an intention to remedy thefe diforders: efpecially the Bajha of Van, who perceiving that the Merchants would forfake that Road by reafon of the Injuries they al .Chap, iV. of Monfieur Tavernier.

This bad way brings Fifty i’the Hundred profit to the Bgj/ of Nuchar j for were the Caravan to travel through Plains, or a level Country, one Horfe or Camel would carry as much as two or three, and the Merchant would pay Cuftom for no more.

Having paft the Tigrisy all the Country between that and Tauris is almoft equally divided between Hills and Plains» the Hills are cover’d with Oaks that bear Galls and fome Acorns withal. The Plains are planted with Tobacco, which is tranfpoited into Turfye, for which they have a very great Trade. One would think the Country were poor, feeing nothing but Galls and Tobacco i but there is no Country in the World where there is more Gold or Silver laid out, and where they are more nice in taking Money that is in the leaft defective either in weight or goodnefs of Metal. For Galls being a general Commodity for Dying, and no where to be found fo good as there, bring a vaft Trade to the Country i wherein there are no Villages, yet it is over-fpread withHoufes a Mufquet-lhot one from another ^ and every Inhabitant has his quarter of his Vineyard by himfelf, where they dry their Grapes: for they make no Wine.

The Kan is fo glad that the Caravan takes that Road, that he prefents the Caravan-Bafhi and thofe that go with him, with the Garment of Honour, or the Calaat, the Bonnet, and Girdle i which is the greateft Honour that the King or his Governour can do to Strangers.

This Road lies through Kengavar^ Bagdat, Anna, where you enter into the EMert, which I call the little Dsfart, becaufe you get over it in far lefs time than the great Defert that extends Southwards to Arabia the Happy, and where you may often find Water, all the whole Journey being not far diftant from the River Euphrates. A man that is well mounted may ride this way from Ijpahan to Aleppoin three and thirty day, as I have done, and perhaps in lefs, if the Arabian, whom you take for your guide at Bagdat, knows the fhorteft cut through the Wildef- The Horfe Caravans travelling from Ijpahan to Kengaver are fourteen or fifteen days upon the Road i but being well mounted ten or twelve in a Company, you may Ride it in five or fix days. The Country through which you travel, is very fertile in Corn and Rice, it produces alfo excellent Fruits and good Wine, efpeci- ally about Kengavar &gt; which is a large Town well peopl’d. • ' From Kengavar to Bagdat I was ten days upon the Road. The Country is not fo fertile but very ftony in fome parts.

Whereupon, the Villain enrag’d he could not compafs his defign, took his opportunity, kill’d the Child, cut out the Liver and made the Mother eat it, and then flew the Mother alfo. Upon this he fled to Con- flantinopu, to beg patdon of the Ambaffador, and obtain’d it there: But the Ambaffador at the fame time wrote word to the Governour of Candy to put him to death at his returns having only granted him his Pardon, to preferve his Priviledge. And indeed, to fpeak truth, the Candiots are the mofl wretched people under Heaven. Of the IS LAND of cmo.

Sometimes they advance into Perfa, as far as the Province of the Vfbetys, which is a part of Great Tart ary, ranging up as far as Caboul and Caiida- bar.

But on the other fide, in ail the Rivers that proceed from thefe Springs, there is not a fi(h to be feen. Flowers they have in abundance, efpcdally fair Tulips. There is a fort of Strawberry alio with a fhort ftalk, of which five or fix grow in a bunch i theleaft areas big as a fmall Nut, of a pale yellow Colour. The Soil is fo fertile, that it brings forth without any great trouble a vaft plenty of all forts of Fruits. do the people need any other Gardens than their Fields which are cover’d with Cherry-The Persian Travels Book III Cherrv-trees. Apple-trees, Pear-trees, Walnut-trees, and all oilier u(etun, CK of the fame nature : but their chiefeli Wealth conhfts in Cattel but efpecially well-fhap’d Horfes, not much unlike the Spanijb Gennets. 1 hey have alfo an a bi, n . dance ofGoatsand Sheep, whofe Wool is as good as that of %»» -. which theM,,/. cmites fetch away to make Felts.They neither fow Wheat nor Oats, but only Barb for their Horfes, and Millet to make Breads nor do they ever fow twice in thef an)e place : not but that the Land is good enough to bear Wheat, but becaufe they 1 0 , ( Bread made of Millet better. They have very good Fo wl, and Venifon, and Wild. Fowl more than they know what to do withah which they never hunt with Dogs, nor fly their Hawks at*, fbr their Horfes are fo fwift and fo good, that they will tire the Beaft, and force him to lye down and yield. Ev’ry Horfe-tnan has a Rope with a Hiding-knot ready at the Pummel of his Saddle, which they are fo dextrous to throw about the neck of the Beaft that begins to be weary, that tis twenty to one if they mifshim. When they have kill’d a Deer, they cut off the legs, and breaking the Bones, eat the Marrow, which they fay is the beft thing m the World toftrengthen the Body. When they go to fteal Cattel, they carry along with them great Cows-horns ftuft with boy I’d Tripes cut in fmall pieces * then watch ing their times when the Herdfmen are afleep, when the Dogs begin to bark, they throw toev 5 ry one a Horn, with which the Dog prefently runs away;and fo while the Shepherds are afleep, and the Dog is bufie to get the Meat out of the Horn, which is there ramm’d in on purpofe, the Thieves drive away what they P The Drink of the Shirks is Water and Boja is a Drink made of Milltt as intoxicating as Wine, which they want in the Country. The Men and the Women, Boys and Girls go habited all alike, and their Habit is a colour’d Robe of Fuftian, with a kind of large Petticoat underneath-, with this they wear a little pink’d Wattcoat that reaches down to their Thighs j and over that a Caffockofcourfe Cloth that reaches down to their Knees, girt about their Wafts with a Cord. The Sleeves of the Caflbck are op’n below and above, and fbmetimes they pin them behind their Backs. They wear no Beards till they are fixty years of age. And as for their Hair, neither Men nor Women, Boys nor Girls, ever wear it longer than the tips of their Ears. The Men, both young and old, (have the middle of their Heads about the bredth of two Fingers fromthe Forehead down to the Nape of the Neck; and then in ftead of Hats or Head-clothes, both Men and Women wear only a little Bonnet of the fame Cloth as theCaffock, made like a Night-cap. ’Tis true, when the Maids come to be marry’d there is fome diftindion upon their Heads*, for then they faft’n to the hinder part of their Heads a round piece of Felt, which they cover with a white Veil very artificially pleated. Their Breeches are ty’d below their Knees, and reach to their Anclesi their Shooes, which are of Cordovan, both upper and under Leather, have but one feam upon the upper part of the Foot, being light, and cut like a pair of As tor their Beds, they take feveral Sheep-skins and fow them together, and then fluffing them full of Millet-leaves, make a kind of Quilt. Now when they beat the Millet, the Leaf comes to be as fmall as the Chaff of Oats *, fo that when the perfon rifes off from the Quilt, the Quilt rifesand fwells again of it felf. Then Cufhions are of the fame Make, only fometimes they are-ftuft with Wool.

XII. Monfieur Tavernier, CHAP. XII. Oj the Ceremonies and Cujioms of the People of Coinania and Circaflia. Principal of all the Feafis which thcComouchs and Sberkff or Cir\ajfi- ans make, is that which they make at the end of Autumn, after this manner. Three of the ancientelf of the tillage are appointed to ma- nage it, and todifcharge themfelves of a Duty impos’d upon them in the company of all the peoplc.Thefe three old men take a Sheep or a Goat,and having mutter’d certain Prayers over the Bead, they cut the throat of it: after they have died it very clean, they boil it whole, all but the Gathers, and them they road. The Sheep being boil’d, they fet it upon a Table, and carry it into a large Barn, where the People are appointed to meet: There the three old men ftand upright before a Table, and all the People, Men, Women and Children behind them* When the Table upon which the Meat ftands, is brought in, two of the three old men cut off the Legs and the roided Gathers, and hold them up above their heads, and the third holds up a great Cup of Bofa in the fame manner, to the end the people behind may fee them. When the people fee the Meat and Bofa fo lifted up, they proftrate themfelves upon the ground, and fo continue till all the reft of the Meat be fet up on the leffer Table, and that the old men have faid fome few words. Then the two old men that held up the Meat, cut off two little pieces, and give each of them a piece to him that holds the Gup, which being done, they take each of them a piece for themfelves. When they have all three eaten of the meat, the old man that holds the Cup, drink? firft, then gives the two old men to drink, firft to him upon the right hand, nekt to«him upon the left, never letting go the Cup all the while. This firft Ceremony being thus accomplifh’d, the two old men turn toward the Affembly, and go and prefent both of the Meat and the Drink, firft to their Chief or Lord, then to all the people, who equally eat thpr (hare, both men and women. That which remffr.s of the four feet, is carry’d back to the Table, at d the three old men eat it. This done, they go and place themfelves at the Table, where the Mutton is fet, where the oldeft of the three taking the Head, eats a little Mo^feU after turn, the feconcU and next to him, the third does the fame. Then the firft old man commands the reft to be carry’d to the Lord, who receives it with a great deal of refpedfc, and after he has giv’n it to his next a-kin, or the Friend whom he loves beft, the Head is gi’vn from one to another, till it be eat’n up. This being done, the three old men begin to eat of the Mutton a bit or two, and the Lord of the Village is call’d, who c;omcs with his Bonnet in his hand, in a trembling pofture^ to whom, one of the old men prefenting a Knife, he cuts off a piece of Mutton, and eats* and having drank a Gup of Bo/j, he returns to his Seat. After him, all the people, according' to their turns in quality, do as much &gt; and then, for the Bones the Children go to gether by the ears among themfelves. They have another Feaft before they begin to Mow their Meadows *, at which time all the people of the Village, that have wherewithal, take every one a Goat, (for in their Ceremonies they efteem Goats better than SheepJ and for the poor, they join eight Or ten together for a Goat. Let them be Goats, Sheep or Lambs,when they are' all brought together, they cut theirThroats and then flea off the skin,leaving fhefoUr feet and the Head in it. Then they ftretch the Skin with flicks that crofs from one foot to the other, and fet it upon a Pole fix’d in the Earth, the top whereof enters into the head of the Beaft, as is to be feen in the Figure of the Villager and as many Bealls as there are kili’d, fo many Poles are planted in the midft of the Vil lage, with every one a particular Skin upon if, to which, every one that paffes by, makes a profound obeyfance. f v’ry one having boil’d his Goat, brings it into the void place in the middle of the Village, and lets it upon a great Table with the reft. There is the Lord of the Village with his Servants, and fbmetimes the Lord of fome other Village is invited. Now all this Victuals being upon the Table, three of the oldeft men of the Village R - litThe Persian Travels Book IH. fit down and eat a Bit or two: Then they call the Lord of the Town, and if there be any other Lord, they come both together,^ with fome oth^r or the v Seniors olthe Parifh» who being fet down, eat up one oftne Beads, which the old men had ft apart for them •, the red is divided among the people, fitting upon the ground. There are Lome Villages where you Hull have fifty Goats and Sheep, or La^s and Kids, kill’d together at one time. As for their Bofa, there are Lome that bri n ? above 200 Pints i others more or lefs, according to their quality. All the day long they eat and drink, and fing and dance to their Flutes a dozen together, which are in Lome meafure harmonious, as confiding of feveral parts, and decieadng propo^ t ion ably from the Treble to the Bafe. When the old men have folacM themfelvcs with eating and drinking, they go home, and leave the young people, Men and Wo men, Boys and Girls to be merry by themfelves.^ They day as long as there is any Drink v and the next day they go early to Mowing. They have other Ceremonies particular only to their Families. Once a year in every Houfe they make a Crofs after the Form'of a Mallet, about five Foot high, the two Sticks that compofe the Crofs, being as bigas a man’s Arm. This the Mahe^ of the Houfe fets in the Evening near the Door in his Chamber, and calling all his Family together, gives them every one a lighted Wax-Candle. Then fird he fixes his own to the Crofs, next his Wife dicks hers, and fo all the Children and Servants: Jf the Children be fo young, that they cannot do it themfelves, the Father and Mo ther do it for them. If one of the Candles burn out before it be put out, 3 tis a Pro- gnodick that he or die that fix’d it there, (hall not live out their year. If the Can dle falls, then he whofe Candle it was, fhall be robb’d, or be forc’t to fly for his Life. If it thunders, all the people run out of the Village, and the young people of both.Sexes (et themfelves to fingihg and dancing in the prefence of their Elders: And if any one be Thunder-druck, they bury that perfon honourably, believing him to be a Saint. Befides that, they fend over all the Country for a white Goaf, which they breed up and keep in the Village where it happen’d to thunder, having it in great veneration, till thundring in another place, the people fend for it thither alfo. tf the Thunder fall upon any of their Houfes, though it kill neither Man, .Woman, Child, nor Bead, all that Family (hall be kept upon the publick dock all that year, without being ty’d to any Labour but of Singing and Dancing. Thefe people, during that time, go from Village to Village Dancing and Singing at peoples Doors, but never going into their Houfes ^ for which the Inhabitants are bound to bring them out fomething to eat. Irfiere is a day in the Spring, when all that have been drbck’n with Thunder, meet together in the Village where the white Goat is kept i who has always a Cheefe hang ing about his Neck as big as a Parma Check. This Goat they take and carry to the Vitlage of the chief Lord of the Countrey. They never go in, but the Lord with all the red of the Village coming out, they all together proftrate themfelves before the Goat. Having faid feme Prayers, Aey take away his Cheefe, and immediately put'another in its place. The Cheefe which was taken a way, is at the fametimecut into little pieces, and didributed among the people. After that, they give the Strangers to eat, and bedow their Alms upon them * fo that by this wandring from Village to Village, they get good bore of Money. . They have among them but only one Book i and it is as big as one of our largeft FqIio% and it lies in rhe hands of an old man, who has only the priviledge to touch it. When that old man is dead, they choofe another old man to keep the Book i whofe Duty it is to go from Village to Village, where he hears of any fick people. He carries the Book with Kim, and after he has lighted up a Wax-Candle, and put the people out of the Room, he lays the Book upon the Stomach of thejick perfon, opens it, and reads in it, then blows over it fev’ral times, fo that the Breath palfes toward the mouth of the Party: Then he caufes the party difeas’d to kifs the Book feveral times, and as often lays it upon his head, which is a Ceremony of half an hour. When the old man goes away, one gives him a Beef or a Heifer *, another gives him a Goat *, every one according to their Quality and Edate. They have alfo Old Women that take upon them to cure the Sick. Thefe women ( feel the body of the tick party, all over,but more particularly they handle and grope that part where the didemper lies; during which time they let go feveral belches out ofot their mouths, and the more lick the party is, the louder and thicker, they fetch their belches. The handers by hearing them belch in that manner and fetch fuch vilanous lighs from their homacks, believe their friend to be cangercufly ill, and thatthelouder the Women belch, the more eafe and comfort they receive? but whether they do or no, the women are well pay’d for their pains. When any one feds a pain in the Head, they fend for the Barber, who gives two cutts upon the Head acrofS'With the rafor, and then pours Oylinto the wound. For they believe the Head-ach proceeds only from a wind between the flelh and the bone, for which the Incifion opens a paffage to let it out. At their Funerals they that are the near Relations or Friends of the dead, fome cut their faces, and other parts of their Bodies with (harp flints, others proftrate them- felves upon the ground, and tear their hair *, fo that when they return from the Burial, they are all of a gore blood : However, notwithtiaftding all this affliction, they never pray for the Dead. As to their Marriages ; When a young man has feen a Virgin which he has a lik ing to, he fends one ot his friends to agree with her Parents or her Tutor, what he will give for her. Commonly the guifr oonlilts in Horfes, Cows or fome other fort of Cattel. When the agreement is made,the Parents and Kindred ofthe party there by contracted, together with the Lord of the place, go to the Houfe where the Virgin lives and bring her to the Bridegrooms Houfe, where there is' a Feait. ready prepar’d? and after they have made merry, and fung, and danc’d for awhile, the Bridegroom and Bride go and lye together, without any other Ceremony. If the man and Maid are of two Parifhes, the Lord of the Village where the Man lives accom pany him and his Kindred to the next Village all together, to fetch the Bride from thence. , ’ . ' r j If a Man and the wife have no Children, he is permitted to take feveral .wives one after another till he have IfTue. If a marri’d woman have a Gallant, and that the Husband ihould come and find his wife abed with him, he goes away again without faying a word, and never takes any further notice of it. The woman alfo in the fame cafe, does the like by the man. Nay, the more Gallants a woman has,the more (he is refpe&amp;ed : And it is a common cuflom when they fall out, to taunt one another, that if they were not ugly, ©r ill natur’d, or difeas’d, they would have more Admi rers than they have. The People are ofan excellent Complexion, efpecially the wo men, who are extreamly fair, and rinely (hap’d, and* keep their beauty till five and * forty or* fifty years. They are very laborious,and work themfelves in the Iron Mines, which they melt afterwards and forge into feveral Tools and Implements. They make abundance of Embroidery of Gold and Silver for their Saddles, their Quivers, and their Pumps, as alfo upon the Calicut of which they make their Handkerchiefs. If the man and the woman happen to quarrel often together, fo that they cannot be reconcil’d; the Husband complaining firfi to the Lord of the Place, He fends for the Woman, and having giv’n order to fell her, gives the Man another. But if the Woman complain firft? the Man is ferv’d the fame fawcc. If a man or Womanbe a difturber of their Neighbours, if the Neighbours complain to the Lord, he prefently caufes the party to be apprehended and fold to the merchants that buy Slaves, for they are refolv’d they will live in quiet. . ’ i They that take upon them the quality of Gentlemen, fit fiil], do nothing, and fpeak very little.ln an evening they ride out, and meet fome twenty or thirty together to go a ffealing.Nor do they rob only their Enemies, but their Neighbours, from whom the chief prey which they take are Cattle and Slaves. All the Country-people are Slaves to the Lord of the Village where they live, whom he imploys to till his Land, and cut wood tor him upon occaiion,of which they fpend vail quantities. For not being very warm clad, they keep fire all night in the places where they ileep. CHAP.The Persian Travels Book III. CHAP. XIII. Of the leffer Tartars, call'd Nogales, bor dying upon Co mania. T H E leffer tartars have a very ancient race of Horfes, which they breed up even to Superftition *, fo that it would be among them an ad 0 ( Sacriledge to fell them to ftrangers, as being not a little curious how they fell them to one another. Thefe are the Horfes which they ride, fifty or fixty in a Troop together when they go a thieving i and fometirnes a hunder’d together, when they defign any Incurfion upon their Enemies. When the old Men come to be infirm and impotent, if they know any ftout young Man that is a'Souldier, they will lend him one of their Horfes (if he have none of his own) to make an Incurfion, upon condition to have half of the Booty. Many times they run up as far as Hungary, near to Comoro, and Javarin. Thefe Horfes, partly by nature, partly by early cuftom, will travel four or five days together with a handful of Grafs giv’n them once in eight or ten hours, and a little Water every four and twenty hours. But they never go a robbing with them ’till they come to be (even or eight years old: befides that, they muff undergo a very fevere education ere they make ufe of them in thofe hardfhips. ^ Their Bit is only apieceoflroti with a Buckle on each fide, to which they faft’n the Bridle and Head-ftall. For eight days together they put under the Saddle a bag of Gravel or Earth. The firft day the Sack is a Horfe-man’s weight i and fo they add toit every day, ’till it come to be double the weight at the end of the eight days. As they increafe every day the weight upon the Horfes back, they abate every day the Horfe’s Provender and Drink. During thefe eight days, they get up and walk the Horfe two or three Leagues. The next eight days, they abate every day of the weight, ’till the Sack be quite empty. Proportionably alfo they abate him of his Meat and Drink as in the firft eight days, and every day take up the Girt a hole fhorter. The three or four lalt days they afford the Horfe neither Proven der nor Drink, according as they find him able to endure hunger and thifif and the labour which he is to undergo. The laft day, they work him ’till he be all over of a Sweats then they unbridle and unfaddle him, and pour upon him the coldeft Water they can meet with. That done, they lead him into a field, and tyehim by the leg with a Cord, at fuch a length as they intend he fhall feed j yet ftill from day to day allowing him more Rope, ’till at laft they let him loofe, and feed with the reft of the Horfes. Thi« terrible faftingand labour, during which time, that little which they do eat and drink, they eat and drink with the Bit in their mouth, brings them to be fo lean and out of flefh, that their very bones are ready to hart out of their skins: So that if any one fhould fee them in that miferable condition, that does not know the nature of the Horfes, would think they would never be fit for good fervice. The hoofs of thefe Horfes are fo hard that they never fhoe them, and yet they will leave the prints of their feet in the Earth* or upon the ice, as if they had been fhod. Thefe tartars are fo curious in having Horfes that will endure labour, that fo foon as they fee any handfom Colt in their Breed, prefently take him up, to fchool him as I have related ; but hardly ten in titty enduie the tutoring. As for their Diet, ’tis a great advantage for thefe tartars to ride a Mare, in regard they Drink the Milk. They that ride Horfes, carry along with them a little Bag full of pieces of Cheefe dry’d in the Sun •, they have alfo a fmall %onck of Goat-skin, which they fill with Water where they meet with if, intowhkh they put two or three bits of their hard Cheefe, which foftens with the motion oi the Horfe, the Boracho being ty’d under his Belly: and thus the vVater bccon^ a kind of fowr Milk, which is their ordinary Drink.q As for their Inftruments of Cookery, every Horfe-man has a large wooden Lad*- hanging at the Pummel of his Saddle, out of which the rider drinks hirnfeli, and gi u * his Horfe likewife to drink. They that encounter them, can hope for no betterChap. XIII. 0/Monfieur Tavernier. 155 than their Horfes»but they are very hard to be tak’n *,for when one of thefe Horfes perceives that his Rider is llain,he follows thofe that fly with all the fwiftnefs ima ginable* Befide that, thofe Horfes being carri’d into other Countries^ are prefendy fpoil’d, and come to nothing. Their Cloathing is only a Sheep-skin, which in Winter they wear with the wool next their Bodies v in the Summer turning the other fide. They that are the Nobi lity of the Countrey, wear Wolves* skins, with a kind of Shirt,' and Breeches of courfe Fuftian of divers Colours, which the Taylor gets little credit by fha- ping. Their Women are very white and well proportion’d, but their Faces are broad, and their Eyes little, fo that by thirty years of Age they become very deformed. There is not a man but has two or three Wives, which they never choofe but out bf their own Tribe. Every Tribe has a Chief -, who is one of the Nobility of the Countrey, and carries for his Banner a Horfe-tail faftenM to a half-Pike, and dy’d into the Co lour belonging to the Tribe. When they march, every one knows where to place himfdf, and how much ground they ought to take up for their Tribe and their Cattel v one Tribe never encroaching upon another. The Women and Maids are generally clad in a large Shirt that reaches down to their feet. Upon their Heads they wear a large white Vale, their Foreheads being bound about with a large black Handkerchief ty’d in five or fix Rolls. The Noble &gt; (ort of Women and Maids wear over this Vail a Bonnet open behind, which comes down upon their Foreheads like a three-corner’d Cap : One of thefe Points ftands up in the midft of the Forehead, lin’d with Velvet, Satin, or Cloth of Gold, and fet with fmall pieces of Gold and Silver, and falfe Pearls, of which they -dfo make themfelves Bracelets: Their Breeches are of fingle-cotour’d Cloth, and for Shoes and Stockings, they only wear a Cordovan Boot of what Colour they pleafe, neatly few’d. When a young man intends to marry, it behoves him to give the Father and the Mother of the Maid a certain quantity of Horfes, Bullocks or Cows, or other Gat- tel, which is done in the prefence of the greateft part of the andenteft of the Tribe, and a Moullab befide. When the Agreement is made, the young man has the liber ty to fee his Mirtrefs, but not till then ; For before, he has only the information of her Mother, his Sifters, or fuch Women as were his own Frienas. Betides the three Wives which the man is allow’d to take, he may keep feveral female Slaves *, but the Children are ftill Haves, and can never inherit. Thefe 'Tartars are of a ve- ty hot conftitution, though not fo hot as the women. Both the one and the other are very fair-hair’d but the men have little or no Beards: So that if there be any one that has more Beard than ordinary, and can but write and read, they make him a Moullah* Thefe people have no Houfes, but live in Tents, or in Waggons which are drawn after them where-ever they go. The Tents are for the old people and little Chil dren, with their Slaves that attend them. The young women ride in Waggons dos’d up with Boards, and to let in the Air, upon one fide they open a Window shat is made like a Lattice. In the Evening they are permitted to fpend a little time in the Tents. When the Girls have attain’d to the age cf ten or twelve Years, they never ftir any more out of their Waggons till they are married, not fo much as for the neceffities of Nature , but in the middle of the Waggon there is a Plank to le taken up v and if it be in a place where they ftay, a Slave pre fently comes and deanfes all underneath. The Maidens Waggon is eafie to be known, as being painted with Flowers \ and generally there is a Camel ty’d to theTailofitbefmear d with feveral colours, and feveral Nofegays or Poties of Flowers ftuck about the Head fcf the Beaft The young men have alfb every one their Chariot, wherein they only carry a vacha of Horfe-skin, containing about 38 Quarts, which they ufuall filly with Mares*milk, which is very fowr. They have alfo every one another Waggon next ito that wherein they ride themfelves v wherein they carry, feveral Boracbo’s lull of Cows-milk, which is very fowr. At Meals they drink this Milk : But before they powr it out, they ftir it in the Boracbo with a great Stick, that the Curd may mix with the thin Milk. But the Mares-Milk is only for the Mafter and Miftrefs,though before they drink of either, they mix it with Water. When a Friend comes to fee themThe Persian Travels Book Hi, them, they fetch out.tfteir dri’dOheefe, which they tall Korirm, and breakingH into little Bits, eat it with freih Butter. At their Feafts they fometimes kill old Sheep, fometimes old Goats. But for their Horfes they never kill them but at the Funerals of their Kindred, at the Birth of a Child, or at their Marriage-Feafts, or laftly, when their Friends return laden with Spoil from any incurfion, and arefior’d with Slaves. They never drink any thing but Mares-Milk or Cows-Milk, and when they can get neither, they will endure thirft for three or four days together before they will drink water, being always grip’d with a terrible Colick when they drink it. They never eat any Salt, being of an opinion that it is naught for the Eyes, They live long, and are very ftrong, and feldom fick j nor do they refufe any Diet but Swines-fie(h. Their Countrey is very level-, only for fome few Hills in fome places. They have great Bore of Paflure-grounds, and every Tribe has their peculiar Wells to water their Cattle. In the Winter they lodge upon the banks of great Rivers, near to Woods an,d Marifhes, fuffering their Herds to feed at liberty. When the Snow is very deep, the Cattel ferape it away with their feet to come at the Grafs, though they meet with very little elfe but Reeds and Bufhes. In the mean whilethe men cut down the Woods, make great Fires, and employ themfelves in Filhing. There are fome parts of thefe Rivers where the leaft Fifb they take is about four or five foot longy and fome there are above ten or twelve foot in length. Some they dry in the wind, and preferve againft'Summerfome they fmoke in holes which they make in the Earth: As for the imaller fort, they boil them, and eat them without Salt or any other feafoning. When they have eafn their Fifli, they fcoop up a large wooden Ladel full of the Fifh-water and gulp it down. As for Bread, there is no talk of it in their Countrey. When they are not at Wars, or are but newly tetum’d from any Incurhon, they fpend their time in Hunting, but cannot endure any other Hounds except Greyhounds: So that he muft be a very poor Tartar indeed that do’s not keep a Greyhound. Take notice however by the by, that thefe petty concerning whom I have laft difeours’d, are certain people adjoyning to Comaniay which the Titrks-&gt; Perfians and Mengnlians call Nogates who may be well reckon’d among the number of the petty Tartars^ in regard they are all under one Prince, whom the Grand Signor appoints King over all Petty Tart ary &gt; and who receives his inveftituie at Conftantinople, Thefe Tartars are zW'Mahumetans. Nor have they any Phyfician among themi making uie only of certain Simples of which they have a traditional knowledge. When the fik perfon lies in any extremity, they fend for a Moullah, who comes with the Alcoran^ which he opens and (huts three times, faying certain Prayers, and lay ing it upon the fick perfon’s face. If by chance the fick perfon recover, they at tribute his recovery to the §an&amp;i(y of the Alcoran^ and prefent the Moullah with a Sheep or a Goat: If he di&gt;, all his Kindred meet and carry him to the Grave with great Tefiimonies ofSadnefs, crying continually Alla^ Alla. When he is intend, the Moullah muttexs certain Prayers ov’r the Grave, and is paid for his pains accord ing to the wealth of the Heirs. For the poor he generally fpends three days and three nights in that exercife for the riclr he as ufually fpends a Month, never flirring all the while from the Grave *, and fpmetimes fev’n or eight. When any one of them is woubded, they ufe no other Salve but only boil’d Flefli, which they apply hot to the wound. If the wound be deep, they thruft in a piece of Fat as hot as the wound can endure it* and if the perfon be able to kill a Horfe, the wound is cur’d fo much the fooner i for the Flelh and Fat of a Horfe are much more medidnable than the Flefh of any other Creature. Were it not the Cuftom of the Tartars to buy their Wives when they marry, there would be fewer Whores. But in regard there are an abundance of poor young men that have not wherewithal to buy Wives, they never marry at all.

TheGhap. I- of Monfieur Tavernier. - The temper of the Air in Perfia varies according to the variety of iituation. The Countrey of Edzerbaijan is very cold, but very healthy. The Air of Mazaadran is very unvvholfom •, for being a low fenny Country, and full of Infe&amp;s, when the Waters dry up in the Summer, the lnie£ts alfo dye and infed the Air. Sometimes thofe b,jd Waters over-flow the Country i in fo much that the Inhabitants receive a tindure in their Complexions from the colour of the Earth. The Province of Guilan is included in the Province of Mazandran \ and the Air isfounwholfom, that the People cry of him that is fent to command there j Has he robb’dyftol 0 ^ or mur- therd^ that the King fends him to Guilan ? At Ijpaha/ty which is almoft in the middle of Perfia, there are fix months of hot, and fix months of cold weather. The Snow falls three or four times in a feafomand fometimes fo very thick, that there is hardly any travelling upon the Road. About a League from the City, toward the Mountain, there hands a Stone about two or three Foot high, which when the Snow hap’ns to cover, prognofiicates a plentiful Year i and the firft Country-man that carries the news thereof to the King, receives a hundred tomans. As for Rain, there is very little falls there, unlefsit be in April y and then it fometimes rains very hard. In the Southern Provinces, the heats are very exceffive, and kill abundance of our Europeans-) efpecially thofe that are giv’n to drink. All Perfia is water 5 d with little Rivers', but there is not one navigable River through the whole extent of it, unlefs it be or the Araxes of the Indians) which carries feme few flat-bottom Boats. The other Rivers* inflead of growing bigger, the farther they keep their courfe from the Springs, grow (hallower for want of Water, by reafon of the infinite number of Kreifes or Channels, which they cut out of the Rivers to water the Lands, which would not bringforth fo much as only Grafs without the help of thofe Cuts*, unlefs it be in the Province of ^Aazandrari) which from September to March feems a kind of Terreftrial Paradife, through the pleafing variety of Herbs and Fruits. However, Perfia in general being thus water’d is a moft fruitful Country: though it be true, that many of their Springs and Chan nels are loft and brok’n. And Mirza*Ibrahim Governour of the Province of Edzer- baijan told me one day, that in the very Territory of Taurisy there were above two hundred Springs utterly loft, either by accident or negligence. As for their Gardens, they water them with Well-water, by the help of a Wheel and an Ox i but the running Water is much better, as not being fo cold, and more fatning to the Earth. And therefore the Fruits that grow in the Mountains which are only Vater’d by the Rain or by the Dews, are much better tafted, and keep longer. _ , j-,-; _ Eerfta is a mountainous Country, but for the moft part the Mountains are very dry and barren. Asfor Woods, there are none in all the Country. Travellers are alfo forc’d to go a great way out of their Road to find a Spring *,and fometimes they dull ride ten or twelve Leagues, before they meet with any Water but what they carry in their Bottles. There are forne Mountains out of which they dig Salt, as Stones out of aQuarrey. There are alfo Plains where the Sand is nothing but Salt, though it be not fo favoury as our Northern Salt. Of late feveral Copper-Mines have been found out, of which the Natives make all forts of Kitchin-Houftioldftuflf. Their Lead comes from Kerman -, their Iron and Steel from Corafan and Kashin, though not fo good as that of Spain. Their Steel is very fine, with a fmooth grain, and grows very hard in the Water, but it is as brittle asGlafs. Neither will this fort of Steel agree with the Fire; fo that if the Fire have not more than a double heat when the Steel is forg’d, it will look juft like a piece of burnt Charcoal. The Steel which we call comes from the Indies, and the Perftans call it Gauherder. There are alfo fome Mines of Gold and Silver in Perfia, wherein it appears that they have anciently wrought. Sha-Abas alfo try’d again, but found his expence to be more than his profit; whence it is become a Proverb in Perfia, Nokre Kerven dehkirarge nobbafiel'-tThcSilvet-Mint oi Kerveu, where they fpend ten to get nine, wihch is the reafon that all tfieGold andSilver of Perfia comes out of ForeinCountries.The? ersian Travels BookIV- CHAP. II. Of the Flowers nnd Fruits of Verfu,ofTurquoifes and ? m \ lt H E Flowers of Verfta are nothing comparable to our European Flowers neither for variety nor beauty. For having pafs’d the Tigris in the Road to Perpa, you meet with nothing but Rofes and Lillies, and feme other Fruits peculiar to the Country. As for Rofes, they have great ftore, which they diftil, as they do Orange-fW and tranfport the Waters into all the Eaftern parts ofAfia. I never left the Court of Perfia, but fome of the Lords, efpecially four of the white Eunuchs, beg’d of me to bring them fome Flowers out of France &gt; for they have every one a Garden before their Chamber-door; and happy is he that can prefent the King with a Pofie of Flowers in a Cryftal Flower-Pot. There are in Apples, Pears, Oranges, Granates, Prunes, Cherries,Apricots, Quinces, Qhefnuts, Medlers, and other forts of Fruit, which is not generally f 0 well-tafted as ours. , , Their Apricots indeed, efpecially the leffer fort, are better than ours. When yon open this Apricot, the Stone cleaves in two, and then the Kernel,which is only a Skin, as white as Snow, is more pteafing to the taft than if it had been prg. ^ As for their Melons, they are mod excellent, and very plentiful, neither ishfo dangerous to eat them to excels, as ours. There have been tome that have catn fix and thirty pound in a day, and have never been the worfe. There is a prodigious quantity of them fold in Jfpahan , where they are brought to Market, from midnight ’till four a Clock in the afternoon. Thofe Melons which are firft in feafon,and are call’d GuermZ) are infipid,and taft of nothing but Water. However the Phylidans advifeyouto eat them, faying that they plump up the Flefti, andrenewthe habit of the Body. The next to the GmrrwZ) are better than they, and they in- creafe in goodnefs ’till they come to be quite out of feafon the laft of which they keep all the Winter long. Though they have fuch vaft plenty, yet they never leave but one Melon upon a ftalk, and when it is as big as a Nut, theGard’ner,or his Wife, or his Children,lye down upon the ground and lick oft the Down, which they fay keeps the Melon from beingTweet, and rip’ning kindly; ^ The Perfians have alfo a particular fort of Quince-Pipin, but not fo good as ouiSi which they fry unpar’d, cafting great ftore of Salt in the Pan to excite third, and then prefent them to their Friends at their Collations. They have alfo Almondsand Figs, but few Small-nuts or Wall nuts. . Oyl they have none, but in the Provinces of Mazandran and Guilan, which fuinilo all the reft of Perfia i but the Ojives are rotten, black, gravelly, and not worth any thing, compar’d with Olives. i Armenia, Mengrelia, Georgia, and Media abound in Vineyards. They bury Vines all the Winter, and take them up again in the Spring by reafon of the cold, In the hotter Countries theydreft their Vines as we do, without any under-propping fhem. There are three forts of Wines in Perfia, That of Tefd is very delicate) that of Jfpahan but ordinary: that of ’Tefd is tranfported to Lar where there Iw a great number of Jews, who care not to live but where they may have good Wine, and that at a cheap rate. It is alfo carry’d to Ormus, where it is fold half in ha cheaper than the Wine of Schiras. As for the Wine of Schirai, it is madeot one only Grape, fweet in taft, but which heats the Mouth extremely. This fort o Grape is call’d Kicbmijhe , it is a white Grape, without any ftone, as vulgarly behev i but however it has a ftone, though it be hardly to be perceiv’d &gt;^vhichneverthees will appear in new Wine, when it frets like a little Tigamerit.

CHAP. III. Of the Beafis of Service ; of the Fifh and Fowl o/Perfia. ■ . , . # .. . . r ; . . ' : ; L ✓ 4 f 'r ■ ' ’ Beads for fervice in Perfia, are Horfes, Mules, Afles, and Camels; The Horfes of Perfia are but of an ordinary ftature, lefs ithan ours, very narrow before, but very fwift and light. They carry their heads very ill in running, by reafon of the Cuftom to which the Perfians ufe them. For they have got a trick of managing their Horfes, yet never getting upon their backs» they teach them to Amble by tying their feet with two Cords of an equal length, to the middle whereof are fatten’d two other Cords that are fatten’d to the Saddle, which'two Cords keep their feet fo, that they cannot ftir but at fuch a diftance •, and fo they deal with their Mules upon which the old men generally covet to ride. The Horfes of Perfia are very docible, and eafily brought up. They give them nothing elfe from one Evening to another but a Sack full ofehopt Straw, with a meafure of Barley whiclrthey mingle together with the Straw, to the end they may eat both together. When the Barley is newly ear’d, they give it them for fourteen or twenty days together to purge their Bodies, as we far the fame end put our Horfes to Grafs in the Spring. The Perfian Horles hold out very well ’till eighteen or twenty years of age i but they never cut their Stone-Horfes in that Coun try. In the Winter, they never take off their Shooes, but only Froft-nail them. Their Furniture is very light and handfomly made. And this is further obferv’d, that whereas we keep Goats in our Stables and Inns, the Perfians keep Hogs. There are two forts of Afles in Perfia. Thofe that are bred in the Country only ferve to carry burthens &gt; but there are a fort of Arabian AfTes that are fwift and very handfom, excelling in price the common fort of Horfes. The Merchants oiiljpaban keep thefe Afe in their Country Houfes, taking it for a great piece of Grandeur to Ride every Morning to their Shops. Some parts of Perfia are perplex’d alfo with wild-Beafts, as Lyons, Bears, and Leopards, but there are but very few nor have we heard that ever they did any great mifehief. Porcupines they have alfo and I my felf faw brought before the King two men, the one of which was Shot through the Thigh, and through the Leg wirh a Porcupine’s Quill. The fecond was kill’d, the Porcupine having darted his Quill a little above his right Pap through his Brett. As for their Fifti, there are an abundance of Carps, Trouts, and Pikes in the River : but in all the other Rivers of Perfia there is but one fort of Fitti, which is a kind of T Barbill, /The Persian Travels Book IV. Barbel. In the fubterranean Channel which they bring to water their fields^ ,1s another fort of Filh very plentiful of bones, and as little as can be eaten. 1 1 Where the white Mulberies grow by the River fide, fo foon as they begj, n to bear fruit, 5 t is very good pafiime to fee the Crabs, as big as the Palm of a man s hand come out of the River after Sun-fet, and climb the trees to eat the fruit,and t hep by break of day return into the Paver again. They are delicate food, far beyond Grey, filh, but a hot provocative Diet, as the Phyfidans well obferve. r During the Froft they bring from thtCafiian Sea great fiore of Salmon or Salmon. Trouts, four or five Foot long. The Province of Media is well Bor’d with Sturgc 0n from the mouth of the Paver Araxes. In the fame Sea there is a certain Ft(h like a Carp, which they fait and dry like our Herrings. From the Per fun Gulf comes nothing but Salt-fifti, which is tranfported over all the Kingdom. Their Fowls are much the fame'that we have in Europe, only 1 do not remember that lever faw any Quails in the Country. As for their Pigeons, they fly wild about the Country i but only fome which they keep tame in the City, wherewithal to decoy the reft: which is a fport the Perfians ufe in hot weather as.well as in cold, Now in regard theChriflians aremot permitted to keep thefe Pigeons, fome of the vulgar fort will turn Mahometans to have that liberty.Thci'e are above three thoufand Pigeon-houfes in Ijpaban. For every man may build a Pigcon-houfe upon his own Farm,which yet is very rarely done •, all the other Pigecn-houfes belong to the King yvho draws a greater Revenue from the Dung than from the Pigeons: which Dung as they prepare it, ferves to fmoak their Melons. Pouitrey is very plentiful in Perfia } and the Armenians brought out of Enrop the way how to Fat Capons •, the firft fo fatted they prefented to the King, who lik’d them fo well, that he order’d that the r icheft of the Armenians ftiould be commanded to provide him fuch &amp; number every year. There are no Turkeys in all dfia but the Armenians trafficking taVenice carry’dfome from thence, which when theKing had tafted, he lik’d fo well, that he order’d the Armenians to breed him up fuch 3 number, and to ftbek the Kingdom with them. But the Armenians^ feeing theKing would impofe a new Tribute of Turkeys as well as Capons, grew negligent, and fuffer’d the Chickens to dye as foon as they were hatch’d. Thereupon the Eerfmt fufpedting the fraud, commanded the Armenians to keep the dead Turkeys, that they might be Judges how they came by their deaths: And it was my wonder tofeefo many young Turkeys hanging againft the Walls of fome Houfesin Z«/^, that occafion’d this Story to be told me. All forts of Water-fowl are as plentiful in Perfia, as with us. Upon the Frontiers of Media and Armenia, at a certain feafon of the year are to be feerv a great number of Birds, much like to our Owiils. Much about the fame time the Corn begins to appear, but then is the ground cover’d with fuch infinite fwarms ofLocufts, that \\\&lt;z Armenians ixt forc’d to betake themfelves to their ProcdTions, and to water the ground with a Water which they fetch a great way off, whereinto the Bodies of feveral martyr’d Chriftians were thrown. Three days thefe Pro- ceffions and waterings of the ground continue,and after that, whether it be thatthe fore-mention’d Birds do eat the Locufts, or only drive them away, in two or three days the Country is clear of them. As for Birds of prey, the Country wants none, Falcons, Sparrow Hawks, Lane- rets, &amp;c. of which the Kiug of Perfta is very well provided, having above eight hundred belonging to his Game. Some of thefe Birds are taught to fly at the wild Boar, or wild Afs, or wild Goat ^ others at Cranes, Herons, wild Geefe, and Par- tridg. The chiefeft of which Birds are brought from the Southern Mountains extending from Schiras to the Prefian Gulf. The King takes great delight to hunt the Boar and Hart •, and if it come to pifs that the Game out-run the Dogs, then they let fly one of their Hawks, who pre- lently feizes the head, and while fhe is continually pecking and difturbing the Beaft, the Dogs are prcfently at his heels. The Hawks are taught to flop like a Horfe at full fpeed : elfe they would never quit their prey, which they prefently do, as foon as ever the Falconer (hews them their reward. Now their way of ord'ring or making the Hawk is this. They take the skin of a Hart, head, body, and kgs, and fluff it with Straw, to the end it may be like the Beaft which they intend to reprefent in the nature of a Quarry. When they have fet it in the phee - whereJ Chap. IV. of Monfieur T A V ER NIE R. where they uiually tram up the Hawk, they lay meat upon the head or in the holes of the eyes, to the end the Bird may be fure to feize thofe parts at his down- come. Being accuftom’d to feed in this manner for fome days together, they fix the Beall upon a Plank with four Wheels, and caufe it to be drawn with long Cords bv certain men, that mend their pace ev’ry day, ’till at length it is drawn by a Horfe at full fpeed, whereby the Bird is accuftom’d by degrees not to forfake her prev After the fame manner they counterfeit all other forts of Ouarrvs to enter their Hawks, as well wild Boars, wild Ailes, as Hares and FoxesT Some there are that will order a Crow with the fame induftry as you would make a Hawk They have alfo a certain Beaft which they call Once, which has a fpotted skin like a Tlaer but which is neyerthelefs very gentle and tamethis a Horfe-man will carry behind him and when he fees a wild Goat, he fets down the Once, which is fo nimble, that m three leaps he will be upon the back of the wild Goat; though the wild Goat be a very fw,ft Creature. The Once immediately ftrangles him with his (harp teeth. But if by accident the wild Goat get from him, the Once will ftand Hill in the f am e place abalh d and troubl d fo that an Infant may take him and kill him, without the lean refinance made :n his qtvn defence. The Kings ofPerfta ta te great delight in Hunting, and in that fport it is that they love to (hew themfe ves magnificent: Infomuch that Sha-Sefi defirous to treat all the Ambaffadors then rchts Court which at that time ware the 7art man, Murcovite andIW M « carry d them along with him into the field,and having tak’n a great number of Harts, hallow dear, Hinds,and wild Boars, he caus’d them all to be made ready to be eat n the fame day s And while he was feafting, an Archited* had order toraife a Pyramid of the heads of thofe Beads in the middle of Ifpahan, of which there are fome remains to this day. When the Archited had rais’d it to a confiderable heieht he came very pleafantly to the King, and told him he wanted nothing but one head offome great Beaft to finiih the Work. The King, whether in his Wine or to (hew the Ambafladors how abfblute he was over his Subieds, turning brisklv toward the Arch.ted s 7bm fay'ftmll, faid he, nor do I t^L where to Let Hi a Head more proper than tby oB&gt;n. Thereupon the miferable Archited was forc’d to fubmit his own Head, the King’s Command being prefemly put in execution. CHAP. IV. Of the manner of Building in Perfia.

The Walls are made with lays of Earth, according to the proportion intended, and between every lay of Earth, three Foot high two ot three rows of Bricks bak’d in the Sun. Thefe Bricks are made in a fquare Mold hree hngers thick, and feven or eight inches broad ; and for fear they (hould cleave i drying in me Sun, they lay over them pounded Straw to keep them from choppmgjn the heat.

At every corner of the is a Room rofi t and take the frelh Air *, and behind another large Room, the floor whereof is f prca(J with Carpets, Mattreffes, and Cufbions, according to the quality of theMaiierof the Houfe. Upon the two Tides bf the Portico are two other Chambers, and doors to ao from one Chamber to another: and thus are the Houfes of the great Lords built but only they are more fpacicus.For their Houfes conlili of four great Parlou rs that look toward the four corners of the Wbrld, and every Parlour has two Chambers upon each hde, which make eight Chambers, that furround a great Hall in the middle. The King’s Palace is alfo built after the fame fafhion : and generally the Perfiatis Houfes are very low, it being a rare thing to fee one three Stories high. Vet all their Chambers and Rooms are arched, whereip the Pnfian exceeds us.For with, out all that trouble and time that we fpend, they will prefemiy raife an Archfo broad and high as eafily demonlfrates theskill of the .Work man. The topsofrheir Houfes are flat and terrafs’d *, being plafler’d with Earth mixt with Straw chopt very fmall and well temper’d s which they bind together with a layer of Lime heath for feven days together, which makes it as hard as Marble, and if they want Lime, they pave the Terrafs with fquare Tiles bak’d in an Oven &gt; fo that the Rain can do no harm. But they are very careful to (hovel off the Snow, fo^ (bar it crack the Tetrafs with lying. Without the-Houfes (how nothing, but within they are curioufly painted with Birds aniflowers,wherein the Perfians are no badArtifls. They takegreat delight to have feverallittle Chambers,with feveral Doors,and Lattice-windows, the quarrels whereof are of Glafs of various colours.This fort of glazing ferves generally, and indeed more properly, for the Apartment where the Women may come. For they might have Cryftal* windows if they pleas’d, but they glaze the void fpaces in this matter, that theirWomen may not be feen •, after they have fram’d the op’n place that gives light, like a Flower-Pot with feveral Flowers in it, which the Glafs of feveral colours imitates to the life* whereby ijtTs impoflible that the Windows (houldbe peer’d through * befides, thatTt-isT&gt;feafant to the Eye. The Doors of their Houfes are of Tefer-Wood, which is very noble, and their Wainfcotingis as neat. The Perfians that love oftentation, always difplay their rich Carpets, Mattreffes, Cudiions, Coverlets, and all the mdft coftly Furniture they have, in the fore part of their dwellings : For the Haram, or the Women’s Quarter is but meanly adorn’d, in regard they are never vifited by any men but their Husbands. In fome of their Rooms they have very narrow Chimnles * for the Perfians kt all their Wood upright which they burn, becaufe of theSmoak * befides, they make but fmall Fires, in regard they have fo great a fcarcity of Wood. When^tbey would go to lleep, they lye down upon a Plank cover’d with a Carpet, and Wrap themfelves in a quilted Blanket. In the Sum mer they deep in the open Air, upon their Terrafles * and in regard the Women lye there too,there is an order obtain’d, that the Moullahs that ting upon the Mofqm {ball not prefume to go up in the morning, becaufe it might be their hap to fee the Women as they lay *, it being one of the higheft pieces of infamy imaginable for a Woman to be difcover’d with her Face op’n. There are fome Houfes that belong to great Lords, that have a fquare place before their Doors, where they that come to vifit them may put their Horfes,totheendthe Street fhould not be petter’d. If you look upon the Front of their Houfes, there is little ornament to be feen, unlefs it be upon fome which have been lately built. CHAP. V. A Deftription 0 / Ifpahan, the chief City of the Kingdom and Do minions of the King o/Perfia. . • . I I Spaban t SphabanfiiSphaon&gt;as thePerfians pronounce it,which fomeTravelkrshavc too unwarily affirm’d to be a fine City, lyes in the Province of Hierac, which compofes fome part of the ancientKingdom oPthcP art bians.\t is theCapitalCity of all Perfia, and a very large place, where the King ufually keeps his Court. The Records of the Perfians declare that formerly it was two contiguous Towns, one4 - Chap- V. of Monfieur Tavernier. pjrr whereof belong’d to Haider, and the other to Nearned-01abi, two parts of Jftahan Hill retaining thofe two names, which has occafion’d great quarrels and de bates among the people, while they have both been eager to prefer their own quarter. Nor indeed could Ifiahan be accompfed other than a Village, before $ ha-A bat had conquer’d the Kingdoms of Lar and Owim. But then obferving fo fair a Situa tion, where he might as well be near the Provinces which he had newly conquer’d, as for the defign which he had to extend his Dominions to the Eaftand Weft, as he had enlarg’d them to the South, he quitted Cafbin and Sultaty to refide at Ifyabari) as in the center of his Empire. This City is feated in a vaft plain, which extends it felf three ways fifteen or twenty Leagues. Upon the South about two Leagues from IJpahan rifes a very high Mountain, on the top whereof toward the Weft are to befeen the remains of a very ftrong Fortrefs, where Vjrw kept himfelf, when Alexander gave Battle to * hirnin that Plain. In the fide ot the Rock is a Grotto, either natural or artificial, or both, out of which iftues a natural Spring^ excellent Water, whire a Vervit ufuaily inhabits. The Circuit of Iftahan, taking the Suburbs all in, is not much lefs than that of P^msbut the number of Inhabitants is ten times greater at firm than at Ijpaban. Nor is it a wonder that a City fhould be fo large and yet fo ill peopl’d, where every Family has its particular Houfe, and every Houfe its particular Garden. What ever way you come to it you may difcover firft the Towers of the Mofijucej,and then the Trees that environ the Houfes,fo that I fab an feemj rather a Forreft than a City, The Plain being fertile is well inhabited, but there are no Villages in it, only three or four Houfes in a place together. The Walls of Ifpaban are of Earth, to which do belong fome pittiful Towers without Battlements or Platforms, Baftions or Redoubts, or any other Fortifica tion. The Moats alfo are as bid, neither broad nor deep, but always dry. In fome places alfo the people have beaten down great gaps in the Wall, to get the neareft way into the City ^ yet they reckon ten Gates, which are but of Earth however, and of no defence *, the chief of which are Ver-Vafalfahab, not far from the King’s Palace, Ver-To^shi, Der-Marh^, Der-Vafal-Letiibon&gt; Ver-Nafan- Abad, Der-Sba, and Der-Vekf. The Gates are made ofPladks rudely joyn’d together, and cover’d with plates of Iron four fingers broad, and as thick as a Grown, faften’d with flat-headed Nails. The Keys are never carry’d to the Go* vernour, but left with a filly Porter that op’ns and (huts the Gates as he pleafes himfelf &gt; for indeed there is no neceflity of (hutting the Gates when there are fomany other ways into the City. The City of Ifpaban is ill laid outfor the Streets are narrow and unequal, and for the moft part dark, becaufe of the Arches that go from one Houfe to another, fo that a man is forc’d fometimes to feel his way for two hundred paces. Moreover the Streets are many times annoy’d with Loads of Ordure and theCarcafles ot dead Beads, which caufe a moft filthy flench, and would be very infe&amp;ious certainly, butfor the wholefomnefs of the Air. In the moft part of the Streets are Wells, which are ftop’d up in Summer, and open’d in the Winter to carry away the Rain and the Snow into theArch’dChannels which run under Ground through the middle of the Street. There are alfo before every Door certain Troughs to receive the filth and ordure ot every Family, which the Country-men come and carry away to Dung their Grounds. Every morning the Country-man comes with his Afstolade Dung *, and it is obfervable that he is more diligent to carry away the Dung of the Armenians, Frankj, and Jews that drink Wine, than of the Ferfians that dxink none. And this is the profit of the Servants of the Houfe that fell an AfTes Load of Dung for five, and fometimes for ten or twelve Kasbejhe* The Streets of Ifpahan, as of all the reft of the Cities of Ferfia are not pav’d, which makes them very incommodious both Summer and Winter. For in Sum mer the duft puts out your Eyes, unlels it be in the Streets where the great Mer chants live, and about the Meydan, where there are people hir’d to water the Streets Morning, Noon, and Night. Thofe people go about the Streets alfo with a Boracho full of Water, acd a Glafs, with Ice in a Bag, to give them drink that defire it: Nor do they take any money, being paid out of the Legacies left by perfons decea&amp;d for that purpofe. In the Winter this duft turns to mire half &gt;... .

If there be any running Water in the Street, they take a little in their Hands and wafh their Member with it i or if there be no Water, they rub it againft a Stone or the Wall, which they take for a great piece of gentility and mo. ^'That which farther contributes to the naftinefs of the Streets of i S) that the Butchers throw the Blood and Excrements of the Beads which they kill into the Streets. If a Horfe or a tole, a Camel or an Afs dye, they prefoity throw him into the Street. True it is, that there are people who come prefentlyto buy it of the Owner, who make Harijfe, which they fell to the poor Work-men, This Hariffe is thus prepar’d i they boyl the flefh of the dead Bead with Corn, and after it is wellboyl’d they math it together, ’till it becomes like a Pottage. They alf 0 make Hanfl of good Mutton ■&gt; both which forts they fell in the Market-place, or great Meydan of the City. Though the City of Ifpahan be dirty, yet there is a way for perfons of Ability to avoid ir, for they never dir but on Horfe-back, with two or three Lackeys, call’d Chatref, that run before to make room. For the Men are all upon the falfe Gallop in the Streets, without any fear of hurting the Children: by reafon that the Chil- dren are not differed to play in the Streets like ours, but asfoon as ever they come from School, they fit down by their Parents, to be indru&amp;ed by them in their Pro- fedion. ^ Thzfe Valets ot Foot-men make a Trade of Running *, of which the King and the Lords have feveral in their fervice* it being a piece of grandeur to keep a great many* They ferve from Father to Son, undergoing an Apprentilhipin Running. From fix to feven years of age,they only fet themfelves to walk flowly.The next year they run a League at a time upon a handfomtrot, the next year aftenkf run two or three Leagues,and fo proportionably for the red.At eighteen years ot age they are allow’d a Scrip of Flowr,with a dat piece of Copper to bake their Bread upon, and a Bottle of Water y all which they carry about them when they run. For thefc people when they are fent Pod never take the Caravan-Ko^^ but the fhorteft cuts through the Deferts, and mud therefore accudom themfelves to carry their Provilion, The King and the Lords have no C^tre/,but what are Maders y which degree they are not to arrive at without fome Ceremony and performing a Race, like our Jem) and the Butcher of Croyden. ; | If he be a Lord that owns the Chafer who defires to be a Mader, he fends for all his Friends, fets up a Scaffold in the Meydan, provides a Collation, and fends for the Curtifans to divert the Company. Now there is not one ofthefeGuefis ‘that does no bring fomething to give this Cbater after the Race is run, either a Bonnet or a Girdle, or fome other thing, part of which the gives to his fellows. Then the Chafer appears with his Legs greas’d, his Thighs bare, only a flight fhort pair of loofe Breeches, and a Girdle with three little bells hanging upon his Belly. Thus accouter’d he darts from Ah-Capi, and between Sun-rifing and Sun-fetting he runs backward and forward to a Stone a League and a half from the City toward the Mountains y running in that time fix and thirty of our common Leagues, or a hundred and eight Miles. W f hile he runs, there is Kmou)^ m the Meydan, and upon all the Road where he runs, and three or four Horfe-men that continually ride to and fro, to fee that there be no deceit in the Chafer's Racftwho when he approaches near the City, ride before to give notice of his coming. Every time he darts and returns, the Drums and Trumpets found y at the end of the Race there dand feveral perfons with Arrows in their Hands, and ev’ry time he comes to the Stone they give him an Arrow, which he carries back every courfe toAli-Cf 1 Every time he returns, the Curtifans rub him and make much of him.

TheFortrefs of Jfahan is nothing at all confiderable* It joyjss to the Wall upon the South fide of the City&gt; and is twice as long as broad, but without any defence in the World, unlefs it be of fome pitiful Towers made of Earth. Here it is that the King keeps all the Rarities which he has purchas’d, or that has been prefented to him. For as to his main Treafure, 1 believe it confitts chiefly in Gold-Plate. Within the Fortrefs there is a Urge Field, fow’d every year with Rice and Corn j hard by which hands the Houfe of the Capuchin- Friars. Ifahan in general, unlefs it be the Meydan and fome few arch’d Streets where the Merchants live, is more like a great Village than a City ^ the Houfes handing at a dittance one from the other, with every one a Garden, but ill look’d after, not having any thing in it perchance but only one pitiful Tree; true it is that they begin to buifd better of late days, but it is without the City. As for the Women his not a pin matter whether they live out of the City or within, in regard thev never ftir our of doors, and asftldom go a-ftoo. * ey tKvet The Meydan or great Piazza ot IJpaban was the contrivance of the great Sba* Abtt, who had never done it, if a great Prince of the ancient Race of the Kings of Perfia had not refus’d him the old Nleydan^ with feveral Priviledges, and the Houfe that flood by it. Thereupon he defign’d this new Piazza, to draw off the Merchants.and to fpoiltheold Market-Place,by their departure from that quarter of the City which is lefs inhabited at this day. It is not far from this old that the Auftin-Friars on the one fide, and the Carmelites on the other have their Habi tations. There are alfo two fides of that Meydan entire, under the Portico's^ where fit only fuch People as fell Herbs, Fruit,and Viduals, the other two Tides are almpft fain to decay i but when it was all (landing, it was as handfom as the new one: and it is to be wonder’d, that the Prince, who built it, did not choofe the place where S ha-Ah as has built his, as being near the Water,and confequently far more conve nient. The great Meydan then is a place about feven hundred Paces long, and between two and three hundred broad. It has Buildings upon allthe four fides j it lyes in length dire&amp;ly North and South * the Fronts are every one Portico’d, and Ter- rafs’d at the top and on the City* fide are little Chambers :nine or ten Foot high, which fall very much to decay, being only built of Brick bak’d in the Sun. They are inhabited, the greareft part of them, by the moft infamous Curtifans of the City. At fome Paces diitance from the Portico’s^ is a Channel which is pav’d with Hone, and runs round about the Piazza *, Sha-Abas caus’d feveral Trees to be planted by the fide ol it, but both the Channel and the Trees being altogether neglected, are fain to decay i bsfides, that the fmell of the Water in the Summer time is very noyfom. In the midft of the Piazza ftands a kind of a May-Pole, or Mail of a Ship, where the People exercife (hooting at Birds. When the King comes to (hoot, they fet a Cup of Gold upon the top of the Matt,which he is to ftrike down with an Arrow. To which purpofe he muft ride full fpeed, nor is he permitted to (hoot ’till after he has patt the May-Pole, turning himfdf upon the crupper of his Horfe: a remain of the ancient cuttom of the Parthians, that kill’d their Enemies flying. T[ie Cup belongs to him that ttnkes it down} and I have feen Grandfather of the prefent King, in five Courfes flrike down three Cups. from this Matt or May-Pole down to the great Mojquee, they fell nothing but Wood and Charcoal: from the fame Pole to the Sun-Dial upon the North-lide, are none but fuch as fell old Iron-Tools, old Harnefsfor Horfes^old Coverlets,and other Brokery-ware,as in our Long-Lane. , • &lt; From the Pole to another to the South, juft again the Sun-Dial, is the p ace for «11 the Poulterers. 1 he reft of the Piazza toward the Palace, is always kept c can,without any Shops,becaufe the King comes often abroad in the Evening to fee ions, Bears, Bulls, Rams, Cocks, and all other fort of Creatures fight which are « brought thither. The people of Iftahan^ as in many other Cities, are divided into two parts, the * 1 , , . 1 ■ ■' oneTheV e r s i a n T ravels Book 1 V. one caU’d Hedari, the other Nametlat i and upon all the Combats of Beafts btforc- mention’d, there are always very confiderable Wagers laid bet ween thefe twoTtii*, The King, who is a neuter, gives to the Mafter oftheBeaft tnat gets the up^ hand fometimes five,fometimes teniometimes twenty according to thevaL of the Wager laid and he that wins the Wager, prefents the Mafter 0 f the Beaft likewife. They have alfo a Sport at breaking of Egg, by knocking the ends one againft another, feme of which Eggs come to three or four Crowns. The Hens that lay them are bred in a Country which they call Saufevare, about ahu n . dred leagues from Ijpahan^ toward the Province oi Karafan &gt; the Cocks of which Country are bigger and ftronger than other Cocks,and coft iorne of them a hundred Crowns. There are a fort of Tumblers alfo, that after Dinner fet up their Stages i n the MeydaH) and toward theEvening, they that play^ the Maid-Marians come anden&gt; compafs a fquare place with a ccurfe piece of Calicut * and then through another very fine Cloth, the Wenches (hew a thoufand tumbling Tricks and antick Pollures, When they have done, they come and ask the Spedlators for Money, who give them every one what they think fit. Every Friday, wh ch is asit were Market-day, the Country-folks bring to Town what they have made in the Villages, as Doors and Windows fitted to be hung up, Window-frames, Locks, and other things of that nature. Upon that day alfo they fell Mules, Korfes, Camels, and Affes, which brings a great confluence of people from all parts. Upon the Weft-fide, where ftands the Gate of the Palace, and Alts Gate, he. tween the Canal and the Vertms are rang'd feme feyenty Pieces of Cannon upon their Carriages. Thefe Guns, together with the Sun-Dial, were brought frcrnOmM by the Great Sba-Abas, of which the ought to have had their (hare Tor with out their affiftance he never could have tak’n the Town. From the corner of that Front, which touches upon the Eafiern Front of the f/lofquee, in the middle, are all Sadlers Shops i and from that Mofquee toanothei corner that touches upon the Weftern Front, live the Book-Sellers, Book-binders, and Trunk-makers. In the middle of the Southern Front Bands a Portal, wttha Tower upon each fide, which leads to a Mofquee, the Gate whereof is cover’d all Over with Plates of Silver, aud is certainly the neateft Portal and fairef! Entrance into any Mofquee of Perfta, At the other end of the fame Front, where it joyns to that upon the Weft, there is a great Portal that leads to a falfe Gate of the King’s Palace j near to which; as foon as you are enter’d;-you meet with the Apartment of the Great Treafurer, who is a white Eunuch, and having the Keys of the Chamber where the Money lyes, takes care to pay what-ever the King orders him. Through that falfe Gate all the King’s Provilions are carry’d into the Palace. This way alfo enter they that are entertained for the Manufa&amp;ory of the King’s Tiffues, Silks, Sattins, Coverlets,and the like. In the fame Enclofure alfo the Frankj, who are under the King’s Wages, and live at Zulpha, come every day to work j as alfo all the moft particular and eminent Artifts that the King hires. The Weftern Front, which makes one of the two lengths of the Meydan, is thus appointed j from the Southern angle that touches the Trunk-maker’s quarter, live all your Pedlers that fell all the fmall Commodities of Norimberg and Venice. As for the King’s Palace, I cannot make any handfom deferipfion of it, in regard there is nothing of Beauty either in the Building or in the Gardens. I think ! have be^n as far in the Houfe as a man could go, every time I was fent for by Bis Majefty but excepting only four Rooms which they call Divans, I faw notfiipg bnrpitiful low Galleries, and fo narrow that hardly two mendpuld pafs a-breftin ’em. In one of thofe Galleries I had audience of the King, in the Garment oi Honour which he had beftow’d upon me. But In regard I have fpok’n of two of them in another place, and that the ether two are much alike both Building and Furniture, I (hall fay no more of them here. From the King’s Palace Gate to Ffo/y’sGate live the Gold fmiths,Lapidaries, and Gravers of Stones for Seals; Halys Gate is a plain Gate, naked of Work: of which I have already fpok\i* Between Hal/s Gate, and the other angle of the fame Weftern Front, lh(d 5 a great Gate which leads into a Bazar, where all the Armenians that live at keep their Shops,and fell all forts of Cloth that comes out of Europe, and other { ne IChap.

At the end of that Bazar (lands a fair Inn two Stories high, which the Mother of Sba-Abas the fecond caus’d to be built. In the middle (lands a great Fountain with four great Gates, which lead into four other Inns* Here by the way let me give a Traveller and a Trader in Ferfia this advice * that if his Goods be not very heavy, he never hire a low Chamber, as being three times dearer than thofe above ; For the Chambers which the Sun lies upon moll in the Summer, are the Chambers which coll lead. Not but all the Chambers in the Inn are Tax’d at the fame rate by the King ; but the Holl for his profit will find feme pretence or other to raife his price,pretending thofe Chambers be hir’d already which you defire, efpecially if they be corner Chambers, which are the larged and mod commodious. And indeed without this collufion Chambers would be very cheap. / The bed convenience of thofe Inns is, that a man is more fecure in one of them then in a privateHoufe: For there if it happ’n that a piece of Goods be dol’n i or that your Chapman prove infolvent for Goods bought,the Inn-keeper is to make all goodsbeing by the Law to receive fo many blows aday ’till he pays the fum demanded# The Merchant alfo gives two in the hundred for every thing that he fells, and when the Market is done they prefently go to the Hod, who fets down in his Book the qua lity of his Goods, and the names both of buyer and feller. If he knows not the buyer, he is bound to go and enquire after him, and if he be not folvent, the Merchant takes his Goods again. Sometimes the Merchant to fave the two in the hundred, combines with the Purchafer to carry away fome of his Goods without the knowledge of the Hod, which is done by grealing his Deputies fid, who wilt pre fently diut his Eyes. But then if the Purchafer proves infolvent, the Merchant dares not complain, beeaufe his Goods are not RegUler’d in the King’s Book, whom he has defrauded of his Cudom. No lefs fecure are the Bazar t or Market-places, where the Merchants (hut up their Shops very (lightly, the Bazars being drongly guarded both within and with out all night long. As for the petty Stalls in the Meydan^ every one puts up his Ware in a Box Padlock’d up, and then lay them down at one end of the place one by another. As for the courfe fort of Ware, as Tents, 1 Cords, Ropes, and fuch other things they only heap them under a large Coverlet faden’d at the four corners by four dicks, for the Meydan alfo is as drongly guarded as the Bazar. Between Halys Gate and that which leads to the Bazar where the Armenians keep their Shops Jive all thofe that deal in Rnjfia Leather, making Borachtis to tye under the Horfes Bellies, little Buckets, and Furniture for Horfe-men, as alfo Bowyers, Fletchers, and Forbifhers. From the lad Gate to the eftd of the Gallery, live all the Druggids and Apothecaries. At the Angle upon the two fronts upon the Ead and North, there is aj&amp;ate that leads to the Great Bazar *, next to that live only your Sai]s-meg that fell whole Ha bits for men, as Shirts, Sheets, Hofe, and the like. There be alfo thofe that fell Leather Shoes for men and women *, which Shoes are always worn by perfons of quality. Out of this Bazar you go into another full of men that work in Copper, fuch as make Pots, Plates, and other Utenfils for the Kitchin. Here alfo live thofe that make Files, and the blades of Sythes. The red of the Bazar is poffefs’d by Dyers of Calicut s and at the end of the Bazar is a fair Inn, where all the Merchants live that fell Musk, Rujfta Leather, and Furrs. I have in another place obfervM that the King has a great Revenue out of the Bj- zars arid Inns which he has caus ? d to be built, which is particularly hid out in pro- vifton for his Table. For the Law of Mahomet forbidding Princes to impofe Taxes or Cudoms upon the People, they do not believe that the money which arifes from thence is fit to be employ’d or laid out for the neceflaries of life, believing that their food fo purchas’d would do them no good. By virtue of this prohibition of Mahomet it is,that the Merchants take all the liberty they can to deceive the King of his Cudoms, believing that they cannot offend thePrince,while they tranfgrefs not the Law.Befides, that if they (hould pay all the King’s Duties, the price of Goods would rife fo high, fo as to fpcil the whole Courfe of Trade and Commerce. Neither would the Reve nue of the Caravanfera s. Bazars, and Gardens fuffice for the Kings Kitchin, were not the feveral Kans or Governours of Provinces oblig’d to fupply that expence eve- *y Week in their turns, whereby thofe expences cod the King little or nothing.

In the midB of the North-Front Bands a great Portal, with a large Dial over it, which Sba-Abaf brought from Ormus when he took it from the Tortugals.MihV\. al is of no ufe, not is ever like to be. Round the Tower of that Portal runs an op n Gallery, with a kind of a Gieling over head fupported with Pillars &gt; from whence every Evening about Sun-fet, and at Midnight, a noife of Drums and Trumpets is to be heard through the whole City. Though the truth is, the Mufick would ne* ver charm a curious Ear. Out of fome parts of the Gallery are contnv d little Dormi- tories, where the chiefefl of the Court lye.

E Vlpha^ which others call Jalpha and Giolpha, is diftant from IJpahan to ward the South halt an hours walk, the River running almoft at an equal diltance between the two Cities. The way that leads from one City to another is a Walk fome fifteen hundred Paces long, andfcventeen broad, almoft equally divided by the River. It begins from a Pavilion or Tabernacle forty Foot fquare, which joyns to the hinder part of the Kings Houfe, with a double Story, to which feveral Windows give light, clos’d with wooden Lattices very ardhcially wrought. None but the King and his Houfhold pafs that way into the Walk. For they that go horn Ifpahan to Zulpha, find the way into the Walk through a Gate which is clofe adjoyning to the Tabernacle. This Walk is call’d the Street otTcharbag, or the Street of Four Gardens, A Channel runs all along the Walk from the Tabernacle, where a little Rivulet falls into it, and fills it as far as the great Bridge. The two (ides of the Channel which are piv’d with Stone, and are two or threeFootbroad, makes pne way which Paffengers may, and many times do take j for the ufual way both for Horfe and Foot, lyes upon each tide of the Walk, behind the Trees, Which are panted in a (freight line to the very Walls of the King’s Gardens, which clofe the Alley on each 'tide. It is a kind of a Caufey of Free-ltone, fomewhat rais’d, and four or five Foot broad. There is but one row of Trees on each fide, ftraight and high, call’d Tcbinards, with one tuft at the top. The fpacs between the Channel and the Trees is not pav’d, but lyes common, and is fometimes fow’d. About two hundred Paces from theTabernacleor Banqueting houfe, the River falls into a great Pool, about thirty or thirty-five Foot in diameter •, and in that place, as alfo in others fomewhat beyond it, where there are alfo other Pools, the Walk is crofs’d by a Caufey pav’d and rais’d, fen or twelve Foot broad, as the reft are. Upon the left hand of the firft Pool ftands another Tabernacle or Banqueting-houfe, much alike in ftmdure andbignefs to the former*, in which place, in a low arch’d Room with a Fountain of Water in the middle, you may go and drink Coffee. From that houfe to the Bridge the Walk defcends, and the Water makes fome falls. All the Gardens on each hde of the Walk, both on this fide and beyond theBridge belong to the King. But you muft not imagin that thefe Gardens, or that of Hezardgerib, which is the faireft of all Perfia, are fo curioufly fet out, nor fo well kept as oats in Europe. For they have no fuch lovely Borders, nor fuch clofe Walks ot Honeyfuckles and Jafrnin as are to be feen in the Gardens of Europe. They fuffer the Gralsto grow in many places i contented only with a good many great Fruit-trees, tufted a-top,^ and planted in a line, which is all the grace of the Gardens of Perfia. In each fide of the Walls between which the Walk runs, at a true diftance of fpace, are gates neatly contriv’d, and over each a little Room. Almoft in the middle of the Walk between the great Banqueting-houfe and the Bridge, upon the left hand, ftands a Houie of the Dervis, to whom the King has given one of his Gardens to build upon. There they keep the Relicks of Haly, or fome other Prophet *, for you (hail fee them ftanding under a certain Arch, before which the Perfians make a moft profound Reverence. Thefe Dervis corns every Afternoon about three or four a Clock into the Bazars of Ifyahan, every two, an old one and a young one, choofing hts quarter, f hey go from Shop to Shop, inftru&amp;ing the People upon fome Point or other of the Law : the young Dervis anfwering the old ones at certain tirnes.^ Their Habit is only two Sheep skins or Goat-skins, the one hanging before, the orner behind, with a great leathern Girdle, four or five fingers broad, garnifh’d with feveral great Plates of Fatten. They throw another Sheep-skin crofs their houicers, which they tye before,under their Chins.Upon their Heads they only wear a little Lamb-skin in form of a Bonnet, letting the feet hang down to their Necks, V 2 over77&gt;&lt;? Persi an Travels Book IV over thrit Cheeks. They carry a great Club in their hands,as the Painters rep K f ent J 0 l, n the Baplid in the Wildernefs. Between their Girdles and their walls they ftllf r a company of pitiful Flowers, or elfe a fort of Herbs, which after Exhortation both the young, and the old Vervt’s beftow upon the Merchants and Tradef m e„’ from whom at the fame time they receive Alms. T oward the evening they go homj again i and l forgot to tell you, that before the door of the houfe, (lands always a large Veffel of water , with feveral little Cups, and Ice in the Summer, where all paffengers may drink upon free-coft. The River of Senderou, which, as well as the reft of the Rivers of Per/L*, except the ArM) is not able to carry a Boat, is a very great relief to Iffiahan, Behind the Mountains of the South beyond Zulpba is another River, call’d Abkiiren , which a- bout 'five or fix Leagues above Ifpahan, runs within a League and a half of Sender ou, Sha-Abas the firft attempted to have joyn’d the two Rivers together,to whichpuri pofe he went about to have remov’d certain Rocks that ftood in his way •, but not being able to compafs his defign, his SuccefTors laid aftde all the thoughts of attem. pting any more. Could it have been done, the Campaign of Ifpahan would have been one of the moft fertile and delicious places in the world,whereas nowtheRiver is of no ufe, running through defart Coutreys and Plains of Salt. As for the River of SeMerou, in Winter it over-flows, but in Summer it has very little water, being oftner foarded than crofs’d over upon Bridges. About four Leagues above they are conflrain’d to force it into their Lands, to water their Fields and Grounds, which elfe would produce nothing at all. Wells they have a great many in feveral places; but befides that, they are not able to furnifti that great quantity of water which is neceffary j the River Water is much better to fatten the Land. Now you muft ob- ferve,that their Channels never return to the River,being wafted upon the Ground; fo that the River of Ifpahan being very much wafted before it comes to the City, by reafon that it is ftill leffen’d by fo many Channels,about ten or twelve Leagues from thence, it ends as it were quite fpent in a few Merfties. This fcarcity of water which is lb general over all Perfia^s the reafon that they are extraordinary Husdands of it, and buy it very dear. Therefore is the Superintendent of the water, which brings the King in a very confiderable Revenue, one of the moft contended-for em ployments in the whole Court. For every Garden is tax’d more or lefs according to its bignefs, for the water it requires once a week *&gt; which water is let go into the quarters which have need of if, every Garden having a particular Channel, whence they have their water by turns. But you muft have a care of attempting to bring this water in before your turn* tor (hould it come to be known, anealie Fine would not excufe the matter. I knew two Fr^j,who.becaufe they prefum’d to take in water in the night time before it was their turn, had like to have loft all their Land by Contifcation, had it not been for the particular Favour of the King to the Fr^/,andyetall that favour did not excufe them from being foundly amerc’d. There are four Bridges a quarter of a Leagues diftance one from another, thatcrofs the River of Senderou to Ifpahan, That which crofles the walk, bears the name of Alywrdi-Kan^ who caus’d it to be built, being alfo call’d the Bridge of Zulfa. It is built of good Brick, joy n’d together with Frce-ftone, and very level, not being higher in the middle than at either end.It is not above three hundred and fifty paces long, and twenty broad, being fupported by feveral (mall Arches of Stone, which are very low. Of each fide there is a Gallery eight or nine foot broad, which runs from one end to the other, feveral Arches twenty five or thirty foot high fupporting the Platform,where,when the heat is not extream,they that pleafe may walk for the fake of the frefh Air. But the moft ufual pafifage is under the Galleries, where there are feveral out lets upon the River, to let in the frelh Air. For the Galleries are very high, from the level of the Bridge, to which you afeend by eafie Reps, the middle of the Bridge not being above twenty five foot broad, ferving for Wagons and Pack-horfes. There is alfo another way all along by the water fide, where there are feveral Stones laid to ftep upon, to keep you from being wet-lhod. It croiles through all the Arches of the Bridge, through little doors made in every Arch from one end to the other, defeending from the Bridge by a little pair ot Stairs, tak’n out of the thicknefs of the Arches fupporters. There is another Stair* cafe to afeend up to the Galleries of about two fathoms broad, with Stays or Rails on both ildes. This Bridge is truly a very neat piece of Archite&amp;ure, if I roa J not fay, the neateft in all Perfia* ' ^ heieChap. VI. of Monfieur Tavernier. 157 * 1 ThciC are alfo three other Bridges upon the River, one above the Bridge of Zulfa, and two below. The hrh but meanly built, but very commodious for the Armnms^ when they travel Well ward, who would elfe be forc’d to go a great way about, through the whole City of JJpahan. The tirll of the other two Bridges below the Bridge of Zulfa, was built by Sba- Abas the fecond, Father of the prefent King. It is almoft equal to it in Stru&amp;ure* but it has one particular beauty, which is a hexagonal place in the middle of the Bridge, which caufes the Water to fall in that part with a pleating noife. For that being the deeped part of the River, Sha-Abas refolv’d to build a Bridge there ';, partly for the Gaurs lake, to the end, they might not come through the walk of fchar bag, and that going from Ifpaban they might have a (horter cut home. The Habitation ot the Gaurs is only a large Village, the fird Houfes whereof are but a little way from the Rivers though the walk that goes foom Ifpaban to the KingsBridge is both longer and broader than that of Tcbarbag, planted on both (ides with a row of Trees, but no Channel in the middle. Before each of the Avenues to the Bridge, Bands a Houfe that belongs to the King for his divertilement. That upon the left fide of the River toward Ifpaban was by the great Sha* Abas giv’nto the Capuchins, For as Boon as they came to Jfpa-&gt; ban, up on dieir Examination, the King wasextreamly tak’n with their behaviour. He ask’d them how they liv’d, and whether they took any money ? To which the Capuchins making anfwer, that they never handled any money, but contented them- ^ felves with Alms s the King believing his Subjedfs, would give them very little, \ bellow’d that Houfe and Garden upon them. But they day’d not long there, be- caufe it was too big for them to repair, and too far from the City, fo that the Roman- Catholic^ in the Winter could not get to their Chappel. Now they have built them- felvesa very handfom Houfe not far from the King’s Palace, at the Cod of Father Jofepb, one of their own order. There is another old Bridge a quarter of a League below the Gaurs Bridge, which is upon the Road from Ifpaban to Sckiras. But to return to the long-walk of Tcbarbag, which continues above eight hun dred paces beyond the Bridge of Zulfa to the Garden of Hezardgerib. The Rivu let that pafles that other part of the walk, comes from the fame River which they have cut three or four Leagues above Ifpaban. When you have walk’d about four hundred paces, you met with a fall of Waters that tumbles into a Poid, from whence there are twelve heps to afeend to the end of the Alley. The walk is fronted by the great Houfe which hands before the Garden of Hezardgerib, or the tboufand Acres. The Houfe conlids but only of one great Hall over the Gate, and four fmall Chambers at the fourxorners of it. Hczirdgerib is the faireft Garden in Afia, though it would be acounted no thing in Europe. H awever as it lies upon the defeent of a Hill, it confifts of lixteen Teraffes, fultain’d by a Wall fix teen or feventeen foot high. There is but little Water in any of the Wells j but that which has mod is in the fourth Terrafs. That is a great Octagonal Pool about a hundred and twenty foot in Diameter, round about which are feveral Pipes that throw up the Water about three foot high, and there are three deps down to the Water. A Channel pav’d with Stone runs through the principal Alley, which goes no farther than the building. This Channel is as wide as that of the Channel of Tcbarbag, whence it is fupply’d as being right oppo- fite to it. In the tenth Terrafs you meet with another Fountain of the fame bignefs and form with that in the fourth i and in the lad which terminates the Grand Alley and the length of the Garden, there is another Channel which erodes all the Alleys which, like the great one cotnpofe the leng'h of the Alley. Befides this, there are op’a Room? to take the frelh Air, feme falls and murmurs of Water, but for tnrders and clofe Alleys, and Arbours, you mud expedfc no fueh thing, either in Hez trdgerib, nor in any other part of Perfta. Having walk’d in the great walk o£ Tcbarbag, you meet upon the right hand with a Street between two Walls of the Gardens that belong to the King, which Street leads you to not above two or three Mufquet Shots didance off. / ZuJfa a Colony of Armenians which Sha-Abas brought from Zulfa, a City of Armenia, is lo much encreas’d for fome years dnee, that it may now pafs for aThe Persian Travels BookIV large City, bdng almdft a League and a half long, and near upon half aSf , broad. There are two principal Streets which contain near upon the whole lena^ one whereof has on each Tide a row of Tchinars^ the roots whereof are refreft’dbv firull Channel of Water, which by a particular order the Armenians bring to l* City, to water their Gardens. The molt part of the other Streets have alfoaro^r Trees, and a Channel. And for their Houfes, they are generally better bulk, and more chearful than thofe of Ifpaban. Defm- How they came to be fetled here, I have already deferib’d: And now the number lal ' of Inhabitants is ftrangely increas’d by the accefTion of feveral other Chriftians of divers Sedfs, as Jacobites, Copbtes, and Nejiorians, who formerly liv’d in the Suburbs cf Jfpahan. Neither was Sba-Abat fo cruel in tranfplanting the Armenians away out of their own Countrey, for they were all at that feafon poor labouring men who knew not at all what belong’d to Trade. Since that time they are groyvn very rich fo that the Armenians have no caufe to be covetous of the Habitations of their Ancdicrs. And now I will tell you how they came to be fuch great Proficients in Trade. Sha-AbM,who was a man of a great Genius,and a perfon of great undertaking confidering that Perfia w^s a barren Countrey, where there was little Trade, and by confequence little Money, rtfolv’d to fend his Subjedfs into Europe with raw Silks fo to underhand whence the hell profit would arife, to bring Money into his Country To which purpofe, he ufolv’d to make himfelf Mafter of all the Silk in his own Country, by purchaiing ithimfelf at a reafonable rate, tax’d by himfelf, and to reap the gains by his Fadfors: and withal, thought it needfary to feek an Alliance with the great Kings o£Europe, to engage them on his fide againft the Turk. He firftfent to the King of France, Henry the Fourth. But he dying before the Am- baflador arriv’d, anfwer was made the AmbafTador, That if the King of ferfu had any thing to fay to the King of France Lewis the Thirteenth, he trmft fend a new Ambaffador, which was never done. Three or four years after he fent an AmbafTadpr to the King of Spain, accom* pany’d with a Perfian Merchant of Ifpaban, putting into their hands a confiderable quantity of Bales of Silk. He alfo fent along with them a Portuguez Auftin-Fm, to be their Guide and Interpreter. The Perfian Merchant would have fold the Silks, as was the King’s order, and have bought a Prefent more becoming, But the Ambaffador over-rul’d by the Friar, refolv’d to prefent the King of Spain with the Bales of Silk. The Merchant notable to oppofe the Ambaffador, returns home forthwith to give an account to the King, who approv’d his management. The Ambaffador proceeds, and coming to the Spanijh Court, prefents his Bales ofSilk to the King, who ask’d the Ambalfador, whether his Mailer took him fora Woman, that he had fent him fo many Bales ofSilk to fpin ^ and immediately fent away the Prefent to his Queen, prefen ting the Ambaffador but very meanly: who thereupon feeing theErrour he had committed, made haft home - , but upon his return, the Perfian King having notice of the ill fuccefs of his Negotiation, caus’d his Belly to be ript op’n in the publtck Market-place. About fifteen years after, he trufted a conflderable quantity ofSilk with a Merchant’s Son otIfpaban, and fent him to Venice: who when he came there, took a {lately Lodging, andfpent his Money at a flrange rate, efpecially among the Courtif ans •, to maintain whicly expence, he continually fold great quantities of Silk. The Venetians feeing a private man live fo fplendidly among them, and not believing fo great a quantity of Goods could belong to one fingie Merchant, but rather imagining him to be a Factor for feme Company who fuffer’d for his folly, wrote to all the Portsof the Lezyaw/, and having intelligence who he was, the Senate thought fjt tofeize his Perfon and his Goods, before he had confum’d all •, at the fame time giving a civil account to the King of Per ft a, what they had done. To whichthe Per fun King return’d a moft obliging Anfwer of Thanks, fending withal an intelligent Perfun Merchant to take an account of what was left, to whom the Venetians were very pun&amp;ual. As for the Prodigal Perfian, who thought it not his wifelt way to return into Perfia, what became of him is not material co this Story. Sha-Ahas by thefe Experiments obferving the little inclination ofhisSubje&amp;to 1 rade, who were naturally addidfed to Pride and Expence, which is no partofa Merchant’s bufinefs^ caff his Eyes upon the Armenians, men able to endure the 'A labourChap. VI. of Monfieur Tavernier. j |q labour of long Journeys, iober per Cons, and great Husbands, and fuch who being Chriftians, might more freely Trade among the Chriftians b and made choice of them, as being mod proper and fit for Trade. Whereupon, picking out the moft Judicious among them, he deliver'd to every one fo many Bales of Silk, according to their Capacity s for which they were to pay at their return, a reafonable Rate tax’d by the King, who allow’d them what more they got for their Expences and Gains. Thofe people in a ihort time became fo expert, that there is not any fort of Trade which they will not now undertake * for now they run as far asTztpqjtM&gt; Java^ and the Phillippinei^ and indeed over all the Eaft, except China and Japan. But if they do not thrive, they never return *, as being a place where they muft either give an exadf Account, or elfe fuffer the quick and fevere Jufticeof Drubbing,which never fails thofe Fadtors that are ill Husbands for their Mahers. And indeed the Armenians are fo much the more fit for Trading, becaufe they are a people very fparing, and very fober i though whether it be their virtue or thdr avarice, 1 know not. For when they are going a long Journey, they only make provition of Bisket, fmoak’d Eufaid’s flefh,Onions, bak’d Butter,Flowr,Wine, and dry’d Fruits. They never buy frefh Vidfoals, but when they meet with Lambs or Kids very cheap in the Mountainous Countries i nor is there one of them r that does not carry his Angle to fi(h withal, when they come to any Ponds or * Rivers. All thefe provifions coft them little the Carriage. And when they come foany Town where they are to flay, they club five or iix together, and lye in an empty Chamber which they furnilh themfelves i every one carrying his Mattrefs, his Coverlet, and his Kitchin-Inftruments, which is a great piece of Thrift, When they travel intoChriftendom, they cany along with them Saffron, Pepper, Nutmegs^ and other Spices j which they exchange in the Country-Towns for Bread, Wine, Batter, Cheefe, Milk-Meats, and other Provilions which they buy of the poor Wo men. When they return out of Chriflendom, they bring along with them all forts of Mercery-ware, and Pedlery-ware of Norembsrg and Veniceb as little Looking- glaffes, trifles of Tin enamel’d, falfe Pearls, and other things of that nature b which pays for the Victuals they call for among the Country-people. In the beginning of their Trade, there return’d very few Caravans into Perfia without two hundred thoufand Crowns in Silver, beflde Englijh and Dutch Clothes, . fine Tiffucs,'Looking-glaffes, PWce Pearls, Cochenel, and Watches j which they thought mofi proper for the Sale of Perfia and India. At length thofe Armenians became fo exquifite in Trade, that fevetal of them have left Eftates of two, fome twenty thoufand Tomans* But the richefi: among them was Cotgia^ot Monfieur Petm^who left forty thoufand Tomans in coyn’d Money, befides his Horfes» Furniture, and Lands in the Country, his Jewels and Plate b all which are never reckon’d a Merchant’s Eftate, but only the ready Cafh with which he trades. Cotgia Petrus was very much efteem’d for his Charity, and the great Church which he built, which is a kind of Covent, with a Bifhop and Monks. Nor is the fair Market-place, all environ’d with Shops, a little beholding to his Gene- rolity. \ &gt; The Armenians of Zulpha have this advantage over all the Chriftians of the Eaft, that they enjoy Lands and Priviledges, the King not permitting the leaft injuftice to be done them, nor that any Mahometan (hould live at Zulpha. They have alfo the priviledge to be as well clad as the Perfians, and to make ufe as they do of Bri dles of Gold and Silver. Their Wives alfo are very richly habited, in ftrip’d Sattins 1 purfl’dAvich Gold, and other rich European Silks. The King names whom he pleafes among the Armenians to be their Chief* whom they call Kdonter, who judges all their differences, and taxes them to make up the Sum which they are to pay to the King every year. The Language of the Armenians is either vulgar or learned ; the learned is only us’d by theEcclefiafticks, in reference to their Religion. They write like us, from the Idt to the right, having found out peculiar Gharadfers about four years fince. They have three Languages very natural to them, which however are very different * the Armenian, which is their ancient Countrytfpeech, which they have preferv’d Rom Father to Son * the Perfian, which is the Language of the Country where they live * and the Turbjfh, of which they make very much ufe in courfe of Trade. As for their Women, they fpeak nothing but the Armenian^ having no converfe with . \ . F Grangers, /71* Persi ftraneers, and never ftining out of their houfes. There are fome Armenians fp^ Italian and French, as having learnt it In Europe. There are in Zulpba fifteen or fixteen Churches and Chappels of the Armenian, among which you arc to count two Nunneries for Women. There are in 7 ^ Artin.Ftms, Carmelites, and Capuchins, and in Zulpha fusts. 1 he &gt;/^ that came laft have but alittle Houfe, but to make them amends they have a large Garden, Though the number of the Religious Teachers is far greater then the number of Hearefs: for in all Ifpahan and Zulpha, take the Franks that come out of or born in Perfia, as well Men as Women, there are not fix hundred perfons that profef s the Catholick Religion. As for the Armenians, they are fo obftinately fix’d to their own Religion, that they will hear of no other -, and nothing but Money has fotne. times caus’d them to feign the embracing of another. Friar Ambrofe a Capuchin (hid awhi eat Zulpba, to whom feveral of the principal Armenians came to School t 0 learn 1 French, in hopes of eftablifiiing a Trade with France. But the Amenm Archbifhop and Bilhops fearing left the Children fhould be infeded with fome other Religion,excommunicated all Fathers that fent their Children to School.And finding that they little regarded the Excommunication, they (hut up the Church doors, and ftir’d up the People againft the Religious Franks h fo that Father Ambrofe was forc’d to leave Pcr^, and retire to _ Moreover there are in Ifpahan both Jews and Indian Idolaters. Nor are the Jv?, fo referable and beggarly, as they feem to be;they intrude, according tocuftonynto all Bufinefs •&gt; fo that if any has a mind to buy or fell any rich Jewel, he need do no more but fpeak to them. In the Reign of Sba-Abas, the Athemadoulet perfected then) fo grievouily, that either by force or by cunning he caus’d them to turn Mabometm but the King undemanding that only power and fear had conftrain’d them to turn, fufter’d them to refume their own Religion, and to live in quiet. There are about ten or twelve thoufand Banians in Ifpahan,whoate known by their yellow Complexions,or rather by a yellow Mark made with Saffron upon the top of their Foreheads. Their Turbants are lefs than ufual, and their Shoes are almoiilike ours, embroider’d with Mowers a-top. They are all Bankers, and very knowing in Money. The greateft part of the Money of the principal Money’d men of Ifskn is in their hands for improvement fake. So that if you want a confiderableSum,yoii may have it the next day upon good Security,and paying a fevere Intereft,which thofc Banians will fqueez up fometimes to iS per Cent. But if it be not very privately exacted and paid, the Law of Mahomet, which forbids the taking of Intereft, lays hold upon the whole Sum, andconfifeatesit every Penny. C H A P. VII.

T H E difference among the Mahometans, doth not confift in thfc different Explanations which they put upon the Alcorans but in the feveral Opi nions which they hold concerning the firft Succdlbrs of Mahomet, from which have aris’n two particular Sedfs entirely oppofite i the Se&amp; the Smnis, and the Se6t of the Schiais. The firft, wfio are of the Turkijh belief, maintain that Abm-bakgr fucceeded im mediately to Mahomet, as his Vicar or Vicegerent *, tohim 0 »wri to Omar OfjnM to Ofman Mortuz- Aliy Nephew and Son-in-law to Mahomet by Marriage of nis Daughter. Th2it Ofman was Secretary to Mahomet, lyctfon ot Courage, as well as the other three; and that they were all valiant Souldiers, and great Captains, who extended their Conquefts more by force of Arms than by Reafon. And thence it comes that the Smnis will not allow of Difputes, but propagate and maintain their Religion altogether by force. The Schiais, who are of the Ferftan belief deteft Abou-baker, Omar, and Ufurpers to the Succeffion of Mahomet, which only belong’d to HAy, his N e P ^Chap. VII. of Monfieur Tavernier. and Son-in-law.

The Per funs hold the fame belief as to the laft Iman, as we do of Enoch and Elias\ which is the reafon that feveral people leave them in their Wills Houfes ready furnilh’d, Stables full of (lately Horfes, and other neceflTaries for them to make ufe of when they return to Earth again. They attribute to this Iman the Sirname of Zahib- zaman, or Lord of Time. Thefe two Sedfs op Sunnis and Schias over-run the three principal Kingdoms of India, viz. the Great Mogul's, the King of Golcondts, and the King of Vtfapours. The firft and laft being Sunnis, that is to fay, both the Kings and Lords of the Court i for their Subje&amp;s are moft of them Idolaters. Some Schiais there are in the Courts of both Kings, in regard the Officers of the Army are for the moft part Perfans, though in outward (hew they may follow the Religion of the Prince. But the King oPGolconda Koutoub-Sba is a zealous Schiais. I come now to the Grand Feftivai of the Perfians, which is the famous Feaft of Hocen and Huffein. , Eight days before the Feftivai begins, fome of the more zealous fort black all their Bodies and their Faces, and go naked in the Streets with only a covering about their fecret parts. They carry two Flints, one in each hand, which they knock one againft another, wry thing their Bodies, and making a thoufand antick Faces j and all the while crying out, Hujfein, Hocen i Hocen, Hujfein \ which they adt and (peak with fo much.Labour, ’till they foam again at the mouth. In the Evening* the devout people admit them into their Houfes, and feed them very well. During thofe days, as foon as the Sun is fet, you (hall fee at the corners where feveral Streets meet, Pulpits fet up for certain Preachers, who prepare the people that flock to hear them to the devotion of the Feaft. Now in regard all Ages, and Sexes go, there is no time in all the year fo favourable for the Women to meet their Gal lants. In the year 1 6S’], the third of July, I faw the Feftivai by the favour of theN^r* who appointed me a place juft againft the Vela where the King fate. This Vela is a Room built with a jetting upon that fide of the Meidan next the Palace Gate, one ftory high. Several Pillars fuftain the flat bottom or floor of the Vela, en rich’d with a Grotefco work of Gold and Azure, in the mid’ft whereof there was a Fountain that was fill’d with Water by the contrivance of a Pipe. The Stage or Vela was op’n upon three fides, the longeft fide jetting out upon the Piazza. Upon the Wall of the oppofite fiie, which was clofe, were to be feen feveral Englijh and Hollanderjj both men and women pidtur’d with Bottles and Glafles in their hands, as if they were drinking to one another.

That the Ahrologers of that time, by their skill in the Stars knew °f the Birth of that Infant lent by God, who was to govern Men, and reign in their Hearts. That thofe Ahrologers went and declai’d the fame thing to the King, telling him that there was a Child fuddeniy to be born, that would one day reprive him of his Crown. Whereupon the faid King, call! and a great Ty-rant, caus’d allthe Women with Child to be put to death, through the whole extent of his Dominions. But by a Miracle the big Belly of the Mother of their Prophet not appearing, fe remain’d undifcover’d,and brought forth a Son. Her Husband, who knew nothing of this Myftery, fearing he fhould lofe his head if he did not difeover tne bufmefs to the King, before he found it out another way, went and conrels d diat he had a Child born, but that he knew nothing of her being with Child. Now you muft know, that contrary to the cuftom of other Children, that cryfo fbon as they come out of the Mot hers womb, this Child laugh o fo loon as he was born, For being to triumph over the Hearts of the people, he was to (hew bgns of joy ho that the people began already to rejoycein their future felicities. This being ngnitid to the King, he call’d his Aftrologers together, to tell him the meaning offoextraor- dinary a thing, and what would become of the Infant. But the Mrologers not being able to fatisfie him, he fent for the Infant, and would have (lain him witha Sword with his own hand, but God dry’d up his Arm immediately^ -o mat he could not. However, not teriifi’d with fo great a punKhment, tranfported with Choi j, k caus’d a great Fire to be kindled, and commanded the Infant to be thrown into if, But by the power of God, the Fire which he had prepar d to con Cine thu Infant turn’d into a Bed of Rofes, where the Child moftfweetly repos d.

They allow their Prophet three Children, who are not yet come into the world, though their names be already giv’n them.

As to the Ceremony of Marriage, the Prieft, when the Couple come to him, asks the * Man and the Woman in the prefence of Witnefles, whether they both confent; then taking a little Water he fays a few Prayers over it, and then waftiing both their Fore- heads he pronounces certain words, and there’s all. But they are not to marry within ' the third degree *, nor do they know what it means to defire a Difpenfation. But you muft obferve by the way, that though they are allow’d five Wives, thereis r but one which can be truly faid to be marry’d, with whom they are oblig’d tolyeat leaft two nights in a week, Fryday and Saturday, and (he always goes before the reft, I But if (he have no Children in feven years, the man is allow’d to marr^ another,but not to repudiate the other, whom he is bound ftill to maintain according to his quality, So foon as Women or Maids perceive the cuftom of Nature upon them, they pre- fently leave their Houfes, and ftay alone in the Fields in little Hints made of Hurdles or Watlings, with a Cloth at the entring in, which feives for a Door.While theyare in that condition, they have Meat and Drink brought them every day jar^d when they are free, they fend according to their quality, a Kid, or a Hen, or a Pigeon for an Offering j after which they go to the Bath, and then invite fome few of thdr Kind red to feme fmall Collation.

They have alfo thirty Holy- days in honour of thirty of their Saints, which they keep very ftridily, no man dar ing to work. But the day of the Birth of their Prophet is celebrated with an extra- , ordinary Pomp i betides, that then they beftow large Alms.

But if the Crow fixes upon the left Eye, then they take it for an ill Omen, return home fad, without fpeaking to one another; give no Alms, nor eat nor drink. Of their Adoration of tire. T He Gaurs would not be thought to give Honour to Fire under the title of Ado- ration.For they do not account themfelves Idolaters,faying that theyacknow- . . but only one God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, whom they only adore. As for the Fire, they preferve it and reverence it, in remembrance of the great Miracle, bv which their Pr&gt; phet was deliver’d from the Flames. One day being at Kerman, 1 defil’d to fee that Fire, but they anfwer’d me, they could not permit me. For fay the? one day the Kan of Kerman being defirous to fee the Fire, not daring to do otherwiie they (hew’d it him. He it feems expeded to fee fome extraordinary Bikhtnefs; but when he faw no more then what he might have feen in a Kitchin or a Chamber-fire, fella (wearing and fpitting upon’t as it he had been mad. Where- m»n the Sacred Fire being thus profan’d, flew away in the form of a white Pigeon. The Ptiefts confidering then their misfortune,which had happen d through their own indiferetion, fell to their Prayers with the People, and gave Alms s upon which, at , the fame time, and in the fame form the Sacred Fire return d to its place : which makes them fo (hy to Ihew it again.When they put any perfons to their Oaths, they Swear them before this Fire s for they think no perfon (o impious, as to fwearfalfe before that Sacred Fire, which they take for the Witnefs of their Oath. Their Priefis put them in dread of very great puni[hments,and threat n them that the _ hea venly Fire will forfake them, if they prove fo wicked as to fwear falfely before it. Of their Manners T fc Language of the Gaurt is different from the Perftans,as is their Chara^er and manner of Writing. They love tofeaft, and M eat. and drink well, being.very ptofufe cf their Wine and Strong-water. They never eat Hares, bccaufe they have their monthly Purgations, like Women: fojtthe fame re^fon they never eat Mulber ries, believing that they partake of the nature of Women and Hjks. If when they comb their Hair or their Beards,any one hair happ’ ns t o fall upon tfceir cipaths, thofi: deaths muft be wa(b’d in the dale of a Cow or an Ox to punfie them again. If by chance they happ’n to touch any ordure or nalhnefs, when they cpme home they mult w 3 (h themfelves in the fame Unn.ifone of their ‘ ® ^ Corps in the High-way,and chances to fee it, he is obhgdto wafl^ himfclfnCQvs- Pifs, which they hold to be a good Purification: an Opinion held m fom part of Ma alfo. I ask’d one of their Prietts howthey came to underhand the virtue of t his Urin i who anfwet’d me.that a certain perfon who w as contcmpoiaiy with the hrft Man,having his Arm bruis’d and very black,by reafon of feme accident th« befel him through the malice of the Devil,fell afleep in the fields, and as he lay,an Ox ftalmg, a drop of the Utin flew upon his Arm,and prefently heal d that part which it wet,and relior’d it to its former whitenefs: which the man perceiving when he w ak d, pre- fently follow’d the Ox, and (laid by him ’till he Hal’d again, and then receiving the Pi(s upon the whole wound,was perfe&amp;ly cut d. They alio prefeive it,a n it witha Water, which they caufe them to drink who have committed any bin,att« they have been at Confeflion for it. They call that Water the C&lt;jzis a e *j’ Urin ought to be preferv’d forty days,with an infufi on of Willow-Bark,and certain Herbs. When any perfon, is confefs’d of his Sin, if it be a crying Sin, the patty is bound to ftay ten days in the Cazts Houfe, and not to eat or drink ut ^ Priett gives them. And in order ro Abfolution, the Prieft ^ l # P s na e ’ an , t^es a little Dog to his right great Toe, which he leads with him about thef 168 The Persian Travels Book IV Houfc wherever he goes, fometimes a whole day, fometimes lom — —J, longer arrnJ' to the hainoufnefs of the crime. In that pofture he defires the Cazi ^ m'TlH telling him that for his part he believes himfelf to be purifi’d.The Prieft make ^ S that it is the Dog that muft purifie him, and not .he. After that he dowk i an Wet .andfo »d in pounded water feven times upon his head, then gives him a draught to drink' he is abfolv’d. This Penitence cofls the criminal Sawce, who is afterwards bo * feaft all his friends at the Cazis Houfe. Being furpriz’d at this fuperftition v whether the women were (hrifted thus by the Cazi i but I found that the f ? Wives confefs and abfblve the women and maids. One more ftrange cuftom they have, that when a man is upon the point of ,1 they take a little Dog and fet it upon the expiring parties bred. When [ ' ^ breathing his laft, they put the mouth of the Dog to the mouth of the pe r f ^ ^ and caufe him to bark twice in thatpofiure, that the Soul of the deceas’d — into the Dog, who they fay will deliver it into the hands of the Angel w ^ to receive it. Moreover when any Dog happ’ns to dye, they carry him oofT^ City, and pray to God for the Carrion, as if the Beaft receiv’d any kindneff death by their Prayers. Of the Beajis y which they love or hate. T Here are fome Beafts which the Gaurs do mightily refpetSf, and to whicU » give a great deal of Honour. There are others which they as much abh and which they endeavour’d to defiroy as much as in them lies, believing thattl! 1 were not created by God, but that they came out of the body of the Devil whf ill nature they retain. The Beafts which they principally admire are the Cow, the Oxe and flv Dog. They are exprcfly forbid to eat of the flefti of a Cow or an Oxe, or to kill them. The reafon why they fo efteem thefe Creatures is, becaufe the 6xc labo for man, and Ploughs the Ground that produces his food. As for the Cow tb more dearly affed her for the Milk (he gives, but efpecially for the purifying ou? lity of her Urine. ; 84 The Creatures which they abhor are Adders, Serpents, Lizards, Toads Frogs Creyfifh, Rats, Mice, but above all the reft Cats ^ which they fay are thereto blance of the Devil, who gave them fo much firength that a man can hardly kil! them i fo that they rather fuffer the inconveniency of Rats and Mice, than ever to keep a Cat in their Houfes. # As for the other Animals before-mention’d, if any of the Gaurs fall fick, tb hire poor people to go and find thofe Creatures out and kill them *, which they reck’n in the number of thofe good works that comfort fhe Souls of the deceas’d. The rea fon why they hate them fo, is, becaufe they believe the Devils make ufe of them to torment the Damn’d * and therefore they do a Work of charity that deftroy them, whereby they mitigate the pains and torments of Souls in Hell.

I x ' ' ’ ■ , * I' ' / + S ince the Armenians Traded into TLurofe and began to be Travellers, their Churches are better fet out then they were heretofore. They fpare no coft to adorn the Choir and the Altar you tread upon rich Carpets, and for the ftru&amp;ure and embellifbments of it, they employ the bed Workmen and the choiceft Materials they can meet with. From the body of the Church to the Choir there is ufually an afeent of five or fix Steps. Nor is there above one Altar in any „ Church, upon which they fet the Confecrated Bread, before they fet the Chalice where the Wine is. When the Mafe for the Ceremony is faid by an Arch-bi(hop, at the rea ding of the Gofpel they light an abundance of Wax Tapers, which Tapers are like Torches. After the Gofpel is read, feveral of the Noviciates take fticks in their Hands about five foot long, at the end whereof are Fatten Plates with little Bells hanging about them, which when they are (bak’d, imitate the found of Cymbals. Other Noviciates there are which hold a Copper Plate in their Hands hung about with Bells, which they firike one againft another : and at the fame time the Ecclefi- afticfy and Laity (ing together indifferent Harmonioufly. All this while the Arcfi- biihop has two BiQiops of each fide of him, who are in the room of a Dean and a Sub-dean •, and when it is time, he goes and unlocks a Window in the Wall on the Gofpel fide, and takes out the Chalice where the Wine is. Then .with all his Mufick he takes a turn about the Altar, upon which he at length fets down the Cha lice, faying certain Prayers. After that, with the Chalice in his hand, and the Bread upon the Chalice, he turns toward the People, whoprefently profirate themfelves upon the Ground, beat their Bretts, and kifs the Earth, while the Arch*bKhop pronounces thefe words ‘This is the Lord who gave his Body arid Blood for you. Then he turns toward the Altar, and eats the Bread dip’d in the Winei for they never drink the Wine, but only dip the Bread in it. That done, the Arch*bi(hop turns once more toward the people with the Bread and Chalice in his hand, and they that will receive, come one after another to the bottom of the Choir, whither it is not lawful for any Lay-perfon whatfoever to afcend i to whom the Arch-biObop gives the Bread dip’d in Wine that is in the Chalice, which Bread is without leven, flat, and round, about as thick as a Crown, and as big as the Hoft of the Mafs, being Confecrated the day before by the Prieft, whofe Office it is. They never put Water in their Communion-Wine*, affirming that Water is for Bap- tifm, and that Chrift when he inftituted the Holy Supper drank it pure, without any mixture of Water. When the Armenians come to the Communion, the Arch-biftiop or the Prieft Lys thefe words: I confifs and believe that this is the Body and Blood of the Son of God, who takes away the ftns of the IVorld, who is not only ours, but the Salvation of all Manhjnd. The Prieft repeats thefe words three times to the people, to inftrudt them and to teach them to what end they receive the Sacrament.Every time the Prieft fays the words, the people fay after him word for word”*, and when the Prieft ferves the people, he breaks the Hoft into little bits which he dips in the Wine, and gives to every one of the Communicants. That which I moft wonder at is, that they give the Communion to Children of two or three months ojd, which their Mothers bring in their Arms i though many times, the Children put it out of their mouths again. They never adminifter the Sacrament all the time of their Lent, for then they never fay Mafs but upon noon,which they call Low-Mafs,at which time they never fee the Prieft, who has a Curtain drawn before the Altar, and only reads the Gofpel and Creed aloud. Sometimes upon Lhurfday in the PaflSon week Y ' theyV— 7 ° The Persian Travel* Book IV. ') •' ; thcv fav Low-Mafs about noon,and then they Confefs and adminifterthe Sacnment; But generally they ftay ’till Saturday, and then the Communicants after they have Liv’d, are permitted to eat Fi(h,Eggs, Butter, Cyl, or any thing elfe except Fleft, Upon Eafter day, by break of day, thePneft fays Low-Mafs,Confeffes, and Adtni n j. Bers after which it is lawful to eat Fleth. But the^Beafts rouft be kill d upon Rafter, day- and not fo much as upon Eafter-eve. They have four other Feaftsin the year, wherein they obferve the fame Ceremony, eating neither Flefh, Ftfh, Eggs, Butter nor Ovl for eight days: which four Feafts are Cbridmaf,the Afcenfionyhc Annunciating and St. Georges.

The Midwife carries the Infant to JL Church, and holds it in her arms,Till either the Archbifhop, theBilhop, or the Prieft has fa id feme part ct the Form oi Baptifm. Then he that baptizes takes !he Infant which is naked, and plunges it in the Water, and then taking it out again, puts it into the hands of the God-father, and goes on with the Prayers. While he reads them, with the Cotton which he has in his hand he twifts a firing about half an EU long! He makes another alio of red Silk, which is fiat •, then twitting thofe two firings together, he puts them about the Child’s neck. They fay, that thefe two firings, ore of white Cotton, and the other of red Silk, fignifies the Blood and Water Which flow’d from the Body ofCHRIST, when he was wounded with the Lanceup- ontheCrofs. Having ty’d the cord about the neck of the Child, he takes the holy Oyl and anoints the Child in feveral parts of the body, making the fign of the Crofs in every place where he drops the Oylevery time pronouncing thefe words, I baptize t’m in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghofi. He firft anoints the Forehead, then the Chin, then the Stomach, the Arm-holes, the Hands and Feet. As to the making this Oyl, you mutt know, that every feven years, upon the Eve c f our Lady in Sepfewkr, againft which day they obferve a [rm\\ Lent of eight days, th Patriarch makes this holy Oyh there being no perfonbut he who has power to make it* He ufes all forts of fragrant Flowers, and Aromatical Drugs •, but the principal Flower is that which the Armenians call in their Language Balaffan-Jague, we in ours, the Flower ofParadife. When the Oyl is made, the Patriarch fends two Bottles to all the Covents of Afia, Europe, and Africa, without which they cannot The Ceremony of Baptifm being over, the God-father gees out of the Church with the Infant in his arms, and a Taper of white Wax in each hand. According to the ■quality of theperfon, when the Child is carry’d out of the Church, the Trumpets, Drums, Hautboys, and other Infiiuments of the Country make hideous noife and go before the Infant to the Parents Houfe, where being arriy d, the God-father delivers the Child to the Mother. She profirates her felt at the &gt;ame time before the God-father, kitting his feetsand while file continues in that pofiure, the God-father kiffes her herd. Neither the Father nor the God-father names the Child, but he that, bapmes aives him the Narre of the Saint vvhofe Feftival falls upon the Sunday on which the Child is baptiz’d. If there be no Saint’s day that Sunday in the Almanack, they take the next Name whofe Fefiival fucceeds the Sunday ofBaptifm s ot at t ey have no affeded Names among them. Upon the return of the God-father with the Child home, there is a Feaft prepar’d for all the Kindred and Friends, and him that baptiz’d the infant, with whom all the Prielkand Monks of the Coven t, at lea It of the Parifh, go along. The poor people were wont to be fo prodigal at theie beafis, as alfo upon their Marriages and Burials, that the next day they had not wherewitha. to buy V [duals, much lefs to pay what they have borrow’d for fo needlels an ex- pence. But now the poor Armenians are grown fo cunning to avoid the Ba iina os which are gi’vn to Debtors upon the foies of theFeet, when tney cannot pay, accor - ing to the cuftom of Perfia \ that they carry the Child to Church upon the week days; without any Ceremony, with tears in their eyes, pretending it to be lickly an like to dye,and fo make no Feafis at all. r , If the Women lye in fifteen or twenty days, or two months before Cbrilmas^tney defer the baptizing the Infant ’till the Feftival, provided the Infant be healthy. 1 run in all the Cities and Villages where the Armenians live, if there be any River or Pond, they make ready two or three flat-bottom’d Boats, fpread with Carpets to walk upon &gt; in one of which upon Chriftmas-day they fet up a kind of an Altar. In the morning by Sun-rifing all the Armenian Clergy, as well of that place as c ' J- te: parts adjoyning, get into the Boats in their Habits, with the Grofs and Banner.! hen Y 2 ; ' - 1 the lf i i2 The Persian Travels Book IV. they dip theCrofs in the Water three times, and-every time they drop upon if.

The Ceremony being over he goes to Zulpha to the Kelonter s noufc, where there is ^ entertainment prepar’d for him. Neither is there any place in the World whcrea King tnay be entertain’d with lefs charge than in Perfia. For if any private perron invite the King, and that His Majefly pleafes to do him that Honour, tisbut forthe invicer to go to the chief of the Officers, and to carry him twenty ’Tomans, or three hundred Crowns, and to tell him withall, that the King has promisd to accept ofj fmall Collation with his Slave. For then the Govephour is oblig’d tofend tothe Houfe of him that treats the King all things neceflary for the entertauffiicnt. Elfe it were impoffible to be done, in regard the King eats in nothing but in Gold Plate, At the end of the Feaft the King is always prefented with fome European Rarity, not lefs worth than four or five thoufand Crowns. Or if the perfon have no Rarity to prefent, it fuffices to offer in a Bafon the value in Venetian Ducats of Gold, with all the fubmiffion imaginable. Befides all this, fome Prefents muft be giv’n toiome of the Lords and principal Eunuchs of his train * and others fent to the Queen Mo ther, if living, and to the Sultancfi, his Wives and Sillers. Thus though the enter tainment may be made with little trouble, yet otherwife it proves fomewhat expen- five j though the Armenians cfZulpha are well enough able to bear the charge. I was twice at this Ceremony upon Chriftmas day in Ijpahan. 1 he firfl time I law % Sefi, and the fecond time Sha-Abas the fecond, who drank both fo hard, thatiti their Drink they committed thofe crimes that very much flain d their memories: For Sha-Sefi returning home ftab’d his Wife, the Mother ofS ha-Abas .Sha-Abas ano ther time returning home in drink, would needs drink on, and force three wo men to«etrink with him ■&gt; who finding he would not give over, Role out of his Com pany. The King perceiving them gone without taking leave, in a mad humourfent his Eunuchs for them, and caus’d them to be thrown into the Fire, where the poor women were burnt * for there is no refitting nor examining the Kings com mand. CHAP. X 11. Of the Marriages of the Armenians. H E Armenians Marry their Children before either party have fan eadj other, nay before the Fathers or Brothers know any thing of it. ti they whom they intend to Marry muft agree to what their Fathers ci Parents command them. When the Mothers have agreed anjongmeni* felves, they tell their Husbands, who approve what they have done.

So focn as they are born the Contra ts ^ and when once the Boy has giv’n the Ring, though it be twenty y ea £? a a they are Many’d, he is bound every year upon Eafter-day to fend hw 1 new Habit with all the trimming belonging to it according to her quality ^Chap. XII. of Monfieur T A VERNIER. days before the Celebration of Marriage, the Father and Mother of the Boy prepare a Feaft, which iscarry’d to the houfe of the Father and Mother of the Girl, where the kindred of both parties meet. The Men are in one place by themfelves, and the Women in another) for they never eat together at publrck Ftafts. The Evening before the Nuptials the Bridegroom fends a Habit to the Bride &gt; and fotne time after he comes to receive what the Mother of the Bride has provided for him, on her part. If the Bride has no Mother, fome ancient Woman next a*kin dreffes the Bride. At length the Bride gets upon one Horfe, and the Bridegroom upon another, each Horfe being fumptuoufly harnefs’d, with Bridles aud Saddles of Gold and Silver, if the perfons be rich: thofe that are poor, and have not Tories of their own, repair to the Great men, who willingly lend theirs upon fuchan occafion. As they fetout from the Virgins habitation, the Bridegroom goes before with a Veil of Carnation- Tiffany upon his Head, or elfe of Gold and Silver Net-work, the Mcfhes whereof are veryclofe, that reaches below the Stomach. ^Ie holds in his Hand one end of a Girdle fome three or four Ells long, and the Bride that rides behind holds the other. She is alfo cover’d with a large white Veil from head to foot, that fpreads alfo a good way over the Horfe. Under which Veil, that rather feems a large white Sheet, the Bride is hid in fuch a manner, that there is nothing to befeen of her but her Eyes. Two.Men walk on either fide of each Horfe &gt; and if they be Children of three or four years old ('for fo yotmg they marry) there are three or four Men to hold them in the Saddle, according to the quality of their Parents. A great Train ofyoung Men, the kindred and acquaintance of both parties, follow after, fome a horfe-back, fome a-foot, with Tapers in their hands, as if they were going in Proceffion; and befides all thefe, the Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys and other Inftm- mentsof the Country, all Attending to the Church-door. When they are alighted, everyone makes way for the Bridegroom and Bride, who advance up to the foot of the Altar, (fill holding the Girdle in their hands. Then the Bridegroom and the Bride meet, and lean forehead to forehead. Then comes the Pried, and turning his back to the Altar, lays his Bible upon their Heads, infiead of a Desk, a weight fuffi- ciently heavy, as being a thick ponderous Folio. There he lets it lye while he reads the form of Matrimony, which Office is mod ufually perform’d by a Bidiopor an Archbiffiop. The Form is very much like ours. The Bidiop demands the Bride groom, IFilt thou have fuch a one to thy Wife? then to the Bride he fays, Wilt thou hive fuch a one for thy Husband} to which they both anfwcr with a rlod of the Head. The Matrimonial Benediction being giv’n, they hear Mafs, which being ended, they return both together to the Daughters habitation, in the fame order as they fet out* Thefe Nuptials lad three days: where the Women drink more than the Men.TheMan goes to Bed fird, the Woman pulling off the man’s Breeches, though die does not lay afide her Veil ’till the Candle be put out. Let it be what time in the year it will, the Woman rifes before day. So that there be fome Armenians that in ten years after they are marry’d never faw their Wives faces, nor ever heard them fpeak. For though her Husband may fpeak to her, and all the red of her kindred, yet die never anfwers but with a Nod. The Women never eat with their Husbands , but if the Men fead their Friends to day, the Women fead theirs the next Day. ; C H A P. XIII. How the Armenians Bury their Dead. S O (bon as any perfon dyes, one appointed for the Services of the Dead runs immediately to the Church to fetch a Pot of Holy-Water, which he prefently pours into a great Veffel full of Water, into which they put the dead Corps. This man is call’d Mordichou^ or the perfon that wadies the Dead i which Mordichoits are fo much deteded among the people, that it is an rgnotiiiny to eat or drink with thofe fort of people. Whatever the party deceas’d has about him at the fime of his death belongs to therm though it be any excellent Jewel v for it is the euftom of the Ead to lye in their Breeches, Shirt, and WadcoaV, regard they - neveri 174 The P e r s i a n Travels Boot IV, nevei make ufe of Bed- cloaths.So foon, as ihcCorps is waih’d, they diefs it with ac ) e , white Shirt, a pair of Breeches, a WaPcost ard a Bonnet, all rew, reverhavV been worn before. Then they put the Body in a linnen Sack, and fow up the rml of it. That being done, the Prieftsccme and take up the Body to carry it to which is attended by all the kindred and friends of the deceas’d, with every one J Taper in his hand. Being come to Church, they fet down the Corps'before the Ab where the Pried lays certain Pra^essi and then (efong up lighted Tapcjs^^j about the Corps, they leave it fo all night. The next day in the morning a Bi^ qr an ordinary Pr;ed fays Mafs, at the end whereof they carry the Body before it I doer of the Bidiop’s houfe, attended as before at what time the Bifhop comes fort^ and fays a prayer for the Soul of the deceas’d. Then eight or ten of the pOorer fort ' that are next at hand, carry the Body to the Church-vard. All the way they (W ! certain Dirges, which the PrieftscontinuejWhi’e the Body islet down into the Grave, Then the Bilhop fakes three handfuls of Earth, and throws them ore after arotht i into the Grave, pronouncing fhefe words } From Earth thou cam% to Earthtlm fait | return^ and (lay there ’till our Lord comes. Thefe words being faid, they fill op th j Grave. Thofe of the kindred and friends'that will go back find a Collation ready; ] and if any other perfons will go along, they are not refus’d. For fieven days alfo j they allow Dinners and Suppers to certain Priefis and poor people, if they are per- Tons of ability: believing no Soul departed can be fav’d, unlefs the furvivors are at that expence. Whence it comes to pafs, tbit fo many of the poor people arefo miferable, and Slaves to the Mahometans, by borrowing Money to defray thofe I exper ces, which they are not able to pay again. When an Archbifhop or a Bifhop dyes, they add this farther Ceremony, that an Archbifhop or a Bifhop writes a little Note, and cuttingop’n the Sack puts the Note into the Hand of the deceas’d, wherein are theie words i Remember thy fdfctht from Earth thou cam’jl, and to Earth thou fait return. If a Slave dye before enfranchiz’d, when the Body is brought into the Churcli, the Mafter writes a Note, wherein are thefe words * 5 Ret him mt grieve, I mfyijni fee, and give him his liberty. For they believe that he would be reproach’d in tie other World for being a Slave, for which his Soul might fufier tribulation. If tie Mafter be dead, the Mifirefs does th,e fame. Ifan Armenian makes away himfelf,tiiey never carry the Body out of the door of the houfe, but make a hole in the wall, where they can moft conveniently,andcarry him to his Grave without any Ceremony, The night preceding the Feaft of the Holy Qrofi, Men, Women) and Children go to the Church-yard, whither they carry goodftoreof Food, not forgetting tkir Wire. Immediately they fall a weeping over the Graves of the dead, and after they have fpent feme time in that doleful Exercife, they all fall to eating and drink ing-, thus paffing the whole pight by turns, in blub’ring, eating, and bubbing. As for the poor people, they would think themfelves undone, and the mofl , unfortunate in the world, (hould they want Provifion and Wine to go to the Church* I yards, the night before the Feaft of St. George, where they go to frolick it, rather [ then to pray for the Dead. There may be fome few Armenians that embmceMabometanifm for worldlylntereh, but they are generally the moft obftinate perfons in the world, and moft firm tb their fuperftitsous Principles. chap. XIV. Examples of the Confflancy of \the Armenians, in maintdin 1 ^ their Religion againji the E executions of the Mahometans. T is the cuftom of the Armenians, that when any one of them apoftatizes, defires to return again to the Church, he cannot have Absolution but at the fame City or Village where he firft abjur’d his Religion. Now it happen’d that a young Armenian being lent to Smyrna with a very confiderable quantity of Goods, and falling to debauchery, turn’d MahottuW, ®Chap- XIV. of Monfieur Tavernier. i 7&lt;- the end he might defraud his Father and his Brethren of their Eftate, according to Halys Law, already mention’d. But after he had fpent good part of the Goods in Debauchery, he return’d to the Three Churches, where the Grand Patriarch liv’d, to be abfolv’d from his Fault * but the Patriarch telling him he muft go to the Bilhop of Smyrna, he went accordingly i and in fome few days after he had under gone the Penance enjoyn’d him, he went to the Cadi, and with a great Refolution, Sir, faid he, you know that fome years fmce I turnd Mahometan *, now I come to declare before ye that I have repented, and do repent of the foul Crime I committed, when I denyd the Saviour of the World, and embrac dyour vpich?d Law* The Cadi, who thought it had been at firft only fome evaporation of Extravagance, endeavour’d to reclaim him by fair words and promifes i but when he heard him perlift in his refolution, when he heard him curfe and blafpheme he caus’d him to be carry’d to the Tiazza, where he was cut to pieces immediately. For no perfons go with more courage and joy to fufifer for their Faith, then the Armenians. In the year 1651 there happen’d to be a Wedding between a young TWi^and a Virgin of the fame Nation. To this Wedding was invited an Armenian Lady, who was a great friend of the Bridegroom’s Mother.The Armenian an only Son of about twelve years of age, that earneftly defir’d to go along with her •, at firft (he refus’d him, knowing that after the age of five or fix years, no Youth is permitted to be in company with the Turhjfh Women or Maids. But the Boy ftill preffing his Mother, and being feconded by an Aunt, who to pleafe her Nephew, told her (he might let him go in Girls Apparelat laft the indulgent Mother, over*rul’d by the importunity xf the Child, took him along with her in a female &lt;Jrefs. Three days thefolemnity of the Turtyh Weddings laft ; but the very firtt day, an old Gipjy- Lurk cafting her Eye upon the young Armenian, and finding him too fparkifh and too nimble for a Girl, fufpe&amp;ed his Sex •, and calling his Mother afide, told her, that by all the geftures and actions of the Child, (he could be no Girl, but a Boy in dif- guife. The Mother not only deny’d the matter, but alfo feem’d highly offended at the old Womans fufpition * who as much incens’d to have her judgment que- ftion’d, decoy’d the Child among the Eunuchs of the Family, and caus’d him to be fearch’d y and finding herfelf in the right, fpred it prefently about the houfe. Im mediately the people cry’d that the Chambers were defil’d, that the AmenianL^ had done if in derifion of their Law y and feizing Mother, Aunt, and Youth, carry’d them ail before the Kafha, demanding Juftice. The Bafha difmifs’d the Mother and the Aunt, but kept the Youth fix or fev’n days, hoping the rage of the people would be over. But in vain he ftrove to plead for the Child, though the Father offer’d them half the weight of him in Gold, for the TSafha was forc’d to deliver him up into the hands of the marry’d Womans kindred ^ who carry’d the Child to the Market-place of the City, where they ftript him ftark naked y and firft they flea’d him from his Neck behind down to the Waft, and fo left him with a Guard upon him all night. The Cadi and Moullatfs exhorted the Child to turn Mahometan, and they would preferve him from further mifchief. His Mother beg’d him to have pity upon her and himfelf, and to turn Mahometan to fave his life. But neither tears, nor all the tender words that grief and affe&amp;ion could infpire, could (hake the con- ftancy of the Infant, who with a refolute utterance anfwer’d, that he had hitherto fuffer’d, and ftill would fuffer patiently y and that nothing griev’d him, but that his Mother (hould exhort him to deny his Saviour. Next day the pitilefs Turkf came and flea’d allhisBreaft and his Stomach, and fo left him all night under a Guard, intending to have flea’d him part by part every day. But the Bafha abhorring their Cruelty, came the next day with his Guards, and caus’d his Head to be cut off. • » ) • # s Van is a City peopl’d as well with Armenians as Turks ; fo that it is a ufual thing for the Armenian and Turhjfh Boys to play together. One day it unfortu nately fell out, that the Boys playing one among another, and flinging Stones at each other, an Armenian Boy hit a young Turh^ full upon the Temples, and ftrook him dead. Prefently the other Turkjfh Boys and the Rabble feiz’d him, and carry d him to the Bajha •, the Father and Mother of the Child flain follow’d with hideous out- crys, bawling for juftice, or that the Boy fhould turn Mahometan to expiate his fault.

There falling into difeourfe, by reafon oi the heat oft weather, he took off his Bonnet made after xht Armenian fafhion of divers Colo ^ and laid it behind him,keeping his black Cap only upon his head.When the mJu came about to haften the people to go away according to the cuftom, which 1 hav already declar’d, the Armenian haftily riling up, a Tur]^ concealing the Merchant Bonner, clap’d his own Bonnet upon his head. Upon that ah the Merchant 5 that were there came and congratulated the Armenian Merchant, telling him how glad they were to fee that he had embrac’d the good Law. At which words the Armenian takes off the Turbant, throws it to the Ground before all the Company, and ftamp’d it under foot. This a&amp;ion of contempt fo enrag’d the lum that they carry’d him before the B*/^,before whom it was in vain to juftifa hitnfdf or to affirm that theTurbant was malitioufly put upon his head i for theT^f^ore the contrary, and that he took it of his own accord, and therefore he mull either turn Tur^ or dye for it. Upon his refufal they put him in Prifon, and in a few dais the fentence was brought him from the and Cadi, that he muft either tumor be burnt alive. The feverity of the fentence overpowr’d him at hrft to embrace the Mahumetan Law. But four or five years after returning from the Indies to Cairo, he came where thc Bajha was fitting in Council with the Grandees of the Countryand getting as near the Mufti as he c could, and throwing his Turbant in his face-, Then Dog, faid he, Thou wert the caufe that 1 have worn it fo long, of which I have refen- ted, and do repent from the bottom of my heart fori know that neither thou nor tty Law are worth a Straw. At the fame time the croud laid hold of him, and drag’d him to the Piazza, where he dy’d in the midft of the flames with an admirable conftancy. A rich Merchant of Zulpha, call’d Cotgia Soultenon, was fo well belov’dby &lt;%. Sefi, .that he often wint to Dine at his houfe.

XV. Of the' Author’s reception at the Court of Persia in his firth and J laji Voyage., and what he did there during fiay at Hpahan. I Arriv’d at Ifltaban the 26 th ot December, 166 ^. So fbon as the Nazar was inform’d of my arrival, he fent the Kelotiter or chief of the Armenians with feven or eight more to congratulate my arrival, and to affure me of all the kind Offices he could do me. The next day he fent the fame Armenians with four Horfes \ and to tell me that the King had a defire to fee what 1 had brought for which purpofe the Kelonter had order to furnifh me with men. Thereupon I tookHorfe, accompany’d by all the Franks that were at Zulpha. When I came to Court,! was brought into the place where all the great Ambafiadours had audience, where 1 found attending the Nazar, and Father Raphael fuperior of the order of the Capuchins, ready to deliver me my Box of Jewels which I had left with him in the Govent for more fecurity. After I had expos’d my Goods upon a fair Table covet’d with a Carpet of Gold and Silver, and that the Nazar had difpos’d every thing in order with his own hand,the King enter’d,attended only by three Eunuchs for his Guard, and two old men, whofe office it was to puli off his Shoes when he goes into any Room fpread with Gold and Silk Carpets, and to put them on again when he goes forth. The King had nothing on but a fingle pair of Drawers of Taffata, chequer’d red and white, which came half way the Leg, his feet being bare* a (hort Caflbck that came but half way his body, with a large Cloak of Cloth of Gold with hanging-fleeves down to the Ground, furi’d with Sable Martin. The firft thing I ffiew’d was a large Candleftick of Chryfial of the Rock, the richeft piece of that nature that ever was feen. The next was a fuit of Tapeflry hangings held up by feveral men, as! had appointed. The Nazar then caus’d me to advance and do my obeyfance to the King, who prefently knowing my Face again * Oh, faid he to the Nazar, This ^ the Fringui Aga who fold me f&gt; many Rarities about fix years ago, Mahomet Beg Athemadoulet, After that the Nazar ffiew’d him all my Rarities as they lay in order. Among the reft l befbught His Majefty by Frier Raphael’, to accept of a great Steel Mirror, which when he look’d in, he wonder’d to fee his Face fo big. But when fhier Raphael had told him the nature ofit, he caus’d it to be held to one of his Eunuchs, which had a monftrous Hawk Note, the fight whereof held him in laughter and divertifement for above a quarter - of an hour. After that the King retir’d, leaving me alone with the Nazar and Friar Raphael, As for my Jewels I put them up my felf, and had a place allign’d me to Lock them up and keep the Key, but for my large pieces of Goldfmiths work, the Nazar committed them to the truft of one of the principal Officers of the Houle. The next day early in the morning the Nazar fent for me and Father Raphael, and made his Secretary write down the price of every thing, according to his de mands. He had alfo his own Artifts to prize them * but that I did not value, in regard I knew the price much better then they. Alter he had Ihew’d the Jewels* price and all to the King, we were feveral times before we could agree » but at length he told me, that the King would give me Twenty-five in the Hundred profit for all the Stones * leaving me the Pearls, which he thought I might put oij at a better price in the Indies *, which was an offer I could not refufe, and therefore I fign’d the Agreement according to the Nazar's defire : Which when his Ma/efty had feen, he bid the Nazar tell me I ffiould be his Jeweller in Ordinary, and that for my fake all the Franks ffiould be the better us’d within his Territories, and that 1 ffiould have any favour of him that I defil’d. I befought his Majefty to give me his Patent with his Seal affix’d, whereby I might be priviledg’d to Trade m his Dotflinions, without paying Cuftom for fuch and fuch Merchandize, and in fuch ipanner as 1 ffiould think fitting. I alfo befought him gracioufly to grant his Prbte&amp;ion to a Nephew of mine, whom I had left at Tauris to learn the Lan* guage, that he might be ferviceable to his Majefty when I was dead and gone. , A- ; Z&gt; There*7 8 The Persian Travels Book VI Thereupon he caus’d my Nephew to be enrol’dprcfently as one of his DciTr* Ser vants, and order’d the Nazar to take particular care of him. t The next day after my agreement with the Nazar, the King gave audhr- 1 the great Hall of the Palace to the AmbafTador of the Vsbick^ldriars. ^\\ IJ 1 lords and Officers of the Crown food in the Court where the AmbsiTador \y ^ pafs: there were alfo nine fately Horfes, whole Furniture was very rich spj t different.

There was another Nail of Gold behind, with a Cord ty’dtoit that held their hinder legs. They let alfo before every Hcrfe a Caldron of Gold* out of which they draw up Water into a great Manger j though all this be only fej State, for they never water their Hbrfes in that place. Out of the firft Court the Ambaffador enter’d into a large Gallery, bctwefii a long File of Mufqueteers on each fide. Thence he enter’d into a Garth through an Alky about eight Fathom broad* all pav’d with great Marble Stones in the middle of which runs a Channel of Water four Foot wide, withfeverj Water-works that fpurted out of the Channel at equal diftances. On each iideof the Walk to the Hall where the King fat, there is a Pond almoft as long astlie Walk, and in the middle of the Pond another for t of Water-works. Several 01 cers of the Army were rang’d all along the Alley '* and at the end of one of the Ponds were four Lions ty’d i and at the end of the other, three Tigers couch® upon Carpets of Silk, having Men to guard them with Half-pikes in their hands, The Hall took up more ground in length then in bredth 3 being op’n every ways the Cieling was fuftain’d by fixteen wooden Pillars, of eight pannels evety one, and of a prodigious thicknefs and height. As well the Cielingas the Pillars were all painted with Foliage-work in Gold and Azure, with certain other Colours mix'd therewith. In the middle of the Hall was a Vafe of excellent Marble, witha Fountain throwing out Water after (everal manners. The Floor was fpread witli Gold and Silk Carpets, made on purpofe for the Place : and near to the Vafe was alow Scaffold one Foot high, twelve Foot long, and eight wide, cover’d witli a magnificent Carpet. Upon this Scaffold fate the King upon a four-fquare Cuftiion of Cloth of Gold, with another Cufhion behind him cover’d with the fame, letup againft a great Tap’hry-Hanging, wrought with Terfian Chara&amp;ers, containing the Myfteries of the Law. On each fide of the King flood feveral Eunuchs will Mufquets in their hands. » The King commanded iht Athmadoukt and four others to fit down by him, and the AthmaduUt made me a fignto fit down* but the King knowing how little the Franks care for fitting crofs-leg’d, order’d me to he told that I might ftand upright, if I thought good. The King was clad ins Silk ftreak’d with Gold : His Cloak was a Gold-ground with Flower of Silkand Silver, Furr’d with a Martin Sable, the blackeft and moft glifl’ring that ever was feen. His Girdle was very rich, and upon his Bonnet he wore a Plume o( He rons Feathers faften’d with a tranfparent Jewel * in the middle of the Jewel was a Pear-fafhion’d Pearl, fet with great Topaze’s and Rubies. About half and hour after the King was fat, the Nazar and the Matter of tnt Ceremonies brought the Ambaffador, who neither himfelfnor any of his Train were very well clad, and caus’d him to flay at the foot of the fleps into the Hall from ® Garden. When the Ambaffador had afeended the fleps, he proftrated himlelfk' fore the King, then advancing nine or ten paces he did the fame again} after wnic the Maffor of the Ceremonies caus’d him to fit down, leaving between him anot e King fpace enough for eight men. After that I cjpferv’d that the Nazar went oP between the King and the Ambaffador, and between the AmbaffadourandtheW but I could not tell what they faid. So that I being by that time quite tyr’d, ma my obeyfance to the King, and w^nt home to my Lodging. , T he nexr day the Nazar fignffy’d to me that it was the King’s pleafurc to » v me with a ccmpleat Calaat, or Habit of Henouxv and to pay me my money*Chap, (f -Moafieur TAVERNrER. 170 Xhe next day h the Morning being fentTor to the'Court, I found the Nazar* the Grand Treafurer, and feveral other great,Officers expecting nie in the Trea- fury, where the Money lay ready in feal’d Bags.

You muft take notice, that the Verfians call a Calm any Prefent which one perfon makes to another inferior to him in dignity* fome^ times a Veft alone, foma:imes a Tunick with the Girdle only, fometimes a Tin. bant, or a Horfe, with Bridle and Saddle •, to thofe in the Army the King fends a Sword or a Dagger, and all thefe go by the name of Cafaais. Secondly, you mull take notice, that when the King fends a Calaat to a Governour of a Province, he - names himfelf the perfon, that is to carry it. For both in Tzdjze and fVrjw, the Receiver of the King's Prtfent is oblig’d to pay the Meffenger, in fo much that fometimes they hardly fcape for a thoufand Tomans. But when the Calaat is fentto any private pdfon, the Zfoj&amp;ar choofes out of his Domeftick Servants one to carry it. I gave twenty-five Tomans into Father Raphael's hand, who order’d his bufmefs with fo good a grace, and fo advantageoufly for my Purfe, that he complemented away the Meffenger very well fatisfi’d with half. The next day the Nazar fent to me to put on my Calaat, and to .come and do my obeyfanceto the King, who was that day to go abroad. Thereupon I fumtilon’d together all the Franks, and order’d the Trumpets and Drums to be made ready as I rode from the Palace home. For then the people come out to fee who the King has honour’d that day, who is always known by his Habit, which is fiill the newel and gayeft of all the reft. It happen’d, that the King being indifpos’d did not go away that day, however I apply’d my felf to the Nazar, and told him how much I was oblig’d tp the King for the honour he had done me, and that I was refolv’d to (hew my felf before the greateft Monarchs in Europe in the Habit he had beftow’d upon me, that they might behold the beauty and richnefs of my Calaat. The Nazar fail’d not to repeat my Compliment to his Majefty *, who thereupon order’d me the Ver[tan Cloak, with hanging-fleeyes, and fac’d with fable Martins. Two or three days after the Nazar fent for me again to Court, whither I went, accompany’d by the Zulpbian Frankj, as before. I was no fooner come to the Palace, but the Nazar met me in the great Hall, attended by two Officers, who carryd the Cloak which the King had appointed for me, and prefently taking the Cloak out of their hands, he put it about my ftiouldefs, faying thefe words, Itis tk King’s pleafure to honour thee entirely. It was a moft magnificent piece of Silk, and very richly furr’d, having been valu’d at eight hundred Crowns. In this I i particularly beholding to the NrfZtfr, who might have fent memy Cloak home to my Lodging as well astheC^tft‘,buthe was pleas’d to put it upon my back in the Palace with his own hands, to fpare me the charges of a'new Prefent. After this the took me by the hand, and led me to the Hall, where the King was fitting upon a January, 166'y. largeChap.

By that time I had advanc’d two or three paces in the Hall, the Nazar order’d me to fall upon my knees, and touch the Ground with my forehead *, then taking me by the hand, he led me within two or three paces of the place where the King was fitting, where I was order’d to make the fame obeifance as before *, after that he caus’d me to retire feven or eight paces, and there to hand. And then it was that His Majefty was pleas’d to tell me, that he had contriv’d the Models of feveral pieces, which he would have made in Frances and ask’d me whether I would carry them along with me, or whether I would prefently fend them into France to be made up while I difpatch’d my bufinefs in the Indies? I told His Majefty, that fo foon as he would be pleas’d to deliver them to me, I would fend them for France. After this and fome other difeourfe I made my obei- fance, and retir’d toward the door of the Hall. Having thus done my duty to the King, I went and kifs’d the Nazars hand s and then taking Horfe at the Palace-* Gate, with the reft of the Franks that accompany’d me, we rode home with the Trumpets and Drums of the Country belbre us. When we came to Zulpba with our Torches before us, for it was three hours after Sun-fet, the Men and old Women came out of their Houfes to fee us pafs along, and feverall prefented us with Fruits, Sweet-meats* and Wine, obliging us to drink almoii at every Houle ’till we got home. ^ C H A P.

A Bout two days after betimes in the Morning ! was fent for to the Court in that haft, that I had fcarce time to make me ready. When l came to Court, I found the Father Rapbel, and two Hollanders whom the Nazar had began to caft a particular eye of favour all together. After we had ftay’d a while, the Nazar brought us to the Room where the King was, fitting upon a low Pallet, with two Mattreffes cover’d with a rich Carpet. He lean’d his back againft a large Cuftuon four foot long, having before him eight or ten Plates of Fruits and Sweet-meats. Before him alio flood two Bottles, with long round necks of Venice Cryftal Hop’d with Pitch, full of Schim Wine, with a Cup of pure Gold upon one fide a kind of a very fmall Fat and with a handle, within three or four Fingers full of the fame Wine, with a Gold Ladle that held a good Chopine of Pam. The Bottles were for the King’s drinking * that in the Fat for thole that the King did the Honour to drink with him. After we came in and had made our feveral obeyfancesj faid the King to Father Raphael^ Raphael, hia, bia&gt; that is, come hither, come hither, who thereupon rifing, and falling upon his knees when he came near the King -, Raphael, continu’d the King, if thou wilt drinks Wine, (fay here, if hot, he gone. The Fryar unaccuftom’d to drink Wine, reply’d that fince His Majefty did him fo great an Honour, he was willing to drink a little. ’2ix very well, anfwe r’d the King fmiling, go then and tahg thy feat. Thereupon the King commanded one of the Dutchmen to fill Tome Wine, which He did, but with a trembling hand Heav’n, knows, as never having been at fuch a Feftival before. And I obferv’d that having laid his Hat upon the Carpet, the King commanded him to put it on, it being a very ignominious thing in Perfia to be bare-headed. Thus the great Ladle went about very fmartly, confidering it was but early in the Forenoon: But at length the King bethinking himfelfthat the Franks v^ere notufed to drink without eating, gave fuch order, that immediately they fpread before us a Sofra of Cloth of Gold inftad of a Table-Cloth &gt; and over that a Leather Covering of the fame length and breadth, and over that a fort of Bread as long as the Sofra 9 for had the Sofra been ten Ells long, the Bread muft have been as long. This Bread is no thicker then a piece of Paper, and folds like a Napkin. It is made with a Rolling-KoUine-pin, and bak’d upon Plates t ri .nn 4 Copper. This Br«d i s W v u but onfy ferves for a Table-Cloth to prefexve what falls from the Diflics, any every man leaves particularly upon his own Plate,wmcn is all wup d up m iht ^ ther and aiv’n to the poor. Next to that they fet upon one end.of the ifoit of moft excellent Bread two foot long and one broad, then which neve, Wasb{t|t[ eat’n in the World. By and by follow’d Boyl d and R 02 ft fielh and filh, wid, tWo Chefts of Limons of Nhzandran, and Granates from SchirM, After we had made a large Breakfait, the King was pleas’d to put meuponadif. courfe of my Travels into the Indies, and ask d me what Pisnas i lud hadaccefsto and how many I knew by their faces? Then caufing a Satchel to be brought him be open’d it himfelf, and (bew’d me fevenjl portraitures in Miniature. Prcfe^’ knew Sha-Gehan, Aurtnge-Zebe, and three of his Sonsthe King of GohrJ, JI: j Vifabour, Sba- Eft-Kan ,and two R*/Tz.Among the rell he (hew d me a PerfunUift Pidture and gave it me , to the end, faidhe, that your Ftok/i Ladies may fa bow our Pcr/ww Ladies are clad. After that he (hew d me the Pictures of two Ventim, CurtifansJ the one a Widow, and the other a Virgin, with a Parrot upon h§r hand clad after the French mode. Upon which the King putting the queltionjo me which Hik’d heft ? I reply’d that (he pleas’d me bed who had the Parrot uponher fid. And why not the other, faid the King? Becaufe, anfwa d I, (he looks like one: that had renounc’d the world. T hereupon the King falling into a laughter, ani turning toward Father Raphael ■&gt; Patri, Patri, faid he, h it poffible that [mb a Laly as this Jbould have renounc'd the IVor-ld ? This led us into a difcouife ofbeauig wherein when the King demanded my opinion, I told him that Womens beautj depended very much upon theGudom of the Country j for that \u Japan Women with broad faces were mod in requed s in China fmall feet were admir in the libs of Borneo and lichen. Women the blacker tneir Teeth were, the more they were belov’d 5 that in the Idand of Macafer, to make their Women lovely, they poll out four of their Teeth when they are young, to put in four of Gold in their room * as 1 have feen a Captain of Java, who pull’d out four of his fore Teeth,;, and fet four Diamonds in their place. In (hort, I told his Majedy that in his own Dominions full Eye-brows which meet together were highly edeem’d y whereas the Women of France pull them up by the Roots. But which, faid t he King, dofiihou like bed, the blacker the fair ? Sir, continu’d I, were I to buy Womenas( purchafe Diamonds, Pearls, and Bread, I would always choofe the whited. With that the King fell alaughing, and order’d me a brimmer in his own Cup, which was a great Honour indeed. From hence we fell into a more ferious difcourfecon- cerning the prefent Stato of Europe, fpeakingwery low, and the red of the Com pany retiring all the while out of hearing. Only I ob(erv’d that there was one Lord middle ag’d, and clad afterthe Georgian vnode, who dood within five or hx paces behind the King, and that many times as the King drank, he only we^ his Lips, and gave the red to that Lord to drink, which v v hen he had done, he retii’d again to his place. Upon inquiry I found he was the King’s Uncle by the Mothers fide. While we were talking of ferious things the Curtifans were bid to retire out ot the Hall, which they did, into a Gallery that look’d upon a Garden, where they fate, where immediately a Sofra was laid before them cover’d with Fruits and Sweet meats, and one of their Society continually powr’d out the Wine which they drank round without intermiftion: One would have thought they (hould have beenfuddl Qi yet when theyqame in again, no man could perceive they had been drinking. After they had Danc’d a while, they were order’d to retire again, and the King fentfor his Mulick, which was both Vocal and Infirumental i his Inhrumental Mufick confided of a kind of a Lute, a Guittar, a Spinet, and two or three Bale Flutes.

But I reply’d, that were I to choofi; again, I would make the fame choice, be lieving prudence to accompany age. However I befought his Majefly to confider that it was not for tneto look upon elder ot younger, and that though he had’ giv’n me the liberty to fend the elder home to rriy Lodging, yet it was not in my pow’r to accept of his favour, in regard I had a Wife, to whom I never had been unfaithful. We had thus droll’d together ’till eleven a Clock at night,' when the King ftarted another Queftion, Whether any one preffnt knew how to Sing &gt; It hap pen’d that there was one Monfieur IWw there, that Play’d upon the Virginals, and pretended to Sing, ( who immediately began a Court-Air. But his Voice being 3 high-pitch’d Voice, and for that the Perfians are altogether for Bafes, the King did not like him. When I ^perceiv’d that, being in a merry vein, though I knew not a Note, yet having a good deep voice, and clear, I fung an old Air that came into my heatj, which begins, Fill all the Bowls then^ fill 'em highj Fill all the Glajfes there, for why Should every Creature drink^hut 1 ? The King was fo pleas’d, that he cry’d .out, Baricala, Baricala, as much as to fay, Oh the works of God! an expreflion of admiration ufual among the Per fians. , By this time it was very late, and the King growing fleepy, gave us leave to de part j which we did very willingly, having had hard labour for feventeen hours together. - * N The next night the King fell a drinking again, and there was in his prefence an Agi or Pilgrim newly return’d from Mecca, and confequently oblig’d never to drink Wine after that. While the ftaid, there was one of the Perfian Lords got fo impertinently fuddl’d, that he twke ftruek the Agi's Turbant from his head, refus’d to drink when the King commanded him, play’d the fool with the Curti- fans when they were dancing, and committed fo many other adfs of folly, that the King incens’d at fuch a continuation ofBuflfonry, in a great fury, FbUKafcal, faid he, bM loft all hti reftett, and thinks he U no more my Slave \ drag him out hy the feet, and throw him to the Dogs to eat. Immediately four or five of the King’s Officers came and drag’d him out of the Hall by the feet, and every body wonder’d he was not thrown to the pogs, according to the King’s Command s. but ’tis thought that fome of the King’s Woman beg’d for him, fo that his punifhment was chang’d, There was one of the Curtifans that gave one of her Companions a box on the car, not in the King’s prefence, but in the Gallery where they were drinking together. However fhe did not ftrike fo foftly, but that the King heard thenoife of the blow. Whereupon he commanded her that had giv’n the blow to be had before the Deroga or Judge of the Town, whom he order’d to expunge her out of the number of Curtifans, and to put another in her places that (he fhould have a hundred Fomans giv’n her, and that the Deroga fhould caufe her to be marry’d. The next day I waited on the King, and receiv’d thofe Models which he had befpoke me to fend into France.

He gave great honour to Tamerlane, and {hew’d Eminent kindnefles to all the Officers of his Ar- my ^ in recompenfe whereof, Tamerlane^ who was a generous Prince, and full of gratitude, made a Prefent to the Che'\ of a great number of Captives, which he brought along with him out of Twr^v. The Cheik planted one part of thefe Slaves about Ardevile, and feated the 6ther near his own refidence. Now in regard he affum’d to himfelf to be defeended in a diredi line from Maho met, he cover’d his head after another manner then all the reft of the Perfianf, wearing a kind of flat Bonnet, growing broader and Broader to the top, and fo pleighted, as to make twelve pleights of a Ruff, in honour of the twelve Pro phets. In the middle, a kind of a Pyramid about a fingers length feem’d to rife out of the Bonnet, but was indeed fow’d to it. Such a Bonnet as this the Che\ appointed all the Slaves to wear that Tamerlane had giv’n him, and this is that which at this day diftinguifhes their Succeffors from the other Perfians. And it is the cuftom, where or Governours of Provinces refide, that all the Sophie* both in the City and the neighbouring parts, meet in the Piazza every Friday in the afternoon, where they pray to God for the health of the King and the Kan, and for the profperity of the Kingdom '■&gt; after which the Kan fends A a them9&lt;5 The Persian Travels Book V them Visuals to eat, not without feme other effects of his Liberality!

To Ifinael Sophi fucceeded Sba-Tammas his Son, and to Sba-Tammas Sha-Ifwad thefecord, who reign’d but a fhort while •, for his ciuelties conftrain’d the Nobility of the Country to fet up in his room Mahomet-Coda, betide his Brother-, tboupli little skill’d in the affairs of Government or War, Many thought he was blind but he was only dim-lighted, through the application of a hot Iron to his eyes, by theCommar d of his unnatural Brother in the beginning of bis reign. He was thl Father of Sba-Abbas, that fucceeded him, who ietPd the affairs of Perfia in a veiy good condition. x x - Sba-Abbas thefirft, by his Valour and good Condud gain’d the name of Great, When he came to his Throne, upon the North and Weft ftde he found nothing in his power but the City cf Casbin but afterwards, as he was a perfonage of great wit as well as courage, partly by policy, and partly by force, he recover’d feveral Provinces to the Weft, and conquer’d the Kingdoms of Lar, Omus, and Can- dabar. Of many Sons that Sba-Abbas had, not one furviv’d but only Sophi-Mirza, a Prince, of great wit, and dextrous at his Arms. All the people lov’d him, which made his Father jealous of him, that he waited for his death to afeend the Throne, And that which augmented his jealoufie was, for that one day being a hunting, Sopbi-Mirza drew the firft: arrow at a Boar i it being a capital crime in ?erfu to fhoot before the King,. However Sba-Abbas for the time conceal’d his difplea- fure, unwilling to fly out in fury againft the Prince, in regard he had no more Son?. But having had a Son by a Slave, which pleas’d him, $lw- Abbas's joy encreafing as the Child grew, his jealoufie alfo daily encreas’l againft the Father of the young Prince , fo that being no longer able to diffemble his fear, he caus’d his eyes to be put out. Nay his jealoufie went a great way farther '■&gt; for he now fear’d the blind Prince, and having therefore refolv’d his death, he commanded a Lord of the Court to bring him his head. The Lord in an aftonifhment refus’d to obey the King, and befought him rather to take away his life? than to ccnftrain him to embrue his hands in the blood of his Prince, The King offended at him for his refufal, banifh’d' him his Court? and the next day gave the fame command to another Lord, who without any fcruple put it in execution, and brought him the head of his Sonin a Bafon of Gold. Thatobjed of pity brought him to himfelf ? fo that not being able to look upon fo fad a fpecffacle without tears in his eyes? upbraiding the villany of the Lord? he ex* pell’d him from his fight,! forbad him his prefence for ever, and fequefierd all his eftate, only allowing him a Mamoudi, or nine French Sous aday. The other Lord, who had fo generoufly refus’d to aid him in fo bloody an 3&lt;ff, the King recall’d from Exile, and beftow’d upon him one of the bett Governments of the Empire. Ever fince that time all the Male Children of the Blood Royal are (hut up in the Womens Haram, where they are bred up in ignorance, having only two or three Eunuchs to teach them to write and read, and to keep them company in their recreations, whether it be in fhooting with a Bow, or riding about the Gardens upon an Afs? for they never allow ’em a Horfe: befides thatall thattiiue they are never permitted to fee the people. In this manner it was that Sw- bred up his little Grandfon, many days caufirg him to take Opium to render him more ftupid. So that when he came to the Throne, after his Gumd- fathers death, the Phyficians thought it convenient that he fhculd drink wine, to reftore his natural heat, and renew his vigor. Sba-Abbas reign’d forty ;rCtoL &lt;?/Monfieur Tavernier. , 1^7 anddy’d at the end of the year 1628. Before he dy’d, he gave command, that he ftjould be bury’d in fome place unknown to all the world, and that they (hould fet his Grand-child upon his Throne, and give him the name of Sba~ % foen as Sha-Abbas's eyes were clos'd, the General of the Horfe, and the chief Captain of the Harquebufles, with whom the Commands were left, rode in all hade to Ifpahan^ and coming to the Palace, defied to fpeak with the Mo ther of the Child. The Mother was in a fad affright, believing that they came to put the young Prince to death. But when they had diflipated her fears, and that (he underftood that they came (o fet him upon the Throne by the command of his Grand-father, (he embrac’d the young Prince, and return’d him into the hands of the Eunuchs. When he was come out of the Haram, the two Lords, attended by feveral others, faluted him King, and acknowledg’d him for their Soveraign. At the fame time they took off his Cloaths and tore them, which in Perfia is a mark of mournings and according to cuftom, put him on- another plain Garment, which he wore till midnight. Then they difrob’d him again, and put him on his Royal Robes, and fet him upon the Throne, where all the Lords came and did him homage, and the next day he was acknowledg’d by all the Acclamations of the People. For when the Royal Habit is put upon the new King, the Drums, Trumpets, Timbals, Hautboys, and other Inftru- ments, make a din in a peculiar place of the Meydan appointed for that purpofe. Which is the Signal to give notice to the people to meet the next morning, to acknowledg the new King. Sba-Sefi for many years was a Novice in the art of Government. But time opening his eyes the firft remarkable thing which he did, being at Casbin, was to cut off the head of Ali-Kouli-Kan, that great Captain who had conquer’d the Kingdoms of Lar and Orntus for Sha-Abbas i ind the heads of three of his Sons. After that, returning to Iftaban, he cut off the heads of feven of the principal Lords of his Court j arid by little and little took the Government into his own hands. Of thofe Lords whom Jani Kan was the chief. For’tis thought that Sha Abbas had left a private order with Mbrza Takf r and the Dowager Sa/tatfe/} to rid themfelves of thofe Lords fo foon as Sba- Sefi (hould be fet I’d in his Throne, and that they had plac’d Governors in all places wherein the King might confide. Thefc Lords having fmoak’d the private order of Sba-Abbas, and believing that the time of execution drew near, prevented the Athemadoulet Mirza Take* for meeting one morning before the Palace-door, they kill’d the Porter, and entiing his Bed-Chamber, ftab’d him before: he could rife. After this execution, they went to the King, whom Jam-Kan boldly told, that they had ilain Mirza Take. The King at that time diffembling his anger at fo bold an enterprize,, and an attempt upon the Royal Authority, anfwer’d him, that he had done very well, and that he had prevented thofe orders which he intended to have giv’n him. The Suhanefs his Mother then govern’d the King dom, together with the Athemadoulet, from whom (he receiv’d four hundred Ducats in Gold every day for her little pleafures *, and held a private Coun cil with him in her Haram, where he had free admiffion, as being cut clofe. In this Council it was, that thefe two perfons overthrew in the night whatever the Lords concluded in the day } chang’d the Kings mind, and over-ruPd his thoughts as they pleas’d themfelves, by vertue of .that power which they had over him. Eight or nine days after, as thefe Lords were fitting in Council with the King, an Eunuch enter’d, which was the fignal for the King to get out of the way, and as foon as the King was gone, the Chamber was fill’d with Eunuchs, that ru(hing in immediately fell upon Jani-Kan and his Accomplices^ and cut off their heads. Their heads and bodies were immediately expos’d tri the view of the people in the Meydan \ and for that it is not the cuftom in Perfia to take any cognisance of what the King does, the moft part of the people fpurning the heads with their feet, cry’d one to another, See the beads of thofe Dogs that have difobey'd the mil of the King, a I told ye, that Mirza Takf was clean cut* which occafions a particular (lory ; He was Governour of Guilan in the Reign of Sha-Abbas, and having abus’d one of his Pages, the young Lad Hole fecretly to Ifpahan 9 and made his com-* A a 2 plaintThe Persian Travels Beck V, plaint to the Kirgi who having heard it, iirn ediatcly lent him to be Go- vernour of Gmlati, in the place of Nhrza 7^ 5 2rd Older d him to fend him his head by one of the Officers, which he difpatch d along with him. 7} le King alfo, in regard the Page was very young, appointed him a perfon able to advife him in his affairs. In the mean while Miria Jake miffing his Page, and making no queftion but ho was gone to make his con plaint to the King’ which would of neccffity prove his ruin, if not prevented i he refclv d to di vert the florm by punifhing himfelf, and caus’d that part to be cut clean off that committed the crime. At the fame time, and in that bad condition where- in he then was, he caus’d himfclfto be put into a Litter, and taking his Chi- rurgeon along with him, he gets to Jfpaban by another way which was not ufually travell’d, for fear of meeting the Page, and caufing himfelf to be car. ry 9 d into the Palace in that pitiful and langnifhing effate, dctir’d to fpeak with the King, who was furpriz’d at his arrival. But the Kan having prefented him in a plate of Gold with the undoubted marks of his repentance, befought his Majeflies pardon. Whereupon the King confidering the rigor and extraor dinary punifhment which he had infli&amp;ed uponhimfelf, fent him back to his Govern- rnent, and recall’d the Page, whom he otherways gratih’d. And this was the man whomupon his Death-bed order’d that Sha-Sefi fbould make Atbmadoukt^ as being the fitted for the employment of any perfon in his Kingdom. Sha-Sefi not content to have rid himfelf of the Lords that had prefum’d to invade his Authority, was refolv’d to have the head of Ali-merdan- Kan, Go- vernour of Candahar j of whom he was jealous, by reafon of his vafi riches, his Plate being all Gold, and his Houfe as magnificently fainifh’d as the Kings, hut the King could not bring about his defign v for the Kan being prefs’t to come to Court, and believing it was only to take away his head, to free himfelf from the danger, deliver’d Candahar to the Great Afogw/, by whem he was kindly entertain’d, and highly catefs’d. Neither was Ali-tnerdan-Kan's wealth of his own getting* but left him by iOheritimce, as being defeended from the ancient Kings of Candahar, who were originally Tartars. Now whatever favours or ad« vancement the Great Mogul bedow’d upon Alimerdan-Kan, the fame did the Terjian King bedow upon his two Sons: whereas all the world belitv’d, that after fuch a piece of Treafon committed by their Father, the King would have ript up their bellies. This piece of policy of Sha-Sefi was very advantageous to Sha-Abbas the fecond, when he befieg’d Candahar with fifty thoufand men. For the greated part of the Mogul's Army being con pos’d of Terfiam, they remembring how kindly Sha-Sefi had us’d the two Sons of Ali-mrdan-Kan, made little refidance againft the King of Pef/k*, who enter’d Candahar in a (mail time. The Great Mogul troubl’d at the lofs, ask’d Ali~merdan-Kan, by what means he might retake Candahar , who prefently made anfwer, that it would be very eadc, if he could find fuch another Traytor as he had been. But to return to Sha-Sefi j his Reign was very violent, of which 1 will give you this Example: One day the King returning from the Kelonters Houfe in Zulpha^ having drank to excefs, commanded that the ftiould come to him*-who nn* derdanding that he was in drkik, made no great hade, fo that the King in the mean time fell afleep. But waking again foon after, and not feeing the Queen, hecall’d for her a fecond time * of which when (he had notice, die came im mediately: When (he came into the Chamber, (he perceiv’d the King aileep, and in expedition of his waking, hid her felf in a Nick behind the Hangings* where generally the Mattreffies and Coverlets are laid by. The King waking, and not yet perceiving the Sultanefs, in a great chafe demanded why (lie was not yet come. The Queen-Mother) who was a Georgian Slave, and mortally hated the young Sultanefs y who was the Daughter of the King of Georgia, and therefore difdain d by her, took an occafion to put her cut of the Kings fa vour* and having fird fpoken ill of her, made a fign to the King to let him underdand that the young Queen was hid in fuch a Nich, Upon that the King rrfing in a great fury, dab’d the poor Princefs with his Dagger four o? five, times Jn the belly, and hardly knowing what he had dene, went to bed again. Ikeall forts of Silk Stuffs to the very Palace i and the King cf Vtrfia went him- felf to meet him, as far as where the Stuffs were begun to be laid, though Sha-Abbas was very yobng, yet he was refolv’d to (hew, that he look’d upon himfelfas a potent King in the peaceable poffeffion of his own Dominions, and that he went to meet a dethron’d Prince, that came to defire his Aid. For fo foon as he perceiv’d the King of the Tartars, he made a (hew of fpurrirg on his Horfe&gt; and being come up to his Borfes head, he put his foot out ofthe Stur. fup as if he intended to have alighted, but did not. The Tartarian Prince, as old as he was, prefently leap’t to the ground from his Saddle to falute the Terfm King, who return’d him fome flight Compliments about his having alighted i at which time the Athmadouht and other Lords remounting him, the two Kings rode together upon the Silks, the King of Perff* giving the left hand to the Tartar. The King of ?«•/?&lt;* very generoufly lent him a confiderable affiftance of 15000 Horfe, and 8000 Foot, and' fixty thoufand Tomans in Money. The Tartar in Exchange gave him one of his Provinces bordering upon Perfia, which ycilded him a very good Revenue, in regard the Inhabitants were all Shepherds, or Tw- eomans, that breed an infinite number of Cattel, wherein the wealth of that Pro* vince confifts. While he reign’d, he had a Prefent made him from the Governour oi Scbiras, of a wild Afs, whofe Skin was as red as Scarlet, having a Horn growing out of his forehead about a foot long. 'Sha-Abbas reign’d about twenty-four years, and dy’d at Tebzon, of an in flammation in his throat, which came by exceffive drinking- His body by his own order was buri’d at Kour. So foon as he was dead, the Lords that were about him, fent advice of his death to the Prince that now reigns, by the To- pigi B?(ha, who is General of the Mufqueteers, and Mirza Bayad the Chief of the Attrologers. So foon as they came to the door of the Haram, they de fied tofpeak with the Mother and the Son* who believ’d them come upon feme difmal defign. But they prefently confirm’d them to the contrary. For as foon as the Prince came forth of the Haram, they fell at his feet, and faluied him King, declaring the death of his Father. Whereupon the Prince imme diately tore his Garment according to the cuftom. And indeed they have another cuftom, that as foon as the new Prince comes after much entreaty out of the Haram, he throws himfelf to the ground, at the door of the Haram, and then riling and fitting upon his heels, one of the Lords that are fent, girds the Scimiter about his wafie, faying thefe words, May it pleafe your Majefty to remember your Slave, that had the Honour to gird you with this Scimiter, Which done, he goes and fets the Trumpets a founding, aneLiheDrums beating, whereupon all the people in the morning come running to the Gate of the Palace, crying out, Patjha Salamakk^, I falute thee Emperour. Which is all the Ceremony us’d when any King of Per/w afeends the Throne. For I never faw any Crown fet upon the head either of Sba- Abbas otSba-Sefi. 'Only in Perfia they gird on the Scimiter, as in Turkey they put on the Bonnet of the Sopbis, which is very richly fet with Jewels, but has not the lead refemblanceof aCrown. The fame Ceremony of girding on the Scimiter, is us’d to the Mogul, the Kings oiVifapour and Golconda \ and they alfo put the Bon net upon their heads, which is fet with the richeft Jewels in the poffeffion of thofe great Monarchs. Sha Seji the fecond, fome time after his coming to the Throne, fell dange- roufly fick, not having ever enjoy’d a perfed health before. Now it is the cuftom in thofe Countries, that upon fuch an occafion all the Lords of the Court, and Governors of Provinces, give a fum of money, according to their willingnefs and liberafity. This fum is ufually in Gold, which they put into a Bafon very richly (et with precious Stones, and bear it three times over the King’s head, pro nouncing thefe words, Patjha Bajhena Olfon, This money is facrificdfor the health of the Kings head. If the King recover all that money is giv’n to the poor, to which the King and his Haram add very liberally. But if the King dies, the money is put into the Treafury, and the poor have nothing. The twentieth of Auguft 1667, was the critical day of his diftemper, and every one thought he would have dy’d. Ifpon which all the Grandees of the Court feeing him in that condition, went to the Mofquee call’d Babaron, which is without the City, to '' ' ' mI tlilfl. lOygh upon . and ufocn m bis -Stur, ce,as te k ;iitedi Kings irUt, 5000 farttr :ilded hr.

Whereupon as ( well the Ecclelklticks as the Laity went to their prayers upon the fide of the River which is between Ifyahan and Zulpba.' They alfofent their Kelonter^ with fifty Tomans in Gold, to bear over the Kings head j though the Armenians pronounce not the fame words as the Perftani^ faying only, Berai te Sadduk, deft it? d for Alms. Thus the danger being over in a few days, they made it their bufinefs to re cover him to a perfed habit of healths but in regard the King continu’d in a languifhsng condition, and for that the Phyficians could not difeover the caufe r of the diflemper, the King began to believe that it proceeded from the igno rance of the Phyficians, for which reafon feme of them had receiv’d none of the beft entertainment already. At length it came into the thoughts of fome others of the Phyficians, who were afraid for themfelves, that in regard Perfu was thus doubly afflided, with Famine and Sicknefs of the King, both at one time, it muft of necefhty be the Aftrologers fault, that mifs’d the favourable hour when the King 1 (hould have afeended the Throne. Thus being troubl’d at their difgrace, pretending to have no lefs skill in future knowledg than the Aftrologers, who' , had not chos’n a true time for the King to afeend the Throne, they concluded that for the perfed recovery of his health, and thereftoring of plenty to the Nation, it was neceffary to renew the Ceremony at a lucky hour, and to change his name. This propofition pleas’d the King and his Council. The Phyfitians and Aftro- Togers joining together, obferv’d the firft unlucky day, which would certainly be follow’d by another that would prove fortunate.. Now there being among the Gaures^ fome that pretend themfelves defeended from theRuftans, who were ancient Kings ofPerfia and Parthia y that very morning one of thofe Games fetting himfdfupon the Throne, with his back againft a wooden Figure which reprefent- ed him to the life, all the Grandees of the Court came and did him homage as their King, as he had order’d them to do. This action lafted till the favourable ( hour was come, which happen’d a little before Sun-fet. Then it was that an Officer of the Court came behind and cut off the head of the wooden Figure, while the Game immediately took his heels and fled. Presently upon that the King ap pear’d in the Hall, upon whofe head when they had put the Bonnet of Sofhi y and re girt him with the Scimitar, he afeended the Throne, and took the name r of S oilman. He was forc’d to adf this Comedy to fatisfie the Law, which contriv’d that he fhould change his Name, and take a new pofTeffion of his Throne, by eje&amp;ing a Ufurper that had wrongfully darn’d ft. For which reafon I f he GWe was fet up as Pretender, as laying claim to the ancient Lineage of the- Berftan Kings, and being of a different Religion. From that time the King reco- vering, and the Famine decreafing, the Phyficians were in great repute, and Aftrologers were caft out of favour, except two or three of the moft skil ful. Sha-Soilman before his coming to the Crown, had convers’d with none but | and black Eunuchs i from whom he could not learn the art of Ruling.

From fuch devou ring Pefls and Vipers as thefe, Sha-Abbas thought it but reafonable to preferve his people i fo that before thefe Vermin crept into Pafia^ the Money was all in the hands of the Armenians of Zu J pha, And indeed thofe Banians have been the ruin of many poor peopkj of which I will only bring one example among many. 1 was at Ijfahan in the yeaf 1662^ when one of thofe lent fix or feven Tomans per Cent, a month to a poor Perfian, who had utter’d feveral pieces of Linnenupon the place. Thofe Banians will have their Intereft paid every month -, but the Perfian had flipt three or four, having no Money to pay, in regard his Debtor cotild not pay him. Thereupon the Banian dunn’d him perpetually, and threaten’d to have him drub’d till he pay’d it, according to the Perfm cuftom. The Mother of the Perfian troubl’d to fee her Son haunted in that manner, one morning as he was going to the Meydan, bid him, if he met the, Banian, that he (hould befure to bring him home, and (he would pay him his Intereft, and fome of the principal, with fome Money that (he had fav’d of her one. Toward even ing the Banian met his Debtor, whom he readily follow’d home upon promife of payment. The Mother defir’d him to fet upon the Caurfi, which is the place where they make their fires, it being cold fnowy weather, and fe$ fruits before him to eat. While he thus eat and warm’d himfelf, night came on apace, and the woman putting him in hopes of payment, fpun out the time fo long,’that the Banian not beipg unaccuftom’d to cold weather and late hours, was eafily perfwad- ed to (lay all night at the Perfians Houfe. When ’twas time to go to Bed, theB*- nian threw himfelf upon one Quilt, and the Perfian upon another. About two houres after midnight, the Mother comes foftly into the Chamber, with a (harp Razor in her hand, intendingto have cut off thb Banians head f but unfortunately miftaking, kill d her own Soninflead of the Banian. The Banian having had fuch an efcape, Itole cunningly out of the Houfe, and declaring the murther to the Vivari-beque, or the Chief Juft ice, He caus’d the woman to be apprehended, and brought before him i who confefling the fadf, he commanded her to be ty’d to the tail of a young Mule, and tobedragg’d about the City till the Mule had kick’d her to death.

J The King having bought his Bargains return’d to Court, where he caus’d the Atbemadoulet to Weigh both the Brea 4 and the Meat exadly* He found the Bread to want fifty*feven Drams, and the Meat forty-three.

When none of them daring to open their mouths, while he was in that paftion, he commanded a great Oven to be made in the Piazza, together with a Spit long enough to roaft a man j and that the Oven (hould be heated all Night, and that they fhould make another fire to be kindl’d hard by the Oven.

Of what fell out mofi memorable in the Reign of Sha-Sefi the fir(l ; and particularly of the death o/Iman-KouH-Kan, andhh three Sons. I Man-Kouli-Kan was the lad Kan of Sc&amp;mz/, whofe Government extended over the Province of L*r, to the Golf of Petfia, under the Reign of Sba- Abbas thefe being the moft potent in all Per/?*, Iman-Kouli-Kan vns he who in the Reign of Sba-Abbas conquer’d the greateft part of the Kingdom of Lar, and the Kingdom ot Ormufj with all the Coaft of the Perftan Golf, from Cape Jajques to Balfara, . ' 1 This Iman-Kouli-Kan was prodigioufly rich, belov’d and ^efpeded by all the world i befides he was wonderfully magnificent, his expeqfes almoft equalling the Kings? which occaiion’d wh^jjifeours’d with him one day parti cularly upon that Subjedf, to tell him, that he defir’d him to fpend every day one Mamoudy lefs than he, that there might be fome difference between the expences of a King and a Kan. , The noble qualities of this Iman-Kouli-Kan had gain’d the affe&amp;ions of the people? for he was magnificent and liberah highly recompenc’d brave Soldiers and Students ? he lov’d Strangers, and had a particular' care to cherilh Arts and Sciences. To which purpofe he built a fair Colledg at Scbiras^ for the inftiudfion of Youth? and feveral Inns, as well in the City as upon the Roads ? for the Tra vellers. He caus’d Mountains to be cut thorough to (horten the way } and join’d others by Bridges, of fuch an advanturous Strudure, that it is hard to conjtdhire how fuch prodigious Arches could be made over fuch yaft Precipices and Torrents. Now in regard Jman-Kouli-Kan was ftrick’n in years, he feldom went to Court, chufing rather to continue in his Government, where he was belov’dand refpe&amp;ed by all men. But the King being young, and the Government of the Kingdom in the hands of the Queen-Mother and the Atbemadoukt, who were extreamly jealous of the Km, thofe two perfons link’d together in Intereft for the maintenance of the Kings Authority and their own, fretted to fee the Kd«’s Court almoft as fplendid as the Kings ? and that nothing of the Reve nue of Schiraf) Lar, Ormus, or any part of the Perfian Golf came to the Kings Coffers, as being folely at the difpofal of the Kan ? but that on the contrary, the King was oblig’d to fend him Money to pay the Army. But that which troubled the Queen-Mother moft of all, was the pretention the K^’s eldeft Son to the Crown, who was alfo a perfon of a daring and wnbkious courage. For the Kings of Perfia efteem it a great Honour to beftow upon any K^» or great Lord, one of their Wives out of their Royal Haramyand Sba-Abbas had given to Iman-Koult-Kan one of his own proper W ives, whom he lov’d extrearnly. ’Tis thought that when (he left the Haram jfihe was three months gone with Child by Sba-Abbas ^ for feme what above fix months, after (he was bedded by the Kan, (he lay-in of a Son, of which the King was the reputed father, and who being born before Sba-Sefi, pretended a right before him to the Throne. By vertue of this claim, contrary to the will of Sha-Abbas in favour of Sha-Sefi, this ambitious Lord, who only pafs’d for the Kans eldeft Son, vehemently follicited his Father to feize upon Sha-Sefi, and to make him- felf King, or at leaft to op’n a way for him-to the Throne. Now it happen’d, that one day being a hunting with 4he young King near Schiras, the impatient young Lord coming to his Father? Sir, faid he, fee now the opportunity that offers you the Throne? for I will go prefently and bring you Sha-Sefis head. But the Kan holding his Son by the Arm, told him, that he would never con- knt to the death of his King i protefting to him, rather to'dye a thoufand deaths^ adding withall, that it was the Kings will to appoint Sha-Sefi to fuc- ceed him, as being the Son of his Son, and confequcntly his lawful Heir: that - / ' ‘■ ' the-Chap.

However the Sultanefs being not ignorant of the train that was laid for the young King, and againil the repofeof the Kingdom, thought it her wifeft way to prevent the blow, and to rid her felf of fuch perfons as had confpifd the death of the King. The Kan's two other-Sons took part with him they call’d their elder Brother. And as for the Kan himfelf, though he were upright in his Loyalty, yet his power, his wealth, his reputation among theSouldiery, and the affe&amp;ion that the people bare him, concurr’d together not only to render him fufpe&amp;ed, but guilty. The Sultanefs and the Athemadoukt took counfel together, which way to divert the ftorm that threaten’d the Kings head, to whom they reprefented, that he was not fafe in hss own perfon fo long as Iman^Kouli Kan and his three eldeft Sons liv’d. The King eafily be liev’d them, and refolv’d to be rid both of Father and Sons together, but the difficulty was to get ’em to Court, wherein opportunity it felf aftiited them. For at tha|i time Amurath the Great Turk^ at the head of a vaft Ar- ' my, was already advanc’d within^gfie Confines of had tak’n Erivan^ and had ruin’d Taurli. Upon the fim news of this march, the King fends for all thtKans and Governours to attend his perfon, with all the Forces under their command. Among the reft, the Kan oi Schiras receiv’d the fame orders ; who thereupon affembl’d all his Troops, both Horfe and Foot, who were not only - the moft numerous, but the beft difciplin’d and ftouteft Soufdiers of all PeYpa. As he was upon his march to Casbin with his three Sons, the eldeft having well cdnftder’d of affairs i Sir, faid he, We are making bafi to the King, to the end otir heads may the foonerfall at our feet. Perhaps my Son y reply 5 d the Kan y thou maifi fpeal^the truth ') but to this day I never was a Rebel againfl the King, I have done whatever he commanded, and whatever may happen 1 will obey him till death. The Kan arriving at Ca'sbin, was by the King welcom’d with great de- monftration of joy. Some days after, he took a general Mufter, and then made a great' Feaft which lifted three day, to which all the great Lords and Kans that were at Casbin were call’d. The three Sons of Iman-Kouli-Kan .were of the number*, but the Father excus’d himfelf, as well by reafon of his age, as alfo reprefenting to his Maj&amp;fy, that it better befitted him to employ his time in taking care of his affairs, and in praying for his Majeftyi however if it were his Majefties exprefs command, he would not fail to obey s to which the King return’d for anfwer, that the Kan of Schiras was at his liberty to do as he nought fit. The third day of the Feaft the King rofe from his Seat, and going out of the Hall, without fpeaking a word to any perfon, went into a Room hard by. Half an hour after, three fturdy rifolute Fellows witfi fome other Pvagamuffii^atfendants, entring the Hall with their Scimeters drawn, feiz’d upon the /Gfl/^iree Sons, and cut off their heads. They were put. into a Gold Bafon, and prefented to the King *, who commanded the Fellows to carry them to their Father, and as fodn as he had feen them, to take off his head to make the fourth. The Affaflinates found him at his prayers s but being in terrupted to fee the heads of his three Sons, he defir’d leave only to conclude, which having done, with a countenance undifturb’d, and without any other words or expreftions in his mouth than What is ufually faid among the Per- fans. Let the King^s will be done, he fubmitted to a death which he might have eafily avoided. The four heads were brought 'back to the King, to be fent into the Haram to his Mother. So foon as he had taken off the heads of the Lather and the three Sons, the King difpatch’d away certain Chappars or Courricrs, with order to the Lieutenant of the Kan, to put to death all the reft of the Chil dren. The command was obey’d, and they were ail put to death, but only two that were at Nurfe whom their Nurfes fo well conceal’d, that never any tidings; could be heard either of the Nurfes or of the Children. After the death of Iman-Kouli-Kan, the Province of Schiras, with its de? pendances, has been govern’d by a Vizir, who agrees with the King what Rent to pay him yearly.

But inlhe7w~ ~ 6 &lt;&gt;7, the King abated him eight thoq. fand Tomans, in regard he had taken from him a (mall part of his Government to pleafure a Favourite.. r . Befides what the Government of Schwas pays to the King in ready Monev he is oblig’d* every year to fend him a, prefent of all the rarities, that gf 0 vy or are bred in the Province.

Yet were he only oblig’d to prefent the King, the expence might be born weH enough-, but for fear of being difplac’d by any other Favourite, be is con- ftrain’d to make Friends of all the other great Lords and Favourites ut Court which there is no way to do,'but by continual prefents. Whereas the ancient Kattj) who were a kind of petty Soveraigns in their Governments, were only wont to fend a few Baskets of new Fruits in their feafon for the fervice of the Kings Table. To defray this expence, the Governours are forc’d to ty. rannize over the people i who when they come, as many times they do, two or three Villages together, to complain to the King, are forc’d after long* wait ing, to return with empty Purfes home again, by reafon that they who ihould give them admiffipn, are the only perfons that debar them from in and pa- ticntly to fubmit t© the Extortions of the Vizard which is a piece, of policy pn- 6Hs’d likewife by all the other Kans and Governours of the Ferftan Provinces As for Sha-Sefi himfdf, he was very fevere, and one whofe punifhments oft’n amounted to ads of cruelty. One day being a hunting, a poor Country man appear’d from behind a Rock, with a Paper in his hand , being deputed by the Village to make feme complaint to the King. But while the poor man cry’d for juftice, the King without making any anfwer, (hot two arrows into his body and ilew him. That which rpov’d Sha-Sefi to this ad of cruelty, was becaufe he had fome of his Wives with him in company. For then, there is no mercy to thofe poor people that happen to be in the way where the King chances to pafs by: no not for them that are in the Country round about, where the Eunuchs have order to kill all men they meet. When the King gives notice of his intention to carry his Wives into the Country, this is call’d CoumL and there is nothing more troublefome nor more inconvenient in the world to the poor people that live in the Villages through which thefe women are to pafsi for upon notice giv’n 'them* they muft leave their Houfes fora League or two of either fide. When there is a Courouk^ at Ifpahan^ let the weather be never do bad, the people muft leave their Houfes, and , if they have no Friends in fome difiant quarter to retire to, they have no way but to repair to the Moun tains. Such is the excefs of the jealoufie of the Kings of Perfia f which indeed de rives it felf toall his Subjeds, who will not permit their women to be feen bv anv but their owrt Husbands.' b The Perfians both men and women are fo addided to take Tobacco, th; mtake Tobacco from them, is to takeaway their lives. So that if die Kin ihouid prohibit /Tobacco for any time, he would lofe a good part of hisrev( nue. However in a humor having once for bid d’n Tobacco to be taken i any part of his Dominion, his Spies (that are in every City) found in the India Inn two rich Merchants of that Nation fmoaking their nofes. Immediately the ^re feizd, bound, and c^rry’d to the King, who commanded forthwith that Tuftic fhomdbe dope upon them in the Meidan, which was, that theyihould pour meltc lead down their throats till they were dead.

And at the fame time commanded his eyes to be pull ’d out of his head. It is a cuftom, that if any man points at the King as he paffes along in the Street, or upon the Road, he mu ft lofe his hand. One day Sha-Sefi being in the Country, rwo Merchants of Confiantinople were upon the Road, where the King and his Train were to pafs. They ftopp’d to fee the King, and when he came near, one of the Merchants pray’d his Friend that oft’n had feed him, to fhew him which was he.

Iman-CoulhKan prefented it to the if ing •, who was mightily pleas’d with it, in regard it was the leaft linking Watch that eves had been feen by the King, who therefore carry’d it hanging about his Neck under his Cloathes, in a Gold Chain. One day the King happening to wind up his Watch, and turning the Key the wrong way, broke the Fufil, for which he was fo much troubl’d, that he fent for the Watch maker fiom Ifpaban to Cashing whither when Ralph came, he prelently made the Watch as good as ever. The King thus fatisfy’d in his work and in his per 1 i fon, order’d him a Penfion of thirty Tomans, and Diet for him and a man, and provition for two Horfes : commanding him withall to make fome new pieces of work.

The Perfian being thus flain, Ralph went in the morning to wind up the Kings Watch i and being ask’d by the King, as he was wont to do, what news in Ifpahan, told him plainly what he had done and the reafon why. The King upon his report told him, he had done well according to the ftri&amp;nefs of the Country. The Atbemadoulet at that time was Mirza Tahe^ who hated Ralph. For the Armenian Merchants having prefented the Aihemadoulet with feveral Watches at a time, it happen’d that once he fent to Ralph about thirty Watches toge ther to be mended. For which the Athemadoulet^ to gratifie him, and knowing that he kept four or five Servants, and feven or eight Horfes, Tent him fifteen or twenty Camels load of Straw and Barley for his Horfes.

Thereupon the Athemadculet^ whofe bufinefs it is to attend the King when he rifes, and to report to him the news of the Town, told him among the reft, what Ralph had done. The King reply’d, that Ralph had confels’d it to him already, and that he had pardon’d him, in regard he had reafbmto do as he did.

Every body had reafon to complain -, Y e t no perfon knew how to come at the King to make their complaints. At length they bethought themfelves of making their application to two black Eunuchs who had the Kings ear in the night. One was call'd Aga-Saron, who was the Meter or Mailer of the Wardrobes and the other Aga-Kafow, or high Treafurer. Thefe two Eunuchs feeing the King in a good humour one night let Tall certain words concerning the Nazar, and his management of affairs and thence Hid into a difcourfe of his injuftice, that caus’d the people to cry* ut 3 g a j n ft him, and fpeak evil of his Government. Now,it happen’d one morning that the King intending to go a hunting, the Grand Maifer, who had always a large hai n attending him, coming to the Kings Tent, the Meter deny’d him entrance. About the fame time the King came forth, and feeing the Nazar, commanded his Officers to take off the Bonnet from the dead of that Dog that took Gifts from his people j and that he fhould fit three days bareheaded in the heat of the Sun and as many nights in the Air. Afterwards he caus’d him to be chain’d about the neck and arms, and condemn’d him to perpetual imprifonment, with a Mamou- dy a day for his maintenance v but he dy’d for grief within eight days after he was put in prifon. Jafer-Kan, being a generous Lord, and one that kept a magnificent train, was Governour of AJierabat. At firft he was very mild, but at lafl he began to exadfc fuch fums from the people, that his oppreilions were very heavy, ror were thefe violences of his conceal’d from the Kings ear, who being one day drinking with fome of his Lords, and feeing the Maher of his Mufick in the Room, who was a merry, droll, and had always fome pleafant news or other to tell the King * his Majefly was pleas’d to ask him, what the people faid of Jafer-Kan •, adding withall, that he had made him Governour of feveral Pro* vinces, and had never heard any complaint of him before, but that now he was accus’d of ftrangely tyrannising ovb the people. The Mufick Matter being a meer flatterer, and knowing t\\zt Jafer-Kan was extreamly belov’d by the King, confidently avert’d, that the Governour was falfly accus’d, and that he had always known him apter to give then to receive. There was at the fame time in the Room, an Agis call’d Manoucbar-Kan, lately return’d from a Pilgrimage to Mecca *, him the King alfo ask’d, what was his opinion of Jafer-Kan, and his Government, being a perfon that had been long acquainted with him; to whom the Agh, thinking to pleafe the King, return’d the fame anfwer, that the Mu- Tick Matter had giv’n. Whereupon the King, who had been well inform’d of the Kans behaviour, turning toward the Lords that were prefen r, what tbin^you, faid he, of thefe two Flatterers, that abjolutely kriow the contrary to what tbeyfpeai? And at the fame time fcommanded two of the Mufick Matters teeth to be pull’d out of his mouth, and to be driv’n into the head of the Agit ; which had like to have coft him his life, being a very old man. As for Jafer-Kan, he wasdifgrac’d for a time, but being a Perfon endow’d with noble qualities, valiant, generous and pleating in converfation, he was recall’d to Court, and knew fo well how to make his tale good, that his Majetty gave him the Government of Sbemeloubojlan, of which Semeran is the Capital City.

Of the misfortune of Mahomet Beg in the reign of Sha-Abbas thefecond. \ / M Ahomet ¥&gt;eg was born at Tauris, the Son of a Taylor, who bred him a Scho lar.- He had a quick apprehenfion, and was naturally endin’d tovertuei and being defirous to advance himfdf in the world, he had the good luck to ob tain the employment of Major-Bajhi, or chief of the EiTayers and Refiners of Mo ney, who has a power to vifit all places where money is ccyn’d. After that, he became acquainted with the Aila Verdi Beg, or Mr. Godfgift^ the Kings chief Huntfman, by the title o£Mert-Shebgr-Bafhi) who gladly prefented him to the King, to whom the King was very thankful, fo foon as he had founcfthe noble Qua* lities of the perfon he had prefented. Thereupon fb foon as Mahomet grand Matter of the Kings Houfe dy’d, the King beftow’d that Employment upon Maho met Beg) who not only gain’d the favour of his Majefty, but the good will of all the Lords of the Court. He had a great refpedf for them all, without medling with any of their employments, and fuppreft his revengeful fpirit, not finding it feafonable as yet to difclofc his paffions. Kalife Sultan at that time Athemadoukt hapning to dye, the King conferr’d that place upon Mahomet Beg) who at firfl: behav’d himlelfin that employment to the fatisfa&amp;ion of all men. He apply’d himfelf particularly to the fearching out of Mines v for there had a report ran among the people for many years, that if certain mountains nine or ten miles from Ifpahan toward the Weft were well - digg’d into, there might be found ftore of Gold, Silver and Copper. To which purpofe he made ufe of a Norman^ whofe name was La Chapelle de Han) who vanted at that time to have great skill in Chymiftry, Mines and Minerals, for which reafon he was recommended by the Governor of Ifpahan to the Athemadoulet then at Cashin with the King, who prefently fent him back again to the Governourto farnidi him with all things neceffary for hisExpences, and for the work which he undertook in the Mountains. Thither went La Chapelk) and after fifteen days toyl return’d to Ijfahan with two or three hunder’d weight of earth, and fet up fur naces to draw out the metal. The Athemadoulet was fo wife as to give order to the Governour of Iffahaii) and three or four more perfons of Quality to overview the Noiman, to fee that he play’d no foul play. But though there was not fo much as a half peny worth of filver in all the earth from the bottom to the top, though the Terftans watch’d him fo narrowly as they did, hemade a fbift tolhuf- fle in an Ahaffi among the earth, as it was in the furnace without being perceiv’d. Neverthelefs the Athemadoulet) to whom it was carry’d, prefently found out the cheat, though he took no notice of it, hoping to make better ufe of the Norman in other things*, only he forbad him to dig any more in that place, in regard the expence would exceed the profit. La Chapeth) who was very skilful at putting off his merchandize, and one who knew to make the beft ufe of the leaft fmackering that he might perhaps have in Mechanicks, and the power ofMotion, had thecunningto amufe the Athemadottkt for ten years together, being a paflion ate Lover of new Inventions j and the better to infjnuate himfelf into the Kings favour aflum’d to himfelf the Invention of feveral Rarities which he fhew’d the King, who thereupon allow’d him a very handfome penfion. Thus encourag’d, he undertook to caft Canons, bring the water to the top of the Kings houfe, and feveral other things, yet when all his defigns fail’d fer want of Art, and that he found he could do no more good in Perfia) refblving for India, he dy’d at Ormw, The Athemadoulet miffing of Gold and Silver Mines, applg’d himfelf to the dif- covery of Copper Mines, wherein he was more fortunate \ for in thofe Mines he* alfb found veins of Azure, of which there is a great quantity confum’d in painting the Grotefco Flourijhes upon the Ceilings and Arches of their Houfes. He alfo found out a Mine of Lead near Terde : and being ftillupon new difeoveries, he found out/ Chap. VI, of Monfieur Tavernier. 215 a Mine of Talk, Stone ? Allum, and Coles, but ot neither fo good as in other Coun tries. He was fo obhinate in the fearch of Metals, that if any perfon had an occa- fion to fpeak with him, let him be never fo bulk upon never fo important affairs, it was enough to bring himfome hones of aTuppofed Mine, or fometing rare ei ther for Colour, Figure or Weight. Healfo gave full power to them that brought him any tidings of a Mine to go to the place, and to prefs the Countrynaen from their labour to digin the Mountains and break up rocks; and if they found no thing he cait the fault uponthe ignorance of the Labourers.) He alfo apply’d himfelf to the ftudy of Mechanic Motions. He would have found an Invention, whereby the half Vail that hangs in the Kings Megeier, or Council Chamber, and is drawn to and fro by certain Officers in the Summer, to gather the cool Air, fhpuld have bin made by Engine* work. Then betook a fan cy for water Engines, the moh necelfary thing in the world for Perfia to relieve the drowth of the Country, but wanting necdTries, as Beams, Rafters, Wheel- work, Cordage and Iron,he could not begin thofe Engines, the figures whereof La Cbapelle had left him in a Book. But as Mahomet Beg was ftudious in thefe things, fo was he Ambitious and Re vengeful to that height that he could not obferve a moderation in his refentment againft thofe that had given him any diftafte. In his height of Pa ilia n he caus’d fevenl Kant to be depriv’d of their Provinces, and by confifcating their Efiates reduc’d them to utmoft nccellity. ^ . The Kan of Erivan had a Son who was a lovely and a well proportion’d Gentle man, and always attended at the Kings Elbow.One day that the King was drinking with fome Lords, he commanded the Kan ot Erivans Son to carry a Gold Cup full of Wine to the who perceiving that he had enough already, made a fign with his eye to the young Lord to return it back. The young Lord paffing by the King told him ingeniouily that the Atbemadoulet had no deiire to , drink, whereupon the King commanded him to go and powre the WineTnto his bofome. As the one was oblig’d to obey, the Athemadoulet was foic’d to fuf- fer, and to permit the young man to open his bofome and powre down the Wine-, for not daring to (hew his anger, he was forc’d to diflemble the bell he could for that time. But having refolv’d to revenge the affyont upon the Kan of Erivan Father of the young Lord, who had only done what the King command ed him, he refolv’d to lay hold upon the opportunity that prefented it felf, know ing that there were feveral complaints come againft fiina from the Armenians of Erivan. Thereupon the AthemadouUt fends for the Kelonter^ encourages him in his fuit, and gives him inftrudfions how to proceed. To this end Mahomet Beg appoints him to meet him fuch an hour at the Kings Stables, whither the King prefently Coming, the Kelonter threw himfelf at the Kings feet, and be- fought him for Juftice againft the Kan of Erivans oppreffions: while Mahomet Beg fail’d not to heap up aggravations againft the Governour, and the King, though he had heard but 6ne fide, as eafily condemn’d him upon the Accufation of the Kelonter and hts Prime Minifter. Thereupon an Officpr of the Kings, call’d Negef-Couli-Beg, 2 man of a quick and a&amp;ive fpirit was commanded to go in all hafte, and feiie upon the Ptrfon of the Kan. Who being come to Erivan found him upon his feat of juftice, confifcating and condemning to fine and Corporal puniftiment a near Klnfman of the Kelonters. The Meftenger boldly entered into the Megeler or Council Chamber, goes diredfcly totheiCdw, told him he was thd Kings prifner, and gave him a blow with his fift upon the neck, about which he waste wear the Triangle of great thick pieces of wood already deferib’d, into which the neck is enclos’d, while the Arms and Hands of the Prifner are put through another piece of wood that croffes the Triangle, which is a great pain to the Priiner. Thus was the Kan carry’d night and day to IJpahan^ but when he came there the King Ihew’d him more mercy, and allowed him his houfe for a prifon, yet not fuffering him to go to the Bath, nor to (have his hair, nor to ftir out of the Apartment where his women were. Thefe are penalties impos’d upon thofe that fall into difgrace at Court, whom the King (huts up in their houfes, in tending no feverer puniftiment. For the Kan being belov’d by the King was ie- ftoiM to his favour, and to his former charge of fuperintendant of the Kings Mofquee. V ' CC2 '' NeitherThe Persian Travels Book V. Neither did this fright 5 n others from bearing up againft the Power of Mahoi Beg, though every one had not the fame fuccefs.

His Lie^ tenant and an Eunuch,thathad bin his Treafurer, were ferv’d in the fame fawce ^ all three put into a high Chamber that ferv’d inftead of a prifon. His Vizier* 1 Lieutenant was releas’d in a fhort while, but Mirza Haddi and his Eunuch were ft.II kept clofe. ' 11111 Nor is the manner of his revenging himfelf upon Mir-Katfem-Beg, the Derco or Provoft o[IJpaban lefs remarkable. While Mahomet Beg was only M/ier-B- Jhi, there wasfome gold Plate ftoll’n out of the Kings Kitchin. Thereupon the” Veroga fent his Officers to feize upon all the Goldfmiths in Ifpahan, that knew nothing of the matter, as being utterly innocent of the Robbery. In the mean time he put them all in prifon, and loekt them clofe up, intimating to them that he was refolv’d not to releafe them without a good fum of money. The poor Goldfmhhs thus ill us’d, apply’d themfelvesto who fent his Of fers to intreat the Veroga fo confiderthat the Gold-fmiths were innocent of the Robbery, and that being in feme manner under the Jurifdi&amp;ion 0 f the Mayer-Balhi as being Artificers in Gpld.and Silver, he ought not to refufe to difeharge them at his requeft.

Mahomet Beg loft no time* but by vertue of his Authority and the Kings command, fent his Officers into all the Villages to take the Oath of eve ry Country-man to the end they ftiould declare the truth, under the penalty ot a Fine and Corporal puniffiment, of what had been exadled from them to the ut- moft Shayet. This Oath was to be put in Paper, fign’d by every one that made it, in thefe words, Let my head he confifcated to the King^ and my goods to his Divan, if I do not puntinally the Order of his Majefiy. The accompt being made of all the money for which they had compounded with the Deroga, it was prefented by Mahomet Beg&gt; who aggravated the Tyranny of the Deroga, and reprefented to his Majefty that for thirty years he had thus devour’d the Territories of Ifpahan. Thereupon by the command of the King^who was then at Ifpahan^ the Deroga was to be carry’d into the Meydan^ and being ty*d up by the heels to receive a certain number of Baftinado’s upon the feet for fomany Fridays one after another j and moreover the nerves of his heels were to be cut, and his ankles to be bear’d tho rough. The Kings command being thus feafd, Mahomet Beg committed the ex ecution thereof to his tmfty Inftrument Negcf-CoulhBeg, who coming to Ifpahan affembl’d the chief of the City, together with the Vizir or Governour, and the Veroga or Provoft, who thought of nothing ; being met, before they broak open theKings Seal they made a publick Prayer for the profperity of the King *, which being ended, the F/z/r open’d the Letter and read it with a loud voice. When the Vizir carre to read the Sentence againft the Deroga, he wasfeiz’d wkh aftonifti- ment, at what time Negef-Coult-Beg coming to the Veroga^nd firiking him upon the Neck with his fift, threw him down under his Horfes feet, and caus’d him to be bound according to cuftom. Immediately he was hurri’d to the Piazza, where he receiv’d fo many Baftinado’s upon the foies of his feet that his nayls fell off. The next Friday they brought him to the fame place, where they repeated the fame Execution, and boat’d his ankles. The Deroga being very ancient, his pains put him into fuch a condition as mov’d NegefCouli-Beg hlmfelf to compaftion, who wrote prefently to Court, that the continuance of fo much torment, would infal libly be the death of the old man. Upon that the King order’d that there ffiould no more be done to him j only that he ftiould be ffiut up in the inner part of his Houfe with his Wives, depriving him of his employment, but leaving him his Eftate. But Mahomet Beg, not having yet compleated the revenge he fought, was r£- folv’d after he had thus tormented - him to deprive him, alfo of his Eftate. To which purpofe he advanc’d to the Office of Veroga, a Georgian Renegado who was call’d Padada-Beg, whom he taught all the tricks imaginable to pick the peoples-pockets. The deOgn of Mahomet Beg in this, was to let the Kingundtr- ftand, that if the new Deroga could heap kp fuch a fum of money in five or fix ttionths, what a prodigious fum muft Mir KaJfembeg have heap’d up in fo many years. In (hort, the new Deroga inftrudted and encourag’d by Mahomet Beg, le- vy’d unjuftly fuch a vaft number of fines, committed fo many extortions and ra pines upon the people, that at the end of fix months the people began to tumult at the Palace gate. The Divan-Bequi, who is the firft Minifter of Juftice, took the peoples part •, whereupon Mahomet Beg perceiving he had been too hafty in his deiign to be reveng’d upon the Divan Bequi, who had crofs’d his defigns, one morning caus’d feveral files of JVfofqucteers to be drawn up at the Kings Haram, The King furpriz’d at the fight, Mahomet Beg told him that his Majefty was not fafe fo long as the Divan Bequi iWtPd up the people to Rebellion; which fo in cens’d the King, that he caus’d the Groom Porter to go immediately and pull out the Divan Beqm's eyes, which was immediately done i nor did the old man fay any more, but with his face all befmear’d with his own goar, defir’d the fervant upon whofe arms he lean’d, to turn him toward Mecca that he might pray for the profperity of the King. All his goods were confifcated and brought into the Trea- fury»but Mer Kajf m-heg ftill enjoy’d his, though he was forc’d to fpend the remain der of his days in his own houfe. Thus Mahomet Beg preferv’d himfelf ftill in the Kings favour, and had remov’d all thofe perfons from the Court that had no kindnefs for him, and was indifferently Lfe, till Mir-Tchekfr-Bafki another favourite, whom the King highly lov’d, began : , . , ' ■ 7 to- .......

During this contefi ran a xe . port of a rebellioniipon Georgia hde. Whereupon the Atbemadcukt per (waded the King to fend lately made KouUr Agafi cr General cf the Slaves toward Georgia, that fo he might remove his Rival firm Court. The Fa vourite fe*s forward with a flying Camp, but not finding any Enemy that oppos’d him, wrote back to the King that he faw, no appearance ofan Enemy, and that therefore it was a needlefs thing to tire the Souldiers in a Country where there wasno face of War, and begg’d his Majefties leave to return. The Memadonkt on the other fide labour’d to hinder his return by preaching to the King the advan tages of the Pay of thofe forces in thofe parts. v In this interim the Vsbek Tartars had made inroads upon'the Frontiers of G- ratfan, and had Pain feveral of people, who was governor of the Pro vince. Mahomet Beg who was his Kinfman, gave the King to underhand that the Kan ot Corajfan had behavM himfelf valiantly^ but conceal’d the defeat of the Kan. On the other fide the Koular Agafi fent Letter upon Letter to the King, but perceiving that none of them came to the Kings hands, he fent ioljpabanm ofhis difereeteft and moP fxuPy fervsnts, who coming to Court intermix’d him felf among the reP of the Lackeys.

Prefently after, the young man meeting the Meter told him he had Letters of importance to deliver into the Kings own hard, cfwhichthe Meter giving notice to the King, the meffenger was immediately call’d in. The King having read the Letters which difeover’d to him what the Athmadonkt had conceal’d from him touching the no neceffity of keeping forces upon the Frontiers of Georgia^ and the lofs which the of Kcrdjfan fad receiv’d, tranfported with choler againft his prime MiniPer, fent for him, and after he had moP bloodily revil’d and reproach’d him, he was within a little of killing him with his own hands.

EutSha-Seft fucceeding his Grandfather very young, this tributary Prince (hook off his yoak, and refus’d to pay. Which not being regard ed in the reign of Sba-Sefi, the Prince of Jafque thought to do the fame in the reign of Sba-Abbot the fecond. But at length after he had refus’d to pay for fome years, the Kan of Ormus pretending the Country to be under his Jurifdi&amp;ion, and that the Kings honour was concern’d in the Princes refufal, incited Sba-Abbas to fend forces againft him to reduce him to obedience. The King granted the Com- midion to him that had undertaken the bufinefs: who prefently gathering toge ther an Army of 20000 men, the moft part Horfe, thought to have furpriz’d his Enemy .To which purpofe that he might take the neareft way, he march’d direct ly toward Cape Jafque. But as it was the (horteft cut, it was the moft dangerous 5 infomuch that the Kan, who hunted all the way he march’d, according to the cuftom of Perfia, had the misfortune to fall into abogg, where he was ftifl’d, to gether with 20 or 30 horfemen more. The death of the Kan being divulg’d, the Army retreated back again: but as foon as the King receiv’d the news, he fen t the Brother- of the deceas’d Kan to fucceed him. In the mean while the Rebel Prince believing within himfelf, that he was not to be thus at quiet, and expedting to be attack’d by the new Kan, flood upon his guard. And indeed the new Kan march’d with all the fpeed he could, and enter’d the territories of the rebellious Prince, but being beat’n was forc’d to make more hafte back again to Omut, with the lofs of an abundance of men. v The Prince of Jafque puft up with this fuccefs, did, not believe that the Perfi- ons would be fo hatty to come again: and thereupon he refolv’d upon a Voyage for Mecca to give the Prophet thanks for his Vidfory. To which end he embarqu’d at the neareft place he could to Cape Jafque, thence to make fail toward Arabia* But the Governor of Kan underftanding his deiign by his fpies, way-laid him by Sea, took him and brought him to At that time the heats being excef- (ive, the Governour was retir’d, according to cuftome, to the Mountains fome fen or twelve Leagues from the City, whither the Prince was carry’d and brought to the Kans tent. . But while the Kan was expecting the return of the Meffenger which he had fent to the King for orders what to do with the Prifoner, the Princes wite hearing of her husbands misfortune, and being a woman of a manlike cou- r ^ge, taking along with her about five or fix hundred horfe, with little noifeand by long marches (he at length fell unawares upon the Kan about midnight, kill’d him with her own hand, cut in pieces the greateft part of his men, whom (he found afleep, carry’d away ten or twelve of his wives, and fet her husband at li berty in fpiteof the Per fans, who had not time to rally themfelves.

After the Kan had tormented him in this manner three days together, the chiefofthe Holland Com pany and other ftrange Merchants abhorring fo much cruelty, begg’d of the Kan to furceafe his rigour, who readily granted them their requeft. CHAP. VIII. Obfervatiom upon the reign of Sha-Soliman the prefent King, A Li-Cottli-Kan had bin three or four times exil’d from the Court, for fpeaking with two much liberty. For he was bold and could not keep his tongue between his teeth. For which reafon he was call’d the Kings Lyon, who was wont to chain him up when he had no occafion for him, and to let him loofe when he ; had any bulinefs for him to do. The laft time he was exil’d, he was kept five or fix years in a Fortrefs out of which he had never ftirr’d ; But one day, having a fmooth tongue, he over-perfwaded the Commander to give him leave to go a hunting with him. When hereturn’d, withthehelp of forceofhis fervants, befell upon the Commander, and gave him fo many Baftinadoe’s upon the feet, that he had like to have kill’d him: felling him withall, that it was to teach him his duty, not to let a man go that the King had committed to his charge. Sha-Sephi.thovgh very young, hearing of this, and defirousto fee Ali-Couli-Kan, notwithftanding all the endeavours of the Grandees to hinder his return, commanded him to be fet at liberty, and that he fhould have a better allowance to live upon. Two or three days after, the King fitting in Council, the whole Affembly was amaz’d to fee Ali-Couii-Kan enter, who approaching his Majefly with a profound reverence, told him, that the Lyon being now let loofe was humbly come to kifs his hands. Thereupon the King fell a laughing, and calling a favourable glance upon him told him he had done well. Nor was it long ere the King finding him no lefs pleafant in converfation, then a valiant and expert Captain, made him Generaliflimo ofhis Armies, as he had bin in the reign of Sha-Abbot. Wh- the Court faw Ali-Couli-Kan fo well receiv’d,every one then labour'd to teltihe their joy for his return.They fent him Horfes, Mules,Camels, rich Carpets, an .. ^ Curnilh a Lords houfe. But all this while he wanted money, wme ecaufe he could not meet with among the Perfianr, he was forc’d to have recourle to the Armenians ,of whom he defir’d to borrow live or fix hundcr’d I omans. As for the Kalenter lie would have had the fum lent, but the reft would not.

Which favour, as he order’d if, coft the Armenians ten thoufand To mans to the King, and four or five thoufand Tomans to his Favourite. The 23. of September i^ 77 &gt; the King made a Cavalcade, then which there could be nothing imagin’d more magnificent. All the richeft Furniture was brought out of the Exchequer into the Meydan. The golded buckets to water the Horfes. The golden Fat out of which they take the water, together with buckles, hamefs and nails of gold, to which the Horfes are ty’d. After the King had play’d at Mall, as I have already dekrib’d, and had alfo (hot at the Goblet upon the top of the Mad in the middle of the Meydan, he went and fate in the Vivan, which is over the Gate call’d Ali Capi, where he had the paftime to fee Lyons, Bulls, Bears, Tygers and Rams fight. But that which was mod admirable, was to fee a man (land upright upon the Saddle while the hoife ran full fpeed, which he did three times the whole length of the Meydan. The firft time, ’tis true, he fell but the two laft times he flood firm. One day the fame Ali-Coult-Kan vt&amp;nte&amp; two handfom Youths to the King, which had both delicate voices.

The Chirurgeon for lucre of a large recompence, cut them both and cur’d ’em very well. Which done, Ali-Couli- Kan, prefented the two youths to the King, who ryas furpriz’d to fee them, but was well pleas’d that he had got two fuch new attendants in his Haram. But fee the reward ot fuch a wicked action. Ali-Couli-Kan dy d foon after. The Chi rurgeon never was pay’d: and being advis’d to prefent a Petition to the King by the Meter, the Meter ask’d him whether he would turn Mahometan : which when the Chirurgeon deny’d to do, the Meter bid him be gone like a Rafcal, telling him withall that he did not think the Religion of the Chriftians had permitted fuch a£ts oi villany.The two youths were born at Cafhan,zn&lt;\ had both Fathers and Mothers, and were promis’d in Marriage. When their Parents heard of it, they came to Ifpahanj to weep over their Children. Which the King obferving, to appeafe their forrow, gave them a Penfion during life. 2 1 9 / CHAP. IX. Of the Government o/Perfia. T H E Government of Perfta is purely Defpotick or Tyrannical. For the King has the fble power oflife and death over all his Subjedfs, independent from his Council, and without any Trials or Law-proceedings. He can put to what death he pleafes the chief Lords of the Kingdom, no man daring to difpute the reafbn, nor is there any Soveraign in the world more abfolute then the King 01 Perfia? ' , ■ 1 The King deceafmg and leaving Male Iffhe behind him, the Eldeft afeends the Throne, while his Brothers are kept in the Haram,*t\6. their eyes are put out: and if there be the - leaft fufpicion of any contrivance againft the King, they are forth with put to death without any farther examination. And not only they, but the Children alfo of the Kings Brothers and Sifters. I remember when I firft travell d in to Perfia, they werernot fb rigorous, but were contented to move a red hot iron to and fro before their eyes. But Sba-Sefi perceiving his command had been neg ligently executed, and that the poor unhappy Princes had feme fight left them Dd he BThe Persian Travels Book V. he order’d their eyes to be digg’d out of their heads, Sha-Sefs ci ueity went yet farther, for he fpar’d not his FJdeft Son Sba-Abbiifi, the lawful Heir to his Throne, ordering one of his Eunuchs to move an Iren before his eyes, roman being able to tell the reafon. But the Eunuch com paihonanng the your g Prince, did indeed move an Iron, but not a red hot Iron before-his Eyes a ”d teaching him to counterfeit himfelf blind, prefervM his light till his Father lay upon his death-bed : at which time his Father was very peamertt, for having put out the eyes of his Eldeft Son, to whom the Throne of right belong’d. The Eunuch feeing the King fo fadly afflided and ready to give up the ghoff a Far’d him that he would rellore the Prince to his fight, and to comfort Him at his death, brought the Prince with perfe6t eyes to the bed fide. The light of which pro’ long'd the Kings life till next day •, and gave him time to command all the Gran dees of the Court to obey Sha-Abbjs his Eideft Son, as his lawful Suecdfor and their King. But to return to thefe blind Princes There were fevcral at Ifpahan when I was there: and I knew one particularly j who is ftiil alive, and is a perion of ex cellent natural parts, As blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curiofuics, and has built him a Houfe in Ifpaban, which is worthy a mans light. He is overjoy’d when any perfon brings him any rarities out of Europe, feeling them in his hands, and cauling his Eunuchs, which are very apprehenliye, to tdi him the meaning of every thing. He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and can tell by his finger when a Watch is right in the Cafe. Jo know what a Clock it is, he has little points fet up in the Dial-plate, and a half hand, to the end he may not be deceiv’d which part of the hand points to the hour. By means of certain figures which he makes of folt wax, and fets in or der upon a Table, he will caft up an accompt very exaftly. Several other good qualities I admir’d in him *, and it griev’d me to fee a man reduc’d to that miferable Condition, only becaufe he was of the blood Royal of Per* fia. Though the Employments of the Kingdom generally fall from Father to Son, yet the King il he pleales may bequeath the Governments of Provinces or any other dignities to any of his Goulami which are his Slaves, if he find-them ca pable, and thinks they may be fit for his fervice. The Father to leave the Em ployment to his Family, labours by degrees to introduce his Son, and to obtain the Survivorlhip for him. But if the Father dye, and leaves the Survivorfhip to an Infant, there is generally a perfon of Age and Experience fent along with him, Some there are alfo that obtain employments by prefenting the Favourites at Court. The State of Per/J* is diftinguilh’d like moft of the European States, in to three Bodies. Thefirft is thatof the Sword, which anfwers to the Nobility, and com prehends the Kings houlholdj the Kans^ and all the Souldiery. The fecond is that of the Quill, comprehending all thole that belong to the Law and the Courts of juft ices. The third is compos’d of Merchants, Handicrafts-men and La bourers. 1 / CHAP*\ Chap.

T HE Primier Minifter of the Kingdom is call’d Atbemadoulet^ or the fupport of Riches. His office is the {anyi with the Grand Vizir s in furkie, and may be compar’d to the ancient Mayors oi the Palace in France. In regard all the af fairs of the Kingdom pafs through his hands, he ought to be rather a'Gownman then a Souldier : and herein he only differs^om the Grand Vizier, who is always to be at the head of the Army, and for ev^ry flight fault or diftafte is fubjedt to be ftrangl’d by the Grand Signior. Whereas in Perfta^fhcrc the Government is milder, the Prime Minillers generally dye in their beds, or if they are Depos’d, they are only exil’d to feme frontier City, where they live as private men. /&gt; ' . , , ^ r * Wheh the King is young, the Prime Minifier has a hard game to play, tor then the Favourite Eunuchs and the Sultanefles difannul and cancel in the night what ever orders he makes in the day time. The Nazar or Seer has the charge of all the Kings goods, of his breeds of hor- fes, of his moveables, of his Cloaths and Plate t much like the grand Mailer of the Kings Houfe in France. t ^ n ^ f r . The Mehter, who is always a white Eunuch, is the firft Gentleman ot the Kings Chamber, and follows the King with a kind of bag hanging by his fide full of handkerchiefs. And as he is always at the Kings elbow, if he haVe the Kings ear, it is eafie for him to befriend or do unkindneffes, as his inclination leads him. During the minority of the King, fome of thefe Mebters have b?en known to go vern the Kingdom. The Mir-AkJ)or-Ba(hi, or Grand Efquire, has the Charge of the Kings btables, which as well as the Gate of Aii-Capn, are a place of Refuge, and whoever faves himfelf therein, let it be for Murther or Debt is fafe. All the Horfes in the Kings Stable are mark’d with a hot iron upon the left hip, and thofe that belong to pri vate perfons upon the right. Thofe that the King gives to them that ferve in his Annies, have the Kings mark, and are not to be fold, but they may be chaffer d away. If any of thofe Horfes happens to dye in a Horfe-mans hands, he muff flea off the Kings mark, and carry it to the under Offi cers of the General of the Cavalry, to have a nother, othe'rwife he would be forc’d to buy another at his own expences. Thofe people by laying the skin in the water, know, though by what art I cannot tefl, whither the Horfe dy d of age or ficknefs, or whither he were malitioufly kill’d. For in times of Peace there are fom Horfe* men that will kill their Horfes, to fave the Charges of keeping any more than themfelves: then at the next Mufter they bring the skin of their Horfe, with the mark on, to the Of ficers, and get another, unlefs they be found out. Nor are their Horfes only mark’d, but their Scimitars, Mufquets, Bows and Quivers, all which they muft fhew to the Commiffioners every Mufter.

Thefe people live in Tents, like the Turcomans , and they fend their Youth betimes jo the King. They furnilh their Youth alfo with all necef- faries, and maintain them till they come to be taken notice of by the King. They are all Horfe- men, well paid, and well look’d to, and are many times advanc’d to the Supreme Dignities of the Kingdom. They are generally call’d Kefel-Bajhi or Red-heads, becaufe that formerly they wore red Bonnets. It is faid that the King has about 22000 of thefe Corchis in pay, all good Souldiers, that'do won ders in Battel. S ha-Abbas the hr ft, did what he could to abolifh this Militia, and to fet up the Goulams in their head. His hatred againft them was only becaufe he thought them too powerful i for he was wont to fay to his Favourites, that nothing but the Puiflfance of the Corchis, could oppofe the Royal Power, There upon he took away fome of their Piiviledges, and gave them to the Doulms \ but he could not bring about his defign any farther. The General of the Corchis is call’d Corfchi-Bajhi, and ought to be one of their Body •&gt; nor can the King impofe another upon them. The Mim-Bajhi commands a thoufand Men, the commands a hundred, and the Om-Bajhi com mands ten. The Corfcbi-Bajhi l\as 150 Tomans a year •&gt; the Mim-Ba(ki fixty-two i the thirty, and the Om-Bafhi fifteen. The pay of every Horfe man is from nine to fifteen a year. Befides, every year the King makes a gene ral Mutter, and then he gives to the Corftchis a third part more than their ufual payy however, to fome more, toothers lefs, either according to favour or merit. When the King has refolv’d to put a great Man to death, he commits the execu* tion of his command to a Corfcbi. The Goukr-Agafi is General of the Goulams, or Slaves. For indeed they are either Slaves, or the Sons of Slaves of all forts of Nations, who do the King ve ry good Service. They are for the mott part runnegade Georgians j and there are about 18000 of thefe being all Horfe-men whofe pay is from five to eight Tomans a year. The Corfchis are very good Husbands j but the Goulams, as foon as they have receiv’d their pay, fall a drinking and fwaggering j whereas the other, if he has a Piafier to fpare, will buy a Sheep with it; For in regard they live in Tents, their Riches confifts in Flocks. The greatett part of the Court of Perfia is made up of thefe two Bodies. The Goulams have this peculiar to them- felves, that they are very rarely known to revolt. For being all Slaves, and of different Nations, there are no ties of Affedion or Kindred between them: And if the King has an occafion to punifh any of them, the chief of their Body is to execute his orders. The Goulams carry no other Arms befides a Bow and Ar rows, with a Skain. Though fome wear Coats of Mail, and Head-pieces: others Vambraces and Battel-Axes. Thefe Horfc-men never entrench in the Field like ours in Europe, nor have they any Field-Marlhals to affign them quarters. For after the chief have taken up the bett places, the reft fet up their Tents as ucer as they can to the Pavillion of the General. The Tufenkgiler- Agafi is^ the General of the TufenJ^gis, who compofe the third Body of the Militia. This part of the Souldiery was but lately inttituted, being compos’d of men taken from the Plough, as being mott fit for labour. They are Foot-men with only a Scimiter and a Musket. But when they march, they have a Horfe or a Mule between three or four, to carry their Baggage and Provifions. Their pay is not above four or five Tomans a year. And for their Officers, their pay is more or lefs according to their Quality and Command. They are in no, great reputation, being laugh’d at by the old Souldiers, as being a company of poor Countrey-men, that dare not look an enemy in the face. Not but that the Infantry o£Perfia is able to do good fervice; though, as numerous as they are, the ding never makes ufe of them, but in cafe of needfity. When he marches in perfon, he iends for eight or ten thoufand, which he fends for out of what Province bttt pkafes him, and they prove very ufeful to the Army, as Sutlers.

When the King fits in Council, he Hands there with a Battoon in his hand,and throws himfelf to the ground when the King beckons to him to come and receive any command from his mouth. The Topigi-Bajhiisthe Mader of the Ordnance, and chief of the Sea-affairs, but he has little to do in either employment. For, as for the Cannon, there are only fome two or three 1 pittiful Guns in fome of the Frontier-towns: And for Ships, there are none in Perfia but what come from Europe or the Indies to Or mm or Balfara, The Per* [tans themfelves have no other Ships than fome few large Barks in the Perfian- Gulph, and in fome parts of the Cajpian-Sea, where they keep a Fleet againft the Vsbeckffartars, the Kalmoutys, and other people. As for the Karis or Governors of Provinces, they are generally chofen out of the body of Corfchis and Goulams who are handlom perfons, and generally much more Valiant than the natural Perfuns. For the natural complexion of the Fcr- frm is not good, as may be feen by the Gaures^ the original Inhabitants of the Countcey, who are for themoft parttann’d, and ill-fhap’d. So that there is hardly a Perfian, from the King to the meaneft of his Subjects, who is not a Georgian^ or fprung from the loins of Georgians-* For they fetch a great number of Slaves out of Georgia y by the frequent Marriages of which women, the Georgian Valour and Beauty are become Natives oiPerfia. The Kanr or Governors of Provinces are as fo many petty Kings, fear’d and r^- fpedfed by all the people. And when they are fettl’d, they are never depos’d, but upon repeated complaints of their exceffive Tyranny. There are fome of thefe Governments that yield the Kan feven or eight thoufand Tomans. But they are bound to prefent the King every year at Nourons, or New-year-tide. Under the Kans there are alfo Governors of leffer quality, who are alfo im mediately preferred by the King, and cannot be depos’d by any perfon but him- felf. If they abufe their Authority, the complaints brought again!! him are firft earn’d to the Kan , which, if they concern the Government of the Kingdom, theiG/iis bound to inform the King thereof. But if the complaints are not confiderable, then the Kan may do Tuftice himfelf, and make the Sultans know their duty. There is yet a third fort of Governors, call’d Afephs, who are the King’s Lieu tenants in places where he had Kans in former times s or where he ought to have them ftill, but only to fave charges. For in the Provinces where Govern, they and their Officers, almoft equalling in name and number the Officers of the King’s Houfhold, devour all the profits of the Province, but what the Kan is ob lig’d annually to pay. By what l have wrote as well concerning the King’s Houfhold, the Governors °fhis Provinces, and the Officers of his Army, it may be eafily concluded that the King of Perfias Court is the moft magnificent and glorious of all the Courts tfAfia i and befides, that it is the moft Polite and Civil of all the Orient.Book V. The Persian Travels . CHAP. XI. Of thefecond Order, containing all that belong to the Ec. clejiaflical Law, and their Courts of Juflice; and, in general of all the Gown-men ; fuch as are chiefly the Officers of th t Chamber of Accounts. ' • - 1: ' \ o' ' /-': • i ' ' ■ ' . o'' .

As the Athmat-doulet is the Prime Minifter in Temporals, the&lt;Wreisfhe Prime Minifter in Spirituals, and the High-Prieft of the Law. However, he does not pretend to take place before the Athemat-doukt either in Council, or in the publick Ceremonies. There is this difference between the Sedre and the Muflm Turkey, that in Perfia, Ecclefiaftical Dignities are no bar from Civil Employments -, fo that the Sedre is many times made Athemat-douht. The Dignity of Sedre is not limited to one fingle perfon, but may be divided between two, in regard there are two forts of Legacies, the one from the /Cing's otPerfia, the other from particular perfons. Therefore for the more careful Supermtendency over thefe two forts of Legacies, there -are fometimes two St- dres appointed. The one is calfd particular or peculiar Sedre who manages all the Revenues of the Royal Foundations, and dtributes them to the Mullakf and Students according to their merit. The other is call’d Sedn-d-mm- kpufat, who has the management of private Foundations. In the year 1667 the King created two Sedres, and marri’d them to two of his Sifters. The Sedre has two men under him, whofe Authority is almoft equal to theirs. The one is call’d Sheil^el-felom, and the other Cadi: and thefe are they that decide all controverfies in Religion, judge of Divorces, make Confra&amp;s and publick Ads. Thefe two Dignities are in the King’s nomination: and in all the principal Cities of the Kingdom there are two of thefe Eccleftaftical Judges for all matters that concern the Law. To every Mofquee there belongs a Pichnamaz, who is always firft there before Prayers begin *, and he teaches the people to Pray by learning of him, having their eyes always fix’d upon him to that end. This Pickanmaz is the fame with him -whom the Turks call Iman, The Moult aids are the Dodors of the Law, as are the Hodgids in Turkey, and they are well paid out of the Legacies giv’n to the Mofquees, for reading every Friday, and interpreting the Alcoran to the people. He that reads, fits in one Chair j and he that interprets, in another, fornewhat lower upon the left-hand of the Reader. They are alfo bound to teach the Sci ences to all thofe that require it: And as a mark of Sandity, they wear agreat white Turbant, with a fingle Chamlet-habit of the fame colour. Their gate is grave, and their difcourfe very ferious j yet all this is but pure hypocrify. When they light into any confiderable company of people, they prefently rife, and ex hort em to go to Prayers. At the fame time they wafh their heads, their hands, and their feet, and fpread a felt upon the ground, or if they are poor, a fingle Upon this, at one end, the Maulla kneels, at the other lies a flat Stone about the bignefs of the palm of a man’s hand, which was brought from Mtca- Which Stones the Moullalds always carry about ’em j for being commanded while they are at their devotions often to kifs the ground, they rather choofe to kifs a Stone brought from fo holy a place, than the prophane Earth. They nave a kind of a Mariners compafs, which diredsthem pundually where Mecca ftands, to the end they may know which way to turn when they fay their Prayers# he Prayer which the M0»Z/&lt;at’s make, feems to be accompani’d with a grest deal of leal, and they take great notice all the while whether the company be atten tive or no. Some Perfians are fo fuperftitious, that a Vizir of Schiras fuffei’d his leg to rot off, becaufe he would not let a Chriftian Chirurgeon touch him, for of being defil’d. - , e Y * ThYChap. XL of Mon fieur Tavernier. There belongs alio to every Mofquee a Montevelf who looks alter the repairs of the Building, and the Provitlon of what belongs to the Mofquee'-, together with a Mouazen, who cries morning and evening from the fop of a Tower, That there if hut one God, andthat Mahomet if his Prophet, Colledges, the Perfians call Medrefe', where there are a great number of Scholars bred up at little charge, out ot the Legacies left to the Foundation*. They al low therma Chamber without any Furniture, they being to provide a Coverlet and a for themfelves, They have no certain Matters, but fometimes they go for their inftru&amp;ions to one, fometimes to another, feldom to the Princi pal of the Golledg, who is call’d Monderes, and is generally the greatett Block head of them all. But there arc feveral other perfons in every good City that are forward to teach the Sciences to purchafe honour to thcmfelves. For which reafon they are very liberal, to get a great company of Fol lowers together^ who areas fo many Trumpets to publitti the wifdom of their Akroom or Dodtor. But when their Liberality ceafes, the Trumpets want breath at the fame time. v Now as to their manner of ftudying, the Student firft reads two or three lines, and then the Dodfor Expounds. Then another reads two or three lines more, and fo one after another*, every one riling up out of refpedi after he has done reading, and (landing upright till the Dodfor bids him fit down again. One of thefe Do&amp;ors (hall teach all manner of Sciences in one day *, for he is not learned that cannot talk of all. And certainly had the Perfians thofe advantages of Books, and that method of ttudy which we have in Europe^ they would prove to be men of great underftanding: for with thofe little helps they have, they will give a good account of their owr&gt; Theology, of Logick, Phyfick, and the Mathematicks, wherein they ftrive to reach the bottom of things as deep ts they can. Their Books are for the moft part the works of an ancient Perfian Author, whole name was Kodgia Nefir in the City of Thoufs^ in the Province ot Korajfan, ' 'Tis very probable he was well skill’d in the Greekjind Arabic!^ having tranflated into ?er- fm feveral Books out of thofe two Languages. They have fome pieces of Ari- fiotle which are accounted thebeft in the Weft; The Altuageftes of Ptolemy, which they call Mageffi , fome tradfotes of Euclide, fome fragments of Archimedes : the Optickj of Ebne, Heifter, and other excellent Books. Some have affirm’d that they have been skill’d in the dodfrrin of Sines and Tangents tor above this 800 years; and indeed they are very curious at this day in MathematicalInttruments. They have alfo a great inclination to Poetry, the chief grace whereof they be lieve to confift in dei/gn of accidents, and high comparifons obfevving thime as we do. As for Phyfick, they have Galen, whom they call Gaknous *, Averroes, whom they call Aboualt, or great Father b and Hermes Trifmegifhts, whom' they call Or- The moft confiderable of their Hiftorians is Konze el Sapha, who wrot a Chronology from the Creation of the World to his time \ wherein there are abundance of fables, but little truth. He fays that the World was inhabited by Devils for an infinite number of years before the Creation of Adam, and that God for their enormities depriv’d them of their power upon earth, and give it to man to manage. Their Books, though deer,are very common, and every Trades-man buys ’em, being very ambitious to learn the Sciences themfelves, and to encou rage their children to do fo too. They fend them betimes to the School, which they call Meklebe, oi which there are feveral in every Quarter. They make a hideous noife in their Schools, repeating their Leffons alltogether aloud, while the Mailer corredb every Boy that does not keep along with the Cry. As for the children of perfons of Quality, they have Tutors at home, never ftirring out of doors till they are 18 years of age, unlefs it be to go a hunting or a (hoot ing now and then. Hence it comes to pafs, that the Children are difcrcet, civil and modeft ^ fo that you (hall never hear an ill word come out of their mouths. In the Chamber of Accounts are many Officers, whom I look upon as Gown- tnen. All the Books and Regifters pafs through their hands, particularly fuch Pa pers as concern d the King’s Revenue. All which are regifter’d in the Chamber of Accounts at IJpahan, which is call’d Defter Krone. As to the Fee-Lands call’d Moulhgrbar, which belong to particular perfons, they owe to the King a certain E e annualThe Persian Travels Book V. annual Rent, which the Governors of Provinces exad with a revere on. The Meftempti and the Mcmalecl^ are they that value the Rent of a]} La rl in Demeft], which is one of the principal charges of the Defter Kroon. Th S alfo take cognifance of all the King’s Farns, Quit.Pvents, Provifions and pences of Receivers and Colle&amp;ors. There'is alfo a Mefcmpti to value Le X ' cies. The Nazar controuls the Meftempti and the Memalek, and his hand is r«im &gt;j to all Papers of difpatch. M »u The Veroga or Provoft of the Defier-Kroon is to profecute and puni(h all that are guilty of falfe Receipts, or of Exadion. Into this Office are deliver’d all the Grants and Aflignations of the wages of the King’s Officers. Every man comes and receives his own, or fends for it to thofe places upon which this Money is aflign’d. In every Village or Borough there is a Rei/, or chief of the place, to whom the Officers apply themfelves for their Money : For (hould they terrify the Countrey-man, he would run quite away, and pay nothing. The greateft cheat in this Chamber of Accounts, is, that in regard the Officers keep the Roll of the Officers wages, they will give them divers Bills to receive little parcels at feveral places diflant from one another, till the Sum be made up to which trouble rather than the Kings fervant will be put, he will give a good gratuity to the Officer topay him all together. But becaufe the Officers are not able to fatisfy all that come there are certain Tbabfilders or hoarders up of Rent, who buy for ready Money as^heap • as they can, fuch Bills as private men come to receive at the Chamber * and when they have got a good number together, they go and receive them altogether at the Chamber, and make great advantage. By this mifgovernment of the Defter- Kroom, feveral perfons are very much oppreft. For he that has but 30 Tomm a year, fhall be forc’d to give a good (hare out of it to have the reft in ready Mo ney j which has been often the mine of the Perfian Army, through the abufes and defalcations put upon the poor Souldiers. During the Reign of Sha-Abbas the 1 i and toward the beginning of the Reign of Sha-Sefi his Son, the Exche quer was better regulated i but when the Perfians come to be at Peace with their Neighbours, the King and his Lords have minded nothing lefs then the payment of the Souldiery. r ; The greateft part of the Lands in Perfia belong to the King, and are only farm’d by private perfons. The reft of the Lands are meafur’d, and every Land pays fo much ameafure. The King alfo has a vaft income by the Merchandizes that pay Guftom and Toll. The Port of Bander Ahafft alone brings him one year with another, when leaft, befides accidents, neer upon 20000 Tomans. &lt; CHAP,Chap. XiL of Monfieur Tavernier, CHAP. XII. , Of the third Eftate of the Kingdom, comprehending the Tradef- men and Merchants : as dip of the Trades,MamtfaRures, and Commodities o/Perfia. T He Commerce of Perjia, as in all other Kingdoms, confifts in the Trade of the Country and Forraign Traffick. Only with difference, that the Country Trade is in the hands of the Perftans and the forraign Traffic in the hands of the Armenians only, who are as it were the Kings and the Noble mens Fa ctors to fell their (ilk. As for the Handicraft trades, there are fome Corporations that pay a certain yearly duty to the King, as Shoemakers, Cutlers, Smiths, and others. Some are free, as the Joyners and Mafons *, though he get by their labour as much as others pay him in money. For When the King requires twenty Mafons for a work which is in haft, the Mamar Bajhi who is their Chief, fummons them together, and they that gave moft are excused. For when the King requires twenty, he fummons forty: and thus every man lives by his calling. The practice is the fame with the Chief of the Joyners, and all other Trades, who are Officers pay’d by the King, and never work unlefs they pleafe themfelves, commanding all that are under their Jurifdi&amp;ion. As for Carpenters and Joyners workpthe Perfians know little what belongs to it, which proceeds from the fcarcity of Wood, that, does not afipw them materials to work upon. So that for Chains, Tables and Bedfteads, there: are no fuch things to be feen in Perfia: the Joyners bulinefs being only to make Doors and Frames for Windows, which they make very neatly of feveral pieces of wood joyn’d together, fo thata man can hardly put a Tennis Ball through the holes where they put the glafs. Nor can it be expe&amp;ed that the Perfians fhould work like other Europeans^ having no other Tools then a Hatcjiet, a Saw, and a Chizzel, and one fort of Plainer, which a French-man brought among them. Their nobler Arts are Writing, for Printers they know none. All their Books are writt’n, which is the reafon they fo much efteem that Art. Thqre was an Armenian who had fet up a Printing-Prefsat Ifpahan^ and had Printed the Epifiles of St. Pauf the feven Penitential Pfalms, and was going about to Print the whole Bible, but not having the way of making good Ink, and to avoid the ill confequen- ces of the Invention, he was forc’d to break his Prefs. For on the one fide the Children refus’d to learn to write,pretending they wrote the Bible themfelves, on ly to get it the fooner by heart; on the other fide many perfons were undone by it, that got their living by writing. The Perfians ufe three fortsofhands, the firft is call’d Neflalic^ot the Set hand, the fecond Sbatyfle or Vivanni, which is their Court-hand: the third Neskre, or the Running-hand, very like the Arabic. They write with fmall Indian Reeds* and fay, that to write well, a man ought to lean fo Rightly upon his Pen,that fhould a fly ftand upon the other end it would fall out of his hand. When they write they hold their Paper in one hand to turn it according to the motion of the Pen, other- wife they could not make their dafhes large and free, as the Chara£ter requires. They make their Paper of Cotton Fuftian, very courfe, brown, and of no ftrength, for the leaft folding tears it. They lleek it with a fleek ftone, and then rub it over to make it more fleek. Their Ink is made of Galls and Charcoal pounded together with Soot. The reek’n four Languages among’em. The Peryiaw call’d that js, fweet and pleating. The Tptrkjfh^ call’d Sciafcet, or the Rodomontado Language. 1 he to which they give the Epithite of or Eloquent: and the fourth, call’d Cobabet, or th£ Speech of the Country people. The Perfian in ufe among the Gentry is compos’d almoft of all Arabic words: by reafon that the erftan is very barren. But the Gibbrilh of the Country people is fo corrupt that J ey in the City can hardly underftand ’em. The Arabian is the Language of the earned, in which tongue their Books are written. The Language of the Couit E e 2 is ,The Persian Travels Book V. ts but much more (oft and elegant then at Conti ant innple. As fo r th Terfian Language, it is fpoken in the Courts of the Great Mogul, and the Kings f Golconda mA Vifapour, in all which Courts a Noble man would take it for an af front to be fpok’n to in the Indian Language. As for their Painters they only paint in miniature, and for Birds and Flow tfhey will draw them indifferently: But for figures and ftories they know not what belongs to any fuch thing. The Pcrjians are moft excellent Artiftsfor manufa^ures of Gold, Silk and Silver of which their rich Carpets and Tiffues are made: nor do their Gold and Sih^ Manufactures ever.grow black or lofe their luher by long wearing or lying by 1 There are abundance that work in Silk huffs of all forts, and others that mak Bonnets and Girdles of Gold and Silk. Others there are whofe bufinefs it is to fafffn flowers of Gold and Silver to their Taffata’s, with gum water, of which fheWomen make Shifts and Drawers. And now they begin to make fuch large quantities of Taffata’s, that they care not for the huffs which are brought nnf nf India, though they be much finer. T/hey alfo make great quantities of Linnen Cloth of all forts of colours upon which they faffn feveral flowers with gum water, and Lome figures, though the Law forbid it. Which they learnt to do upon the Armenians carrying out of£a- rofe fdme ifl*favour’d cuts and pieces in diltemper which they bought here without judgment: thefe pieces they hang before their doors, and thofe hollow places in the walls where they put their Quilts and Carpets when they rife. The Persians are excellent Artifts at Damafquing with Vitriol, or engraving Da mask-wife upon Swords, Knives, and the like. But the nature of the Steel which they make ufe of, very much contributes to their Art, in regard they cannot fief form the fame work neither upon their own nor ours.This fled is brought from GJtcondai and is the only fort of fled which can be damafqu’d.

The Perfian, are alfo excellent Artifts at making Bows and Arrows, and fuch other weapons as are us’d in that Country, As for Bridles and Sadies their At- nils far exceed outs, efpecially in their fowing, which they do fo neatly and withfo much art with a kind of back-flitch, that it looks almoft like an embroiderv.There are an infinite number that live by dreffing Seal-skins and Goat skins, the firft to boots for the Gentry and better fort of Merchants, the latter for the poor 1 a,f ° a fort earthen ware made at Kerman which is very fine,andbe- ing brok n looks as white within as without.

Not but that the Officers of Juflice are eafie to be corrupted^ but in their un juft exa&amp;ions, which they carry as fecretly as poffibly they can, they are fooner fatisfi’d then the lurks : and if their injuftice be difeover’d, upon complaint to the King they are pumlht without mercy. . . . r The Kans do Juftice in their Provinces, as reprefentmg the Kings perlon. Be- fides that, the King has a Vivan Begui in every City, and the places under him a T)trooa i who is like the Lieutenant Criminal in France. He has under him an A at as &gt; who is a kind of Captain of the watch 5 who goes about the ftreetsin the ni&amp;ht to hinder diforders, and carries all people to Prifon that he finds abroad at b alfo a Kdonter, that is, thechiefeftoi greateft, whofeems to tefemble the Tri bune of the People among the Romans, or the Provoft of Merchants in ftmet. The Kelmer is only refponiible to the King, who places one in every City, and it k his bufinefsto defend the People from the injuftice and oppreffions of the Go- vernours. f- : Murther is feverely punifh’d, nor will money fave the Criminal. When the Murtherer is takn, they carry him before the Divan Begui, who makes quick work. For he delivers him to the Parents or kindred of the perfon (lain, who carry him to the place of execution, and without any compaffion torture him to death. , I remember the Kan of Schiras had a Favourite, who falling in love with a young Perfian Gentleman, would needs endeavour to have the ufe of his body. One day meeting upon the Road together, and lying at night under the fame Tent* the Favourite about midnight came to his bed fide, and after many follicitations would have forc’d him. But being violently refifted, the Favourite for madnefs to fee him difappointed, and liable to be difeover’d, fiabb’d the young Gentle man to the heart, and fled to the Mountains.' The Murther being divulg’d, the Mother, Widow and Sifter of the young man repair’d to the Kan for Juftice, who willing to fave his Minion, offer’d them money : but they fcorning his proffer, threaten’d to complain to the King. The Kan being thereupon cooftraind to pur- fue his Favourite, at length took him and fent him to Ifpahan, telling them that he would not judge of the Affair^ but refer it to the King. The Mother, Widow and Sifter immediately follow’d the Murtherer to Jfpaban ? and demanded Juftice of the King with that eagernefs, that though the King had an inclination to have (par’d the Kan’* Favourite for his Mafters fake, he was forc’d to abandon him, and to bid them pay themfelves with his blood. Immediately he wascairi’dto the where the Widow firft ftabb’d him to the heart with a Dagger, then the Mother took her turn, and after the Sifter iand then holding a Cup to receive his blood, drank every one a cup full to quench the thirft of their revenge. Nor are they fb exaft in the punifhmentof Murther only s for they punifhdu' orders in houfes of Debauchery with a proportionable ftri&amp;nds, of which 1 will give the Reader two examples. A young Hollander, coming to Ifpahan, prefently put himfelfinto a Perfianhzbit-, and going in the evening to a houfeofgoodtel' lowfhip, met with certain Perfians, with whom he happen’d to quarrel, and being well beaten for his pains, thought it not convenient to ftay any longer where he had bin fb ill entertain’d. Thereupon the Dutch Interpreter went and complain d to the Atbemadoulet, who inform’d the King. The King immediately fent for the people that had beaten the Hollander, and ask’d them why they abus’d a ftranget. To v/hich the others made anfwer that they faw no ftranger, but only a man da unfeafonable hours, ff they cannot give a good accompt of themfelves. There after tbt Perfian garb.

The KiW in form’d of it, commanded the Mother to be thrown headlong from a Tower fand that the Daughter (hould be torn a pieces by his doggs, which he keeps, a purpofe for fuch chaftifements. r Above all things there is an extraordinary care taken for the fecurity of the High-ways. For which purpofe guards are fet at convenient diftances, who are ready to purfue upon the leaft noife of a Robbery, and who examin people whence they comeand whither they go. If they anfwer not as they fhould,or trip in theit Anfwers, tjiey carry them before the next Governor. Thofe Radars are fo pofied over all Perfia, that you need no more then fend to the places where they keep ftation, to know what is become of any perfon that has committed a crime. For it is impolfible to fcape, all the Pafles are fo well guarded.

In a ffiort time the Thief was conflrain’d to forfake his Cloak-bag and tocome a thwart the fields for water. Who being examin'd by the Radars why he came alone by fuch a by way, and not knowing what to anfwer was earn’d to the Governour. He was foon convided and condemn’d to death* for Thieves find no mercy in Verfia. Only they are varloufly put fo death. For fometimes they are ty’d to a Camels tayl by the feet, and their bellies rip’t open. Sometimes they are buried alive all but their heads, and ftarvM to death : in which to? merit they will fometimes defire a PafTenger to cut off their heads i though it be a kindnefs forbidden by the Eaw. But the moft cruel punifhmentof all, is when they fet Thief a Horfe-back, with his extended Arms fatten’d to a long flick behind: then larding him with lighted Candles, they fuffer the Candles to bum imp his very bowels. Another and I met two in this mifery, who defil’d us to batten their deaths, which we durft not da, only we gave them a Pipe of Tobacco according to their defire. As for thofe that tteal in Cities, they tye them by the heels to'the tayl of a Ca mel, and rip up their bellies: and then as the Camel drags the poor creature along the ftreets, while one goes before him crying, The King has pmiflfd him for fuch a crime. If yet he be not dead, they hang him upon the next tree. The Radars have little wages, which makes them ufe their Rhetorick to get what honeiily they can out of the Travellers, to whom they tell long ftories of their care for the fecurity of the highways. If it happen that a Merchant be rob’d, the Governour of the Province is to, make good to the Merchant whatever he has loft, according as he (hall make out by his Oath or his Book. Nor dare the Governors deny fatisfa&lt;ttion, fearing a complaint at Ifpahan. I my felf was rob’d of two Bales of goods, between Lar and Schiraf, to the value of 1400 Piafters, but upon complaint to the Governour upon my own oath and (hewing him my Book, he pay’d me all my lofs In gold, and gave me a prefent in wine betides. The Potts or Shappars are thofe that carry the Kings difpatches to the Gover- nours of Provinces.

If thefe Curriers meet a Horfeman upon the road, they have power to dif- mount him, if their own be not fo good, or be tyi’d; and the Horfeman ipuft ei ther run after his Horfe, or fend feme body to the end of the Stage.

For there is a Mobtefib, who is the chief of the Government, whofe bufinefs it is to fet a rate upon all forts of Provilion, being aflilted by three or four more Affeffors. Every firft day of the week there is a publick Proclamation of tax upon the weight of every thing. Which Affeffors in the evening advife together again!! the next day whether to raife or abate the price before fet. This order was eila- bliih’d by the great Shi-Abbx, and was in his reign more pun&amp;ually obferv’d then it has been fince. By the by obferve, that all provihons of belly-timber are fold by weight and not by meafure : fo that you may fend a Child to Market; for if the Commodity be not weight, ’tis-well if the buyer be fatisfy’d with having his money again- For if the feller be difeover'd to fell by falfe weights, they are led about the ftreets with a or aBonnet like a Bee-hive upon their heads, and a Bell about their necks to expofe ’em firft to the laughter of the people; alter that they are fin’d, and receive fo many drubs upon the foies of their feet* ~ If this good order were not obferv’d in Verfia, the poor would fuffer very much. For the handicraft tradefmen that work all day in (hops remote from their houfes, where their wives are continually (hut up, eat nothing at noon but a little fruitin fealbn : and then in the evening when they leave work, they go to the Market and buy for their Families boyl’d or roaft meat, of which there is great plenty.

To whom the Kan made anfwer, that ’twas not his bufinefs to alter the price: bidding him go to the Magiftrate that was concern’d. But the Baker belie ving the Kan could do any thing, fent him a prefent of fifty Tomans. The Kan feeing the ill defign of the Baker to opprefs the poor people, and the ill opinion he had of him as a feller of Juft ice, commanded him to be carri’d to the Piazza, ind there to be drub'd upon the foies of his feet till he pay’d the other fifty Tomans, which the Kan forthwith diftributed to the poor, and caus’d the price ofbread to be abated inftead of railing it. i CHAP.

The Perfians never preferve the name of their Predeceffors, bkt like the Jews, for diftin&amp;ion fake, (ay» fuch a one, the Son of fuch a one. When they Circumcife a Child and give him a Name, they write three or four Names like Lots in Paper, which are drawn by a Child, and which the Child draws, that is the Name of the Child. The women that are barren, fwallow that which is cut from the Child, believing it will make them conceive. The Perfians are generally very inquifitive after the time to come, confultwg their Aftrologers like Oracles: The King has always two or three by him, to tell him the good or bad hour. There is an Almanac which is fold every year in IV fia, which they call Tacuim \ but is indeed an Ephemerides, containing the Longi tudes and Latitudes of the Planets, the Conjunctions and Oppofitions ? and other fuch things. This Tacuim is full of predictions about War, Sicknefs and Famin. Itfctsthe proper feafons to-put on new cloathes, to let blood, to Purge, or tra vel, with many other inftru&amp;ions of the fame nature.

The Perjians are naturally great Diffemblers and Flatterers *, and they make it their ftudy to acquire efteem and applaufe. They love to give and receive Pre- fenfs: more efpecially to prefent the King.

After feme few Compliments, they get a Horfeback&gt; attended by all their Vifitants, who accompany them\o the King’s Houfe, in expe&amp;afion offome kindnefs, by vertue of their favour. Tj le favours which the King ufually does to fuch people, is to fend them to the Gover- nours of Provinces with a Hawk or a Calaat, with order ftat thefaid Governours remember the Serjeant Porter. The Kan being advertiz'd that the Calaat is coming, he rides forth of the City to meet it ? attended by all his principal Officers, the chief of the City, and the greateh part of the Inhabitants. . The Juglers alfo mull give their attendance to gether with the Drums and Trumpets, and all the Mufick-makers. They rendez- vouz ufually in a Garden one or twd leagues from the City, where the King’s Mef- fenger Hays with the Calaat. So foon as the Governour perceives him, he makes a low obeyfance, and a Prayer for the King s giving God thanks for that the King is pleas’d to preferve him in his memory: then he puts on the Calaat^ which is according to the quality of the Governour: fometimes the Pu)be alone i fome- times Pvobe and Cloak: fometimes Robe, Cloak, Girdle, and Bonnet •, to which if he be a Grandee, are added the Scimitar and Dagger: which method is alfo obferv’d toward EmbafTadors. When the Kan has put on the Calaat , he returns to the City with all his Retinue, goes to the King's Houfe j fot the King has a Houfe in every City,) kilfes the Columns of the Gate, and makes certain other Prayers for the profperity of the King; At length he rides home, where he makes a great Feaft, (hewing the Calaat to all perfons that come to him, who byway of complement cry Moubarel^bajhet, that is, may it be bled, and prove a good omen. The Perfians are not much addi&amp;ed to play: fpr befides, that the Law forbids it s the Mejhaldar*Bajhi has a power to fine and puniffi Gamefters, as I have faid already. For which reafon he has fpies, to which the meaner fort of people date not refufe entrance into their Houfes: but the richer fort laugh at 'em y and will give ’em nothing. Among the Games, there is one game at Cards which the Per(ians call Gengefe. We have but four diftinft marks upon ours, but they have eight. They alfo play at a kind of Chefs,and at Trifirac y which t woGames arc moft in ufe. The Shopkeepers play in the Streets with little Marbel-bowls,' not much unlike our Childrens Bowling Hones. But as for Bowling-greens, or Tennis-Courts, they know not what they mean. Neither the Perftans nor any of the EaHern People accuHom themfelves to Walk as we do. And therefore when they fee us walking to and fro together ina Garden-Ally fortwoor three hours together, they are amaz’d. They only fpread a Carpet in the faireft place of the Garden, and fet themfelves down to contem plate the verdure of the place ; and if they rife, 'tis only to pull the fruit from the trees, for they love to eat what they gather themfelves, never caring for what others have handl’d. The Men never dance, only the Women of Pleafure, which are always fentfor to their FeaHs y where they dance opeo-fac’d, and fhew a thoufand poHures to di- verdfethe Company. Their jugkrs are every jot as good as ours y but whereas ours make ufe of Balls, they ffiew their tricks with Urge Hen-eggs. Their Dancers upon the Ropes far exceed ours. I have feen Tome of them that have ty’d a Rope to the top of a high Tower, and fatten'd the other to the ground, and then vvalk- mg up to the top with their counterpoifes in their hands, have laid themlelves up on the Rope upon their backs, and have ilid to the bottom with a fwiftnefs like lightning. The Perfians are altogether as fuperHitious as the Turkj. Before they fay their Prayers they are oblig d to wafh : every one having a Refervatory for water in his own Houfe, which is always full of water. They plunge their heads in the water, warn their mouths, rub their foreheads yand if a man ffiews themany nalii- nt sin the Vefiel, there's water enough, they cry, for puriheationy though, if it rriU ^ k e £° ur or bve foot deep. But if it be Running-water, e eaH quantity in the World ferves to purify ’em, and render ’em fit to pray: while they ground their belief upon this maxim of the Mahomet, that if if ou run through Pijhkjll^ or Camels-dung, it would be fufficient for purification, ere is one fort of walhing appointed by their Law, which is, to go to their BathsChap- XVI- of Monfieur Tave r ni er. Baths after they have been with their Wives j and there are fotnfe fo fnperftitious ag to go there every day. Thefe Baths are round Chambers, fo clofe, that there i-s no light, but what comes from little round windows made in the top of the roof. In the firft place, there is the Krafine,. which is a Chamber (even or eight foot fquare •, where, in the middle of the Room, is agreat Copper plate, in the form of a flat Bifon, and underneath they make a lire of Brufhes or Horfe-dung : fo that the Plate heats all the water which is in the Chamber ; When it is hot enough, a fervant belonging to the Bath goes up to the Terras, arid winds a horn, to give notice to them that have a mind to come. Should a Perfian or a Maho metan mik once in eight days, he would fed an itching all over his body not to be endui’d. For the pores, which the heat of the Bath had open’d, coming to be Ihut, the vapours of the body not able to get out, prick and tickle the skin. The Men go early in the morning, and hay till two hours after Sun-riling; At theen- &lt; try of the Bath is the place where they undrefs-, and when they are ftript all but the fecret parts, which they cover with a napkin, they pour hot water upon their (boulders: and then comes a man and rubs off all the fweat and lilth of the Body with a coarfe Cloath j after which they plunge themfelves into aRefervato- ryof hot water, which they call Kolletain. But thefe common Baths are very dangerous, and many people of both Sexes have got the foul Difeafe, who were never addi&amp;ed to impurity. There are alfo in Perfia hir’d people, which they call Sakas^ whole buGnefsit is to give water to the people as they go along the Streets. Their Barbers are very neat, and furpafs ours for lightnefs of hand * for a man Cm hardly feel their Ra te. They have alfo a Knife to pare the nails of the hands and feet, which they do very dextroufly. As for their Beards, thofe that belong to the Law cut it with Seiflers, but they leave it not fo long as the Turkf do, by much. But the Courtiers and Souldlers (have all off, except from their upper-lips, where they take it for a mark of great honour to wear long Mojiaches^ which they fay is the ornament of the face. The habit of the Perfianris z Robe which they call that comes down a little below their knees. This is of very fine quilted Cloath* well cotton’d in the Winter, but much thinner in the Summer. Thefe Linnens would be very cheap, but that the Perfons of Quality change their Robes' every day. Their Sleeves are lopg, and clofe to their arms, and reaching as far as the wrift. The Robe is fit to their-Bodies as far as the Waft i but then it is made wide and loofe* Over this they wear a poble Girdle of Silk, adorn’d at the end with flowers of Gold, over which they wear another Girdle of fine Kerman wool. The richer fort are fo vain as to wear three Girdles, two of Silk, and one of Kerman-wool) which is ty’d uppermoft. Under the Robe or Vaft they wear a (hort Waftcoat of flowed Fuftion quilted, their Shirts being of Silk of divers colours. They ule as little Soap in Perfia as they can f for Soap is very rare in Perfia. When we come out of the Indies^ we are forc’d to bring with us Linnen enough to ferve us for fix months, and then carry it back again i for they wafh much better in In dia then in Perfia. Their breeches being of Silk, come down to their Ankles, without any codpieces. Their Sejfe, or Bonnet, which we call a furhan^ is made of a piece of fine Silk mingl’d with Gold, being in form much like our large Pompions: the top thereof is a little flat •, and here it is that the end of the Silk being garnKh’d with flowers of Gold and Silver, ends in a kind of Pofie. Thefe Bonnets are very heavy, efpecially thofe that are for the moft part nothing but Gold and Silver. The meaneft of thofe is worth 200 Crowns 5 but there are fome which the King and the great Lords wear, that are worth four or five hundred. You fhajl ftldom meet an Officer of any Quality thatdoes not wear a rich Jewel in his Bonnet. The Courtiers and Souldiery wear their Daggars upon their ftomachs, ftuck in their girdles. The meaneft Sculdier inlays the handle and (heath of his Dagger 5 but the Grandees have them all befet with Pearls. There was in the handle of Sha-Abhns the Second’s Dagger, a Diamond of above fixty Carats, which, with fome other Stones that belong’d to it, was valu’d at 13000 Tomans^ or 200000 Crowns. Over their Veft they wear a juftieoar, much like fcurs. It is faften’d at the top with a button : and moft ufually they have nine tufted buttons before fet by three and three at an equal diftance : but they only .' F f 2 ferveThe Persian Travels Book V. fcivc for ornament. This Julticoar is either of Gloathj or Tiflue ? which in Win ter is lin’d with Martins, or elfe with a grey Lambskin that comes from Korafan. And indeed the Per pans love diverfity of colours in their habits: for their Jufti COi ’ is of one colour, their Veft ofanother, their Breeches of another * and their Shooes, efpccially the Womens are green, red, yellow, or violet. The Girdle and Turban are always of ftrip’d Stuff, unlefs it be the Moulhtfs, which are always plain. Befides all this, in the Winter they wear along Cloak down to their heels, with fleeves of the fame length, lin’d with rich Furs. The Perfons of Quality, and fome of the meaner fort of people make no more of Cloath of Gold and Silver, then we do of Druggets. A man that has but feven or eight Tomans a year,(hall fpend five in Cloaths i which excefs in habit is crept down among the Rabble,fo that a man can hardly tell the Servant from the Mafter. And it is a Proverb among the Verftans, Corbebe Lebat, fine Cloaths make Men efteem’d at Court. Neither Sha-Abbas the Second, nor his Grandfather Sha-Abbas the Firft, would allow of this diforder, but that Men ftiould go clad according to their conditions. For one day, feeing one of his Servants with a pair of Cloath of Gold-breeches, deman ded what wages he had.? but when he underftood that it was nothingneer fufficient to maintain him at that rate i fo deter others from the like vanity, he order’d him fo many Bajlinadoes upon the foies of his feet, that he dy’d in a few days* Others fay that the Fellow being fur priz’d at the King’s Queftion, made him anfwer, that being troubl’d with the Gout, he had been advis’d to wear that fort of Stuff for its warmth. To which the King reply’d, that he had been told a very bad remedy, and that he would ftiew him a better and a (horter way to cure the Gout, and fo commanded him to be drubb’d,, as before is rela ted. In regard it is very cold in Per ft ay they make ufe of three forts of Furs. The Lamb and Fox’s skin for the meaner fort, together with the Cat’s and Fox’s skin. But the third fort, which is the Martin's Fur, is for Grandees of the Court, and other Pqfons of high Quality. They have alfo a way to make Caffocks that will keep out the rain, the wind, and the cold, which are made of Keman-wod, as our Felt-makers make their Hats. And now I have faid ’tis cold, give me leave to tell ye how they warm them- felves. In all Houfes there are little Chambers, in the middle whereof there is a fquare hole about a foot deep, and three or four foot long, according to the bignefs of the Chamber. Over the hole is a thing like one of our Tabourets, which covers the hole with a large Carpet, to keep in the heat of that which is kindl’d in the hole i fo that being plac’d under the Tabouret as far as the waft, though as cold as ice before, in a minute you (hall be almoft in a fweat, and be ready to fall a-fleep, if you take not a great care. All the Nobility have Cham bers with Chimneys, where they fet the Wood upright the Mantle-tree comes forward, low, and femi-drcular. It is two or three foot deep, and as many wide, to avoid fmoaking. They are full of their Compliments, which they call Travezea: and their man ner of falutation is quite diiferent from ours. For they never uncover their heads, but bow, and lay their right-hand upon their bretts. When they come into the company of their Betters, they fall upon their knees to fet themfdves upon their heels, which is a mark of refped. The Wdmen in Perfia are very richly habited &gt; but their habit is all of a piece, though little different in (hape from the Mens. It is open before and comes not down below the calf of the leg. Their Girdle is not ty’d fait, but hangs carelefly: their Sleeves are alfo clofe to their arms, and reach to their wrifts. Upon thdr heads they wear a little Bonnet rais’d like a little fpire, and adorn’d with precious Stones, according to their Quality * from which' Bonnet falls a veil behind, which is very graceful. They wear Breeches like the men, and their Shooes are almofi like theirs. The Women oi Omus wear only a (in gle pair of Breeches with a (hift over them. The Armenian Women wear befides, a little Jufticoar without Reeves, and upon their heads, a fine Linnen- Coif ty’d under their chins. Their hair is gather’d into a long trefs, to which they fometimes add more, which is falfe, to make a long lock, that is doneChap- XV. of Monfieur Tavernier. up in a Velvet or Sattin-Cafe embroider’d* and hangs behind down to the waft. / Handfome Women are very plentiful in Perfia^zs well the tawny as the white. For the Merchants that bring both from all parts, choofe the handfomeft they can pick out. The white Women are brought from Mufcovia, Poland, Ciraffia, Mengrelia, Georgia, and the Frontiers of Tartary. The black from the coaft of Melinda, and the Red-Sea. The Perfian Women are feen by none but their own Husbands. They are very idle in their Houfes, not fo much as looking after any thing of Houfewifery. In deed every thing is at the Husband’s difpofal, fo that the Women are rather Slaves 1 then Wives. They fpend their time in taking Tobacco, after feveral fafhtons. When they go to the Baths, (he’s the Woman that wears the beft Clothes, and brings the bell Collation. They that have.Slaves, caufe ’em to rub their arms, their legs, and their thighs, till they fall alleep i having no other divertifementin their voluptuous Prifon. The higher a man is, in dignity, the more he glories in having a great number of Wives and Slaves *, and his abfolute power keeps them in order either willingly, or by conftraint. There are two forts of Eunuchs for the guard of the Sultaneffes and the Wives of the Nobility : Some are white, but they never come neer the Women, but are order’d to guard the firft doors of the Haram. The others are black, frightful to look upon, and flat-nos’d: who attend only upon the Women. If there be a neceflity.for a Woman of Quality to go abroad, the Eunuchs go before and be hind with Battoons in their hands, to make the Corrou\, and drive all the people out of the way. When the King goes into the Countrey, if any one be afleep in the high*way, and be perceiv’d before he wakens, he is immediately cut to pieces as belies. In the time of Sba-Abbot the Second, one of the Fellows that help’d to fet up the Womens Tents, being weary, fell afleep in one of them upon the ground. When the Women came, they, feeing a man afleep, fet up a fhriekingi upon which, the Eunuchs coming in, wrapt up the Fellow in the Carpet as he lay, and carrying him into t]*e Fields, buried him alive. Carpet and all. V CHAP. XV.

Which, it may be, proceeds from their (having fo young, and fo often: for they (have at five or fix months old, and two or three times a week. As to the Pox, the Perfians would be more troubl’d with it, but that the dry Air of the Gountrey is an enemy to it: betides, they never lye twice with the fame Worpan, without going to the Bath to fweat out the venom of that diftemper. As for the Gout s or Gravel, the Perfiant know not what it means: But the menians are troubl’d with the latter, efpecially thofe that in their youth accuftom’d themfelves to drink more Wine then Water.

Vyfentery, they take Tower GurdlM-cnilk, with Rice unbruisM boyl’d in water, to which they add a little Rhubarb powder’d. At the beginning of a Difeafe they forbid Bread, and inftead thereof preferibe Rice boyl’d in Hen-broath, or fometimes in fair water. For diet is the chief Re medy which the Phyfitians preferibe in all DifeaTes, and account moft foveraign. Indeed the remedy is well preferib’d in many diftennpers-, however it is by them' never preferib’d according to reafon or method, but only according to cuftom; whereby it often comes to pafs that they forbid that which is good, and preferitje that which is bad. If the Patient be To poor as not to be able to fend for a Phylitian, two or three men fet him upon an Afs, with a Scarf about his neck, which denotes him to be a Tick perfon, and fo lead him to the Phyfitian •, who prefently feels his pulfe, lets him Blood, and by and by taking his Pen in his hand, in a fmall piece of Paper preferibes more Hog-wafh at one ftroke, then three mens bellys are able to contain. When a Phyfitian is call’d to a Confultation,he pretends not to take any Money: But his Atar or Apothecary finds a way to have the Do&amp;or fatisfi’d for his pains. They never permit the Sick to change their Linnen, how nafty foever it be. When they come home to the Patient, though they find him ready to expire, they tell the Servants that he will certainly recovery but then, on the other fide, they go to the Parents or Kindred of the Patient, and tell them that the Patient is in a defperate condition, and caonot live. By this means they fave their credit i for Of the divifion of time amongthe Perfians. HE Perfians divide the natural day into four parts. The firft is from Sun- rifing to Noon s the Second from Noon to Sun-fet: The third from Sun-fet till Midnight j and the fourth from Midnight till Sun-rife. At Midnight, Morning, and Sun-fet, they make a moft horrible din in every great City, of Kettle-Drums, Haut-boys, Latten-Bafbns, and other Inftruments .* upon which there are certain men hir'd to play for a quarter of an hour together, in fome place where they may be heard all over the City. They have alfo great Cornets, about fevenfoot long, with deep mouths, which may be heard above half a league. But thefe Cornets are never us’d but in Cities where the Kans or Governours refide. Thefe Inftruments are alfo always employ’d at their great Solemnities, asalfo when the King creates any new Officer or Governour. Thefe Inftruments have alfo a pri- viledg to play at all Houfes where they underftand there is a Male-child born. The meaner fort dare not refufe ’em , but the Nobility value not their priviledg of aftraw. The Perfians in the computation of time make ufe of Lunar-months.

The hrli month, Ferverdin, begins with the Vernal Equinox, every month not containing above 30 days, ad ding the five which remain to the end of the year, which they call Kramfi Movjie- relze. . # ^ v The day of the Vernal Equinox is the firft day of the year, which they call Neo- zoiize, and is one of their Principal Feltiyals. For that day all the Grandees ap pear at Court, and prefent the King according to their quality. If they can meet with nothing that is rare, they prefent him in Ducats of Gold, and there are fome that prefent him to the number of ten Thoufand. They alfo give God thanks fo'rprefcrving them to fee the new year, and for preferving the fruits of the Earth from bad feafons, for the Corn is by that time well come up.Upon thisfirft day of the year, if a Perfian has not money to buy him a new habit, he will go and mort gage his own body to have one. So proud and luxurious are the Perfians from the higheft to the lowell. C H A P. XVII. Of the Feafis and ordinary Diet Perfians. T He Perfians are nothing eager after delicacies or dainties *, both the nobler and the meaner (ort being very temperate in dyet. In regard that wood is fo fcarce and dear about Ifpahan, they never eat boyl’d meat above onee a day : and as for their Dinner which they call Shate, it confifts of bread, cheelfe-curds, milk, burnt wine, melons and other fruits in feafon, to which the rich add wet and dry fweet-meats: At night their ufual food is Pilaw and roft meat. They buy their Provifion from hand to mouth, efpecially the Mabumetans, which is a double charge. But for the Armenians, they live thriftily, and buy at once a good quan tity of provifions to laft for fo long time. Muttons, Kidds, Pullefs and Pidgeons, are the ufual dyet of the fot as for Beef they very rarely eat it. The King and the great Lords will eat a piece of a Hare fomeumes when they have been a hunting: but when they have kill’d a wild Boar, they fend it always to IbmeGhriftian, in expectation to be prefented for the honour done him. They have no diveylity ofVi&amp;uals or made Difhesin Perfta, their dyet being more proper to fatisfie .hunger, thentopleafe a nice palate- Mutton and Lamb would be very good in Perjia, if they knew how to road it our way. But the Perfians roaft only at an oven, which is a hole made in the ground two foot and a half broad, and five or fix foot deep. They burn nothing but bu(hes, and a kind of Turf mix’d with the dung ofCattd, and dry’d in the Sun. There are feveral roafhng Cooks at Ifpahan, that roaft a whole Sheep at a time where he that comes to buy may have as much cut out as he pleafes. Other Cooks (hops are only for boyTd meat or rice: their fruits which they pickle up in Vinegar being the only fawce which they have. As for their Bread it is very white, for they Have wheat enough tofurnifh the whole Kingdom. They bake every day, making up their Dow in the form of a thin Cake* ftrow’d over with Sefamum. They bake thefe Cakes in their Ovens in the ground, covering the batch over with little round flint ftones, that are quick ly hot and retain the heat. At tfpahqn they make a great fire in an earthen pot, and when it is hot they fpread the Dow againft the hides of the pot. The Ar~ nunianj make a fort ot bread as thin as Paper, which they bake upon a thin Iron plate which is as thin as Paper. Their Plate and Difhes are of red Copper tinned ' within fide. For they are forbid to make ufe of Silver by the Law of Mahomet* Nor does the King ufe any other then Gold Plate, of which he has great ftore. They have alfo a fait of Porcellane made at Kerman, To eat their broths they make ule of woodVfpoons: fen: as for their rice, which is thick, they take it up ,n fingers, and wipe their hands upon their handkerchiefs. • The firft thing fet upon the Table is the Pipe, the Tobacco, and the difh of Coffee £242 PjE^s rAN Book ¥. .

After they have given thanks and taken away the cloth, then they fall to drinking to excefs. He that gives the enter tainment never thinks he has done well, till his guefts are not able to find the way out of the room, and the more they tumble about the room, the lefs he thinks he has fpent his money in vain. ^ To conclude, the Perfians are very Gentile, and afford their vidfuals with a free will to all that will come and eat with them at Supper time: admiring at the cuftome of the Frank/, who (hut their doors when they fit down to their meals. ——: 1 : “ ‘ “ ' . r ‘ CHAP. XVIII. Oftbe Marriages oj the Perfians. T H E Perfians betroth their Children very young, that is at nine or ten years &gt; but among the Armenians there are fome marry’d and lye together at five or fix. The Law of Mahomet allows them but four lawful Wives, whom they call Ntfya. But there are others whom they call Amoutha or hir’d women, and of whom they may have as many as they can keep, and for fo long time as they pleafe, which is ratifi’d by the allowance of the Judg. They may alfo enjoy the Slaves whom they purchale. The Children both of the one and the other areac- compted lawful, and inherit all alike, without the diftindionofElder or Younger i but two Daughters can have but the (hare of one boy. When the womans time that was hir’d is out, the man difmiffes her, and (he is oblig’d to flay forty days before (he engage again, that it may appear whither (he be with Child or no. The man gives to the woman that he marries a Dowry aflign’d upon his Eftate, and fends her money and filks to make her cloaths. The maid alfo fends fomething to him, but very little, and all by theinterpoiition and intercourfe of the women. For the two parties never fee one another. Upon the wedding day, they fend to the Bridegrooms houfe, by the found of Drums and Trumpets, certain Holies and Men laden with the Brides goods, which is many times done out of vain-glory, and more for (hew then fubftance. The Bridegroom is led a foot, attended by fe- • veral women with Tapers in their hands, and a noife of Drums and other Inftru- rrients marching before them. Being come to the door of the Bridegrooms Houfe, if he have promis’d a larger Dowry to the women then he is able or willing to give, he keeps his door (hut. The Parents of the Maid knock, and he declares he will not have her at that price. But at length after fome concerts on both fides they agree, and the Virgin enters with her Mother and all her Kindred. Then the Moullabxtids the conditions of Marriages which being done, the Women retire into the inner part of the Houfe, the men feafting by themfelves, and the women by themfelves. This is all that is done upon the Wedding-day, but the following days are not al ways fo pleafing, and it often follows that both parties do not agree, or that the husband mifufbs his wife. Then the women that requires feparation, requires the Dowry promis’d her by her husband : which the man oft-times refufes, and if (he perfilts in her demand, is many times fo feverely us’d by him, that (he is conftrain’d to cry, Pth Devils name let me go, 1 demand nothing of thee, T hen they both repair to the Cafa or Cheit-Lejloon, who is a Doftor of the Law, and in his prefence they difeharge one another. This they may do by their Law three times. G g . AfterThe Persian Travels Book V.

Befides, that the dark Rooms could be no other then the Chambers for the Prieftsi and where the Rice and Fruits that were the feigned n©uri(hment of the Idols, were the better fecur’d from gnats and (lies. Leaving Tche- elminar, you come to lye at a Village half a league farther, where is very good Wine. From thence to ScMras is a hard days journeys efpecially when the Snow begins to melt: for then the Pvoad looks like a little Sea. 2 47 CHAP. XXI. Of the City of Schiras. ‘ ;, r| „ . 1 . ' J &gt; ■ . s i). ' T HE City of Schiras lies in 78 degr. 1$ min. of Longitude, and 2p deg. 3d min. of Latitude. ^Itisfeated in a plain that extends it felf about four leagues from the North to the South, and from the Wed to the Eaft about five leagues. Upon the South-eaft there is a Lake of fait water four leagues in com- pafs; leaving the Plain as you travel to the South, you pafs between two Moun tains, which are not fo clofe, but that they leave room for certain pleafant Valleys 3 'league and a half wide. The Soil about Schiras is good, and fruitful^ and it is particularly famous for the moft excdlent Wines of ail Perfia. As for the City it felf, there is nothing handfonac in it: for it looks rather like a Town half ruin’d then a City. For merly it was begirt with walls of Earth, which are now utterly decaid. The Houfes are of the fame Earth dri’d in the Sun, and whiten’d over with lime i fo that when it happens to rain, when the Earth comes to be well moiften’d, the Houfes fall of themfelves. Only the Colledg which Iman-Kouli-Kan built, and fome of the Mofqttces are of Brick: and the beft of thofe Mofquees is call’d Sha-Sbiraque, which out of a particular devotion is kept fomewhat better in re pair. However, there is nothing in it worth taking notice of. Upon the North- call fide, the City runs within a quarter of a league of the Mountain : and from a Stone-bridg, as you go out of the City to the foot of the Mountain, is a long Street in a ftreight line, where there ftands a Mofquee, built by Iman-Kouli-Kan, Without, it appears fair enough *, but within, it falls to ruine. There is an Otto- gonal Piazza before the Gate, and in the middle of the Piazza an Ottogonal Vafe, j^hich is fill’d by a little ftream that runs through the Street from the Mountain. Both Tides of the Street from the Mofquee to the Mountain are wall’d in; and at certain fpaces are great Gates one againft another, with rooms over them , the Windows whereof open into the Gardens behind the walls: all along by which, ^ns a row of Gypxefs* trees in a diredfc line ; and in the middle of the Street about248 The Persian Travels Book V. libouTtwo hunder’d paces on this liderthe Mofqitee, is another which receives the fame wafer as\it-tjBns from the Mountain. This Street was made by iman- Kouli-Kan, after he^d cut the Mountain at the end of it, to ftiorten the way from Scbiras to Ifpoyan* . , _ . , , There are in Schitas three or four Glais-houies, where they make great and fmall Bottles, to tranfport the Sweet-waters that are made in the City. There are alfo made the feveral forts of VdTels wherein they pickle their fruits of ail forts, which they fend in great quantities into India, to Sumatra, Batavia, and ^There is no Silk made, nor any other manufacture in Scbiras: only there are fome few Cbites or Painted-cloaths made there, which neveithelefs are very coarfe, and in ufe only among the meaner fort. As you go out of the City upon the North-well fide, you meet with along Alley or Walk, in three parts whereof are plac’d three Stones, which they call Mills. At the end of this walk is a Garden call’d Bay- Sba, or the King’s Garden. Over the Gate whereof is a great Room half ruin d : and ai the end of a large Walk planted with Cyprefs-trees, Hands a neat piece of building, but altogether negle&amp;ed. Upon the lef t-hand whereof is a great Pond pav’d with Free-ftone, being all the beauties of the Garden: which, it is true, was full of Fruit- trees, Rofes and JaJmins j yet, for want of order, it look d like a Wilder* nefs. ' v „ , . , -'xaj From the Garden to the Hill is a Plain of two leagues long, and ore broads which is all but one largeVinyard belonging to feveral perfons.Beyond theVineyard rife very high Mountains, from whence fall feveral little Springs that formaPuver, which is call’d Bend-Emir, from the name of a Town where the biggeft Spring rifes. This River of waters the whole Vineyard of Scbiras\ whereit never rains from Spring till Autumn: which is the reafon that in the Summer there is no water in the very Channel next the City.. Their Wines are the belt in ?erfta\ but there is not fo great a quantity made as people imagin. For, of all this great Vineyard, and in all the places round about the City for four or five leagues together, good part of the Grapes are dri’d, and a greater quantity pickl’d : and of the Wine, there are many VdTels full, which arc burnt for the benefit of the poor Travellers, and Carriers, who find it a great refrefhment to drink it with water. Their Wine^ as all other things, is fold by weight and not by meafure.^ In the year 1666, a mofi plentiful year for Wine, the Provifion of the King s Houfe amounted to 50000 Mens of Keukr.e, or the ancient Mes containing nine pound of ours, at fix teen ounces to the pound, (being the only weight-for W inej and the King allows .as much to the Franks, zs for his own Houfhold. The Jews otSchi- ras, who boaft themfelves of the Tribe of Levi, made above a hundefd and ten thoufard Mens, it being their chiefett livelihood y but the Governour ci ScbirM knows how to (hare with them in their profit. The whole account of Wine made at Scbiras amounts to 20002 5 Mens, or 4125 Tuns, at three hunder’d pints to the Xun. In Scbiras is an ancient Mofquee, wherein is the Sepulcher of a Sadi, whom the Terftans efieem the bell of their Poets. It has been a very fair one, accompanid 1 with a large Building, which was once a Colledgy but itrunstoruine&gt; as do alio many other Edifices within the City. Juft againft this Mofquee you defeend by a pair cf Stairs into a large Well, at the fcottem wherec t is a Vafe full of Filh, which no body dares to touch, it being Sacriledg torch the Sadioi whatbelongs to him. A little beyond this Mofquee, upon a high Rock, ftand the mines of a Gaftley and upon the top cf all the Reck is a fquare Well cut out of the Rock. It is very deep, and ten or twelve foot broad : formerly, they told me, their Adultercffes were all thrown into it. There is one wonderful Well in this City &gt; which is 15 years rifing, and 15 years falling y that is, the water is one fifteen years rifing to the top, and another fifteen years finking to the bottom. There are mSchiras two or three Bazars well built, through the midft whereo the water runs in a Channel. ,, , To the South-weft, a good league frem the City, there is a little Hil)di vl e from the great Mountain, upon which Hill are three Gates to befeen,the rerna ^“Chap. XXL of Mortfieur Ta verni er. derofan Idolatrous Tempel. There were four Gates, but the South-Gate is tumbl’d down: the reft are handing, compos’d of three Stones: Upon both the Stones that make the Jaums, there are rwo'figures in half Relief, with their faces one looking upon another, with their arms extended i one holding in his hand a pan, out of which iflues a flame of lire, and the other a Towel folded up. The other Statue holds as it were a Purfein one hand,and a bowl t&gt;f Fire in the other i the Figures being as big as the Life, only their faces are fpoil’d j and as for the other doors, they are both the fame. Two Mufquet-ftiot from thence, in a plain, rifes a little Mountain, from the North-fide of which fall many Springs that meet in a large Pond full of Fifti. Some high Trees grow there, to (hade the Habitation of a Dervis that lives there. The place is pleafant, and all the Springs together fill a Channel large enough to water the neighbouring Fields. Here it was that certainly the ancient Idolaters came to wafti, and thence went to the Temple to fay their Prayers, and make their Offerings. ^ Haifa league beyond, at the foot ofaMountain, is a place about 500 paces in compafs, whence there fall * good number of Springs that meet in a Pond, en viron’d with high Trees, and full of Fifti. In one corner of the Mountain ftand Figures, cut out of the Rock much bigger then the Life. The two which are uppeimoft look one upon another *, and that upon the left-hand carries a large Turbant, fuch as the Grand Vizier of Conjiantinople wears when he goes to the divan. From hisTurbant to the middle of his Forehead, he was bound with the Treffes of his own hair, the ends whereof were fatten’d together with large Buckles behind in his neck. His habit was a Robe after the ancient faflaion, with a kind of a Cutlace by his fide. Nor did the oppofite Statue much differ from this, only inftead of a Turbant, he wore a kind of Miter upon his head. The two other Statues underneath the former, ftretch’d forth their arms one to the other: the one reprefenting a Man, the other a W oman. The Man feem’d to prefent the Woman a Nofegay of Flowers &gt; but in truth it was a difficult thing to difeernthem, in regard they were both cover’d with a Fig-tree that grew juft be fore them out of the Rock. , About two thoufand paces farther, there is a Lake of fait water about ten leagues in compals, which is fill’d by feveral Springs that fall from the Mountains; and here it is that the people make a great quantity of Salt. There runs into it alfo a fait River, over which you crofs upon a large ftone-Bridg about three miles from Schim, in the way to Bander-Abajji. Half a league from the City are two remarkable Wells: the one upon the top of the Mountain, the other' upon the defeent, cut out of the Rock : both of an extraordinary depth. There is no water in either, becaufe they are half full of Stones, which they that come to fee the Wells, throw into ’em. There are alfo to be feen the Ruines of a Cattle formerly built there for the Guard of the High* ways. But fince Iman-Kouli-Kan made the new way, he caus’d all thofe For- trdTes to be defac’d, as being expenfive to the King, and burthenfbme to the Mer chant, from whom the Guards exa&amp;ed Toll in thofe places. Now all the ways are free, and the Merchants travel fecurdy., &lt; About half a league from the City, toward the North, upon the brow ofa high Mountain, ftands a little Mofquee, like a Hermitage: and fifteen foot below it guQies out a fair Spring, which is the heft in the places neer to Schirar. Neer it is a little place encompaft with a Pale, with four Pillars that uphold a Ceding. Here it is that a Demr (its, and entertains all them that come to vitit him, to 'jhom he prefents Tobacco, according to the cuttom of the Countrey. This phee is one of the heft Profpedts in all Syria, from whence you behold one way a ll the plain of Scbim, and all the City from one end to the other, with the Gar dens. But people go not thither for the fair Profpedf, or to vifit the Vervh, but admire a Cyprds-tree not above three or four paces from the Profpe&amp;, planted among the Rocks', and of that bignefs, that four men can hardly fathom it: p ls P r oportionably high, end is look’d upon to be the faireft Cyprefs-tree in all er fi a ? where fo many grow belides. This Tree is fed by the Spring which I have Mention’d, falling fome eight or ten foot below into a Cittern, .which is always dl &gt; whence through a Canal it runs into a Garden in the plain fome feven or eightThe Persia n Trav Book V eight bunder’d paces trom rhc Mountain, in this Garden are to be (een the re mains of a Palace of one of the ancient Kings of Perfia: yet what is frill to be fee n , does not declare it to have been very magniheent. The King was call’d Pad fa quiejhel, the Scald-pated King. A thing not to be wonder’d at, in regard there are few Vetfians but fuch as either have or have had feald heads. Two leagues from Scbiras, to the South-weft, at the foot of the great Moun tain, Bands a Hermitage, call’d Fir-B ohw, where three or four live, as be ing a plcafant place •, for the Vervi* always choofe out the moll delightful places to pitch their Tents in: where they fit fmoaking their Pipes with that gravity, that if the King himfelHhould come by, they would not fiir to give him re verence. That which adds to the pleafure of that Hermitage, is a fair Spring of water that fefrelhes the Garden, and the number of fair Trees that arc about it. \ v ‘ '■ About a quarter of a league from the City, toward the Well, istobefeena Church-yard encompaft wifh Walls i in the middle whereof, looking toward Mecca, (lands a Monument very much frequented by the Vervti, and other devout people, who fay their Prayers there, it being the Sepulcher of Hougi* Hafiz,, for whom they have a very great veneration. The year of his deceafe is fet down upon his Tomb i being in the year 13S1 : and he purchas’d that great eltem among the Peffiafis, for having compos d a great Book of Morality, and for that he was alfo one ofthebeft Poets of his time. He has left one great Poem behind him in the praife of good Wine'* which hascaus d many to aver, that Hougia-Hafiz, was no good MflJJi&amp;l'Wan, in regard he has fo highly prais d a thing which isfo ttri&amp;ly forbidd’n by the Law of Mahomet. Nccr to the Church-yard is a fair Garden, which men go to fee for the beauty of the Cyprcfs-trees, which are its chief ornament. They are to be admir’d for their height and bignels, among which, there ts one that was planted by the hand of Sba-Abbot the Great himfclf, in the year idoy s and it may well deferveto have been planted by the hand of a Monarch *, for it was bigger then the reh that had been planted above a hunder’d years before. 1 . . Without the City, upon the North-fide, at the foot of the Mountain, is a Gar den belonging to the ancient Kings of Perfia, call’d Bag-Firdous. It is full of Fruit-trees, and Rofe-trces in abundance. At the end of the Garden, upon the defeent of a Hill, (lands a great piece of Building, and below a large Pond af fords it water. The rich Inhabitants ofSchiras have been formerly very curious to have fair Gardens, and have been at great expences to that purpofe. But nei ther ziScbirar, nor at IJpahan, is there any thing that may compare with thofc lovely Paradifes of France and Italy. There arc many Inns in Schiras, but the Franks generally lodg at the Convent of the Carmelite Friars ? and they that would be more private, lodg at another Houfe that belongs alfo to the fame Friars, which they would fain fell, as being a charge to 5 cm at this time.

T HE fixth of March, by fight of the Clock in the morning, I departed from Scbiras \ and after fix hours travel through the plain that continues fertil for a league together beyond the City, I came to an Inn call’d Badaadgi. The water is bad, being as it were luke-warm. Here cold weather begins to ceafe. The next day l fet out by break of day, and came to a large and well-built Inn, only it ftood remote from any Town. It is call’d Mouzafferf and is the only place in Perfia where 1 met with black S&amp;ligots y or Water-nuts, as big and as good as ours in Vattphine, The Countrey breeds nothing but Goats and Sheep : and about two leagues olf runs a River along by the Mountain to the Well. The i8tb I departed by day-break, and travell’d eleven hours through a ftone- Countrey, cover’d with bitter Almond and Turpentine-Trees. I lodg’d in a fair Inn, call’d Paira, near to a River that comes from the Well,and makes the Coun trey fertil. There is Tome Wood in the Valleys, and Tome Villages appear on the other fide of the River toward the South. The 19th I fet out by four of the Clock in the morning, and travelTd along a Valley, wherein were^many Villages receiving the benefit of the River laft men tion’d. About eight in the morning I ftopt a t an Inn built in an Ottogonal form, a good league from the River, with feveral Villages between. The name of the Inn is Kaffer. . v The 20th I fet out two hours after midnight, and travell’d till ten in the morn ing through a dry Valley. By the way I met feveral Shepherds and Herdfmen, who were forfaking the hot Countreys, and driving toward Scbiras for cooL nefs. They that travel upon their own Horfes, and would fee one of the richeft parts of Per/ij, and fome Antiquities, fetting out from Kaffer, inftead of following the CmwtfH-road, take the right-hand way by the fide of the River, that runs a league and a half from the fame Inn. When you have paft the River, the way is very freight, and lies for two leagues together through a deep Rock, the Mountain up on the right, and the River upon the left, where there is not room in fome places for two Horfes to ride a-breft. All along this way, toward the top of the Moun tain, are little paths that lead to Caverns, fome of which are fo large, that they will contain two or three thoufand men. Having paft this way, you come into a Plain call’d Vadivan, four or five leagues in circuit j the greateft part of which is planted with Orange-trees, Citrons, and Granafs. Some of thefe Orange-trees two men can hardly fathom, being as high as our Walnut-trees j and this is one of tbe moft delicious fituations in all Perfia. I have travell’d through it feveral times, and fometimes only to divertife my felf. The reft of the Plain is fow’d with Rice and Wheat. You fet up your Tents under thefe Trees, and then the Countrey people bring Provifion of feveral forts, efpecially Partridges, Hares, and wild Goats. The River that croftes the Plain is full of Carps, Barbels, Pikes, and Crey-Filh. 1 remember one time a Countrey-man earn’d me down to the watef, and before my face took up a Filh with his hand. He Was fo nimble at it, that having caught one which he did not think big enough, he threw it back again, and took up another. Now in regard that Travellers generally ftay about ted or twelve days in that place, the Tumblers that live there-abouts, fail not to come W give you a Vifit, to (hew ye fome of their tricks, and to taft your Schirat me. 1 he Englifh and Hollanders ufually fpend the end of the Summer in this am, lor the benefit of the River, and the Trees *. which become fo large and air, by means of the River, which theGountrey-men bring in by Canals, and (hut tup in Ponds, among the Trees, to water their Grounds*, which is all the good t is River does in Perfia : for all the reft of its courfe is through cragged Rocks, and fait Marlhes. 5 The/ t ( \ 252 The Persian Travels Book V. The 2cth of March, by ten in the morning, I came to an Inn which was call’d Moufhe^ which is a-lone- Hcufe at the foot of a Rock. There is a Spring about five hunder’d paces from it, but the water is hot, and has a fulphury taft^ fo { { lat the Cat tel will hardly drink it. Therefore you muft go to a Gift an about two Mufqiief'thot from the Inn, where there is one newly fet up, inilead of another that was there before, into which a Jew once chanc’d to fall in, and was therefore broken by the fuperhitious Mahometans. Three quarters of a league from are two roads that lead to Lar the one fcrtlle Camds, the other for the Horfes and Mules, The firft is the W. by three diys journey, and is call’d the Road of the Deferti for after you HaVe paii a gfeat Town inhabited only by Camel-Mahers, where you lye the firft higlit, between that ’and Lar, you (hall meet with nothing of Koufcs but only fi£fdffnen“s Tents, that feed fotfietimts in one place, fpnetjnxs, in another. Upon tli Camels Rokd there are another fort of Fowl like the great Cartridges in their bodies, but their legs and feet refcmhle thofe of wild Ducks. The Camels take this Road, becaufe it is imjpoffible for tfctm to pafs the Mountain Jarwi over which the Horfes and Mules are hardly able to travel. Tfet out from Mcii(ht\thc 21 th of March, at twain the morning, and having traveled till eight through a plain, but ftony Countrey, I came to the little City of Jarron 7 which Is rather to be call’d a Forrelt of Palm-trees that bear excellent Dates. I lodg’d in an Inn five hunder’d paces from the City, andlfaid there two days. r s The 2 4t^,fetting out prefently after midnight,! travelPd a good hour, and then T began to mount the fteep Mountain of Jarron, which is very high,and veiy long-, but the defcer.t is the moft dangerous that ever I faw in all my Travels *,and betides that, the Moon did not (bine. Being at the top, after you have defended three or four hunder’d paces, you meet with a Bride pfope Arch, that reaches from one Mountain to another j a bold piece of Aichitc&amp;ure, rot enough to be admir’d being rais’d at the charges of Iman- kouli Kan for the benefit of Travellers. Be ing come to the bottom of this, you muff pafs two others as flee p in their a (cent as in the ,defceptj upon the top of one of which Bands a Ciflern, which, though ft be very large, is generally emptied by tit end of the Summer. Upon thefe Mountains thefe is fuch an infinite quantity of Partiidg that a man cannot mli that will but {hoof. By eight in the Morning I came to an Inn which is call’d Shafyl, which is a-loneHoufein a Defert Countrey, butflor’d with bitter Almond- trtes, and Turpentine-trees. Apposchirg neer to the Inn, you meet with two or three Cifierns, which are a great comfort to Travellers, water being very farce upon this Rood. There are at Shakal nine or ten Kadars for the Guard of the Road, who are alfo Ma ffets of the Inn: So foon as you are alighted, they ask you if you will eat any Rid, being fpfe of their blow, and having no more to do but to go to the Mountain and fetch one, where they fwarm. There are ftoreof Partridges, which are aimoft as big as Pullets 5 of which you may eafily killas many as you pleafe. The 2 i )th I travell’d five hours,from morfiihg till noon. An hour after I took Horfe, 1 met with a Mountain, the defeent whereof was very Beep. They call it the Mountain of Hufhen, at the foot whereof is a Fountain of encellent water. A good league farther you meet with a fair Inn call’d Mouezerhy in the rnidftof a pleafant Grove, where there is an excellent Spring of watery but becaufe there T 0 t0 be had, you n.uB go as far as Detadcmhe, a Village featedin a plain. A quarter of a league on this fide, upon the top of a Mountain, appears the ruins of an old Cafile *, the Village it felf being furrounded with Palm-trees. The Inn is a good one, provided with a very good Cifierni % he 2 yh I travell’d through a plain for three hours, and fiopt at Banam,a)it- fle City well built at the foot of a high Mountain i upon whi ch appais there- maihs of a large Cafile, Lenarou is the Frontier T own of the Province of F^r/, bordering upon the Province of Ldr.

A league from thence I lodg’d in an Inn call’d Pai-Cotali •, that is to fay, the foot of the Mountain, as being built at the foot of the Mountain. From thence to Lar is not above four or five hours tra vellings but the way is very bad, and feveral fwift Torrents are, to be part over. ' You may take another Road from upon the right-hand toward the Weft &gt; it is the (horter way by two or three leagues; but fobad, and fo narrow, that in many places t wo Horfemen cannot ride a-breft, being for the moft part all Rocks and Precipices. ’ . ; Lar is the Capital City of the Province of the fame name, which formerly bore the title of a Kingdom. It is but of an ordinary bignefs, enclos’d on both fides with high Mountains, being built round about a Rpck, upon which there ftands a Caftle of Free-ftone, wherein the King keeps a Garrifon. The whole Country is very hot, nor have they any water but Rain water, which they pre- ferve in Citterns, and which foiretimes caufes a wide Torrent that runs by one fide of the City, and falls from a Cafcade two ftories high, made of Free-ftone. In the City and parts adjacent, grow a great number of trees, efpecially Date trees and Tamarisk. The Gardens alfo and Mountains are full of Orange trees. There are but two Inns in Lar, the one within the City, which is not a very good one*, the other at the end of the City towards Ortmts, jyhich would be convenient, but that it is always afloat when the Rains falh for which reafon the Franks generally lye at the Hollanders Houfe at the end of the City. And there is a neceflity for flaying at Lar^ to change the Camels j for the Camels that come from Ifpahan can go no furthers every City having their particular priviledges. Which fometimes proves prejudicial to.the Merchant, in regard the Governour will delay the change of the Camels till he is prefented. The Fortrefs oi Lar takes up the whole furface of the top of the Rock * and there is but one way to climb it up, with great difficulty. It is more long than broad and the four corners arefortifi’d with four Baftions, or Bulwarks, between which are rais’d feveral Towers, for the Souldiers Lodgings. That Fortrefs is the Royal Prifon, whither the King fends fuch Prifoners as he takes in war, or fur- prizes by ftratagem. I met wiih two there, one a Prince of Georgia, tht other Mengrelia. The two Princes had each of them a Toman a day allow’d them, and tenor twelve Servants to wait upon them. Upon one of the corners of the Caftle, toward the Weft, was built a Banquetting Houfe with three or four Cham bers. In the middle of the Court hands the Magazine, full of Bows and Arrows, Bucklers and Muskets, enough to arm fifteen hundred men. for the Inhabitants of the Province, but more efpecially of the City of Lar, are accounted the beft Mufqueteers in Perfia, and the beft at making the Barrels of Muskets, all but the Breach, which they know not how to order fo well as we. The Governours Houfe t anfwers to the great Road *, but there is nothing at all of neatnefs without, only before the door there is a good handfomc Court, about fixty paces fquare, and clos’d in with Walls, which leads you into two large Bazars of good Stone, very well arch’d. The moft part of the Inhabitants of Lar ate Jews, who are famous for leveral Silk Manufa&amp;ures, efpecially for making neat Girdles. The Countrymen wear up on their heads a kind of a felt of fine wool, and very well wrought. It refcmbles a Cap not yet ftiap’d, with four Corners behind, and cut on the fides j andthefe forts of Caps are made at Kerman, There are an infinite number of Cifterns, as well within the City, as in the parts adjacent \ and all but little enough, in regard that fometimes it does not rain for three years together. When the Rains fall they do not fill their Cifterns the firft day, but rather cover them quite up, till the earth be well foak’d. Now for the diftributton of this water they take an excellent courfe *, for they never keep open above three Cifterns at a time} and when they do op’n them, the Governour or fome other perfon appointed for that purpofe, is prefent &gt; fo precious is water - v H h 2 in &gt;&lt; . y 2 54 The Per s i a n Travels' Body; in that place, though never To bad.

I lodg’d ap a little Inn call’d Sbamzenghi. It is low, built like Crofs, with four doors to receive the cool winds every way. All the Inns are ‘ built in this fafhion between this and Bander, and near to one another for the eafe of Travellers. As for the Beafts, they lye without, for they have no Stables. All the Houfes from Lar to Ormus are built after one manner. For there is a kind of a Pipe, lil^e a Chimney, that runs from the bottom to the top to gather wind * The feconq l left Shamzenghi about four in the afternoon, becaufe the heat is cool’d by a gentle breeze toward the evening. Three hours I traveil’d through a barren Plain* afterwards over moft fearful Rocks, and about ten at night I came to Cormout, a great Village well ftord with Palm-trees. From Lar to Comout is the worft way in all Perfia. For many times there is no water to be found. ^ The third, I parted from Cormut a little after midnight* and having travell’d fe- ven hours in very bad way, full of great ftones and filthy puddles, I came to a hew Inn call’d Tenquidalen, In the middle of it is a little vafe of running water fed by a little Bream that falls from the Mountain. But the water being fome- *hing brackifh, they have fince that built a very fair Ciflern. They alfo broach’d the Mountain to bring the water into a Plain, which was barren before, but is now fruitful, and beautifi’d with two good Villages. This was done by a rich Merchant, whofc Children enjoy the Revenues of both. ^The fourth, I fet forward an hour after midnight, and travell’d through an un inhabited Coun trey, full of wide Torrents when the rainfalls. There are but two fmall Inns upon the Road, and about eight in the morning I arriv’d at that which they call Gottrba-Sarghant. It was built with the Money which a Merchant of Ormut left for that purpofe * whofe firength fail’d him in that very place, for want of a refiing place. This Inn is not far from a Village that Bands upon the Mountain to the North. The fifth, fetting out a little after midnight, I travell’d till feven in the morning through a dry and defcrt Gountrey, yet Bor’d with Lentisk trees, and lay at a good Village call’d Cauvreftan, where the people were mowing large Fields of Early. Here, if the Inn be full, you may lye atrhe Countrey-mens Houfes, who areac- cuflom’d to entertain Travellers, and get well by it. This place is famous for Water-Melons, as big as our Pumpkins * and are the beif in all Perfia. The meat is very red, and as fweet as Sugar, which is a great refrefhment to Travellers. The Kelonter of the place gave me two Raddilhes, one weighing 30, the other 45 pounds, and were very good meat. The 6th 1 fet out after midnight, and travell’d till it was day through plains of Sand, over which it is impoffible to find the way without a guide. About three a Clock in the morning I crofs’d over two Bridges joyn’d together by a long Caufey. Before I came to the firfi? I rode over another for a good quarter of a league, which Caufey runs on a great way to the fecond Bridg, under Which Bows a fait River * the fhoar of which is full of moving fands &gt; fo that before thofe Bridges were made, it was dangerous to foard it without a This Caufey and the two Bridges were made and built by a Perfian, whofe name was Aly b who wanting employment at home, apply’d himfelf to the King of Golconda, who lik’d him fo well, that he made him General of his Army. Being thus ad Vane d, he alfo turn’d Merchant, and trading ftrfi with one Veflel, then with two, got a great EBate. At length,all that hehad thus got in forty years, to get him- ielfa name in Perfi#, he employ’d in making this Caufey and the two Bridges. •' : ■ : : r / ThefeChap. XXIII. o/Monfieur Tavernier.

O TLmut is an Ifland in p2.i. 42. of Longitude, and in 25.^ 30. m. ofLatl- tude. It lies at the mouth of the Ferfian Gulpb, two good Leagues from the firm Land. There is neither tree nor herb that grows in it.* (or it is all owr cover’d with Salt, which is very good and as white as fhow. And as for the black mining Sand-duft of Ornw, it is very much us’d for ftandiihes. Before the Portuguefe^ cme to Omm, there was a City where the Kings of Oiw, who where alfo Kings of Larry rehded. . When the Portugal! took it there were in it two young Princes, Sons of the deceafed King, whom they carri’d into p&gt;m. Where, in regard they were handfomely proportion’d, though fomewhat 1 war thy, the King entertain’d them very kindly, and gave them an honourable al- iowance. One day that he had (hew’d them the EfamuL and ail the chief pieces ot Arcnite&amp;ure in Madrid, the King ask’d them what they thought pf living in pain. To whom they anfwer’d, that they had leen nothing but what was worthy admiration, but then fetching a deep ligh, and perceiving theXing defirous to know the meaning of it, they gave him to underhand that it was for grief that they muft never more fit under their own Tree. For near to the City oiQnnus was a Baumans tree, being the only tree that grew in the Ifland. The Portugals being mailers of the Ifland from an ill-built City, rear’d it to that night of Magnificence which that Nation admires * fo that the very barrs o£ their oors and windows were all guilt. The Fortrefs was a noble thing, and in good repair: and they had alfo a ttately Church dedicated to the Virgin, where they were alio wont to walk. For other place of promenading they had none. Since e Berfians took it, the Cattle indeed ttands in good repair, with a Garrifon* th it: but the City is gone to ruine i for the Dutch carried moft of the ttones awav to build Bait avia. , , Between the Ifland o^Ormus, and the Continent the Sea is not very deep&gt; for A e r gre f ^P 5 t ^ at foil in and out of the Gulf, pafs by the other fide of the Ifland. s or tie ortrefs which ttands upon a poynt oi the lfland,itisalmo(lencompa(s’d wim the oca, and lyes right over againfl Perfia. ander-Abajfi^ fo call’d becaufe the great Sha-Abbas the firft brought it into re in V 00 ’ 15 at P re fo nt a Chy reafonably wellbuilt^ and ttor’d with large watre- ^ uies,over which are the lodgings of the Merchants.

To this place come all the (hips that bring Commodities from India for Perju, Turfy, ot ^ part of Jfia or Europe And indeed it would be much more frequented by the Merchants from all Regions and Countries. ' But the Air o(Bandar is fo unwholefome and fo hot, that no Grangers can live there, in probability of health, unlefs it be in the months of December^ January, Fe bruary and March though the Natives of the Country may perhaps ftay without prejudice to the end of 4pril. After that they retire to the cooler Mountains two or three days journey off, for five or fix months, where they eat what they gain’d before. They that venture to ftay at Gowron during the hot weather, g et a malignant Fever, which if they fcape death, is hardly ever cur’d. However it bequeaths the yellow Jaundies during life to the party. March being pafs’d the wind changes, and blowing at weft Couth weft, in a (bort time it grows fohot and fo ftifling, that it almoft takes away a mans breath. This wind is by the Ara bian f call’d El-SamkU or the poyfonous wind, by the ferfms Bade-S ambour, be- caufe it fuffocates and kills prefently. The flefh of them that are thus ftifl’d feels like a glewie fat, and as if they had been dead a month before. In the year 1632. riding from Ifpahan to Bagdat, I and four more Perjw« Mer chants had bin ftifl’d but for fomt'Arabians that were in our Company. For when they perceiv’d the wind, they caus’d us to light, lye down upon our bellies and cover our felves with our Cloaks. We lay fo for half an hour, and then fifing wc faw our horfes were in fuch a fwcat, that they were hardly able to cany us. This happen’d to us two days journey from Bagdat. But this is obfervable, that if a man be in a Boat upon the water when the fame wind blows, it does no harm though he were naked at the fame time. Sometimes the wind is fo hot that it burns like Lightning. And as the PAtdfGomron is fo bad and dangerous, the foil is worth nothing; For it is nothing but Sand, nor is the water in the Cifterns very good. They that will be at the charge fetch their water from a fountain three leagues from Bander, call’d the water of Ifw. Formerly there was not an herb to be feen: but by often watering the ground, Lettice, Radi(h and Onions have begun to grow. The People are fwarthy, and wear nothing about them but only a fingle fliirt. Their ufual dyet is dates and fifh. Which is almofl the dyet of their Cartel, for when they come home from browfing the barren bufties, they give them the heads and guts of their fi(h boyl’d, with the kernels of the Dates which they ear. The Sea of Bander produces good Soles, good Smelts and Pilchards. They that will have oyfters muft have ’em caught on purpofe, for the people cat none. Upon Land they want neither for wine of Schiras not Xe/i i nor for Mutton, Pi geons and Partridge, which are their ordinary dyet. There are two FortrefTes, one upon the Eaft, the other toward the Weft. The Town increafes in trade and building, and fills with inhabitants, who build their houfes with the remaining ruins of Ormtu. The reafon why the Trade is fettl’d rather at Bander Abajfi, then at BanderCon- go, where the Air is good apd the Water excellent, is becaufe that between Omns and Congo lie feveral Jflands, which make the paflage for (hips dangerous, befides that the often change and veering of the wind is requir’d; neither indeed is there water enough for a Veffel of 20 or 2 5 guns. Then the way from Congo to Lar is very bad. From Bander Abaft, to Lar it is very good, and provided with good Inns. 1 From the day that a Merchant fakes up mony at Gomron, he is bound to return it in three months, and the change goes from fix to twelve per Cent. When the Goods come to Ifpahan or any other place, the Merchant is not to touch them, till he has pay’d the money which he borrow’d, unlefs the Creditor will truft him farther. Some T'urkifh and Armenian Merchants take up money ztGommlo pay it at Suratt *, where they take up other money for Ifpahan j at Ifpaban for ILrzerom or Bagdat, paying the old debt with the new fums, which they take up in esch place. The money taken up at Erzerom is pal’d at Burfa, ConjiantinopU or Smyrna, Money taken up at Bagdat i$ pai’d at Aleppo. j 1 altyays made accompt, that to take up money at Golconda for Ligorn or Vmice, at change for change, the money returns at the cheapeft rate, to ?5 per Cent, but more oftentimes it amounts to a hunder’d.

All the Trade which thefe people have with their Neighbours, is in Cop per, whereof they have two extraordinary Mines, from whence they furnilh the gteateft part of the Mogul's Territories; but of which they have Salt in exchange, not having any of their own. This Salt coils them dear, in regard it is four months travel to the place where they fetch it, that is to fay, from the Territories of Maton-cha to the Indian Coail towards Bacaim.

He is bound every year to fend an Ambafiador with twenty Elephants to the Governor of Ratna, who fends them to the Great Mogul. The greateft part of his revenue confifts in Elephants, Musk and Rhubarb.

They are as heavy as the new ones} and though they be no better Gold, yet fome years lince they went at 20, and 25 Cent, more than the new ones} the reafon is, for that the Bankers being all Idolaters, they are fo fuper- Ilitious as to believe, that if they melt down that Money, fome Calamity will P fall their Country} and they hold this for fuch a certain truth, That for fear th- King of Golconda Ihould melt it, they paid him for certain Years 20000 Pagods^ But you mult obferve, that thefe old Pagods are no-where currant but in the Kingdom ot Golconda. For my part, I think it is more for their profit than out of any Superltition, that they make ufe of them in that manner. For in all the Kingdom of Golconda, in matter of trade, they never mention any but the old Pagods, though they make their payments in new Pagods, or Roupies: and in this cafe they who receive thofe new Pagods, or thofe Roupies, play th:ir game 10 well, that they gain a fourth part, or a half, and fometimes one ver Cent, al- ledging for the reafon, that thofe new Pagods are either the King of Fifamur\ or the Raja 01 Carnatica\ or the Raja of Feloucheh, or the Fnrtifh, or the Hollanders. And they make as much of the Roupies; for there is no confidera- ble payment made, which is not received by the Cherajf or Banker makin 0- it good to the Seller, who fometimes has no need of his Money in a Monti? or two, and fo he receives the intereft of it* though it be but for two days. If the payment be made in old Pagods, and that the fum amount to two or three hundred, or three or four thouland, the Banker takes them all, and viewing them one jdter another, he divides them into five or fix parts} and then poking i email, he fayes of fome, that they are more us’d than others, and that having palled through many hands, there is a wafle of the mettaf about one per Cent. 0 - thers, layes he, want not above half one fer Cent, others but a fourth part. Thefe agods have been bor d fome half thorough, others a quarter thorough} and it is a wonderful thing what this boring amounts to. For in regard thefe Pagods are very thick, and cannot be dipt, thofe that are Mailers of the trade, take a Piercer, and pierce the Pagod thorough the fide, halfway or more, taking out of one piece as niucn Gold as comes to two or three Sous. And provided they be not taken m t e facE, they chufe rather to follow this Trade than any other} there be ing no^ andycraft Tradesmen among the Indians, that gain more than three us a ay.

An account of the Money of As t Ai the more he gains * for if he makes any payment,according to the quantity of the fum, he -puts the Pagods by fifty or a hundred together in little bags, and feals them up with his Seal, and writes upon the bag the number of the Pagods with in j and fo delivers them to him to whom he makes the payment. When the Party makes ufe of them, he never opens the bag, but gives them as they are to him to whom they are due ^ who goes to the fame Banker that feaFd the bags. The Banker feeing his Seal whole, makes anfwer. That the Pieces are good and in that manner they fliall pafs all the Year without opening the bags. But vvhen ever they change the hand, they fend for the fame Banker, who always will have fo much per Cent. for his Vifit. But, as I have faid, the Merchant leaves them in his hand to get Interefl } who then pays Eight per Cent, for a Year, and fome- times Twelve. Thus the Bankers have always the greateil part of the Mo ney in the Kingdom in their hands, of which they make large profit. ’Tis the Cuflom in that Country, every Month to pay the Soldiery} but for the molt part the Soldiers, Captains, and other Officers will not flay till the Month be up but come to the Bankers, who difcount after the rate of Eighteen or Twenty per Cent, by the Year, befides that they pay them in thefe Pagods, againfl which others would often objeft. If there be any large Diamond to be fold in any Country, thefe Bankers have intelligence of it prefently} or if there be.aiiy fair Ruby, ’tis^ot long before they have it in pawn ^ for every Year when the Mer chants return from Pegtt^ and have any Rubies, moft commonly they are in debt} and in regard it is the Cuflom to pay within fifteen dayes after the Mer chant comes afhoar, he pawns his belt goods he has for payment, as well of the freight of the Ship, as of what he may have taken up at Pegu. After that he fells the worft of his goods to pay the Banker, who lent him the Money upon his arrival. Thofe that work in the Diamond Mines, or the Merchants that hire the Mine, when they have any fair Stones, they fell them to thefe Bankers, be- caufe there is ready Money j or elfe they pawn them to the Bankers, till they can find a Chapman to buy them.

The Queen feeing the King fo highly alfe£ted toward her, fail’d not to make ufe of fo favourable an opportunity. To which purpofe.

This requelt furpriz’d the King, and kept him very fad for fome days, being unwilling to deny her any thing, and yet being as loth to grant her a Boon of fo high a nature. In the mean time the Queen ply’d the King with paftime and Divertifements, pretending to take no notice of his melancholy. At length the fifth day after file had made her Petition, the King no longer able to refill her Charms, nor the Itrong Paflion he had for her, told her he would retire for twenty four hours, and that (he might afiiime the abfolute Command of the Kingdom during that time. At the fame time he caus’d all the Grandees that were then at Court, to be fent for into his prefence, and then commanded them to obey her, and pun&amp;ually to execute her Orders, as if it were he himfelf that fpoke to them. It was a long time before that the Queen had made every thing ready, and that Ihe had fecretly hoarded up great quantities of Gold and Silver in all the Cities where the Mints were appointed, and had diftributed the Stamps as Ihe thought convenient. And indeed it was a wonderful thing, that a Woman Ihould fo politickly carry on fo great a defign,as to have four and twenty Stamps engrav’d, and to keep in a readinefs in Gold and Silver above two Millions in all the Cities, without being difcovered to the King, or any of the Court.

The day being appointed, Ihe fent away Meflengers to all the Cities, commanding them on that day to Coin Roupies of Gold and Silver, to the value already mention’d. When the King and the Grandees came to underlland the bufinefs, they were flrangely furpriz’d ^ efpecially Sultan Kourom y the Queens implacable enemy, who, as fome perfons of the Countrey allur’d me, fainted away at the news, and did not come to himfelf in a good while after. The thing was fo fuddenly done, efpecially in the Cities neer at hand, that within two hours after Ihe was fate up*- on the Throne, Ihe caus’d feveral quantities of that Gold and Silver to be thrown among the people, which during the Reign of Gehan-guir went currantly for Rou- pies. But when Sultan Kourom, who took upon him the Name of Cha-gehan came to the Crown after the death of his Father, he forbad all perfons to ufe thole Ronpies upon pain of death, and commanded all that had any of them, either in Gold or Silver, to carry them to the Mint; where they Ihould receive the value of them, to the end they might be melted down. For which reafon they are at prefent very rare, particularly thofe in Gold j among the reft, two or three of them are fo hard to be found, that an hundred Crowns has been given for one of them. The Roupies of Gold are worth one and twenty Livres of our Money : and thofe of Silver, thirty Sous. The Queen, during her Reign of twenty four hours, had that refpedt for the King, that on the back-fide of the Pieces whereon the twelve Signs were Engraven, Ihe caus’d the Name of Gehan-guir to be ftamp’d vvtth her own, and the name of the place where they were Coin’d, all in Arabic!^ Letters.

He was as good as his word in part, for he fo orderM his bulinefs, by his politick contrivances, that the General was brought to the King, who would not prefently put him to death. Sultan Kofrou efcapd that bout, and continu’d the War many years againft his Father, who at length took him in Fight, and caus'd his eyes to be pull’d out. The King detaining the General in cuftody, his Wife and his Daughter found a way to fave his life as you fhall hear. The Daughter of the Perfian General, who was his only Child , was about fourteen years of Age, the moft accomplifh’d Beauty at that time in all the Kingdom , Ihe was molt rarely educated, and could both write and read the Arabian, Perfian, and Indian Languages. The Mother and the Daughter went every day to Court, to hear what would become of the General ^ and underftanding at length, that the King intended either to put him to death , or to ban fh him, they came to the Haram, and calling themfelves at his Majefties feet, they humbly begg’d pardon, the one for her Husband, the other for her Father y Which they eafily obtain’d * the King being furpriz’d at the Beauty of the Virgin, to whom he afterwards furrendred his Affections. All the Court was altonilh’d afterwards, how the General and his Wife could keep, fo private, a Daughter that was fo incomparably fair, that it fhould not come to the Kings knowledge. At length he lov’d her fo tenderly, that not being able to deny her the liberty of Reigning one whole day in his place he gave her leave tolhare with him afterwards in the Government. And fhe it was that gave motion to all the moll important Affairs of State ; the King excufing himfelf to the Grandee’s of his Court, who wonder’d why he let the Queen bear fo great'a fway, by telling them that Ihe was fit for the Government, and that it Was time for him to take his eafe. i,and2. is as ail the reft are, the backlide of the Twelve Signs.

N this Relation 6f my Indian, I will obferve the fame Method as in the Reci tal of my Per pan Travels} and begin with the Defcription of the Roads ? which lead you from Ifpahan to Dehly and Gehanadatt^ where the Great ^fo- . gal Refides at prefent. Though the Indies flretch themfelves front Per pa for the fpace of above 400 Leagues together, from the Ocean to that long Chain of Mountains that runs through the middle of Apa from the Eaft to the Weft, and which was known to Antiquity by the Name of Mount Caucafus, or Mount Taurus * yet there are not fb wany ways to travel out of Per pa, into the Indies^ as there are to travel out of Turhy into Perpa \ by reafon that between Perpa and the Indies there are nothing but valt Sands and Defarts,where there is no water to be found. So that you have but two Roads to choofe,in going from Ifpahan to Agra. The one is partly by Land,and partly by Sea} taking Shi pat Ormus. The other altogether by Land, through Candahar. The firft of thefe two Roads is amply defcrib’d,as far as Or- the end of my firft Book of my Per pan Travels. So that I am now only to [peak of the manner of Sailing from Ormus to Suratt. There is no Sailing at all times upon the Indian as upon the European Seas: ou muft obferve the proper Seafons, which being elaps’d, there is no more ven- unng. The Months of November, December, January, February and March, are e 0Il y Months in the year to Embark from Ormus to Suratt \ and from Suratt to4 - - • - - - An account of the Money of Asia. Part II, to Ormus : But with this difference,that there isnoftirringfrom Suratt after the end of February j biit you may Sail from till the end of March, or the fif teenth of Jprii: for then the Weftern-winds, that bring rain aldng with them into begin to' blow. 1 During the firft four Months there blows a North-eaft- wind which carries them from Suratt tb Ormas in fifteen or twenty days. Then veering a little, to the North,it ferves ; as well for thofe that are bound for as thofe that are bound from thence. • Then the Merchants generally providefor a Voyage of thirty, or five and thirty days. But if they would Sail from Ormu to Suratt in fourteen or fifteen days, they mull take Shipping either in March^v at the beginning of April, for then the Weftern-wind blows full in their Stern* N L .. The Veflels which Sail from Ormns run within fight of Mafiate upon theCoall of bearing off to Sea for fear of coming too near the Per fan Coafl. They that come from Suratt, do the fame thing, to make the Entry of the Gulf. But neither the one nor the other touch at Mafcate^ to avoid paying Cuftoms to an Arabian Prince, who took that place from the Pormgals. Mafcate is a City fituate juft by the Sea-fide, over againft three Rocks that make the Entry into the Harbour-very difficult, and at the foot of a Mountain upon which the Pormgals have three or four Forts. It isobferved Pm, Mafcatt Ormus^ and Balfara^ are the three places in the Eaft where the heat is moft in! fiipportable. Formerly only the Hollanders and Englijh undefftodd this Courfe of Navigation } but fome years after the Armenians, Mahometans, Indians, and Banians, have built them Velfels. But it is not fo fafe to Embark in them, for they nei ther underftahd the Sea fo well, nor are they fo good Pilots. The Veifels that Sail to Smatt^ which is the only Part in the Empire of the Great Mogul, Sail within fight of Din, and the Point ot St. John, and come to an Anchor afterwards in the Road of Comli, which is not above four Leagues from Suratt, and tvVO from the Mouth of the River toward the North. They tranfport their Wares from one place to another, either by Waggons,or in Boats. For great Vefiels cannot get into the River of Skratt till they have unladen, by reafon of the Sands that choakit up The Hollanders return as foon as they have landed their Wares at Couali, and fo do the Englifh, it not being permitted to ei ther to enter into the River. But fome years fmee, the King has given the Enffifi a place to Winter in, during the rainy Seafons. Suratt is a City of an indifferent bignefs,defended by a pitiful Fortrefs,by the foot whereof you muft pafs, whether you go by Land or by Water. It has four Towers at the four Cbrhers,and in regard there are no Platforms upon the Walls, Guns are planted upon wooden Scaffolds. The Governor of the Fort only com mands the Soldiers in the Fort, but has no power in the City, which has a par ticular Governpur to receive the King’s Cuftoms,and other Revenues through the Extent of his Province. The Walls of the Town are only of Earth, and the generality of theHoufes like Barns, being built of Reeds, plaiftered with Cow-dung, to cover the void fpaces,and to hinder them without from difeerning between the Reeds what is dohe within. In all Suratt there be but nine or ten Hoiifes which are well built: whereof the Chn-bander, or chief of the Merchants, has two or three. The reft belong to the Mahumetan Merchants nor are thofe, wherein the Fn^ and Hollariders dwell, lefs beautiful *, every Prefident,and every Commander, be ing careful to repair them which they put upon the account of their Compa nies. However,they do but hire thofe Houfes; the King not fuffering any Prarf to have an Houfe of his own, for fear he ffiould make a Fortrefs of it. The Ca puchin Friars have built them a very convenient Convent, according to the Model of oUr European Houfes,and a fair Church ^ for the building of which,! furnilha them with good part of the Money. But the Purchafe was made in the Name of a Maronite Merchant of Aleppo, whofe name was Chelebi, of whom I have fpoken in my Per fan Relations. &amp; l u I CD Cil fe aft ‘td ii t terj tffl 'Ha: Caj tl Mt ttliBook I.

' HHO avoid Repetitions, which cannot be flitimi’d in the Courfe of long Travels; it behoves me to let the Reader underftand what belongs to the Cuftom-’ tafe. Money, Exchange, Weights and Meafures of the Indians. When your Commodities are unladen at Suratt, you mult carry them to the titftotmhoufe adjoyning to the tort. They arc very fevere, and very exad in fearching the People. Particular Merchants pay from four to five ?er Cent, at the Cuftom-houfe for all forts of Ware. But for the Enghfc and Ho/W-Company, they pay lefs: But 1 believe if they did but call up what it cofts them m Depu- fations and Prefents which they are oblig’d every year to fend to the Court,, they ^ould notpay muchlefs for their Wares, then particular Merchants. . Chid and Silver pay two in the hundred, and when it is brought into the Ctiftom-houfe, the Mailer of the Mint comes and takes it, and Coins it into the Ifaey of the Gountrey. Thev agree with him upon the day wherein he will un- dmake to return the new Pieces: And for fo many days as he makes them flay after that, he pays them Interelb, according to the proportion of the Silver Which he receives. The Indians are very fubtil and crafty in matters pi Money and Payments ^ three or four years after the Silver is coind, it loles half pet' Cm. and goes at the fame race as old Silver ^ for, fay they, it is impoffible but thatit fhould lofe in palling through fo many hands. You may carry all forts of Iwer into the Dr ninions of the Great Mgitl. For in all the Frontier Cities there is a Mint where it is purified to the higiieft perfection, as is all the Gold v and Silver in India^ by the Kings Command,and coin d into Money. Silver in Bais, or old Plate, which is bought without paying for the falhion, is the Silver by Which you lhall lofe leail • tor as for coin d Silver, there is no avoiding the lois tf the Coinage. All their bargains are made, with a condition to pay in com d Silver within the prefent year. And it yon make payment in old Silver , you mull refolve to lofe according to the time fifice it was firfl Coin’d. In all places far remote from Cities, where the vulgar People have no great knowledg in Sil ver: and where there are no Changers , they will not receive a piece cl Silver, without putting it into the fire, to try whether it be good or no; And this is the Common practice at all Ferries and Palfages over Rivers. In regard their Boats are only made of Ofier, covered over with an Ox-hide, and by confequence are Very light ^ they keep them in the Woods, and wdll not take them upon their Shoulders, till they have received their Money. ^ . . •. As for their Gold, the Merchants have fo many cunning tricks to hide it, thatit feldom comes to the knowledg of the Cultomers. They do all they can to Ihift off paying the Cuftomsj and that, fo much the rather, becaufe they do notrunfotnudi hazard as at the cStom-houfe of Europe. For in the Indian Cuftom-houfes, if man be caught in the fraud, he is quitted by paying double } ten in the hundred. Mead of fi ve : the King comparing the venture of the Merchant to a game at Hazard , where he plays quit or double.

They found Gold about him, of Which he had already carried off feveral quantities, at feveral times, that he had gone from his Ship to the City j but they quitted him, upon paying the ufual Cuilom. The Engiijh-m^ vhx’dat fuch an affront, refolv’d to revenge himfelr, which he did after a very pleafant manner. He caus’d a fucking-pig to beroafled,- and putting it together with the dripping, and fawce, in a Cto^-platter, covered with a Imnen-cloath, he gave it a Slave to bring along after him to the City^ * D imaginingi8 Travels' i« I n d i a. j fo II. imagining what would fall out.

The Tradeoff formerly very great, begins now to decay, becaiife the Mouth of the River vm®’ more dangerous, and full of lhallows every day more than other, the Wum having almoft choak’d it up. The Englifi finding they had team’d the trick of rifling their Cloatlis fludi’r) out other little ways and contrivances to conceal their Gold: And the fafhion n f wearing Pernwigs being newly come out of Europe, th 6 y hid theit Jacobus, hi Nobles, and Ducats in the Net of their Perriwigs, every time they came a-(hore There was a Merchant that had a mind to convey fome Boxes of Coral inm Suratt, without the knowledge of the Cuftomers. He Swam then into the Town fome days before the Ship was unladen, when it might be done fecurely before the Cutomers had any fufpmon of any thing. But the Merchant repented him afterwards, the Commodity being fpoyl’d. For the Water of River bek always thick and muddy, there clung to the Coral, which had Iain a Iona time in the Water, a flime like a white cruft or skin, which was difficult to be sot off- io that after the ooral was polilh d, he loft by it above twelve per Cent. ’ I come now to the Money which goes for currant through the whole extent of the GveatMogul s Dominions; and to all the forts of Gold and Silver, whichis earn d thither m Ingots to make profit thereof. In the firfl place you mull obferve that it is very profitable to buy Gold and i ver w ich has been wrought, to melt it into Ingots^ and to refine it to the iiighelt purity: For being refin’d, you pay not for the Portage of the Alloy, which was mix d with it before: And carrying the Gold and Silver in Wedges,you pay Fnuce nor to the Mint what they exadt for Coinage. If you carry coin d Gold, the bell Pieces are Jacobus’s^ Rofe-Nobles, Albert us andotheranci- ent Pieces, as well oi Port ugal y as of other Countries, and all forts of Gold that aye been com d m former Ages. For by all thofe old Pieces the Merchant is ui e to guiru You may alfb reckon for good Gold , and which is proper to be earn d thither, all the Ducats of Germany^ as well thofe coin’d by the feveral Prin ces, as by the Imperial Towns , together with the Ducats ot Poland , bwedelandjmd and indeed all forts of Ducats are taken to be of the iame goodnefs. The Venetian Ducats of Gold formerly pafs’d for the bell, and were worth four or five of our Sous^ more than any others; but about a dozen ^ rs 4§° t ^ le y feeui to have been alter’d, not going now for any more than the relt. 1 here are alio Ducats which the Grand Seignior Coins at Cairo^ and thofe of Sally and Morocco : But tfiefe three forts are not To good as the others, and are not vrorth fo much as they by four Sous of our Money. * Empire of the Great Mogul, all the Gold and Silver is weigh’d with Weights, which they call To Ha which weigh nine Deneers, and eight grains oi our Weights. When they have any quantity ofGold and Silver to fell, the/#- ' h1ns u e yellow Copper-Weights, with the King’s mark, to avoid coufenage. And withBook I. Travels in India. widi thefe Weights they weigh all the Gold and Silver at once, providedlta- mount not to above a hundred Tolies. For tHe Changers have no other weights’’ but from one TolU to a hundred ^ and a hundred TolUs come to 38 Ounces^ 21 Deneers, and 8 Grains. As for the Gold and Silver which is not coin’d, if there be much, they eflay if, and having put it to the Touch, they bid to the utmoll yalue to out-vye one another. In regard there are fome Merchants that have above forty or fifty thou- find Ducats at a time, the Indians weigh them with a weight which is juft the weight of a hundred Ducats, which is alfo mark’d with the Kings Mark5 and if the hundred Ducats weigh lefs than the weights, they put in fo many lit tle Hones till the Scales are even \ and after all is weigh’d, they make good to the Changer the weight of thofe little Hones. But before they weigh thefe Gold- Coins* whether they be Ducats or other Pieces, they put the whole quantity in to a Charcoal-fire, till they be red-hot} and then quench the Fire with water ,and take them out again. This they do to find out them which are falfe,and to melt off the Wax and Gum,which is cunningly dropt upon them to make them weigh the more. But becaufe there are fome Pieces fo artfully hollow’d and ftopt up again, that you cannot perceive it, though they have been in the fire, the Changers take the Pieces, and bend them-, by which they know whether they be good or no 3 and thofe which they fufped they cut in pieces. After they have viewed them all, they refine thofe which they do not take to be good, and pay for fo much as proves to be good, as for good Ducats. All this Gold they Coin into that fort of Money which they call Roupies of Gold ^ except thofe Ducats, which are ftamp’d only up on one fide, which they fell to the Merchants that come from Tartary % and other Northern Parts, as from the Kingdoms of Boittan^Afen^ and other remote parts* With thefe Ducats the Women of thofe Countries chiefly adorn themfelves, hanging them upon their Head-attire, and fixing them upon their foreheads. As for the other Ducats, that have no figures, they are not fo much as enquir’d after by the Northern Merchants. As for all the other Pieces of Gold , there are great quantities of them Sold to the Goldfmiths, to the Gold-wyar-drawers, and in general to all that work in Gold. For if they could put their Metal unmade into Roupies, they would never Coin * which they can only do at the Coronation of their Kings, to throw Silver Roupies among the Peopley or to fell them to the Governours of the Provinces,/and other Grandees of the Court, who then want great quantities of them to prefent to the new King at his firft coming to his Throne. For they have not always Jewels or other things rich enough to prefent him, as well at that time, as at another Feftival, of which I lhall fpeak in diie place, when they weigh the King every year. At fuch times 1 fay, they are very glad of Gold Roupies} us alfo to prefent to fuch Favourites at the Court, by whofe intereft they hope to gain higher Commands, and more confiderable Go vernments. j - i! \ _ : \ .: / In one of my Travels, I found by experience the vertue of thefe Roupies of Gold. Cha-jehan^ Father of Orang-z.eb who now Reigns, had given to one of the Lords of his Court, the Government of the Province of Tata , whereof Symdi is the Metropolis. Now though the very firft year of his Government, there were very great complaints made againft him, by reafon of the Tyranny which he exercifed over his People, and his great extortions, the King fuffered him to continue four years, and then recalled him. All the People of were overjoy’d, believing the King had called him away, only to put him to death 7 wit it fell out quite otherwife} for the King carefs’d him, and gave him the Government of Halabas , more confiderable than that which he had quitted. ms kind reception, which he had at the Kings hands, proceeded from this, that before he came to Agra, he had fent before him a prefent of 50000 Roupies 0 Gold, and about 20000 Roupies of Gold more to Begum-Saheb^ who had then t e whole Power in her hands j as alfo to other Ladies and Lords at the Court, 0 upport his Reputation. All the Courtiers are very defirous to have a great quantity of Gold ^ becaufe it lies in a little room, and then becaufe they covet, ss a great Honour, to leave vaft Sums behind them, td their Wives and Chil- ten, of which the King moft not know. For as I fliall tell you in another place, * 3 D ^ N whenTraveh in I n D i A. Part II. when any great Lord dies, the King is Heir to all his Eftate * his Wife havin no more then his Jewels. v ® But to return to our Roupes of Gold v you muft take notice, that they a r not fo currant among the Merchants. For in regard one of them is not worth above fourteen Roapef , which make one apd twenty Livres of our Money ar thirty Sous the Roupe^ and that there are few of thefe Roupks of Gold to b had, but in the Houfes of Great Men ^ when it falls out that they make any pay! ment, they will put them at a Rome of Silver, or at lealt at a fourth part of a Ronpe more than it is worth, which will never turn to the Merchants profit Cha-Eft-Kan the King’s Uncle, to whom I had fold a parcel of Goods at 5x5000 Roupies, when he came to pay me, ask’d me what Money I would be content to take, whether Gold or Silver. Before I could return him an anfwer, he added that if I would leave it to him, I fhould take Gold Routes: Nor did he give 1^ this advice, but becaufehe believ’d it would turn to his advantage : I told him I would be rul’d by him} thereupon he caus’d his Servants to tell me out fo ma ny Roupies in Gold, as made up the julb Sum which was due: But he would force me to take the Ronpie in Gold for fourteen Roupks and an half in Silver, though among the Merchants they went blit for fourteen. I was not ignorant of it * but I thought it bqft to receive my Money according to the Prince’s humour, in hopes he might make me amends another time, either for the whole, or part of what I might lofe. I let him alone two days, after which I went to him again, and told him I had tried to put off his Ronpies at the price I had received them; fothat in the payment of 5)6000 Rottpies^ I had loft 3428 and one 16th. the Ronpieof Gold which he forc’d me to to take at fourteen Roupits and an half of Silver be ing worth but fourteen. Thereupou he fell into a paflion, and told me he would fee as many Lalhes beftow’d upon the Changer, or /MW-Broker, whofe fault fo- ever it were} that he would teach them to underftand Money} that they were old Ronpies, and were worth more by a fixteenth part of a Silver Ronpc than the Roupies which were coin’d at that time. In regard I knew the humour of the Afmtc Princes, with whom there is no coutefting. I let him fay what he pleas’d} but when he came to himfelf, and began to put on a fmiling look, I de- lir’d him that he would be pleas’d to let me return the Summ which I had re*, ceived, the next day} or elfe that he would be plea’sd to pay me what was want ing, and that I would take a Roupie at i4and one \6th. lincehe afliir’dme they were worth fo much. ThePrince for a while gave me a feurvy look, notfo much as fpeaking one word. At length he ask’d me, whether I had ftill the Pearl, which he had refus’d to buy. I told him I had, and immediately pull’d it out of my Bofome, and gave it him. The Pearl was large, and of a good Water, but ill- fhap’d} which was the reafon he refus’d it before. When I had given it to him, well, faid he, let us talk no more of what is paft} how much will you have, in a word, for this Pearl ? ^ I ask’d him feven thoufand Roupies, and indeed rather than I would have carri’d it into France^ I would have taken three. If I give thee, laid he, leven thoufand Roupies for this Pearl, I lhall make thee amends for the lols thou complain ft of in the firft bargain. Come to Morrow, and I will give thee five thoufand Roupies^ and that’s very fair .* Thou fhalt have alfo a Calaat and an Horfe. I made my obeyfance to him, and defir’d him to give me aii Horfe that fhould be young, and fit for fervice, becaufe I had a great journey to take. The next day he fent me a Robe, a Cloak, two Girdles, and a Cap} which is all the Apparel that the Princes are wont to give to thofe to whom they intend any Honour. The Cloak and Robe was of Satin purfled with Gold; the two Girdles ftrip d with Gold and Silver} the Cap was of Calicut, dy’d into a Flame-colour) v?ith ftripes of Gold ‘ The Horfe had no Saddle, but was covered with a green Velvet foot-cloath, edg’d about with a fmall Silver-fringe. The Bridle was very ftrait, with Silver-ftuds in fame places. I believe the Hprfe had never been Back d} for fb fbon as I brought him to the //o//^W-Houfe, where I then lodg’d/ a young man got upon his Back} but he was no fboner on, but the Horfe flung and pranc’d at that rate, that having kick’d down an Hutt that flood in the Court, he had like to have kill’d the Hollander. Finding that fuch a Refty-Horfe was not for my turn, I fent him back to Cha-Eft-Kan^ and relating the Story to him, 1 told him I did not believe that he defir’d I fhould return into my Countrey toBook I. Travels in India. bring him hack fome rarities which I had promis’d him, as he made me be lieve he did. All the while I talk’d, he laugh’d, and afterwards fent for the Horfe which his Father in his life time us’d to ride upon. It was a tall Per- fm Horfe, that had formerly coll five thoufand Crowns, but was then twenty eight years old. They brought him bridl’d and faddi’d, and the Prince would needs have me get up in his prefence. He had one of the moil fiately walks that ever I knew in a Horfe : and when I alighted, well, faid he, art thou fa- tisfied ? I dare fay, that Horfe will never give thee a fall. I thank’d him, and at the fame time took my leave of him ^ and the next day, before my departure, he fent me a great Basket of Apples. It was one of the fix that Cha- jeban had fent him, as they came from the Kingdom of Kaehemir - 7 there was in the Basket alfo a great Perfian Melon .* All this might be worth a hundred Roupics, which I prefented to the Holland Commanders Wife. As for the Horfe I rode him to Golconda, where I fold him for five hundred Roupies as old as he was, being a good lulty Beall. To return to our difeourfe of Money , I will add this to what I have faid already , that you mull never carry Loms s, of Gold to the Indies 7 nor tyanty nor Italian Pillols, nor any other fort of Money coin’d within thefe few years } for there is great lofs by it * for the Indians refine all, and count only upon the refinings. Laltly , every one Itrives to Real the cuRom of their Gold j and when the Merchant, has got the knack of concealing it, he may gain five or fix of our Sous in every Ducat. I come now to'the forts of Silver Money; which you muR diRinguilh in to money of the Country, and Forreign Money; And firR of the Forrekn Coins. The Forreign Silver Coins which are carried into the Indies, are the Rix- dollars of Germany ,the ReaR of Sfam. The firR are brought by the Merchants that come from Poland, from the Lefler Tartary, and the Borders of Mufco- w. The others by thofe that come from Confiantmople, Smyrna, and and the greateR part by the Armenians, who fell their Silk into Europe. All thefe merchants endeavour to convey their Silver through Perfia without be ing difeovered; for if the Cuftomers find it out, they will be forced to carry their Silver to the Mint-MaRers to be coined into A&amp;affis, which is the Rings Coin; thefe Abafts being carried into India, are again coined into Rou pies, whereby the Merchant lofes ten and a quarter per Cent, as well bv reafon of the coinage, as by paying the Kings duties in Perfia. To let youunderRand in a few*words, how they came to lofe this ten and a quarter per Cent. from Perfia to the Indies, and fometimes more, according to the nature of the Reals, which they ufually carry into Perfia ; you muR call to mind, what I have already faid concerning the Money and Exchanges of Perfia, in the firR Volume. I oblerv’d, that a Real in Perfia goes for 2 3 which make three Abafts, and a quarter ; and that fometimes , when' Silver is feavee, they will give a Chaez. and a half for one. That the Abaft is worth four Chaez, and the Toman fifty Abafts, or two hundred Chaez. if you carry fix Tomans and a half to the Indies, you have for every Toman twenty nine Romes and a half; and confequently for fix Tomans and a half, a hundred and ninety-one Roupks and a quarter. If you carry to the Indies Reals of Sevile, a hundred you fhall have from 213 to 215 Roapies. If you carry Mexk car ! lor a hundred you lhall have no more than 212. So that when for a hundred Reals you have but two hundred and twelve Roupies, you gain ten eleve^p ^ liartcr ’ an ^w^red Reals; but by the Sevillim Reals you profit are ^ ir . ee or f° ur f° rt:s °l Spanijh Reals, and they give for a hundred rCordmg to their goodnefs, from 218 to 21 4 and 215 Roapks. The beR of all died ..p m/ f ° r the &gt; T are tul1 they will give for a hun- pkntiful 3 ’ an&lt; ^ ^ omet i mes 21 5 ? according as Silver is either fcarce or m of Spain ought to weigh three Drams, feven Grains and a half the iari . Uvo Tmpks. But the Silver of the Ronpks is much better. For ls m weight eleven Deneers and fourteen Grains; but the Sevil Real,22 Travels /» i n d i a. Pan'll Rea^ like our white Crown, is but juft eleven Deneers. The at ten Deneers and twenty-one Grains. For the Spamjh Real that w feventy-three Vais, you have four Mamoudi’s and a half, and one Mamou^ • worth twenty Pecha’s ^ but they muft be very good, and as I have faid alrerl 18 feventv-three Vais in weight: eightv-one Vais making: an Onnr^ feventy-three Vais in weight: eighty-one Vais making an Ounce, oneVal r ing to feven Deneers. 0rn ~ For the Rixdollars of Germany^ in regard they are heavier than the Reals th will give you for an hundred, as high as an hundred and fixteen Roupies \Vh ' you are to take notice, that in giving for an hundred Reals, or an hundred K* dollars, two hundred and fifteen, or two hundred and fixteen Roupies, ft f e lZ l that every Roupy ought to be worth lefs than thirty Sous. But if the Merch^t count the Portage of the Silver, and the Cuftoms, he will find that ever? Rn ^ will Hand him in more. But that the Merchant may make his profit, hemufhaS notice, that all the Reals of Mexico, and thofe of Sm/, are in weight one and twenty Deneers and eight Grains, that is, five hundred and twelve Grains • and for thofe that are no better then our white Crown, they are to be in weighton and twenty Deneers and three Grains, which makes five hundred and nine Grains 6 All Dollars and Reals are weigh’d, a hundred at a time, and when they are want ing in weight, they add little ftones, as when they weigh Gold, according to what I fhall tell you by and by; We come now to the Money of the Country. Thz Indian Money is the Silver Roupy, the Half, Quarter, Eighteenth and Sixteenth part. The weight of the Roupy is nine Deneers and one Grainy the value of the Silver is eleven Deneers and fourteen Grains. They have alfo another fort of Silver Money, which they call Mamoudi’s, but this goes no-where but in Surat^ and in the Province^ Guz.erat. The Indians have alfo a fort of fmall Copper Money, which is call’d Pecha- which is worth about two of our Liards, a Liard being the fourth part of a Sous. There is alfo the Half Pecha, Two Pecha’s, and Four Pecha’s. Accor ding to the cuftom of the Province where you Travel, you have for a Roupy of Silver more or lefs of thefe Pecha’s. In my laft Travels, a Roupy went at Surat for nine and forty Pecha’s. But the time was, when it was worth fifty, and another time, when it went but for fix and forty. At Agra and G(. hanabat ^, the Roupy was valued at fifty-five and fifty-fix Pechas. And’the reafon is, becaufe the nearer you go to the Copper Mines, the more Pecha’s you have for a Roupy. As for the Mamoudi, it is always valued at forty Pecha’s. There are two other forts of fmall Money in the Dominions of the Great Mo- guU, which are little bitter Almonds and Shells.. Thefe little bitter Almonds, which are brought out of Per fa are only made ufe of in the Province of 6 me- ratt j as I have obferved in the firft part of my Relations. They grow in dry and barren places artiongft the Rocks, and the Tree, that bears them, is almofl like our Ballard Spanijh-Broom. They call thefe Almonds Baden: -Nor is there any Coloquintida fo bitter. They give for a Pecha fometimes thirty five, and foine- times forty. Their other fmall Money are the little Shells which they call Cori ^ the iides whereof turn circularly inward: Nor are they to be found in any part of the World, but in the Maldives Iflands. They are the greateft part of the Revenue of the King of that Ifland. For they are tranfported into all the Territories of the Great Mogull^ into the Kingdoms of Vifapmr and Golconda } and into the Iflands of America to ferve inftead of Money. Near the Sea they give 80 fora Pecha. ^ But the^ further you go from the Sea, the lefs you have} fo that at Agra, they will not give you above 50 or $5 for a Pecha. As to wbat remains accord ing to the Accompt of the Indians^ 100000 Roupies make a Lekke. 100000 Lekks make a Kraur. 100000 Kraur’s makea Padan. 1 00000 Padan’s make a Ril. in the Indies^ the Village muft be very fmall, where there does not reflde a Ban- ^er, whom they call Cberaff, whofe bufinefs it is to remit Money and Bills of Exchange.pay yoti in Roupes coin’d fome fifteen or twenty years ago- and upward ^ where* by you will lofe four in the hundred. For they will have one fourth, or at leall one eighth yer Cent, allow’d for thofe that were coin’d but two years before: So that the poor People,that cannot read the year wherein xhz Roufks were coin’d are fubjedt to be cheated y for they will always abated Pbcha or a half aPeehl upon a Roupie, or three of four don's upon a Pecha. As for counterfeit Silver, there is very little amongH them. Ifyqu receive one falfe Roiipte in a Bagg from any particular Perfon,* ’tis better to cut it to pieces, and lofe it, than to fpeak of it *, for if it fhould come to be known, there might be danger in it. For-you are commanded by the Kings Law to return the Bagg where you received it y and to return it from one to another, till you can find out the Counterfeiter 5 who if he be,apprehended, is only fentenc’d to lofe hi s hand. If the Counterfeiter cannot be’ 1 found, and that ft be thought that he who paid the Money is not guilty, he is acquitted upon fome fmall amerce meiit' This brings great profit to the Changers. For v/hen there is any Sum of Money receiv’d or paid, the Merchant^aufe him to loqFit over, and for their pains,.r they have one fixteenth of a Roupie in the hundred. I As for the Money which is paid out of the Sarcjuetj or Kings Exchequer, there is never any found that is counterfeit: ForalltheMoneythatis earn’d in thither, is exadly view’d by the. Kings Bankers The Great Lords have alfo,their par ticular Bankers. Before they put up the Money intoThe Treafuty, they throw it into a great CharcoaLfire, and when the Ronpies are red-hot, they quench the fire, by throwing watermpon it y and then take out the Money. If there be any Piece that is white^ or that has the leaft mark of Alloy, it is prefently cut in pieces. As often as thefe Romes are carried into the Treafury, they mark the Pieces with a Puncheon, which makes an hole, but!not quite through ^ and there are Tome Pieces that have feven or eight holes made in that manner, tq.ihew that they have been fo manyTimes in the Exchequer. They are all put, a thoufand Pieces together, in a Bagg, feal’d witjiThe Seal of the great Treafurer, and the number of years fuperferib’d, fince they were coin’d. And here you are to take notice, whence the Treafurersprofit arifes, as well that of the Kings Trea furer, as that of the particular Treafurcrs of the Great Lords of the Kingdom. When there is any'bargain made, They agree for new Roupies coin’d the fame year: but when they come to receife the'payment, the Treafurers will make it in old Rottpies^ wherein there is a jofs of fix per Cent. So that if they will have new Silver, the Merchants muft compound with the Treafarer. In my fifth Voy age, I went to vifit Cba-Rft^Kan according to my promife, to let him have the £rft fight of what 1 brought along with me. So that as foon as I arriv’d at Su« ran, I lent him word j and received his Orders to meet him at Choupan, a City in the Province of Decan 7 to which he had laid Siege. Coming to him, in a lit tle time, and a few words, I fold him the greatefl: part of what I had brought along with me out of Europe : And he told me that he expected every day,that Money fhould be fent him from Sur an to pay the Army, and to pay me alfo at the fame time for what he had bought of me I could not imagin however, that fo great a Prince as he, that commanded fo great an Army,had not ftore of Money by him j but rather conjedur’d, that he had an intention to make me fome abatement, up on thofe Pieces which he would put upon me in payment, as he had ferv’d me be fore. It fell out, as I forefaw. But for Provifions for my felf, my men, and my Horfes, he took fuch order, that there was great plenty brought me, night and morning, and for the molt part he fent forme my felf, to his own T able_ den or twelve days thus paft away, and ndt a word of the Money that I expected : bo that being Tefolv’d to take my leave of him, I went to his Tent. He appear d to be fomewhat furpriz’d, and looking upon me with a frowning-brow .* wherei 0 ^ will you be gone, faid he, before you are paid ? or who d’you think, mail pay you afterwards,if you go away before you receive your Money? Uponthele wor s, with a countenance as Item as his, my King, replied I, will fee me paid, born goodnefs is fuch, that he caufes all his Subjeds to be pai$j that have not recei ^ latisfadion for fuch Goods as they fell in Forreign Countries. And what co will be take, anfwer’d he in a great choler: with two or three flout Men oi ? laid I, which he will fend cither to the Port of Snratt, or towards the coa ^I*. Book 1. Travels in India. glad of that, becaufe it was a place through which I was to pals in my vyay to Golcanda } betides that, it woiild Ipare me the carriage and the hazards of mv Money. The next day I had my Bill of Exchange, and-took leave of,the Prince who was nothing difpleafed, but told me,that if I returned'to the Mies I ihould not fail to come and fee him, which I did in my lixth and laft Voyage. ’When I came to SnTott^ he was at ^c^^/^,where I fold himall the reft of my Goods that I could not put off either to the King of Perfia, or great Mogul. But to return to the payment of my Money, I was nofooner arrived at Aurenv- gabat, but I Went to find the great Treafurer • who nd fooiier faw me,but he told rne, he knew wherefore I came ^ that he had recei ved Letters of advice three days beloie, and that he had already taken the Money oup of the Trealury to pa^ me. When he had brought me all the Baggs, 1 taufed my Banker to open them who faw them to be Roupies, by which 1 was to lofe tw&lt;^in the hundred. Upon that I thank d the Treafurer very heartily, telling him, I imderftood no fuch deal ing, and that I would fend and complain of him to Ch^Efl-Kum •- and declare to him that he ihould either give order that I fhould be paid in new Silver, or elft let me have my Goods again, whichlprefently did. But not receiving an anfwer fa foon as I knew I might have done, I went to the Treafurer, android him, I would go my felf, and fetch away my Goods. I believe he had received or der what to do yfor feeing I was refolved to go} he told me he was very unwilling I Ihould put my felf to fo much trouble, and that it would be better for us to agree among our felves. After many contefts about the two in ,the hundred, which he Vvould have made me lofe, I was contented to abate one, and had loft the other, had I not happily met with a Banker who wanted Silver, and had a Bill of Ex change to pay ztGolconda * fo that he was glad to make ufeof mine, and gave me a Kill to be paid at Gokonda, being my full Summ, at fifteen day slight. „ r * ]e Changers to try their Silver, make ufe of thirteen little pieces, one half topper, and the other Silver, which are their Sayes. * ETravels in India, Part. II. Thefe thirteen pieces differing all in ^goodnefs* they never make but when any queftion arifes concerning a fmall q uantity of Silver, or if a n wrought Silver’. For they refine all their great quantities. All that kind of Silv is brought by the weight which they call Tolla^ which weighs nine Deneers and eight Grains, or 32 Val’s^ 81 Vars,making an Ounce: Sothatan hundred Toll/ making 38 Ounces, 21 Deneers, and 8 Grains. s See here the differences of the thirteen Goodneffes of Silver. T He firft, which is the loweft goodnefs, they take at fifteen Pecha’s to the Molla, which makes of our Money nine Sous, two Deneers. The fecond, at eighteen Pecha’s, which make ten Sous two Deneers. The third, at ten Pecha’s, which make twelve Sous,fix Deneers. The fourth, at thirteen Pecha’s, which make fourteen Sous, fix Deneers. The fifth, at fixteen Pecha’s, which make fifteen Sous, ten Deneers. Thefixth, at nineteen Pecha’s, which make feventeen Sous,fix Deneers. The feventh, at thirty-three Pecha’s, which make nineteen Sous, two De neers. The eighth, at thirty-five Pecha’s, which make twenty Sous, ten Deneers. The ninth, at thirty-eight Pecha’s, which make twenty-two Sous, fix De- neers. The tenth at forty Pecha’s, which make twenty-four Sous, ten Deneers. The eleventh, at forty-three Pecha’s, which make twenty-five Sous, ten De neers. The twelfth, at forty-fix Pecha’s, which make twenty-feven Sous, fix Deneers. The thirteenth, at forty-nine Pecha’s, which make nineteen Sous, two De- neers. , Here it will not be amifs to give you an hint, how far the cunning extends,not only of the Cherajfs or Changers, but of all the Indians in general $ and it Hull fuffice to give you one example, which is very particular, and of which our Europeans make no account: Which is this &gt; that of all the Gold, which re mains upon the ftone upon which they make the Efiay, and of which we make no reckoning, they are fo far from lofing the leaft atome of that fmall matter, that they fetch it all off, by means of a Bull made half of Black-pitch, and half of Soft-wax, with which they rub the ftone that carries the Gold ; at the end of feme years the Ball will fhine,and teen they get out all the Gold that flicks to it This Ball is about the bignefs of one of our Tennis-Balls} and the Stone is fuch a one as our Goldfmiths generally ufe. Thus much of the Cuftom-houfes and Money currant among the Indians. It remains to fpeak of their, manner of Exchange. As all the Goods which are made in the Empire of the Great Moguls and fome part of the Kingdoms o£ Golccndazn&amp;Vifapeur arpTrought to Sur an to k tranfported into feveral parts of u 4 (ia and Europe ^ the Merchants, when they go from Surat to buy Gommodities in the feveral Cities where they are made, as at Labor^ j 4 gra r ylmadjibaty Sermgej Brampour^ Dqca^Eatna, Baftarous, Golconda Decan, Fifapour, andyi)^to ? :Takt -up,MQnef and are djfcharg’dat the places where they go, by giving?kind for kind.

' - From Vi favour at three. From Ddtabat, from one to one and an half. Some years the Exchange rifes from one to two fer Cent, by reafon of certain Raja’s or petty VafTal Princes that dilturb Trade, every one pretending that the Mechandizes ought to pafs through his Countrey, and pay Toll. There are two particularly between Agra and Amadabatt, the one called the Raja of Antivar^ and the other the of Bergam^ who very much mol eft the Merchants for this very caufe. But you may avoid paffing through the Territories of thefe Prin ces, taking another road from Agra to Saratt, thorough Seronge and Brampur. But they are fertil Lands, divided with feveral Rivers, without Bridges or Boats, and it is impoflible to go that way, till two Months after the rains are fallen. Which is the reafon that thofe Merchants who mult be at Suratt when thefeafon permits them to take the Sea, are forc’d to pafs through the Territories of thefe two Raja!s, becaufe they can pafs that way at all times, even in the time that the rains fall, which only knit and harden the Sand. Nor are you to wonder that the Exchange runs fo high} for they that trull out their Money, run the hazard, by obligation, of loling their Money, if the Mer chants Ihould be robb’d. , When you come to Shy an to Embarque, there is Money enough. For it is the greateft Trade of the Grandees of the Indies to venture their Money by Sea from thence for Qrmm, Balfara^ and Moccd j nay even as far as Bantam^ Acben^ and the Philippine Iflands. For Mecca and B Afar a, the change runs from 22 to 24.per Cent. And to Ornws^ from \6 to 20. And to the other places which I have nam ed, the change runs proportionable to the diltance. I have but one word to fay of their Weights and Meafures *, I have given you in the Margin the fifth part of an Ell of Agra, and the fourth part of an Ell of Amadabat and Suratt. As for their Weights, the Men is generally 69 Pound,and the Pound 1 &lt; 5 Ounces. But the Men which they weigh their Indigo withal, is but 53 Pound. At Suratt xkvp talk of a Serre, which is one and three fourths of a Pound, and the Pound is 16 Ounces. CHAP. HI. Of'l eir Carriages^ and the manner of Travelling in India, B Efore you fet forward upon the road, it will be convenient tofpeak of their Carriages and manner of travelling in India , which, in my opinion, is more commodious than,any thing that has been invented for eafe in France or Italy. Quite otherwife it is in Per fa, where they neither make ufe of Afles, Mules, or Horfes, but tranfport all their Wares to the Indies upon Oxen, or in Wains, their Countries being fo near to one another. If any Merchant carries an Horfe out of Perfia, ’tis only for Ihewi, or to walk in his hand, or to fell to fbme Indian Prince. ■ ~ , , They will lay upon an Oxes back 300,0? 350 pound weight,and it is no won derful thing to fee ten .or twelve thoufand Oxen at a time all laden with Rice, Corn and Salt, in fuch places where they exchange thofe Commodities: Carrying Corn where only Rice grows, Rice where only Corn grows, and Salt where there is none an all They make ufe of Camels fometimes, but very rarely, they being particularly appointed to carry the luggage of great Perfonages. When the fea- lon requires hall, and that they would fpeedily conveigh their Merchandize to buratt to (hip them off, they load them upon Oxen, and not in Wains. And in re gard that the Territories of the Great Mogul are very well manur’d, the Fields * E z • are:Travels in India. Part Ip are fenc’d with very good Ditches} and to every Field there belongs a Pond to preferve the water. This is this great inconvenience for 1 ravellers; that when they meetaWith theie numerous Caravans in jfreight places,, they are forc’d to ftay two or three days till they are allpaft by.They that drive thefe Oxen,follow ‘ no other Calling as long as they live, nor do they dwell in houfes 5, yet they carry their Wives and Children along with them. There are fome among them that have an hundred Oxen of their own, others more or lefs ; and they have always one who is their Chief, that takes as much ftate as a Prince,and has his Chain of Pearl hanging about his neck.When the Caravan that carries the Corn, and that which carnes the Salt happen to meet, rather than yield the road, they frequently enter into very bloody Difputes. The Great Mognll conftdering one day that thefe quarrels were very prejudicial to Trade,and the tranfportanon of necellary Pro. vitals from place to place, fent for the two Chiefs of the Caravan, and after he had exhorted them, for the common good and their own intereft, to live quietly together, and not to quarrel and light when they met, gave to each of them a Leek, or an hundred thoufand Roupies, and a Chain of Pearl. That the Reader may the better underltand the manner of Travelling in the /«. Mcs, he is to take notice, that among the Idolaters of that Country there are four Tribes, which are called Manarfs, each of which may couiift of an hundred thou fand Souls. Thefe people live always in Tents,and live only upon the tranfporting of Merchandize from Countrey to Countrey. The firft of thefe Tribes carry no thing but Corn, the fecond Rice, the third Pulfe, and the fourth Salt, which they fetch from Suratt^xd all along from as far as Cafe-Ca?norin. Thefe Tribes are alfo diftinguifhed in thi s manner; Their Priefts, of whom I ihall fpeak in another place, mark the forheads of the firft, with a red-Gum, about the bredth of a Crown j and then they draw a ftreak all the length of his nofe,fticking grains o( Wheatuponit, fometimes ten, and fometimes twelve. Thofe ofthe fecond Tribe are mark’d with yellow-Gumin the fame place,with grains of Rice. Thofe of the third are mark’d with a grey-Gum, down to the fiioulders, and grants of Millet. Thofe of the fourth Tribe carry tied about their necks a Bagg, with a great lump of Salt in it, weighing fometimes eight or ten pounds, (for the hea vier it is,, the more they glory in carrying it j) and with this Bagg they thump their ftomacks, as a fign of repentance every morning before they fay their Pray ers. They have all in general a little line or twift,like a Scarf,about their necks, , at the end whereof hangs a little Silver-box, like a Relique-box, wherein they enclofe a little fuperftitious writing which their Priefts give them ; they tie them alfo about their Oxen and other Cattel, which are bred in their Herds,for which they have a particular affedion,and love them as tenderly as children, efpecially if they have no children of their own. Their Women wear only a piece of Ca licut white or painted, fome fix or five times doubled from their wafts down ward. From their wafts upward they cut their flefh into feveral forms of Flowers, as they do that apply Cnpping-glalTes, which they paint in various colours with the juice of Grapes, that their skin feems to be all made of Flowers- Every morning,while the men load the Beafts,and that the Women fold up the Tents, the Priefts that follow them, fet up in the moft convenient place of the Plain where they lodg’d a certain Idol in the form of a Serpent in wrea'hs, upon a Perch fix or feven foot high \ to which they come all in files to worlhip,their Women going three times about. After the Ceremony is over, the Priefts take tare of the Idol, and load it upon an Ox particularly appointed for that pnr- pofe. The Caravan of Waggons feldom exceeds the number of an hundred or two hundred at moft. Every Waggon is drawn by ten or twelve Oxen} and attended by four Souldiers, which the Perfon that ows the Merchandize isoblig’d to pay. Two of them march upon each fide of the Waggon, over which there are two Ropes thrown a-crofs, the ends whereof they hold in their hands, to the end, that if the Waggon come to leane on one fide in ill-way, the two Souldiers on the other Tide may keep ft from over-turning by pulling the Ropes with all their ftrength. All the Waggons that come to Suratt, either from or any other parts of the Empire, and which return through Agra^ or Janabatt^ are bound to carryBOOK I. 1 ravelr m India. back the Lime that comes from Barocha, which, after it is temper’d, and laid on becomes as hard as Marble. / 1 ’ on ? I come now to the manner of travelling in /W M , to which purpofe they make ufe ofOxen inftead of Horfes, and there are fome, whofe pace is as eafy as ?he amble of our Hackneys. But you muft take a care, when you either buy or W an Ox to n e “Pon, that the horns be not a bove a foot in length. For if they be longer, when the flies begin to ftmg, he will chafe, and tofsback his horns and fake them into the ftomack of the Rider, as oftentimes it has hapned. Thefe Oxen are rid like our Horfes, and initead of Snaffles or Bitts they have onl v a Rope drawn through the mufdy part of the muzzle or nollril . In firm ground where there are no ones, they never Ihooe their Oxen 5 but only in ronf h ph ces, where not only the ftones, but the heat will waft and chop the Lof Where to nXtTat Lbos fSRft h0 f n , S ’ th f a ^ick trufsupon tneii: necKs, tnat keeps ralta Coller of Leather lour lingers broad, which they Waggom 1 ' 8 L ° d ° bUt t0 PUt ab ° Ut Cheir neCks When thcy faften them t0 the 1 ney ufe alfo for Travel little Coaches, but very light, that will hold two perfons ; but generally they ride alone for more eafe, carrying only their ne- ceflary Cloak-Bags along with them; with a fmall Veflel'of'Wine, and a fmall quantity of Provifions, for which there is a proper place under the Coach where they tye the two Oxen. Thefe Coaches have their Curtains andSs like ours, yet are not hung: But in my laft Travels I caus’d one to be made after our manner j and the two Oxen that drew it, coft me near upon fix-hundred Roupies. Nor is the Reader to wonder at the price; for there are fome of nc e Oxen that are very ftrong, and that will travel upon the trot twelve or fifteen leagues a-day for fixty days together.

It is now time to travel from Surat to Jgra, and Janabat, and to obferve what is moft remarkable upon the Road. C H A P. IV. / The Roadfrom Surat to Agra, through Rrampour and Seronge. I Am no lefs well acquainted with all the principal Roads that lead to the chief Cities in India, than thofe of Turkey and Terfia ; for in fix times that I have travell’d from Paris to Ifpakan, I have gone twice for one from Iffahan to Agra, and many other places of the Great Mogul's Empire. But it would be tirefome to the Reader to carry him more than once the fame way, on purpofe to make a relation of every particular journey, and the accidents that accompany them; And therefore let it fuffice to give an exaft defeription of the Roads, without parti cularizing the diftindt times that I went. There are but two Roads from Surat to ulgra, one through Bramyour and St- ronge, the other through ulmadabat. The firft fhall be the Subject of this Chap ter. From Surrat to Barnoly, coftes ' *4 Barnoly is a great Borough/Town, where you are to ford a great River j and this firft days journey you crofs a mixt Countrey, part Wood, through Fields of Wheat and Rice. * From Barnoly to Bah or, coftes 10 Bahor is aifo a large Village upon a Lake, about a league in compafs. Upon the fide whereof is to be feen a good fubftantial Fortrefs y though there be no ufe made of it. Three quarters of a league on this fide the Village you ford a fmall River, though not without , great difficulty, by reafon of the Rocks and Stones that hazard the over-turning of the Coach. This fecond days journey you travel almoft altogether through Woods From Balor to Kerkoa, or as it is call’d at this day, CarvanferaAe U Begitra, coftes * _ . &gt; This Carvanfera or Inn is very large and commodious y being built out oi Cha rity by Begum-faheb the Daughter of Cha-jehan. For formerly the journey froni Balor to Navafoura was too great .* And this place being upon the Frontiers oi thofe Baja's that fometimes will not acknowledge the Great Mogul, whofe Vaflals they are, there was no Caravan that paft by which was notabufed \ belidesthat it is a wooddy-Country. Between Carvanjera and Navafoura you ford a Ri- ver^ as alfo another very neer to Navagoura. Prom Kerkga to Navapoura, coftizs , Navayoura is a great Town full of Weavers; but Rice is the greateft Coni- modity.of that place. There runs a River through the Country, which ma.e it very fruitful, and waters the Rice, that requires moifture. _ All the Rice wnic grows in this Country has one peculiar quality, that makes it more particular yBook L Trvvels in India. 9 74 7 IQ * 5 13 IQ 9 efleem’d.

There is alfo a great Caltle in the midlt of the City, where the Governour lies} the Government of this Province is a very confidera- ble command} and is only conferr’d upon the Son or Unckle of the King. And Aureng-wb, the prefent King, was a long time Governour of this Province in the Reign of his Father. But fince they came to underltand the Itrength of the Pro vince of Bengala, which formerly bore the Title of a Kingdom, that Province is now the moll confiderable in all the MoguPs Countrey. There is a great Trade in this City, and as well in Brampore^ as over a)l the Province, there is made a prodigious quantity of Calicuts very clear and white, which are tranfported into Ttrfa, Turkey and Mufcovia, Boland, Arabia, to Grand Cairo, and other places* There are fame which are painted with feveral colours, with flowers, of which the Women make Veils and Scarfs the fame Calicuts lerve for Coverlets of Beds, and for Handkerchiefs. There is another fort of Linnen which they never dye, with a llripe or two of Gold or Silver quite through the piece, and at each end from the breadth of one inch to twelve or fifteen,in fome more,in lomelefs, they fix a tiflue of Gold, Silver, and Silk, intermix'd with Flowers, whereof there ismo wrong-lide, both fides being as fair the one as the other. If thefe pieces, which they carry into Boland, where they have a valt utterance, want at each end three or four inches at the leall of Gold or Silver; or if that Gold or Silver become tarniflfd in being carried by Sea from Surat to Ortnus, and from Trebizan to Mangala, or any other parts upon the Black-Sea,.the Merchantdhall have much ado to put them off without great lofs.He mult take care that his goods hepackt up in goodBales^ that no wet may get in; which for fo long a Voyage requires great care and trouble. Some of thefe Linnens are made purpofely for Swathbands dr Shalhes, and thofe pieces are call’d Ornis. They contain from 1 S to 20 Ells; and colt from an hundred to an hundred and fifty Roupies,the leall, not being under tenor twelve ells.Thofe that are not above two ells long are worn hy the Ladies of Quality for Veils, and Scarfs, of which there is a vail quantity ven ded in and Turkey.TY&amp;y make at alfo other forts of Cotten-Linhen$ ror indeed there is no Province in all the Indies which more abounds in Cotton. ‘ When you leave the City of Brampoure, you mull pafs another River, befides that which I have mention’d already. There is no Bridge, and therefore when the Water is low, you ford itwhen the rains fall, there are Boats attending. From Surat to Brampour it is 132 Coltes} and thefe Colles are very Ihort in the Mies ^ for you may travel one of them in a Coach in lefs than an hour. 1 remember a It range tumult at Brampoure, in the year 1541, whent I re- urned from Agra to Surat the caufe whereof was thus, in fhort .* The Jjovernour of the Province, who was the King’s Nephew by the Mother’s-fide, ad among his Pages a young Boy that was very beautiful, and of a very good ^anuly, w ho had a Brother in the City that liv’d as a Dervkh , and for whom '• ^ allTravels in India. Part l]. all the Town had a very great veneration.One day the Governour, being alone in his Chamber, did all that lay in his power,by vertae of Gifts .and Carefles to have had'rhe life of his Body ; but the Boy detelbng his abominable purpofe, made his efcaoe from him,and came and told his Brother.l he .Dewcfc, without deliberating S Counfel he had to give his younger Brother, gave him a Sword, ftch a on» as he might eafily hide under his Garment; and told him that if the Governour urg’d him any more, that he fliould maive a fliew of complying with him but that when he went about to do the fad, he Ihould be fure to run him into the Guts. The Governour,. who knew nothing of what the Page had reveal’d to his Brother, ceas’d not every day to court him to confent to his infamous lull; and being one day alone with him in a fmall Apartment of „ Banouetting-Houfe, at the lower end of his Garden, he fent for his Page to fan hmi and to keep off the Flies, after the falhion of the Countrey; for it wds about noon, when every one goes to fleep. Then did the Governour begin again to prefs the young Page; and finding that he made no refinance, he thoueht he Ihould fuddenly accomplilh his defign. But the Page feeing him ready to commit the aft, ftab’d him three times into the Belly, before he could open his mouth to cry out for help. That done, the Page went out of the Palace without any difturbance in his countenance ^ io that the Guards believd that’the Governour had fent him out upon fome errand. The Der- virh- widerltanding by his Brother what had pafs’d, to faye him from the fury of the people and to difcover the Infamy of the Governour, caus’d the reft of th“ Dervnhs * his Companions, to take the Banners of Mahomet, that were planted round the Mofquee ^ and at the fame time with loud cries encourag’d all the reft of the Bervichs, Faquirs, and others that were good Mahumetm, to follow him. In lefs than an hours time he had got together an infinite multitude of the Rabble, and the Bervkh marching at the head of them, they made diredly to the Palace, crying out with all their might, Let us dye fit Mahomet or let us have that infamous ferfon deliver’d up into our hands, to the end the iflrs may eat him after hts death, not being worthy to be enterrd among the Muffelmem The Guard of the Palace was not in a condition to refill fo great a Multitude, fo that they mull have been forced to have yeilded to their fury* had riot the Beroga of the Town, and Ibme live or fix Lords, found away to make themfelves to be heard, and to appeafe them, by reprefenting to them* tS# ought to have fome refped to the Nephew of the King ; by that means obliging them to retire. That night the Body of the Governor was font to ^ 4 gra, with his ILaratn ^ aiid Cha-jehan, who then reign d, being inform’d of the accident, was not much troubl’d, becaufe he is Heir to all the goofeohis Subjects 5 and at the fame time he beftow’d upoa the Page a fmall Government in the Province of Bengala* Ffdrh Brampour to Piombi-fera, Coftes .

Whereas tliofe that are made at Seronge^ the more you walh them, the fairer the colours fhew. There runs a River by the City, the water whereof has that vertue, that it gives that beauty and liyelinefs to the colours. And all the while the rains fall, the Workmen will make thefe prints upon their Cottons, ac cording tothe Patterns which the Forreign Merchants give them 5 for when the waters are ceas’d, the water is the thicker; and the oftener they dip their Cali cuts, the better the colours hold. There is alfo made at Seronge another fort of Calicut, which is fb fine,that when a man puts it on, his skin lhall appear through it, as if he were naked. The Mer chants are not permitted to tranfport it. For the Governour fends it all to the £e- raglio. of the Great Mogul, and to the principal Lords of the Court. Of this, the Sultanelfes, and great Noblemen’s Wives make them Shifts and Garments in hot-weather: And the King and the Lords take great pleafure to behold them in thofe Shifts, and to fee them Dance with nothing elfe upon their Bodies. From Bramfore to Seronge is an hundred and one coftes, which are longer than thofe from Surat to Bramfore } for the Coach is a full hour, and fometiraes five quarters, going one of thefe coftes. In thefe hundred leagues of the Countrey you travel whole days journeys along by moft fertil Fields of Corn and Rice, be ing lovely Champaign, where you meet with very little Wood 5 and from Seronge to Agra, the Countrey is much of the fame nature : And becaufe the Villages lye thick together, your journey is the more pleafant; befides, that you may reft when you pleafe.

There are two Towers near the Town, upon the high-way,and round about the Towers are ^eral holes, like windows ^ and in every hole, two foot diftant one from ano- ther, there is fix’d a man s head.

At the entery thereof you fee the fuinsoftwoor three Caflles, and the Road is fo narrow, that two Waggons can hardly go a brefl. They that come from the South to go to Jgra, as from Su rat, Goa, Fifafore, Golconda, Mafltpatan, and other places, cannot avoid thefe flreights, there being no other Road but this, efpecially if you take the Road from Amadabat. Formerly there was a Gate at each end of the flreight and at that end which is next to Hgra, there are five or fix Shops of Banians' that fell Flower, Butter, Rice, Herbs and Pulfe. In my lafl Travels I flaid at oneof thefe Shops, to tarry for the Coaches and Waggons, all the Pafiengers alighting at the foot of the Streights. Not far off there is a great Magazin full of fads of Rice and Corn} and behind every fack lay a Serpent thirteen or fourteen foot long, and proportionable in bignefs. A Woman that went to fetch Corn out of one of thofe facks, was bitten by one of thofe Serpents, and perceiving her felf wounded, ran out of the Magazin, crying out Ram, Ram, that is, OGod, 0 God, whereupon feveral Banians, men and women came running to her relief and bound her arm very hard above the wound, thinking to flop the venom from run ning any higher. But all in vain,for immediately her face fwell’d and turn’d black, and fhe dy’d in lefs than an hour. The RagipotSs, who are the belt Souldiers among the Indians, and are all Idolaters, came in juft as the woman was expiring, and about four of them entring with their Skains, and Half-pikes in their hands into the Magaziu, kill’d the Serpent. The people of the Village took and threw it without the Town, and immediately there came agreat number of Birds of prey, which lighting upon the Carrion, devour’d it in lefs than an hours time. The Pa rents Of the woman took her body, carri’d it to the River, waft’d it, and then burnt it. I was fore d to ftay two days at that place, becaufe there was a River to pafs, which inftead of falling, fwell’d at that time, by reafon of the rains that fell for three or four days together: So that I was conftrain’d to go half a league lower before I could crofs it. They always endeavour'd to ford this River ^ for otherwife they muft be compell’d to unload the Wgagon into the Boats} and alfo to carry the Goods in their arms for above half a league, which is worfe way than can be imagin’d. The people get their livings by the Paffengers, from whom they extort as much as they can, there being none but they that know the ways: Otherw ife it would be an eafy thing to make a Bridge, there being no want either of Wood or Stone near at hand. For the paflage is nothing but thorough Rocks, that lie between the Mountain and the River } fo that the waters when they fwdl, overflow all the Road, in-fo-much that no-body can pafs it, but they who are very well acquainted with it. Fromv 'V Frdmi Book I. From Gate to Nader, coltes Nader k a great City upon the defcent of a Mountain, at the top whereofis v a Find of Fortrefs} all the Mountain being encompafl with walls. The greateft part of the Houfes, as in all other Cities of India, are thatch’d with ftraw, one Story high ^ but the Rich-men’s Houfes, are two Stories, and terrafs’d.

So foon as he had in his clutches Prince Morat-Bakche his youngeft Brother, whom he engaged to take Arms againft his Father Cha-jehan and who being Governor of the Province oiGuurat, took upon him the Title of King, hefent him to this Fortrefs, where he dy’d. They have made him a moft magnificent Monumentinthe City ina Mofcjuee, which they built on Purpofe, with a great Biaz.z.a before it all fur- rounded with Vaults and Shops over them. For it is the cuftom of the Indians, when they rear any publick building, to make a great before it, where they keep their Markets, with a Foundation for the Poor, to whom they give Alms every day, as being to pray to God for him that rais’d the Fabrick.

Before you enter into JWoc-k, you muft Ferry over the Riye r which runs to Cambaya^ and falls into the Golf that carries the fame name. Baroche is a great City, to which there belongs a Fortrefs, of which there is no ufe made at this time. But the City has been always very famous, by reafon of the River, which has a particular quality to whiten their Cottons; which are brought thither from all parts of the Great Mogul's Territories, where they have not that convenience. In this place are made a great quantity of BafFa’s, or Iona and large pieces of Cotton. Thefe Cottons are very fair, and clofe woven - and the price of thefe pieces is from four to an hundred Roupies. You mull * pay Cuftom at Baroche for all Goods that are brought in and carriM out. The En^ UJh have a very fair Houfe in the City } and I remember once, that coming thi ther one day in my return from Surat to Agra with the Prefident of the Englift prefently the Mountebanks came about him, andask’dhim if he would fee any of their tricks. The firil thing they did was to light a great fire, and to heat cer- tain Iron-chains red-hot,apd wind them about their bodies,making as if they felt a great deal of pain, but in truth receiving no harm at all. Then they thrufta piece of a (tick into the ground, and ask’d the Company what Fruit they would have. One told them, he would have Mengues ^ then one of the Mountebanks hiding himfelf in the middle of a Sheet, ftoopt to the ground five or fix times one after another . I was fo curious to go up ftairs, and look out of a window,to fee if I could fpy what the Mountebank did } and perceived, that after he had cut himfelf under the armpits with a Razor, he rubb’d the flick with his Blood. After the two firfl times that he rais’d himfelf, the flick feem’d to the very eyeto grow. The third time there fprung out branches with young buds. The fourth time the Tree was covered with leaves} and the fifth time it bore flowers. The Prefident of the Englifii had then hisMinifler with him, having brought him from Amadabat to Chriflen the Commander of the Hollanders Child, to which he had promifed to' be Godfather. The Englijh Minifler Protefled that he could not give his coiifent that any Chriflian fhould be a fpe&amp;ator of fuch delufions. So that as foon as he faw that thofe Mountebanks had of a dry-flick, in lefs then half an hour, made a Tree four or five foot high, that bare leaves and flowers as in the Spring-time ; he went about to break it, protefling he would not give the Com munion to any perfon that fhould flay any longer to fee thofe things. Thereupon the Prefident was forc’d to difmifs the Mountebanks, who wander about the Countrey*with their Wives and Children juft like Gipfies} and having given them to the value of ten or twelve Crowns, they went away very well con tented. They that are curious to fee Cambaya^ never go out of their way above five or fix Coftes, or thereabout. For when you are at Baroche , inflead of going to Broudra, you may go dire&amp;ly forward to Cambaya^ from thence after wards to Amadabat. But whether it be for bufinefs, or out of curiolity, the lat ter Road is never to be taken not only becaufe it is the longelt way, but be- caufe of the danger in crofling the mouth of the Golf. C ambaya is a great City at the bottom of the Golf that bears its name. Here it is that they fhape thofe fair Agats, that come from the Indies, into Cups, Hafts of Knives, Beads, and other forts of Workmanlhip. In the parts adjacent to the City, they alfo make Indko of the fame nature of that ofTravels in India Book I. 'J^jnefs i and it was famous for traffick at the time when the Tonuguefes flou~ rilh’d in India. There are to be feen at this day, in the Quarter next the Sea, very fair Houfes, which they had built, with very rich Furniture, after the Portugal manner j but now they are uninhabited, and fall to decay every day more and more. I here were then fuch good Orders obferv’d in Cambaya^ that two hours after day was Ihut in, every Street was lock’t up with two Gates, which are Hill to be feen } and Hill they continue to lock up the prin cipal Streets, as alfo the Streets that lead into the Town. One of the chief reafons why the Town has loft the greateft part of its Trade is, becaufe that formerly the Sea run clofe up to Cambaya^ fo that little Vellels eafily anchor’d by it} but afterwards the Sea daily loft in that part,fo that a fmall Ship could not ride within five or fix Leagues of the City. There are a great number of Peacocks in the Indies^ efpecially in the Ter ritories of Baroche r Cambay a, and Broudra. The flelh of the young ones is white and well-tafted like ours, and you fhall fee vaft numbers of them all day in the Fields, for at night they rooft upon the Trees. ’Tis a hard mat ter to come near/them in the day, for as foon as they perceive themfelves hunted, they fly dway as fwift as a Partridg among the Bullies *, fo that it is impoflible for any man to follow them without tearing his Cloaths all to rags; therefore are they only to be taken in the night time, to which purpofe they have this invention. They approach the Tree with a kind of a Banner, upon which there is a Peacock painted to the life on both fides; at the top of the ftick are faftn’d two lighted Candles, the brightnefs whereof amazing the Pea cock, caufes him to ftretchout his Neck toward the end of the ftick, to which there is a Rope ty’d with a Hiding knot, which he that holds the Banner draws, when he finds that the Peacock has put his Neck into it. But you muft have a care of killing either Bird or any other Animal in the Territories, of which the idolatrous Rajah's are Mafters} which is nothing dangeroiis to do in thofe parts of the Indies, where the Governors are Mahometans, and give liberty to Fowl or Hunt. It happen’d one time that a rich Perfian Merchant, paf- ling through the Territories of the Raja of Damivar, Ihot a Peacock upon the road, and kill’d it, either out of ralhnefs, or ignorance of the Cuftoms of the Country. The Bannians incens’d at the attempt, vyhich is accounted among them a moft abominable facriledg, feiz’d upon the Merchant, and all his Mo ney to the value of 300000.

From Cambay a you go to a little Village diftant fome three Coftes, where there is a Pagod, to which all the Indian Curtifans come to make their Of ferings. This Pagod is full of a great number of naked Images, among the reft, there is a large Figure of one that feems to refemble Apollo, with his privy parts all uncover’d. When the old Curtifans have got together a good fum of Money in their youth, they buy young Slaves, whom they teach to Daunce, and fing wanton Songs, and inftrud in all the myfteries of their in famous Art. And when thefe young Girls are' eleven or twelve years old, their Miftrefles fend them to this Pagod, believing it will bring them good for tune, to offer and furrender up themfelves to this Idol. From this Pagod to Chiidabad you have fix Coftes. This is one of the fairefl: Houfes of the great Mogul, with a wide Enclofure, wherein he has vaft Gar dens, and large Ponds, with all the pleafures and curiofity whereof the Ge- mus of the Indians is capable. From Chiidabad to Amadabad you have but five Coftes; and fo I return to Bamhe, and the common Road.

Before you enter into it, you muft crofs three large Courts pav’d with Marble, and encompall with Galleries ^ nor muft you enter into the third Court till you have pull’d off your fhooes. The infide of the Mofom is adorn’d with Mofikkrwork, the greateft part whereof is of Jlgats of divers colours, which they fetch from the Mountains of Cambay a, not above two days journey off. There are feveral Sepulchres of the ancient Idolatrous Kings, that look like little Chappels, of MofakkcWorkjomlt upon a Vault that is under the Se pulchre. There runsa River from Amadabat toward the North-weft, which du ring the rainy-feafons that continue three or four Months together, is very wide and rapid, and does much mifchief every year. It is fo with all the other Rivers in India ^ and after the rains are fallen, you muff ftay fix weeks or two months before you can ford Amadabat-Kivzv*, where there is no Bridg. There are two or three Boats; but they are of no ufe,when the ftream is fo fwift • f 0 that you muff ffay till the waters are fall’n. But the people of the Countrey will not ftay fo long pfor to crofs from one River to another,they only make ufe of Goat skins,which they blow up and fill with wind,and then tye them between their fto- jnacks and their bellies. Thus the poor men and women fwim crofs this River, and when they would carry their children along with them, they put them in certain round pots of Earth, the mouth whereof is four fingers wide, and drive the Pots before them. This puts me in mind of a Paffage, when I was at dabat-in the year 1542, which is too remarkable to be omitted. A Countrey-man and a Countrey-woman one day paft the River as I have rela ted, and having a child about two years old, they put it into one of thefe Pots,fo that there was nothing but the head appear’d. Being about the middle ofthe River, they met with a little bank ofSand, where there lay an huge Tree, which the ftream had carry’d thither y whereupon the Father fhov’d the Pot toward that part, to reft himfelf awhile., When he came near the Tree, the trunk whereof lay fomewhat above the water, a Serpent leapt out from among the roots, into the Pot where the Infant was. The Father and the Mother frighted at the acci dent, and havingalmoft loft their fenfes, let the Pot go a-drift where the ftream earn’d it,and lay almoft dead themfelves at the bottom of the Tree. About two leagues lower, a Banian and his Wife with a little Infant,were wafting themfelves in the River before they went to eat. They defery’d thePota-far-off, with the half of the Infant’s-head that appear’d above the hole. The Banian immediately fwims to the relief of the child, and having ftopp’d the Pot, drives it to the Ihoar. The Mother follow’d by her own, comes prefently to take the other child out of the Pot, at what time the Serpent that had done no harm to the other child, fhoots out ofthe Pot, and winding about hers, ftingsit, andinfufes its yenom in to the Infant, fo that it dy’d immediately. However, the accident being fo ex traordinary, did not trouble thefe poor people •, who rather believ’d it to have happen’d by the fecret difpofal of their Deity, who had taken frpm them one child, to give them another for it,with which opinion they preftfttly comforted themfelves. Some time after, the report of this accident coming to the ears of the firft Country-man, he comes to the Banian to tell him how the mifchance had happen’d, and to demand his child of him } the other Indian affirming that the child was his, and that his God had fent it him, in the place of that which was dead. To be fhort, the bufinefs made fo loud a noife, that it was at length brought before the King, who order’d, that the child ftould be reftord to the At the fame time there happen’d another very pleafant accident in the fame City of Amadabat. The Wife of a rich Merchant Banian, nam’d Sahtidas, ne ver having had a child, and manifefting her eager defire to have one, a fervanto the Houfe took hera-fide one day, and told her, that if fte would but eat tlia which he would give her, fte ftould be with child. The woman defirous to Kno what fte was fo eat, the fervant told her it was a little fift, and that fte Inou eat but three or four. Now the Religion of the Banians forbidding them to ea, any thing that has life,fte could not at firft refolve to yield to his propolal j the fervant having promifed her tha£ he would fo order the matter, thaBook I. travels in India ■ . ^ . . ! N _ Sould not know whether it were fifh or no that Ihe eat, fhe refolv’d to try his receit, and went the next night to lie with her Husband, according to the in- ftru&amp;ion which fne had received from the Servant. Some time after, the woman perceiving that Ihe was big, her Husband happen’d to die, and the kindred of the deceafed would have his Eftate. The Widow oppofed them, and told them that it behov’d them to flay, till they faw whether the Child Ihe went withal, would live or no. Her kindred were furpriz’d to hear fuch news that they fo little ex pected, and tax’d her for one that either ly’d or jelled with them } knowing that the woman had liv’d fifteen or fixteen years with her Husband, yet never had been with Child. Seeing therefore that her kindred Hill tormented her, Ihe went and threw her felf at the Govern our’s feet, to whom Ihe related all that had pall* who thereupon order’d that the kindred Ihould flay till the woman was deliver’d! Some days after Ihe had lain-in, the kindred of the deceas’d Merchant, who were Perfons of Credit, and gap’d after fo fair an inheritance, affirm’d that the child was not Legitimate, and that Ihe had it not by her Husband. The Gover- noor, to underltand the truth of the matter, calls for the Phyficians} who con cluded, that the Infant Ihould be carried to the Bath^ faying, that if the Receit which the Mother had made ufe of, were real, the fweatof the Child would fmellofFifh} which was done accordingly, and the Experiment prov’d true. Thereupon the Governour order’d that the Child Ihould have the Ellate , the Merchant being fo proud to be his Father .* But the kindred, troubl’d that fuch a fat Morfel had efcap’d their mouths, appeal’d to the King. Upon their relation of the llory, the King wrote to the Governour to fend him the Mother and the In fant, to the end the Experiment might be made in his prefence: which having the fame fuccefs as before, the kindred furceas’d their claim, and the Ellate re main’d to the Mother and the Infant. I remember alfo another pleafant Story which was related tome at Amadabat % where I have been ten or twelve times. A Merchant with whom I often dealt, and who was very well belov’d by Cha-Eft-Kan, Governour of the Province, and the King’s Uncle, had the reputation never to have told a lye. Cha-Eft-Kan y after the three years of his Government were expir’d, according to thecullomof the Great Moguls and that Aureng-z,eb, the King’s Son was come into his place, retir’d to Agra, where the Court then was. One day, difcourfing with the King j he told him, that he had feeit many rare things in the Government, with which his Majelty had honour’d him, but that one thing above all the reft had aftoniffi’d him, to fiave met with a Rich Merchant that had never told a lye, and yet he was above threefcore and ten years of age. The King furpriz’d at a thing fo ex traordinary,fig nified to Cha-Eft-Kan, his defire to fee the perfon, and commanded him to fend for him to Agra, which he did. The Old-Man was very much troubl’d, as well in regard of the length of the way, it being a journey of 25 or 30 days, as for that he was to make a Prefent to the King. In ffiort, he provided one, elleeni’d at fourty-thoufmd Roupies, to. carry Bale in, enchas’d with Dia monds, Rubies, and Emraulds. When he had made his obeyfance to the King, and given him his Prefent, the King ask’d him only what was his name, to whom hereplyed, that he was call’d the man that had never told a lye. Then the King ask’d him who was his Father? Sir, faid he, I cannot tell ^ hisMajefty fatisfi’d with an anfwer, ftoptthere, and unwilling to trouble him any farther, comman ded an Elephant to be given him, which is a very great Honour, and ten thou- fand Roupies to bear his charges home. Banians have a great Veneration for Apes, and there are fome which they breed up in their Pagods to worfhip. There are three or four Houfes in Amad- &lt;doat which they make ufe of for Hofpitals for Covyes, Oxen, Apes, and other ' fick or maim’d Bealls 3 and they carry all they can find thither to preferve them. This is alfo very remarkable, that every Taefday and Friday, all the Apes in the places adjoyning to Amadabat, of their own accord come to the City, and get upon the tops of their Houfes, where they lye, during the exceffive heats. And therefore upon thofe days the People never fail to fet teady in their Terral- f\^ Ce ’ MlUet ’ S u S ar -Ganes in their feafons, and other fuch-like things. For u the Apes did. not find their provifion when they came, they would break the des where-with the reft of the Houfe is cover’d, and do a great deal of mif- chiefiTravels z‘» I n d i a. chief. And you muft here take notice alfo, that the Ape never eats any thin which he does not very well like the fcent of before-hand ; and before he fL] lows any-thing, he lays up his Magazin againft future hunger ^ filling hi s w with provifion, which he keeps till next day. d S s I have faid, that the Banians have a particular Veneration for the Ape • r Which I will give you one Example, among many, that I could bring. Being 0 n» day at Amadabat, at the Houfe belonging to the Hollanders^ a young man of that Nation newly arriv’d to ferve in the Fa&amp;ory, not knowing the cuftom of the Countrey, and feeing a great Ape upon a Tree in the Court, would needsfhewa piece of adivity, or rather a trick of youth, to kill the Ape with a fmall Gun I was at the Table then with the Xtaf7-Commander ^ and we no fooner heard the blow, but we heard as foon a loud noife of Banians, that wait upon the Holland Company, who came to complain bitterly of him that had kill’d the Ape. They would all have been gone; fo that the Commander had much ado, and made many excufes before he could appeafe them, and oblige them to Itay. In the Neighbourhood about Amadabat, there are a great number of Ap es And this is obfervable, that where there are a great number of thofe Ani mals, there are very few Crows. For as foon as they have built their Nells and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees and throw their Egg s to the Ground. One day returning from Agra, and departing out of Amada- bat with the English Prefident, who came hither about fome bufinefs, and was returning to Surat, we pafs’d through a little Forreft ofTrees, call’d Manmt fome four or five Leagues from Amadabat ^ there we faw a vafc number of great Monkeys, male and female, and many of their females holding their young ones in their Arms. We had each of us our Coach, and the EngMa Prefi, dent caufing his to flop, told me he had an excellent and very neat Barque- bufs, that was prefented him by the Governor of Daman , and knowing I could aim well, he defirM me to try it, at one of thofe Apes. One of my Servants, who was born in the Country, making me a lign not to venture I endeavoured to dilfwade the Preiident from his delign } but it was impof- fible ; fo that I took, the Harquebufs, and kill’d a female Monkey, who lay ilretch’d out upon the Boughs, letting her little ones fall to the ground. But it fell out as my Servant had forewarn’d me. For immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of fixty, came down in a great fury, to have leap’d into the Prefidents Coach, where they would foon have ftrangled him, had we not prevented them by clofing the Shutters, and had we not had a great number of Servants, that with much ado kept them off. And though they came not to my Coach, yet I was very much afraid of my felf} for They purfued the Prelident’s Coach above a League, and they were front lufry Monkeys. \ From Amadabat to Panfer, cofres ' 13 From Panfer to Mafana, coftes 14 From Mafana to Chit four, coftes 14 Chitfour is a very good City, fo called by reafon of the great Trade for painted- Calicuts, which are called Chites : Near which, fome four or five-hundred paces toward the South, there runs a fmall River. Arriving at Chitfour in one of my Voyages, I pitch’d my Tent under two or three Trees at the end of a wide-place neer the Town. A little while after I faw four or five Lions appear, which were brought to be tam’d 3 which they told me took them up five or fix months ; and their way to do it, is this .• They tye the Lions at twelve paces diftance one from another by the hinder-legs, with a Rope faften’d to a great woodden-frakefet deep in the ground,with another cord about the neck,which the Mafter holds in his hand. Thefe ftakes are planted in the fame Line, and in another Parallel they ftretch out another Cord as long as the fpace,which the bodies of the Lions fo difpos’d of,asl have defcrib’d, take up. The two Cords which hold the Lion ty’d by the two hinder-feet, give him liberty to fpring out as far as that long Cord 3 which'is a mark to thofe that ftand to provoke and incenfe the Lions, by throwing ftones and pieces of wood at them, not to venture any farther : The people run to fee the light, and when the Lion, provok’d,gives a fpring towards the Cord, the MakerBook I. Travels in India. holds another in his hand, ty’d about his neck, that pulls him back. Thus they aceuftom the Lion by degrees to be familiar with the people, and at my coming to Ch\afonr , I faw this Divertifement without ftirring out of tny Coach. The next day I had another, meeting with a knot of Faquirs, or Mahometan Demobs. I counted fifty-feven, among whom, he that was the Chief or Supe rior, had been Grand Efquire to Cha-jehan-guir, having left the Court, when Sultan Boulahk his youngeft Son, was ftrangPd by Order of Cha-jehan : there were foui otlieis, who next to the Superior, were chief of the Company who had been&lt;alfo great Lords in the fame Cha-jehans Court. All the Cloaths thofe Dervicbs had, were only four ells of Orange-colour-Calicut to hide what mcdelly will have hid before and behind, and every one of them a Tygers-skin over their fhoulders ty’d together under their chins. They had led before them eight fair HorfesTaddPd and bridl’d • three whereof had Bridles of Gold, and Saddles cover’d with Plates of Gold, and the other five had Bridles of Silver cover’d with Plates of Silver, and a Leopard’s-skin upon every one. The other Demobs had only a Cord for their Girdle, to which was fatten’d a piece of Cali cut only to cover their private parts. Their hair was ty’d in wreaths round about their heads after the manner of a Turbant. They were all well-arm’d the moft part with Bows and Arrows, Lome with Muskets,and others with Half-pikes with another fort oi weapon which we have not in Europe ; that is to fay,a fharp piece of Iron like the fide oi a Platter without a bottom, which they wind* eight or ten times about their necks, and carry like a Calves Chaldron. They draw outthefe Iron-Circles as they intend to make ufe of them ; and they will throw them with fuch a force agamft a man,that they fhall ffy as fwift as an Arrow,and go very neer to cut a man in two in the middle. They had every one,befides all this,an Hunting- Horn,which they wind,making a prodigious noife when they come to any place and when they go away * together with a Grater or Rafp, being an Iron-Inftru- ment, niad^ like a Trowel. This is an Inftrument which Khz Incllans Q&amp;Tvy gene rally about them when they travel, to fcrape and make clean the places where tney intend to rett } and fome of them, w 7 hen they have fcrap’d all the duft to gether mto an heap, make ;ufe of it inttead of a Mattrefs or Pillow to lie eafily upon. I here w ere fome of them that were arm’d with long Tucks *, which they had bought either of the English or Portugals. Their Luggage confifted of four great Cnetts full ol Ptrfian and Arabian Books, and fome Kitchen-honlholdftuff • 1 hey had alfo ten or twelve Oxen to carry their Tick. When the Dervicbs came to tue place where I lay with my Coach, having about fifty perfons with me, as well ot the people of the Countrey, as of my own fervants } the Chief or Su perior oi the 1 roop feeing me fo well-attended, enquir’d what Aga that was; ana (lehr d me to let him have that place which I had taken up,as being the riiott convenient in all that place, for him and his Dervicbs to lodg. When they told me the quality of the Chief, and the four Dervichs that attended him, I was wil ling to be civil, and to yield to their requett^ and thereupon I left them the place tree. Alter they had well-water’d the place, and laid the duft, they lighted two uts, as it it uad been in the frott and fnow tor the five principal Dervichs,whd f ate , cM d themfelves before and behind.

Part H, and Silk, four Handkerchiefs of painted Unnen, and two Bottles, and the other full of S/^kWine. At my departure he fent a'Con voy of twenty Horfe four or five leagues along with me. One evening being about to lodg upon the Frontiers of the Territories of the Raja of Bafgantj my people came to me and told me, that if we took the Road through Barganty we fhould go neer to have all our throats cut, for that the Maja of that place liv’d altogether upon Robbery. So that unlefs Ihir’d an hundred more of the Country-people, there was no likelihood of efcaping thofe Free booters. At firft 1 argu’d with them, and tax’d their Cowardice, but/earing to pay for my rafhnefs afterwards, I fent them to hire fifty more, for three days only, that we crofs’d the Rajah Country .* for which they ask’d me every one four Roupies, which is as much as you give them for a whole Month.The next day as I was about to fet forward, my Guard came and told me they would leave me and that they would not venture their lives, defiring me not to write to their Captain, who was refponfible for them, that they had left me agaiifft my will. Three of my fervants alfo did as they did, fo that 1 had no body left with me, but a man that lead an Horfe in his hand, my Coachman, and three other fer vants, and fo I fet forward under the protection of God. About a league from the place which I had left, I perceived fome part of my Convoy following me. Thereupon I ftopt my ( Coach to flay for them, and when they came neer, 1 bid them advance if they intended to go along, with me. But Jeeing them fearful and unrefolvM, I bid them go about their bulinefs, telling them 1 had no need of fuch Cowards as they were. About a league from thence I difcover’d upon the brdw of an Hill about fifty Horfe, four of which came riding up to me ^ when I perceived them, I alighted out of my Coach, and having with me fome thirteen Spit-fires, I gave to every one of my men an Harquebuls. The Horfe-men ap. preaching, I kept my Coach between them and me, and had my Gun ready cockt, in cafe they ihould affail me. But they made me a .fign, that I fhould fear nothingj only that the Prince was a-Hunting, and had fent to know what Strangers paft through his Territories .* I made anfwer,. that I was the fame Rrangay that had paft by five or fix weeks before. By good luck, the very fame Lieutenant to whom I had made the Prefent of Aquavit a and SpamJh'-'W ine, follow’d thofe four Horfemen. , And after he had teflify’d how glad he was tbfee me, he ask’d me if I had any Wine} 1 told him I never travell’d without that •• For indeed ths Englijh and Hollanders had prefented me with feveral Bottles at Agra. So foon as the Lieutenant was return’d to the Raja^ the Raja himfelf came to me, and told me I was welcome j and hid me reft my felf in a fhady-place which he pointed to, about a league and an half from the place where we were. In the evening he came, and we Raid together two days to make merry} the Raja bring ing alone with him certain Morrice-dancers, without which the Perfmns and A- dians can never think themfelves heartily merry. At my departure the Raja lent me 200 Horfe, to convoy me to the Frontiers of his Territories, for three days to gether , for which I only gave them three or four pound of Tobacco. When I came to Amadabat, the people would hardly believe that I had hadfo kind a re ception from a Prince, that was noted for abufing ftrangers that paft through his Countrey.

The latter way is the fhorter by ten days journey. But the Ckrh'-' van never goes that way. For from Candahar to Multan y6u travel almbft all the way through. Defarts j and fometimes you travel three or four days with out meeting any water. So that the moft ordinary and beaten Road, is through Caboid.

In the Months of July and : Auguli, there blows a hot Wind in thofe parts, that takes away a mans breath, and kills him upon the place; being of the fame nature with thofe Winds, of which I have fpoken in my PtYftm Relations, that blow at ceftain feafonsmear £nd ^ . ♦ Cabout is a large City, very well fortified ^ and is the place where thofe titVsbek, come every year to fell their Horfes. They reckon, that there are bought .and fold, every year, above lixty thoufand. They bring alfo out of Perfia, great numbers of Sheep, and other Cattel; it being the general Con- courfe of Terftans, Tartarians, and Indians. There is alfo Wine to be had; but Provifions go off at a very good rate. &gt; Before I go any farther, I muft take notice of one thing in particular,, con cerning the * people callM Augans, who inhabit from Candahar to Cabout, to ward the Mountains of Batch, a fturdy fort of people, and great Robbers in the night-time. It is the cuftom of the Indians to cleanfe and fcrape their tongues every morning with a crooked piece ofa root, which caufes them to void a great quantity of Flegm and. Rhume, and provokes vomiting. Now though thofe people that inhabit the Frontiers of Per ft a and India praftife the fame thing ; neverthelefs they vomit very little in the morning, but when they come to eat, as Toon as they have fwallowed two or three bits, their lungs begin to fwe!l,and they, are conftrain’d to go forth and vomit; after which, they return again to their Viduals with a very good appetite.

The City is large, and extends it felf above a league in length. But the greatefl part of the Houfes, which are higher than thofe.of Agra and Ddi, fall to ruine, by reafon of the exceffive rains that have overflowed a great number of them. The King’s Palace is an indifferent fair one, and is not, as formerly it was, upon the River, which is fall’n off above a quarter of a league from it.There is Wine to be had at Labor. I mull obferve by the by, that after you have pafl Labor^ and the Kingdom of Kakemir, that lies upon it toward the North,none of their Women have any hair upon any part of their bodies, and the Men but very little upon their chins.

Dehly is a great City near the River Gemma, which runs from the North to theSouth, afterwards from the Weft to theEaft} and after it has paft by Agra and Kadlone, empties it felf into the Ganges. After Cba-jeban had built the new City of Gehanabad, which is call’d by his own Name * ? and where he chofe rather to keep his Court, than at Agra, becaufe the Climate is more temperate. Debly is almoft come to ruine, and indeed is nothing but an heap of Rubbiih} there be ing no other Houfes remaining but only for poor people. The Streets are narrow, and the Houfes of Bambonc, as overall the reft of the Indies. Neither are there above three or four Lords of the Court that refide at Debly, where they fet up their Tents in great Enclofures, and in the fame manner lodg’d the Reverend Jefuit that was at Court. Cehmabad, as well as Dehly, is a great City ; and there is nothing but a fingle Wall that make the feparation. All the Houfes of particular men confift of great Enclofures, in the midft whereof is the place for Lodgings. The great eft part of the Lords do not live in the City, but have their Houfes without, for the con- veniency of the water. As you enter into Gehanabad from Dehly, you meet with &lt;1 long and broad Street, on each fide whereof are Vaults, where the Merchants keep Ihops, being only plat-form’d at the top.This ftreet ends in the great Fiaz.^a before the King’s Houfe; and there is another very fair and large Street, that runs toward another Gate of the fame Palace, in which live the great Merchants that keep no Shops. The King’s Palace takes up above half a league circuit * The Walls ^are of J? lr c ut-Stone with Battlements. The Moats are full of water, pav’d with Free- th* T he sreat Gate the Palace has nothing in it of magnificence} no more than the firft Court, into which the great Lords may enter upon their Elephants. HavingTravels in I n d i a, ' Having paft that Court, you enter into another longand large palKge^with fair Portico’s on both iides. Under which are feveral little Chambers, where pan of the Horfe-Guard lies. Thefe Portico’s are rais’d fome two foot above the ground and the Horfes which are ti’d without, feed upon the fleps. In fome places there are great Gates that lead to feveral Apartments} as to the Womens Lodging and to the Seat of jultice. In the midft of the palFage runs a Cut faUpf water leaving a fair Walk oh each fide, where, at equal diftances, are little Bafons or Fountains. This long Paffiige carries you into a great Court, where the Omra^ that is to fay, the great Lords of the Kingdom, fuch as the BaftJs in Turkey, and the Kntfs in Perfia, keep Guard in Perfon. They have low Lodgings round about the Court and their Horfes are ti’d to their doors. 5 From this fecond Court you pafs into a third, through a great Portal; oh one lide whereof there is a little Hall, rais’d fome two or three fteps high from the ground. This is the Wardrobe where the Royal Garments are kept; and from whence the King fends for the CaUat, or a whole Habit for a man, when he would honour any Stranger or any one of his own Subje&amp;s. A‘little farther,un der the fame Portal, is the place where the Drums, Trumpets, and Hautboys are laid up; ’ which they found and beat a little before theKing enters into his Judg ment-Seat, to give notice to the Omrahh } and they make the fame noife when the King is ready to rife. Entring into the third Court, you fee the Than before you, where the King gives Audience. This is a great Hall rais’d fome four-foot- high above the fuperficies of the Court,with three Tides open. Thirty-two'Pil lars fullain as many Arches} and thefe Columns are about four-foot-fquare, with Pedeftals and Mouldings. When Cha-jehan firlt began to build this Hall; he in tended to have enrich’d it, and inlaid it all over with thofe Stones that feem to be naturally painted, like thofe in the Great Duke of Tufcanys Chappel. But having made a trial upon two or three Pillars, about two or three-foot-high, he found that there would not be Stones enough, of that fort, in the World to finifh the work y belides the valtnefs of the Sum it would come to. So that he left off his delign, contenting himfelf with a Painting of feveral flowers. In the middle of this Hall, next to the fide which looks toward the Court, there is a Throne ere&amp;ed upon a kind of Theater, where the King gives Audience, and pronounces Judgment. The Throne is a little Bed with four Columns, about thebignefs of one of our Field-beds, with a Canopy, Backpiece, Boulfter and Counterpoint, all embroider’d with Diamonds. Befides all this, when the King comes to fit upon the Throne, they throw over the Bed a Coverlet of Cloath of Gold, or fome other richly-embroider’d Silk y and he afcends by three little Reps, two-foot-broad. On one lide of the Bed is eredted an Vntbrello upoi a Staff, as long as an Half-Pike. Upon one of the Pillars of the Throne hangs one of the King’s Weapons ; upon another his Buckler; upon another hisSci- metar ; and then his Bow and Quiver of Arrows, and other things of the fame na ture. . Below the Throne there is a place,fome twenty-foot-fquaire, encompafl: with Balullers which at fome times are cover’d with Plates of Silver, at other times with Plates of Gold. At the four Corners of this fraallenclofurefit the four Se cretaries of State, who as well in Civil as Criminal Caufes, do the duty of ad vocates. Many Lords Rand about this Baluflrade ; and there is alfo the Mulick plac’d, that plays all the while the King is in the Than. This Mufick is fo fweet and Toft, that it never takes off the mind from the ferioufnefs of bufinefs at that time manag’d. The King being fat upon his Throne,fome great Lords Rand by him ; generally it is fome one of his own Children. Between eleven a Clock and Noon, the Nahab, who is the chief MiniRer of State, like the Grand Tiher in Turkey, makes a report to the King of what has paR in the Chamber where he Prefides, which is at the Entry of the firR Court; and when he has done fpeak- ihg, &amp;he King rifes. For you muR take notice, that from the time that the King is fate upon his Throne,till he rifes, no perfon whatfoever is permitted to flir out of the Palace y and yet I can lay that the King difpenc’d with my performance o this Law fo generally obferv’d by all the Court: The dccafion whereof was t us in fhort. ' _ • _ , 1 ^ BeingBook I. Travels in India. Being one day going out of the Palace,while the King was fitting in the Dtvan^ upon fome urgent bufinefs that would admit of no delay, the Captain of the Guards held me by the arm, and told me I ihould go no farther ^ I contelfed and argued the Gale with him for fome time, but finding his ufuage to be very boifte- rous, I lifted up my Cane, and had certainly ftrook him in my paffion, had not two or three of the Guards that law all the pallages, held my hand. Happily for me at that time, the JSJabab, who was then the King’s Uncle, came by, and being in formed of the ground of our quarrel ^ order’d the Captain of the Guards to let me go. After that he made a report to the King how the matter flood } and to ward evening the Nahab fent me one of his Servants to tell me, it was his Ma~ jelly’s pleafure, that I might come in or go out of the Palace, though he were iitting in the Divan, as I pleas’d my felf} for which I went the next day, and re turn’d thinks to the Nahab. Toward the middle of the fame Court there is a fmall Channel fome five or fix inches broad, where while the King is fitting upon the Seat of Jullice, they that have bufinefs are to Hand. Further it is not lawful for them to go, till they are call’d; and Embafiadours themfelves are not exempted from this cuflonn When an Embafiadour, comes as far as this Channel, the Mailer of the Ceremonies calls out toward the Divan where the King is fitting, that fuch an Embafiadour craves Audience of his Majelty. Then one of the Secretaries of State declares it to the King } who oftentimes makes as if he did not hear .* But fome time after lifting up his eyes,he calls them upon the Embafiadour, making him a fign by the fame Secretary, that he may approach. From the Hall of the Divan, turning to the left, you walk upon a Terrafs, where you difcoverthe River. Over this Terrafs the King pafles into a little Chamber, from whence he goes into his Haram. In this little Chamber it was that I had my firfl Audience of his Majelly } as I Ihall relate in another place. Upon the left-hand of the Court where the Divan is built, Hands a littk Mofquee neatly built} the Cupola whereof is cover’d with Lead perfectly guilded. Here the King goes to hear Prayers every day, except it be Fridays, when he is to go to the great Mofqaee, which is a very fair one, and plac’d upon an high Platform, rais’d higher than theHoufes of the City, and there is a noble afcent to it. That day that the King goes to the Mofquee, they place huge rails of wood round about the Heps, as well to keep off the Elephants, as out of refped to the Mofquee. Ihe right fide of the Court is taken qp with Portico’s, that make a long Gal lery, rais’d from the ground about half a foot} and thefe are the King’s Stables into which you have many doors to enter. They are alfo full of Hately Horfes, the worH whereof Hands the King in three-thoufand Crowns} and there are fome that coH him ten-thoufand. At the door of every one of thefe Stables hangs a kind of Mat made of Bambouc, that cleaves like our Ofiers. But where as we bind our Ofier twigs with the fame Ofier, they bind their Bambouc s with wreath’d-Silk, which is delicate work, but very tedious. Thefe Mats are to hin der the Flies from tormenting the Horfes; therebeing two Grooms toan Horfe, one of which is Hill employ’d in fanning the BeaH. There are alfo Macs fpread before the Portico’s, and before the Stable-door } which they fpread or take away as occafion requires. And the Floor of the Gallery is cover’d with fair* Carpets, which is taken away in the evening, and the Horfes Litter Hrow’d in tne fame place. Which litter is nothing but the Horfe-dung dri’d in the Sun,and then fqueez’d a little flat. The Horfes that are brought into India either out of lerfia, Arabia, or the Country of Vsbech y change their food .• For in India they never give them Hay nor Oats. Every Horfe in the morning having for hispro-* Potion three loaves made of Meal, Wheat, and Butter, as big as one of our fix- penny-loaves . 'Tis an hard matter to bring them to this diet at firH} it being onietimes three or four Months before they can do it. The Groom is forc’d to old their tongue in one hand, ard to thruH down the bread with the other. j 1611 Sugar-Canes or Millet are in feafon, they give them that diet about noon} n m the evening, two hours before Sun-fet they give them a meafure of Gar- en-Cbiches which the Groom fqueezes between two Hones, and mixes with wa terTravels in India. Part II. ter. This is inftead of Barley and Oats. As for the King’s other Stables where he has alfo very fine Horfes, they are fcurvy places, ill-built, which deferve not to be mention’d. The Gemene is a fair River that bears good big Boats, which running to Aar a lofes its name,falling into Ganges at Hallabas. The King has feveralfmall Bntn- tines at Gehanabad upon the River, to take his pleafure in; and they are very cu- rioufly trimm’d after the, manner of the Countrey. CHAP. VII.

The reafon is, becaufe the Gemene ran then juft at the very foot of the Paged $ wherein the Banians, as well thofe of the Countrey, as thofe that came from remote parts in Pilgrimage, had the convenience to wafh themfelves before they went to their Devotions ; and when they had perform’d them, to wafh again before they eat; which they are not to do ere they have wafh’d j be lieving alfo that if they wafh in running-water, their fins will be the moreeafily defac’d. But fome years fince the River, changing its courfe more to the North ward, comes not within a good league of the Pagod, which is the reafon that the Pilgriihs have deferted it. From Chtki'fera to Goodkj-fera, coftes 5 From Goodkj-fera to Afera, coftes 6 Agra lies in 27 deg. 3 1 rain, of Lat. and in a Sandy-foil, which caufes extremi ty of heat. It is the biggeft City in India, and formerly the Refidence of their Kings. The Houfes of great Perfons are fair, and well built j but the Houfes of the meaner-fort are as plain, as in all the other Cities of India. They are built a good diftance one from another, and hid by the height of their Walls, to keep their Women from being feen: So that it may be eafily conjectur’d that their Cities are nothing fo pleafantas ours in Europe. Add to this, that Agra being en- compaft rpund with the Sands,the heats are there very exceflive,which conftrain’d Cha-jehan to remove from thence, and to keep his Court at Gehanabad. All that is remarkable in Agra is the King’s Palace} and fome Monumentsas well near the City, as in the parts about it. The Palace of the King is a vaft piece of ground encompaft with a double-wall, which is terrafs’d in fome parts, and in thofe parts are built certain Lodgings for fame of the Officers of the Court * The Gemene runs before the Palace j but between the Wall and the River there is a large fpace of ground, where th$ King caufes his Elephants to fight. This Field is on purpofe near the Water, becaufe that the Elephant which gets the vi- ftory, being in a fury, they could not bring him to himfelf, did they not drive him into the River .* to which end they are forc’d to have recourfe to Policy,by tying Squibs and Crackers to the end of an Half-Pike, and then giving fire to them to fright him into the water .* for when he is in but two orthreefoot-deep, he is prefently appeas’d. There is a wide f Piaz.z.a, upon one fid# of the City before the Palace, and the firft Gate , wherein there is nothing of magnificence, is guarded by a few Som- diers. Before the King removed his Court from Agra to Gehanabad, when he went into the Countrey for fome time, he gave to fome one of his greateit Omratfsjwho was his Confident,the Guard of his Palace,where his Treafure lay jBook I. Travels in India. and till the return of the King he never ftirr’d out of the Gate, where he lodg’d neither by night nor day. At fuch a time that it was, that I was permitted to fee the Palace of Agra. The King being departed for Gehanabad, whither all the Court followed him, together with the Women, the Government of the Palace was given to' one that was a great Friend of the Hollanders^ and indeed to all the Vrangms. Menheir Fdam, chief of the Holland Faftory at Agra, fo foon as the King was departed, went to vilit the Lord, and to prefent him according to cuftom. The Prefent was worth about 6000 Crowns, and confined in Spices. Cabinets of Jay an y and fine Holland-CXodXh. He ddlr 7 d me to go along with him when he went to Compliment the Governour. But the Lord being offended that he had put himfelf to fo much charge, forc’d him to carry the Prefent back again, taking only one Japan-Cane, of fix that were in the Prefent, telling him he would have no more, out of the kindnefs which he had for the Frangidz.. Nay he would not fo much as take the Gold-head and Ferula, but caus’d' them to be taken off. The Complements being over, the Governour ask’d Menheir Fetnm wherein he might ferve him .• whereupon he dellring the favour, than fnce the Court was gone, he might fee the iniide of the Palace, the Governour granted his requeft, and order’d lix men to attend him. The firft Gate where the Governor of the Palace lies, is a long blind Arch, which leads you into a large Court all environ’d with Portico’s} like our Pia^a in Covent-Garden, The Gallery in front is larger and higher than any of the reff, fuftain’d by three ranks of, Pillars, and under thofe Galleries on the other fide of the Court which are narrower and lower, are little Chambers for the Souldiers of the Guard. In themidfi: of the large Gallery, is a Nich in the Wall, into which the King defcends out of his Haram by a private pair of Stairs, and when he is in, he feems to be in a kind of a Tomb. He has no Guards withhim then, for he has no reafon to be afraid of any thing } there being no way to come at him. In the heat of the day he keeps himfelf there only with one Eunuch,but more often with one of his Children, to fan him. The Great Lords of the Court ffay below in the Gallery under the Nich all the while. At the farther end of this Court is another Gate that leads into a fecond Court encompaft with Galleries, underneath which, are little Chambers for fome Officers of the Palace. The fecond Court carries you into a third, which is the King’s Quarter. Cha-jehan had refolv’d to cover with Silver all the Arch of a Gallery upon the right-hand. And a frcnch-man, Aufiin de Bordeaux by name, was to have done the work.- but the King not finding any one in his wholeKing* dom fo capable as the French-xnan was to treat with the Portugals at Goa about fome important affair he had at this time ^ the defign was' laid afide : For they being afraid of Auftins Parts,poifon’d him upon his return to Cochin. This Gal lery is painted with branch’d-work of Gold and Azure, and the lower-part is hung with Tapeftry. There are feveral doors under the Galkry that lead into little fquare-Chambers} of which we faw two or three open’d, and they told us all the reft were fiach. The other three fides of the Court lie all open', there be ing,nothing but a fingle Wall, no higher than for a njan to lean over. On the fide that looks toward the River there is a Divan, or a kind of out-jutting Bal cony, where the King fits to fee his Brigantines,or to behold his Elephants fight. Before the Divan is a Gallery, that ferves for a Portico} which Cha-jehan had a defign to have adorn’d all over with a kind of Lattice-work of Emraulds and Ru bies that Ihould havereprefented to the life Grapes when they are green,and when they begin to grow red. But this defign which made fuch a noife in the World, .ana requir’d more Riches, than all the World could afford to perfect, remains untiniffi d ; there being only three Stocks of a Vine in Gold, with their leaves ? as y, re ft ought to have been} and enamel’d in their natural colours, with Em- nf u ^ u ^ es an d Granates wrought into the falhion of Grapes. In the middle the Court ftands a great Fat to bath in, 40 foot in Diameter, cut out of one n ire grey-ftone, with fteps wrought out of the fame ftone within and with- fo t .^ e Monuments which are in and about Agra, they are very fair ones, amK • re ^ carce . an Lunuch belonging to the King’s Haram, that is not very oitiQus of leaving a fair Monument behind him. Indeed, when they have &gt; * H heapedTravels in India. Part II heap’d together great Sums, they would fain be going to Mecca, and ma king rich Prefents to Mahomet. But the Great unwilling to let his Money go out of his Country, will feldom permit them leave to undertake that Pilgrimage : and therefore not knowing what to do with their Money they employ a great part thereof in Monuments to perpetuate their Memo- ries. Of all the Monuments that are to be feen at that of the Wife of cha-jehan is the molt magnificent} Ihe caus’d it to be fet up on purpofe near the Tafimavan, to which all Strangers mult come, that they fiiould admire it. The Tafimacan is a great Baz.ar y or Marketplace, compos’d of fix great Courts all encompafled with Portico's ; under which there are Warehoufes for Mer chants ; and where there is a prodigious quantity of Calicuts vended. The Monument of this Degum, or Suhanefs^ ftands on the Ealtfide of the City, upon the River fide, in a great place enclofed with Walls, upon which there runs a little featlery, as upon the Walls of many Cities in Europe. This place is a kind of Garden with Compartiments, like our Garden-plots ; but whereas our Walks are made with Gravel, here the Walks are black and white Marble. You enter into this place through a large Portal * and prefently upon the left hand you efpy a fair Gallery, that looks towards Mecca ^ wherein there are three or four Niches, wherein the Mufti comes at certain hours to pray. A little beyond the middle of the place, toward the Water, are three great Plat forms, one rais’d above another, with four Towers at the four Corners of each, and Stairs within, upon the top whereof they call the people before the time of their prayer. On the top there is a Cupola, little Ids magnificent than that of V^al de Grace in Paris y it is cover’d within and witfiout with black marble, the middle being of Brick. Under this Cupola is an empty Tomb } for the Be, £«ms iriterr’d under the Arch of the lowelt Platform. The fame change of Ceremonies which is obferv’d under ground, is obferv’d above For they change the Tapeftries, Candles, and other Ornaments at feveral times, and there are always MollaPs attending to pray. I faw the beginning and compleating of this great work, that coil two and twenty years labour, and twenty thoufand men always at work } fo that you cannot conceive but that the Expence malt be excelfive. Cha-jehan had begun to raife his own Monument on the other fide of the River } but the Wars with his Son, broke off that defign, nor did jAurengz.eb, now reigning, ever take any care to finilh it. There is an Eunuch who commands two thouland men, that is entrufted to guard not only the Sepulcher of the Begum, but alfo the Tafimacan. On another fide of the City, appears the Sepulcher of King jikabar. And as for the Sepulchers of the Eunuchs, they have only one Platform, with four little Chambers at the four Corners. When you come to Agra from Debly, you meet a great Bez.ar near to which there is a Garden, where King guire. Father of Cha-jehan, lies interr’d. Over the Garden Gate you fee the Tomb it felf, befet with Portraitures, cover'd with a black Hearfe-Cloath, or Pall, with Torches of white Wax, and tyvo Jefuits attending at each end. There are fome who wonder, that Cha-jehan againft the practice of the Mahmetms, who abhor Images, did permit of carving \ but the rdafon conje&amp;ur’d at is, that it is done upon the confideration that his Father and himfelf learnt from the Jefuites certain principles of Mathematicks and Aftrology. Though he had not the fame kindnefs for them at another time ; for going one day to vifit an Armenian, that lay fick, whofe name was Corgia, whom he lov’d very well and had honor’d with feveral Employments, at what time the Jefrites. who liv’d next to the Armenians hQvife r Yang their Bell} the found thereof fo difpleas’d the King, as being a dilturbance to the fick perfon, that in a great fury he commanded the Bell to be taken away, and hung about his Elephants neck. Some few days after, the King feeing his Elephant with that great Bell about his neck, fearing fo great a weight might injure his-Elephant, cans the Bell to be carried to the Couveval, which is a kind of a rail’d place, where a Provoft fits as a Judg, and decides differences among the people of tna Quarter, where it has hung^everfince. This Armenian had been brought up with Cha-jehan 5 and in regard he was an excellent Wit, and an excellent Poet^Book I. Travels in India he was very much in the Kings favour, who had confer’d upon him many fair Commands, though he could never either by threats or promifes win him to turn Mahometan. CHAP. VilL the Road from Agra to Patna, and Daca, Cities in the Province of Bengala, and of the Quarrel which the Author had with Cha-Eft- Kan, the Kings Vnckle. | Departed from Agra toward Rcngdu the 15th of November 1665, and that 1 day I reach’d no farther than a very bad Inn, diftant from Agra, coftes 3 The 26th I came to Beraz.abad^ coltes p This is a little City where,at my return,! received eight thoufand Roupies,being the remainder of the Money which GiaferMian ow’d me for Wares that he had bought at Janabat. The 27th to Serael Morlides^ coftes p The 28^ to Serail Eflanja^ coftes 14 The 29th to Serail Haii^malj coftes i± The 30th. to Serail Sekandera j coftes 13 Ihe ift of December to Sanqaal^ coftes I met that day 11 oWaggons, every Waggon drawn by fixOjcen 5 &amp; in every Waggon ffoooo Roupies. This is the Revenue of the Provinceof ^^^/^,with all charges de- iraid,and the Governor’s Purfe well-fill’d, comes to 5,500000 Roupies. A league beyond Sanqml jjou muft pafs a River call’d Saingour^ which runs into Gemine, not above half a league diftant from it. You pafs over this River of Saingour upoil a Stone-bridg, aijd when you come from toward Bengala to go to Seronge or Sh- rat, if you have a mind to Ihorten your journey ten days, you muft leave Agra- Road, and come to this Bridg, and fo Ferry ovzv Gemine in a Boat. But generally %^-Road is taken, becaufe the other way you muft travel five or fix days to gether upon the ftones \ and alfo for that you are to pafs through the Territories oi certain Raja's, where you are in danger of being robb’d. The fecond day I came to an Inn call’d Cherourabad, coftes 12 When you are got about half the way, you pafs through Gianabad, a little fity, near to which, about a quarter of a League on this fide, crofllng a Field of Millet, I faw a Rhinoceros feeding upon Millet-Canes, which a little Boy or nine or ten years old gave him to eat. \ When I came near the Boy, he gave me fome Millet to give the Rhinoceros ^ who immediately came to me^open- mg his chops three or four times; I put the Millet into his mouth, and when he had fwallow’dit, he ftill open’d his mouth for more. The 3^ I came to Serrail Chajeada^ coftes 10* The /Sfth to Serrail Atakan, cofles 13 The yh to Aureng-Abad, cofles p Formerly this Village had another name } but being the place where Aureng- wv gave Battel to his Brother Saltan Sajah, w r ho was Governor of all the Pro vince of Bengala j Aareng-z^eb, in Memory of the Vidory he had won, gave it ms own name, and built there a very fair Houfe, with a Garden, and a little Mofcjaee. The 6th to Alinehan, coftes p ^ Two leagues on this fide Alin chan, you meet the River Ganges. Mon fie nr Ber- ^ the King’s Phylltian, and another perfon whofe name was Racheyot, with • * travell’d, were amaz’d to fee, that a River had made fuch a noife: ne World, was no broader than the River before the LOvre } be- eving before, that pt had been as wide as the Danaw above Belgrade. There is wiU ° k ^ water ^ rom March to Jane or July, when the rains fall, that it ' ilot k ear a final 1 Boat. When we came to Ganges, we drank every one of us a . - ' * H 2 Glafs5 2 Travels in India, 1 Par t II, x . Glafs of Wine, mixing fome of the River-water with it} which caus’d a ptipjT in our bellies .* But out Servants that drank it alone, were worfe tormented tha § we. The Hollanders, who have an Houfe upon the Bank of Ganges, never drink the water of this River, until they have boil’d it. BOtforthe natural Inhabitant of the Countrey, they are fo accuftom’d to it from their youth, that the Kin S and the Court drink no other. You fhall fee a vaft number of Camels every dav' whofe builnefs only it is to fetch water from the Ganges. ' The yth, l came to Halabas, coltes • g Hdab as is a great City, built upon a point of Land where Ganges and demi ne meet. There is a fair Caftle of hew’n Stone, with a double Moat; where the Governour refides. He is one of the greateft Lords in India ; and being very lickly, he has always about him ten Terfian Phyficians. He had alfo in his fervice, Claudius Maille of Bourges, who pradtifes Chyrurgery and Phyfick both together. This was he that advis’d us not to drink of Ganges Water, which would put us into a loofenefs} but rather to drink Well-water. The chief of thefe Berfian Phylicians, whom this Governour hires with his Money, one day threw his Wife from the top of a Battlement to the ground } prompted to that adt of cruelty, by fome jealoulies he had entertain’d. He thought the fall had kill’d her, but fhe had only a Rib or two bruis’d ; whereupon the Kindred of the Woman came and demanded juftice, at the feet of the Governour. The Go vernor fending for the Phylician, commanded him to be gone, refolving to re tain him no longer in his fervice. The Phyfician .obey’d,and putting his maim’d Wife in a Pallanquin, he fet forward upon the Road with all his Family. But tie was not gone above three or four days journey from the City, when the Go vernour finding himfelf worfe than he was wont to be, fent to recall him; which the Phylician perceiving, flab’d his Wife, his four Children, and thirteen female Slaves,and return’d again to the Governour, whofaid not a word to him, but entertain’d him again into his fervice. The eighth, day I crofs’d the River in a large Boat, having flay’d from morn ing till noon upon the bank-lide, expeding Monfieur Maille, to bring me a Pafs- port from the Governour. For there flands a JDerega, upon each fide of the River, who will not fuffer any perfon to pafs without leave and he takes no tice what fort of Goods are tranfported ; there being due from every Waggon four Roupies, and from every Coach onenot accounting the charge of the Boat,which you muft pay belide. The fame day I went to Sadoul-ferail, coltes 16 The ninth, to Yakedel-~fera, coftes 10 The tenth, to Bouraki-fera, cofles 10 The eleventh, to Banarou, coftes 10 Banarou is a large City, and handfomly built; the moll part of the Houfes being either of Brick or Stone and higher than in any other Cities of India ; butthe inconvetiiency is, that the Streets are very narrow. There are many Inns in the Town ; among the reft, one very large, and very handfomely built In the middle of the Court are two Galleries, where are to be fold Calicuts, Silks, and other forts of Merchandife. The greateft part of the Sellers, are the Workmen themfelves ; fo that the Merchants buy at the firft hand. Thefe Workmen, before they expofe any thing to fale, muft go to him that has the ftamp, to have the King’s Seal fet upon their Linnen and Silks; otherwife they #-ould be lin’d, and lambafted with a good Cudgel. This City is fcituated upon the North lide of Ganges, that 'runs by the Walls, and into which there falls alfo another River,fome two leagues upward toward the Weft. In Banam ftands one of the Idolaters principal Pagods, whereof I lhall fpeak in my tond Book, when I come to treat of the Religion of the Banians. About five hundred paces from the City Northward, there is a Mofquee, where are to be feen many Mahometan Sepulchers y whereof fbme are very curious pieces of Architecture. The faireft are every one in the middle of a Garden enclofed with Walls, wherein there are Holes fome half a foot fquare, through which Pafiengers may have a fight of the Tomb within. The molt confiderable of all is as it were four fquare Pedeftal, every fquare whereof is forty paces wide. In the midft of this Platform rifes a Column thirty-two or thirty-five foot high, all of a piece, which three men can hardly embrace. 3 TheBook L Travels in India. The Stone is of a grey colour, and fo hard that I could not fcrape it with iny Knife. As it is Pyramidical, there is a great Bowl at the top, which is en- compafs’d# the upper end with huge Grains of Wheat. Ail the fronts of the Tomb are full of figures of Animals cut in the Stone; and it has been higher above ground than now it feems to be, for feveral old men, that look’d to fome of the Sepulchers, afiur’d me, that within thefe fifty years it had funk above thirty foot into the Earth. They tell you moreover, that it is the Se pulcher of one of the Kings of Bout an who was interred here after he had left his own Countrey to conquer this Kingdom, out of which he was driven by the Succefibrs of Tamerlane. The Kingdom of Boutan is the place from whence they fetch Musk, and I will give you a defcription of it in my third Book. 1 Itay’d at Banarou the 12th and i^tlo ^ and during thofe two days it rain’d continually, but not fo as to Hop my journey ; fo that the evening of the thir teenth day I crofs’d the Ganges, with the Governours Pafs port.. Before you go into the Boat, they fearch the Travellers baggage} wearing Apparel how ever pays nothing of Cuftome, but only Merchandife. The 13^, I went to Baterfour, cofles 2 The iqth, to Satraguy-fera, coltes g The 15/^, to Moniarky-fera^ coftes p The fame day in the morning, after I had travel’d two Leagues, I crofs’d a River call'd Camafarfou, ^ and three Leagues from thence I crofs’d another which they call SWe-yb#} both which I foarded. * The to Gourmabadj coftes g This is a Town upon a River call’d Gondera-fou^ which is crofs’d over a Stone- Bridg.

In the middle whereof there is a fmall Illand, with afair Mofquee built upon it; wherein is to be feen, the Sepulcher of a Nahab or Favourite, call’d Selim-Kan ^ who built it when he was Governour of the Province. There is afair Bridg to crofs over into the Ifland, pav’d and lin’d with large free stone. Upon one fide of the Lake is a great Garden, in the middle whereof is another fair Sepulcher of the Sun of the fame Nahab^ Selim-Kan^ who fuc- ceeded his Father in the Government of the Province. If you would go to the Mine of Sodmelpour^ whereof I Ihall fpeak in the laft Book of thefe Re lations you mult leave the great Road to Patna, and bend to the South through ixberbourgh, and the famous Fortrefs of Rhodes^ of which I fhall treat in the fame place. &gt; The 18^, I ferry’d in a Boat over the River, Sonfoa, which defcends from, the Southern Mountains ^ after you have crofs’d it, the Merchandife pays, a cer tain Toll.

The Holland Company have a Houfe there, yreafon of their Trade jn Saltpeter, which they refine at a great Town call’d m\ar, which is alfo fcituated upon Ganges, ten Leagues above Patna.

A Mmbachi, who commanded a° thoufand Foot, went about to abufe a young Boy in his fervice ^and who^ad feveral times relifted his attempts; complaining alfo to the Governour, and telling him withall, that if his Mafter perfifted to urge him any more, he would cei^ tainly kill him. At length the Captain took his opportunity, at a Houfe which he had in the Country, and forc’d the Boy. The Boy o rewhelm’d with grief and rage, took his opportunity alfo to revenge himfelf} and being one day hunt ing with his Mafter, about a quarter of a League from any of his other Ser-' vants, he got behind him, and cleft his head with his Hanger. After he had done, he rode full fpeed to the City, crying out all the way, that he had kill’d his Mafter for luch a reafon } and went immediately to the Governours Lodg ing } whb fent him to prifon y but he let him out at the end of fix months™ and notwithftanding all the endeavours-which the Captains Kindred us’d to have had him put to death, the Governour durft not condemn him, for fear of the people, who affirm’d that the Boy had done well. I parted from Patna in a Boat for Daca^ the nine and twentieth of Jam- ary 0 between eleven and twelve at noon y and had the River been deep, as it ufes to be after the Rains, I had taken Boat at Hallabas^ or at leaft at Pa- naroii. The fame day I came to lye at fera-Beconcdur^ coftes 15 Five Leagues on this fide Beconcour, you meet with a River call’d Pompn* foH^ which comes from the South, and falls into Ganges. The thirtieth to. Sera-d' Erija^ coftes 17 The one and thirtieth, after we had travefd four Leagues, or thereabout^ we met with the River Kaoa^ which comes from the South. Three Leagues lower,, you meet with another River call’d Chanon, which comes from the North. Four Leagues farther, you difcover th$ River Ergagay which runs from the South *, and at length, fix Leagues beyond,, the River j 4 quera y falling from the fame part of the World ^ all which four Rivers lofe their Names in the Ganges. All that day I faw great Mountains toward the South, diftant from Ganges fometimes ten, and fometimes fifteen Leagues, till at length I came to lodg in Monger-Givjy coftes 18 The firft day of 'January, i666y after I had gone by Water two hours, I faw the Gandet fall into the Ganges, flowing from the North. This is a great Ri ver, that carries Boats. ' k That evening I lay at Zangiray coftes 8 s But in regard of the winding of Ganges all that days journey, I might well reckon them by Water two and twenty Leagues. The fecond day, from between fix in the morning till eleven, I faw three Rivers that threw themfelves into Ganges \ all three defcending from the North. The firft is call’d Ronovay the fecond Tae, the third Chanan. I came to lye at Baquetyour, coftes ^ The third, after four hours upon the Ganges, I met the River Katare, which comes from the North ; and lay at a Village call’d Pongan^ely at the foot of certain Mountains that defceiad to Ganges it felf, coftes *3 The fourth, an hours rowing beyond Pongangcl, I met a great River, call’d Mart-Nadi, cpming from the South ; and I lay at Rage-Mehale, coftes 6 Rage-Mehak, is a City upon the right hand of Ganges \ and if you go by Land,, you- fhall find the high-way, for a League or two, pav’d with Brick to the Town. Formerly the Governors of Bengala refided here} it being an excellent Country for hunting, befides that it was a place of great Trade. But now the River having taken another eourfe, above a good halt League from the City, as well for that reafon, as to keep in awe the King of Aracan, and fe veral Pormguefe Banditi, who are retir’d to the mouths of Ganges, and made excurfions even as far as it felf; both the Governour and the Merchants have remov’d themfelves to Baea, which is at prefent a ; large City, and a Town of great Trade. The fixth,being arriv’d at aconfiderable Town,call’d Donafourfix. Leaguesfroai Rage-Mehale I parted with iMoiilieur Bernier, who was going to CafenbJ^Book I. Travels in India* 55 and thence to Qgonli by land } for when the River is low, there is^io going by Water, by reafon of a great Bank of Sand that lies before a City call’d San- tmu \ lay that night at Tout if our ^ diltant from Rage-mehale, coftes 12 I faw there at Sun-rifmg a great number of Crocodiles lying upon the Sand. The feventh, I came to Acer at, coftes 2 5 From Acer at to Daca, it is counted by Land forty-five Leagues. All that day I faw fuch a vaft number of Crocodiles, that I had a great defire to fhoot at one, to try whether the vulgar report were true, that a Musket-lhot would not pierce their skin. The bullet hit him in the jaw, and made the blood gulh out } however it would not ftay in the place, but plung’d into the River. The eight, I faw again a great number lying upon the bank of the River, and made two fhot at two with three bullets at a time. As foon as they were woun ded, they turn’d themfelves upon their backs,opening their throats, and di’d upon thefpot. # v . ' , ‘ That dayT came to lie at Bonhadia, coftes 17 The Crows were here the caufe that we found a very fair Fifh, which the Fiflier- men had hid among the Ofiers by the fide of the River} for when our Water-men law the Crows in great numbers hovering, and making an hideous noife about the Ofiers, they prefently conjedur d that there was fomething more than ordinary .* and they made fo diligent a fearch, that at length they found an excellent difli of meat. The ninth two hours after noon,we met with a River call’d Ctorwr,that runs from the North, and we lay at Dampour, coftes 1 &lt;5 The tenth, we lay by the River-fide in a place remote from Houfes, and we travefl’d that day, coftes 15 The eleventh,toward evening, being come to that part where Ganges divides it felf into three Arms, whereof one runs to Daca ; we lay at a large Town, upon the entry of the great Channel, which Town is call’d Jatrapour, coftes 20 They that have no luggage,may make a fliort-cut from Jatrapoffr to Daca, and fave much ground, by reafon of the many windings of the River. The twelfth, about noon, we paft by a large Village call’d Bagamara, and came to lie at Kafiata, another great Town, coftes 11 The thirteenth, about noon we met with a River, two leagues from Daca, call’d Laquia, which runs from the North-Eaft. Juft againft the Point where the two Rivers join, there Hands a Fortrefs of each fide, with feveral pieces of Can non. Half a league lower, appears another River call’d P^/«,upon which there is a fairBridg of Brick, which Mirz.a-Mola caus'd to be built. This River comes from the North-Eaft} and half a league upward appears another River call’d Ca- damtali, that runs from the North, over which there is a nother Bridg of Brick. On both Tides of the River are feveral Towers, as it were inchas’d with feveral heads of men, executed for robbing upon the high way. About evening we came to Daca, having travell’d by water that day, coftes 9 Daca is a great Town,that extends it felf only in length} every one coveting to have an Houfe by the Ganges-fide. The length of this Town is above two leagues. And indeed from the laft Brick-Bridge which I mention’d to there is but one continued row of Houfes feparated one from the other ; inhabited for the moft part by Carpenters,that build Galleys and other fmall Vefiels. Thefe Houfes are properly no more than paltry Huts built up with Bamboucs, and daub’d over with fat Earth. Thofe of Daca are not much better built .* The Governours Palace is a place enclos’d with high Walls, in the midft whereof is a pitiful Houfe, built only of Wood. He generally lodges ia Tents, which he caufes to be fet upin a great Court of that Enclofure. The Hollanders finding that their Goods were not r rU t ^ le ordinar y Houfes of Daca, have built them a very fair Houfe} and the have another, which is reafonably handfom.

From the twenty-third to the twenty-ninth, I brought up Goods, to the value of iiooo Roupies} and after I had embark’d them, I took my leave. . The twenty-ninth, in the evening, I departed from Daca,the Hollanders hew jngrnie company for two leagues, with their little Barques Arm'd: Nor did we fpare the SpamJh-\Mine all that time. Having been upon the River from the twenty-ninth qi January to the eleventh of February, 1 left my Goods and Ser- yants at the Barque at Acer at j where I took a Boat that earn’d me t© a great Village call d Mirdapur.

The feventeenth in the evening, I took water for Oagucli^ in a Bark of four teen Oars, which the Hollanders lent me } and that night and the next I lay upon the River. * The ninteenth toward evening, I pafs’d by a large Town call’d Nandi, far ther than which the Sea does not flow. Here the Wind blew fo fiercely and the water grew fo rough, that we were forc’d to ftay three or four hours and ly by the fhore. The twentieth, I arriv’d at Ouguelt, where I flay’d till the fecond oiMarch. During which time the Hollanders bid me very welcome, and made it their bufinefs to fhew me all the divertiferoents which the Country was capable to afford. We went feveral times in Pleafure-Boats upon the River, and we had a Banquet ofall the Delicacies that the Gardens of Europe could have afforded us. Salads of all forts, Colewarts, Afparagus, Peafe, but our chiefeft Difh was Beans } the Hollanders being very curious to have all forts of Pulfeand Herbs in their Gardens, though they could never get Artichokes to grow in that Country. The fecond of March I left Ongueli, and the fifth arriv’d at Cafenbafan 1 he next day I went to Madefon-Barfakj, to know whether the Nahab had fent any other orders to his Receiver. For I told you a little before, that I wrote upon the place to Cha-Ett-Kan, to complain of his proceedings, and to know the reafon why my Bill of Exchange was not paid. The Director of the Holland Fadories writ a Letter alfo in my behalf, which I enclofed, wherein he reprefented to the Nahab, that I was too well known to him, as having been formerly with him at Amadabat, in the Army in Decan, and other places, do deferve fuch hard ufuage. That he ought to confider, that I being the only perfon that brought the chiefeft rarities of Europe to the Indies, it was not the way to make me eager of returning any more, as he himfelf had invited me to do, to fend me away in a difeontent. Befides, that the credit or my report would difeourage others from coming to the Indies, fearing the fame ufuage as I had receiv’d. Neither mine nor the Diredors Letter produc’d that effed which we expeded. Nor was I much better fatisfi’d with the new order which the Nahab fent to his Receiver j which was to pay me* abating twenty thoufand Roupies of the fum which we had agreed upon; and if I would not take the remainder, that I might come and fetch my goods again* , 1 ^ s til dealing of the Nahab, proceeded from a feurvy trick that was play’d by three Canary-birds at the Great Moguls Court. The ftory whereof «thus in ihort. Anrengzjeb, that now reigns, at the inftigation of two Perfians and a Banian^ as brought up a cuftom very much to the difad vantage of Merchants, that ^ome out of Europe, and other parts, to fell Jewels at Court. For whether fY co ^ Tl s into India either by Land or Sea, the Governour of the place wnere they firft arrive, has order to fend them to the King, together with - eir goods, whether they will or no. As the Governour of Surat dealt by they^r 1665, fending me to Dehli, or Jehanabad, where the King 1 here were then attending upon his Majefty, two Perfians and a Banian, ton entrafted t0 view and examine all the Jewels which are to be fold of u ^ ne Berfians is call’d Nahab-Akel~Kan, that is, the Prince r e who keeps all the Kings Jewels. The name of the other is ^ 1 Mirut*Travels in I N D I A. Parc If, Mvrz~d~Moufon^ whofe buflnefs is to rate eveiy flone. The Banian^ whole name is Nalik^n^ is to fee whether the Stones be falfe or not, or whether they have any defedt. Thefe three men have obtain’d a Licence from the Kina t( j view, before ever he does, whatever for reign Merchants lhail bring, to Court andtoprefent their goods to him themfelves. And though they are und r an Oath not to take any thing from the Merchants, yet they extort whatever they can get from them, though it be their mine. W hen they fee any thing that is lovely, and likely to bring great profit, they would perfwade you to fell.it to them for lefs by half than the Sjhg us worth; and if you refufe to let them have it, when they are in the Kings prefence, they will feta price upon it at half the value •, knowing that Aurengz.tb is not very covetous of Jewels, loving his Money far better. Upon the Kings Feftival-day, of which I lhail fpeak in another place, all the Princes and Nobility of the Court pre- fent him with moft magnificent gifts. And when they cannot meet with Jewels, they fend him Roupies of Gold, which the King likes far better than Stones- though Jewels are the more honourable prefent. Therefore when this Feflivai draws nigh, he ifliies out of his Treafury, a great quantity of Diamonds, Ru bies, Emraulds, and Pearls, which he who is - entrufted to prize the Stones, de livers to feveral Merchentsto fell to the Nobility, who are bound to prefent the King; by which means the King gets the Money and his Jewels again. There is alfo another thing very difadvantageous to a Merchant Jeweller, which is, that when the King has feen the Stones, no Prince nor Nobleman that knows of it, will ever buy them. Befides, while thefe three perfons, who are entrufted to view the Jewels, are confidering and examining them at their Lodgings, feveral Bam ms refort thither, who are expert, feme in Diamonds, fome in Rubies, fome in Emraulds, and others in Pearls, who write down the weight, goodnefs, cleannefs, and colour of every piece. So that when a Mer chant goes afterwards to any Prince or Governour of any Province, thefe people fend them a note of what he has, and the price, which they fet down at half the value. For in trade thefe Banians are a thoufand times worfe than the Jews ; more expert in all forts of cunning tricks, and more malicioufly mifehie- vous in their revenge. Now you ihall hear what a trick thefe unworthy peo ple ferv’d me. When I arriv’d at Gehanabad^ one of them came to my Lodging, and told me, he had order from the King to fee what I had brought, before I expos’d my goods in the Kings prefence. They would have rather that the King had not been at Gehanabad^ for they would have then endeavour’d to have bought them themfelves, to gain thereby, by felling them again to the King, or the Nobility upon occafion; which they could never perfwade me to. The next day they came to fee me all three, one after another} and they would needs have of me, amongft other things, a Jewel of nine great Pearls, in the falhion of a Poar, the biggeft wTereof weigh’d thirty Carats, and the leaf: fixteen; together with another fingle Pearl like a Pear, of fifty-five Carats. As for the Jewel, the King took it; but for the fingle Pearl, they finding that .what ever they could fay, I would not be wrought upon to fell them any bargains, fo order’d it, that before I had fhew’d my Jewels to the King, GUfer-Km the Kings Unckle faw, and kept it, telling me he would give me as good a price as the King; and defin’d me not to fpeak of it, for indeed he hadade- fign to make a prefent to the.King. ^ When the King had made choice offuchof my Jewels as he pleas’d, bought of me feveral pieces, and at the fame time agreed with me for the great Pearl. Some days after he paid me, according as we had agreed, ex cept for the Pearl, upon whidh he would have abated me ten thoufand Rou pies. For the two Perjians and the Banian had malitioufly inform’d him, that at my firft arrival, they could have bought the Pearl for eight or ten thoufand Roupies lefs than 1 had valu’d it to him ; which was abfolutely falfe. There upon Giafer-Kan telling me, that if I vcould not take his Money, I might have my Jewel again; I took him at his word, afiiiring him, he fhould never fee it again as long as he liv’d. And I was as good as my word. And indee that which made me the more refolute was, that I was refoiv’d to carry fome-Book I. Travels in I n d i a. fomething which was confiderable to Cha-Ett-Kan ; for could I have had my li berty upon my arrival at Surat to have gone to him, I would never have feen the King at Gehanabad^ about which I had a very great quarrel with the Go- vernour of Surat. For when I came to vifit him, he told me prefently, that the cafe was alter’d from what it had been fince my laft being there, for that the King was refolvM to have the firll view of all Curioikies imported into his Kingdom. I was above four Months contending in vain with the Gover- nour; but nothing wopld ferve ^ I muft go to the King, and for fear I fhould take another Road, he fent fifteen Horfemen along with me as far as Sha- ■ laour. • 'v When I went for Bengala, thefe Overfeers of the Jewels, out of meer fj)ite, and, it may be, fet on by Giafar-Kan i to be reveng’d of me for denying to let him have my Jewel, writ to Cha-Efl-Kan^ that I intended to ihew him certain Jewels, among the reft a very fair Pearl, which I had fold to Giafer-Kan • but that he had given it me again, becaufe he underflood that I would have made him pay for it, ten thoufand Roupies more than it was worth. They wrote alfo the particular proportion of all the other Stones which Icarry’d. And upon this falfe and malicious advice it was, that Cha-Efl-Kan^ who receiv’d not this informa tion till he had deliver’d me my Bill of Exchange, would abate me for my whole parcel, twenty thoufand Roupies, which he reduc’d at length to ten thoufand ; and well 1 had it too. Since I told you before, what a Prefent I gave to Cha-Eft-Kam j I think it not amifs to tell you, what I gave the King, to Nahab Giafer-Kan, to the Eunuch of the Grand Begum, AurengsLeb'% Sifter, the Great Treafiirer, and the Porters of the Treafury. For you mufl take notice, that whoever he be, that craves Audience of the King, they ask him in the firfl place, where the Pre fent is which he intends for the King ; and examine whether it be fitting to prefent to his Majefly. For no man mufl come into his prefence empty handed, though it be an honour dearly purchas’d. Coming then to Gehanabad, I went to make my obeifance to the King} and this is the Prefent which I made him. In the firfl place, a Buckler of Brafs highly embofs’d, and very richly guilt, the coil of the Guilding alone amounting to two hundred Ducats of Gold, or eighteen hundred Livres} the value of the whole piece coming to four thou fand three hundred feventy eight Livres. In the middle thereof was the ilory oiCunim, who threw himfelf and his Horfe into the Barathrum, when the Earth gap’d, near Rome. Round the outermoft Circle of the Buckler,'was re- prefented the liege of Rochel. It was wrought by one of the befl Workmen in France, by the order of the Cardinal Richlieu. All the grea| Lords that were* about Aureng^eb at that time, were charm’d at the beauty of the Workman- fhip, and told him, he could not do better, than to put it upon the great Ele phant, which carry’d the Standard before his Maiefly when he march’d into the Field. I prefented him alfo with a Battle-Axe of Chryflal of the Rock^thefides where of were fet with Rubies and Emraulds, enchas’d in Gold in the body of the Chry- ftal, which coil three thoufand one hundred and nineteen Livres. Moreover, I prefented him with a Saddle after the Turky fafhion, embroider’d with little Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, which cofl two thoufand eight hundred and ninety-two Livres. 1 v ' . ^ I prefented him alfo with another Saddle and Foot-cloath, embroider’d with Gold and Silver, to the value of one thoufand feven hundred and thirty Livres. The whole Prefent amounting to twelve thoufand one hundred and nineteen , Livres. The Prefent which I made to Giafar-Kan, the Great Moguls Unkle, was a Ta ble, with other nineteen pieces to make a Cabinet, all natural Stones,of divers co lours, reprefenting the fhapes of feveral Birds and Flowers. The work was made at Florence, and cofl two thoufand one hundred and fifty Livres. A perfedRuby Ring, which cofl one thoufand and three hundred Livres. To the great Treafurer, I prefented a Watch in a Gold Cafe, fet with fmall Ltnraulds, at feven hundred and twenty Li vres. * i 2 T 0Travels in India. Part II. To the Porters of the Kings Treafury, and thofe that deliver out the Mon out of the Treafury, two hundred Roupies,at three hundred Livres. ^ To the Eunuch of the Great Begnw-&gt; Sifter to Aunngwb^ Watch in a painted Cafe, which coft two hundred and fixty Livres. / 1 a All thefe Prefents which I made, as well to the Great Mogul, as to Ch«-E(l Kan, Giafer-Kan, his Majellies Uncles} as alfo the Great Treafurer, to the St' wards of theHoufes of the i&lt;Ws r and thofe that brought me twice’the C^' or Habit of Honour from the King, and as many times from the Begum hj s si fter, and once from Giafar Kan all thefe Prefents, I fay, came to twenty-three thoufand one hundred fourfcore and feven Livres. So true it is, that they who have any bulinefs to do at the Court of the great Princes, as well in Turky a s in Terfia and in the Indies, muft not pretend to do any thing in reference to their affairs, till they Lave their Prefents, and thofe very confiderable, ready. Belides that his Purfe muft be continually open to divers Officers of meaner reputation* who may be able to ferve him. I did not mention in my firft Volume thePre- fent which I made to him that brought me the Gala at from the King of Terfia to whom I gave two hundred Crowns. CHAP.' IX. The Road from Surat to Golconda. T Have made feveral journeys to Golconda, and have taken feveral Roads; ^ fometimes by Sea embarking from Ormm for Malifpata fometimes fetting but from Agra, but moft often from Surat, which is the chiefeft landing-place of Indolftan. But in this Chapter I will only fpeak of the common Road from Surat to Golconda ; wherein I comprehend that of Agra ; which Road comes ia at Dultabat, as I ffiall afterwards relate, making mention only of two journeys which I made in 1645, and 1652, for fear of tiring the Reader. I departed from Surat in the year 1645, upon the nineteenth of January, and came to lye at Cambari, coftes 3 From Cambari to Barnoli, coftes - v 9 From Barnoli to Bear a, coftes 12 From Bear a to* Navopour, coftes 16 This is the place where grows the beft Rice in the World, that finells like Musk. is 8 17 14 14 10 10 10 From Navapour to Rinkula, Coft«S From Rinkula to Pipelnar, coftes From Pipelnar to Nimpour, coftes From Nimpour to Patane, coftes From Patane to Sec our a, coftes From Secoura to Baquela, coftes From Baquela to Difcon, coftes Prom Difcon to Dultabat, coftes Dultabat is one of the beft Fortrefles in the Kingdoms of the Great Mo^d y Upon a Mountain every way fteepthe only way to it being fo narrow, that but one Horfe, or one Camel can go at a time. This City is at the foot of the Mountain, very well wall’d. And this place of fuch importance, which the Moguls loft, when the Kings of Golconda and Vifapour revolted from them, was retaken in the Reign of Jehan-guire, by a fubtle ftratagem. Sultan Courom,viho was afterwards call’d Cha~jeha?j, commanded in Decan the Army of the King his Father ; and Aft-Kan, Father in Law to Cha-Eft-Kan, who was one of the Generals, gave the Prince fome fort of language which fo highly offended him, that immediately fending for one of his Papouche’s, or Shoo’s, he caus’d him to have fix blows given him upon the Bonnet which among the Indians is the/ Book I. ' Travels in India. higheft indignity can be put upon a man, after which he is no more to appear in the Prince’s prefence. This was done by confent between the Prince and the General, to deceive the World, more efpecially any Spies which the Kins of notour might have in the Prince’s Army. The report of difgrace was immediately fpread abroad .• andhehimfelf flying for Sanftuary to the King of Fifafour, whohad not cunning enough todifcern the impofture, was welcom’d by the fame King, and aflur d of his protedtion. feeing himfeltTo well receiv d, begg d leave of the King, that he might retire with ten or twelve of his Women, and as many of his Servants, into the Fortrefs of Dultabat which was granted. , He enter d the Town with eight or ten Camels, the two Caia-vJs or Utters on each fide of the Camel being clofelhut, to keep the Women frdm being ieen. Lut inltead of Women, he had put into every Cajava two Souldiers all bold and refolv’d men, as were alfo every one of the fuppos’d Eunuchs that led the Camels fo that he had no great difficulty to cut the Garrifon in pieces not being upon their guard; and to make himfelf Mafter of the place which has been ever fince under the Power of the Great Mogul. There are in the plac» a great number of excellent Pieces of Cannon, and the Cannoniers are genera'llv Enghfi) or Hollanders. True it is, that there is one little Mountain higher than the Fortrefs; but there is hardly any way to it, but through the fame Fortrefs There was a Dutch Engineer, who after he had ferv’d the King fifteen or fifteen years, defir’d leave to begone, and the Wo/WTompany it felf, that had recom mended him to the Service, did all they could to obtain it ; but they could ne ver procure it; becaufe he was an excellent Cannonier, and very skilful inmake- ing Fire-works. The Raja Jeffeing, who is the mofl: Potent of all the Idolatrous Princes oi India, and who was mofl: powerfully Inftrumental to put the Crown upon Aureng-Z.eb’s Head, was fent as Gaiera of the Army of this King againft the Raja Seva-gi • and palling by the Fortrefs of Dultahat, this Dmch- Cannomer went to wait upon him, all the Cannoniers of the Army being Fran- gir.s, as well as he. The Hollander laying hold of this opportunity, told the that if he would procure him a Licence to depart, he would fhew him a way to get up Cannon, and to mount them upon that Mountain which commanded the Fortrefs •• for they had already wall’d it about, and put Souldiers upon it to keep it fecure. The Raja pleas’d with his propofal, allur’d him that he would procure him the King’s Licence, if he perform’d what he had propos’d. Thereupon the Hollander undertaking and accomplifhing his defign, the Raja was as good as his word, and obtain’d of the King to difmifs the IW&gt;-Cannonier •• who came to when I was there, about the beginning of the year i ddy ; whence he em bark d for Holland. From Dultahat to Aureng-abat y cofles . ^nng.abat was formerly but a Village, till Mreng-ub made it a City, though t be not wall d.

In regard there are great Itore of Lakes in it, there is alfo great ftore of Filh. Above all the reft, there is a fort of Smelt, that has but one bone in the middle, which is moft delicious food. Nature has contributed more than Art, toward the making thefe Lakes, whereof the Country is full • which are generally in places fomewhat rais’d,fo that you need do no more than make a lit tle Dam upon the plain-fide to keep in the water. Thefe Dams or Banks arefome- times half a league longand after the rainy feafons are over, they open the Sluces from time to time to let out the water into the adjacent Fields where it is receiv’d by divers little Channels to water particular grounds. Bapiager is the name of the Metropolis of this Kingdom ; but vulgarly it is call’d Golconda, from the name ofa Fortrefs, not above two leagues diftant from it, where the King keeps his Court. This Fortrefs is about two leagues in cir- ctiit, and by confequence requires a numerous Guard. It is as it were a Town whet e the King keeps his T realure .• having left Bagnagar,o.\ox lince it was lack’d by the Army, which Aureng-z.eb brought againft it. Ugmgar is then the City, which they vulgarly call ; and it was foun- ded by the great Grandfather of the prefent King; upon the importunity of one of his Wives, whom he paflionately lov’d, whofe name was Before that it was only a place of Pleafure, where the King had very fair Gardens, till at length his Wife continually reprefenting to him the delicacies of the lituation for the buildi ng a City and a Palace, by reafon of the River j he laid the foundations, and order’d that it (hould bear the name of his Wife, calling it, Ba.g-Naga.r, that is to fay, the Garden of Nagar. This City lies in feventeen degrees of Eleva tion, wanting two minutes. The Country round about is a flat Country, only neer the City are feveral Rocks, as you fee about Fomain-Bkait. A great River walhes the Walls of the City upon the South-weft-ilde, which, neer to Maflipa- tails into the Gulf of Bengala. At Bagnagar you crofs this River over a Bridg no lefs beautiful than Pont-Neuf ax. Pari,. The City is little lefs than Or- well-built, and full of Windows. There are many fair large Streets,butnot being well-pav’d, they are dufty, as are all the Cities of and which is very offenlive in the Summer. Before you come to the Bridg, you muft pafs through a large Suburb, call’d trengabad, about a league in length; where live all the Merchants, the Brokers, Handicraft-Erades, and ih general, all the meaner fort 1 of people ; The City bung nil,abited only by ] perfons of Quality, Officers of the King’s Houfe, niters of Juftice, and Officers of the Army.

Upon which as i ^ thofe where the Elephants are kept, there are very fair Gardens, wherein tl grow Trees of that bignefs, that it is a thing of great wonder, how thofe a! e ihould bear fo vafl a burthen. eArc ^ About fifty years fince, they began to build a magnificei t Pagod in the Ct which would have been the faireft in all had it been finilh’d. The s ^ ’ are to be admir’d for their bignefs; And that wherein the Nich is made wh’T* on thatfide where they fay their Prayers, is an entire Rock &gt; offuch a prodJ' bulk, that it was five years before five or fix-hunder’d men, continually emnlov’If could hew it out of its place.

I will tell -on h a after the reafon it remains imperfed .* For had it been finilh’d. in all reafon in!!} excell’d all the boldeft Structures of Jt/ia. ' a On the Other fide of the City, as yon go to Maflifatan^ there are two great Lakes, being each about a league in compafs, wherein there ride feveral Pinks richly adorn’d for the King’s Pleafure y and upon the Banks are feveral fair Houfes that belong to the Principal Lords of the Court. Upon three fides of theGity ftands a very fair wherein are the Tombs of the Kings of Golconda : and about four in' the afternoon there is a Dole of Bread and FiUh to all the Poor that come. If you would fee any thing that is rare, you muff go to view thefe Tombs upon a Feffival-day. For then from morning till night they are hung with rich Tapeftry. As for the Government and Policy which is Obferv’d in this City: In thefirft place, when a Granger comes to the Gates, they fearch him exactly, to fee if he have any Salt or Tobacco about him; for thofe Commodities bring the Kins his greateff Revenue. Sometimes a Stranger lhall wait a day or two, before he lhall have leave to enter. For a Souldier firfl gives notice to the officer that com mands the Guard, and then he fends to the Deroga^ to know what he ffiall do. Now, becaufe it many times happens that the Deroga is bufy,. or gone to take a walk out of the City,or elfe for that fometimes the SouMier himfelf pretends he cannot find the Deroga, only, to create himfelf more errands, to get the more Mo ney *, a Stranger is forc’d to endure all this delay,fometimes,as I have faid before/ for a day or two. When the King fits to do Juff ice, I obferve that he comes into the Balcone that looks into the Piazza, and all that have bufmefs ftand below, juft againU the place where the King fits. Between the People and the Walls of the Palace are fix’d in the ground three rows of Poles, about the length of an Half-Pike, to the ends whereof they tye certain ropes a-crofs one upon another. Nor is any perfon whatfoever permitted to pafs beyond thofe bounds, nntefs he be call’d. This Bar, which is never fet up,but when the King fits in Judgment, runs along the whole bredth of the Piazza ; and juft againft the Balcone there is a Bar to open,to let in thofe that are call’d. Then two men; that each of them hold a Cord by the end, extended all the bredth of the paftage, have nothing to do but tolet fAl the Cord, for any penon that is call’d to ftep over it,, A Secretary of Sta^pts be low under the ba) :t&gt;ne, to receive all Petitions ^ and when he has five or fix to gether,he puts them in a Bag,and then an Eunuch,who ftands in the Balcone neer the King, lets down a ftring, to which the Bag being ty’d.he drawsit up,aiidpre- fents it to his Majefty. 1 Every Munday the chiefeft of the Nobility mount the Guard, every one in their turn, and are never reliev’d till at the eight days end. There arefome of thefe Lords -that have five or fix thoufand men under their command j and they lye encamp’d in their Tents round about the City. When they mount the Guard, every one goes from his own Habitation to the Rendevouz y but when they are reliev’d, they march in good order over the Bridg, thence through the long Street into the Piazza, where they draw up before the Balcone. In the firft place,, march ten or twelve Elephants, more or lefs, ac cording to the quality of the Captain of the Guard. There are fome of thefe Elephantsv*mmriwrm Travels in India. 65 Elephants that carry Cages, which in fome fort referable the Body of a little Coach} there are others that have but one man to guide them, and another in the Cage who carries a Banner. After the Elephants, follow the Camels by two and two, fometimes to the number of thirty or forty . Every Camel carries a kind of Packfaddle, upon which is fatten’d a little Culverine, which a certain Engineer, clad in a skin from head to foot, and. fitting upon the‘Crupper of the Camel, with a lighted Match in his hand, dextroufly manages from one fide to another before the Balcone, V where the King fits. \ ; - v ; /; ^ - After them come the Coaches, attended by the Domettick Servants of the Commander: Next to them follow the lead-Horfes, and then the Lord appears, to whom all this Equipage belongs, attended by ten or twelve Curtifans,that ttay for him at the end of the Bridg, an skip and dance before him to the ?i^a. Behind him the Cavalry and infantry march in good order.* which being afhew, wherein there was much of delight and ftate, all the while I ftaid at Bagnabar^ which was about four Months, I had the divertifement to fee them out of my Lodging in the great Street every week as they march’d by. The So'uldiers wear no other Clothes than only three or four ells of Calicut, with which they cover half their Bodies behind and before. They wear their hair very long, and tie it up in a knot upon the top of the crown, like the wo men, who have no other Headgear than only a piece of Linnen with three cor ners, one that comes to the middle of the head, and the other two, which they tie under their chins. The Souldiers do not wear Hangers or Scimitars like the Per fans ; but broad Swords like the Switzers, as well for a thruft, as a blow, which they hang in a Girdle. The Barrels of their Muskets are ftronger than ours, and much neater} for their Iron is better, and not fo fubjedt to break. Their Cavalry carry .Bows and Arrows, a Buckler and a Battel-Ax, an Headpiece and a Jacket of Mail, that hangs down from the Head-piece over their Shoul ders. . -,v • ..’r. There are fp great a number of comfnon Women as well in the City as in the Suburbs, and in the Fortrefs, which is like another City, that there are generally above twenty thoufand fetdown in the Derogas Book; without which licence,it is not lawful for any Woman to profefs the Trade. They pay no tribute to the King} only they are oblig’d to come, a certain number of them, with their Go- vernefs, and their Mufick every Friday,and prefent themfelves before the Balcone. If the King be there, they dance before him. if he intend not to come,an Eunuch comes into the Balcone, and makes them a fign to retire. In the cool of the evening they ftand at the doors of their Houfes, which are for the moft part little Huts} and when night comes,they fet up a Candle or a lighted Lamp for a Signal .* Then it is alfo that they open all the Shops where they fell Tari } which is a cer tain drink made of the juice ofa Tree, and is as Sweat as our new Wines. They fetch it fome five or fix league off,upon Horfes,that carry two earthen-Bottles of each fide, and trot at a great rate *, of which there come every day to the City above five or fix hunder’d. This King hasaconfiderable Revenue by the Impott which he lays upon this Tari. And for that reafon he permits fo many common Women, in regard ids for their fake that fo much Tari is confum’d 7 thofe that fell it, for that caufe, keeping their Shops by thofe Houfes. Thefe fort of Women are fo nimble and adtive,that when the prefent King went to fee Majli^atan^ nine of them undertook to reprefent the figure of an Elephant, four making the four feet, four the body, and one the trunk} upon which the King, fitting in a kind of Throne, made his entry into the City. All the Men and Women of Golconda are well proportion’d, and of comely, ttatures; and fair enough in their countenances} only the Country-people are a little more fwart. ~The prefent King of Golconda bears the Name of Abdbul~Coutou-Sha ^ and I will tell the Reader in a few words, from whence he drew his Original. ’ In the lyeign Axbar King of India, the Father of Jehan-Gdr, the Territories of the wh^ not exten d farther Southward then Narbider *, fo that the River ich runs by it, and which coming from the South, empties it felfinto Ganges, e P ara ted their Dominions from the Territories of the Raja of Narfwgm, that * K itr^tch’dTravels in India. •9 ftretch’d as far zs C'ape-Comorw^ the other Kajas being only hisSubjeftsandT' pending upon him. This Maja and his Succellors have been always at Wars with them that fucceeded to Tamerlane or Temur-leng in India ; ard their Power wa fo great, that the laft Raja^ who was at War with 'MUar^ brought into Field four Armies under as many Generals. The molt conliderable of his Armies lav in thofe Provinces, which atthis day are call’d the Kingdom of Go Icon da- the fecond was quarter’d in the Provinces of rifapoitr, the third in the Province and the fourth in theTerritories of Brampour.The Raja of Narjjngue dying witheut Children,the four Generals divided among themfelves the Countries vvhich thev pollefs’d with their Army,and took upon them the title of Kings,the one oiGohl da^the other of K^o^r,the other of Rrampour^nd the fourth of 'Tahdbk.Thomh the Raja were an Idolater,neverthelefs his four Generals were Mahumetm • and he of G ole on da was of the Sed of A/^,defcended from an Ancient Family of the T %r comans inhabit the Country ofHamadan in Rerfia. This General,as I have faid,was more conliderable than any of the remand fome few days after the death of the Rajafhty won a famous Vidory from the Mogul ; fo that he could not hinder them from afliiming their feveral Sovereignties. But after that, Jeban- Guir, the Son of conquer’d again the Kingdom of Br amp our, clajehm the Son of Jehan-Guir recover’d the Kingdom of Dultabat, and Aureng-ub the Son of Cha-jehan recover’d fbme part of the Kingdom of Fifapour. As for the King of Golconda, neither Cha-jehan, nor Aureng-zA? diflurb’d him, but let him reft in peace,upon condition that he fhould pay to theMogul ah annual tribute of 200000 Pagods. At prefent the greateft Raja on this fide Ganges is the fcaja of Feloupwhofe Territories extend to Cap e-Comorin, and who fucceeded to fome part of the Territories of the Raja of Narfingue: But in regard there is no Trade in his Country,and by confequence no concourfe of ftrangers, there is little notice taken of him. The prefent King of Golconda has ho Sons,but three Daughters, who are all married. The eldeft Efpous’d one of the Kinfmen of the Grand-Cheh of Mecca. Nor muft we forget fome paftages that fell out before this Marriage.The Ckcicoming to Golconda in the habit of a Faquir, for fome Months lodg’d without the Gate 6 f the Palace,difdaining to give any anfwer to feveral Courtiers, that demanded what his bulinefs was. At length the thing being made known to the King, he fent his chief Phylitian, who fpoke good Arabick^ to know of the Chek^ what he had to requeft, and the reafon of his coming. The Phylitian, and fome other Lords of the Court that difeours’d him alfo, finding him to be a perfon of great Wit and Learning, brought him to the King,who was very well fatisfi’d with his afpeft and his prefence. But at length the Cki^declaring to him, that he came to Efpoufe the Princefs} that propofal very much furpriz’d the Prince, and was look’d upon by the greateft part of the Court, as made by a perfon not well in his wits. At firft the King only laugh’d at him. But when he found him ob- ftinately perfevering in his demand, in-fo-much that he threatn’d the Countrey with fome ftrange Calamity,if the Princefs were not given to him in Marriage, he was committed to Prifon, where he lay a long time. At length the King thinking it more to the.purpofe to fend him back into his own Countrey, caus’d him to be Ihip’d away zt Ma/lipatan, in a Vefl'el that earn’d Goods and Pilgrims to Mec ca, whence they travel by land to Mecca, About two years after the fame Che{ return’d again to Golconka, and order’d his affairs fo well, that he Efpous’d the Princefs, and won an high reputation in the Kingdom, which he governs at this day,and is very Potent. He it was that kept the King from furreridring the For- trefs of Golconda, whither he was retir’d, when Aureng-teb and his Son took fiabar, as I lhall tell you by and by,threatning to killhim, if he would notrefolve fo hold #t out, and not deliver the keys to the enemy. This bold a&amp;ion was the reafbn which made the King love him ever afterwards \ and that he takes his counfe* in all weighty affairs,not as he is ttie King’s Son-in-Law,but as heisagreat Minifter of State,and the chiefeft perfon,next the King, in all the Court, “at was that has put a ftop to the finifhing the great Pagod in Bagnagar,jMK% threaten’d the whole Kingdom with fome great Calamity, if they went totwaia with the work. This Prince is a paffionate Lover of all thofe that profejs the Mathematicks, and underftands them as well. For which reafon, though neBook I. « Travels in India. : $n a Mahumetan, he is a great Favourer of all the Chriilians, who are vers’d in that Science, as he has particularly teftifi’d to Father Ephram 0 a pafirg through Golconda for Tegn, whither he was fent by his Superiors. He did all he could to Qblige him to ftay in the Country, and offer’d to build him a Home and a Church at his ownexpences ; telling him, he ihould neither want employ ment, nor Hearers, in regard there were feveral Tonvgmfe Chrillians, and feve- ral Armenians that came thither to trade. But Father Ephraim having a particu lar Order to go to Pejru y could not accept of his Offer j yet when he went to take his leave of the Cheeky he prefented him with a Calaat*the moll noble that &lt;- was in his Wardrobe ^ being the whole habit * the Cap, the Cahrj or large Veft, the Arcaloii or fliort Calldck, two pair of Drawers, two Shirts, and two Scarfs, which they wear about their necks, and over their heads to keep off the heat of the Sun. The Friar was furpriTd at the prefent, and gave the Check^to underfland, that it was not proper for him to wear it .• however the Ckcf would force him to take it, telling him he might accommodate fomeofhis Friends with it. Two months after Father Ephraim bellow’d the fame Prefent upon me, be ing at Surat } for which I return’d him thanks. The CkcTfeeing he could not detain the Father,and unwilling he fhould go a- foot from to Maflipatan^ oblig’d him to take an Oxe, with two Men to lead it y and becaufe he could not perfwadehim to take alfo thirty Pagods,which he prefented the Father withall, he commanded the two men, when they came to Maflipatany to leave the Oxe and the thirty Pagods with him, which they did very pundually ; for otherwife at their return to Golconday they had forfeited their lives. I will finifh the Hiflory of Father Ephram^ when I come to the defeription of 6W, which is the principal place that the For toga Is have in the Indies. The fecond Daughter of the King of Golconda was married to Saltan Ma- humady the eldeft Son of Aarengz^eh ; the occafion whereof was this .* Mir- pimohy Geileraliffimo of the King of Golcondah Army , and who had been very ferviceable to his Mailer, to fettle the Crown upon his head, according to the cuftom, left with the King as a mark of his fidelity, both his Wife and Chil dren in Holtage y for he was fent to reduce certain Rajas in BengaUy that were in Rebellion. He had feveral Daughters, but only one Son, who had a great train, and made a great noife at Court. The reputation and riches which Mir- gimola had gain’d, rais’d him up feveral Enemies, who endeavour’d in his ab- fence to mine him, and to put him out of the Kings favour. They pretended that the great power of Mirgimola was very much to be fufpefled -y that all hi? defigns tended to dethrone him, and to fettle the Kingdom of Golconda up- eh his own Son y that it behov’d him not to flay till the remedy were pail cure, but to rid himfelf of an Enemy, fo much the more to be fear’d, the clofer he kept his intentions^ and that the fhorteil and bell way was to poyfonhim. The King being ealily perfwaded, gave them leave and authority to ad as they pleas’d for his fecurity ; but having mifs’d of their delign for three or four times together, Mirgimola's Son began to fmell the plot 5 and immediately gave tdvice thereof to his Father. It is not known what inltrudions he receiv’d from his Father y but fo foon as he had his anfwer, he went to the King, and fpoke boldly to him, taxing him with the fervices which his Father had done him, and that without his afTiftance he had never come to the Crown. The young Lord,naturally of a fiery difpofitton, kept on this difeourfe, fo difpleafing to the King, till at length his Majelty flung away y and the Lords that were prefent, fell upon the young man, and bafely mifus’d him. At the fame time alfo he was arrelled and committed to prifon, together with his Mother and Sillers. Which a&amp;ion, as it made a great noife at Court, coming to MirgimoLBs ears, fo in- cens d him, that having an Army under his command, and being belov’d by the Soldiers, he refolv’d to make ufe of the advantages he had, to revenge him- ielffor the injury done him. He was then not far from Bengala^ being fent, as I faidbefore, to reduce certain Rajas to obedience, whofe Territories lye upon the Ganges ; and Sultan-Sujahy Cha-jehan's fecond Son, being then Gover- nour of Bengal a y the General thought it his bell way to addrefs himfelf to hun ; as being the next Prince, with whom he might join his Forces againlt * K 2 ' theTravels in India. ParTil the King of Golcovda, whom he look’d upon now no more as his fth? r~ as one of his molt inveterate Enemies. Thereupon' he wrote to the ^ this effect: That if he would join with him, he would give him an 0 Uncet&lt;&gt; nity to poflefs himfelf of the whole Kingdom of Golvendu and that li^i]? rtU ' not negledt fo fair an opportunity to enlarge the Dominions of the Great a W £«/, the fuccelfion whereof might as well concern him, as any of the r i&gt; r his Brothers. But the anfwer which fent hint, was cont Clt ° his exportation 5 who told him, that he. could not tell how’to trait a r t0 who as he went about to betray his King, might more eaiily be drawn tray a E^eign Prince, whom he had inveigl’d only for the fake ofliU r venge £and that therefore he Ihould not rely upon him. Upon si i-&gt;' refufal, MirpmoU wrote to Juren^b , who was then in his Government &lt;• Bramponre, who. being not fo nice as his Brother, accepted of the propofl the was made him. Thus while Mirgimola advanc’d with his Troops toward nabar,Aurengztb haften’s toward Decern, and both Annies being join’d T'' came to the Gates of Bagmbar before the King was in a poilure to receive them. He had only time to retreat into his Fortrefs of to which Au.rengz.eb ,after he had rifl’d the City of Bagnabar, and plunder’d the Palace lay’d a clofe Siege. The King feeing hinsfelf thus vigoroufly prefs’d, fent awav to Mtrgtmola his Wife and Children very honourably. For there is venue and generality in the Indians, as well as in the Europeans y of which I will give you' an illuftrious Example in the perfon of the King of Some days after the Enemy had befieg d the Foitrefs, a Caroncer efpying Aarengz.eb upon his Elephant, riding about to view the Fortifications of the Caftle, told the Kin-’ being then upon the Baftion, that if he pleas’d he would fetch off JxnzJH with a Canon-lhot; and at the fame time was about to give fire: but the Kins holding his hand, told him he perceiv’d it well enough, but that it behov’d Kings to be better Husbands of the Lives of Princes. The Canoneer obey’d the King, and inftead oflhooting at Anrengz.eb, he took off the Head of the General of his Army, who was a little before him y which put a flop to the Allault they were about to have giv’n, the Army being in a confulion upon Ins death. Adbchii-jaber-B General of the King of Golconda s Army lying not far from the Carop 5 with a flying Army of four thouland Horfe, underilandins the diforder of the Enemy by reafon of the lofs of their General, laid hdd of fo favourable an opportunity, gave them a defperate charge in that confulion, and putting them to the rout, perfifld them till night, for four or five Leagues. Some few days before the General’s death, the King of Golconda finding that his provifions fail’d him in the Fortrefs, was about to have deliver’d the Keys* but as I faid before, ASrz,a^JlTahomed y his Son-in-Law, fnatch’d them out of his hand, and threatned to kill him, if he perfever’d in that refblution. Which was the realon, that the King who lov’d him not before, had ever after the greateft affedion imaginable for him as,long as he liv’d. ^wengz-eb being thus conftrain’d to raife his Siege, Itay’d fome days to rally his Troops; and having receiv’d a recruit of freih men, return’d again to the Siege, with new refolutions. But Mrrglmola^ who had ft ill fome kindnefsfor the King remaining in his brealt, would not permit y 4 arengz.eb to ufe the ut- moit extremity, but by his wit and good management gain’d a fufpeniion of Arms. 1 Cha-jehan y the Father of Anretjgz.eb y had formerly had great kinclncffes fhew n him by the King of Golconda y to whom he fled after he had loif the Battel, togethei with his eldefl Brother, which he fought again# his Father, with whom he made War. The eldefl: Son was taken, and JehM- gmr caus d his eyes to be put out y but Cba-jehan being more wary, fled? n I1 ! :er ^. n ^ ky the King of Golconda y with whom he enter’d into a particular and fend friendfliip y Cha-jehan making an Oath to his Benefador,that he would never wage War again# him upon any occaflon whatever. ATirgimola there fore knowing that it would be no difficult thing to bring two Kings, that were friends, to an accommodation, wrought underhand with both, toward the con- c ulion of a Peace. And he fo brought his bufinefs about, that the King oiGoG eon a writ a Letter fir# to Cha-jehan y wherein he iubmiflively requeited hi®Book I. Travels in India. to be an Arbitrator between Aureng^eb and him, promiiing to fubmit wholly to him, and to lign fuch Articles as he fhould propofe. By the lame policy of gimola, Cba-jehan was advis’d, in anfwer to the King of Gokondah Letter to pro pole a Match between hisfecond Daughter and Sultan ATahozncd, the Son of Am~ rengub, upon condition that after the death of the King her Father, the Son-in- Law Ihould inherit the Kingdom of Golcovda. T. his p-ropofition being accepted the Peace was concluded, and the Nuptials celebrated with an extraordinary Magnificence. As for Mirgimla, he quitted the fervice of the King of Golem da and went with Aurenjrzieb to Bran?pour . Soon after Cha-jehan made him his Prime Miniller of State, and Generaliffimo of his Armies } and he it was that fo potently affilted Aureng^eb to get the Crown, by the defeat of Sultan-Sujab. For MlrgimoU was a perfon of great wit,and nolefs underltanding in Military than in State affairs. I had occahon to fpeak with him feveral times } and I have no lefs admir’d his julfice, than his difpatch to all people that had to do with him ; while he gave out feveral Orders, and lign’d feveral Difpatches at the fame time' as if he had but one entire bulinefs in hand. ^ • ’ The other Princefsof Golconda was promis’d to Sultan Sejed, another Cheh^of Mecca • and the Match went on fo fairly, that the day was appointed for the^ce- lebration of the Nuptials; but Abdoul-Jaber-Beg 0 General of the Army, with fix other Lords, went to the King to divert him from his intention^ and they brought it fo topafs, that the Match was broken off, and the Princefs was given in Mar riage to JMirzLa-Abdoul-Cofing, , the Kings Coufin; by whom fhe has two Sons,which have wholly annuli d the Pretenfions of Aurengz^cPs Son ^ whofe Father now keeps him in Prifon, in the^ Fort of Gavaleor y for having taken his Uncje Sultan Sajah's part againlt him. The Princefs had been given before to Mirw-Abdoul- Cofing, but for his debauchery, which render’d him little regarded by the King. But fmcehis marriage .he is very much reclaim’d. . Now the King of Golconda does not hand in fo much fear of the Moguls ; for in imitation of them, he keeps his Money in his own Country, and has already hoarded up a Treafury fufficient to maintain his Wars. Befides, he is altogether addicted to the Sedt of Haly, fo that he will not wear a Bonnet, like the other Mahumetans, becaufe they fay Haly wore none ^ but another fort of attire for the head. Which is thereafon that the Per fans, that come into India to feek their fortune, apply themfelves rather to the King of Golconda then to the Great Mogul. Such is the condition of the King of J^ifapour aifo, whom the Queen, Si- Iter to the King of Golconda, takes care to educate in the Sed of Haly, which in- vices great numbers of Perfiam into her Service.

When fheis not there however, any body may fee it, and take a walk in the Garden, which is very lovely place, and well-ftor’d with water. The whole Pia^a is encompaft with feveral Chambers for the lodging of poor Travellers ; who every day to ward the evening have an Alms beftowM upon them, of Rice, or Pulfe which they boil ready to their hands.

The Road is every jot as bad between Golconda and Cape-Comorin ■, a Waggon being hardly fo much as made mention of all the wayfor that there is no other way to travel, or for the carriage of Goods, than with Horfes and Oxen.

They leidom venture out above 20 or 25 leagues at Sea, which is no great hazard of the Vefiel. But fometimes the Ponuguefes fnap them, and then they either hang cm up prefently, or throw 7 em over-board. Thefe Afalavares caxvy fometimes 200, fometimes 250 men, and they fail together in Squadrons often or fifteen Barques to attack a great VefTel, not caring a rulh for the great Guns.

Some are of opinion that Elephants do great matters in War} which may be fometimes true, but not ah ways} for very often inftead of doing mifehief to the Enemy, they turn upon thofe that lead them, and rout their own party as Aureng-Zeb found by experi ence, at the Siege of this City. He was twenty days before Daman and re- folv’d at length to Storm it upon a Sunday, believing that the Chriilians were like the jews and would not defend it upon that day. He that commanded the Place was an old Souldier, who had ferv’d in France, and had three Sons with v him. In the Town were eight hundred Gentlemen, and other flout Souldiers who came from all parts to fignalize their valour at that Siege. For though the Mogul had in his Army above forty thoufand men, he could not hinder relief from being put into Daman by Sea, in regard that he wanted Ships. The Sun day that the Prince intended to Storm, the Governour of Daman, as had been or der’d at the Councel of War, caus’d Mafs to be faid prefently after IMidnight, and then made a Sally with all his Cavalry and fome part of his Infantry, who* were to fall on upon that quarter which was guarded by two hundred Elephants. Among thofe Elephants they flung a great number of Fire-works which fo af frighted them in the dark of the Night, that knowing not whither they went nor being to be rul’d by their Governours, they turn’d upon the Beflegers withfo much fury, that in lefs than two or three hours half the Army oS Aureng-Zeb was cut in pieces, and in three days the Siege was rais’d; nor would the Prince after that, have any more to do with the Chriflians. I made two Voyages to Goa, the one at the beginning of the year 1641. the fecond at the beginning of the year 1(548. The firfl time I flay’d but five days, and return’d by Land to Surat. From Goa I went to Bicholly, which is upon the main Land, thence to Vi favour, thence to Golconda, thence to Aureng-abat, and fo to Surat. I could have gone to Surat without palling through Gokonda y but my bufinefs led me that way. From Goa to Vi favour, cofles. 85 Which takes up generally eight days journey. Vifapur to Golconda, coftts* ’ 100 Which I travel’d in nine days. , From Golcondato Aureng-abat, the Stages are not fb well order’d, b$ng fome times fixteen, fometimes twenty five, fometimes twenty Leagues afunder. From Aureng-abat to Surat takes up fometimes twelve, fometimes fifteen, fometimes fixteen days journey. Vifapour is a great fcambling City, wherein there is nothing remarkable, nei ther as to the publick Edifices, nor as to Trade. The Kings Palace is a vail one but ill built} and the accefs to it is very dangerous, in regard there are abun dance of Crocodiles that lie in the Water which encompafs it. The King of Vi fapour has three good ports in his Dominions, Rejapour, Daboult, and Cra-paten. The lafl is the bell of all, where the Sea beats upon the foot of the Mountain, and you have fourteen or fifteen Fathom Water near the Land. Upon thetopof the Mountain there is a Fort, with a Spring of Water in it. Crapaten is not above five days journey from 6*0^ to the North. And Rabaque, where the King of Vfa pour fels his Pepper, is as far diflant from it to the Eaft. The King ofVifif 00 and the King of Golconda have been formerly tributary to the Great Mogul: but now they are abfolute of them Rives. ^Book Travels in I &amp; d i a.

MingreU is a large Town, extended half a League in length upon the Sea, 111 the Territories of Fifkfow. It is one of the belt Roads in all Info, where Hollanders t&amp;z in frefh Provilions every time they fail to block up Goa asalfo when they are bound upon Trade for many other parts of India.

There is alfo made great Itore of courfe Calecuts, that are fpent in the Country; befides great quantities of courle Matting, that ferves to pack up goods.

J wuu ^ Before the Hollanders had brought down the power of the Pormals in India. there was nothing to be feen at Goa,but Magnificence and Riches: but the Dmb having every where got their Trade out of their hands, they have loft their fpnngsofGold and Silver,and are fallen from their former fplendor.In rnyfirlt Voyage to Goa I met with people of falhion,that had above two-thoufand Crowns Revenue; at my fecond Voyage the fame perfons came privately to me in the evening,to beg an Alms j yet abating nothing,for all that oftheir inherent pride and haughtinefs .• Nay, their Women will come in Palleki.s to the door,and ftay while a Boy,that attends them,has brought you a Complement from hisMillrefs. 1 hen ufually you fend them what you pleafe,or carry it your felf, if you have a cunofity to fee their faces; which rarely can be done, becaufe they coverthem- felves with a veil from head to foot. Moreover, if you go your felf to prefent t ern your anty,they will give you a little note,containing a recommendation of fome religious Perfon who figmfies what fubftantial perfons they have been, and how they came to fall to decay. Sometimes, if the perfon be handfom, ihe e ^ r ti° r alk ^ a Collatipii,which lafis moil commonly till the next day.Had not the Portals fo many Fortrelfcs to keep upon the Land; or had, ey not,ont oftheir contempt of the Hollander negledted their affairs,they could never have been reduc d to fo low a condition. TJie Portugucfes have no fooner made the Cap of Good-Hope, but they are all 1 agues or Gentlemen; and add the Title of Dom to the iingle name oiPedroov /erowwo, which they receiv d at their Baptifm .* From whence they are call’d xt C / a S U€s or Gentlemen of the Cape of Good-Hope, As they change their ames, they alfo change their Nature; for it may be truly faid,that the Indian- Ponugals are the moft revengeful perfons and the moll jealous of their Wives of any perfons m the World. And when the leallfulpition creeps into their noddles, they rid themfelves of them either by Poifon or Dagger.

At Daman three or four of thefe black Slaves perceiving fome perfons whom they were td nmrther, atMafs in the Church, difcharg’d their Mufquets at them through the windows, never confidedng what other mifchief they migi t do to any. other perfons*againlt whom they had no quarrel or delign. The fame thing happen’d at Goa-) where feven men were kill’d clofe by the Alter, and the Prielt that faid Mafs was dangerouily wounded at the fame time. Nor do their Courts of Juilice take any cognizance of thefe crimes, for generally the guilty perfons are the clliefeft of the Countrey. As for their Suits of Law, there is no end of them, for they are manag’d by the Canarins^ who are Natives of the Countrey, whofe bufm'efs it is to follow the Law } the molt fubtil and crafty fort of people in the World. To return to the ancient Power of the Portugals in India, moll certain it is, that if the A/c//Werj had never come among them, you Ihould not have feen a bit of Iron in any Portugal Merchant’s Houfe } but all Gold or Silver; for they needed no more than to make three or four Voyages to Japan, the Philip fin, or Molucca Wands, or to China to enrich themfelves \ gaining at their return above five or fix for one one upon rich Merchandizes. The very Souldiers as well as the Captains and Governors enrich’d themfelves by Trade. There was not any per fon, unlefs it be the Governor, who wcs not a f rader} or if he does Trade, it is in another man’s name, for he has Revenue enough without it. Formerly it was one of the fineft employments of the World to be Vice-Roy of Goa : and there are but few Monarchs, that have Governments at their difpofal, which are equal in value to fome of thofe which depend upon this Vice-Roy. The chief Command is that of Mozambique for three years. In thofe three years the Governor gets above four or five hunder’d-thoufand Crowns, and fometimes more, if in all that time they receive no lofles from the Cafres. Thefe Cafres are people that bring Gold for the Commodities which they carry away } and if any one of them happen to dye, going or coming,whatever you trulled them withall is loft with out redemption. The Governour of Mozambique trades alfo with the Negro’s that inhabit all along the Coaft of Melinda , and they ordinarily pay for the goods they buy, either in Elephants Teeth, or Arnbergreefe. When I was laft in Goa, the Governour of Mozambique, who return’d to Goa after he had been three years in his Command, had by him only in Ambergreefe, two hundred thoufand Crowns, not reckoning his Gold, and his Elephants Teeth, which a- mounted to a far larger film. The fecond Government was that of Malaca, by reafon of the Cnftom which was there to be paid. For it is a Streight through which all Velfels that are bound from Goa, for Jaqon, China, Cochin china, Java, Macajjar, the Phillippin Iflands, and many other places, muft of necelfity pafs. They may fail another way by the Wand of Sumatra, toward the Weft, and fo through the Streight Sonde, or elfe leave the Wand of Java to the North; but when the Ships return to Goa, they muft fhew a difeharge from the Cuftom-Houfe of Malaca y which obliges them t6 go that way. d he third Government is that of Or mas, by reafon of the great Trade which is there, and the Cuftom which all Ships are to pay that are bound in and out of the Pcrfian Golf. The Governour of Or mm exacted great Tolls from thofe that went to the Wand of Bakren to fifh for Pearls,'for if they, did not take a Licence from hitn, he would fink their Veflels. The Per fans at prefent exatt this Cuftom from the Englifi, who have a fmall Ware in that Trade, as I have related in my Per pan Voyages. But though they are fevere enough to the Merchants, their Cuftoms amount to nothing neer fo much as what the Portu^ guefes made of it. The Hollanders are in the fame condition at Malaca, not re ceiving hardly fuflicient to pay their Garrifon which they keep there. The fourth Government is that of Mofcate, the revenue whereof was very great. For all Veffels that are bound from India, from the Per pan Golf, from the Red $ea, and from the Coaft of Melinda, muft &lt;x&gt;me under the Point of * L 2 , Mnf-Travels in India. .Part II; j where they generally take in freOi Water.

Ualea fe The fifth Government was that of the hand of CeyUnd, to which bel m all thofe places whcih the Tortugah had, as v/ell upon the Coafi: of '' the Golf of Bengal^ and other parts of India • the worft of which em meats was worth ten thoufand Crowns ann. Befides thefe five great Governments, which were at the difpolal of the V Roy, he had abundance of other Offices in his Gift, as well in Goa as in 0 rt parts of India, The very day that he makes his Entry into Goa ’the Cam ^ of his Guards gets above^four thoufand Crowns. The three Offices of F ' neerMajor, Vifitor of the Forts, and chief Matter of the Ordinance viekPa every year twenty thoufand iWo’s; every Bar do being worth twentv-feven Sous of our Money. The Port aguefes were then all very rich ; the Nobilitv by reafon of their Governments and Commands, die Merchants by their Trade till the Englijh and Hollanders cut them fhort. When they had Or ms thev Would not let any Merchant pafs by Sea into India; fo that they were forc’d td go by Land through Candahar. Then, when the Tarky^ Perfan, Jrabm Mufcovits, Bolonian^ and other Merchants arriv’d at Bander-Abafly, they join’d together, and deputed four of the mctft experienc’d perfons among them,toview all the forts of Commodities, and to underftand their quality and price. 5 After they have made their report, they agree upon their price, and fetch away thier goods,which are dittributed to every one proportionably according to the number of Merchants. Itisalfothe cuftom ofall^*, that there is nothing fold,but a Bro ker has a hand in the Bargain. They make good the Money to thofe that have fold, and receive it from them that buy j and there are fome forts of Commodities upon which there is due to them for Brokage, fbmetimesonein the Hundred, fometime one and a half, and two. At that time the Bortagnefes made great profit, without any lofs. For the Jice-Roy took care to prefeve them againft the Pyrats. Who afloon as the Rains are over, and that it was feafonably to put to Sea, always fent a fuffi- cient convoy to guard the Merchants twenty-five or thirty Leagues to Sea the not daring to ftir above fifteen or twenty. The Captains of tbe Galiots, and the Soldiers drive a fmall Trade alfo in their Voyages, and in re gard they pay no cuttom, they gain enough to maintain themfelves handfome- ly all the time they lye in Garrifon,which is during the Rains. There was alfo care taken for the advancement of the Soldiery j for every Soldier that came from after nine years fervice, had fome Command either by Sea or Land bettow’d upon him} and if he would not accept of it, they gave him leave to Trade as a Merchant. So that if there happen’d to be any perfon of underttanding among them, he could not fail, to raife his fortune, having all the credit lie could defire. For there were people enough that being glad to let out their Money, would venture with him at Cent, per Cent, upon his re» turn. Ifthe Vefiel be lott, they that lend their Money, lofe either their Money or their goods} but if the Ship come fafe home, of one they make three or four. The Natives of the Country, call’d Canarins, are not permitted to bear any Offices among the Bortuguefes, but only in reference to the Law, that is to fay, either as Advocates, or Sollicitors, or Scriveners } for they keep them very much under. If one of thefe Canarins or Blacks, happen to ttrikea White c&gt;r European^ there is no pardon for him, but he mutt have his hand cut off. As well the Spaniards as Portagaefcs, make ufe of them as Receivers, and to.foL low their bufines. And in the Alahilids, or Philippin Ifiands, there are fome ofthefe Blacksforich, that many of them have offer’d twenty thoufand Croi- fats to the Vice-Roy, for liberty to wear Hofe and Shoe’s, which they are not per mitted to wear. Some of thefe Blacks have thirty Slaves attending upon them, very richly habited 5 but only they go barefoot. And had the Bomgals permitted them to fet out Ships of their own, and to have chofen Captains and other Officers at their own pleafure, the PortagHefes would not have m^dduch ~ ^ large,Book I. Travels in India. iarge, at leaft not fo eafie Gonqaells in the Indies. Thefe Blacks are very cotiragious and good Soldiers, and feveral of the Religious Orders have allur’d me, that they will learn more in fix months in one of their Goiledges, than the Portugal Children in a year, whatever Science you put them to $ which is the reafon that the Portugals keep them fo low. The natural Inhabitants of the Country about Goa, are Idolaters, and wor/hip feveral forts of Idols, which they fay are the Refemblance of feveral that have done good works, to whom they ought to give praifc by adorning their Portraitures. There are many of thefe Idolaters who worhiip Apes. And therefore in thelfland ot Salfete there was a Paged, where the Idolaters kept in a Cheft, like a Tomb, the Bones and Nails of an Ape,which they laid had been mighty ferviceable to their Anchellors by bringing news and intelligence to them,when any hoftile Princes profecuted* them; for which purpofe they would fometimes fwim through the very Sea it felf. The Indians come from feveral parts in procelfion, and make offerings to this Pagod. But the Clergy of Goa, efpecially the Inquilitors, caus’d the Tomb one day to be taken away, and brought it to Goa, where it remainM a good while, by reafon of the difference which it made between the Eccleliaflicks and the people. For the Idolaters offering a great fum of Money to have their Reliques again, the people were willing to have reftor’d them ; faying, that the Money would do well upon any occafion of War, or elfe to relieve the poor. But the Clergy were of a contrary opinion, and maintain’d that fuch a piece of idolatry was not to be endur'd upon any account whatfoever. At length the Arch-Bilhop and the Inguifitors, by their own Authority, took away the Tomb and fending it in a Veffel twenty Leagues out to Sea, caus’d it to be thrown to the bottom of the Ocean. They thought to have burn’d it, but the Idola- ters would have rak d up the Afhes again,which would have been but a new food to their Superftition. There are in Goa abundance of Clergy-men} for befides the Arch-Bifhop and his Clergy, there are Dominicans, AujHn-Triars, Francifcans, Barefoot Carme- lues, Jefms, and Capuchins,* with two Religious Houfes, whereof the jlaftin- Pryars are Directors or Governoars.

I have forgot one thing in reference to their more frequent blood-lettings than among us Europeans. Which is, that to bring their colour again, and to reftore them to perfect health, they order the Patient to drink for twelve days together three glalfes of Cow’s Urine} one in the morning,another at noon,and another at night. But in regard it is a very naufeous fort of drink, the Patient fwallowsas little as he can, how defirous foe vef he may be of his health. They learnt this remedy from the Idolaters of the Country} and whether the Patient will take it or no, they never let him ftir out of the Hofpital, till the twelve days are ex pir’d wherein he ought to drink it.

This Piftol the Trew/7-Conful at Alepto gave me, the fellow of it being unhappily loft .* for elfe the Pair had been prefented by the EVew^-Nation to the Bafha, who might then have boafted himfelf the Mafter of the fairefl and bell-made pair of Piftols in all Afia. The Vice-Roy admits no perfon whatever,no not his Children to fit at his Table. But there is a little partition in the Dining-room,where there is a Cloath laid for the Principal Officers, as is ufual in the Courts of the G'em^-Princes. The next day I went to wait upon the Arch-Bifhop, and the next day after I ee- fign’d to have vifited the Inquifitor ^ but I underftood by one of his Gentlemen that he was bufy, writing into Portugal, there being two Ships ready to weigh Anchor, that only flaid for his difpatches. After the Ships were fet fail, he lent the fame Gentleman to tell me that he expe&amp;ed me at the Inquifition-Houfe, about two or three in the afternoon. 1 fail’d not to go thither at the time pre fix’d. when I came, a Page brought me into a large Hall,where after I had walk a a quarter of an hour,an Officer came and carri’d me into the Cha uber where tue Inquifitor was. After I had pall through two Galleries, and fome Chambers,! en ter’d into a little Chamber where the Inquifitor fat at the end ot a great 1 able like a Billiard-Table-whichjas well as the Chairs and Stools in the Chamber, was ' cover aBook I. 'Travels in India. coher’d with green Cloath, fuch as is earn’d out of England. He told me I was welcome, and after a Complement or two, he ask’d me what Religion I was off I anfwer’d him, of the Proteftant Religion. He ask’d me then, if my Father and Mother were of the fame Religion ^ and after I had fatisfi’d him that they were fojHe told me again I was welcome,calling out at the fame time for fome other per- fons to enter. 1 hereupon,the Hangings being held up,there came in ten or twelve perfons out of another roorn hard-by. The firft of the Train were two siuftin- Friars, follow’d by two Dominicans, two barefoot-Carmelites, and fome other of the Clergy j whom the Inquifitor told who I was, and ahur’d them I had brought no prohibited Books} for indeed, knowing their orders, I had lift my Bible at Minor da. We difeours’d about two hours of feveral things, but particularly of my Travels *, the whole Company teftifying their deiire to hear me make fome repetitions. Three days after the Inquiftor fent for me to dine with him at a fair Houfe, about half a league from the City, which belongs to the Bare-foot Carmelites. It is one of the lovelieft Stru&amp;ures in all the Indies j and I will tell you in fliort how the Carmelites came by it. There was a Gentleman in G^whofe Father and Grandfather had got great Eftates by Merchandizing; and he it was that had built this Houfe,which might well have pall fora moll noble Palace.He had no mind to Marry, but being altogether addicted to his devotions, he very much frequented the Friars, to whom he Ihew’d himfelf fo affedionate, that he made his Will, wherein he gave them all his Eftate,provided they would bury him on the right-lide of the High-Altar where he intended a fumptuous Monument. Now according to the common report, this Gentleman was a Leaper, which fome jealous perfons endeavour’d to make the World believe,feeing he had given away all his Eltatc to the jduftin-Vtidxs. Thereupon they told him that the ground on the right-hand of the High-Alter was a place only fit for a Ficc* Roy \ and that a leaprous perlbn was not to be laid there : which was the opinion of the generality of the people, and of a good part of the Auftin-Vxms them- felves. Thereupon fome of the Fathers of the Covent coming to fpeak with the Gentleman, oh purpofe to perfwade him to choofe fome other place in the Church, hewasfo offended at the propofal, that he never went more to the ^f?i&gt;*-Friars, but always went to perform his devotions among the Carmelites, who receiv’d him with open arms, and accepted the conditions which the other had refus’d. Nor did he live long after he had interefled himfelf with that Order; fo that the Carmelites having magnificently burfd him, enjoy’d all his Eftate, with this fame Houfe, where we were fplendidly entertain’d with Mulick all the time of Din ner. I ftaid at Goa from the twenty-hrft of January till the eleventh of March, de parting thence that very day in the evening, after I had taken leave of the Eicc- Roy. i begg’d leave alfo of the Eice-Roy for a Frcw/7-Gentlemen, whofe name was Be Hoy, to go along with me .• which was granted me ; but through the impru dence of that Gentleman,who did not tell me the reafon of his coming to Co*,he had like to have been taken from me again,and it was an even-lay,that we had not been both earn’d to the Inquilition. This Gentleman had left the place of his Nativity to travel over Holland^ where having run hirafelf in debt, and finding no perfon that would lend him any Money,he refolv’d to go for India. Thereupon he lifted himfelf as a private Soulditr upon the accompt of the Holland-Com- pany ^ and came to Batavia at the fame time that the Hollanders made War again!!: tne Portnauez.es in Ceylan. Being arriv’d,they fent him away among the recruits which were fent into that Iflandj and the Hclland-Gwetdl feeing fuch a re- intorcement of flout men commanded by a -Captain, whofe name was t. Am ant, a perfon of great courage and experience} he refolv’d to befiege Ne~ a confiderable Fort in the Ifland of They made two aflaults ^ , erein t l le Fremh-mzxi behav’d themfelves valiantly, efpecially St. Almam, and to b C€ W ^° were woun ^ e ^* The General of the feeing them e two fu C h me n °f courage, made a promife that if Negomhe were taken, kenrh' em tW0 - ^ lou ^ he Governor. The place was taken, and the General p ins word with St. Amant : but the News being carri’d to Batavia, a young to H r man °^ki n to the General, and but newly arriv’d out of Holland, obtain’d -e vovernour of Negomhe, to the prejudice of St« Amant, and came with an i orderTravels in India. i * * Part II, order from the Council at Batavia to difpl»ice him. St. &lt;Amam incens’d at fuch ill-ufage, inveigles to his Party a matter of fifteen or twenty, moft part Souldiers, among whom were Mmfitur Bdloy, Marefts 0 and John de Roft, and re volts to the Tortugntfes. The ?onngah encourag’d by the reinforcement offach, a flout, though fmall number of men, florm’d again, and took it at the fecond aflault. At that time was Don Philip de Mafcaregnas Governor of Csyl m and all the places belonging to it, under the jurifdidion of the Porngd:/ liv’d alfo at the City of Colombo ^ and then it was, that having receiv’d Letters from Goa that the Vice-Roy was dead, and that the Council and all the Nobility defir’d him to come and fucceed in his place, he refolv’d to fee St. Amum and his Companions before his departure, to the end he might bellow upon themfome proper reward. So foon as he faw them, he was refolv’d to take then? along with him to Goa. Whether it were that he thought he might have better opportu nities to advance them there ^ or that he thought it convenient to have flout men about him, by reafpn of the Malavar.es who lay in wait for him with forty VT- fels, whereas he had but twenty-two. But they were no iboner con)e to make Cape-Comorinyvhzn the winds rofe, and fuch a Tempefl follow’d, that the Veflels were difpers'd, and many of them unfortunately caft away. They that were in Don Philips VelTel did all they could to get to the fhoar, but feeing they could not, and that the Ship was ready to fplit,St. ^/w^wrand his Six other Compani ons threw themfelves into theSea with cords and pieces of planks,and fo beftirr’d themfelves, that they made a fhift not only to fave themfelves, but Don Philip alfo. Hereupon Don Philip coming to Goa 0 after he had made his entrance, gave to St. the Command of Grand Mafter of the Artillery, and Superintendent General over all the Forts whifh the PortHguez.es had m India. He marri’d him alfo to a young Virgin, with whom he had twenty-thoufand Crowns, whofe Fa ther was an Englijh-man^ who, had quitted the Company, and marri’d a Natural Daughter of one of the Vice-Roy's oiGoa. As for John de Rofe, he defir’d leave of the Vice-Roy to return to Colombo ^ where, by his favour, he marri’d a young Widow, half Native, half Portnguezje, by whom he had a fair fortune. Mmjts the Vice-Roy made Captain of his Guards, the moil confiderable Command in ail his Court,being oblig’d to Marefts for his life,who was the perfon that bore him upon his Ihoulders to fave him from drowning. Du Belloy defir’d leave that he might go to Bdacao, which was granted him. For he underftood that the greatefl: part of the Portugal-Qcntry, retir’d to that place, after they had got Eftates by Merchandizing , that they were very courteous to Grangers, and withal extremely addidied to play, which was Du BtHoy's chief delight. He liv’d two years at Macao, very much to his content; for when he wanted Money, the Gentry lent it him freely. One day he had won above fix-thoufand Crowns, but going to play again, he was fo unfortunate as to lofe it all, befides a good fum of Money which his friends had lent him. Being thus at a lofs, and finding that no-body would lend him any more Money, he began to fwear againft a Pidture that hung in the room, which was the Portraiture of fome Papiftical Saint; faying in his p. flion that it was an ufual thing with them that plaid, that if they faw a Saint Pidlure hang' in their fight, it made them lofe *, and that ifthatPidhire had not been there he had certainly won. Immediately the Inquifitor was inform’d oi this, (for in every City in India under the Jurifdidtion of the Portuguezes there is one. However his power is limited; having no other authority than to feize theperfonof him that fays or adts any thing againft their Religion, to hear the Witneffes, and to fend the Offender with the examinations to Goa in the firltlhip which is bound thither.* where the inquifitor-Gdneral has an abfolutePower either to abfolve him, or to put him to death J Thereupon Du Fe/Fjy wasputa- board a fmall Vefiel of ten or twelve Guns loaded with Irons .* with aftridl charge to the Captain to keep him fafe, and fome threats that he fhould be anfwerable for him if he efcap’d. But fo foon as the Ship was out at Sea, the Captain, who was ofa noble difpofition, and knew Du Belloy to be of a good Family, took on his Irons, and made him fit at his own Table; giving him alfo Linnen, and other convenient Apparel neceflary for the Voyage, which was to continue forty days. They put into Gba the nineteenth of February 1649^and the Ship was no loonei come into Harbour, but $z,Mmant came a-board by the Governor’s order,as weiBook I. Travels in India. to receive his Letters, as to hear what news in China. But his furprize was very great, to fee Belloy in that condition, and that the Captain would not let him go, before he had furrenderM him up into the hands of the Inquilitor. Ne- verthelefs, in regard that St. Amam was a perfon of great credit, he obtain’d of the Captain, that Belloy Ihould go along with him into the City % As for Belloy he immediately and for the nonce Ihifted himfelf into his old Cloaths, which were all to tatters and full of Vermin \ and St. Ammt, who knew there was no dallying with the Inquifition, took that feafon to prefent him td the Inqui- litor; who feeing a Gentleman in fuch a fad condition,had fomecompaffion upon him, and allow’d him the whole City for his Prifon ; on condition he Ihould furrender his body,upon demand,when he underilood what was inform’d againfi him. In the interim St. Amant brings Da Belloy to my Lodging juft as I was going to vilit the Arch-Bifhop of Mira, whom I formerly knew, at Conflanti- nople, when he was Ptior of the Francifcans at Galata. I delir’d them to ftay a while and to dine with me, which they did j after which I proffer’d my Houfe and Table to Da Belloy, who liv’d with me } and for whom I alfo bought two new Suits of Apparel, and Linnen convenient. However, all the while that l flay’d at Goa, which was ten or twelve days, I could, not perfwade the Sieur Da Belloy to put on thofe new Cloaths, not knowing the reafon, though he promis'd me every Jay. But being upon my departure, I told him I was go ing to take leave of the Vice-Roy } whereupon he defirM me to procure leave for him alfo j which I did. Wp departed toward evening in the fame Veffel wherein I came, and about midnight the Sieur Belloy began to fhift himfelf, and when he had done he threw his old raggs into the Sea, fwearing againft the In- quifition like a mad man ^ I underftanding nothing all this while of the bulinefs. When I heard him fwear in that manner, I told him we were not yet out of the Bortagals hands } neither were he and I with five or fix Servants, able to defend our felves againft forty Sea-men that belong’d to the Ship. I ask’d him then, why he fwore fo heartily againft the Inquilition ; he reply’d,that he would tell me all the circumftances of the Story} which he did,when we came to Min- which was about eight a Clock in the morning. When we landed we ^ met certain Hollanders with the Commander, who were eating Oyfters and * drinking Sack upon the Shoar. Immediately they ask’d me who that perfon was with me. I told them it was a Gentleman who attending the French Ambaffa- dor into Fortagal^d taken Shipping there for together with four Or five more whom he had left at Goa-, but that neither the fcituation of the place, nor the humour of the Fortagals plealing him, he had delir’d my affiftairce in his return for Earope. Three or four days after, I bought him an Oxe to carry him to Sarat and I gave him a Servant to affift him, together with a Letter to Father Zenon, a Capachin, wherein I defir’d him to fpeak to my Broker to pay him ten Crowns a month for his fubfiftence, and to deiire of the English Prefident to embark him for Earope with the firft opportunity. But it fell out contrary to my Intentions} for Father Zenon earn’d him back again along with him to Goa, where he had fome bufinefs to do for Father Ephraim his Com- panion ; of whom I fhall fpeak in the next Chapter. Father Zenon without doubt believ’d, that Da Belloy making his appearance to the Inquilition, and defiring his pardon might have eafily obtain’d it. ’Tis vefy true he did obtain’ u, but it was after he had been two years in the Inquilition, from which he was not difeharg’d-but with a fulphur’d Shirt, with a St. Andrews Crofs upon his Stomack. There was with him another Gentleman, call’d Lewis de Bar upon the Seine, who was us’d in the fame manner} and they always put them to ac company thofe who were put to death. The Sieur Da Belloy did very ill to return to Goa, and worfe to appear afterwards again at Mingrela, where the Hollanders, who underftanding he had formerly revolted out of their fer- ^ce, by the intelligence they receiv’d from pheir Coipmander at Surat, feiz’d Ls perfon, and fent him aw r ay in a Ship that was going for Batavia. They pre tended that they fent him to the General of the Company, to do with him as mould think fitting. But lam in part alfur’d, that as Toon as the Vellel was out at Sea, they put the poor Gentleman into a Sack, and threw him into the 5ea - -f his was the end of the Sieur Da Belloy. * M c AsTravels in India, Part II, As for Sienr des Mar eft he was a Gentleman, born in the Danphmte n e - r to Loriol, who having kill’d his adverfary in a Duel, fled into Poland, whe?e he fo far hgnalhM himfelf, that he won the efteem and affedion of the General of the Polonian Army. At that time the Grand Seignior kept in the prifonof the Seven Towers at Con&amp;anmoyle, two Noble Polonians whereupon the P 0 Ionian General obferving the courage and addrefs of this Des Mar efts ^ w ' a daring Fellow, and a good Engineer befides, made a propofal to him, to goto Conftaminofle, and to endeavour, if he could by any means in the world, to fet thofe princes at liberty. Des Mar efts willingly accepted the employment and without doubt he had fucceeded in his deiign, had he not been difcovered’ by fome Turks, who accus’d him for having been too circumfped in viewing the feven Towers, feeing him with a Chalk Pencil in his hand, ready to take the draught thereof, which feem’d to tend to no good deiign. This had been enough to have ruin’d the Gentleman, had not Monfieur de Cefy, the French Ambafladour ftifl’d the further examination of the bufinefs by fome Prefent; which in Turky is the moft fovereign remedy upon all accidents of danger ^ telling the Fifter,that he was only a French Gentleman that travePd for his pleafure,and one that was going for Perfta with the firfl: opportunity. However it was not Mar efts deiign at that time to go very far,for he intended to have return’d into Polandftb foon as he had us’d his utmoft indeavours to fet the Princes at liberty • but for his own fafety it behov’d him to give it out that he was gone to Perfia-, and at length he was conltrain’d to go thither indeed. As for the Grand Seignior, he had refolv^d never to fet the two Noblemen at liberty. But at length they were fo fortunate as to gain the love of a young Tnrk, who was the Son of the Captain of the Seven Towers •, with whom the Father ufually trulted the Keys to open and Ihut the Gates of the Prifon. The night appointed for their flight, he made as if he had Ihut fome doors, the Padlocks whereof he left all open. But he durlt not do fo by the two firft Gates, near one of which the Captain with a ftrong Guard lay, for fear of being difcover’d. The young man, who had entirely devoted himfelf to ferve the Princes, having forefeen this diffi culty before, had bethought himfelf of Rope-Ladders to get over the two Walls; to which purpofe it was neceflary to have a correfpondence within and without. Finding therefore that becaufe the utmoft of feverity was not us’d' toward thofe Princes, they had the liberty, to receive feveral Dilhes of Meat from the French Ambafladours Kitchin,the Clerk of the Kitchin was made of the v plot, who thereupon fent them in feveral Cords in Palties, whereof they made Ladders. The bufinefs fucceeded fo well, that the efcape was made, and the young Turk fled with the Polonian Lords into Poland, where he turn’d Chrillian, and receiv’d ample rewards both in Employments and Money. The fame gra titude proportionably was obferved toward thofe who had contributed toward the liberty of the Princes, who amply acknowledg’d the feryices which they had receiv’d from every one of them. In the mean time the Sieur Des Marefts arrives at Ifiahan, and addreffing himfelf to the Cafnchin Fryars, they brought him to my Lodging, where he had the freedom of my Table, and a Chamber. He ftaid fome time at Ifa- han, during which he got acquainted with the Englift and Hollanders, who had a great efteem for him, finding him to be a perfpn of merit. But it happen d one day, that his curiofity putting him upon a bold attempt, had like to have been the ruine of him and all the Franks in Jfpahan. Never the Inn where we lodg’d there was a large Bath, where the men and women by turns take their times to come and bath themfelves; and where the Queen of Fifapoar, during her ftay at Jfpahan, as fhe return’d home to Mecca, delighted to go and prattle with the French mens wives. The Sieur Des Marefts having a paffionate de fine to fee what the women did, fatisfi’d his curiofity, by means of a cranny in the Arch of the Vault, which he had obferved when he went thither; for having found out a way without fide to get up to that Arch, through a blind hole thdi, was next to the Inn where he lay, the Arch being fiat, as I have defcnb’d theni in my “relations of Perfta, and the Seraglio, he laid himfelf upon his belly, an law throtgh the cranny what he fo much long’d to behold. He was at this iport fome ten or twelve times; and not being able to contain himfelf, he told meBook I. Travels in India. oneday what he had done. I bid him haye a care of going there any more for fear of raining himfelf and all the French men in that City. But he contrary to my advice went thither two or three times after that 5 till at length he was dif- cover’d by one of the women of the Bath that took care of the Linnen, and dry them without, upon Perches as high as the top of the Arch, to which they get up by a little Ladder. The v^pman feeing a man lying *11 along upon his belly, feiz’d upon his Hat, and began to cry out. But Mar eft to get him- feifout of the mire, and to hinder the woman from making more noife, put two Tomans, into her hand. When he return’d to the Inn,I perceiv’d him to’look as if he had been fear’d, and conjeduring that feme ill accident had befall’n him, I prefs’d him to confefs what was the matter. He was loath at firft, but at length he confefs’d how he had been difeover’d by a woman, and how he had Hop’d her mouth with money. Thereupon I told him, that there was a necehity for him to fly,for that the danger was far greater than he imagin’d. The Batch Prefident alfo, to whom I thought it convenient to tell what had pafs’d, was of the fame opinion} upon which we gave him a Mule, and as much money as was neceflary for him, ordering him to go to Bander, and thence by Sea to Surat. I gave him a Letter of Recommendation to the Englift Prelident, who was my Friend ^ whom I alfo defir’d to let him have two hundred Crowns, if he had oc- cafion for them. I wrote very much in his commendation ^ and mention’d the proffer which the Butch Prelident at Iff ah an had made him, to fend him with Letters to the General, who would not fail to employ him according to bis merit. For indeed at that time that the Hollanders had War with the Portuguefes in Ceylan, any perfon of wit, and courage, like the Sieur Bes Marefts, was very acceptable to them. Which made them very earnefl with him, to take an em ployment anong them ; and to that end, they carefs’d him, and prefented him very nobly during his ftay at Ifpahan. But he told them,that not being of their Religion, he was unwilling to ferve them again# the Portuguefes ^ which was the only reafon that hinder’d him from accepting the offers which I had made him. Theft particulars I wrote in his behalf to the Engltfh Prefident at Surat \ fo that the Sieur Bes Marefts being defirous to go to Goa to ferve the Portu- gals, the Prefident wrote in his behalf to the Vice-Roy, by whom he was very much belov’d, relating to him, befides, what the Hollanders had proffer’d him, that his recommendation might be the more acceptable. Thereupon the Vice- Roy made him very welcome } and upon the Sieur Marefts defire to be em ploy’d in Ceylan in the Portugal Army, he fent him away with the fir# oppor tunity, with Letters of Recommendation to Don Philif de Mafcaregnas, who was then Governour of Ceylan, and all thofe places that belong’d to it under the jurifdidtion of the Portuguefes . It happen’d three days after, that they loft Nagmbe, and when they retook it, the Sieur Marefts was one of thofe that receiv’d molt wounds, and won moft honour in the A [faults. He it was that afterwards was moft inftrumental in faving Don Philif from being drown’d ^ fo that when Don Philif came to be Vice-Roy of GoA i he could not think he de- ferv’d a lefs reward than the Command of his Guards *, in which employment he dy’d within three or four Months. He was very much lamented by the Vice- Roy,by whom he was entirely bdov’d. But he left his Eftate to a Prieft, with whom he had contraded a particular friendfhip; upon condition that he fhould °nly pay me two hundred and fifty Crowns that I had lent him; which how ever 1 had much ado to get out of the Prieffs Clutches. While I flay’d at Goa,\ was told a pretty flory concerning a Caravel, or orr^/ Veflfel, which arriv’d there but a little before, and came from Lisbon. When flie was about to make the Cafe of good Hofe, there happen’d fuch a violent fempeft, as lafled five or fix hours, and put the Marriners to fuch a nomas^ that they knew not were they were. At length they fell into a Bay, F ^ aw ^ vera * Inhabitantsand as foon as they came to an Anchor,they oeneld the fhore cov er’d with men, women, and children, that teflify’d aflrange rna?ement to fee white people, and fuch kind of people as the Caravel.

The Mariner told me, that there were fome of their women that wore of thofe pieces of Gold under their Chins, and in their Nohrils. Eight or nine days after the Portugal* arriv’d in that Bay, tl ofe Cafres brought them little pieces of Am- bergreefe, fome Gold, but Very little; fome Elepfiants teeth, but very fmall; fome Oft riches, and other Birds, fome Venifbn ; but for Fiflt there was aban donee. The Portugal* endeavour’d-all they could by ligns to know where they found the Ambergreefe, for it was very good. The Vice-Roy Ihew’d me a a piece that weigh’d not above half an Ounce, but he allur’d me withall that he had never feen fo good. They alfo labour’d to difeover where they had the Gold. After the Elephants teeth they made no great enquiry feeing a great number of Elephants that came to drink at a River that threw it felt into the Bay. At length after they had Ray’d three weeks,the Portugal* finding it impoffibk for them to difeover any thing more, becaufe they wnderftood not one ano ther, refolv’d to fet fail with the firft: wind. And becaufe they had always fome of thefe Cafres aboard in regard they were very liberal of their Tobacco, Bisket, and ftrong Water, they thought good to bring two of them along in the Velfel ; in hopes that they might learn the Portuguefe Language, or that there might fome Child be found out that might underftand what they fakL The Mariners told me,that when they fet fail,after the Cafresfow that they they had carri’d two of their people away, who perhaps were no inconliderabk perfons, they tore their Hair, ftruck their Breafts; as if they had been frantkk, and fet up a moft horrible yelling and howling.

So that they could gc t out of them nothing of that further difeovery at wlikh they aim’d, of a Country from whence they only brought away two pound of Gold, three pound of Ambergreefe, and thirty-five or forty Elephants teeth.

Vov Ma dr efat an is but half a league from St. Thomas, a Sea-Town upon the Coafi: of indifferently well-built,as for merly belonging to the Pormgals. In that place there was a very great Trade, efpecially for Calicuts,and a very great number of Merchants and Workmen liv’d there,the greateft part whereof defir d to inhabit at Madref atan with the Tag- lijk,but that there was no place for them to exercife their Religion in that place. But when the Englijh had built a Church,and perfwaded Father Ephraim to ftay y many of the Port aguefes quitted St. Thomas^ by reafon of the frequent Preaching of Father Ephraim, and his great care as well of the Natives, as of the Porta- ^als. Father Ephraim was born at Anxerre, the Brother of Mon fear Chateau de Boys, Councellor of the Parliament of Paris y who was very happy in learning Languages, fo that in a little time he fpoke Englijh and Port ague z, perfectly well. But now the Clergy of St. 71 ?£?^j--Church fgTng Father Ephraim in fo high a re putation,and that he drew thegreatefi: part of their Congregation to Madrefpa- tm, were fo enrag’d againlt him that they refolv’d to ruine him. And thus they laid their plot. The Englijh and Portaguez.es being neer-neighbours, could not choofe but have feveral quarrels one among another, and Rill Father Ephraim was appli’d to for the compofing their differences. Now one day it happen’d,that the Portugueses quarrell’d on purpofe with fome Engltfh Mariners that were in St. Thomas-Koati , and the Englijh came by the worft. The Englijh Prefident re- folving to have fatisfadlion for the in jury,a War broke out between the two Na tions.* which had ruin’d all the Trade of that Country, had not the Merchants on both fides been very diligent to bring things to an accommodation .* not know ing any thing'of the wicked contrivance of particular perfons againR Father Pfhraim. But all the interpofition of the Merchants avail’d nothing : the Friar muft be concern’d in the affair, he muR be the Mediator to ad between party nnd party,which he readily accepted. But he was no fooner enter’d into St.Tho- wys, but he was feiz’d by ten or twelve Officers of the Inquifition, who flipp’d him away in a Frigat that was bound at the fame time for Goa. They fetter’d and manacl’d him, and kept him two and twenty days at Sea, before they'would let im once put his foot a-fhore : though the beR part of the Mariners lay a-ffioar ^very night. When they came to 6W,they Raid till night before they would land ‘JJ-her Ephraim, to carry him to the Jnquiftion-Houft. For they w r ere afraid, ^ thc Y Ronld land him in the day, the people fhould know of it, and rife in me refcue of a perfon,who was in an high veneration over all India. The news Was Patently fpread abroad in all parts, that Father Ephraim was in the Inqmf- which very much amaz’d all the French-vnzrt. But he that was moR fur- P n £ d,and moR troubl’d at it was Friar Zenon, the Capuchin, who had been for- foMH ^ at ^ er Efhr aim's Companion ^ who after he had confulted his friends,re- w Q to go to Goa, though he were put into the Inquifition hirafelf. For when tor Hn 1S 0nCe ^ ut . u E t here, if any one have the boldnefs to fpeak to the Inquifi- &gt; otto any of his Councel in his behalf, he is prefently put into the Inquiftion d ' a!&amp;Travels in India. P&lt;irt II, alfo, and accounted a greater Offender than the other. Neither the Arch BilW nor the Vice-Roy themfelves dare interpofe ^ though they are the only two p er , fons over whom the Inquijition has no power. For if they do any thing to offend them,they prefently write to the Inquiiitor and his Council in Portugal^ as the King and the Inquifitor*General commands, they either proceed againfl,or fend thofe two great perfons into Portugal. ^ Notwithstanding all thefe confiderations, Father Ze^taking along with him the Sieur de U Boulay, a decaid Gentleman,goes to Goa ; where,when he arriv’d! he was vifited by fome friends, who advife him toliave a care not to open his mouth in the behalf of Fatter Ejhram^ unlefs he intended to bear him company in the Inquifmon. Father Zenon feeing he could do nothing at Gpa, advis’d the Sieur de BouUy to return to Surat : and goes himfelf direfily ,to MadieffmnynoiQ particularly to inform himfelf concerning the reafon of Father Efhrainh being fent away. But when he underftood how he had been betraid at St. he refolv^d to have fatisfa^ion, and without acquainting the Ergltjh- Prefident,com municates his defign to the Captain that commanded in the Fort .* Who being in cens’d, as were all the Souldiers, at the injury done Father .Efhraim, not only approv’d, but alfo promis’d F ather Zenon to alhfl him in his defign. Thereupon the Father fets his fpies; and underftanding by them,that the Governor of StJFo- mas went every Saturday-morning, early tt&gt; a Chappel upon a Mountain half a league from the City,dedicated to the Mitgin-Maryjnz caufes three Iron-Bars to be fix’d in the window of a little Chamber in the Covent with two good locks to the door, and as many padlocks. And having fo done,he goes to the Governor of the Fort, who was an /n^-man, and a very flout perfon; who with thirty Souldiers, and Father Zenon^ iffu’d out of the Fort about midnight,and hidthem- felves till day near the Chappel* in a part of the Mountain, where they could not be difcover’d. The Governor of St .Thomas came exa&amp;ly Recording to his cuftom, a little after Sun-rifing - 7 and as fooh as ever he alighted from his Palkqmnym immediately furpriz’d by the Ambufcade,and earn d to Majlif at an 7 mto the Cham ber in the Covent which the Friar had provided for him. The Governor thus furpriz’d^made great proteflations againft Father Zenon 7 and threaten’d him with what the King would do when he fhould come to hear what he had practis’d againft the Governor of one of his Garrifons. To which Father Zenon faid no more, but only that he believ’d that he was better us’d at than fa ther Ephraim was us’d at the Inquifition at GW, whither he had fent him : That if he would obtain liberty for Father Ephraim to return,he would leave him in the fame place where they had feiz’d his perfon y with as much Juftice,as he had to fend Father Ephraim to Goa, Many people came to the Englifh Prefideot, de firing him to ufe his authority for the Governor’s lib erty. But his anfwer was, that the Governor was not in his jurifdi&amp;ion,neither could he compel Father^- non to releafe him, who had been one of the Authors of the injury which had been done his Companion. So that he contented himfelf only to defire of Fa ther Zenon that his Prifoner might dineat his Table in the Fort,promifing him m return him when he fhould require his body ; a requefl which he eafily obtain d, but could not fo eafily keep his word. For the Drummer of the Garrifion beinga French-mnn^ with a Merchant of MarfeWes, call’d Robdi, then in the Fort, two days after came to the Governor, and promis’d him, for a good reward, to pro cure his efcape. The agreement being made,the Drummer in the morning beat the Reveilles Poonzv than he was'wont to do,and lowder, while Wand the Go vernor let themfelves down at a corner of a Bafiion that was not very high j and were prefently as nimbly follow’d by the Drummer 7 fo that Madrefpam and St. Thomas being but half a league afunder, they were all three in the Town b e f 01 ; e their efcape was known. The whole City greatly rejoye’d at the return of their Governor, and immediately difpatch’d away a Barque to Goa to carry the news. The Drummer alfo and the Merchant fet fail at the fame time, and when they v came to Goa with Letters of recommendation in their behalf,there was nokioiH or Covent which did not make them Prefents : The Vice-Roy alfo himfelf rai e v,- them extremely, and took them into his own Ship to have carrid them into or along with him 7 but both he and the two Fr&amp;nch-mzn dy’d at Sea. NeverBook !• Travels in I n d i a. Never did any Vice-Roy depart from Goa fo rich as Bon Philippo de Mafcareg- nas * for he had a great parcel of Diamonds, all large ftones, from ten Carats to forty. He Ihew’d me two when I was ztGoa^ one whereof weigh’d 57 Carats^ other 67 and an half * clean Stones, of an excellent water, and cut after the /»- dm manner. The report was that the Vice-Roy was poifon’d in the Ship, and that it was a juft punilhment of Heaven, for that he had poifon’d feveral others, efpecially when he was Governor of CeyUn. He had always moft exquifite poi- fons by him, to make life of when his revenge requir’d it: for which reafon, ha- ving rais’d himfelf many enemies, one morning he was found hung in Effigie in Goa, when I was there in the year 1648. In the mean time, the Imprifonment of Father Ephraim made a great noife in Europe j Mon fear de Chateau des Bois, his Brother complain’d to the Portugal Em- bafladour, who prefently wrote to the King his Malter to fend a pofitive command by the firft Ships, that Father Ephraim fhould be difcharg’d.The Pope alfo wrote, declaring that he would excommunicate all the Clergy of Goa, if they did not fet him at liberty. But all this iignify’d nothing. So that Father Ephraim was be holding for his liberty to none but the King oi GolcondajNho had a love for him, and would have had him have Raid ztBagnagar.Vov the King was then at Wars with thei^ of Carnatica, and his Army lay round about St. Thomas's. Hearing there fore what a bafe trick the Portuguez.es had plaid with Father Ephraim,he lent or ders to his General Mirgimola to lay liege to the Town, and put all to Fire and Sword, unlefs the Governor would make him a firm promife that Father Ephraim jhould be fet at liberty in two months. A Copy of this Order was fent to the Governor, which fo alarm’d the Town, that they difpatch’d away Barque after Barque to prefs the Vice-Roy to ufe his endeavours for the releafe of Father Ephraim. Thereupon he was releas’d} but though the door were fet open, he would not ftir, till all the Religious Perfons in Goa came in proceffion to fetch him out. When he was at liberty he fpent 15 days in the Co vent of the Capu chins. I have heard Father Ephraim lay feveral times,that nothing troubl’d him fo much all the while of his imprifonment, as to fee the ignorance of the Inquilitor and his Council, when they put him any queflion .* and that he did not believe that any one of them had ever read the Scripture. They laid him in the feme Chamber, with a Maltefe, who never fpake two words without a defperate oath , and took Tobacco all day, and a good part of the night,which was very offenfive to Father Ephraim. When the Inquifitors feize upon any perfon, they fearch him prefently; and as for his Goods and wearing-Apparel, it is fet down in an Inventory,to be return’d him again in cafe he be acquitted} but if he have any Gold, Silver, or Jewels, that is never fet down ; but is carri’d to the Inquifitor to defray the expences of tne Procefs. They fearch’d the Reverend Father Ephraim, but found nothing in his Cloak-pockets, unlefs it were a Comb, an Inkhorn, and two or three Hand kerchiefs. But forgetting to fearch the little Pockets which the Capuchins carry in their fleeves toward their armpits, they left him four or five black-lead pens. Thefe Pencils did him a great kindnefs. For the Maltefe calling for fuch a deal of Tobacco, which is always cut ^nd ti’d up in white-paper, for the profit of the feller,who weighs both Tobacco and Paper together .• thefe Papers Father Ephraim kept very charily, and with his pencil wrote therein whatever he had ftudi’d at any time .* though he loft the fight of one of his eyes, through the darknefs of the Chamber,which had but one window,half a foot |fquare,and barr’d with iron. They would never fo much as lend him a Book,or let him have an end of Candle but us’d him as bad as a certain Mifcreant that had been twice let out already with his Shirt fulphur’d, and at St. Jlndrews-Crofs upon his ftomach,in company with fchofe that are lead to the Gallows, and was then come in again. father Ephraim having ftaid 15 days in the Covent of the Capuchins to re- cover his ftrength after 20 months imprifonment, return’d for Madrefpatan, and pairing through Golconda, went to return his humble thanks to the King of Go/- wnda and his Son-in-law,who had fo highly interefs’d themfelves for his liberty. 1 he King importun’d him again to flay at Bagmgar,hut feeing him refolv’d to re- tUrn to his Covent at Madrefpatan, they gave him as before, an Oxe, two Ser- vants, and Money for his journey- CHAP.88 Travels in India.

It was alfo carried away in great quantities by the Merchants of Balfara and Bagdat, who furnifh Arabia ; as allb by the Merchants of Adefopotamia, Anatolia, ConBaminofle, Romania, Hungary y and JV land. For in all thofe Countries, theyufeit either whole or beaten in molt of their meats, to heighten the tafte thereof. The Army which was commanded out of Batavia for the Siege of Cochin landed at a place call’d Belli-Porto -, where the Hollanders had a Fort made of Palm-Trees. It is near to Cranganor, a fmall City which the Hollanders took the year before ^ not being able to take Cochin then, though they had made fome attempts upon it. So foon as the Army landed, they march’d within Cannon-fhot of the City, there being a River between them and the City. That part where the Hollanders encamp’d, is call’d Belle-Epine, whzvQ after they had fortifi’d themfelves, as well as the Nature of,the place would permit, they rais’d fome Batteries, which could not much annoy the City, by reafon of the diflance. They lay there till they had recruits of more men j for they had but three Ships full, though he that commanded them were one of the braveft Captains of his time. Some few days after, the Governour of Amboym ar riv’d with two Ships more, and afterwards a Captain brought a great number of Chinglas, who are the Natives of the Ifland of Ceylan. For the Forces of the Hollanders would not be fo confiderable as they are, did they not make ufe of the Natives^of the Country to fill up the Companies which they bring out of iswoFe. The Natives of Ceylan, are good for digging Trenches, and railing Batteries, but for a Storm they fignifie little. Thofe of Amboym are good Soldiers, four hundred of which were left at Belle-Epine. The Body of the Army took Shipping again, and landed near to Cochin,not far from a Church dedicated to St. Andrew • where the Portugals, with certain Malavares, feem’d to have ftay’d afhore for the Hollanders coming : But feeing the Enemy to land with fo much refolution, they only gave them one Volly and retreated. In c their March the Hollanders defery’d certain Companies of Ponuguefes near the Sea-ihore, others fomewhat farther up in the Land, in a Church call’d St. Johns. Thereupon they fent out fome Horfemen to difeover their number; but the Portugals Hill retreated, after they had fet fire to the Church. Thereupon the Hollanders made their approaches to the Town ^ and after they had belieg ’4 it for fome time, a French Soldier, who was under their pay, feeing a Pannier ty’d at the end of a Cord, hanging over one of the Baftions, ventur’d not- withftanding all the Bullets that flew about his Ears, to fee what was in it. But he was ftrangely furpriz’d, to find nothing but a languilhing -Infant, which the Mother had hung there, that (he might not fee it perifh for hunger. The Soldier mov’d to compaflion, took the Infant and gave it fuch as he had to eat j at which the Dutch General was fo incens’d, faying that the Soldier Ihould have let the Infant perifii, that he call’d a Council of °War, where he would have had the Soldier run the Gauntlet, which was very cruel j but the Coun cil moderating the fentence, condemn’d him only to the Strappado. The fame day ten Soldiers out of every Company were commanded tog 0 to oneof the Houfes of the King of Cochin i but thev found no body thete, . • u. 7 havingmm Book I Travels in I u d i a. having plunder’d it the year before. At which time the Hollanders Hew four Kings of the Couutry.and iix hundred Blacks \ nor did there efcape but only one ancient Queen, who was taken alive by a common Soldier, call’d Re*. whom the Commander of the Army made a Captain immediately, for his re* ward. They left one Company in that Houfe ; but the Queen flay’d there but iix days, for they gave, her iiito the cuftody of Savarin, one of the moft potent of the petty Kings upon that Coaft,to whom the Hollanders had promis'd to give the City of Cr^^or, if they took Cochin % provided he would be faith ful to them. Six weeks pafs’d ere any thing confiderable was done ; but then the Hol- landers, florming the Town by night, were repuls’d, and loft abundance of men, (lain and taken Prifoners, through the Governour of Cranganors fault, who commanded them,and was drunk when the aflault was made. Two months after the General of the Hollanders refolv’d to make another aflault in the fame place j and becaufe he would not want men, he fent for thofe that lay upon the fide of Bette-epine. But by misfortune the Frigat ftruck upon the Sands and fplitting, abundance of the Soldiers were drown’d. They that could fwim* got to land near Cochin, not finding any other place convenient, and were all taken Prifoners by the Portugals, being not above ten in all. Soldiers and Mariners. -The General however would not give over the aflault, but caufing the Searmen to land, he arm’d fome with half-Pikes, others with Swords, to others he gave hand-Granadoes, and about ten a Clock in the morning he began the aflault, with four Companies, confifting each of a hundred and fifty men. The Hollanders loft abundance of men in this laft aflault, and fb did the Portu- guefes, for they defended themfelves ftoutly, being feconded by two hundred Soldiers, who were all Dm^-men, tho they fided with the Portngnefesy becaufe their Countrymen had abated them fix months and a half pay for the lofs oiTouan. Without the afliftance of thefe Soldiers, the City had never held out two months, ' there being among them one of the belt Hatch Engineers of his time, wh6 had left his Countrymen by reafon of their ill ufage of him. At length the Hollanders having enter’d the Town toward evening, on Cali- we fide, and being Mailers of the chief Bulwark, the Portagals came to a Capitulation, and the City was furrender’d. The Portugal by their Articles march’d out of Cochin with their Arms and Baggage} but when they came out ofthe City where the Hollanders were drawn up in Battaliajhzy were all forc’d to quit their Arms, and to lay them at the Generals feetexcept the Officers, who kept their Swords. The General had promis’d the Soldiers the Pillage of the Town, but not being able to keep his word , for feveral plaulible reafons which he told,, he promis’d them fix months pay, which in a few days after was reduc’d to eight Roupies a man. Samarin alfo demanded of him the City of Cranganory according to his promife * which the General made good 5 but he caus’d all the Fortifications to be flighted firft, and left Samarin nothing but the bare Walls. For being of a very mean Extraction, he was naturally as cruel and barbarous in his difpofition. One time the Souldiers being fo put to b ^° ur days t0 § etIier 9 ^at they could get no food for money, two of them had fomewhere taken a Cow and kill’d her ^ for which the General, when he came to know of it, caus’d one of them to be bang’d immediately, and had or- him 0t ^ er t0 ^ 3Ve rUn thc Craunt * et ’ ^ad not King Perea interceded for W a S a petty King of that Countrey, with whom the General was Treaty; and the Treaty being at length concluded,the General mufter’d his Land and Sea-men, to the number of about fix thoufand men. A few ays arter, he fent fome Companies to befiege the City of Cananory which fur- emer d without any refiftence. When they return’d,the General caus’d a Crown e made for the new King of Cochiny the other being expell’d his Countrey, npr I 1 ? 0111 lec * a y which he had appointed for this moft folemn Coronation,the Ge- 1 - a at upon a kind of a Throne, at the foot whereof, a Malay are or Pirat* 'gleduither between three Captains of each fide, fell upon his knees to Kinor? 6 Crown from the Generals hand, and to do homage fof a petty 5 cun, that is to fay, the little City of Cochin and its Territories, which * N wer£Travels in I n d i a. were very fmall. The King and the King-maker were both alike. For no TT it could not but be a pleafant fight, to fee a Hollander, that had been ° i the Cook of a Ship, crowning a miferable Pirat with thofe hands that HpH y haadled a Ladle than a Sword. ner In the mean time the Ships that carried the Inhabitants of Cochin to c return'd laden with the fpoils of thofe diftrefled people ; for contrary to th * Articles of Capitulation, the Hollanders were no fooner out at Sea but th took from thofe poor Creatures whatever they had, rifling both men and worn ^ without any regard to fex or modefty. raen » The General being return’d into Batavia, they fent a Governour to CWr who to make the place the ftronger, demolifh’d a great part of the City V ^ this Governour us’d the greateft rigor imaginable, even toward the Souldier^ he fhut them up in the City as if they had been in a Prifon ; nor could th S 5 drink either. Wine, or Sury, or Strong-water, by reafon of the great Impoff which he laid upon them. ( Sury is a drink which flows from the Palm-trees ) So that when the BortHguefes kept Cochin, men might live better for five or fe Sous, than under the Hollander for ten. This Governour was fo fevere that he would banifh a man for the fmalleft fault in the world, to the Ifland of Cev- lan, to a place where they made Brick, fometimes for five or or fix years, fome- times as long as the party liv’d. For it is oftentimes obferv'd, that when any one is banifh’d thither, though the fentence be only for a term of years yet the Exile never obtains his freedom afterwards. &gt; j miim CHAP. XVII. The Pajfage ly Sea from Ormtis to Maflipatan. 1 Departed from Gomron to ATajltpatan. the eleventh of May, 1652, and went aboard a great Veflel of the King of Golconda’s, which is bound every year from Perfia,tedeii with fine Calicuts,Chites,or Calicuts painted with a Pencil,which makes them much more beautiful and dearer than thofe which are printed. The Holland Company are wont to allow to thofe Vefiels which belong to any of the Kings or Princes of India, a Pilot, and two or three Gunners; neisher the Indians nor Per fans being expert in Navigation. In the VefTel where I was aboard there were but fix Batch Mariners at moft, but above a hundred Na tives. We failed out of the Golf, with a pleafing and favorable Gale; but we had not fail’d very far before we found the Sea very rough, and the Winds at South-Weft, fo violent, though full in our Stern, that we were not able to carry out more than one fmall Sail. The next day, and for fome days after, the Wind grew more violent, and the Sea more boift’rous 5 fo that being in the fixteenth Degree, which is the elevation of 6W, the Rain, the Thunder, and Lightning, render’d the Tempeft the more terrible} infomuch that we could not carry out any other than our top-fail, and that half furl’d. We pafs’d by Maldives Iflands, but were not able to difcern them, befides that the Ship had taken in very much water in tbs Hold. For the Ship had lain five months in the Road of Gomron, where if the Mariners are not very careful to wafh the Planks that lye out of the water, they will be apt to gape, which caufes the Ship to leak when fhe is loaden. For which reafon the Hoi* landers wafh the outfide of their Ships morning and evening. We had in our Veffelfive and fifty Horfes, which the King of Per fa had fent as a Prefentto the King of Golconda and about a hundred Merchants, Per fans and Armenians together, who were Traders to India. One whole day and night together there rofe a crofs Wind, fo violent, that the Water rowPd in from Stern to Stern, and the mifehief was, that our Pumps were nought. By good fortune there was a Merchant that had two Bails of Rajfa Leather, befides four on five Sadlers that knew how to low the Skins, who were very ferviceable as wellBook I. Travels in I n d i a. * N 2 While to the whole Ship as to themfelves. For they made great Buckets of the Skins, four Skins to a Bucket, which being let down from the Malls with ,PuIlies’ through certain great Holes which were cut in the Deck* drew up a vail quan tity of Water. The fame day the violence of the Tempelt continuing, there fell three Thunderbolts into the Ship. Thefirft fell upon the Boltfprit, pnd fplit it quite in two ^ and running along upon the Deck, kill’d three men. ^he fecond fell two hours after, and kill’d two men, (hooting along as the other did from Head to Stern. The third follow’d prefently after, the Mailer the Mailers Mate,and my felf Handing together near the main Mas&amp; At what time the Cook coming to ask the Mailer whether he Ihould take up the Vidiials,the Thun derbolt took him in the lower part of his Belly, made a little hole, and took off all the Hair as clean as they drefs a Pig with hot water and Rolin,without doing him any more harm. Only when they came to anoint the little hole w^th Oil ofCW^he roar’d out through the lharpnefs of the pain which he endur’d. The twenty-fourth of in the morning, we difeover’d Land ^ and ma king toward it, we fouhd our felves before Pome de Gaik, the firll Town in the Hand of CeyUn, which the Hollanders had taken from the Ponugals. From thence to the Road of Majlifatan we had very good weather} where we ar riv’d the fecond of July, an hour or two after Sun-fet. There I went alhore, and was tiiolt civilly treated by the Dutch Prehdent, and Merchants, as alfo by the English. The eighteenth and nineteenth of Jane^ the Sieur Dh Jardin and I, bought us two Pallekts, and fix Oxen to carry our felves, our Servants, and our Luggage. Our delign was to have gone dire&amp;ly to Golconda, there to have fold the King a parcel of long Pearls, the leaft whereof weigh’d thirty-four Carats, and the biggeft thirty-five,with Tome other Jewels,the moll part whereof were Emraulds. But the Hollanders affuring us, that our journey would be to no purpofe, int regard the King would buy nothing that was rare, or of a high price, till Mr- gimola, his General and prime Minilter of State, had view’d the Commodity - 9 underltanding therefore, that he was then at the Siege of Gandicot, in the Pro vince of Carnatica, we refolv’d to go thither to him.

The next day, being the one and twentieth, we travell’d three Leagues, and ky at a Village calPd Nilmol. The two and twentieth, we travell’d fix Leagues,to another Village j crofting the River upon a floating Bridg, before we came thither. The three and twentieth, after we had travel’d flx hours, we came to Pate- a pitiful Village, where we were conffrain’d to lye three days by rea son of the Rains. The twenty-feventh, we came to a great Town, call’d Bezjouan 9 not being ^ble to travel above a League and a half, becaufe the Road was overflow’d* 1 here we were forc’d to ftay four days, for the Rains had fd fweli’d the RL v er which we were to crofs, that the Ferryman could not govern his Btiat a- pinll the violence of the Stream. There we alfo left the Horfes which the ^ mg of Per fa fent to the King of Golconda ; which by that time were reduc’d tqTravels in India. While we flay’d at B &amp; omrt , we went to fee feveral Pagods, of which th Country is full ^ there being more than in any other part of India • f or U1]1 f e it be the Governours of Towns; and fome of their Domefticks, all the reft of the Inhabitants are Idolaters. The Paged belonging to the Town of is a very large one, but not clos’d with Walls ; it confifts of fifty-two Vilhr twenty foot high, that uphold a flat roof of Free-flone; they are adorn’d with feveral embofs d Figures of ugly Devils, and feveral forts of Creatures. Some of thofe Devils are made with four Horns* others with many Legs and many Tails, others lolling out their Tongues, and others in feveral other ridiculous pollutes. The fame Figures are cut in the Stone of the Roof, and between the Pillars Hand the Statues of their Gods upon Pedeftals. The Pagod is built in the midlt of a Court, of a greater length than breadth, encompafs’d with Walls, which are adorn’d within and without, with the fame Figures as the Pagod ; and a Gallery upheld by lixty-lhc Pillars, runs round the Wall, after the manner of a Cloy fief. You enter into this Court through a wide Portal upon which are two Niches, one above another, the firll upheld by twelve’ the other by eight Pillars. At the bottom of the .Pillars of the Pagod, are certain old Indian Characters, of which the Priells ofthdfe Idolaters themfelves can hardly tell the meaning. We went £o fee another Pagod, built Upon a Hilly to which there is an af- cent of a hundred and ninety-three Heps, every one a foot high. The Pagod is four-fquare, with a Cupola at the top; and has the fame embofs’d Figures, as the Pagod of Bez,oHan^ round about the Walls. In the middle, there is an Idol fitting crofs-leg’d, after the manner of the Country; and in that fitting pollute it is about four foot high; Upon the Head it has a Triple Crown, from which four Horns extend themfelves; and it has the face of a man, turn’d to ward the Eall. The Pilgrims that come out of devotion to thefe Pagods, when they enter, clafp their hands together, and rear them up to their foreheads; then they advance toward the Idol, tolling their two hands fo clafpt together, and crying out feveral times Ram, Ram^ that is to fay, God, God. When they come near, they ring a little Bell that hangs upon the Idol it felf, after they have befmear’d the Face, and feveral parts of the Body, with feveral forts of Painting. Some there are that bring along with them ViolsofOil, with which they anoint the Idol; and befides, they make an Offering to it of Sugar, Oil, and other things proper to be eaten; the richer fort alfo adding pieces of Sil ver. There are fixty Priells that belong to the Idol, and maintain themfelves, their Wives and Children upon the Offerings brought to the Idol. But to the end the Pilgrims may believe the Idol takes them, the Priells let them lye two days, and the third day in the evening they take them away. When any Pilgrim goes to a Pagod, to be cur’d of any dillemper, he brings the Figure of the Member affeCted made either in Gold, Silver, or Copper, according to his quality, which he offers to his god ; and then falls a finging, as all the reft do, after they have offer’d. Before the Gate of the Pagod, there is a flat Ro&amp;f, upheld by fixteen Pillars, and right againll it,is another upheld by eight; which ferves for the Prielts Kitchin. On the South-fide there is a large Plat form cut in the Mountain, where there is a pleafing lhade of many fair Trees, and feveral Wells digg’d in the ground. Pilgrims come far and near to this Pagod ; and if they be poor, the Priells relive them with what they receive from the rich, that come there out of devotion. The great Feafl of this Pa god is in the month ot Ottober, at which time there is a great concourfe of people from all parts. While we were there, there was a Woman that had not llirr’d out of the Pagod for three days together; and her prayer to the Idol was, fince Ihe had loll her Husband, to know what fhe Ihould do to bring up her Children. Thereupon asking one of the Priells, wherefore Ihe had no anfwer, or whether Ihe was to have any anfwer or no; he told me, that ihe mull wait the pleafure of their God, and that then he would give her an ' fwer to what Ihe expedted. Upon this I millrulted fome cheat, and to dilco- ver it,I refolv’d to go into the Pagod when all the Prielts wereabfent at Dinner, there being only one that llood'at the Gate, whom Ifeiit to fetch water at a Fountain two or three Musket-lhot from the place. During c aBook I. India. time I went in,and the Woman hearing me,redoubled her cries; for there beinp no light i n the Paged, but what comes in at the door, it is very dark. J fek mv way to the Idol, and by the glimmering light obferv’d an hole behind the Idol I could not do this fo quickly, but that the Prieft return’d before I had done He curlt me for propharnng his Temple,as he call’d it. But we became fuddenlv verv good friends by the mediation of two Roupies which I put into his hands wher/ upon he prefently prefented me with fome of his Betle. . The one and thirtieth, we departed from Bez.ouart, and pait the River which runs to the Mine of Gam or Coal our. It was then neer half a league broad hv. reafon of the great Rams which had fall’n continually for eight or nine davs to gether. After we had travell’d three leagues on the other fide of the River ew came to a great Paged built upon a large Platform, with an afeent of i s or 20 Heps. Within it flood the Figure of a Cow, all of very black-Marble and a number or deformed Idols four or five-foot-high; lome having many heads others many hands and legs; and the molt ugly are moll ador’d,and receive molt Offerings. 37s 3731!j sbil rbns nO Y 377 nnoO ybnnl jefi £ 73vo sntsef * v- A quarter of a league from this Paged is a large Town; but we travell’d three leagues farther, and came to lie at another Town, call’d Kab-Katintti to which there is a fmall Pagod, wherein there Hand five or fix Idols of Marble verv well t jr;rli 61 • sM radio 3(lj no bsid sis Jnrii n^rii &lt;vt ' The firft of -jAmfi we came to a great City call’d Coudevir, with adouble- Moat, pav d at the bottom with Free-ftone.

We lay at the Covent of Capuchins, at what time Father Ephraim, and Father Zem were both there. The fifteenthjWe went to St, Thomas’s Town, to fee the ^/^-Friars^nd the Jefuits Church,in the firft whereof is an Iron-lance, wherewith they fay that St. Thomas was Martyr’d. . : The two and twentieth, in the morning we departed from Madrefpaun, and after a journey of five leagues we arriv’d at a large Town call’d Serravmn. The three and twentieth, after 7 leagues travel,we came to the whole days journey being over a flat fandy Countrey.On each fide there are onlyCopfes of Bambotis that grow very high. Some of thefe Copfes are fo thick,that it is im- poflible for a man to get into them ; but they are pefter’d with prodigious num bers of Apes: Thofe that breed in the Copfes upon onefide of the way,are ene mies to them that are bred on the other fide} fo that they dare not crofs from one lide to the other, but they are in danger of being immediately ftrangPd. Here we had goodfport by fettingthe Apes together by theears y which isdone after this manner. This part of the Country, at every leagues end, is clos’d up with Gates and Barr icado’s where there is a good Guard, kept, and whereall Fal len gers are examin’d whither they go, and whence they corner fo that men may fafely travel there with their Money in their hands. In feveral parts of this Road there is Rice to be fold; and they that would fee the fport, caufe five or fix Baskets of Rice to be fet in the Road, fome forty or fifty paces one from the other,and clofe by every Basket they lay five or fix battoons about two-foot-long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide thcmlelves .* prefently they lhall fee the Apes on both Tides of the way defcend from the tops of the Bambous, and advance toward the Baskets which are full of Rice: They are about half an hour fhewing their teeth one at the other before they come near the Baskets , fometimes they advance, then retreat again,being loath to encounter. ^ Atlength the female-Baboons, who are molt couragious than the males, efpecially thofe that have young ones, which they carry in their arms, as woman do their Chil dren, venture to approach the Basket, and as they are about to put in their heads to eat, the males on the other fide advance to hinder them. Immediately the other party comes forward, and thus the feud being kindled on both fides, they take up the Battoons that lie by the Baskets, and thrafh one another in good earnefl:. The weakelt are conftrain’d to flie into the wood with their pates bro ken, and their limbs maim’d; while the Mailers of the Field glut themfelves with Rice. Though it may be, when their bellies are full, they will foffer fome of the female-party to come and pertake with them. . The four and twentieth, we travell’d nine leagues, all the way being like the Road the day before,as far as Naratieron. ^ The five and twentieth, after a journey of eight hours, through a Countrey ot the fame nature, meeting at every two or three leagues end with Gates and Guards, we came in the evening to GawL The lix and twentieth, we traveled nine leagues,and came to lie at Courva, where there was nothing to be found neither for Man nor Beall, fo that our at- tel were forc’d to be contented with a little Grafs,which was cut on purpoie or them. Coarva is only a celebrated Paged 5 by which, at our arrival, we law e- veral bands of Souldiers pafs by, fome with Half-pikes, fome with Muskets, an fome with Clubs, who were going to joyn with one of the principal ders of Mirgimolas Army, who was encamp’d upon a riling-ground not tar r Courva the place being pleafant and cool, by reafon of the great num e Trees and Fountains that grace it. When we underllood the Captain was we went to wait upon him,and found him fitting in his Tent vvith m . aii y f p ke1&gt; the Country all Idolaters. After we had prefented him with a pair 0 p.^ gTravek in In d i a. Book I. pjftols inlaid with Silver, he demanded of us what had brought us into that Countrey; but when we told him that we came to attend Mirgimla, Generalif. fmo of the King of Gelconda's Army, about bufinefs,he was infinitely kind to us: However,underftanding that he took us for Hollanders,we told him we were not Hollanders, but Frenchmen. Thereupon, not underfbmding what Nation we were, he fell into a long difcourfe with us about the Government of our Coun trey, and the Grandeur of our King. Six or feven days before,they had taken five or fix Elephants, three whereof had efcapM, having kill’d ten or twelve of the Natives who affifted in the Chace ; in purfuit whereof the General was prepa ying ; and becaufe we could not ftay to fee the fport^we were contented to inform our felves of the manner of hunting that vaft Animal} which is thus. They cut but feveral Alleys or Walks in the Wood,which they dig full of great deep holes, and cover with Hurdles Itrow’d over with a little earth. Then the Hunters hoop* ing and hollowing, and beating up Drums,with Pikes that have Wild-fire ti’d co the end of them, force the Elephant into thofe Walks,where he tumbles into the holes,not being able to rife again. Thenthey fetch Ropes and Chains.- andfome they bring under their bellies, others they wind about their legs and trunk, and when they think they have fufficiently hamper’d the Beaft, they have certain En gines ready, wherewithal to draw him up. Neverthelcfs, of five, three efcap’d^ notwithftanding the cords and chains about their bodies and their legs. The people told us one thing which feem’d very wonderful} which was, that thefe Elephants having been once deceiv’d,and having efcap’d the fhare,arevery miltrull- ful ever after } and when they get into the Wood again, they break off a great bough from one of the Trees with their trunk, with which they examine every ftep they go,before they fet down their feet,to try whether there be any hole or no in their way. 'So that the Hunters that told us the Story,feern’d to be out of hopes of ever taking thofe three Elephants which had efcap’d. Had we been allur’d that we might have been eye-witneffes of this miraculous precaution of the Elephant, we would have ftaid three or four days, what-ever urgent bufinefs we had had. The Captain himfelf vWas a kind of a Brigadeer, that commanded three or four-thoufand m^n, who were quarter’d half a league round the Countrey. The feven and twentieth, after two hours travel,we came to a great Village, where we faw the two Elephants which had been fo lately taken. Every one of the two wild Elephants was plac’d between two tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants flood fix men, with every one an Half-pike in their hands, and a lighted-! orch faften’d at the end of the Pike, who talk’d to the Bealls, giving them meat, and crying out in their language, eat /V.The food which they gave them was a little bottle of Hey,fome pieces of brown-Sucre, and Rice boil’d in water,with fome few corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refus’d to do as they were bidden, the men made figns to the tame Elephants to beat them,which they did,banging the refractory Elephant upon the head and forehead with their trunks} and if he offer’d to make any refiffence, the other Elephant thwackthim on the other fide} fo that the poor Elephant, not knowing what to do,was con- ftrain’d to learn obedience. Being thus fall’n into the Story of Elephants, I will add fome other obferva- tions, which I have made upon the nature of thofe Animals. Though the Ele phant never meddles with the female,after he is once taken, yet he is fometimes feiz d with a kind of lullful rage. Gne day that Sha-jehan was an Hunting upon one of his Elephants, with one of his Sons that fat by him to fan him, the Ele phant became fo furious by reafon of his lull, that the Governor who was by no tons able to mailer him, declar’d to the King,that to allay the fury of the Ele- phantjwho would elfe doubtlefsbruife him to pieces among the Trees, there was £o way, but for one of the three to forfeit his life : and that he would willingly iacrifice his for the fafety of the King and the Prince his Son. Only he defir’d hjs Majelly to take care of three fmall Children which he mull leave behind him. Having fo faid 5 he threw himfelf under the Elephant’s-feet, who had no fooner . a . him in his trunk and fqueez’d him to pieces with his feet, but he grew as finiet and peaceable as before. The King,asan acknowledgment for fofamousa f e hverance,gave to the poor two-hunder’d-thoufandRoupies,and highly advanc’d , everyI 96 Travels in India. every one of the Sons of him that had fo generoufly laid dewn his life for th fafety of his Sovereign. e I obferv’d alfo, that though the Elephant's skin be very hard while he i iS ai;- yet when he is dead, it is juft like melted-glue. Elephants are brought from feveral parts of India ; as from the hland of Ov where they are very fmal4 but the moft couragious of all: from thelfleof Sumatra \ from the Kingdom of Gubin j from the Kingdom of Siam • and from the Frontiers of the Kingdom of Boutam neer the Gixat-Tariark. They are brought alfo from the Coaft of Melinda, Eaftward of Jffrica : where they are in very great numbers, according to the report of a iVr^e^e-Captaic, made at Goa, who came from thence to make fome complaint againft the Governor of Mo zambique. He told me that he had feen all along that Coaft feveral Parks that were empal’d with nothing but Elephants-teeth,the leaft of which Parks is above a league about .* He added farther, that the Blacks of the Country hunt their Elephants,and eat the Flelh. But they are oblig’d to give the tusks of every one they kill to the Lord of the place. When they intend to take their Elephants in the liland of Cey/^they make a long lane,clos’d in on both fides,fo that the Ele phant can neither run to the right nor to the left •• this lane is broad at the fir#,but grows narrower and narrower,till there is no more room left at the farther-end than for the female-Elephant to lie down,which muft be one that is covetous of the male at the fame time. Though Ihe be tame, yet Ihe is bound with good Ropes and Cords,and by her cries will call the male-Elephant,who prefently runs through the lane towards her. Now when the Elephant comes where the lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpofe, immediately barricadoupthe lane behind,and when he comes neer the female,there is another Barricado fet up that ftgps him from going any farther. When he is thus between the Barricade’s, they fo entangle his legs and trunk with ropes and cords,that he is foon taken, ha ving no way to help himfelf. The fame way they ufe for the moft part in the Kingdoms of Siam, and Pegu, only that the Natives there mount the female- Elephant,and go to find out the male in the Forrefts. And when they have met with his haunt, they tye the female to the .moft convenient place they can find, and then they fix their fnares for the Elephant, who in a Ihort time haltens toward the female, hot for Generation, where her cries call him. This is obfervable of the female-Elephant, that when file begins to be hot,fhe gathers together a great heap of herbs and weeds, and makes her fdf a kind of bed fome four or five-foot-high from the ground, where contrary to the cuftom of all other creatures, fhe lies upon her back, in expectation of the male, whom file calls to her by a peculiar cry. * This is alfo particular to the Elephants in the file of Cey^that only the firft Elephant which the female produces, has any tusks. And it is alfo obfervable, that the Ivory which comes from Acben when it is wrought, has this peculiar quality with it, that it never grows yellow, like that which comes out of the Continent, and from the Eaft-Jndies, which makes it more efteem’d, and dearer than any other. When the Merchants bring Elephants to any place to fell, ’tis a pleafant fight to fee them go along. For in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by, the children will be running after the little ones to play with them, and give them fomething or other to eat. While the young Elephants, which are very wanton, are bulily taking what is offer’d them, the children leap upon their backs .* but when the young Elephants that lately llopt for the lucre of the Victuals perceiving their Dams, a great way before, double their pace, and playing with their trunks, throw the children off their backs to the ground, yet without doing them any harm. Notwithftanding all the enquiry I have made, I could never find exa&amp;ly how long an Elephant will live. Nor can all the Governors and keepers of thole creatures tell you more, than fuch an Elephant has been in the poffeflion 0^ their Father,their Grandfather,and great Grandfather. And by that computation, I found that they had liv’d fome of them fix-fcore, or an hunder’d and thirty years. Tbs.m ||,M hem — Book I. Travels in I N D I Thegreateft part of thofe that have made Relations of Mia, boldly affirm that the Great Mogul keeps three or four-thoufand Elephants. But being my felf at ’jehanabad, where the King at prefent refides, he that was chief Matter of the Elephants, allur’d me that the King had not above five-hunder’d Elephants which were call’d Elephants of the Houfe,made ufe of only to carry the Women’ their Tents,and Luggage; but that for the Wars,he only kept fourfcore,or four- fcore and ten at moft. The nobleft of the latter fort is always referv’d for the King’s Eldeft Son, the allowance for his food and other neceharies being &lt;oo ilcmpies a month,which comes to 750 Litres. There are fome that are not al low’d above 50, others 4©, others,30,and fome but 20 Roupies. But thofe Ele phants that are allow’d an hunder’d, two-hunder’d, three-hunder’d or four- hunder’d Roupies a-month, have belonging to them certain Horfe-men that live upon the fame pay, and two or three young fellows to fan them during the heat of the weather. All thefe Elephants are not always kept in the City : the greateft part being led out every morning into the fields, or among the thickets Where they feed upon the branches of Trees, Sucre-canes,and Millet,to the great detriment of the poor Country man. But not a little to the profit of their Keepers; for the iefs they eat at home, the more they gain into their own purfes.

It is encompaft with many little Chambers for):he Priefts Lodgings .• five- hunderd paces beyond there is a wide Lake, upon the banks wheraof are built feveral Pagods eight or ten-foot-fquare j and in every one an Idol reprefenting the lhape offome Devil, with a Bramere^ who takes care that no ftranger that is hot of their fuperftition, fhall come to wafh, or take any water out of the Lake. If any ftranger defiresany water,they bring it in earthen-pots.* and if by chance their pot touches the ftranger’s Vefifel, they break it immediately. They told me alfo.that if any ftranger, not of their fuperftition,Ihould happen by accident to Waft in that Lake, they muft be forc’d to drain the lake of all the water that was in at that time. As for their alms,they are very charitable ^ for there palfes by no perfon in neceffity, or that begs of them, but they give them to eat and (Irink of fach as they have. There are feveral Women that fit upon the Road^ whereof fome of them always keep fire for Travellers to light their Tobacco by. Nay,they will give a Pipe to fome that have none at all. Others boil Rice with Qicheri, which is a grain fornewhat like our Hemp-feed. Others boil Beans with their Rice,becaufe the water wherein they are boil’d never puts thofe that are over-hot into a pleurify. There are-Women that have vow’d to perform thefe ads of Charity to firangersTor feven or eight years,fome for more,fome for lefs, according to their convenience. And to every Traveller they give fome of their Beans,and Rice-water,and an handful of Rice to eat. There are other Women upon the high-way, and in the fields, looking behind their Horfes, their Oxen, their Cows, who have made vows never to eat but what they find indigelled m the dung of thofe Beafts.Now in regard there is neither Barly nor Oats in that Countrey, they give their Cattle certain great crooked Peafe, which they bruife neiOre between two Mill-ftones: and then lay them in fteep for half an hour} ^01 they are a very folid fubftance, and hard to be digefted. They give their Cat- t dieie Peafe every evening; and in the morning they feed them with two ponnu of dark-brown-Sugar, like Wax,kneaded together with as much Meal,and nnc-ponnd of Butter, whereof the Oftlers or Grooms make little round Balls ao- iC ltle J t ^ iru ^ : d° wn their throats; for otherwife they-would never eat them, ^ueuvards they wadi their mouths, that are all over clamm’d, efpecially their wriIc h makes them have fttch an averlion againft that fort of food.

Part II, The one and thirty’th,after we had travell’d nine hours, we Itopt at Goman The firft of September we travell’d but fix leagues, and came to lie at Gandkot It was but eight days before, that the Nahab had taken that City,after a Siege of three months. Nor had it been taken without the affiftance of certain French* men,who had forfaken the fervice of the D/^-Company,by reafonof ill-ufage Jhey had alfo feveral Englijh and Dutch-Cannoneers, with two or three Italic which mainly forwarded the furrender of that place. Gandicot is one of the ftrongeft Cities in the Kingdom of Cammca. Itis fitua- ted upon the point of an high Mountain } there being but one afcent to it, not above twenty or five and twenty-foot-broad at moft; in fome places not above feven or eight-foot-wide. On the right-hand of the way, which is cut out of the Mountain, there is a moft hideous precipice } at the bottom whereof runs a vaft River. Upon the top of the Mountain there is a fmall plain, but a quarter of a league broad, and about half a league long. This is all fow’d with Rice and Millet,and water d with many little Springs. The topofthe plain on theSouth- fide,where the City is built, is encompaft with precipices, two Rivers running at the bottom, which form the point. So that there is but one Gate to enter into the City from the plain-fide} and that too fortifi’d with three good walls of Free-ftone,with Moats pav’d at the bottom with Free-ftone} fo that the befieg’d had but only one quarter of the City to defend, containing about five hunder’d paces. They had but two Iron-Guns, the one carrying twelve-pound-Ball, the other eight. The one was planted upon the Gate, the other upon a point of a kind of a Baftion. So that until the Nahab had found the way to mount his Can non upon a very high place neer the City, he loft a great number of men by fe veral fa Hies which the Befieg’d made. The Raja that was within, was efleem’d one of the braveft and moft experienc’d Captains that ever were amongft the Ido laters : whereupon,the Nahab finding that the place was not to betakeji,unlefshe could get up his Cannon to the top of that fteep afcent, fent for all the French men that were in the King’s fervice,promifing to every one four months extraor dinary pay, if they could find away to mount his Cannon up to the topof fucha place} wherein they had the good-hap to be very fuccesful. For they mounted four pieces of Cannon, and were fo profperous,as to hit the great Gun that was planted upon the Gate, and render it unferviceable. At length, when they had beaten down good part of the Wall of the City,the Befieged came to capitulate, and march’d out of the Town upon good Articles. The day we arriv’d, all the Army was encamp’d at the foot of the Mountain, in a plain, through which there ran a very fair River where the Nahab mufter’d his Cavalry, and found them in a very good condition. An £«^///b-Cannoneer and an Italian feeing Mon- fieur Jar din and my felf pafs by, gnefs’d us to be FranguRs } and becaufe it was late,accofted us very civilly ,and oblig’d us to ftay with them all night. By them we underftood that there was in the City a Fre^c/^-Engineer, whofe name was Claudius MaiUe of Bourges^ and that he was employ’d by the Nahab to call fom6 pieces of Cannon which the Nahab intended to leaye in the City. T he next day we went into the City, and found out Maille^s Lodging, haying been acquainted with him at Batavia ; who informing the Nahab of our arrival, he prefently fent us Provifion for our felves and our beafts. The third day we went to wait upon the who had pitch’d his Tents up on that part of the plain neer the place where the way is cut out of the Rock. We inform’d him of the caufe of our coming, telling him that we had fome Com modities that were rare, and worth the King’s buying ; but that we were unwil ling to fhew them to the King till he had feen them; believing it our duty to render him that refped. The Nahab was very well-pleas’d with our Comple ment •, and after he had caus’d us to be prefented with Betle\ we took our leaves of him, and return'd to our Lodgings, whither he fent to us two Bottles of Wine,one of Sack,and the other of which is a rare thing in that Countrey. . The fourth day we waited upon him again, and carried along with us fome Pearles of an extraordinary weight,beauty and bignefs} the leaft whereof weigh twenty four Caratts. After he had vewd them and Ihew’d them to fome of the Lords that were about him,he ask’d the price, which when we had fet him, he return us our Jewels and told us he would confider of it.

They wfre loofe Stones, of a very black Water, and very fmall ^ none of them exceeding a Carat, or a Carat and a half ; but other- wife very clean. There were fome few that might weigh two Carats. After the Nahab had fhew’nusall, he ask’d us whether they would fell in our Goufi* tr y. We made anfwer, that they might have been for fale in our Country, provided they had not been of a black Water; for that in Europe we never efteem’d any Diamonds, but fuch as were clean and white, having but a fmall • dteem for any others. It feems, that when he firfl: undertook the Conqueft of this Kingdom for the King ofGolcond^ they inform’d him that there were Dia mond Mines in it. Whereupon he fent twelve thoufand men to dig there; who in a whole years time could find no more than thofe five fmall Bags full.Where- upon the Nahab perceiving that they could find none but brown Stones, of a Water enclining much more to black than white, thought it but lofs of time, and fo fent all the people back to their Husbandry.* , The eleventh, the French Canoneers came all to the Nahabs Tent, com plaining that he had not paid them the four, months pay which he had pro mis’d them; threatning him,that ifjie did not difcharge it,they would leave him; to which the Nahab promis’d to give them fatisfa&amp;ion the next day. The twelfth,the Canoneers notfailing to give him another vilit, the Nahab paid* them three months, and promis’d to pay them the fourth before the month were out; but fo foon as they had receiv’d their Money, they fell a feafling one another, fo that the Dancing Wenches carried away the greateil part of their Coin. The thirteenth, the Nahab went out to fee the Guns which Maille had under taken to call. For which purpbfe he had fent for Brafs from all parts, and got together a great number of Idols which the Soldiers had pillag’d out of the Pagods as they march’d along. Now you muft know, that in Gandt- fot there was one Pagod, faid to be the faireft mail /Whz, wherein there were feveral Idols, fome of Gold, and others of Silver; amongft the reft there were fix of Brafs, three fitting upon their Heels, and three upon their Feet, ten foot high. Thefe Idols were made ufe of among the reft. But when Maille alfo had provided all things ready, he could not make thofe fix Idols run, that were taken out of the great Pagod of Gandkot, though he melted all the reft. He try'd feveral ways, but it was impoflible for him to do it, whatever expence the Nahab was at; nay though the Nahab threaten’d to hang the Priefts for having inchanted thofe Idols. And thus 'Maille could never make any more than only one fingle piece, and that fplit upon trial; fo that he was forc’d to leave the work unfinilh’d, and foon after left the Nahabs fervice. The fourteenth, we went to take our leaves of the Nahab^ and to know what he had further to fay to us, concerning the Commodities we had then ihew’n him. But then he told us, he was bufie at prefent about the examina tion of certain Offenders which were brought before him. For it is the cuftom of that Country,never to put a man in Prifon; but as foon as the Offender is taken, he is examin’d, and fentence is pronounc’d upon him, according to his crime, which is immediately executed ; or if the party taken,be found innocent, he is as foon acquitted. And let the controverfie be of what nature it will, it is pre- fently decided. . The fifteenth in the morning, we went to wait upon him again,and were im mediately admitted into his Tent, where he fat with his two Secretaries by him. The Nahab was fitting according to the cuftom of the Country,bare-foot, like one of our Taylors,with a great number of Papers fticking between his Toes, and othersbetween the Fingers ofhis left hand,which Papers he drew fometimes from between his Toes,fometimes from between his Fingers, &amp; order’d what anfwers Should be given to every one.After his Secretaries had wrote the anfwers, he caus’d mem to read them,and then took the Letters and feal’d them himfelf; giving fome lo Foot Meffengers, others to Horfemen. For you muft know,that all thofe Let- Lrs which are fent by Foot-Pofts all over India, go with more fpeed than LiOfe which are carried by Horfemen. The reafon is, becaufe at the end of -* O 2 everyIOO Travels in India. Pa rt II, every two Leagues there are little Huts, where there are men bIwotT T who are engag’d to run away immediately; fo that when one of thefem carries the Letters, comes to one of thefe Huts, he throws the Letters • lat Hut, and then he that is appointed, runs with them to the next Stage 6 look upon it as an ill Omen, to give the Letters into the Meffengers h \i * but they muft be thrown at his feet, and he muft gather them up i • ’ beobferv’dalfo, that the high ways in moft parts of India, are like Wal^ 'f Trees; and that where there are no Trees, at every five hundred par! a- fiance there are fet up little Heaps of Stones, which the Inhabitants of,)!’ next Villages are bound to white-wafli from time to time, to the end Letter-Carriers may not mifs their ways in dark and Rainy nights. While we ft °ta with the Nahab, certain Officers came to tell him, that they had broushr^ tain Offenders to the door of his Tent. He was above half an hour heLV?' return d them any anfwer,writing on,and giving inftrudiions to his Secret!*! but by and by, all of a hidden he commanded the Offenders to be brought in and after he had examin’d them, and made them confefs the crime of whirl! they flood accus’d, he was above an hour before he faid a word, ftill writin! on, and employing his Secretaries. In the mean while feveral of the Officers of the Army came to tender their refpedts to him in a very fubmiffive manner all whom he anfwer’d only with a nod. There was one of the Offenders which’ were brought before him, had broken into a Houfe, and had kill’d the Mother and three Children. He was condemned upon the fpot to have his Hands and Feet cut off, and to be call: out into the high way, there to end his davs in mifery. Another had rob’d upon the Highway; for which the Nahab or- der d his Belly to be ript up, and himfelf to be caft upon the Dunghill. I know not what crimes the other two had committed, but their heads were both cut off. When we perceiv’d him at a little leifure, we ask’d him whether he had any other Commands, to lay upon us, and whether he thought our Com- modities fitting to be ihew’n to the King. He anfwer’d, that we might go to Golconda^nA that he would write to his Son in our behalf,and that his Letter would be there fooner than we. And in order to our journey, he order’d us lixteen Horfemen to convoy ns, and to provide us neceflaries upon the Road, till we came to a River,thirteen Leagues from Gandicot, which no perfons are to pafs unleis they have the Nahabs Pafsport^ to keep the Soldiers from running from their Colours. CHAR XIX. The Road from Gandicot to Golconda. X H ? in the morning, we fet out of Gmdicot, accompanied with the greateft part of the Canoneers,who brought us the firfl days journey up on our way; and that day having travel’d feven Leagues, we came to lye at CotepsJi. . '^e feventeenth, the Canoneers took their leaves of us} and we kept on ouf journey with our Horfemen y and having travel’d fix Leagues, we lay at a Village calld Coteen, on the other fide of the River, which is very broad. So loon as we had crofs’d it, the Horlemen took their leaves of us; and though we made them a prefent of Roupies, to buy them Tobacco and Betle, yet we could not perlwade them’to take it. Their Ferry-Boats wherewith they crofs the River, arc like broad bottom’d Wicker Flaskets, cover’d without with Oxe’s Hides y at the bottom whereof they lay certain Faggots, over which they ipread a piece of old Tapeltry, to keep the Wares and Merchandife from the wet. As vim i ir loaches and Waggons, they fallen them between two Boats, by the Wheels and the Pole ; the Horfes fwimming all ths while, one man whip ping them on behind, while another in the Boat holds them up by the Head-102 Travels in India.

Though I am not bound to believe it. The twenty-third, we arriv’d at Dotipar, after we had traveled eight leagues and crofs’d feveral Torrents. The twenty-fourth, wetravel’d eight leagues, and came to Tripame-, where there is a great Pagod upon a Hill, to which there is a circular afcent of Free- ftone every way v the leaft Stone being ten foot long, and three broad: and there are feveral Figures of Damons in the Pagod. Amongft the reft, there is the Statue of Venus, ftanding upright, with feveral lafcivions Figures about her } all which Figures are of one piece of Marble 5 but the Sculpture is very ordinary^ The twenty-fifth, we travel’d eight leagues, and came to Mamli. The twenty-fixth, we travel’d eight leagues* more, and came to lye atm chd'u •.)!J The twenty-feventh, we travePd not above three leagues, being to crofs a wide River in Boats like Panniers which ufually takes up half the day} for when you come to the River fide, there is neither Pannier nor any thing elfe to crofs it. There was only one man,with whom we bargain’d for our paifage; who to try whether our money be good or no, made a great fire and threw it into the flame, as he does to all others that pafs that way. If among the Roupies which he receives, he meets with any one that turns a little black, you muft give him another y which he prefently heats red hot} when he finds his Money to be good, he calls to his Companions to fetch the Manequin or Flasket- Boat, which lay hid before in fome other part of the River. For thefe fort ofpeople are fo cunning, that if they defcryany PafTengers afar off, they will row their Manequin to the other fide, becaufe they will not be conftrain’dto carry any perfbn over without Money. But the Money being paid, the man that receives it •, calls his Companions together, who take the Boat upon their Shoulders, and when they have launch’d it into the River, they fetch their Paflengers and goods from the other fide. The twenty-eighth, having travel’d five leagues, we caitie to a place call’d Dabir-Rinta. The twenty-ninth, after twelve hours travel, we came to lye at Holcora. The thirtieth, we travel!’d eight leagues, and came to fpend our night at A- rider a. The firfl: of Ottobcr, after we had travel’d ten leagues, we came to lye at Atenara. This is a Houfe of Pleafure, which the prefent King’s Mother causa to be built. There are many Chambers in a great Tianza belonging toil, lor the convenience of Travellers. . . You mull take notice; that in all the Countries where we travePd as well in the Kingdom of Carnatica, as the Kingdoms of Colconda and Vifapour, theie are no Phyficians, but fuch as attend Kings and Princes. As for the common people, after the Rains are fall’n, and that it is time to gather Herbs, yon Inalf fee every morning the good women of the Towns going into the Fields, to gather fuch Simples which they know to be proper for fuch Difeafes as reign in the Family. ’Tis very true, that in great Cities there may be ® ne . or ^ men that have fome common Receipts, who go every morning, and fit 111 ^ known places, to give their Remedies to fuch as enquire for them, w they be Potions or Plaifters. Firfl: they feel their Pulfes, and then giving _ fome remedy, for which they do not demand the value of fix pence , 2 alfo at the fame time mutter certain words between their teeth. g The fecond of we had but four leagues to travel to G ok on da. We went immediately to the Lodging of a young Dutc rurgion, belonging to the King, whom the Skur Cbetenr, Envoy from w ^Book I. Travels in I aiiaim N D I Ai had left at Golconda upon the King^s earneft entreaty. The King was always very much troubl’d with the head-ach: For which reafon the Phylitians had or der’d that he fhould be let blood in four places under the tongue; but there was no perfon that would undertake to do it .* for the Natives of the Country un- derltand nothing of Chirurgery. Now before that Feter de Lan, for that was the D/tfe^Chirurgion’s name, was entertain’d in the King’s fervice,he was ask’d whether he could let blood / To which he anfwer’d, that there was nothing fo eafy in Chirurgery. Some few days after the King fent for him, and gave him to underftandthat he was refolv’d to be let blood the next day in four parts un der the tongue, as the Phyfitians had order’d, but he fhould take a care of not drawing away above eight ounces. De Lan returning the next day to Court, was lead into a Chamber by three Eunuchs* and four Old-women, who earn’d him to a Bath, and after they had undreft him, and wafh’d him, efpecially his hands; they anointed him with Aromatick-drugs , and inftead of his own £^0^-Clothes, they brought him a Robe according to the fafhion of the Countrey. After that* they brought him before the King j where he found four little Porringers of Gold, which the Phyfitians, who were prefent, had weigh’d* In fhort,he let the King blood under the tongue in four parts, and perform’d his bufmefs fo well,that when the blood came to be weigh’d,it weigh’d but bare eight ounces.! The King was fo fatisfi’d with the Operation, that he gave theChirur- gion three-hunder’d Pagods, which comes to almoft feven-hunder’d Crowns. The Young-Queen and the Queen-Mother undemanding what he had done,were refolv’d to be let-blood too. But I believe it was rather out of a curiofity to feethe Chirurgion, thanout of any neceffity which they had to be let-blood. * For he was a handfom young-man * and perhaps they^had never feen a Granger neer at hand,for at a diftence,it is no improbable thing,in regard the Women are fhut up m fuch places where they may fee, but not be feen. Upon this, de Lan was carri’dinto a Chamber where the fame Old-women that he had waited on him before he let the King blood, ftript up his arm,and wafh’d it,but more efpecially his hands; which when they were dry , they rubb’d again with fweet-Oils as before. That being done,a Curtain was drawn,and the Queen firetching out her arm through hole, was let-blood; as was the Queen-Mother afterwards in the fame manner. The Queen gave him fifty Pagods, and the Queen-Mother thirty, with fome pieces of Cloath of Gold. Two days after we went to wait upon the Klahab's Son, but were told we could not fpeak with him that day ; the next day receiving the fame anfwer, we were advertiz’d upon enquiry, that we might wait long enough in that manner j that he was a young Lord that never ftirr’d from the King ; or that if he did leave the Court, it was only to keep his Mifles company in his own Haram. The young Chirurgion feeing us fo delaid, offer’d to fpeak to the King’s firft Phy- fitian, who'was alfo of the King’s Council,and who had teflify’d a great affeUion toward the iW*m^-Envoy,and for himfelf; for which reafon be thought he might embrace an opportunity to do him a kindnefs. In fhort/e? Lan had no fooner fpoke to him, but he fent for us, and having,after much civilty fhewn us, inform’d himfelf of the caufe of our coming, he defir’d us to fiiew him our Pearls, which we did the next day. Aft^r |ie had view’d them, he made us feal , them up again in our own bags .* for all that is prefented to the King mull be leal d with the Merchants-Seal ^ and when the King has had a fight of the Com- modity, it is feal d up with his own Seal, to prevent any fraud. Thereupon we ert the Pearls, fo^ feald up, in his hands, who promis’d to fhew them to the hand ’ ^ t0 ^ Ve US 3 account tiie tru ^ we ^ P ut * nt0 The next day about nine of the Clock before noon we went to the River to ee how they wafh the King’s and the Great Noble-men’s Elephants. The Ele* pnant goes up to the belly in the water, and lying down upon one fide, with his junk he throws the water feveral times upon that fide which lies out of the ater; and when he has foak’d himfelf fufficiently, the Mailer comes with a filrF n 3 an d rubbing the Elephant’s-skin, cleanfes it from all the nthat clings to it. Here fome believe, that when this creature is once laid wn, it cannot rife of its felf 7 which is contrary to what I have feen. For when104 Traveh in India. Part H when the Mailer has well-cleans’d the one fide, he commands the Elephant m turn the other, which the bealt immediately does ^ and when both hdcs are ' wdl-walh’d, he comes out of the River, and flays a-while upright upon the bankdide to dry himfelf. Then comes the Mailer with a pot full of feme red or yellow colour, and llreaks the belt in the forehead, about the eyes, upon the brealt, and all behind, rubbing him afterwards with Oil of Coco no llrengthen the nerves ; and fome when all is done, he fallens a gilt-Plate upon their fore heads. The fifteenth, the chief Phifitian fent for us, and return’d us our bags again feal’d with the King’s Signet,wherewith his Majelty had feal’d them after he had look’d upon them. He demanded the price *, which we told him.- Whereupon an Eunuch that Hood by him, and wrote down every thing,wondring at the high- price of the Pearls, told us that we took the King of Golccmdah Courtiers for perfons that have neither knowledg nor judgment; and that he faw every day things of greater value brought to the King. I briskly retorted upon the Eunuch, that he was better skill’d in the price of a young Slave, than the value of a Jewel ,* and fo faying, we put up our Pearls} and return'd to our Lodg ing. The n ext day we fet out from Golconda for Surat, in which Road there is nothing confiderable but what I have already deferib’d, only this is to be re member’d, that we were not gone above five days journey from Golconda, but the King, who had not heard in two days after we were gone, what I had re torted upon the Eunuch, fent four or five Horfe-men after us with Orders, if they overtook us, to bring us back.- but in regard we were got one days journey into the Territories of the Mogul before one of the Horfe-men over took us, ('for the reft Itaid upon the Frontiers of the two Kingdoms; ) I, that k;new the humour of the Countrey very well, made anfwer for my felfand Companion,that at that time our buimefs would not permit us} and that there fore we begg’d in moll humble manner his Majelly’s pardon ^ and afterwards I made my Companion allow my reafons. Being arriv’d at Surat, Monficur do Jar din dy’d of* an overflowing of choleri And I made a full account to have gone to Jlgra to Sha-jehan who then reign’d. But at the fame inftant the Nahab, Sha-Eft-Kan, the King's Brother-in-Law, and Governor of the Province of Guzerat, fent one of the principal Officers of his Houfe to me from Jmadabat, to tell me he undrellood I had fome extraor dinary Jewels to fell -, for which reafon he would be glad to fee me, and that he would pay me as much for them as the King Ihould do. I receiv’d this Meflage while Sieur de Jardin lay lick, and the niftth day after his death I got to u 4 madabat,znd fpake with theAT ahab. Now in regard he was a man that underllood Jewels perfectly well, we prefently came to an agreement.- fo that We had no difpute together, but about the quality of the Coin to be paid. He allow’d me two forts to choofe, Roupies of Gold, or Roupie§ of Silver.- but the Prince feeming to intimate to me that he Ihould not be well-pleas’d to let fuch a Sum in Silver to be feen to go out of his Houfe, he wijh’d I would rather accept my payment in Roupies of Gold, that made 5 ' not fuch a great heap. I contented to his, defire ; and he fliew’d me very fair Gold, and many Roupies, that had not teen the Sim in a long time. But in regard the price currant of a Roupy of Gold, is not above fourteen Roupies eff Silver,and for that he would have had me taken my Roupies at fourteen and a half, or at lead: for fourteen and a quarter, it had like to have fpoil’d our bargain; for 1 gave him to underfland, that in fo large a fum, it would not quit coft to lofe a fourth partin every Roupy of Gold. At length to pleate him, I was forc’d to take the Gold at fourteen Roupies of Silver and an eighth part. Thus a Prince t other wife magnificent and generous, yet in matter of buying and felling, woulds needs approve himtelf to be a good Husband. While I flay’d at dabat, he tent me every day to my Lodging four Silver Plates of Pilaw, and other excellent Dyetand one day that the King had tent him as many Appl es as ten or twelve men could carry, he fent me as manyaS for their rarity at Mmadabat, were worth three or four hundred Roupies. Belides all this, gave me a compleat Habit of Honour, with a Sword and a Cangiar, won i ^ thou fund Roupies; andrefolving alio to give me a Horte, he ask’d nie vwn The End of the Fir ft Bool\. Travels in In d i a kind of one I would have. I told him, lince he was pleas’d to give me my choice, that I rather delir’da young lively Horfe, rather than an old one. Thereupon he fent me one that was fo given to bounding and prancing, that he threw a young Hollander out of the Saddle; but upon my delire to have him chang’d,hefent me another, which 1 fold afterwards for four hundred Roupies. From Amadabat I return’d to Surat ^ from Surat I travefd again to G ok on da ^ and thence to the Mine to buy Diamonds. From whence returning back for Su- rat, l refolv’d for Terfia. B Eing upon my return to Surat from the Diamond Mine, I uiiderftood that the War was proclaim’d between the Englifij and the Hollanders, and the lat ter would fend no more Ships into Perjia. The English alfo gave out the fame re- folutions; for indeed they had fent four Ships into Pcrfia, which they expe&amp;ed back every hour. While I was thus in fear of ftaying long in a place where I had no bulinefs, there arriv’d at Surat five great Dutch Ships from Batavia ^ three of which being rather Men of War, than Merchant-Men, were order’d to be un* laden with all fpeed, with an intention to look out for the four Engliffli Vefiels that were expected out of Perfia. The other two were appointed to follow two or three days after, being in that time to take in provifions for the whole Fleet In one of thofe two Veflels I embark’d, and fetting fayl the eighth of January, we came before Diu the twelfth, where we overtook the other three Ships. There it was debated at a Council of War,what courfe to (leer to meet thei^** ll\h ; and it was refolv’d,that we Ihould fteer away for Sc'wdi, where we arriv’d the twentieth of the fame month, and ftay’d there till the twenty-eighth, and then fetting fail with a fair wind, we landed at Gomromths feventh of March.

But though Cha-jehan endeavour’d to give equal content to his four Sons, their Ambition was not fatisfl’d with thisdi- vilion, but ruin'd all the good deligns which fo kind a Father had lay’d to pre* ferve peace among his Children. Cha-jehan being thus lick, and retir’d into the Womens quarter, without fhewing himfelf for many days ; the report ran that lie was dead, and that Dara-Cha conceal’d his death, to gain time to provide for himfelf, and to fe- cure the Empire. True it is, that the King believing he fhould dye, commanded Dara-Cha to call together all the Omrahs or Lords, and to feat himfelf upon the Throne, which belong’d to him, as the eldeft of his Brothers^ He alfo teift- fi’d the defire he had to fee him quietly fettled in the peaceable pofTeflion of the Empire. And this intention of his was look’d upon as the more juft, in re gard the other three Brothers had been for fome time obferv’d to have lefs refped for their Father, than Dara-Cha. Dara-Cha, who honour’d andrefpett- ed the King with a real tendernefs, made anfwer to the King, that he defir’d of Heaven nothing more than the prefervation of his Ma jellies life, and that fo long as Heaven Ihould continue that prefervation, he Ihould take it to be a greater honour to continue himfelf a Subject, than to afeend the Throne. And indeed he was never abfent from his Father, that he might be the better able to ferve him in his lickhefs ; and becaufe he would be prefent upon all occa- ' : ' lions,Book Ik Travels in I n d i a. lions, he lay by his Fathers Bed-fide, upon a Tapeflry fpread upon the ground.

Morat- Eakc-he the youngeil, who had the Government of Guzerat, fent away Forces immediately to befiege Surat 7 the moil conliderable Port,. and moll frequented of any other all over India. The City made no refinance, for the Walls are very weak, and broken down in feveral places. But they defended the Citta- del, where the Treafure was, veryftoutly; though the young Ambitious Prince did all he could to make himfelf Mafter of it. Chabas-Kan, one of his Eu- niichs, who was General of his Army, an induflrious and adive perfon^ and who carri’d on the Siege with all the experience of an old Captain \ when he faw he could not carry the Caftle by main force, caus’d it to be undermin’d in two places, by the afliftance of an European Engineer, which took effed ; fo that upon the twenty-ninth of December, 1559, he threw down ag-ood part of the Walls, and fill’d up the Moat; which, very much terrifi’d -the befieg’d. But they prefently recover’d their courage, and though they were but a fmall num ber, they defended themfelves for above forty days, to the great Dammage and (laughter of Morat-Bakche's Army. Cbabas-Kan, provok’d at fuch a vigorous refiftance, fought for all the Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred of the Canoneers that were within the Caftle, to place them at the head of his men, when they made their approaches. He alfo fent one of the Brothers of the Governour of the place, to offer him advantageous conditions. But the Gover nor, being a very loyal perfon, and uncertain of the Kings death, rejeded all his offers. The Eunuch perceiving the Refolutipn of the Governour, threaten’d the befieged to kill all their Wives and Children, Parents and Kindred, if they did not furrender the place the next day. But neither did any of thofe confi- derations prevail, till at length the breach being made wider, and the number of defandants decreafing, the Governor furrender’d upon honourably conditions 5 which were pundually perform’d by C babas-Kan, who feiz’d upon all the Trea fure, and carried it to Klmadabatj where Adorat-Bakche was bufily employ’d in iqueezing the people to get Money. The news of the taking Surat being brought to this Prince, he prefently provided himfelf a Throne, and fitting upon it on the day which was appointed for the Ceremony, he caus’d himfelf to be declared King, not only of Guz.e- m, but of all the Dominions of Cha-jehan his Father. At the fame time he alfo coin’d Money, and fent Governors into all the Cities. But his tottering Throne, not being well fix’d, fell foon to the Ground; and the youngefl of all the Brothers, for having ufurp’d a Scepter that no ways appertain’d to him, was confin’d to a fevere imprifonment. Prince Dara-Cha fain would have re^ Lev d Surat ; but it was impoffible. For befides that he was bulled in the affiftance of his Father the King, his fecond Brother SHitan-Sujab, more powerful than Morat-Bakche, found him far more work to do. He was already advanc’d into the Kingdom of Labor, having abfolutely reduc’d the Kingdom of Bengala. All that Dara-Cha could do, was to fend Soliman Cbecour his eldell Son, with an Army againfl Sultan Sujab. The young Prince having defeated his Uncle, and driven him back into Bengala, the Frontiers whereof he fecur’d with good Gar- nions return’d to Dara-Cha his Father. In the mean time Morat-Bakcbe, ac- nowledg’d for King in the Kingdom of Gazer at, bends all his Force and Coun sels to make himfelf Emperor of the/W/Tr, to deEroy his Brothers, and to x his Throne either in Agra or Jebanabat Whiles thefe things pafs’d, Aureng-zeb as ambitious, but more crafty than is Brothers, lets them alone to kindle the firft Fires; and conceals his own eugns which afterwards appear’d fo much to the damage of the reft. At rit he feign’d to lay no claim to the Empire, but liv’d a private life, like a emd?, or Religious Hermit. And the better to act his part, he declar’d to is younger Brother Morat-Bakcbe, whom he faw to be fb ambitious, how unng he fhould be to afiiit him in his defigns; telling him, that becaufe he ented the Empire by his Valour, he would aid him with his Money and his orces to overthrow Dara-Cha, who only Hood in his way.

And prefently all the Grandees of the Kingdom fet theinfelv execute the Kings Will and Teftament, acknowledging Sulm/ BonUbi for peror, who was very young. That Prince had two Coulin-Germans who w both of them by the Kings confent turn’d Chriltians, and made publick ^ feffion thereof. Thofe two young Princes, being very apprehenfive percePa that J/ouf-Kax, Father-in-Law to Cha-jeha^ and Father of Cha-Efl-Kwl ? no good intentions toward the young King, and gave him notice of it - IkK coft them their lives, and the King the lofs of his Dominions. For the y King, having no more wit than was agreeable to his age, openly declarMr^ jifwf-Km what his Coulins had reveal’d to him in private, and ask’d the C neral whether it were true, that he had a delign to fet up his Uncle aaa' him or no. j 4 fauf-K*n immediately gccus’d the Reporters of faliity and i- pudence, and protefled his fidelity his King, and vow’d, to fpend the laff drop of his blood to preferve him in the pofi'effion of the Empire. Howev 1 feeing his Confpiracy difcoverM, he refolv J d to prevent the punilhment • to which end having got tiie two Princes into his polTeflion, he put them both to death. But before that, in regard of his power in the Army and in the Empire, he had already brought over to Cka-jeham party the greateft part of the Commanders and Lords of the Court} and the better to play his 1 game and deceive the young King, he rais’d a report that Cha-jehan was dead 6 ancf becaufe he had defir’d to be buried near his Father Gehan-guir, the body was to be brought to Jlgra. This Stratagem being cunningly manag’d, J/onf-Km himfelf gave advice of the feign’d death to the King } telling the King withal! that it would be but a common civility for him to go and meet the Corps when it came within a League or two of the City, being an Honour due to a Prince of the Blood of the Moguls. All this while Cha-jehan kept himfelfi», cogmto.^ till coming within fight of the Army that lay about Agra, he caus’d himfelf to be put into a Coffin, wherein there was only a hole left for him to breath at. This Coffin being carri’d under a moving Tent,all the principal Officers who were of the plot with Afonf-Kan, came to perform the ufual Ceremonies of State to the Body of the deceasd Prince, w 7 hile the young King wssupon the way to meet the body. But then Afmf-Kan finding it feafonably to exe cute his deflgn, caus’d the Coffin to be open’d, and Cha-jehan rifing up, and ffiewimghimfelf to the eyes of all the Army, was faluted Emperor by all the Generals and other principal ^Officers, who had their Cue ready } fo that the iiame of Cha-jehan running in a moment from one mans mouth to another, the Acclamation became publick, and the Empire was fetled upon him. The young King hearing the news by the way, was fo furpriz’d, that he thought of no-r ching but how to fave himfelf by flight, being upon a fudden forfaken by all ’ his followers. * And Cha-jehan not believing it any way neceffary to purfuehira, fuffer’d him to wander a long time in Mia like a FA&lt;ir. ^STTength he retir’d into Perfia, where he was magnificently receiv’d by Cha-Sefi, who allow’d him a penhon fit for fo great a Prince, which he ftill enjoys. Cha-jehan having thus ufnrp’d the Crown, the better to fecure himfelf, and to Rifle all Factions that might arife during the life of the lawful Prince, whom he had fo unjuilly defpoil d of his right, by degrees &lt;fcut to death all thofe that had fhew n any kindnefs to his Nephew. So that the firffc part of his Reign was noted for many ads of cruelty, that blemifb’d his Reputation. No lefs unfortunate was the end of his Reign. For as he had unjuffly depriv'd the iawfiil fleir*, of the Empire which belong’d to him } he was himfelf, while he yet liv’d, depri.v d of his Crown by Aureng-z,eb his own Son, who kept him ;Prifoner in the Fortrefs of Agra. For after Dara-Chahzd loft the Battel aga infl his two Brothers, and Morat-Bakche in the Plain of Samongitir^ and was treacheroufly abandoned by the •principal Officers of the Army, he retir’d into the Kingdom of with all,the Treafure which the confulion of his affairs would fiiffer him to get together.^ ' ' S ■' • theTravel? in India the King to refill: the violence of his vidorious Soas, fhut himfelf up in the CaHle of Jgr#yto the end he might not be furprizM, but have time and leifure to obferve how far the infolence of his Children would tranfport them. As for 'Jhireng^eb, who had Morat Bakcbz fafe enough, he enters Agra^ feigning to believe a report that Chajehan was dead, that he might have liberty to get into the Fortrefs, where he faid one of the Omrds would make it out. The more he reported the death of Cha-jehan, the more did the King endeavour to let the people know he was alive. But finding both Power and Fortune had taken Jureng-zebh party ^ and being alfo in great neceflity for want of water, he Tent Fazd'Kan, grand Mailer of his Houfhold, to ahhre his Son that he was alive ^ and withal to tell him that it was the King’s command, that he fhould retire to his vice-Roy-lhip in Decan, without putting him to any more vexation, and that upon his obedience, he would forgive whatever had pafh Aurcngaicbfivm in his refolution, return’d for anfwer to Fazel-Kan^ that he was certain thapthe King, his Father was dead, and that upon that account he had only taken Arms to fe- cure the Crown to himfelf, which he thought he deferv’d, as well as the reft of his Brothers. That if his Father were living, he had too great a refpect for him to undertake the leaft enterprize that fhould difpleafe him ^ and therefore f hat he might be certain he was not dead, he defir’d to fee him, and to kifs his feet; and having fo done, he would retire to his Government, and punctually obey his Commands. Fazcl-Kan return’d this anfwer to the King, who declared that he I fhould be glad to fee his Son, and fent back Fazel-Kan, to tell him he fhould be welcome. But Aareng-zeb more cunning than Cha-jehan, allur’d Fazel-Kap that he would not fet his foot in the Caftle, till the Garrifon that was in, it fhould be lent away to make room for his men. For the Prince was afraid,and not without reafon, if he ihould adventure into a Fortrefs where he was not abfolute Maftef himfelf, left they fhould feize his perfon, of which the King being apprehenlive, confented to his propofal, not being able to do better at that time. Thereupon tne Garrifon which belong’d to Cha-jehan was Tent out of the Caftle, and another of Jareng-wh's enter’d, commanded by Saltan Mahomet the eldeft of his Sons, to whom he gave order to fecure his Father’s perfon. When they were thus got in, and his Father fafe,he delaid feeing his Father from day to day,waiting (as he gave out for excufe) a kind opportunity for the enteryiew , and pretending his Ahrologers did not prefently think it feafonable, he retir’d into the Countrey,to a Houfe about two or three leagues from Agra, which very much difpleafed the people, who waited every day for the fortunate hour, from which they expefted a conclufion ot their miferies by the Father and Son’s difcourfe together. But Ameng^eb, who was in no great haft to fee his Father, took up another refolu tion, which was to feize upon all his Fathers treafure, which Dara-Sha had not time to carry away. He alfo fhut up in the fame Fortrefs Begum-Sahebhxs Sifter, to keep the King company, by whom fhe was entirely belov’d: and took into his own hands all the wealth Ihe had got, by her Father’s liberality. Cha-jehan enrag’d to fee himfelf us’d in that manner by his own Son, made an. attempt to efcape, and kill’d fome of the Guards that oppos’d him; which cans d Aareng-zeb more ftriClly to confine him. In the mean time it was a won- ^riiil thing tp fee that not one of ,the Servants of fo great a King fo much as 0 ei ^ t0 help him; that alibis SuhjeCts fhould forfake him, and turn their eyes apon the riling Sun; acknowledging only Aureng-zeb for King,while they feem’d 0 we forgotten Cha-jehan, though ftill alive. Thus this great Monarch fadly ended his days in Prifon, and dy’d in the Fortrefs of A?ra in the year 1666 the laft time that I was in India.

For Gion-Kan having a defign to feize Sepper^Shekoar^ Dara-cba’s fecond Son,the young Prince, though but a Youth, made a bold reliftance, and with his Bow and Arrows laid three men upon the ground , but not being able to refill a multitude,he was at length taken. Dara-tha waken’d with the noife, faw before his eyes his Son, whom they were leading toward him, with his hands ty’d behind him. Then the . nuferable Father of the young Prince, no longeraffidoubting the horrid treafon of Gion-Khn^ could not refrain from letting fall in his pallion thofe expreflions. Fimfh) faid he, ingrateful and infamous Villain as thou an^finijh the work^thou haft begun \ we are become Victims to bad fortune^ and Aureng-zebV unjuft -Ambition. But remember that I only deferve death for having fav d thy life : for never Prince of the Royal Blood had his hands ty d behind him before. Gion-Kan in fome mea- fure mov’d at thefe words, caus’d the little Prince to be unbound, and only fet guards upon Dara~cha and his Son. At the fame time he alfo fent exprefles to Raja Jeffomfeing, and to Abdulla-Kan^ to give them advice that he had feiz’d up on Dara-cha and his Train. Thereupon they made hall to lhare in the Ipoils’ of that poor Prince. But they could not be fo fwift, but that Gion-Kan had feiz’d upon all that Dara-cha had of moll precious in the World } ufing as inhumanly both his Wives and his Children. The Raja and Abdulla being ar riv’d,provided Elephants for the Prince, his Son,and his Wives,and card’d them away immediately to Jehanabat ; the people crowded to behold them, every one being defirous to fee the Prince whom they fo earneltly defir’d to have had for their King. Aureng-zeb caus’d them to be Ihewn in all the Streets and Market-places of Jehanabat, thgt no man might quellion hereafter their being taken; and as if he had glori’d in his treachery toward his Brother, he prefently condemn’d and font him away to the Caltle of AJfer. But of all that crowded to behold, not one would llir to affill or fuccour their lawful Prince. Only fome few generous Souldiers who had ferv’d him, and had receiv’d fome kindnefles from him,feeing themfelves not able to deliver their Prince, yet defirous to fhewhim fome proofs of their acknowledgment, fell with all their fury upon the Traitor Gion-Kan^who though he were refcu’d from them at that time, yet foon after met with the re ward due to his crime; for he was kill’d as he was crofling a Wood in his return' home. . In the mean time Aureng-z-ebjlikz a good Polititian,and an extraordinary Dif- fombler, gave it out, that it was by no order of his that Dara-cha was feiz’djon- ly he defir’d him to retire out of the Kingdom, which he refufing to do fiion-Kan, unknown to him, had unworthily feiz’d his perfon ; and without refped to the Koyai-Blood, had fhamefally ty’d the hands of the young Sepper-Shehour behind mm .* which being a crime and an indignity done to his Majelly,had beenpunilh’d by the death of Gion-Kan and his accomplices. But this was only publllh’d to abufe the people; for had it been true^ureng-zeb would never have given order 10 ^ve his brother’s head cut off.n6 Travels in I n d i a. Part II. For Dara^Cha being Tent from Jehanabat with a Guard to the place fu- imprifonment; when he came to a fair place where he thought to repnfeV felf, they drefs’d up the Tent where he was to leave his Head. After he S eaten, Seif+Kan came and brought him the fentence of his Death. Larin feeing him enter, told him he was very welcome, and that he was glad to f one of his molt faithful Servants.

In the mean time Sepper-Chekour was taken from him * and while they held him in a tf ory, a Slave took off Lara-Chah Head ' which was carried to Attreng-wb by Seif-Km?. This bloody Tragedy being thus atted, Sepper-Chekpur was fent to the Caftle Couakor^ to keep his Uncle Morat-Bakche company.

A S it is the cuftom at the performance of that Ceremony, for the new King Ky to feat himfelf upon the Throne 5 there was not much time requir’d to prepare one, in regard that Cha-jehan before his Imprifonment had finifh’d that which the Great Tamerlane had begun j which was the richeft and moil magni ficent that ever was feen. But as the Grand Cadi of the Empire, and Chief of the Law was to Proclaim the new King, Aureng-wb found himfelf oppos’d by him. For the Cadi told him, that the Law of Mahomet and the Law of Na ture equally forbad him to declare him King, while his Father liv’d; befides, that he had put his elder Brother to death, to whom the Empire belong’d af ter the death of Cha-jehan their Father. This flout refinance of the CM’did not a little perplex Aureng-zeb ; and therefore that he might not feem to ap pear irreligious, he call’d all the Doctors of the Law together, to whom he reprefented the incapacity of his Father to govern,through Age and many infir mities, that troubled him ; as for Dara-Ch^ his Brother,he had put him to death becaufe he was a (lighter of the Law, drank Wine, and favour’d Infidels. Thofe reafons, intermix’d with threats, caus’d his Council of Confcience to conclude, that he deferv’d the Empire, and ought to be proclaim’d King; though the Cadi obflinately perfifled in his firfl refolution. There was no other Remedy therefore, but to remove him from his Employment, as a diflurber of the publick Peace, and to chufe another for the Honour of the Law, and • the Good of the Kingdom. The pcrfbn who was elected by the Council was foon con firm’d by Aureng-zeb ; in acknowledgment whereof, he proclaim’d him King the twentieth of October 0 1 660, This Proclamation being made in the Afofwee, Anreng-zeb feated himfelf upon the Throne, and receiv’d the Homages of all the Grandees of the Kingdom. However, Aureng-zeb did not think his throne fall enough, nor himfelf fc* cure in the Empire, fo long as Sultan Sujah was railing a powerful Army in Bengala to releafe his Father. Thereupon he fent a confiderable Force again# him, under the Command of Sultan Mahomed his eldell Son; to whom he ap pointed for his Lieutenant the Emir-Jemla^ one of the greatell Captains that ever came out of Per fa into India. His great Conduct and Courage had ten ur’d him a perfon to be reverenc’d by all pofterity, had he been faithful to•Tv' Book II. Travels in India*. the Princes whom he ferv’d. But firft he betray’d the King of Gokonda, un der whom he advanc’d his Fortune^ and next to him Cha-jchan; under whofe protection he rofe fo high, that there was not a Nobleman in all India mor# powerful or richer than he. Otherwife he is both belov’d and fear’d by the Soldiers, and perfectly underflands the Art of War, according to the cuftom of the Country. The two Armies engaging feveral times, the Vidory fome- times on the one lide, and fometimes. on the other } fo that Snit an Mahomed finding it likely to be a tedious War, aflifted by the Counfels of his Lieute nant, refolv’d to add policy to flrength. Thereupon he treats underhand with the Officers of his Uncle’s Army, makes them magnificent promifes, and fo ear- neftly folicites them to come oyer to j 4 nreng-z,eb\ party, whom he call’d the Pillar and ProteCtor of Mahomet's Law, that he gain’d the principal, to whom he fent confiderable Prefents, to confirm them in their refolutions. This was a mortal blow to Sultan-S ^/?,agiainfi: which he could not provide. For they that adhear’d to him being a mercenary generation,that ferves whoever gives molt finding they had little more to exped from a Prince whofe Exchequer was empty, refolv’d to^ drive a Trade with Anreng-iLtb, who was Mailer of all the Treafure in the Kingdom. And thus did Aureng-wb debauch the Army of his Brother, who in the lall Battel, feeing himfelf abondon’d by all his Soldiers was forc’d to fave himfelf by flight, with his Wives and Children. The Tray’ tors affiam’d of their treachery, did not fo fmartlypurfue the unfortunate Prince as they might have done, but prefently fell to plund 5 ring his Tents and Bag gage } which Emir-Jemla, fuffer’d them to do, in recompence of their Trea- fon.

However at length he began to be jealous, lell Heaven Ihould infpire his own hon to revenge the crimes which he had committed. And upon this, receiving intelligence, that Sultan Mahomed began to be very penfive and melancholy* he then abfolutely believ’d that his Son was praftifing mifchief againll him; tor the better difcovery whereof, he wrote to Emir-Jemla. But the Tetter un happily mifcarrying, was taken by Sultan Mahomeds Guards, and giv’n to the young Prince } who being a perfon of a quick apprehenfion, conceal’d the tu nnels trom EmrJJemla^ and fearing left he fhould receive other Orders more v t0 n 1 away his life ’ he t0 P a ^ s the Ganges and throw himfelf P°n his Uncle Sultan-Sujah ; from whom he expeded more mercy than from is gather.

Th made a vigorous onfet, and kill’d a great number of men. But when they fb I the whole Army had taken the Alarum, they contented themfelves with rtf mifchief they had done, and repafs’d.the Ganges^ for fear of being furround d by number. ea Emir-Jemla had already given intelligence to Mreng^eb of the Flight of h' Son * which fenfibly griev’d the Father, though he durft not fhew his aneef for fear of incenfing the Emir to betray him, as he had betray’d his Father Thereupon he cunningly wrote to him, that he rely’d altogether upon his pm dence and policy to retrieve his Son to his duty $ that he was young, and that what he had done, was only out of his heat of youth, and the inconftancy inch dent to his years. The confidence which j 4 ureng-z.eb feem’d to put in £^ir- JemU incited the General to ufe all his endeavours to get Mahomed out of Sultan Sujatis hands* Thereupon he gave the young Prince to underhand his Fathers good intentions toward him, and that he was ready to receive him with open Arms,fo that he would but make good ufe of his Refidence with Sultan Sujahy which he might pretend was done for the advantage to his Father,and for which his Father would have rather caufe to extol his Prudence and affe&amp;ion than otherwife. The young Prince eafily fuffer’d himfelf to be perfwaded and the fame way he went to his Uncle’s, the fame way he return’d to his Fathers Camp 5 where Emir-JemU receiv’d him honourably, and with all the demon- flrations of joy. He advis’d him alfo, so tell his Father when he faw him, that he did not go over to Sultan Sujah y but only with a defign to obferve what Forces he had, and the Difcipline of his Army $ and that he intended to have fpeedily return’d, and to have given him an account of what he had done for his fervice. Prefently Orders came from Aureng-wby that his Son fhould befent to him \ fo that Mahomed^ whether by conftraint, or willingly, fetfor ward for Jehanabat, attended by the Guards which Emir~ Jemla, had appointed. The King having notice of his arrival, his Majelty order’d him a Lodging with out the Palace, and would not permit him to kifs his hands 7 pretending he was not well. ^ All this while Soliman Chekour, after he had been betray’d by the Raja Roup, had continu’d under the protection of NaEH-Ram in the Province of Sennagm. This Prince, as ffcout as he was unfortunate, was conftrain’d to lead a Savage life among the Mountains, for fear of falling into the hands of Aureng-ub, nor could he with all his Forces do him any harm in that place. Befide NaUh Rani had afitir’d him with an Oath, accompany’d with all the Ceremonies that could make it Ibletnn, and invioable ; that he would rather lofe his Territo^j then that Aureng-zeb fhould do the leaft violence to that protedion Which he afforded him. This was done upon the Banks of a River, which palfes through his Country, where he walk’d his body, in token of the purity of bis Soul ; hnd being thus purify’d in the Water, he made his proteftations to Soli- wan+Chekour, nevir .to forfake him, taking his Gods to Witnefs of thefmce- rity of his intentions. Upon this, Solman-Chekour never took any farther care, but every day went to divertife himfelf with hunting. While he gives up himfelf to his pleafure, Aureng-zeb marches his Army toward the Mountains, thinking to force NaSH-Rani to furrender Soliman-Chekour into his power. But the Raja with a thoufand men bekg able to defend the Avenues of his Country againft a hundred thoufand, Aureng~z.eb finding he could do no good, that way, has recouffe to policy. He undertakes at firft to treat with the Raj** but in vain, for the Raja would not violate his Oath ; and his Priefb aflur’a him befides, that Aureng-zeb fhould er’e long be depos’d, and that Soliman Chekpnr fherald Reign in his room. Aureng-zsb thus prevented, refalTes to make another kind of War upon faitn. Thereupon he forbids all commerce between his and the Raja's Subje&amp;s; which was very prejudicial to the latter. This caus’d the people to murmur at me prote&amp;ion which he had given to SoBmun-Chekour \ and at length they publicKiy cry’d out, that it was to the prejudice of the Publick. Their Priefts alfo, tnus alaiha’d, began to doubt the truth of their Oracles, and to think it convemen^Travels in to put anoth er int erpretation upon them. But the main thing was,that the RdU Jefomfeing who had betraid Dara-Cha,wrote privately to Nach-Rmi that it was for the lafety of his Perfon and Dominions,to fubmit to ; ’and to fur- render his kinfmaii up into his hands. T his advice of JejJbmfeinjr put j-uui to a verv great plunge j dreading on the one fide the breach of his oath; on the other the revolt of his people. Uncertain what cotirfe to take, he confults the BrZ mw, who gave their opinions that it was his duty rather to preferve his People and his Laws, which would be both deflroid, Ihould they fall into the hands of Jureng-zLek than to keep his Faith with a Prince from whom he could never ex-&gt; pea any advantage. Thefe confultatiOns being kept private from Solmav Che- ftwr, his ruine was concluded upon,while he thought himfelf molt fecure.There upon Natti-Raw, with a Salvo,as he thought, to his Honour and his Confcience return’d for anfwer to Jejfomfern*,that he could not confent to betray the Prince- but that Anreng-^eh might take his opportunity to feize his perfon,yet preferve his reputation too in regard that Solman Chekour was wont to go a Hunting up on certain Mountains in his Countrey with a fniall retinue, and that it would be an eafy thing for him to fend a number of Souldiers fufficient to apprehend him. So foon as Jejfomfewg had receiv’d this anfwer,he gave order to his Son to fee the bulinefs effected as the plot was laid. So that Soliman Chck^nr one day going a Hunting to the ufual place, was fnapt by a ftrong party that lay in Ambufcade. The Prince prefently apprehended the treafon,and defended himfelf with the af- iiltance of his Attendants, who were all flain } he himfelf flew nine, but at length over-number’d, was taken and carri’d to Jehanabat. When he came into Aureng-wb's prefence, the King ask’d him how he did ? As well as a Prifoner of yours can do,laid he, who experts no better ufage from you, than his Father re ceiv’d before. The King bid him not be afraid,that he had no defign to put him to death, but only to fecure his perfon. Aureng-z^eb after that, demanding of him what was become of all the Treafure which he had carri’d away, the Prince made anfwer that he had fpent a great part in raifing Souldiers againft him to have rain’d him,if it had been his good fortune That a good part was in the hands of Roup, whofe avarice and perfidioufnefs was fufficiently known. And that Natti-Ram bad got the remainder to deliver him to his enemies,to the prejudice oi his word and honour. Amreng-z.eb v/as furpriz’d and touch’d at the boldnefs of his Nephew } but ambition fhutting his eyes, and itifling all thoughts of jufhee,which the juft remorce of Confcience might excite within him,he gave or- oer that Saltan Mahomet his Son,and Soliman Chekonr his Nephew fhould both be committed to the Fort of Gokaleor to keep Morat-Bak-che company, w T hich was done the $oth of Jan. \66\. ' ' Saltan Sajah, who was yet alive, but flill miferablv, was the laffc thorn in Aarcng-ubh foot} and the perfon that drew it out for him, and rid him of his iaibpain, was the King of Arakan, whither the unfortunate Prince was at length xorcM to retire. Who finding all his hopes to be loft, began to think of a Pilgri mage to Mecca, and from thence to go into Rerfia, and implore a Sanrtuary un- r miP rote( ^ on that Pr i n rt. To this purpofe he thought he might obtain a Veilel from the King of Arakan, or the King of Vega, to carry him to Mecca z Kit ne was ignorant that neither of thofe Kings had any Vefiels,that would live in tne mam Ocean. So that he was conftrain’d to ftay with the King of Araka^an iaoiater, whofe Daughter he defir’d in Marriage,which the King granted, and by &gt;- a w ^tch ought to have been the greateft occafion of • l ? ^ el:ween t: ^ e Son-in-law and the Father-in-law,was the greateft realbn eir hatred and falling-out. For fome Lords of the Country, who began to ^ jea ous of Sultan Sajah, buzz’d the King of Arabian in the ear, as if he had an ^ enuon by vertue of his Marriage, to difpofiefs him of his Throne,and to leave thp? c S ^ C ? n ’ ^ a &amp; an ea ltly believ’d what they faid.

But feme time after, the King having a deiir T • marry the eldeft Sifter of Sultan Bangue^ they had a little more liberty alWd them. However they enjoy’d it not long, for the young Prince being of a tur bulent and ambitious fpirit, plotted new treafons againft the King, which being difcover’d, the King immediately caus’d the whole Family to be put to death not fparing the young Princefs his Wife, though Ihe were big with Child. 5 1 As for Sultan Snjahjnho was formoft among thofe that fled,it is moregenerallv thought that either he was flain by the Souldiers who were fent to apprehend him, or that he was torn in pieces by the Tigers and Lions; of which thofe For- refts are full. CHAP. VII. Of the beginning &lt;?/ Aureng zebV Reign, and the Death of Cha-jekn his Father. S Ome days before he afeended the Throne, he fent to his Father to fend him fome of his Jewels, to the end he might appear before his people with the fame magnificence as his Predeceflbrs had done. Cha-jehan taking this requeft of his Sons for an affront put upon him in Prifon,fell into fuch a rage that he con tinu’d mad for fome day es,and had like to have dy’d upon it. In the excefs of his vexation he call’d feveral times for a Morter and a Peftle,threatning to beat all his v Jewels to powder before his Son fhould have them. But Begum-Saheb, his eldeft Daughter,never forfook him,thro wing her felf at his feet,and by vertueofthat criminal power which file had over him, as being both his Daughter and his Wife, kept him from ufing that extremity; more out of a defign to prefervethe Jewels for her felf, than for her Brother, to whom fhe had always been a mortal enemy. For this reafbn, when Aureng-z.eb afeended the Throne,he had no more than one Jewel upon his Bonnet .* This Bonnet cannot be call’d a Crown; and by confequence neither can the Ceremony be call’d a Coronation. At the time that Aureng-z^eb took pofleflion of the Throne, he would not eat any wheaten-bread,nor meat, nor fifh,but fed upon bafley-bread,herbs andfweet- meats, which was a kind of Penance that he impofs’d upon himfelf for fo many crimes. When Aureng-zeb was fettled in the Empire,,feveral Embaffadorscame to Jeba- . : mbat to congratulate him, on the behalf of the Kings their Mailers, as from the King of the Vsbeck Tartars&gt; the Seriff of Mecca^ the Prince of Balfara, 2nd the Kings of Arabia Felixynnd Ethiopia.

Some, months before the death of Cha-jehan Aureng-zeb fent an EmbafTador into Perfia,who was magnificently receiv’d.

How dares he, purfu’d the King, take upon him the arrogant Title of ALem-gwr ufarewJha, or King of all the W odd, who never conquer’d any thing,but polfefies al he has by treachery and parricide? Haft thou been one of thofe that counfell’d him to fhed fo much blood, to be the Executioner of his Brothers,and to keep his Father in Prifon ? Thou art not worthy to wear a Beard } and with that immediately caus’d it to be fhav’d off; which is the greateft indignity that can be put upon a man in that Countrey. Shortly after he commanded the Emballador to return home, fending along with him for a Prefent to Aareng-z,eb^ an hunder’d and fifty beautiful Horfes, with a great quantity of Gold and Silver-Carpets, Cloath of Gold, rich Shafhes, and other Stuffs,to a vaft value. When Baybec-kan was conte back to v^pvzjwhere the King was Aareng~z.eb incens’d at the affront which the the Soyhi of Perfia had giv’n him in the perfon of his Emballador, he took the Horfes and fent fome of them into the great others to the corners of the Streets,caufing it to be proclaim’d that the followers of Haly could not ride thole Horfes without being Nigss, that is to fay, unclean, as coming from a King that did not obey the true Law. After that he caus’d the Horfes to be kilFd,and all the reft of the Prefent to be burnt; uttering many reproachful words againft the King oi Perfia, with whom he was mortally offended. At length happ’ning to dye toward the end of the year 1666. Anreng-z.eb found himfelf rid of an objefb that every hour reproach’d his Tyran- 5 and began to in joy himfelf with more delight. Soon after he receiv’d his Sheer BeguMrSaheb into favour,reftoring to her all her Governments,and giving her the Name of Cha-Begum, that is to lay, Pilicefs Queen.

The Prefents confifts of Jewels, Tifliies, Carpetts. and other Stuffs; befides Camels, Elephants, Horfes, and indeed any thing that is rare and of value. ’Tis faid he receives that day thirty Millions of Livres. They begin to prepare for this Feaft the feventh ot September, about two Months before it begins. The firft thing they do, is to cover the two great Courts overhead, from the middle of each Court to the Hall, which is open upon three iides. The Pavilions that cover thefe two void places, are of Pur ple Velve^ Embroider’d with Gold,and fo weighty, that the Polls which fuftain them are as big as the Maft of a Ship} fome thirty, fome forty foot high. There are thirty-eight of thefe Polls to uphold the Tent in the firll Court; and thofe next the Hall, are plated with Gold as thick as a Ducket. The relt are plated with Silver of the fame thicknefs. The Cords are of Cotton of divers colours; fome of them as big as a good Cable. The firll Court is furrounded with Portico’s and little Chambers, where the CWA keep Guard For every eight days the Omrahs relieve the Guard ; and during thofe eight days, the Qmrah who is upon the Guard, has a Difh of Meat out of the Kings Kitchin. When he fees it coming afar off, he makes three obeyfances, laying his hand three times upon the Ground, and three times upon his Head, crying out at the fame time, God preferve the Kings health, give him long Life and Vi&amp;ory over his Enemies. They take it for a great Honour to Guard the King \ and when they go upon the Guard, they put on all their moll fumptuous Apparel; and their Horfes, Camels, and Elephants are all richly adorn’d. Some of the Camels carry a fmall Piece of Ordnance, with a man behind to fhoot it off. The meanelt of thefe Omrahs commands a thoufand Horfe ; but if he be a Prince of the Blood, he commands fix tfiou- fand. The Great Mogul has feven Thrones,fome fet all over with Diamonds; others with Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls. The largelt Throne, which is fet up in the Hall of the firft Court, is in fotm like one of our Field-Beds, fix foot long, and four broad. The Culhion at the back is round like a Bolller ; the Culhions on the fides are flat. I counted about a hundred and eight pale Rubies in Collets, about this Throne, the lealt whereof weigh’d a hundred Carats \ but there are fome that weigh two hundred Emraulds I counted about a hundred and fixty,that weigh d fome threefcore, fome thirty Carats. The under-part, of the Canopy is all embroider’d with Pearls and Diamonds, with. a Fringe of Pearls round about. Upon the top of the Canopy, which is made like an Arch with four Panes, Hands a Peacock, with his Tail fprcad, confifting all of Saphirs, and other proper colour’d Stones} the Body is of bea ten Gold, enchas’d with feveral Jewels and a great Ruby upon his break, at which hangs a Pearl, that weighs fifty Carats. On each fideof the Peacor Hand two Nofe-gays, as high as the Bird, confilling of feveral forts of Flowers, all of beaten Gold enamel’d. When the King feats himfelf upon the Throne, there is a tranfparent Jewel, with a Diamond Appendant, of eighty or nme y Carats, encompafs’d with Rubies and Emraulds, fo hung that it is always i^Book II. Travels in In d I a. 129 Eye. The twelve Pillars alfo that uphold the Canopy, are fet with rows of fair Pearl, round, and of an excellent Water, that weigh from fix to ten Ca rats a piece. At the diftance of four feet, upon each fide of the Throne are plac’d two Parafols, or Umbrello’s, the handles whereof are about eight foot high, cover’d with Diamonds; the Parafols themfelves are of crimfon Velvet embroider’d and fring’d with Pearls. ’ This is the famous Throne which Tamerlane began, and Cha-jehan finilb’d * which is really reported to have coll a hundred and fixty Millions and five hundred-thoufand Livres of our Money. Behind this ftately;and magnificent Throne there is another lefs, in the form of a Tub, where the King bathes himfelf j it is an Oval, feven foot long and five broad. The outfide whereof Ihines all over with Diamonds and Pearls* but there is no Canopy over it. Coaling into the firlt Court, on the right hand, you fee a particular Tent wher^ during all the Feaft, the MoricedDancers are appointed to make fport’ whily the King fits upon his Trone. On the left hand is another TentJiPDomtecJ from the Principal Officers of the Army and Houffiold. Li In the fame Court, while the King fits upon his Throne, are to be feen thirty Horfes, fifteen upon one fide, and fifteen upon the other, lead by two men* Their Bridles are very fhort, but for the moll part enrich’d with Diamonds Rubies, Emraulds, and Pearls, the bits whereof are of pure Gold. Every Horfe wears between his Ears a rich Plume of Feathers, with a little Cufhion upon his Back, ty’d on with a Surcingle, both being embroider’d with Gold ; and about his Neck hung fome fair Jewel, which was either a Diamond, a Ruby, or an Emrauld. The worlt of thofe Horfes coil three thoufand, fome five thoufand Crowns } and fome there were, that were never bought’under ten thoufand. The young Prince, who was between feven and eight years old, rode upon a Horfe no higher than a good big Greyhound, but very well fhap’d. About an hour after the King has been fitting upon his Throne,feven iloutEie- phants bred up for War,are brought out. One of thofe Elephants has his Seat fix’d upon his back, if the King fhould have a mind to ride out. The others are eoverd with Cloaths richly embroider’d, with Chains of Gold and Silver about their Necks j and there are four that carry the Kings Standard upon their Crup pers, faften’d to a Half-Pike, which a man feated on purpofe clofe by, holds upright with his hand. Thefe Elephants ape brought within fifty paces of the Throne, and when they come before the King, they make their obeyfances to mm, laying their Trunks to the ground, and then lifting them up above their Heads three times ^ every time he makes a great cry, and then turning his back to the King, one of the Leaders turns up the Cloath, that the Ring may lee he is in good cafe. There belongs alfo to every one a Cord, which is put round his body, to Ihew how much he is grown fince the lafl: year. The firft Elephants, which the King moll efteems, is a great furious Creature, that has five hundred Roupies allow’d him every month. He is fed with good Vi&amp;ualvaijda great quantity of Sucre, and they give him Jqtta»vm to drink. hen the King rides forth upon his Elephant,the Omrahs follow onHorfeback* And when he rides on Horfeback, the Omrabs follow him on foot. After the King has feen his Elephants, he rifes up, and goes into his Harm through a little oval door behind the Throne. The five other Thrones are fet up in another magnificent Hall in another S covei fd over with Diamonds, without any colour’d Stone. When the King has Raid about half an hour, he comes out again, attended wr? £ oar Eunuchs, and feats himfelf in the other Hall, upon the middle^ t t pi. . Thrones, where the Omrahs come, as long as the five days of we Feftival lafl, and make their Prefents to him* * R CHAP.124 Travels in India. Part II. c H A P. IX. Some other Ohfervations upon the Court of the Great Mogul. A fter Aitreng-neb had fetled himfelf in the Empire, which he ufurp’d fronj his Father and his Brothers, he impos’d upon himfelfa very fevere penance eating nothing but Pulfe and Sweet-meats, which has made him very meagre and lean. All the time the Comet lafted in the year 1665, which appear’d very great in the iWie/, where I then was, Anreng-z.eb drank nothing but Wa ter, and eat nothing but Bread made of Millet} which fo impair'd his health, 1 that it had like to have coll him his life. Befides, he always lay upon the ground, only with a Tigers Skin under him ; lince which time he has never been perfectly well. I faw him drink three feveral times, while he fat upon his Throne y to which purpofe he had brought him a large Cup of Cryftal of the Rock, round and all of a piece, with a Gold Cover, enrich’d with Diamonds, Rubies, and Emraulds, the foot thereof being of the fame. But no perfons fee the King eat, only his Wives and his Eunuchs. And it is but very rarely that he goes to Dine or Sup with any of his Subjeds. When I waslaft in India^ Giafer-Kan, who was his Grand Fifier, and his Uncle by marriage of his Wife, invited the King to fee a new Palace which he was building, who went accordingly, and it was the greatefb Honour his Majefty could do him ; in retaliation whereof, Giafer-Kan, and his Wife prefented him with Jewels, Elephants, Camels, Horfes, and other things, to the value of a Million and fifty thoufand Livres of our Money. For Giafer-Karis Wife is the molt magnificent and liberal Woman in all India, and fpends more her felf than all the Kings Wives and Daughters, which makes her Husband in debt, though he be almoft Lord of all the Empire. When the King is carried in his Talkki to the one of his Sons follows him, a Horfeback, and all his Omrahs and officers of his Houlhold come behind him a foot. Thofe that are Adahumetans flay for him at the top of the afcent to the Mofquee^ and when he is ready to come out, they march before him to the Gate of his Palace. Eight Elephants always go before the King, to every one of which belong two men *, one to lead the Elephant, and the other, who fits upon his back, carries a Standard fix’d to a Half-Pike. The other four carry Seats or Thrones upon their backs, the one fquare, the other round ; one cover’d, the other inclos’d with Glafs of feveral fafhions. When the King goes abroad, he has ufually five or fix hundred men to attend him for his Guard, arm’d every one with a kind of an Half-Pike. To the heads of their Pikes they tye two Squibs crofs-wife, about a foot long, and as big as / a mans Arm, which will carry the Half-Pike five hundred paces. The King is alfo attended by three or four hundred Mufquateers j but they are very Cowarcjs, and hardly know how to fhoot off their pieces. He has alfo a cer tain number of Cavalry, which are Soldiers much alike. A hundred Emyeans might well beat a thoufand Indians ; but they would hardly a'ccuflom them- felves to live fuch fober lives. For as well the Horfe, as the Infantry will hve upon Meal kneaded with Water and bfown Sugar ; but in the^ evening, when they have convenience, they make Ouichery, which is Rice boil’d in Water and Salt, with a Grain, fo call’d. When they eat it, they flir it with the ends of their Fingers in melted Butter, which is the ufual food of the Sol diers and poor people. Befide, the heat would kill our Souldiers, who would never be able to endure the Sun all the day long, as the Indians do. by tne way, give me leave to tell you, that the Country people have no^ other cloat - ing than a piece ofLinnen to hide their fecret parts, being miferable poor , for if their Governours know they have any thing about them, they imz 6 ! either as their right, or by force. There are fome Provinces in f • lye wafte, the Natives being forc’d to fly, by reafon of the cruelty oi Governours. Under the pretence of being Mahumttans they perfecute tneBook If. Travels in I n d ] a. Idolaters beyond all meafure; and if any one ofthem embrace ’tis onlv becaufe they would not work any longer. For they turn Souldiers or who are a fort of people that profefs a renunciation of the VVorld,and live upon A ™ v tajre indeed very Rafcals. 1 hey reckon that there are in hd.a 8 oo 5 oo ortheie Mahmman Tayurs, and twelve hunderd-thonfand Idolaters Once in fifteen days the King goes a Hunting,mounted upon his Elephant,and fo continues during the chafe. All the Game he takes is brought within Musket- ftot of his Elephants Which tonfifts generally ofLions^igfrs,Harts,and w,Id- Goats. For they will not meddle with Boars, as being When he returns home, he puts himfelf into his Pxlleki, and goes in the fame order, ard with the fame Guard, as when he returns from the Mofquee, ravine that when he goes a Hunting he is attended with three or four-hunder’d Horfemen that ride without any aifcipline in the World. * 5 As forthe Princefies, as well the Wives, Daughters and Sifters of the King, they never ftir out of the Palace, unlefs it be to fpend a few days in the Countrey [ or , cleir P' c ^ure. Some of them go abroad, but very rarely,to viiit fome great Noble-mens Wives,as the Wife of who is the King’s Aunt. But that is only by particular leave ofthe King. And then it is not the cuftom as in Pertia where the Ladies make their vifits only by night, and with a great number of Eunuchs, who clear the Streets of all people they meet. For in the Mount's Court they ufually go out about nine in the morning, with only three or four Eunuchs, and ten or twelve Slaves, which are inftead of Maids ofHonour. The Princefles are carri’d in Palleh?s cover’d oyer with Embroider’d Taneftrv and a htttle Coach to hold one fingle perfon that follows the drawn bv two men, the wheels not being above a foot in diameter. The reaion why they carry that Coach along with them, is,becaufe that when the Princelfes arrive at the Houfe where they intend to alight, the men that carry the Palliti. not being permitted to go any farther than the firft Gate,they then take their Coaches,and are drawn by their female-Slaves to the Womens Apartment. I have alfo ohferv’d ‘ tet J n , all , th ® Houfes of great Noble-men, the Womens Apartment is at thefarf tner ^nd ol all.

Of the Commodities which are brought as well out of the Dominions of the Great Mogul, as out of the Kingdoms of Golconda and Vifa- pour, and other neighbouring Territories. I T will be neceflary for the Reader to take notice what I have already faid con cerning the weights and Meafures in ufe among the Indians, where I fpoke con cerning the Mines, and the Serre. Now for the Cobit. The Cobit is a meafure for all Commodities that are meafur’d by the Ell, of which there are feveral forts, as in Europe there are feveral forts of Ells. The Cobit is divided into 24 Tafots: and in regard the greateft part of the Commo* dities of India are utter’d at Surat, I have giv’n you a defcription in the margin of the fourth part of a Surat-Cobit, divided into fix Tafots. Of their Silk? XT Afembafar, a Village in the Kingdom of Bengala, fends, abroad every year Av. two anG i twenty-thoufand Bales of Silk \ every Bale weighing a hundefd pound. The two and twenty Bales make two millions and two-hunder’d-thoufand pound, at fixteen ounces to the pound. The Hollanders ufually carry away fix or feven-thoufand Bales,and would carry away more,did not the Merchants of Tar tary, and the Mogul's Empire oppofe them .* for they buy up as much as the Hol lander j the reft the Natives keep to make their Stuffs. This Silk is all brought into the Kingdom of Guz,erat, the greateft part whereof comes to Amadabatgd to Surat, where it is wrought up. In the firft place they make Carpets of Silk and Gold, others of Silk and Silver, others all of Silk ; For the Worfted Carpets are made at Tntapour, fome twelve leagues from, In the fecond place they make Satins with ftreaks of Gold and Silver; others plain ; with Tafrata’s after the fame fafhion. In the third place they make Patoles, which are a fort of Silk-ftuff very thin, but painted with all forts of Flowers, the manufa&amp;ure whereof is at Amdahu They coft from eight Roupies to forty the piece. This is a Commodity wherein The Hutch will not fuffer any one of the Hollanders to trade in particular* for they tranfport it to the Pbilippinc-I(lands, to the Iflands of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and other neighbouring Blands. The raw-Si Ik of K afembafar is yellowifh.as are all the raw-Silks that come from Per fin and Sicily ; but the Natives of Kafembafar have a way to whiten it, with a Lye made of the Alhes of a Tree which they call Adam s Fig-tree ; which makes it as white as the Palesline-Silk. The Hollanders fend away all their Mer chandize which they fetch out oi Bengala, by water, through a great Canal that runs from Kafembafar into Ganges, for fifteen leagues together; from whence it is as far by water down the Ganges to Cb/gv/efy,where they laid their Ships. Of the Calicut s : and firfi ofthe fainted Cakcuts, call'd Chites. ^ Hites or Painted Calicuts,which they call Calmendarfhzt is to fay, done with a Pencil, are made in the Kingdom of Golconda-, and particularly nbou Mafiipatan. But there is made fo little, that though a man fhould a the Workmen that underftand the art of weaving Calicuts, he would nar ; find enough to make three Bales. . . j. The Chites which are made in the Empire of the Great Mognhrc all rn ^ and nothing fp beautiful, neither for the figures nor the finenefs ofthe m • Thofe which are made at Labor,zre the coarfeft,and confequently the c h^P « ell. They are fold by Gorges, every Gorge confifting of twenty pieces, wm i6 to 30 Roupies.Book IL Travels in India., The Chnes which are made at Seronge, are fold from 20 to 50 Roupies the Gorge, or thereabouts. Thefe Chites ferve for Coverlets for Beds,for Sofra’s or Table-cloaths after the Cotmtrey-falhion, Pillowbears,Handkerchiefs,but more efpecially for Wallcoats as well for men as women in Perfia. The fine Calicut-C/?/V^ are made at Bramfour ^ and are usM for handkerchiefs by thofe that fnufF Tobacco. The women alfo, over all Veils of thefe Calicuts,to wear over their heads, and about their Ihoulders, which Veils are call’d Or mis. The Baft as or Calicuts painted red, blue, and black,are carr’id white to Agra, and Amadabatjn regard thofe Cities are near eft to the places where the Indigo is made that is us’d in colouring. They coft from two Roupics to 30 or 40 a-piece according to the finenefs and the quantity of Gold at the ends,and fometimes up on the fides. The Indians have a- way to dip fome of thefe Calicuts in a certain water that makes them look like WaterM-Chamlets, which adds alfo to the price. ' That fort which is fold for two Roupies,and fo onward till ye come to twelve is tranfported to the Coaft of Mdinda,2$A it is the greateft Trade the Governour Mozambique drives, who fells them to the Oz/m, that vend them again among the Abyjfms, and into the Kingdom of Saba: for thofe people not underftanding the ufe of Soap, need no more but only to wafh thefe Calicuts in water. That fort which is valu’d from 12 Roupies upward, is tranfported to the Philippine^ Hands, the Wands of Borneo,Java, Sumatra, and other adjacent places. Where the women wear no other clothes, than a fmgle piece of this Calicut. One part whereof, without cutting it,ferves fora Petticoat; the other they wind about their fiomachs and their heads. White Calicuts, \ , - * ■“ ' ; V ' . . ' jT w Hite Calicuts come partly from Agra, and about Labor, part from Ben- gala : fome from Brouda, Baroche, Renonftari, and other places. They are brought out of the Loom to Renonfari, and r Baroche,Yihzxz they are whiten’d by reafon of the convenience of their Meadows, and the great ftore of Limons* that grow thereabouts. For the Calicuts are never fo white as they Ihould be, till they are dipt in Limon-water. The Calicuts that come from Agra, Labor, and Bengali, are fold by the Corge, and they are of feveral prices,from feventeen Roupies to three or four-hunder’d, as the Merchant will have them wov’n. The Calicuts that come from Renonfari, and Baroche,art one and twenty cubits long, new out of the Loom ^ but in the whitening they fhrunk to twenty cu bits. Thofe of Brouda twenty cubits from the Loom, and fhrink in the whitening to nineteen and a half. All the Calicuts or Bafta’s that come from thefe three Cities, are of two forts ; for fome are broad, fome are narrow. The narrow are thofe I have already men tion’d, the prices whereof are various, from two Mamoudt s to fix. The broad Bafta s are a cubit,and one third part widethe whole piece twenty cubits long. The ufual price of them is from five Mamoudfs to twelve: but a Merchant being upon the place,may caufe them to be made much more large and fane, till they are worth five-hundefd Alamoudts a-piece. 1 faw two pieces fold lor a thoufand Alamoudi s. The Englift bought one,and the Hollanders zwoihzr, each piece containing eight and twenty cubits.

Untwifled Cotton is never tranfported into Europe, being too cum- berfome, and of little value *, only they fend it to Or?nus^Balfara y and fometime^ to the Ehilippine-lfands, and the Iflands of Swde. As for the twifted Cottons' the EtigHfl* ^nd Hillonders tranfport a good quantity, not of the fineftjbut of that fort which is priz’d from fifteen to fifty Mamoudis : Itferves for wicks for Can dles, for Packfaddles,and for the ground ofSilk-ftuffs. India 0. O I Ndigo comes from feveral parts of the great Mogul % Empire *, and according to the diverfity of the places it differs in quality, and consequently in price. ° In the firft place, it comes from the Territories of Buna, Jndoua, and Corf# a day or two’s journey from Agra: which is efteemM the beft of all. It is made alfo eight days journey from Surat, in a Village call’d Sarquefs, two leagues diftance from Amadahat. Here the fiat Indigo is made. There is alfo Indigo lit tle inferior in goodnefs and price, which comes from the King of G’o/co^’s Ter ritories. The Mein of Surat, which contains 42 Serre's, or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu’d from 15 to 20 Roupies. They make as good as this at Barode. That which is made up about Agra is made up in half Ballsjand is the moft fought for in all India. It is fold by the Afc/'w,which in thofe places contains 60 Sems c or 51 and three quarters of our pounds. The ufual price is from 36 to 40 P v ou- pieS. There grows alfo Indico fome 3d leagues from Brampour, about a great Village call’d ^^o/^,and round about the neighbouring Towns in the road to Surat: of which the Natives ufually make above a hiftider’d-thoufand Roupies. There comes Indigo alfo from Bengala ,which the A/o/ZW-Company tranfports for Mafipatan. But they buy this Indigo, and that of ‘Brampour and Amaddat, cheaper by twenty four in the hunder’d &gt; than that of Agra. Indigo is made of an Herb which they low every year after the rains are over; which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it three times a year; firft when it is about two or three foot high 3 and they cut it within haii a foot of the ground 3 the firft: cutting far exceeds the two latter. The fecon 4 cutting is worfe than the firft: by ten or^ twelve in the hunder’d, and the third worfe than the fecond by twelve in the hunder’d. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Pafte, and obferving the colour. The colour of that Indigo which is made of the firft; cutting, is a violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others .* and that which is made of the fecond is more lively than the third. &gt; When they have cut the Herb, they throw it unto Pits which they make v^ith ^ime, which becomes fo hard, that you would judg it to be one intire piece of Marble. They are generally fourfcore or a hunder’d paces in circuit} and being half full of water, they fill them quite up with the Herb. Then they bruife and jumble it in the water tilf the leaf, for the ftalk is worth nothing, become like a kind of thick mud. This being done,they let it fettle for fome days 3 and when the fettling is all at the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When the water is as drain’d out,they fill feverai baskets wit hthis dime, and in a plain Field you fhall fee feveral men at work, every one at his own bas ket, making up little pieces of Indigo flat at the bottom,at the top fharp like ^ Though at Amadabat they make their pieces quite fiat like a fmall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Merchants, becaufe they would not pay cuftom for an unncceflary weight, before they tranfport their Indigo out of Afia into Europe, are very careful to caufe it to be lifted, to feperate the duft from it 3 which they fell afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye theft Calicuts, They that lift this Indigo muft be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath be fore their faces,andthat their noftrilsbe weil-ftapt,kaving only two littles kok$ for their eyes. Befides, they muft every half hour be fare to drink milk,whfth is a great prefervative againft the piercing quality of the duft. Yet notwfth- ~ ‘ 0 ^ 4 HandingBook If. Travek in I n d i a. Handing all this caution, they that have fifted Indigo for nine or ten days, fhall fpit nothing but blew for a good while together. Once I laid an Egg ’in the morning among the lifters, and when I came to break it in the evening it was all blew within. , : ; As they take the Pafte out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes they lay them in the Sun to dry. Which is the reafon that when the Merchants buy Indigo, they burn fome pieces of it, to try whether there be any dull among it. For the Natives who take the Pafte out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps, lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Pafte, and fouls it. But when the Merchants burn it, the Indigo turns to Alhes and the Sand remains. The Governours do what they can to make the Natives leave their Knavery; but notwithftanding all their care, there will be fome de ceit. Salt-Peter. /^Reat ftore of Salt-Teter comes from j 4 gra and Patna - 7 but the refin’d cofts ^ three times more than that which is not. The Hollanders have fet up a Ware-Houfe fourteen Leagues above Patna, and when their Salt-Peter is re fin’d, they tranfport it by Water by Ogneli. A Mein of refin’d Salt-Peter is worth feven Mamoudi’s. ^ Spice. C Ardamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers,Cloves and Cinna mon, are all the different forts of Spices known to us. I put Cardamom, snd Ginger in the firft place becaufe that Cardamom grows in the Territories of Pifafour, and Ginger in the Dominions of the Great Mogul. And as for other Spices, they are brought from other Forreign parts to Surat, which is the grand Mart. - Cardamom is the moft excellent of all other Spices, but it is very fcarce ; and in regard there is no great ftore in the place where it grows, it is only nadeufe ofin Jlfia, at the Tables of great Princes. Five hundred pound of Cardamoms, are priz’d from a hundred to a hundred and ten Reals* Ginger is brought in great quantities from Amadabat, where there grows more than in any other part of Afla ; and it is hardly to be imagin’d how much there is tranfported candied into Foreign parts. Pepper is of two forts. There is a fort which is very fmall, another fort much bigger v both which forts are diftinguifh’d into fmall and great Pepper. The larger fort comes from the Coaft of Malay are , and Tuticorin and Calicut are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of Fifapour, being vended zt Rejapour, a little City m that Kingdom. The Hollanders that purchafe it of the Malavares, do not give Money for it, but feveral forts of Commodities in Exchange j as Cotton, Opium, Vermillion v and Quickfilver \ and this is the Pepper which is brought into Eu- rope^. As for the little Pepper that comes from Bantam, Afcben, and fome other 'TL * w t*r w Hi LliC UlUUtU. 1 he little Pepper that comes to Surat, has been fold fome years for thir- een or fourteen Mamoudi’s the Mein y and fo much I have feen the Enghjh give tor it, to tranfport it to Ormus, Balfara, and the Red Sea. As for the great Pepper which the Hollanders fetch from the Coaft of Malayare, five hun- rea p©und in truck brings them in not above thirty-eight Reals j but by the ommodities which they give in Barter, they gain Cent&gt; per Cent. he Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow’r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the only pices which the have in their own hands. The three firft come jom the Molucca lllands *, the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from the Ifland of i^nbiuwdrutne £ait,there is noneot it carried out ot Apa, where it is fpent m vaft quantities, efpecially among the Alahumetans. For there are double the Grams of fmall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper j in- i ♦- Li.-k 4*1^Travels in India. Tis obfervable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never pianteri which has been confirm'd to me by feveral perfons that have liv’d feveral year* in the Countrey. They related to me, that the Nutmeg being ripe, feveral Birds come from the Iflands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forc’d to throw it up again before it be digefted. The Nutmeg then -heftnear’d with a vifcous matter, felling to the ground takes rpot, and produces a Tree, which* would never thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one obfervation upon the Birds of Paradife. Thefe Birds being very greedy after Nutmegs, come in flights to gorge themfeves with the pleafing Spice, at the feafon, like Felfares in Vintage time * but the ftrength of the Nutmeg fo intoxi cates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the Emets in a Ihort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds of Paradife are faid to have no Feet; which is not true however, for I have feen three or four that had Feet j and a French Merchant fent one from Aleppo as a Prefent to Lewk the Thirteenth that had Feet j of which the King made great account,as being a very lovely Fowl, 6 But notwithftanding all the Hollanders Proje&amp;s, you may buy Cloves at Macajfar without purchafing them of the Hollander in regard the Iflanders buy them of the Dutch Captains and Soldiers, which the Hollanders have in thofe places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange Rice, and other &lt;toeceflaries for the fupportoflife, without which they would ftarve, being very fadly provided for. When the Natives of Macajfar are thus furnifh’d of Cloves, they barter them in Exchange for fuch Commodities as are brought them } fometines they give Tortoife-Shells in exchange, and Gold Duff ^ by which the Merchant gains fix dr feven in the hundred, being better than the Money of the Ifland, though it be Gold, by reafon the King ofttimes enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are Amboyna y Ellias^ Seram y and Bonro. The Iflands of Banda alfo, in number fix, vhc. Nero, Lotttour, Foulcay, Rofe* gmn ? and Grenapms y bear Nutmegs, in great abundance. The Ifland of Grm- fnis 'is about fix Leagues in compafs, and ends in a (harp point, where there is a continual fire burning out of the Earth. The Ifland of Damtn'e y where there grows great ftore of Nutmegs, and very ^ big, was dilcover’d in the year 1647, by Abel Tajman, zDntch Commander. The price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them fold to the Hoi* landers at Sarat y was as follows. # The Mein of Surat contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of our Pounds, at fixteen Ounces to the Pound. A Mein of Cloves was fold for a hundred and there Matnoudi’s and a half A Mein of Mace was fold for a hundred and fifty-feven Mamoudf $ and a 4 :« 7 «* fn/v* «/. n. . half. Nutmegs for fifty-fix Mamoudf s and a half. Cinnamon comes at Prefent from the Ifland of CeyUn. The Tree that bears it h very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They never take off bn* the firft and fecond, which is accounted the belt. They never meddle with th£ third, for fhouid the Knife enter that, the Tree would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they learn from their youth. The Cinna mon Spice is much dearer to the Hollanders than people think } for the King ofCeyiarij otherwife cail’d King of Candy y from the name of his principal City, being a fworn Enemy to the Hollander 's y fends his Forces with an intention to furprize them, when they gather their Cinnamon ; fo that they are forc’d to bring feven or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the Bortugals were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water ;Was all confum’d. When it was cold, the upper part became a Pafte like white Wax ; of which they made Tapers to fet up in their Churches, for no fooner were the Tapers lighted, but all the Church was perfum’d. Formerly the tagaU brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the Rajas aboritBook II. Travels in India. i 3 i Cochin. But the Hollanders have deflroyed all thofe places, fb that the Cinna mon is now in their hands. When the Portugal* had that Coaft, the Enrlifh bought their Cinnamon of them,and ufually paid for it by the Mein fifty MamoudiY Drugs that are brought to Surat, and brought from other Countries^ with the price of every one by the Mein. .

Gum-Lake for the moft part comes from Pegu ; yet there is fome alfo brought from Bengala, where it is very dear, by reafon the Natives fetch that lively Scar let colour out of it, with which they paint their Calicuts. Newerthelefs, i}K . Hollanders buy it, and carry it into Perfia for the fame ufe of painting, yhat which remains after the colour is drawn off, is only fit to make fealing Wax. That which comes from Pegu is not fo dear, though as good for other Countries. The difference is only this, that it is not fo clean in Pegu, where the Pifmires foul it, as in 'Bengal^ where it grows in a healthy place, full of hhrubs, where tfiofe Animals cannot fo well come at it. The Inhabitants of Pegu never make any ufe of it in painting, being a dull fort of people, that are m nothing at all indufirious. The women of Surat get their livings by cleanfing the Lake after the Scar let colour is drawn from it. After that they give it what colour they pleafe, nna make it up into Sticks for fealing Wax.

Plain Silk Wares may be alter’d in length, bredth, and quality. The qua lity fhews it felf when they are of an even thread, when the weight is equal, and when there is no Cotton thread in the Weft. The Indians not having the art ofguilding filver, put into their flrip’d Wares threads of pure Gold, fb that you mull count the quantity of Gold threads to fee whether the Silk have its due number. And this alfo you rauft obferve in your Silks woy’n with Silver: As for TafFata’s,your are only to mind whether the pieces be all of a fiinenefs, and to fee by unfolding fome of them, that there be nothing within to augment the weight, and then weighing all the pieces by themfelves, to fee that they all agree. The colours of thofe Carpetts which are made in India, do not laft fo long as the colour of thofe which are made jn Berfid ; but for the Workman- Ihip it is very lovely. The eye of the Broaker is to judg of the largenefs, beauty, and finenefs of thofe Carpetts which are wrought with Gold aiid Silver, and whether they be fine and rich. But ( whether they be Carpetts, or other Stuffs mix’d with Gold and Silver, it behoves the Buyer to pull out fome of the Gold and Silver Threads, to fee whether they be of the right value or no. Deceits in the White Calicuts. The deceits ufually put upon Galicuts, are in finenefs length, and breadth. Every Bale may contain two hundred pieces; among which they will juggle in five or fix or ten, lefs fine, or lefs white, fhorter and narrower than accor ding to the fcantling of the Bale, which cannot be found out but by examining them piece by piece. The finenefs is difcern’d by the eye,the length and breadth by the meafure. But the Indians pradife a more cunning way, which is to count the number of threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the finenefs of the fcantling. When the number fails, it is either more tranf- parent, more narrow, or more courfe. The difference is fometimes fo difficult to be perceiv’d, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great deal. For it is no thing to coufen a Crown or two Crowns, in a piece that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Thofe that whiten thefe Calicuts, to lave charges of a- few Limons, will knock the Calicuts exceffively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and loars the price. As for their Calicuts dy’d blew or black, you mufl take care that the Work- then do not knock them after they are folded, to make them look fleek $ for many times when they come to be unfolded, you fhall find holes in the creafes. ^ As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and printed as i ney come out of the Loom, the Merchant miifl take care that what he be- fpeaks be finifh’d before the end of the Rains, for the thjcker the Water is wherei where they are walh d, the more lively will the printed and painted colours an- pear. It is'eafy todiftingmlh between the printed and the painted Calicuts- and between the neatnefs of the work : but for the finenefs and other oua’ lines, they are not fo eafily difcern’d j and therefore the Broaker mult be more careful. Cheats in Cotton. T H E cheat in A t ,e ^.ght is twofold. The firft, by laying them in a moiit , pla %i a r d thr 1 uIbng in the middle of every SkainTomething toadd to the weight. The fecond, in not giving good weight when the Broaker receives it from the Workman, oi Merchant that delivers it. There is but one cheat in the quality, that is by putting three or four Skains ofa coarfer Commodity than that which is uppermoft, into one Mem Which in a great quantity mounts high; for there are fome Cottons that areworth. an hunderd Crowns the Me*. Thefe two cheats being often usd by the y*/W-Company, there is no way but to weigh vour Com modity in the prefence of the -D/wb-Commander, and his Councel and to examine every Mew, Skain by Skain. When this is done they who are erderd to be at this examination, are oblig’d to fix to every Bale a ticket of the weight and quality : for if there be a faileur, they who fix the ticket are engag’d to make good what is wanting.

CHAP.134 Travels in India. Part i], CHAP. XL Cf Diamonds^ and the Mines and Riven where they are found * and fir ft of the Author s journey to the Mine tf/Raolconda. T H £ Diamond is the moft precious of all Stones, and it was in that fort of Commodity wherein I moft dealt. And therefore to acquire a perfect ex- perience, I went to all the Mines \ and to one of the Rivers where they are found. To which purpofe I travell’d to four Mines} of which I will give youa cjefcription ; and of one of the Rivers where I have alfo been. The firftof thefe Mines, where I was,is in the Territories of the King of£7- fopourfm the Province of Carnatic a 3 and the place is call’d Raokondafwz days journey from Golconda^vd eight or nine from Fifaponr. This Mine was difcover’d not above two-hunder’d years ago, as I was Inform’d by thofe of the Coun trey.- Round about the place where the Diamonds are found,the ground is fandy,full of Rocks, much refembling the parts near Foumain-Bteau. There are in \he Rocks feveral veins, feme half a fmger, fome a whole finger-wide * And the Miners make ufe of Irons with hooks at the end, with which they pick out the earth or Sand, which they put into tubs,and among that earth,they find the Dia monds. But becaufe thefe veins do not run always flreight,but fometimes down fdmetimes upward,the Miners are conflrain’d to break the Rook,following always the trace of the veins .* When they have open’d all the veins 7 , and taken out all the fand, then they wafh it two or three times over to look for the Diamonds. In this Mine it is that they find the deaneft Stones, and of the whitefi water. But the mifehief is, that to fetch the fand out of the Rock, they are forc’d to ftrike fuch terrible blows with a great Iron-leaver, that they flaw the Dia mond, and make it look like Cryltal. Which is the reafon there are found fo many foft Stones in this Diamond-Mine,though they make a' great fhew. If the Stone be clean, they only give it a turn or two upon the wheel,not caring to ihape it, for fear of lofing the weight. If there be any flaws, or any point*, or any black or red fpecks in it, they cut all the Stone into Foflets j or if there be only a little flaw, they work it under the ridg of one of the Foflets, to hide the de- fed. Now becaufe a Merchant defiros rather to have a black fpeck than a red one} ’tis but burning the Stone, and the fpeck becomes black. This trick at length I underftood fo well, that when I law any Stones in them that came from the Mine made into Foflets, efpecially very fmall ones, I was certain there was either fome fpeck or fome flaw in the Stone. There are feveral Diamond-Cutters at this Mine,but none of them have above one Mill, which is of Steel. They never cut but one Stone at a time upon each Mill, calling water continually upon the Mill,to And out the grain of the Stone j which being found they pour on Oil,('not fparing for powder ol Diamonds though it be very dearj to make the Stone Aide the falter } and they lay on more weight than we do. I have feen them lay upon one Stone an hunder’d and fifty pound of Lead. I mull confefs it was a great Stone,which weigh’d an hunder’d and three Carats, after it was cut} and the Mill was like ours, only the great Wheel was turn’d by four Negros. The Indians are not of the fame opinion that we are} for they do not believe that the weight gives any lulter to the Stones. If theirs be not fubjed to take their lufter, ’tis becaufe there is always a Boy that Hands with a thin woodden-llice in his hand,and waters the Wheel continually with Oil and Powder of Diamonds. Befides, their Wheel does not go fo fall as ours,becaufe the Woodden-wheel that turns the Steel-wheel, is not above three foot in Diameter. T hey cannot give that lively polilhment to Stones,as we give to ours in Europe^ and I believe the reafon to be, becaufe their Wheel does not run fo flat as ours. For in regard it is of Steel, to rub' it upon the Emeril, as mult be done every four and twenty hours, the Tree mult be taken off, which can never be put on againBook II. Travels in India. again fo as to run To flat as it did. Had they the; invention of Iron-mills, upon which they never ufe Emeril, but only the File, becaufe tWix is no necefFjty to take off the Tree to file the Mill, they might polifh their Stones better than they do. I have told you they muft eithe rub the Mill with Emeril, or file it every four and twenty hours. For when the Stone has run for fome time,that part of the Mill becomes as fmooth and bright as glafs •• fo that if you do not rough it again either With Emeril or the File, the powder will not flay ; whereas if the powder flay,there is more work done in an hour than otherwife in two. Though a Diamond be naturally very hard, having a kind of a knot,as you fee in wood, the Mian Lapidaries will cut the Stone,which our European Lapidaries find great difficulty to do,and ufuaily will not undertake to perform; which makes the Indians require fomething more for the falhion. As for the Government of the Mines, they trade very freely, and very faith fully. They pay two per cent, to the King for all thatjthey buy: befides that he has alfo a duty from the Merchants for leave to dig. The Merchant after he has made fearch with the Miners, who know all the places where the Diamonds grow choofes out a place about two-hunder’d paces in compafs,where they fet at work fometimes fifty, fometimes an hunder’d Miners,as they are in haft of work. And from the day that they begin to work, to the day that they end, the Merchants pay to the King two Pagpds a-day ^ and four when they employ an hunder’d men. Thefe poor people never get above three Pagods all the year long though they underftand their bufinefs extremely well} fo that their wages being fo fmall they make no fcruple, when they can handfomely, to hide a Stone for their own pro fit ; and in regard they are quite naked, only for a rag about their privities,fome- tiraes they are fo dextrous, as to fwallow the Stone. The chief of the Merchants who employ thefe Miners ffiew’d me one of them, that had cozen’d him of a Stone, and had put it into the corner of his eye, but he took it from the fellow fofoon as he had difeovefd the cheat. To prevent this cozenage,there are twelve or fifteen in fifty, who are engag’d to the Merchant, that he lhall have no injury done him, nor any thefts committed. If by accident they meet with a Stone that weighs 14 or id Carats, they prefently carry it to the Mafter of the work who gives him in recompence the fiarpo, which is a piece of Calicut to make luma Bonnet, to the value of 25 Sous, together with half a Pagod in Silver or e]fe a whole Pagod, when he gives him neither Rice nor Sugar. The Mefcliants that come to trade at the Mines keep their Lodgings; and every morning about ten or eleven a clock, after they have din’d, the Maftersofthe Miners bring their Diamonds to {hew them. If the Stones are large,or that there be io many as amount from twp-thoufand to fixteen-thoufand Crowns, they will leave them with the ftrange Merchant feven or eight days, fpr the Merchants to conuder. ^ When the Merchant has feen the Stones,it becomes him to agree upon the price in a {hart time. Otherwife the party that owes the Stones, takes them away again, and you {hall never lee the fame Stones again, unlefs mix’d with others. When the bargain is concluded, the Purchafer givesaBill of Exchange hpon the Banker. If you have agreed to pay him in four dayes,and make him ftay onger, you.muft pay him down one and an half in the hunder’d for a months in- tereit M 0 ft commonly when they know the Merchant to be fufficient, they will choofe to take a Bijl of Exchange for for Golconda, or rifapour.bnt moieelpecially for Surat, 3$ being the moft frequented Port in all Mia, where y may mpiffi themfelyes with all Commodities which they want, i ls ^ery pleafant tp fee the young children of the Merchants and other people r, 6 ountrey, from the age often to fifteen or fixteen years, who feat them- hacV T n a j ee ’ • t ^ at . s t ^ le vo ^ place of the Town: Every one of them w ii-H g “d-wejghts in a little Bag hanging at one fide,on the other hisPurfe, an ' v ^ or fix-hunder d Pagods in Gold in it.

In the evening the Children compute what they have laid out,then they look upon their Stones, and feperate them according to their water,their weight,and clearnefs. Then they bring them to the great Merchants, who have generally great parcels to match .* and the pro fit is divided among the children equally ^ only the chief among them has afourth in the hunder’d more than the reft. As young as they are,the y fo well underftand the price of Stones, that if one of them have bought any purchafe,and is willinp; to lofe one half in the hunder’d, the other fhall give him his Money. They (hat hardly bring you a parcel of Stones, above a dozen, wherein there is not fome flaw or other defedt # When I came to the Mine, I went to wait upon the Governour, who told me I was welcome} and becaufe he made no queftion but that I had brought Gold with me, ('for they talk of nothing under Gold at the Mines,) he bid me only lay it in my Chamber,and he would undertake it fhould be fafe. Thereupon he pre- fented me with four fervants to watch my Gold day and night, and to follow,my orders, bidding me withal fear nothing, but eat,drink,and ilebp,an&amp; take care of my health; but withal he told me I muft be careful of not cheating the King. Thereupon I fell to buying,and found profit enough,abovg twenty in the hunder’d cheaper than at I have one thing to obferve which is more than ordinarily curious,concerning the manner how the Indians, as well zsMahumetans as Idolaters, drive their bar gains. Every thing is done with great filence,and without any talking on either iide. The buyer and the feller fit one before another like two Taylors,and the one of the two opening his Girdle, the feller takes the right-hand of the purely fer, and covers his own hand and that with his Girdle .* under which,in the pre- fence of many Merchants that meet together in the fame Hall, the bargain isfe- cretly driven without the knowledg of any perfon. For then the pur chafer nor fellef fpeak n either with their mouths nor eyes, but only with the hand, as thus. When the feller takes the purchafer by the whole hand,that fignifies a thoufand, and as often as he fqueezes it,he means fo many thoufand Pagods or Roupies,ac cording to the Money in queftion. If he takes but half to the knuckle of the middle-finger, that’s as much as to fay fifty .♦ The fmall end of the finger to the firft knuckle fignifies ten. When he grafps five fingers,it fignifies fivfe-hunder’dj if but one finger, one-hunder’d. This is the myftery which the Indians ufein driving their bargains. And many times it happens, that it the fame place,where there are feveral people,one and the fame parcel fhall be foldfeven or eight times over, and no perfon know that it was fold in that manner every time. As for the weight of the Stones, no perfon can be deceiv’d in them,unlefs he purchafe them in hugger-mugger. For if they are publickly bought, there is a perfon on purpofe paid by the King,without any benefit from particularperfons, whofe place it is to weigh the Diamonds j and when he has fpoken the weight, the buyer and feller are fatisfi’d in his words, as not being a perfon any way ob lig’d to favour any perfon. &gt; c . rrn q r! ; ; Having difpatch’d all my bufinefs at the Mine, the Governour appointed me fix Horfe-men to convoy me through the Territories under his Government, which extends to a River that feparates the Kingdom of Vifavonr from that of Golconda. ’Tis a very difficult thing to crofs that River,it being deep,broad and rapid; be- fides that, there are no Boats. But they ferry over Men, Carriages, Oxen and Coaches upon a round VefTel, ten or twelve foot in Diameter, made of Ofier- twigs, like our Flaskets, and cover’d without with Ox-hides as I have already related. They might eafily ufe Boats, or make a Bridg} but the King of Gol* conda will not fuffer either, becaufe the River parts the two Kingdoms. Every evening the Ferry-men on both fides are bound to carry to two Governours on each fide the River, an exatt account of the Perfons,Carriages and Merchandizes which they ferri’d over that day. Coming to Golconda, \ found that the perfon whom I had left intruft withmy Chamber,was dead; but that which I obferv’d moft remarkable, was,thatIiouna the door feal’d with two Seals, one being the Cad?s or chief Juflice’s, the other the Sha-Banders, or Provoft of the Merchants.

S Even days journey from Golconda Eaflward there is another Diamond Mine, call’d in the language of the Country Gnm y in the Ferjian tongue Codour. It is near a great Town, by which the fame River runs, which I crofs’d coming from the other Mine } and a League and a half from the Town is a high Moun tain in the form of a Half-Moon } the fpace between the Town an the Moun tain is a Plain where they dig and find Diamonds. The nearer they dig to the Mountain, the larger Stones they find} but at the top they find nothing at all. It is not above a hundred years fince this Mine was found out by a Country- anan, who digging in a piece of ground to fow Millet, found therein a pointed Stone that weigh’d above twenty-five Carats } he not knowing what the Stone was, but Being it glifter, carry’d it to Golconda^ where as it-happen’d. Well for him, he met with one that traded in Diamonds. The Merchant In forming himfelf of the place where the Stone was found, admir’d to fee a jewel of that biguefs, not having feen any one before that weigh’d above tenor twelve Carats. However his report made a great noife in the Country} infomuch that the Mony’d men in the Town fet themfelves to work, and cauling the ground to be fearch’d, they found, and ftill do find bigger Stones, and in greater quan tity than in any other Mine. For they found a great number of Stones from ten to forty Carats, and fometimes bigger ; among the reft that large Stone that weigh’d nine hundred Carats, which Mirgimola prefented to Anreng-z.eb. But though this Mine of Codour be fo coniiderable for the quantity of great Stones which are there found, yet the mifchief is, the Stones are not clean ; the Waters having fome thing of the quality of the Earth where they are found. If the Ground be merfhy, the Water enclines to black } if it be red, there is a rednefs in the Water; in other places the Stones appear fomewhat greeniffi, in others yellowith; fuch a diverllty of Soils there is between die Town and the Mountain. Upon the moft part of thefe Stones after they are cut, there appears a kind of greaiie moifture, which muft be as often wip’d off. As for the Water of the Stones, it is. remarkable, that whereas in Europe We make ufe of day-li ght to examine the rough Stones, and to judg of their Water, and the fpecks that are found therein, the Indians do all that in the night-time, fetting up a Lamp with a large Wiek, in a hole which they make in the Wall, about a foot fquare } by the light whereof they judg of the Wa ter and clearnefs of the Stone, which they hold between their Fingers. The Water which they call celeftial is the worft ofall, and it is impoffible to difcern it fo long as theSto/ie is rough. The moft infallible way to .find Out that Wa« * T * ten138 Travels in India. . Part IT I III!

In the bottom of th^ little Wall, at the dilfance of every two foot, they make fmall holes to let inth water; which theyftop up afterwards,till they come to drain out the water again The place being thus prepar’d, the people that are to work meet all top ether men, women, and children, with the Workmafter in the Company of his Friend and Relations. Then he brings along with him fome little Image of the God that they adore 3 which being plac’d upright upon the ground, they all p ro , ftrate themfelves three times before it, while their Prieh: fays a certain prayer' The prayer being ended, he marks the forehead of every one with a kind* of Glue, made of Saffron and Gum, to fuch a compafs as will hold feven or eight Grains of Rice, which he Ricks upon it 3 then having wafh’d their bodies with water, which every one brings in his pot, they rank themfelves in order to eat what the Workmafter prelents them, before they go to work, to encourage them both to labour and be faithful. This Feaft conlifts of nothing elfe but everv one his Plate of Rice, diftributed by the Bramin ; for an Idolater may eat anv thing from the hands of one of their Priefts. The Plates are made of the Leaves of a certain Tree, not much unlike our Walnut-tree Leaves.

AH the Earth being carry’d into the place before mention d, the men, women, and children with Pitchers throw the water which is in the drains upon the Earth,letting it foak for two or three days,according to the hardnefs of it, till it come to be a kind of Batter; then they open the holes in the to let out the water, and throw on more water ftill, till all the mud be walh d away, and nothing left but the Sand. After that they dry it in tk Sun 3 and then they winnow th'e Sand in little Winnows, as we winnow our Corn. The fmall duft flies away, the great remains, which they pour out a- gain upon the ground. 1 The Earth being thus winnow’d, they fpread with a kind of Rake, as thin as they poflibly can ; then with a wooden Inftrument, like a Paviers Rammer, about Talf a foot wide at the bottom, they pound the Earth from one end to the other, two or three times over. After that they winnow it again then; and Ipreading it at one end of the Van for fear of loling any of the Earth, tliey look ior the Diamond. ; Formerly they were wont to pound the Earth with Flint^ftones, inftead 01 wooden Rammers j which made great flaws in the Diamonds, and is there fore now left off.

XV. the Rale to how the juft price and value of a Diamond of what weight foever y from three to a hander d y and upwards v a fee ret known to very few people in Europe. ^ - I Make no mention of Diamonds of three Carats, the price thereof being fuf- ficiently known. o , Firft then, as to others above that weight, you mult know how much the Dia mond weighs, and fee if it be perfect; if it be a thick Stone, well-fquar’d, and have all its corners, if the water be white and lively, without fpecks and flaws. If it be a Stone cut in Facets, which we call a Rofe-Diamond, you muft take no tice whether the form be round or oval, whether it be of a fair breadth, and not of Stones clapt together , whether it be of a good water, and without fpecks or flaws. Such a Stone weighing one Carat, is worth 150 Livres or more. Now to know how much a Stone of the fame perfe&amp;ion, weighing 12 Carats, is worth. Multiply 12 by 12, it makes 144. f Then multiply 144 by 150, which is the price of a Stone of one Carat, it comes to 21600 Livres. As for Example. 12 1 2 &gt; 1 44 150 7200 1 44 ■ 21600 livres. To know the price of imperfect Diamonds, you mufl: obferve the fame rale, grounded upon the price of a Stone of one Carat. You have a Diamond of fifteen Carats (hewn ye, neither of a good water, nor good form, and full of fpecks and flaws befides.* fuch a Diamond cannot be worth above 60, or 80, or 100 Livres at nioft, according to the goodnefs of the Stone. Multiply therefore the weight of the Diamond of 15 Carats by 15 : then mul tiply the product, which is 125, by the value of the Stone of one Carat, which we will grant to be 80 Livres, ths product whereof is 10000 Livres, the price 01 a Diamond of 15 Carats.Book II. Travels in India. The Example. *5 1 5 75 1 5 1 2 5 80 10000 livres. By that it is eafie to difcover the difference between a perfed and an imperfed Stone. For if that Stone of 15 Carats were perfect, the fecond multiplication told be wrought by 150, which is the price ofa perfect Stone of one Carat: and then the Diamond would come not to 10000 Livres, but to 33750 Livres that is 23750 Livres more than an imperfect Diamond of the fame weight. By this rule obferire the price of two the greateft Diamonds of the World for . , ones, the one in Afia^ belonging to the Great Mogul 1 the other in Europe* in the pofTeffion of the Duke of Tufcany. 6 ^ The Great Mogul's Diamond weighs 279 and 9 16th Carats. It is ofa perfect good water, ofa good fhape, with only a little flaw in the edg. of the cutting be low, which goes round about the Stone. Without that flaw,the firfl Carat were worth 160 Livres,but for that reafon I reckon it not at above 150; and foby the rule it comes to 11723278 Livres,14 Sous,and three Liards. Did the Diamond weigh no more than 279 Carats, it would not be worth above 11575150 Livres fo that the nine i6ths comes to 47128 Livres, 14 Sous, and three Liards. 1 he Great Duke of Tufcmfs Diamond weighs 139 Carats, clean and well- inapd cut m facets every way: but in regard the water enclines fomewhat to- ward the colour of Citron, ! do not value the firft Carat above 135 Livres; fo that by the rule the Diamond ought to be worth 2508335 Livres. by the Miners is call d /W, which the Turks* Per pans and Arabians call Almds.

The other place where Rubies are found, is a River in the Ifland of Ceylun, which defcends from certain high Mountains in the middle of the Ifland ^ which fwells very high when the rains fall; but when the waters are low, the people make it their bufmefs to fearch among the Sands for Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes. All the Stones that are found in this River, are generally fairer and clearer than thofe of Pegn. I forgot to tell you that there are lome Rubies, but moreBalleis-Rubies, and an abundance of Baftsrd-Rubies, Saphirs and Topazes found in the Mountains that run along from Pegit to the Kingdom of Camboya.

In Hungary there is a Mine where they find certain Flints of differentbig- nefs, fome as big as eggs, fome as big as a man’s fift,which being broken,contain a Ruby within as hard and as clean as thofe or Pegu. In Hungary there is a Mine of Opals, which Stone is no-where elfe to be found in the World but there. The Turquoife is no-where to be found but in Perfia. Where there are two Mines.

This Prince has the moft wonderful Pearl in the ^ world, not fo much for its bignefs, for it weighs not above twelve Carats and .one nxteenth, not for its perfect roundnefs, but becaufe it is fb clear and fo traniparent that you may airabft fee through it.

As for the laft, there are no 4 fuch but only in America which proceeds from the nature of the Earth at the bottom of the Water’ which is generally more ouzy than in theEaft. I once met with fix Pearls in the return of a Cargo from the Weft Indies that were perfectly round, but black like jet, which weigh’d one with another twelve Carats. I carried them into the Eaft Indies to put them off, but could meet with bo Chapman to buy them As for thofe that incline to yellow, it proceeds from hence, that the Fiihermen felling the Oyfters to the Merchants in heaps, while they ftay fourteen or fif teen days till the Oyfters lofe their water, the Oyfters waft and begin to fmell' for which reafon the Pearl grows yellow by infedion, which appears to be a truth, in regard that where the Oyfters preferve their liquor the Pearls are white. Now the reafon why they ftay till the Oyfters open of themfelves is becaufe that if they fhould force them open, they might perhaps injure and cut the Pearl. In fhort, the Eaftern people are much of our humour in matter of whitenefs, for they love the whiteft Pearls and the blackeft Diamonds • the whiteft bread, and the faireft women. 5 ^ CHAP. XVIII. //aw the Pearls are hr eel in the Oyfiers ; how they Fijh for them, and at what time. S Ome ancient Writers have vulgarly reported, that Pearls are produc’d by the Dew of Heaven, and that there is but one in an Oyfter } but experience teaches the contrary. For the Oyfter never ftirs from the bottom of the Sea, where the Dew can never come, which is many times twelve fathoms deep; befides, that it is as often obferv’d, that there are fix or feven Pearls in one &gt; Oyfter; and I have had in my hands an Oyfter, wherein there were above ten beginning to breed. 5 Tis very true, that they are not always of the fame big- nefs ; for they grow in an Oyfter after the fame manner as Eggs in the Belly of a Pallet. But I cannot fay there are Pearls in all, for you may open many Oyfters and find none. Tis no advantage to them that fifli for Pearls \ for if the poor people could find any other employment, they would never ftick to fuchaone as meerly keeps them alive. But the Land is fb barren, that you may travel twenty Leagues be fore you meet with one blade of Grafs} and the people are fb miferably poor,that they feed upon nothing but Dates and Salt-filh. 1 hey fifh in the Eaftern Seas twice a year; the firft time in March and April, the fecond time in AnguTt and September 3 and they keep their Fairs in June and November . However they do not filh every year 3 for they that fiih, will know beforehand whether it will turn to account or no. Now to the end they may not be deceiv d, they fend to the places where they are wont to fifiv leven or eight Barks, who bring back each of them about a thoufand Oyfters, y ‘v • s v , which1 Book II. Travels in India. 147 ' 1 - ■ sr. ■' which they open, and if they find not in every thoufand Oyfters to the value of five Fano’s of Pearl, which amounts to half a Crown of our Money, ’tis a fign that the Fifiiing will not turn to account, in regard the poor people would not be able to defray their charge. For partly for a flock to fet out, and partly for vi&amp;uals while they are abroad, they are forc’d to borrow Money at three or four in the hundred a month. So that unlefs a thoufand Oyllers yield them five Fano’s of Pearls, they do not filh that year. As for th£ Merchants, they mufi buy their Ovfters at hap-hazard, and be content with what they find in them. If they meet with great Pearls, they account themfelves happy ; which they feidom do at the Filhery of Manar^ thofe Pearls being fit for little elfe but to be fold by the Ounce, to powder. Sometimes a thoufand Oyfters amounts to feven Fano’s, and the whole Fifhery to a hundred thoufand Piafters. The Hollanders take of every Di ver eight Piallers, in regard they always attend the Fifhery with two or three fmall Men of War, to defend them from the Malavares Pyrats. The more Rain falls in the year, the more profitable the Fifhery happens to be. They fifh in twelve fathom water, five or fix Leagues off at Sea,fometimes two hundred and fifty Barks together, among which there is not above one or two Divers at moft. ; J f There is a Cord ty’d under the Arms of them that dive, one end whereof is held by them that are in the Bark. There is alfo a great ftane of eighteen or twenty pound ty’d to the great Toe of him that dives; the end of the Rope that fallens it being alfo held by them in the VefTel. The Diver has befide a Sack made like a Net, the mouth whereof is kept open with a Hoop. Thus provided, he plunges into the Sea, the weight of the ftone prefently finking him ; when he is at the bottom, he flips off the ftone, and the Bark puts off. Then the Diver goes to filling his Sack, as long as he can keep his breath ; which when he can do no longer, he gives the Rope a twitch, and is prefently hail’d up again. Thofe of Manar are better Filhers, and ftay longer in the water than thofe of Balden and Cattfa j for they neither put Pincers upon their Nofes, nor Cotton in their Ears, as they do in the Perfian Gulf. After the Diver is draw’n up, he ftays half a quarter of an hour to take breath, and then dives again, for ten or twelve hours together. As for the Oyfters themfelves, they throw’em away, as being ill-tafted and unfavoury. To concludethedifcourfe of Pearls, you are to take notice^ xhttm Eurofc they fell them by the Carat weight, which is four Grains. In Perfia they fell ^ them by the Abas, and one Abas is an eighteenth lefs than our Carat. In the Dominions of the Moguls the Kings of Vifapour and Golconda weigh them by the Ratis, and one Ratis is alfo an eighteenth lefs than our Carat. Goa was formerly the greateft place of the World for the trade of jewels and Pearls. You mull know therefore, that in Goa^ and in all other places which the Portugals had in the Indies, they us’d a particular weight to fell their Pearls by, which they call Chego’s •, the proportion whereof to Carats appears in the fol lowing Table, .... i * y ^ CaratsNkfnb. 5.

The finall pitct happen’d to be tlfcan, excepting a little fiaW hardly to be perceiv’d, but for the other, wherein there are fo many other crofs flaws, there was no way but to make fever! of eight pieces of it.

The fecond place is call’d Boza ; and the third is neer the Ifland of St. Peter. There are two other places upon the Coaft: of France, the one neer the Baftion of France ; the other at Ta- barijHe .There Is alfo another Fiihery upon the Coaft o{ Sicily, neer Trepano buES the Coral is fmall, and ill-colour’d. There is another upon the Coaft of Cat alien* neer Cape de Qmers ; where the Coral is large, and of an excellent colour butthe branches are Ihort. There is a ninth Filhery in the Ifland of Majorque much like that neer the Ifland of Corfic*. And thefe are all the places ifl CxcMediterraman- Sea, where they filh for Coral; for there is none at all in the Ocean. Becaufe that Coral grows under the hollow Rocks where the Sea is deep the Filhers fix two fpars of wood a-crofs, faftening a great piece of Lead in the mid dle to make it fink: after that they wind carelefly about the fpar good ftore of tufted Hemp, and faften the wood to two Cords, one end whereof hangs at the Poop, the other at the Prow of the Veflel. Then letting go the wood with the ftream or current by the fides of the Rock, the Hemp twifts it felf among the Coral, fo that fortietimes they ftand in need of five or fix Boats to pull up the wood again : and if one of the Cables fliould chance to break with the ftrefs all theRowers are in danger to be loft. Whilethey tear up the Coral thus by force, there tumbles as much into the Sea as they fetch up .• and the bottom of the Sea being generally very ouzy, the Coral will be eaten as our fruits are eaten by the worms; fo that the fooner they get it out of the mud, the lefs it will be wa- This puts me in mind, of one thing that I faw at Mar fellies in a Shop Where - 1 ^ n r P? ra ^ was a great piece of Coral, as big about as a man s filt, winch becauie it was a little worm-eaten, was cut in two pieces.

And the Farmers keep guards on both Tides of the fhoar,,in regard the Sea calls it up fometimes upon one fide, and fometimes upon the other, to prevent the Healing of it. -7 Amber is nothing but a certain congelation made in the Sea,like a certain Gum for you lhall find in feveral pieces,Flies,Gnats,and other infedls congeal’d therein. I faw feven or eight Flies, fo congeal'd in one piece. In China, when any great Lord makes a Feait, it is for his Grandeur and Mag. nificence to caufe three or four feveral forts ofPerfuming-pots to be fet upon the Table, and to throw into every one of them a vaft quantity of Amber; for the more, it burns, and the bigger the pieces are, the more magnificent is the Enteiv tainment accounted. The reafon of this cuflom is, bccaufe they adore the fire ^ and befides, that the Amber calls forth a feent pleafing to the Chmfesjhzxthv kind of Oil in it, that flames after a more unufual manner than other materials of fire. This wall of Amber makes it the bell Commodity that could be imported into China the Trade were free for Strangers. At prefent the Hollanders have engrofs’d all this Trade to themfelves, and the Chinefes come all to Bataviai® buy it. As for Amber-grife *, there is no perfonin the World that knows either what it is, or where, or how it is produc’d. But the faireft probability is,that it multbe only in the Eallern-Sea .• though fome parcels have been found upon the Coaft of £ngldnd,%nd in fome other parts of Europe. The greatefl quantity^ found upon the Coaft of Melinda,hut more efpecially in the mouth of a River call'd Bio de Sena. The Governor of Mozambique gets in the three years of his Government above 30000a Pardo’s of Amber-grife, every Pardo containing 27 Sous of our Money. Sometimes they meet with very large and very confiderable pieces. In the year 1-627 a Portugal Getting Sail from Goa to the Manilles, after he had pall the Streight of Malacca, was by tempeft driv’n near an unknown Ifland, where they came to an Anchor. Several of the Ship’s-Company ventring^a-fhore, met with a River j and going to bath themfelves in it, one of them found a great piece 01 Amber-grife that weigh’d thirty-three pounds; but falling together by the ears about their fhares, the Captain, to reconcile them,told them ’twaspitty to deface it, in regard it was a Prefent fit for the Kingand therefore advis’d them to prefent it to the Vice-Roy, who would no doubt reward them for their pains. By that means the Captain got the parcel out of their Clutches, and prefentingit tothj Vice-Roy,got a reward for himfelf % and the Party that found it .* but the reft had' nothing at all. . r In the year 1646 or 1647, a Middkburgher of good quality found a piece or forty-two pounds upon the Coaft of the llland of St. Maurice, where he c on }' nianded for the /M^W-Corapany, Eaft of the Ifland of St. Lawrence, and lent 1 to Batavia: but there being a mark, as if fbme piece of it were broken ofi,t c Zdander, was accus’d to have taken half,, and turn’d out of his Command) wna - ever he could fay to juftify himfelf. ^ ^ «' f ,CHAP. xxir. / ^ ■ . -i ^ . ... ^ N • . / ‘ - \ ■ Of Musk and Bezoar; andjome other Medicinal Stones.

It is ihap’d according to the form of the buds or tops of the branches which the Goats eat.- which is the reafon there are fomany fhap es of Bezoar-Stones.' The Natives, by feeling the belly of the Goat, know how many Stones Ihe has within, and fell the Goat according to the quantity. This they will find out by ilidingtheir hands under their bellies, and then lhaking both fides of the paunch; for the Stones will fall into the middle, where they may eafily count them all by their feeling. The rarity of Bezoar is in the bignefs; though the final 1 Bezoar has.the faint vertue as that which is larger. Bnt there is more deceit in the large Bezoar; for the Natives have got a trick to add to the bignefs of the Stone, with a certain Pafte compos’d of Gum, and fomething elfe of the colour of Bezoar. And they are fo cunning too r to lhape it juft like natural Bezoar. The cheat is found out two ways ^ the firft is by weighing the Bezoar, and then fteepingit in warm wa ter; if neither the water change colour, nor the Bezoar lofe any thing of its weight, the Stone is right. The other way is to thruft a red-hot Bodkin of Iron into the Stone; if the Bodkin enters, and caufes it to fry, there is a mixture. Be- 2oar is dearer according to the bignefs of the Stones,advancing in price like Dia monds. For if five or fix Bezoars weigh an ounce,an ounce will be worth fifteen or eighteen Franks; but if it be a Stone of one ounce, that very ounce is well worth too Franks. I have fold one of four ounces and a half for 2000 Lj- vres. I have been very curious to inform my felf of all things that concern’d the nature of Bezoar ; but could never learn in what part of the body of the Goat it was to be found. One time among the reft,having oblig’d feveral Native Mer chants by putting off for them a great quantity of Bezoar ; upon my requeft, though it be death without mercy to tranfport any of thefe Goats out of the Countrey, they brought me fix Goats by Health to my lodging. When I ask’d the price of them, I was furpriz’d, when they told me one was worth but three Roupies; that the two other were worth four Roupies} and the. three others four and three quarters a piece. I ask’d them why fome were more worth than others ; but 1 found afterwards that the firft had but one Bezoar, that the reft had two,or three, or four. The fix Goats had in all feventeen Bezoars in them, and a half one, as big as the half of a Hazel-nut. The infide was like the foft ordure of the Goat, the Bezoar lyingamong the dung, which is in the belly of the Goat. Some avert’d that they grew right againft the liver, others right againft the heart, but I could never find out die truth. As well in the Eaft, as Weft, there are a great quantity of Bezoars that breed in the fame manner in Cows } of which there have been fome that have weigh’d feventeen or eighteen ounces; For there w&amp;s fuch a one that was giv’n to the Great Duke of Tufcany. But thofe Bezoars are little efteem’d, fix grains of the other Bezoar working more powerfully than thirty of this. As for the Bezoar which breeds in Apes,as fome belive,it is fo ftrong, that two grains work as effedually as fix of Goat’s-Bezoar.- but it is very fcarce, as being only found in thofe Apes that breed in the Ifland ofMacaJfar. This fort of Be zoar is round, whereas the other is of feveral fafhions, as I faid before. As the Apes Bezoar is ftronger, and fcarccrthan the-Goats, fo it is dearer, and more fought after; a piece as bigas a nut,being fometimes worth a hunder’d Crowns The Portugals make great account of this Bezoar, Handing always upon their guard for fear of being poifon’d. There is another Stone in great efteem, that is call’d the Porcupine’s-Stone, which tfiat creature is faid to carry in its head,and is more precious than Bezoar againft poifon. If it be fteep’d in water a quarter ofan hour,the water becomes io bitter,that nothing can be more bitter. There is alfo a Stone fometimes found in the belly of that creature of the fame nature \ and as good as that which comps from the head v neverthelefs with this difference, that being fteep’d in water,it lofes nothing of its weight nor bulk, as the other does. I have bought in my time three of thofe Stones. Oneofthem coftme 500 Crowns, and I exchang e it to advantage. I paid four-hunder’d Crowns for the other, which I kept, tne other was fold me for 200 Crowns, Which I prefented to a friend. ThereTravel; in India* &gt; There is the Serpent-Stone not to be forgot, about the bigneffc of a donblti and fome are almoft oval,thick in the middle, and thin about the fides. The In dians report that it is bred in the head of certain Serpents. But I rather take it to be a Story of the Idoloter’s Priells, and that the Stone is rather a compolition of certain Drugs. Whatever it be, it is of excellent vertue to drive any venom out of thofe that are bit by venomous creatures. If the perfon bit be not much wounded,the place multbe incis’d j and the Stone being appli’d thereto, will not fall off till it has drawn all the poifon to it. To cleanfe it, you mult fteep it ill Womans'milk 5 or for want of that,in Cows-milk; after the Stone has lain ten of twelve hours, the milk will turn to the colour of an Apoftemated matter. The Arch-Bilhop of Goa carrying me to his Cabinet of Rarities, Ihew’d me one of thefe Stones •• and after he had alfur’d me of the rare qualities it had, gave it me. Once as he crofs’d a Merfh in the Ifland of Salfete where Goa ftands, one of the men that carr’d his ^%w,beinghalfnaked,was bit by a Serpent, and heal’d at the fame time. I bought feveral} but there are none but the Bramints that fell them, which makes me believe that they compound them. There are two ways to try whether the Serpent-Stone be true or falfe. The firft is, by putting the Stone in your mouth, for then it will give a leap, aud fix to the Palate. The other is, by putting it in a glafs full of water \ for if the Stone be true, the wa ter will fall a boyling, and rife in little bubbles up to the top of the Glafs. There is another Stone,which is Call’d the Stephen’s-Stone with the hood.This is a kind of Serpent that has sdkind of a hood hanging down behind the head,as it is reprefented in the Figure. And it is behind this hood that the Stone is found, many .times as big as PulletVegg. There are fome Serpents’ both in Afia, and America of a monflxous bignefs, 25 foot long} as was that, the skin whereof is kept in Batavia, which had fwallow’d a Maid of 18 years of age. * Thefe Stones are not fobnd in any of thofe Serpents that are not at leaft two foot long. This Stone being rubb’d againil another Stone , yields another dime , which be ing drank in water by the perfon that has the poifon in his bddy,powerfuly drives it out. Thefe Serpents are no-where to be found but upon the Coafts of Melinde j but for the Stones you may buy them of the BortHgne^e Mariners and Souldiers that come from Mozambique.Travels in I a.

From the Mouth of the River to thofe very places on each fide of the River, great numbers of Negro’s inhabit, which are all commanded by one VortugHez^e. The Vonnguezjes have been Mailers of this Countrey for many years, where they take upon them like Lords, and make War one upon another for the flighteft occafions in the World; fome of them having under them five-thoufand C^/m, which are their Slaves.

The roots of the 1 ree,which were alfo natural,were thick and ihort; thelongeil not exceeding four or five inches. The Natives of Monomctopa knowing the time of the year that the Commo dities arrive, come to SofaU and Chepon-Gowa to furnifh themfelves. Thither alfo come the Csf res of other Provinces and Kingdoms for the fame purpofe. Whereuporntfie Governors of thofe places fell them what they want, trailing them rilfthe next year* when they oblige themfelves to bring their Gold, which they are very pundual to do, for elfe there could be no Trade - between them. The Natives of Mortomotopa never live long, by reafonofthe badnefs of the wa ters in the Countrey / For at the age of five and twenty years they begin to be dropiical ? fo that it is a great wonder if any among them live above forty years. The Province where the River Sene has its head,is call’d Monkfran^td is under the Jurifdi&amp;ion of a certain King, beginning a hunder’d leagues,or there-abouts, above Chapon-Gonra. The people of that Country find great (tore of duft-Gold ill the Rivers that fall into the Sene) but it is much coarferthan the other,though they bring it to Chepon-Goura and Sofala. The Countrey is very healthy,and the people live as long as they do in Europe. Some years there are Cafres that come tan beyond the Province of Monkaran, even as far as the Cape of good Hope. The Pomigaez. have enquir’d after their Countrey, and the name ? but they can tell no more, only that it is call’d Sabia, commanded by a King ? and that they are four months generally travelling to Sofala. The Gold which they bring is very fine, and in pieces like that of Monomotopa^ which they fay they find in the high Mountains, digging only ten or twelve foot in the ground. They alfo bring great quantities of Elephants-teeth ) wherewith, by their report, the Countrey does fo abound, that you may fee them in herds in the fields \ and that all the Palifado’s of their Fortrefles,and the Pales of their Parks,are made of Elephants- teeth. Their ufual Diet is Elephants-fldh ; which four Gafres will kill with their Jgeagdyes, or a fort of Half-pikes. The water of their Gountrey is very bad, which is the reafon that their thighs are fwell’d, and it is a wonder to fee any one of them free. Beyond Sofala there is a Countrey commanded by a King, who is call’d the King of Beroe. In fome parts of his Countrey there grows a Root about an inch- thick, and of a yellow colour. It heals all forts of Fevers, caufing the Patient to vomit. But becaufe it grows very fcarce,the King ftri&amp;ly forbids his Subjects to export it. The tail of it is very bitter upon the tongue. As for Silver-Mines, there are none in all Afia but only in Japon ; but fome years fince, at Dekgora, Sangora^ Bordelon and Bata^ have been difeover’d plenti ful Mines of Tin, to the great damage of the Englifh, there being now enough in Afa of their own befides. CHAP. XXIV. The Relation of a Notable piece of Treachery, whereby the Author was abus’d when he Embark'd at Qomrom fir Surat. I N the Month of April 1665, being ready to depart from Gomrom for Surat, in a Veflel that belong’d to a //b/AW-Broaker,commanded by a i/o/Z^W-Captain, the Englifli Agent gave me a Packet of Letters to deliver to the Prefident at ^ rat ' Packet was large, containing not only the Companies-Letters, but jeveral private Letters to particular perfons at Surat and other parts of India. I his Packet I receiv’d in the prefence of one Cafembrot^ Hollander,who inform’d another whofe name was IVaamcL of it: Thereupon they prefently v - contriv’d \: 1158 Travels in India* contriv’d a defign to feize this Packet, upon the report that ran of the rupture between England and Holland. Cafembrot having feen the bignefs of the Packet gives Wauvouckj* difcription of it, and fb both together they contrive another of the fame form and bignefs as neer as they could. When I came a-board,I took the Engiifo Packet, and lock’d it, up in my Bouceha i: which is the fort of Cloak- bag that is us’d in that Countrey,and laid it behind my BolHer. There were two Shallops fent a-board us, wherein there were fixty bags of Silver,containing f ora e fifty,fome a hunder’d Tomans a piece. Thefe bags they unladed very leifurely to gain time,watching when I would be gone to bed. But when they faw that 1 did not go to reft,the Dutch confulted together,and agreed to let fail a bag oiTomans into the Sea:, and fo came all a-board,fending away a Shallop to Gomron for a Di ver. When Pfound that the Veflel would not fet Sail till two or three hours after day-light, i went to reft,my lying in the fame place,half out,and half with in-fide of my Bolfter .* But when my Servants were gone,and I alone and a-fleep in the Cabin, they cunningly Hole .my Bouccha^ook out the Packet, and left the other which they had counterfeited, in the place *, being only fomany Letters of blanck-paper. Coming to Surat the fixth of May following,! gave the Packet, as I thought, which 1 had receiv’d from the Englijh Agent at Gomm r to two Capuchin-Friers to deliver to the Prefident at Surat. But when the Preli- dent came to open the Packet before fevcral of the Company,there was nothing but white-paper made up in the form of Letters \ which when I heard, too much to my forrow, I underftood the villanous trick that Fan-Wuck had put upon me. 1 wrote a fmart Letter of complaint to the D/tft^-General in Bat avia Jyxxt finding no redrefs, was forc’d to undergo the hard cenfure of the Englijh, who would not permit me to juftify my felf. However, as it is rare to fee treachery go un- puniih’d, the Complotters all dy’d miferably. T'an-Wuck fell into a violent Fe ver, and being charg’d with the theft; thinking to defend himfelf with an equi vocation, that if he took the Cloak-bag, he wifh’d he might dye without {peak ing a word, in three days ended his life juft in the fame manner, and at the fame time that he had imprecated upon himfelf. Bozan his Lieutenant, after 2 great debauch, going to fleep upon the Terrafs of the Cabin, where he lay for coolnefs/there being no baliftersj/rolling and tumbling in his {leep,fcll dowiijand the next day was found dead in the Sea. The Captain,four or five days after his arrival at Surat, being met in the Street by a Mahometan, who was jealous of his Wife, and being miftak’n by him for one among feveral Franks, that had parted him, and kept him from correfting his Wife fbme few days before,was ftabb’d by him in three or four places witha Dagger,and kill’d him out right.

There areTeveral forts of Mahometan Faquirs. The one fort go almoft naked like the Idolatrous Faquirs, having no certain' abode in the world, but giving themfelves up to all manner of unclcannefs. There are others whofe Garments are of fo many different pieces and colours, that a man can hardly tell of what they are made. Thefe Garments reach down to the half Leg, and hide the rags that are underneath. They go generally in Troops; and have their Superior of the Gang, who is known by his Garment, which is generally poorer, and conhfls of mpre patches than the other. Befides, that he draws after him a great Iron Chain, which is ty’d to his Leg, and is about two Ells long, and P|oportionably thick. When he fays his prayers,, he does it with a loud voice, and ratling his Chain all the while, which is accompany’d with an affeded gra vity,, that draws the Veneration of the people. In the mean time the people prepare Dinner for him and his company, in the place where he takes up his Hand, which is ufually in fome ftreet or publick place. There he caufes hij Difciples to fpread certain Carpets, where he fets himfelf down to giveaudi* ence to the people. On the other fide, the Difciples go about publifhing through the Country the vertues of their MaEer, and the favours he receives from God,' who reveals his mofl important fecrets to him, and gives him power to reli eve perfons 5 n afflidion by his counfel. The people, who give credit to him, and believe him to be a holy man, approach him with a great devotion, and when they come near him, they pull off their Shoes, and profhrate them felves to kifs his feet. Then the Faquir, to fhew his humility reaches out his hand to kifs; that done, he caufes them that come to confuk him, to lit down by him, and Hears every one apart. They boafl themfelves to have a prophetick Spirity and above all to teach barren women a way how to have ChildreH, and to be belov’d by whom they pleafe. There are fome of thefe Faquirs who have above two hundred Difciples, or more, which they affemble together by the found of a Horn, or the Beat of a Drum. When they travel, they have their Standard,Lances, and other Wea pons which they pitch in the ground, near to their Mafter, when he repofes i« any place. The third fort of Eaff: Indian Faquirs, are thofe that being born of poor Pa rents, and defirous to underftand the Law, to the end they may become Moaltis or Dodors, retire to thewhere they live upon the Alms which is given them. They employ all their time in reading the Alcoran, which they get by Heart y and if they can but add to that ftudy the knowledg of fome natural things, and an exemplary life withall, they come to be chief of the Mof quees, and to the dignity of Moullahs, and Judges of th^ Law. Thofe FiiqMrs have their Wives; and fome, out of their great zeal to imitate Mahomet, hare three or four} thinking they do God great fervice in begetting many Children to be followers of their Laws. n a dBook III.

Both of them take it for an' Honour to dye in Battel y and let him be Horfe or Foot, that Soldier is accounted infamous that retreats in Fight; ’tis an eternal blot in his Family, tfpon which fubjeft 1 will tell you a ftory. A Soldier who was paffionately in love with his Wife and reciprocally belov’d by her, had fled from the fight, not fo much out of any fear of death, as out of a confideration of the grief which it would oc- ealion to his Wife, fhould he leave her a Widow. When fhe' knew the reafon of his- flight, as foon as he came to the door, fhe fhut it againft him, and or der’d him to be told, that fhe could never acknowledg that man for a Husband, who had preferr d the Love of a Woman before his Honour ^ that fhe did not defire to fee him any more, as being a ftain to the Reputation of her Family j and that fhe would endeavour to teach her Children to have more courage than their Father. The Wife continuing firm to her refolution, the Husband to re gain his Honour and her affe&amp;ion, return’d to the Army, where he fo behav'd himfelf, that he became famous *, and having highly made amends for his Cow- ardife, the door of his Houfe was again fet open, and his Wife receiv’d him with her former kindnefs. The reft of the Natives, that are not reckon’d in the number of thefe Cafes, are cklX&amp; Pauzecour. Thefe are fuch as employ themfelves in Handicraft Trades j among which there is no other diftin&amp;ion, but according to the Trades which they follow 7 from Father to Son. So that a Taylor cannot prefer his Son, but only in his own Calling, though he be never fo rich } nor marry either a Son or Daughter, but to one of his own Craft. By the fame rule, wheji a Taylor dies, all thofe of his own Trade accompany the corps to the place where it is burnt: and the fame praftife is obferv’d in all other Trades. Among the particular Cafes, there is one that goes by the name of Jlecors } whofe employment is only to clean Houfes } for which every Family pays him fomething once a month, according to their proportion and quality. If a perfon of quality in the Indies keeps fifty Servants, let him be Mahometan or Idola ter, there isnot one of them will take a Befome in his hand to fweep the Houfe } for he would think himfelf affronted, it being one of the greateft fcorns you can put upon an Indian, to call him Jllacor. Befides, every one of thofe Servants knows his bufinefs ^ whether it be to carry the pot of Water to drink by the way, or to give his Mafter his Pipe of Tobacco when he calls for it; fo that if the Mafter fhould bid one to do that which the other was ap pointed to do, that Servant would ftand like a Statue, and never make him any anfwer. But for the Slaves, they are oblig’d to do what ever the Maker commands them. Thefe Macors having no other bufinefs but only to make dean the Houfes, eat the feraps of all other Cafes •, and fo without ferupk feed upon any thing. There are none but thofe of this Tribe make ufeof Abes, to carry away the filth of the Houfes into the Field ^ for which reafon noneol the reft of the Indians will fo much as touch that Animal ^ which is quite o- therwife in Perfia, as well for carriage, as to ride upon/ Moreover, there are none of the other Indians, except the Alacors that will eat.

Some fifty years ago, one of the Kings of Ceylan became a ChriHian, and was baptiz’d by the name of John, being call’d before the Emperor Priapen- der. ;But as foon as he had embrac’d the Chrillian Faith,the Princes and Priells of the Country fet up another King in his room. He endeavour’d all he could to bring his people to follow his example } to which purpofe he affign’d to the Father Jefuits, twelve large Villages about Colombo, for the - bringing up the youth of tlie Country in their Colledges} to the end that they being well .inftru&amp;ed,might inltrud others. #or the King made it plain to the Jefuitsfhzt it was impolfible for them fo well to underltand the, Language of the Country, as to be able to preach to the Natives. Befides, that they found the ingenuities of the Youth of Ceylan fo quick and apprehenfive, that they learnt more La tin, Philofophy, and other Sciences in fix months, than the Europeans learnt in a year} and that they put fuch fubtle Queftions to their Mailers, as were be yond imagination. Some years after the King had profefs’d Chriftianity, a witty man of the liland of Ceylan, and a good natural Philofopher, whofe name was Alegamme, Motiar, or the Mailer of the Philofophers, after he had convers’d with the Jefuits and other Religious perfons, was infpir’d to turn Chrillian. Thereupon he went to the Jefuits, and told them, that he defir’d to be a Chrillian } but withall he was very earnelt to know what Jefus Ghrilt had done, and left in writing. They gave him the new Tellament, which he fet himfelf to read with that heed and Itudy, that in lefs than fix months there was hardly a paflage which he could not repeat. After that he again teftifi’d to the Jefuits and o- ther Religious perfons, that he had a great defire to turn Chrillian, in regard he found their Religion to be fuch as Jefus Chrilt had taught y but only he won der d that they themfelves did not follow his example. For that he could ne ver find by his reading, that Jefus ChriR ever took any money of any body; but that they took all they could get, and never baptiz’d nor buri’d unlels they were well paid.

They call him in fome places P^ermejferj.n othersPcrc^Mc/,and Wefimn among the Bramns that inhabit the Coaft of Cormandd. It may be, becaufe they have heard that the Circle is the moll perfed of all Figures, therefore it is that they fay God rs of an Oval Figure 5 for they have in all their Pagods an Oval Flintftone, which they fetch from Ganges, and worfhip as a God. They are fo obftinately wedded to this foolifh imagination that the wifefi: among the Bra- mins will not fo much as hear any argument to the contrary. So that it is no wonder that a people led by fuch blind Guides, Ihould fall into fuch Abylfes of Idolatry. There is one Tribe fo fupedtitious,in reference to that article,that they carry thofe Oval Flints about their Necks, and beat them againft their Breafts, when they are at their devotions. In this dark and lamentable mill of ignorance, thefe Idolaters make their Gods to be born like men, and aflign them Wives, imagining that theirs are the pleafures of men. Thus they take their Ram for a great Deity, in regard of the Miracles which they believe he wrought while he liv’d upon Earth. Ram was the Son of a potent Raja, who was call’d by the name of Deferet, and the moll vertuous of all his Children, which he had by two lawful Wives. He was particular belov’d by his Father, who defign’d him to be his Succefibr. But the Mother of Ram being dead, the Rajas other Wife, who had her Husband entirely at her beck, prevail’d with him to exterminate Ram and his Brother Lokeman from his Houfe, and all his Territories 3 upon whofe exclufion the Son of that Wife was declar’d the Rajas Succeflbr. As the two Brothers were about to be gone, Rams Wife Sira, of whom he went to take his leave, and whom the Idolaters worlhip as a Goddefs, beg’d of him that fhe might not leave him, having made a refo- lution never to forfake him } whereupon they all three went together to feek their fortunes. They were not very fuccefsful at firft j for as they pafs’d through n Wood, Ram being in purfuit of a Bird, Ilray’d from the Company, and was miffing a long time; infomuch that Sita fearing that fome difafter was befall’n him, befought Lokeman to look after him. He excus’d himfelf at firft, by rea- fon that Ram had oblig’d him never to leave Sita alone, forefeeing by a Pro- phetick Spirit what would befall her, fhould fhe be left to her felf. Never- thelefs Lokeman being over perfwaded by the prayers of his fair Siller, went to feek for Ram his Brother } but in the mean time Rhevan another of the 1 - dolaters Gods, appear’d to Sita in the fhape of a Faquir, and beg’d an Alms of her. Now Ram had order’d Sita, that fhe fhonld not flir out of the place where he left herwhich Rhevan well knowing, would not receive the Alms which Sita prefented him, unlefs fhe would remove to another place j which when Sita had done, either out of negligence or forgetfulnefs, Rhevan feizd upon her, and carry’d her into the thick of the Wood, where his Train flay’d for him. Ram at his return miffing Sita, fell into a fwoon for grief, but be ing brought again to himfelf by his Brother Lokeman, they two immediately went together in learch of Sita, who was fo dearly belov’d by her Husband. When the Bramins repeat this Rape of their Goddefs, they do it with tears in their eyes, and great deraonflrations of forrow ^ adding upon this fubjea, an infinite company of Fables more ridiculous, to fhew the great courage 01 Ram in purfuit of the Ravifher. They employ’d all Creatures living upon the difcovery \ but none of them had the luck to fucceed, only the Monkey call a Harman. He crofs’d over the Sea at one Leap, and coming into Rhevans Gar dens, found Sita in the extremity of affli&amp;ion ^ and very much furpriz’d to hearBook II. Travels in India. an Ape fpeak to her in her Husbands behalf* At firft Ihe would not give any credit to fuch an Ambaflador } but the Ape, to Ihew that his Gommiffion was authentick, prefents her with a Ring which her Husband had giv’n her, and that fhe had left behind her among her Furniture. She could hardly however believe fo great a Miracle, as that Ram her Husband Ihould make a Beaft fpeak, to bring her the news of his health, and to teftifie as he did the marks of his affection. But the Ape Harman wrought Miracles himfelf,for being taken for a Spy by fome Rhevans Servants, who therefore would have burnt him, he tnadeufe of the fire which they had prepar’d to burn him, to fet Rhevans Pa lace on fire, which he almolt confum’d to the ground, with all the tatters and rags which were ty’d to his tail and his body. When the Ape had thus done, the better to efcape out of Rhevans hands, he took the fame way he came, and repairing the Sea again at one jump, he came and gave Ram an account of his adventures ^ and told him in what a forrowful condition he had found Sita, who did nothing but mourn by reafon of her abfenfce from her Husband.

Ram and Ska were infinitely overjoy’d at their coming together again, and return’d very great Honours to Harman^ who had done him fo great fervice. As for Rhevan, he fpent all the reft of his days like a poor Faquir y feeing his Country ruin’d by Ram’s Troops, who was refolv’d to be reveng’d for the injury which he had receiv’d } and from this Rhevan it was, from whence that infinite multitude of Faquirs, that fwarm all over India, firft took their Ori ginal.

He found enough to follow him in a courfe of life that gives them fo much liberty^ For being worfhip’d as Saints, they have in their hands all opportunities of doing evil. Thefe Faquirs wander generally in Troops, every one ©f which has a Supe rior. And in regard they are quite naked, Winter and Summer lying upon the hard ground, when it is cold, the young Faquirs, and others that are moft de vout, go in the afternoon to feek for the dungs of Cows and other Creatures, °f which they make their fires. They rarely burn Wood, for fear of killing any living Animal which is wont to breed in it and therefore the Wood where with they burn their dead, is only fuch as has floated long in the Water, which never breeds in any fort of living Creature. The young having got toge ther a good quantity of dung, mix’d with dry turf, make feveral fires, accor ding to the bignefs of the Company; round about every one of which the Fa~ quirs feat themfelves. When they grow fleepy, they lay themfelves upon the ground, fpreading the Afhes abroad which ferve them for a Mattrefs} without any other Canopy than that of Heaven. As for the Faquirs that do Pennance, when they are laid down in the fame pofture as you fee them in the day time, they kindle a good fire on each fide them, for otherwife they would not be able to to endure the cold.

C H A P. VII. Of the Idolaters belief touching the eft ate of the Soul after death, ’Tl S an Article of the Idolaters Faith, that the Souls of Men departing out of ^ the body, are prefented to God ^ who according to the lives which they lead, orders them another body to inhabit. So that one and the fame perfon is born feveral times into the World. And that as for the Souls of wicked and vi cious perfons, God difpofes them into the bodies of contemptable Bealls, fuch as Ailes, Dogs, Cats, and the like } to do Penance for their crimes in thofe infamous Prifons. But they believe that thofe Souls that enter into Cow$ are happy; pre fuming that there is a divinity in thofe creatures. For if a man dye with a Cows-tail in his hand, they fay it is enough to render him happy in the other World. The Idolaters believing thus the tranfmigration of the Souls of men into the bodies ofot'uer creatures, they abhor to kill any creature whatever,for fear they jhould be guilty of the death of fome of their kindred or friends doing Penance in thofe bodies. If the Men in their life-time are famous for their vertuous deeds, they hold that their Souls pafs into the bodies of fome Potent Rajas ; where they enjoy the pleafures of this life in thofe bodies,as the reward of thofe good works which They did. This is the reafon why the Faquirs put themlelves to fuch horrible Penances* but becaufe that all are not able to endure fo much torment in this World,they laaour to fupply the defedl of that cruel Penance by good works. And befides, they charge their Heirs in their. Wills to give Alms to the e BraminsJ:o the end that b/ the powerful effeft of their Prayers, their God may affign them the body of foine Noble Perfonage.Travels in India, In J^uary 1661^ theBroaker belonging to the Holland Company bofe n was Mondas-Tarek, dy’d at Surat. He was a rich Man, and very charitable his Alms very liberally as well to theChrihians as to the Idolaters • The chins at Surat living one part of the year upon theJUce, Butter and Pulfe W&amp; hefentthem. This Banian was not lick above four or five days^ during' u which time, and for eight days more after he was dead,, his Brothers diffributed nine or ten-thoufand Roupies; and in the burning of his body they mix’d Sandal wood, and Lignum-Aloes , with the ordinary wood, believing that by that means the Soul of their Brother tranfmigrating into another body, he would come to be fome great Lord in another Country. There are Lome that are fach fools that they bury their treafure in their life-time, as it is the ufal cuflome ofall the rich Men in the Kingdom of Afen ; to the end that if they fhould be condemn’d to the body of fome poor miferable perfon, they might have wherewithal to fop, ply their neeeffities. I remember one day that I bought in India an Agate Cup half a foot high; he that fold it me, aflur’d me that it had been buried under ground above 40 years, and that he kept it to ferve his occafions after death • but that it was to him a thing indifferent whether he buried his Cup or his Mo ney. In my laft Voyage I bought of one of thefe Idolaters fixty-two Diamonds of about fix grains a-piece ; and while I was wondring to fee fo fair a parcel he told me I needed not to -wonder 5 for he had been fifty years getting them to gether,; to ferve him after his death, but that having occafion for Money, he was forc’d to part with them. This buried treafure Rood the Raja-Seva-Gi in great Read, when he took Arms againR the Great Moguls and the King of Filafour. For that Raja having taken Callian Bi&amp;ndi^ a fmall City in the Kingdom of Fifa- pour, by the advice of the Bramins, who affur’d him he Ihould find great ftore of treafure buri’d, caus’d the greateR part thereof to be demolilh’d ; and found fo much wealth,as to maintain his Army,which was above thirty-thoufand Men. It is impoffible to convince thefe poor Idolaters of their errors j in regard they will hear no reafon, but fubmit themfelves altogether to their old forms and cu* Roms. CHAP. VIIr. Of the Cuftom among the Idolaters to hum the Bodies of their Dead T H E cuRom of burning the Bodies of the dead is very ancient among the Gentiles *, which Ceremony they moR commonly perform by the banks of Rivers, where they wafiuhe dead; which is the laR purgation of them from them fins. Nay,their fuperRition is fo great fometimes,that they will carry the fick perfon, death approaching, to the bank of fome River or Pond, and put his feet in the water. As nature fails, they dip him deeper and deeper,till at length they hold him expiring up to the chin in the River * to the end that the fame time ' that the Soul departs out of the Body, both Body and Soul may be cleans’d from all defilement - 7 and then plunging the newly dead Body over head and ears,they bring it out,and burn it in the place appointed; which is generally neer fome Pa- god. There are fome perfons that make it their bufinefs to fetch Wood,and agree what they lhall have for their pains. An Idolater being dead, all thofe of his Cafle or Tribe affemble together at the Houfe of the deceas’d, and laying the Body upon a Bier cover’d with clean fine Linnen actording to his Quality and ERate, they follow the Bier, which is carri’d by fuch as are appointed for that purpofe to the place where the Body i$ to be burn’d. As they go along they Img certain Prayers to their God, pronouncing feveral times the words Ram, Mm, while another going before the Bier,founds a little Bell,to advertize the living to pray for the dead. The Body being fet down by the bank of the River or Pon ? they firR plunge it into the water, and then they burn it. According to the lity of the deceas’d they alfo mingle with the ordinary wood Sandal-wood, aBook II. Travels in India. i T ether Sweet-woods. But the Idolaters do not only burn the Bodies of the dead, but the Bodies of the living. They fcruple to kill a ferpent, or a loufe, but ac count it a meritorious thing to burn a living Wife with the body of the deceas’d Husband. C H A P. X. How the Wives are lurnt in India with the Judies of their deceas'd Hus hands. I T is alfo an ancient cuftom among Vbt Indians fhaX. the Husband happening todye* the Wife can never marry again. So that as foon as the Man is dead,the Wife retires to bewail her Husband ^ fome days after that, they lhave off her hair * fee lays afide all the ornaments of her apparel j fhe takes off from her arms and legs the Bracelets which her Husband put on whenheefpous’d her,in token of her fnbmifGon, and her bein£ chain’d to him : and all the reft of her life Ihe lives ilighted and difpis’d, and in a worfe condition than a Slave in the very Houfe where Ihe was Miftrefs before. This unfortunate condition caufes them to hate life, fo that they rather choofe to be buri’d alive with the body of their deceas’d Husbands, then to live in the fcorn and contempt of the World. Belides that, the Bramins make them believe, that in dying after that manner, they lhall re vive again with him in another World, with more honour and more advantages than they enjoy’d before. Thefe are the motives that perfwade the Woman to burn with their Husbands} belides that, the Priefts flatter them with a hope, that while they are in the midft of the flames, before they expire, Ram will appear, and reveal wonderful vilions to them; and that after their Souls have tranfmigrated into various Bodies, they fhall at length obtain a high degree ofHonour to eternity. However, there is no Woman that can burn her Husband’s body, till fhe has the leave of the Governor of the place where fhe inhabits, who be ing a Ma~ humtanfind abhorring that execrable cuftom of Self-murder, is very fhy to per mit them. Befides,there are none but Widows that have no children, that lye under the reproach that forces them to violent death. For as for the Widows that have children, they are by no means permitted to burn themfelves; but quite the contrary, they are commanded to live for the education of the chil dren. Thofe Wom^n whom the Governour will not permit to burn themfelyes, fpend the reft of thir lives in doing Penance, and performing works of Charity. Some make it their bulinefs to fit upon the Road to boyl certain Pulfe in water, and to give the liquor to Travellers to drink. Others fit with fire always ready for them to light their Tobacco. Others make vows to eat nothing but the un- digefted grains which they find in Cow-dung. The Governour finding no j)erfwafions will alter the Woman’s refolution,but more efpedally perceiving by the fign which his Secretary makes him,that he had receiv’d the Coin, in a furly manner Ogives the Woman leave, biduing the Devil take her and all her kindred. , _ When they have got this leave,their Mufick begins to ftrike up,and away, they ding to the Houfe of the deceas’d,with Drums beating,and Flutes playing before them j and in that manner they accompany the peffon that is to be burnt, t© the place appointed. All the kindred and friends of the Widow that is to dye,come t° her, and congratulate her for the happinefs fhe is to enjoy in the other World.* and for the honour which the Cafie fhe is of receives by her generous refolution, fhe dreffes her felf as fhe were going to be marri’d, and fhe is conduced in tri umph to the place df execution. F'or the noife is loud of Mufical Inftruments, and Womens Voices, that follow her finging Songs in honour of the miferable creature that is going to dye. The Bramins that accompany her, exhort her to &amp;v r e publick teftimonies of her conftancy and courage .* and many of our Europeans * 2 airsi no Travels in I n d i a, are of opinion, that to take away the fears of deathjWhich naturally terrifiriT manky, the Priefts do give her a certain Beverage to kupify and diforder fenfes, which takes from her all apprehenhon ofher preparations for death 'T for the Bramins interek that the poor miferable creatures fhould continue huh * refolutions j for all their Bracelets as well about their legs as their arn^ the p dents in their ears *, their Rings fometimes of Gold, fometimes of Silver • ( f 1 ' the poor wear only Copper and Tin,) all thefe belong to the Bramim who n* for them among the Afhes when the party is burn’d. 3 raKe I have feen Women burnt after three feveral manners, according to the difF rence of the Countrey. In the Kingdom of Guz.erat, as far as Agra and £&gt; they fet up a little Hut above twelve foot fquare upon the bank of a Pond ’ River. ’Tis made of Reeds, and all forts of fmall Wopd,with which they m ,0r gle certain pots of Oil and other Drugs to make it bum more vehemently Th* Woman is plac’d in the middle of the Hut,in a half-lying-down pokure lean’ 6 her head upon a kind of a wooden Bolker, and reking her back againk’a Piii^ to which the Bramin tyes her about the middle, for fear/he fhould run aw*’ when Ihe feels the fire. In this pokure fhe holds the body ofher deceas’d band upon her knees,chewing Betti all the while •• and when fhe has continu’d i this pokure about half an hour, the Bramin goes out, and the woman bids them fet fire to the Hut} which is immediately done by the Bramins^ and the kindred and friends of the Woman ; who alfo cak feveral pots of Oil into the fire to nut the Woman the fooner out of her pain. After the Woman is burnt,the Bramk fearch the Afhes for all her Bracelets, Pendants and Rings,whether Gold Silver Copper or Tin, which is all free booty to themfelves. ’ * In Bengala they burn the Woman after another fafhion. In that Country Woman muk be very poor that does not accompany the Body of her deceas’d Husband to the Ganges to wafh his Body, and to be wafh’d her felf before fhe is burnt. I have feen dead CarkafTes brought to the Ganges above twenty davs journey off from the place, and fmelt’em to boot; for the feent of them has been intollerably noyfom. There was one that came from the Northern Moun tains neer the Frontiers of the Kingdom of Boutan^ with the body of her Huf- band earn’d in a Waggon ^ fhe travePd twenty days a-foot, and neither eat nor drank for 15 or 16 days together till fhe came to the where after fhe had wafh’d the body that kank abominably, and had afterwards wafh’d her felf fhe was burnt with him with an admirable conkancy. Before the Woman that is to be burnt, goes the Mufick, confiking of Drums, Flutes and Hautboys, whom the Woman in her bek Accoutrements follows, dancing up to the very Funeral-pile upon which fhe gets up, and places hrfr felf as if fhe were fitting up in her Bed • and then they lay a-crofs her the body ofher Husband. When that is done,her Kindred and friends, fome bring her a Letter, fome a piece of Calicut, another pieces of Silver or Copper, and defire her to deliver them to their Mother, or Brother, or tome other Kinfman or Friend. When the woman fees they haveali done, fhe asks the Standers-by three times, if they have nothing more of fer- vice to command her; if they make no anfwer, Ihe ties up all fhe has got in a piece ofTaffata, which Ihe puts between her' own belly, arid the body of her Husband, bidding them to fet fire to dhe Pile} which is prefently done by the Btamns and her Kindred. I have obferv’d, becaufe there is fcarcity of Wood m Bengal that when thefe poor Creatures are half griddl’d, they call their bodies into the Ganges, where the remains are devour’d by the Crocodiles. » tank not forget a wicked cukom practis’d by the Idolaters of Bengala, When a Woman is brought to bed, and the Child will not take to the Teat, they carry it out of the Village, and putting it into a Linnen Cloath,which they lalt n by the four Corners to the Boughs of a Tree, they there, leave it from morning till evening. By this means the poor Infant is expos’d to be tormented by the Crows, inibmuch that there are lome who have their eyes pickt out of their heads: which is the reafbn that in Bengala you fhalllee many of thefe Ido- laters that have but one eye, and fome that have lok both. In the evening they etch the child away, to try whether he will fuck the next night; and if he kill • u teat ’ carr y again to the fame place next morning; which they 0 tor three days together; after which,if the Infant after that refufes 19 fuck,they * believeBook III. Travels in I nd believe him to be a Devil, and throw him into Ganges^ or any the next Pond or River. In the places where the Apes breed, thefe poor Infants are not fo expos’d to the Crows} for where the Ape difcovers a Nell of thofe Birds, he climbs the Tree, and thrown the Neft one way and the Eggs another* Some times fome charitable people among the Tnglijh^ Hollander j, and jPortttgkls^ com- paflionating the misfortune of thofe Children, will take them away from the Tree, and give them good education. All along the Coaft of Cormandel^ when the Womtn are to be burnt with their Husbands, they make a great hole in the ground nine or ten foot deep and twenty-five or thirty foot fquare, into which they throw a great quantity of Wood and Drugs to make the fire burn more fiercely. When the fire is kindled, they fet the body of the man upon the brink j and then prefently up comes the Woman dancing and chewing accompany’d by her Friends and Kindred, with Drums beating, and Flutes founding. Then the Woman takes three turns round the hole, and every time fhe has gone the round, Ihe kifles her Friends and Kindred. After the third time the Bramins calls the Carcafs ofher Husband into the flame j and the woman Handing with her back to the fire, is pufht in by the Bramirn alfo, and tumbles backward. Then her Kindred and Friends call Oil and other combullile Drugs upon the fire, to make it burii more vehemently, that the Bodies may be the fooher con* fum’d. In moll places upon the Coaft of Cortnandel^ the Women are not burnt with their deceas’d Husbands, but they are buried alive with them in holes which the Bramins make a foot deeper than the tallnefs of the man and wo man, Ufually they chufe a Sandy place \ fo that when the man and woman are both let down together, all the Company with Baskets of Sand fill up the hole above half a foot higher than the furface of the ground, after whiola they jump and dance upon it,till they believe the woman to be flifl’d. When fome of the Idolaters upon the Coall of Cormandel are upon the point of death, their Friends do not carry them to the fide of a River or Lake to cleanfe their Souls, but they carry them to the fattefl Cow they can find ^ and laying the fick party juft behind the Cow, they lift up her Tail, and pro voke her to pifs. If fhe pifs, fo that it falls upon the face of the fick party, all the Company are overjoy’d, faying, that his Soul is happy. But if the Cow do not pifs, to walh the fick parties face, they burn him with a great deal of fadnef's.

IX. / Of the mojl celebrated Pagods of the Idolaters in India. / v- - ;■ • - 31 : V-. / ; : V -- . H E Indian Idolaters have a great number of Temples, fmall and great which they call Bagods, where they pray to their Gods, and make their Offerings. But the poor people that live in the Woods and Mountains,and re mote from Towns, are contented only with lome Hone, whereon they make a rude kind of Nofe, and paint it with Ibme Vermillion colour, which ferves all the whole neighbourhood to worfhip.’ The four moll: celebrated Pagods, are Jagrenate, Banarons- Matara^ and Tri- im. ^ * , Jagrenate is one of the mouths of Ganges, whereupon is built the Great Pa- god, where the Arch Bramin^ or chief Priefl: among the Idolaters keeps his refidence. The great Idol that Hands upon the Altar in the innermofi: part of the Paged, has two Diamonds for his Eyes, and another that hangs about his Keck, the leaf!; of thofe Diamonds weighing about forty Carats. About his Arms he wears Bracelets fometimes of Pearls, and fometimes of Rubies ; and this magnificent Idol is call’d Refora. The Revenues of this Pagod are fuffi- cient to feed fifteen or twenty thoufahd Pilgrims every day } which is a' nura- oer often feen there, that Pagod being the greatelt place of devotion in all In-- ut. But you mult take notice, that no Goldfmith is fuffer’d to enter this Pagod, becaule that one of them being lock’d in all night long, Hole a Diamond out o one of the Idols eyes. As he was about to go out, when the Pagod was opend in the morning, he dy’dat the door; their God, as they affirm, re- enging his own facriledg.That which renders this Pagod, which is a large build- 8 molt confiderable in all India, is, becaufe it is fituated upon the Gan- the Idolaters believing that the waters of that River have a particular 4 ity p) cleanfe them from their fins. That which makes it fo rich ( for it twent 7 thoufand Cows ) is the vafi: Alms that are continually oeitow d. by fo incredible a multitude as comes from all parts. Which Alms ^enotio much^at the diferetion of the Donor, the Will of the chief Pricft,Travels in India. Part H. Prieft, who before he gives them leave to fhave and wafh in t them according to their quality, of which he has informationv Thus h e ^ lefts vafts fums, of which he makes little or no profit himfelf y all going to the poor, and the repair of the Pagod. The chief Bramin canfes Vidua) T be dillributed to the Pilgrims every day; as Milk, Rice, Butter and Wheat ° but to the poor, who want wherewithal! to cook it, they diftribute their M ready drefst. In the morning they boil a quantity of Rice in Earth’n m of different bignefs y and at the hour when the Pilgrims come for their nlea/ the chief Bramin orders another Bramin to take a pot of boil'd Rice; this iW he lets fall *, and if there be five, the pot breaks into five equal parts/ and eve ry one takes his own fbare. And in the fame manner he breaks it into more pieces, if there be more perfons, to whom he is to diftribute the food. Which is a thing very ftrange and worthy obfervation. They never boil twice in an Earthen pot, but ill a Copper pot y nor have they any other Diihes* than only certain Leaves, which they fallen together, and a Certain kind ofa Bafon a- bout a foot in compafs, wherein they melt their Butter, and ftir the Rice with the ends of their fingers when they eat. They have alfo a kind of a Shell wherein they pour their melted Butter, which they will fwallow down as J do Sack. Now for the defcription of a particular Idol which Rands upon the Altar in the Pagod of Jagnnate : It is cover’d from the Shoulders downward with a great Mantle that hangs down upon the Altar. This Mantle is of Tiffueof Gold or Silver, according to the Solemnities. At firR it had neither feet nor hands \ but after one of their Phropets was taken up into Heaven, while they were lamenting what to do for another, God fent them an Angel in the like- nefs of that Prophet, to the end they might continue their Veneration toward him. Now while this Angel was bufie in making this Idol, the people grew fo impatient, that they took him out of the Angels hands, and put him into the Pagod, without hands or feet} but finding that the Idol appear’d in that manner too deform’d, they made him hands and arms of thofe fmall Pearls which we call Ounce-Pearls. As for his feet, they are never feen, being hid un der his Cloak. There is no part op’n but his hands and feet; the head and body being of Sandal-wood } round about the Dmm, under which this Idol Rands, being very high, from the bottom to the. top, are only Niches fill’d With other Idols ; the greateR part whereof reprefent moR hideous Mongers, being all of different colours. On each fide of this Pagod, there Rands ano ther much lefs, where the Pilgrims make their leffer Offerings. And fome that have in ficknefs, or upon bufinefs made any Vows to any Deity, bring thi ther the refemblance thereof in remembrance of the good which they have re ceiv’d. They rub this Idol every day with fweet Oils, that make it of a blsck colour. And at the right hand of this Idol fits his SiRer, who Rands upon her feet, and is well clad, being call’d by the name Sotorn ; upon his left, fends his Brother, cloath’d all over alfo, whom they call Balhadar. Before the Idol, fomewhat toward his left hand, Rands the Idols Wife upon her feet, allofmafiy Gold, by the name of Bemin ; whereas the other three, are only of Sandal wood. The other two Pagods are appointed for the refidence of the chief Brmw, and other Bramim that officiate in the great Pagod. All thefe Bramins go with their heads bare, and for the' moR part fhav’d ; having no other Cloathes but only one piece of Calicut, with one half whereof they cover their bodies \ the other part ferves them inRead of a Scarf. Neer the Pagod Rands the Tomb of one of their Prophets, whofe name was Cabir, to whom they give great honour. You are to take notice alfo, that their Idols Rand upon a kind of Altar encompafs’d with Iron Bars. For no perfons are to touch them, but only certain Bramins^ appointed for that fervice by the chief Bramin* Next to that of 'Jagrenate, the moR famous Pagod is that of Banaronsyte* ing alfo feated upon the Ganges^ in a City that bears the fame name. That which is moR remarkable is, that from the Gate of the Pagod to the there is a defeent all of Stone } neer to which are certain Platforms, and mu blind Chambers, fome of the lodging, others where they 1 dreRBook III. Travels in India. vidtuals; for fo foon as the Idolaters have faid their Prayers,and made their Of ferings,they drefs their food,not fuffering any perfon to touch it but themfelves, for fear left any unclean perfon Ihould come neer it. But above all things, they paffionately defire to drink of Ganges water} for as often as they drink it, they are waflftd, as they believe,from all their fins. Great numbers of thefe Eramins go every day to the cleaneft part of the River, where they fill their little round earthen-pots full of water,the mouths whereof are very fmall, and contain every one of them a Bucket-full. Being thus fill’d they bring them before the great prieft, who covers them with a fine piece offlame-coloufd Calicut,three or four times doubl’d, to which he fets his Seal. The Eramins carry thefe pots, lome fix of them ty’d together with fix little cords faften’d to the end of a ftick as broad as a lath, ihifting their Ihoulders often j travelling fometimes three or four hunder’d leagues with thofe precious burthens up into the Countrey. Where they fell it, or prefent it; but that is only to the rich, from whence they expert great rewards. There are fome of the Idolaters, who when/ they make any great Feaft, especially when they marry their children, will drink four or five hunder'd Crowns in this water. They never drink of it till the end of their meals * and then a glafs or two according to the liberality of the Mafter of the Feaft.The chief reafon why they efteem the water otGanges fo highly, is, becaufe it never putrifies, nor engenders any Vermin} though I know not whether they may be beliefM,confidering the great quantity of dead bodies which they fling into the Ganges. The body of the Pagod of Banarous is made like a Grofs, as are all the reft: of the Pagods, the four parts whereof are equal. In the midft there is a Cupola rais’d very high, the top whereof is pyramidal \ at the end alfo of every four parts of the Crofs there is a Tower, to which there is anafeent on the out-fide* Before you come to the top, there are feveral Balconies and Niches wherein to take the frelh air .* and round about are figures of all forts of creatures, but very Lend work. Under the Dwmojn the middle of the Pagod there is an Altar,like a Table, eight foot long, and fix foot broad, with two fteps before, that ferve for afootftool, which is cover’d fometimes with a rich Tapeftry, fometimes with Silk, fometimes with Cioath of Gold or Silver, according to the folemnity of their Feftival. Their Altars are cover’d with Cioath of Gold or Silver, or elfe with fome painted Cali cuts. Approaching the entry of the Pagod, you fee the Altar right before ye, together with the Idols which are upon it. For the Wo men and Virgins worihip without, not being permitted to enter the Pagod, no more than is a certain Tribe which is among them. Among the Idols that ftand upon the great Altar, there is one plac’d upright fome five or fix foot high ^ but I you can fee neither arms, Uor legs,nor body: nothing appears but the head and ' neck,all the reft being cover’d down to the Altar with a Robe that fpreads itfelf below. Sometimes you fhall fee the neck fet out with fome rich Chain either of Gold,Rubies,Pearls or Emraulds. This Idol was made in honour and likenefs of j Bawma-don, who was heretofore a very great and holy Perfonage among them, whole name they oft’n have in their mouths. Upon the right-fide of the Altar Hands the figure of a Chimera, part Elephant, part Horfe, part Mule. It is of mafllve Gold, and they call it Garoujiot fuffering any perfon to approach it but the Bramins. They lay it is the refemblance of the Beaft which earn’d that holy perfon when he liv’d upon earth. And that he travell’d long journeys upon his back, to fee if the people remain’d in their duty,and whether they did no wrong one to another. Between the great Gate and the great Altar upon the left-hand, there is a little Altar,upon which there Hands an Idol of black Marble fitting crofs- legg’d,about two foot high. While I was there, a little Boy who was the Son of the High-Prieft flood upon the left-fideof therAltar,and all the people threw him certain pieces of TafFata,or imbroider’d Calicut,like Handkerchiefs,all which he return’d to the people again after he had wip’d them upon the Idol. Others threw him Bracelets of Coral, others of yellow-Amber, others threw him fruits and flowers ^ whatever they threw him, he rubb’d it upon the Idol,put it to r ls lips, and then reftor’d it to the people. This Idol is call’d Mofli-Ram^ that ls t0 la Y Cod-Morli, and was the Brother of him that ftands upon the great Al* tar* 175 Undet—. .... . -—- \ ij6 Travels in I n d i a.

I faw two of the children of that Prince there at School, who had for their Mailers feveral Bu mins, whotrught them to write and read in a language peculiar to the Idolaters Priefts,and far different from the fpeech of the common people. Entring into the Court of that Colledg, and calling my eyes up, I difeover’d two Galleries that went round the Court, where I faw the two Princes fitting, attended by feveral petty Lords and Bramins, who made feveral Mathematical Figures upon the ground with chalk. The two Princes feeing me, fent to know who I was • and * underftanding that I was a Frank, they fent for me up, and ask’d me feverai quell ions touching Europe, and particularly touching France. Whereupon there being two Globes in the room which the Hollanders had giv’n the Hamms 1 Ihew’d the Princes where France lay upon one of them. After Ihad taken leave; I ask d one of the Bramins when I might fee the Pagod open .• he anfwer’d me the next morning before Sun-rifing. When I came there,lobferv’d before the door,a Gallery fupported with Pillars, where there was already a great crowd of men, women and children expecting when the Pagod would be open’d. By and by, the Gallery , and a great part of the Court being full, there came eight Bm- mns, tour of each fide of the Gate, with every one a Cenfer in his hand,follow’d by a rabble of other Bramins that made a hideous noife with Drums and other In- ftruments. The two eldeft of the Bramins ling a Song •, and then all the people falling into the tune,falla finging and playing,with every oneaPeacock’s-tail,or iome other kind of liable, to drive away the flies, that the Idol may notbe an- &gt;J 0 ]f u w “ en J^ eyr °P n t ^ le Pa S od - fanning,and the Mulick, laftedagood nait hour.

Upon her right-hand Ihe has a child made like a great Ct® pd, which they call the God La-kgmin; and in her left-arm a little Girl, which they call the Goddefs Sit a. So foon as the Pagod was open.and that a great Cur- tam was drawn, the people,who perceiv’d the Idol,fell upon the ground, laying Weir hands upon their heads,and proffrating themfelves threetimes. Thenrifing Wfy threw great quantities ofNofegays andGar lands to the Prielts: with which thetouch’d the Idol,and then reftor’d themagain.Before the Alter flood a who held in his hand a lamp of nine wieks lighted,upon which he call Incenle every foot, land then held it to the Idol.

The hinder-part is clos’d with a clofe Balifter of Stone- Pillars five or fix inches in Diameter, into which, as into a kind of SaAm Santtorum^ none but the Bramins are permitted to enter .* but for Money, I got in, and law’ a fquare Altar fome fifteen or flxten foot from the door co ver’d with an old Tiffue of Gold and Silver, upon which Hood the great Idol, which they call Ram^ Ram. You lee nothing but his head, which is of a very black Marble, with two Rubies inflead of eyes. All the body, from the fhdul- ders to the feet, is cover’d with a Robe of Purple-Velvet, with fome fmall embroidery. There are two other Idols of each fide of him two foot high, ap- parrell d in the fame manner } only their faces are white, which they call Btc* chor. There I law a Machine fixteen foot Iquare, and between twelve and fifteen foot high ^ cover’d with painted Calicuts, reprefentingthe fhapesofDe- vils. This Machine running upon four Wheels, they told me, was a moving Altar, upon which they earn’d their great God in Proceffion to vifit the other Gods, as alfo to the River, whither all the people went upon their great Fefti- val. The fourth Pagod is that of Tripeti, in the Province of Carnatica,toward- the Coafl of Coromandel, 2nd Cape Comorin. I law it as I went to Majlipatan. It is a Pagod to which there belong a great number of little lodgings for the Bramins: lb that altogether it feems to be a great Town. There are feveral Ponds round about it; but their fuperflition isfo great, that no Pallenger dare take any water out of them, but what the Bramin gives him.Book III. Travels in India. chap, xii r. Of the Pilgrimages of the Idolaters to their Pagods. A LL the Idolaters under the Dominion of the Great Moguls and other Princes, both on this fide and beyond Ganges^ at leaft oncfe^in’thdr lives go in Pilgrimage to one of thefe Pagods that I have nam’d ^ but moft gene rally to that of Ingnnate, as being the firft and moft confiderable above all the reft. The Bramins and rich people go oftner. For fome go every four years, fome every fix, or eight} and putting the Idols of their Pagods upon Pallekies &gt; cover’d with Tifliies, they travel with their Bramins^ as it were in procdfion to the Paged which they moft efteem. They go not in Pilgrimage, one by one, or two and two, but whole Towns, and many times feveral Towns together. The poor that go a great way,, are fupply’d by the rich ; who fpend very freely in fuch ads of Charity. The rich travel in Pallekies or Chariots, the poor on foot,or upon Oxen j the Wife carrying the Child, and the man the Kitchin Implements. The Idol which they carry in proceffion, by way of vilit, and out of refpeft to the great Ram-Ram^ lies at length in a rich Palleky, cover’d with Tiffue of Gold and Silver, fring’d as richly 5 the Mattrefs and Bolder being of the fame fluff under the head, feet, and elbows. The Bramins alfo diftribute Fla- bels to the moft confiderable of the Company,the handles whereof being eight foot long, are plated with Gold and Silver. The Flabel being three foot in Dia meter, of the fame Tilfue as the Pallekies} round about, it is adorn’d with Peacocks Feathers to gather more wind, and fometimes with Bells to make a kind of tingling. There are fix of thefe Flabels ufually employ'd to keep off the Flies from their God} the better fort taking it by turns, that the honour of waiting upon their God may be more equally fiiar ’d. CHAP. XIV. Of divers Cufioms of the Indian Idolaters. HTHE Bramins are well skill’d in Aftrology} and will exa&amp;ly foretell to the peo- pie the Eclipfes of the Sun and Moon. The fcond oi jdy idtf6,about one a Clock in the afternoon, at Patna in Bengala, there was an Eclipfe of the Sun ; at which time it was a prodigious thing to'fee the multitudes of people, men, women, and children, that ran to the River Ganges, to walh them- felves. But it behoves them to begin to walh three days before the Eclipfe} all which time they labour day and night in providing all forts of Rice Milk, Meats, and Sweatmeats, to throw to the Filh and Crocodiles, as foon as the Bramins give the word* Whatever Eclipfe it be whether of the Sun or Moon, the Idolaters as foon as it appears, break all their Earthen Pots and Dilhes in the, houfe, which makes a hideous noife altogether/ Every Bramin has his ^ Magick Book, wherein are abundance of Circles and Semicircles, Squares, 1 riangles, and feveral forts of Cifers. They alfo make ieveral Figures upon the ground, and when they find that the good hour is come, they cry aloud to the people to feed the filh. Then there enfiies a moit horrible Din of Drums,Bells,and great noife of founding Mettal,which they wang one againft another. And as foon as the victuals are thrown into the Ri ver , the people are to go in and wafli and rub themfelves till the Eclipfe be o- ver. So that in regard the waters were at that time very high,for more than three Leagues above and below theJGity, and all the breadth of the River, there *Aa?, wasT«apni tttg • ~ 80 Travels v;as nothing to be feen but the heads of the people. As for the Bramim th Itay alhore to receive the richer fort, and thofe that give moll • to dry th? bodies and ter give them dry Linnen to their bellies. Afterwards they cauf them to fit down in a Chair, where the moft liberal of .the Idolaters have rJf vided Rice, Pulfe, Milk, Butter, Sugar, Meal, and Wood. Before the Chair th' Bramin makes a place very clean about live foot fquare ; then with Cow-dui? fteep’d in a kind of yellow Bafon,he rubs all the place, for fear any Emet Ihould come thereto be burnt. For indeed they would never make ufe of Wood if they could help it; and wheil they do, they are very careful that there be no Worms or Infedts in it. In the place which they have thus cleans’d, they draw feveral Figures, as Triangles, Ovals, Half-Ovals, &amp;c. Then upon every Figure they lay a little Cows-dting, with two or three fmall Hicks of Wood, up on every one of which they lay a feveral fort of Grain ^ after that pouring Butter and fetting fire to each} by the fmoak which rifes, they judg of the plenty of every fort of Grain that year. y When the Moon is at the full in March^ they keep a folemn Feftival for their Idol, which is in form of a Serpent. This Feftival continues nine dayes •, and when it comes, they do nothing but make Holiday all the while, as well men as beafts, which they beautifie by making Circles about their eyes with Ver million, with which they alfo colour the Horns ; and if they have a particular kindnefs for the beaft, they hang them with Leaves of Guilded Tin. Every morning they worlhip the Idol, and the Maids dance about it for an hour to the nbile of Fluits and Drums j after which they eat and drink and are merry till the evening, and then they worlhip and dance about their Idol again. Though the Idolaters never drink any ftrong drink at other times, yet at this Feftival they drink Palm-wine, and ftrong water, which is made of the fame in remote Villages } Tor elfe their Mahometan Governour would not fuffer them to make Wine, nor to fell any which might be brought out of lerfia. Their ftrong Water is thus made .* They take a great Earthen pot, well glaz’d within, which they call Manavane } into one of thefe Veflels, that holds three hundred Vans pints, of Vdma-win^ they put in fifty or fixty pound of brown Sugar unrefin’d, which looks like yellow Wax ; with about twenty pound ofa great thick bark of a Thorn, not much unlike that which our Leather-dreflers* ufe. This bark fets the Palma-wine a bubling and working juft like our new wines, for five or fix days together, till it becomes ef a fweet Liquor, as fowre as our Crabs. Then they diftill it, and according to the tafte they would give, they either put into a Cauldron full, a little Bag of Mace, or three or lour handfuls of Annife-feed. They can make it alfo as ftrong as they pleafe. Being at u 4 gra in the year 1642, an Idolater, whofe name was Woldas, Brea ker to. the Hollanders^ about feventy years of age, receiving news that the chief Bramin at the Pagod of Mamra was dead, went to the Hollander 2nd defir’dhim to even all accounts j for faid he, the chief Prieft being dead, it behoves me to dye, that I may ferve him in the other world. Thereupon having ended his accounts, he took' his Coach, with fome of his Kindred \ but having neither eaten nor drank from the time he receiv’d the news,-he dy’d by the way j having famifh’d himfelf for grief. The Indian Idolaters have a cuftom, that when any perfon gives a thing, they.fhap their fingers, crying out, Gi-Narami r remember Narami, who was a great Saint among them, for fear the Evil Spirit, Ihould enter into the body of him that gives. Being at Surat in the year 1653,3 Bafpoute being demanded Cuftom for three or four pieces of Calicut, boldly ask’d theGoveniour,whetheraSoul- dier th&amp;t had ferv’d the King all his life-time, ought to pay Cuftom for two or three pitiful pieces of Calient, not worth four or five Roupies} telling him it was only to cloath his Wife and Children. The Governour netl’dathis faweinefs, call’d him Bethico^ or Son of a Whore 5 adding,that if he were Prince he would make him pay his Cuftoms. Whereupon the Souldier incens’d at the affront, making as if he felt for Money to pay his dues, bearing up to the Go vernor, ftab’d him in the belly, fo that he dy’d immediately. Butthe Soul- di^r was prefently cut in pieces by the Governors Servants. ^Book III. TraveCf in I n d i a. Though the Idolaters are in utter darknefs as to the knowledg of the tru, God, however the Law of Nature teaches them Morality in many things. When they are married they are feldom falfe to their Wives. Adultery is very rare among them. And as for Sodomy I never heard it mention’d* They marry their Children between feven and eight years old, for fear they Ihould fall into that vice} the Ceremonies whereof are thefe .* The day'before the Nuptials, the Bridegroom, accompany’d by all his Kindred, goes to the Houfe where the Bride lives, with a great pair of Bracelets, two fingers thick, hollow within, and in two pieces, with a hinge in the middle to open them* According to the quality of the Bride thofe Bracelets are of more or lefs value, fometimes of Gold, fometimes of Silver, Tin, or Latten, the poorelt fort of all making ufe of Lead. The next day there is a great Feaft at the Bridegrooms Houfe, whi ther all the Kindred on both hdes are invited, and about three a Clock in the afternoon the Bride is brought thither. Then the chief of the Bramim that are there , of which there are always feveral laying the head of the Bride to the Bridegrooms, pronounces feveral words, fprinkling their heads and bo dies all the while with water. Then they bring him upon Plates or Fig-leaves feveral forts of Meats, Calicuts, and Stuffs ^ and then the Bramm asks the Bridegroom, whether fo long as God fhall make him able, he will let his Wife fhare with him, and whether he will endeavour to maintain her by his labour. If he fays yes, they all let themfelves down totheFeafl prepar’d for them, where every one eats by himfelf. If the Bride be rich, and be acquainted among the Nobility, their Weddings are very pompous and expenfive. The Bridegroom is mounted upon an Elephant, and the Bride rides in a Chariot ^ the whole Company carrying Tqrches in their hands. They alfo borrow of the Governour and the Nobility of the place, as many Elephants and prancing Horfes as they can get. And they walk fome part of the night with Fire works, which they throw about the Streets and Piazza’s. But the greateft expence to thofe that live three or four hundred Leagues from it,is to get, the wa ter of Ganges } for in regard they account that water facred, and drink it out of devotion, it mull be brought them by the Bramins^ and in Earthen Veffels, glaz’d within fide, which the chief Bramin of Ingrenate fills himfelf with the , pureft Water of the River, and then feals up with his own Seal. They never drink this water till the end of the Feaft, and then they give their guefts three or more glafles apiece. This water coming fo far, and the chief Bramin de manding a Tribute for every pot, which contains a Pail-full, fometimes a wed ding comes to two or three thoufand Roupies. The eighth Of Ayril, being in a City of Bengala call’d Malde^ the Idolaters made a great Feaft, according to the particular Cuftom of that place } they all go out ,of the City, and fallen Iron hooks to the boughs of feveral Trees, then come a great number of poor people and hang themfelves, fome by the fides, fome by the brawn of their backs, upon thofe hooks, till the weight of their body tearing away the flefh, they fall of themfelves. ’Tis a wonderful thing to fee that not fo much as one drop of blood Ihould ifiiie, from the wounded flelh, nor that any of the flefii Ihould be left upon the hook; befides, that in two days they are perfe&amp;ly cur’d by fuch Plailters as their Bramins give them. There are others who at that Fealt will lye upon a bed of nails, with the points upward, the nails entring a good way into the flelh •, however’while thefe peo ple are under this Pennance, their Friends come and prefent them with Money and Linnen. When they have undergone their Penance, they take the prefents and diftribute them to the poor, without making any farther advantage of them. 1 ask’d one, why they made that Feaft, and fulfer’d thofe fevere Pe nances ; who anfwer’d me, that it was in remembrance of the firlt man, whom they call’d Adam^ as we do. In the year i 66 &lt; 5,1 faw another fort of Penance, as I crofs’d the Ganges } upon the Bank of which River they had prepar’d a clean place, where o‘ne of the poor Idolaters v/as condemn’d to reft upon the ground, touching it only TOh his hands and feet ^ which he was to do feveral times a day, and every time to kifs the earth three times before he rofe up again. He was to rife up ttpon his left foot, never touching the ground with his right all the while. And &lt; / .' everyTravels in India. Part II. every day for a month together before he either eat or drank he was oblig'd to this pofture for fifty times together, and confequently to kifs the ground a hundred and fifty times. He told me that the Bramm had enjoin’d him that Penance becaufe he had fuffer’d a Cow to dye in his Houfe, and had not lead her to the water to be wafh d before fhe dy cl. When an Idolater has 5 loft any piece of Gold or Silver, or fumm of Money either by negligence, or as being ftoln from him, he is oblig’d to carry as much as he loft to the great Bratnin ; for if he does not, and that the other Ihould come to know of it, he is ignominioufty caft out of his Tribe, to make him more careful another time. / On the other fide the Ganges Northward, toward the Mountains of 2 V^ 0 . cor, there are two or three Raja’s^ who neither believe God nor the Devil.- Their Bramins have a book containing their Belief, full of ridiculous abfurdi- ties, whereof the Author whofe ndme is Baudot gives no reafon. Thefe Rajas are the Great Moguls Vaflals, and pay him Tribute. To conclude, the M^lavares carefully preferye the nails of their left hands and let their hair grow like women’s. Thefe nails,which are half a finger long, Verve them inftead of Combs } and it is with their left hand that they do all their drudgery, never touching their faces, nor what they eat, but with their right hands. C H A P. XV. Of the Kingdom of Boutan whence comes the Musk^ the good Rhu* larly and fome Furs. ... • - 1 ' ■ ■ -/-* -S • j; - •' : r; , ^ ' 1 . ■. k ‘ 1 , . '' , ' ' t : ' ' - HT H E Kingdom of Boutan is of a large extent * but I could never yet come JL toaperfed knowledg thereof. I have fet down all that I could learn at Patna, whither the Merchants of Boutan come to fell their Musk. The moft excellent Rhubarb comes alfo from the Kingdom of Boutan. From hence is brought alfo that Seed which is good againft the worms, therefore call’d Wormfeed} and good ft ore of Furs. As for the Rhubarb, the Merchants run a great hazard which way foever they bring it; for if they take the Northern Road, toward Caboul y the wet fpoilsit; if the Southern Road, in regard the journey is long, if the Rains happen to fall, there is as much danger that way, fo that there is no Commodity requires more care than that. \ As for the Musk, during the heats the Merchant lofes by i,t, becaufe it dries and lofes its weight. Now in regard this Commodity pays twenty-five in the hundred Cuftom at Gorrochepour, the laft Town belonging to the Great Mogul, next to the Kingdom of Boutan, when the Indian Merchants come to that City, they go to the officer at the Cuftom-Houfe, and tell him that they are going to Boutan, to buy Musk or Rhubarb, and how much they intend to lay out \ all which the Officer regifters, with the name of the Merchant. Then the Merchants inftead of twentyffive, agree with him for feven or eight in the hundred, and take a Certificate from the Officer or Cadi, that he may not de mand any more at their return. If the Officer refufes a handfom compofition, then they go another way, over Defarts and Mountains cover’d with Snow, tedious and troublefome, till they come to Caboul, where the Caravans part, ' fome for great Tartary, others for Belch. Here it is that the Merchants coming from Boutan barter their Commodities for Horfes, Mules,and Camels j for there is little Money in that Country. Then thofe Tartars tranfport their Commo dities into Perfia, as far as Ardevile and Tauris ; which is the reafon that fome Europeans have thought that Rhubarb and Wormfeed came out ofT^O'- True it is, that fome Rhubarb comes from thence;, but not fo good ssta of Boutan, being fooner corrupted \ for Rhubarb will eat out its own heart. e Tartars carry back out of Perfia Silks of Small v^lue, which are made inBook II. Travels in India. and Jr dev lie ^ and fome Engli jlj Cloth brought by the Armenians from Confirm- tinofie and Smyrna. Some of the Merchant? that come from Cabonl and /?o«.. tan go to Candahar 7 and thence to Iff ah m • whither they car ry Coral in Beads* yellow Amber, and Laps Lazuli Beads, if they can meet with it. The other Merchants that come from the Coaft of filultan^ Labor y and Agra :) bring only Linnons, Indigo, and Bore of Cornelian and Chriffcal Beads. Thofe that return through Gorrcchepour^ and are agreed with the Officer of the Cuftom-Houfe, carry from Patna au«d J&gt;aca 9 Coral, yellow Amber, Bracelets of Tortoife~ffiells ; and other Shells, with great ftore of round and fquare thick pieces of Tor- tois. When I was at Patna^ four Armenians who had been before at Boutan 7 return’d from , where they had made certain Figures of yellow Am ber, reprefenting the (napes of feveral Creatures and Monfters, which they were carrying to the King of Bout an, who is an Idolater, as are all his people, to fet up in his Pagods. For the Armenians for Money will fell any thing of Ido latry } and they told me befides, that if they could but have made the Idol which the King of Boutan befpoke of them, they fhould have done their buh- nefs. Which was to have been a Mongers head, with fix horns, four ears, four arms, and fix fingers upon every hand, all of yellow Amber j but they could not find pieces big enough. The Caravan is three months travelling from Patna, to the Kingdom of Boh- um It fets out from Patna about the eud of December, and eight days after arrives at Gorrochepour. YxomGorrochepoHr to the foot of the high Mountains, is eight or nine days journey more,during which the Caravan Puffers very much hardlhip, for the Country is nothing but wild Forrefls, full of wild Elephants. So that the Mer- ebants, infiead of taking their refts, are forc'd to watch, keep fires, and fnoot off their Muskets all the night long. For the Elephant making no noife in tread ing, would elfe be upon the Caravan before they were aware} not that he comes to do any mifchief to the men, but to get what victuals he can find. You may travel from Patna to the foot of thofe Mountains in Palleki’s. But gene rally they ride upon Oxen, Camels, or Horfes, bred in the Countrey. Thofe Horfes are generally fo little, that when a man is upon the back of them, his feet touch the Ground ^ but they will travel twenty Leagues an end, and never bait, or elfe with a very fmall one. Some of thofe Horfes coft two hundred Crowns ^ for indeed when you come to crofs, the Mountains, you can make ufe of no other fort of carriage but them in regard of the narrownefs and rug- gednefsofthe Paifes; which many times put the Horfes very much to it, as firong and as low as they are. Five or fix Leagues beyond Gorrochepour you enter into the Territories of the Baja of Napal, which extend to the Frontiers of the Kindom of Bom an. This T^ is a Tributary to the great Mogul, and pays him every year an Elephant for his Homage. He refides in the City of Napal, from whence he derives his Title ; but there is little either Trade or Money in his Country, which is ail Woods and Forrefts. ; 1 r . The Caravan being arriv’d at the foot of thefe Mountains which are call’d st this day by the name of Naugrocot, abundance of people come from all parts of the Mountain, the greateft part whereof are women and maids, who a gree with the Merchants to carry them, their Goods and provifions crofs the Mountains, which is eight days journey more. The women carry upon each (houlder a woollen Roll, to which is faften’d a large Cufhion, that hangs down upon their backs, upon which the man fits, f here are three women to carry one man, relieving one another by turns. And Mr their luggage and provifions, they lade thein upon Goats, that will carry a hundred and fifty pound weight apiece. Thofe that will ride, are in many places forc’d to have their Horfes hoifted up with Cords, They never feed them but joi ning and evening mixing a pound of meal, half a pound of brown Sugar, nnd half a pound of Butter together, with water fufficient. In the evening they ^nft be contented only with a few flat Peafon, bruis’d, and flcep’d half an hour in water. The women that carry the men, get for their ten days travel two Koupies apiece, and as much for every, burthen which the Goats carry, and for ev ory Horfe which they lead. &gt;. AfterAfter you have pals d the Mountains, you may travel to Bomm Camels, Horfes, or Palleki’s, which you pleafe. The Country is mrS n , 0xen &gt; ing in Rice, Corn, Pulfe, and ftore of Wine. All the people both men f? nd ' men are clad m the Summer with a large piece of Fuftian, or Hemnen ri in the Winter with a thick Cloath,almoft like Felt, Both men and ; upon their heads a kmde of Bonnet, much like our drinking Cans whM?u ar adorn with Boars teeth, and with round and fquare pieces of ToVm &lt;L if y The richer fort intermix Coral and Amber Beads, of which their women „ r them Neck-Laces. 1 he men as well as the woman wear Bracelets ?i, ■ left hands only, from the wrill to the elbow. The woman wear them n ■ the men lofe. About their necks they wear a filken twill, at the end , of hangs a Bead of yellow Amber or Coral, or a Boars Tooth which af?' upon their Breafts. On their left fides, their Girdles are button’d with Be^ of the fame. Though they be Idolaters, yet they feed upon all fort of Za except the flelh of Cows, which they adore as the common Nurfes of all m ’ they are befides great lovers of ftrong water. They obferve alfo fome fW 5 monies of the Chtnefes, burning Amber at the end of their Feails, thouah tU do not worlhip fire like the Chmefes.

InPawa andD^there are above two thoufand perfons that thus employ themfelves,furnifhing the King, doms of Bontan, Afem, Siam, and other Northern and Eaflern parts of the Mo- guts Dominions. ^ As for Wormfeed, the Herb grows in the Fields,and mull dye before the Seed can be gather d_; but the mifehief is, that before the Seed is ripe, the wind feat, ters the greateft part which makes it fo feearce. When they gather the Seed, they take two little Hampers, and as they go along the Fields, they move their Hampers from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, as if they were mowing the Herb, bowing it at the top, and fo all the Seed falls into the Hampers. Rhubarb is a Root which they cut in pieces,and ilringing them by ten or twelve together, hang them up a drying.

Some of them carry ” aXeS j a ^^ uc ^ ers ‘ /^isalong time ago lince they had the firltufeof Muskets and Cannons: their Gun-Powder being long ,but y of an extraordinary xorce. I hey aliur d me that fome of their Cannons had Letters and Figures up on t em, that were above five hunder’d years old. They dare not ftir out ofthe Kingdom without the Governor’s particular leave; nor dare they carry a Musket a ong with them,unlefs their next Kindred will undertake for them that they ihall □ring it back. Otherwifel had brought one along with me; for by the cha- rateTravels in India, i Book HI* ratters upon the Barrel, it appear’d to have been made above i 8 q years. It was very thick, the mouth of the bore being like a Tulip, polifh’d within as’hright as aLooking-glafs. Two thirds ofthe Barrel were garnilh’d with embofs’d Wires with certain Flowers of Gold and Silver inlaid between ; and it earn’d a Bullet that weigh’d an ounce. But I could not prevail with the Merchant to fell it me nor to give me any of his powder. There are always fifty Elephants kept about the King’s Houfe,and twenty-five Camels, with each a Pice of Artillery mounted upon his back, that carries half a pound Ball. Behind the Gun fits a Cannoneer that manages and levels the Guns as he pleafes. There is no King in the World more fear’d and more refpefted by his Subjetts then the King of Banian } being in a manner ador’d by them. When he fits to do ]uftice,or give Audience,all that appear in his prefence hold their hands clofe to gether above their forheads * and at a diflance from the Throne proflrate them- felves upon the ground,not daring to lift up their heads. In this humble pofture they make’ their Petitions to the King j and when they retire, they go backwards till they are quite out ofhis fight. OfiT thingthey toldme for truth, that when the King has done the deeds of nature, they dilligently preferve the ordure,dry it and powder it, like fneezing-powder: and then putting it into Bqxes,they go every Market-day, and prefeilt it to the chief Merchants, and rich Farmers,who recompence them for their kindnefs .* that thofe people alfo carry it home^ as a great rarity, and when they feaft their Friends, ftrew it upon their meat. Two Bman Merchants Ihew’d me their Boxes , and the Powder that was in them. The Natives of Boutanttz ftrong and well proportion’d} but their nofes and faces are fomewhat flat. Their women are faid to be bigger and more vigo rous than the men j but that they are much more troubled with fwellings in the throat then the men, few efcaping that difeafe. They know not what war is, having iio enemy to fear but the Mogul, But from him they are fenc’d with high, fteep, craggy,and fnowey Mountains. Northward there are nothing but vaft Forrefts and Snow. Eaft and Weft nothing but bitter water. And as for the Raja's near them,they are Princes of little forcev There is certainly fome Silver Mine in the Kingdom of Boman, for the King coins much Silver, in pieces that are of the value of a Roupy. The pieces are alredy deferib’d. However the Bontan Merchants could not tell me where the Mine lay. And as for their Gold, that little they have is brought them from the Eaft, by the Merchants of thofe Countries. In the year 1^59, the Duke of Embafladours pafs’d through this Country to the King ©f China. They were three of the greateft Noblemen in 'Mnfcovy^ and were at firft very well receiv’d ; but when they were brought to kifs the Kings hands, the cuftom being to proftrate themfelves three times to the ground, they refus’d to do it, faying that they would complement the King after their manner,and as they approach’d their own Emperor, who was as great and as potent as the Emperor of China, Thereupon, and for that they con tinu’d in their refolution, they were difmifs’d with their prefents, not being ad mitted to fee the King. But had thofe Ambafladors conform’d to the cuftom of without doubt we might have had a beaten rode through Mnfcovy and the North part of Great Tanary^ and much more Commerce and knowledge of the Country than now we have^ This mentioning the Mufcovites, puts me in miad of a ftory that feveral Mufcovy Merchants averr’d to be true, upon the rode between Tauris and If- yahan, where I overtook them, of a woman of four fcore and two years of age, who at thofe years was brought to bed in one of the Cities of Mufcovy °f a Male Child, which was carry’d to the Duke, and by him brought up at the Court.Travelf in India. Part IL I CHAP. chap. XVI. Of the Kingdom of Tipra . M Oft people have been of opinion till now, that the Kingdom of Prjx, ii es upon the Frontiers of China ; and I thought fo my felf,till the Merchants of TVpr* undeceiv’d me. I met with three, one at i&gt;^, and two others at Tatna. They were men of very few words; whether it were their own particular difpolition, or the General habit of the Country. They cait rip their accounts with fmall Stones likes Agats, as big as a mans nail, upon every one of which was a Cypher. They had every one their weights, like a Stelleer ; though the Beam were not of Iron, but of a certain Wood as hard as Brazile; nor was the Ring that holds the weight, and is put thorough the Beam to mark the weight, of Iron, but a ftrong Silk Rope. And thus they weigh’d from a Dram to ten of our Pounds. If all the Natives of the King dom of Tip™, were like the two Merchants which I met at Patm, I dare af firm them to be notable topers; for they never refus’d whatever ftrong Li- quor I gave them, and never left till all was out ; and when I told them by my Interpreter that all my V^ine was gone, they clapt their hands upon their ftomachs and figh’d. Thefe Merchants travell’d all three through the King dom oiArakgn, which lies to the South and Weft: of Tipra, having fome part of Pmt upon the Winter weft. They told me alfo, that it was about fifteen days journey to crofs through their Country; from whence there is no cer tain conje&amp;ure of the extent to be made, by reafon of the inequality of the ftages. They ride upon Oxen and Horfes, which are low, but very hardy. As for the King and the Nobility, they ride in their Pallekies, or upon their Ele phants of War. They are no lefs fubjeft to Wens under their throats, than thofe of Bout an ; infomuch that the women have thofe Wens hanging down to their Nipples; which proceeds from the badnefs of the waters. There is nothing in Tipra which is fit for ftrangers. There is a Mine of Gold, but the Gold is very courfe. And there is a fort of very courfe Silk, which is all the Revenue the King has. He exacts no Subfidies from his Subjefts; but only that they, who are not of the prime Nobility, Ihonld work fix days in a year in his Mine, or in his Silk-works. He fends his Gold and his Silk into China, for which they bring him back Silver, which he coins into pieces to the value of ten Sous. He alfo makes thin pieces of Gold, like to the Jfpers ofTurky ; of which he has two forts, four ofthe onefort making a Crown, and twelve of the other.Book III. Travels in I n d i a. 'I chap. xvir.

I T was never known what the Kingdom of u 4 /enz was, till MrrimoU had fetPd Mreng-z,eb in the Empire. For he confidering that he Ihould be no longer valu’d at Court,after the War was at an end, being then General of Au- r^-^’s Array and powerful in the Kingdom where he had great Hereof Creatures, to preferve the Authority he had, refolv’d to undertake the Con- queft of the Kingdom of j 4 fem ^ where he knew he fhould find little or nd-re- fiftance, that Kingdom having been at peace above 500 years before. ’Tis thought thefe were the people that formerly invented Guns and Powder -/ which fpread it felf from u 4 fem to P^,and from Pegu to China from whence the inventi on has been attributed to the Chinefes. However certain it is, that Mirgimola brought from thence feveral pieces of Canon, which were all Iron Guns, and Hore of excellent Powder, both made in that Country. The Powder is round and filial], like ours, and very ftrong.* Mirgimola embark’d his Army in one of the mouths of Ganges, and failing Up one of the Rivers that comes from the Lake Chunsay, to the twenty-ninth or thirtieth Degree, he landed his Army, and came into a Country abounding in all humane necedaries, Hill finding the lefs refinance becaufe the people were fiirp-iizU Being a Mahametan, he fparM not the very Pagods, but burn’d and Pack’d all where-ever he came to the thirty-fifth Degree. There he under- ftood that the King of Afem was in the field with a more powerful! Army than he expeded^and that he had feveral pieces of Canon, and great ftore of fire-works withall. Thereupon APirgimola xhoxaghx. it not convenient to march any farther; tqough the chief reafon of his return was the drawing on of Winter} which the Indians are fo fenfible of, that it is impoflible to make them ftir beyond the thirti’th or thirty-fifth Degree, efpecially to hazard their lives. Mirgimola therefore turns to the South-well, and befieges a City call’d Axoo, which he took in a fmall time,and found good plunder therein. In this City of wfcoo, are the Tombs of the Kings oi Afem, and of all the Royal Family. For though they are Idolaters, they never burn their dead bodies, but bury them. They believe that the dead go into another world, where they that have liv’d well in this, have plenty of all things j but that they who have been ill livers, fuffer the want of all things, being in a more elpecial manner afflided with hunger and drowth ^ and that therefore it is good,to bury fomething with them to ferve them in their neceflides. This was the reafon that Mirgimola found fo much wealth in the City of Az.00. For many ages, together, feveral King had built them Chappels in the great Pagod to be buried in,and in their life times had fiord up in the Vaults of their particular Chappels, great Turns of Gold and Silver, and other moveables of value. Belides, that when they bury the deceas’d King, they bury with him likewife whatever he efteem’d mofi precious in his life-time, whether it were an Idol of Gold or Silver, or what ever dfe, that being needful in this, might be necefiary for him in the w r orld to come. But that which favours moft of Barbarifin is, that when he dies, all his belt beloved Wives,and the principal Officers of his Houfe poyfon them^ felves, to be bun d with him, and to wait upon him in the other world. Be- fides this, they bury one Elephant, twelve Camels, fix Horfes, and a good num ber of Hounds, believing that all thofe Creatures rife again to ferve their King. ^ , v \ The Kingdom of Afem is one of the belt Countries of all Afia, for it pro duces all things necefiary for humane fubfiftence, without any need of foreign JW- There are in it Mines of Gold, Silver, Steel, Lead, Iron, and great ifore of Silk, but coarfe. There is a fort of Silk that is found under the Irees, which is fpun by a Creature like to our Silk-worms, but rounder* * B b 2 andi88 Travels in India* Part 11, and which lives all the year long under the trees. The Silks which are made of this Silk glift’n very much, but they fret prefently. The Country produces alfo great ftore of Gum-Lake * of which there is two forts, one grows under the trees of a red colour, wherewith they paint their Linnen,and Stuffs • and when they have drawn out the red juice, the remaining fubltance ferves to’var nifh Cabinets, and to make Wax * being the bell Lake in for thofe ulh As lor their Gold they never fuffer it to be tranfported out of the Kingdom* nor do they make any Money of it *, but they preferve it all in Ingots which pafs in trade among the Inhabitants; but as for the Silver, the King coins it into Money, as is already defcrib’d. Though the Country be very plentiful of all things, yet there is no fleih which they elteem fo much as Dogs fleih y which is the greateft delicacy at allFealh • and is fold every month in every City of the Kingdom upon their Market-days! There are alfo great ftore of Vines } and very good Grapes, but they never make any Wine} only they dry the Grapes to make u 4 qua yit*. As for fait they have none but what is artificial, which they make two wayes. Firft they raife great heaps of that green Stuff that Swims at the tops of llanding waters, which the Ducks and Frogs eat, This they dry and burn ; and the allies thereof being boiPd in a Cloth in water, become very good Salt. The other way moft in ufe is to take the leaves of Adams Fig-tree, which they dry and burn } the allies whereof make a Salt fo tart, that it is impolfible to eat until the tartnefs be tak’n away ; which they do by putting the alhes in water, where they ftir them ten or twelve hours together } then they ftrain the fubftance through a Linnen Cloth and boil it; as the water boils away, the bottom thick’ns j and when the water is all boil’d away they find at the bottom very good and white Salt. Of the Alhes of thefe Fig-leaves they make a Lye,wherewith they walh their Silk, which makes it as white as Snow * but they have not enough to whiten half the Silk that grows in the Country. Kenner oof is the name of the City, where the King of Afem keeps his Court-, twenty-five or thirty days journey from that which was formerly the Capital City, and bore the fame name. The King requires no Subfidies of his pe&amp; pie} but all the Mines in his Kingdom are his own •, where for the cafe of his Subjects, he has none but Haves that work ; fo that all the Natives of Jfm Uve at their eafe, and every one has his houfe by himfelf, and in the middle of his ground a fountain encompafs’d with trees and molt commonly everyone an Elephant to carry their Wives y for they have four Wives, and when they marry, they fay to one, I take the to ferve me in fuch a thing} to the other, I appoint the to do fuch bufinefs *, fo that every one of the wives knows what Ihe has to do in the Houfe.

In die Southern parts the people go Hark naked, only covering their private parts, with a Bonnet like a blew Cap upon their heads, hung about with Swines teeth. They pierce holes in their ears,that you may thruft yourThumb in where they hang pieces of Gold and Silver.' Bracelets alfo of Tortoife-lhells, and Sea-lhells as long as an egg, which they faw into Circles, are in great efteem among the meaner fort ^ as Bracelets of Coral and yellow Amber among thofe that are rich.

H E greatefl: part of the Kingdoip of Siam lies between the Golf of Siant f * and the Golf of Bengal* *, bordering upon Vegu toward the North, and the Beninfda of Malacca toward the South. The (horteft and neareft way for the Euroyaam to go to this Kingdom, is to go to Jfpahan y from Ifpahan, to Ormas from Ornws to Surat, from Surat to G ole on da from Golconda to Majlipatan, there to embark for Denonferh, which is one of the Ports belonging to the’King- dom of Siam. From Denonferin to the Capital City, which is alfo call’d Siam 9 is thirty-five days journey, part by Water, part by Land, by Waggon, or upon Elephants. The way, whether by Land or Water, is very troublefome * for by Land you muft be always upon your guard for fear of Tigers and Lions : by Water, by reafon of the many falls of the River, they are forc’d to hoife up their Boats with Engines. 1 All the Country of Siam, is very plentiful in Rice and Fruits y the chiefeil whereof cite Mangos, Darions, and ManguSlans. The Forefls are full of Harts Elephants,Tigers,Rhinocero’s,and Apes where there grow alfo large Bambou’s in great abundance. Under the knots of thefe Bambou’s are Emets nefts as big as a mans head, where every Emet has his apartment by himfelf; but there is but one hole to enter into the nell. They make their nefts in thefe Canes to preferve themfelyes from the rains which continue four or five months together. In the night time the Serpents are very bufie. There are fdme two foot long, with two heads; but one of them has no motion. There is alfo another creature in Siam, like our Salamander, with a forked tail, and very venomous. The Rivers in this Kingdom are very large j and that which runs by Siamh equally as large as the reft. The water is very wholefome; but it is very full of Crocodiles of a monftrous bignefs, that devour men if they be not very care ful of them felves. Thefe Rivers overflow their banks while the Sun is in the Southern Tropick; which makes the fields to be very fertil as far as they flow 5 and it is obferv’d, that the Rice grows higher or lower, as the floods do more or lefs increafe. the Capital City of the Kingdom, where the King keeps his Court, is wall d about, being about three ©f our Leagues in circuit ; it is fituated in an luand, the River running quite round it, and might be eafily brought into eve ry flreet in the Town, if the King would but lay out as much Money upno that defign, as he fpends in Temples and Idols. The SUmers have thirty-three Letters in their Alphabet. But they write from the left to the right, as we do, contrary to the cuftom of Japon, China, Cochinchina, and Tunquin, who write from the right to the left. All the Natives of this Kingdom are flaves, either to the King or the great Lords. The women as well as the men cut their hair j neither are they very nai in their habits. Among their Complements, the chiefeft is, never to go betorea perfon that they refpeft, unlefs they firft ask leave, which they do by noidmg up both their hands. Thofe that are rich have feveral Wives. y he Money of the Country is already defcribM. one of the richeft Monarchs in the Eaft, and ftiles him- p r ^ H eavei i an d Earth though he be Tributary to the King of China. jekldoni firews himfelf to his Subjects; and never gives Audience, but to t ^ Principal Favourites of his Court. He trufts to his Minifters of State, 01 the mandgemeflt of his affairs, who fometimes make very bad ufe of their authority. He never (hews himfelf in publick above twice a year*, but then 1 d s with an extraordinary magnificence. The firft is r when he goes to a cer- am P^god within the City, which isguilded round both within and without. 1 si e are three Idols between fix and feven foot high, which are all of maflie. Gold jTravels in India. Part II, Gold ; which he believes he renders propitious to him, by the great ftore of /Ims that he diftributes among the poor, and the prefents which he makes to thePriefts. Then he goes attended by all his Court, and puts to open vje w the richefl: Ornaments he has. One part of his magnificence confilb in his train of two hundred Elephants among which there is one that is white which the King fo highly efteems, that he ftiles himfelf King of the Wi m ] Elephant, . . . The fecond time the King appears in publick, is when he goes to another Pagod five or fix Leagues above the Town, up the River. _ But no perfon mull: enter into this Pagod, unlefs it be the King and his Pn efts. As for the people, fo foon as they fee the Door op’n, they mull: prefently fall upon their Faces to the Earth. Then thfe King appears upon the River with two hundred Gallies of a prodigious length y four hundred Rowers belonging to every one of fhe Gallies ; molt of them being guilded and carv’d very richly. Now in regard this fecond appearance of the King is in the month of Av 'vemher 1 when the waters begin to abate, thePriefts make the people believe that none but the King can flop the courfe of the waters, by his Prayers and by his Offerings to this Pagod. and they are fo vain as to think that the King cuts the waters with his Sabra, or Skain ; thereby commanding it to retire back into the Sea. * , , The King alfo goes, but incognito, to a Pagod in an Wand where the Hoi- Unders have a Fa&amp;ory. There is at the entry thereof an Idol fitting crofs- feg’d with one hand upon his knee, and the other arm akimbo. It is above fixty foot highand round about this Idol are about three hundred others, of feveral forts and lives. All thefe Idols are guilt. And indeed there are a prodigiptis number of Pagods in this Country i for every rich Siomer caufes one to be built in memory of himfelf. Thofe Pagods have Steeples and Bells, and the Walls within are painted and guilded ; but the Windows are fo nar row that they give but a very dim light. The two Pagods to which the King goes publickly, are adorn’d with feveral tall Pyramids, well guilded. And to that in the Hollanders. Ifland there belongs a Cloyfter, which is a very neat Structure. In the middle of the Pagod is a fair Chappel, all guid ed within fide ; where they find a Latt^J, and thtee Wax Candles continually burning before the Altar, which is all over cover’d with Idols, fome of Maffie Gold, others of Copper guilt. In the Pagod in the midft of the Town, and in one of thofe tx&gt; which the King goes once a year, there are above four thoufand Idols ; and for that which is fix Leagues from Siam, it is furround- ded with Pyramids, whofe beauty makes the induftry of that Nation to be aurmr u-. f „ When the King appears, all the Doors and Windows of the Houfesmiiit be tat •, and all the people proftrate themfelves upon the ground, not da- ring to lift up their eyes. And becaufe no perfon is to be in a higher place than the King, they that are within doors, are bound to keep their loweit Rooms. When he cuts his hair, one of his Wives performs that office, tot he will not fuffer a Berber to come near him. This Prince has a Paflionate kindnefs for his Elephants ^ which he looKs upon as his, Favourites, and the Ornaments of his Kingdom. If there be any o them that fall fick, the Lords of the Court are mighty careful to pleate their Soveraign } and if they happen to dye, they are buried with the fame lunerai Pomp as the Nobles of the Kingdom j which are thus perform’d .* They let up a kind of Maufoleum, or Tomb of Reeds, cover’d with Paper j m the mioi whereof they lay as much fweet wood as: the body weighs, and after the Prie s have mumbl’d certain Orfons, theyfetit a-fire, and burn it to aihes, vv i the rich preferve in Gold or Silver Urnsy but the poor fcatter in the v\in for offenders, they never burn, but bury them. .' •/t ’Tis thought that in this Kingdom there are above two hundrea which they call which are highly reverenc’d as well at Court as a the people. The King himfelf has fuch a value for fome of them, as to ble himfelf before them. This extraordinary refpedf makes them ° P ’ that fome of them have afpir’d to the Throne. But when the King 1Book III* Travelf in India. any fuch defign, he puts them to death. And one of them had his head latelv (truck off for his Ambition. Thefe Bonz.es wear yellow, with a little red Cloth about their Wafts; like a Girdle. Outwardly they are very modeft,and are never feen to be angry About four in the morning, upon the tolling of their Bells, they rife to their prayers, which they repeat again toward evening. There are fome days in the year when they retire from all converfe, with men. Some of them live by Alms * others have Houfes with good Revenues. While they wear the Ha bit of they muft not marry ^ for if they do, they muft lay their Ha bit afide. They are generally very ignorant, not knowing what they believe. Yet they hold the tranfmigration of Souls into feveral Bodies. They are for bid to kill any Creature ^ yet they will make no fcruple to eat what others kill, or that which dies of it felf. They fay that the God of the Chriftians and theirs were Brothers; but that theirs was the eldeft. If you ask them where their God is, they fay, he vanifh’d away, and they know not where he is. The chief ftrength of the Kingdom is their Infantry,which is indifferent good * the Soldiers are us’d to hardfhip, going all quite naked, except their private parts; all the reft of their body, looking as if it had been cupt, is carv’d into feveral lhapes of beaftsand flowers. When they have cut their skins, and ftanch’d the blood, they rub the cut-work with fuch colours as they think molt proper. So that afar off you would think they were clad in fome kind of flower’d Satin or other; for the colours never rub out. Their Weapons are Bows and Arrows, Pike and Musket, and an AzjigAy&lt;t y or Staff between five and fix foot long, with a long Iron Spike at the end, which they very dextroufly dart at the Enemy. ' In the year 1665, there was at SUmz Neapolitan Jefrnte who was call’d Father Thomas ; he caus’d the Town and the Kings Palace to be fortifi’d with very good Bulwarks, according to Art; fpr which reafon the King gave him leave to live in the City, where he has a Houfe and a little Church.

JT H E Kingdom of Macajfar, otherwife call’d the JJle of Celebes, begins at the fifteenth Degree of Southern Latitude. The heats are exceflive all the day ; but the nights are temperate enough. And for the Soil, it is very fertile; but the people have not the art of building. The Capital City bears the name of the Kingdom, and is fituated upon the Sea. The Port is f ree 5 for the Veflels that bring great quantities of goods from the Adjacent I Hands, pay no Cuftoms. The Illanders have a cuftom to poyfon their Arrows; and the molt dangerous poyfon which they ufe, is the juice of certain Trees in the hiand of Borneo ; which they will temper fo as to work fwift or flow, as they pieafe. They hold that the King has only the fecret Receit to take away the force of it; who boafts that he has the molt effectual poyfon in the world, which there is no remedy can prevent. One day an Englijh man in heat of blood had kill’d one of the Kings of Mtcajfars Subjects; and though the King had pardon’d him, yet both Englijh 7 olUnders, and Fortugals fearing if the Englijh man fhould go unpunifh’d, left -^ an ders (hould revenge themfelves upon fome of them, befought the King put him to death ; which with much ado being confented to, the King un- wiiling t° put Him to a lingring death,and defirous to (hew the effect of his poyfon, j^olv a to fhoot the Criminal himfelf; whereupon he took a long Trunk, and ol him exactly into the great Toe of the right foot, the place particularly imeiat.

Yet in the year 1656, the Ghriftians found a way to get leave to build a fair Church in Macajfar. But the next year the King caus’d it to be pull'd down, as alfo that of the Dominican Friars, which the lartagals ma( j e life of. The Parifti Church, which was under the Government of the fecular Priefts, flood Hill, till the Hollanders attack’d Macaffar, and compelPd him to turn all the Torttigah oxxt of his Dominions. The ill condud of that Prince was in part the occafion of that war.* to which the Hollanders were mov’d to revenge themfelves upon the Portugal Jefaits, who had crofs’d their Em- bafly to China. Eefides, that they offer’d great affronts to the Hollanders at MacaJJar, efpecially when they trod under foot the Hat of one of the Dutch Envoys, who was fent to treat with the King in behalf of the Company . There- upon the Hollanders refolv’d to unite their forces with the Bou^mfes, that were in rebellion againft their Soveraign, and to revenge themfelves at any rate. Now as to the bufmefs of China, it happen’d thus: Toward the end of the year 1558, the General of Batavia, and his Council, fent one of the thief of the Holland Company, with Prefents to the King of Cfc* who arriving at Court, labour’d to gain the friendfhip of the Mandarins, who are the Nobility of the Kingdom. But the Jefmts, who byreafon of their long abode in the Country, underflood the language, and were acquainted f with the Lords of the Court, left the Holland Company fhould get footing to the prejudice of the Tortugals, represented feveral things to the Kings Council to the prejudice of the Hollanders ; mofe efpecmlly changing them with breach of Faith in all the places where they came. Upon this the Holland Agent was difmifs’d, and departed out of Cfe, without doing any feats. Afterwards coming to under* Hand what a trick the Portugal Jefuits had put upon him, he made report thereof to the General and his Council at Batavia *, which fo incens’d them, that they refolv’d to be reveng’d. For by the Deputies accounts, the Em* baffy had coft them above fifty thousand Crowns * for which they confulted how to make the Portugals pay double. Underflanding therefore the trade which the drove in the Ifland of Macao, and to the Kingdom of J/*- whither upon their own account they fent feven Yellels,laden with all forts of Commodities, as well of India as China-, they took their opportunity, and the feventhof June 1660, appear’d with a Fleet of thirty Sail before the Port of Macajfar. The King thinking hirnfelf oblig’d to make defence agaM fo Potent an Enemy, endeavour’d to fu(lain the brunt of the Hollander with the Portugal Ships in the Road ; but the Hollander dividing their Fleet, part of them fought the Portugal, the other half batter’d the Royal FortrelS iO furioufly, that they carry’d it in a (hort time. Which fo terrifi’d the King that he commanded the Portugal not to fire any more for fear of farther pro voking his Enemies* The Prince Patinfaloa, was flain in the fight, Which was a great lofs to the King of Macaffar, who was become formidable to his neigh bours by the good Conduct of that Miniffer. As for the Hollanders, they took, burnt, and funk all the Portugal Veflels, and fufKciently reimburs’d themfelves for their China Expences. , The thirteenth of Jta the King of Maeajfar, whofe name was Siinmo, hung out a white Flag from another Tower, whence he beheld the fight en viron’d by his Wives. During the truce, he fent one of the Grandees oi ms Court to the Dutch Admiral, to defire peace, which was granted, upon con dition he fhould fend an Embaffador to Batavia, expel the Portugal onto Ifland, and not permit his Subjects to have any more to do with them. ^ Thereupon the King of Macaffar, fent eleven ofthe greateft L01 asm Court, with a train of feven hundred men 5 the Chief of the Etnbai) &amp;~«*^iigyy M&gt;l Book IIL Travels in I n d r a. 193 the Prince of Patinfaloa. i he firft thing they did,was to pay two hundred Loaves of Gold to redeem the Royal Fortrefs again; and then fubmitting to the Coni ditions which the Dutch Admiral had propos’d, the General of Batavia liga’d the Articles, which are punctually obferv’d. For the Portugals had in all quitted the Country, fome departing for Siam and Camboya, others for Macon and Goa. Macoa) formerly one of the molt famous and richeft Cities of the Orient, was the principal motive that endin’d the: Hollanders to fend an Em- balladour into China ^ for being the belt ftation which the Portugals had in all thofe parts, the Dutch had a defign to win it wholly. Now, this City, lying in twenty-two Degrees of Northern Latitude, in a fmall Ifland next to the Province of Kanton^ which is a part of China, has very much loll its former lulter. But this was not all which the Jefttits and the Portugal Merchants fuffer’d. The Chief of the Dutch FaCtory at Mingrela, which is but eight Leagues from this City, underftanding the bad fuccefs of the Dutch in China, had a contri vance by himfelf to be reveng’d. He knew that the Jefuites of Goa and other places, drove a great trade in rough Diamonds, which they fent into Europe i or elfe carry’d along with them when they return’d ; and that for the more private carrying on of their trade, they were wont to fend one or two of their Order, that knew the language, in the habit of a Faquir, which conlllts of a Tygers Skin to cover their back-parts, and a Goats Skin to cover the breaft, reaching down to the knees. Thereupon the Chief of the FaClory of Mingrela taking his opportunity, and having notice that two of the fuppos’d Faquirs were gone to the Mines, to lay out 400000 Pardo’s in Diamonds, gave order to two men, which he had fee’d for the purpofe, that as foon as the Fathers had made their purchafe, he Ihould give notice to the Officer of the Guftom-Houfe at Bicholi* Bicholi is a great Town upon the Frontiers of thofe Lands that part the Kingdom offrom the Territories of the Portugals there being no other way to pafs the River, which encompafles the Ifland where the City of GW L built. The Fathers believing that the Cultomer knew nothing of their purchafe, went into the Boat to go over the River } but as foon as they were in, they were ftridtly fearch’d, and all their Diamonds cpnfifcated. To return to the King of Maca^ar j you mull know, that the Jefuits once endeavour'd to convert him -, and perhaps they might have brought it to pafs, had they not negleded one propolal which he made them. For at the fame time that the Jefuits labour’d to bring him to Chrifl:ianity,the Mahumetans us’d all their endeavours to oblige him to flick to their Law. The King willing to leave his Idolatry, yet not knowing which part to take, commanded the Mahumetans to fend for two or three of their moft able Moullas, or Docflors from Mecca and the ^efuits he order’d to fend him as many of the moll learn d among them, that he might be inltru&amp;ed in both Religions ; which they both promis’d to do. But the Mahometans were more diligent than the Chriltians, for in eight months they fetch’d from Mecca two learned Manilas \ whereupon the King feeing that the Jefuits fent no body to him, embrac’d the Mahumetan Law. True it is, that three years after there came two Portugal Jefuits y but then it was too late. The King of Macajfar being thus become a Mahumetan, the Prince his Bro ther was fo mad at it, that when the Mofquee, which the King had caus'd to be built, was finilh’d, he got into it one night, and caufmg the throats of two Figs to be cut, he all befmear’d the Walls of the new Mofquee, and the place which was appointed for the Moulla to perform Divine Service with the blood; s fo that the King was forc’d to pull down that, and build Another. After which the Prince with fome Idolatrous Lords Role out of the Ifland, and never fmee appear’d at Court. * Cc CHAP. iT ^1 T! iii 111 111' 1 lilli; , : 1 f-/ 1 .If 'r t n j/M ||f I I il II i : 1 iJM; 1 : 1 1rt ra j iim ip 111 'ly, ill 1 vp; &lt; iii |i I' ; I; !! f|ii' 4 p .

The Ship had orders to touch at Bokanonrfto take in Rice. Whereupon I went afhore with the Captain, to obtain leave of the King to buy Rice. We found him upon the fhore, where he had about a do zen Huts fet up, which were cover’d with Palm-leaves. In his own Hut there was a piece of Per fan Tapeftry fpread under him, and there we faw five or iix women, fbme fanning him with Peacocks Featheis,. others giving him Betle y &gt; others filling him his Pipe of Tobacco. The moft confiderable perfons of the Country were in the other Huts; and we counted about two hundred men that were upon the Guard, arm’d only with Bows and Arrows. They had alfb two Elephants among ’em. 5 Tis very probable, that his Palace was not far off and that he only came thither to take the frefh air.

If they have finifh’d the defign which they undertook, the place cannot but be very confiderable. The Hollanders , before they took all the places which the P or turns had in the Ifland of Ceylan, did believe that the trade of this Ifland would have brought them in vails fums, could they but be foie Mailers of it ; arid perhaps their Conjectures might have been true, had they not brbken their words wit the King of Candy , who is the King of the Country y but breaking faith witii him,they loft themfelves in all other places thereabouts.^ , .

V '~\ ' ® The King otAchen, with whom the Hollanders alfo broke their word had more opportunity to be reveng’d upon them then the King of Candy. For he deni’d them the tranfportation of Pepper out of his Country, without which their trade was worth little. His Pepper being that which is molt coveted by theEaft. So that they were forc’d to make a compofition with him. The King of Achem Embafladour coming to Batavia, was ftrangely furpriz’d to fee wo men iitting at the Table ; but much more, when after a health drank to the Queen of Achen, the General of Batavia commanded his Wife to go and kifs the Embafladour. Nor was the King behind hand with the Dutch Embalfadour another way; whom the King beholding in a languilhing diftemper, ask’d him whether he had never any familiarity with any of the Natives. Yes, replied the Embafladour; however I left her to marry in my own Country. Upon that the King commanded three of his Phylieians to cure him in fifteen days upon the forfeiture of their lives. Thereupon they gave him a certain potion every morning, and a little Pill at night j and at the end of nine days he took a great Vomit. Every body thought he would have dy’d with the working of it; but at length brought up a ftopple of courfe hair, as big as a nut; after which he prefently recover’d.

'• J The next day I fetit my Brother to the Palace, to know when it would be feafonable for me to come and kifs the King’s Hand. When the King faw him (for he was well known to him) he would not fuffer him to return, butfent others to fetch me, and to tell me withall, that if I had any rare Jewels,! ihoald do him a kindnefs to bring them along with me. When I faw my Brother return’d not with the perfons which the King fent, I was almoft in the mind not to have gone j remembring how the Ring of ;/- then had ferv’d the Sieur Renand. For the French having fet up an Eaft Mi Company,fent away four VefTels, three great ones, and one of eight Guns, for the fervice of the Country. Their Voyage was the Ihorteft that ever was heard of* arriving at Bantam ill lefs than four months. The King alfocour- teoufly receiv’d them, and let them have as much Pepper as they defir’d, and cheaper by twenty in the hundred then he fold it to the Hollanders. But the French not coming only for Pepper, fent away their fmall Ship with the greateft part of their Money to Mac afar ^ to try the Market for Cloves, Nut megs, and Mace. The French being fo foon difpatch’d at Bantam, had not patience to Hay till the return of the fmall Velfel which they had fent to Macaffar } but to pafs the time , mull needs run over to Batavia, being not above fourteen Leagues off 5 fo that you may be at Batavia from Bantam in a tide with a good wind. When they came to an Anchor, the General of the French Fleet fent to Complement the General of Batavia, who fail’d not to anfwer his ci vility, and invited the Admiral afhore. Moreover he fent to thofe that flay’d aboard, great flore of excellent cheat, and a good quantity of Spamjh and Rhenijh Wine, with particular order to them that carry’d it,to make tht French druns* His order was fo well follow’d, that ’twas eafie to fet the Ships on fire, according to the private inftru&amp;ions which they had. So foon as the fame was difcover’d from the Generals Window, which overlook’d all the Road, there was a wonderful pretended aftonifhment among the Dutch. But the French ki- miral too truly conjecturing the ground and Authors of the treachery, behold ing the company with an undaunted courage j Come, come, cry’d he, lets drink on; they that fet the Ships a-fire ftiall pay for’em. However the FreW? Ships were all burnt, though the men were alt fav’d in Boats which were forth with fent to their relief. After that, the General of Batavia made them great offers, which they refus’d, and return’d to Batavia, in expectation of their fmall Vehel. When it return’d, they could find out no better way then to fell Ship and goods, and all to the Englifi, and to Hare the Money among themfelves, every one according to their condition. T , But the trjck which they put upon the Englijh was far more bloody, Englijh were the firft that found out the danger of failing from Surat, fat an, or any other diftant parts , to Japon without touching by the way Whereupon they thought it convenient to build a Fort in the Ifland 01 ° mofa, which not only fav’d the lofsof feveral Vefiels, but alfo brought in great gain.

While the chief of them were at Dinner with the chief of the Englijh^ they all ply’d their Cups; and when the Dutch fan the Enghjh had drunk hard enough, taking their opportunity, they pickt a quar rel with the Commander of the Fort, and drawing their Swords, which they had hidden under their Coats for that purpofe, they eafily furpriz’d and cut all the throats of the Soldiers in the Garrifon j and being thus Matters of the Fort, they kept it from that time till they were routed out by the Chinefes. Now for the trick that the King of Men ferv’d the Sieur Renand he ha ving got a good Ettate by Jewels, arriv’d at length at Achen y and as it is the cuftom for the Merchants to Ihew the King what Jewels they have, the King had no fooner call his eye upon four Rings which the Sieur Renaud Ihew’d him, but he bid him fifteen thoufand Crowns for them ; but Renaud would not bate of eighteen thoufand. Now becaufe they could not agree, the Sieur Renaud carry’d them away with him, which very much difpleas’d the King; however he fent for him the next day. Whereupon returning to hirn^ the King paid him his eighteen thoufand Crowns; but he was never feen after that, and it is thought he was fecretly murther’d in the Palace. This ttory came to my remembrance, when I found my Brother did not come along with thofe that were fent to fetch me,. However I refblv’d to go, taking with me 12 or 13000 Roupies worth of Jewels; the greatett part be ing in Rofe Diamond Rings, fome confitting of feven, fome of nine, and fome of eleven Stones *, with fome fmall Bracelets of Diamonds and Rubies. I found the King with three of his Captains and my Brother fitting together, after the manner of the £att,with five great Plates of Rice before them of divers colours.For their drink they had Spanijh Wine,ftrong waters,and feveral forts of Sherbets. ter I had complemented the King, and prefented him with a Diamond Ring, a blew Saphir Ring, and a little Bracelet of Diamonds, Rubies,, and blew Sa- phirs, he commanded me to fit down, and order’d me a glafs of ftrong Wa ter to whet my appetite. The glafs held a quarter of a pint, and therefore I refus’d it, which the King very much wonder’d at; but being told by my Bro ther, that I never drank any ftrong Water, he order’d me prefently a glafs of Sack. After that he rofe up, and feated himfelf in a Chair, the Elbows whereof werp gilded. His feet and legs were bare, having a Perjian Carpet of Gold and Silk to tread upon. He was clad with a piece of Calicut, part whereof cover’d his body from his wafte to his knees, the reft being wound about his back and fhoulders like a Scarf. Inftead of Shoes he had a pair of Sandals, that flood by the Chair fide, the ftraps whereof was embroider’d with Gold and fmall Pearl. About his head he had a thing like a Handkerchief, with three Corners, bound about his head like a Fillet. His hair alfo, which was very long, was twitted and ty’d together over his head. Two perfons flood behind nun with great Fans of long Peacock Feathers , the handles whereof were *ve or fix foot in length. Upon his right hand flood an old black women,holding m her hand a little Mortar and Peftle of Gold, to beat his Betle^ in, where- with he mix’d the Kernel of the Nut of Araquefixul Seed Pearl diflblv’d. When tt was all beaten together, the old woman gave it the King over his Shoulders, *vho opening his mouth, the old woman fed him as our women feed their Chil- J; en * . F°r the King had chaw’d fo much Betti^ and taken fo much Tobacco, that his teeth were all falfn out of his head. , The King of Bantam’s Palace was never built by any curious Archited. It is ^ Iquare place, encompafs’d with a great many Pillars, varnifh’d over with fe- cral fort 8 of colours, againft which the King leans when he fits down.

The roof was cover’d &gt;with Coco-Branches. Not far off unff another Roof fupported with four great Pillars, he had fixteen Elephants the nobleft of all thofe that aredn the Kings fervice ; for he has a far greater num ber train’d up for war, that are not afraid of wild-hre. For his guard he might have about two thoufand men, that were drawn up in Companies under the ihade of the next Trees. They are good Soldiers as well by Sea as by Land • great Mahometans, and Hand not at all in fear of death. His Harm^ or the Womens Apartment, was certainly a very fmall Place. For when he had view’d what I brought him, he fent for two old women, to whom he gave fome of the Jewels, to go and Ihew them to his Wives The two women return’d back through a little pitiful door; the enclofure being nothing but a kind of Wall made up of Earth and Cow-dung mix’d together. Whatever he fent to the Women they never return’d any thing again. Which made me believe they would bears good price ^ and indeed whatever I fold to him, I fold to good profit, and had my .Money well paid me. After this we took our leaves \ but the King oblig’d us to come next day in the evening, becaufe he had a defire to fliew us a Tarky Dagger, the Haft whereof, being thin of Diamonds, he had a mind to enrich with more Stones. Coming to the English Houfe with our Money, they wonder’d that the King had laid out twenty thoufand Roupies, telling me, they believ’d it was the belt part of his treafure. The next day my brother and I went to wait upon him at the appointed hour, and we found him fitting in the fame place where he fate before. There was a Manila then read to him, who feem’d to interpret to him fomething of the Mcoran in the Language. The Le&amp;ure being ended, they both rofe and went to prayers *, which being concluded, the King fent for the Dag ger and the Haft which was of Gold. The top of the Handle was already let with Diamonds, and upon the upper part of the crofs Bar was cut in Fa cets, which could not be lefs worth than fifteeen or fixteen thoufand Crowns. The King told me, it was prefented to him by the Queen of Borneo, and that it was cut at Goa', but that he put a far higher value upon it than I efteem’d it to be worth. The Dagger, as well as the Sheath was full of Beazils, or Collets, in very good order j but the King had neither Diamond, Ruby, nor any other Stone to fet in the Collets; and therefore defir’d me to help him to fome that might come at an ealie rate. I told him it was impofiible to find Stones that would fit theBeazils} and therefore that it was better, when he had got Stones enough, to fix other Beazils according to the proportion of the Stones. To which purpofe he was firfl to range all his Stones in Wax; which I fhew’d him how to do at the fame time } but that was above his skiff And therefore do what I could to excufe my felf to the contrary, he would needs oblige me to carry the Dagger to Batavia', whereupon I took my leave of the King, and departed. y ; ; . r ; . / CHAP.CHAP.

Thither in lefs then a quarter of an hour, the King lent us fbme Pateches, or fweet Water- Melons, red within like Scarlet. We had alfo Mongo’s, and a certain large Fruit call’d Bomfone, red alfo within, the meat of it being foft and fpungy, but of an excellent tafle. Having flay’d our flomachs, we went to wait upon the King, whom we found in the fame place, with his old Mortar-bearer, who every foot fed him with Betle with her fingers.’ There were fitting about the Hall five or fix of his Captains, viewing a certain parcel of Fire-works, as Gra- nado’s, Rochets, and other divices to run upon the water, which the Chi- nefes had brought ^ who are the moft exquifite at thofe fports of any people in the world. When the King was at leafure, I return’d him his Dagger, tel ling him, that Batavia was no place to meet with ftones} and that fuch as were to be found, were valu’d at double the price they were worth \ and that tnere was no place where he could fit himftlf, but at Golconda, Goa, or the Diamond Mines. Thereupon the old woman took the Dagger,and carry’d it in to his Haram ; nor did the King fpeak one word more about. it.

The day before I departed, I went to take my leave of one of the kdian Counsellors,and telling him that I was going to wait upon the King of Jaj&gt;ar,k Hood amas’d, in regard the King and the Hollanders were mortal Enemies; of which he gave me this account .* The deceas’d King, Father to the King that now reigns, fince the Hollanders built their Fort of Batavia would never have any peace with them. And though that during the war the Hollanders took ten of his Subjects, for one of theirs, and offer’d ten for one in exchange, yet he would never exchange one upon any condition whatfoever, and charg’d,his Son upon his death'bed never to releafe one. This obitinacy very much trou bl’d the Dntch General, and all the reft in Batavia, and oblig’d them to con- fult upon ways how to right themfelves. Now it is the cuftom when a Ma hometan King dyes, that his fuccefibr fends certain greaf Lords of his Court with Prefents, as well to engage them to pray for the Soul of the deceas’d y as alfo to give thanks to God and Mahpwet for the coming of a new King to the Throne without any Impediment y and to pray for the bleffing of Victory over all his Enemies. But the new King and his Council were at a lofs how to accomplilh this Voyage ; for firlt the King had none but .little Veffels, that were w r 6nt only to fail along by the fhore, by reafon of the in experience of his Seamen; apd in the fecond place the Dutch were always ply ing to and fro about the mouths of his Havens, to furprize his Subjects if they Hirr’d forth. For the fafety therefore of his Pilgrims, the King at lafl: Con cludes upon making an agreement with the Engtijh. For v/hich reafon he dif- patches away an Envoy promis’d to lend him l pany had m xhz Indies. for ever, for all Comm 'Treaty being fatifi d, my aum**** 1 *1^1*1, » and Gunn’d beyond an ordinary rate. Thereupon nine of the principal Kurds of the Court, and molt pf the Blood Royal, with a Train of a hundred perfons, embark’d themfelves in the great Veflel. But all thefe preparations could not be earn’d fo privately, but that the Dutch had intelligence of it by their Spies. Thereupoh the General df the Dutch makes ready three Ships, and lying jult in the ftreight of mouthy fo foon as the En^ffh oame up, (for they had no other way ) let fly at them fo roundly, that the Englifh fearing left their Veflels would be funk, ftruck Sail; which the Java Lords feeing, call’d the lijh Traytors, and drawing their poyfon’d Daggers, cry’d a Mocca upon the £^ BJh, killing a great number of them before they had time to put themfelyes into a pofture of defence. And perhaps there would not one of them have efcap d? had not the Hollanders come aboard as they did-Some ©f the^^Lords.and abou . ; , twentyBook III. Travels in I n d l a. twenty of their Attendants, would take no quarter; fo that the Hollanders were forc'd to fight for’t, and at laft they got the better, with the lofs Of feveil or eight men. The Englifc VefTel being earn’d into Batavia-, the General very ci Tilly fent both the Pnfoners and the Veflel home again; withall giving notice to the King, that he was ready to make an exchange of Prifoners with him But the King would not fo much as hearken to any fuch propofition; returning for anfwer, that though the Hollanders had three times as many of his Sub jeftshe would not releafe fo much as one Hollander. So that the poor Dutch were kept flaves in Java, and the Javamers dy’d miferable in Batavia As for tbtjavanners, they are good Sonldiers. And it is reported, that While Batavia was befieg’d by the King of Bantam in the year iff 59, a Dutch Soul-, diet lying in Ambufcade in a Marih,a Javanner, little dreaming, that an v bodv had been there, came to the fame place to difeover the Enemy, and was bv the Dutch man thruft with his Pike Into his Body. Upon which the Javanner find ing hitnfelf wounded, did not ftrive to pull the Pike out of the body but thruft himfelf farther upon it, to the end he might come at his Enemy,’ whom he ftab’d to the heart, as loon as he got within his reach.

T H E next day I went aboard the Vice admiral, and the third day after we fet fail, and as foon as we were out of the Streight, we difeover’d the Illands of the Prince. From thence being in the Altitude of the Coco lilands, we beat about two days to difeover them *, but all to no purpofe,thereupon we made diredtly for the Cafe of good Hofc. The forty-fifth day after our departure from Batavia, our Vice-Admiral negle&amp;ed to put out his Lights; believing all the Fleet had been before at the Cafe fo that it happen’d that one of the Fleet being behind, and not carry ing any Lights out neither, it being a dark night, fell foul upon us, which put every man to his prayers, all people believing the Veflel had been loft \ and indeed had fhe not been a found itanch Ship (for the Provinces were fo ac counted) ftie fhould never have endur’d fo terrible a fhock. At length we clear’d our felves, by cutting of the Yards of the Maeftrkht, that hung in our Cor- •dage. . - — M ' * ' The fifty-fifth we came within view of the Cafe of good Hofe', but were forc’d to keep the Sea, becaufe the waves roll’d fb that we were not able to come toan Anchor j not that the Wind was extream high, but becaufe the South- wind had blown fo long that it had forc’d the Water to that part. When the Sea grew calm, we came to an Anchor. But of all the people that ever I faw in all my travels I never faw any fo hideous nor fo bruitfh as the Comonkcj^ of which Iliad fpoken in my Per fan Travels v and thofe of the Cafe of good Hofe, whom they call Cafes, ot Ho- femotes. When they fpeak, they make anoife with their tongues, like the breaking of wind backward; and though they hardly fpeak articulately, yet they eafily.underflandone another. They cover themfelves with the Skins of wild Bealls, .which they kill in the Woods; in Winter wearing the hairy part inner- moll, and in Summer outermoll. But there are none but the heft fort among them who are thus clad, the reft wear nothing but a nafty rag about their privy parts. The men and the women are lean and Ihort} and when they bring forth a Male-child, the Mothers cut out his right Stone; and prefently give nun Water to drink,and Tobacco to eat. They cut out the right Tefticle, became, fay they, it makes them fwifter to run. There are foroe of them that will catch a Roe-Buck runnig. They neither know what belongs to Gold nor Silver; an for Religion, they have none among them. f So foon as we call Anchor, four women came aboard us, and brought us 0 young Qftriches} which were boil’d for fame lick people that we hau -Book III* Travels in I n d i Ai board. After that they brought great ftore of Tortoife-Shells, and OH richer Eggs, and other Eggs as big as Goofe Eggs; which though they had no Yolk, tilted wery well. The Birds that lay thefe Eggs are a fort of Geefe,and fo fat that they are hardly to be eaten, tailing rather like Fifli than Fielh. The wo men feeing our Cook throw away the Guts of two or three Fowl which he was dreffing, took them up, and fqueezing out the Ordure, eat them as they were * being hugely pleas’d with the u 4 qua Kita which the Captain gave them. Nei ther men nor women are alham’d to (hew their nakednefs, for indeed they are but a fort of human Bealls.. &gt; \ 1 [ So foon as the Ship arrives, they bring their Beeves to the (hore, with what other Commodities they have, to barter for Hrong Water and Tobacco, Cry- Hal or A gat Beads j or any fort of old Iron work. If they are not fatisffd with what you olfer them, away they fly; and then giving a whillle all their Cat- tel follow ’em ; nor lhall you ever fee ’em again. Some, when they faw ’em fly, would flioot and kill their Cattd } but after that for fome years they would never bring any more. ’Tis a very great convenience for the Veflels that touch there, to take in frelh Vidals \ and the Hollanders did well to build a Fort there. It is now a good handfom Town, inhabited by all forts, that live with the Hollanders *, and all forts of Grain, which are brought out of Eurofe or lAJia and fow’d there, come to better perfedion there then in other parts. The Coun try lies in thirty-five Degrees, and fome few 7 Minutes over, fo that it cannot be laid that either the heat or feituation of the Climate makes thefe C^/mfo black. Being defirous to know the reafon,and why they Hunk fo terribly,! learnt it from a Girl that was bred up in the Fort, who was tak’n from her Mother, as foon as fhe was born, and was white like our women in Europe } Hie told me, that the reafon why the Cafres are fo black is, becaufe they rub themfelves with a Qreafe or Ointment compos’d of feveral forts of Drugs} wherewith fliould they not anoint themfelves very often, and as foon as they were born, they fliould be come Hydropfical, as the Blacks of Africa, and the dbyjp.ns are ; or like the people of Saba, that never live above forty years, and are always troubl’d with one Leg twice as big as the other. Thefe Cafres , as bruitifh as they are, have yet fome knowledge of Simples, which they know to apply to feveral Difeafes 5 which the Hollanders have feveral times experienc’d. Of nineteen lick peribns that we had in our Ship, fifteen were committed to the care of thefe Cafresy being troubl’d with Ulcers in their Legs, and old wounds which they had re ceiv’d in the wars} and in lefs then fifteen days they were all perfedly cur’d Every one of thefe had two Caf es to look after him ^ and according to the con dition of the wound or Ulcer, they went and fetch’d Simples, which they bruis’d between two Stones, and apply’d to the fore. As for the other four,they werefo far gone with the Pox, that they would not trufl the Caf es with them, having been given over at Batavia, and fb they all dy’d, between the Caye and St. He~ lens. In the year iddi, a Gentleman of Britanny being at Batavia, wz* fo bit by the Gnats in the night, that his Leg exulcerated prefently in fuch a manner, as to puzzle all the arc and skill of the Chirurgeons in that Town. When became to the Cape of good Hope,the Captain of the Ship fending him a fhore, the Cafres came about him, and after they had beheld him, they told him if he would trnft to them they would cure him. The Captain thereupon committed him to their care, who cur’d him and made him a found man in lefi then fifteen days. When a Ship comes to an Anchor in the Cape, it is the fafhion for him that commands the Ship, to give leave to fome part of the Mariners and Souldkirs to go afhore to refrelli themfelves. The fickly have firfl leave by turns, and go to the Town, where they are dyeted and lodg’d for feven or eight Sous a day, and are very well us’d. v ' • It is the cuflom of the Hollanders, when they Hay here, to fend our parties of Sotildiers upon the difeovery of the up-land Country, and they that go fartheft are bell rewaaded. With this defign a party of Souldiers, under the Command a Serjsnt, far advanc’d in the Country , and night coming on, they made a great fire, as well to keep themfelves from the Lions, as to warm them felves,and fo laydown to fleep round about it.Being afleep,a Lion came andfeiz’doneof the Souldiers Ar^s, W^ch the Ser^gt ^rcfivj^g, to mediately r l0 t the Lion with his Carbine j but when he was dead, they had much ado to open the Lions mouth, to get out the Souldiers Arm. Thus it appears a vulgar error to believe that Lions would not come near the fire. As tor the Souldier, the cl fres cur’d his Arm in twelve days. There arc in the Fort abundance of Lion* and Tigers Skins ; among the reft, there was the Skin of a Horfe which theCV fres had kill’d } it was white,crofs’d with black ftreaks, fpotted like a leopard without a Tail. Two or three Leagues from the Hollanders Fort, there was a Lion found dead,with four Porcupines Qills in his body, the third part were- of had piercM his fiefti. So that it was judg’d that the Porcupine had kill’d the Lion. The Skin, with the Quills in it, |s kept in the Fort, A League from the Fort, is a fair Town, that grows bigger and bigger every day. When the Holland Company arrives there with their Ships, if any Souk dier or Mariner will live there,they are very glad of it.They have as much ground as they can mannage } where they have all forts of Herbs, and Pulfe, and as much Rice, and as many grapes as they can defire. They have alfo young Oftridges, Beef, Sea-fifh, and fweet water. To catch the Oftridges, when they pleafe, they got their Nefts when they were young, and driving a flake in the ground, tye the Birds by one Leg to the ftake, and when they are old enough they come and take them out of the Neft, from whence it is impoiFible to % away. When the Hollanders began to inhabit the Ca%e r they took a young Girl from her M°ther, as fbon as Ihe was born y fhe is white, only her Nofe is a little flat A French man got her with Child, and would have marry’d her y but the Com pany were fofar from permitting him, that they took away above a hundred Livres of the Maids wages from her, to punilh her for the mifdemeanour, which was fomewhat hard. \ There are great numbers of Lions and Tigers, which the Hollanders have a pretty invention to take; they faften a Carbine to a ftake, driv’n into the Earth, and lay meat round about the Gun, which meat is faften’d with a firing to the Trigger. So that when the Beaft fnatches the meat, the String pulls the Trig ger, and the Gun going off, hits the Lion either in the throat or the breall. The Cafres feed upon a Root like our Skerrets, which they roll and make bread of. Sometimes they grind it into flower, and then if tafts like a Wal nut/ For their food they eat the fame Root raw, with raw Filh *, with the En trails of Beafts, out of which they only fqueeze the ordure. As for the bowels of the wild Beafts, the women wear them dry’d about their Legs, cfpedally the bowels of thofe Beafts which their Husbands kill, which they look upon as a kind of Ornament. They allb feed upon T ortoifes,when they have fo far heat ed them at the fi e, as to make the Shells come off. They are very expert in darting their Az-agayJs ; and thofe that have none, make ufe of pointed fticks^ which they will lance a great way. With thefe they go down to the Sea-fide, and as foon as ever they fpy a Filh near the top of the water, they will not fell t0 ftrike him. '/ As for their Birds, which are like our Ducks, whofe Eggs are without any Yolk; they breed in fuch great quantities in the Country, that in a Bay about eighteen Miles from the you may knock them on the head with a Hick, The Hollanders once earn’d a young Cafre to tfie General at Batavia., who bred him carefully up, teaching him to underftand the Dutch and, Portugal lan guages perfectly well. At length being defirous to return into his Country, the General gave him very good Cloaths,and good Linnen,hoping that ho would have liv’d among the Hollanders, and been ferviceable to them in the dicovery of me Country, but fo foon as he got home,he fiunghis Cloaths i’ theSea,and returner wild among his fellow Natives, eating raw fielh as he did before, and quite for getting his Benefactors.

XXVII. The Holland Fleet arrives at St. Helens. The difeription of the Ijland IT Aving ftaid two and twenty dayes at the Cafe of good Hope, feeing that the A A Wind was favourable, we weigh’d, and fteer’d for St. Helens. When we were under Sail, the Mariners cry’d out, they would fleep till they came into St. Helens Road. For the wind is very conftant, and carries you in fifteen or eighteen days to the Road of the liland. All the trouble that our Mariners had was that fourteen days after our departure from the Cafe, they were often Forc’d to the T op-Malt head, upon difeovery ot the Ifland; for as foon as you difeover the Ifland, the Pilot mult take care to fleer to the Noth-iide of the Ifland be- caufe there is no calling Anchor but on that lide, and that very near the ihore too ; by reafon of the deepnefs of the water; for if the Anchors come not to take hoi;!, the current of the water and the wind carries the Ship quite out of the Road, which there is no recovering again, becaufe the wind never changes So foon as the Ships came to an Anchor, part of the Seamen were fent afhore to get wild Hogs, ot which there are great plenty; and to gather Sorrel which grows m great abundance; and indeed they not only fend the Seamembut all the Pigs, Sheep, Geeie, Ducks,and Pullets aboard,to feed upon that Sorrel, which pur ges them in fuch a manner,that in a few days they became fo fori h a t by that time we came to Holland they were hardly to be eaten. That Sorrel has the fame operation upon the men,who boiling their wild Swines flelh,Rice,and Sorrelto- gether, make thereof a kind of Potage fo excellent, that it keeps their bodies open by an infenfible purgation. There are two places upon the Coall of St. Helens where Ships may come to an Anchor. But the belt is that where we lay, by reafon that ground is very good,and for that the water that falls from the Mountain is the belt in the Ifland a this part of the Ifland there is no plain,for the.Mountain defeends to the very wore of the Sea. 3 It is not fo good anchoring in the other Road; but there is a very handfome plain, where you may fow or plant whatever you pleafe. There are great llore or Citrons, and fome Oranges, which the Vortugds had formerly planted there i or that Nation has that vertue, that wherever they come, they make the place me better for thofe that come after them ; whereas the Hollanders endeavour to oehroy all things wherever they fet footing. I confefs the Commanders are not or that humour, but the Sea-men and Souldiers, who Cry one to another, welhall never come hither any more, and out of greedinefs will cut down a whole tree initcad of gathering the fruit. Some days after there arriv’d a Tisrtugmu Veflel from Guiny, full of Slaves wmch were bound for the Mines of Tern. Some of the Hollanders that underitood’ the language of the Negro's, tol’d ’em how miferably they would be us’d, and hereupon the next n ight two hundred and fifty of them threw themfelves into the And indeed it is a miferable llavery ; for fometimes afterthey have min'd in ipine places for fome days together, the Earth being loofe, falls down and kills our or live hunder’d at a time.

CHAP. XXVIII. the Holland Fleet fets Sail from St. Helens, and proftem^ a r» rives in Holland. ^ H E next day after the Admiral had call’d a CounciI,we weigh’d and fet Sail 1 about ten a Clock at night. Three days after our departure from St. Helens, the Seamen were call’d very dully to prayers morning and evening; though all the time we ftaid in the rode, they never minded any fuch matter j which made me wonder, to find they fhould be more devout when they were out of danger, than when they were in jeopardy. ^ , After feveral other days failing,we difcover d the Coait of JJland, and then the Ifland of Fere Ha, v/here we join’d with the Holland Fleet that flay’d for us. Here it is that the Commander in chief calls to account all the Mariners for their mifde* meanoursduring the whole Voyage. ~ ^ Our Ship was bound for Zealand y but we were forc'd to lye out at Sea feven days before we could get into Flujhing, becaufe the Sand had chang’d its place. Coming to an Anchor before Finding, two of the Company came aboard to wel come us home, and to advife us to lock our Chefts, and put our marks upon them* for all Chefls are carry’d into the Eaft India Houfe, where when the owners come for them, they are order’d to op’n them, left they fhould have any counterband goods therein. Thereupon I fet a mark upon my Chefts, and went afhore, after I had giv’n a good chara&amp;er of the Captain, and his civility tome ail the Voyage, and thence proceed by Land to Middleburgk Four days after I came to Middlebargh, I went to fetch my Chefts j and find ing the two Directors there, one a Zealander, the other of Horn, who came firft aboard us ; I produc’d my Keys,and offer’d my Chefts to be open’d. But the ZtA- lander more civil than the Horner, deliver’d me my Keys again, and taking my word, told me I was free to take away my goods. And indeed I have always ob- ferv’d, that the Northern people are always more rude and ungentile than the Southern. As for the 17500 Florins which the General of Batavia promis’d fhould be paid me upon my arrival in Holland,, I receiv’d fo many delays and put offs, that I was at length forc’d to commenced a Suit that lafted above two years j nor coulu I get a publick Notary either at Amfterdam or the Hague, that would make me out a proteft^ every one fearing the Directors, who were both Judges an ar ties. At length after five years wrangling and jangling,the Diredor wrote to my Brother at Batavia (Tor I was then return’d again to the Indies) that it 1 vvouiq accept of 10000 Livres, he might receive it for me j which he did, and was forc’d to give them an acquittance form the whole. , This is the return which I made from the Indies in the year 1 only time that ever I return’d by Sea •„ having perform’d all the Klt ot l Travels by Land, not counting my ffiort Voyages through the for any thing.

By Ji B.

But when my Affairs afforded me any re- miffion, I wholly employ’d thofe fpare hours, in the eolle&amp;ion of things the molt worthy to be remark’d^ whether the Scene lay in Turkey, or in Perjia, or in the $ On this, of the other fide of the River Ganges , or in the Diamond-Mines $ which are in the Territories of divers Princes. While! ani bu lled in putting into order thofe Memories, whifch Icoiieeive my felf oblig’d to gratify the Publick withal^ I make it £ Prefent of this Relation of the Seraglio, attended with foirie Obfer- vations fufficiently remarkable, which, haply, will not be un- pleafant. The Ottoman Court, which makes fo much ttpife in the World, has not, to my thinking, been yet fufficicntly well luiown, if I may judge of it, by what I have feen thereof my felf, and have heard from feveral Perfbns. I do here com municate a faithful and ample defcription thereof: which I have extra£fed, as well out of what I had bbferv’d my felf, iii the feveral Voyages I made to Conjlantinopk, as out of the infor mations l receiv’d from two intelligent Perfbns, who had {pent many years in the Seraglio, in very confidefable Employments. One of whom was a Sicilian, advanc’d to the Charge of Cbaf-. ttadar-bachi, or chief Officer belonging to the Trcafury ; and after Five and Fifty years Service in the Seraglio, was, for fome “ight mifcarriage committed by him; banifh’d to a place near Burfa, in Natalia, from whence he hiade his efcape into the Indies. The other, a Pdrijian-born, named De Viennej had been one of the Pages of the Treafury. In his Return from me Jubilee at Rome, in the Year M.DC.Li being aboard as 'tigantine bound from Civiia Vecchid to Mdrjeilles , hb Was 2 ) . fakedfcnt him, as a Prefent, to the Grand Seignor.

And this is the Origine of the Great Perlbns belonging to the Grand Seignor^ and the Port. They are all Slaves 3 and not having any knowledge of their Pa- *cms, or Relations, they wholly apply their Affe&amp;ions to the Service of their Prince, who has been pleas’d to advance them to llicjh high Fortunes. ThcBaJjas therefore are taken out of the Order of the Ichoglans, and the name of &amp;TA or Bajha^ is only a Title of Honour and Dignity, common to all the Grandees oi the Port, who are diftinguilhable, according to the difference of their Charges. The four Principal are thde. The Vtzir-Azem^ or Grand Fiar, the Caimacan^ the IGJJa of the Sea^ and the Aga of the Janizaries. The Authority of thefe four Baffa’s is fo great, that fometimes they deprive their Sovereign of the Crown, and beftow iron whom they pleale 5 as it has happen’d, incur Age, to two Emperours imme diately fucceeding one the other, Mujiapha and Ofman, of whom the later dy’d in Pri- ibn, by the infamous hand of a common Executioner. But on the other fidc/if theie Jaffa's know not how to take their meafures rightly, they lofe their heads upon the leak mifearriage, the Grand Seignor feizing to himfelf all their Eftates at their death, and taking their Children into the Seraglio. Nay, thefe laft are fo far from fuc ceeding their Fathers, either as to wealth or imployments, even though it were the Son of a Grand Vizir^ or of a Siffer of theEmperour himfclf, that the higheft ad vancement they are admitted to, is to be made Captains ot Gallics; the policy of the lurks not permitting, that in any one Houfe there fhould be a transference of power from Father to Son, that fo they may be prevented from taking any occafions todifturb the State. It may be feen by this account of them, that the fortuneof the Batffts, which for a time feems do fplendid, is but a tottering fortune, upon which ^either the Son, nor the Father himfelf, what repute foever he may be in, can make any fure reliance. The Baffa's^ who have the denomination of Vizirs^ carry three Banners or Stan dards, at the top of which there is a Horfe-tayl faffen’d, put into what colour they pleafe themfelves, green only excepted, though they are permitted to paint the Staff, to which the Standard is faften’d, with that colour. The OHgine of thisCuftom tvis thus, according to the Story which the Turkj relate of it. Having one day given Battel to the Chriftians, their Standard was taken in the heat of the Engagement, and the General of the ‘furies perceiving that the lofs of the Standard was a difeou- ragement to the Souldiers, who were beginning to take their flight, he with a Cy- mitar cut off a Horfe’s tay 1 , and faffen’d it to the top of a Half Pike, and advanc’d it on high, crying out. Here is the Grand Standard^ let him who loves me follow me. Im mediately the Imks te-affum’d Courage, and having rally’d, renew’d the Charge, and gain’d the Vi&amp;ory. The Officers who are about the Petfons of theBaffa’s, have alfotheir Standards, but they are not allow’d to add thereto one of thoie tay Is; and it is to be obferv’d, that theBajfa's, who are not Ekin', can carry but two of them 5 as the fer, who are inferiour to the Baffa% and Governours of lefler Provinces, tarry but one of them. When the Grand Seignor goes into the Country, jdiere are leven Stanards carry’d, in regard that according to the the world is divided into fey en parts, or (even Cl imats whereof the Grand Seignor is Mafteiy if taken according to its breadth, and ’tis for that reafbn that in their Language, they give him the Title of Mafter of all Kings. This is grounded upon what Mahomet faid, J hat be, who after his death, Ihould be Mafter of thofe Territories, where his Sepulchre were found, fhould afliime the Title of Mafter or Chief of all the Emgs upon Earth. They add, that there are but three Empires, which are, tnoie of Con ft ant inop le^ Babylon and ‘frebizvnd : And ’cis foi* that reafon, that the wind Seignor wears three plumes of black Heron-tops in his Turbant. Take Notice by the way, that they are only the Herons of Candia which have their mps perfe&amp;y black, the Herons of all other Countries having them, either w hite, or of a mixt Colour.

He is attended by, and has Grand Vizir a ®^ ant to f n ^e Divan, fix Other Vizirs, whom they call Vizirs of the bench and who are properly Gcunfellors of State, but yet fuch as have not any deliberative voice, and come not into the Divan, but only to be confulted upon iome point of Law, wherein they are well skill’d, without intermcdling With the government of the State 5 or concerning rhcmfelves in any Affair, unlefs their advice be requir'd. There are alfo five Begkrbeys , on whom the Grand Seignor beftoWs the qualifi cation of Vizirs, and are poflefs’d of the greateft anh wealthieft Governments of the Empire, to Wit, the Bajjas of Babylon, Cairo, Buda, Natalia and Romania. The three former, who are the three principal, had heretofore the priviledge (exclufively to all the other Baffa's ) of having caricd before them (in the fame manner as the Gmi Vizir had) the three Horfe-tay Is, of which I have related the Story. But at the pre- fent, that priviledge extends to the two other Baffa’s of Natalia and Romania, and they are all five equal, as to that point. I am now to return to the Grand Vizir, who has a magnificent Court, anfwerable to the greatnefs of the Mafter, whom he ierves, and there are in his houfe above two^ thoufand Domefticks. Though he lyes expos’d, as Well as the other Baps, to the indignation of the Prince, and forced to fend himnis Head, when herequireskj yet does the Grand Seignor, in the Affairs of greareft importance, and fuch as con cern the State, comply much with the Sentiments of his Grand Vizir, and his Propofiti- ons in Council are as fb many definitive Sentences. TTisthat which renders bis Power fo ablolute , that in all the Empires and Kingdoms of the World , there is not any chief Minifter of State whofe Authority can be parallel’d to that of thcGrad Vizir. ' Whoever comes to make him a Vifit, herifes notout of his Chair, either to give him a reception, or to conduft him out again, unlefs it be the Mufti, who is the principal Perfon relating to the Law ( of Mahomet) upon whofe accefs,the Grand Seig nor himfelf rifes from his Throne. But this particularly worth our obfervation, That as it belongs only to the Grand Vizir, topropofe all Affairs of importance^ fq does it concern him to be very careful, not to advance any thing that may bedil- pleafing to the Grand Seignor 5 for if it fhould fb happen, he gives immediate Order for the ftrangling of him, without making him any anfwer atall, upon thisMaxintf of the Ottoman Court, that there muft not be any thing propos’d to the Prince, which may give him any caufe of dilfatisfaTion. A Priviledge The Caimacan is the Captain, and Governour of the City of Conftantinople, Lieutc- particular to nant to the Grand Vizir, yet fo as not to have any Authority, but only in his abfence j the Caimacan. And then he performs all the fundtions of that important Charge; he has the abfolute Command and gives Audienceto Ambaffadors. He is not fubjedf, asthe other fas are, to that rigorous ncceffity of refigning his Head ; upon this account, that if he does any thing. Which may be difplcafing to the Grand Seignor, he lays the blame thereof upon the Grand Vizir, from whom he receives his Orders. , The BaffaoftbeSeais the Admiral, and Captain-General of the NavalForccs. &lt; The Beys, Goycrnours of the Maritime Provinces, and fuch as are oblig’d to maintain tne Gi a. id Seignor’sGaUcys in good order, are to obey the Commands they receive item him, and to go to Sea upon the firft ad vertifement they receive to that purpofe. f mJ. Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. The Janizary-Jga 9 whom xhe lurkf call Tengeri-Agafij is the Colonel-General, of The number the Janizaries. The Charge is very conhderable, inafmuch as the Turl$h Infantry ^at thc . real J ani this time, does for the moff part pafs tinder the name of Janizam, though fuch as ak ZarlCS * really Janizaries, who derive their Inftitution fkm Ottoman the Firft, and their great Priviledges from Amurath the Third, do not at this day amount to a Body of above five and twenty thoufand Men. They have excellent Regulations amongft thcmfelves and are diflnbuted into feveral Chambers, in the fpacioiis Lodgings, whereof they are pofTefs d, whether it be at Conftsntinople, or in other places. The order pbferv*d there is [o excellent in all things, and fo exactly maintain’d, that they live more like Religi ous Perlons, than Sou'diers 5 and though they are not forbidden to marry yet it is Very feldom that they do it. The great Priviledges which they enjoy all over the Empire, wherein they are fo highly refpe£ted, induce abundance of Pcrfons, meerlv m order to their exemption from the paying of Taxes,and their being difchara’d from pubhek Duties, to prevail with the Officers, by Money, toprote&lt;adiem, and make them pals tor janizaries. But they receive no Pav from the Prince, and all their ad vantage is reftram’d to the enjoyment of chofe Pfiviledges, which indeed are great enough. It is by this intermixture of the real Janizaries, with thofe who arc admit- ted by corruption, that the number of them amounts at this day to above a hundred thoufand; and yet not accounting any but luch asare effe&amp;ively Janizaries, theirBodv has lometimes been fo dreadful, as that they have unthron’d the Ottoman Monarchs and chang’d the whole face of the Empire of a fudden.

A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio, And thus you have an account of the principal charges and DignitiesoftheHrnn^ all poheis’d by Perfons taken out of the rank of the Ichoglans. I now come to If 5 Officers of the Seraglio, and in regard they are Eunuchs, on whom the Grand Se' nor bellows the mod eminent Charges, and who, bdides, haye the Government a the Ichoglans ^ I (hall follow the order of the things, in my placing of them here 'r fore I fay ought of the fecond order or rank of tributary Children, or fuch as J' taken in War, who are the Azamoglans. Of the Eunuchs there are alfo two ranks. There are fome white, who have en dur’d only a fimple caftration 5 and there are black ones, who haveall cut off even with the belly. Both forts of them are fevere, humorous and morofe, and their Treatments are almoft infupportable to allthofe who are under their Charge. Them is a prodigious number of them, as well in Conftantwople, as all over the Empire and generally all over the Eaftern parts of the World, where there is hardly a private Perfon,having any thing of abilities, but keeps an Eunuch or two, asSentinels over his Women. And ’tis this that caufes fb great a commerce of Eunuchs in feveral partsof d fia and Jfrkk^ and in the flngle Kingdom of Cokonda^ where I chanc’d to be in the year 1659. there were put off of the n in that very year about two and twenty thou- fand. It comes into my mind, that the Grand Mogor's Ambaflador, in whofeCoun- try that Barbarifm is not differ’d, but the Eunuchs he makes ufe of are brought out of other places, took me one day afide, to tell me that he car’d not how foon he re turn’d into his own Country, out of the fear he was in, left that Kingdom of Ohnda . might fink into the ground, after flich cruelties. Moil of the Fathers and Mother^ who are extreamly poor, and have no love for their Children, and whom they are alfo afraid that they cannot maintain, have no other fhift, upon thegfirfl dearth of Provifions, than to fell them to certain Merchants, who afterwards have them gelt, and fometimes make clear work, and cut of all Some of thofe who have not any thing left, when they would urine, are forced to make ufe of a little Cane or Pipe, and to put it to the bottom of the belly. And whereas few efcape after fo dangerous an operation , fuch are accordingly much dearer than the others, and they are fold in Perfa and turkgy at the rase of fix hundred Crowns; when a hundred, or a hun dred and fifty, is the price of the ordinary Eunuchs.^ For the fupply therefore of all Turkey, all Perfa, all the Indies, and all the Provinces of Africa, it may be eafily judg’d that there muft come millions of them from feveral places. The Kingdom of Colcmda, in thePeninfula on this fide Ganges, and the ^Kingdoms of Affran, Boutan, Arachan, and Pegu, on the other fide of it, afford a prodigious number of them. All thefe Eunuchs are either white, or of duskifh colour. The black Eunuchs, who are brought out of Africa, much inferiour in point of number, are, as I faid, much the dearer. The moft deformed yield the greateft price, their extream uglinefs being look’d on as beauty in their kind. A flat Nofe, a frightful Afpeff, a large Mouth, thick Lips, the Teeth black, and handing at a diftance one from another (for ordi narily the Moors have fair Teeth) are fo many advantages to the Merchants who fell them. The Seraglio at Conftantinopk is full of thefe two forts of Eunuchs : The black are defign’d for the cuftody of the Apartment where the Women are, andfent to Court by the Bajfa’s of Grand-Cairo. The white, who are fomewhat lefsfavage, and have been educated with fome care, are for the Grand Seignor’s own Apart ment. The principal The four principal Eunuchs, who approach the Prince’s Perfon, are the Hazodak- Charges of the chi, the Chafnadarhachi, the Ktlargibachi, and the Sarai-Agafi, who have for their oil- Seraglio. periour the Capi-Aga, who has the fuperintendency of all the Chambers of the lekgr Ians. They ordinarily fucceed one the other, that is to fay, the Sarai-Agaf Succeeds the Kilargihdchi ; the Kdargibachi fucceeds the Cbafnadarbachi ^ and the laft named iuc- ceeds the Hazodahachi ; and in fine, the Hazodabacbi fucceeds the Capi-Aga, who is always of the longeft (landing in fervice of the white Eunuchs. . The noble Ad- The Capi-Aga, or Capou-Agaji, is as it were the Grand Mafter of the Seraglio, he is vantages of the t [ lc principal in dignity and repute of all the white Eunuchs, and he is always near the Grand Seignor’s Perfon, where-ever he is.

Tented to bis Highnefs, of which he makes great Advantages. No Man can enter into the Emperour’s Apartment, nor get out of it, without his Order; and when the Grand Vizir would fpeak to him, ’tis the Capi-Jga’s place, to take and prefent him to his Highnefs. Whether it be by night or by day, if there happen Tome preffing Affair, whereof the Vizir would give the Grand Seignor immediate notice in wri ting, the Capi-Jga receives it from him and brings him the anfwer thereto. He wears his Turbant in the Seraglio, and rides up and down on Horfe-back, by a Priviledge particularly annex’d to his Charge. He accompanies the Grand Seignor even into the Apartment of the SukanefTes, but he flays at the door, as having no Command in that place. WEcn he leaves the Seraglio, upon his being difmifs’d from his Charge ? which very feldom happens, he cannot be a Raff a. As to his Table, all is at the Prince’s Charge, and he has over and above ten Suit mines a day, which amount to fixty Livers, French Money. There have been iome Capi-Aga’s who have dy’d worth two millions, all which return’d into the Grand Seignor’s Coffers. The chief of the white Eunuchs is attended by four others, who next to him have the principal Charges of the Grand Seignor’s Quarter. The Hazodahachf is, as it were, the Lord High-Chamberlain, having under hig Chargetheforty Pages of the Chamber, who ordinarily approach the Grand Seig nor’s Per Ton. The Serai-Agafi has the general Superintendency of all the Chambers of the Grand Seignor’s Quarter, as to what relates to Embellifhment, and the neceffary Repara tions. He has'a particular inlpc&amp;ion over the Seferh Odafi, which is the Chamber of the Pages, who are to look after the Grand Seignor’s Linnen, and attend him in his ProgrefTes. ’Tis incumbent alfoupon him to give Order for their Cloaths, and whatever die they (land in need of t And his Charge does fomewhat refemble that of Captain of the Louver~Ca(ile, in France^ fince it is his work generally to makepro- vifion for whatever may contribute to the decency and well-ordering of that great Palace.

The Giritbey is the chief Dirc&amp;or of thofe who are exercis’d in fhooting with the Bowe, and calling the Dart. Theletwo txercifcs are much pradlis’d every Friday^ in a place of the Seragll^ appointed for that Divcrtilement. Thus have vou, in few words, an account of whatever relates to the principal Charges of the Seraglio, pofleiVd by tbofe who have pals’d through the Chambers of the Ichoglans. The Blacky, nr Negro -Fwmchs, of whom I have but a word more to fay, additio nally to what I have intimated b;fore 5 areappointed to guard the Appartment of the Women, and they make choice, for that Office, of the moll deform’d and the mofl: JEfopical , that can be found. They are all cut even with the belly ^ ever fince the time of Solyman the Second, who being one day in the fields, and feeing a Gelding , offering to leap a Mare, inferr’d thence, that the Eunuchs, who Kept his Wives, might likewile endeavour to fatisf/e their paffions ; for which he bethought himfelf of aprefent remedy, by ordering them tohave all cut off; and his Succefiors have fince obErv d that Rule. T here is a great number of thofe Regro-Eunuchs, and they have their variety of Chambers, and their Regulations, as the white ones have. I fay nothing here of their different Employments, and the Reader will find, in the Chap ter concerning the Appartment of the Women , all can be known, that’s certain Upon that Subjedt 1 he Kijlar- Agaft, or, as others name him, thewhich is as much, in The credit and. our Language, as to fay , the Guardian of the Virgins , is the chiefeft of all the Negro- walthofthe Eunuchs, and is of equal authority and credit with the Capi-Aga, who is the Supreme of the white Eunuchs. T he former is the Overfecr of the Appartmeni of the Wo- Appaftment of men, has the Keys of the Doors in his cuflody, and has accefs to the Emperor when the Women. he pleafes himfelf. The charge he is poflefs’d of brings him in Prefents from all parts 5 and there are not any fuch made to the Sultannefles, by the Bajfa’s, and other Per- lons, who hand in need of their favour, in reference to the Sultan, but there comes along with it one to himfelf, which makes him one of the richeff and mofl: confidera- blc Officers, belonging to the Seraglio. I come now to the Azamoglans , who make the fecond Order of young Lads, wherewith the Seraglio is replenifh’d, and out of Whole number they take fueh as for mean Officers, of whom I fhall give you the Lift. The Azamoglans as well as the ichoglans, are, as I laid before, Tributary Children, taken away from the Chriftians or made Captives, by Sea r or Land. Thev make choice of the handfomeft , the beft fhap’d, and moft robuft, for the Seraglio, and they have neither Wages nor allowances of any profit, unlefs they be advanc’d to ome Imall employ ments. Nor can they attain thofe , till after many years Ser vices, and what is then allow’d them docs not amount to above four Afpers and a nail per diem. As for thofe who are brought up in other places, under the fimple uenomjnatnon oiAzamcglaus, and are not receiv’d into the Seraglio at CoifiaminopU i t] Wn UnC c an amqynt no higher, than to become Zanizaries. - When thefe young Boys are brought up to Conftantiwple, the firft diftribution which made of them is into the Seraglio’s, or Royal Houfes of the Grand Seignor: there re iome of them left in the City, to be put to Trades, and others are fent to Sea, to j rvetorfeamcn, and fo gain experience in Navigation, by which means they capaci- e tnemfdyes for fomc Employments. But to confine our difeourfe to the Azamo- ibnT rC r C1 T^ ^ nt0 t ^ c Seraglio , they are imploy’d .in feveral Offices, and and r* 0 t lcrn are nia ff c B.fiangis , fbme Capigis, fome Atagis , ibme Halvagis , I cari^ 5 w ^ c h terms I fhail explicate to the Reader in as few words as whnf C are ly ho are employ’d in the Gardens of the Seraglio, out of Bria C I 113111 j th ey take out Thofe who are to row in the Grand Seignor’s the 5 n ^ as a a m ^ nc f to divert himfelf in fiftiing, or take the air upon mav k 0 a -hhey who thus ferve in the Brigantines, and row on the right hand* nlarpc C fuc Cd r ?- t ^ e c h ar G e °f Boflangi-Bacbi, which is one of the moft conftderable mpnn v C ^ e i ^ era §ho: But they who row on the left hand, are capable only of the arv t^Pfcyments, Wich are beftow’d in the Gardens.

That gives him accefs to the prince’s Perfon, to whom he m C fpeak familiarly when he carries him by Sea 5 for he has his Seat at the Helm of the Brigantine, wherein the Grand Seignor is, who mod: commonly makes ufe of him, to carry his Orders to fome Baffa^ when he would have his Head All the Grandees of the Port hand in Awe of him, and endeavour to gain his Affe&amp;ion by their Prefents, becaufe it lies in his power, to do them either good or bad Offices about the Prince, whom he can difpoie as he pleafes, when he has him abroad upon the Water. For being as ’twere at his hlbow, and having the whip of the Rudder in his hand, with the priviledge of fitting in his Pre- fence, that he may the more eafiiy Govern it, he has then the opportunity to entertain him with Aftairs of State, and the Condu£t of the Bajf a \ and an- fwerable to his Pailion or Intereft, clearly to Acquaint him how things pals or' turn and difguifethem as he pleafes. In fine, if he be highly in Favour, he may obtain one of the great Governments, and become Bajfaoi Buda, Babjlonl 01 Cako nay haply Grand Vizier^ which is the mod: eminent Charge of the Empire. The Capigu are the Porters or Keepers of the Gates of the Seraglio, that is to fay, of the firft and fecond Courts; for the third Gate, which gives enterance into the inner Seraglio, is kept by Eunuchs. The Chief of the Capigu is call’d CafgMi^ who has under him other Officers, bearing the fame Name; and whom the Grand Seisrnor makes ufe of, to carry his Orders. The Cafi-Aga is above all. The Attagif are the Cooks of the Seraglio, over whom as well as over the the Kilargi-baebi has full Power Every Kitchin has its Attagi-bachi, that is to lay, its chief Dire&amp;or, or Mafter-Cook. And the Moutbak^Rmin is the Intendantor Over- feer, who fupplies the Kitchens with all that is necefiary, taking care alfo for the Tables of the Amballadors, according to the Orders he has receiv’d from thzGmi Vizir. The Hahagif are the Confe&amp;toners, of whom I fhall have occafion to fpeak more at large ellewhere. They givealfo the fame Name to thofe who ferve the Grandees of the Seraglio, and are permitted to go out of it and into it, when thev pleafe. The Baltagi* are a robud: fort of People, imploy’d in the carrying of Burthens, as Poners,and Cleavers of Wood arc amongd us. Baltagi implies properly a Labouring Man, who makes ule of the Wedge. . The Hafteler-Agafi is the Overfeer of the Infirmary, who obferves what comes m ^and what goes out, and efpecially that there be no Wine brought im ^ fhall have occafion alfo, in my Relation, to fpeak of two others, to wit, thc Em rahour-bachi^ and the Ekrneggi-bacbf who are two Officers belonging to the Sultan, but have their Habitations out of the Seraglio. The Emirahour-bacbi is the great Gentelman-Ufher, who goes before the Grand Seignor, when he appears in publick, and in all Ceremonies. . 1 he Ekpieggi-bacbt is the Mader-Baker, who has the over-fight, and gives di rect on for the Baking of all the Bread that is Eaten in the Seraglio. Tnele two Employments are not be flow'd on any of thofe who have their Abode With n the Seraglio, but to Perfbns who live out of it, but have the Liberty °*J, n g rc k lnt0 egrefs out of it, at any time. ci? k? % ort 5 I fhall have occafion to fpeak of the Caragi-bacbi, and of thc Cbm or the Leffer ‘Tartar}^ and I have fbme curious Obfervations to make upon both or them.

They muft of neceiiity find it out, and it is no hard matter for them to do, in regard that of all the Tributes, Cuftoms, arid other Impofitions due to the Grand Seignor, there is not any thing pay’d till the end of the Year, and thcfe Officers oblige Men to the payment thereof, at the begining of it. All forts of Perlbns, what Religion foever they are of, except the Mabumetan, are oblig’d to pay the Tribute without any exception, from the time of their fettling in the Empire, and having attain’d the fixteenth year of their Age. And this Tribute, or ]?oll-Money, amounts to five hundred and fifty old Afters, which neither rife nor fall, but always keep at the fame rate of eighty, to a Viaftro, which, in the French Mony, and confequently with litle difference in ours, amounts to five Crowns and J-. All other Clmjlians who come into the Empire, upon the fcore of Trade, or Bufi- hefs, though ’twere but for one day, are forc’d to pay, at the firfl: City where they arrive. T he forreign Gmkj, fuch as they from Mufcovy or other places, pay three hundred arid fifty Afters ; but the Armenians, who come from Verfia, Georgia, Mingrelia, and other Countreys, are tax’d but at three hundred. As to the Cbrijtians , whom they call Frangm, they pay nothing 5 and that has given much trouble to the Ambaf- fadors of Europe^ efpecially to the French Ambaflador, there being more French that are Inhabitants in iurkey, than there arc of any other Nation. And yet though the lurks make their Year to confifi but of twelve Moons, ours being near twelve and a half, they make the Tributaries pay but for twelve Moons; yet in requital, and that nothing may be loft, they make them pay that Tribute double, every three and thirtieth year, and are very frugal Husbands for the beqifit and advantage of their Mafier. There are but two Princes in the World that, are known by the Name of Cham, The policy of the to wit, theEmperour of great fart ary, andtheKing ofthe Yittte'fartary, a Vaflal to Port,to\eep the the Ottoman Monarchs. I conceive my felf oblig’d, to give the Reader fome infer- Chamo/ffo? . mation of the prefent condition of the latter. When the Cham of the lefter Tartary Tartary enters npon the Government, he comes to take his Oath of Fid^ity to the Grand ^ * Seignor, and the Turks look upon him no otherwife than asaGovernour of a Pro vince , or at moft, but as a Vaffal-Prince. But thofe of his own Countrey , the Mufcovites, the Foies, the Georgians, the Mingrelians^ and the other Nations bordering upon him, treat him as a King, when they write to him. The Grand Seignor ufes much Policy towards the Cham, left: he fhould revolt from him, and render him- felf more powerful than he is, by Alliances with the neighbouring Princes. For it is to be observ’d, That the Idler Tartary, whereof the City Caffa, near the Cimerian Strcight,_ is the metropolis, is not a Countrey fubdu’d by the Arms of the Ottomans. The ancient Kings of it did only put themfelvcs under the Grand Seignor’s protedT on who receiv’d them into it, upon condtion, that when the Father dy’d, his Son, or the next of kin, his fucceffor, was not to enter upon the Government, till he had receiv’d the Inyeftiture from the Port, and taken the Oath of Fidelity to the Grand , Seignor, obliging himfelf to come to him upon the firft: Orders to that purpofe* The Grand Seignor promis’d in requital, that he would not eftablifti any other than what were of their Race, ro command in the JLeffer Tart ary. And Jwreas there are two Branches of that Family, he keeps one of them always baniffi’d in the Ifland of Rhodes, while the other Governs. But if, after Fifteen or Twenty Years,_ there fhould be any fufpition of this latter Family’s having a delign, to render it felt abfolute, he lends for the Cham and his Children, when he has any, and fending them to Rhodes, brings thence him who was there exile, and orders him to reign in his turn, for fome years. The form of his Oath yoti Will find in the fixth Chapter op my Relation, where I fpeak of the Hall for Audience, and the manner, in which that Prince is there received. I have only now fome what to fay of the Moufti, the Cadilefquer, and the Cadis The principal and the others Relating to the Law, which 1 fhall do in few words. Only let it be Di i^nes of nere obferv’d in the general. That, according to the perfwafion of the Turks, the Civil Laws are part of their Religion, and that having been given them by their ' ^ 1 rophet, they are deriv’d from God, and require an implicite obedience. ’Tis PX ft^s courfe, that they are^ kept within their duty, and that they obey the r&gt;f TVt milC1 out 0 .^ a P r ^ nci *pl e Religion and Confciepce, as out of the fear 1 crialiilcment 5 and in that they do not much recede from pur Ckriftian Maximcs. (C) TheThe Mouftis and the Cadis pafs therefore indifferently under the NamToFfer' well skill’d in the Law, as if we fhould reduce_ our Divines and our Civil Law 3 yers into the lame Clals, and in civil and criminal Caules the Moufti is of te i rnnfiilrprl. The Moufti is the honourary Chief of the Law all over the Empire, and account ed to be the Interpreter of the Alchoran. I fpeak of the Grand Moufti oiCon^antml who is the moll efreetrfd, and the principal of all. For there are feveral others of them in Turkey, over whom he has no more jurifdi&amp;ion, than he has over the 7^/ or Priehs; every one of them fiibmitting themfelves only to the Magiftrate and there being no Eccleliaftical Superiority amongft them. That hinders not but that the Grand Moufti is honoured by all the refh, and in great veneration among theTW The Grand Seignor never bellows that Dignity, but upon a Perfon of great abilities ’ and great integrity; he often confults him in the Affairs of greatefl importance; he always follows his DkecHons, and he is the only Perfon in the World, at whole approach he rifes up to receive him. The Cadikfcmrs follow the Moufti) and are Judges-Advocates of the Militia the Souldiers having this Priviledge, That they are judg’d only by them ; whence they alfo call them. Judges ef the Armies. There are but two of them all over the Em pire, the Cadilefquer of Romania) and the Cadilefquer of NatcHa, who are in higheft effeem next to the Moufti) and have their Seats in the Divan, immediately next to the Grand Vizir. The Mollah) or Moula- CadiS) are the Judges of great Cities, who recive their Com- miflions from the CadilefquerS) to whom there may be an Appeal made from their Sentence, in Civil Concerns only * for as to the Criminal part, the Caufc is foon de cided, and the lead: Judge condemns to death without any Appeal. The Cadis are tinder the Mollah) and ought to be well vers'd in the Laws andCu- floms of the Countrey. They have alfo under them the Naips, who adminilter Juftice in the Villages, and that is done with much expedition, without the help of Pro&amp;ors, or Advocates* The ImanS) or EmaumS) are the priefts of the Turks, and as ’twere the Parfons of their Mofqueys, where they take care that all things be done in order, and at the times appointed. The Hogias are the Doctors of the Law,and as It were the Regents,and Infinites of Youth. The Sheify are to them, inftead of Preachers, and they make publick Exhor tations. The Muezims are they,who cry upon the Towers of the Mofqueyyo call the People together at the hour of Prayer 5 the Turks, not ufing any Bells, nor the Cbriftm 3 in the Levant. The Vervis are Religious Men, among the Turks, who live poorly, and indeed the very word fignifies/w. They are for the mod part ridiculoufly cloath’d, and all, ge nerally, great Hypocrites.The Different Species of Goldl and Silver-Coins, the Imall Money now current in t u R TOGETHER WITH THE \ ' ■ \ ■ v HISTORY OF THE TRADE In Five Sols Pieces (French Money) and the Abolition of it.

Some of them are of that Country, whence the Queen of Sheba came, and which is now call'd the King dom of labour. Others come from places at a greater diftance, and they have lometimes fifteen days journeys to make, and cannot meet with any Waters to drink* but what are corrupt,and deftrinStive to health : which I found but too true my felf, jyhen I crofs’d the Defarts of Arabia. If by chance they come to fdme Cottage or Hut, where they have kill’d an Elephant, it is a place for them to feaft in. This confider’d, we need not wonder at the fhort lives of thofe miferable People, whofe Bodies are deflroy’d in thofe Voyages* and who for the mo ft part do not exceed forty years of Age. The cafe is the fame with thofe, who trade with the Fortu- guejes, on the Grafts of Melinda and Mozambico, the corrupt Waters they are forc ’4 to drink in their way make them hydropical at five and twenty years of Age, and generally, all the fevefal peoples of the Kingdom of Sabour, have the right Leg iwell’d’ and twice as big as the left, and feldom exceed five and thirty years. ihe fmcerity of , ’Tis a miraculous thing to fee the fidelity wherewith thofe poor Abyjjines de- the Abyflfme^ mcar * themfelves in trading, as well thofe of the Southern parrs, who are Cbrijii* an C as thofe^f the North, who border upon Egypt, and are Mahumetans.

But to return to the French, the firft concern’d in this Hiftory, to which it is time to put a period. In the heat of their Commerce, and while all things were very well with them, they thought it not enough, to carry away the richeft Merchant dizes, but they alfo bought up all forts of good Money they could meet withal' and brought it into France, to carry on and continue the coinage of their counterfeit pieces. This Trade was carry’d on fo far 3 thro’ the whole extent of that vaft Empire, and there? was fo prodigious a quantity of that counterfeit Mony fpread abroad, that it was found by the Regifter-Books of the Farmers of the Cuftoms, that the Jim 0 f what had been difpers’d of it amounted to an hundred and fourfeore millions of Livers, not accounting what had never come to their knowledge, and what Sea men, and other private Peiions might have conceal’d. The other Merchants and Traders of Europe, who brought none but good Money, having exclaim’d againft that diforder, and renew’d their complaints to the Grand Vizir$ the Turks at laft open’d their eyes, and that principal Minifter, having com prehended, that if the thing continu’d,' in a Ihort time, inftead^ of Silver, there would be nothing but Copper in the Empire, prohibited the bringing in of any more of thofe pieces of five Sols, upon pain of confilcation, and great penalties to be inflidfed on thofe, who durft do any thing contrary thereto. Yet could not that crying of them down, and the Grand Vizier's prohibition make the Souldiers who ferv’d in Candia, out of love with thofe little pieces, the beauty Whereof they were fo much taken Withal Notwithffanding all the Remonfinances that could be made to them, they would not be paid in any other kind of Money } and fome difeontented Perfons and Mutineers beginning to Ihew their Teeth, they Were forced immediately to fend Galleys to Smyrna, and fome other Cities of great Commerce, to bring away all that could be found of that fort of money. The incredible quantity of thofe counterfeit pieces, difpers’d in all the Provinces of the Ottoman Empire, is at lafl Van idl’d, they are grown red, and no longer current. At the Firfl crying down of that counterfeit money, before the news of it could have been brought to foreign Countries, a certain Perfon named Goulin, engag’d all he had in the world, to make up to the funn of five and twenty thoufand Crowns in thofe Pieces of five Sols, fo extremely falflfyd, that there was hardly fo much Sil ver as was requifite to whiten them. He came to Smyrna, where I then was, and where he foon found, that there was no Way to put on his counterfit Merchandize. Whereupon he imagin’d, that he might get it off, if he could make Y fpeedy Voyage to Conftantinople, where, as he had been affnr’d, fome Perfons took them, even after they had been cry’d down. Being unwilling to hazard all by Sea, he fent away, by Land, four or five thoufand Crowns, which were taken away by Thieves, neat Burfa, and carry’d the much greater part to Cmfiantinople in a Dutch Veflel, of which he had alfo fnfRcient caule to repent him. Aftef Re had expos’d it at the Cufjom- houfe, for the payment of the Duties, the Chief Officer of the Cuftoms told him, that he might return within two or three days, to take back what belong’d to him; and as foon as the other was gone, he caufd all to be melted down in his prefence. The feperation being made, upon twenty thoufand CroWns, which was the fumne had brought thither, there Was not the full fourth part of Silver, and the Merchant doming again to the Cuftomer, fell down all along, out of pure fear left a feverepu- nifhment might follow the fraud whereof he Was vifibly convicted, feeing lo much, fctim of brafs on the one fide^ and fo little Elver on the other. But the Turks are not fo rigorous, as fome perfons imagine^ all was reftor’d to him^ nay there was no pe nalty infle&amp;ed upon him, and they only order’d him to be gone.

The Grand Seignor has many Seraglio’s key WPerfia, m the Provinces of his Empire, and the principal of them are thofe of Bterfa^ and Adrianople^ two Refidences which that Monarch does ordinarily make ufe of, according to the conjundfcurc of his Affairs. But to confine our fclves to Conjiantimple^ we find there three Seraglio’s, which have all their different Beauties. The old Seraglio is the Palace appointed for *h e retirement of thofe Women who have ferv’d the Predecefiors of the Prince Regent, and whence they never get out, unlefs it be in order to Marriage. The Grand Seignor goes thither but very feldome, and that when he is out of humor, t0 pafe away fome days there in folitude. - The Seraglio of the Hippodrome, fd called from the Exercifes done there on Horfe-back, which was built by Ibrahim Son “in-Law, and Favourite to the Emperour Solyman the Second, ferves now iQ r an Amphitheatre for publick Feftivals, Exercifes, Combats,^ Caroufels, and particularly for the Circumcifion of the Ottoman Princes, which .is their greateff olemmty. The third is the Grand Seraglio, whereof I make the Relation^ sfia to which that Name is principally attributed,' fo as that there needs not anvMi Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio' any thing elfe to be added thereto, to diftinguifh it fromthe others TiThT but little to fay concerning the Strudhircs of it, wherein there is nor l- vc extraordinary to be oblerv’d, but (hall rather infill upon what is private^ a ln § in each Apartment of that great Palace. ^ The admirable . The Grand Seraglio is a vaft place inclos’d, which reaches to th-r • ftuation Of the Land where the ancient Byzantium was built, upon the Bd, Mom of ^ Beauty and Wealth of Corfammfle. This great City, let the Wind lit w), • will, does every hour receive feme refrefhments or other, from oneef tfitiT “ and the Seraglio advancing it felf into the Channel, which makes a comm,? 5 non between them, receives the firft Advantages that may be derived thenm'”' It! extent, fi- That great Indofure makes a Triangle, one fide whereof is to the iJa rj g.ure,and enter- and reaches to the City, and the two others lye open to the SeaanH , i&gt; - 1 Which falls into it. This Triangle is unequal/and if it be diSed into parrs, that fide towards the Land takes up three of them, and the five odT are for the two fides abutting on the Sea. Its compafs is about three iti Miles, or one of our common Leagues. And this Palace is furroundeda!! with high and firong Walls, flank’d on the Sea-fide with fquare Towers a?! confiderable diftance one from another j and towards the City, with round Tow ers, which are at a nearer diflance one from another, from the great Gate nf the Seraglio, which is towards St. Sophia, as far as the Sea where you Embark for' Caiata. In thofe Towers, in the Night-time, there are Guards of the Azanwlm to fee that no body approaches the Seraglio by Sea or Land ; and if occafion re’ quire, thev may fire fome Pieces of Artillery, which hand always loadenupona Quay of five fathom breadth, which is carried quire about the Seraglio. Upon one of thofe Towers, about a hundred paces from the great Gate of the Seraglio, as you go down, in order to your paflage oyer to Galdta tfiev have Wrought a Cloiet into which the Grand Seignor goes fometimes to divert himfeif, and to lee People palling to and fro, without being feen him- icir. Somewhat lower, and upon the Sea-fide, there is a fpacious place cover’d o^ef, under whidiy as if it were in a little Haven, they keep the Qicks or pngantines, wherein the Prince takes his divertifement by Water, when he is pleas’d to do it. , ^ thence. Within the inclofure of the Seraglio, are the Habitations of thcBoftarms, Who are’ entfufted with the condtia of the Brigantines; and at a little farther diflance, in your way to the point of the Seraglio, which is towards Scudaret, flands the Quarter of the Boftanchhbachi, Overfeer of the Gardens of the Seraglio, and of all the other Gardens belonging to the Grand Seignor.

Oppofite thereto^ still'd. and in the middle of the Channel^ there is a Tower built upon a Rock, which the furky call Sfutflcr houleji, or the TWr of the Virgins. It is kept by Bpflangif, and has its Guns levell’d with the Water, which better defend the Streight, than thole at the point of the Seraglio, which for the moft part are without Carriages, and unferviceable. Befides, they want good Gunners, and if all that Artillery were well mounted, and manag’d by skilful Perfbns, it would better keep if* awe, whatever comes out of the Mediterranian, and the Blacky Sea.

I have feenas much of the Seraglio, as a Stranger could do, and I havefeen it feveral times, in levcml Voyages, having had time enough to confider the two firft Courts, the Divan, and the Hall of Audience, but cannot celebrate them much for any great Beauty I could find in them. There is, I muft confefs, abundance of Marble and Porphyry in all the Apartments*, but on the other fide, all thofe Apart ments are confufedlyfhuffied together 5 there is no regularity at all 5 moft of tn Rooms have but little light, and all the Ornament of them eoafifts^ipivmrs Seraglio.

There is feldom any c l afP ° / • , e in that Houfe, for as foon as one is gone out, another comes in: and thoueh iX dehgn d only for luch as are fick, yet feveral perfons, who are well are brn t thither, under pretence of indifpolition, or to enjoy themlelves a while or to wcpH ' out feme trouble or difeontent. They continue there for the fpace of ten or mJ* daies, and are diverted, according to their mode, with a wretched kind of vocal 3 injtrumental Mufick, which begins betimes in the morning, and holds on till 11,2 1 he permilhon they have there to drink wine which they never have elfwherft a greater inducement for their coming in thither than the mufick. But that nw million, which, they would as twere conceale, and which the liiperlfition of thr -Jw/y dares not publickly own, is accompany’d by a thoufand difficulties. They not permitted to bring in any wine in the light of the Emucb,who Bands at the entrant of the place: and if any one Ihould be fnrpriz’d in the doing of it, his puniflunoit would be to receive three hundred baffinadoes, and a penalty of three hundred mJ to be paid to thofe from whom he had.receiv’d them. But if hecan cunninelvsetm with the Wine not having been Bopp’d at the Gate, affoon as he is got in he runs no nlque at all, and may drink of it without fear of any chaflifement, though ’were in the prefence of the Grand Seignor. . 6 fma)I f q uan n'y of Wine which can be got in by this Way, would fignife but L fhe Mr. lltl: l e a W fo “ an y Pc ,°P J G if there were not feme other lels difficult contrivances wary. fo w l PPv tnem therewith. And this is one of them. The Infirmary adjoins to one fide of the Gardens, from which it is feparated only by a wall which is not very high ; fo that the Boftangis, who find that wine goes off at a good rate, and that tney who are within the Seraglio know not how to fpend their money do m the night time, by ropes convey over the wall, fo many Borrachocs or Bags ct JpucK-okins, full of wine, containing forty or fifty quarts, which fome other per- ions of the Infirmary (land ready to receive. This way brings in abundance of wme but not without fear of being fuppriz’d by the Boftan&amp;bachL who goes the rounds every night. ^ 3 o fome perfons 'to r ^ or j s t ^ e drinking of Wine the rttain inducement which makes thofe counterfeit be receiv'd in, f lc .

A deteftable paffion, and which is in a manner na- titiall £0 them, though it be againff nature, makes them fhidy all the imaginable waies to iatisnc it. i his proves a hard matter for the Icboglans to do, while they are in their Chambers obferv 5 d and watch’d night and day by fevere Overfeers, who never pardon them the leaff mifdemeanour. F01 though the Grand Seignor be himfelf fubjedf to the fame paffion, the very name whereof caufes a horror* yet he orders cruel punifhments to be infliried on th ofe who fhall prefume to imitate him. He does what hecan to prevent the milchief, winch he would not have countenanc’d by his example, and impofes the preventi on or it as a task upon the Eunuchs^ a vigilant fort of animals,' whofe Eyes are al- Way cs open. But in the Infirmary, all thefe precautions prove fruidefs* the Eunuchs belonging to that place being corrupted partly by prefents, partly by treats, or being made drunk with wine, or. fome other liquors, they bring in thither fbme young lads, of whom there is great ffore in the City of Conpnmopk. The better to over-ieach the Emucb's y they put thofe young lads into the habits of the Hdvafu, anc io the cheat fuccceds, in regard they are the Attendants on the Officers of oeragho, and all the Errands they have to do in the City-# ^ The fubtilty ofA Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. g j Of rbefe Halvages, there is ordinarily to the number of fix hundred, and they have only their cloathiiig and fuftenance allow’d them, without ariy wages, till jfuch time as they have ferv’d thirteen or fourteen years. Their wages begin at the hte of two Afpers per diem and in time may rife to feven Afiers and a half: but they have other contingent Profits, and they know well enough, how to make their advantage of the Employments they are upon. For whereas they only are the Perfons who have the freedom of going and comeing in and out of the Seraglw^ they fet double the price on everything they buy. Blit their moft confiderable gain proceeds from the infamous commerce of thole young Lads whom they bring in to their Mahers, and whom they cunningly flip into the Infirmary, after they-had put them into Habits like their own. They wear a white Cap, which riles up from the Crown of the Head, to a pretty height fomewhat to the refemblance of a Sugar-loaf. ' - The Haflekr-Jgafij or chief Ovcrfeer of Infirmary, is inded continually at the Tnefmtlcf 7 ^ Gate with five or fix other Eunuchs, and carefully obferves whatever goes in, or deavowsusA comes out. But all that vigilance will not do the work; nay though he had 'a* 0 ch ^kd ts hundred eyes, yet Were it impoffible for him to difeern thofe young Lads, amidft cm * e ' die great number of thofe Halvagis and that the rather, for thefe reafons, thatthey are frequently chang’d, thatTome of them are made Janizaries^ and that new ones are taken in upon the advancement of the old ones to fome other, Employments. But if it fhould happen that the faid Superintendent Eunuchsfhould have any fecret information of what’s defign’d, and deems as if he would make fome noife about it, he is prefently appeas’d with a filk Veft, or fomc other Prefent, and ’tis thence that he derives his greateft advantages. In fine 5 that brutifh Paflion is fo ordinary; Abominable e&amp; among ft the Rurks and generally over all the Eaftern parts, that notwithftanding c Ai Ver al1 the all the endeavours that has been us’d to prevent the cffe&amp;s of it, they will hardly a it ever be able to do it. There happeifd a memorable Example of this in my time. Two Pages of the Chamber, who could not have the convenience of executing Tho SacnlegU their wicked defign in the Seraglio, would needs aggravate their crime, by going 0HS a ^ on °f into the Mofquey to fatiate their brutality. After Prayers Where ended, they two Fages ° fliffer’d all the people, to go out, and having fo well hid themfelves that he who feut the doors could not perceive them, they fdll to the doing of an aftion. Where of the very Idea caufes horroitr. T. On the left hand of this firft: Court, there is a fpacious Lodgement, anfwerable The mod Tilt to that of the Infirmary; and that’s the habitation of the Azamoglans^ perfons of the Seraglh, defign’d for the mcaneft Employments of the Seraglio. Within that Strdffure there is a fpacious Court, where you fhall find difpos’d in order, all about, and in the middle fo many Wood-piles, which are renew’d every year, and there are brought in thither above forty thoufand Cart-loads of wood, every Cart-load being as much as two Oxen can draw. Some part of thiy wood comes in by the Blacl’^Sedj and the reft out of the Mediterranean i and Whereas there is a great quantity of it left every year, efpecially when the Grand Seignor does not Winter at Conjlanti- • that remainder, which muft be very confiderable, is difpos’d of to the Vantage of the principal perfons among the Azamoglans, They are cunning enough as to take their opportunity, when it is iinloaden upon the Port, and computing, as the charge Well as they can, how much may go to make up the Piles, they pfoportlonably Wereoj. fend^ what they think may be {par’d, to the City, and lodge it in the houfes, Where they are acquainted. Whiclu they may do with fb much the more fecurity, in regard that no body minds what they do, and that they perform their duty, when the Piles are compleated in the feafon during which they are wont to rnake theif Provifions. The wood they thus convert to their own ufe they are paid for, and the fum rais’d thereby is confidcrable for Perfons of fo mean a Quality.

When you think them fo far boyl’d theii pour out both Meat and Breath into a Bafin, and the Pot being wafli’d, put it on the Fire again with Butter in it, which they fuffer to melt, till fuch time as it is very hot. Then they chop the meat which had been but half-boy I’d, into little pieces, the Pullets into quarters, and the Pidgeons into halves, and fo they caff it into the Butter, they fricafs it till it be of a very brown colour. T he Rice being Well Walk’d they put fome into the Pot over the meat, as much as they think fitting, and the Broath. which had been pour’d into the Balin, they alio put it into the Pot Ladle-ful after Ladle-fuL, over the Rice, till fuch time as it hands two fingers breadth above it. Then is the Pot immediately cover’d, there is a clear Fire made under it, and they ever and anon take out fome grains of the Rice, to fee if it be foftned, as alfo whe ther it be not requisite to put in fome more of the Broath to compleac the hewing of it. For it is not like the Rice brought into our parts, which pre- fently breaks afunder, but their Rice is of fuch a kind, that it muh be fully i boyl’d and yet the Grain entire, as well as the whole Pepper wherewith they feafon it. As foon as it is come to that condition, they coyer the Pot with a Cloth three or four times doubled, and fet the Pot-lid upon that,-and fbmetime after they make another melting of Butter, till it be very red * to be call: into the holes, which are made in the Rice with the handle of the Ladle, after which they cover it again of a hidden, and fo let it hand foaking a while, and then ferve it up. It is put into large Difhes with the Meat, handfomly difpos’d upon it, and fome part will be white, that is, continu’d in its natural colour, fome part yellow, occafion’d by a little mixture of Saffron, and a third part of a Carnation-colour* done by the tincture of the juyee of Pomegranate. Nay, though the meat be as fat as is require for the ordering of this Difh, yet to make the Film more delicate and palateable to them, they beftow three pound of Butter on fix .pound of Rice, which makes it fo extraordinary fat, that it difgufts, and is naufeoiis to thofe who are not accuftom’d thereto, and accor- dmgly would rather have the Rice it felf fimply boyl’d with Water and Sait. There are always two or three Difhes ferv’d up after that manner, to the Grandees of the Port, who for the moft part, keep open Table, and inftead of . FLlh they cover them with a great Aumelet or Omelet, made with good Herbs, and about three fingers thick, or with fome poach’d Eggs, which are neatly difpos’d about it. A man is never incommodated by this kind of Rice, but the ,other 5 which is too fat, is not fit for thofe who drink Wine, and will not excite in them a defire to Eat of it often. , Since I have given you an account how they order the Pito, I cannot for- A particular hear making you a further difeovery of the furls management of the Kitchin, of roafting and telling you how they roaft their mc?at.

The Floor of it is cover’d with a great Carpet, and there are fome Benches for the Officers, of whom that Council con fids, which the tmks call Bivan. There are, as I told you. Galleries of all the fides of that Court, which makes it look as it were like a Cloifter; and ’tis under that Gallery which is . on the right hand; that the Janizaries have their Station, while the Divan is fitting. Thed 8 A Relation of the Grand Ser.aglTo/' . „ ...

There is no talk of delays, or putting off one time to another; People fcall not languilh in Expedation, but the is decided immediately, what nature foever it may be of. ' nes the Reafon of Though this Cuftom be very commendable, yet can it not be fo Well mfV vi that Expediti- amongfi Chriftians^ becaufe they hand upon the property of what thev hnL IS j 'n Of juftue. thx is dcriv . d by inheritance from feme to others, and the litigious panMonl them do many times engage the Proprietors thereof in long Suits of Law ’T 0 quite btherwife amonglt the Great Officers of the Port, who are all Slaves eitl- taken in War, or lent up, as Prefents, by the Balia’s, and Governours of Province? All their Efiates, when they die, return to the Grand Seignor, from whom thev had receive’d them, fo that it is a perpetual Circulation, and their Children as I told you in the begining of this difeourfe, are brought up to the Seraglio^ to be educated v v there, and that without any hope of ever fucceeding their Parents, either in their Efiates, or Employments. The Ottoman Monarchy has always obfery’d thisfubtle Policy, not to permit that any Family fiiould aggrandize it felfi and be powerful from Father to Son: but they bring it down, as foon as they have rais’d it up and timely enough deprive them of the means whereby they might create Fa&amp;ions to the difturbance of the State. Thence it comes, that, befides the Royal Family of the Ottomans , they know not what Gentility, and antiquity of Extradiion means; there’s W emulation upon that fcore, Charges and Dignities are bellow’d anfwerabl to the Merit of the Perfon, without any confideration of his Extradfion. Nay,it fometimes happens, that the Principal Miniflcrs of the Empire are the Sons of Cow-keepers as was one Rufian, a Grand Vizir, who made fo much noife under the Reign of Solyman. And fo, being not any way oblig’d to their Birth,they acknowledge their Fortunes to be the reward of their Education. But to return to theadminiflration of Juffice amongfi: the Tw^/.Thofe who make the Taw their profeffion, and are look’d upon as the Clergy of Mahomet ^ leave no place for fuits at Law; every one knows his priviledges, and what, belongs to the fundion of his Charge, and there arife no differences among them, becaufe all things are perfedlly well regulated. ' In like manner, the people are ignorant what pleading fignifies. There’s no occafiop for publick Notaries, in order to Matrimonial Contradls; There’s no great fums given with a daughter, and the jewels and cloaths which fhe can get out of her Fathers houfe, are all the portion fhe brings to her Husband. And this, in few words, is^ the reafon that the turky can put an expeditious end to all their affairs, without giving any toleration to that pettifogging, which, among Chriflians, proves the mine of fo many People. The Officers, who fit in the T)it&gt;an are, fir ft, the Grand Vizi r, the Lieutenant- General of the whole Empire, who is Prefident of it, and reprefents the Grand Seignor’s Perion; Then the fix ether Vizirs ; Then the Cadikfquers of Romania ard Natalia^ who are the Judges and Intendants of the Armies; Then the three tfterdars t or Treafurers-General; Then the Niffangibacba^ the Lord Chancellour; -And the Netang'u who is as ’twere the Secretary of State, with feme Clerks, or Notaries. All thefe Officers come into the Divan-Hall, at four in the Morning, and continue there till No m, to adminifter Juftice. The Chiaoux-bacbi has his ftation at the Gate, with a troop of thofe that are under his charge, to execute the Grand Vizirs Orders, and has a filver-rod in his hand, as a badge of his Authority. ihe care taken C)n thofe days that the Divan fits, the Officers are en ten rain’d at dimer in the to prevent rfe fame Hall, which is done with much Sobriety, and little Ceremony.

That Eunuch prelently carries it to ( the Grand Seignor; And if they have a peek again!! a Vizir or a Cadikfquer^ or fome- fimes again ft their Aga , or Colonel, it often happens that to appeafe thofe mutineers, the Grand Seignor orders theni to be ft tangled, and fends them their heads. ' . ^ Sunday and Tuefday ate the principal days of the Vivan, and then it is properly a //w the Gr(tr g Council of State, and of publick affairs. The Grand Seignor moft commonly seignor is pre~ affifts at it, but is not feen ; and that keeps in awe as well the Grand Vizir, as die feat at the Di- other Officers. He can come thither from his own Appartment, through a clofe van ’ Gallery, and feat himfelf at a window, which looks into the DiW-Hall, and has always a velvet Curtain before it, which he draws when he pleafes, and efpecially When he perceives that they have not done Juftice. I ftiall produce here, an example, famous enough as to that particular, Which happen’d in the Reign of Sultan Achmet, / the Father of Amumb and one of the jufteft Princes, that ever the Ottoman Empire had. The Reader is to call to mind, what I faid at the beginning concerning the ‘fimar- „ Spahf on whom they beffow, during their lives, the Government and revenue ofJf e a 5 xil ^f fome Town, according as they have deferv’d by their Services. The Saplri, whole spahi,w&gt;/w ftory I am going to relate, had a c timar, between Aleppo and Vamas, which might a Grand Vifir y bring him in a revenue of fifteen hundred Crowns. T he Grand Vizir, either out of andis Moon'd. fome aveffion to the Spain, or upon fome falfe reports which had been made of him* and which he had been too forward to believe, without taking an exadl informati on of things, took away from him the timdr. Whereof he was poflefs’d, and beftow’d it on one of his own Creatures. . v , The Spahi, finding himfelf fo unjtiftly difpoflefs’d comes to Conflanibiopk, enters into the Divan, and prefents a Petition to the Grand Vizir, wherein he remonftrates to him his long Services, and how he never was chargeable with any negligence of his duty. The Grand Vizir having read it, tears it in his prefence, which was to fignifie as much, as that he would not anfwer it, and that there was nothing for for the 'Spain to hope for. The Petitioner withdrew, without fayiqg any thing: but fome days afterwards, he returns to the Vivan, and prefents a fecond Petition, which the Grand Vizir likewife tears, as he had done the former, without mak ing iny arifwef thereto. Upon fhis fecond injury, the Spabi, full of fury, and juff- ly exasperated, draws his Poniard, falls upon the Vizir, and kills him. • The Grand'Sdignor, who was then at the Window, having obferved that a£fion s draws the Curtain, and with a loud Voice commanded that no hurt fhould be offer’d to the perfon who had done it. He thereupon orders the Spain to approach* and ask’d him the Rcafon of his having demean’d himfelf with lo rhuch' violence. The othef much afliam’d, humbly makes anfwer, but with refolufcioii enough, That he could not forbear dfeing what he had done, upon the fight of fp great a piece of injuftice : and thereupon prefenting to him the Petition, which had been torn to pieces, the Grand Scignbr caus’d it to be read, and patiently hearkend to the juft complaints which it contain’d. Having fully examin’d the Affair, his High- nefs commended the Spain for the Action he had done, ufing the word Afemi, which is as much as to fay, ’Tb ibeil done, and which is ordinary in that Language, when, they approve a thing; and thereupon, there was an additional Liberality made by the Grand Seignof to the Command which he £ave, that he fhould be re-eftablifhed In his Timar. He thereupon took occafion to fpeak to the other Vizirs, and to tell them, That that Example fhduld teach them to do juft, things^ and not to fuffer themfelves to be fo blinded by favour, as not to obferve Equity. The v Violent action of the Spain is certainly not to be*approv’d, though the injuftice of the Vizir was manifeft, but the procedure of the Grand Seignor , cannot be look’d On btherwife then as rfisoft conimendable, and a great Model of perfect Lenity. •’ - , ‘ ' '■ ;; ’ ^ .

The other immediately approaches him, and intreats his Highnefs With all lubmillion to accept of it. The Grand Seignor takes it, and making feme difeoveries how acceptable that Prefent was to him, does by that prudent diffimulation, caule a joy in him, whole Chaftife- menc he was then contriving. . But that Angle indicium the Grand Seignor does not think enough, but he will have other difeoveries 3 and knowing that among other things that were in the Bag, there was a Ring, the Work oi an Excellent and Ancient Matter, famous 101 chat iott 01 Rings which the Juries wear oirthe Thumb, when they ihooc With the Lotig bowe, he expefts a fecond cccafion, in order to a fuller dilbvery or the Cheat, and the more abfolute conviflion of dip iDocfor. Twasnot many days ere that happen'd, by the contrivance of the Empcrotr himlelf, who calling for one of his Pages, one well skill’dmi Archery, went to the place of the Gmt, Where he alfb call’d for a Bowe, there bein« not any Per- ion in the whole Empire but was inferiour to him, as to ftrength and dexterity in the hxeiciles of the Bowe and the Dart. When he came to bend the Bowe he complain d that: the Ring hurt his Thumb, prefuming that the Doctor, who Itood near him, and had already prefented him with the Coral-Beads, would alio make him a protter of the Ring, which he had of the Pilgrims. Is it poffible lays the Grand Seignor, that there is not at this time any Matter living, who can make a Ring anything like fuch a one, whom he nam’d? The Dodor whole apprehenhon was not fo good, as to fee that tbis Trap was laid for his ddtruenom and thinking to infinuate himfelf more and more into the Grand W iit VO i IU&gt; co ^ by good Fortune he had a Ring of tliat very Matters Work, which fie had kept a long time, and that if his .Highneis would bC Zr t0 ^ Cce P t0 ^ he would bring it thither, which he prelCntly did. , Anon as the Grand Seignor was return’d to his own Quarter, he fent for the brand Vizier, and the Pilgrim, who came into his prefence, and he had in his hand the Chaplet of Corral, which he made as if he were repeating, to try whe-* tner the Pilgrim would know' it again. The other having well obferv’d it, aciarels’d himfelf to the Emperour, faying^ If it fliall pleafe your Highnefs to permit me to open my mouth, I dare affirm, that the Chaplet, you iiave in your hands, is very like that which I have in my little Bag of Jewelsy and pouible 1 mall not be miftaken, if I fay it is the very fame. Whereupon the Gund Seignor commands him to come nearer, and putting the Chaplet, and toe Ring into his hands, the Pilgrim affirms, upon his Life, that they are the very fame things, which he had left in the cuttody of the Dodfon He coming the next Mornings according to his cuftom to make a Report of feme Crimi nal Gaufc to the Grand Seignor, that Prince, who was a perfon of great Inge nuity and Apprchcnfion, propofes to him a Cafe fomewhat of the iame nature vVl ^ !l . between him and the Pilgrim, and ask’d him what Punifliment fuch deferv’d.

The Pilgrim was call’d, who prefently WmP i is - an d his Jewels; and the Doittor by an open Confeflion, acknow- Edgd his Crime, and Perhdioufnefs. ; , T|/ ^ day,’’the Emperour order’d the Bivan to be Affembled, at which he ' r that all the Grandees’ about Cenjlantinopk fhould be prefent, to render th tvi— C nt more : folemn.. - Hd hr ft commanded, that whatever belong’d me 1 &amp;oiild be rettor’d to him/ togbthe.f with lome £dditibhal recom-; • pence’At What time, fufpefts, pence : and his next command was, That the Doctor fhould be punilfrd ac 1 ding to his own Sentence. To that end, otxier was gh/en, that a Stone HiouldT : made hollow, after the form of a Mortar, into which he was thrown ftark nak x and pounded alive by the common Executioners. And that is the fame Mortar which I have often feen near the Gate of the Divan, and is left rh^ for a Memorial of fo admirable and fo folemn a Judgment. And this was T period of a Hiifory, whereof all* the circumftarices are remarkable, and wh'h is not oiie of the leaft Monuments of the Wifdcm of the Emperour That Prince, inflead of ufing his abfolute power at the hrft overture of fuch ^ Affair, thought it fitter, by a perfpicacity of mind and prudence, patiently r expect remote occafions, that he might thence deduce evident proofs of ° conceal'd Crime : and his intention was to raife the Do&amp;or to great dignities jf he had found him innocent; and to punifh him feverely^ as he did, umn ’rhp dilcovery. of his guilt. _ f y I told you at the beginning of this Chapter^ that of the four days of the Wceb hm, the Grand appointed for the fitting of the Divan, thole which are anfwerable to our Sun- Seigwr rids Jay anc f Tuefday, are the principal, as being thofe on which the Mairs of tHfwhomte S reate E importance are debated. They call thofe two days Arzgbmz, in regard m ;c that after the Grand Vifir, the fix other Vifirs, and the two Cadikfqtters who affifl: at the Divan, have admin iff red Juffite, they go all together to kils the Grand Seignor’s hands. If any one of thofe Nine Judges have ought to fay to him, he is permitted on thofe days, to ipeak to him freely: and it is ordi narily upon thofe days alfo, that the Grand Seignor takes his time, if he has a mind to take off any one. He then ordets the Boflangi-Bacbi to be ready, with fomeof thofe who attend him, to execute his will; and having declar'd to him Who they arc, whom he would have firangled, the order is no fooner given but that either at their arrival, or at their departure, it is pun&amp;ually obey’d! True it is, that he does not demean himfelf fo, but when he is afraid of feme popular fedition, in cafe he fhould fend to punifh them in their own Houfes, Where they, might make fome refinance. But within the Seraglio, and in fight of the Janizaries, who are in their (lations near the Divan, the unfortunate Perfon, whom they would have to be firangled, has no mote to do than to bow down his Head, ahd to ffretch out his Neck, without thinking of any refinance, which would be to no purpofe. In the Eleventh Chapter I fhall give an Account at large, how they proceed fo that Execution. m -A little beyond the Hall of the Divan, you come to another Hall, rais’d up tvhkh^Ambaf - a Eer the manner of a Balcony, where the AmbafTadors arefeated, when they fadors come to affifl at the Divan, and that they do, once in three months, and upon the the Divan. days that the Janizaries receive their Pay. Thete is Notice font them to be there, out of a vain off ehtation, that they may fee, what abundance of money goes out of the Treafury. Between thefe two Halls there is a Gate, which leads to the Quarter of the Baltagit. Thofe are a fott of flrong and rebuff People, employ’d, as I told you, in carrying of Wood all about the Seraglio, and other mean and painful Offices. As to the wood, which is burnt in the Appartments of the Women, they disbiirthen themfelves of it at the Door, where the Negro-Eunuchs take it tip, and carry it into the Baths and other Rooms, into which they only are permitted to go.

The Grand Seignor dlflinguilks the Quality of thofe' Princes and States, and the effeem he has for them, by the number of Veils which he orders to be bellow’d on their AmbalTadors when they come to Audience. The Ambaffador of France has four and twenty allowed him; the Ambaflador of England, fixteen; the AmbafTador or Agent of Venice receives twelve, and the Dutch Ambaffador as many. When Monfieur de Marcheville Was Ambaflador in turkey, from his moll Chriffian Majelly of France, I had the honour to be one of thofe who accompanycd him to the Seraglio, where after Dinner with the Vizirs, in the Divan-YidW, while dais Retinue were treated under the Gallery, the Veils were brought According to the cullome. ^ The Ambaffador coming to diflribute them to thofe whom he had a mind to favour, and take along with him to the Audience, he was much furprjzed, to find that he had got but fixteen. He imme diately fent word to the Grand Vizir, that he wanted eight Veils, and that he would not go to his Audience, till he had the, full number, which they had wont to prelcnt to the Ambaffadors of France. There was fome conteft about it, which retarded the Audience pear an hours time; but at lall Mounfieur de Mdrcheville perfifling In his tefolution, the Grand Vizir complyed, and fent him eight other Remarks ontl timber ofVeft. which the Grand Seigm orders to be g ven the Am* bajfadors of Cbriftian Princes .

T H E Baths delign’d for the Grand SeignoTs own Perfon, and his principal Officers, take up a great fpace of the Quarter of the Eunuchs. The little Ovens, whereby they are heated, called Kulkpns, are adjoyning to the Appartment of the Serai-houdafi^ and fifteen Ichogtans, the molt robuft that can be found, are imploy’d in keeping the Fire going. They have the deno mination oi Kulkangis 5 and five and twenty others, who are named Delians, are Employ’d in the Baths, to fhave and rub the Body, as alfo in applying Cupping- Gaffes to thole who fiand in need thereof.

Some fpend the time in learning,' make up Turbants, wherein there is more work and difficulty than is imasm'? efpecially in making up the Grand Seignior’s own Turbant, when he goes toX’ 'Divan. For then he takes an extraordinary large one, as do alfo all the Officers of the fame Divan when they go to Council: and I cannot make a better rem/ fentation of that kind of Turbant, then by the form of our largeft fort of Citrals' if they be made hollow in the middle, fo as that the head might enter into that hole. ■ . 1 . Others are employ’d in ffeaving,paring the nails, and other things of that kind. They do not make ufe of any Scizars for the nails, in 7ar% nor in any rartof Jfia ; it being a thing forbidden by Mahomet in his Law, and accordingly they account the doing of it a great, fin. But they make ufe of a little Steel InftrumeDt fomewhat like a Pen-knife, and the only cutting part is the end of it and they arc dextrous enough in the performance of that Office. It is the Cuftomall over the Eaft, that the Barber who trims you, fhould alfo makeup your Tur bant, which is many times difeompos’d, pair the Nails of your Hands and Toes, and fake away the filth out of your Ears; for the furks and all the Inhabitants of 4/w, arc great lovers of cleanlinefs, and cannot endure the leaf! naftinefs, either on themielves, or thofe who come near them, as I fhall give you an account anon. colours forbid- And having fpoken fo much of the Turbanr, it will pot be nnfeafonablefor den the chrifti- ^o communicate this Remark to you here, That in the Ottoman Empire, ms in their and all over Arabia^ none but Mabumetans are permitted to make ufe of White coiffure. for the covering of their Heads; whereas in Perjpz, and all over the Great Mogul's Empire, men may take what Colours they pleafe themfelves. The defeription I come nowto the great Bath, which is adjoyning to the Chamber of the t&gt;j the Baths, mangi-bachi, who is the chief Overfeer of it, and which makes part of the Appart’ menl: £r^ ^ ^ e f er ^'&gt; or Grand Seignor’s Laundry-men. The place where they put off their Cloaths, is a fpacions Louver or Banquetting-Houfe of Free-fione, high enough, and in one of the moll eminent parts of the Seraglio. The Floor is paved with a very delightful kind of Marble laid infquare pieces; and it has two large Windows jutting out upon the Gardens, fomewhat like Balconies, from which you have a Profped: of the two Seas. In the midft of that Dome or Lowr y yon find a Fountain, the Water whereof is received into two Bafins or Cifterns: The former, which is the highefi, and withal the leaf!, is of one piece of White . Marble, having in it a little intermixture of Red and Black Veins, and pierced through at fix feveraf places, for the reception of fo many fmall Pipes of Copper through which the Water falls down into the other Bafin, which is alfo of Marble, of fevreal Pieces, and feveral Colours. Abufes re- i Within the^ Domo&gt; there is a great number of Poles, which are form'd about it, and fupported by certain pieces of Iron coming out of the Wall. Upon thofe Poles they dry the Linnen which they had ufed in the Bath ; and of that Linnen there are feveral forts. Heretofore, the Pages were allowed only a long Piece of Linnen fcCloth, which came only twice about their wakes: but upon obiervatioti made, that they abufed them, and that handfbme young Lads playing together, {hatched that piece of Linnen one from the other, purpofely to difeoverA Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. 41 their nakcdnefs, they u(e in the Baths only inch Garments of JLinncn as are ibwed clofe above ^ and reach from the wafte down to the Feet, much after the manner pf a Womans ^etthcoat. At their coming out of the Bath, they have two other forts of Linncn to dry themfelves withal, of the largcnefs of ordinary Table-Cloths, whereof the one is Red, with a border of Silk of three fingers breadth, which covers them, as loon as they are out of the water, from tfie wafte downwards to the ham; and the other is White, wherewith they rub themfelves. For thefe two forts of Towel^ they have but one Name, to wit, Fecbefamal. # _ ^ . 4 , , .• j -; T , ' . ■ ; , On one fide of the Fountain, which : is in the mid ft of the Domd,! there is , an entrance into the Bath, arid near that is the Hall where they lincloadi them- vant:!nes fclvcsin the Winter-time. A little Gallery which lies on the left hand, jeads'^.^^^ to the places defigiVd for the eafing of nature, and every feat has a little Cock, ccm } ' which fupplies them with water to walh themfelves, after they have done. It is accounted an heinous Sin among them, to make ufe of Paper for that purpofc ; and the rcafon they give for it is this, That, poffibly, the Name of God might be written upon it, or might contain fome Text of the Law, which would be a profanation pi it, and confequently ought to be avoided. Befides, they have another opinion, That Paper is not fo proper fo well to make clean that part, which the neceility of the Body does ordinarily fo much defile, but that there may 1 be fomething of ordure left; and that being obliged to prefent themfelves before God with an abfoiute Purity of Body and Mind, tKeir Prayers could not be heard, if they lliould not be wholly clean. The V.erfms are yet more fcrupulous than the Turfy upon this account. For 7^ Pcrfians though they both agree in this. That their Devotions are incftcdual, nay m-moreferufuim deed that they are not in a condition to perform them without crime, it they the be not pure, as to Body and Mind; Yet the former are of a pcrlWalion, That Turk ’ s * the kali ordure which, through Negligence • or Inadvertency, might remain, upon their Perfons or their Garments, would render their Prayers fmidefs and criminal, which the Turfy ^ fomewhat lefs fuperftitious as to that particular, will not acknowledge. , : J- ■ i , Certain it is alfo, That in Per ft a they are extraordinary Lovers of Cleanliness ; They are great ^ inlomuch that I have oblerved, That at If ah an ^ the Metropolis of that Country, °f dcan i where the Streets are not paved, when there falls a little Snow or Rain, which lne s ° muh occafion fome dirt, few People will come out of their Houles, unlefs they be forced thereto by fome Concern of great importance. And when they do go abroad at fuch a time, at the Houfe-door into which they are to enter, they put off their Shooes, their tipper-garment, the Cap which covers their Turbants 5 and if they have the leaft dirt or filch about them, they think themielves im pure, and that it would be a difrefpcdl: to the Peffon whom they are to Vifir. Nay, a Perfian Dial 1 be very (cfiipuious, and make a great difficulty to receive a Man into his Houfe in Foul Weather; and if any one prdents himfelf into that pleafure, he makes a fign to him with his hand to keep at a certain diftance from him, in the place wherein he is to enter into Dilcourfe with Kim. For if by chance as he comes out of the Street, where there is fome dirt, and where Horfes pafs to and fro, and may caff: fome of it upon him, he has the leaft {pot of any daggling about him, and afterwards touch the Perfon, whom he conies to Vifit, this latter would be that is to fay, Unclean, and thereupon be obliged immediately to change his deaths; fo great is the Super- ftition qf the Perfians^ as to that particular. , At the end of the Gallery, there is a door which gives you paffage into three chambers very Chambers, which are fo many Baths for the ufe of the Grand Sei'gnor’s Quarter. f v , er *j ve There is adjoyning to the laft of thofe Chambers a fpacions place pav'd Chequer- We With Marble of different colours^ and there the.

This ' place has a little eminency in the midft of it, from which there is a gentle delcenc pf all elides, that the Water wherewith the Barbars waffi their Heads and Beards Jpay the more cafily be carried off,* and the place be always kept clean. On both jides of the Wall, whereby it is enclos’d, there is a great double Cock, with two • Leys belonging to it, which, at the fame mouth, fupplye's them alternately with Either hot water, dr cold, and that falls into a Bafin or Receptacle of White ■' ‘ J ' ■ - - ' ‘ '* Marble.:— % ™ ’ W 42 A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio^ Marble, wherein three or four men may bathe themfelves withouTa venience, or trouble one to the other. There is alfo at one of the enl m ? n ' Room of Black and White Marble, and there the Barbers who h ^ knowledge of any other Profeffion, put np all their neceflaryUtenfils and i'll n ° ments, as Razors, Hones, Balls, and thofe Irons wherewith they Nails: for as for Linhen, they donotufeany; and thofe who are to be ft u come in hark naked from the Wafte upwards, and are cover’d from ' downwards, only with a Cloath, which reaches to the Ancle. Tis a Rarity to meet with any one among thofe Barbers that knowes how tfT blood* and their Lancets, are much like the Fleams, wherewith our FarnVroKi j Horfes. . ; ^ , \; ^ ersDJeed Oppofite to the Chamber of the Barbers, there are three other Rooms arch*^ With Marble, the larged whereof much furpafles in Beauty thofe that a adjoyning to it. The Floor of it is of white and black Marble, and the Walk are done about with fquare pieces, that are white and blew, and in every one of them you find a Flower in embofs’d Work, done to the Life, and which a man would take for enamell. Little Lamines or Plates of Gold cover the jun&amp;ures of thofe fquare pieces, and there cannot any thing be imagin’d more pleafantand’ divert!ve than that Chamber is. In the Roof of it, there afe feveral round holes of about half a foot diameter, over which there are little Glafles made in the fafhion of Bells, order’d as the Venice-Looking-Glafles are, left any one lliould have the curiofity, to get up to the Roof, and laying himfelf upon his belly think to lee what is done in the Bath. The place has no light but what it receives by the means of thofe holes, and while fome body is in the Bath: But especially when they go out of it, the door is (hut, the better to keep in the heat, and to prevent their being feen - which might be if inftead of thofe forementioned holes in the Roof, there were WindoWs below , according to our Mode. All the other Baths Lave their Structures after the lame manner, and having no light but what comes at little glaz’d boles, there is npt any paflage into it but that ol the door, to the end that being prefently flint, the heat might the better be kept within the Bath, and to prevent their being feen who ate m it. ' • A The Second Chamber is another Bath, but as to Beauty, it is.much inferiour to the others And as for the third, there is forbething in it which is Angularly re markable. The Floor of it is lay’d as With a fort of fmall ftones, fo as that the foot cannot Hip, though it be wetted at their departure out of the Bath : And the whole Room is done all about with fquare pieces,having in them flowers of embofs’d work, done to the Life and covered with Gold and Azure. This is the place into which the Grand Seignor enters. When he comes out of the Bath $ and he always goes into it alone, when he intends to fhave himfelf in thofe parts, which are not to be nam’d without immodefty. ' . , Mahomet pronounces a Cur fe upon thofe perfons who fuffer themielves to be feen, and upon all thole who look on them: And the ftri£f obfervance, of his Law re quires, That both Men and Women ought to fhave themfelves, without tiling the afliftance of any other hand. , An Earth that But moft of the Inhabitants of the EASTERN Parts, the Arabians $ iartars, takes off hair, and the Indians ^ make life of a more eafle expedient then the Razor, to get off hair. It is a certain Earth, which they mix with fome Ofpiment, or Arlenick, and which becomes foft as butter. When they are in the Bath, and begin to fweat, they take of that Earth and therewith rub the parts, from which they would have the hair to fall, and prefently after they muft be very carefullto fee, whether it begins to fall, as one would obferve a Fowl, whofe feathers he would take off, after it had been call into lealding water. For if that Earth be left too long upon the parts whereto it had been apply’d, it burns and maxes holes in the flclh, the marks whereof Will remain, fomewhat’ refembling thole, Which the Small Pox fometitnes leaves behind it.

M thefe Arms are either hungup at the Ceding, or fatten'd asiS the Wall; but in a pitiful condition, all over-run with ruft, and cover’d w’th dull; and the Grand Seignor fuffers them to be fo negle&amp;ed, becaufe there come in daily Prefents of Arms excellently wrought, the novelty whereof makes him forget the old ones; as alfo for that it is the humour of the furL not to make any great account of Curiofities, but at the very time they are prefented with them. u The Second Chamber is a very fpacicus Arched Stru&amp;ure, of the fame height and Archite&amp;ure as that of the Bath, of which I gave you an account in the pre cedent Chapter, where they go and uncloath themfelves in the Summer time*: And there is no difference between them, fave only that this laft has no over tures in the Roof. That place contains Six great Chefls, or Coffers, each of them of Twelve Foot in length, Six in breadth, and Six in depth; and if the Covers were not broken to pieces, two men would find it a hard matter to lift them, they are fo weighty. Thefe Coffers, which are called Ambm are full of all forts of Cloaths for the Grand Seignor’s ufe, as Vefls, rich’furs Magnificent Turbants, and Cufhions embroider’d with Pearls. , Befides the Six Coffers before mentioned, there are Eight others, which are but Eight Foot in length, and four in breadth ; and thefe are fill’d with Pieces of Scarlet, Engltjb and Dutch Cloaths, of the finef! forts. Pieces of Velvet, Gold and Silver Brokadoes, Embroider’d Coverlets and Counterpanes for Beds, and other rich Commodities of that Nature. As for the Bridles and Saddles cover’d with precious Stones, they are difpos’d upon fupporters of Wood or Iron, Coming out of the Wall ‘ and all this Chamber is generally very well kept, and all things are neat, and in good order. • - The Third Chamber is very fpacious, and is more like a great Hall. The firft thing that entertains your Eye, is a great Coffer, the infide whereof is di vided into three parts, and makes as it were Three other Coffers, one upon the other : but they are open’d all on the out-fide, fo as that if there be any thing look’d for in the undermoft, there is no neceflity of flirting the uppermoft. The lowermoft Coffer contains thofe fumptuous Coverings for the Grand Seignor’s Throne, of which I have fpoken in the Defcription of the Hall of Audience. In the middlemoft are difpos’d the Houffes and Trappings, enrich’d with Embroi dery, and fome of them with Pearls and precious Stones, which are ufed in great Solemnities. In the uppermoft Coffer, are kept the Bridles, Breaff Pieces, Crup pers, and Stirrups, which are recommendablc upon the fcore of the Diamonds, Rubies Emeralds, and other Precious Stones, whereby they are enrich’d : but the greatefl part of them is cover’d with iWr^-Stones, which they have the art of fettingex- cellently well.

They take of that Wood according to the Oylinefs of it, and confequently its making a greater fumigation’ the quantity of a Pea, or a fmall Bean, and alter they have moifWd it a little they put it over a few Coals in a Chafing-difli, in a kind of Perfuming-Pot. which they prefent one after another, to all the Company. There comes out •a thick Steam or Exhalation, wherewith everyone Perfumes his Head and his Beard, and fometimes the in-fide of his Turbant, after which he lifts up his hands on high,^ crying Elmendda^ that is to fay, Lbankj be to God. But before they prefent tnem with the Perfuming-pot, there is fome Role-water brought in a Veffel of Gold, or Silver, according to the Quality of thole who make the Vifit. This Vef- lel is commonly a foot in height, the lower part of it being about the b'gnefs of a mans fift, and from thence growing gradually fmaller and fmaller to the top of it, which is about the bignefs of ones little finger. Ac the top of it there is a little hole, out of which comes thellofe~water, wherewith they wafh their hands and faces; and then hold them over the fuffiimigacion of the Lignum Aloes ^ which not only dries up die water, but alfo Picks, fo much theclofer to the hair of the Head and Beard. .

When this Coffer is open’d, you lee a kind of Gold-Smiths Jewel Box, wherein are ranked'all forts oE Jewels of higheft value 3 as Diamonds , Rubies , Emeralds , a huge number of excellent ‘Topazes, and four of thoic Gems call’d Cats-eyes, which are lb beat tiful, that they are not to be valu’d. Having fatisfy’d your curiofity with the former, you come next to certain little Drawers full of feveral Jewels, great Rofes of Diamonds, Pendants, other Kofes of Rubies and Emeralds, Strings and Chains of Pearls and Bracelets. There hands afide by it felf a Cabinet, where are the Sorgou^ or the thing wherein are faftn’d the Heron-tops, which the Grand Seignor wears in his' Turbant. They are as it Were little handles, made in the fafhion of Tulips, cover’d over with the mofl precious Stones of the Seraglio, and 3 tis into tin’s that the Heron-top enters, that rich Plume of Feathers, whereof I have elfewhere given the defeription. Of thefe Handles, feme are higher and more precious than others ; and my Overfeer of the Treafury affur’d me, x , That, of all forts of them, great and fmall, there are above a hundred andflty. The Idler ones ferve only for the Campagne, and the great ones, which are the richeft are referv’d for the Pomps and Magnificence of the Court, and when the Grand Seignor marches in Ceremony to Contlantmple. If he has a defire ro fatisfie his light with the lullure of his precious Jewels, he Orders the Coffer to be brought into his own Chamber; but if he call for feme particular Piece of the Treafury, he gives order to the Chafnader-bacbi, to fetch it, and that Chief Officer of the Treafury cannot enter into it, without abundance of mytaous precautions. Trcautions , „ 1 here are alwayes Sixty Pages, more or lefs, belonging to the Chambers of the ‘ and ceremonies Treafury. The number of them is riot Ext, but the Credit of the Capi-Ag^ and obferv’d at the the Cbafnader-Bacbi, may augment 'or diminifh it, according to their inclinations and opening o J the j ntcrc ft s .

The Chief Officer of theTrealury having receiv’d Orders from the Grand Seignor to bring the Piece he would nave, affcmblcs all the Pages in their Chamber, and fends for the Andkdar-Ag^h has the Cuftody of the Keyes. This la ft having given three ftroaks with hjs nan upon the Drawer, wherein they are enclos’d, takes them out of it, and following the Chafoadar-Bachi, attended by the Sixty Pages, they all make their appearan together at the door of the Treafury, ^ Treafury., ''■. . : V V.' i— A Relation of the Grand Seigmrs Seraglio. , The firii: thing that is done is the untwifting oi a Chain, which they had put there for the better fecuring of the Seal, which the Chief Officer of the TreafurV had fet over the hole, and having found it entire, he orders it to be broken by the keeper of the Keyes, and commands him^ - open. AfToori as they are got into the Chamber into which the Chafoadar-bachi ^ ,oWs they are to go, he lets himfelf * down upon a low Bench, and declares what Piece it is that the Grand Seigncr re quires. They thereupon open the Coffer, wherein it ought to be, then they pre lent it to the Chafnadar-bacbi, and, if he be defirous of that honour, he has the priviledge to be himfelf the Bearer of i: to the Grand Seignor. Then has he a fair Opportunity to fecure fomething that is precious to himfelf, if he has the dexterity to do it without any difeovery. When he is in the Treafury, he needs only fay, That the Grand Seignor defires alfo the Piece, which he has a mind to convert to his own ufe, and caufing all to be immediately carried to his own Chamber, he there leaves what he would keep, and prefents to the Prince only that which he had commanded to be brought him. Not but that whatever is receiv’d into the Treafury and whatever goes out of it, is cxa&amp;ly fet down and enroll’d by the Hsznaomub, or Clerk, who keeps the Regifters; and the Cheat might be eaffly dif- tpver’d, when at the quitting of his Charge the Cbafnadar-bacln gives an account of all things to his fucceffor. But it ordinarily happens, that they are friends, and that the Cbaj'nadar-bacb^ who does notadeave his Charge, but upon his advancement to that of the place of the Capi-Aga, in cafe he fhould dye, or be exalted to a higher Dignity , or upon his being made a Bajfa and Governour of a Province, propofes him, among the Pages, for whom he has the greateft affedfion, and who is his Confident, as a Perfon qualify’d for the Charge of principal Officers of the Treafury. Accordingly being his Benefactor, he gives in his Accompts as he pleafes himfelf, and delivering unto him an Inventory of what is in the Treafury, he withal pro duces a MwWzfrw of the Pieces, which had been taken but thenfce, during his Sur- intendency, by the Grand Seignor’s Orders. The Clark of the Treafury, might, notwithflanding their intelligence and combination, difeover the intrigue 5 but being one of the eideft Pages of the Chamber, and in a capacity of advancement to the Charge of Chafnadar-bacbi^ he flints his eyes, and lb avoids the creation of Enemies, thinking it more prudence, to be appeas’d, by the Prefents he receives as well from him who enters into the Charge, as from him who quits it. But thefe Thieveries are not very often committed, and if there Were but the le ( aft difeovery 1 made threof, a fevere punifliment would fbon be inflidfcd both on the Author and his Complices. As to the little Cheff or Coffer, wherein the moff precious Jewels are kept, it is impoffible to get any thing out thence : for when the Grand Seignor would have any Piece taken out of it, he orders the Coffer it felf to be brought into his Pre- fence, by the principal Officer of the Treafury, accompany’d by the Keeper of the , Keyes, and all the Pages 5 and before he opens it, he takes notice whether the Seal entire. After he has taken what he defir’d, the Coffer is lock’d up in his Pre- fence the Seal is fet upon it, and it is carry’d back into the Treafury with the fame Ceremony. Then do the Sixty Pages receive, ordinarily fome demoffrations of the Grand Seignor’s Liberality, which may amount to ten or twelve Parfer, to be divided amongft them. f We are not yet got out of the third Chamber of the Treafury, which may pkfs RkhTapifiry, for one Spacious Hall, the middle part whereof is taken up bw a Scaffold, of nine^ ra « or ten foot fquare, the height^ the length, and the bfcadthmeing equal.

Empire, doing him homage. At the bottom of the laid Piece of Tapeftry, there may be read certain Yerfes in ' ^ , M/c.kchara&amp;ers : And the upper part of the Scaffold is full of Books in the Latin } French, Italian, high German, 'Englijh, and other European Languages.

He was the Son of a Cow-keeper and } Jv lowed the fame Employment himielf: but he had a Genius that might h ^ a Pcrfon of the higheft Extraftion, and which raifed him to the Charge of Vifr, and the Honour of being Son-in-lawto Solyman, He had many travel f Fortune and was for fome time out of Favour : but in fine, who l°! great Affairs to manage, and was engaged in a War with Verfa coming to a iS! indigency of Money, fent for Rufian, and beffowed on him theSuperintenden v his Revenues. He knew him to be a Man of great Abilities, and capable of p Jh them, m a fhort time, into a good pofture ; and accordingly his pains and dil gence in the management thereof proved lb fuccefsfuL that he prefenrlv fifiJ Solymoris Coffers, and re-efiablifh’d the Affairs of the Empire. ^ d Upon which oceafion I fhall here fet dojyn a thing which is {fill frclh in the remembrance of many Turks ^ who receiv’d it from their Fathers. The turh have fo great a zeal for the welfare of the State, that one of the Grandees of the Port, an Enemy of Ruftans, and one, who, upon other occafions, Would gladlv have ruin’d him, proteffed to one of his Confidents, That, though it were in his power to do him an ill turn, yet he would not do it then, bccaufe he had by his Induffrey and Labours, upheld the State, which he retriv’d from the Precipice of defiruftion, and Was in a fair Way to make a coqfiderable augmentation of its Revenues. This generous and heriock Sentiment in the Soul of a Tm^ wheat his firft rife Was but a Emple Slave, would meet with but few Examples araondt Cbriflians. b But, to reafftime onr difeourfe concerning the Fourth Chamber of theTreafury. It is full of Cheffs _ of two foot in length, and a breadth and depth proportionable thereto, fortify’d with plates of Iron, and made faff, each of ’em, with two Chains. The number of them is not always the fame, becaufe the Money is coming in, and going out oUhat Chamber, and the Coffers are tranfported thence according tathe occurrent exigencies,. for the payment of the Janizaries^ and the maintenance of the Armies. All the Gold and Silver which is brought into the Treafury rifes out of the Revenues of the Empire, and out of the Sale of what Goods the Baffas leave at their d parture out of this World. As to what is rais’d out of the Empire, which dilates f° *! lto t ^ ie ^ iree parts of our great Continent, and comprehends lb mar ' Kingdoms, it may be eafily imagin’d, that it muff fupply the Treaftiry with nii Sums; but it is not eafie lb to afeertain them. Its revenues confift principally in the collection of the 1 ributes, and in the Cuffoms : and the three Tefierdars, or Treafu- rers-General, give^ an account to the Grand Vizir of the Receipts of the Provinces. Thar Principal Minifter has the cuffody of one Key of that fourth Chamber of the Treafury, and the firft Tefterdar has that of another, and befides that, it is always ieal’d with the Grand Seignors Seal. It is ordinarily open’d, but upon thofe days, qn Which the Divan fits, that is, on Council-days, either for the reception of Money into it, or for the taking of any out, to defray the Charges of the Empire. , What is fo receiv’d into it is for the moft part in Silver 5 and as to the Species of Gold Coins that are brought into that Chamber, they come from four Sources, two hereof are upon a Foreign account, and the other two upon that of the Couni trey. One of the two former confifts in the Commerce of the French, Englifhj VffK Italians, Mofcovites, and Polanders, who bring in Ducats out of thofe Provinces* The other is the annual Tribute, which the Cham of the Leffer Tartary, the Princes ol Tranfylvania, Moldavia, and iValacbid, the Republick of Ragtifa, and part of Mingtdis and Ruffia, are to pay die Grand Seignor in Gold, which amounts to very g reaC Sums.

True it Is, That the long continuance of that Warre made a great hole in the Revenues of the Empire 5, but there are Two great Rea Ions, which divert- me from giving abfolute credit, to fuch as affirm. That thofe Exigencies reach’d the Secret Trealury, For, in fhort, it is as kwere a fundamental Law among them, That, before any thing is taking out thence, it isrequifite, the Empire fhould be in imminent danger of mine; And it is manifeft, That though the Turks could not reduce Cank under their Jurifdidtion , yet their Empire was jo far from being near its decadence, that it hill continu’d powerful. Befides, it is to be obferv’d, That When the Grand Seignor lobes a Battel, it is a difadvantage to his provinces, upon the fcore of their being thereby depopulated, and To much the lefs cultivated j but that it is an advantage to his Coffers,^ in regard there’s fo much the lefs comes out of them. The reafon of it is evident, becaufe he pays the Veteranes, or Souldiers of long handing, feven or .eight Afpers a day, and that thofe ol the new-rais’d Forces do not hand him in above one and a half, or two at tke moh; their pay augmenting with the time, anfwerably to their fervices, and the Prince’s good Pleafure. Whereto it is to be added, That when an Em* perour dies, his Succehor augments the pay of the Janizaries, by an After, of two, per diem* v ' * ■ ^ : ' 1 It muh be acknowledg’d indeed, That there died a great number d 1 'urly In the Warr of Candia: but it is certain alfo, That jf we confide! the great number of Kingdoms and Provinces, whereof the Empire yonfihs, among which there are fbme very fertile, and very well peopled, it.is an eane matter to raife numerous Armies,, and to recruit them, when they, have been weakned, ' by a Defeat, or by fome Sickhefs, which often fiappens among them. Upon thde two grounds, I cannot be induced to believe, that Ibrahim was oblig’d to make any diminution of the Secret Treafury : but I am very apt to believe, that he made not any great additions thereto, becaufe he had not either the good Concilia, or good Fortune' of Amurat, and ordinarily, the one avails not much without me ‘' other. , ... . . , ' ' i ’ - . ; All the Gold that lies interr’d under that Vault is in.

For example’ the of Czm?,affoon as ever he is nominated to that Government, knows, that two Millions of Livers, that is reduc’d to the Englijh account, two hundred thoufand pounds flerlwg , will hardly make good the Prefents, which are expetfed from him at the Port, that is, thofe due to the Grand Seignor himfelf, and to toe principal Sttltanejfes^ as alfo to the Mufti^ the Grand Vizir^ the Cdimacan^ and other ierlons of Credit in the Court to whom he is ingag’d for his advancement to that Charge, and of whom he may hand in need for the future.

If the Sofas can but quietly enjoy their Governments, for one year, nay tor fix Months* the Jews make a good hand of it, and recover the Slums’ they had advanc’d. But, one theother fide, they run a great hazard in regard that it happens, many times, the Grand Seignor lends for the head of a BaJJa, before he has had time enough to fettle himlelf in his neW Government* and then, - they who have lent him Money are not to hope ever to recover any part of it,’ . From what has been fakb it may eafily be concluded* That the greateff pare of the Money of the whole Ottoman Empire is in the Grand Seignor’s hands, and among the Jews * I mean the Jews of Conjlantinople. For as to thole who live in the Provinces, the world goes but ill with diem, and they are in a much more x wretched condition* than the Cbnjtians ; in fegard they do not follow any thin^ of Husbandry: and their inclinations being altogether bent for Traffick, and the management of the publick 1 axes or the Cufloms, his impoifible there fhould be employment'lor them all. , The Grand Seignor therefore receives very confiderable Summs from the The Balias, and other perfons, on whom he beffows Charges, even before they have mr y b'V f taken pofleilion of them. But, that amounts to little or nothing in comparifon of the Ea&lt;i i ’ - the advantages which he makes, upon their removal out of them, and cfpecially When they have had a fair time to gather Treaiures, by their inlupportable ex- affions from the people. Some of thefe Baffa’s have come to that exceffive - Wealth and Power, that their Revenues were equal to thofe of many great Princes. Such was the fortune of one Machmut fieglkrbeg of Europejindci: the Reign o{Mahomet the Second ; and that, of the Grand Vizir VafJ'uf^ under Achmet the Firff. At the death of the latter, there were extraordinary Riches found in his Houfe, in Silver^ Gold, and Jewels, and all was brought to the Seraglio, along with his head. It may eafily be conje6ftir’d, by the number of the greater and leffer Govern ments, whereof the Empire confilfs, that there is a confiderable mortality amongli thofe, who derive their Charges and Fortunes from the pure Munificence of the Grand Seignor, and whofe acquifitions thereupon falling to him, muff of neceffity make vafi addkonals to the Seraglio. But befides thofe Who are gently convey’d out of this World, by a natural death, there hardly pafies a year but, violent death comes and *a6fs its part, and upon the leafi: jealoufie, or any fantaftick appreheefion the Grand Seignor may have, a Bafla receives a p remptory Order to (Fetch out his Neck, and he is immediately firangled. In the next Chapter, I (hall give the Reader an Account, of the formality and ceremony, which is obierv’d upon that occafion, where he will find fomewhat worth his remarking* and I think I may confidently affirm, That they who know it is the^cuftome, to ftrangle tfiofe, whole Lives the Grand Seignor would take away, know not all the Particulars obiervable in that Aciion. ^ .

Let us take things in order, one after another, and fhew in the firfl place, how he manages his lubrle ddign, while the Bajfas arc living, in getting out of tberp wherewithal! to make ample gratifications, without any diminution of his Revenues. Afnongit the Political maximes of the Ottoman Monarcbs, this_ is one of the theft remarkable. They would have the Baffd's to be refpe&amp;ed in their .feveral Governments, by the People, as much as if they were there themfelyes in Per- fon .* and to makea greater,and a more lively impreffion of that veneration in their minds, they think it fitting, to honour them, from time to time, with fome frelent^ which is carried to diem with much Cetemonv. This Prefent, which a certain demonflration of the Efteem, which the Prince has for the Pci ion m whom he fends it, is commonly fome Rich Garment 5 and when he is willing to rnjbe it compleatj he adds the Sabre, and the Ponyard, garnifh’d and adorn’d With precious hones. The Grand Seignor, upon the cpnfideration before-mention ed, finding himfelf as if were oblig’d to make a Prefent to that Baffa^ knowes Well enough, that he Will be fare, on the other fide, to fend him one which fhallbe Worth ten times as much, and to make another ro his Envoy, which he riiufl lock on as a recompence of his Services. .&lt;6 A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. ' ' But it is not always the Grand Seignor’s defign, by fuch Prdents, to honour the Balia, aud keep the People the more in iubjeaiou to tun. It happens many times that when he intends to rume him, he makes him a Prci'em, that he nni thence take occafion, in cafe he does not receive another from him, fuchashe defires, to fend another Meffenger for his Head. The Pretent, upon that occa^ fion is not a Veft, or a Garment, but, a Sword, or a Battle-Axe, which are very Ominous Prefents, 'and Advertifements to the Baffa, that the Grand Seignor has little kindnels for him. To divert the Storm, which he fees likely to fall upon him, he doubles the Prefent he fhould have made, in cafe he had lent him but a Veft,' which is a pledge of his Affedfion. And if that Baffa be one of thole, who Commands in the greater Governments, the Prefent which he fends to the Grand . Seignor, ought not to amount to lefs than Two hundred Purles, that is to fay, a Hundred thoufand Crowns, not comprehending what is particularly given to the perfon who is fent by the Bmperour. r ^ n The Ceremonies The Pcrfons charg'd with this Commifhon are, for the molt part, fuch as the Attending the Grand Seignor is willing to be Munificent to. So that, all things confider’d, the Frefentsfentby p re { ent { s not fo muc h defign d for him who receives it, as for him who fends it, SelnoTfa and the Perfon who carries it: And in this confifts the artifice of exercifmg great thJfe reborn he Liberalities without disburfmg any thing. The Ceremony perform’d at the de- 'muld honour. )iyery of this Prefent of the Grand Seignor, is this; He who carries it being come to the place where the Balia lives, to whom it is fent, and having advertis’d him of it, this latter, with the noife of Drums, Trumpets, and Hawboys, aflembles the People together, fomeof whom motint themfelves on Horfe-back, to do him the greater honour. The Bafla himielf, marches in the Head of all, and they who are not mounted follow afoot, together with the Curtezans, or common Strum* pets of the place, who are obliged to allift at this Ceremony, dancing after a Tabour, and putting themfelves into a thoufand lafeivious poftures, according to the Cuftome of the Countrey. r ’ The Meflenger who brings the Prefent makes a halt, in expedtation of this Cavalcade, in fbme Garden near the City, or in the Fields under a Tent, which he had got fet up for that purpofe. After mutual Salutations, he caffs theVdl over the Bafla’s fhoulders, putting the Sabre by his Side, and thrufjs the Ponyard into his Safchebefore his Bread, telling him, That the Emperour their Mafter, honours him with that Prefent, upon the good report which had been made to him, that he has demean’d himfelf well, that he does not tyrannize over his People, and that there is no Complaint made, of his being defective in the Ad- miniftration of juftiee. , ,n i t m This Complement pad, the Bafla, in the fame order, and arriidlf the Joyful. Acclamations of the People, takes his way, and the Grand Seignor’s Envoy along with him, towards his Houfe, where he entertains him at a great Treat, and, after all is done, with a Pretent, which amounts to Ten thoufand Crowns at the lead. For, as I told you before, if the Prefent be carried to one of the baffa s who are in the greater Governments, as the Baffa’s of huda^ Cairo, or fobylm, they fhall not efcape under Thirty or Forty thoufand Crowns, and the l relent which is fent to the Sultan, ought to amount to a hundred thoufand. Nay it many times happens, that the Grand Seignor appoints what he would nave their Prefent to his Envoy t© amount to, and that efpecially, when he fends fuch as he has a particular kindnefs for, and would amply gratifie. the particular The Emperour Mahomet the Fourth, who now fits on the Throne, has a par- ZlliX dollar inclination to exercife Liberality, and to bedow Rewards on taole w o tofhew himfeiffcwt him $ but he does it fo, as that it cods him nothing, and confequently, the liberal, vrithour is no cccafion of taking ought out of the Treafury.

But his work is yet not half over; there muff be much more done for him, through whole hands he has receiv’d .the Prefentj and he (capes very well, when, not accounting what he lends to the Grand Seignor^ the carriage of itcoffshim but Ten thoufand Crowns. Nay many times, he is* forc’d to double the Sum, when he has not been fo liberal, as the Prince expected he fhould have been* for he prefendy difpatches away an Officer, to reproach him with the (lender account he has made of his Prefent, and the fmaii recompence he had receiv’d , whom he had employ’d to bring it him* To thefe reproaches he fends him an exprefs Order, to make an additional Reward of Twenty or thirty Purfes, which is immediately put in execution; and as to the Prefent which the Grand Seingor has receiv’d, he commonly makes a diflribudon of it, amongft thole, who are then about him. And thefe are the Advantages which the Grand Seignor ferews out of the dap’f) and other Grandees of the Port, whilft they are alive. Let us now con- fider thofe which accrew to him by their death, in order to the recompenfing of thofe, whom he favours, without being oblig’d to cake any thing out of his Coders. When the death of a Bajfa is refolv’d upon, the Grand Seignor delivers the Commiffion to him, whom he has defign’d to be kind to j and he finds it much more advantagous, to bring him the Sentence of his death, than to bring him a Prelent from the Prince. . If the Execution is to be done in Conflantinople the ordinary Executioner js the FormdinesoU Boftangi hachiy who is alwaies about the Grand Seignor’s Perfon, and he himfelf fpv'dat the does the Work. But if there be a neceffity of going into fome remote Province, ’cis commonly either a Capjgi-bachi, or one of the principal Boftangti, whom die ^ firangled Prince has a mind to fhew his kindnefs to, who is fent to perform the Execution, by the Prince* He who carries the Order, accompany’^ by five or fix Capigti^ fometimes man- Orders^ ages his Affairs fo, as to arrive at the place, while the Council is fitting. But if that cannot be fo'orderd, he goes to the Baffa^ and commands him in the Grand SeigHor’s name, to call one immediately. That Council confifls of the Baffa , s Lieu tenant, the Mufti^ the CWi, the chief Commander of the Janizaries belonging to that place, and lome other perfons concern’d in the adminiffration of Juffice, who are of the moft confiderabie of the Province. The Council being affembled, the Capigi-hachi enters, attended by his people, and prefents the Bajfa with the Grand Seignor’s Letter. He recives it with great re- fpeft, and having put it three feveral times to his forehead, he opens it, reads it and finds that the Prince demands his head. He makes no other anfwer to that Order, then What he does in thefe few words; Let the WtU^ fays he of my Empmur he done: onely give me leave to fay my Prayers which is gratlted him. His Prayers being ended, the Capigis feize him by the Arms and the chief of them prefently takes off his Girdle orSafche, and caft it about his Neck* That Girdle confifts of feveral fmall firings of Silk, with knots at both ends, which two of the company immediately catch hold of, one drawing one way, and the other, t’other-way they difpatch him in an inftant. • * .• E they are unwilling to make ufe of their Girdle they take a handkerchief, and With the Ring which they ufe, in the bending of their Bowes, and which they or dinarily wear on the right-hand Thumb, they thruft the hand between the hand kerchief, which is ty’d very clofe, and the Throat, andfo break the very Throat- B°ne.

I hey therefore think it prudence, to connive at what ever is done by that En&lt; voy, as being otherwife perfwaded, that he will not be difown’d by the Grand oeignor, who is not ignorant of what’s done upon thofe occafions. Nay on the contrary, and whatever he may have dextroufly fecured to himfelfof the Bajfds Goods, they make him fome additional Prefents of their own, at his own de parture from them, engaging him thereby, to fpeak well of them to the Grand oeignor, and to the.Grant 5 Vizir, at his return to the Port.

' 6 i From icveral Parts of the World, there come Caravans to Mecba, and when the Devotion is to begin, the High Pi:elf, aififled by all the people belonging to the Cere ™ oniei ob ~ Law, {pends night and day* in faying of Prayers, and performing the neceflary Ceremonies. On the Seventh day, all the Pilgrims are allembled together before ° m ' the Sheets Terit, who appears at the entrance of it, and Handing upon a low Stool, that he may be feen by thefe who are at the gfeatefl dlffance from him, Prayes, and gives his Bendiaion to all the people, putting a period to the Devo’ tion, with theie words, c Ibdt God would enable them to return in Pcace^ as they came thither. From that minute, every one riniff bethink himfelf, that he is to be at his own charge; the Shec^ gives no more, and ’tis then that he begins to make great advantage, to&gt;himfelf. For Whatever is fold for the Suftenance of the Pilgrims, comes from him; and befides, he holds a cotrelpondence With the Maffers of the Caravans, of whom the Pilgrims ate ford’d to biiy conveniences for their ridc- ing back again, at more then three times the rate they are worth, when the Beads they had brought out of their own Countries have fail’d them by the way. The Caravan of Cairo is the moft numerous, and the mod conddcrable of all The caravd file Caravans, that come to Mecba. The Caravan-bacbi y who is the Captain and 0 / Cairo - Conduffor of it, makes his gains by it, at his return, worth him Two hundred thoufand Crowns; and there is a great competition about his place, which is at the d'fpofal of the Baffa oi Cairo y and commonly carried by the highed bidder for it. The Captain of this Caravan is alfo Mader of the Waters, which are carried &gt; into the Ciderns, and it is according to his Orders that they are didributed 5 and whereas that didribution is equal, as well in Relation to the Poor, as to the Rich, if the latter would have any beyond the quantity allow’d them, they mud pay dearly for it; and the Captain, who fets what impofition he pleafes upon it, makes a conn lerable advantage thereby. But let us return to the Grand Seignor’s Prefent. The Tent, and the Carpet, ^ Pre f ent which he fends, are two Pieces equally precious, as well for the excellency of die ^ Stuffe, as the additional embellifhments hereof. The Carpet is dedgn’d for the Mogul ^ ^ covering of Mahomet's Tomb; and the Tent, which is ereded hard by the Mod 7 quey, is for the Sbech^ who does not dirr out qf it, during the Seventeen dayes of Devotion. This high Pried of the Mahumetan Law, has found out the Secret knack, of extra&amp;ing inexprellible Summs of Money, out of that Carpet and Tent*. which are renew’d every year: and when the new Prefent is arriv’d from the Grand Seignor, he fends, as ’twere out of a fingular favour, &lt; certain pieces of the Curtain of the old Tent, to feveral Mahumetan Princes, of whom he receives Magnificent Prefents in requital. This Curtain, which is fee up on the out-fide of the Tent, quite round it, to hinder the people from feeing thofe that are under it, tonfids of feveral pieces, fix foot high, and of a great length: and the Shec^ endeavours to perfwade thofe Princes, That if they faden one of thofe pieces to their Teuts* when they are going to engage in a War, againft thofe whom they account Infidels, good fortune will be fure to attend them, and it will not be long e’re they gain the Viffory. But if he fends either the whole Curtain, or the Tent, or Carpet entire, it mud be to a great Monarch indeed, fuch as the great Cham of Tartar}^ or the Great Mogul: and that he does, once in ten, or twelve years; one while to the one, and another, to the other. G)f this we have a l ite indance, in Aureng-zeb y who at the prefent is King of the r^ e /5 and whom we otherwife call the Great Mogul. For upon his edablifhmenc m his I krone, the Sbec\ fent him the whole Courtain belonging to the Tent; and joy there Was at his Court, that the King had receiv’d fo Magnificent a Pre- ictit, from the Hdy Placet as they call it. The Sheck^ was foon after made fenfible of the Royal Liberality of that Great Monarch, one of the Riched and mod jowerful of the Univerfe; and thus does that Spiritual Head of the Mabumetati Religion^ who has a kind of Supefintendency over all the Members, know how :? rna ke his advantage of them, and has found Out the way, to enrich bimfelf, at + nc c °dof all the Princes and Nations, who fubmit themfdves t6 the Mahwnetan B t ; jM .].■ : f!

I queftion nor, but that they who have writ of the Religion of the Tmly, have given feme account of the Pilgrimage of Mecba, which is one of the moft efletuial parts thereof; and therefore, as well for that reafon, as alfe for chat I fhould digrefs too much from my fubjed, I ought not to profecute that matter any farther. I dial] take occafion here, to make three Rcmaks, which I have originally learnt of one of the moft learned in the Rubricks of the Mahometan Law. Thehrft is, that the Turkey by an ancient Tradition, believe, That Mecha is the place where God commanded Abraham to build him an houfe ; atfe that while he was there, all Nations came thronging to vifit him : and that it is alio the fame place where Mahomet receiv’d the Alcoran, from Heaven. The fecond relates to the Commhndement impos’d upon all the Mahttmtansy to be, once in their lives, concern’d in the Pilgrimage of Mecha. For it is to be obferv’d, That the obligation does not extend to the poorer fort of people, who have hardly wherewithal to live upon, and would bring great mifery on their Fami lies, by their abfenee, as being not able to leave them what is reqmftte for their U The^hird Remark is concerning the preference of the two Cities of Mechay and Medina. The former is the place of Mahomet's birth, which it was his defign to honour, and make known, by that famous Pilgrimage, whereto he obliges all thofe of his Law. The latter is the place of his Burial, of which there is abun dance of fabulous relations. Mahomet^ in his Alcoran, does only enjoyn their comg to Mechay where there are no other Relicks of that falfe I rophet, then one of his Sandalls: And the Doftors of the Law are alfo of opinion, that there is no obligation of going to Medinay and that without feeing that City, a man fatisfies the Command of Mahomet. I fhall treat at large of the Pilgrimage of Mechay in the laft Chapter of this Relation of my Travels, and of the different Roads by which the Mahometans of Europe^ Afiay and Africa^ are conducted to the Tomb ot their Prophet. :uu; CHAP-0 nors Seraglio. 63 CHAP.

That is look’d on, as one of the richeft pieces of Plate belonging to the Seraglio.

They are ferv’d at Table with th'efe Waters, in great Cups or Poured aim, which hold about two Quarts, and the better to diftinguifh them, they pot into every one of thofe Cups, fome of the fame fruit, from which the Water that is therein had been ex traded, and which they had preferv’d for that purpofe. Every one has lying by him a Wooden fpoon, which holds three or four times as much as any of our ordinary ones, and whereof the handle is of a length proportio nable: for as to Gold and Silver fpoons, it is not their cuffome to ufe any. With thofe fpoons, they can take out what is in the Cups, according to the Water which they mofi fancy, and fo they fufpend thirft, taking ever and anon fomc fpoonfuls of it. It is alfoin the Cup bearers Appartment that the Trwk is made,, which the call tiriak-Fari^ and there is a great quantity of it made, becaufe they ufe it as an Univerfal remedy, and charitably bellow it on all forts of people, as well in City as Country, who are defirous of it. The Vipers which are us’d in this clbmpofition are brought out of Egypt , and they make no account of thofe which efrher Countries afford, or they are cf opinion at leaf!, that thie former are much the better for that purpofe. Before the Appartment of the Kilar^ there is a Gallery whereof the floor is pav’d with iquare pieces of Black and White Marble, and fuftain’d by eight fair Pillars of White Marble^ and at the end of it is a little Quarter, where the principal Cup-bearer has his pefidcnce.

That Gallery is open on the one fide, and on the other you find in the midft of it, the Door leading into the Appartment of the Pages, with three great Windows on the right hand, and as many on the left: And ’tis there that the fix moffelderly Pages of the Treafury have refidence night, and day. From that door, along a walk pav’d with white Marble ftones, very large ones, about fifteen paces in length, and five in btedth, you come t4&gt; another Portal of the lame materia], fuftain’d by two Pillars of black Marble; over the faid Portal, there may be read thefe words, which are ordinarily enough in the mouths of the furkt, and which I have explicated ellewhere; La lllahe Ilia Alia, Muhammed Rejoul Alla. tt gives entrance into a long Hall, where there inay be feen on both fides a kind Seds '‘erntmt of Seat, or Scaffold, a foot and a half in height, and between feven or eight in r&lt;&gt; Turkifll breadth. Every Page has but four foot in breadth for his repofing place, as well by day, as by night; And for their Beds, they are permitted to have under them, only a Woollen Coverlet, four times doubled, which feryes them for a Quilt, and over that they ordinarily have one of Gold or Silver-Brockado, or f*me other fumptuous Silk-ftuff; and inthe Winter time, they are permitted to have three of them. The y are not to have their Coverlets all of Wooll, which would be fo much the warmer, becaufe it would not be a decent fight for the Grand Seignor, When he comes ever and anon, in the night time, pretending indeed as their repofe, having their Waft-coat and Drawers on ; for there is no talk of any ' ojher kind of Linnen, either in 2 k&gt;%, or any part of the Eaft; and whether it be Winter or Summer, they alwaies lay themlclves down to fleep, half clad, with- out any great Ceremony. Over the Beds of the Pages, there is a Gallery which goes quite round the and is iuftain d by Pillars of Wood, painted ail over with red varnilh, and the necefnies there they have their Coffers, therein their Cloaths are kept. Every one has a °f nat ^edifi Coffer to himfelf, but the twelve Senior Pages have each of them two Coffers* ancr f rm one of thofe twelve has the Key of the Gallery in his cuftody. It is ordinarily open’d but one day in the Week* which is anfwerable to our Wednefclay, and then 3 every Page goes, and takes out of his Coffer* what he (lands in need of. If any one of them mud of neceflity look for fome thing there upon any other day, he gets five or fix Pages together, and they all goto the principal Officer of the Trea sury, and he commands the Rafgi, who has the Key of the Gallery in his cufiody, to open it for them, and td have a care that they meddle not with the Coffers of tneir Companions. y . At one of the ends of the Hall, there is a Door, Which condu£ls you to the ountams* where thofe that have their dependence on the Treafury go and aln, when they are call’d to their Devotions.

I have already faid fomething of it, in the Second Chapter of this Relation, and it is a fubjed, which is to be flightely pad over, that fo there may be but impeffed Haas left of it. It is therefore in thofe places, that the Pages make their nodurnal affignations, in order to the committing of the word of all crimes which yet they find it very difficult to put in execution, becaufe they are fb-narrowly watch’d; and if they are taken in the very ad, they are puniflied with fb great feverity, that fometimes they are even drubb’d to death ; of which chaftifement, I have elfewhere given an account. # In like manner, to prevent the committing of that infamous ad, in the places where they take their repofe,there are two Torches lighted, which laft all the Night, and three Eunuchs are ever and anon going their Rounds, by &gt; which means the Pages are depriv’d of the oportu* nicies, which otherwife they might have, to offend. . But we need not go far, to find out the Source of this Evil: the Itridneis or the reftraint they are in, and iheir being depriv’d of the fight of Women, induce thofe Young Men to pradife fuch defilements, and hurry the Turks into a Gulpbj to which they, by an execrable paffion, are, naturally but too much inclinable. The Ichoglans, who are brought very young into the Seraglio, know not what a Woman is, but by the inftind of Nature; and there are fome of them, who, for one day’s fight and enjoyment of a Woman, would be content to dye the next.

Nothing can be imagin’d riiore Glorious, or Magnificent, than the long Train of the Grandees of hft Court, when they return from their Sports. They all march in an excellent order, every one with a Hawke on his Fill, and every Hawke having about the neck, either a Diamond 1 , or fome other precious (lone, of great value, with the hood all embroider’d with Pearles 5 which muff needs make a moff delightful fhovv. The and other inhabitants of the Levant, breed up, in order to their fallow of ^ divertifements, feveral forts of Birds, which the Uurop&lt;ens make no ule of at all, Vogi in run- and they are of a larger fize, and ftronger, than ours. With thofe, inftead mngdown a of Dogs, will they run down a Hare, or a Stagge ; and they have alfo the Veer or Hare, diverfion of hunting the Wild Boar, and other fay age Beafts. But What makes that- Sport the more delightful is this, that jn Pcrjia^ the Countfey is all open and champion, and there are no Woods, into which the Hawke, or other Bird, might get out of their fight- He difeoyers the Beaft at a great diftance, fallens of a fuddain upon it, fo as that it cannot get loofe from him, and flicking clofe to the Head, picks out the Eyes of it, vexes, and torments it, and retards the fwifenefs of its courfe, by which means, the Huntfman come up the fooner to it, and difpatch it. But they do not give the fatal blow, till the Prince has order’d them to do it, or till bebas (hot off an Arrow, or difeharg’d his Fire-lock: upon which fignall, they who are about him are permitted to exercife their .courage aud dexterity. Next adjoyning to the Appartment of the Pages belonging to the Falconry, there is a long Gallery, which is open but of one fide, and in the no°i °j itj, there is a little afeent.

Whenever any^ piece is^ taken our, the Sdigdar-Jga, to whom it is deliver’d, gives the Principal Officer of the Trea fury an acknowledgment, under his hand , of his having receiv’d it; and by that means nothing can be embezill'd, good order being ftridfly obferv’d in all things, relating to the Seraglio.

As there is not fo great a number of them, io have they accoidingly more place to fit, or lye down; and in the midft of the Chamber, you find a little fquare place, rais’d up fomewhat higher than the Beds of the Pages, whence the Haz-Qda- bachi their Governour, may obferve all their abtions, and fee how they, demean themfelves. He has order to give the Grand Seignor notice of it, Kewards being the confcouences of good abtions, as chaflilements are, of bad ones; and it is alio incumbent upon him, to make Ipeedy provifion of all the things they hand in need of. Over the Door of that Chamber, thefe words, La Ilia He Jlla i &amp;e. whereof 1 have often made mention, are engrav’d in large golden Letters; and at the four corners, are the Names of Mahomet s four Companions, Ebou be^ Oman Ofman^ and AH, engrav’d in like manner in black Marble^ When the Grand Seignor has made a Baffa, and that he is to take his leave of his Highnds, to go to his Government, he comes out at that Door, where all thofe names arc engrav’d, and as foon as he is come out, he turns his face again to the Door, and kifles the Threfhold of it, with great humility. ...... As foon as you are come into the Chamber, you find on the right hand ieveral Words of the Law, written, and enchac’d, in guilt fquares, and one of thefe Writings is, of Sultan Achmet's, the Father of Amurath.

Amurath who was not only a pro digious Perfon as to ftrength, and valour, butalfo well skill’d in the ufe of a Wea pon, afforded him ngt the time to confider whom he had to deal withal, but im-, mediately gave him fuch a furious blow with the Sabre, oyer the right Ihoulder/ that he cut his coat of Mail quite to the Middle of his Body, and left him dead upon die place. . ~ * ... v . , r , . _ .. Oppofite to the Haz-Oda, or the Chamber of the forty Pages, there is a Gallery of a confiderable length, and particularly remarkable for its StrutoT. It is open on both Tides, and has, of each, a row of white Marble-Pillars; but it inbuilt after the Serpentine fafhion, and they who walk in it are, every fix paces, out of fight one of the other. There are, under this Gallery four great Preifes, to put up the accoutrements of the four Officers, who are always about the Grand Seignor’s Per- ibn, to wit, the Seligdar-Aga, the Chohadan Aga, th$ Kequabdar-Aga^nd the Hazoda- bachi, of whom I have fpoken at the beginning of this Relation, when I gave a Lift of the Grandees of the Port. . the \dtuation This Gallery, of lo tantaftick and fo extraordinary a Stru£!re, is not far from ef the Mofques that other, Which is a cohtinud afeent, and whereof I made mention in the prece- m Turkey, ^ oppofke to this, laft, there is a Mofquey of the middle Tort, as to the laugehels, the length of it fomewhat exceeding its breadth, afid if ftands. North and South, a fituation the Ttirks obferve in alf their Molqucys,. which are always tUrnd towards Mccba, which place is Meridional to all the provinces of the Empire. There is in the Wall, oppofite to the South, a kind of Neech, which they call Mihrab, into which the W, who is their Prieft, gets up, to Tay Prayers at the ac- cuftomed hours, and the Grand Seignor is prelent thereat, with the forty Pages of the Haz-Oda, in a little Room, the Window wheerof is oppofite to the Neech. On both Tides of the fafd Neech, there is a Gallery fuftain’d by five Pillars, fome whereof are of green Marble, and the reft of Prophyry. And in the Mol- quey, and in the Chamber, or Room, into which the. Grand Seignor comes to do his Devotions, and in the two Galleries, there’s no going but upon rich Carpets- You are not to look for ought of Painting there ; nor have the Walls any other Ornament, then that of. the whitenels of the Marble, whereof they are built. But there arc a great many Writings, in large Arabic}^ Ghara&amp;ers, enchac’d in gilt Borders, hanging up in feveral places, and thofe Writings contain only things taken out of the Law of Mahomet. The Window of the Chamber into which the Grand Seignor comes to do his Devotions, is fix foot in length, and three foot high, and has a Lattice withA Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. 71 &amp; Cuftain behind it, asicvis in feveral Chappds, which our Chriftiau Princes have in their Palaces.

Upon their arrival, die forefaid Mmzim begins to fing thefe two words, ceremonies jStytr, which fignifies, God is Great ^ repeating them four times: and afterwards, f ^ etr Vev0 ~ having added thereto fame words, (peakingas kwere to himielf, the Imm in his nQns ' turn, (ings theie following 5 Flhamdu Mahi Rabbit akmjn^ that is to fay, fhe fjface of God U the Mafier of all things.

They do not light thole Lamps, but only for the Prayers at night, and the fire calling a tdfeffion one thofe Cry da Is, creates a mod delighful Objedt to the fight. The Chamber of the Sarai-Agafi^ one of the four Principal Eunuchs, is adjoyning to that Mofquey, and the lead of all the Chambers, of the Officers, belonging to the Inner-part of the Seraglio. He has but little place more than is requidee for him tp deep in, and he is waited on by two Pages of the Couchoul^Odj) or the little Chamber Adjoyning to the Door of the Haz-OJa^ there is a Hall pav’d with a Checquer-work of black and white Marble, in the midd: whereof there is a Badn of the fame material, but of ieveral Colours, out of which there is an afeent of water four or five foot high. That water is receiv’d into a fecond Bafin, made in the form of a Scallop-Ihell, out of which it falls again into a third, much larger than the two precedent ones. The upper part of the Hall is built Domo-wife, haying therein fome Windows, which give it light, and a certain piece of dull Painting is all the Ornament of its Walls. At your entrance into this Hall, you fee two Doors, one on the right hand, the other on the left. That on the left hand condudfs to a Flower-Garden ? and the other is the door of a Chamber, into -Which the Grand Seignor comes fometimes in the Winter-Seafon. This Chamber is one of the mod fumptuous of any in the Seraglio. It’s Arched ^oghifeent Roof is divided into a great number of little Cells, Triangle-wife, didinguifh’d b ™ ter by two little filets of Gold with a gfeen dreak in the midd, and out of every Angle, there juts fomewhat like the bottom of Lamp, excellently well gilt. Though the Walls are of a curious white Marble, yet is there a delicate piece &amp;f Wainicotage, of about the height of a man’s wade, carried quite round the Room , and the rich Carpets, upon which you walk, deprive yonr fight of the large fquares of Marble, of feveral colours, wherewith the Floor is embelliftfd. Of a great number of Cufhions, which are placed along the Walls, fome are embroider’d with Pearls, and precious Stones, and fee there only for pdentation 5 the others, which are for fervice, are cover’d with Cold, or Silver-Brokadoes, and other codly Stuffs. At one of the corners of the Chamber, there is a little Field-bed, about two foot in heighth, embroidei’d all over, the Counterpane, the Cufhions, and the Quilt; and tpfi Embroidery is all of Pcarles, Rubies, and Emeralds. But when the Grand Seigndr is to come into that Chamber, they take away the Counterpane and Cufhions, which are lefs fit for Service than for Ornament, and they bring in others of quilted or mfeed Velvet, or Satin, upon which the Grand Seignor may more conveniently repofe himfelf. Towards the. feet of the faid Red, there is a kind of Nccch made within Ma !3 or P et ’ s the very Wi]}, in which there is a little Ebony Box, about half a foot fquare,^ff er ^ aud m chat is lock’d up Mahomet's Seal.

And then it is, that the Cbafnadj-hacht opens the Box, apd having in his hands an embroider d Hand-kerchief, he takes out the Seal, with great refpebl: and reverence, whilft tne Seignor cr the Pa^es holds a golden Cup, garnilh’d with Diamonds and blue haphris, on the top of which there is a kind of Perfuming-Pot, out of which there comes an ex halation of all forts of Iweet Scents, whereby the whole Room is in a mane-r embalm’d. The Page holds that in both his hands joyn’d together and lifting it up higher than his Head, all thofe that are prefent ^ immediately proftrate themfelves to the ground, as an acknowledgment of their veneration* As foon as they are up again, the Page brings down the Cup, lower than his chin and the principal Officer of the Trcafury, holding the Seal over the fmoakc, all thole who are in the Room, come and kifs the Chryffial which covers one of the mod precious Relicks, that they have of them Prophet. I have us’d all the endeavours ! could, to get out of my two Officers of the Trea- fury who had often kifs’d that Chryftal, what Obfervations they^ mi^ht have made as to the material whereof the Seal was made and what Letters were engrav’d upon it; but they told me, that by the reafon of the fmoke, and the Chyrlfal, which covers the Seal, not to infid on the Imall time they have to oblerve it, during the ad of killing it, it is not poffible that any one can give a certain judgment of either the Stuff, or the Engraving Upon the fourteenth day oi the Ramazan, thzt is to fay, the Lent of the Turfa. the Grand Seignor comes in perfon into that Chamber, accompany d only by the Seligdar-Aga, and taking oft the Chryftal, which hes ovet the Seal, he delivers it into his hands, ordering him to make the Imprcfiion of it upon fifty little bits of Paper, which are not much bigger than the Seal it fell'. This Impreffion is taken oft with a certain ^ gummy Ink, which is pre par’d in a Pourcelain Dilh, where into he thruds his finger, and lubs the Seal wkh it, and keeps all thofe Printed Papers, for the ule, to which his Highnels defigns them, as we ftiall fee, e’re we come to the end of this f ' Chapter. . c . .

It is a Garment with large ileves of a white Camlet, maoe of Goat’s hair, which the lurks do alfo look upon as a great Relick, l he Grand Seignor having taken it out of the Coder, kifh it with much re- fped, and puts it into the hands of the Capi-Aga^ who is come into the Room by his Order, after they had taken the Imprcffion of the Seal. The Officer fends to the Overfeer of the Treafury, for alarge golden Caul dron, which is brought in thither by fome of the Seignor-Pagcs. It is lo capacious, according to the defeription which they gave me^ c-f it, as to contain the fixth part of a Tun, and the out-fide of it is garnifh’d, in fome places, with Emeralds, and Turquezes. This Veffel is fill’d with water with in fix fingers breadth of the brink, and the Capi-Aga, having put Mahomet's Garment into it, and left it to foak a little while, takes it out again, and wrings it hard, to get out the water ic had imbib’d, which falls into tne Cauldron, taking great care, that there falls not any of it to the ground. That done, with the laid water he fills a great number of Femce-Chyntei Bottles, containing about half a pint, and when he has flopp’d them, he Seals them with the Grand Seignor’s Seal.

It is to be obferv’d alio, That the Cqi-Jga is allow’d to multiply the faid Water, as far as he thinks requifite , and anfwerably to his defire of multi plying the Prelents. All he has to do, is only to'fill up the Cauldron, as it is emptied, arid that aaditfonal water is as good as ’twas before fince it is intermix’d with that wherein Mahomet’s Garment had been foak’d. For there are many perfons, to whome he fends thofe Bottles, Without the im- preffibn of the Seal, upon the little piece of paper, and he has a fnack out of all that is beitowd on the Bearers of thole Prefcnts. But he is not per mitted to make that multiplication of the Water, any longer than for the (pace of three days; that is to fay, till the Seventeenth of the after which nme, the additional intermixture of it would not have the Venue 5 which they imagine it has, 1 3 As fooh as tin's Prefent is receiv’d by thofe to whom it is fent they rake the paper, which has the impreffion of Mahomet’s Seal, and after they have left it to foake a little while in the Water of the little Chryftal bottk they take off the water and the paper, fwallowing down both together With great devotion. But it is to te noted, That no body muft lie Co prefumptious As to open that paper ; for they fwallow it down as it is brought to them After a little foaking in the water, they being hot permitted to lee the im-’ prelhon of the facred Seal: And they who receive only the little bottle Without the paper, lend for one of their who are as ’twere their Pridfs, and get him to Write down thefe words in another piece of paper La he Ilia, Jlla hull, vahidul gebkr, That is to fay There is no other God then God fe pmilher of Crimes.

Chapter, you have the Profpedf of a treble Portal of Porphyry ^ that is, three doors at a fmall difiance one from the rither, whereof that in the middle gives en trance into the Grand Seignor’s Appartment. 1 he two others lead to the Lodgings of the Chokgdar-AgX) and the RiquabJar-Agf^ and thofe lodgings are veiy dark, becaule they are not in a place where light can be brought into them, and that at the fir If building thereof, they could afford each of them but one little &gt; Window. But abating that inconvenience, they are well enough furnifh’d 9 according to the mode of the Country, you tread upon nothing but filken Car pets; there’s no Want of Brokado-Cufhins and emboyder’d ones, and the Walls, . which are all of white Marble, entertain the Eye with pots of Flowers plainly painted, at certain equal diffances, about which there has been an ingenious ap- p i 'ation of Gold and Azure. The Grand Seignor’s Quarter begins with a Hall, which is fpacious enough, and the embellifhments of the infide of it arc correfpon- dent to thole of the outfidc. It is an incruffation of Marble, of feveral colours, and . the Floor of it is cover’d only with the large Woollen Carpers, which are brought out of Verfia, but fuch as are more fumptuous, and much more highly effcem’d,than thofe which are made of Silk. All about the Hall, for the fpace of Five foct, there are fpiead Coverlets of Silk, of a light colour, fome Tufted, fome Embroy- der’d, and upon the Coverlets, there are feveral forts of Rich Cufhions, four foot i-n length, and between two and three in breadth. Amurach’s Of the two Doors, which are within the Hall, one goes to the Appartment Belvedere, of the Vages^ the other to the Quarter of the Suhawffes, and as you go out by this lafi mentioned, you enter into a Flower-Garden, in the midft whereof there is a Bafin with its water-work. From one of the ends of the Garden you pals to the Rtvan Koncbf that is to fay, a Chamber fupported by Pillars. It is a Belvedere, or fpa cious Room, having a delightful Profpebf of all Tides, which the Sultan Anwrfh caus’d to be built, at his return from the Perfian War, after he had taken the City of Babylon from Sacb-Seji^ the King of that Kingdom, ruin’d the Province of ‘Tauris, •and added that oiErivan to his Conquefts, by the perfidioufnefs of the Governour. I (hall give you an account anon, how he was juftly puniftTd, for that atb of Treachery, and I referve the Compleat hiftory of his bafenefs, for the Relations of my Travels. • .. - This Rcom or Arbour, which we call the Blvedtre , from the delightfulnels of its Profpeft, ri built in an Eminent place, upon a fieepy Rock. It is a noble Arched Roof, and the Walls, which are rais’d no higher than that a Man may reft his Elbow on them, are all of White Marble, with fome Arabian Verles thereon, cut and gilt. It is open on all (ides, and the Lattices all about it, hinder thole that are within it from being feen by fuch as are on the outfide, and a fiord them withal one of the moft delightful Profpedts in the World.

Whereupon, they being both one day at their ordinary debauch* in the Belvedere, the Grand Seignor without any formality, order'd him to be Strangled, in his prefence. 3 It was fornetirncs alio Amumh s cullome, to bring into that ‘pleafant piace, the Thtfonutie of Principal, SnltdQ?ffes, as, his Mothers, his Sifters, and fuch others as he had the beauti f ul greatdt kindnels for.

Freni thatcioor of the Hall, which gives entrance into the Flower-garden, you ^ ^ pafs, on the right hand, into a kind of Gallery, about fifty paces in length and twdve in breadth, the pavement whereof is a Chequer-work of Black and vVhite chamber z Marble, at the end of it there is a great StruTure, which is wholly of Marble, \and what firft entertains the Eye is a pretty lage Door, over which there is a kind of a fiat arched Roof. And both the Roof, and the Door, are adorn’d with flowers in embofs’d work; and amongft thofe flowers, there are certain impreffes cucm the Marble, and all curioufly Gilt. r - ^ Almut five or fix paces from that Door, you come to another not inferiour to it as to beauty, which is that of the Grand Seignor's own Chamber.

They come out of their Seraglio’s as feldome as they can, and that only, when an indifpenfable necellity forces them to (hew themfelves in publick, whether it be at the head of their Armies, or in, thofe Ceremonies, wherein the Law, or common Civilities, require their Prefence. True it is, that fome of them were not fo great Lovers of Retirement as others, jind preferrV the hardlhips of War, the Divertifefnents of Hunting, before the bland ifhmems of Eafe, and the converfation of Women : But thofe may be re duced into a very fmall number, and the greateft part of them being more addj&amp;ed to mind their quiet, and to lead a Life Void of difturbancc, have tranl- ted all their concerns, Civil and Military, to the management of the principal Minifter of State, thinking it enough to content themfelves with the account he Was pleas’d to give him thereof. it may be faid of the Seraglio,.

For the performance of this work, there are no certain hours appointed, and it is according to the Sun’s being above the Horizon. Upon which account, there is a greater interval between their feveral Offices, in the Summer-time, than there is in the Winter, and they place the principal part of their Devotion upon oblervations of that nature. The firft exercifeis to be perform’d at the break of day, before Sun-rifing; the fecond at Noon; the third, between that time and SunTet; the fourth, immediately after his fetting ; and the laff, about an hour and an half after Night: in all which, unlefs ficknefs intervene, they are very punctual, fo that nothing ofbufinefs, how important foever, fhalldivert them.

They are moreover of a perfwafion, that it is a great fin, for them to put their hand to any part of the body, to fcratch* themfelves, if there fhould .be occafion ; and they would have the external part to be anfwerableto the internal, and correfpondenc to that abjedtion, which ought to be the ffate of the Soul, in the pretence of God, during their Exercifes of Devotion. The Grand Nor does the Grand Seignor himfelf defire to be difpens’d from the obligation Seignors 0 rdR of performing thefe adts of Devotionjany more than the meanefi of his Subjedts; but, mry Employ- on the contrary, he is very religious in that obfervance of their Law, and he always begins the day with the Offices appointed for that part of it; We need fay no more, than that he rifes at the break of day, nay fometimes he is up before, and goes into the Bath to wafh himfelf, efpecially when he has lain with one of his Wives, or Concubines. Having tinifh’d his Prayers, he diverts himfelf in (hooting with the Bowe, or more commonly in looking after his Horfes, and riding fome of them: and fometimes he Tecs himfef in a Gallery, where he v cannot be feen by any, and contents himfelf with the diverfion of feeing fome exercifes perform’d by his Pages. If an one of them does fomething that he is much pleas’d withal, he fends him a Veft, or fome other thing of value, as an encouragement for his doing better another time, and to raife an emulation in his Companions. Upon Council-days, he comes through the clofe Gallery, to the Window, which looks into the Divan Hall, to fee what they are doing there ; and upon the rifing of the Council, he returns to his own Quarter, where his Dinner is brought up to him. The Services of * n fervices of his Table, there is not any great var itey, or delicacy, the Difh- hu Table. J cs that are ferv’d up, being anfwerable to the Bill of fare, wich I have given you in the Chapter, where I treat of the Kitchins. He takes his refcdh’on, fitting, crofs-leg’d, as Taylors do amongft us, being furroiinded with fumptuous Bro cade-cuftil on s, which keep from him the dampnefs of the Walls, and upon the Carpets which cover the Scaffold, or Balcony, where he is fcated, they fpread others ofS/^#-Leather, left the former fhould be prejudic’d by any thing of greafl- nefs, which might fall on the Table-cloath, and {oak through it.

But the Spoons they ufe, in taking their Pottages, and whatever is liquid upon the Table, are much larger than ours; and they are wooden ones. The Pages of the Kilar^ that is the Cup-bearers Office bring up the Bread, arid the Slier- fees, and the Pages of the Chamber go and take the meat, at the Prince's Appart- ment, but of the hands of the Officers belonging to the Kitchin, who bring it in Dilhes cover’d with Pourcelain, the Grand Seignor not ufing any Gold VefTeisat his own Table. . i r - After Dinner, the Grand Seignor fays his Noon-Prayer, and fometimes, on Sundays and ‘fuefdays^ which are the principal Council-days he comes into the Hall df Audience, to difeomie with, his Minitesof State, concerning his Affairs. Oil the other days* he walks in the Gardens of the Seraglio, fomecimes with his Eunuchs^ fometimes with the pultanejfes, or with the Dwarfs and Mutes, who fliew a thoufand apifh tricks, to divert him; and fometimes he goes a hunting, or fiffi- ing, according to his inclination. But neither his Affairs, nor his Recreations do ever divert him from performing the five Exercifes of Devotion, at the times appointed by the Alcoran 5 and it is the general Perfwafion of all the furkf, that if they negled them, they bring down God’scurfe upon themfelves, and that they cannot avoid the ill confequences thereof. % I have faid elfewhere, that Friday is to the Mabumetans, what the Saturday is to The Sultan,' tht Jem, and the Sunday to the CbrijUans, in regard it was upon the faid day, that when Mahomet took his flight from Mecba-, and I have alfo given this further intimation, ™ ^ that the count their Months only b^ the number of the Moons. There is an Mofauey. ancient Cuftome, whereby the Grand Seignor is obliged upon all the firft Fridays of the feveral Moons, tq go ta the new Mofquey, in regard that S. Sophia is too near the Seraglio, and befides that there is not, between thofe places, room enough for fo great a Thin, as that of the Sultan, the people of Canftantinopk would not have the fatisfadion of feeing him. ' His Devotion is fo great, that he feldom miffes that Ceremony, and when there paffes a firft Frydat of the month, without his appearance in it, the people is prcfently of opinion*' tl|at he is fick and thereupon turbulunt fpirits are mutining their faTious defigns. On thofe dayesdo they, who have any complaints to make, of fome injuftke that has been done them, take their opportunity and plant themielves in the way through which he is to pafs, with Petitions in their hands, which upon a fign made by the Sultan, are receiv'd by Eunuchs. If the injuftice be very great and the perfon who prefenfs the Petition _ be pxtreamly opprefs’d and injur’d, he holds a lighted Torch over his head, which is ordinari ly pradis’d in Turfy' u P 3n thc occafions, and by that myfterious comportment, intimates to the Prince; That if he does not do him juftice, his Soul fhall burn in the other World, as that Torch does in this. Upon the Empcrour’s going out of the Seraglio, the principal Sultamjfes, his Mother, his deareft Confort, or his Sifters, are in a Room over the great Gate of that Palace, with Bags full of Afpers, which they fling among the people, that they may pray, That God would gracioufly hearken to the Devotions, which the Grand Seignor is going to perform. His March is after the lame Order, and With an obfervance of the Pomp, as that of the anc e it Greeh^ Emperours, and I queftion not, but that thole Authors, who have written of the Ottoman ^ Empire in general, or particularly of the City o{ Conjlantinopk, have made fufficient de- kriptions, of that Ceremony, and therefore I ftiall think my felf ^difpens’d from the obligations of giving a new one of it. I ffiall only fay this of it. That it is very Magnificent, and that there is not any Monarch in the World, who makes • £&gt; yreat an expofal of Gold and precious Stones together, wherewith the Har- nciles and Trappings of moft of the Horfes, as well of the Grand Seignor, as thofe the Baffds are all cover’d*8 o A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. et Money.

Upon this Exhortation, the Sultan orders twenty or thirty Purfes to be diftributed amongft them; nay fometimes his Charity is lo great, as to amount to twenty thoufand Crowns, which are receiv’d by the Moufti, and the diftribution thereof is made, as he pleafes. But the greater part of it he converts to his own ufc, and holds an infamous Correfpondcnce with moll of that wretched Crew, who though they often prelent themielves for that Benevolence, he pretends not.to have any knowledge of at all. By this Impollure, which isfo palpable, and fuits well enough with the followers of Mahomet^ does that High- Priell of the Malmmetan Law, put yearly into his Purfe, a confiderable Sum of Money, which is no fmall augmentation to his Revenue. But the Cafe is the lame With him, as with the Balia’s: that is, he is not exempted from refunding, and we fhall, by and b^ produce a very late Example of it. . C And this may ferve for a general Account of the ordinary Lives of the Ottoman Monarchs while they are within the Seraglio. In their Armies, they have other Employments, efpecially they, who have'Military Souls, as there have been fome among them, of whom Hiltories have given,us a very noble Charadfer. I come now ro the prefent Bate of the Ottoman Family, and to the particular inclinations of the Grand Seignor, who now Reigns. Mahomet^ the Fourth of that Name, the Son of Ibrahim, and a Circafian Lady, was Born in the Year 1643. and he is, by that account, got into theThirty fourth Year of his Age, and the Twenty fourth of his Reign. He has two Brothers, Bajazet, and Orchan, but they are by another Mother, who is Bill living, and is perpetually fludying how to preferve them. He has alfo a third Brother, named Solyman, who is the fecond of the Sons of Ibrahim, according to /the order of their Nativities. But the Mother of the lafl mentioned Son is dead ; and thence it comes, that the Souldiery, who con ceive greater hopes of that Prince, than of either Bajazet, or Orchan, his Brethren, pity him the more, and have the greater Affedtion for him, upon that very fcore of his having lofl the fupport, which he might have expeTed from a Mother. Ever fince the time of Bajazet the Second, who firfl introduc’d that inhumane and cruel Cuflome, of fecuring the Throne of the Sultan-Regent, by the death of his Brethren, few of thofe unfortunate Princes have efcap’d the Barbarifm of their Elder-Brother, and they,amongfl them, who have been treated with fome- what lefs of inhumanity, have pin’d away their Lives in a flridl and doleful Im- prifonment, being not permitted to fee any body. This was the Treatment of Ibrahim, the Father of Mahomet, during the Reign of Amurath, his Brother* the Son of Achmet, by Kiofem, a Woman of Excellent Parts, and well vers’d in the Manage ment of Affairs. Mahomet’s Brothers are now treated after the fame rate, and the Mother of Bajazet, and Orchan, ules all the endeavours flie can, to fecure to them the Affedtions of the great Officers of the Port, and the Janizaries, who are fomewhat dilgufled with the capricious humour, and extraordinary Covetoufnefs of Mahomet. This Prince was advanc’d to the Throne in the Year 1650. alter the Death of Ibrahim, his Father, who was firangled by the Janizaries in a Sedition. He being then but Seven Years of Age, the Regency was beflowed, during his Minority, on the Old Sukanefs, Mother to Ibrahim, who foon after abus’d her Authority, and raifed a dangerous Faftion againfi her Grand-Child Mahomet, wherein {he lofl her Life. The prelent Grand Seignor, who is a Perfon much add idled to his Pleafures, - ..nd takes a particular diverfion in Hunting, leaves the management of Affairs to trJ Son (uccef- Grand Vizir Achmet, who has fuxeeded Coprdgti, his own Father, in that principal fyely Grand Charge of the Empire. ’Tis a thing which may well pafs for a Prodigy, amonglt tizirs. the furky, and fuch as that there has not yet been any Example of it leen 3 as per haps there will not be any other hereafter. I have fhewn, that it is a thing abfolutely contrary to their Politicks; and therefore had it not been for the great and particular obligations, which the Empire had to Gfrogli, who an the other fide, cunningly reprefented to ihe Grand Seignor, that he never-durfl trufi any but An extraordi nary ExampleA Relation of the Grand Seigmrs S e r. a g li o. 81 buc his own Son, with the Secret of Affairs, whereof he only had the'Key, this very AcbmeR who next to the Sultan, is the principal Perfon of the Empire, would have been, at prefent, but a fimplc or Captain of a Galley.

He is very much troubled with a met IV -. rail, which he receiv’d in the violence of his Game, fome years fmee, by leaping pr ^ ent Prjnceo his Horfe over a broad Ditch : And whereas that pallion is hill predominant in him, this inconvenience attends it, That, when he is not fomewhat favourable and indulgent to himfelf, in that violent Exercife, be is fomeeimes taken off his Horfe in a miferable condition, the Remedies which might be apply’d to that indifpofition, taking no effed, by reafon of the little care he takes to preferve himlelf. He is a peribn of an nnconftant and unquiet d/fpofition, which creates the greater trouble to thofe who wait 01 him? and though they ftudy hi^ humours, yet is k a hard matter to fatisfie him. He has a Son, who lias been CitcUmcis’d with great Solemnity, at the Age, wherein that Ceremony is to be perform’d: The Sultan els, his Mother, a Woman of a Magnificent humour, to augment the Pomp and Splendour of that Adion, to the Eyes, as well of the as Forreiners, would have the Garment, which the Young Prince wore that day, to be all cover’d with Diamonds, and, to that end, caus’d feveral Rich Pieces of the Trea- fury to be broken; but after the Solemnity, all the Precious Scones were carried back into it again. , # u ' I laid erewhile, that the prefent Sultan-Mahomet is extreamly addided to Hunting, and makes it fo much his Darling Divertifement, that he makes lefe account of the Lives of Men, than he does of his Dogs 5 and withal, that he is of a very. Covetous Humour. 1 fhall, in one fingle Example make a fufficient dilcovery of both thofe inclinations in him, and that will alfo further make it appear, hoW well he was skill’d, in that Knack of exercifing great Liberalities, without any dedudion out of his Revenues. ^ ; f When the Grand Seignor goes a Hunting, there are Orders fent to a great number of People, for the Ipace of four or five Leagues about the place where he r r \ intends to Hunt, in order to the f irrounding of a certak quantity of Ground, and for the enclofing of it fo well, as that nothing can efcape thence. Tis not to be imagin’d, this can be done, without great deftrudion to the Countrey, and, much inconvenience to the poor People, who are forc’d to leave their Work, to carry on an Exercife which is much more toiliome than it, in which they many times come off with the Lofs of Limb, or Life, or fome other difaff rous Accident. Theft continual impofitions oft rouble and toil,put many People into the repining humour, infomuch that an Eunuch, who was in favour, having one day, taken the free dom to represent to the Grand Seignor the prejudice his Subjeds underwent, by thofe eourfes which occafion’d the fpoyling of their Grounds, and the lofs of their Lives, he grew very Angry, and after fome days Imprifonment, he gave him a ftameful Ejedion out of the Seraglio. . But, in procefs of Time, the mifchievous Inconveniences occafion’d by this in stable. purfuance of his Pleafures in Hunting, increafing more and more, the Grand vizir, and the other Balia’s, rcfolv’d to intreat the Mwfti^ to make a Re- monffrance ro liim, of the ill confeqaence thereof, he being the only Perfon who might prefiime to fpeak any more of it to the Grand Scignor. The Moufti would by no means hearken to it at firff, imagining, as he might well, that his Ha rangue Would not be pleafing to the Sultan : But, at laff, being over-perfwaded to do that good office to the Publick, he took Courage, and his opportunity, to fpeak tohirri, withallthe inffnuation he A could.

That Piece of Work, was made by the Grand Seignor himfelf, who had lent him to Sell it, in order to his own fuffenance: And that the Balia, or other Perfon, to,whom it Was direfted, to exprefs how highly he was pleas’d therewith, gave him a certain number of Purfes for it 5 not accounting the Prefent which was to be made to the Bearer: That what Money came in that way, was defign’d to bear the Charges of the Prince’s own Table, and by that means, he.: could not be charg’d with living by the Labour of his Subjeds. To^ this effed was the Mouftfs harangue § and I fhall tell you by the way, That the Kings of Perfia have the fame Cufiome, dr rather the fame Suptrfdion. Un the Reign of Shach-Ab^ there Were built, at Iftahan ^ certain ~ Piaccs called Caravanferas ^ which are publick houfes, where the 'Merchants are lodg’d, the Rents whereof ire let afide for the maintenance of the King’s own Table ; the Money which is raisd by the Cuftoms, and other Impofitions, beihg accounted as to that fcore, for Haram^ that is to fay, for ttnjiifl and forbidden^ and referv’d to be employed in the Exigencies of State, and. not for the Suflenance of the Prince. The Sultan k The Grand Seignor difTembling and fmotherlng the vexation, into which the , vZffiflb Moufti's Remonftrance had put him, pretended to take his Advertifements very Moufti.

He acknowledg’d, that he r t .-v? w ^ at P e re pi'6fented to him, and that he had a way of Livelihood in his head, vdiich he hop’d would take very well. Some days pals’d away, ere the Grand Seignor made the leaf!: mention of Hunting; but at laff, he grows impatient, he leaves the Seraglio, and had the good fortune to kill a Hare with a Gun, the firfl he had ever deftroy’d that way. He immediately fends it to the Mufti, with order to tell him, That he has follow’d his Advice, and that having learnt the Profeffion of a Huntfman, he has commanded that firft piece of his Game fhould be brought to him, which he was willing to fell, that he might fubfifl: by the Money it fliould produce : That he fail not to give twenty Purfes to him who brings it; and that as to his own Perfon, he knew well enough what he ought to fend him. v ' . v The Moufti conceal’d hisfurprizal as well as he could, and receiv’d the Hare with great teflimonies of his refentments and joy, of the honour, which his High- nefs had done him; and having beftow’d, according to his own order. Twenty Purfes upon the Bearer of the Hare, fends Sixty more to the Grand Seignor him felf ; learning, at his own Coft, and that to the value of Fourfcore thoufand: v Crowns, that men fhould not be over-forward to give their Sovereigns thofe Ad- vertifements, which they defire not of them. To finifh the Pourtraiture of Suhan-Mafomet, he is further chargeable with a de- fed of conftancy, in his humour, and a roughnefs of deportment towards h&gt;s People, who are thereupon apnxphave the lefs Afiedion for him. And whereas he is indefatigable in his Kunting-Exercifes, and fpends whole dales therein, even in the fevereff part of the Winter-Seafon, it happen’d, one day, as he Was returning home, from the Sport of running down a Stag, that his Grand Faulconer took the boldnefs to reprefent to him the inconvenience of expofing his Slaves fo much m the Ice and Snow, by which means there had dy’d about Thirty of them the ' T , NightA Relation of the Grand Seiqndrs Seraglio.

There is not in all Chriffendome anyMonaftery of Religious Virgins, how regular and auftere foever it may be, the entrance whereof is more firidtly forbidden to men, than is that of this Appartment of the Women i infomuch that my white Eunuch, who has futpply’d me with fo particular a defeription of the inner part of the Seraglio, could give me no certain information of this Quarter of it, where the Women are lodg’d. All I could geroutof him, was, That the $ Doors of it are kept by Negro-EunUchs, and that, befides the Grand Seignor nimklf, and fometimes, the Phyfician, in cafe of great needliry, there never enters any man into h, no nor Woman, befides thoie who live in it, and they are never -permittied to go out of it, unlefs it be in order to their confinement in the^Old Seraglio.

But I do nor exped, any one fhould wonder at that great exa&amp;nefs of not permicing any man, no not even a White Eunuch, to approach the Appartmenc ol the Women, after an Accident, which happen’d at Adnampk, in the Year of our Lord M. DC XXXIX. and which I lhall here infert in fei words /Z mh, at his return, after the taking of Bagdet, came and made his abode, for fome time, at Adrian^ He had a Page, belonging to the Treafury, who was a INative of locat, in Natolia, and, from the place of his birth, they gave him the name of focatdi. He was a well-let Young man, rebuff, skillful in W'refiling and upon that account, the Grand Seignor had made Chief of the Wrefllers. ’ It happen’d, that one of the moil Famous, for that Exercifc, came about that time to Adnanopk, out of the Confines of Mufcovy, and in all the Ciries, through which he travel d he had ajwaies been too hard for thofe who had prefemed them (elves to Wreftle with him. His Keputation was fpread all over the Empire where he had not met with any Wreffler, who acknowledg’d not himfelf inferiour to him ; Which Report coming to the Page of the Treafury, he conceiv’d lb great an emulation at the Fame of that Man, whom all the World fo higly celebrated, that he fent one of the Hdvagis, to carry him a Civil Challenge from him, and to acquaint him, That he Was dehrous to have a Tryal of Skill toith him, in the Grand Seignor s Prefence. He fent him word withal, That, before hisHighhefs a j ar J7 n0CIC , e °f ICl con venient, they made fome tryal of their ftrehgrh ; r An l that no body might know any thing of it, he would fend him pBoihntfs b y which means he might come into the Seraglio. / When the Grand Seignor is not within the Seraglio, whenever it be the Boflmgs arc permitted to come into, and to go out of it, by the Garden-Gate; and there being a great number of them, it is no hard matter to get a man in ? n their accoutrements. By this contrivance did the Mufcovian WreffJer get into the Seraglio, the next day, upon the follicitation of the Page, who fent him What was requital; the Grand Seignor being that day, gone a Hunting. Thev both put on Drawers of Leather well liquor’d with fomc fat or oyly fluff; all the ® the body bung fhuk naked, ana liquord in like manner r and after a long &lt;1i pute, the Page had the better whether he got ft fairly by his own ftrength, and “her yielded the viftory, out of complaifance. 1 Ins Action pafs’d in the midft of the place which is before the Garden, in the P c en,c o the Mutes, and all the Pages of the Seraglio ; and the Grand Seignot being return J from Hunting, the Saperintendent of the Treafury told him. That tncre was come into the City, a Pkhhvan, a Mafcovite by Country, rebuff, and o( a good, mecn, of great ftrength., and well experienced in WrcHling, and that. . if-- a * A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. if his Highneis pleas’d he fhould have chc fatisfa&amp;ion to fee him engag’d in that Exercife. The Grand Seignor commanded he fhould be brought into the Sera glio, the next day, and that T’ocateli fhould have notice, to be ready to entertain Being both come to the place, and in a condition ready to clofe, the Grand 'Seignor came into a Gallery, attended by all the Grandees of the Seraglio, to be Spectators of that Tryal of Skill in Wreftling. The Victory having flood as Were in the ballance a good while, and all Spedators, being fomewhat impatient, to fee which fide it would turn to, a Mute exprefs’d himfelf by figns, to one of his Companions, to this efihff. That he wondered the Page, who fhould havo deriv’d new frrength and courage, from the Grand Seignor s prefence, found it fo difficult to get the better of the Mufcovite^ whom he had fo cafily woffled the day before^ ' . 7 .. . : The language of the Mutes, by figns, is as intiligable in the Seraglio, as if they had the liberty of fpcaking, and the Grand Seignor, who-underhands it as well as any of them, as having been accufiom’d thereto from his Infancy,and commonly difeourfing With them, was hrangly furpriz’d, to underhand that the Uufcovite had been, the day before, in the fame place. His indignation immediately flufh’d into his. face 5 he commanded the Wrehlers to give over their Exercife, and’, calling the Page to hittb he ask’d him, how he had contriv’d that man’s enteranCe into the Seraglio. The unfortunate focatJi^ who could not deny a thing, which fo many others were ready to tehifie, acquainted his Highnefs with what had pafs’d; where upon, the Suit an ^ incens’d at the gteatnefs of his confidence, prevented his making an end of the Story, by commanding the Bojlangi-hachi to be prefently fent for, whom he order’d to feizc on the Mnjcovian Wrefller, and fee him receive Five hundred blows 00 the foies of the Feet, with a Wand or Cudgel; which no doubt was enough to make him uncapable of exercifing himfelf, for-a good while after. The Overiecr had Orders, to fee the fame punifhment inflicted upon the Page iocatdi 5 which was immediately put in execution : the Grand Seignor having, in the mean time, retir’d into the Appartmcnt of the Women. It ; as the Opinion of moff about the Seraglip,-that thofe two unfortunate Wretches would have efcap’d, with the pumTnmcnl of Five-hundred blowes, each of them, upon the foks of their feet. But the Grand Seignor, who was relolv’d tb have their lives, and had retir’d, purpofely into the Lodgings of the Women, to prevent all mediation for their pardon, fent away prefently a fccond Order, to the B fangi-BacJih, whereby he was commanded to lee the Page bang’d up , in the Evening, on a Tree, Which is at the Corner of the place where they had Wreifled, and, ulie. Mufcozite on 'another-Tree, which is without the Gate of the Seraglio. Some w-: .1 rhe a -r. to think, that thefe two Executions were enough to appeafe Amufkh’s the Prince’s uidGaa r! on: but it prov’d other wife. The next morning, the Sultan- £r eat Severity, Amurath fent 'tot the 'Capi-A&amp;d, the chiefeft amongfl the Eunuchs, and the Grand Maker and Comptroller, of the Seraglio, and commanded, That the GeUad, who is the common Executioner, fhould alfo give his attendance. Upon the palling of thefe Orders, all thofe, that were prefent, caff themfelvesat his HighnefTe’sleer, 1 befeeching him to conlidcr, That the Capi-Aga was innocent, that he had not the leak notice of the confidence of the Page, and that, if it had come to his know ledge, he would have feverely punifh’d it. The Grand Seignor continuing kill extrcamly incens’d, could not be appeas’d by all the imreaties and fubmiffions they made to him, and would have the Capi-Aga^ as Grand Maker of the Sera glio, to be anfwerable for all thofe that come into it; when, for the good fortune of chat principal Officer of the S«/Ws Palace, there came in the Mokfii, and the Seligdar, Chief of tkwPages of the Chamber, who with much ado madea fnife to beg his pardon. Ycf was not that ganted but in part; for all they could obtain, ex tended only to ilhe faving of his life; and fo the Grand Scignor order’d him to be v immeditelv thruk out of the Seraglio, with a charge never to enter again into it, while he liv’d ; and inkead of the Dignity of BaJJa^ whereto he fhould have been ; advanc’d, to be reduc’d, to a fmall Pen Ikon of Three lunkircd Afters a day.86 A Reiatiop of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. I thought pertinenc to my defign,. to bring in this Story oi the T wo reliefs, in order to the greater confirmation of what 1 have affirm’d at the beginning of this Chapter, concerning; the impoliibility there is, for any perfon whatioever, Man, or Woman, to get into the Appartment of the Sultanejjes, when they punilh, with fo much feverity, a Stranger, who without expids order, prefumes but to let his foot within any Court of the Seraglio.

Certain it is, that this Quarter of the Seraglio, as to fome part of it, has a fair Profpedt upon that of the Grand Seignor, and that the Doors of it are kept night and day, by a certain number of NegroGEwucbs } the molt deformed, and the moft dreadful to look upon, that can be'found. 7c is certain alfo, that it is well furmfftd with abundance of moft beautiful Women, , of leveral Countries, who, by the chance of War, or otherwife, are fallen imp the hands of the Bajfa's, and Governours of Provinces, who fend them up, as ; Prefents to the Grand Seignor. It is known aftb. That, of that variety of YVo- men, the Prince does not appropriate to himfelf above-two or three, whom he has the greateft affection for ; 'nay fomc of thofe Princes have confin'd themfelvcs to the embraces of one only, after intermarriage. And this is affirm’d, at Gonfiantiwflc, of Solyman the Great, after he had plighted hft faith to Roxulana^ contrary ro the ordinary Policy of the Turks^ after the affront, done by Tmur-leng, to the Wife of Bajazet. The white Eunuchs, who wait in the Grand Seignor’s Lodgings, are able in fome meafure, to give an account of thefe things, in regard that the Woman, who is to participate of the Grand Seignor’s Bed, is conduced into his own Chamber; and, if it be a new Amour, the nolle of it is fpread, the next day, all over the Seraglio. It is alfo known, That the firft of thofe Women, who is deliver’d of a Male- child, and by that means, becomes Mother to the perfumptive Heir of the Ottoman* Empire, is confider’d as the principal Sultanefs y and treated according to her dig nity: and the others, who afterwards have Sons or Daughters, have alldthe quality and denomination of Sultaneffes ; but the number of the Women, who are to wait on them, is much inferiour, to that of thofe who are to attend the principal Suhanefs. It is known in fine. That thofe young Princes are brought np under the tutelage of their Mothers, till they are fo many years of Age ; and ^When they areftrong enough to be put upon certain Exerciies, they have Cover- Hours and Mafters appointed over them , in a diftindt Quarter by themfelvs. Beftdes thefe things, which may be pofitively known, concerning the Appart- ment of the Women, in the Seraglio, it may well be immagin’d, that the em w , bellifliments of their Lodgings are anfwerable to thofe of the Grand Seignor, fince it is the Place, where he paftes away the moft divertive part of his time. It is alio not to be queftion’d , but that it has its Infirmary, its Baths, and the ether accommodations, and conveniences, that can be wifft’d for. It may alfo be_ conjcdhir’d, that there is, in this Quarter, an obfervance of the fame regulations, as there arc in the Chambers of the Ichoglans: That fome of the more ancient Maicis are Miftreffes over the Younger ones, and are, night and day em ploy’d in ohferving their a£Uons; and that their unvoluntary reftrainc forces them to the fame unfcemly Actions amongft themfdves, as the brutifh Pailions of thofe Young Men engages them in, whenever they can find the opportunities to commit them. And this prefumption has no doubt given occafion to the Fa bulous Story, which , is related of their being ferv’d up with Cucumbers cut into pieces, and not intire, out of a ridiculous fear leaft they fhould put them 'to tindecent ufes: they who have forg’d the Story not knowing, that it is the cuftome in the' Levant, to cut the Fruit a-crofs, into great thick ft ices* as I fhall make it appear in the Chapter, where I treat of Gardens. But it is net only in the Seraglio, that that abominable Vice reigns, but it is predominant alfo in the CitV Cmliantinoplt\ and in all the Provinces of the Empire, and the wicked Example of the Men, who, flighting the natural ufe of Women-kind, are mutually in flam’d with a detcftable loye for one another, unfortunately enclines the Women to intimate them.

The Spabi-Bachi came in the Rear of them, having a Plume of Heron-tops in his Turbant, three foot in height, which made him remarkable, and diffinguifh’d him from all the other Spahis. On the brcaft-piecc of his Horfe, were faftn’da dozen little Scarfis, which hung down negligently, and he was attended by fix Pages, who had Caps on, after the Slavonian M xie, red Vefts tuck’d up about the Wafte, and yellow Hole, or Drawers. v: A|t!er ifpafhy there pafs’d feyeral Janizaries, but not marching in any order, TOlovrd my two hundred men on Hoi;[c-back, and in the Rear of them, came the Janizary-Aga, a Perfon of a very goodly prefencc.

I T Is an ancient Cuftom, or rather, a Law, effablifh’d by the Ottoman Princes, that the profits made out of their Gardens, fhould be contributary to the keeping of their own Tables, and they have feveral of them, in the Neigh bourhood of Conflantinople, as well on the European fide, as the A fan, all along the Sea-fhdre. But I fhall giv e an Account only of the Gardens of the Seraglio, that fo I may not exceed the limits I have prefenb’d to my felf in this Relation. There are in the Seraglio feveral Gardens, wherein there are only Flowers, m divers Appartments, and particularly in that of the Grand Sdgnor, and, no queftion but the fame thing may be faid of the Quarter of the Sultanejfes- Yet is mere not any thing extraordinary, which might oblige me to give this defcription thereoh The great Garden, whereof the Bojlangi-bachi has the overfighr, as he has al.o 01 all the others belonging to the Grand Seignor, takes up the greateff pait ofthe^Seraglio. and confifls of a great number of Walks, planted of each fide with Cypre.s. 1 no.e Walks arc much negleded, fothat in feveral places, they are not clear’d of Bryars and Thorns. When it is known, that the Grand Seignor is to come and take nis divertifement there, a great number of Bojlangis are immediately commanded out to make clean the Walks, which he ufes to frequent, and the ipaces between tho|e Walks are fo many Kitchin-Gardens, or Orchards, which are very wed turmina with Fruit-Trees, of feveral excellent kinds. Of Strawberries a!id Rafpices were is great (fore, and they have large beds of Melons, and Cucumbers; but mott ofthefelaff, which are accounted a great delicacy amongh tlic Levantines. As to the Cucumbers, they commonly eat them without taking on any tying f the rindc, after which they go and drink a glais of Water. In ad Afia, ordinary fuffcnance of the meaner fort of People, for rhe^ (pace of three or y u rdonths j. the wliole Family lives upon them, and when 2 Child asks for .onittuing* v rJSig (our Hk oroltle p’/ de- rs&gt; Fririccs, - to k Neigti- 11 along ':b,te n. msjiti tieliion :re oof ierf b of all Tagfe m h’tf tck C 0 0 ui0 tbtf nrf t’t {W four ' to A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. to ear whereas in our European Countries, they would give hirn bread ; in the Uvantl they bring him only a Cucumber, which he eats raw, as it comes out of the Garrifon. Laborious perfons, and fuch as are in a manner tyr’d with work ing fuch as Camel-drivers, and thofe who are entrufted with the care of the Horfes and Mules, in the Caravans, make a kind of Sailed of their Cucumbers, not much unlike the Maih, which we would give our Horfes. When they are come to the Lodging place, where the Caravan is to make a flay, they take a large Bafm, which they almoft, fill with water, and having put fome fowr milk into it they cut a great number of Cucumbers, into great flices, and, fo make a kind of malh of them. Tis a pleafant fight to fee them at the confounding of it. Amongft ten, or twelve, who all (land round the faid Bafin, there is but one woo den Spoon, which every one takes his turn, till they have made a fhift to empty the Bafin. That done, they fall a drinking of water, and thofe who have where withal) go and take a difh of Coffee, or fmoke a Pipe of Tobacco. But to do them all the right they deferve, the Cucumbers, in the Leavant are ex cellently good, and, though eaten raw, they never do a man any hurt. The Story of the Cucmbers which occahon’d the cruel death of Seven Pages of the Grand Seignor’s Chamber, is not, haply, known to all people * or at^ leaft, all know not the reafon, why the Pages of the Chamber are not now permitted to go into the Gardens. . . . • t j r,, Sultan Mahomet, the fecond of that name, taking a turn in the Gardens or the Seraglio attended by his Pages, was much furpriz’d to fee a bed of Cucumbers, which look’d very fair to the eye, and were extreamly forward conhdering the Seafon. Being a great lover of that fruit, he recommended them to the Boftangi* bachi, who told them over every day, and, with fome impatience, expected their maturity, that he might prefent them to the Grand Seignor. Some dales afeery going to Vifit the bed, he found his number of Cucumbers fhorter, than it mould have been, by three or four, and that they who had taken thofe that were milling, had made choice of the ripeft, and thereupon making a ftridfc enquiry, to find out who had been guilty of that prefumption, he found that the Pages of the Cham ber were the only perlons who had been, that day;, in the Gardens. Upon that difeovery, he Went and gave an account of the whole matter to the Grand Seignor, who was fo highly incens’d thereat, that, not prevailing with any one of the Pages to acknowledge the Theft, he, out of a cruelty as much above all credit, as beyond all example, caus’d the Bellies of feven of them to be ripp’d up. The Theft was found in the Belly of the leventh of thofe unfortunate Young Men,- Who, after the execution done on the other fix, wouid not acknowledge his guilt, out of hopes, that the Prince’s indignation would not have extended fo far. From that very time and in commemoration of fo ffrangean a£Hon, the Pages of the Cham ber are not permitted to go into the Gardens of the Seraglio 5 what one Prince has cftablifh’d, as I have hinted elfewhere, being never revok’d by his SuccelTors, who bear a certain refpeft to the enactions of their Anceftors. , * ^ In the midfl of the Great Walk, which goes from the Seraglio, to the Sea-Gate A Pyramid. which looks cowards Sc^dam, there is a Pyramid, erefted upon a iquare Pedeftal, and which four men would have much ado to fathom. About the Pedelfal they have iuffer’d fome bryars and thorns to grow, and it feems to have been done out ‘ of ddign, to hinder peoples coming dole to it. The Pyramid, from the top to the bottom, is full of Figures, whereof the heads are fhuck oh j and it may hu conjedur’d by fome remainders, that there Was a very noble head on the top of it, as being the Maher piece of the work. This Pyramid fomewhat rcfelembles Pillar at Home 5 and fome, who have feen both, imagine, they were the Work of the fame mafler. # . All the Fountains of the Gardens have their Bafins of Marble, or dineretit colours. Fountain^ Near each of them, there is a little Scaffold, furrounded with Ballifters, which they fpread with rich Carpets, and Brocado-Cuihions, when the Sultap comes to take his walk there ; and ’tis only at that time, the Waters play j which Diverfion he frequently .gives the PrincefTes who bear him Company. , „ r ^ , There* are appointed for the Culture of thefe Gardens two thomand Bolfangis ; Tno Gardiners and yet, though there be fo vaft a number to keep them, they come far fhort of the Neat Contrivances and Imbelliftiments of ours.

General taws for all the Ma- humetan Se^s, I Have fo often had ocafion, In the prefent Relation have made of the Grand Seignor’s Seraglio, to fpeak of the Mahometan Religion^, that I am content before I put a period to this Work, to make it appear, how far it extends into the three parts of our great Continent: Mahumetifme having not yet fee footing into that which has been difeover’d but two Ages fince. I meddle not at all with the Dodrinc of it, of which I am fufficiently aflur’d that many perfons have written: and 1 fhall only entertain the Reader with a Geographical Chart of all the Countries of Europe^ and Africa^ which are under the dominion of the followers of Mahomet. Though the Opinions of their Dodtors be different, as to what £onecrns the Explication of the Law, and that there are principally two great^ Seek, that of Mahomet , which is the Stock ; and that ot Halt , one of his principal SuccefTors : Yet thofe two general Sedts, and the particular ones, which are derivable thence, are all concordant in the fundamental Points, which every Mahumetan is oblig’d, in Confcicnce, to obferve and pradfife. Of thofe I gave an account, when I made mention of the Prayers or Devotions, which the are bound to perform five times a day, and the Pilgrimage of Mecha h one of thofe principal Articles. I have alfo laid fomething of them, in the Chapters treating of the Prefent, which the Grand Seignor fends thither every Year; and in this Lift, I fhall endeavour to exprefs my Telf fully as to that matter. In Europe, we have no Mahumetan Princes but the Emperonr of the TW^and the Cham of the Leffcr ‘Tartary : But in Jfia there are many of them, who are powerful, and poflefs’d of great Dominions. The Grand Seignor extends his Jurifdidh'on, In this part, beyond the Sources of the River Tigris, and beyond the mouths, by which it falls , into the Sea, and towards the North, as far as the Territories of the Mengrehans. To go thence from the Weft to the haft, next the Grand Seignor, we muff count the Princes of the Three Arabia's, with fcvcr.il of whom I have often fpqken, in Two of-my Voyages, wherein J have been oblig’d to pais through the Defarts. The Kina; of Perfia, the Great Mogul, the King of Vifapour, the King of GAconda, the Kings on the Coaff of Malabar , of whom the moil: confide rable is that of Comorin-, the Great Cham of Tart ary, apa the Kings of the Mountains, to the North fide of the fame T^tarj',\vho are got into China • All thefe Kings, I fay, follow the Mahumetan, Religion.A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio. q o Since I have mentioned the Emperour of Java, I fhall, by the way, inlert here ^ curious Re« an obfcrvation, which l made at the time of my being in that /Hand, which was, °f tb * That the eldeft Son of that Emperour, who regin’d in the year 1648, had fix fingers on each of his hands, and fix toes one each foot, and all of equal J length. r y&gt; _ ' The Kings or Perfta, Vifapour and Golconda follow the 5 e£l of Halt ; and the Kings following Kings of the mountains of Tart ary. With fome others, have alfo their particular tbe y Do ^ neo f Se&amp;s. Befides, it is to be obferv’d, that if we except the Grand Seignor, the la King-of Perfia, the Arabian Princes, and the Cham of Great Tartary, all the other Kings, whom I have named, have only Idolaters to their Subje&amp;s, and all the meaner fort of people is involv’d in the darknefs ofPaganifm. But as to the Grand Seignor’s, with all hij Militia, they follow the Law of Mahomet. In Africa, there is a Mahometan King, whofe Territories lie ail along the Coaft of Akx, which is towards Arabia Felix, as far as the Cape of Guardafu, and his Jurifdi&amp;ion extends over the Red Seay and the Ocean. The Governours, whom the Grand Seignot* employs in Egypt, aud in the /{lands of the Red Sea, and thofe others, whom hd has elfablifh’d all along the Coaft of Barbary, at Tripoli, Tunis, and Argun&gt; who afTnme the Title of Kings, are alfo Mahumetans ; and, in fine, the King of Fez and Morocco follows the fame Law. All thefeKihgn and Princes, are principally unanimous in this Point, That they acknowledg themielves oblig’d to fend every year fome Prefent to Mecha,which ordi narily Con lifts in rich Carpets, to be put upon Mahomet's Sepulchre. Sometimes thefe ne Great Mch Prefents are made upon a particular Vow 5 and it happen’d in one of my Voyages gul\r Royal to Agra, that the Great Mogul, by way of thankfulnefs to the Prophet, for the re- f ent t0 Mecha. covery of his health, fent to Mecha, an Akoron, valued at four hundred thoufand Crowns, which had, in the mid ft of the Cover, a Diamond, of three hundred Carats 5 the reft of it being garnifk’d with feveral precious Stones on both fides. The occafion of this Prefent was, the fright which d certain Bramtn, put him into, upon his telling him, That he fhould die before the year was expir’d, which happen’d not accordingly. But the King being extremely incens’d at that direful Predition, and, upon the fmart Interrogatory he put to the Bramere, to wit. Whether he knew alfo the time of his own death, having receiv’d this AnfWer, That it fhould be within three days; which really happen’d upon the third day, there was a fufficient ground for him to be frightned, and to conceive an appre- henfion, that the like accident might happen to himfelf, before the time limited. Twas that induc’d him to fend a Prefent of fo great value, to Mahomet's Sepulchre, to acknowledge the favour he had done him, in not fullering the Predi&amp;ron of the Branterc to take eifeCt, the King having not had as much as any indilpofitiony during all that time. When I gave an account of the Pilgrimage of Mecha, ftpon occafion of the The feveral Teat and Carpet, which the Grand Seignor fends thither every year, I made ^ays whereby no mention of the feveral ways which the Caravans take, according to the feveral the Mallume ~ parts of the World, from whence great multitudes of Mahumetans do every year fhe Sepulchre of take their progrefs thither. ^ their Prophet/ In thy firft place, the Ambaffadon, whom the Kings of the Iflands, whereof I nave given you the names, and the Kings of the Indies, on this fide the Ganges, fend to the Sbecl^ot Mecha, with their Prefents come by Sea, to Mocha, a Maritime City of Arabia Felix, and from thence they travel to Mecha by Land, by the conveniency of Camels. The Per fans, who inhabit all along the Sea-fide make their defeent from Omus, or to Bandar, and having pafs’d over the Gulf, which, at that place, is not above twelve or thirteen Leagues in breadth, are forc’d to crofs Arabia ere they can get to the Prophet’s City. But the Inhabitants of the upper-parts of Per fa, towards the Cafpian Sea,and all the Tartars, come to Tauris, and from Tauris to Aleppo, from which Phce, the great Caravans, which take their progrefs through the Defarts, fee forth, jtod bring the Pilgrims to Mecha. Some take the way of Babylon, but very feldom. 01a his Subjefts to cake that Rode, thinking himfelf not inferiour to the Tmh. - ( N 2. ) Some94 A Relation of the Grand Seignors Seraglio- Troublefome Some of the Devouter fort of Perfans^ and fuch as are moft zealous for their Vefarts m the oWn ta k e t he way of Babylon i upon this fcore, that brings them at the fame lire S time to the Sepulchre of their Prophet Half which is but eight days Journey e * kC diftant from it. This is the moft wretched place, of all the places upon earth, and affords no water but the moft corrupted water, which is drawn out of certain Pits, and that of a Canal, which Scbach-Abas caus’d to be brought thither from the Euphrates, but which is now quite out of repair. Whoever expe£b to drink good water there, muft bring it along with him, from other pla ces five or fix days Journey diftant from the other: And yet that falfe Pro^ phet impofes on thole, who have fuch a Devotion for him , not only the inconveniences of coming fo far off; but alfo thofe of being in a fair way to perifh by thrift, and hardfhip of lodging. The laft time it was my fortune to pafs through the Defarts, I came to that deteftable place upon this occafton, that meeting with a Courricr, who was come from Babylon, with two Arabians, whom he had in his Com pany, he gave us intelligence, that the Grand Seignor’s Forces, which had then newly taken Babylon, were upon their march back, in Kttle Deteachmencs, and that there was no queftion to be made, but they would feizte on our Camels and Baggage. Which advertifements oblig’d us to take our courfe more to the South, and to get further into the Delert, where we fpenc fixty and five days in eroding of it, to avoid meeting with thofe Forces. As for the Princes of Arabia, they have no great Journey to make, becaufe they are thq next neighbours to Mahomet's Sepulchre. A Miraculous The Mahumetans of Europe come to Aleppo, and there joyn the Caravan;and oftbelfn'^ of thofe 4 f^' ca o P a ^ s t0 Grand Cairo, and meet in the Defarts, with the fame i§ Ja/spurneJ. Caravan of Aleppo at eighteen days Journey from Medina, where there is a water, which goes by a Canal, quite to that City, all the way of thofe eight een days Journey. ’They have it by Tradition, That that water was found by their Prophet Mahomet, as he crofs’d the Defert with his Army, ready to dye for thirft, and that going to drink of it firft of any, there iffued a Voice to him out of the Water, which faid to him, Prophet, thou wilt find it bitter: That he made the Voice this Anfwer, Let us all drinl^of it, for l kpow it isfireet, and 1 would to God, that we could always find as good. That thereupon the Voice replying the fecond time. Prophet, Command, and 1 will follow thee : And that as foon as he had fpoken, the Water made a Canal under ground, and follow’d him quite to Medina. From Vamas, Hierufakm, and Cairo, they account forty days Journey to Medina, and it is at the two and twentieth day’s journey that they find that water. Tis part ly to fee that miraculous Water, which had been fweetned by the Prophet, that there goes into thofe places fo great a concourfe of People , of fo many different Nations, from all parts of the World ; in as much as there is no Mahumetan, let him be at ever fo great a diftance, and but tolerably in a condition of health, and fupply’d with the external accommodations of fortune, who does not think himfelt oblig’d to go once in his life to Mecha, in perfbn,or to fend fome other in his ftead. After the Pilgrims have continu’d certain days at Medina, they go to Gebel-Araffa, that is to fay, the place, where Adam found Eve, his Wife, five hundred years, after God had created her. It is a City in the Mountains, at the diftance of Two Dayes Journey from Medina, and at one from Emena, another City, which is half way be tween both. AfToon as the Pilgrims are come thither, all thofe who arefo well fuc- nifh’d, buy a Weather to make a Holocauft of it, and to diftribnte it amongft the poor, they being not allow’d to keep above two pounds of it, for themfelves. If they do not pun&amp;ually obferve that, and that fome difeovery fhould be made thereor, they are made incapable, ever after, while they live, of fhaving their Heads, or paring their Nails. , , From GebeLArajfa, they return to Medina, where they keep an account of the time, when the Caravan arrived there ; in regard that all the Pilgrims, who came by Land, are, as I faid elfewhere, mantain’d with fuftenance for the fpace of se venteen days; but they who came by Sea arefuftain’d, as long as they continue there, even though they fhould make it the place of their abode, as long as they live. FINIS.The Publijher mto the Reader. H E enfuing Narration Was put into my hands Five or Six Years ago, by a very Intelligent Worthy Perfon who long raided in the feme Family with our Author, and did allure me, that the Difcourle here publiflied, was written with his own hand, and prelented unto that Honourable Perfon who redeemed him out of Captivity. The Gentleman wn° bellowed rhele Papers upon me, will notberefpon- fible for the Truth of all therein contained ; but I having compared his Account of feveral Countries with that of Charm and other more Ancient and Modern Writers, have found them very Con- fonant unto each other, and therefore do charitably belive him no lefs Faithful in his Defcnption of thofe Countries and People concerning whom little hath been faid by any belides. By reafon of his long abfence from his Native Country, and dif-ufe of his Mother-Tongue, his ftyle was fo rough, odd, and unpleafant, that I was forced to make therein great Alterations both as to Method and Expreffion, yet keeping ftriftly unto his ienfe: I have alfo much abbreviated his Difcourle, many things being often repeated, and he having fluffed it with divers impertinencies which would have been void of all Mruflion and Delight. He would never own his true Name or Pedigree, for Reafons mentioned in his Paper, which I thought al together unneceflary to be rehearfed 5 that of Afiracan, wherewith he concludes his N AR RA T IV E, being fiaitious, and I fuppofe affumed, becaufe of his long Reudence m a City of that name, from which he made moft of his Excurfions And which with the Adjacent Country he hath above all others moft particularly de- icnbed, giving us the names of feveral Neighbouring Places and Rivers mentioned by noother Writer. I was highly pleafed with the Account he gives us of Czartfr- gorod^ which he ailo fbmetimes calls Seraicban and Serakbena $ the former of which is the Mufcovitijb , the latter the Tartarian Appellation^, and inrepretcd 3 both fignifie the Habitation of the Emperour ovCbamjt being formerly the Metropolis of a great Empire. As alio with his mention of a place on the Weft fide of the Volga, where he fayes Aflracan was formerly fituated.

The firft Nation (of whom I find any mention ) who made any fix'd habitation M r he e Qd artcrs Were the Cbazari, fo named by the Latines and Greekf, but by the ahmetansy Alcbozar^ and Gorjani.

Thefe Cazari were ' afro poffelTed of all that part of Tmica Cherfonefus which is plain and fit for feeding Cattle, they being addidted, after the manner of all other Scythian Nomad? ^ unto a Pafloral life 5 which Feninfula from them was untill the Famous Irruption of the Tartars in the Thirteenth Century, called Cajfaria, or Cbazaria, and afterwards more corruptly by the Genoefes^ Venetians^ and other Latines , Cazaria.^ I find mention ofthele Chazari or Chdzars in divers Terfian and Arabian Hiflorians^apd Geogra phers. Abulpharagius acquaints us with an Expedition they' made into Ferfia the 183 Year of the Hegira, which was after our Account in 799* From whence they returned with great Spoile, and above ipoooo Captives: and afterwards, in the 514^. Year of the Mahumetan Epocha, being A. C. 1120. they made another In road, accompanied by the Comanians, ) whom the Arabians call Kaphjacks ;) Frequent mention is made of them by that Defervedly Celebrated Arabian Geographer Al Edrift, who flouriftied in the 548^. year of the Hegira 5 of Chrift, 1153. He al ways calls the Cajpian Sea, Mare Chozar : and all that Countrey on the North and to the Weft of the Caffian Sea, terra Chozar. He acquaints us, that the Refidence of the Prince of Chozar was not far above the Mouth of the Volga, which the Tartars call Atheli which name I luppofe it derived from Attila, that Renowned King of the Harms, being fo called in the Relation of the Ambafladors who were lent by the Emperour Jujiine, unto the Great Chacan of the Turks refiding in the half. Al Edrifi and his Epitomizer, commonly known by the Name of Geograthus Nubkn- fs intimate, That thefe Chozars inhabited divers other Cities, but that this Was the Metropolis; he furprelles the Name, fly ling it only from the River, the City o{jthd», and declares it was divided by the River, the chief and greateft part being on the Weft-fide 5 and that the other lefs confiderable on the Eafl-lide, Was inhabited only by the meaner fort of People and Merchantspt being a place of great Trade,that which made it more confiderable, was the liberty allowed unto all of the Publick Profcfiion, and Exercife of their relpective Religious Perfwafions, Jem, Chrifiians, Mahmetans, and Idolaters being there equally countenanced, which I luppofe might occafion that Dialogue publifhed out of an Ancient Hebrew Manufcript, by V Empereur, between the Author a Jewe(h Rabbi, and the King of Chozar. This City is faid to have been extended along the River three miles in length, and its breadth proportionable; the Weftern part well fortified 5 adorned with the Emperours PaJace^and feveral other eminent Stru&amp;ures. Najfir Eddin, who wrote at the latter end of the 13th. Century, calls this City in his Geographical Tables, Balanjar, and from him Abulfeda 5 they place it in 46 degrees 30 minutes of Northern Latitude; where within 'fjx or eight mi nutes our beft Geographers feat Aflracan. And queftionlefs this was that City which our Author and Olearim call Old Aflracan. Thefe Chazari, did I fuppofe, conferve their vaft Dominion without any great Interruption, at leaft untile. C. 900. For Alferganus who lived about that Time, places no other Nation in his Table of Climes, between China and the Borifihenes ; And Eutichitts, who Worte about 3 ° or 4 ° y cars after, makes mention of them as a mighty Nation, and many amonft them con verted unto the Chriftian Belief. About the middle of the 10th Century thefe Cha zari gave place unto the Cumanians or Commanians s who were alfo a turhifh Nation known unto the Turkp, Ferfians, and Arabians, under the Name of Kaphjac^ whether they expelled the Chazari, or that the former becoming the more Eminent Tribe, gave Law and Name unto thefe latter (as hath fince frequently happened among the Tartars) I will not here undertake to determine: but this is certain, thatfuddenly the Name of Chazari was extindf, and all that Trad of Land from the- Nepper unto Turtylan 1 500 miles beyond the Volga, was inhabited by thefe Cumanians, who were often troublefome unto the Ruffes, Lithuanians, Hungarians, and other Neighbour-Na tions. But this People was almoft totally deftroyed by the Tartars in that great In undation which happened at the beginning of the 12th Century, loon after the death of Jingiz Chan ; whofe Son Hocota being chofen Empercur, fent his Nephew Ba nt, or Bathy, the Son of Tujfy Jingiz Chan, his Eldeft Son with 4000-00 Men, to in vade the Northern Parts of Afiz. 1 he Cumani for divers yearstvaiianty refilled, ana made the greatefl oppofition the Tartars met with in all their Conquefts; repuls’d them in two pitch’d Battels; but then growing fecure, and difperfing upon the!Z&gt;~ urs retreat, they were unexpededly furprized, the whole Countrey over-run, above 200000 killed, their King Kutlm hardly efcaping with 40000 into Hungary, whereThe Tuhlijher unto the Reader. he men with a kind reception 3 had land allotted him, and his Company 5 which Re gion is called Campus Cumanus unto this day. This Countrey was lb miierably wa fted by the Tartars that in the Years 1253, and 1254, when Ruhriqm palled through it, going unto and returning from his Ambaffage to Mangu Charts there was no fixed habitation^ excepting a few Cottages in the Illand where Afiracan is now fitu- aued. Blit Bathy having deftroyed the Comanians^ ruinated their Cities, and efiablilhed his own Dominion^ began to think of a fix’d aboade, which after long oblervation he diOi v r , on the Eaff-fide, and immediately beneath the River A5a~ hn, a great Arm of the Volga^ and the firft it difmifles, which empties it (elf into the Cajfian Sea ( having run a courfe of near 400 miles, and received feveral other Branches from the forefaid River ) about 7 Leagues Eaft off the main River. He had newly began this City at the return ol Rubriqm from his Embaffage unto Man gu Chans in the year 1246, and called Serai ; which City was enlarged and beau tified by all his Succeflors, unto the time of its deftru&amp;ion by Tamerlane, which was ' almofl 150 years. Bathy was fucceeded by Barcah, who was the jfirft profeffed Mahumetan Emperour ; he by Hocola, or Hob ay. Contemporary with Haytm the Ar- mnmjfjho hath in his Hiftory largely difeourfed concerning him: I fhould here men tion ail the other Emperours interceeding between Hocota and Tuchtamifcb ( who was difpoflefTed by Tamerlane ) together with their Adis, but that I haften unto that which rnoft immediately concerns our prefent Defign, and give forne account of this City, which (aslfaid) was fir ft named Serai, which interpreted figniftes only a Dwelling or Habitation 5 the beginning of it being a Palace* built for Bathy. You may fee what our T raveller fays concering it, Page 1 12. Befides him 1 find two Authors vyho make particular mention thereof; the firft is in the Hiftory of Arabfhiade, pub- lifkd by Golius. ^ This Author reprelents it as one of the greateft and moft populous Cities’ in the Univerfe, agrees with our Traveller in the fituation, only he calls that Branch which runs out of the Volga and pafles to the South-Eaft, Senck. The other is Michovius, who wrote his Hiftory of the Tartars in the year. 1515. He afhrms, Thar in his time there remained the mines of 300 Temples befides the Walls of the City, and feveral other Magmhcent Structures. The Tar ter s havefe- vera! times attempted to re-edifie it, but divifions amongft themfclves, Wars with tac Mufiovites, and attempts of the Cojfacks caufed them to retire unto places of greater fecurity. But becaufe little mention is made of this great Revolution by any European Writer I fhall here prefent the Reader with an account thereof out of the rooft Authentick Turfyjb, Arabian, and Perfian Writers. Eor Calcondilas is greatly mi- paten, w ^° teems to have received by his confident way of writing, moft particular formation, when as nothing can be more remote from the truth than what he af- Mms,yiz, That Tamerlane after feveral attempts, and two or three Battles was forced to retire, ^nd glad to fecure his Retreat by a Peace, he^ firft made with Tuckfha- nufeo, which was by both afterwards kept inviolable; which is contrary to the Re- p , 0 F ts much more Authentick Hiftorians. The (Origin, Progrefs, and Event of tills ^ was after the enfuing manner. Tamerlane being in cfTeft Prince, but in name only Courachan (the Greehy call it f l ^ a£: i s 3 Viceroy or General over all thole Countries which are comprehend- f etween the Oxus and Jaxartes, wherein Bochara, Samarkand, and teveral other arnous Cities were contained, extended his Conquefts towards' Batch and Chorafan, ? nc .

After a moft obftinate bloody fight, Tamerlane gained v Victor 7 ? yet neither abfolute, nor without great lols, but it was. fufficiem that he &gt; hadThe Publisher unto the Reader. had leaned his own Dominion. Alter this fucceis he did lor divers years attend other Conquefts, and having fubdued a great part of India, all Perfta, Media, Armenia, Jffyria Mefopotamia, Babylonia, and Syria, he refolved to requite the Invafion of Tk- Ciamijh: whereupon having drawn together an Army of 500000 men, he marched through Media Atropatia, then and hill called Shervan 5 palled the ?ort£ Caucafe^ which the Perfians name Verbent ; thence through Dabejlan, and the great Defart be tween that and Ajiracan (then named Gitturcban ) and having wafted all that fpacious Countrey on the Weft-lide of the Volga, depoulated and difmantled divers fair Ci- ties (the ruines of leveral being yet viftble to thofe who Navigate the Volga, as we are informed by Okarius ) he pafted the Volga, and on the Eaft-fide encoun- trcd Tdmttamifcb, who had Collected a mighty Force, having befidcs his own Hords, the affiftance of the Tartars of CaJJ'an, Tumen, Kalmuhe, and Vabejlan : and his Army by this acceffion was more numerous than that of his Enemy. The Battel was long doubtful, and exceeding all that happened in that Age for carnage and cruelty, both Parties being full of hatred unto their Adverfaries 5 and knowing that this Fight would lofe or gain thcm a mighty Empire. They fought three days with little in- termiflion, and it could not be difcerned which had the advantage. But that which is thought 3 chiefly to have occafioned Tamerlane’s Viffory, was the departure of a great Tribe from Tbudamifcb, whole Prince EBave pretended he had received feme great injury or affront, but Was indeed thought he was corrupted: For retreating unto Anmarth the Tmkt(b Emperour, he after the fame mannner betrayed Bajazet, who foon after fucceeded 3 revolting at the begining of the fight unto Tamerlane. ThuSa- tnifeb being defeated, with great difficulty made his efcape, leaving his Countrey ex- poftd unto the fury of the Zagataians, whom fo great a flaughter of their own Friends had highly exafperated. They fpared nothing that was capable of being fpoiled ; demolilhed Serai, together with Seraicbicb^ upon the Jaid^, and Gitturcban, which were the only confiderable Cities on the Eaft-fide of the Volga, and leaving the Countrey a meer Defart, killing, or Captivating the Inhabitants, driving away the Cattle, they returndinto Perfia with great Booty. This happened in the 791 year of the Hegira. A. C. 1388. Serai, and Saraicbicl^ never regained thir former fplen- dour ; but f Giiturcan now A(lracan ) did by degrees recover, but never arrived tothat heighth it attained unto during the Empire of the Cbazari and Zavolgenfian Tar tars. For J faphat Barbara, and Ambrofio Contarini, who were both Ambaftadors from the Venetians unto Ufm Cajfan Emperour of Perfia, and well acquainted with thofe Parts 3 Barbara living fixteen years at the City Tana on the mouth of the River Ta* nais 3 and Contarinibdng forced in his return iwmPerfia to reftde there fome months: They, I fay, both tell us, Thar this City before its deftru&amp;ion by Tamerlane, was a very famous Emporium ; all the Silks, moft of the Spices and other Commodities, which were afterwards brought down to Syria, were then carried by Shipping to Aflracan ( which they both name Citrachan ) and thence by Land in a few days to Ta na, whether the Venetians fent every year iixteen great Gallies. But after its fubver- fion by Tamerlane, this Commerce ceaied and the Gallies receiving their Lading in Syria, and at Alexandria of Mgypt. In the time of the forementioned Writers, which was from the year 1436. when Barbara firft went to Tana, until his return out of Per fa in 1488. And Contarini, who returned not long before him, Citrachan yfte a mean Town, confifting chiefly of Tartarian Huts and incompafled with a pitiful mud 'Wall, a place of no confiderable Traffick, only the Mufiovites fetch’d thence Fiih and Salt. But Juan Vaffilomcb having reduced it in the year 1554 under his Dominion, it hath been by iucceeding Emperours both fortified and enlarged: I ftali fay no more concerning it, Okarius a moft deligentand judicious Writer, having left us fo particular a Defcription thereof. I fhall only add, That I fuppofe the caufe 01 fo diffrent names, as Giftarcban, Citracban, and Aflracban, were occafioned by the Princs, who fuccemvely pnrftded, as is very obvious to any who are acquainted with the Cuftomes of the Arabians, Perfians, Turks, and other Eaftern People. But to return rinto otir Zavolgentian Tartars , fo called by the Neighbouring Slavonic^ Nations, becaufe the Seat of their Empire, and their ch iefeft places of Ke- ftdence were on 4 or near the Volga ( which River did alio almoft equally divide their Territory j Z,a being only an Expletive Particle, as I cowld manifeft by in-The Pnblijher unto the Reader. duilion of kvetal Ruffian, Pohjh, and Lithuanian Names of Men and Countries After the devaftation of their Countrey they would notwithftanding have foon re covered their former Grandeur, had not divifions and inteftine Wars long kept them low; and at length alter divers wonderful and great Revolutions given the Ruffes lealure firft to breath, and then invite them to deprive them of the belt part ot their Dominion.

And on the other fide the Crim Tartar alliftcd by the 7 W&lt;,, fubdued the remainder, whereby that Tribe Which before was comparatively inconfiderable, became Supreme, and is at this day a terror mr to all the North-Eaft Countries of Chriftendom. To fhew in what manner and by what degrees all this was tranfaffed, is rather matter of a juft Hiftory than of a Prelace the deatnm whereof I have already tranfgrefled, in making a Porch almoft as large as the main Building, to which itlhould ferve only for an Entrance. I ihall therefore conclude with fome fliort and flight Remarks on diver Paffages hi our Authois R.claiion. His 3 ,ccounc of the of the £##/«£ Sea , 3 (leaving out wnat he allows for the Teine Sea, or Pains Mxtti ) differs little in number of Miles from that of Jman 3 though they difagree fomewhat in particular diftances; and is wonder fully confonant to that calculation of Eratofthones^ Hecatzus^ Ptolomy^ and Ammianws MarcbdlinuS) who reckon it to amount unto 23000 Stadia, or 287? Miles which wamsbuc 15 of our Travellers Compittation. ° 3 He is alfo more particular, and /believe, more exacf than any I have hitherto met With, in his Ddcripcion of Crim or T’durka Cherfonefus ptthofe length and breadth he gives us in feveral places dire£tly,or by confequence* What he tells us concernining Arbot- {a and the great Field without it, fourrounded by the Sea he calls The Ratten Sea, is [carcely mentioned by any Modern Geographer,but wonderfully confon^nt to what is delivered by Strabo. Arbotha ieems to be Taphre, the Ratten Sea, he calls aa^etv or L ^ s Eutris , and affirms to be part of the Palos Mtotis : in compafs 4000 furlongs, with divers ocher particulars, confirming our Travellers Difcourfe, as may be read at large in his fevench Book. And I find in a Difcourfe publifhed by Mr. TWm concerning the Tartars, written lately by a Religious Miflionary who long rehded in thofe parts, a Defcription of this place very futable unto our Author. His Words are thefe, fpeaking of the moft remarkable places in Crm.

A frequent jnention v; made by Procopious, Jgathias, and others of the Bizantine Hiftorians, of that nut paffage between Georgia and Anadouk, or as they word it, between Cokhis and djm Minor, or Armenia, Our Author haying given an account of the Courfe of the Volga, and of the moff e markable places lying upon, or near it; at laft affures us, That it emptiesit felf in- '* ea only by 22 Mouths, whofe names he there rehearfes: whereas ner Writers aferibe unto it 70 Entrances, though as Olearius judicidufly obferves, or them a re rather paflages made by the Sea between Iflands and broken Ground, lan P^pcr dihindt A^rms or Branches of the forementioned Rivers. r , Wha c r 15 concerning the Coffacks retiring unto, and neffing in an Zfland of the is confirmed by a late French Writer, who long refided in Perfta, He (O) largely'The Pnhlijher unto the Reader. largely acquaints us with the great 1 'poil thefe Outlaws made on the Coaft of M e . fanderon, that they took Aflerahath one of the Emperours Royal Stats, and haying continued feveral days in pofleliion, retired with great Booty and little lofs. I could render Tome probable account of thofe Thieves our Writer calls Stgakes, of what Nation they are, when they began, and how they live; but (hall for brevity- fake wave this and divers other Remarks 5 and that I mjty manifeft how impartial my fentiments are in reference unto the Treatife I have here Pnblifhed, I fhall hrft ac knowledge,That 1 never met with any Writer who calls that Vaft Plain between the Rivers Bori{lbenes and Tanais the Defart of Ingel and Vngul, although I have feen di vers Journals both Antient and Modern, of Perl'ons who have frequently traverfed that vail: Region: and have read moft Hifiories, and perufed Geographical Books or Tables that relate unto the Tartars^ or _ their Countrey. Secondly, I muft declare my diftruft of his computation concerning the compafs of the Caflian Sea; which he makes lefs than in truth ids, asl could largely demonftrate ^though he hath pretty well falved the miftakc, by his allowance of a thoufand Miles for Bays, broken Ground and Promontories. Laftly, Our Author is greatly miftaken, when he affirms, There is no Nation of Tartars between thofe of Bockara and China •, whereas indeed feveral very Potent Kingdoms intervene. And yet he hath luckily Andahatorum wore, hit up on the Truth, where he allures us, there are no Catayans between the VshegTartart and China. For indeed there is at prefent no Catayne belides China^ which is fo called by all Tartars, Ferfians, Arabians^ and other Mahumetans^ as alfo by the Mufcovites and other Nations who travel thither by Land,either in theQuality of Amballadors,or Merchants. Though formerly there was a mighty People, either Turks or Tartars (they bingboth Originally the fame, as to Extraft, Language, Manners, Religion, and Government) who lay directly in the way between Perfia and China, and were certainly the Chat a of Ptolomy,but almoft extirpated by Jingiz C^«,whom they vigo- roully refilled.

Were it not for the formentioned great Rivers of the Vanavo ( Vanubius ) and the Nepper ( Boriftbenes) there would be aimofl: continual Wars between the 'turkg and Tartars, and the Poks^ Lithuanians and Mufcovites ; for the Vanaw is one of the greateft Rivers in the World, arifing in Vutcbland, whence it pafles through Hungary, Wallachy, and at the Town of Kelky falls into the Blacky Sea. It hath four Mouths or Entrances into the faid Sea, which the Turks call BohajJ'es, Boctegene Bobajfe, Ldreleijje Bohjfe, Sullena Bo baffe, and Kelley Bobajfe. It abounds with Fifh, as Sturgeon, Morone, and Sbevcrofa befides divers forts of imaller Fifh. The Neijlre is a River that comes from Lithuania, and runs into the Blacky Sea under Bealohorda. The Nepper comes from Lithuania and Rufsland, runs by Smolensk# and Kioviaxo the Tarrocks or Falls, thence to Ajlamgorode, and falls into the Bhc\ Sea at Oijhakovea. It abounds with many forts of good Fifh, and all along its Banks feed innumerable wild Beafts of divers kinds. The Town of Ajlamgorod hands upon the Nepper ; and in former times there dwelt in it two Bro- thers, Ingpl and Ungul, who fell firft at varience, which ended in cruel Wars, by rea- fon whereof the adjacent Countrey became, though otlierwifepleafant and fruitful, a very Wildernefs. And befides, the Coffack# increafingon both fides the Nepper and upon the Von, would never fince fuller that Countrey to be quietly poffeffed by thefe, or any other Hords of Tartars *, fo chat now it lieth wafte, being a vaft Delart 500 miles over, and 1000 miles long, from the fhallow Waters near Precop, unto the Coiintrey of Mufcovy. About 1625. the Grand Seignior fent an Army from Conjlanti- nopk to rebuild Aflamgmd, with Orders to inhabit the Countrey, and invite fuch there unto as would become fubje£t unto the Turkifh Government. But they who arrived, Ending the Town of great Compafs, built only a Caftle on the Bank of the Nepper, and left 300 Men in Garrifon. At the fame time Shaugary Prince of Crim, being beat out of his Countrey by his General Chan Timur Myrfa, retired unto the QJfackj upon the Nepper, and having Contra&amp;ed a Friendfhip with them and the bordering Ruffes, by their affiftance he gathered an Army of 40000 Men, and marched towards Cr/w, leaving behind him a revolted Ottoman, with a Brigade of 3 or 4000 Men, who im mediately after the departure of Sultan Shaugary, marched dircbfly towards Ajlamgo- rod, and early in a Morning furprized the Cable, then in the pofTeflion of the Turk#, put every Man in Garriionto the Sword, flighted the Walls and other Fortifica tions, retired with the Spoyl, and marched to joyn Sultan Shaugary, who in the interim arrived near Trecop, where he was met by Chan Timur, and totally defeated, but by good fortune efcaped, and by the way of Afiracan got to Terfia. From the Nepper we will pafs unto Crim, with which Countrey Jam well acquain ted, having againft my will refided there fome years. Crim is a fmall Land, fo near as l can conjecture 200 miles long, and 50 miles broad, but is wonderfully populous, and exceedingly fruitful,abounding with Corn and Grafs; the only fcarcity they have is Wood, which grows no where but upon the Sea-Coaft, from Bakjfey Seray unto the ToWn of Crim, which in former times was the chief City: All the reft of the Land is a Plain, where they have no Wood to burn, nor any fort of Fewel, but Fifjheke, Fufjhane, Cur ay, and Stroa. The Land isinclofed with the Sea, excepting at two places, Precop, and Arbotka. By Precop there is a narrow paflage,through which you may go to the Nepper, Lithuania, or Mufcovy, through the Defarts of Ingul and Vngul, and there is a Water comes from the Teine Sea, called the fhallow Water, and goeth along the Defart,until it comes to Precop, upon the Weft-fide of Crim and by North, where it turns back on the North-fide of Crim, and falls into Guellae Mare, commonly called the Ratten Sea. So that Crim is almoft furrounded with Water; for the Blacjy Sea is on the one fide, and the Ratten Sea on the other, which latter produces nothing but Salt, for it is fo fait, that no Fifh can live therein ; 1 have reafon to know it, becaufe 1 lived in a Village which was called Seemly Otta Mamutachy. The Towns round about Crim on the Sea-fide are thefe, Precop, Cujlorva, Crim, Caffd, Kerje and Arbotka ; and within the Land, Carafu, Ackynefh, Mejheite, and Bakeffy Seray* The Town of Arbotka lieth on the North-Eafl fide of Crim, between the Black and Ratten Seas, which there come fo near together, that there is no more Land between them, than that whereon, « &lt;fiSgrS&amp;)i&amp;a^ # - ufon the Euxine and Cafpian Seast wnercon the I own oiArbotka ibnds; and wichouf Arbotl&gt;a is a great Ficl miles long, incloied with Water, where the Tartars in Winter do keep their Herpels or Horieg, which Field goeth to the (hallow Waters, where Iran away from the Tartars. 1 ihall here take my leave ol Cnm, and pals unto the Little Nagoy, to AJ'Jhowa on the River Von, which runs down from Bealla OJ(barra, through the Country of Ruffia between Rvfia, and Lithuania, until it comes to Peilesboy, not far from the IVoka • tor irom Peilsbo) to the River Camtffbankg, is not above 20 miles, all level, which is cak \cdPeremlog, where the Coffackj do draw their Stfukes or Boats upon Wheels to the River ot Camujjhanh^, by which they pals into the Volga - whereupon this Place is cal led Ymwjiog. The Don runs down between the Little Nagoy and the Defarts of Ingel and Vngule, io to Ajjborva, nght under the Town, and there falls into the Tein Sea This River is full of Mi, efpecially Sturgeons-, well inhabited by Cojfach, for there are feidom iefs chan 1 good upon it, betides thole that go on Frecbootiner. There are alio 0 Gorodkees, or Ifrong Skonees, well manned, and with ffore of great Guns 1 ' they being in eondnualiear of the Turks and Tartars, and fometimes alfo of the Muf- covites. The Little Nagy, lies between the Tern and Cafiiafi Seas, the former on the Weft the latter on the Fair, Sbenejfan to South, and the Volga on the North 5 and there is never a Town in all this Countrey excepting A((hon&gt;a. It is inhabited by Tartars, who go altogether in Hords 5 their Prince in my Time was ofey Myrfa, whom the Tartars call alfo Sukan Vlugh, or the Great Prince. They fowe no Coin but Profs, whicii they lowe upon the Sea-hde up unto Affhovpa ^ and after lowing they depart with their Hords,and graze up and down the Defarts’to the Don. to Capbane, Sburpoha, Tedecul, Comma send Cun ay, to Maffhargorodoke, and to Shersaffen Land, under the Rivers Terigke, and Balke, and aimoft to Pettigor, and by the River oi Cupba, and back again unto the Blacky Sea. Thus they ramble all the Summer until their Hafveft be ripe, and their Profs gathered, and put into Yams under ground» after which they fettle from Afihowa, ail along the Sea-fide, amongff the Reeds’ and leave their Horfes to winter in the Delates. So I Hull leave the Little Nagoy and pafs unto Temerojfd in Shercaffen Land, which is 500 miles from Aflhowa. Now in all Circaffia are but two Towns, Temeroffa on the Blacky Sea, upon the Gulf that goeth from the Blacky Sea into the Tein Sea, right over againft Arbot\a. The other is Tumein, upon the Cafpian Sea, the diftance between them being j 100 miles *■ and all the reft of the inhabited Places are only Cubbacks made in the Woods, piled round with i imber. Their Houles are very high, in the midft whereof they make the Fire. Their Men are proper Men, very like the Irijh both for perfon and garb; jorthey go in Trowles, with^fhort Mantles, wear long Hair on both Tides of their Heads, with a fhorn Crown between. Their Women are very beautiful, and loving toStranget-s 5 for if a Stranger come unto their Houfes, their young Women and Maidens will look Lice in their Shirts, and all about them, the moft private parts n , 0C . ex 5 e Pft;d, and will allow them the liberty to examine and handle all parts of tneir Bodies befides their Breafts. The CircaJJians are excellent Horfemen, and very Couragious, but withal exceedingly ignorant and fuperftitious 5 for when thev Kill a Goat or Kid, they cut off the privy parts, and caft it againft a Wail, if it inck, they pray to it 5 if otherwife, they caft it away, and fpread the Skin upon stakes, place it in their Corn-fields, and worfhip it. They have no Writing among them, yet pretend to be good Chriftians. Do ftrangely bewail the Dead, making gieat Cryes, icratch their Hands and Faces, until they draw much Blood, knock rf ir Foreheads againft the ground, until Knobs arife bigger than Plums. The Men are notorious Thieves, ftealing from each other, and he thatfteals moftis ac cented the braveft Fellow. Their Countrey is very fruitful, abounding with moft ^rts or Grain; and they have ftore of excellent Grals. They have alio much nuic growing wild 5 many forts of Beafts, as Harts, Hinds, Kine, Eifftibrafs, Hogs And great Adders. 5 &gt; &gt; 3 a ^ era ^ e divers which I know ate Cubba, which runs from Pettigor, Ee- ‘ Land . and the ^ttle Nagoy, betwixt Termeroffa and Affhowa, 20 miles iVrK f into the Join Sea, and hath aCourfe of 500 miles- The next mb C lVer -i which comes out from Cabardy, and falls into the River of Te~ ^ 5 200 mites from its Source 5 which River of Terigk defcends from the Mountains between lO^ J h i 1 i I ! 1 r 17 f 1, yi li, I 1 iv n III SI Li '.l | 1 Ipf i I if' 1 /I ally 5 j |j lh |r:il md. idlq y I If ill |jf ‘j; jjii 1 : liils;':!

There is alio another River which they call Keefi arj which falls out of and 60 miles from Jumeine is received by the Caftan Sea. Having formerly mentioned Pettigor.l fhall give you fome Account thereof. Petti- gor being interpreted , is in Englifn, ) Hills. They are five very great and high Moun tains, diftant about 5C0 miles from the Blacky Sea, and 700 from the Caftan beyond Cabardy. I came thus to know them ; In the Year I&lt; 5 i 8 . 1 was fent with Shkdk s a Myrfa, from Ajiracan to the Little Na- goy 3 to feize upon Orrakf Myrfa 3 who being informed of our coming, fled up to Vetti- gor\ yet he made not fuch haft but we overtook him, and having fought, overcame him,'and took away his Hords, by which means I became acquainted with Pettigor. Neverthelefs there are higher Hills than Pettigor, as Sneefnagore in Cabardy, which is incredibly high, which is in Englifh, the Hill of SnoWj for upon that and Sbddgorc, which fignifies a wonderful high Hill, and overtops the former, and fo along for 100 miles, from Cabardy to Sboilobofe, prodigious quantities of Snow are lodged, which it’s thought were never diffolved fmee the Creation. I asked a Circafian, Whether ever any Man arrived at the top of Shadgore, which to me feemed much elevated above the reft 5 who anfwcred me, They had a Tradition among them, that for merly a Bobatteere, whofe Name was Uroda, attempted to climb it, and after two or three days hard labour, arrived not unto the middle 3 but after a few days, being better accommodated, he returned, with a refolution, if it were poffible, to fee the top, but was never afterwards heard of 5 and added, That it was to that day cuftomary for the Neighbouring Circaftans, at a certain leafon of the Year, with divers Ceremonies and great Lamentations to bewail his lofs. The next Country to Sbeercajfen Land is Abajfa, which is fituated between Cimjfia and Mingrellia, and the Inhabitants are a kind of Circajftans. Mingrellia is under the Dominion of the Turks, and lies on the Blac\ Sea. Of thefe two Countreys, I have no great knowledge, having only coaftcd them three or four times in Boats, when I was among the Coffacfy, where alfo we landed divers times, raking ftore of Kine and Sheep, but no Priibncrs, becaufe they affirmed themfelves to be Chriftians. They are a proper handfome People, but very poor, and notorious Thieves, for they fteal not only Goods, but even Women and Children from each other, and fell them unto the Turks and Tartars chiefly for Salt, which is there very fcarce. Next unto Mingrellia is Georgia, whofe Inhabitants are little better than the former, only they have a kind of Scripture 5 for they Worfhip Idols or Images, yet have Cloifters, and a fort of Monks, with fome'Priefts of the Greek Belief. I once landed in Georgia with an Army of 5000 Men, we marched up into the Countreyj until we came within a days journey of Demur Capon, or the Iron Gate, which is a narrow paffage between Georgia and Anatolia, with Rocks on each fide, and a ftrong Town built in the midft; We flayed ten days ravaging the Countrey; they told us, this Town and Caftle belonged to the King of Perfia, and there is no other paflage out of Georgia into Perfia but through it. The next Countrey unto Georgia is Anatolia, where our Travel ler refeded feveral Years, having been fold by the Precopenfian Tartars, unto a Turkifli Spahi, or Timariot } of which Countrey, and the Manners of the Inhabitants, he gives a large Defcription ’ But we being fuffcieintnly inforwedthereof by divers mtelligent Euro* peans, who dwelt long in thofe Parts, f jail with our Travellerpafson tothofe Countreys which are lefs known. But frjl we will take his Account of the Periplus of the Euxine or Black Sea. promnfm the Euxihc and Calpian 10 ' From Fetwara, which is at the head of the Strait or Gulf that enters the ildc^a. to Precop, is 700 miles 5 from thence to Caffa^ a noted City and Port in Crim 300 miles; to Ajfiowa 500 miles 5 to TemeroJJa 500 miles; to Mingrelia 400 miles; to irebezond.400 miles ; and from thence unto Conflaniinopte 1000 miles; in all 3800 miles- Thus milch I know of the B/^Sea, which I have three times coafted by Sea* and traced above half by Land 5 fo that now it is time to [peak concerning the Caftian Sea, and fhew all the Kingdoms and Countreys which lie upon it, beginning at Aftra* can, and proceeding thence EaftWards, until I return unto the fame City from the South. ' , , j f jjiracan is placed on a riflng ground, not fair from the mouth of the Volga, from which it is not diftant above 50 miles; it is in an Ifland on the Great Nagoy fide, made by the Kwer Volga,'and a branch thereof, having the Cafpidn Sea on the South. The Town or City is fccured by a ftrong Caftle, furnifhed with fiore of great Ordnance, and in the midfi: of the Cafile is a Koskade, which commands both Caftle, Town^ and the Fields round about for above a mile. The tartars Town is ad joy ning, placed near iipto Cntuma, which is a Kiver naturally derived from the Volga, or one of its many branches; lo that the Town is incompafted with Waters, having the main bo dy of the Volga on the Weft, and Cvttumd on the Laft. ; Now if you would know whence the Volga comes, I will acquaint you with what 1 have learned from the Muf- twites. Its utmoft Source is faid to be at the foot of a great Tree, whence it runs un to Jerijlave 1000 miles 5 whence it proceeds to Neifna 500 miles, and thence unto Cajfan 300 miles; from Cajfan to Samara 500 ; to Saraioft 350 miles; to Saraichend 350, and thence unto Aftracan 500 miles; from whence it is, as we faid before, unto the Cajpian Sea, 50miles; in all 3550 miles. The Volga is a wonderful great River, abounding with divers forts of great Fifh, as Sturgeon Bellottke , Severn^, Shetren, Sterleke, Scm, S off an. Sake, Soudake, Konnee, Sahlee, Ltfee, Wohla, tarane, and many others both great and fmall, which I cannot readily call unto remembrance, notwithftanding that I dwelt there ten years. The Volga en ters the Cafpian Sea by mouths, and upon each of them is an Oughfukg or Fifh-wear, for to take Sturgeon, every one of which Optgbfuk?s is called by the name of the Wa ter, as Soellova, Vertullee, B Jferigee and Txujlorva Upon the main fVolga.

They are made of Shigmas, or long Poles made fharp at one ehd, and beaten into the ground un der Water, and a pleiting made of Rods, fomwhat refmbling Ofier, after the man ner of our Matts, which are faftened to the Poles, and hinder the Fifti from palling up the River. And Houfes are built near the Wears for the Conveniency of the Filhers, 4°) 5°5 uiore or left, according unto thegreatnefs of the Water, or refort of Fifh, and twice evei'y day, ufually in the morning and evening, they fet about their Filhery. They imploy only long flender Poles with an Iron Hook or Cruke in the end baited, and do ordinarily take 400 every day in the fmailer, and 600 in the larger Streams. The Sturgeon they take is all lalced, excepting that wherewith they ferve the Town oiAftracan, where a whole fair Sturgeon may be bought for ten pence Englifh ; and When the great Caravan comes from Lujfia, it takes oft moft of their Fifh, which is conveyed into dives parts of Mufcovy ,huz chiefly unto the great. City of Mofco.They re turn alfowith great quantities of Caviar and Salt, there being not far from the Volga, on the Little Nagqy fide, greai Salt-pits,which yield an immenfe quantity of Salt, pre pared yearly by the heat of the Sun, without any further trouble, than taking it off thefuperfides of the Water where it daily kerns. . The Volga a little above _ Seraichcna, 500 miles from Ajlrachan, diftniffes a great branch named Act a bon, which palling through the Delart of the Great Ndgoy through enters the Cajptan Sea* The remainder of the Volga, after having parted with jcveral (mailer Branches, moft of which jayn with the forementioned River, divides the Link and Great Nagoy, paftes under the Town of Aftrachan, whence it proceeds Unto Kuflowa, on the South weft fide of Crofna Beggar, and then falls into the Cajpian.

Wherefote they who go in the Spring from Arftacban to fetch Wood, having cut it, make great Floats, which are lifted up when the River overflows, and guided each by a few Men, until they are brought unto Afiracban, or thofe Other places for which they are defigned. The moft remarkable Towns and Habitations upon the Volga, between Seraicbena and Adracban, (which are 500 miles diftant from each other) are Camena, Rotygom, Ofjhenofba, Chornoyar, Bor iffe, Offatalka 3 Foollotvoy , Collmakof Same, Cojfoyar, Crofnoyar, Najfonoyar, Satone, Tanatavy, Vaneelofka, Ferre Ouffbabg , Eillanfiekf , Eistyborro, Cruhfa, Buff an, Balfheeke, Tbollotongorod, Volga a, Goradocba, ( which Was old Aflracban J Sharing, Bogar, which is near Aftracbfi, belides many other Places, with whofe Names I have not charged my memory. We will now pais over the Volga through Aifrachan into the Great Nfgoy* The Grek Nagoy may be properly enough divided into /Hands and Continent; the former are made by the Volga, and ieveral Rivers which fall out of it, varioufly mix’d with each other,and are all at length emptied into the Caffian Sea* Thofe Rivers or Brances have their feveral Names; thofe which I remember are Cuttoma, Boulda, Mal- la, Gucllufa, Creevoantya, Bufane, Attabon and Bereft. The Kingdom of the Great Na goy is all plain and defert 5 1200 miles in length between Ajlracban and Semara ; 506 miles in breadth from the faid Ajlracban unto the River of the Teiky or Jaick There is no wood in all this Countrey, except what grows near the Rivers. It hath no Towns or fixed Habitation^, though it had formerly divers, and fome among them very confiderablc, as Czarofsgorod, or Czarofs Foliate, in Englifh, the Emperours Town, which formerly mull needs have been as its name imports,an Imperial or Ca pital City. I have often viewed it with admiration, and connot compute it to have been lefsdun 10 miles in Circuit 5 / have told fourfeore great eminent Buildings, which muff have been either Mofcbees, Fallaces, or Caravanjmes, and Tome of them 6 miles diffant from the other. The Mufcovites are of divers Opinions concerning its Deflation: Some fay it was ruined by the Coffacky ; but the Crjfackj, who are rea dy enough to brag of Atchievements, know nothing thereof, only that they have 1 often difpofleffed the Ruffes, when they endeavoured to rebuild part of it. For in deed the fituation is very excellent,having the Volga on one fide,and the Attabon on the other:The Countrey very beautiful, healthful and fertile; and yet notwithftahding all thefe encouragements, it is not yet inhabited, not by the Ruffes becaufe it (landing on the main Land, they would be continually expoied unto the Inroads of theT^r- tars ; nor by the bccaufe its nearnefs unto the Rivers, would render them ob noxious to the Ruffes, every time the great Caravan pafles that way, which is at leafl twice each year. Yet the Mufcovites do frequently fetch Brick and Stones from tlrs ruined City, wherewith they have built a great part of Aflracban, and the neighbour- in Forts or Towns, where fitch lolid Materials are imployed. But befides this Serai, ( for fo the Tartars call any fix’d Habitation ) there were in ancient times five or fix more down along the Rivers fide,in each of which formerly dwelt a Chan-, but Time and Wars have almofl: intirely ruined them. There is alfo another Sm**' upon the River Twk named Seraichika, where is faid formerly to have been theRdidence of a great Myrfa or Chan ; but ’tis now quite ruinated. The farters who inhabit the Great Nagoy, both Men and Women, are very proper, at leaftofmuch taller Stature than many other Tartars, but have ill-favoured Counte nances, broad Faces, flat little Noies, (mail Eyes funk in their Heads, all which are common to moft of the Eaflern Tartars. But the Tartars of Grim are more comely, which,! fuppofe,may partely proceed from their Wives,who are many of them Cap tive Circaff ans, Ruffes, Poles, Hmgars, and of divers other Nations. T^ie Nagoy Lar- tars are allb Black or rather Tav/ny; which I Conjecture is not fo much natural, as proceedingupon the Euxine and Caipian Seas. proceeding f rom the heat of the Sun, which is in thefe Parts fome Months of the Year much more exceltive than one would expeft from the Climate. And befidcs their Children go dark naked during the great heats in Summer, It is alfo re markable, That the Cold in Winter in the lame Country is exceeding fevere- and one would think to them who have fuch mean accommodation, intollerable Thefe mgey tartars have great flore of Cattle, as Kine, Sheep, Horfes and Camels and yet notwithftanding they are very ill clad, mod of their Cloathina bdng Sheen Skins, and thofc but fairvily dreffed.

If one Brother dye, the other takes all hi Wives! who are ulually five or fix. But if all the Brothers die,either in War or by Difeafe then they are devolved like otlier Goods or Chattels unto the Elder BrXr’s Son they never differing any married Woman, during life, to go out of the Kindred. ’ Here our Author hath inferted a Difcourfe concerning divers odd and fome barbarous Cuftoms which haw Jong prevailed among the Nagoy-Tartars, and wherewith they will not eafilyDiffence. ^ But they giving little light untoHijlory or Geography, I have not thought them worthy the trouble oftranferibing nor do I apprehend they would afford any confiderable infiruHion or divertifement unto the Reader. ,w u fe ° f , the Gre f when they remove their habitation, tranfport their Houfes from place to place in Waggons with four Wheels, which are drawn .dually by Camels; they pafsup and down the Country in great Hords, their ordinary march is fi om the Volga unto Buskstvjhafy ; thence to Voroflane, Semara, Eirgeeffe, Eithel rfff’ Remtpeska and all along under the Country, until they arrive at ne &gt;ckor teikf.

Thefe Swans after Midfummer every Year caft their Feathers, a little before which time there parts from Ajiracan many Boats which are manned by and moft of them are their Youth 5 after a paffage of hve hundred miles they arrive at thefe places which the Swans moftly haunt, and having filled their Boats with Swans Skins and Feathers, they return unto AJitocan, where a great Trade is driven with the Perfim who give ordinarily a Dollar apiece for rhefe Skins. The next Countrey unto the Great Nagoy towards the Eafl: is Caffachy Horda y which hath as I faid, on «the Weft the Jaic^ by which it is divided from the Great Nam- On the North the Kalmukes, North-Eaft the Turgeacb, or Jurgench- e tartars i and to the South the Cajfim Sea and Csragans y who inhabit on the North-Eaft-fide of the Cafpian Sea. Thefe Caff achy ‘Tartars march up and down the Country much after the mariner of the Nagoys. They have frequent Wars with the Kalmuk^s and Tumacbians i but feldome with either Nagoys ot Caragans. Only after the manner of moft other Tartars, they will clandeftinely fteal even from thofe Neighbours with whom they have the'nioft uninterrupted and profound Peace. Caffachy UvJa is altogether Defart, excepting iome Woods Northward, bordering upon the Kalmukss, where there are divers (mail Rivers which empty themfelyes into the Jaick^-, which River is alfo in moft places bordered with Woods unto its Entrance into the Cafpian Sea* And therefore the Inhabitants may well be named Caffachy Her da, or wild People, as the Name imports : They fow no fort of Corn, their chief Food being Horfe-fkfh and Mares milks which is alfo common to divers other Nations of the Tartars. On the North of Caffachy Her da dwell the Kalmuke Tartars, if fuch a life as they lead may be called dwelling. The Country they inhabit deferves a better People, the Land abounding with all things neceffary for a Comfortable fubfiftence. This Country hath ftore of Sables, Marterns, Black Foxes, Squerrils, and feveral other forts of Furs, which they Exchange with the Ruffes for Aqua-vitae, Mead,Tobacco, and other Commodities* This Country hath fome Towns, as Siberia, the Head of a Province of the fame Name, and Tmmm, both which the Ruffes have gained from them 2 Ouffba, Wadie, Seftona, Lucomoria^which latter place, they fay, is fituated upon a Cold Sea. But Onffha is a midland Town, 500 miles from Caffan wmch is near the Volga. The Kalrmkes are accounted good Souldiers, being kegc in con tinual Exercife by the Mufcovites on the one fide, the Nagoyans and Caffachy-Horda on the other. 'Lheir unmarried Women do not only accompany the Men unto the Wars, but are faid to be little inferiour unto the Men in Skill and Valour, ihooring almoft as ftrongly and dexteroufly as the men, from whom they cannot be diftinguifh’d by their Garb, being apparelled and riding much after the fame manner : Both Men and Women in all their Expeditions feldome carry along With them fewer than five or fix Horfes apiece. I cannot precifely determine what their Religion is, but I do perceive by Converfe with them, that they have a more favourable Opinion of the Chriftians than of the Mahumetans, or ofiome of their fellqw Ethnic}^-, for if I miftakc not, they are Heathens, I not tog able to difeern among them any Religious Worfhip, excepting fome kind of ration which they pay unto the Sun and Moori. They have a very peculiar Kind of Diet ; for behdes Horfe-ftefh, which is a great Dainty, they fcrnple not to eat Shakes, Adders, Foxes, and indeed even Carrion of divers forts of Creatures, iuen Food as to Europeans would be intollerable, even in the greateft Famine. They wear a kind of Caps or Hats which are called by the Mufcovites, Coulpackes, open £ and behind, with broad Brims on each fide. And thereupon they are called by me Other F a frW.ird— W 1 -- upon the Euxine and Caipian Sear. Eadwa^d from rhefe Cahnnh?^ inclining unto the South towards China ^ live the Jifegeacbians ? fo named from their chief Town, which Tome call Turgeach, others Juf- geneb: Of which Country I cannot fay fb much as concerning the former having never been therein but once 5 for in the Year 162.0. there being great Wars ni JmcZ a:b, between the Chan or King, and the Myrfa his Son; fome of the Nagoy tartars hearing thereof, i waded the Country, who whilft they Were united, durft not peep out of their own Borders, the Jmgeachians being a numerous and Warlike People Thefe Nagoys were all Volunteers, who went without any Command from their own Prince, or Allowance from the Mufcovites^ without whole confent by mutual Agree ment they are not permitted to War. The News of their Expedition being brought unto Ajiracan, the Voyvoad who had not long before made a League with the jWe- aebians, fent out Jllye ( I fuppoie his true Name was Ali or Halt ) Myrfa a ta ianan Prince, with a Thouland of his own Subjeds, and Five Hundred Ruffes, all Horfe. We were 20 days marching before we came to the Borders of Jurgeacb from Adracan * whence we proceeded 10 days journey, the Country through which we paded being niiferably ravaged by the aforefa id Nagoys. At the end of which 30 days by a reafo- liable Computation, ’ewas judged we were diftant from Aflracan at lead 1000 miles * about which time we overtook them in the Valley of Ougogura^ having got from the Jurgeacbians an innumerable company of Cattle of divers forts, as Horfe, Kine Camels and Sheep. We took all their Booty from them; and as a further punilkneut for their Riot, took away their own fupernumerary Horles,leaving them only a Horfe a Man for to convey them home. Then Ally Myrfa divided the Spoil, half he be llowed upon thofe who did accompany him, and fent the remainder for a Prefenn unto the Voyvod^ returning nothing unto the Jurgeachians^ becaufe they were taken from Thieves. In the mean while the Prince of Jurgeacb in a pitcht Battel over threw his Father, took him Pcifoner, put out both his Eyes, and caufed himfelf to be Crowned King. He had a younger Brother, whom fearing that in time he might occafion fome Infurredtion, he gave Command unto fome of his Creature? that they fhould ftrangle him, and bring his Head; But divers of the Nobles, by whole means he obtained the Soveraignty, gaining intelligence thereof, would nor permit bis Order to be put in execution; but feizingon the Child, fent him unto the Emperour of Mucfovy, with whom he remained when I was lafi at AjMtt m. But I muff return from the Jurgeacbians unto the Caragans, whom I have left be hind, and they do more immediately refer unto my promife, which was to give an Account of all the Nations and Countries incompaffing the Cafoan Sea. The Country of the Car'agans occupies moff of that vaff fpace, which interceeds between the River Yeikg and the Dominions of the Ousbtgs, or tartars of Boucbara and their Territory furrounds the North-Eaft corner of the Cajpjan Sea, proceeding Southwards unto the River Jaxartes • and fome Hords of the faid People do inhabit between the faid River and the O. us^ which divides the tartars of Bocbara and the Paragons, from the Perfians and the tartars of Balk. This Country of the Caragans is very defart and barren ; the People miferably Poor; their Houfes are Wretched Huts, thegreateff part under ground; they are very tawny and ill-favour’d; their Habitations are fcatter’d, fcarcely defervingthe Name of Villages: And they have . no Town, as I have been informed, befides Pmsflannes^ which isfituated on the South- jidc of the Juxartes, near the Caftan Sea; which whilft I dwelt in Afracan^ Was by jurpn'ze taken by the Coffac^ but they had little caufe to brag of their Vibfory, ending little booty therein; and the Caragans gathering together, beat them out With great lofs of Men, forcing them to retire into an Ifland two or three Leagues kom the Land, which they poflefs unto this day, no Nation being able, or elfe not caring to un-nefi: them, although tartars- Perfians- and Mufcovites- do continually lufter by their Depredations. i owards the Eaft and by South of die Caragans ^ dwell the tartars of Bocbara, who are by divers called Tushgs. The Country which they poffels is better warred, and ^ ore t b a n moftof the prececding, and there is great refort of Merchants from hu 3 ^ aitS llilt0 them, efpecially Perfians ^ Mufcovites, and feveral Nations of Indians^ as Moguls^ Boutans , with many others, whole Names I cannot recoiled.
