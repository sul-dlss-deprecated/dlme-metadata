The file continues with correspondence relating to the commencement of debt recovery proceedings in 1939 by merchant Abdul Kader Mohamed Abbas of Bombay, against several subjects of Dubai and Sharjah in 1939, and also a complaint from pearl merchant Khoja Ali Bin Abdullah about a burglary and theft committed at his house in Sharjah in 1947. The file ends with a letter from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca to the British Embassy, Jeddah in 1949, communicating the decision of the authorities in Mukalla, Aden Protectorate [Al Mukalla, Yemen] to dismiss the compensation claim made to the Saudi Arabian Government by nakhuda (captain) Hassan bin Ibrahim, a British subject of Kuwait, for losses incurred while piloting a Saudi Arabian cargo vessel between Muscat and Aden in 1947.The Arabic content of the file consists of copies in Arabic as well as English, of two lists compiled by the Residency Agent, Sharjah in 1938, showing all outstanding claims by British Indian merchants against subjects of the Rulers of Dubai and Sharjah.The file does not contain correspondence relating to the last set of case notes made in the file by the Political Agent in 1950 and 1951. These notes concern the arrangements to be made at the request of the Bahrain Government, for the cash sale of two launches lying off Dubai Creek, in settlement of a claim for financial compensation by a Bahrain subject.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Al Mukalla</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fraud</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><subject><topic>Theft</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
