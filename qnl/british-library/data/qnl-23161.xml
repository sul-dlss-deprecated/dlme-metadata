Formerly he drew one but on 7.2.25.it was withdrawn by orders of Sheikh Hamad as a punishment for the applicant having several times broken the orders of the Sheikh by keeping a rowdy house in Rafaa,playing on mtsical instruments etc and refusing to stop this when specially ordered to. Two allowances were cut owing to this affair.namely the above and one of Subah bin Bushar. The allowances were Rs.50/- each. I know of no reason whereby the applicant deserves State support. Your Sincerely, Adviser, Bahrein State, S. rfm(n&gt; After Compliments. I forward herewith a copy of a document received by me from my brother Shaikh T Abduliah. As it bears the signature o± Major Laly, I deem it necessary to send it ior }our information and your high decision on tne subject.

I have, therefore, requested His Excellency my honoured father to pay him the( Rs. )1500/- because he is father of all ana his money is enjoyed by all the relatives and the strangers. I pray to the Almighty God and hope to take the necessary action in order to regularize my income and expenditure within six months when I hope to be prepared and able to pay the Hs.lQOQ/- from myself and Rs.1000/- from His Excellency my father.

It would be much better if land is not sold outriijht to private persons in future, but jiven for a premium and annual rental instead# If land is always beinj sold there is an inclination for Government to part with it for invalid reasons without thinking of the future, and as the ]nnd in Bahrein is very limited it will soon all be given away.

In India and also KnjLand when land is compulsorily acquired for Government the current price is paid plus [ 15,i for compensation, unless the persons voluntarily agree to a price acceptable to Government. While on this subject I hope that the Bahrein Government will take steps to prevent any except fine and well built buildings being built along the tnnarna sea front, the two buildings that have been built so far are small and ugly and will not look Y/ell fraa the sea. It is as well to remember that strangers usually form their impressions of a place from their first si$it of it and all maritime cities strive to present as attractive a front as possible. 7. When the surveyors return in the autumn I suggest the registration of all title deeds issued b fprmer rulers slioulc be undertaken, and all persons failing to register them within three months from the date of a proclamation, should be debarred from claiming land b / means of ! in the Courts.
