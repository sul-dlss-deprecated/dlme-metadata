M* 032/34. 6th February,1934. Ifiy dear Laithwaite, In reply to your letter No« F.ft#344/34 dated 22na January 1934 dealing with the request from the Bahrein Petroleum Company to acquire or reserve land, since area JTo# 1 mentioned /' in the Company’s letter deted 21st March 1932 includes part of the land which the Admiralty intend $o acquire, we think that it is very undesirable that the Company’s request for the reservation of this land should be granted# Unless you think it possible not to make any direct reply to this request (which course seems in fact to have been followed in 1932) we will be prepared to agree with your proposal for aealin^ with it* The main requirement of the CompvUiy, however, appears at the moment to be the acquisition of the land on Sitra Island, tfe note that you take the view that they are not entitled as of ri lit to acquire lanu until tney have tu. en out the mining lease, and this bein so we should like to make as much play as possible with the concession involved in granting their request# We realise that the necessity for not delaying the commercial operations of the Company makes any attempt^ to strike a bargain something of a bluff; but we would suggest that for a first attempt, at any rate, the Company should be asked for a specific quid pro uo. Frpa the point of view of the Sheikh as well as H.M.Government, local refining seems to be the most important of our desiderata, ana we suggest therefore that some undertaking about this should be our objective# If a local refinery could be obtained the questions of producing oil to Admiralty specification ana of the ri t: ht of pre-emption could be left for subsequent ccnsiaerauion. I dm sending copies of this letter to Berner and 3tarilrg Yours sincerely, (Sd#) E# A* Seal* P#S* The foregoing remarks also dispose of the question raised in your letter P.Z.276/30 dated 20th January,1934. ^•G.Lai thwai te ,Ssq., India Office.(P .935/1934. PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, p.D.21, Part 7 Westminster, London, S.W.l. 8th February 1934 My dear Laithwaite / / With reference to your letter of January 22nd r a' regarding the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to be allowed to acquire land on Sitra Island it appears desirable to give the Company all the facilities we reasonably can to enable them to produce oil at an early date and not to afford them any excuse for delay in taking out the mining lease. It is understood that the land which it is proposed to allow the Company to take up on Sitra Island does not conflict with any of the proposals for the acquisition of land for the purposes of His Majesty^ Government, and that being so I entirely agree that the Company should be informed that they may be allowed to take up the two areas of land referred to in paragraph 8 of your letter as a special concession on the part of the Sheikh. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and Seal. I understand that you will make it clear to Ballantyne that we expect him to take note of this - another concession - when considering our proposed amendments to the mining lease.

An informal discussion took place at the India Office on. 15th February on the points outstanding with the Bahrein Petroleum Company. There were present:- Mr.Laithwaite India Office Mr. Starling Petroleum Department Mr.Warner Foreign Office Mr.S e al Adrairalt y 2. It was explained that the points in question were: (a) Local Refining. (b) The obtaining from the Company of ^ concession in respect of 'commercial exploitable quantities'. (c) The Company’s application to be permitted to acquire certain areas of land on Si tra Is land; and, fbr~th.e purposes of a camp , on the main island of Bahrein; 'and To reserve certain areas elsewhere. (d) The appointment of a permanent Chief Local Representative. 3. it had been generally felt that the first three questions could best be broached simultaneously with the Company. Mr.Starling said that the ad Tr ice of the Petroleum Department as t o the line to be taken on the question of commercial exploitable quantities was now on its way. The Department thought that the Sheikh’s interest could best be secured by a substantial increase in they( r oyaltuw- ^♦•'*~^0to*^4jpayable under the mining lease and that this would be the best solution of the difficulty. 4. Local Refining. Reference was made to the attitude previously adopted by Mr.Ballantyne when this question had been raised informally with him,2. D viz. that the Company would make no difficulty about establishing a ’’topping 1 ' plant sufficient for local requirements, but could not commit themselves on the general question of local refining, as their arrangements for marketing, etc., v;ere still entirely in the air. The position was, of course, different in Bahrein from that in K owe it and Q,atar since the Company’s hands were entirely free as regards refining. It was agreed that it would be best to put the matter to the C cm pany on the lines already discussed inder-departmentally, viz. that the Sheikh had always understood that the Company would refine locally, and for this reason no reference had been made to the point in the list of amendments desired in the mining lease which had been communicated to the Compamy: that it was however one of greax importance to him as affecting employment in his State etc., that in the light of Mr.Skinner’s recent intimation regarding it he had asked H.M.Cx. to raise the matter with them, and that we should now be glad to know what assurances the Company could give in the matter. It was hoped that it might be possible in this connection (Mr-.Ballantyne having in the past admitted that on general commercial grounds there was advantage in local refining if that was practicable) to lead the Conpany to give an assurance on the broad general lines of that which had been secured from the Koweit Oil Company, viz. that if and when conditions permitted they would be prepared to establish a local refinery in Bahrein and that discussion with Mr.Ballantyne should, if possible, aim at achieving this.5. Commercial exploitable quantity - It was agreed that the Petroleum Departments proposal should he canmunicated to the Company on receipt, for consideration with the other amendments desired in the mining lease which had already been communicated to them. 6. Acquisition of Land. of the India Office letter to the Petroleum Department of 22nd January, Ko.P.Z.344/34, and of the replies received from the Admiralty dated 6th v February, No.M/032/34 and from the Petroleum Department dated 8th February, No.P.D.21/27. After considerable discussion in the light of the views expressed in Colonel Fowle ! s telegrams of 11th February, No. 174 and 12th February, No 2, it w r as agreed that the line suggested by the Resident was the best one, that the Sheikh should be advised to allow the Company to acquire the land they desired on Sitra and the area, on the main Island for a permanent camp referred to in Bushire telegram 182 of 12th February, but as a concession and not as of right, and that all possible play should be-made in discussion with the Company with the fact that these represented further definite special concessions by the Sheikh which we expected the Company to take into consideration in considering our desiderata in respect of the mining lease. The meeting was on the whole of opinion on a review of the position as a v/hole that the question of refining could best be dealt with on the lines suggested in the paragraph 4 above. This question was discussed in the light y4. ^• Chief L ocal Representative. Reference was made to the recent discussion between Mr.Janson, Major Holmes’ and the Political Department of the India Office. While admittedly not overmuch reliance could be placed on the statements made by Maj or Holmes, especially in view of the fact that relations between the Standard Oil Company and the Itohrein m, 1 et^olenm C ompPiny were apparently at present strained, the India Office were inclined to feel that there might be something in his point that it was damaging to prestige to allow an American citizen to continue as Chief Local Representative, though it was of course arguable that any Chief Local Representative, whether British or American, would have to follow whatever line the Company desired him to follow in respect of e.g. oil concessions in Q,atar or the like. It was agreed, however, that the point should again be mentioned to Mr.Ballantyne, who was understood to have referred it to San Prancisco for a decision.

PETBOL.UM DEPARTMENT, (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, 21 Part 7. Millbank, o.W.l. 15th February, 1934. u My dear Laithwaite, ^ fj&lt;q With reference to your letters of November 24th, / -ef 1923, January 15th and January 20th, 1934, regarding the definition of 'commercially exploitable quantity of oil' in the Bahrein concession, I regret that pressure of other urgent business has prevented me from replying sooner. As you know, I wrote at some length on this question in my letter to you of the 16th November last. I then suggested that the only real safeguard to the Sheikh is the amount of the minimum royalty or annual dead rent he will receive. There are some precedents for determing what constitutes commercial production. There is a formula in the Hasa Concession, and there are others in which the erection of a refinery is made dependent on the production of a certain quantity of oil. In the Hasa Concession commercial production is defined as meaning when a well or wells has been completed 'capable of supplying not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil per day for a period of thirty days consecutively in conformity with the practice observed in first class oilfields•' This sounds fairly simple but, apart from the fact that this production would represent on an annual basis about 700,000 tons, a figure much in excess of what we should regard as commercial production', it might involve a somewhat elaborate and technical investigation to enable the/ . Laithwaite, Bsq., India Office,the lessor to establish his claim, if the operating company were not anxious to make the declaration. The carrying out of an investigation might indeed prove to be impracticable unless dorage accommodation of considerable size were available to take the production during the test period* Where a refinery has to be erected when a certain production is reached it is usual to calculate the production over a lengthy period of six or twelve months. Again, if circumstances were not favourable to the commercial production of oil, the operating company would naturally not produce. So that, while it might not be impracticable to put forward a formula, the setting down of such a formula would still leave us with the difficulty of establishing when the basis of the formula had been or could be complied with by the company. Under the original Agreement when the company had declared that oil had been found in commercial exploitable quantity the Sheikh was to receive Bs. 30,000 per annum as a minimum royalty in place of As. 10,000 - or three times the lower amount. The larger amount might not be payable \ for five years from the date of the mining lease, but at any [ time the Sheikh has the right to take the company to arbitration on this point. | As part of the bargain for an extension of time of the i prospecting lease the company have agreed that the Sheikh shall receive not less than Rs. 30,000 in respect of the year! 1934 and subsequently, but under Clause 5 of the Supplemental^! h f0 -.agreement of 21st November, 1933, it is stated that the c] L t% guarantee of such minimum payment does not constitute guaranteed minimum royalty under the mining lease or a v declaration of o81 in commercial quantities within the meaning of Articles IX. and X. of the Third Schedule to the original Concession Agreement (the mining lease). Prom this/(/ ‘c? this it might he inferred that, as the company is giving Rs.20,000 additional to what they were obliged to pay under the original Agreement, they might be prepared to add this amount to the Rs.30,000 payable when oil is declared to have been found in commercially exploitable quantity. If it does not mean this the position would be that the Sheikh would get nothing additional when the declaration of commercial production is made. We might , nt I ru r^ j —- T 11 ~ ~ ri‘^—| i nm |i nn B ** reasonably suggest to the company that such a position would be entirely contrary to what the original Agreement contemplated. We have been informed that the company are making arrangements to ship 700 tons a day as from July, 1934. This represents about an annual rate of 200,000 tons which we should certainly regard as production on a .. &gt; commercial scale. The royalties on such a basis would p. oUvj&gt;v 4 amount to Es.700,000 per annum, but there is no safeguard &lt;*v v £ Qr Sheikh that the company would continue production at such a level* In all the circumstances it would seem desirable to amend the mining lease by removing the provisions as to a declaration of commercial production and to provide that minimum annual payments should be made on the basis of, say, Rs.30,000 for the first two years, Es. 6^,000 for the next three years and Es. 100,000 thereafter# It will not be in the ihterests of the parties to have the possibility of the question of commercial production being raised at frequent intervals for a period of five years, and it will be more satisfactory to all concerned if this question can be got rid of at the beginning of the mining lease on the basis of minimum annual payments which would provide a not unreasonable safeguard for the bheikh and which the company could hardly claim are onerous. I suggest therefore that this should be the basis of our proposal to/to the company. If the Company pressed that the provisions as to declaration of commercial production should remain, we should have to fall back on the suggestion that according to the spirit of the original Agreement there should be a substantial increase in the annual minimum payment when the declaration was in fact made. I agree with the proposals contained in your letter , ( of January 20th as regards the representations to be made to the Company on the subject ol local refining.

In the circumstances I should be glad of sufucient notice to enable me to obtain that advice and to place the matter fully betore Lis Excellency ShaiJch Lamad. It is hardly possible to state any approximate length of time tnat would be required,as matters diner so much in the time necessary for their proper , p consideration. tT ?

If you see no objection to this reply,please telegraph the single word otherwise I will await instructions. 4. It would interest me very much to know on what date the matter was 'developed with the India Oftice in London': and I see considerable danger in proposals being initiated by the Company both here and in London,and especially in the Chief Local Representative’s innocent enquiry about t L0CaL t objections. b. I have confidentially asked the Officer-in-charge,Imperial and International Communications limited,and also the Officer Commanding,L.M.S Ormonde,to inform me at once should they detect the lank Ship El Segundo communicating with San Francisco,while at anchor m the harbour. I am not,however,sure whether their instruments will enable them to do this. It is suggested that it m might be useful to ask Karachi to arrange to listen/to see if they are communicating. 6. I should be grateful lor instructions whether I am to take any action in the event of the 'El Segundo' communicating with San Francisco while at anchor in the harbour. It seems,however, that it would be comparatively simple for her to move outside the three mile limit,though^ this would be a plain evasion of the rights of the Bahrain government and would,I think,justily a strong protest. 7. In this connection I fear that a precedent is establishing itself of the Company merely proceeding with any project that they have on hand whule waiting for Lis Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s reply. The present case seems to be an admirable opportunity for breaking this precedent by refusing to allow the use of high powered wireless until the matter has been properly considered,because the Company have means of communicating with San Francisco through the Imperial and International Communications Limited almost,if(j^&gt; 3. not quite,as speedy as through the 'al Segundo'. It is,therefore, not possible for them to accuse us (as it would in most cases) of having hindered the progress of the work by refusal to allow them to use their wireless while the matter was being considered. 8. &amp;ay I add to my reply proposed in paragraph 3 above,a paragraph stating that use should not be made of the Tank bhip T s wireless for communicating with San Francisco till the matter has been considered and they have received from me the reply of His Excellency bhaikh Hamad bin f Isa a 1 Khalifah. If I may add this paragraph,please telegraph the word 'AEDITiGN' (as well as 'niGHi')• If this is to be done I venture to think that the communication to the Chief Local representative should be made at once betore they have settled down to using their wireless. rieut-Colonel, Political Agent,Bahrain.No, P*-17 February 22 , 1934, His Britannic mjeety'a political Agent Bahrein Dear Sir: Please refer to your letter No. C/125-10/1.VII dated yebruary 21, 1934. 1 am very much afraid that you hare misread my letter No.PA-15 in which l asked if there is any LOCAL objection to the SS *El segundo' communicating directly with San Francisco while she is lying at anchor, three miles east of Sitra Island.

Sir, I have the honour to request that you will inform me whether in your opinion payments of Royalties to the Bahrain government under the oil concession are to be made annually or half- yearly. The references to these payments in the wording of the concession appear to be some what contradictory. 2. In Article IX-B of the Indenture dated 15th February in which the original No. 9 clause is revised it is stated that rt the Company shall at its own expense within three calendar months at the end of each calendar year deliver to the Shaikh an abstract of such accounts for such year and a statement of the amount of Royalty due tothe Shaikh for such year.” It does not specify when the Royalty shall be due to be paid. 3. In the Mining Lease however it is clearly stated in Article 8 that Royalty shall be paid half yearly. 4. The Company proposes to start produc ing next July. Am I correct in assuming that any Royalty on oil produced between July and December 31st. would be payable at the end of the half year ending Deer. 31st. 1934, or would it not become payable until 15 months from the time when the oil was produced? 5. When considering the Budget and the financial position of the State for 1352 it would assist me considerably if I could be afforded definite information on this point.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No:1101/30 daxed the 25th February 1934 (11th Phil ^a f adh 1352),in which you ask my opinion regarding the times at which the payment of Royalties on oil (should oil be produced) become payable to the Bahrain Government by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 2. If and when The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited enter upon the Mining Lease, the payment would seem to taice place half- yearly under the provisions of Article VIII of the Third Schedule (Mining Lease) attached to the Concession Agreement dated the 2nd Lecember 1925. 3. The Company have not yet,however,entered upon the Mining Lease and the time of payment would,therefore,appear to be governed by Articles IX,IX-A and IX-B of the Second Schedule attached to the Concession Agreement dated the 2nd December 1925. give the Company up to three calendar months after the end of 1934 within which to deliver to His lUcellency ShaiKh Hamad bin ? Isa Al Khalifah a statement of the amount of Royalty due to him The practical effect of Article IX-B appears to be to for the year: and it may be inferred,though it is not definitely /statedstated,timt tne payment would then be made as soon as His Excellency Sbaiicii Hamad bin ’Isa Al Kbalilab. had accepted the accuracy of tne accounts. 4. There seems,however,to be some room for doubt as to the times at which payments become due,as Article IX of the Second Schedule states that the Company have the right to win ' further quantities of oil on payment of a royalty of Rs.3/8/- a ton....”,and Article V of the ”Supplementary Agreement of 31st November 1933” seems to contemplate a partial, if not a full,settlement not later than one month after the end of 1934. I am,therefore,referring the matter to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,but in the meantime would suggest that,for purposes of framing the budget,the cautious interpretation given in the third paragraph above might be followed pending the receipt of advice on the subject.

I had askea Mr. BaUantyne to call to discuss various outstanding points in connection with the operations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. ( L ) Local pefining . I explained that both H*il»IK and the Sheikh had assumed in the past that the Company intended to refine locally and the point had not therefore been included in our list of amendments desired in the mining lease, Mr. Skinner’s letter of 17th December to ^fhe Political Agent had however made it clear that our assumption was incorrect and the sheikh had now made representations on the subject to H.M.Gr. and had asked that the matter should be taken up by them with the Company# 'The point was of great importance to him as affecting employment in his State, H.M.G. entirely agreed with the Sheikh’s point of view and I was instructed to enquire (this would be confirmed in writing) what assurance the Company could give in the matter. Mr. Ballantyne said that he did not think serious difficulty would arise over provision for the Ipoal. needs of the Sheikh and his people, and that, as he had previously mentioned, it was proposed to instal a topping plant. The question how far the Company could refine to meet local needs, working in competition with sales existing, was under active discussion direct between Mr. Skinner and San Francisco, As regards refining generally he thought t would be most/- 2 - most unlikely that the Company would be willing or prepared to give any undertaking. They had to find a market in which to sell any oil found, their marketing arrangements were still entirely in the air, the obligation was a serious one, and he thought it unlikely that any very early decision would be taken as to where they would in fact refine their products. Apart from this, a request that they should refine their whole output locally and, in effect, limit their export to refined products, would he thought go well beyond the practice of any oil Company * I said that while I did not dispute the existence of the difficulties to which he referred an explanation on these lines would not reassure the Sheikh, who obviously attached great importance to this point. It was definitely important to ease his mind about it. Could not the Company, even if they were not in a position for the reasons stated finally to commit themselves immediately, give the Sheikh an undertaking that they would refine, if not the whole, at any rate a substantial proportion, of the oil won by them loeally once conditions permitted? Mr. Ballantyne replied that an undertaking even of this nature would have to be so hedged round with reservations that it would he thought be of little if any value from the point of view of the Sheikh. After further discussion I suggested that he should at any rate bear this possibility in mind as it afforded a possible means of reassuring the Sheikh while safeguarding the position of the Company. He said that he had taken note of it, but would much prefer that it should not be put as a specific proposal to the Company and that our letter to him on the subject should m general terms, and, he trusted, not too categorical, at a later stage in the interview he rather hin.ed that he felt/- 3 ~ felt that sane concession by the Company would probably be nece -sary under this head* (2) Thft Chief Local Heo resent at ive. o Mr. Ballantyne in reply to an enquiry said that he hoped to be in a position to let us have the Company’s proposals on the question of the permanent filling of this post by the end of the month* He again reverted to the suggestion which had been touched on in the past of employing Mr. Belgrave in this capacity and said that while he clearly understood that it would be unsatisfactory from our point of view that Mr. Belgrave should double the appointments of Chief Local Representative and Financial Adviser, he had not been quite clear whether we should equally see objection if he was transferred wholly to the Company’s service. I said that difficulties of principle sometimes arose over transfer of a Civil Servant who had been employed on work of a certain character to the service of a commercial interest with which he had been dealing in his official capacity, but without entering into to them I would merely say that Mr. Be]grave would be a very serious loss to us in Bahrein if for any reason he decided to leave the Sheikh’s service. Mr. Ballantyne said that he appreciated the position. He went on to say that while it was no business of the Company’s, he felt that if we wanted to keep people like Mr. Belgrave the question of their remuneration might be material. (3) The crew .f the 'El SegunAQ. 1 1 . Mr. Ballantyne confirmed that not more than 2 or 3 of the crew would live on shore; the remainder would live on board. (4) Buoying arrangements . I read him Mr. Metcalfe’s demi-official telegram No. 339 dated 13th February (P.Z. 1050/34), stating that the Director of the R.I.M. had/had been asked to expedite the information required, and )*n ^ promised to confirm this in writing.

I mentioned this to Mr. Ballantyne as a suggestion. He took note of it and said th§ Company would be glad to think it over. Jiaa-al wireless by the 'U %*■' Ballantyne put L forward a proposal in the terms of paragraph 1 of Colonel ~.oc :'s telegram No, 114 of 19th February to the Political J-ssihent, (P.Z.1182/34) and asked that we should let the Company know as so.n as possible whether there would be any objection zo the 'Ej. Begunu.' communicating direct with Pan Francisco by wireless while lying at anchor 3 miles east of ; itra Island, and whether there would be any objection to other tank ships communicating with Pan Francisco while lying at anchor at Bahrein. I said that the matter would have uo be referred to the interested departments and that I coula not give him any information at this stage. _y.y.,L.';srci -,L P?'mfiRtit.Y,. I explained briefly to Mr * BeUantyne the position on the general lines of ■) Mr. 'tarling'b letter of 15th Februax?, Ho. P.D.21, Part 7, 1092/34), and said that in the circumstances we thought that it would be better not to endeavour to substitute as amended formula for the existing reference in the mining lease to 'commercial exploitable quantity' but ta remove those provisions and provide, in the interests of the Shaikh, that minimum annual payments should be made on the basis of, say, ■ I«. 30,000 far the first tw# years. Is.60,000 far the next three/three years, and Rs.100,000 thereafter. The Sheikh had, af course, the right t§ g§ ta arbitration if dissatisfied. But it would in our view be more satisfactory to all parties concerned to dispose of the question of commercial production at the beginning of the mining lease on the basis of minimum annual payments of this nature, which the Company could hardly claim were onerous and which would provide a not unreasonable safeguard for the Sheikh. Mr. Ballantyne expressed much concern at a proposal of this nature. He could see no justification for an increase in the payments to the Sheikh and felt that if the Sheikh could have more money merely by asking for it his demands would g# up well beyond Es.100,000. If the Company were to declare commercial exploitable quantity without delay that would surely, on the basis of the royalties, etc. specified in the mining lease go far to meet any reasonable demands on the part of the Sheikh. After considerable further discussion it was agreed that I should postpone writing to Mr. Ballantyne on this point until he had had an opportunity of talking the position over with the Company, when the question could again be discussed. I emphasised that it was one of real importance to the Sheikh, which he had brought up on several occasions and on which it was definitely important to satisfy him. We had informed him that the point was being raised by us and we could not leave him far long without an answer, Mr. Ballantyne repeated that he felt that an early declaration of commercial exploitable quantity was the real answer to the Sheikh’s difficulties, but that the point would be considered further. Acquisition of land on itra Island a nd, for the purp.8. *-—• fr'-rcr). » n tfr* nifin 9f Bahrein . Mr. Ballantyne was familiar with the position as regards Sitra, but had aot previously/- 6 ~ previously heard of the request for facilities for a camp. He agreed that the Company were not entitled to acquire land either on Sitra or for a camp until the mining lease had been taken out. He further agreed that if we were now to advise the Sheikh to grant them the facilities they aesired we should be making a special concession and we should be entitled to require the Company to take account of the concession in question in considering our mining lease desiderata. I said I would write to him to this effect. I did not raise the question of the right of the Company to reserve land. (9) Mining Lease desiderata . I asked Mr. Ballantyne the present position in regard to the desiderata which were communicated to the Company last November. These would, of course, now have to be supplemented by a reference to refining and commercial exploitable quantity. He said that they were under consideration at the moment by fan Francisco and that there would, he hoped, be not much further delay. He could tell me at once that our request for geological information would not be acceded to; (he gathered that it was not the practice of any oil company to disclose intimate geological information); but otherwise he thought we should have little reason for displeasure in the Company T s answer, though no doubt we might in fact be displeased.

Note o-f conversation with Mr, Ballantyne on Thursday . 1st ivarcTT Company desired to suggest the confirmation of Mr. skinner, the present temporary Chief Local ^Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, as the Chief Local Representative. 2. I said that I would report this for instructions. Mr. Skinner appeared to have established excellent relations personally, and the only point over which there might he difficulty was his nationality. Mr. Ballantyne said he appreciated this. He had always hoped that it would in due course he possible to find a young Englishman of the right type to understudy the post of Chief Local Representative and whom it might he possible, as the concession developed, to send out as Assistant or Deputy Fields Manager to Bahrein. We would appreciate in this connection that there was really very little for the Chief Local Representative to do, and that from the Company^ point of view there were marked advantages in finding him from among their actual working staff. confirmation of Mr. Skinner they would certainly welcome an arrangement of this nature. So far as I could judge about the doubling of the duties of Chief Local Representative with his ordinary duties by a suitable member of the local staff. Mr. Ballantyne called to intimate that the 3. I said that even if H.M.G. agreed to the there would be no difficulty as far as we were concerned(%) . a - 4. Reverting to the question of Mr. Skinner, I said, that I unaerstood that he was going on leave in April and asked what acting arrangements were contemplated hy the Company. Mr. Ballantyne said that Mr. Skinner was not, in fact, going on leave till July, hut would then prohahly he absent five or six months. The Company were proposing to recommend Mr. Davies, a geologist who had previously served in Bahrein, v/ho was, in their view, well suited for the acting appointment, and who was an American citizen. I said I thought serious difficulty was likely to arise if an American were suggested for the acting appointment, if H.M,G. were to approve the confirmation of Mr. Skinner it would, I thought, certainly he as a special case and in general they would regard it as desirable that the post of Chief Local Representative should he held hy a British subject. In these circumstances I hoped the Company would he able to make some alternative suggestion hy which the acting vacancy would he filled hy a British subject. 5* Mr\ Ballantyn^ said ho understood the position.

I also enclose ‘fcopy of a letter from 6 March ) their London representative giving particulars of the wireless set proposed to be used by the M E1 Segundo”. 2. The Company are still working under their prospecting licence and have not yet taken out a mining lease. They have no rights in respect of telegraph apparatus under their prospecting licence. Once they take out their mining lease (which, as matters stand, they will have to do not later than the beginning of January 1935) they will have ,T the right, but not the exclusive right, to construct, erect and operate telegraph apparatus of all kinds in any part of the territory under th e control of th e Sheikh so far as may be necessary for the purpose of their business'. Even assuming that the words 'telegraph apparatus of all kinds' cover wireless (a point to which I refer below) it will be seen that if their present application is approved while they are still operating under their prospecting T • licence/ k Jaeut .W. A.Duncan, F Ministry, Astral House, King sway, W.C.2.2 . licence, that approval would represent a special concession on our part which we should, of course, endeavour to turn to advantage in some other connection with the Company. 3. The points on which we should be grateful for your advice are the following:- (a) Are we correct in assuming that if and when tank ships operate wireless outside territorial waters no restrictions in respect of its operation can be imposed on them? (It would no doubt be possible, even if the transmission itself could not be objected to, to achieve the same purpose by refusing to permit such messages to be brought on shore, if it was desired to press tlie matter to this point. But prima facie this would appear rather an extreme course). _ The Air Ministry can perhaps advice us as to the general position in the matter? (b) In the event of their operating wireless within the territorial waters of any state, such as Bahrein, are we correct in assuming that they must obtain the permission of, and conform to any general regulations laid down by the State in question? It is relevant in this connection that Bahrein is not a party to any international wireless conventions or regulations. On the other hand, our general practice in the case of the Arab States of the Persian Guli is to advise the rulers concerned to conform (unless tnere is some special reason to the contrary) to the general practices embodied in such conventions as we have ourselves subscribed to. (c) Our Legal Adviser remarks that the Clause in the Bahrein concession 'seems to be intended to be confined -« to/4./ 3. 10 to opei at ions v/ithin the area, I do not know if there is anything in the preliminaries to the Agreement to show that ordinary telegraphy was what was then in view n . In the same connection he refers to the fact that the date of the original concession was December, 1925, and asks whether 'wireless telegraphy between Bahrein and San Francisco would have been possible at that time in the manner now contemplated. As against this we should no doubt be met with the suggestion that the terms of the mining lease must oe interpreted according to conditions existing at the date of signature'. On the lirst of Sir E. Pearson’s points we have nothing to show that the precise scope of the phrase 'telegraph apparatus' was considered closely, if at all, in the pieliminaries to the grant of the Concession, And the drafting of tne clause is so wide that prima facie it would appear difficult to confine it to ordinary telegraphy We should welcome your views on the Legal Adviser's second point. While we agree that the Company would probably use the counter argument which he suggests, it might make some difference to the handling of the case with them if we were in fact in a position to say that the use of wireless by them between San Francisco and Bahrein was something that was never contemplated at the date of the grant of the concession. (d) Would the Air Ministry see any objection to the c r ant of the present application (as a special concession)? Alternatively, what, if any restrictions do they consider should be attached to our approval of it? Would they see &lt;-~ny objection in tne event oi the ap&gt;plication oeing granted to the use of wavelengths 48 and 54 as well as 18, 24 and 36.4. As the Company are pressing for an early decision we should he grateful if the matter could he dealt with urgently. On receiving your viev/s we will refer the matter formally to the Communications Suh Committee of the C.I.D. In the meantime, I am sending a copy of the papers in the case to the Imperial and International Communications for information under the letter of which a copy is enclosed, I am also sending copies of this letter to Seal at the Admiralty, Phillips at the General Post Office, R e ndel at the Foreign Office, and Starling at the Petroleum Department.

Dear Captain Lawson, In continuation of previous correspondence, I write to say that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have now enquired whether there would he any objection to their tank ship i? El Segundo''' which is now at Bahrein and which is expected to remain there for some months, communicating direct with Scin Francisco bv wireless while lying at anchor three miles east of Sitra Island, and whether there would be any objection to other tank ships belonging to the Company communicating with Ban Francisco by wireless while lying at anchor at Bahrein.

I have now been directed by the Company to communicate to you its desire that Mr. Edward A. Skinner, who at present holds the post of Chief Local Representative in a temporary capacity, should do so in a permanent capacity. iue Company believes that Mr. Skinner is well liked and trusted locally in Bahrain and as he is the Company's Manager in charge of the operations in Bahrain, it is felt that there could be no one more suitable to receive the representations of the Local Authorities or to voice the needs of the Compctiiy. Would you be good enough to let me know, in due course, the views of His Majesty's Government on the Company's Proposal? Yours sincerely, (8d, ) H.h.

Ballantyne, . ^c ' I write with reference to our conversation on 20th February on the subject of the refining of oil by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, to say that, as I explained to you, both His Majesty’s Government ana the Sheikh of Bahrein had assumed in the past that the Bahrein Petroleum Company proposed go refine locally. This being so, no reference to refininF arrangements was made in my letter Ho.P.Z.7189/33 dated 11th ITov ember, 1933 , communi eating the amendments desired by the Sheildi in the Company’s mining lease. Mr. tw-Skinner’s communicction of 17th December to the Political -“•gent has, however, muae it clear that the assumption in question is mis i» a hen, although the Company might possibly consider the matter at a later Gate, and in consequence His Majesty T s Government have received strong representations from che Sueikh, to whom the point is one [»Ballantyne ,ES'i. , Bahrein Petroleum Co.,Ltd., 19, Moor ante, E.C.2. &gt;f//O C[r9 r 7) of much importance in connection with local employment and who has requested His Majesty's Government to tahe up the matter on his behalf with the Company. 2. I am ashed to say that we entirely share His Excellency's views in this matter and that while we recognise tnat the Company are under no specific obligation unuer the terms of their agreement to refine locally we should be glad, in view of the importance of the point to the Sheikh, to know what assurance they can give him in the matter. As 1 mentioned in the course of/conversation, His Excellency is interested not merely in the provision of refined products for the local needs of his Sheikhdom, but in the employment etc. which would result from the refining locally of a substantial proportion of the Company's output, and we trust that the Company will be able to reassure him in regard to it.

With Loch I have been going throu^i the various points raised, and the following are my comments. Local defining . I suppose that what the Company have in mind is that local refining will not oay them unless the Bahrain field is an extensive ofte. If they were to construct now a large and exoensi ve plant and the field afterwards turned out to he only a small one they might be put to considerable loss. However, perhaps, as Ballantyne hinted in the last sentence of oaragranh 1 of your note - P.Z. 1202/34, the Company may feel that some concession under this head is necessary. 3. Chief Local Representative . (a) With regard to Ballantyne’s proposal that '^1grave should double the parts of Chief Local Reoresenta- ve and Financial Adviser. Loch and I are of opinion that this is quite impossible. ballantyne’s tentative proposal that Felgrave should leave his services with the Bahrain Govormrnt and act as Chief Local BepreDentative for the Company, has also objections against it, amongst others that the Be brain ntate would lose the valuable services of a/ J * G *Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, LONDON.2 - a capable officer. If it were ever mooted seriously we could consider blocking the nuoointment by stating that ^elgrave qua Chief Local Representative would not be persona grata . (b) With regard to acting arrangements for Skinner when he goes on leave in ~uly. I understand that his leave may extend to a year* which is a long period, lallantyne's suggestion was that one Bavies, an American citizen, who is coming out to relieve Skinner, should act as Chief Local eprerentative. Put as you pointed out to Ballantyne, difficulties mi ht arise by an American citizen being suggested for the acting appointment, and that it would be better if the vacancy could be filled by a British subject. a/ ree with +ho suggestion you made that it would be better - 0 ’ Co ipp iy to say nothing for the moment about Bavies. Loch and I .ill * re if we can suggest some local British sx»hject as a possible alternative and we will also have a ‘ v ^ he arrives at Bahrain. Loch thinks (though he has not raised this point with him) that the ■ hai 'h might object to the appointment of an American, ■ 4 • Lrj'i.V’-Bj: -Qf lira in em ployef v by the Cor aanv. •och has in mind, firstly, that the Company should ♦rain loc 1 men to take the place of ’Iraqis and other non- it irh- subjects as skilled labour, foremen and so on; and, ’ ’ l t ire they r ight tpain a few local nen to fill non-tgg appointments on the analogy of the Anglo- ^trsian Oil Company Limited, Loch is keeping an eye on this aspect of the locrl oil question, and is asking Skinner, who/-3- already proyides a list of employes from time to time, to sufcnit a list regularly oner a &lt;iuarter* 5 * C&lt;^.eyci al.ly. explcitable ruanti tv . This is of course a most important point. I noted in a letter from Starling ( n o. 21 Part 7 dated 15th February 1934) that the Petroleum Department were unable to evolve any satisfactory formula, and thought that the best way to deal v.i th this problem would be to induce the Company tc raise the dead rent vhich would force them in their own interests to declare 'c.e.q.* rr °o 'n as possible, or alternatively, pending the declarati of c.e.q.^W'uld rnrure ft fairly large rental to the Shalldi.

For reasons of safety it will be desirable for hia to be in communication with Sitra during his trip to ship in small boat.

Dear Captain Edgell, h semi-official letter by Air Mail seems the best way of telling you about the situation here. The instructions for the work arrived a.m. Monday 1-th February, be lag in a mail received from F0V/2Y on her way from Bahrain to Hen jam, at a renaezvous off Nabiyu Tunb. I had left Hen jam the previous evening to carry on with the^ main survey and but for orders from the 3,N.O. that night to send the Doctor ashore to the A.P#0*C. oil field at Has Tarkun where there naa been an accident I should have been aown off Bu Musa landing a triangulation party ana so some way south of FOWEY'3 course. As it happened I coula not have received the instructions at a more opportune moment being complete with coal and having only one party ashore - that at Nabiyu Tunb, being landed when FOVvEY was sighted; further it was rather important to be back at Henjam about 1st March when our store ship arrived, a variety Oi. provisions being very low. Anyhow we were on our way to Bahrain by 1100 though a shamal springing up in the middle watch that night out of as complete a calm as coula be ana reaching force 7 with a beastly sea the next aay, prevented our arrival on the survey area till noon on Wednesday, 14th. Thenceforward all went well, a spell of fine calm weather lasting exactly long enough until completion of the sounding p.miThursday 22nd. Next day another strong shamal arrived but I was able to land from an anchorage off the entrance to Khor Kaliya and delivered the tracing to the B,P.G, The sounding done was rather more than the check lines and quite sufficient I think to say that the channel is clear for a ship drawing 32 feet, the presence of any undiscovered sudden shoals being unlikely from the even nature of the bottom which only varies 12 feet over most of the area. Messrs. Deacon, skinner and Nelson lunched with me at an anchorage in Bahrain harbour on Saturday 17th and from them I learnt of the proposed buoyage of which I had also happened to hear a few details from the S.N.O. our last week-end at Henjam, but before we knew of our job. Hearing that the N2ABCHU3 of Basrah port Authority would be laying the buoys in the near future and observing that the two outer positions were well out of sight of land I got the B.P.C. to construct two mark buoys which Captain Nelson met the ship with last Wednesday evening. He was taken out and transferred at tne outer end of the channel to the EL SEGUNDO who happened to arrive on the Tnursday. I then laid the two mark buoys accurately in positions for the outer buoys to be, my idea being that it seemed such a pity to lose such positions and that without sV c h mark buoys the NEAHCHU3, presumably on star sights, might be a mile or more out with the result th^t the tankers might ply quite a different channel to^that sounded.—. uncertain v.tiose is the responsibility for assigning tne imal positions for the buoys nor couia the help me yesterday. They said however that thev would send a blue print o^f my tracing by Air Mail to Hamilton, their representative in London, i£ the event of ciecision on buoy positions having to be trade there Meanwhile the s.N.O. being at Basrah I nave informed hin the Port X Authori + v f t ^ e + ™ a h k huoys and asked him to inform ^ . r ?^ Au tnori^y, so that tney may if they wi^h t^krp advantage of them.

The Government of Inaia have no Light Buoy or Light Float available from their reserve. 4. Three second hand second class conical shaped dumb buoys including moorings can also be supplied from the Port Directorate, Basra, and their approximate cost v\ould be £600. Lfooring for each buoy and swivel 15 fathoms one and a half inch long link chain one two ton sinker. 5. If the Light Tender makes a special trip for laying the four buoys tne approximate cost would be the hire of the Light Tender say for 10 days at £56 per day. She would take three or more days, depending on weather conditions, if buoys are laid during her ordinary routine cruise. 6 . The approximate annual cost of maintaining the four buoys including gas for Light Buoy would be £280. 7. If dumb buoys are purchased from Basra the work could be commenced without delay. In the case of buoys available at the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard, Bombay, it would take some time to start work. Tne exact period required is being ascertained from the Flag Officer Commanding and Director, Royal Indian ferine and will be communicated later. But in either case tne completion of the whole scheme would depend on the date of receipt of the Light Buoy. The issue of the above has been authorised. ( 3 d.) W.K.

W. 1 Ref •Wo •P.D.Sl.part 8 16th March, 1934. Dear Laithwaite, I have your letter of the 6th March in regard to the question of the Bahrein Government having some means of checking the quantities of oil shipped by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. connection with the measurement of oil shipped , it would appear that the Bahrein Government and the Political Agent are principally concerned with the measurement of the oil for royalty purposes under Clauses 2 and 3 of the Indenture of February 15th, .1933. The Agreement provides for the payment of a royalty of Hs.3.8.0 per ton 'of net crude oil got and saved (i.e. after deducting water and foreign substeances and oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations in the Sheikh’s territories)'. It is the usual practice for oil for royalty purposes to be measured at the field storage tanks, and this might not necessarily be the same as 'oil shipped'. In the case of Bahrein the producing wells are net far from the point of shipment, and unless and until the Company build a refinery the bulk of the crude oil produced must be shippod as such sooner or later. It seems necessary to make the Point clear, however, and I would suggest that the Company should be asked where and how it is proposed to measure the oil for royalty purposes funder the above mentioned Indenture ) and w here the measuring tanks are to be situated. There might, of course, be loss or leakage between the field storage tanks and point of shipment. Knowledge of the quantity of oil actually '• f&amp;ithwaito, Esq., • shipped/ Although the Political Agent asks for information in indie. Office, S.tf.lshipped would be necessary only for the purpose of trade or shipping returns. As re S ar( is the actual method of measurement, the procedure usually adopted is as follows:- ..-nen the storage tanks have been erected and are ready for use, it is necessary for their capacity to be accurately measured, and this is known as ^calibrating” the tank* The method adopted is to measure the circumference of the tank with a special steel tape about 400 feet long round each strake of the tank. You will realise that tnese tanks are made of steel plates rivitted together, the second strake or row of plates is rivetted outside the bottom strake, the third strake is rivetted inside the second strake, the fourth outside the third strake, and so on to the top. it is therefore necessary to measure every strake and to take the average of the whole number. This is done with the tank full of water. A calibration table is then worked out for every inch of the height of the tana. It may interest you to know that a tank 116 feet in diameter and 45 feet high would have a capacity of about 12,000 uons. To calibrate the tank, therefore, is not difficult although it is a tedious matter, and it ia necessa.ry to keep the tape absolutely level, when measuring th&lt;j circumference* This is usually done by a. number of men on the top of the tank who support the tape by hooks and strings. when it comes to a question of mcc.suring a quantity of oil in the tank, the procedure is to take dips (usually five in number) with a. specially marked rod in the centre of the tank and at four roughly equi-distant points round the/3. tile circumference. Tiie reason for dipping in several places is that fciie octtom of trie tank is lialle to sag in tiie middle wi on tile ■weigiit oi tiie oil. Tliese dips give tile height of tne oil in the tank and the quantity is then calculated from one calihration ta.ble» J^s the calibration table is based on a water content, it is necessary to know the specific gravity of the oil before the exact quantity can be computed. It is possible to ascertain the specific gravity of the oil by means of a hydrometer and a thermometer, but there is considerable risk of error by this means and a slight miscalculation may affect the result by a good many tons# ?hq Admiralty practice when loading at Abadan is to accept tne specij-ic gravity furnished by the Anglc-Persian Company^ Onemist corrected to 6C°p# it is then comparatively simple to check the out-turn of the oil at any temperature by adding or subtracting #004 for every l c p. All that the Admiralty do therefore, besides dipping the tank, is to take the temperature of the oil with a thermometer at the time of loading. With regard to the practical application of the above procedure to the circumstances at Bahrein, I think it may be taken for grante d tha t the oil company will, in their own interests, secure the accurate* calibration of the tanks and that the Sheikh can accept their figures. What he will need, therefore, will be someone capable of taking the temperature of the oil at the time of loading and also of dipping the tanks and calculating the quantity by means of the calibration tables. It will also be necessary for the Sheikh 1 s representative to be satisfied in regard to the specific gravity of the oil. In/4. In asking the Company how it is proposed to measure the oil for royalty purposes, it will he desirable to inquire particularly as to the means to be adopted 'to ascertain the specific gravity of the oil in order that the calibration tables founded on the water content of the tanks may be converted into terms of oil. On receipt of this information vie can have it scrutinised, and will then be in a position to make any suggestions that may be necessary with a view to safeguarding the Sheikh 1 s interests.

S. 1309/34 £1208/ 34 SECRET X am directed by the Postmaster General to advert to your letter, with enclosures, of the 9th of March concerning a request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company that its tank ship 11 El Segundo' should he permitted to communicate hy wireless telegraphy (short wave) with San Erancisco while lying a* anchor three miles east of Sitrah Island, and that other tank ships of the Company should be permitted to communicate similarly while at anchor at Bahrein. On the assumption that there are adequate facilities for the transmission of telegrams between Banrein and San Francisco available through the public wireless station at Bahrein operated by Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., it seems to the Postmaster General that it would oe difficult to justify, particularly in the present financial position of Imperial and International Communications Ltd., the establishment of what would, in effect, be a private telegraph service in competition with the Communications Company. That Company might reasonably consider that it was being deprived of traffic which it had legitimately expected to carry. The Postmaster General would certainly use all means in his power, should a similar situation arise in this country, to prevent the establishment of a wireless service from the United Kingdom to another country, through the medium of a.ship stationed/ Jkider Secretary of State, Political Department, INDIA OFFICE.2 . stationed outside territorial waters; and, if the Communications Company so desire, he thinks that His Majesty’s Government should oppose the Petroleum Company’s request 4 It is observed that in Mr. Laithwaite’s letter of the 7th oi March addressed to Plight Lieutenant Duncan, a copy of which was enclosed in your communication under reference, the question of the position under the International Telecommunicatlai Convention and Regulations was raised. On this matter I am to say that it is not clear that Article 3 of those Regulations, which is quoted by the Political Agent at Bahrein, requires a foreign ship to have a special licence from the Government of the country within whose territorial waters the ship may desire to work wireless telegraphy. The control of wireless working in territorial waters is, the Postmaster General understands, an attribute of sovereignty, and in the United Kingdom as regards foreign ships such control is applied by Statutory Regulations made by the Postmaster General under powers conferred by the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904. The Postmaster General is not informed as to the political status of the Bahrein Government; but he is of opinion that the sovereign power in that state can require foreign ships within the territorial waters of the state to conform to such regulations in regard to wireless working as it nay lay down and, therefore, that so far as the tank ships anchored at Bahrein are concerned, the Authority mentioned would be within its rights in forbidding those ships, if, as is assumed, they are within its territorial waters, to communicate with San Francisco either directly or through the medium/3. medium of another ship. It is gathered that 'El Segundo' would operate outside territorial waters; and as the ship is of foreign registry the Bahrein Government would have no right of control over it when outside Bahrein waters. The International Badiocommunicati. on Regulations permit, in paragraph 476, a ship on the high seas to transmit radiotelegrams direct to the country of destination under certain conditions which would he fulfilled in the case of 'El Segundo'. The retransmission by that ship of messages between Bahrein and San Francisco would be definitely contrary to a principle of the International Telegraph Regulations forbidding retransmission with the object of evading payment of through charges. The United States did not, however, sign these Regulations or the Additional Radiocommunication Regulations which apply them to ship radiotelegrams; and that Government could not therefore he required to prevent 'El Segundo', when on the high seas, from undertaking such retransmission. It could, however, in the Postmaster General’s opinion, offer no objection to the Bahrein Government taking steps to prevent the exchange of such messages between 'El Segundo' and places within Bahrein jurisdiction. The shore control of the messages should not be difficult, since it is presumed that all wireless communications between 'El Segundo' and either places in Bahrein-or ships at anchor in the port ’would be required to be sent through the Bahrein coast station. A requirement of this kind is in force in the United Kingdom. It is observed that the Company are working at present under a prospecting licence which confers no rights as regards wireless/4. wireless telegraphy, out that if it takes out its mining lease certain broad rights covering the construction, erection and operation of telegraph apparatus (which would apparently include wireless apparatus) become operative. In this connexion it is observed that the question hasbeen raised whether shortwave telegraphy between Bahrein and San Francisco would have been practicable in December 1925, the date of the original concession. On this point I am to say that, according to this Department's records the first commercial message was sent by short wave wireless telegraphy in October 1926; but it would be difficult to argue that the technical possibilities of short waves were not known in December 1925.

Dear Clarke, fou will iemeniber tnat the Imperial ConLaunications Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence took note at theii meeting of a4th January last of correspondence regarding the approval of an application which had been made bj the Bahrein Petroleum Company to be permitted to instal, subject to certain limitations, radio-telephone transmitters operating on a wavelength of 10 metres or less and equipped co radiate 3 watts or less power, for the purposes of the operation of their oil concession. (I.C.C.1529, 1532, 1533, and 1536). 2. Two further applications on which we should be glad of the advice of the Communications Committee have now been submitted by the Company in connection with their operations They are as follows:- (a) That their tankship 'El Segundo' and other tank ships belonging to the Company should be permittee f^er A.W. Clarke, B.N., t o/ Offimittee of Imperial Defence, 2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l.(W) 4) 2 . to communicate direct with San Francisco by wireless while lying at anchor at Bahrein. that the Company should be free to communicate by radio telephone with all ships (whether belonging to the Company or chartered by buyers) coming in to take away from Bahrein the products of the Company 7 s oil operations; and that the three mile limit imposed last January as a condition of the approval of the employment of radio telephones by the Company should be deleted I enclose copy of the correspondence noted in the from Pol.Agent Bahrain 19 Feb. 114 ) margin on these subjects set from Note of Conversation with Ballantyne, 20 February, from Pol.Resdt.

Imperial and International Communications, with whom the matter has been discussed state in their letter dated 23rd March that they are in a position to provide a satisfactory and adequate service which can be used by the Company for the purposes of such communications. I understand from Captain Lawson that the proposed new transmitter will be installed by the middle or the end of May: and that meanwhile the Company can provide a satisfactory service by relaying to Bushire. In these circumstances, subject to the views of the Communications Committee, we might I think, reply to the Company that as an adequate service operated by Imperial and International Communications is already available, we are unable to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to grant the concession desired. I may put on record on this point that in the course of recent informal conversation with Mr. Ballantyne and Mr. Hamilton of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, I gave them to understand that serious difficulty was likely to arise in acceding to the Company’s application on this point and that i they did not take this intimation too tragically. The second point dealt with in paragraph 2 above raises/ 5.4. raises two separate questions:= (a) the removal of the three mile limit; (b) an extension of the sanction given in January to cover not only ships belonging to the Bahrein Petroleum Company but snips chartered by buyers of the Company T s oil products. °* regards tne xirst of these points, it will be observed that Imperial and International Communications urge that we should not accede to the Company's application on the ground xhat approval of it would deprive Imperial and International Communications of their legitimate tiau-xic. I told Mr. Ballantyne informally that Imperial and International Communications had adopted this attitude, ht; replied that the Company were merely actuated by considerations of commercial convenience. It was most important for them to be able to communicate direct without delay with ships coming in, etc. Finance was not a consideration. If the difficulty with Imperial and International Communications was due to their apprehensions OI loss of revenue, would it not be possible for the Bahrain Petroleum Company to reach some arrangement with them/Q them under which a payment would he made to Imperial and I nt 0 2 lie.t i o na 1 u o iiimu ni c a l ion 3 by the 3 ahra i n Pe tr o le uni Company in respect oi messages despatched direct by them? I said that I was not in a position to offer any opinion mil3 } out i/iiat if iiis Majesty’s CoYernment found themselves obliged to return a negative answer to the Company’s application on this point they would, I thougnt, be very ready to consider any counter-uroposa! v/hion the Company' might wish to put up. Prima facie in tnese ciicunstances, subject to the views of the Communications Committee, the right course would appear uo be uo inform tne Company tnat this extension of the special pii\ilege granued to them in January could not be recommended to the Sheikh; to explain to them, either informally or officially, that the decision is consequent on the prejudicial effect which the concessior would have on the position of Imperial and International Communications (if the Communications Committee regard unis as tne only obstacle to granting it) and wait for them to put up a counter-proposal. As regards the second point referred to in paragraph 5 (b) aoove prima facie there seems no very strong/6 . strong objection (subject again to the views of the Communications Committee) to granting the Company, but again in terms as a special concession to which they are not entitled (they will not dispute this, I think) permission bo communicate with tankers entering Bahrein for the purpose of taking away the oil products of the Company, even though such tankers, etc. do not belong bo or are not chartered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I gather from informal conversation with Captain Lawson that the point is not one on which Imperial and Internationa.' Communications feel in a position to take a strong line. D# The Company are pressing for a very early reply and we should he grateful in these circumstances if the Communications Committee would be good enough to let us have their advice in the near future. If it would be of any assistance that this department should be represented at the discussion we should be glad to make the necessary arrangements. J.G.

' referred to# Subject »- Chief Local Representative for Bahrain Petroleum Company, Bahrain. . Reference correspondence ending with my telegram No.7/104 of to-day. I have disousEed the question with Shaikh. H e explained that he did not wish to create difficulties hut that unless there was sane distinct advantage either to His Da j est y s Government or to himself in having an American as Chief Local Representative he much preferred to imve a British subject. This is also the opinion of the rest of the A1 Xhalifah family including the Shaikh's brother, Shaikh Abdullah, tfio is 1he most able and influential of th family. P. -ihe Shaikh pointed out that the Agreement between him/ (Signature) S. 44. DCJt’P—1124S&amp;P—(M-1314)-4-8-32~12,000. ( Designation)- 2 - him arid the lahrain Petroleum CoinT5any stated that the Chief local Hepresentative should he a British subject, This is of course quite correct, ?hat is to ssy, if we want to appoint one ?2nglishraan instead of another as Chief Local Representative the matter lies between outselves and the Company, and the Shaikh has no say in the matter. If, however, we wish to appoint ar American instead of a Britidi subject, then the Shaikh’s permission should be obtained. In the case of Skinner the point did not arise in an acute form as he was only appointed as Acting, not permanent, Chief Local Representative vice Holmes, 3* There is no distinct advantage to be gained either from our point of view or that of the Shaikh in having an American. It is merely a convenience, that the Local fields Manager should be also Chief Local Represent ati ve. Both Loch and I are definitely of opinion that, while Skinner, from our point of view is acceptable as Chief Local Representative and Davies - whom we have now met - as Acting Chief Local Representative in Skinner’s place, it would be most impolitic to force an American on the Shaikh, arri would have an unfortunate effect on local public opinion. 5. One of the difficulties as to the Chief Local Representative is that it is by no means a whole-time job, and the only alternative would appear to be the appointment of a British subject in seme local fi im to fill/3- IT fill the poet* Both loch and I suggest that Russell, the Bahrain Itanager of The Mesonotapiia Persia Corporation (who are already landing Agents for the Bahrain Petroleum Company) nould he suitable. In 'Joint of fact Russell would he little more than a post office between the Fields Manager and the Political Agent, but the Political Agent could also whenever he thou $it fit discuss with the former. 6* I suggest that the position be explained to the Company. sd.

I have the honour to inform you that I am directed by His Excellency Shaikh H?mad to communicate with you on the suoject ot the nationality oi persons in the employment of tne Bahrain petroleum Company. His Excellency considers tnat the Company is not acting according to tne clause in the concession by which tney agreed to employ as many Bahrain subjects as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. 2. On 5-1-34 the Company provided the Bahrain Covernment with a list of employees which showed that e£ out of 316 employees only 133 were Bahrain subjects. This list refers to the permanent stall, hot to the occasional/ labourers who work on the roads. Of the 316 employees 32 only were British or British Indian subjects. His Excellency Shaixh Hamad would like to see more of his own subjects occupying permanent posts such as motor drivers, clerks, servants and semi-skilj.ed artisans so that in time some of them could rise to superior posts and he feels that it is possible for the Company to obtain such men from among nis own people. 3. Another matter has come to His Excellency T s notice whicn causes him some concern. He has remarked that the Company is employing many persons, foreigners as well as Bahrain suojects, wno are notoriously bad characters and who have in many cases served terms of imprisonment for criminal offences sucn as theft, offences against the liquor regulations, embezzlement etc. Loubtiess the Company is not aware of this fact.ID 2 . 4. According 1 to Article 5 of the Mining Lease as it is now worded, His Excellency will incur a certain responsibility for the protection of the Company f s property. For this reason it is inacvisaDle that the Company should employ person of notoriously oad character. It is in the interest of the company as well as in the interest of His Excellency that steps should be taken wnere possible to prevent malefactors from obtaining work with the Company. 5. I suggest tnat the Company should be asked wiien taking on any permanent employee in Bahrain to notify the Bahrain o-overnment first, ihe Banrain Government will then inform the Company whether the individual is a Bahrain subject and also whether he nas been convicted of a criminal offence.No. of 1352 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.

My Company assumes that His Excellency has not considered his request from the angle of the reduction of output resulting as a consequencepartly crude oil and partly refined products* This depends upon factors which cannot be controlled by any producing company 1 b r any given period upon &amp; Iven basis* To attempt to give any assurance that any particular proportion of the oil produced In Bahrain will be ref laid In Bahrein for azport abroad would bind my Company in the face of continually uncertain and changeable world-wide market conditions* to a fixed progrma which night well fatally hamper the Company in the disposal of its production* It would limit my Company’s freedom of action unnecessarily and Inadvisedly in a way which would seriously impair* if not destroy* the chances of a niecesaful enterprise* Upon the quantity of crude oil produced* depends the revenue* beyond the minim royalty revenue* to be derived by Hie xeelleney from the exploitation of his oilfields* It follows logically* therefore* that an assurance of the kind referred to could not be In the beet interests either of ills Excellency or of my Company* oreover* it la reasonable to suppose that the foregoing consid erations, affecting as they do the direct Interests of His yxeelleney* the subjects of His Exeslleney* and my Company* must have been borne In mind at the time the terms of the concession agreement were settled* to mas which* whilst referring to the powers of tike Company to refine oil* avoid sedulously any attempt to impose upon the lessee such a hampering res trie- ^ 1 1 , — 1 ‘ '' 11 t,mj —I M mi ..■I...- . _ T ,;— lll&gt; | |Tni i r , 1 ,..|— yn-n-rn—..'I .
