In continuation of correspondence ending with telegram No. 53, dated the 2 nd Oftoher 1914 from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, a copy of which was repeated to you under my telegram No. 158-C., dated the 5th instant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a des patch No. 19 of to-day’s date, with enclosures, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject of our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk. No. 19, dated Birjand, the 16th October 1914. From-MAJOR F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, To-Sir Walter B. Townley, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordi nary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. British claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk. With reference to correspondence ending with Your Excellency s telegram Nn 53 dated the 2nd October 1914, I have the honour to report that I have now come to the conclusion that only one course remains for us to follow in the matter of our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his father Hisam-ud-Dauleh. The last-named who had precipitately left Birjand on the 25th September returned on the 12th instant, having been urgently recalled by his brother Shal ^- ul-Mulk in connection with a proposal for the marrying of a wealthy lady member of the family to a protege of the Governor, who now holds the appointment of Inspector of the Sistan and Kain Forces. I have had many conversations with Shaukat-ul-Mulk on the subject of our claims. Both he and Hisam-ud-Dauleh have told me that Hashmat-nl-Mulk has instructed his father to compromise for the half of our demand, but even this sui cannot be paid in less than two years. Hisam-ud-Dauleh is almost in his dotage and cannotbe reasoned with. His intimates dare not advise him contrary to v ha they believe to be Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s wishes and views. The other day the old Amir told Shaukat-ul-Mulk that without his Mustaufi, Mirza Khurshid Khan, who as Your Excellency doubtless knows, has been in Tehran for many months past, he feels utterly at a loss for advice. Immediately after Hisam-ud-Dauleh’s recent return to Birjand and on Shaukat- ul-Mulk’s suggestion I wrote to the former a final and peremptory letter. His p y was much what I expected. I then also at the Governor s request wrote o the latter officially enclosing copies of the two letters. Translations of the three lette are enclosed for Your Excellency’s information. 11 u ^ • There is nothing for me to do now but to carry out my threat. Sahlabad is a large village, about 82 miles from Birjand. Firuzabad i® about 8 miles further south. Gib is a large village about 40 miles north-west of Sahlabad. I shall station a news-writer in Sahlabad and possibly ^ ^ I shall warn the cultivators that until f urther notice they must W ™ ; into the Consulate, and shall inform them that until our h ^ d ?“ ^Xlotection released they may consider themselves to be under British authority and t • Any satisfactory ofiers to purchase their tenancy holdings outright will be favourab 5 received. * I trust that these measures will meet with Your Excellency’s approval. For the present I do not anticipate any resistance or trouble from the oca inhabitants. Whether there will be any difficulty in preventing the people from paying their rents to the Amirs next spring remains to be seen. I shall do my best to collect whatever is due. India, Foreign Secretaf, No A'? w '&gt; d a te cl 19 NOV 1914 ITranslation of a letter, dated the 13th October 1914, from His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, to Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh, Birjand. I hear that you have returned from your tour through your estates. No doubt you have now decided which of them you will assign to the British Govern ment in payment of their claim against you for the looting of the caravan at Neh committed by Sarhaddis under the instigation of yourself and your son Hashmat- ul-Mulk, and for the other outrages against British property in Sistan during the days of your Government there. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has telegraphed to me that strict orders have been telegraphed to you by the Minister of the Interior to settle this matter. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has also informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he has ordered me to seize your properties by force if you make further delay. I therefore inform you that this matter must be entirely settled in four days. If any resistance is made by you to my seizing your properties, your son in Tehran as well as yourself will be ruined. Translation of a letter, dated the 14th October 1914, from Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh, Birjand, to His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. I have the honour to receive your letter. You have written that I had gone on a tour of my estates and have returned, it has been wrongly reported to you. I had gone for ‘ Ziarat ’ (pilgrimage) to the Mazar-i-Dehak. Re looting of the caravans at Neh which you have attributed to the insti gation of myself and Hashmat-ul-Mulk. God be praised. It is known to yourself that from 1322 (1904) to 1327 (1909), a period of five years, I have been at Tehran according to the orders of the Government, and Hashmat-ul-Mulk was a permanent Deputy Governor in Sistan appointed by the Government, and during this stay at Tehran I have not heard either from the Government or from the Sarhaddis that such goods have been looted at my instigation. With regard to your statement that the Minister of the Interior has telegraph ed strict orders to me to settle this matter, I have never received such a telegraphic order. The Telegraph Sartip is present and you may enquire. In the matter that you have written that His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he has ordered you that if I delay further you may seize my property by force, of course I have no power to oppose and am ready (obedient) to the Government orders. You may also per form your duty ; but the legal procedure is that the Hakumat in whose jurisdiction a theft occurs should pay for that. Besides none can oppose force. Assuredly, what might have occurred in the Sistan territory during my Hakumat and been done there by the Sarhaddis is known and ascertained, I am ready to pay for it. •Consulate Attach*. ® ef ” e m y departure for the Mazar, Sardar Muhammad* Hasan Khan came and said that you had said that I may give a landed property, in compensation for the stolen property, which may realize 6,000 Tomans per annum until the money is paid up and then you will release the property. In case this money must be paid 1 am ready to pay 6,000 Tomans of the first year by degrees up to the end of the year, but you may demand the balance from Hashmat-ul-Mulk or you may obtain permission for him to come here and settle about it with yourself or you may write to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to settle there with Hashmat-ul- Mulk about the balance. Translation of a letter, dated the 16th October 1914, from His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, to His Excellency the Governor of Sistan and Kain. I have the honour to address Your Excellency on the subject of the claim of the British Government against Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh, who was until recently Governor of Sistan, and his son Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk who was his father’s Deputy in Sistan.1— 3 As Your Excellency knows the British Legation claims the sum of Tomans 26,500 against thses two Amirs on account of losses suffered by British subjects at the hands of their relatives the Baluch raiders and through the mis-government of the district of Sistan. For many months the Amirs have been offering us payment of lesser sums up to half our claim which offers His Majesty’s Government cannot agree to. I have recently been ordered by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister to seize some of the properties owned by the two aforesaid Amirs sufficient to satisfy our claim. I therefore intend on my way down to Sistan next week to seize the villages of Sahlabad, Firuzabad and Gib, which are valued at 60,000 Tomans, and I believe will pay an annual income of about 6,000 Tomans. The revenue payable to the Persian Government will of course continue to be paid, and any charges incurred by me on the said properties will be added to the account against the Amirs. I shall use my judgment in selling any of the properties if I see a favourable oppor tunity, and eventually, as soonas our claim is liquidated in full, I will return what ever remain in my hands to the Amirs. I request Your Excellency kindly to see that no obstruction is placed in this proposed course. If a Mamur is sent with me, I shall be much obliged to you. It is hardly necessary to say that if Your Excellency had been able to recover for us the amount we demand directly from the two Amirs, this course which I only take in the last resort would not Have been necessitated. I am enclosing copies of recent correspondence which has passed between Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh and myself for Your Excellency’s information.(COPY).

I have confiscated eight hundred tomans worth of grain which I found and have turned out representative (of) Hissam. By good luck I also found eight miles from villages drove of one hundred breeding camels which may be worth three thousand tomans. These I am driving to Sistan. They all bear Hissam's brand and are acknowledged to bo his. Neighing ci grain was witnessed by special representative from Governor who was with me. I propose to seize 5 villages of Hashmat immediately on my arrival at Sistan. It is possible that the store-houses may contain several thousand tomans worth of grain. Co-operation and support of financial agent will be more useful m Sistan even than that of Governor and his opposition would be more harmful.

Much money has been lost by merchants and camel owners through compensation being withheld for two years. % recent experience proves that there are large stocks of grain in villages of the Amirs. These should be seized by revenue department and balance of our claim can be immediately satisfied by two or three villages being confiscated. There is not a Mfii left in old Amir. His attitude is simply 'I will give nothing, but help yourselves at will'. I guarantee that our full claims will be liquidated in less than 18 months if I am authorised to seize the five villages in Sistan indicated in my telegram No. 74. It is politically very desirable apart from our claims, that Hashmat should be deprived of his Sistan estates over which he only holds valuation tenancy rights, the land Being the property of the State. My advice is (l) let five villages be immediately confiscated by Sistan revenue department and all Amir's gram found therein handed over to us. (2) allow villages to be leased out to new farmers and let first year's contract money be paid over to us in advance. Balance of our claim(s) to be settled by an order to Shaokat for confiscation and sale of one or more villages in Kainat. If ordered by Tehran, he can, and will do this, readily. For Hissam's property at Awaz there are willing purchasers.

I have the honour to refer to my Despatch No. 14, dated the 11th July 1914, on the subject of the struggle between Mirza Ahmed Mu dir and Hissam-ud-Dauleh over the estate of the minor girl Iran Khanum. 9 On the 25th July last, the girl’s stepfather sent me a communication, through the Consulate Indian Attache, a copy of which I now enclose. My reply to it was that I did not see how I could help the man, and that my attempting to do so might only expedite a catastrophe. o Now I have received a petition from Baluch Khan, the said stepfather, translation of which I attach. He declares that he and his wife have been coerced into writing a certificate renouncing their claims against Hissam-ud-Hauleh. a Mirza Ahmed Mudir is just about to leave Birjand for Tehran. If Your Excellency can see your way to pursuing this case Babich Khan may be summoned to the Capital also. It rou Ex , 3 IP of this suggestion! I will call Baluch Khan to the Consulate, and wdl arrange tor h.s safe progress as far as Meshed. Report from Indian Attache to Consul, dated the 25th July 1914. Baluch Khan, son of Abdul Wahhab and nephew of the late Ali Asghar (Hissam’s late Nazar), came secretly to me last evening. He said that he feels that his life is in danger and he wants your protection aeainst the tyranny of Hissam-ud-Dauleh. He is at present Farash-Bashi of Hissam who mys him (together with his wife-Ali Asghar's widow) and on account also oT the mS daughter of Ali Asghar, deceased, per annum only 20 Tomans m c^h and gZrwars (Kaini) of wheat.

Copy of a petition from Baluch Khan to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, dated the 31st August 1914. I beg to state ti.iat you are aware of the aggressions of Amir Hissam-ud-Dauleh against the estates of the minor daughter of the late Ah Asghar Beg, Nazar, my uncle, and how he (Hissam) has usurped the Sarayan estates of the minor girl. A few days ago I|had stated to you through Sardar Mohammad Hassan Khan, but unfortunately I have not been honoured with a (favourable) reply. Ihe thing which has happened a few days ago and was necessary to be stated to you is this that Hissam-ud-Dauleh having comprehended that the British Lega tion, Tehran, had shown kindness regarding the stoppage of the minor girl’s reve nues, summoned me and the mother of the minor girl and demanded that we should give a f Razayat-Nameh ’ (deed of satisfaction) addressed to the British Legation to the effect that regarding the estates of the late Ali Asghar Beg we have nothing to say. Having no alternative I wrote down what he dictated and Haji Shaikh Mohammed Baqar, Gazari, also signed it. We could not disobey his order on account of the reasons I have stated to Mohammad Hassan Khan previously. He has sent that ‘ Razayat-Nameh ’ immediately to Tehran. I solicit your kindness to take necessary action re this so that the matter may not be doubtful (i.e., misunderstood) there. Our affairs depend on your kindness in every way and we have no protection and hope excepting in you. I don’t venture more and conclude with prayers for the Government.

A list of villages which are leased contracts and consequently will yield a fixed annual income of (10 £ ?) was demanded of him ty me. If he hands such over to WL Government for five years Government’s claims againso him and his son can he paid up in that time. I have failed to elicit a reply from him and he still declares that he is in correspondence with his son about the matter. Both the Vice-Consul and T observed that Shaokat manifests less desire to proceed to Sistan. This may partly be accounted for by his dis^l&amp;clination to leave his elder brother here. It is imperative in my opinion that the Governor should pay a visit to Sistan before (long ?). If you can arrange to have Hissam called to Tehran first it will be most beneficial. From there he can go to Kerbala. I am anxious to leave for Sistan before the 15th proximo and if we fail to secure properties before that date, it will be regrettable. It would at least make the old man more complaisant if a peremptory order were given to the Governor’s brother to expedite this settle ment arid to send Hissam to Tehran.

No. 10. His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate for Sistan and Kain, Birjand, 16th June 1914. The Military Forces of Sistan and Kain. Sir, At the request of His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk I have the honour to enclose for Your Excellency’s information a translation of the Despatch which has just been addressed by him to the Minister for War at Tehran, recommending certain modifications in the Army budget of this Province. His Excellency is anxious to receive Your Excellency’s support with the Cabinet, so that if possible an early and satisfactory reply may be communicated to him. In my humble opinion the recommendations are all quite sound and reasonable. I am happy to report that very satisfactory progress is being made in the recruitment and training of the new force. The men are all of suitable age and good physique, and they are being drilled assiduously. His Excellency himself may frequently be seen on the parade ground. The insufficiency of the subordinate officers’ pay is one of the worst flaws which it is proposed to rectify in the statement which accompanies the despatch. I wish that it may be found possible when the force is considered ready to take the field, to attach two or three European officers to it. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, F. B. PRIDEAUX. Major, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain. To • Sir Walter B. Townley, K.C.M.G, His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. Translation of a Despatch dated the 18th Rajah, the 23rd Jauza 1293 (13th June 1914), from His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk to the Minister for War, Tehran. I had solicjfed, telegraphically, sanction for certain alterations in the compo sition of the Kainat and Sistan army, and you had ordered me to send a report. 353FD2 I submit herewith a statement made, in several meetings, in consultation with the Military Instructors and Officers and the local Director of Revenue, and request orders for introducing this scale. I also request that the sanction for the introduc tion may be granted telegraphically, so that I may begin with the amendments more quickly. It is necessary for me to explain that in the budget approved by the War Ministry the officers have been found too few and it has not been possible to create a complete military organization, so that I am compelled to recommend these changes ; also, that the reasons for the changes may be thoroughly known, it is due to the following explanations and no alternative seems possible:— 1. The proposed decreasing of the number of sowars and increasing of the number of Jumbazes is due to the fact that all military operations of the Kainat army at are present towards Baluchistan ; between Kainat and Baluchistan, and-similarly between Sistan and Baluchistan, there is a hit (desert) and it is impossible for Sowars to traverse this road of long stages, and Jambazes are more useful, therefore this change has been effected for the present. After two years, when peace is established in Baluchistan, it will be possible to decrease the number of Jambazes and increase that of the Sowars. 2. The difference in the pays of the Sowars and the Jambazes of Kainat and Sistan is due to the variation in the dearness and rate of grain of these two places. (Note : In Kainat bread is 1 maund per Kran, barley 1 maund 10 seers per Kran and bhoosa 4 to 5 maunds per Kran. (A maund is the usual maund of Kain, equivalent to 360 miskals and a seer of it is made of 9 miskals. Every horse in Kainat lives upon 8 Tomans per month. 3. The increase in the men of the TopJchaneh (Artillery) is due to this, that, with the exception of the two old guns, which are unserviceable, there are five guns in Sistan which must be used when occasion requires and for five guns 70 men will be made to suffice only with great difficulty. 4. The increase in the number of artisans is due to the necessity for travel ling and transporting of the artillery, so that no detention and diffi culty may be felt on the march. 5. In the formation of every Karohan (corps) of the infantry we have to increase the number of petty officers because, whether on a journey or at headquarters, the presence of the petty officers is necessary for the resposibility of the rations and the sections. 3. Although, owing to the absence of means in this budget, the pay of the Sarbazes has not been increased and, owing to the meagreness in the number, it is not possible to decrease their number and to increase the pay of the others, yet it is required of the Ministry of War to discuss the question of the pay of the Sarbazes so that their livelihood may be comfortable and a possible one. As I have stated, the price of bread m Kainat is 360 n/iiskals (one Kain maund) per Kran. It can be seen from this dearness what a poor life a Sarbaz must lead. In addition to the expenditure proposed in the statement annexed to this report and to the expenditure on the stables for the artillery, the military hospital and the uniforms, which have been noted in the previous budget, an alloment for the expenditure mentioned below is also necessary; and if saving is to be contemplated m this petty expense the eye must be closed upon good management (i.e., qood management cannot be expected ):— v y A. Rent of two caravanserais, one for the Sarbaz-Khaneh and the other for the Sowars, in Birjand at 50 Tomans per mensem.

No. 12. H. B. M.’s Consulate for Sistan and Kain, Birjand, 27th June 1914. Hissam-ud-Daulali s interference with the estate of the late Ali Asghar. Sir, In Your Excellency’s telegram No. 20, dated the 6th May 1914, you desired me to enquire into the case of the estate of the late Ali Asghar Beg, and in my telegram No. 26, dated the 29th May 1914,1 reported that I had learnt that Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his father, in conjunction with the Governor of Tun, had misappropriated during the last three years at least 7,000 Tomans out of the monies which should have been paid to Mirza Ahmad, the minor’s guardian. I now enclose a Memorandum showing the position as far as I can learn it* I have asked His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk to give all the support he can to the Mudir towards recovering the revenues of the past three years, but as the properties in question are situated outside of Sistan and Kain, it seems to me that it is difficult for His Excellency to take effective action, other than arbitrarily realizing an equi valent of the amount misappropriated by his brother. There is no doubt that the Governor at Tun has connived at the forcible action of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. It may perhaps be possible for Your Excellency to get him called to account. In particular it is desirable that the revenue for the present and future seasons crops should not be paid to any one except the Mudir s nominee. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, To F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. Sir Walter B.

Ah abstract pedigree is given below of the Baba Kazimi family :— Babab Kazim some generations ago found ed a respectable family of land-owners in Birjand. Ali Akbar Khan of Tehran, an official in the Treasury, died in 1913. Kerbelai Asadullah, Baba Kazimi. Zohra Khanum, remarried Baluch Khan. =Ali Asgha^ died in 1910. Abdul Wahab. killed by Hashmat-ul- Mulk’s negro about 1898. Rubab=Hissam-ud- Haji Kuchak=Haji Mullah Daulah, Reza. d. a. [&gt;., was a sigheh wife. Iran Khanun, Baluch Khan, married his the defrauded aunt Zahra Khanum. Is in heiress. the employ of Hissam-ud- Daulah. whom he fears exceedingly. One daughter, married to a Birjand trader. Abdul Wahab and Ali Asghar, the sons of Kerbelai Asadullah, were both for many years in the employ of Hissam-ud-Daulah as Nazirs. The former looked after their master’s property in Sistan, while the latter managed the Kainat estates. Their sister was the favourite, though sigheh, wife of Hissam-ud-Daulah. She exercised a good deal of influence, presumably prompted by her brothers, over her husband in political affairs. She died childless a considerable time ago. Some reference to the death of Abdul Wahab, not absolutely accurate, is made on pages 376 and 377 of Major Sykes’ book ‘‘ Ten thousand miles in Persia At that time Mir Hasum Khan, now styled Hashmat-ul-Mulk, had been Deputy Governor of Sistan for some years and his father had decided to replace him by his half brother Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan. Abdul Wahab, the Nazir, was ordered to assist the latter in taking over charge. He was not the maternal uncle of Muham mad Reza Khan. Mir Hasum Khan employed a negro to murder the Nazir. The negro then fled to Birjand, where he commenced making arrangements to assassirate two other enemies of Mir Hasum. The latter’s uncle, the late Shaukat-ul-Mulk, caused the negro to be arrested, had him secretly conveyed away from Birjand and then put to death. Hissam-ud-Daulah, although regretting his Nazir’s death, assumed to his own benefit all the estate left by the deceased man, which was said to amount to 25,000 Tomans ; at the same time he took the heir, Baluch Khan, into his employ. Ali Asghar, the other Nazir, died in 1910 leaving only an infant daughter. His widow, who is the daughter of an influential Tehran!, was quickly married to her late husband’s nephew Baluch Khan. The latter appears to be a helpless cipher in Hissam-ud-Daulah’s hands, for he has not even dared to claim the legacy left him by his aunt Rubab, late wife of his master. The infant s relations in Tehran, however, had some influence, and the maternal grandfather, Ali Akbar Khan, got himself formally nominated as guardian of thechild after which he came down to Birjand early in 1911 and spent some months attempting to recover the management of the estate which Hissam-ud-Daulah had assumed. Before returning to Tehran, he appointed Mirza Ahmad, Mudir of the Shaukatiya School at Birjand, his agent in charge of the child’s inheritance. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan died at Tehran in 1913. His widow, however, surviveSi She submitted a petition to His Majesty’s Legation in October 1913. After the death of Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, the Mullahs in Tehran formally appointed Mirza Ahmad guardian. I The deceased Ali Asghar left estates in Birjand, Tun town, Tun district and Gunabad. His estate was estimated to be worth 30,000 Tomans. Mirza Ahmad, Mudir, who is a protege of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, succeeded temporarily in recovering possession of all the landed estates in 1911, but found that Hissam-ud-Daulah and his son Hashmat-ul-Mulk had disposed of all the live stock-mules and camels—and some property in Birjand, including water rights, for 1,500 Tomans. Soon afterwards Mirza Ahmad was sent to Tehran on Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s business. Thereupon, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, although Mirza Ahmad holds the title- deeds, seized by force the properties in Tun, sending some of his Baluch retainers from Sis tan to take forcible possession. The monies which the guardian now claims from Hissam-ud-Daulah and Hashmat-ul-Mulk are three years’ income of the Tun properties at 2,000 Tomans per annum plus certain claims of the estate, amounting to 3,000 Tomans, which have been realised by the two Amirs. The documents which Mirza Ahmad has shown to me are:—- ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) (4) (5) ( 6 ) (7) ( 8 ) Authority, signed by Mujtehid and Mullahs of Tehran, dated 17th Rabi I, 1328-H.

In continuation of my letter No. 93-C., dated the 3rd July 1914, I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a Despatch No. 14, dated the 11th July 1914, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, on the subject of Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s interference with the estate of the late All Asghar Beg. No. 14. H. B. M.’s Consulate foe Sistan and Kain, Birjand, 11th July 1914. Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s Interference with the Estate of the Late Ali Asghar Beg. Sir, With reference to my Despatch No. 12, dated the 27th June 1914,1 have the honour to report that Hissam-ud-Dowleh has sent me a message consequent upon Shaukat-ul-Mulk having made some communication to him. He states that he has written to his Mustaufi, Mirza Qoshid Khan, in Tehran to interview the minor girl’s maternal relations and give them assurances that will satisfy them as to the disposal of the income from the estate of the late Ali Asghar, I do not imagine for a moment that the relatives in question will believe in any promises that Mirza Qoshid may make them. There is not a shadow of doubt that Hissam-ud-Dowleh and his son have themselves spent the income for the last three years. At the same time, it must be admitted that Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s position is rather a strong one. He is paternal uncle by marriage to the girl. Her step father and first cousin is in his service, and he very probably feels that much of the late Nazir’s fortune was made by irregular means at his own (Hissam’s) expense. Moreover his claim to take some part in the administration of the estate, as express ed in document No. 4, referred to in the Memorandum which accompanied my last Despatch, seems to be admitted as valid by Mirza Ahmed Mudir. Hissam-ud-Dowleh professes to disbelieve in the integrity of Mirza Ahmed Mudir. I would not see any objection to’his nominating a co-administrator of the estate, tut the main desideratum is to get the revenue realized already by the Amirs out of their hands and deposited in the Bank or some other safe receptacle, and I do not see how this is to be brought about except unde r the strongest pressure from Tehran. ‘ It will be interesting to know what course will be followed in the negotiations between Mirza Qoshid and the minor’s maternal relatives in Tehran.

The value of his share in the Piruzabad estate is reported to be nearer twelve thousand than eight thousand tomans. His father gave him Amirabad. Its revenues, however, are earmarked for the maintenance of his mother. Malekuttui (please do not disclose this name) told me that Hashmat-ul-Mulk certainly had in the Russian bank, when he started for Tehran, eleven thousand tomans. Hashmat-ul-Mulk took with him a good supply of ready cash and afterwards received two large remittances. In the opinion of other well informed people Hashmat-ul- Mulk has not withdrawn much of his money from tne Bank and has a great deal more to draw on.

Hashmat does not deny that the Heiress of the Naib of Sunni Khana, who is his wife, possesses considerable property. He says that estates Nos.1,2 and 3 are entirely at my service and he has placed himself in my hands. Will you kindly make further careful ea^uiries as regards his possessions.

How that I am aware of this fact and that he is suspected of being in league with rebel Baluchis I will put the acre?/' on a little tighter. It was never my intention that Hashmat should retirrn to Sistan before Shaokat had got firmly established. Hashmat himself professes to have no wish ever to retorn to Sistan. He most realise that he is not really restored to favour as I have never called on him. He have ta*en firmer measures against Hashmat-ol-Holk than the Russian Govern ment woold have thought of taking in their sphere, bitterly abused though Russian Government are, and justly, for their high handed policy in lersia.

Kirza Ismail Khan financial agent also states that Ha.hmat-ul-Mulk owns rn^ch property here. For my part I venture to urge (a) that we are entitled to adopt much stronger measures against local Governors in British sphere than even those in neutral sphere (hi that British claims against K a 3 hmat-ul-I.”lk are of only three year’s standing (o) that, there is no hope of our making a genuine friend in Hashmat -ul-*.ulk a ° as we prevent his returning to Sistan and keep him out 01 an official position. Vere we to adopt such a policy would gain a reputation for fickleness which would harm much in these parts and would also lose confidence of Shaokat, whose friendship is of far greater walue to - that*•X* OT A) oH (!3) than Hashmat's. I only venture to say so much because I agree with Colonel Webb - Ware that Hashmat-ul-Mulk will never really make friends with us and that he should not be permitted to return to Sistan until such time as his power for evil has been crushed. In my opinion it is most imperative that Hashmat-ul-I'ulk be kept under strict control until Shaokat has paid a visit to Sistan and brought Sardars into line there* With his present staff of Hilitary Officers I think offensive measnres against the Sarhad will be most doubtful in their issue. The Commander-in-Chief Bashir Kiaam is well known in Sistan as incapable and of a cowardly character*(Copy) Telegram- P. j / * From His Britannic Majesty*s Consnl for Sistan &amp; K a in, Rabat, » t I f i * To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. %o. 72 C.

I do not see any real reason why in the matter of settlement the Sistan claims should take precedence over all other claims in Persia. Many others have been equally due to flagrant misj'conduct on the part of Provincial Governor and it has been clearly stipulated that they will only be paid when the raising of a big loan will enable Persian Government to do so. Every effort is of course made to obtain payment of new claims from Governors who have been held directly responsible*.'COPY). &lt;n Telegram-P - ' o ‘ “ &amp;.

MY telegram No. 25 of the 25th January reported the departure of Shaukat-ul- Mulk for Seistan and Kain, and outlined the measures I proposed to take against his Tehran, February 18, 1914. nephew Hashmat-ul-Mulk in order to punish him for his past misdeeds, and to recover the claims of British merchants and others against him. In your telegram No. 20 of the 27th January you were good enough to approve my action in the matter. In conformity with your wishes, I brought some pressure to bear on the Persian Government last summer, in order to put an end to the unsatisfactory state of affairs which had existed in Seistan for so many years, due entirely, according to the reports of successive consular officers, to the bad behaviour of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. At that time the Governor of Seistan was nominally Hissam-ed-Dowleh, who is Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s father. The Acting Governor of Seistan was Mohammed Reza Khan, another of Hissam-ed-Dowleh’s sons, against whom I have no complaints to make. Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh, who was then, as now, Minister of the Interior, received my representa tions in a most friendly spirit, and undertook to bring Hashmat-ul-Mulk to Tehran, but he thought that the only way to attain this end would be to summon the father, Hissam-ed-Dowleh, and the uncle, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, to Tehran as well. I would remind you, Sir, that Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who has for many years been Governor of Kain, has consistently shown the most friendly disposition towards us, and that one of the principal counts of the charges against Hashmat-ul-Mulk was that of instigating Baluchi raids into the Kainat with the object of damaging Shaukat-ul-Mulk in our eyes, and of course incidentally sharing in the profits of his plundering followers. I therefore made it clear to Ain-ed-Dowleh that if all three were summoned to Tehran Shaukat-ul-Mulk should not suffer thereby. Ain-ed-Dowleh’s summons did not receive a ready response, but Shaukat-ul-Mulk, having received promises of support from me, was the first to start for the capital in September, and Hashmat-ul-Mulk followed shortly afterwards. Hissam-ed-Dowleh pleading age and infirmity was allowed to remain. When Shaukat-ul-Mulk arrived in Tehran I treated him with marked cordiality, and assisted him with the Persian Government in dealing with the various points he had to raise relating to his Governorship. These negotiations culminated in the separation of Seistan and Kain from Khorassau and the appointment of Shaukat-ul- Mulk to the independent Governorship of both places. A variety of minor though equally important questions arose during the three and a half months Shaukat-ul-Mulk remained at Tehran. He wanted to raise an effective force both in Seistan and Kain ; he required arms and ammunition, but above all he desired to define his relations with the Treasury. All these questions were eventually settled to the satisfaction of all parties. At the same time Shaukat-ul-Mulk desired to rid himself of a long-standing dispute with a female relative who had married Yamin*i-Nizam, whose name will be associated with Colonel MacMahon’s Perso-Afghan Water Commission. Yamin-i-Nizarn, who resides at Tehran, is a dangerous individual, and closely associated with Hashmat-ul-Mulk. When both sides to the dispute offered to refer the questions at issue to the arbitration of Mr. Churchill, my oriental secretary, I authorised him to undertake the task. It turned out to be of a highly technical nature relating to | ar ^ e estates in Kain left by will in the - form of “ Vakf ” or religious endowment. With the aid of a high clerical authority Mr. Churchill investigated the matter, and eventua y gave his verdict in favour of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, thus disposing of an extremely tioio e- some question which the Courts at Tehran had been unable to settle. Hashmat-ul-Mulk, after endeavouring by all means in his power to evade t e summons of the Minister of the Interior, eventually reached Tehran, and at once placed himself under the tutel/ge of Yamin-i-Nizam. He called upon me with bhaukat-u - Mulk and I took the opportunity of telling him how seriously His Majesty s Govern- ment had cause to comolain of his behaviour. I told him that British claims againsthim amounted to over 26,000 tomans (about 5,000L), and that he would have to pay this sum. He showed no inclination to pay this claim, and though he was not actually defiant I found that he had appealed to the Russian Legation for. protection and support. I attribute this attitude on his part largely to the influence of Yamin-i- Nizam, who appealed in vain to M. Sabline on his behalf. , I would have proceeded to take stronger action against him at once but for*, t Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s request that I should defer moving until after his own departure from Tehran. Shaukat-ul-Mulk left on the 22nd January, and the following day I sent Hashmat-ul-Mulk a strongly-worded message demanding the payment of 26,902 tomans and 9 krans as compensation for British losses sustained while he was responsible for the Governorship of Seistan, and enclosing, together with a detailed list of the claims, an abstract of various reports from His Majesty’s consular officers recounting the misdeeds of which he had been guilty. My message gave him twenty days in which to settle the British claim, failing which I would demand his arrest. The Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs were informed of my action. Hashmat-ul-Mulk appealed as usual to the Russian Legation and was again disappointed. On the 12th instant he was duly arrested, and is now detained in one of the rooms of the Ministry of the Interior, where he sees his friends, but is not allowed to go out. This form of arrest is of course extremely mild, and if necessary I shall see that his confinement is more strict. In the meantime, a very necessary lesson is being inflicted on this extremely foolish, misguided young man, and 1 hope that it will deter others in the British zone, and perhaps even in the neutral zone, from any future inclination to treat His Majesty’s Government with the contempt which has marked Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s career during the last seven or eight years. Before concluding this despatch I desire to bring to your notice, Sir, the sense of my high appreciation of Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh’s attitude throughout these proceedings. I have, &amp;c.

I have now commenced action against Hashmat-ul-Mulk, late Governor of Seistan, who is here, from whom I am claiming close upon 27,000 tomans on account of losses suffered by British trade during his governorship. I have given him twenty days in which to pay, and propose to demand his arrest pending payment if he does not comply within the time limit fixed at.

For the above reasons I consider it imperative that he should be taught a severe lesson which will serve as a deterrent to his Baluchi relations, who are all closely connected with leading raiders.

I told the Governor General that 1 objected strongly to his coming to Meshed; and that 1 counted on him to see that he went to Nishapur without entering the city. His Highness agreed to do as I wished, 2. At the request of the Governor General 1 instructed the Turbat-l-Haidari Agent to send me a prearranged word when the Hishmat-ul-Mulk left Turbat. This was done and the Governor General sent out a men with instructions to the Chief not to enter Meshed, 3. However the temptation to see the shrine was too strong. The Hashmat rapidly entered Meshed and after making the pilgrimage, returned to Kafir Kala some forty miles to the South. He is now moving slowly towards Nishapur. 4. I was approached by the head of the Governor General's office, who is the Hlshmat's secret agent,with a request for advice. He said that the Hishmat wished thatthat I should Inquire into and settle his case and that he was unwilling to go to Tehran. I replied that this was out 1 of the question and that 1 advised him to go to Tehran,to | acknowledge his faults, and to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Minister. I said that any other course would bring about the ruin of himself and of his family. I advised him against denying that he was concerned with the raids as it could be proved. I suggested that he could excuse himself to some extent by saying that it was the custom of the country. 5. The Agent was convinced that my advice was given in the best interests of the Hishmat. He will communicate it to the Chief at Nishapur; and if it brings him to Tehran in a contrite frame of mind, much trouble will be saved to the Legation. 6.

On more than one occasion the demand has been made that llashmat should be dismissed and expelled from Seistan. Successive Governments have proved too weak to effect this, and the demands of the legation, which has good grounds for laying at Hashmat’s door a very large proportion of the losses incurred by British trade in consequence of Baluchi raids, were met by evasive answers and assurances that the necessary measures would be taken as soon as the Persian Government was strong enough to enforce them. Soon after Ain-ed-Dowleh took office last winter, I broached the question with his Highness, who expressed an opinion that Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Shaukat-ul-Mulk (the Governor of Hain), and Hissani-ed-Dowleh should all come to Tehran, where an enquiry could be held into the affairs of the two provinces. It was clearly imderstood that there was no complaint against Shaukat, and that he would be allowed to return to Kain, whereas the other two would be suitably punished. Ain-ed-Dowleh requested to be allowed to take such steps as he thought best to secure the object in view. I acquiesced, but I took measures to control the steps taken by his Highness, and when I saw signs that his pressure was weakening, I reminded him from time to time that the matter was becoming urgent. After hesitating for some months to comply with orders that became more imperative with each repetition, in consequence of my reiterated representations, Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat-ul-Mulk started for Tehran, the former in the face of a hostile demonstration engineered by the latter, intended to frighten him into giving up his journey. After consultation with His Majesty’s consul in Seistan, it was agreed with Ala-es-Sultaneh, then acting as Minister of the Interior, that Hissam-ed-Dowleh should be excused on account of his bad health and old age from coming to Tehran, but I insisted that he should retire to a property of his some 50 miles from Birjand, and should no longer be associated with the Government. This has been carried out. Shaukat is approaching Tehran, but Hashmat is dallying at Tun in the hope of being encouraged by the Governor-General of Khorassan to go to Meshed. Ain-ed-Dowleh is telegraphing that he should come here at once. I will report further in due course.

In continuation of my letter No. 121 -C., dated the 5 th instant, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of my despatches Nos. 12 and 13, dated the 9th and 13th instant respectively, with enclosures, addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran.

Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Teheran. Visit of the Governor of Sistan and Kainat to Teheran. In continuation of my telegram No. 60 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to report the details of the disturbance which occurred yesterday morning on the occasion of the departure of His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of the Kainat, for Teheran. I may preface this report by saying that not a single Persian of influence in Birjand (with the one exception probably of His Excellency’s Mustaufi-Mizbeh- ud-Divan) has been from first to last in favour of the Governor’s obeying the summons from the Ministry of the Interior. One or two Mujtihids and the Malik- ut-Tujjar, who are very friendly with us, acquiesced in the proposal, but the very great majority of the notables here have consistently opposed it. Further, His Excellency has been continuously receiving telegrams from Teheran, Meshed and elsewhere, from noblemen and officials who profess to be his most loyal friends, begging him not for a moment to contemplate this serious step, the latest telegram of this sort is one from Ibtihaj-us-Sultan xWirza, the newly appoint ed Director of Revenue, who three days ago telegraphed from Turbat-i-Haideri begging Shaukat-ul-Mulk not to leave Birjand until he arrives, and saying that he is using his best efforts personally in the meanwhile to get the summons counter- manded; Ibtihaj-us-Sultan is the brother of Muhammad Taqi Mirza, who used to command the Military forces in Birjand until Haji Nasir-es-S Itaneh disbanded them all two years ago, and who since then has been living here, drawing lo salary, as the personal guest and; ide de camp of the Governor. At the same time, this Muhammad Taqi Mirza has maintained the most friendly relations with the Russian Consulate, going there to give my colleague and his staff lessons in lawn tennis twice a week, and we have always regarded him as one of Baron Tchex- kassov’s news-collectors and unofficial messengers. In these circumstances it is a fine proof of Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s common sense, and of the sincere friendship which exists between him and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul Mr. Howson, that His Excellency should heve hesitated so little before deciding to go to Teheran, and that he should have adhered unswervingly to the resolve ever since, in spite of the heavy expense to which he will undoubt edly be put. Yesterday morning His Excellency started from his residence about two miles from the town, at 8-30 A. M. Eight Cavalry sowars and two ghulams of this Consulate were in attendance on him, as were also eight or nine Cossacks from the Russian Consulate. At n. mile from his house, at the point where the road from my camp and cottage joins the road to Birjand, I, with the Vice-Consul, met His Excellency and we then drove in his carriage into the town as far as the lolegraph Othce. We then said eood-bye to His Excellency, knowing that about 200 )ards further on in the broad 8 rive Aed or ‘ Rud ’which runs through the town, he expected to be met bv a larae number of Mullahs and merchants of the town, and in addition possibly b/Hashmat-ul-Mulk himself. I then got mto my own carriage and C409FD /returned home (3 miles away) while Mr. Howson proceeded on foot towards his own house. Up to this point, the crowd surrounding the procession had not been very large, and although there was a considerable amount of weeping and wailing the people were behaving in quite orderly fashion. Mr. Howson’s report, which I attach, describes the extraordinary affair which must have started within fifteen minutes of my departure. The Vice-Consulate I may explain, is situated on high ground about 100 yards from the further bank of the Rud ’. It is close to the Meshed road. Evidently Hashmat-ul-Mulk made no appearance in the streets. Jn the afternoon His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk wrote from his camp at Chah Haoz, thankmg Mr. Howson sincerely for his assistance and for the services of our Sowars and Ghulams, without which he would have had great difficulty in getting away. He forwarded at the same time 100 Tomans for distribution amongst the men, subject to my concurrence. As several of our men had suffered contusions and all had undergone risks m this unexpected affair, I have requested Mr. Howson to acknowledge His Excellency s kind act with thanks, stipulating at the same time that he will make the leading offenders pay for the gift and that, as the men were only doing their duty, His Excellency’s own pocket shall not suffer. I trust that my action in this connection will be approved. If it is considered that we should not have accepted the present, I can make His Excellency a return present of corresponding value from funds at my disposal. In conclusion, I beg to express the opinion that Mr. Howson deserves much credit for the promptness of his action in offering hospitality and shelter to His Excellency, and for his resoluteness in bringing the affair to a satisfactory con clusion. I have a suspicion that Baron Tcherkassov is chagrined at the result for when my wife and I went to the Russians’ residence yesterday afternoon for tennis under an old invitation, he made no appearance at all, the first time in our experience of his secluding himself. Copy. CONFIDENTIAL. Report by Mr. Howson on the demonstration against the Hashmat-ul-Mulk's depar ture from Birjand. 1 {Note. List of 20 Ring-Leaders omitted in this Copy.) W hen the Shaukat got to the Rud, the demonstration was a natural one f.nd only what he expected The people prayed of him not to go awav, because they feared that once he left, Birjand would be at the mercv of robbers No violence was shown to the Shaukat till Syed Ghulam Hussain (No. 1 ) came on the scene and stirred up the people. They then became violent and tried to drag him off Ins horse, to keep them from leaving them. The Shaukat and his sowars had to use their whips, but still he could not be extricated I was taking photographs from Jawala Singh’s shop, and when I saw that the crowd was in earnest, and the Shaukat was being hustled, I sent a man to advise him to back out of the crowd and make for the Vice-Consulate. After great difficulty they were able to do this I arrived at the Vice-Consulate by a short cut at the same time that the Shaukat did with a crowd at his heels. I advised him to come inside and rest himself as he had had a rough time of it and seemed a bit exhausted. The crowd of well over two thousand besieged the Vice-Consulate The Shaukat summoned the Chief Mujtihid from his house, the Malik-ut-Tujjar and two or three other influential people to the Vice-Consulate. They tried to get the crowd to move off by suggesting that they should all go to the Telegraph Office and telegraph off to Teheran, but without avail. Then on my advice, the Shaukat and the Mujtimd went on the roof and harangued the crowd. My idea was that by doing so, the people who were at the back entrances of the house would come round to the front to hear the Shaukat’s speech; and that then he could leave the Mujtihid talking to them and he and I would slip down and get off toour horses at the Tennis Court Gate unmolested. After the Shaukat had explained to the crowd that he was going to Teheran for their good and that he would make proper arrangements with the Government, when he went there, for the province to be secured from further Baluch raids, he told them that he was leaving sufficient force behind him to guard Birjand during his absence. The Shaukat’s speech seemed to have a splendid effect —the people became quite orderly and we thought there would be no further trouble. But then the men whom I have mentioned in the list made themselves felt by exciting the crowd again not to let the Shaukat go to Teheran. The Shaukat left the Mujtihid haranguing them, and we, as intended, went out by the Tennis Court entrance and were about to mount our horses, when a number of people who were hidden behind the back wall rushed out and got hold of His Excellency. With great difficulty the few men who were with us managed to extricate His Excellency, and pushed him inside. I was afraid His Excellency’s arm might have been dislocated, they had him by the arm and leg. I ordered the Duffadar, who, with his sowars and all the other riders was in front of the Vice-Consulate, to bring the Cavalry Sowars at the back and disperse the crowd which had collected in great force at the Tennis Court Gate. The Sowars’ little charge was most effective and most of the people took to their heels ; when I saw one man named Syed Hassan (No. 3 ) rally the mob and !• ad them on shouting “ Ya Ali”. Then stones began to fly and I thought it best to call off the Sowars from there. I went on to the roof and personally threaten ed some of the men whom I knew and started taking down their names. The Shau kat ordered his men to arrest the ring-leaders and bring them into the Vice-Consu late for flogging. This action seemed to have the desired efiect. I think, however, that, notwithstanding the stone throwing, the little charge by the Sowars had a decidedly good effect, for from that time the crowd certainly lessened. When it was known that the ring-leaders had to be whipped, they (the ring-leaders) seemed to have vanished; and with their disappearance, the mob that remained became orderly and we were able to mount at our front door and get off. The horsemen kept the crowd off till we started. A reference to the list will show that most of the names are those of people who are in the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s following (not necessarily his own servants though some are connected with them) and are known Hashmat-ul-Mulkis. The Shaukat thinks that the Hashmat and Hissam are responsible for this extraordinary demonstration for one of two reasons, either to keep him (and so to keep the Hashmat from going too) from going altogether, or to cause him to put off his journey till the Hashmat is able to accompany him. I am of the same opinion. There were only a couple of the crowd who were armed with sticks and one of o r j tt them was No. 3. The Shaukat told me that he with difficulty restrained himself from using his revolver in the “Rud”. He said that for a peaceful demonstration to be so rough and for him to have to escape from the crowd, it would be hard to handle the people if they were worked up at any time to imagining they had grievances aga nst him. He has instructed the Mustaufi to have the ring-leaders punished when he finds himself in a stronger position, that is, when the Bahluris and sarbazes come in. The Shaukat when saying good-bye asked me to thank the sowars for all the trouble they had taken. (Sd.) W. R. HOWSON, Vice-Consul. 8th September 1913. No. 13, dated Birjand, the 13th September 1913.

Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Teheran. Visit of the Governors of Sistan and Kainat to Teheran. I have the honour to enclose copies of the correspondence which has recently passed between Hashmat-ul-Mulk, late Deputy Governor of Sistan, and myself4 on the subject of the required visit to Teheran. I trust that the wording of my reply will meet with Your Excellency's approval. Hashmat-ul-Mulk has, I believe, also applied to the Russian Consul for a letter of assurance as regards his treatment in Teheran, and he says that he expects from ^ the latter some guarantee almost as favourable as that which Shaukat-ul-Mulk received from me. In the circumstances, I forward to you, at the Governor of Kainat’s request, the letter in original (with translation) which Baron Tcherkassov addressed to His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk in March 1911 on the subject of*the “lawless doings of Hashmat-ul-Mulk In the face of this document any opinion which my colleague may now express denying the connection of the ex-Deputy Governor with the Baluch raids, must be of little value. Translation of a letter dated the 5th Shaval (7th September 1913) from Hashmat-ul-Mulk to His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. After compliments. While offering compliments and enquiring after your health I beg to trouble you respectfully as follows:— Seeing that the Authorities have ordered me to present myself at Teheran and I do not know the cause and reason of my having been summoned, I request firstly that you very kindly will write me what you know regarding this. Secondly, please say if, after my arrival at Teheran, I shall receive assistance and help in my affairs from the British Lega tion and yourself. Thirdly, please write whether you yourself, during the period of your stay in this province, have ever observed (God for bid) disrespect and anything but devotion and sincerity from me to yourself, or anything peculiar or contrary to the usages required for the maintenance of proper friendly relations.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 5 th Shaval 1331 (7th September 1913). You enquire of me the cause and reason of your being summoned to Teheran and you request that the British Legation may assist and help you in your affairs. Also you ask whether I have ever seen anything but complete friendship in your relations with myself. In reply, I beg to repeat what I have told you verbally, that you have undoubted ly been summoned to Teheran at the instance of the British Legation to answer for the losses which have occurred to British subjects at the hands of Balj^h, Afghan, and Sistani robbers during your incumbency of the Government of Sistan as the Deputy of your father, His Excellency Hissam-ed-Dowleh. The extent of our claims is about Tomans 26,500, and in addition as a sign of the displeasure of His Britannic Majesty’s Government at your neglect and disregard for British interests, the Persian Government have been requested to prohibit you from returning to the vicinity of Kainat and Sistan for some time to come.No other penalties are contemplated against you by the British Legation, and so far as I know the Persian Government do not require your presence for any other matter. I feel sure that you will be acting wisely by going to Teheran and your com pliance with the orders of your Government will certainly be a source of pleasure both to the Cabinet and to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister. As regards your relations with myself, I am glad to state that they always have been quite friendly. It is as a well-wisher that I advise you to obey the orders of the Government. (Usual ending.) Translation of a letter. Dated the 11th Rabi-ul-Maulud (Aval) 1329 (12th March 1911). From— Baron Tcherkassov, Russian Con^l at Sistan, To—His Excellency Shaukut-ul-Mulk, Birjand. After compliments. I beg to remind Your Excellency of the extent and heartiness of my friend ship towards you. I have for a long time awaited a fit opportunity to prove it. Now, the hwless doings of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, his secret instigations and other actions causing mischief and damage to your province have passed all bounds and I and the British Consul cannot restrain mrselves and are prepared to assist you in any way possible. We will convey this information through our Legations to the Persian Government, so that they may make arrangements for the prevention of the looting of the property of the people of Kainat and for your security. We will also testify as regards your aloofness (i.e. from complicity). We have urged the Government, in many letters and telegrams, to send a trust worthy, true, and efficient ‘mamur’ to enquire into all the robberies (committed) in Kainat territory, who will make enquiries and recover property known to be stolen from the Kainat and will thereby enhance your dignity. Therefore in extreme friendship and unity, I point out to you that we have acted, and will continue to act, in accordance with our friendship and unity and have brought the matter to this point that Nasir-es-Saltaneh, the mamur appointed to enquire into this matter, will leave Teheran shortly for Sistan. It is advisable that before the arrival of this mamur you, also, as far as possible, should procure proper means, proofs, and documents to prove all the documents in the Kainat, so that on the arrival of the mamur in Kainat territory you can prove that all the robberies have occurred at the instigation of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and (committed) by the Baluchis of Sistan. The mamur will thus have proper documentary evidence. My assistance and that of the British Consul has ever been, and always will be, at your disposal anyw T here and at any time. (Usual ending.) G.

With reference to an entry in the Weekly Diary of this Consulate, No. 36, for the week ending 6 th September 1913, reporting the capture of a Baluch raider,' I have the honour to enclose a translation of the man’s statement ( somewhat condensed) which the Consulate Attache-Dragoman has recorded. The prisoner’s evidence, as regards Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s attitude towards raid ing and his own master’s (Khudadad’s) connection with the pursuit, was given with some hesitation and reserve, due no doubt to the fact that the Mustaufis of Hissam-ud-Dowleh and Hashmat-ul-Mulk have been allowed to visit him here. The prisoner’s first statement was recorded before the Mujtihid of Duruksh, and he has not since modified in any way his account of the expedition nor the names of the participants in it. I believe the authorities here propose to keep the man in prison until his friends pay up a fine. Statement of Imam Bakhsh, son of Hasan Khan, Brahui Baluch, of Khwaja Ahmad {Sistan). I am a follower of Sardar Khudadad Khan of Khwaja Ahmad. He gives ma two or three Kharwars of grain every year as payment for riding out with him on a camel, whenever he goes from home. Afzul, Tor Khan and Husain, Brahuis of the Chandan tribe, and residents of Lutak, invited me to accompany them on this raid. These three men are brothers. Up to a year ago they used to be in the ser vice of Sardar Khudadad Khan, and used to go on raiding expeditions into British Territory for him. Their last exploit was to raid two flocks of sheep owned by Behloris from Kainat. The sheep were traced to Khwaja Ahmad. Hashmat-ul- Mulk made Khudadad Khan arrest the three men with their nine companions and fined them 1,200 Tomans. A number of the sheep were also returned to the Behloris. For this the brothers went off wandering, and lately settled in Lutak, where they attached themselves to Sardar Said Khan Brahui. {Note .— This man was formerly in the British Consular Service, and is now a follower of Hashmat-ul-Mulk.) These three brothers, when in the service of Sardar Khudadad Khan, used to render to their master one-tenth of all their booty. Khudadad Khan never goes raiding, nor does he encourage raids in the Kainat. He sends men occasionally into British territory, towards Chagai, Nushki, Kharan, etc. Three years ago he sent Tor Khan to Nushki with Murad Ali son of Juma Khan, Safar son of Mengal, and Siddiq son of Mengal, and they raided 15 or 18 camels from Shadi Khan, Mengal Ahmadzai.Two years ago, Sardar Klmdadad Khan sent Idu and JumaJalal with four other men to Zahru. He took for himself four camels out of the loot. Khuda- dad Khan, in fact, extorts a share of the loot in all raids committed against Afghanistan and British Territory. In the recent raid, my other companions were Saidu, Naroi, son of Kadkhuda Sher Muhammad and cousin of Sardar Khudadad Khan, Jalal Khan, follower of Sardar Purdil Khan, Murad Ali, follower of Khudadad Khan, Husain, follower of Sardar Said Khan and Said Muhammad, follower of Nazar Jan. We came as far as Chak Payo, and had captured 14 camels, 11 donkeys, 2 rifles and other property. We had also 5 prisoners, owners of the things. Afzal arranged that he and 1 should stop there with the prisoners while the rest of the party drove off the loot. We went to sleep and the prisoners got themselves released and overpowered us. Afzal promised that he would return them their property and they let him go. They apparently knew him by sight, as he had frequently been to Chak Payo before. As regards the other bands of raiders, the men who visit Kainat are practically all from Sarhad. They are the tribesmen of Sardar Jahind, Sardar Jehil and Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan Reqi. These three chiefs have respectively 700, 580 and 630 fighting followers. All of these used to give a part of their loot to Hashmat-ul-Mulk when he was Deputy Governor of Sistan. Sardar Said Khan, Narui, did the same. I remember the latter sending two camels so valuable that Khudadad Khan offered to give twelve camels for each in exchange. They had golden nose-rings. Taj Muhammad Juda, who is a native of Deki Dela, gives a share of his loot to Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak in Afghanistan. Juma Jalal, though he gives some of his loot to Khudadad Khan, is really a follower of Sardar Purdil Khan. He gives a share of his loot also to the latter.:opy.

'A notice has been issued by the new Revenue Director, Birjand, ordering that the revenues due for two years on account of pasture must be paid within two days otherwise this revenue will be collected by force with an additional heavy penalty. He keeps a hundred sowars in reserve to throw against any village that resists and is about to send collectors in all directions. Deputy Governor deprecates such precipitate action in the absence of the Governor. Director has been advised by Deputy Governor to enlist collectors with discretion and deliberation otherwise bloodshed is sure to occur and to start operations in the Northern villages which have not been subjected to Baluchi raids. Directors says that matters are being pushed by him under orders of Leleux, who perhaps thinks it profitable to take advantage of absence of Governor. Such policy is, in my opinion, un wise and likely to complicate the negotiations in Tehran. Director should, I recommend, be ordered to visit personally parts which have been ravaged and report on their condition before collecting any revenue in the West and South he should in the North only collect the revenue he can without recourse to force.

In connection with your visit to Teheran you mention the following four points in regard to which you desire assurance from me. You write:— “ (i) My stay in Teheran need not be longer than one month, within which period the Persian Government officials may either decide to accept my statements (i.e. explanations and proposals) or, if they be deem ed unacceptable, they (Government officials) may give me a clear reply so that I may not be longer detained.

I put situation in Seistan very clearly before the Minister of the Interior yesterday. I represented that matters could not continue any longer as they are, and that Persian Government must lose no time in taking necessary action to remove Hashmat-ul-Mulk from Seistan or the neighbourhood, since it is clear that, whether he is Acting Governor or a mere spectator, he is at the bottom of all the mischief. Ain-ed-Dowleh suggested Hissam-ed-Dowleh, Hashmat-ul-Mnlk, and Shaokat-ul- Mulk should all be summoned to Tehran, it being understood that last-named should return to his post. His Highness said he had not perfect confidence that his orders would be obeyed, as was the case when he issued similar orders when he was Grand Vizier, but he said he would do his best, and would consult Governor-General of Khorassan, who is more conversant with the present local conditions in Kain and Seistan than himself. I said that decided action must be taken, as His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were becoming impatient at the long continuance of unrestrained disorder, and that it would be impossible to wait until such time as the gendarmerie might be numerous enough to take any action.

' ^ YOUR telegram No. 241 Following from consul at Seistan :— “ I believe that repetition of our warning is and will be regarded as a sign of weakness. “ Jehind professes to have a grievance against us, and recent telegrams disclose other similar complaints of Baluchis. We have gained absolutely no redress for losses inflicted on British subjects thirteen months ago, but we have sustained no further loss, and I would prefer to hold no direct communication with the natives of Sarhad at this stage. “ In my opinion it is an easy matter to punish these tribes adequately. Natives of Sarhad are absolutely dependent upon Seistan and Bam in equal proportions perhaps for all their supplies. Wells between Sarhad and Seistan, Kisnat, and Tah are few and far between. If blockaded for two years, tribes would be reduced to extreme distress. Nasiri-es-Sultaneh himself pointed out this fact to me, but he is not the man to conduct operations, as he is partisan of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. Sending of Khudadad Khan, cousin of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, last year to Meh, to recover loot from their kinsmen, was a futile experiment. It would be equally useless to expect Purdil Khan, Khudadad’s enemy and deputy governor, to support any action against Sarhad or Shaokat. “I firmly believe that, until a disciplined force is sent from Meshed under a Swede, first, to arrest Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and, secondly, punish Khudadad and blockade the natives of Sarhad, we shall see no improvement. Khudadad is the Belgians’ most active opponent in Seistan.” I am making energetic representations to Minister of the Interior, but we must rely for the present upon such action as I can induce Persian Government to take, as I see no immediate probability of Swedes being able to extend their operations to Seistan.

I0.107-C. Dated 18th (and received via Hobat 82nd) August 1915. I have addressed following telegram to Minister. Begins No.51. Please refer to your telegram No.30. Shaukat will I believe positively be disappointed if he is not urged to go to Tehran. As regards himself we have thoroughly allayed his fears. Rumours are prevalent in Birjand basaar that both Governor and Hashmat-ul-MUlk have been ordered to appear in Tehran by Shah and that both have put in hand their preparations for departure. Hashmat-ul-MUlk sarttm evinces much agitation. He has sent me messages in the last three days through three different people to the effect that if he is excused from going he will pay all our Just claims. I hear at the same time that he has no expectation of our demanding more than three thousand tomans which is perhaps total extent ? of our claims which were presented to him on paper before he left (for) Sistan. It has also come to my hearing that if orders are given to Governor to expel him from ITainat he meditates taking sanctuary in Meshed. In reply to your query, I believe garrison of Kaoha comprises about four hundred native infantry. These would hardly be sufficient for us to make an effective demonstration with. I offer suggestion that Government of India should be requested to despatch a cavalry regiment or a few hundred infantry from Qpetta mounted on oamels to our frontier at Robat. News of this despatch of troops would probably be enough to drive Hashmat-ul-Mulk straight awayi but if it failed to effect this object a hundred scldiers could run him to earth with ease and perfect safety. Natives o both@ ^ both Slatan and Kalnat aro dafioiant in warllka propanaitiaa and hare bean thoroughly demorallaad hy the actions of Baluohls. They are all thoroughly friendly to ue and in fact arrival of small force of troopa would be welcomed by them ae they would recogniee that for the time being they would be immune from further attache by raiders. I am of opinion that it is most essential that Shaukat should take his departure for Tehram even if for the time being it is necessary for us to discontinue pressing for departure of the others. If Shaukat does not prooeed to Tehran relations with Belgians are not likely to improve and will in fact go from bad to worse. Bor a consider able time back instead of drawing revenue finance ^Department of Persian Government has sent remittances at the rate of two thousand tomans a month from Meshed through the Imperial Bank of Persia for disbursement of salaries here. In my opinion questions pertinent to revenue collection and the organisation of local military forces can never be settled in a satisfactory manner except after a personal discussion. To sum of the situation I think we should make every possible endeavour to secure both Shaukat and Hashraat-ul-Mulk's departure for Tehran without delay. If the Persian Government will not urge the latter we should resort to intimidation &amp;e has been suggested. If however it is thought preferable to enter into a compromise with Hashmat-ul-Mulk am I empowered to demand from him only twenty thousand tomans which la the amount mentioned in your telegram Bo.34 ? It appears to ms that in accordance with Persian custom Hashmat-ul-Mulk is responsible also for the losses inflicted on British Government by Afghan arms traders as * as ioual burglars. A Governor is required to apprehend robbers and compel them to disgorge or himself make good the losses l tel. If these claims era not paid by Haahmat-ul-lftilk will the Persian Government through Finance Department indemnify the lose s Agent to the Government of India in Baluohistan has on more than one occasion asked me why the Belgians 8 v ^ id r t t a&gt; ii •Ttlagntn - p. 967.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey. — {Received September 6 , 1 p.m.) Tehran, September 6 , 1913. (No. 302.) R. (September 6, 10*30 a.m.) SHAUKAT-UL-MULK, the Governor of Kain, asks whether His Majesty’s Government, through their vice-consul or consul, will act as executor of his will for his whole estate and as trustee for a third of landed estate, which he will assign to charity in the form of a hospital and schools. Expenses would be secured by provisions in the will. If it is impossible to give consent in both matters, he hopes that we will agree to give our good offices to ensure his wishes being carried out in the event of the will being disputed. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has always been friendly to us, and I consider it very desirable that we should give him such assurances as may be possible. He requests early answer, which he trusts may be favourable, as experience has taught him to put little faith in the Persian authorities. Conv to India 12 SEP 1913 [1071—137]I irom Hi.

The telegram from Shaukat’s Agent in Tehran has been seen by me, in which he advises the Governor to leave for Tehran within three days and so avoid losing his post. This threat is I presume not yet serious. Shaukat is quite prepared to start but cannot safely leave Hashmut- ul-Mulk in Sistan. Both Hashraut-ul-Mulk and Hissam aim at dragging Shaukat/ down with them. If such a result were attained, my Russian Colleague who hates the Governor, would be delighted. Shaukat I urge should be commanded to bring Hissam and Hashmut with him or else to send one to his estate 50 miles away and drive the other from the country. When publicly C&amp;rv pressed by us Governor! believe carry out such orders. Will not second alternative arrangement/ suffice as regards Hissam if our doctor certifies that a long Journey is likely to endanger his life? I have received a fresh report of Baluchi activity and disturbances in Sistan. It is absolutely necessary that Hashmut should be removed from Sistan before Shaukat leaves \ for Tehran. Mustaufi should I again recommend be nominated from Tehran. Governor also wishes this. To-day my Russian Colleague informed me that he has been ordered to remain completely neutral.V Telegr ua - j . ?ron • lia Uni eaty's ^onnul for -intun and i.ain, •Jooratary to tha (rovormimt of in^ia in thfj *oroign ^eportnent.

They immediately wrote to ShouMat pointing out tne fact and are now drawing up a •diplomatic* answer. ShouMat declares that he has frequently reported that the arsenals ef Birjand and Seistan contain only 130 and 300 riflso rospootively and that tho ammunition is of no practical value whatever. On on# occasion he applied for leave to import rifloo from India* TheThe reply from the three jointly vill in all probability be to the effeet that they will enliet sen corresponding to quantity of arms In stoek; that they should be prorlded with more rifles, and that the establishment will be brought up to full power on receipt of the abowe after which they will promptly obey the telegram from Tehran. Shoukat can supplement the Oowemment stook of arms from his own armoury and raiso 200 or 250 men In a fortnight. He should. X think, be ordered to enlist as many men as he Is able In this way and then leawe at onee for Tehran. It Is unneoessary that the deputy Goto mo r or Hlssam should, at this juncture, bo personally associated with the entertainment of troops In Solstan. B&amp;rh&amp;d Par (of the t) two districts could quickly enlist men for all arms in stook under the supervision of the Belgian Director as he Is on the spot. The existing number of troops and the extent to which force can be inoreased will be reported in about three days time. Tour Sxeelleney will. I hope, recognise that telegraphic orders of a far more emphatic nature are required. Shoukat will without doubt go to Tehran, but it Is advisable that he should, before he starts, be allowed to see definite orders communicated to the Bevenue Department for the payment of troops. He puts forward as one of his grievances the fact that he has not received any pay for the expedition Bo Meh which he conducted last year. Xt Is very unlikely that HI seam will go to Tehran.

Wells situated between Sarhad and Sistan and Kainat and Tabas are few in number and far between.

This fact was pointed out to me by Hasir-i-Sultaneh hinself who however is not the man to conduct these operations as he is now Hashmat-ul-Mulk f 8 partisan. The despatch of Khudadad Khan Hashmat*^ulstalk's cousin last year to recover ISeh loot from their kinsmen was an experiment which proved a failure. It would be no less futile to expect either Purdil Khan, Khudadad Khan ff s enemy and the supporter of Deputy Governor to take serious action against the Sarhad, or to expect the Shoukat to assist in the degradation of his own kinsman Hashmat-ul-Kulk. In both oases they apprehend retribution in years to come. I firmly believe that we shall see no improvement in Sistan until a disciplined force is despatched from fileshed in command of Swedes firstly to arrest Eashnat-ul-Mulk and in the second place to chastise Khudadad Khan and blockade Sarhaddis.

Mease see O’Connor’s despatch No. 10 of 8 th July last; present situation is practically the same. “ Recent raid is the first this season, but, owing to its success and to meeting no opposition will be likely to be followed by others. Shaukut-ul-Mulk has very few men, and here, apart from the men of the local Baluchi sardar, there are also very few. bardars are said to be unwilling to assist authorities in suppressing raiders, probably they are personally interested, as some Seistan Baluchis took part m lecent laid. ^ Local authorities have received orders to recover loot, but, beyond fifty sowars being sent to Inceh, nothing has been done. Shaukut-ul-Mulk pleads helplessness owing to Persian Government not supplying sufficient money and arms, and wants us to help him. It is impossible to prove, but I think Hashmat-ul- Mulk is still implicated in the raids, and as long as he is in these parts and desirous of Ivamat governorship, it is unlikely that he will try to suppress them, as he probably hopes that on account of them Shaukut-ul-Mulk may be forced to resign. By removing Hashmat-ul-Mulk from these provinces and replacing him by governor who would co-operate with Shaukut-ul-Mulk, raids would be likely to cease. Unless stopped, raids will seriously affect trade between Indian and Eastern Persia, as trade of road passes through country affected. Birjand traders ask for British protection, and I believe many in Kainat and Seistan are contemplating doing the same. Some Baluchis have returned to Sarhad, but some are said to be still at Full details as to loot, Ac., not yet received owing to dislocation of postal service and difficulty of communication, as all roads are unsafe. “ (Sent to India.) ” ! ....... O 11 1 1 T' TO [514—488]This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] reporting on the recent development of Baluch raids in the Kainat and on the complicity of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in these disorders. I have not failed to make representations on the subject to the Persian Govern ment who assured me that they would remove the Hashmat-ul-Mulk from the scene of his activities as soon as they were strong enough to do so. I shall continue to press the matter upon their attention. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Consul O’Connor to Sir G. Barclaii. (No. 10.) Sir, Birjand, July 8 , 1911. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to my telegrams to your address Los. 53 and 54 dated the 7th July, 1911, reporting for your information the occurrence of riots in the town of Birjand, and of further raids committed by Baluchis in the Southern Kainat. These events, as you will no doubt surmise, are merely a continuation of the long series of disorders which have been in progress in these normally quiet provinces during the last eight or nine months. Their commencement was reported by Major McConaghey in his diary No. 41 for the week ending the 22 nd October, 1910, and a perusal of the Seistan diaries since that date will show how the evil has been gradually spreading and growing ever since. Since I took over the charge of this consulate on the 20 th December last, there have been a constant series of raids committed by both Sarhad and Seistan Baluchis in the southern and western districts of the Kainat, and during this interval some thousands of camels and sheep have been carried off, whole villages have been looted and destroyed, crops have been burnt, and a considerable number of women and children have been carried away to an ignominious and disgraceful captivity. It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that such an unfortunate state of affairs has had the very worst effects upon the general conditions prevailing in the two provinces constituting my consular charge. In the Kainat all sense of security has vanished. During my tour in the eastern districts in the spring, and since arrival here, I have been pestered by applications from various districts and communities for British protection. The inhabitants of the Sunnikhana district on the Afghan border are becoming restless and dissatisfied, and with a very little encouragement would throw themselves upon the protection of Afghanistan, whilst the wretched inhabitants of the southern and western districts are in a pitiable state of fright and destitution. Many hundreds of them have been robbed of every worldly possession they had ; their houses have been destroyed ; their crops burnt; and in some cases even their wives and children have been carried off In Seistan, too, the lawless elements have been much emboldened by their heavy booty, and by the perfect impunity with which it has been obtained, and free-booting has now become a popular and fashionable amusement. This state of affairs naturally reacts also on the public tranquillity of the town of Birjand, the capital of the province of Kaih. For although this town has not yet been actually threatened by the raiders, crowds of villagers keep pouring in with complaints and demands for redress and protection ; and the more turbulant of these may, and do, occasion breaches of the peace. I take for example the occurrence reported in my telegram No. 53 quoted above. As mentioned in my diary No. 25 for the week ending 24th June, a considerable PERSIA. [August 28.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 16. [33758] No. 1. (No. 150.) Sir, 150 ) ^ ^ to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 28.) lA/LlA/l t'C'/l'^ UTX. f i t j (A/O U ^ JL t/ -L _ • I HAVE the honour to transmit a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Seistan Gulahek, August 9, 1911 number of the Arab population of the Arab-khana district of the Kainat have been [2141 ee—16]2 streaming into Birjand during the course of the last two weeks, and have been joined by inhabitants of villages and districts further south. Some of these people, it is true, have no legitimate grounds of complaint beyond vague fears (I shall refer to this point again lower down), but their presence in Birjand has occasioned to the towns-people a sense of insecurity, and constantly threatens disturbances. On Wednesday last (otlO^ July) the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, hearing that these people were assembling in a threatening manner, sent the police and some of his own followers to disperse them. A free fight took place, during which two of the Arabs were killed and some twenty-four wounded ; and seven or eight of the governor’s men w r ere more or less seriously injured. Just as the trouble began, some of the Arabs came to the vice-consulate asking to be admitted; but Mr. Howson, who at that moment had no reason to believe that they were in any danger, refused to shelter them. Later, when he knew that they had been actively maltreated and fired on, he opened the gates of the vice-consulate, but by that time the fighting was over. The Russian doctor and our hospital assistant are now engaged in treating the wounded, and the trouble has subsided for the moment; but its causes still remain, and further disturbances may confidently be expected at any instant. Meanwhile, fresh reports have come in of a very serious raid committed near Aliabad by a band of 200 Baluchis, who have carried off several thousand sheep, 170 camels, several men, women, and children, and have completely destroyed two Nomad encamp ments, and killed two men. It would be idle to try to disguise the fact that a very serious and very disagree able state of affairs has come into existence during the last few months. An old inhabitant has informed me that it is thirty-seven years since the Baluchis last raided the Kainat, and certainly of recent years this province has been one of the quietest and most orderly in Persia. And I need not emphasise the consideration of how unfavourably such a situation must react upon our commerce with India. By dint of much exertion and heavy expenditure the Government of India has succeeded in creating a small trickle of trade from India to the eastern provinces of Persia via the Nushki route. The total amount is small, never having reached a total of 50,000L in one year ; but, such as it is, it is the result of the expenditure of large sums of money and of much individual exertion and enterprise, and its very existence, and small but healthy progress, testify to the constant tranquillity of the districts which lie on the Persian side of the border. This traffic is now seriously threatened by the existing state of affairs. Large consignments of goods which have recently been passing along the trade route from Nushki to the frontier station at Kuh-i-Malik Saih, have been lying at that place for some months as merchants are very naturally unwilling to entrust their wares to regions which lie absolutely at the tender mercies of marauding bands of Baluchi brigands. In my previous reports regarding these raids I have endeavoured to make it clear that they owe their origin simply and solely to the intrigues and rascality of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the son of the Hissam-ed-Dowleh (the present head of the old amir’s family), and the nephew of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Hissam-ed-Dowdeh, as will be remembered, was removed from the governorship of the Kakiat in September 1901), and given Seistan in exchange, whilst the Kainat was given to the Shaukat ul-Mulk. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk (who acts in reality as governor in his father’s name) bitterly resented this transference of power, and at first refused point blank to leave the Kainat, and nearly succeeded in creating serious riots in Birjand (see Seistan diaries for October, November, and December 1909). On first arrival in Seistan the Hashmat-ul-Mulk behaved himself tolerably well, though there is no doubt that he was from the first brooding over his supposed wrongs, and hatching plots for the overthrow of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk and for his own return to the Kainat. Soon after my arrival in Seistan last January I was made aware of the nature of these plots, and the evidence which I have since received of the Hashmat-ul- Mulk’ s complicity in the raids into the Kainat is overwhelmingly strong, and cannot be gainsaid or set aside. In fact his attitude and policy are matters of common talk all over these provinces, and are no doubt equally well understood at Tehran and Meshed. He, of course, hopes by discrediting the ShaukaSul-Mulk to have the latter dismissed from his governorship and to return here himself either as governor or as virtual governor under his old father. The plot is a sufficiently transparent and discreditable one, but up to date it has succeeded well enough. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who, it must be admitted, is neither a strong nor a capable man, has totally failed to hold the raiders in check, and is now openly reproached by his own people; and there is a strong and growing body of ill-feeling against him which may at any moment come to a head, and which is being openly fanned by the partisans of the Hissam-ed-Dowleh and the3 Hashmat-ul-Mulk. Such was to a great extent the cause of the recent disturbances in Birjand, for it is known that the Arabs (who had suffered no actual losses) were persuaded to come to Birjand by agents of the Hissam-ed-Dowleh, and whilst here they have been steadily incited to riot and to make complaints against their present 'overnor. Such is the present position of affairs, and it is to be feared that, if the Persian Government do not take some energetic steps to cope with it, matters will go from bad to worse. The mamur deputed from Tehran some months ago to enquire into the affairs of Seistan and the Kainat (the Nasr-es-Sultaneh) is now approaching Birjand, and should arrive here in a few days. On his arrival I propose to consult with him, and to endeavour to ascertain his opinions and what powers (if any) he may have to cope with the situation. But, whatever his views on the matter may be (and they will no doubt be influenced by considerations of a nature which appeal particularly to Persian officials), 1 venture to submit that the only solution for these difficulties is, in my opinion, the complete removal of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk from the scene of his activities. As long as he remains in Seistan, so long will tension exist and outrages continue ; whilst to permit him again to have any share in the governorship of the Kainat would be, after the experience of the last few months, to put a premium upon murder and highway robbery. In submitting this opinion, I do not underrate the difficulties with which the Persian Government has to deal, or their inherent weakness, especially at this distance from the capital. But at the same time 1 cannot think that the dismissal of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his deportation to Tehran or Meshed, is beyond the scope of their power and diplomacy. It is not for me to suggest methods for compassing his downfall, but various expedients peculiar to Persia in such crises will occur to any student of Persian history ; and after all, compared with a wealthy and powerful chief like the Kawam-ul-Mulk, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is only a third-rate rascal, and his removal should present no insurmountable difficulty. And it should also be borne in mind that at least half the country would support the Shaukat-ul-Mulk as soon as it was seen that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk was in trouble, and that effective pressure could at any moment be brought to bear upon the Hissam-ed-Dowleh should his son prove recalcitrant or threaten to turn “yaghi ” In the event of the old man himself (and it is scarcely likely) continuing to intrigue after his son’s removal, it would be necessary to take steps to render him innocuous also. But as he is old, feeble, and lazy, it should not be very difficult to coerce or frighten him into good behaviour. In the interests of peace and quiet, then, and for the sake of our commerce and the tranquillity of our border, I would venture to urge that the Persian Government should be moved to take some energetic measures to bring to book the Hashmat-ul- Mulk. With his downfall and disappearance from the scene these Baluchi raids would, I believe cease automatically ; and if they did not at once stop, a very small expenditure and some display of resolution would soon suffice to bring them to an end. The distance from the Sarhad, and the nature of the intervening country, would render the operations of the Sarhad Baluchis difficult and dangerous should the governors of Seistan and the Kainat agree to work together in opposing them ; and as to the Seistan Baluchis, not a man would dare to move a yard towards the Kainat were he not openly encouraged to do so by his own governor. As to the future governorships of these provinces, should the Persian Government decide to retain the present hereditary rulers, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk might very well be retained in the Kainat, and the Hissam-ed-Dowleh’s second son, Sartib Muhammad Resa Khan, appointed to Seistan. Neither of them are strong men, but they are at any rate quiet and law-abiding, and there, is no reason to suppose that they could not, as in the past, carry out their duties in a sufficiently satisfactory manner.
