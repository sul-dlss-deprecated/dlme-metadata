I enclose herewith translation of a letter received from the 8ultan of ’fiiscat on this subject. I had already addressed His Highness on the master and his reply embodies the Wali of Gwadur’s report of the Persian Consul’s visit. 2 . \1hilst unfortunately no one asked for the individual’s passport, the Sultan definitely states tftat he was neither eonsulted, nor did he authorise the visit to his state territory. 3 . The ‘Tali knows nothing further than what is contained in his report to the Sultan, 'he British Agent however received a telegram from ^ [f]t •&lt; apprising him of the Consul’s visit and requesting him to 'afford all assistance, 'his telegram arrived however the day after the Consul had left for Jiwani. 4. The Persian Consul apparently did nothing in Muscat territory but the British Agent has reliable evidence of his activities in British Baluchistan i.e. in the Jiwani directic 5. Here he met countless Persian-Baluch refugees whom he tried in vain to persuade to return to PersieJi territory. Neither' threats nor blandishments produce* the slightest result, the Baluchis refusing to be duped by aethods already too well known to them. 6. ‘Thilat at Jiwani the Persian Consul state' that Jiwani was formerly Persian territory and he is said to have asked the local representative of the fhan of Palat as to the circumstances un* er which it had now become British.7.

He was enquiring about ths Persian subjects who have left their country and the reason of their departure. He was also enquiring as to how Jiwani which belonged to Persia in olden days became a British possession. He called on me and asked whether the treaties which exist between Persia and the Government of the Bultan of HUscat are old or new and whether there is any thing in writing . '• : li to show the date of their conclusion. I told him that I do not know anything, that there must be something in writing if there is any treaties between the two Governments and that he should better find out from his own Government.
