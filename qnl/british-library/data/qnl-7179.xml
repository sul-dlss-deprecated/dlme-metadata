Other common crops are beans, sesame, linseed, musk-melons and water-melons. Owing to the un certainty of the rainfall in recent years, cultivators in the Hindiyan district have adopted the practice of storing the grain of one season in large mud receptacles outside their houses until the pros pects of the next crop are assured. Each village possesses a due complement of donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats besides a few mares, and in the wet tract at the head of the district there are some herds of buffaloes. Grain is sold by weight. The unit of land-measurement is the Gao. ^Va^.—The only exports of value are grain and wool, which leave the district in considerable quantities. Horse breeding is oil the decline, notwithstanding the facilities for it which exist, and the stamp of animal produced is not saleable in the Bombay market. The im ports consist of the ordinary necessities and simple luxuries which the district does not produce. There are no local manufactures. The Hindiyan Village Man is equal to about 240, and the Dill Mulla Man to about 247^ lbs. avoirdupois English. \ Communications. —The plains of the district present no obstacles td moveihent of man or beast except such as arise from their being slippery after rain and waterless at other times. The principal routes are dealt with in the general article on 'Arabistan. The supplies and transport available can be gauged by means of the village list in the article on the Hindiyan Eivier and of the remarks oh agriculture above. Administration. —The Hindiyan district is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who has officials representing him at Hindiyan Village aiid Dih Mulla. The tenure on which he holds it has not been precisely ascertained. The revenue is fluctuating and is assessed at so many Tumans per Gao of actual cultivation. In 1905 the revenue of the Dih Mulla neighbourhood was farmed for 5,000 Tumans and the revenue of the test of the district for 18,000 Tumans; this Was an enhancement on former years and has not been realised without hardship and oppression* The Imperial Persian Customs have posts at Hindiyan Village and at Tuwaisheh near the coast.732 HIND IT AN DISTRICT Antiquities. —In the 10th century the Hindiyan district contained the remains of fire temples and some water wheels of ancient construc tion ; and at one time the Ismailians had strongholds in the adjoining hills.* A local tradition current at the present day, that the Portuguese once held the district, receives some support from the facts that the name of ' Purgal ' is still recognised, and that there are traces of buildings and several old iron guns of the usual Portuguese type at Dih Mulla. Dih Mulla may perhaps have been a Portuguese factory, the river being then navigable above Hindiyan Village as it was, to some extent, as late as 1836. HINDIYAN Headwaters.~~'N early always pronounced 'Hindiyun,' and sometimes tjjJui) spelt Hindijan This river is formed by the junction in the plain of Zaidan (generally pronounced Zaitun), at a point 22 miles E/IVER north by west from Dllam on the coast, of two streams, the Khairabad or Ab Shirm and the Shulistan or Ah Shur both from the eastward: to the mediaeval Arab geographers the entire Hindiyan river appears to have been known as the Shirm.* The more northern of the two confluents, the Khairabad, is sweet; it is said to take its name from a ruined settlement upon its right bank a few miles above its junction and to rise in a high range of mountains in the country of the Kuhgalu Lurs. In its course the Khairabad gathers to itself the water of several other streams, of which the chief are the Zuhreh and the Kumbal lW ' . The Shulistan, which has bittei- water, is stated to have its origin in a mass of hills to the west of the Kazarun-Shiraz road; these were formerly, it is stated, inhabited by a tribe called Shul but have now been occupied for some centuries by the Mamasani Lurs. The Shulistan like the Khairabad river, has several tributaries, and one of these, the Shashpir jtf, which comes down from the north of Shiraz, is exceedingly bitter, strongly impregnating the Shulistan and even affecting the Hindiyan but not in such a degree as to make its water undrinkable. Even at the driest season of the year the Khairabad and Shulistan are both considerable streams with a breadth, at their junction, of 25 yards and a shingly bottom. * See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate*HINDITAN RIVER 733 Xjpper course in the Zaid an district, —The upper course of the river formed by their union is generally known by the name of Zaidan not of Hindiyan, and may betaken as extending- from Haidar Karar a small Imamzadeh situated on the tongue of land between the Khairabad and the Shulistan ; to the border of the Hindiyan District^ where it , issues from the hills ; in other words the length of this section is about 80 miles and its direction is from east-south-east to west-north-west, Here the Zaidan flows with a breadth of about 70 yards and a strong current of 3| miles an hour through the Zaidan plain, a valley 5 miles wide, governed from Behbehan and enclosed between a northern and a southern range of hills : the former called Kuh Zaidan has an elevation of about 1;500 feet and the latter, which is the subsidiary maritime range forming the inland boundary of the Liravi district and for that reason sometimes called Kuh Liravi ; of about 1 ; 000. The caravan route from Dilam to Behbehan crosses the river near Cham Zaidan, where there are two or three fords : the bottom there is shingly and good, but the strength of the current necessitates care in crossing with laden animals.

Opposite Lanjlr the river throws off from its right bank an artificial canal, -which, circling round to the west-north-west and then to the west- south-west passes the villages of Cham Charateh, Upper Cargari, Lower Gargari and Asyab and reaches Suwaireh ; near the last it is absorbed byniNDITAN RIVEK 735 numerous arn ^ distributaries when on the point of rejoining the parent stream. lower course in the Eindiyan District, —The lower course of the river in the Hindiyan District begins between the Behbehan village of Gholeh and the Hindiyan village of Shirabad, where the stream, turning the north end of some hills, emerges on the open plains of the Hindiyan District. From Shirabad it runs first for 5 miles west -north-westwards to Suwaireh; it then turns, and its average direction from Suwaireh to Hindiyan Village, a distance of 22 miles in a straight line, is due southwards. At Hindiyan Village its course becomes winding; and, after all but reaching the sea at a place 10 miles south- south-west of Hindiyau Village, it meanders due westwards for another 9 miles, keeping within two or three miles of the coast the whole way, and eventually attains the Persian Gulf at a point 16 miles south west of Hindiyan Village as the crow flies but double that distance from it by water. At its embouchure the Hindiyan cuts its way through mud-flats and its mouth is difficult to discover from seawards owing to the lowness of the coast. Characteristics in the Hindiydn 'Above Suwaireh the Hindiyan is broken up into more than one channel;; but from Suwaireh downwards it flows in a single bed, having high banks and a nearly constant width of about 60 yards until past Hindiyan Village, where the breadth varies from 70 to 100 yards. The bottom from the beginning of the Hindiyan District till 6 miles below Suwaireh is shingly, and thence to the sea it is of hard mud. The water of the Hindij an, as already observed, is drinkable, but impregnated with a salt or alkali brought down by the Shulistan which gives it a bitter taste yet does not prevent the lathering of soap. In winter the river flows with a strong current throughout its course. From Gargari to a point 6 miles below Suwaireh there is irrigation by means of Jubs or water-cuts taking off from various natural branches of the river. The country on both sides of the river consists of featureless plains which the stream, except near the north end of the district, has not been utilised to irrigate. Here and there are patches of musk and water melons in the actual bed, but the banks bear nothing except an occa sional tamarisk until a fine grove of tall date trees belonging to Tuwai- sheh is reached near the river mouth. The banks for the last 2 oi 3 miles before reaching the sea are covered with bulrushes,736 HINDIYAN RIYER Riverside villages in the Hindiyan District, —The following is a table of the villages on or near the Hindiyan river from Gargari down wards :— Name.

HINDIYAN Locally pronounced Hindiyun ; the principal place in the Hindiyan .boU District, situated on both banks of the Hindiyan River at a point 16 VILLAGE* miles north-west of its mouth; the position has recently been deter mined as 30° 14' 24' north and 49° 43 / S 7 east. The population is about 1,000 souls and consists of Qanawatis, Sharifat, Hayad ^ and Ka'ab Arabs of the Sha'abani section, the last predominating. The people are cultivators of grain, boatmen and traders, and they possess some 20 horses, 300 cattle, 500 donkeys and 1,000 sheep and goats. Ophthalmia is prevalent among them. Vessels from Kuwait, Bushehr, Bahrain and Lingeh come up the river to Hindiyan, and there is a con siderable exportation of wheat, barley, wool and live sheep, also a smaller one of oak bark, sesame and ghi. The bazaar contains 30 shops. Forty years ago only the portion of the village on the right bank was subject to the Ka'ab Shaikh; but now the whole, like the rest of the district, is under the Shaikh of Mnhammareh. An agent on the part of the Shaikh has his residence at Hindiyan village and collects taxes on shops and on all transactions in grain and wool. The Persian Imperial Customs have a post here which is reported to produce 18,000 Tumans a year. There is no telegraph, but postal communication is maintained with Behbelian and Bushehr by the Persian Post Office. Singular Harithi .

Site and surroundings, —The site of the town is rocky but low ; it appears to be only a little higher than the waterlogged country whichHOFtTF 745 adjoins it. The space covered by buildings is described as oblong, with a length from north to south of 1 to miles and a breadth of J a mile. The land to the south of the town is waste and quickly merges in the desert : on the other three sides cultivation and date groves, which are densest on the northern and eastern sides, approach close to the walls. The springs of Haqal, Umm-al-Jamal, Kbadud, Umm-al-Lif, Qasaibah, Luwaimi and Barabar, described in the article on the Hasa Oasis, all rise within a mile of the eastern side of Hofuf, and those of Umm Kharaisan and of Bahair and Bahairiyah adjoin respectively its northern and western faces. A few hundred yards to the south-east of the town are a large well and a group of gardens called Suwaidarah Graveyards closely surround the town upon most sides, especially on the east, south-east and north-west. Quarters and buildings, —Hofuf is divided into 3 large wards, of which the names are Kut oy or Kut-al-Hofuf, Eifa'ah ^ and Na'athil JjUj , Kut, which forms the north-western corner of the town, is really a large fortified enclosure with sides about 600 yards long and completely surrounded by a ditch ; it is inhabited by the Turkish troops, the Turkish official community, and others. It contains a fine Sunni mosque having a dome and called for that reason Qubbah ^ , also another good building which is used as a military hospital, and a couple of forts which are mentioned further on among the defences of the town. On the east side of the Kut, at the north end of the town, is a market place with a Qaisariyah or arcade of shops. On the south of the Kut, between it and the next quarter, is a date plantation. The Rifa'ah quarter forms the entire eastern side of the town ; it is healthier and somewhat higher than the others, and in it are the residences of a number of the better families Na'athil includes the southern and western parts of the town and is, in extent, a good half of the place ; it is inhabited promiscuously by all classes. As already mentioned, it is separated from Kut by a date grove * and within its limits are enclosed occasional gardens and a few trees, the latter chiefly figs and citrons. The principal mosque of Hofuf, which belongs to the Shi'ah sect and is probably the largest mosque in Eastern Arabia, is in Na'athil, Kut is said to contain about 1,200, Rifa/ah about 2,100 and Na'athil about 1,700 houses. The housesi of Hofuf are flat-roofed and are mostly built of stone and mud, and plastered with gypsum mortar ; some of those in the Rifa'ah quarter are tolerably good and even handsome, with arches entering intoHOFtTF their architecture. Nearly every House possesses a private well about 4 fathoms deep. The [streets, except 2 main avenues, are narrow and filthy. The whole town has 8 gates, of which a, called Bab-ash-Shamal JUtJI and Bab-ash-Sharq (3/JI belong to the Kut. Hofuf is enclosed by a thin wall of sun-dried bricks and clay ; it is only about feet high and has now no ditch, as it once had, upon its outer side. At the north-western corner of the town the place of this wall is taken by the northern and western walls of the Kut, which are continuous with it but twice as high. The principal military work is the Kut, which forms one of the quarters of the town and has been partially described in that character : the Kut comprises the chief citadel, known as Kut-al-Hisar oy and 2 minor structures styled Qasr-al-Qubbah and Qasr-al-^Abid jaoj , Qasr-al- Qubbah has the alternative name of Qasr Ibrahim and Qasr-al-''Abid serves the purpose of a jail as well as of a fort, These smaller fortifications are surrounded by moats, now dried and choked up with rubbish. The only detached work is Qasr-al-Khazam ^Iysr J l a fort situated a few hundred yards from the west side of the town and having the Turkish cemetery immediately to the south of it. The military garrison of the Kut is reported to consist of two squadrons of cavalry, one battery of mule guns and one battalion of infantry ; and that of Qasr-al-Khazam appears to be a quarter of a battalion of infantry. There are besides one hundred unmounted Dhabitiyahs on duty at Qasr-al-'Abid and 26 mounted men of the same corps in Qasr-al-Khazam. A military band performs in the afternoons i this is the only recreation of the garrison. InhabitanUs —The total population of Hofuf is estimated at about ^5,000 souls. The people are a mongrel race and are not divided into any well ascertained tribes, nor are there many foreign immigrants among them. Genuine Persians are not found, but there are a fair number of Arabs from Najd; most of the latter are shopkeepers and camel -owners, but some of them are proprietors of date plantations. There are said to be in the Rifa'ah quarter some 50 families descended from the Ja ; far section of the Shammar tribe. About three-fourths of the people are Sunnis ; the rest, with the exception of a few Wahhabis, are Shi'ahs, There are 2 large Sunni schools called Madrasat Shaikh Abu Bakr and Madrasat Shaikh ; Abdul Latif, at both of which boys from Bahrain, Masqat and other distant places are received and educated. The principal Shi ah schoolshokmtjz island U7 are those of Shaikhs Muhammad-bin-''Abtan ; 'Amran-bin-Hasan, Musa- abu-Khamsin and Muhammad-bin-Shaikh Husain. Trade and manufactures. —Under normal conditions there is a con siderable trade with Riyadh in Najd whence ghi is received at Hofuf and to which cloth ; sugar and rice are sent in return. Before the recent wars in Najd the number of caravans coming into Hofuf from Riyadh, was on the average about one a week. Bedouinsirom all the surrounding country supply their wants at Hofuf ; and a general market is held every Thursday in an open space outside the town upon the north side which is called the Suq-al-Khamis ^ ju .^1 \ * but local trade is mostly carried on in private houses. Hofuf is celebrated for the manufacture of elegant ''Abas, richly embroidered with golden or coloured thread, and of brass coffee pots of curious shape which are exported as far as Basrah and Masqat* Administration. —Hofuf is the civil and military capital of the w r hole Hasa Sanjaq ; it is also the headquarters of the Hasa Q-adha and of the Hofuf Nahiyah, Tor purposes of internal administration it is con stituted as a municipality. The north point of this island, the site of the celebrated Ormuz HORMUZ of former times &gt; is situated 11 miles east-south-east of Bandar 'Abbas and 4 miles south of the nearest part of the Persian mainland; the ISLAND t mouth of Khur Minab is distant from it 19. miles due eastward. Hormuz island is nearly circular in shape with a diameter of 4| to 5 miles. The coast is free from pronounced indentations and the only promontory is the northern point, already mentioned, which is low and fiat and projects nearly a mile from the general body of the island, its width across its base being also about a mile. The passage between Hormuz and the mainland navigable for vessels of moderate draft is only a mile wide, and its depth, which at the narrowest part of the * A view of the Suq-al-Khamis accompanies Herr H.

A general report on Hormuz by Lieutenant V. Hunt is contained in the Foreign Proceedings of the Qovernment of India for May 1901.HORMtjTZ ISLAND strait is 10 fathoms, diminishes to 4 and even 3| at the end towards Bandar 'Abbas. The island, except at its northern and southern extremities, is surrounded by a belt of shoal water of considerable width Except for the flat promontory on the north side and a strip of fairly level ground, half a mile to a mile in width, which follows the eastern shore, Hormuz is covered with jagged hills of brilliant and variegated hues. The dominant colour is a reddish-purple largely streaked with white, while the principal geological ingredients are rock-salt, red ochre and a greenish, very adhesive clay. The hills are on the average over 300 feet in height and one peak in the centre reaches 690 feet, All the ravines, and indeed whole valleys, in the interior of the island are incrusted with salt and present the appearance of being lightly powdered with snow. Upon the banks of the ravines are pure white saline incrustations varying in thickness from 3 to 12 inches and some of the ravines, in breadth from 6 to 15 feet, are spanned by natural bridges of salt strong enough to support a man. Hormuz is almost perfectly barren j its aspect of all but metallic sterility is relieved only by a few stunted Kunar trees and some patches of barley on the plain near Hormuz Village. A few gazelle are the only- natural fauna. There is no permanently inhabited place on the island except Hormuz Village which, with its population, is described in a separate article; in that place also will be found some remarks on trade and resources. Here it may be added that of copper, specular iron ore, red oxide of iron and salt existing on the island only the last two are worked. The supplies and transport which the island affords only suffice for the needs of the inhabitants, and the quantity of sweet water available, chiefly rain water collected in reservoirs, is strictly limited, Vegetables and fodder are practically unavailable. The revenue of Hormuz is at present farmed by the Mu ^m-ut-Tujjar of Tehran from the Persian Government for 14,000 Tumans a year, and the island is consequently regarded as under his jurisdiction; but the political control is vested in the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The representative of the Mu ^in -ut -Tuj jar is a resident agent by whom the taxes are collected ; these are general revenue, a royalty on the red oxide workings (which are called Ganj or Galak), and a sort of poll tax on the miners. The agent has a salary of 50 Tumans a month, besides perquisites arising from the salvage of wrecks, etc., and he is responsible for the entire administration of the island. The present agent is a Persian, Mirza Khalil, whose father was at one time employed in theHORMtrz ISLAND 749 British Eesidency at Bushehr as a munshi. The Deputy-Governor of Bandar 'Abbas sometimes seeks to interfere in Hormuz affairs in the name of his master, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, the usual pretext being complaints of oppression or the wreck of a native boat. The Persian Government are represented by an Inspector of the Imperial Customs Department. The simple topography of Hormuz Island is summed up in the table below ; — Name of place. Position.

There is a well here 40 feet deep with water which is fairly good but slightly bi-Hckish. There are also ruins of what appears to have been a small town. The name Hormuz belonged originally to a town on the mainland, situated probably upon Khur Minab, but, though the town was abandoned about 1315 A.D. only, the ruler transferring his seat to the island^ the latter also appears to have borne the name of Urmuz or Urmus as early50 HOKMtrZ ISLAND as the tHh century A.D. At the time of the transfer of government, however, the island appears to have heen generally known as Jirun or Zarun. Probably about the 14th century A.D. the island oE Hormuz supplanted Qais as the principal trade emporium of the Persian Gulf, just as Qais had supplanted Siraf.* HOEMUZ The only inhabited place on the island of Homuz and the sole jyyb remaining vestige of the once celebrated city of Ormuz. The village is VILLAGE situated on the neck of the northern promontory, between the Portuguese fort at its extremity and the ruins of the ancient city upon its landward side. The place consists of about 200 houses, and the popula. tion may rise, while the salt and oside mines are being actively worked, to 1 300 souls ; but it falls in summer to less than half that number in consequence of emigration to the mainland, especially to Minab, due to the heat and the prospects of employment in the date harvest. Persians predominate, many of them being natives of Bashakard and Rudbar; but there are also Baluchis and Arabs who have long since forgotten to what tribes their ancestors belonged. The proportions of the mixture are roughly indicated by the fact that about frd of the population is Shi'ahas against ird Sunni. The inhabitants of Hormuz village are mostly sailors, fishermen and miners; they are reported to own 8 large Mashuwahs, 6 Baqarahs and 1 Ghunchah, with an aggregate burthen of 620 tons and employing 172 hands. The ordinary anchorage at Hormuz is half a mile to the east of the Portuguese fort, where the bottom is of mud and the depth of water from 4 to 5 fathoms. A little barley is grown on the plain near the village ; there are hardly any date palms. A few reservoirs exist for the storage of rain water and there are some wells yielding brackish water, A Qadamgah of merely local importance stan s 1 mile south of the village. The village is the seat of the Persian agent , who governs the island in the name of the Mu in-ut Tujjai.

( R aja D een D ayal &amp; S ons. )HUSAINlYAH (ISTAHR-AL-) 751 A large canal in Turkish 'Iraq ; it takes off from the right bank of the Euphrates at Musaiyib and runs to Karbala Town where it divides into two branches. The construction of the Husainiyah is said to have been undertaken by order of the Ottoman Sultan Sulaiman I during his residence at Baghdad in 1544 A.D.; but it is known that the date groves of Karbala were already irrigated from the Euphrates in the ] 4th century of the Christian era. Course and hranches. —The original head of the Husaimyah was above Musaiyib, and a brick bridge still spans the former bed of the canal close to the west side of the town ; the present head is 2 miles below Musaiyib. The course of the canal is at first towards the south-west; but at 7 miles it changes to west-south-west, a direction which it preserves thereafter until Karbala Town is reached at 18 miles from its head. For the first few miles there is little cultivation on either bank; but it rapidly increases as Khan-al-'Ataishi is approached. Kncin-al-'Ataishi , by Persians called Khan Atishi ^.*1 u Ll ) is a dilapidated caravansarai standing on a mound 100 yards from the right bank of the Husaimyah at 10 miles below its head; it is a square enclosure with sides about 80 yards long and a cir cular bastion at each of the 4 corners. A mile or two beyond Khan-al-^Ataishi begin the dense date:plantations of Karbala Town ; in the midst of these is reached, at 15 miles, a brick bridge known as the Pul-i-Sufaid oaiuw JL&gt; •• y which crosses the canal. Three miles beyond this bridge the Husaimyah passes the north side of Karbala Town and divides, at the north-western corner of the same, into 2 branches. One of these runs off in the direction of the tomb of Hurr, about 3| miles north-west of the town: it # uu is called the Rashdiyah and is much larger than the other. After running for some distance to the north-west it turns to the south west and approaches Razazah upon its east side; in this reach it has the land called Qnrtah, inhabited by the Yasar tribe, upon its right bank: it then turns southwards and ends in a marsh called Hor Abu Dibis at a little distance from Razazah. The other branch, known as the tSanauliyah ^0.1x4 circles round Karbala Town upon its western side and then turning southwards runs to the Hor-al-Husainiyah, or Hor-as-Sulaimamyah as it is also called froln a village which is de scribed m the article on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah. The waste w.ater from the Husaimyah, in the neighbourhood of Karbala Town, generally goes to form this Hor-al-Husaimyah, which is fed also by the Shatt-al- Hindiyah. The Hor is a large lake or open swamp on which water fowl may be seen floating, and it causes the Karbala-Tawairij HUSAIN- IYAH (NAHR- AL-) j752 HUSAINlTAH (NAHR-AL-) road to be deflected to the north at a point about 3 miles from Karbala Town. Dimensions. —The width of the Husaimyah at its mouth upon the Euphrates is only about 30 feet, but at about J of a mile from the in take it has increased to 45 feet, and at this place the water runs about 4 feet deep in winter and the channel is filled by it from bank to bank. The Husaimyah branch which goes towards the tomb of Hurr is 24 feet wide and has banks 20 feet high at its entrance, and the stream in it runs about 12 feet wide and 3 feet deep in winter. The Hanaidiyah branch is about 20 feet wide near Karbala Town, and the top of the banks is about 25 feet above the level of the bed but the flow of water in it in winter is only about 4 feet broad by 1 foot deep. From June to November the whole Husaimyah canal is practically dry. Navigation and communications. —The Husaimyah canal is navi gable for vessels of as much as 400 sacks 3i burden down to the Pul- i-Sufaid ; but, the current being slack, the voyage from the Euphrates to this place may take as much as 10 hours in the absence of a favour able wind. The Husainiyah is spanned in 3 places by bridges fit for the passage of field guns. The uppermost |bridge is the Pul-i-Sufaid, or White Bridge, 3 miles from Karbala, which is a high-arched construction in brick with a roadway about 20 feet wide ; it is now in bad repair. The next is the Qantarat Bab Baghdad or Baghdad Gate Bridge, 2 miles nearer to Karbala ; it is similar in design and materials to the first, but is at present in good repair and is used by vehicles plying between Karbala and Musaiyib ; it leads from the right bank of the canal into the town of Karbala. The third is a curious double bridge at the place where the Bashdiyah and Hanaidiyah branches of the canal separate. This last bridge, of which the head on the southern bank of the canal is about 100 yards from the town wall,—an enclosed garden intervening,— is built so as to cover the whole trijunction of the canal and its 2 branches^ and it has thus 3 entrances or exits ; it is in fairly good repair and able to carry carts as well as foot passengers. The Husainiyah, where it lies across the travellers route, is an inconvenient obstacle ; for the banks are high, perhaps 15 feet on an average, and descend very steeply to the stream. Near villages, however, they are often ramped, and at such places a Quffah also can generally be obtained to ferry passengers and baggage across ; but transport0 HUSHtJM 753 animals must be unloaded and swum. In some parts deep, narrow, unbridged distributaries make the left bank difficult for mounted men to follow. Cultivation and population.—^hQ cultivation upon the upper part of the canal is chiefly of cereals. The date plantations which begin as Karbala is approached present a remarkable contrast to the well-ordered groves of Basrah Town, for the trees are of all ages and irregularly spaced as if self-sown; nevertheless they are valuable and productive. Villages of the Mas'ud tribe, built of thorns and matting, are sprink led along the banks the whole way from the Euphrates to Karbala ; while here and there is to be seen the more solidly built enclosure of a Shaikh, having towers at the corners for defence. At one place between Khan-al-'Ataishi and the Pul-i-Sufaid the hamlets are so thickly set as almost to form a continuous settlement.

In English at one time known as 'Owhale'. A deserted town' on the east coast of Qatar about midway between Dhakhirah and the extremity of the peninsula. There are numerous wells in the vicinity, 2 miles inland from the sea, but the water is of indifferent quality. Before Zubarah and Dohah rose to importance, Huwailah was the chief town of Qatar. It is believed that the inhabitants were originally A1 Musallam, who were expelled by the Shaikhs of Bahrain, and that thereafter they were A1 Bin 'All up to about 1850. HTJWA- LAH a) dJjJb or HULAH Singular Holi ^ • A class of Slllini Arabs foulld in Bahrain, Hasa, Qatar and Trucial 'Oman, and on the island of Sirri ; they are a community who, after being domiciled for years or even generations on the Persian coast of the Gulf, have returned whether as individuals or groups to the Arabian side; the name of u Huwalah' is not one acquired by them during their sojourn in Persia, but has been conferred on them by the Arabs among whom they settled on their return to Arabia. D ivino n s. —M any of the Huwalah are unable to say from which of the Arab tribes they are descended. Some claim to be Bani TanillU and others to be Maraziq. As Huwalah they have no tribal institutions or organisation, but it is observed that they intermarry freely among themselves. They are not divided into sections properly so called, but some of them form groups named after a common ancestor, more or less remote, or after the place from which they have come ; such are the Al Bu Fakhru ^ group, to which a fourth of the Huwalah settled at Dohah ^in Qatar belong, and the group of the Kashkunariyah J who are said to have immigrated from a place Kashkunar, situated in Gabandi in Persia, inland of the Shibkuh coast. It is uncertain whether the Mahandah and Sulutah, who have preserved their tribal character though according to some accounts they lived for a time in Persia, should be classed as Huwalah or not. The Bani Malik of Qatar, other than the Slllutah, are always ranked among the Huwalah. Heligion and character, —The Huwalah are, as already indicated, all Sunnis ; but some belong to the Maliki and some to the Shafi i schoo for the sect. They have altogether lost their fighting instincts and areHUZtTM 755 entirely given up to commerce, the handicrafts and other moneys making pursuits, some on a large and some on a humble scale. Numhen anddislrihifion.—ln Bahrain Huwalah are found at Halat-bin-Anas, 10 houses; Budaiya', 50 houses; Hadd, 20 houses; Manamah, 1,000 houses; and Muharraq Town, 2 ,000 houses. In Qatar there are 300 houses of Huwalah at Dohah and an equal number at Wakrah ; and in Turkish territory a few, chiefly artisans, are found at the towns of Hofuf and Qatif. Those of Trucial 'Oman are 300 house holds and are all settled at Sharjah Town; while those of Sirri, numbering 30 families, are said to be immigrants from Trucial Oman. The total number of Huwalah in the part of Arabia where they are called by this name may be roughly estimated at 18,000 souls. Name, Vernacular equivalent. Position.

IBRA or BIRA The largest town in the Sharqiyah district of the 'Oman Sultanate; it lies partly in that portion of the district which is called Baldan-al- Hirth and partly in that which is known as Baldan -al-Masakirah and it is situated almost exactly half way between the two ends of Sharqiyall about 35 miles east-south-east of Samad. The drainage of Ibra goes south-eastwards by Wadi Ibra to Ja'alan and thence to the sea, and tlie hills of Eastern Hajar are distant from the town, on the north and east^ about 25 miles. The town stands in a well cultivated area bearing dates, fruits and cereals and measuring several miles in length and breadth: this oasis is studded with villages of the Masakirah and Hirth. Ibra is divided into two main quarters, viz., the 'Alayah or upper town on the north and east, inhabited by Masakirah, and the Sifalah'IBRI 757 or lower town on the south, occupied by Hirth : the separate bazaars of these two quarters are about half an hour^s walk apart. The 'Alajah is unwalled; it comprises over 300 houses, mostly of mud and gypsum-stucco, with a few huts and a bazaar of some 30 shops. The number of houses in the Sifalah is over 500, and many of them are excellent, resembling 1 those of Masqat Town. The entire 'Alayah consists of various small wards which are dispersed in all directions; but a part of the Sifalah, called Manzafah is walled and boasts a bazaar of 60 shops, besides a large fort on which some guns are mounted. The other wards of the Sifalah, namely, Subakh &gt; Ahl Sinau and Ma^taradh stand at a few minutes■ , distance apart from one another. The whole population of Ibra may be estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 persons of whom the majority are Hirth. Silk and cotton, imported from India through Masqat Town, are woven into cloth at Ibra : this is a profitable industry and almost the only one exercised. Livestock are 10 horses, 300 camels, 800 donkeys, 600 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. Date palms are estimated at the large figure of 100,000. A considerable town, the largest ih the Dhahirah district of the Oman Sultanate ; it is situated 37 miles south-south-east of Dhank Town and 50 miles west by north of Bahlah in ; 0man Proper. The elevation of 'Ibri is 1,180 feet above s6a-level: it stands in Wadi Sanaisal and is adjoined by Salaif in Wadi-al -^Ain which practically forms a suburb. ''Ibri is enclosed, except on the south, by hills rising from 300 to 400 feet above the plain at a short distance from the town. The bazaar and dwellings of the poorer classes form a compact block surrounding the fort; but the houses of the wealthier mnabitants are dispersed and lost to view in a sea of date groves, the most extensive, probably, in 'Oman except those of Wadi Samail and containing perhaps 50,000 palms. Fruit, cereals and grass are largely cultivated, both amidst the date plantations and in the open space beyond them. Livestock are estimated at 30 horses, 400 camels, 300 donkeys, 500 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. 'Mbri contains one of the largest Jami' mosques in 'Oman. The population of the town is estimated at 5,000 persons, of whom at least 3,500 belong to the Ya'aqib tribe and some of the remainder to the Bani Kalban. The bazaar is large and good, containing all the commodities for which there is a demand among Arabs.Sft % • r 'IDAN 758 'IB EI Dates, mangoes, limes, apricots, peaches, and figs are exported; but the principal local industry is indigo-dyeing. Blacksmiths, carpenters and other artisans are to be found here; also goldsmiths. In 1885 ; Ibri enjoyed the reputation of being a thieves^ market for all 'Oman; at that time all plunder from Batinah or 'Oman Proper was brought here for disposal by auction, but this has now ceased to be the case. An Arab tribe of Turkish 'Iraq having their headquarters upon the Shatt-al-' Arab immediately below Basrah; the right bank villages from Basrah down to Labani are mostly in their occupation, and they hold almost exclusive possession of the upper half of 'Ajairawiyah island together with the left bank villages on the mainland which are abreast of the same. The ; Idan are found also at Kataiban and some other- villages on the left bank of the river above Basrah and some are settled at Dorah towards the mouth of u the river, not far above Fao. With the 'Atub and the Qatarnah they are the principal constituent of the mixed population of the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab generally; and indeed it may be said that they are found almost everywhere on both banks of the river above and below Basrah Town. A large number of the tribe have recently emigrated from Turkish to Persian territory in order to escape conscription for military service by the Turkish Government; these have mostly been enrolled by the Shaikh of Muhammareh as members of the Muhaisin tribe and have been settled by him as cultivators at Qasbeh on 'Abbadan island and elsewhere. In religion the ; Idan are Shi'ah; and by profession, like most of the tribes upon the Shatt-al -'Arabj they are almost as much robbers as agriculturists. Their principal Shaikh resides either on Jazirat-al-'Ain opposite to Kut-al -Farangi above Basrah, or at Kibasi-as-Saghir on the mainland adjoining that island.

Willcocks, whom he found at Baghdad and by whom he was supplied with valuable information relating to the rivers Euphrates and Tigris and to the irrigation160 'IRAQ (TURKISH) and Tigris —tbe richest and most valuable in the whole basin of the Persian Gulf—which is comprised in the Turkish Wilayats or provinces of Baghdad and Basrah. In British official terminology Turkish'Iraq^ with the addition of the more northern Wilayat oi: Musal i s coDYenlionally known as 'Turkish Arabia but the expression is an unfortunate one, for it obviously suggests the Red Sea provinces of or the country generally ; Captains Biaine and Cowley of the E. T. S, N. Company's Service, whose familiarity with the topography and navigation of the Tigris were of great service ; and Messrs. Hamilton and Millen at Basrah, who were able respectively to elucidate questions of trade at Basrah and the working of the Hamidiyah or navigation branch of the Dairat-as-Saniyah. The collection of information was carried on during 1905 by Colonel {then Major) L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident at Baghdad ; and on him and on his subordinates, especially Mr* Muhammad Hasan Muhsin, Vice-Consul at iCarbala, most of the labour at this time devolved. In particular, a quantity of authentic information in regard to routes was furnished by Major Newmaich from personal knowledge ; and by his efforts, assisted by those of Mr. Yacoub ThaddeuSj an ex-dragoman of the Residency, and of Mr. Thomas Khalil, a broker well acquainted with the country) by whom a useful sketch map explanatory of tribal distribution was prepared, as well as of Mr. Muhammad Hasan, much new light was cast upon the difficult subject of Arab tribes. Some of the inquiries relating to the 'Wilayat of Basrah were made at the beginning of 1905 by Mr. J. H. Monahan, then Acting British Consul at Basrah. Preliminary drafts of the topographical articles relating to 'Iraq, founded on the investigation just desoribed, were ready in print in August 1905 and were immedi i ' ately sent to the local officers for revision; this process, attended by extraordinary difficulties arising from the nature of the country, occupied many months and entailed very heavy work on Colonel Newmarch and on Mr. P. E. Crow, who had now resumed his duties as British Consul at Basrah and gave close attention to the matter. Colonel Newmarch's principal assistant was as before Mr. Vice-Consnl Muhammad Hasan, but questions of trade were referred to Mr. Parry of the E. T. S. N. Company. At Basrah the investigations were largely entiusted to Naoum Abho Effendi, the dragoman of the Consulate, and some help was rendered by Dr. Bennett of the American Presbyterian Mission. The draft articles Were also revised by the staff of the British Embassy at Constantinople, especially by Colonel P. R Maunsell who dealt with the military paragiaph. In 1906 minute and valuable reports on the Shatt-al -'Arab and on Tao were received from Lieutenant Commander Bowden of the R.l.M.S. 'Lawrence ' and Mr. W. D. Cumming of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, respectively. The revision of 1905-06 was so thorough, and the fresh inquiries produced so much additional information, that it became necessary to redraft nearly all the articles ; and when they were reprinted in April 1907, it was found that they had increased in bulk fjom less than 150 to over 300 octavo pages. A large number of doubtful or obscure points discovered in the new drafts were referred to the local officers, among wboni Major J. Eamsay had now taken the place of Colonel Newmarch and carried on the work with energy. The articles, as they now stand, include the results of this fina examination. It has also been possible to incorporate some of the data obtained by Lieutenants A.

XVIII, 1857 ; Ghesney's of the Euphrates Expedition, 1868 ; and Layard's Early Adventures, 1887. Recent authorities on the topography, population, agriculture, etc., of the country are not numerous : the best are the Gazetteer of Baghdad, 1889 ; Cuinet's I.a Turquie d'Jsie (Vol. Ill), 1894; and the Turkish5 or official almanacs, published periodically, of which that of 1903 for the Baghdad Wilayat and that of 1898 for the Basrah Wilayat—-the latest available^—have been utilised in the compilation of the present Gazetteer. A Reconnaissance Report, 1904, by Captain H. Smyth, contains much general information and deals particularly with communications, transport and the probable line of the projected Baghdad Railway : it will be found in the Political Proceedings of the Government of India for February 1905. In all matters of Turkish administration the highest authority is Mr. G. Young's Corps de Droit Ottoman, 1905 : this invaluable work was unfortunately brought too late to the knowledge of the writer to be consulted in writing the Gazetteer. The best source of information in regard to military organisation is Colonel F. R. Maunsell's Handbook of the Turkish Army, 1904 J and the annual Consular Reports for Baghdad and Basrah deal fully with the subject of trade. Mr. G. Le Strange's books Baghdad during the Ahhasid Caliphate, 1900, and Lands of the Eastern Caliphate, 1905, have superseded all other and less comprehensive works on the geography of 'Iraq in mediaeval times. Some information about the country in general and about particular places will be found in the Foreigii Proceedings of the Government of India for February 1905. See also the Report of the German Railway Commission in the Proceedings for May 1901.

The so-called Sanjaq of Najd that is to say, the Hasa Sanjaq described elsewhere under its own name, and the nominal Sanjaq of Qasim—which also forms the subject of a separate article—are not, of course, in any sense parts of'Iraq; but they are mentioned below incidentally on account of their administrative dependence on the Wilayat of Basrah. 'Iraq is a purely geographical expression, and, so far as possible, we shall use it as such only ; but occasionally, for political and administrative purposes, we shall be obliged to use the term as a synonym for the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats taken together without 'Najd' (i.e. Hasa) or Qasim. Boundaries.—'lva.q is bounded on the we&amp;t by the Shamiyah Desert, on the south by the frontier o£ the Kuwait Principality and by the waters of the Persian Gulf. On the east its limit is the Persian border ; and on the north our detailed inquiries will not extend beyond the town of Kadhimain on the Tigris.* The Porte pi-obably regard the Stamiyah Desert as embraced in the Wilayats of Baghdad and Basrah; but their authority over the nomad tribes inhabiting it is so slight that to treat any of the country to the west of the settled Euphrates valley as attached, even administratively, to ' Iraq would be a mistake : the most outlying Turkish stations, civil or military, upon this side are SMfathah, Najaf Town, Rahabah and Zubair Town, .... , • A, The exact position of the southern frontier is discussed m the a 1 , ic on the Kuwait Principality, and in this direction the most advanced Turkish outposts recognised by the British Government are those a Safwan and Umm Qasr; His Majesty's Government do not admi the title of the Porte to Bubiyan island, where a small detachment o Turkish troops is at present stationed. The eastern frontier, that with Persia, was fixed by the Erzeroum Treaty of 1847 in general terms; but, though the country throng »As will be seen from Mr. Le Strange's book, already quoted, the an ' ' ended northwards at Tfkrit on the Tigris, and on the Euphrates at a pom w may have been either due south or west by south of Takrlt.'IRAQ (TURKISH) 763 wliich it runs was surveyed for tlie purpose of delimitation by an Anglo- Russian Commission in 1849-1855, no actual line has as yet been laid down. From this remark, however, the portion of the frontier between the Persian Grulf and Karun river must be excepted, for here the Shatt- al -'Arab divides the possessions of the Sultan and the Shah ; this part alone of the Turco-Persian border is fixed with precision. North of this, the line of division observed in practice is understood to follow the Shatt- al -'Arab as far as the upper entrance of the Khaiyain creek, 6 miles by river above the mouth of the Karun^ leaving the islands of Umm-al- Khasasif and Shamshamiyall upon the Turkish side, and thence to run in a north-westerly direction to the foot hills of Western Luristan and Kurdistan which, from the point where it reaches them, it skirts as far as Mandali The line of contact between hill and plain is fairly well marked as it approaches Mandali; but in the neighbourhood of the Bani Lam country it is indefinite, and some of the pastures in the Dawairij neighbourhood are understood to be in dispute between the Turkish and Persian Governments. The districts of Jangulah or Jangulah dj&amp;f and Dih Bala A ^ or Taih Bala Db aju , though not exactly in the plains, should perhaps belong to Turkey.* Thysical geography and char act er. —''Iraq is a plain of alluvial clay, unrelieved by a single range, hill or natural eminence of the slightest importance. On the east, however, the plain is dominated by the hills bf the Persian district of Pusht-i-Kuh which, snow-clad in midwinter approach within about 30 miles of the Tigris at 'Ali-al-Gharbi and are in full view, running nearly parallel to the river, all the way betweeii the towns of 'Amarah and Kut-al-Amarah. The chief features of ''Iraq are, of course, the great rivers Euphrates and Tigris, upon which the prosperity and even the habitability of the entire country depend. Minor but still important features are the Diyalah.^ a left bank tributary of the Tigris a short way below Baghdad; the Shatt-al -Hindiyah, formerly a canal but now a substitute for the dried-up reach of the Euphrates between Musaiyib and Samawah; the channel, known as the Shatt-al -Gharaf, which connects the Tigris at Kut-al'Amarah with the Euphrates at Nasiriyah and Hammar; the enormous marshes upon the lower course of both Euphrates and Tigris from Qurnah up to the towns of 'Amarah and Easiriyah respectively ; the swamps in which the Dagharah canal has its ending, and those which * See a valuable Memorandum by Sir H. C. Rawlinson on the Turco-Persian frontier, printed as a Government of India Consultation in the Political Department, October 18&amp;i i zee also Lord Curzon's ' Persia,' pages 558 to 570^V64 'IRAQ (TURKISH) are said to have submerged a large part of the country between the Shatt-al -Gharaf, Tigris and Euphrates; the JaMlah which draws off a large proportion of the Tigris water at 'Amarah Town, restoring part of it to the Shatt-al -'Arab via the Suwaib, together with the swamps to which this canal gives rise: finally a long, but narrow, saline marsh reaching apparently most of the way from Mandali to Kut-al- Amarah. upon the Tigris, of which the large swamp near Jassan town, known as Hor Jassan, is perhaps a part. The soil of ^Iraq is in general a rich clay of fine quality, remarkably free, even in its natural state, from sterilising salts; this statement holds particularly of a large tract to the east of Baghdad City and of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates in the same latitude. Near the Euphrates, however, a saline efflorescence is in places observable; and below Kut-al-Amarah Town,, on the Tigris, and Diwaniyah Town, on the Euphrates, the proportion of sand in the soil to clay and humus is said to be excessive, except in the marshes. The valley of the Euphrates is much more extensively cultivated than that of the Tigris; but a little to the west of the former river, or rather of its Hindiyah branch, begins the irreclaimable SMmiyah Desert. W herever in 'Iraq the soil is irrigated there is rich cultivation and the date and other trees flourish ; but the productive area is confined, in existing circumstances, to narrow belts which adjoin rivers, canals or marshes. In a few loca lities also, especially in depressions, occasional crops are grown by rainfall; but the aspect of 'Iraq remains, on the whole, that of a barren wilderness or Choi Jj-^ of sun-baked clay, sprinkled with camel-thorn and wild caper and carpeted—but only after rain and chiefly on the side towards the Persian frontier—with a little thin herbage. Flora. — Natural wooding hardly exists except upon the banks of rivers and canals, where the Gharab or Euphrates poplar, a tree that does not attain any great size, grows interspersed with low tamarisk or Tarfah jungle: the Gharab is perhaps the Babylonian willow of Scripture. There is also a kind of osier or willow, known as Safsaf which gives a good shade. Some of the more important groves upon the Euphrates and Tigris are officially protected and are mentioned further on in this article in connection with the work of the Forest Department j they are sometimes very dense, but they are never extensive. The white and black mulberry, the ber, and various kinds of acacia (Barham ) are among the self-propagating trees of the country, and there is also a mimosa which goes by the name of Shok-ash-Shami'IRAQ (TURKISH) 765 A small thorny plant, called simply Shok is common everywhere and affords fuel and camel grazing. In the desert between Basrah, and Kuwait are found, in addition to other common forage plants, a shrub called Haram ^ and a grass called Sahbah 5 both of which are eaten by camels: the leaves of the Haram are small and globular and contain fluid. Two vegetable products, natural but possessing a commercial value, are colocynth or Handhal and Sus or liquorice. The colocynth occurs everywhere and is obtained in large quantities from the waste country between Baghdad and Hillah ; but it is inferior to the Syrian colocynth, and the dried pulp only is exported instead of the whole fruit. The trade in liquorice is dealt with in one of the paragraphs on trade below. The liquorice plant grows chiefly in river bends, on the concave side of the curves, and is said never to be found at more than two miles distance from the waters edge ; it requires a good deal of moisture and benefits by occasional floods. Its maximum height is about 10 feet, but on the average it does not exceed 4 or 5. Liquorice wood is a staple article of fuel at Baghdad. Fauna. —Wild animals are rare in ' Iraq except gazelles, pigs (which abound in the marshes) and jackals ; hysenas, foxes and hares also are said to exist. Duck, black partridge and snipe are among the feathered game; and the bustard is found in the desert, while heron and other aquatic birds are numerous in the marshes. The rivers produce fish, but not many kinds that are good to eat. The best known are the Bizz y , which is often 6 to 7 feet long and over 100 lbs. in weight; the Shabut a fish weighing from 2 to 6 lbs.; cm the Bunni a smaller but better tasting fish than the Shabut; ou the Qattan , a long, round fish measuring about 4 feet; the Jurri , a kind of scaleless catfish about feet long, eaten by Sunni Muhammadans but rejected by Shi^ah Muhammadans and Christians: and the Abu Zumair a mustachioed fish which only the desert Arabs will eat. There are also a fish about 6 inches long, called Biyah and a kind of flat fish known as Mazlag cJJyo. Sharks over 6 feet in length visit Baghdad in the hot season and make bathing in the Tigris dangerous ; they have been found as far up stream as Samarrah. In the marshv districts mosquitoes abound and sometimes make Ijfe a burden.766 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Minerals.—^h.Q minerals of J Iraq are bitumen, mineral oil, and salt ; o£ these the first two occur outside the limits to which this article is confined, the bitumen at Hit and ''Anah ss* on the upper Euphrates, and the oil at Hit and in the neighbourhood of the Persian frontier at Mandali, etc. The principal salt fields are those described in the articles on the 'Aziziyah, Karbala, Najaf, Nasiriyah, Samawah Shatrat-al- Amarah Qadhas ; there is one also, but of less importance, on the outskirts of Baghdad City near the Bab-at-Tilism. It may be added that Juss or gypsum mortar is found in many parts of 'Iraq, especially at Mahmudiyah, Samarrah and Tikrit; that a whitish-yellow clay, suitable for pottery, is obtained from the banks of the Tigris ; and that the desert about Baghdad and Ba'qubah yields a clay good for making bricks. Climate and health. — The climate of 'Iraq is on the whole not unhealthy, but it may be described as extreme, for the temperature in the shade ranges at Baghdad City from a minimum of 18 , 6 0 F. in winter to a maximum of 123° in summer. December, January and February are cold, crisp, and even bracing months, during which some rain falls ; March and April are warm and unsettled, with occasional thunder and dust-storms ; May and June are hot but fine, often with a refreshing north-west wind or Shamal at night ; in July, August and September the heat is excessive and almost insupportable, driving the inhabitants of the towns to live in subterranean rooms or Sardabs by day and upon the roofs of their houses from sunset to sunrise ; during October the heat begins to abate, and in November the weather becomes cool again. More precise details of temperature and rainfall will be found in the article on Baghdad City, the only place in 'Iraq for which exact statistics exist. In ''Iraq the prevailing winds are those from the north-west and north; but calm weather is the • rule. High temperatures accompany the east wind or Sharqi when it blows in the months of June, July and August ; and the south wind is invariably oppressive and is generally accompanied by dust. The foregoing remarks relate primarily to Baghdad City and are not applicable without modification to the whole of the 'Iraq. In December 19Q5 the temperature in the Euphrates region between Musaiyib and Kiifah sometimes fell to 18 0 F. and biting winds blew from the north, but without injury to the health of caravans. The meteorological tables of the Government of India sho,w that th§IRAQ (TURKISH) 767 conditions of Baghdad as to temperature are very similar to those of Jacobabad in Sind, and that the hot weather is more prolonged and intense than that of the Indian Panjab. At Basrah Town and generally in the region of the Shatt-al -'Arab, the daily range of temperature is less, the summer nights are hotter, and the climate is more enervating than at Baghdad. Further meteorological details will be found in the articles on Basrah Town and Fao. Malarial fever in autumn is the principal disease of the country ; and epidemics of cholera, and formerly of plague, have been of not unfrequent occurrence. Other diseases are small-pox and diphtheria, with typhoid, tuberculosis and syphilis in the towns. The celebrated Baghdad boil described in the article on Baghdad, is hardly known in ^Iraq outside of that city, but a similar affection exists in Eastern Anatolia and at Aleppo, Diyarbakr and other places in Asiatic Turkey. Popdation. —It is difficult to form even an approximate estimate of the population of ^Iraq,—an intricate and extensive country, parts of which are hardly ever visited by civilised travellers. In attempting to give some idea of. the number o£ the inhabitants a distinction may first be drawn between what we may call the fixed and the nomadic ele ments ; and among the former of these will be included not only the residents of towns and large villages but also a very great number of tribesmen who dwell in huts or even tents, yet devote themselves to agricultare and stock-raising and are generally found in the same locali ties, though not exactly at the same places. The following are three separate estimates of the fixed population in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats ; — I. II. III. Baghdad Wilayat 267,000 1,365,000 890,000 Basrah Wilajat 4 'i « fc 935,000 1,500,000 590,000 Total souls 1,202,000 2,865,000 1,480,000 The first of these estimates (total 1,302,000) was deduced by the (German) Baghdad Railway Commission of 1900 from the Turkish official registers; the second (total 2,865,000) was specially supplied, it would appear, to jthe same body by the Walis of Baghdad and Basrah* ; the ^ See Proceedings of the Government of India in the Eoreign Department for May 1901,768 'IRAQ (TURKISH) third (total 1,480,000) has been compiled, district by district, from infor- mation collected for the present G-azetteer, and a tabular analysis showing how it was reached will be found in the paragraph on civil administration below. The first two of these estimates no doubt include the populations of the Hasa Sanjaq and the Kuwait Principality in the figures for the Basrah Wilayat, and to that extent they are excessive as estimates for ^Iraq proper, which indeed they are not meant to be ; but the first, on the other hand, is probably an underestimate for part of the country which it was intended to cover, for the Turkish official almanacs freely recognise the existence in some places of an ^ unregistered ^ population. Upon the whole the third estimate, referring- as it does to ^Iraq only and based on all the available information of every kind, is probably not very far from the truth. The exact number of Bedouins in ^Iraq is impossible to calculate^ and the great majority of those seen in the country belong in reality to Central or Eastern Arabia and have been included already in our estimates of the population of Jabal Shammar and Kuwait. The true nomads whose homes are in 'Iraq are far from numerous and they mostly belong to tribes of which the bulk is fixed or only semi-nomadic. On full consideration of all the facts the population of ' Iraq may be placed at 1,500,000 souls or slightly more, of whom only a very small proportion are wandering Bedouins. ' JJrhan'population and 'urban ' life. —In approaching the subject of races and tribes among the people of 'Iraq, we may discard the distinction adopted above for purposes of numerical calculation and adopt ani'ther more suitable to our new topic—one, namely, between urban' and a rural' population. By urban ' population are meant here not only the residents of towns, properly so called, but also those of permanent villages ; the a rural ^ population is taken to consist of the semi-nomads already mentioned, whose dwellings are huts or even tents, and of Bedouins pure and simple. The ' urban ' population, in what follows below, is thus very far from being identical with the u fixed' * The (German) Baghdad Railway Commission, already quoted, estimated the 'nomads and semi-nomads ' in the Baghdad Wilayat at 750,000 and those in the Wilayat of Basrah at over 1,000,000. In the case of Basrah these figures probably include many tribes outside of 'Iraq : and in both Wilayats the semi-nomads, it will be observed, have been bracketed (by the Commission) with the nomads and not (as in our estimate) with the fixed population. In any case the estimates of the Commission for fixed and nomadic population together are much in excess of the probable numbers. It is a well-known fact that the strengths of Bedouin tribes are as a rule grisly exaggerated except by the most cautious observers.'IRAQ (TURKISH) 769 population above; and similarly there is no correspondence between the ^nomadic ' and 'rural ' populations. The inhabitants of the towns and permanent villages, who thus form by themselves a natural division of the people, may be subdivided accord' ing to race into Arabs, Persians, Jews, Turks, Kurds, Chaldseans, Armenians and Sabians, besides Asiatic aud European foreigners. Arabs form the bulk of all the urban communities in ''Iraq with the two important exceptions of Baghdad City and the towns of Karbala and Kadhimain ; in the first of these they are outnumbered by Jews, and in the other two by Persians. The distinctions of the urban Arabs among themselves are mainly religious and will be noticed further on ; but a large proportion of them are descended from the rural tribes, dealt with in a later paragraph, and to some extent preserve their characteristics. The Arab of ''Iraq is not fanatical, but he is grasping in money matters and frequently overreaches himself by the extravagance of his own demands; he labours also under a rooted disinclination for hard work. At Karbala Town, and at Kadhimain Town as well, Persians predo minate in numbers over all other races. There is a considerable Persian colony in Baghdad City and one-eighth of the population of Basrah. Town and a considerable proportion of that of Tawairij are believed to be Persian; Persians engaged in retail trade are found even in such minor places as Rum ait hah, 'Ali-al-Gharbi and Qal'at Salih. Many of the Persians are Turkish subjects; but they are generally unpopular with the Turks, and some o£ them maintain on their part a covert religious and political opposition to the Ottoman Grovernment, especially at Karbala and Najaf. The Jews are from every point of view an extremely important element in the population, and in the city of Baghdad they are believed to outnumber the Turks and even the Arabs. In ''Iraq, which contains the tombs of Ezra and Ezekiel and reaches to within a short distance of the tomb of Daniel, the Jews are surrounded by monuments of the Captivity, and this may account for the exceptional bigotry and devotion to the minutiss of their law which they here display. They are almost entirely engaged in trade and money-lending, and many of them are altogether absorbed in these pursuits; but some of them are men of high and honourable character, in every way worthy of the distinguished and responsible positions to which they not infrequently attain. Many of them begin life as hawkers of stockings and such wares; all marry young and receive some capital at marriage from their fathers-in-law; when 3D770 'IRAQ (TURKISH) the latter are too poor to pay, the dowry or Muhr is subscribed by their neighbours. The trade of Baghdad is passing every year more under Jewish control; and many Jews now visit England, and some of them even reside there as business agents for partners or relations. The native Christian merchants of Baghdad have mostly disappeared during the last 15 years in consequence ot Jewish competition, and already Muhammadan merchants are taking Jews into partnership as a measure of self-defence ; the Muhammadans, however, are still able to hold their own to some extent in the up-country trade carried on from Baghdad. The leading native firms at Basrah are Jewish also. Jews are found at various other places throughout the country such as 'Amarah Town, where they have a synagogue and two rabbis j Kut-al-Amarah, where they have a synagogue; Nasiriyah, Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Hai, 'Ali-al- Gharbi and Qal'at Salih. They venerate the tomb of Ezekiel at Kifl and many of them are buried there. The Turks are not found in any numbers outside Baghdad City, where they compose about one-fifth of the population, and many of these are Turks only in name. The modern Turk is generally a hybrid and must often have in his veins much Christian blood, derived from the conquered and converted subjects of the old Byzantine Empire; and in ■'Iraq his lineage is probably less pure than in some other Ottoman prov inces. Turks in ^Iraq are mostly found in the government services and in official positions ; those in the higher grades are often from Europe, and many of these know little or no Arabic. In 'Iraq the Turk does not figure as an agriculturist or trader as he does in Anatolia and other parts of the Empire. From excess of caution the Turk often appears reserved and even sullen, and he does not shine as a civil administrator; but he is believed to be still a brave and energetic soldier. Among the finest classes of men in the towns and villages are the Kurds, most of whom seem to belong to the Failiyah 4^ branch of the tribe. The distribution and character of the Kurds is described in a separate article. As an agriculturist in 'Iraq the Kurd is said to be inferior to the Arab. The Armenians, of whom there are some at Baghdad, have lost much of their importance in trade in consequence of Jewish competition, and with it, to some extent, their position as a community, but some of them are still well-to-do merchants or clerks. Cbaldsean Christians are not very much in evidence except as domestic servants and upon the river steamers, where they enjoy a complete monopoly as deck-hands and firemen ; those who serve on the steamers are all Talkaifis, or natives or'IEAQ (TURKISH) 771 Talkaif , a village near Musal, and strongly resemble one another in their features, which are of an unmistakeable cast. These Chaldseans are now improving their position by means of education, and some of the younger generation are clerks in banks, etc. The profession of the law is almost monopolised at Baghdad by the Christian races^ It remains to mention the curious sect or community of the Sabians, to or Subba regarding whose religion much controversy has taken place and who are more fully described in a separate article : they are found also in the Persian province of ''Arabistan, The Sabians are an artistic and mechanical people, hardly distinguishable in appearance from their i^rab neighbours. The commonest profession among them is that of gold and silversmith, and the silver and antimony ware of he Sabians of ^Amarah. Town is celebrated ; but others are employed as gunsmiths, carpenters and boat-builders ; a few are bakers. Their chief settlements in ^Iraq are at Nasiriyah., at 'Amarah. Town and at Suq- ash-Shuyukh where their Qari or religious head has his abode; but they are also found at QaPat Salih, 'All-al-Gharbi and Shaikh Sa'ad. Asiatic foreigners, exclusive of Persians, are generally natives of India, Afghanistan, or the Indo-Afghan frontier who have been attracted to the country by the sacred places of Shi'ism or by the Sunni shrine of 'Abdul Qadir Gilam at Baghdad, and the descendants of such. The Indians are not generally held in much esteem, but the Afghans and Pathans, by their superior physique and force of character, command some respect. In Baghdad there is a considerable body of Afghans and Pathans, mostly employed as watchmen and door-keepers, who have been known, on such an occasion as the murder of one of their number, to occasion anxiety to the authorities by a disposition to make common cause. Europeans in ; Iraq are almost confined to the towns of Baghdad and Basrah and are chiefly English. In the towns and villages of ^Iraq the houses are nearly always built on the same plan and consist of a square or oblong courtyard stirrounded by rooms ; in the larger towns the houses are often two-storeyed, and in that case the upper flat has generally a verandah which looks into the central yard. Handsome projecting windows called Shanashil an Arabic corruption of the Persian Shahnishin and sitting-rooms built across the street at a considerable height above the ground so as to form a bridge between apart ments on the opposite sides are features of the domestic architecture of Ba ghdad City and are reproduced in some of the other towns. Houses are generally built by the owners who buy 3 d 2772 'IRAQ (TURKISH) the materials and pay daily wages to the workmen; the architect who directs operations is frequently illiterate and works by rule of thumb without the aid of plans. The members of each of the different races and religions which inhabit the towns generally congregate together in a particular quarter, and as a rule they are recognisable at sight by their dress and general appearance. In Baghdad the 'Aba ^ and Zabun , the outer and inner garment of the ordinary Muhammadan nativCj have begun to give way, partly perhaps in consequence of the wearing of European uniform by the troops, to European dress ; the case of foot-gear is similar. Work ceases at sunset throughout the year and few persons leave their houses after dark. Men are never seen abroad in the company of women, not even of their wives or nearest relations. Rice enters largely into the diet of the town classes, among whom the well-to-do mostly have a Pilao or Shorbah at least once a day. Coffee is the universal beverage. 'Rural'population and 'rural' life. —The people, outside the towns and permanent villages, are all Arabs, except in some of the eastern districts where there are Kurds ; and the great bulk of them— as already explained—are at least semi-settled, and a few only, temporary visitors being excepted, are entirely nomadic. The tribal system of 'Iraq, as we must at once warn the reader, is not so exact, so rigid, or so well ascertained as that, for example, of the Pathan tribes on the North-Western Frontier of India, or that even of the Bedouins of Central Arabia. Thus it happens that enumerations of tribal subdivisions received at different times or from different sources seldom tally, and that the Turkish Government do not understand, and that the tribesmen themselves are often unable to explain, the relationship subsisting between different sections. As concrete examples of the uncertainties encountered we may mention that diverse accounts represent the DafafTah and the A1 Bu Darraj as wholly independent tribes and as sections of the Shammar T5qall and Bani Lam respectively; that the Sarai Arabs figure in some statements as a subdivision of the Bani Lam and in others as a section of the Ban! Eabfah ; and that the Khasraj are sometimes named in connection either with the Bani Lam or with the Zubaid, and at other times are spoken of as a tribe by themselves. The fluidity of tribal conditions is illustrated by the fact that the Bani Mallk^ Ahl-al-Jazair and Bani Mansur, who a few years back were apparently considered to be sections of the Muntafik, are now generally regarded as possessing each a separate existence. Part of the/(^s (At? : itriticl 'IRAQ (TURKISH) m confusion arises from a tendency to class a small tribe which depends upon the assistance of a larger tribe in war as a section of the larger ; and the political alliances wMch tlms partly determine classification are unstable and fluctuating. Doubts of the kind we have indicated could be finally settled only by elaborate local enquiries among the tribes. In the present Gazetteer we have been guided by the best opinions available; but accuracy, in the circumstances^ cannot be guaranteed.* The following is a table of the principal u rural' tribes of ; Iraq :— Tribe. Location, T emaeks. 'Abdallah (Al) A UI jf In the Najaf Qadha, A settled tribe of Shi'ala agricul- lurists, by some regarded as a section of the Jalihah below. 'Afaj In the 'Afaj collectioa of villages on the Dagha- rah canal, and in that neighbourhood. The country inhabited by this tribal group is marshy. There are no horses and Mashhuf canoes are the chief means of loco motion. ' Afaj is not really the name of a tribe, but it is used loosely to desig nate the whole body of tribes who Inhabit 'Afaj. The principal among them are the 'Ajarij &gt;1^ Bahahithah Hanizah Makhadihah Al Bu Nasbi Jl , Al Fu Eashid and Shaibah These people are described as courageous, independent and trustworthy, but always engaged in feuds. 'Ajib or 'Ajaib In the Qadhas of Najaf and Samawah. The 'Ajib are generally stated to be a subsection of the Jabur-al-Wawi section of the Zubaid : in religion they are Shi'ahs. In the Najaf Qadha they figure as nomads : ia Samawali they are settled. 'Akaidat In the Qadha of Kadhi- main. A settled tribe, Surmi by religion. 'Akarat In the Qadba of Najaf. The 'Akarat number about 200 men ; they ate Shi'ahs and agri- cnltarists, They are said to be a subsection of the Jahur-al-Wawi section of the Zubaid and to be included in a subdivision of the tribe called the Al 'Isa Jf. axuxujcis uu uuc niuco ux vi*j f iiiO 'loan, ILIlSiZSi'Jl, Bani Lam, Bani Malik, Mas'ud, Muhaisin, A1 Pa Muhammad, Muntafik, Bani Rabi'ah, Shammar T5qah, A1 Bti SultaJl and Zubaid must be read subject to these remarks. ! i i im 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Tribe. AlaJwi' Abu) Lfyh' xe _yV 'Amiriyali UJ 'Aozah Aqra' £/' Asad (Bani) •Atli &amp; 1 Location, Eemaeks. In the Qadha of Diwa- niyah. In the Qadha of Hindi- yah, partly in Mshovab- ash-Sharqi on the left bank of the Shatt-al- Hindiyah between Musaiyib and Tawai- rij. Some of the Bedouins of this tribe visit the parts of the Karbala and Najaf Qadhas which are nearest to the Sha- miyah desert. The Dagharah group of villages on the Daglia- rah canal. The 'Amiriyah are Shi'ahs, live in reed huts, cultivate, and keep cattle. They were originally connected with the Zubaid, but are now an independent tribe and are at present in alliance with the Bani Hasan below. See article 'Anizah. Apparently in the Hindi- yah Qadha between the Mshorab canal from the Shatt-al-Hindiyati and the Abu Khasawi branch of the Dawaihlyah canal. Ta the Qadha of Najaf. A general term covering a number of tribes of which the principal are these :—Hamad Hilalat Mujawir Nail (AlBti) JjujjJI , Sa'id (Al) Sxxsm jT , Shibanah (Al) jf, 'tJmr (Al) jf ; and Zaiyad To these should perhaps be added the I^arahinah, Al Bii Husain, Al BuRishah and Sindan below. In their general cha racteristics the Aqra* resemble the tribes of the 'Afaj group above, whose neighbours they are. They are all Shi'ahs and have an evil reputation as robbers. These Bani Asad are only about 300 souls and have no horses; they are Shi'ahs and allied with the Bani Taraf. They are apparently identical with the Bani Sadd (see below). There is another tribe of the same name in the Qadha of Suq-ash -Shuyukh, especial- ly in the neighbourhood or Hammar and Jazair upon the Euphrates. The 'Atij number about 70 persons and are Shi'ahs by religion and engaged in agriculture. They aie probably a subsection of the Ja iir- al-Wawi section of the Zubaia and not an independent tribe.'IRAQ (TURKISH) 775 Tribe. Location. remakks.- 'A tub On the Shatt-al -'Arab, chiefly between Basrah and Muhammareli. See article 'Atub. 'Awabid In and about the Muqata'ah of Rghailah in the Qadha of Shamiyah. The 'Awabid, who are Shi'ahs in» habiting tents and huts and en gaged in agriculture and stock breeding, are estimated at 6,000 souls. They possess about 600 horses. The 'Awabid are probably not &amp;i independent tribe but a section of the Bani Hasan below. 'Ayash Jn the Qadhas of Najaf and Shamiyah. In the Najaf Qadha the members of this tribe are nomadic, visiting the district with their cattle in the winter only ; in the Shamiyah Qadha, where their fixed settlements are, they are said to number 9,000 souls. All the 'Ayash are Shi'ahs and the major ity are engaged in cattle breeding, but the poorer among them cultivate. The tribe is indepen dent but closely connected with the Bani Hasan below. Baltichis Chiefly in the towns of Karbala, Hillah and Kufah and at Shifathah and Ja'arah. The ancestors of these Baltish or Baluchis, who are Persian subjects and now number about 3,000 souls in 'Iraq, are said to have come from Baluchistan about 100 years ago at the invitation of Sahib-ar-Eiyadh, a celebrated scholar of Karbala, to assist in defending that town against the Wahhabis. Baraji' In the Qadha of Hindi- yah. The Baraji' are Shi'ahs and can muster 400 men ; they are friendly with the A1 Bu Fatlah and at feud with the Bani Hasan. All are agriculturists. They are probably a section of the Jalihah below. Barbari At Najaf Town. The Barbaris are not numerous in 'Iraq ; they are believed to have entered the country as political refugees from Afghanistan. Barbaris are not now, perhaps, found in Afghanistan; but they were the original inhabitants of the Hazarajat and were practically annihilated by Jangiz Khan (or one of his successors) who swamped them with military colonists (Hazaras). The Band-i-Amir Lakes in Afghanistan are still some times called the Band-i- Barbar.776 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Tribe.

In the Eghailah Muqafca'Ii of theShamiyahQadba and in the Qadha of Drwaniyah upon the Dagharah canal. The Dagharah villages on the Dagharah canal. The right bank of the Tigris from Kumait down to a point opposite 'Amarah Town. On the Mshorab canal from the Shatt-al- Hindiyah in the Qadha of that name. Some of the Bedouins of this tribe visit the right bank of the Euphrates injilie neighbourhood of Nasiriyah. In the Qadha of Sama- wah. E emaekS. In the Qadha of Najaf. In the Qadha of Kadhi- main. The Al Budair are Shi'ahs, inhabit ing tents and huts, and engaged in agriculture and stock raising. They are said to number about 3,000 souls and to have 300 horses. Those in Shamiyah, number about 300 men and are only cultivators : they are more over so closely connected with the Bani Hasan as to be almost indis tinguishable from them. This, Jike 'Afaj above, is not a genuine tribal name ; but it is used as a synonym for the Aqra' mentioned above because they inhabit the Dagharah villages. By some authorities these Al Bu Darraj are treated not as an inde pendent tribe but as belonging to the Khasraj division of the Bani Lam. In general characteristics this tribe resembles the Jalihah. Politi cally thejr are dependent on the Al Kinamih, but they are some times said to be a subsection of the Jabur-al-Wawi section of the Zubaid. They are Shi'ahs by religion iand agriculturists and cattle breeders by occupation. Their fighting men are said to number 4()0. See article Dhafir. A settled SM'ah tribe, engaged in agriculture and cattle breeding *. said to muster 2,200 men. They consist of several _sections among whom are ^ the Al Bu Husain Jf and the Al Juma'ah &lt;J}.

A settled Shi'ah tribe on the Dagharah canal, engaged in cattle breeding and agriculture. They are perhaps one of the Aqra' tribes mentioned above. Fatlah (Al Bti) dJUG Jl In the Hindiyah Qadha, especially between Tawai- rij and Hillah and near Tall Nimrud, and in the Shamiyah Qadha about Ja'arah. This tribe is generally at feud with the Bani Hasan and on good terms with the Jalihah, Qarait and Tnfail below. They are supposed to i number some 10,000 souls; but their fiorses are only about 200. Thej are divided into about 25 sections, all agricultural and in habiting either reed huts or mud houses. Ghazalat In the Najaf Qadha and about Ja'arah in the Shamiyah Qadha. The Ghazalat are a Shi'ah tribe at enmity with the Dilaim and closely associated with the Khaza'il. In all they are said to muster about 2,000 men. The majority are Bedouins and the rest agriculturists and cattle-breeders. Hakim (Bani) In the Qadha of Sama- wah. Vulgarly known as the Bani Hachaim a large settled Shi'ah tribe engaged in stock raising and agriculture. They comprise many sections of which the following are the chief:—'Abas 'Ata Ullah dJJ| (Jar ^ 'Atawah , Burkat ofcy y Falahat oU.

The Hamaidat are about 5,000 in number. They cultivate rice and other cereals, own 500 horses and breed cattle and sheep. They live in tents and huts and are Shi'ahs. According to some the Hamaidat are a section of the Bani Hasan below.778 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Tribe. Hasan (Bani) Location.

Hasan (Shaikh) Ihe Maulah, Mawash, Qaraishafc and Bani Taraf tribes below and the Hamaidafc above are closely asso ciated with the Bani Hasan and by some are even reckoned sections. Divisions of the Bani Hasan in Hor-ad-Dukhn are:— 'Abbas , A1 Bu 'Adliaib •w-Oikc ^ 'Aridhi jJ jl , A1 Bu Hadari jj JI, Hawatim and Majatim .

J}. Bani Sarawan of whom tbe Bani Salamah at least are Bedouins. The 'Awabid. already described above are probably a section of the Bani Hasan_; and similarly the 'Ayash and A1 Budair, though in dependent tribes, are very closely connected with the Bani Hasan. The Bani Hasan are usually on bad terms with their neijafhbonrs the Baraji'; and the Al Bti Fatlah above and the Karakishah below are their friends. The Bani Hasan are roughly estimated at 10,000 souls, but they have only about 200 horses. About A of the tribe sowe. times move with their cattle w search of pasture. The Shaikh Hasan are probably not a separate tribe. Some d® sc }V them as a section of the Ka and others would merge them in Muhaisin. They are Shi ahs.'IRAQ (TURKISH) 779 Tribe.

Remabzs. In the Nasriyah tract in the Qadha of Kar- baia. A small tribe allied to the Muntafik. One account, which is not confirmed, says that they are identified with the section of the Quraish of which the prophet Muhammad came and are honoured as Saiyids. It has also been stated that they are found in many places throughout Turkish 'Iraq, but in this perhaps there is some confusion with the Bani Hakim or Hachaim above. The Al Bfi Hassan are a large settled Shi'ah tribe comprising, among others, these sections 'Abas ^xc , Al Bu 'Ainain &gt; Jalabitah kj Khamis and Suhur These may perhaps be regarded as belonging to the Aqra' group above. They live in tents and keep sheep. They have no horses, but they have many canoes and are fairly well armed. They are a settled tribe. Some say that the Fani Sadd on the Shatt-al- Hindiyah are Bani Husain. The Al Ibrahim are Shi'ahs and are supposed to number about 4,000 souls. They live in tents and huts and cultivate rice and pulse and breed cattle. They have about 300 horses. They may be a section of the Al Shibil below. See article 'Idan. It seems preferable to class the Jabur as a double section of the Zubaid, the article on which tribe may be consulted. But some authorities regard them as a dis tinct tribe, divided into two sections which are now uncon nected with one another: viz,, the Jabur-al-Wawi of the Eu phrates valley, who are all Shi'ahs, aiid the Jabur of the Tigris side, who are Sunnis. A tribe of about 200 fighting men, Shi'ahs. They cultivate and breed cattle and have about 100 horses.i ililil'li i i m 'IRAQ (TURKISH) ilH ill! Tribe. Location, R emaeks.

A small tribe dependent on the Mas'ud, of whom some would classify them as a section. Th^y are Shi'ah^, and though settled are much addicted to robbery. Their men are only about 50 in number. The following general remarks upon tlie customs of the rural Arab population relate in the first instance to the tribes of the Euphrates and Shatt-al-Hindiyah country in the neighbourhood of Karbala Town^ but in some degree they are true of all. Two stringent articles of the tribal code are those relating to pro tection and assistance: under the first a person on whose protection another expressly throws himself must receive him into his house and refuse to surrender him even at the cost of his own life ; under the second a guest who ; after declining proffered food and coffee, is addressed with the phrase ' Eat, thy demand shall be satisfied ' is entitled to the utmost assistance of his entertainer in the design which he may thereupon unfold. An important feature of the tribal system is the payment of Diyah or blood-money for murders, a matter which the Turkish Government has so far been content to leave in the hands of the Shaikhs. The ordinary price of a man^s life ranges from 100 to 1,000 Bashliks, say £4 to £40 (English) ; but among the Muntafik it is £87, among the Bani Malik £60, and among the Kliaza/il is said to rise to as much as 1,000 Majidis or about £170. The value of a woman is generally the same as that of a man, but sometimes it is790 'IRAQ (TURKISH) half; the Diyah of a Saiyid is double that of an ordinary person. If the victim and the murderer belong to different tribes the relations of the victim receive % the blood-money, the Shaikhs of his tribe take ^ and the remaining 4 is divided among his fellow tribesmen at large. Money compensation may be declined, and the heir of a murdered man may demand instead two unmarried girls of his own selection from the murderer's tribe ; on their being made Over to him the claim to pecuniary compensation is transferred from him to the girls' next-of-kin. Por a woman received in marriage a sum of 100 to 1,000 Bashliks, called Mihr j** , is paid to her father or next-of-kin; the bride is carried in procession to the house of the bridegroom with jumping, singing, dancing and firing of guns,—a display known as Hosah ; on the next day one of the relatives of the bridegroom spreads a cloth on the ground and exclaims u Shobashwhereupon the guests come forward with their wedding presents. Strange to say the same performance of Hosah attends the conveyance of a corpse to burial ; the Fatihah is then read and mourning continues for from three to five days : the mourners are treated as guests, but they bring with them money or other presents. A pilgrim returned from Makkah holds a reception for three days; his visitors also are his guests, and they too offer gifts. The clothing of the ordinary countryman consists of a cotton shirt or tunic known as Thob vrS a woollen cloak called 'Aba ^ or Bishit U) a Kafiyah ^ or kerchief, and an 'Aqal or headband. Milk (Halib )&gt; curds (Libn ^ ), bread ('Aish and dates are the chief articles of diet; the bread is generally of barley kneaded with milk, wheat bread being reserved for exceptional occasions and given to guests. The people inhabit for the most part black tents of haircloth, styled Buyut-ash-Sha'ar (houses of hair), or huts of grass, thorns, reeds or date-matting, called Kukh The agriculture of most tribes is shifting and desultory; their cultivation includes wheat, barley, maize, sesame, Mash, pulse, linseed, vegetables, rice and dates, varying accord ing to the character of the soil and the means of irrigation. Their domestic animals are the camel, buffalo, horse, cow, sheep and goat, the kind of live-stock kept by a particular tribe depending on the nature of its lands; the pastoral portions of most tribes generally wander in the desert in spring, accompanied by their flocks and herds. At times, m certain localities, a considerable number of Arabs earn a livelihood by digging liquorice root for exportation to America : some of these belong to the Fallahin or cultivating tribes, and certain of the semi-settled and JBedouin tribes also allow their women to earn money by this'IRAQ (TURKISH) 791 occupatioil. The more nomadic tribes are incorrigibly lazy and averse to every sort of manual labour. Most of the tribes ; except perhaps on the lower Euplirates and along the margin of the Shamiyall Desert are now under the effective control of the Turkish Government; but they are managed chiefly through their Shaikhs who stilly with the countenance and support of the Ottoman officials, exercise considerable executive authoritv. «/ A number of the semi-nomadic cultivating tribes now abstain from set tling down only in order to escape liability to conscription for military service and administrative interference with their life. On the side towards the Shamiyah Desert the fear of Bedouin raids has an appreciable effect in preventing the extension of agriculture. Jrms.—The armament of several of the tribes to which special articles have been devoted is noticed in those articles. To speak generally; the tribes nearest to the Persian Gulf are the most heavily armed with modern rifles; this is probably due to the facilities which at present exist for secret importation into lower ; Iraq ; either from Kuwait by way of the desert or from Masqat and Muhammareh. by sea and river. A possible new source of supply has lately come into existence in the shape of rifle-factories worked by Kurds at Kirind in Persian Kurdistan: the parallel with the lr.do-Afghan frontier which this suggests is completed by the occasional loss by Turkish troops of rifles which pass into the hands of the tribesmen, especially of the Bani Lam. The tribes in the Basrah Wilayat have probably as many rifles as they can afford to purchase ; but the Bani Rabl^ah. about Kut-al-Amarah have fewer, and the Zubaid and Shammar Toqah, who lie above them, are still comparatively unprovided with arms of precision. The favourite pattern of breech-loader in 'Iraq is the Martini, but there is also a sprinkling of Mausers. Where breech-loaders are deficient, the favourite substitute is a double-barrelled muzzle-loading gun, and this is the weapon most in evidence at the present day between Baghdad and Karbala and in the neighbourhood of Karbala and Hillah. A Turkish law strictly regulates the carrying of firearms in Iraq, but it is not properly enforced; it is, in fact, little more at present than an engine of official extortion. Swords are still worn by some tribes; and the Bedouin lance, 12 feet in length with a broad and formidable blade, is still common in the desert and may be seen even upon the banks of the rivers. Curved daggers about a foot in length, double-edged and very sharp at the point, are•792 'IRAQ (TURKISH) frequently carried, particularly by Persians. The weapon of the herd- boy and of the very poor is a kind of knobkerry, consisting of a stick about 2 feet long on one end of which is fixed a hard and heavy lump of bitumen. The ordinary tribes measure their strength in rifles and men, distin- guishingr the latter as mounted or unmounted; their more aquatic brethren keep account chiefly of rifles and of boats or canoes. HeUgion. —The country population is almost universally Shfah except in the outlying north-western districts of the Sanjaq of Baghdad, and Shi^ism may accordingly be styled the religion of ^Iraq. The principal exceptions to the rule in our list of tribes are the ^Anizall, Dhafir and Shammar who can hardly be said to belong to the tract; the Sa'ulun or ruling section of the Muntafik; two sections (in part only) of the Zubaid, and a majority of the Janabiyin ; these and a few other petty clans are Sunnis. The case of town populations is somewhat different, but not suffi ciently so to reverse the broad statement that ''Iraq is a Shi'ah country. In the Baghdad Wilayat only about -J- of the total population appears to be Sunni, and the Sunnis are confined almost entirely to the Sanjaq o£ Baghdad, a large number of them belonging 1 to Baghdad City itself. In the Basrah Wilayat the proportion of Sunnis is only about and Only a very few are found outside the towns of Basrah and Zubair. The chief features and institutions of Islam in 'Iraq are described in the special Appendix of this Gazetteer which deals wich religions. The Muhammadans of 'Iraq generally are ignorant and uninformed in their own religion, but not fanatical : neither statement however applies to the inhabitants of the religious centres of Karbala, Najaf, and Kadhimain. Superstitions are universal, especially regarding the evil eye, charms against which are worn even by adults and are placed upon children and young or pet animals, besides being affixed to houses, sailing-boats and even Quffahs or coracles. The principal religions of 'Iraq, other than the Muhammadan, are the Jewish and the Christian. Jews are numerous, but Christianity numbers only a few thousand adherents distributed among the following sects^ whom we mention in their probable order of numerical importance, Gregorian Armenian Church, Chaldsean Catholic Church, Syrian Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church, Catholic Armenian Church, various Protestant Churches, Greek Church*'IRAQ (TURKISH) 793 Language. —The prevailing language of ^Iraq is Arabic of a not very pure type. The official classes however speak and write Turkish^ and the superior officers sent from European Turkey often do not understand Arabic. Persian is largely spokeu in the towns, especially at Karbala, Najaf, and Kadhimain, where it is generally understood. Kurdish is spoken by the Kurds, Hebrew by the Jews^, and a language of their own—perhaps Syriac—by the Sabians. The most diffused European language at Baghdad is French, and after it English; the use of English/ however, is, on the increase at Baghdad, and at Basrah English has already distanced all European competifcors. Agriculture.—Cultivsitiouj as already remarked, is restricted to a comparatively small fraction of the total area of ^Iraq : with a proper system of canal irrigation it might be immensely extended. The back ward condition of agriculture is attributable chiefly to want of irrigation in some parts and to want of drainage m others, but also in a certain degree to scarcity of labour, and on the verge of the desert to the insecurity produced by Bedouin raids. It has been estimated that at present not more than one-tenth of the Baghdad Wilayat is cultivated^ and even that not continuously nor the whole of it in the same year; and some authorities would even place the proportion of productive lands throughout 'Iraq as low as 3 per cent, of the whole. There are two harvests in 'Iraq, the spring or Shitwi and the autumn or Saifi The principal spring crops are wheat, barley, beans, and Hurtuman Wheat and barley are sown on plains that have a moderate supply of water, either before or after Jawairid the name given by the Arab cultivator to ' the first cold days of winter, when the trees lose their last leaves the earlier sowings, called Hirfi are made in September and October, the later, called Athli ^ JjI , between Novembel 4 and the end of January. The wheat and barley harvest begins in April j the grain after being dried in stacks in the sun is threshed by being trodden with buffaloes or cows, except near the towns where a threshing- machine (Jarjar^^.^) of native (Musal) manufacture is sometimes used. In an average year the return for seed sown is about 8 or 10-fold ; and the 'Alwas or grain-stores which are a feature of many country- towns, along with the statistics of the export trade attest a frequent surplus of cereals in some districts. The best wheat and barley lands probably are (or till recently were) those about Hillah on both sides of the Euphrates, the surplus produce of which is sent down the'IRAQ (TURKISH) Euphrates In native ^ Basrah, for local consumption or shipment. The neighbourhood of 'Amarah Town also is becoming known for its wheat and barley. Beans are planted at the end of September and are harvested in the beginning of April, but green beans appear in the market about the middle of February. Beans are of various kinds^ including the broad, French, and haricot varieties ; and large quantities of them, when dried, are exported to Indian ports and to Jiddah on the Red Sea. Hurfcuman, described as a sort of oats, is sown in January and reaped about the end of May. The autumn crops are rice, called Timn ^ or Shilib maize or Idhrah, sesame, a millet Known as Dukhn Mash (a lentil), Lubiyah (a kidney pea) ^y, and, of course, dates: some cotton also is grown, but chiefly outside the limits with which we have to deal. Rice is the chief item of the autumn harvest and in the Baghdad market is of 4 principal kinds : the best are Nakkazah ^ and ; Ambarbu the second of these being a peculiarly scented variety esteemed by Indians and Persians; the third is Shimbah which is the comironest kind; and the fourth is Huwaizawi a cheap, reddish rice consumed by the poorer classes. Rice straw, called Buh is utilised as fodder for cattle. The principal rice grounds are on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah between Tawairij and Kufah, especially about Hor-ad-Dukhn j on the Dagharah canal; in the Qadhas of Shamiyah and Samawah ; and in the part of the country adjoining 'Amarah Town. Idhrah is sown in March and reaped in August or September. Sesame is grown on plains which are inundated by the rivers in their rise and dry up again in the course of the summer, and it is seen also along the banks of creeks from the Shatt-al^ Arab in the Basrah Qadha; most of it is pressed for oil, which is used m cooking and for lighting purposes, but some is roasted and eaten with bread, and some is used in the manufacture of sweet meats or Halawah Dukhn, sown at the end of March and reaped in August or September, is cultivated on a large scale upon the Tigris and even more upon the Euphrates : some is used locally as food for cattle and poultry or is mixed with wheat to make bread: the remainder is exported by way of Basrah. Mash is of two kinds, green and black, both of which are sown in the end of June ; the green ripens at the middle or end of September, the black in the beginning of November. Mash is cultivated on damp, sandy plains and does not require watering ; the natives mix it with rice to make soup, and a large quantity is exported to India. Lubiyah is sown in J une and harvested in October; it grows on river'IRAQ (TURKISH) 795 banks and on plains inundated by the rise of the rivers; it begins to be sold green as a vegetable in June or July; when dry it is assorted into red and white, the red kind being the cheaper. Lubiyah is locally con sumed, but some is exported to India. The lentil proper or 'Adas of 'Iraq is inferior. Dates are of many sorts^ and the immense plantations which fringe the banks of the Shatt-al-' Arab below and above Basrah Town are probably the finest in the world. There is also a noble stretch of date groves some 30 miles in length upon both sides of the (old) bed of the Euphrates above and below Hillah Town, but these are declining in consequence of the diversion of the Euphrates into the Shatt-al -Hindiyah. Another large date growing tract is at Shifathah to the west of Karbala. Good date plantations exist also around Baghdad City, Karbala Town and Kufah and at other places. The subject of date culture and the date trade is more fully dealt with elsewhere in a special Appendix of the Grazetteer. Common fruits are water-melons, marsh-melons, pomegra nates, oranges (in the Baghdad Wilayat), sweet and sour limes ; apncots &gt; quinces and grapes ; almonds, figs, olives, citrons, apples, nectarines and peaches grow—the citrons at , 'Hillah and the peaches at Bghailah among other places—but the last three are of poor quality; there are also mulberries at Karbala and upon the course of the Diyalah. Among the vegetables of''Iraq are onions, radishes, beetroot, garlic, cucumbers, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, carrots, tomatoes, artichokes, ladies' fingers, brinjols, lettuce, cress, pumpkins of 3 kinds and potatoes; but garlic, though used in great quantities, is imported to a larger ex tent than it is grown, mostly from Persia, while potatoes are of recent introduction and have not yet come into general use except among the well-to-do. Tobacco, known as Dukhan or Tutun , which is. a state monopoly, is grown in certain localities only, principally about Karbala and Najaf, but also to the north-east of Baghdad City in the Diyalah valley. In the Baghdad Wilayat cultivated lands are classified according to the means of irrigation ; thus we have, though rarely, lands watered only by rainfall and called Daim ^ ; lands watered by lifts with 44 pulleys and therefore called Bakrah or, if the means of irrigation is a bucket, Saqi ^; finally we have lands irrigated from canals and known as Saih ^ . Marshes and drying pools, when cultivated, are styled Kibis ^ (pronounced Chibis); and land moistened by little runnels, such as are used in rice fields, is known as Chaltiq*96 ^RAQ (TURKISH) Canals are numerous, but they are seldom in good working order; A number o£ them are specified by name in the articles on the rivers Euphrates, Tigris, and Shatt-al -Hindiy ah ; the most important, to which separate articles are devoted^ are the Dagharah, Husainiyah., and JaMlah. Water-lifts are generally used for date gardens, and some arable land also along the banks of the two great rivers is irrigated by their means. Lifts are of two kinds, the Karad (pronounced Charad) and the Na'ur In the Karad the water is hoisted in a camel-skin bucket, termed Dalu by means of a rope which passes over a pulley; while in the Na'ur it is raised by a series of buckets slung from a revolving wheel: the Na'ur is of comparatively recent introduc tion and is cheaper in working than the Karad but not so effectual; both kinds of apparatus are actuated by animal power, and both have their counterparts in India. In the neighbourhood of Baghdad City centrifugal pumps worked by oil engines have been introduced and promise to become popular. The easiest and most natural irrigation of all is in the Shatt-al -^Arab region where the sea-tides raise the fresh water of the river, twice in the hours, almost to the level of the cultivated land. The proportions in which the produce that remains after Govern ment has taken its share is divided between the Mallak or pro prietor and the Fallah ^ or actual cultivator vary with the class of land and are sometimes not the same in the spring as in the autumn harvest, The grain for seed is sometimes supplied by the owner, and in other cases provided by the cultivator. Livestock. —Domestic animals are cattle everywhere ; buffaloes in the marshy tracts, which are of an excellent class but are said to suffer from the cold in winter and from the attacks of insects in summer; fat-tailed sheep yielding mutton almost equal to that of Europe; donkeys of average, and mules of good quality ; camels, a proportion of which are very light in colour ; and horses, which have a high reputation but are not equal to those of Najd or Syria. Some good horses, however, are reared in the Hillah and Diwamyah Qadhas : the best cattle are those of the tract about 'Amarah Town. The Bani Lam tribe are celebrated for their horses, camels and sheep, and the A1 Bu Muham mad for their buffaloes. Tame birds are pigeons, fowls, turkeys, ducks and geese; the turkeys and fowls are exceptionally fine. Trade generally. —During the last 20 years a substantial, and on the whole steady, increase has been observable in the volume of trade in Iraq,'IRAQ (TURKISH) 797 and it still, apparently, continues. It is attributed to the spread of wliat has been styled a comparative civilisation^ in the country itself; and to a larger demand in Persia for the ' comparative luxuries ' which that country obtaines through 'Iraq. Bombay is felt, throughout ''Iraq, to be the nearest great centre of commerce and civilisation; and since the recent institution of a rapid steamer service to India it is a common though not strictly accurate remark among natives, that Bombay and Baghdad are equally distant from Basrah. Two facts in regard to the trade of 'Iraq should be clearly realised at the outset : first that it consists to a large extent merely of a transit trade between the Persian Gulf and W estern Persia, secondly that it has only one real centre, namely, Baghdad. The posi tion of unique importance occupied by Baghdad as a point of divergence and convergence in transit, in foreign, and even to some extent in internal trade is indeed remarkable; no less so is its mercantile pre dominance over Basrah, which, but for a local trade in dates and grain, would be little more than the seaport of Baghdad. The hides of 'Amarah often ascend the Tigris to be pressed at Baghdad for shipment to Europe, and the retail traders of Basrah itself obtain quantities of European ^oods, especially piece-goods, from the wholesale merchants of Baghdad. On the Tigris from 'Amarah town upwards, and in the Euphrates valley above Kufah and its neighbourhood, most commercial dealings are with Baghdad- Even the remainder of 'Iraq, though nearer to Basrah, is partially served from Baghdad through Basrah and other places. The commercial influence of Baghdad balances at Musal with that of Aleppo; and the whole of Kurdistan and the parts of Western Persia about Kirmanshah and Hamadan are dependent on Baghdad for their supply of foreign goods. As Basrah is the limit of ocean-borne traffic, so Baghdad marks the point where carriage by river, against the stream, ceases to be profitable; and, except for rafts which descend the Tigris from Musal to Baghdad, all commerce to the east, north, and west of the capital is carried on by mule or camel caravan. From a political point of view imports by sea and, in a lesser degree, exports by sea are the most important features of the trade of ^Iraq; but, in order to understand the basis on which ocean-borne imports and exports restj we must first examine the questions of internal trade, local manu factures and imports by land. Internal trade. —The functions of Baghdad are, in relation to inter nal trade, comparatively restricted; but it is the principal centre for them 'IBAQ (TURKISH) distribution of cotton piece-goods in the whole country. Moreover, it sends to Musal sugar, coffee, spices, twists, window-glass and metals but not piece-goods, which the people of Musal procure mostly throngli gyria^—and receives in return the best of the 'Awwasi or 'Awaisi * wool and the whole of the mohair and gall-nuts which constitute important items of the general export trade, besides oak and walnut wood, partly for exportation, and beams and rafters of poplar for local use. Ba'qubah is dependent on Baghdad for manufactured articles, and sends much fruit and firewood to Baghdad by way of the Diyalah river. The chief centres of internal trade in the west are Karbala, which imports piece-goods, sugar, kerosine, Indian spices, tea, Persian medicines and Persian fruit, and exports dates, consecrated objects, skins, wool and inferior tobacco; Musaiyib, which takes piece-goods and sends away wheat and barley; Tawairij, which buys piece- goods and sells wheat, barley and dates; Hillah, which imports piece- »oods, sugar and coffee on a large scale and exports wbeat, barley, sM, dates, sheep-skins and goat-skins on a still larger; finally Najaf, which receives larcc quantities of piece-goods, sugar, tea and Indian spices and disposes of lambskins and 'Abas. All of these receive their piece-goods from Baghdad, and the general trade of Musaiyib and Karbala seems to be mostly with Baghdad ; but Hillah and probably Najaf receive most of their goods (other than piece-goods) by way of the Euphrates Kufah, and Hillah exports its dates direct to Basrah. It is from these western districts that the capital draws a large part of its supplies of wheat and nec. On the Tigris below Baghdad, the towns of Kut-al-Amarali and ' Ali-al-Gharbi are the principal seats of the trade with Southern Kurdistan ; hereabouts many Kurds are settled, and Kurds from the Persian frontier come in to satisfy their wants, bringing with them ghi, skins, wool, galls, gum, aniseed, pistachios, walnuts and other nuts, in all of which there is a considerable trade. Kut-al-Aniarah deals c ic y with the Kurdish towns of Badrah ^ and Jassainc/W, which lie within the Turkish frontier but at a distance from the Tigris; at 'All-al-Gharbl wbeat and barley from the surrounding plains are accumulated. 'Amara Town is to some extent a centre of the Kurdish trade, but it is also a marjs *'Awwasi wool is otoined from a crossbreed between the Arab or Bheep and the Kurdish or bill-reared sheep. Arab wool is fine and cur y, coarse and straight; while'Awwasi, which is considered to form a class y intermediate between the two.? IRAQ (TURKISH) 799 for tlie produce of the surrounding 1 Bani Lam and A1 Bu Muhammad tribes; consequently we find it to be a considerable emporium of ghi, hides., wool, rice and, to some extent, of barley and wheat. QaFat Salih., further down the Tigris, is a centre of the rice trade ; and dates, wheat, barley, rice, straw, date-mats and reed-mats can all be procured at Qurnah., though the trade of that place is not so large as might from its position have been expected. Camels for export are mostly collected at Samawah, Diwani- yah and Najaf; sheep 5 cattle and buffaloes in the neighbourhood of 'Amarali. The Shi^ah pilgrimages to Karbala, Najaf, Kadhimain and Samarrah are an important factor in the internal trade of ^Iraq; they are the cause, for example, of an immense demand for forage at Kadhi- main, where most of the pilgrims leave their riding-animals for several days during their absence at Karbala and Najaf, and of the existence at the same town of a good supply of carpets brought by the pilgrims from Persia. The trade in sacred objects and souvenirs, such as Turbahs (praying-tablets made of the earth of the holy places) and winding sheets stamped with verses from the Quran, which is of some value at Karbala and Najaf, likewise depends upon the custom of pilgrims. There are no wholesale carriers or forwarding agents in the countrv, and transport must be specially engaged whenever merchandise is to be moved. Additional light will be cast upon internal trade by the remarks on local manufactures which follow. Manuf actures. —Baghdad City is the chief seat of industries, but these are not mechanical; in fact, apart from a private ice-factory, the Army Clothing Factory and Army Flour Mills of the Turkish Grovern- ment, and two out of several wool-presses, the town cannot boast of any machinery driven by steam. At or near Basrah Town there are two British wool-presses and one American liquorice-press, also a soda-water factory owned by an Indian and a flour mill and an ice-machine belonging to a Jew. At ; Amarah Town there is one British wool-press; and at Kut-al-Amarah are one British-owned and one native-owned wool-press. An important element in some of the most characteristic manufactures of Baghdad is a kind of silken thread, called Sha'ri ; the true Sha^ri is said to be a vegetable product, but Assam or Moga' silk, imported from Calcutta, is also used and is described as ShaM. At Baghdad silk thread is woven into a stuff called Aghabani ^ from which light summer clothing, especially 'Abas, is manufactured800 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Silk is also used to embroider turbans^ girdles,, tableclotlis, curtains and counterpanes in a special style; the art is almost entirely confined to Jewesses and a few female Christians. Long pieces embroidered with silk are called Kashidsh and are used as headdresses, square pieces are known as Charqand : many of the embroidered turbans are exported to Northern Africa. Striped cotton piece-goods are manufactured at Baghdad, in imitation of those of Damascus, and arft made into Zabuns or Antaris &lt;/)&amp;!, that is into the long body-garments worn by men, and into long waistcoats or jackets called Duglahs ^ : other materials locally woven and applied to the same use are Alajah ^ J T , a cotton fabric, and Qutni a mixture of silk and wool. Women's veils, called Yashmaq women's shawls or sheets, called Charshafs and Izars jlyJ are made at Baghdad; also ladies' ornamental belts and kerchiefs of various kinds in silk, cotton and wool; the handkerchiefs for ladies are embroidered with silk, and the kerchiefs for Arabs, called Kafiyahs mS and generally fringed or tasselled, are dearer but more durable than those of Manchester make. Coarse cotton cloth for the wear of the poorer classes is made at Baghdad, also canvas for tents; but tents of Indian or Persian material are preferred by the well-to-do, who use them for camping out in spring and autumn. There is some silk-weaving at Kadhimain, and the silk-embroidered handkerchiefs of that town have a sale in Algeria and Tunis. Haramat oUI^ or woollen rugs and Zull Jj or coarse carpets are manufactured at Kut-al-Amarah, and rough Kurdish carpets, both cheap and durable, at 'Amarah Town : these close the list of textiles. 'Abas or Arab cloaks are manufactured at Baghdad City, at the towns of Kadhimain, Karbala, Najaf ,'Amarah,Suq-ash-Shuyukli and at the village of Qurnah : those of Baghdad are sometimes of silk, but gen erally of wool, with gold or silk embroidery •, those of Najaf are frequently of silk embroidered with gold ; those of ' Amarah are in great demand at Baghdad and in the neighbourhood ; those of Qurnah, called Khachiyah or Batiyah are famous for their lightness and can, it is said, be passed through a finger-ring. Jewellers are found in all the principal towns, and the Sabian gold and silver-smiths of Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Shatrat-al -Muiitafik and 'Amarah Towns are among the best; the jewehers of 'Amarah have an art, possibly peculiar to themselves, of inlaying silver with antimony. Combs and small objects of ivory, wood and tortoise-shell are made a Kadhimain, chiefly by Persians; and filigree work in the precious'IRAQ (TURKISH) 801 metals and elaborate engraving on mother-of-pearl are executed at Karbala. More solid industries are those o£ tanning and working leather^ which have their principal seat in Baghdad City and its suburbs. The tanneries are chiefly at Mu'adhdham, where a large number of hands are employed in 40 establishments and 5,000 sheepskins and goat skins are turned out every week. At Kadhimain are similar tanneries on a smaller scale. The leather, though only rough-tanned, finds a ready sale in Europe. From local leather are made, at Baghdad and in Mu'adhdham^ the Yamanis or red and yellow shoes worn by Arabs and old-fashioned Baghdadis of other classes; also the slippers called Papiish or Babuj ^jb and a kind of boot known as Masht the latter being a kind of yellow top-boot which is worn by old Muhammadan females. The Baghdad coppersmiths are experts in their craffc and make boilers, kettles, coffee-pots and large copper dishes. House-building is understood in many places, and the Juss or gypsum-mortar commonly used is prepared in quantities at Mahmudiyah between Baghdad and Musaiyib and at Zubair near Basrah. Encaustic or Kashi tiles are made by Persians, mostly at Karbala, but also at Kadhimam and Baghdad. At Kadhiixiain are numerous good Persian painters and decorators. The clay earthenware of Baghdad, very light-coloured and porous, is exported to Basrah and other nearer places; the commonest articles are water-coolers and filters called Hubbs often of large size, and Jarrahs ^ or goblets. Boats and canoes are built at Qal'at Salih, Shatrat-al-Mimtafik, Suq-ash-Shuyukh and other places. Much of the ^Araq ^ or native spirit consumed in the Baghdad and Basrah districts is distilled at Qararah on the Tigris three miles from Baghdad ; the basis of the spirit is derived from Zahdi dates; aniseed, orange-peel, mastic and cardamoms are other ingredients: there is also some distillation at Hillah, but the produce is said to be inferior. Import trade hy land. —The import trade by land is chiefly on the Persian side, whence gums, opium and carpets are brought in some quantity, also fruit including apples and pears. Wheat also is obtained from Persia for local consumption in years of scarcity, but not generally, except at Basrah, for exportation abroad. The most valuable of the imported gums is gum tragacanth, which is handled in flake, not in powder, and is used for the best varnishes ; there is no gum Arabic, but 3 F802 'IRAQ (TURKISH) a considerable trade is done in another gum which exudes from the bitter-almond tree and was believed, until a few years ago, to he insoluble. Samag-h is the generic name in Arabic of all tree-gums. A number of the articles, already enumerated in a previous paragraph, which reach Baghdad from Musal are actually of Persian origin. Some imports which are received partly by land and partly by sea are mentioned in the paragraph below on imports by sea. External trade generally.—W\i\\ the agricultural resources, local manufactures and overland imports of the country before us, we are now in a position to approach the subject of sea-borne imports and of all kinds of exports ; and, in view of the smallness of the cultivated area and of the trivial character of the manufactured articles, we shall not be surprised to find that the foreign trade of 'Iraq is of moderate dimensions and that the land-borne traffic upon the Persian side is one of its most important items—in other words, that the trade of the country is largely a transit trade. Imports and exports at the port of Basrah are the measure of the foreign trade, goods for the interior being all included in the shipping returns of that place; consular statistics, however, in 'Iraq have to be compiled without access to reliable returns, and it is sometimes impossible to reconcile the figures for Basrah with those foi Baghdad which they are supposed to include. Import trade ly sea. —The total annual value of goods imported by sea may be taken at £1,300,000 sterling, of which nearly a half represents cotton-goods from Great Britain alone. The trade in cottons is chiefly io the hands of the Jews, some of whom have agents, generally near relations, in London or Manchester: at Baghdad cottons probably amount to as much as three-fourths of the total imports in value. Ihe trade in white and grey shirtings is practically a Jewish monopoly, but about one-fourth of the prints are imported by British firms. Next in order of value after cotton goods is sugar, both loaf and ciushed . someis from Belgium, Austria and Egypt, but the great bulk of it is from France which also supplies (but in small quantities) leather foi manufacture of European boots and shoes, silk goods, satins, gold broca &gt; broadcloth, brandy and Bordeaux wine. The Oriental Christian merchan s of Baghdad mostly trade with France, as the Jews do with Englan , but there is not in this any basis of political sentiment. Wood an^ timber, coffee, gunnies, metals, yarn and twist, spices, kerosene and are the principal remaining imports. The imported wood is mostly date-boxes and comes from Austria; but bastard teak, locally calle'IRAQ (TURKISH) 803 is iinp6rted by an Indian firm at Basrah from Calicut and Singapore: nearly all building-timber, planks and charcoal are from Indian potts, the charcoal being from Karachi, but part of the building timber is from Russia, Sweden and Norway. Coffee is principally Brazilian; but India supplies the gunnies, the cotton yarn and twist and the spices. Indigo also is brought in considerable, and tea in increasing, quantities from British India : about f of the tea is now from India. Iron, the metal most imported, is of British origin. Kerosene is from Russia, but only part of it is received through a Russian medium: the Indian firm already mentioned imports some kerosene direct from Batoum. America, whose trade with 'Iraq is every year greater, sends cheap blankets, bed-sheets and watches, and nearly all the stockings now sold in the Baghdad bazaar are of American manufacture, but the quantity of these last is small. Germany and Austria supply cheap fancy articles, fezes, crockery, low-priced clothes sometimes second-hand, penknives, articles of German silver, sewing-machines and all sorts of haberdashery : the best candles are from Holland, and the best window glass is from Belgium. There are, in addition to the sea-imports just enumerated and to the land-imports from Persia already specified, some imports, partly by sea and partly by land, from other provinces of the Ottoman empire ; goods from Constantinople, however, are now received chiefly by sea, and those from Aleppo largely so via Alexandretta. Such imports are blankets, flannels, fezes, bath-towels, ladies' shoes, slippers, knives and fancy articles from Constantinople, and native soap, rope, pistachios, silk and gold-thread from Aleppo and Damascus; Aleppo to a greater extent than Baghdad supplies the cotton piece-goods of Musal. Silk for embroidery is from Syria and Northern Persia, except the ^Moga^silk from the East which is so largely used in Baghdad embroideries. It is estimated by experts that no less than three-fourths of the foreign goods imported into Baghdad are re-exported to Persia. Export trade ly Dates are the most valuable export by sea, and m 1905 those despatched by sea from Basrah were estimated to be worth £345,184; most are grown in the Basrah neighbourhood and sent to England and America, but some Zahdi and Kursi dates from the plantations about Baghdad are consigned, packed in skins, to Egypt, the Levant and the Black Sea ports. Wheat and barley taken together generally hold the second place, barley, much of which is from the Shatt-al -G-haraf and 'Amarah districts, greatly predominating over wheat in spite of the fact that wheat is the only grain which leaves Baghdad 3 f ^804 'IRAQ (TURKISH) for abroad. Wool and mohair, Persian opium, seeds (including Idhrah, Dukiin, Mash, sesame, linseed and hemp), Kurdistan gall-nuts, skins and hides succeed grain and follow one other in order of importance; next are horses, and Persian carpets, the last mostly through Baghdad ; then gum then liquorice-root. Other exports are intestines, to be utilised as sausage-skins, and dogs' dung which goes to Austria for use in the tanning of fine leather. There is a small trade with Bombay in Persian raisins, and Baghdad oranges and pomegranates have been exported experimentally to the same place. Ghi from 'Amarah and other places reaches Bombay, the Red Sea and even the ports of the Levant. Maize, colocynth and almond-kernels, the last for the manu facture of prussic acid, are also exported to a limited extent. The destination of the wool is London, Marseilles, America, Germany or Austria; of the gall-nuts London, Bombay or Persia; of the gums London, Marseilles and sometimes New York and Austria; of the wheat the Red Sea coast and London ; of the opium Hongkong, except a little which goes to Singapore and Europe ; of the skins and hides Constan tinople, France and the United Kingdom. Some walnut wood is sent to Marseilles, and 85 per cent, of the liquorice-root is taken by America, where the liquorice-paste with which American tobacco is sweetened is manufactured from it. The liquorice business in 'Iraq is now managed by an agency of the American Tobacco Trust. The root is collected in the winter months when it contains most juice and, after being weighed and cured at the receiving stations, is forwarded to Basrah where it is baled by hydraulic power. The value at Basrah at the time of export is about £6 a ton and the average quantity of the root exported is at present about 4,000 tons per annum. The trade in horses to India is important though not very large ; the number shipped from Basrah in 1905 was 2,262. Persian carpets and hides and dates find a market at Constantinople; and Persian carpets, ' Moga' silk articles, ladies Izars, dates and spices in Syria : the spices are largely Indian. Most^ of the Persian carpets, however, go to America and London, and high prices are realised in those markets for old ones ; new carpets are not appreciated as they frequently owe their colours to aniline dyes. The total value of the exports by sea is about £1,300,000 annually, or the same as the value of the sea-borne imports. Export trade hy land. —The wares for places on the Mediterranean are sent partly by sea and partly by caravan, but one of the principal exports,—that of camels, buffaloes, cattle and sheep,—takes place entiiely overland ; the camels are collected at Samawahand Najaf, and the other'IRAQ (TURKISH) m gLnimals are assembled mostly in the neighbourhood of ^Amarah Town whence they are marched in huge droves up the Tigris to Musal and from there across country to Aleppo and Alexandria, the agents of the pur chasers accompanying them to settle the difficulties of the road. The ultimate destination of the camels and part of the cattle is Egypt : the remainder of the cattle and the sheep are disposed of in Syria. The trade of ^Traq with Najd is not what it once was, owing to the competition of the Kuwait and Hasa routes, by which Central Arabia now receives a large proportion of the manufactured goods that it con sumes; but of late years the disturbances in Najd and Jabal Shammar and the insecurity of the more southern roads have brought about a certain revival by which Samawah and other towns on the lower Euphrates have benefited; and occasional visits of the Hadrah, also called Risalah ) a commercial and purchasing mission from Jabal Shammar to Najaf, have not ceased. At some places on the western frontier, such as Shifathah, there is a periodical Bedouin fair or market known as Musabalah aJjL ** . Formerly there was a much frequented route from Basrah to Najd on which the first stage was Zubair Town. The exports to Najd are few and ^simple, consisting chiefly of cotton- prints for clothing, cotton and silk handkerchiefs for head-coverings, sugar, coffee, enamelled iron ware and in some years grain, the last from Karbala and Najaf. The outward trade to Persia is, as already pointed out, simply a later phase—and an important one—of the inward trade to Baghdad. nng and river traffic, —In 1905 the number of ocean steamers that entered the port of Basrah was 169 with a net tonnage of 189,440 &gt; and of these 163 were British. In the same year sailing-vessels numbered 618 and had a net tonnage of 37,731 ; 120 of these were under the British flag, and the remainder were nearly all Persian, Turkish or Arabian. The greater share of the Tigris traffic, so far as carried by steamer, falls to the Dairat-as-Saniyah, which has 6 boats, and the remainder to the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who are not allowed by the Turkish Government to employ more than 2 steamers.* Cotton and sugar upwards, and wool, carpets, skins, mohair, gum, opium and gall-nuts downwards are chiefly con veyed by steamer; but other commodities, such as grain and liquorice, which are either more bulky or have to be picked up at many points, travel by native boat. • They have now permission to use thre6 (1908).806 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Trade customs, credit, and commercial system. —A fehort statement of mercantile customs and of the manner in which trade generally is con ducted will not be out of place here : information regarding import, transit and export duties will be found under the head of taxation below. At Baghdad, the trade of which is typical of the trade of the country 7 all weighments, except of consignments between principal and agent or vice versa, are made by public weighmen. These indivi duals, called Qabanchis visit the premises where their services are required and receive fees from the merchants who employ them • their testimony is supposed to prevent subsequent disputes. Another universal institution is Dallalah or agency -, and without the presence of a Dallal at least on one of the sides, no bargain is ever struck, The principals may be in accord before they meet, but the agreement is only concluded by a Dallal's declaration of the fact, which he generally accompanies by au emphatic gesture j the commission of the Dallal runs from ^ to 1 per cent. Even European merchants at Baghdad find it advisable to defer to these two local customs: at Basrah, however, there are no Qabanchis. Cash transactions are uncommon in the course of internal trade, a reduction being expected if cash is paid, and the usual method of settle ment is by Kambiyalah * a species of biil or promissory note issued between parties residing in the same place, maturing in from three months to two years and perfectly negotiable when backed by a good name; or, when the parties belong to different places, by an ordinary inland bill or by sending specie insured through the Turkish Post Office, for there is no system of money orders in 'Iraq; but the last mentioned method is not much in vogue. In foreign trade, orders for goods are sent direct to Europe by the larger firms only, and small merchants generally avail themselves of the credit of the larger to obtain European goods. This is arranged by each of the smaller merchants paying a percentage against his order to the patron; the patron then obtains and pays for the whole consignment, and on its arrival distributes the goods to the clients who ordered them, — at Baghdad sometimes on credit, but at Basrah only on receiving cash payment or a Kambiyalah. Some merchants who are without credit in Europe obtain goods thence direct by causing the bill of lading to be sent to a bank or well- known firm from whose custody they release it by paying the value of # The word Kambiyalah is used in Egyptian Arabic also* It is derived no doubt from the Italian camhlaUi a bill of exchange.'IRAQ (TURKISH) 807 the goods according to the invoice. Payment for good.s exported to Europe is obtained by the larger merchants through their own agencies there, but they generally draw against the bills of lading to the extent of three-fourths, the balance of the transaction being settled afterwards. Among the smaller merchants a custom prevails of consigning goods to commission agents in Europe and drawing against the bill of lading as soon as the goods are shipped; but this is a risky method and users of it have frequently been ruined by the failure of their consignments, owing to a fall in values, to realise prices equal to the amounts drawn against them. Small merchants also sometimes obtain three-fourths of the value of their bills of lading from the shippers, to whom they make them over, and a complete settlement takes place later between the parties. A European firm at Baghdad is generally engaged in both import and export trade and conducts its business through native correspondents, each of whom serves it in all the lines in which it may happen to deal. A European house in general business at Baghdad has probably corre spondents at Hillah, Musal, Kirkuk, Sulaimaniyah^ Kirmanshah and Hamadan through whom, in case of the local rates being favourable^ it will order its requirements ; otherwise the arrival of the commodities at Baghdad in the ordinary course of trade will be awaited. European houses seldom, it is said, have cause to complain oF dishonesty in their native agents. At Basrah, none of the British firms are interested in the import trade to any large extent* /T eights, —No account of the commerce of ; Iraq would be complete without a refetence to the system of weights and measures, and to the currency, all of which are extremely complicated and confusing. The standards of weight vary from place to place, and we shall therefore deal chiefly with those of Baghdad, the commercial capital. At Baghdad two systems of weighment exist side by side which may be called the local and the non-local. The first is applied^ with certain exceptions, to local produce and is founded upon the Baghdad or large Huqqah or ^ —. in English generally called 'Oke'—of 81b. 12oz. 8dr. English : the other has for its basis the Constantinople Huqqah ^ of 21b. 12oz. 12dr. English and is used for all imported, and even for certain other articles. The &lt;&amp;) i i i A ' m i ^ j ■80B 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Baghdad local weights remain the same whatever the substance weighed and are as follows : — 1 Ruba J 4 Ruba' =1 Waqiyah ^ ui 4 Waqiyah = 1 Huqqah Huqqahs = 1 Charak = Charaks Manns = 1 Mann = 1 Waznah = lbs. oz. dr. English. 0 8 124 2 3 2 8 12 8 13 2 12 52 11 0 210 12 0 4,215 0 0 4 4 20 Waznahs = i Taghar The non-local weights are variable : gall-nuts are weighed by tlie Qantar of 223| Constantinople Huqqahs or 624 lb. 4oz. dr. English; wool by the Mann of 12J Constantinople Huqqahs or 33 lb. 15 oz. 6 dr. English ; wood and charcoal by a Waznah of 50 Constantinople Huqqahs or 139 lb. 3 oz. 8 dr. English; wheat and barley by a different Waznah of 78 Constantinople Huqqahs or 218 lb. 2 oz. 8 dr. English. In the case of wool the Constantinople Huqqahs is also called an Astanah dull-f; in the case of gall-nuts it is sub-divided into 4 Waqiyahg of 11 oz. 3 dr. English each ; in tlie case of wood, 20 Waznahs or 1,000 Constantinople Huqqahs make a Taghar of 3,784 lb. 6 oz. 0 dr. English. The French kilogramme, equal to 2*20485 lb- English, is in use to a limited extent as an official measure under the name o£ Huqqah 'Ashshari or decimal Huqqah, and 100 kilogrammes are treated in the case of grain as equivalent to 1 Waznah, Apothecaries employ the French kilogramme with its sub-divisions and multiples. Thus there are at least two kinds of Waqiyah, three of Huqqah, two of Mann, three of Waznah and two of Taghar in simultaneous use at Baghdad. The foregoing weights correspond to our Avoirdupois; those that follow, used at Baghdad, correspond to our Troy : — Ml 1 Qirat * or Habbah &amp;X*, 16 Qirat = i Dirham 14 Dirham t =1 Mithqal Baghdad 100 Mithqal = 3*09375 grains English. — 49^ „ ;; 74i Baghdad — 1 Chaki = 150 oz. 225 ,, )&gt; These are used for weighing precious metals and stones : there is iilso a Mithqal ''Ajami 0 f 22^ Qirats or 69i grains used only for weighing pearls. * From this word is derived the Ranae of our cavcit of 4 grains. •j' Probably from the Greek drachma, whence also our drachm and dram. pH'IRAQ (TURKISH) ( g og At Basrah the unit of local weight is a Huqqah of 2 lb. 12 oz English and the local Waqiyah is 2| Hnqqahs. A Mann of ghee at Basrah is 50 local Hnqqahs and a Mann of grain 60; and the Basrah Taghar, containing 1,200 Hnqqahs is treated as roughly equivalent to If tons English. Measures. — At Baghdad there are three measures of length, each founded upon a different Dhara' or ' yard.' The Dhara' Baghdad ^ gji or Baghdad yard is the most generally used and is equal to 291 English inches; it is subdivided into 4 Charaks of 7 T V inches apiece, and each of these again into 4 'Aqads JUof Iff inches apiece. The Dhara' Halab gjo or Aleppo yard is employed in measuring silks and woollens and is equal to 26| inches; it is subdivided in a similar manner to the Baghdad yard, giving a Charak consequently of 6| and an 'Aqad of li| inches. I n measuring carpets and in other transactions with Persians the standard is the Dhara' Shah aU of about 41 inches; its Charak, also called a Ruba', equals 101, and its 'Aqad 2f inches. British goods are estimated in British yards, and other European goods in French metres. Thus we have three different Charaks of length, as well as the Charak of weight, and a Ruba' of length besides the Euba' of weight. There are no standard measures for liquids, and these are sold by the pot or the bottle, the pots being of all sizes and the bottles generally reputed pints or quarts. Distances, except in official measurements which are made by kilome- ties, are estimated in hours and days ; the unit is the space covered by a walking horse in sixty minutes and so fluctuates from about 3 to 4| miles. The commonest unit of land measurement is the Faddan olvJ, which varies in size from one place to another and at Baghdad is variously defined as 'the area that two men can cultivate' or 'a surface that can be completely sown with 500 Huqqahs of wheat and 700 Huqqahs of barley,' in all 1,200 (Constantinople) Huqqahs. The Baghdad Faddan is also described as containing 200 Donums each of 919 square metres, and as being equal to 18 Jaribs each of 10,000 square metres or rather more : this would give the Faddan an area of about 44 i acres, e Donum, it should be mentioned, is subdivided into 1,600 Dhira' i Mamari There is also a Juft the area that a yoke of n ocks can plough, which is from 70 to 100 Donums. At Basrah the t ^n 18 unknown and the ^t of land measurement is a Jarib J is about equal to 1| English acres and is supposed to contain 100 date palms.810 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Currency, —The question of the currency in 'Iraq is difficult and complicated. The only fixed standard of value is the Lirah or Turkish pound; ordinarily worth about I85. of British moneyand to it all other coins and denominations must be regarded as subsidiary; they are numerous and some of them are fictitious, while the values of others are fluctuating. The subject is discussed below with reference to Baghdad rather than to Basrah. The Lirah is habitually resolved into no less than six different varieties of piastre or Qursh all of which are fictitious. The first of these is the ' gold ' piastre, which is simply of a Lirah and is the official piastre of the Turkish Government ; all taxes and all payments to State departments must be rendered in gold piastres; for example a one piastre postage stamp can only be purchased for a coin which, whatever its denomination may be, is currently worth of a Lirah. ou The next three kinds o£ piastre are all termed Majidiyah &lt;0^* but properly the name belongs to the first of them alone, of which 102 6 go to a Lirah; the Imperial Ottoman Bank keeps its accounts in these as well as in gold piastres. The remaining sorts of Majidiyah piastre are one of which 103*5, and another of which 108, are equal to a Lirah; the former of these is used by merchants in keeping their own books and for wholesale transactions generally, while the latter is employed partly for ease of calculation and partly on account of its close correspondence in value to the actual silver coin called a Qursh Sagh ^ uZj* . The two remaining kinds of piastre, both called Raij ate employed in retail accounts ; of the one there are 4)4 and of the other 4)31 to the Lirah, from which it will be seen that they are merely quarters of the Majidiyah piastres standing at 103*5 and 108 to the Lirah. 'We now come to the actual medium of circulation. There are five Turkish gold coins of 5, 1, | and $ Lirahs respectively; but the first two are rarely seen, and the last is not very common. The chief Turkish silver coin is the Majidi L5'^3r-' c which is worth 18*5185 gold piastres, 19, 19*166 and 20 respectively of the various kinds of Majidiyah piastre, and 76*666 and 80 respectively of the two sorts of Raij piastre. In cash transactions, in the absence of a special understanding, 5*4 Majidis are accepted as the equivalent of one Lirah. The table of smaller coins and their approximate English values is as follows: the Parah'IRAQ (TURKISH) 811 8jO ; with wliich it opens, is an imaginary coin ; but the others (in the second column) have a material existence :— £ s. d. 5 Parahs =7 1 Fulsain # q q qi 2 Fulsain = 1 Qursh Raij ^ jtji or Mitliq ^ . . = 0 0 0| 2 Mitliqs = 1 Qatnari - q q ^ 4 Mitliqs = 1 Qursh Sagh '£■* . . = 002 5 Mitliqs = 1 Ruba' Bashlik ^ or Abu Khamsah . = 0 0 8 Mitliqs - 1 Qurshain Sagh or AbuThamaniyah = 004 10 Mitliqs = 1 Nusf Bashlik or Abu ^Ashrah 2 Nusf Bashliks = 1 Bashlik i£)UUo or Ruba' Majldi , = 00 10i 3 Bashliks = 1 Nusf Majidi . = 0 1 8^ 3 Nusf Majidis = 1 Majidi ls ^ f ^ . . . == 0 3 5^ Of these small coins the Fulsain and Mitliq are believed to consist of nickel, the Qamari, Abu Khamsah and Abu 'Ashrah of some alloy; and the remainder of silver. The half and quarter Bashlik and the Fulsain are uncommon, and the others, except the Mitliq, are by no means plentiful. The deficiency is made up with foreign coin, chiefly Persian/ which circulates freely in spite of a prohibition against the use of foreign silver. Only a little Persian gold is seen; but various Persian coins make up the bulk of the silver currency, namely, the double Qran of 8^., the Qran ^ of 4 4&lt;Mhe half Qran of 26?., the quarter Qran of U. and a Sittah Fulus worth id. A Persian copper coin (erroneously called a Shahi is also in use; it is worth T \ of a penny. One Persian Tuman, as will be seen, is at the present time about equal to one Turkish Majidi, and there are over 50 Qrans to the Lirah; merchants'accounts, however, where kept in Qrans, are kept in a fictitious Qran of which 34-4 go to the Lirah. Indian silver is current, but is occasionally seized by the authorities under the law already mentioned. Persian silver, being absolutely indispensable to the continuance of business, is never inter fered with. Some English, French and Russian gold is in circulation, t remains to notice one more coin and that fictitious,—the Shami which is the unit of computation in the date trade. There was once * Douttless from metallique.812 'IRAQ (TURKISH) an actual coin of this name with a nominal value of 10 gold piastres, but that value having been reduced by order of the Turkish Government after the last Russo-Turkish war to 5 gold piastres, which was less than the price of the metal it contained, it was everywhere melted down and has now altogether disappeared except from the quotations of the date market, BanUng and exchange, —The only bank represented in the country is the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which has branches at Baghdad and Basrah. The Imperial Bank of Persia formerly had an establishment at Baghdad, but withdrew it in August 1893 in consequence of an agree ment with the Imperial Ottoman Bank. The rate of exchange with Europe is variable, falling as low as 105| per cent, in the date season and rising to as much as 110 and even more in winter. The Baghdad money market is controlled by rich Sarrafs who keep themselves informed by telegraph of exchange rates at Bombay, Constantinopole, Paris and London and so carry on a large business. The drafts most in request at Baghdad are those payable by the Kirmanshah, Tehran andTabriz branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia at three and four months^ sight. Time, —The day, in 'Iraq is divided into 12 hours of which the 12th ends at sunset; thus when the sun sets at 6 p.m . seven o'clock by local time corresponds to 1 p.m ., European style, and when it sets at 6-30 p.m . to 1-30 p.m ., European style. Land communications. —The subject of land communications is of less importance in 'Iraq than in most other countries. From the Persian Gulf to Baghdad and Musaiyib, admirable means of longitudinal communication are supplied by the great rivers, while the need for cross-routes is partially met by the Shatt-al -Gharaf, which links together except in the low season the best navigable portions of the Tigris and Euphrates ; by the meeting of the two rivers themselves at Qurnah &gt; and by various canals such as the JaheLlah and Husainiyah, not to mention innumerable marshes and lagoons connected with the rivers, on which boats can ply. In 'Iraq, to speak generally, hmd routes o any length neither exist nor are required; in the populous districts they would generally be obstructed as well as out-rivalled by watei-ways^ natural and artificial; while at a distance from the rivers the population is sparse and shifting, and there is consequently no need for fixed lines of communication. A few very important exceptions must be signal•IRAQ (TURKISH) 813 ised in the north: namely the routes from Baghdad to the Persian frontier, the routes from Baghdad to the north and north-west, the routes from Baghdad to Hillah and Karbala, and the route from Karbala to Najaf. In the south, land routes as a rule lie only between adjacent places and are of no consequence; but the route from Basrah to the Turkish frontier at Safwan forms an exception to the rule, and there is a road between Basrah and Fao behind the date plantations of the Shatt- al -'Arab which is frequented to a considerable extent. I. Routes from Baghdad to the We are not directly concerned here with the routes from Baghdad towards the Persian frontier; but we may note that the principal are (1) one to Khanaqin yrjajU., 95 miles, via Ba'qubah wyUj, Shahraban anc l Qizil Rubat iobj Jy ; and ,2) another to Mandali 79 miles, via Khan Baui Sa'ad o.*- Buhrlz and Bafadruz . II. Routes from Baghdad to Armenia These also do not come within the scope of the present Gazetteer. The chief route from Baghdad to the north is by Dujail Harbah ^ and Samarrah to Tikrit 104 miles ; while the main route to the north-west passes by Abu Ghuraib, Fallfljah, Rumadiyah and Hit and reaches Anah wc at 216 miles; the Tikrit route follows the Tigris, the ' Anah route the Euphrates line. Forty days is about the time taken by a laden caravan to reach the Mediterranean from Baghdad. III.

Water sometimes collects on either side of this bridge in pools 1^ feel deep, and might be an obstacle to guns but not to cavalry or infantry. From a short distance beyond this bridge to the Kharr Bridge (2 miles) the road runs along the top of an embankment which is revetted with brush wood and pierced at intervals by brick culvertp, giving pass age to lioods that cross the line of the road here in wet weather. '1 he top of the embankment is about 15 feet above the surrounding country and where it leads on to the Kharr Bridge it attains its maximum breadth of 45 feet. After crossing the Kharr Bridge the road trends to the left, separating from the bridge embank ment wbich continues westwards for about 2 miles and ends in the desert.

In the middle of Musaiyib town the Euphrates is crossed by a boat bridge of 24 pontoonB, at present a some what rickety and ill- maintained structure. The road for vehicles from Musaiyib to Karbala skirts the northern edge of the cultivation depen dent on the Husai- niyah canal at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from the canal; passes the tomb of 'Ann at 12 or 13 miles ; and finally enters Karbala by the Bab Baghdad bridge over the HuS* ainiyah, described in the article on that canal. [An alternative route, for horsemen and foot passengers, follows more closely the north bank of the Husainiyan. At about 7 from Musaiyib it crosses a medium* sized distributary from the Husai- niyah, empty and ruined; and imme-'IRIQ (TURKISH) 817 Name of place.

A short distance beyond the Wall, the road crosses the m Hamtidiyah distributary, which has banks 28 feet apart and 16 feet high, the flow of water in the same being similar to that in the Wall: the bridge over the Hamudiyah ia of brick and car ries a roadway 8 feet wide. At about miles from Musaiyib there is another distributary, known as the Abu Sulaiman ^ UaJU which is smaller than the preceding ones and is spanned by a very narrow bridge of wood and earth. Less than a mile further on, at 12 miles from Musaiyib, the road reaches Khan- al-'Ataishi, which is described in the article on the Husainiyah canal. For the next 5 miles the way lies along the right bank of the Husainiyah and a number of small canals are passed, the bridges over which are bad 3a818 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Name of place.

For the last several miles the way lies through dense date plantations; and in the last 3 miles, that is from the Pul-i- Sufaid to Karbala Town, there are continuous walled enclosures adjoining it on either side.] The route described above is not a made road; but in ordinary weather it is perfectly suitable for vehicles and is daily used by such: it is the main line of communication between Persia and the holy places of the Shr'ahs. Travellers by carriage ordinarily make the whole journey in one day, while others divide it into three stages by halts at Mahmudiyall and Musaiyib. Between Baghdad and Musaiyib the road lies over level clay plains which are generally barren, only for lack of irrigation, but in the neighbourhood of Mahmudiyah, Sikandariyah and Musaiyib are actually to some extent cultivated. The only shrub seen by the wayside between Mahmudiyah and Musaiyib is the small thorny plant, called simply Shok, which is used for facing embankments. In the cold weather large caravans of camels and small ones of donkeys are met with upon this road, carrying wheat and rice to Baghdad and mules conveying Persian corpses in the opposite direction for burial at Karbala or Najaf are a common sight. Cold northerly winds, accom panied if the weather is dry by clouds of dust, sometimes make travelling by the desert portion of this road extremely uncomfortable in winter. The Arabs of the country along this line were still, in 1905, armed chiefly with muzzle-loading guns, many of them double- barrelled. The Baghdad-Hill all line of telegraph, which is a double one, follows the alignment of the road pretty closely, as far as Musaiyib, now on one side and now on the other.

Khan-al-Haswah Distance by road and direction from last point. 14 mi South. Khan-al-Mahawil 14 miles. South. Khan-al-Haswah is a one storeyed Khan of the usual shape : it has a courtyard surrounded by 88 arched recesses which are intended as lodging places for travellers. Behind the recesses are rows of vaulted stables, dark but convenient. A parapet wall about four feet high runs all round the roof. The courtyard would accommodate 100 men, and the stables 150 animals. Attached to the Khan is a village of about 60 domed brick dwellings: the inhabi tants are nearly all Sun- nis. Two coffee shops exist, and there is a small Dhabitiyah post. A few animals are owned in the village *, supplies, except firewood, are prac tically nil. The soil in the neighbourhood is gritty, consisting of peb bles mixed with a sandy clay. The cultivation, of which there is a good deal in the direction of Sikandariyah, all he- longs to the Dairat-as- Saniyah. A Khan with walls 18 feet high outside, very similar to that at Khan-al- Haswah, but in worse repair. Attached to the Khan is a village of a.bout 600 inhabitants : it is surrounded by mud walls which are 10 feet high and are topped with thorns. The place is the headquarters of the Mahawil Nahiyah of the Hillah Qadha and consequently the seat of a Madir. There is one The road separates from the Karbala road about three miles south of Khan-al-Blr and gra dually diverges from it till at Khan-al-Has wah it is two miles south-east of Sikan dariyah village on the other road. The country beyond Khan- al-Bir is featureless ; but Khan-al-Haswah itself stands somewhat high, on the top of a slight eminence. From Khan-al-Haswah to Khan-al-Mahawil the country is desert but cultivable; and to some extent; it is actually cul tivated on the eastern side of the road. Be tween five and nine miles from Khan-al- Haswali three canals from the Euphrates cross the road ; the second and third are traversed by brick bridges, and the third is apparently the 3 a 3820 'IRAQ (TURKISH) l&gt;'»me of pluce.

A few animals and plenty of fuel are available ; but grain, notwithstanding a consideiable cultivated area, is generally scarce, being ex ported for sale. On the south side of the village flows the Mahawil canal from the Euphrates with a stream, in April, about 20 feet wide by 12 feet deep ; some 50 date palms belonging to the village stand on the bank of the canal. Nasriyah canal from the Euphrates. At eight miles from Khan- al Haswah is Khan-an* Nasriyah ^jJt a deserted hostelry upon the east side of the road. About half a mile short of Mahawil a small water channel is crossed. Hillah Town iL^) (13 miles. (, South. See article Hlllah Town . After crossing the Maha wil canal by a high brick bridge in bad repair, which carries a roadwuy 10 feet wide and rises 12 feet above the level of the water, the road traverses a plain strewn with debris which possibly mark the site of the city of Ha- shimiysh, the capital (before Baghdad) of the 'Abbasid Khalifahs, At about four miles from Mahawil the Khatuniyah canal from the Euphrates is crossed by a brick bridge ; and at seven miles is the Nil canal which has a similar bridge. For the next three miles the way lies amid the remains of the city of Babylon, now represented only by a mud-walled village called Kuwairish with about 300 inhabitants, most of whom are employed on the German excavations now in progress. Be tween Babylon and Hillah the principal canal crossed is the Wardiyah from the Euphrates.(442 'IRAQ (TURKISH) 821 The distance of Hillah from Baghdad by road is thus roughly 62 miles j and ; like the Karbala route^ this route is regularly used by wheeled carriages ; but beyond the point where it separates from the Karbala road the track is not so distinctly marked. Its character as far as Eabylon resembles that of the Karbala route up to Musaiyib ; for the country crossed is, apart from a few feeble canals and same sporadic cultivation, merely a -dry desert of clay. Emerging from the ruins of Babylon ; however, it enters cultivated country and runs for the remainder of the distance along the eastern edge of the celebrated Hillali date plan tations. Inconvenience from wind and dust is sometimes experienced on this road as upon the Baghdad-Karbala road. A double line of telegraph accompanies the road the whole way from Baghdad to HillaL V .—fioutefrom Karhala to Hillah.* —This route consists of two parts i the first section, from Karbala Town to Tawairij, is about 13 miles in length and has an almost south-easterly direction ; the second, from Tawairij to Hillah Town, is about 14 miles, and its direction is the same. For about one mile the date groves of Karbala flank the road on either side, and ; at four miles from the town, the lake known as the Hor-al-Husainiyah approaches the right of the road ; the water which escapes from this lake at its north-western corner is used for irrigation, but it sometimes spreads over the road and spoils it in places. At five or six miles fiom Karbala the road grazes the village of Sulaimaniyah, described in the article on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah., upon its southern side; and beyond this village is a bad slough which in time of flood can only be passed in boats. At miles short of Tawairij the Dawaihiyah, and at one mile short of Tawairij the ; Abd 'Auniyat—both canals from the Shatt- al -Hindiyah, in the article on which they are described—are passed by fording. The last two miles of the road are Very sandy. The single line of telegraph which connects Karbala with Tawairij follows the route described and is carried upon iron posts ; but at the Dawaihiyah and ^Abd ^Auniyat crossings it is slung upon high wooden masts» At Tawairij the route crosses from the right to the left bank of the Shatt -al-Hindiyall by a bridge of 21 boats at the town. The country traversed between Tawairij and Hillah is flat, rather sandy, and partly cultivated. The track itself is intersected by various canals from the Euphrates, which are wider and deeper as Hillah is approached.

The largest U) ^ of these canals, the Tajiyah still in use^ is crossed two miles before entering Hillah Town ; the enormous accumulations of silt-clearance which line its course make it appear from the distance like a high railway embankment. During the last three-quarters of the journey from Tawairij to Hillah. the Birs Nimrud mound and ruins are visible^ first to the right front and then on the right. In ordinary weather and in the absence of floods this route is an easy one for all but vehicular traffic ; in favourable circumstances and with preparation of the canal crossings near Tawairij and improvement of the bridges near Hlllah., it might perhaps be made passable fot wheeled carriages.

Khan Hamad consists of a large walled enclosure, 250 yards long by 100 yards wide, with 5 cara van sarais inside it opening one into the other. In these are the usual arched cubicles with stables behind them. The outer walls of the enclosure are 18 feet high, and, as there are parapets above the roofs of the stables, the whole could be easily defended against rifle fire. There is accommo dation for 500 horses and 1,000 men. Besides the large enclosure there are 2 or 3 small Khans and about 50 ordinary mud houses. Water is from wells and is said to be always sufficient ; but food and fodder are scanty. To the south of the place is sandy desert, and to the north and east of it are about 400 date trees. About midway between Nukhailah and Khan Hamad a stream bQ yards wide and 4 feet deep, said to be a branch of the Shatt-al -Hindi- yah, is twice struck on the left of the road ; this appears to bo a part of the Si'adah, mention ed again under the neat route.

At 11 miles the road enters a damp sandy depression or Sabakhah^ which continues-for 3 miles and ends 3 miles short of Safwan, which is 17 miles from Zubair. The whole of the country traversed between Basrah and Safwan is open, and it is generally barren; to the south of Zubair there is some gravel. Wheeled vehicles, if strong, could probably be taken by this route. YK.—Route from Basrah to Fdo. —There is a route from Basrah to FaO which runs along the eastern edge of the desert immediately behind the date plantations of the right bank of the Shatt-al -^Arab. It has not been possible to obtain a full account of this road; but so far as can be ascertained it presents no difficulties and is not anywhere interrupted by serious obstacles: the towns of Abul Khasib and Hamdan can be reached by its means. Another continuous road or path, called Wasti or Intermediate, is said to run from village to village the whole way from Basrah to Fao ; this one is nearer to the Shatt-al -'Arab than the first mentioned, and it is shaded throughout by date groves; but its course is crooked, and it is poorly provided with bridges, many of the numerous creeks and deep irrigation trenches encountered being spanned only by a single date log or crossed by means of ferry boats. There is also a third route, known as Hadar or Lower, which runs between Wasti and the river bank and appears to be the most difficult and discontinuous of the three. Transport and supply. —The general question of transport and supply in 'Iraq is a large one, and it is impossible here to enter on details such as are given in special works on the subject.* Trade is carried on between Baghdad and Karbala chiefly by camels and donkeys, between Baghdad and Khanaqin entirely by mules; and mules predominate * See in particular pages 17 to 25 and 96 to 97 of the Gazetteer of Baghdad, 1889. Since the statistics there given were compiled the price of horses has risen, and that of mules has fallen, about 20 per cent. Neither the pack-horse nor the mule of the country can carry more than 300 lbs. satisfactorily. The price of donkeys is now from £7 to £10, and they cannot ordinarily carry more than 200 lbs. The local farriers mentioned as available should be discounted, for they are so ignorant as to be more dangerous than useful. A quantity of new information on the subject of transport and supplies has recently become available in Captain H. Smyth's Reconnaissance Bejport, 1904, which contains some useful estimates ; and a few fresh facts will be found in this Gazetteer in the articles on Hillah Town, Tawairij and Nasiriyah Town.I raq (T urkish) 82? in the caravans going from Baghdad to Badrah and Mandali. A fair supply of camels, horses and mules is forthcoming in most of the drier parts of the country. At Baghdad passable riding-horses and excellent mules can be hired for a tour at the rate of one rupee per diem each ; if however the journey is of an unusual kind, or less than 10 animals are engaged, the rate may be as much as one and a half rupees. A Baghdad mule-caravan can, on flat ground, cover from 3 to 3 4 miles in the hour and as much as 40 miles in the day. It is advisable to take a written agreement when transport is engaged, even for a private journey. Tibn or chopped wheat and barley straw is the usual fodder and can be had at all seasons ; green food, called Hashish is at many places obtainable only in the early spring. In cultivated dis tricts there is generally a certain surplus of these two articles and of grain; but the supply is liable to fail in seasons when irrigation or rainfall is deficient. None of the roads of ^Iraq are made roads, but thoee described above as No?. Ill, IV and VI, to the south and south-west of Baghdad, are lit in ordinary weather for vehicular traffic. Most of the coming and going between Baghdad and Hillah, Baghdad and Karbala, and Karbala and Najaf is by stage-coach. In 1905 there were 26 coaches plying between Baghdad and Musaiyib, 12 between Musaiyib and Karbala, 9 between Karbala and Najaf, and 6 between Baghdad and Hillah : those on the Musaiyib and Karbala line go and return the same day, while the rest go one day and return the next. The coaches resemble covered waggonettes, have four wheels, and are drawn by four horses or mules: they run together in convoys and are generally spoken of as belonging to a Qumbaniyah or company, but in reality they are owned in twos and threes by private individuals. The usual fare between Baghdad and Karbala is one Majidi. A similar service exists between Baghdad and Samarrah. In all ''Iraq there is only one horse tramway, connecting the western suburb of Baghdad with Kadhimain j it is 3 miles in length and was constructed about 1870 by Midhat Pasha, at that time Wali of Baghdad. At present there is no railway in 'Iraq, but the Anatolian Railway is being extended in the direction of the Euphrates and Tigris valley. Accommodation for travellers.—kt halting-places on the main routes, as well as in most towns and large villages, Ehans cM or hostelries for travellers are generally found : on the main route to Karbala there are several at each stage. They consist of quadrangular enclosures828 'IRAQ (TUEKISH) surrounded on the inside by small rooms and stables ; in the better sort there are a few superior rooms forming a second storey; but the sanitary condition of all alike is indescribably bad. Some Khans are public, and at these the accommodation is free; but the majority are privately owned, and the Khanchi lives by the payments he receives for supplies and by the tips which satisfied travellers usually give him. Boat bridges.—Where bridges over the larger rivers exist in 'Iraq they are invariably bridges of boats. The pontoons are lightly constructed of wood and smeared with bitumen; they are secured to one another by lashings, and the whole bridge is held in position by cables made fast to the bank and by moorings in the stream; a section of several boats is generally made so as to open and fall away, when required, for the passage of steamers and large native craft. The bridge at Baghdad is passable for all vehicles; but on others the gangways connecting the boats are sometimes so narrow and badly adjusted as to be difficult fol 1 animalSj and considerable preparation would be required to fit some of thetn for wheeled traffic. Boat-bridges exist at Samarrah, Kadhimcdn, Baghdad, Qararah, Kut-al-Amarah and ' Amarah on the Tigris ; at Fallujah, Musaiyib, Hillah,Nasiriyah and Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the Euphrates; at Tawairij and Kufah on the Shatt-al- Hindi yah; and on the Diyalah just above its confluence with the Tigris. Wafer coMmunications. —The navigation of the Tigris, Euphrates, Hindiyah, Gharaf and Diyalah rivers and of the Husainiyah and Jahcllah. canals is dealt with in the articles under those names. As already observed, the principal communications of the country are by water. The Tigris is navigable to Musal, but up-stream traffic practi cally ceases at Baghdad in consequence of rapids and the increased force of the current above that point, especially at Qanatir; down-stream traffic, however, from Musal to Baghdad is carried on by raft, almost to the exclusion of other means of transport; and some of the rafts descend as far as ^Amarah Town. Regular boat carriage on the Euphrates does not now extend above Hillah Town and with difficulty reaches that point: between July and October some of the reaches between Samawah and Hillah cannot be negotiated by boats of size, which must unload at Samawah or Shinafiyah. By entering the Hindiyah through the Bahr-an-Na jaf boats from the lower Euphrates can reach the river again at the Hindiyah barrage or Saddah ^ as however the barrage has no lock,'IRAQ (TURKISH) 829 they must here transfer their cargoes to other boats which come to meet them from above. The Shatt-al-Grharaf is not passable in the low season. About Kifl and Kufah, where the roads are uns^aged and unsafe, and in the marshy districts generally, the people for the most part move about in boats or canoes. The question of steamers is [treated of elsewhere; but we may here remark that native sailiug-boats have the advantage of steamers in the carriage of articles, such as grain and liquorice, which are bulky and have to be collected from point to point, also in down-stream work generally, and in most cases where the desideratum is cheapness rather than speed. That the native carrier is willing to dispense with bagging of grain is another point in his favour. The present steamer freight from Baghdad to 'Amarall Town, for instance, is 14^, Sd, a ton, while boat freight is only 9^. 4id. Passengers by steamer from Bombay sometimes accomplish the journey to Baghdad in 14 days, and goods from Bombay arrive in from 14 days to 6 weeks, or more, with only one transhipment from ocean to river- steamer at Basrah ; goods from England are delivered at the Baghdad custom-house in periods varying from 40 days to four months and over. Native river boats *' —The chief kinds of native boat in use on the m rivers and marshes of ^Iraq are the Mahailah , Ballam Jb, Danak im &lt;^j|^ , Mashhuf vJysA' 0 or canoe, Quffah ^3 or coracle, and Kalak uAi' or raft, t The Mahailah in some up-country places called a Taradah or Safinah J uxa ** ) is found everywhere from Fao to Baghdad. It is the largest boat seen on the Mesopotamian rivers and varies in length from 30 to 80 feet with a beam slightly less than J of the total length j it is built with great sheer, giving the midship portion a freeboard of only about one foot when fully loaded, while the gunwale at bow and stern is from 10 to 12 feet above the water. The Mahailah is an open boat and is strengthened with three or four stout cross-beams; but the larger sizes have a poop, and all have a steering platform aft, as well as a forecastle deck for working the ground tackle and for poling. The stern is pointed and the lines of the vessel are extremely fine. The Mahailah is steered with an ordinary tiller and rudder and has only one mast carrying a lateen sail ; there is also a staysail which is hoisted when the wind is too heavy for the larger sail. The Mahailah floats so # Authority. —Chiefly a special report by Commander A. Rowand, R.I.M. t See illustrations in Vol. Ill of this Gazetteer. t Plurals Tararid and Sufun .830 'IRAQ (TURKISH) lightly that a mere rag of canvas will enable it, when unloaded, to advance at a fair speed even against a strong current. When wind or river are adverse the Mahailah is poled along in the shallow water close to the bank, or a long coir rope is led from the masthead to the shore by which the crew tow, one man remaining on board to steer. The crew varies from 3 to S'men according to the size of the vessel, and from 10 to 100 tons of cargo can be carried. A large Mahailah will contain 60 passengers. The cost of construction of a Mahailah is from £100 to £^50 English. The Ballam is the boat 'par excellence of the Shatt-al-' Arab and its ordinary range is from Qurnah to Fao, but it is found on the Euphrates as far up as Nasiriyah Town. The typical Ballam is a small boat about 20 feet long by 3 feet across at the greatest beam; in shape it is long and narrow and pointed at both extremities.* It has a platform for poling at either end and is strengthened by cross-beams. The Ballam draws very little water and is generally poled along the bank, but it can also be rowed or sailed : a rudder is shipped when sailing. Three or four men constitute the crew of a Ballam, and it costs from £10 to £15 English to build one. The small passenger Ballams of Basrah are gaily painted and have a scroll ornament at each end. A larger cargo-carrying vessel of the Ballam type is called an 'Aragiyah : it may be as much as 60 feet in length and carry a load of 50 tons. The home of the 'Aragiyah is on the Euphrates and Hindiyah from Samawah to Hillah^ and it is said to take its name from the river ports of this neighbourhood which are called collectively ^Arag, a word which has possibly some connection with the name ^Iraq: on the Tigris, however, the term ^Aragiyah is used somewhat loosely to describe any boat from the Euphrates. The Danak eUb has much the same distribution as the Mahailah, but it is not nearly so common, unless perhaps on the Euphrates in tlie neighbourhood of Hillah and Diwaniyah. It is an open boat, 30 to 40 feet in length, and pointed at bow and stern, with a platform at each end and cross-beams in the waist. The stem and stern-post rise 3 to 3^ feet above the gunwale in order that they may stand clear when tlie vessel is loaded up with datestalks or such produce. There is one mast carrying a lateen sail, the steeri ng-gear consists of a rudder and tiller, * This is tbe Ballam 'Asbari j it is used for passenger traffic and as a lighter, it is sometimes as much as 50 feet long ; a large one will carry 20 passengers. Thei is also a pattern called Ballam Nassari, 40 or 50 feet long, in which caigo is carne between Basrah and Kuwait. Both types are built at Kuwait, but Ballams aie no o^ned at that port.lEAQ (TUEIOSH) 5 831 and the hull, which is of wood, is coated 'with bitumen. Poling is resorted to in shallow water. The crew consists of about 5 or more men, and both cargo and passengers are carried, but the capacity o£ the Danak does not commonly exceed 12 tons. A Danak costs £15 to £20 English to build. w The mast in all the vessels described above is called Shaiyal ; the sails are Shir a/ ^; and the poles for propelling are Maradi . The Mashhuf is a light plank or reed-canoe, covered with bitu men, which is used in the marshy tracts upon the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence at Qurnah. Mashhufs are built in considerable numbers at Qal'at Sallh. and Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and the positions of these two places sufficiently indicate the country to which the Mashhuf belongs. The length of the Mashhuf is from 15 to 18 feet,* and it can be very rapidly propelled by one man, who sits as far aft and as low as possible, and strikes the water with a paddle upon either side alternately. The Mashhuf, if managed with care, will carry altogether 4 or 5 men, and occasionally a second oarsman sits in the bow. There is a species of large Mashhuf called a Qaiyariyah also bitumen-covered but built of thin planking ; it has a mast, sail, rudder and tiller, but is reckoned an inferior boat. The name is derived from Qir, meaning bitumen. U) Baghdad is the headquarters of the Qulfah &amp;&amp; , and 500 are said to belong to that place ; but it is seen as far south as Basrah and as far west as the Husainiyah canal. It is a circular coracle, shaped like an Indian water-jar, or in more precise terms a hollow oblate spheroid with the central portion of the top removed. QufOahs are ordinarily 4 to 5 feet in diameter, but some are as small as 3 feet 8 inches and others as large as 10 feet; the former may be as little as 2 feet 6 inches in depth and the latter as much as 3 feet 6 inches. In construction the Quffah is nothing else than a strong wickerwork basket thickly coated with bitumen and costing £5 or less. The ordinary Quifah is propelled by two men with paddles and will carry 4 or 5 passengers, but a very large one can convey 20 persons, or one camel and several passengers. The QuJfah does not advance well against the current; but it is very safe, being little liable to accident in case of a collision. By fishermen descending the stream a bundle of hurdles, marking the end of the net, is sometimes sent in advance of the Quffah, while the vessel itself is retarded by a heavy stone attached to a rope and dragging along the bottom of the river. The larger Mahailahs sometimes have a Quffah as dinghy. There is also a class of small boat on the Euphrates about Musaiyib 'which is called Sajah * A Mashhuf seen at Basrah, however, measured 32 feet in length, 3| feet in beam, and 1 foot and 7 inches depth.832 'IRAQ (TURKISH) The last and most primitive kind of river craft in 'Iraq are the Kalaks or rafts which come down from Musal to Baghdad and sometimes to 'Amarah Town. They consist of a square or oblong plat form, either of timber or built up with layers of crossed branches to a thickness of 1^ or 2 feet and then covered with rough planks: the usual size is 14 by 15 feet to 16 by 18 feet, but some are even 30 feet long, The buoyancy of the materials is increased by 30 to 50 inflated skins which are attached to the submerged portion of the platform; the Kalak can only move with the current and is kept in mid-stream by means of two roughly fashioned sweeps. These rafts bring with them pottery, wood, fruit, empty oil-tins, etc., which they sell on the way to villagers and Bedouins; on arrival at their destination they are broken up, the wood being sold as scantlings to house-builders and the skins conveyed up the river again to the original point of departure. The load of a Kalak varies from 5 to 30 tons. It is impossible, owing to defective registration, to obtain a clear idea of the number of boats which exist on the rivers. * At Basrah Town, in 1903-04, there were 635 mastless and 475 masted vessels upon the Government books; but the Naqib of Basrah alone then owned 200 boats, other notables among them perhaps 50, and a large number of private individuals 3 or 4 each, none of which were registered. Mash- hufs, too, are never registered. The chief seats of boat-building are Basrah. Town and Sangar on the Shatt-al -'Arab below Basrah. The times taken by native boats to ascend and descend the large rivers are extremely uncertain, varying with wind and current: thus the upward journey from Basrah to Baghdad varies between 15 and 45 days, and the downward journey from Baghdad to Basrah between 10 and 30 days, but river and wind both being favourable Basrah may even be reached from Baghdad in 5 days. Post office.—The Turks have not been remiss in establishing post offices; but the efficiency of the postal service leaves something to be desired, and, at least off the main routes, private messengers are still in request and considerable use is made of the good offices of travellers and passing muleteers. There is no system of money orders, but specie can be sent insured through the post. * Estimates of the river transport which might be obtainable at Baghdad and Basrah p.re given b^ Captain H. Smyth in his Reconnaissance Report, 1904.'IEAQ (TURKISH) 833 Telegraphs.—-The origin of the telegraphic system in 'Iraq is explained in the Appendix to this Gazetteer whieh deals with tbe subject of telegraphs. Baghdad City is the centre of the whole network. From Baghdad radiate a line which meets the Indo-European Telegraph Departments cable at Fao and affords communication between India and Europe^ another running to the Persian frontier at Khanaqin and meeting there with a line from Tehran worked by the Persian Government, and a third which reaches Constantinople via Musal and Diyarbakr. A fourth line, from Baghdad to Europe by way of Aleppo, has now been completed after being for some years under consideration. Baghdad is connected with Fao by a line through Qumah Village and Basrah Town: at Qurnah this line, a double one, crosses to the right bank of the Shatt al-' Arab which it follows thence all the way to Pao. There is a small branch office, distinct from the general office at Basrah Town, which is situated in the Maqam quarter of the same and receives messages in Arabic and Turkish only. Between Baghdad and Qurnah, on the way to Fao, there are alter native lines, one following the Tigris, the other the Euphrates valley. The stations on the Tigris line between Baghdad and Qurnah are 'iziziyah Village, Kut-al-Amarah Town, 'Ali-al-Gharbi, 'Amarah Town, QaPat Salih and 'Azair : those on the Euphrates line are Musaiyib, Hillah Town ,Diwaniyah Town, Samawah Town, Durraji, Kasiriyah Town, Suq-ash-Shuyukh and Hammar. A branch to the town of Hai leaves the Tigris line at Kut-al-Amarah j and a wire from Hillah, on the Euphrates line, runs to Tawairij, Karbala and Najaf. The Tigris line is apparently double throughout, and the Euphrates line as far as Hillah. It is the intention of the Turkish Government to prolong the Kut-al-Amarah to Hai line by way of QaFat Sikar and Shatrat-al- Muntafik to Nasiriyah Town, thus providing a cross-connection; and it is also stated that Kifl and Kufah will shortly be linked up with Karbala and Najaf, * probably by means of the wire which connects those two places. The Tigris telegraph, it should be mentioned, is on the left bank of the river from Baghdad to Qal'at Salih, and there crosses to the right bank which it follows to Qurnah. On the line from Baghdad to Khanaqin, which is single, the inter mediate stations are Ba^qubah, Shahraban and Qizil Rub at; and from Shahraban a branch, also single, is thrown off to Mandali and Badrah-. ♦ This has now been done (1907). 3 H834 'IRAQ (TURKISH) The stations in 'Iraq upon the Aleppo line, which is double, are Fallujah and Rumadiyah, The Turkish telegraphs in 'Iraq are indifferently maintained. In 1905 the line between Karbala and Najaf was interrupted, and for several months no attempt was made to restore communication. Civil administrative divisions. —Before entering on the subject of administration it is necessary to understand the system on which, in the Turkish Empire, the country is distributed and organised for purposes of government, and how in particular that system has been applied by the Porte in 'Iraq, The largest territorial unit is the Wilayat hh or Province; each Wilayat consists of divisions, known as Sanjaqs o:1, Li was ^ ; each Sanjaq again is subdivided into Qadhas ^ or districts j and each Qadha includes as a rule one or more Nahiyahs or small out lying administrative charges. Within the Nahiyah are generally found, in 'Iraq, a number—sometimes very large—of Muqata'ahs or estates; * but these have little or no administrative significance. The Muqata'ah in fact is simply a tract of land which happens to be included under one common name; it may contain a village or villages or it may be uninhabited, it may be cultivated or desert, and it may belong to one or to many owners. Wilayats are of the first or of the second class, Sanjaqs are classified in 3 grades according to their importance, and Qadhas and Nahiyahs are similarly treated j but in every Sanjaq there is a Markaz yy® or headquarters Qadha which has the same name as the larger division and has no grade, either high or low, in its own class. Baghdad is a Wilayat of the first, and Basrah apparently of the second class. In the tables which follow below of the administrative divisions of 'Iraq opportunity has been taken to insert some details elucidative of facts given in the paragraph on population above. The Baghdad Wilayat consists of 3 Sanjaqs, viz., those of Baghdad and Diwamyah, which are both of the first class, and that of Karbala * The word Muqata'ah does not originally mean an estate ; it is properly a ^ erD J? Turkish revenue or finance and denotes the farming out of a portion of the pu ic revenue for a period at a fixed rate. Such contracts being common in connec ion with the land revenue the word has now acquired, in Traq, a territorial signi ca icii alsg.840 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Xfame of Qadha, Chef-lieu of Qadha and its population iu souls.

We may mention here that the Sanjaq of Hasa or &lt;f Najd^ is divided by the Turks into the 3 Qadhas of Hofuf (Markaz), Qatar and Qatif, and they treat the Hofuf Qadha as consisting of 5 Nahiyahs, vk., Ayun ^ , Hofuf (Markaz), Jafar , Mubarraz and ' Oqair J&amp;c . but the Qatar and Qatif Qadhas are not subdivided, even nominally, into Nahiyahs. The so-called Sanjaq of Qasim consists, in the imagination of the Turkish Government, of 2 Qadhas, viz. Buraidah and Riyadh Buraidah again is composed of a Markaz Nahiyah of Buraidah and a Nahiyah of ^Anaizah ; and Riyadh is supposed to include a Markaz Nahiyah of Riyadh and two other Nahiyahs, Sadair, and Washam, The whole of ; Iraq was formerly included, along with Musal, in one enormous province known as the Pashaliq of Baghdad. In 1878, with a view to reducing this unwieldy charge, Musal and its dependencies were detached and formed into a separate Wilayat; and in June 1884 the territory remaining under the government of Baghdad was further broken up into the two Wilayats of Baghdad and Basrah which have been described above. The Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats, it may be noted, had been separated before this in 1875, but in 1880 they had been reunited^ Civil officials. — Each Wilayat is ruled by a Wali or Lieutenant- Croveraor j each Sanjaq by a Mutasarrif or Commissioner; each Qadha by &amp; Qaim-Maqan or Deputy-Commissioner; and each Nahiyah by a Mudir jJiV® or Subdivisional Officer. These charges of'IRAQ (TURKISH) 841 Varying 1 importance are sometimes described by the rank of the officers who administer them, a Sanjaq being spoken of as a Mutasarrifliq a Qadha as a Qaim-Maqamliq jUtiU j and a Nahiyah as a Mndirlik or Mudiriyah The salaries of the superior officials are determined by the grade of the territorial unit of which each holds charge, and the following are the present rates of pay attached to these ;— Charge held.

Tbe Wali is also the political representative of the Turkish Government in his own province, and all dealings with foreign consular officers or foreign subjects there, and with the uncivilised tribes of the country, are in his bands. Tbe Wali has no authority over tbe regular troops in the Wilayat, but he may call upon the military command er to take such steps as may be necessary for the attainment of adminis trative or political objects. Occasionally, as in the Wilayat of Basrah at 'the present time, the same individual is invested with the highest civil and military powers ; and such an arrangement is not unknown even in the lower grades, the chief civil authority in the Sahjaq of Nasiriyah, for instance, being now the military officer in command of the troops there (1905). Every civil official, from Wali down to Mudir, is assisted by an Administrative Council or Majbs-al-Idarah sjWI of which be is ex-ofcio president ; but the functions of these bodies are advisory only. The composition of the Council of the Wali of Baghdad may be mentioned as typical : it consists of 14 ordinary members. Of these 6 hold then - seats by virtue of office, viz., the Mufti, Qadhi and Naqib of Baghdad, the Daftardar and Maktubji of the Wilayat, and the MusW of the 6th Army Corps : the non-official members, of whom one riiust be a Christian and one a Jew, are selected by Government from short lists of names mitted by the Christian, Jewish and Mubammadan communities. The Administrative Council in a Nahiyah is called Nahiyab Idarah Majlisi „1U'° »jlol and meets four times a year. Every village or Qaryah %j&gt;-Within tbe Nahiyah is governed by a Mukbtar or headman with the assistance of an Ikbtiyar Majlisi 01 ' Council of Elders, who have the right to send np not fiiore than fofer oftten number to represent them in the Nahiyah Idarah Majlisi. The headquarter towns or villages of Sanjaqs and Qadhas are organis ed as municipalities; and the affairs of each one of them are supposed to be managed by a Majlis Baladiyah ^ ^ or Municipal Council. These Municipal Council, however, have no more real power than tbe Administrative Councils of the territorial divisions* The Turkish administration of 'Iraq would thus seem to be carefn y organised and to be based to a large extent upon representative institu tions. The case, however, is one in which but little correspondence exists between the outward appearance and the real fact. Mudirs even Qaim-Maqams are sometimes merely illiterate tribal Arabs whom'IBA Q (TURKISH) 843 it is desired to placate : such is the Qaim-Maqam of Eazazall and such was^ till recently, the Mudir of Hammar. Gendarmerie or Vhdbitlyahs. —The maintenance of law and order throughout the country districts depends, in time of peace, on a force of police known as Gendarmerie or Dhabitlyahs . the former is a new, the latter is an old name for these police, but it has been clearly ascertained that both terms refer to the same body of men. The organi sation of the Gendarmerie is military, and the force is under the control of a section of the Turkish War Office styled Jandarmah Dairahsi ^ ; but it is distributed among the Wilayats of the empire for service as a ciril police under the orders of the civil authorities, and the Gendarmerie of each Wilayat are a charge upon the civil revenues of the same. The Gendarmerie consists partly or Astarsuwars,or mounted men (literally 'mule riders ') and partly of Piyadahs or unmounted &gt; and some of the latter, styled Shabanah wear no uniform. The Gendarmerie are organised in Taburs or battalions and Buluks or companies, mounted and unmounted, the number of Buluks in a Tabur varying from 4 to 10, and of men in a Buluk from 20 to 100. Most of the Taburs consist partly of mounted and partly of unmounted Buluks. The force is commanded partly by officers seconded from the regular Turkish Army and partly by individuals holding special commis sions for the purpose * The following are the different ranks of the officers with the rates of pay atttached to each :— STatae of rank.

Of the rank and file of the Gendarmerie a majority belong to the Radif or military reserve ; and the men as a whole, though not smart in appearance, are useful and hardy. In 'Iraq many of the Dhabitiyahs are Kurds. In ordinary stations the pay of the mounted private is 180 gold piastres a month or nearly £20 English a year, of an unmounted private 80 gold piastres or about £9 English a year. The mounted men generally ride mules and both branches are armed with Martini rifles. The mounted men, in consideration of their higher pay, provide their own mounts and saddlery. In ; Iraq the Gendarmerie are employed on all sorts of miscellaneous duties besides civil police work : they assist in the realisation of revenue from the tribes, and they furnish escorts and even garrisons for posts. The commandant of^a Gendarmerie battalion seldom has many of his men under his direct command ; as a rule they are scattered up and down the country in small detachments of 3 to 50 men ; and thus it happens, for example, that at Karbala Town, which is the headquarters of a battalion, the number of Dhabitiyahs present is rarely over 100 and often falls below that number.

The annual cost of the Gendarmerie in the Wilayat of Baghdad is about £60 J 000 sterling, and of those in the Wilayat of Basrah rather less than £40,000. Civil police, Qanuns and passport system. —In the larger centres of population and in places of administrative importance in ^Iraq there exists, alongside of the Gendarmerie; a purely civil police force differently846 'IRAQ (TURKISH) constituted; where the latter are found the employment of Gendar merie is excluded, but the authority of the civil police does not extend to surrounding villages or to the open country. The civil police force consists of Police Commissioners of 3 grades and of constables; their pay is as follows :— Corresponding English rank. Monthly pay in gold piastres.

Sar-Commissaire jv+XfOyS Ikinji Commisf saite urF 1 Uchunji Commist saire S 5^ , | Polis There is a Sar-Commissaire of Police at Baghdad City and another at Basrah Town, each being the head of the civil police in his Wilayat, In Baghdad City there are, in addition to the Sar-Commissaire, ^ Commissaires of the 2nd grade, 6 of the 3rd grade, and 29 constables. The distribution of the remainder of the civil police in that Wilayat appears to be somewhat as follows : at Karbala Town a Commissaire of the 2nd grade j at each of the towns of Anah, Kadhimain, Kut'&lt;ll' Amarah, Najaf and Samarrah, 1 Commissaire of the 3rd grade and 1 constable at Ba'qubah and Khanaqin, 1 Commissaire of the Brd grade each; at Badrah 1 constable, at Mandali 1 constable and at Tawairij 3 constables. The officers of the civil police are entitled to make use of Dhabitiyahs when they require men. The annual cost of the civil police is less than £2,000 sterling in the Wilayat of Baghdad, and less'than £500 in that of Basrah. A small force of Qanuns or military police, drawn from the local troops, has recently been created to assist the civil police m garrison towns. They are specially charged with the supervision of soldiers in streets and bazars, and are distinguished by a crescent-shaped brass badge bearing the word Qanun whence their name, and by a yellow worsted aiguillette. In Baghdad City the Qanuns number 16. Before leaving the subject of civil police we may note that a system of travelling passports or Tadhakir -al-lVTarur ^ -fIRAQ (TURKISH) 847 obtains m 'Iraq but is very imperfectly enforced. Every person, whether an Ottoman subject or not, desiring to cross the boundary of the Wilayat in which he resides is supposed to provide himself with such a Tadhkirah; the necessary document is issued in the large towns by a department known as Nufus and in smaller places by the petty civil officials, Few travellers take the trouble to comply with the law and the right of examining passports is consequently a lucrative one. Justice, —The principal remaining departments for the working of which the Wali of the Wilayat is responsible will be noticed incidentally, further on, in connection with the subject of finance. Consequently we now pass on to consider those institutions and branches of the administra tion which are directly controlled from Constantinople ; and of these the courts of justice are perhaps the most important. Courts are of four kinds,—ecclesiastical, criminal, civil, and commer cial,—and we proceed t6 deal with them in this order, taking the ecclesiastical first because they are the oldest and are indigenous to the country. Ecclesiastical courts, —In 'Iraq, as elsewhere, only questions of Shara' or Quranic law are entertained by the ecclesiastical courts, and the judges are Qadhis ^ recognised and paid by Government, of whom there is one at the headquarters of each Wilayat, Sanjaq and Qadha. The scale of pay of Qadhis is personal: the present Qadhi of Baghdad draws 60 Lirahs a month. From the decision of the Qadhi of a Wilayat an appeal lies to the Shaikh-al-Islam ^ at Constanti nople only; but local appeals in 'Iraq, from the lower Qadhis to the higher, are permitted. Another set of functionaries of the Quranic law, but jurisconsults rather than judges, are the Muftis , who resolve legal difficulties and give Fatwas or decisions authorising or prohibiting acts of disputed legality, especially such as are connected with marriage. An officially re cognised Mufti is found at the chef-lieu of each Wilayat and Sanjaq, and the Qadhi of every Qadha also exercises the functions of Naib or Deputy Mufti in the same. The Mufti of Baghdad ordinarily receives to 18 Lirahs a month as pay. Criminal and civil courts, —The tribunals exercising criminal and civil jurisdiction in 'Iraq are the Bidayat Mahkamahsi ^ or Court of First Instance, one of which exists at the headquarters of every Wilayat, Sanjaq and Qadha in'Iraq; the Istinaf or High Court848 'IRAQ (TURKISH) at Baghdad, with original and appellate jurisdiction; and the Tamyiz vaJ or Supreme Court of Appeal at Constantinople, with appellate juris diction only. Each of these three tribunals has a criminal side or Jaza Qismi ^ an d a civil side or Huquq Qismi ; and in each the judges of these separate sides are two distinct sets of persons. The Bidayat as a criminal court consists of a President and either two or four members, half of the members being ordinarily Muhammadans and half non- Muhammadans ; the members are appointed for two years each, after objections to their names have been invited and considered. The President of the civil division of the Istinaf is the Qadhi of the Wilayat. The Tamyiz deals with questions of both law and fact, and its deci sions cannot be reversed except by Trade or edict of the Sultan. The language of all the courts in 'Iraq is Turkish, and the courts themselves are spoken of by their Turkish names. Criminal proceedings. —Crimes are divided in Ottoman jurisprudence into three categories, viz^ Qabahah ) Junhah and Janayah f corresponding respectively to petty, ordinary, and serious offences. In the discharge of their criminal functions the courts are assisted by a Mud^i 'Umumi ,yy- c or Public Prosecutor and his subordinates, by a Mustantiq or Examining Magistrate, and by a body called w the Haiah Ittihamlyah or Court of Testing Charges. A Public Prosecutor and an Assistant Public Prosecutor are stationed in each Wilayat, and it is their duty to collect and arrange the evidence for government prosecutions and to conduct such cases in court; an officer, known as a Mu'awin , of lower status but having the same functions, is attached to every Court of First Instance. The Examining Magistrate, who is appointed by Imperial decree and represents a depart ment styled the Istintaq Otahsi ^ &lt;^1 J is empowered to make preliminary arrests and to hold magisterial inquiries with a view to determining whether accused persons should be released or should be committed for trial by competent courts ; this he does at the request of the Public Prosecutor, to whom he is subordinate, and he cannot himself convict or pass sentence in any case. The Court of Testing Charges consists of three judges taken from the criminal side of the Court of First Instance of a JVi arkaz Sanjaq ; it meets on fixed day without being specially convoked, and its duties, as will be seen further on, are analo gous to those of an English grand jury.'IEAQ (TDEKISH) 849 Cases of Qabahah are generally sent by the Public Prosecutor direct, that is without reference to the Examining Magistrate, to the Court of First Instance of the Sanjaq or Wilayat, and may be tried and disposed of by the President and two members of that tribunal. From decisions of the Court of First Instance in such cases there is no appeal, except on a point of law to the Court of Tamylz at Constantinople. Cases of Junhah are first referred by the Public Prosecutor to the Examining Magistrate for investigation ; when the latter has submitted his report the prisoners are sent for trial to the Court of First Instance, which, as in Qabahah oases, consists of a President and two members only. In cases of the Junhah class, including such as arise in the Basrah Wilayat, an appeal lies from the finding of the Court of First Instance to the High Court at Baghdad, and thereafter to the Supreme Court of Appeal at Constantinople, Cases of Janayah are referred by the Public Prosecutor to the Examining Magistrate, and are reported on by the latter, in the same manner as eases belonging to the Junhah category; but here the similarity in procedure ends, for a person accused of Janayah is not placed on his trial until the Court of Testing Charges have examined the papers in the case and have held that a prima faeie case against him exists. The trial of cases of Janayah which arise in the Baghdad Wilayat is conducted by the Istinaf at Baghdad in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction; but in the Basrah Wilayat, where no High Court at present exists, such oases are heard by a Janayah Mahkamahsi ^ specially constituted for the purpose and composed of the President and four members of the Court of First Instance. In Janayah cases there is a direct appeal to the Tamyiz Court at Constantinople. British subjects are not exempt from the jurisdiction of the Turkish criminal courts; but, by Article 42- of the Capitulations with Turkey, no eiiminal case against a British subject may proceed except in the presence of the British Ambassador or of a British Consul. No sentence passed on a British subject is valid until concurred in by the British diplomatic or consular representative ; and, should the latter disapprove of the oider which the court proposes to pass, the matter must be settled between the British Ambassador at Constantinople and the Turkish Ministry of Justice. Civil proceedings. —The Bidayats or Courts of First Instance may tertain and decide all civil causes whatever their value or nature; and 6 0: ^ Bidayat in civil cases is subject to appeal only if 3 iSi \ 850 'IRAQ (TURKISH) the value of tlie claim exceeds 50 Lirahs. Civil appeals from the ^ Bidayat lie to a superior Bidayat, to the Istinaf or to the Tamyiz accbrd- ing to circumstances. Basrah civil cases reach the Baghdad courts by way of appeal only. Commercial courts and proceeding s .— B s M q * tlie ordinary civil courts there are in 'Iraq two Commercial Courts, one at the headquarters of the Baghdad, and the other at the headquarters of the Basrah Wilayat. ^ ] This form of tribunal, known as the Tijarat Mahkamahsi ^ ojl^ tries most mercantile suits, as well as cases relating to hills of ex change and promissory notes which are not strictly of a commercial character ; but its jurisdiction is not altogether exclusive, for commercial cases in which the value of the subject matter does not exceed 10 Lirahs I J! may, but only if all the parties are Ottoman subjects, be disposed of by ^ the ordinary civil courts. y, j The Commercial Court consists of a President appointed from Constantinople and of two nominated members, these 3 being all Muhammadans, with the addition of 2 non-Muhammadan elected members, generally a Christian and a Jew, who are appointed for one year each by their respective communities. The procedure of the Commercial Court is based upon the Code Napoleon, but it also follows | to some extent the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The President and the Members have each one vote, and the decision of the court is by a majority of votes. It is within the competence of this court to declare h j Ottoman subjects bankrupt. When all the parties to a suit are Turkish ^ o subjects there is a first appeal from the Commercial Court to the Istinaf ^ ^ j y tiller n [lite M, Cist iffilBadr itoali, at Baghdad and a second to the Tamyiz at Constantinople. Certain differences in procedure are involved if a foreign subject is a party to a case in the Commercial Court. In such circumstances one or two assessors are added to the ordinary members of the court, these being of the same nationality'—if it can be arranged ■s-s the foreig interested; the proceedings are watched by a representative of t e foreigner^ consulate, and an appeal lies not to the superior civil cou1 ^ but to the Tijaratin Birinji Majlisi ^ or CommerC ^ Court at Constantinople, of which the decision is final. A jadgmen creditor who is a Turkish subject can only, it should be 0 ^ rve ' obtain a declaration of the bankruptcy of a foreign debtor and e appointment of a receiver and trustee, by application to the fomg 1 ^ 1 ' ^ consulate through the local Turkish authorities. It may be ac ^ e ^ ^ in matters of succession and bankruptcy the Porte allows its Nlent : N| 'A H 5 i•IRAQ (TURKISH) 851 l! ^4 submit to the jurisdiction of the consular court of the deceased or the bankrupt, Imperial Departments,—^^ Imperial Departments, which have branches in 'Iraq but of which the working* is not subject to the control 'yeivil^ of the local Walis, may be divided into 2 classes, viz., those of which the larboft; whole raison d'etre is to produce revenue and those which are intended to serve the public convenience. To the former of these classes belong- the WrV ; Customs, Public Debt, Tobacco Monopoly, and Land Record Depart- 1 of j, ments ; the second includes Posts and Telegraphs and the Departments of i comiE Public Health, Religious Endowments and Public Instruction, Woit i Id li; Depai tmeut of Customs. The Imperial Customs department, known as ispodd Gumruk is charged with the collection of the duties payable at the frontier, both sea and land, of ^Iraq. The highest local Customs official pitf k * S a or Director-General, who is stationed at Baghdad, deals direct with Constantinople and has under his orders two executive officers called Mudirs one of whom is quartered at Baghdad and the other at Basrah. Customs officials of a lower rank, called Mamurs are k ill in the direction of the Persian frontier at Khanaqin, Qizil Rubat, alsofc Mandali and Badrah ; on the Shatt-al-'Arab at Nashwah and Qurnah.; fce P* 0n tlie ® u P^ ra t es at Suq-ash-Shuyukh ; and on the Tigris at QaPat ^ Salih, 'Amarah, Kut-al-Amarah, Suwairah and Kadhimain. urttoi The general rate in 'Iraq of AmadTyah (also called Idkha- iarefrf liyah ) or import duty is 8 per cent., * and that of the Raftiyah ( also called IkhrajTyah ) or export duty is 1 per cent, ad valorem ; but there is no customs duty on salt as it is already l Jjjct'; a Government monopoly. On imported goods re-exported within six j^ e8 |i months a refund of 7 per cent, is allowed; in other words, goods in , transit are placed on the same footing as original exports. Extra customs tliefif duties have recently been imposed by means of 2 kinds of stamps, required tafo ^ a ffi xe( l to documents presented at the Customs House, which entail in some cases an addition of nearly 50 per cent, to the customs duty r Co# Proper : one of these duties has no special object, but the proceeds of the ^ jjif other are professedly devoted to the construction of the railway from S ^ na Hijaz. Tlie Customs receipts in the Baghdad and btor ^ Basral1 Wilayats amounted in a recent year to £149,514 sterling, and the 0# ex penses of the department to £14,6] 4. ^ * From the l^fch of July 1907 it was raised to 3L1 percent. pr • 312852 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Department of Fullic —The Duyun-aVUmumiyali ^ or Department of Public Debt^ which is subject to international control and exists in the Ottoman dominions chiefly for the benefit of European bondholders, is represented in 'Iraq by a Nadhir at Baghdad, under whom are 5 Mudirs, posted respectively at Ba'qubah, Basrah, Hillah ; Kut -al-Amarah and Samarrah, besides Mamurs of inferior rank or agents at 'Amarall, ^Anah, Umm-al -Ba'rur (or rather Hamidiyah), Diwamyall; Hai; Hit, Kadhimain^ Khanaqin, Abul Khasib, Mandali, Musaiyib, Najaf, Nasiriyali, Qizil Rubat, Qurnali, Samawah, Shatrat-al- Muntafik, Suq-ash-Shuyukli and Tawairij, not to mention 'Oqair Port and the town of Qatlf which are in the Hasa Sanjaq. The ui N adhir has also at his disposal a Mufattish or travelling inspector. The principal sources of revenue which have been made over to this department for management are fisheries, liquor, salt, silk, and stamps, and it may be regarded as an Excise Department. The distilleries at Qararah and elsewhere are under its control, and the proceeds of the salt tax and of licenses for the vend of liquor go into its treasury. The annual receipts of the Public Debt Department in the Wilayats of Baghdad and Basrah amounted recently to £39,849 sterling, and its expenditure to £16,645. The Tobacco The Tobacco Monopoly, generally known as lc the Regie Cointeressee des Tabaes deJ^Empire Ottoman,' is a joint stock company holding a monopoly for the manufacture and sale of tobacco m the Turkish Empire : it is represented at Baghdad by a Nadhir. There is also an office at Basrah., and Mudirs, Mamurs or other subordinate officials of the Company are stationed at 'Amarall, Badrah, Ba'qubah, Hillah., Karbala, Khanaqin, Kut-al-Amarah, Mandali, Najaf, Samarrah, Samawah. and Tawairij and are under the orders of the Nadhir ; their principal duties are to supervise the cultivation of tobacco and to collect the taxes payable thereon at the various depots of the Department. There is also, as a rule, a travelling inspector of the Regie with headquarters at Baghdad. The tax on tobacco cultivation recovered by the Regie is at the rate of 7*8 gold piastres per kilogramme on the best homegrown tobaccos such as Shaur and Quzi and of 3*9 gold piastres on inferior sorts like Khurdah . Persian tobacco, which is largely imported for smoking in nargiles, pays an import duty of 2 gold piastres per kilogramme as customs to the Turkish Government and 1 piastre as'IRAQ (TURKISH) 853 droit de monopole ' to the R egie. The Tobacco Monopoly is virtually a branch of the Public Debt Department and it is not to be confounded with the Societe du 1 ombacj an Ottoman company which holds an exclusiv© concession for the importation of Persian tobacco into Turkey. In ''Iraq the Qadhas most important to the Regie are those of Hillah, Hindiyah) Karbala and Naj at but its rights are more restricted in this province than in other parts of Turkey. Department of Land Records, —In order to understand the work ot the Daftar Khaqani or, as we may call it, the Land Records Department, it is necessary first to explain the classification of land according to ownership which prevails in 'Iraq as in other parts of the Turkish Empire. There are 5 principal kinds of landed property. The first kind is Mulk tsi-U or freehold property, over which the owner has full power in life and in death. It may be transmitted by inheritance or by legacy, and only in event of failure of heirs does it escheat to the Bait-al-Mal or Treasury. Mulk is of 4 sorts, but on this minuter classification it is unnecessary to enter. Mulk, in 'Iraq, consists chiefly of land in the neighbourhood of villages which has been purchased by the villagers from Government. The second sort of land is Miri or that which belongs to the state; it comprises arable lands, pastures, and forests, and the ownership thereof is vested in the Bait-al- M al. Lands of the third kind are Waqf ; those, namely, of which the profits are assigned for religious purposes. Waqf lands that are under the management of the Department of Religious Endowments, to which We shall refer in another paragraph, are ipso facto free of taxation ; while those in the hands of private individuals are taxed to the same extent as similar lands which are not Waqf. The large landed properties owned by or vested in the Naqib of Baghdad, however, have been specially exempted from taxation by an Imperial edict and may therefore be regarded as Waqf in the public sense. Matmkah lands, or such as are not individual property and are left unoccupied for the public benefit, compose the fourth class. The fifth category consists of Mawat ofy* ; or Dead Lands, which have remained uninhabited and uncultivated from time immemorial. The lands owned by the Sultan of Turkey as an individual and manag ed on his behalf by the D^irat-al-Saniyah or Civil List Department, of8 54 'IBAQ (TURKISH) which we shall have something to say further on, may now almost be taken as constituting a sixth variety of land. These lands are known as Aradhi Saniyah J tlie y ar e private domains, and they must not be confounded with Aradhi Miriyah ; or lands of the second kind, which are public or state domains. The Daftar Khaqani and its functions in regard to these various kinds of land and land tenure now fall to be considered. The Daftar, which in 'Iraq seems to be represented only by a Mamur at Baghdad, is divided into two sections, the Tapu and the Amlak The duty of the Tapu is (1) to register all facts connected with the ownership of land in general and (2) to manage the Aradhi Miriyah or public domains on behalf of the stable. The bnife of the Aradhi Miriyah is in the possession of cultivators who have rights of occupancy, and these rights are obtained by payment of a price or sum in consideration of which a Sanad ^ or title deed is conferred on the tenant by the Tapu. w »» At the death of a tenant under the Tapu, or Mustahiqq Tapu ^ as he is called, his rights of occupancy pass to his heirs j but, on the other hand, a tenant of Miri land who leaves it uncultivated during three years forfeits thereby his occupancy rights. The disposal of government lands to occupancy tenants and, where that is impossible, the farming of them to Arab tribes upon produce rents are, together with the registration of all transactions in and arrangements relating to land, the work of the Tapu* The Amlak section resembles the Tapu in that it registers transfers^ but these are only of house property. Both Tapu and Amlak levy a registration fee, which in the case of the Amlak is usually at the rate of about J per cent, ad valorem ; and the receipts of both sections are remitted to Constantinople after deduct ing the local working expenses. The net revenue of the Department appears to have been £4,816 in the Baghdad Wilayat in 1903, and £1,060 in the Basrah Wilayat in 1901. The Tapu was established in ^Iraq in 1889 only, and the Amla^ even more recently. Department of Posts and Telegraphs. —The postal and telegraphie services of 'Iraq have already been described under the heading of commu nications, and it only remains hei:e to mention the organisation of the department which is responsible for the working of both. The chief official of the department in 3 Iraq is a Director or Bash Mndir ^'IRAQ (TURKISH) 855 at Baghdad, under whom are two executive Mudirs—one for Posts, the other for Telegraphs—and an Inspector most of whose time is given to the work of the Telegraph section. The receipts of the Department in 'Iraq in a recent year were apparently £18,097 sterling, and the working expenses £15,097. Department of PuUic Health. —The sanitary department, which is chiefly occupied with quarantine, is controlled by a doctor of medicine at Baghdad, known as the Mufattish or Inspector, who receives his orders direct from the international Board of Health at Constantinople. Informa tion in regard to the working of this department in 'Iraq will be found in the Appendix to this Gazetteer which deals with epidemics and sanitary organisation in the Persian Gulf. One of the principal subor dinates of the Inspector is a doctor with three assistants at Khanaqm, whose duty it is to inspect corpses entering the country from Persia for interment at the holy places of the Shfahs ; and there are establishments for the maintenance of sea quarantine at Fao and Basrah Town, the station at Basrah being located on ''Ajairawiyah Island. After these the sanitary posts at Najaf and Karbala, where most of the Shi'ah burials take place, are the most important. Mamurs of the department are stationed also at •'Amarah on the Tigris; at Haji Qarah (in the Khanaqm Qadha), Mandali and Badrah near the Persian frontier; and at Samarrah, Kadhimain, and Musaiyib, places visited by the Persian pilgrims or through which Shi'ah pilgrims and corpses pass. There is also a sanitary post at Qatlf Town in Hasa. Not long ago the receipts of the Department of Public Health in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats for one year amounted to £6,830 sterling and the expenditure to £3,819. The accounts of the department are kept by a Muhasibji or Accountant at Baghdad. Department of Religious Endowments. —The chief local official of the Religious Endowments or Auqaf Department in ^ Iraq is merely a Muhasibji or Accountant at Baghdad; but much important work is performed by the department in superintending the finances of the great Shi'ah shrines. The Auqaf is able to hold its own with the local executive government in ''Iraq and has successfully obstructed, up to the present time i a scheme for the extension of the congested town of Najaf. The income of the Auqaf Department in ^Iraq in a financial year not long past was £7,981 sterling, and its expenditure in the same year £3,042.856 IRAQ (TURKISH) Department of Tublic Instruction. —The Educational Department or Ma'arif maintains a primary school or Maktab Rusbdi in which Turkish and Arabic are taught at the chef-lieu of every Sanjaq and Qadha. In addition to these there are a Maktab Tdadi Mulkr or secondary civil school for boys and an Inath Maktab llashdisi ^ cjG ) or primary school for girls at Baghdad and at Basrah. ; all of these are government institutions managed by the Department and in them no fees are charged. The secondary boys^ school at Baghdad was founded in 1890 and the number of pupils is about 250, most of whom eventually enter the public service or proceed to study law or medicine at Constantinople. The primary girls^ school at Baghdad was opened in 1898. Besides the above there are a Maktab Rashdisi ; Askari LfJ^ ^ c_?^) or primary military school and a Maktab Tdadi Askari or secondary military school at Baghdad; and Baghdad and Basrah each possesses a Maktab San^iyah Dr industrial school. The military schools are free. The Dairat-as-Samyah maintains primary schools on some of the rural estates which are under its management. Besides the schools of the Education Department there are many schools, both Muhammadan and non-Muhammadan, in ■'Iraq, especially at the larger centres of population. Thus at Karbala the Sunnis have one, and the Shi'ahs a number, of religious high schools or Madrasahs ; and, as the unmarried students mostly live in the school building, these may be described as boarding schools. At Baghdad the Jewish, Chaldsean, Syrian, and Armenian communities, consisting of Ottoman subjects, each maintain a good school of their own. Schools in ^ Iraq kept by non-Turkish subjects are noticed under the head of British and other foreign interests below. Finance and taxation. —Below are two tables of annual revenue and expenditure in the Wilayats of ; Iraq ; in (he first table the provinces aie treated separately, in the second they are combined.

The tent and hut tax, generally known as Baitiyah or Buyutiyali is a tax collected, where collection is feasible, by the Turkish Government from its agricultural Arab subjects^ both fixed and semi fixed. It is levied at the rate of 50 gold piastres per annum on every house or hut, but it is a tax on households rather than on dwellings; for a house inhabited by two married couples is reckoned as two dwellings and one containing only unmarried members of a family which already pays Baitiyah is exempt. Widows and helpless persons are excused from this tax. Along with the Baitiyah proper of 50 gold piastres per house is recovered an annual cess of gold piastres ; this is described as a contribution towards educational and military expenditure, The various taxes on domestic animals are all included under the common term of Koda lay ; they fall (or ought to fall) largely on the nomad tribes, and consequently nothing like realisation in full can be effected. The Shaikhs of the Bedouin tribes ordinarily wring from the tribesmen under them as much as they can on their own behoof; but in matters of Turkish taxation, on the contrary, they screen and protect them to the best of their ability. Koda is paid at two different rates, vi&amp;.j at half a Majidi per annum for each camel, horse, mule, cow, buffalo, pig or monkey {sic) and at 12 Raij piastres per annum for each sheep, goat or donkey.'IRAQ (TURKISH) The agricultural taxes—generally described, whatever their incidence may be ; as ; Ushr jte or tithes—are the most valuable source of revenue and also the most difficult to understand, Mulk lands are assessed at T V to 4 of gross produce, the former rate being applicable to all holdings which are irrigated by means of water-lifts and to Daim lands in the autumn harvest, and the latter to Daim lands in the spring harvest ; some Chaltiq lands, however, of the Mulk class, pay as much as Jrd of gross produce. The revenue, or rather rent, charged by the Government for the use of Miri lands is a matter of arrangement between the Tapu and the tenant, but it ranges ordinarily from T \&gt;th of gross produce on lands unfavourably situated to -i-th on lands which are easily irrigated or highly cultivated; in exceptional circumstances, however, it may amount to Jrd or even to The lessees of Miri lands are frequently tribal Shaikhs who either give security for the rent or pay part of it in advance ; and the leases granted them are commonly for one year only, but may be for two or even for three. In table No. I above, a fixed tithes ' are understood to represent agricultural revenue farmed out, ' revenue tithes ^ the same collected direct, and ' security deposits the advances or guarantees furnished by lessees of Miri lands. There is an annual tax of 7 Eaij piastres on every date palm, and one of 2 to 4 Haij piastres on every orange tree ; honey also is taxed at the rate of y^th of its market value. Agricultural revenue of all kinds is collected at the time of harvest. Landed property may be held in Turkey by foreign governments) foreign religious bodies, etc,, as Mulk or Waqf ; and when this is the case a yearly tax, described at Muqata'ah is paid as compensation to the Ottoman Government for the tithes, right of escheat, etc., thus lost to it* The official forests from which, as Table No. I above shows, a small revenue is derived are for the most part plantations by the banks of the large rivers : they consist chiefly of Euphrates poplar and of tamarisk, and the timber is usually very small Such forests exist at or near Suwairah, 'Aziziyali and 'Amarah Town upon the Tigris, and also at several other places which are indicated in the article on that river* The royalty on minerals extracted in ; Iraq varies between 5 and 15 per cent, ad valorem. Miscellaneous taxes, somewhat exceptional in their character and of which the proceeds are not shown in the tables above, are Turabiyah and Shahriyah , Turabiyah consists of burial dues860 'IRAQ (TURKISH) realised by the Turkish Government on account of Shi'ah interments at Najaf, Karbala and Kadhimain : it varies from 31| to 5,000 gold piastres per corpse according to the sacredness of the place of burial* The Shahriyah is a punitive tax, from which British subjects are exempt, collected at Karbala only; it was imposed by the Porte about 40 years ago in consequence of resistance offered by the inhabitants to conscription for military service, and it is payable by traders at a rate varying from |th to | Majidi monthly. No harbour dues are charged by the Turkish authorities at Basrall Town, who in this case appear to have overlooked their opportunity. Municipal taxation does not enter into the provincial budgets given above, but a few remarks on the subject will not be out of place here* An octroi or Ihtisab liability to which of British subjects is not admitted, is levied at the rate of 7 per cent, on local products entering an inland town where there is no customs house; but articles imported from abroad, which have already paid customs duty, are exempt from this charge. Examples of other municipal or partially municipal taxes follow : they are taken from Baghdad City, where all of them are in force. An 8 per cent, duty is levied on Sha'ri thread worked up into Aghabani cloth: the thread, at the time of being imported, had already paid customs duty at the rate of 8 * per cent. A tax called Tamgha of which the amount varies with the article, is taken on all cloth and woollen goods manufactured or embroidered locally ; the farm of this tax in Baghdad City produces about £900 sterling a year. There is also the Pasbaniyah , a tax collected monthly and graduated according to incomes, of which the object is to provide for municipal scavenging and lighting and for watch and ward. Other taxes to which the citizen of Baghdad is liable are the Asnaflyah a trade tax of |th to J a Majidi on each trader annually, and a tax ranging from to 45 Raij piastres per head on the slaughter of animals for food. The majority of the preceding are purely municipal taxes, but the pro ceeds of the Asnafiyah and slaughter tax go partly into the funds of the municipality and partly into the general revenues of the province. Taxes on fish, firewood, Quffahs and boats also are paid in Baghdad City; but these are provincial, except the tax on fish, which is taken by the Depart ment of Public Debt, and none of them are municipal. W hen any tax is paid a receipt is given ; and to the receipt must now be affixed, in ^Iraq, not only an ordinary receipt stamp of Jth gold piastre but also a Hijaz Railway stamp of 1 gold piastre, • Now 11 per cent. (1907 V'IRAQ (TURKISH) 861 Miraf-as-Sanii/ah.—B&amp;toTte leaving tte subject of the civil and general administration it will be advisable to notice, in some detail an official agency which in 'Iraq possesses great economic and political importance : this in the Dairat-Qomisyon-as-Sanlyah iil-JI ) generally known as the Dairat-as-Saniyah. The Dairat-as-Saniyah is a section of the Khazmah-i-Khassah-i-Shahanah iiUU lini or Ottoman Civil. List Department, by which the large private properties of the Sultan of Turkey are administered. It is presided over, in 'Iraq, by a Central Committee at Baghdad, which corresponds direct with the Minister of the Civil List at Constantinople ; and in the part of the Turkish Empire with which we are concerned it consists of two principal branches, one dealing with lands and irrigation and the other with navigation. We shall now examine separately the assets and methods of each of these branches, and at the same time we shall mention some facts relating to the local staff, income and policy of the department. The private domains of the Sultan, administered on his behalf by the Dairat-as-SanJyah, are known as Aradhi Sanlyah and it is stated that they now amount, in the Baghdad Wilayat, to about ?0 per cent, of the whole cultivable area as against 80 per cent, owned by the state, 20 per cent, belonging to private individuals, and 20 per cent, which is unclassed. In the Basrah Wilayat also considerable areas, in cluding some of the finest wheat, riee, and date-growing tracts, are under the management of the department. The Saniyah lands in 'Iraq may be conveniently divided into 4 groups depending for irrigation on the Tigris, the Shatt-al -Gharaf, the Euphrates and the Shatt-al -'Arab respectively; but, in addition to these lands on the main rivers, there are Saniyah properties on the Mahrut canal in the valley of the Diyalah, and even on the 'Aliyawah SjUU canal close to the Persian frontier at Khanaqin. The Dairat-as-Saniyah has also charge of agricultural and other properties in Hasa which are referred to in the article on that Sanjaq. On the Tigris the Dairat-as-Saniyah has acquired the Dujail canal, which takes out on the right bank of the river above Baghdad, and holds' possession of the estates, irrigated from the same, of Dujail, Balad jOj and Sumaikah in the Samarrah Qadha and of Tarmiyah in the Qadha of Kadhimain. Below Baghdad, between 'Aziziyah Village and Kut-al-Amarah Town, the valuable estate of Shadi in the Qadha of 'Aziziyah is controlled by the Dairat-as-Saniyah, and Saniyah lands extend along the right bank of the river from Tawil to Umm-al-'Ajaj'IRAQ (TURKISH) and along the left bank from Summar or Samr to Imam Mahdi; these last are said to reach, on either side of the river, from 20 to 30 miles inland; and in the right bank block is situated the rising village of Bghailah which is altogether under the department. The right bank of the Tigris from the point where the Shatt-al -Grharaf leaves it to Shaikh Sa'ad, together with the country behind it to a depth of perhaps 40 miles, is under the Dairat-as-Saniyah. The Tigris properties down to shaikh Sa'ad are all situated in the Wilayat of Baghdad. From Kumait to the Bitairah canal Saniyah lands occupy the right bank and extend inland some 30 miles ; and further down the lands about Daffas, opposite to 'Amarali Town, also those of Majar-al-Kabir and Majar-as- Saghir, and others on the right bank in the neighbourhood of Qal'at Salih are included in the Sultan's private domains. On the left bank the Saniyah properties are believed to extend almost continuously from 'Amarall Town to a point opposite 'Azair, while inland in the same neighbourhood they reach almost to the Hawizeh marshes, including in particular the tracts of Akhdhar, Bahathah, Jahalah, Misharrah and Shatt which are in the 'Amarah Qadha and a large portion of the Qadha of Zubair. All the estates mentioned above from Kumait downwards are in the Wilayat of Basrah. The Dairat -as-Saniyah also holds a quantity of land in the Muntafik Sanjaq, probably irrigated by the Shatt-al -Gharaf. The Saniyah estates watered by the Euphrates are numerous, and most of them are named from the canals on which they depend; the cultivators as a rule, inhabit temporary and not permanent villages. Above and below Musaiyib are properties of which the centres are Abu Ghuraib, Mahmudiyah and Sikandariyah, the first probably including the lands managed by the Department at Khidhar Aliyas, and others irrigated by the Latifiyah, Musaiyib and Nasriyah canals from the Euphrates. In the neighbourhood of Hillah Town are Saniyah lands watered by the Nil and Wardiyah canals, and in the Khawas Nahiyah of the Hillah Qadha are domains known as Abu Gharq, Umm -al-Hawa, llaj, Yusufiyah, and Abu 'Arais. The Hamidiyah canal which brings drinking water to Najaf Town is a Saniyah property ; so also is a large tract of country known as Mushkhab which has its headquarters at Abu Sikhair and includes the prosperous village of Ja^arah; Abu Sikhair and Ja'arah are both in the Shamiyah Qadha. On the Shatt-al -'Arab 1,500 acres of valuable land, chiefly at Da'aiji village, at Saniyah (I) and at Saniyah (II) in the Dawasir District are said to be in the possession of the department.i •IRAQ (TURKISH) ti«i The methods of the Dairat-as-Saoiyah in agrieulture are energetic. 3(1 '4 Its custom is to acquire the most easily worked canals and to push each one that comes into its possession as far as it will g-o, never irrigating- ^ riglt the same land a second time until the canal has attained its maximum ^it length. A survey is carried on concurrently with the expansion of lepttl irrigation, but the undeveloped portions of each estate are left for the » 1/ time being unsurveyed; it follows that, although the limits are marked i h out on the ground with boundary pillars, the total areas in its charge are generally as yet unknown even to the department. The lands to be fct ( irrigated during the year are leased out to cultivators on a rent of two- fifths, or, if the seed is supplied by the Dairat-as-Samyah, of seven- tenths of the produce ; and money advances are sometimes given to the cultivators and recovered in the harvest. The landed property under usljfi management of the Dairat-as-Saniyah has mostly been obtained on tksi extremely favourable terms, for, when—as often happens—-Aradhi kiig ii Miriyah or state domains are disposed of by auction, no one ventures to ml Mi bid against the representatives of His Majesty the Sultan, 'fft The branch of the Dairat-as-Saniyah which is concerned with land lilit and irrigation engages in miscellaneous enterprises also. It has con structed a number of handsome dwelling-houses at ''Ainarali Town, Ml which bring in good rents ; and it has recently undertaken the collection of tolls at the Kharr Bridge near Baghdad, a right which was formerly leased to a contractor for about 2,100 Lirahs or £1.900 sterling a year. ,] The navigation branch of the Dairat-as-Saniyah, known as the Hamidiyah Navigation Office, came into existence with the purchase by the department, in March 1904, of the whole stock and nnckfe aSSets U ^ 0n Shatt-al -'Arab and Tigris rivers of a former J Oman- jndif Ottoman' branch of the Turkish Ministry of Marine. The principal ffoi I items then transferred to the Dairat-as-Saniyah and the valuations at ■ w they changed hands were as below :— ^4(1 t £ Turkish. £ English.

In 1905 the Hamidiyah office added two new Glasgow-built steamers to its fleet and was arranging to obtain 2 new barges: the vessels in its possession at the end of that year were:— (1) Eiver steamer Baghdadi ' , age 44 years, speed 6 knots, carrying capacity=100 passengers. (2) Eiver steamer ' Furat' , age 38 years, tonnage 125, horse power 200, speed 5 knots an hour, carrying capacity=400 passengers, 4 horseg and 70 tons of cargo. (3) River steamer ' Rusafah ' , similar in all respects to the ' Furat.' (4) River steamer ' Mtisal ' , age over 30 years, speed 7 knots an hour, carrying capacity = 600 passengers, 8 horses and 100 tons of oargo. (5) Eiver steamer ' Hamidiyah ' , 'ew, tonnage 430, horse power 700, good cabins and electric light. The contract speed of this steamer was 12 knots and the carrying capacity should have been 900 passengers, 10 horses and 230 tons of cargo ; but capacity is deficient an J the maximum speed is 9 knots an hour only. (6) River steamer ' Burhaniyah ' j similar in all respects to the Hami diyah ', except that she has attained a speed of 10^ knots an hour. Besides the above there were 3 barges, each about 40 years old. The Hamidiyah office competes closely with the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for the Tigris carrying trade, and it is stated that its agents sometimes appeal to the loyalty or reli gious feelings of native merchants and passengers in order to obtain their patronage. Turkish troops on mobilisation or relief and Turkish government stores are carried by the Hamidiyah steamers at commer cial rates; and in the Hamidiyah workshop at Basrah, where castings of as much as 5 cwt. can be executed, engineering and mechanical work of all sorts is undertaken for private employers. The highest local authority in Saniyah matters in 'Iraq is a Central Committee at Baghdad ; but the principal place of business is now at 'Amarah Town, whither it was transferred from Basrah, about 1899. Both at 'Amarall and at Basrah there is a Committee subor dinate to the Central Committee at Baghdad : that at 'Amarah consists of a President, a Mudir and 3 members. The general staff of the depart ment in 'Iraq is considered to be small in proportion to the amount o business transacted, but the members are well paid. The Central Com mittee at Baghdad includes a Bais or President wit a'IRAQ (TURKISH) 865 salary of £T. 55 a months a Mudir or Director on £T. 40 a month, and a Kashf-.Vludir or Chief Surveyor, besides several merchants who receive small monthly honoraria for their services. A feature of the Dairat-as-Saniyah administration is the number of military officers on the active list whose services are utilised, a special allowance being given them by the depart ment in addition to their military pay; thus the Kashf-Mudir at Bagh dad is a military Colonel receiving £T. 17| monthly from the department, and not long ago the Mushir of the 6th Army Corps himself held a well paid appointment under the Dairat-as-Saniyah. The object of this arrangement is possibly to secure a supply of military labour for the work of the Dairat-as-Saniyah; for some use is made of such labour, yet no thing is paid to the rank and file employed. No complete account is available of the executive staff of the Dairat- as-Saniyah in 'Iraq, but it comprises at least the following: — Group, Estates. Staff, Bekaber. Tigris properties. Dujail, Balad, Su- maikah and Tar- miyah. Wakil or Agent at Duiail, and a Mainur or Manager each at the other places. Do. On both sides of the Tigris above and below Bghai- lah.

There is also a Wakjl, In addition to these local agents the Dairat-as-Saniyah has in Iraq a field-engineer and an assistant field-engineer. The former is a military Lieutenant-Colonel, but receives a salary of £180 sterling a year. His assistant is a military Adjutant-Major. The Saniyah officials in Hasa are mentioned in the article on that Sanjaq. The estate managers o£ the Dairat-as-Saniyah have no criminal or civil jurisdiction. The petty employes who work under them ; called Shabanah are generally Arabs and do not wear uniform. The Director, at Basrah, of the Hamidiyah Navigation Office has lately been endeavouring to free himself of the control of the Central Committee at Baghdad and to obtain the right of dealing direct with the Ministry of the Civil List at Constantinople: the pay of this Director is^ hardly inferior to that of the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's manager at the same place. The Hami- diyah steamers are undermanned, but the hands employed on them receive pay only about 10 per cent, lower than is given on the British boats. The two new Hamidiyah steamers both carry British engineers, and one of them is commanded by a British Captain; the Basrah work shop also was in charge, in 1905, of a British marine engineer, and the number of hands was at that time sufficient; service in the workshop is pensionable.* The annual income of the Dairat-as-Saniyah in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats was said to amount in 1905, according to the books i The employes are now all Turkish snbjeots (1907). K 2868 f mAQ (TURKISH) of the department itself, to £94,500 sterling; and its expenses, chiefly salaries and repairs of canals, to £27,900 sterling; bnt the operations of the department are perpetually extending and its turnover is increasing very rapid!v. Some of the estates are particularly profitable, for instance that of Abu Ghuraib, of which the income is said to be about £T. 8,000 and the expenses only £T. 800 per annum. The annual gross returns of lands on the Tigris below 'Amarah. Town were said to be £36,000 sterling in 1905, the net annual profits of the Shatt-al -'Arab properties being in the same year about £9,000 sterling. It is stated on good authority that the annual revenue of the Dairat-as-Saniyah from agricultural estates is already about double of what has been spent in acquiring them. The policy of the Dairat-as-Saniyah in 'Iraq is one of enlightened self- interest ; its relations with its tenants are generally good, and it appears to aim at increasing its business by giving satisfaction to those who make use of its steamer service. On some of its estates it has opened free primary schools, and one-third of the revenue which it realises from the tolls on the Kharr Bridge is assigned to a hospital for the poor at Baghdad. The Dairat-as-Saniyah is performing a useful function in opening up the country, and on the Tigris the villages of Bghailah and Kumait have heen brought into existence, and the town of 'Amarah. has been greatly increased, by the development of the surround ing tracts under Saniyah auspices. The superior management of the department is not entirely Muhammadan ; it is believed to include some able Armenians, and the Inspector of highest rank visiting 'Iraq is a Jew. There is sometimes friction between the local representatives of the department and the ordinary civil officials, and victory does not always remain with the latter. In economic and commercial questions pertaining to 'Iraq the actual achievements and the future ambitions of the Dairat- as-Saniyah are important factors which foreign governments and con cessionaires must take into account. Military resources.* —The army of the Turkish Empire being a symmetrically organised whole, no account of the military resources of the P^rte in ' Iraq can be given without first describing the general system of which they form a part. A regular form of army service and a military organisation were instituted in Turkey in 1843. Improvements were introduced after the * Author ities.~Qo\on&lt;A F. R. MaunselPs Eandhooh of the Turkish Army ^ reports by Colonel L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident at Baghdad, and Mr? Crow&gt; Consul at Basrah,'I raq (T urkish) 869 Russian wars of 1854 and 1878 ; and in 1886 the actual system, which is territorial and follows European continental models, was established on the recommendation of Colonel Von der Goltz, an officer of the German General Staff whose services had been specially lent to the Ottoman War Office. The Turkish army throughout the Empire is recruited by conscription, but only from the Muslim elements of the population; and the field of supply is further narrowed by local and other partial exemptions which affect even Musulmans. Turkish subjects professing other faiths than Islam are excluded, ipso facto, from the Turkish military service and pay instead a service commutation tax or Badal ' Askariyah Jjj of 40 gold piastres, or about 7 shillings English, per annum. In the classes subject to conscription liability to service commences from the 1st of March following the 19th birthday and continues for 20 years ; the soldier passes successively through the N idham or regular active army, in which he spends 3 years with the colours ; through the Ihtiyat WaLJ or reserve of the Nidham, the period of service in which is 6 years; through the Radif or reserve army, in which he remains for 9 years; and finally through the Mustahfidh or territorial (defensive) force, in which he performs the last 2 years of his service. This, in theory, is the system; but in practice the soldier is often kept for 6 years or longer with the colours and then passes directly into the Radif without serving in the Ihtiyat; it follows that the Ihtiyat cannot be depended on to reinforce the regular army, and the same may be said of the Mustafidh, which has no battalion organisation and could only be used for filling up deficiencies in the Radif. Apart from mobilisation for war, the Radif are liable to be embodied by Imperial Irade for the maintenance of order, for the suppression of riots or insurrection, and for the augmenta tion of any garrison that may stand in need of it; they are also supposed to be called up for a months ordinary training once in every two years. Recruits, in , Iraq, are taken only from among the townspeople, villagers, and settled or semi-settled tribes ; the nomadic tribes neither serve nor pay any tax in lieu of service, and this exemption has had a marked effect in preventing the settlement on the land of certain Bedouins who would otherwise ere now have taken to agriculture. Another pernicious exemption in 'Iraq is one in favour of students of theology; it unduly swells the ranks of a useless class, and in the Sanjaq of Karbala, where it is easy to become a student without going far from home, the Turks obtain very few recruits. In 'Iraq the inhabitants of the town of Zubair enjoy a special exemption from conscription.870 'IRAQ (TURKISH) Turkey, European and Asiatic, is divided altogether into 7 Ordus or military districts, to each of whicli a Qol Ordu Jy or army corps is assigned. The district and army corps with which we are concerned are those numbered VI; the district is co-extensive with the civil Wilayats of Baghdad, Basrah and Musal, and Baghdad City is the military as it is the civil headquarters of the whole region. The oth Army Corps is commanded by a Mushir or Field Marshal who is directly under the Minister of War at Constantinople and occasionally holds, in addition to his military appointment, the civil governorship of the Baghdad Wilayat. The troops in the Ordu are Nidham and Radif, and the local organisation of these we may now examine separately, The Nidham of the 6th Ordu consists of two divisions of infantry, each commanded by a Fariq or Lieutenant-General; of a cavalry division, also commanded by a Fariq; and of a regiment of artillery, commanded by a Colonel or Mir Alai . It also comprises 2 companies of engineers (1 of pioneers and 1 of telegraph), 4 artificer companies (1 of tailors, 1 of shoemakers, 1 of clothworkers and 1 of tanners), and 1 battalion of train [viz., supply and transport). The Nidham infantry of the 6th Ordu is organised as follows by divisions and brigades :— Number of division and divisional headquarters. Number of brigade and'Jjrigade headquarters. llth, Baghdad .... r2l8tj Baghdad^ (.22nd, Hillah* C 23rd, Itirkuk. 12tb, Kirknk ..... 124th, Musal. Each Nidham infantry brigade consists of two regiments, each regiment of four battalions j and to each infantry division is attached a single Nishanji or rifle battalion bearing the same number as the division, The arm of the Nidham is, in 'Iraq, the Martini rifled The table below * A large proportion have now received Mausers: the rest have still Martinis (1907).872 'IRAQ (TURKISH) sent to Najd proceeded on a peace footing, perhaps because the addi tional men were not available in the Ihtiyat.

Kirkuk .... 470 The peace strength of a cavalry regiment in the Turkish army is properly 697^ and it would consequently seem that those of the 6th Ordu are at present under strength. The weapons of the cavalry are Martini rifles and swords. The artillery regiment belonging to the Nidham of the 6th Ordu'IRAQ (TURKISH) consists of 5 battalions and is composed as follows, the battery being of 6 guns:— 1st battalion . . . , . .3 horse batteries. ^nd do. 3rd do. 4th do. 5th do. . 4 field do. . 4 do. do. . 4 do. do. . 5 mountain do. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and perhaps the 1st battalion of artillery are stationed at Baghdad^ with the exception of 1 field battery detached to Basrah; and, of the 5 mountain batteries, 2 seem to be at Baghdad and 1 in Hasa or Qatar. The remainder have not been clearly traced and are probably distributed over the military stations of the Ordu. Some antiquated field guns and old pattern mountain guns are found with artillery detachments in charge of them, at various places, such as the towns of 'Amarah^ Diwamyah^ Karbala^ Nasiriyah, Samawah, Shatrat-al-Muntafik and Tawairij. In April 1905 it was understood that 4 ' large ' and 4 (&lt; small ^ guns had proceeded to Najd with 100 artillery men (rank and file) ; and it was reported that the total number of artillery men belonging to the Ordu was 2,035, while guns of all kinds numbered 137. The modern guns of the 6th Army Corps are Krupps with a calibre of 7*5 cm. in the horse and mountain batteries and of 87 cm. in the field batteries. The strength of the combatant part of the 6th Army Corps (rank and file only) is thus approximately :— Infantry Cavalry Artillery . 15,578 . ^7^0 . 2,035 T otal . 20,333 and of these about half of the infantry and cavalry and a larger propor tion of the artillery are localised in the Wilayats of Baghdad and Basrah. The account of the distribution of the Nidham given above would have been more valuable had it related to a period of complete peace and not to a time when half a division were serving in Central Arabia, and Iraq, from which most of the units had been taken, was largely denuded874; 'IRAQ (TURKISH) of troops. There are usually infantry battalions or considerable detachments at 'Amarah, Ba'qubah, Hai, Hillah^ Karbala, Samawali, Shatrat-al-Muntafik and Tawairij; but these, v in 1905, had probably been replaced by Radif. No account need be taken of a number of small detachments which are furnished by the larger stations and are scattered about the country at places such as Kufah, Kumait; Umm Qasr, Qurnah, Safwan and Zubair Town. The towns of Baghdad, Basrah and Hillah are the principal military centres ; and at each of these there is an important magazine and a military hospital. Medical arrangements are almost entirely on the regimental system; and transport, except the single train battalion which is only sufficient for peace requirements, is simply hired or impressed when required. At Baghdad there is an ^Abakhanah Or Army Clothing Factory which supplies clothing for the whole of the 6th Ordu: connected with it are a military tannery and shoemakers' shops which cure local buffalo hides and turn out army boots and leather equipment. A rmy Flour Mills, in which the grain for the troops is ground, exist at Baghdad. We now come to the Radif which is, or should be, an important part of the Turkish military organisation, for it consists of mature men between 29 and 38 years of age who have served for 9 years in the standing army and its active reserve. In the 6th Army Corps the Radif is composed entirely of infantry, but it is fed by the cavalry as well as by the infantry of the Nidham. The table below explains the organisation of the Radif of the 6th Army Corps whose connection is with ; Iraq; the remainder, consisting of an equal number of units localised in the Musal Wilayat, is consti A tuted on exactly similar lines.

The Radif are armed with Martini rifles ; their clothing and equipment are usually very deficient. It is believed that the Radif battalions of the 6th Army Corps have not, when mobilised, more than about 600 men each; and the total strength of the Radif in this Ordu therefore probably does not exceed 27,000 men (54 battalions), considerably less than half of whom are in 'Iraq,8?6 IRAQ (TURKISH) At eacli centre to wMch a battalion is allotted a cadre or permanent staff of about 35 officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Radif is maintained, or supposed to be maintained, and an arms, ammunition and clothing depot has been formed. The permanent officers of the Radif are apparently responsible for the training and for the appearance, when called out, of the reservists living in their neighbourhoods, and they are also utilised to superintend conscription for the army generally. Each regiment of the Nidham obtains its recruits from the centres assigned to the Radif brigade of the corresponding number • thus the 41st Nidham regiment is supplied with recruits from Baghdad, Mu'adhdham, Ba^qubah, Daltawa, Mandali and Khanaqin which are in the territorial district of the 41st Radif Brigade. The district under each Radif centre is divided into company subdistricts for purposes of conscription and superintendence of reserves. More than half the men of the 6th Army Corps, both Nidham and Radif, are Arabs, the remainder being mostly Kurds ; and the composition of the commissioned ranks is believed to be similar. The officers of the Nidham are, as a rule, incompetent; those of the Radif are worse. As a class the officers are ill-educated ; and they are at all times surrounded by an atmosphere of dishonesty and corruption. The resources of the 6th Ordu were taxed to the uttermost in 1904 and 1905 by the Turkish operations in Najd. The original Central Arabian field force marched from SamaWah on the Euphrates at the beginning of May 1904 between 1,500 and 2,000 strong : by the end of September 1904, in consequence of severe losses in action, it had practically ceased to exist; The formation of a second expeditionary force was then commenced and was completed about the end of January 1905, when 3,000 to 3,500 men were encamped at Najaf under the personal command of the Mushir of the Army Corps. In all about 5,000 Nidham troops, nearly all of whom were infantry, were withdrawn from the Ordu; and, as all but a few were taken from the 11th Division, the number of Nidham infantry remaining in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats was reduced to about 3,000 rifles. The place of the absent Nidham battalions was taken by the Radif s, who were called out, partly in the Musal division, to the number of about 2,000 men; but these bore little resemblance to soldiers, and no efforts apparently were made to improve their efficiency by training during the period of their embodiment. The concentration at Najaf in the winter of 190^-05 dis closed corruption and a serious want of discipline in the Nidham. It was stated at Baghdad at the time that some of the battalions lost as much as 20 per cent, of their strength by desertion before reaching Najaf'IRAQ (TURKISH) 877 and that the Mushir himself was conniving at the desertion of private soldiers in consideration of small bribes. Officers * of the Turkish Army receive, besides their pay, rations in kind (Ma^shah ) or a ration compensation allowance (Ta^inat oUa * j ) in lieu thereof. Their pay is frequently much in arrears, and they are often paid in orders (Sanad ^ ) on the local treasuries which are cashed by bankers or shops at a heavy discount only. The pay of the ordinary soldier is treated as if it were a luxury rather than a necessity; in fact the men frequently see no pay until the end of their service, and then receive it in Sanads which can only be used for payment of taxes. The Turkish soldier, as a rule, is well fed. Military expenditure in the Baghdad Wilayat amounted in a recent year (apparently 1903) to £108,085 sterling, and in the Basrah Wilayat (apparently in 1901) to £98,875 sterling. In the same Wilayats, in the same years, the proceeds of the military service commutation tax were £5 ,216 and £436 sterling respectively. There are no fortifications in 'Iraq, except a small fort at Fao which was built 20 years ago and is still unarmed; and, if there were any permanent works, the 6th Army Corps is entirely destitute of fortress artillery by which they could be defended. Naval resources and river conservancy. —The Turkish naval establish ment in 'Iraq consists of a Commodore at Basrah, having two vessels under his command, and a shore establishment which fluctuates between 100 and 250 of all ranks. The principal duties of the establishment are to police the river and to look after stores and materials. The larger vessel is the ' Kilid-al-Bahr ^ a screw corvette with a comple^ ment of about 80 officers and men j she carries Krupp guns of the ^ The following are the rates of annual pay (in sterling) of the commissioned ranks Mushir (Field Marshal) Fariq (Lieutenant-General) . £1,584 £634 £420 £210 £132 £105 £63 £42 £32 £26 Liwa (Major-General) .

The other is the paddle-steamer ' Alus' carrying about 20 officers and men and a small gun mounted forward; she is used for patrolling the river. The post of Commodore was still in 1905 occupied by a Crimean veteran. The only officers of any education under the Commodore are two in the ' Kilid ' and one in the Alus ' who are from Constantinople: the men on board are recruited from coast districts of the Turkish Empire. The naval expenditure of the Basrah Wilayat, apparently in 1901, was £8,087 sterling. We may mention here, although their duties are of a civil nature, the harbour-masters who are stationed at a number of places on the rivers of ^Iraq. The principal functions of the Rais-al-Liman are to collect tonnage dues on native craft, to control bridges, to supervise river embankments and generally to attend to river conservancy. Officials of this service are found at Qurnah, Basrah, Abul Khasib and Fao on the Shatt-al -'Arab ; at Baghdad, Kut-al-Amarah and 'Amarah on the Tigris ; at Musaiyib, Hillah, Samawah, Nasiriyah, Suq- -ash-Shuyukli and Madmah on the Euphrates ; and at Tawairij, Kufah and Shinafiyah on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah. One harbour-master is in charge of Hai and Shatrat-al-Muntafik, both on the Shatt-al- Gharaf ; and it is proposed to appoint one to Diwaniyah on the Euphrates. British and other foreign interests and political representation.— British interests predominate in ^Iraq over those of every other European country : they may be divided into two classes, viz., those which concern principally His Majesty^s Government, and those with which the Government of India have more particularly to do. British interests of the former class are mainly commercial, compris ing an export—chiefly direct—of local and Persian products to the United Kingdom ; an import—also chiefly direct—of goods manu factured in Great Britain ; ocean shipping ; and the general business of local British firms having no connection with India, the number of which at the present time is 7. Among British commercial interests must be mentioned also those of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company, which holds a concession for its operations from the Turkish Government and has no relations with India or the Indian Govern ment except such as arise from a contract for the carriage of the mails of * When she was examined in 1904 'by a British marine engineer in the service of the Dairat-as-Samyah it was found that a hand-hammer could be driven through hef plates above the waterline with the greatest ease,'IRAQ (TURKISH) 879 the British Indian Post Office and for other contingent services between Basrall and Baghdad. The history of this company^ concession will be found elsewhere : here it is sufficient to mention that they have hitherto been, and still are, restricted by the Porte to the use of two steamers,* but that a lighter at present (1906) accompanies each with the consent of the Turkish Government: by this means each boat is enabled to convey 400 tons of cargo in the High, and 280 in the low season of the river, the greater part in the former case being carried upon the lighter. Besides their offices at Basrah and Baghdad the company own repairing yards at Baghdad and Kut-al-Farangi, a coal dep6t and a wool-press at ; Amarah, and a coal depot at Kut-al-'Amarah. The number of European British subjects in ; Iraq at the present time is 49,, viz., in the Baghdad, and 27 in the Basrah Wilayat. British Indian interests in 'Iraq are also largely commercial; but except shipping they are chiefly indirect, for the number of Indian traders actually settled in the country is small. There are 4 Indian firms in ; Iraq, of which 3 do a good business at Baghdad while the fourth, engaged in general trade, is established at Basrah. Probably the most important Indian interests are those, of a different character, which arise from the pilgrimage of British Indian subjects and protected persons to the Shi'ah shrines and from the occasional settle ment of such persons in the country. The pilgrims arrive in hundreds, indeed in thousands, from India and adjoining countries every cold season; two special caravansarais for their use exist at Basrah ; and during the time of the influx, that is from October to March, the good offices of the British political representatives are in constant request on their behalf. Asiatics entitled to British protection and resident in ^Iraq are mostly Shi'ah Muhammadans who have first been attracted by the shrines of Najaf and Karbala and in the end have made their stay permanent for religious reasons or because they liked the country, or the descendants of such; in a few cases the settlers are men of means, but as a rule they are poor and they often maintain themselves by petty trade, chiefly as druggists and dealers in spices. These British Indian subjects, as they may be loosely termed for the sake of shortness, are mostly found at Karbala ; on that side of 'Iraq, if the towns of Najaf, Hillah, Tawairij and Musaiyib (at each of which there are a few) be included, their number is about 1,500 souls, men, women and children of # Since the spring of 1907 a third steamer with barge has been permitted, but she does not carry mails and must fly the Turkish flag while under steam.880 'IRAQ (TURKISH) whom it is estimated that about 900 are Indians other than Panjabis, 250 are Panjabis from the Lahore, Sialkot and other districts, 200 are Kashmiris, * 100 are Afghans and 50 are Tibetans. At BagMad and KadMmain there are about 1,200 Muhammadan British subjects who are nearly all Indians; and at Basrah, there are a few of the same class and one or two Hindus. Of these Asiatics, approaching 3,000 in number and entitled to British protection in 'Iraq, only a small proportion are actually registered in the British Consular books; but the remainder, on production of proof and payment of a fine for neglect to register their names, can obtain recognition at any time. Except in the case of Indians, British Cons alar protection is not ordinarily continued to the children or descendants, born in the country, of the proteges mentioned above. Nowhere do the Indians form, as might have been expected, a compact community having their social and commercial intercourse chiefly with one another ; on the contrary they generally marry Persian and Arab wives and rapidly assimilate themselves to their surroundings, maintaining their status as British subjects only for the sake of the privileges, particularly exemption from military service, which it confers. Great Britain is represented in 'Iraq by a Political Resident and Consul-General at Baghdad, who is a member of the Indian Political Department; by a Consul of the Levant Service at Basrah ; and by a native Vice-Consul at Karbala. A Residency Surgeon of the Indian Medical Service is attached to the Baghdad Residency; also, since 1906, an Assistant to the Resident for Trade and Commerce. The Residency building is one of the finest modern edifices in Baghdad. The Govern ment of India maintain extra-territorial post offices at Baghdad and Basrah, the mails between the two being carried, as already mentioned, by a British line of river steamers. Russia is the only European power besides Great Britain which possesses a Consulate-General in 'Iraq; it is located at Baghdad. A Russian Vice-Consulate,t also, exists at Baghdad ; and there is a Russian Consulate at Basrah. Russian subjects number about 50 at Kadhiinain and 30 at Karbala, but they are all Persian speaking and of Persian race. The actual material interests of Russia in 'Iraq are small, and Russian trade is represented only by agencies of the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company at Basrah and Baghdad. * The inhabitants of the Kashmir Valley proper are Sunnis, but in some of the borderlands, and at places in the Gilgit Agency, Shi'ahs are found. t Now abolished (1907).'IRAQ (TURKISH) 881 Belgium, France^ Germany, Spain and Sweden are each represented at Baghdad bj a Consul; so also are the United States of America, who have besides a Consular Agent at Basrah. Each o£ these countries has a modeiate commercial interest m ^Irjic|, Grreek interests are at present protected by the British Consul-General at Baghdad and the British Consul at Basrah; those of Italy are in the hands of the British Consul at Basrah ; those of Austria are watched by the French Consul at Baghdad. The French representative, in virtue of the claim of l* ranee to protect Roman Catholics everywhere in the Turkish Empire,* is charged with the interests of a Carmelite founda. tion and school at Baghdad as well as of the Latin Church and the affiliated Syrian and Catholic-Armenian churches there; the Latin church and school at Basrah also are under French protection. An Ameiican Presbyterian mission, dispensary and school exist at Basrah. The interests of Germany in 'Iraq, apart from a moderate share in the trade and a leading part in the investigation of the antiquities of the country, are prospective only : their extent and nature will be determined by the basis on which the projected extension of the (German) Anatolian Railway to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf may be carried out. Persia is the Asiatic power which has the greatest stake in 'Iraq; her interests there depend chiefly on the multitudes of Persians who make pilgrimages to the holy places of the Shi'ahs and on the large numbers of Persians who have settled at these, but also on the many retail traders of Persian race and nationality who carry on their business in the towns and villages. The Persian Consular representatives in the country are numerous and, with the exception of those at Baghdad and Basrah who are described as Consuls-General, are graded either as Karpardaz or Naib-Karpardaz ; both these terms are loosely applied and the^ first may signify either a Consul or a Vice-Consul, the second a Vice-Consul or a Consular Agent. The following is a table of the Persian Consular representatives; except the two Consuls-General, in Iraq :— Paid Karpardaz at— Unpaid Karpardaz at— Paid Naib-Karpardaz at— Unpaid Naib-Karpard5z at— Karbala.

An important town of 'Oman Proper in the Sultanate of 'Oman ;it _ 5' situated on both sides of Wadi Halfain about 12 miles below its head tr and at an elevation of 2,150 feet above the sea. The quarter situated on iff ZIKI the right bank is walled and contains a compact and massive fort with walls 5 foot'thick, standing upon a cliff 200 feet high above the Wadi bed: to quarter is called Yaman ^ , has about 350 houses and is inhabited by the Bani Rnwahah, Daramikah and Manadharah tribes. The quartet on the left bank stands on low ground and is occupied by Bani Riy am : it is called Nizar jly and has about 450 houses. These opposite quarters are constantly at feud, the one being Hinawi and the other Ghafin in politics. The entire population of Izki proper may be about 4^00 souls: the people are cnltivators and carriers. The bed of Wadi Halfain at Izki is broad and contains extensive palm-groves and other cultivation, especially on the left bank which is low and fertile : the general aspec of the town is highly picturesque. Crops are wheat, barley, mil e lucerne, beans, sesame and sugarcane, the date palms are estimated at 10 000. Irrigation is from springs which are among the most copious in'Oman. Outside Izki are several small hamlets and watch-towers of the Yal'Umair and other tribes, among them Zikait a sma quadrangular walled village containing 15 houses of the Bam Uiyam, which is situated further down Wadi Halfain and about 1 mile sou ■ east of Izki. The possession of the Izki fort, commanding as it does the main or Wadi Samail route between the coast and the interior, is of vital importance to the Sultan of 'Oman.

On the north it is shut in and overlapped by the easternmost hills of Hajar; on the south it is enclosed by sandv desert. Ffyskal ctaracf eristics.—There is a hill called Jabal Qahwan c!,«5 belonging to this district which is situated 20 miles inland from the coast a little north of Lashkharah : its height is 3,600 feet and it is probably a southern spur of the Jabal Khamis range of Hajar. Hdls called Jabal Mashaikh are said to occur near the west end of the district. Around Humaidha, Kamil and Wafi, streams afford abundant irrigation and the country is well cultivated. Between these villages and Balad Bani Bu Hasan is an extensive plain, covered with acacia and consisting alternately of very loose drift-sand and of whitish, indurated clay. From Balad Bani Bu J Ali to Lashkharah the ground is at first level and firm with a few acacias, then broken and sandy. For 25 or SO miles south-south-west of Balad Bani Bu 'All there-is an open waste without trees or water, then a narrow ridge of low calcareous hills, then mounds thickly interspersed with gum Arabic trees-: these sandy mounds con tinue for several hours' journey. To the west of the last-mentioned tract are and plains without trees or bushes, displaying alternately a pebbly surface and saline incrustations.

The Bam Jabir boast their descent from the tribe of Dhubyan, famous in Arab poetry ; and are at bitter enmity with the Bani Euwahall who are derived from the rival tribe of Abs. Hilam'and Tau are equally regarded as capitals of the tribe; but the Bani Jabir^ though dispersed^ keep up communication with one another and act as a body.

The upper part of this valley^ above Jailali ; is properly called Wadi Sakhnan, (js-ojj .JADGAL TKIBE 891 Sometimes pronounced Yabrin. A remarkable oasis ; said to lie five caravan days to the east of Aflaj and eight to the south-west of Dohah in Qatar : one of the nearest well known points to it upon the coast is Khor^al-^Odaid. Jabrin is 150 to 160 miles south-south-west of Hofuf and about 180 miles south-west by west from the foot of Khor-aVOdaid. On the western side of Jabrin the country consists of barren clay plains traversed by the route from Afiaj ; on the other three the oasis is surrounded by sandy desert. The districts or tracts sur rounding Jabrin are Dah^nah on the north and west, Ahqaf on the south and Jafurah on the east. Jabrin is about 10 miles in length from north to south and 7 or 8 in breadth from east to west. It is a plain ; lower in level than the surrounding country and watered by springs and streams; the drainage goes to the eastern desert in which it is swallowed up. There is good grass ; and over the whole surface of the plain wild date palms are scattered in patches. Jabrinis frequented by the A1 Morrah Bedouins who collect the dates in the season ; it is said that it was once permanently inhabited and that coins and other relics of civilisation are still found there : its abandonment is attributed to a change of climate by which it became malarious. The nearest village in Aflaj is Saihj, and there is an intermediate halting-place at Mishash^ two days from Saih and three from Jabrin ; where Dawasir Bedouins encamp in the midst of clay plains. The wells on routes leading to it from Hofuf and the Persian Gulf are specified in the article on Jafurah. No European has as yet visited Jabrin. In 'Oman the name is Arabicised and becomes Zidjal JADGAL which is treated as a plural with the singular Zidjali The Jadgals are a tribe of Persian Makran, now reckoned Baluchis but said TRIBE to have come originally from Sind ; they are numerous in 'Oniail also, where they have been introduced at various times as mercenary soldiers in the employment of the Sultans. In Persian Makran the Jadgals have their headquarters in the Dashtyari and Bahu districts, where the ruling chiefs are of their number; in 'Oman they occupy an entire suburban quarter of Masqat Town, and are found also at Matrah, and generally throughout the country wherever a Baluchi colony exists. In religion the Jadgals are Sunnis.892 JAFtJEAH JAFTTRAH* A great desert in Eastern Arabia; it extends the whole way from x ^■ asa Oasis to the confines of Trucial^ Omail; and its eastern edge * is nowhere very far inland from the coast of the Persian Gnlf. By some Arabs Jafurah is regarded as a projection in the direction of Qatar of the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert of Southern Arabia ; and those who view the matter in this light say that Jafurah ends, and that the Ruba^- al-Khali proper begins, in the region known as Ahqaf oILJ or the Sand Dunes. Whether or not it be a part of the Ruba^-al-Khali; Jafurah is in itself a remarkable and very extensive desert. In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and ; 0(][air Port, and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. Along its western side Jafurah is met in succession from north to south by the tracts of Biyadh, Kharmah, Ghuwar, Na 'alah, Summan and Dahanah ; on the east it is separated from the sea, in the same order, by Barr-al-Qarah, Qatar, 'Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Rub a'-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east, and that, in the opinion of some, Barr-al-Qarah is a portion of J afurah and not a separate tract. Physical characteristics and inhabit ant s.^Z&amp;iw£2h. differs from the waterless Ruba^al-Khali only in possessing a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burn ing sand. The 1 Aj man venture into the northern extremity of J afurah; but the only tribe who frequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy Al Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies. The Al Morrah are said to wear when in Jafurah a specially thick foot-gear made of camels'-hair; and, if popular rumour may be trusted, those of the tribe who spend most time there are of an unusually swarthy complexion, while their camels are nearly jet black. While sojourning in Jafurah the Al Morrah. as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same; if compelled to swallow water from the * Nearly the whole of the iaformation contained in this article was supplied by Captain F.

The Wahhabis have frequently waged war upon the A1 Morrah; but Faisal alone ; if local tradition is to be believed^ succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the desert march that he was compelled; on his arrival there., to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.

Besides the above there are two wells, Umm-as-Swaijah and Dhibi , which are unplaced but are probably inland of 'Aqal, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of Qalaib or 'Aqalat Rakan. It should be observed that the wells of Hardh, Baqash, 'Ariq and Hidbah are stages on the second part of the route from Hofuf to Jabrin, either 'Awaisah and Shajah or Khuwainah and Zarnuqah in Kharmah being points on the first half of it., Similarly the wells of Banaiyan, Umm-al-Jira, Blr Fadhil and Bir ^Aziz form a chain connecting the Jabrin oasis with the desert highway between 'Oman and Hasa in the vicinity of Sabakhat Matti. The name is generally pronounced Chahalah and should perhaps be JAHALAH spelt iV . This large canal, by Europeans called 'the Hadd,' waters part of the 'Amarah and Zubair Qadhas in Turkish' Iraq ; it takes out of the Tigris on its left bank at the northern end of 'Amarah Town, and, circling round the east side of the place, is spanned at the back of it by shoit pontoon bridge. The Jahalah was made less than a century ago bit, forming a straight continuation of the Tigris at a point where there is a bend in its natural course, it has been enlarged by the action of the896 jah A lah river and is now about 80 yards wide at its mouth and abstracts, along with the Bitairah canal on the opposite bank a few miles further up, nearly half of the whole water of the river. The J ahalah runs inland to the Hawizeh marshes in wHd 1 it eventually loses itself; but it is understood to pursue a well-defined course, more or less parallel to the p Tigris, as far south as QaFat Salih. Tor some two-thirds of this ^ distance, to a village called Masa^idah in the Zubair Qadha, it has a depth of about five feet at low water and the channel though narrow is clear ; to this point it might be navigated by a small river steamer, but the passage beyond, if there is one, is obstructed by reeds. Much of the land in the neighbourhood of the J ahalah is owned by Dairat-as- Saniyah. JAHRAH Sometimes pronounced Jaharah. A considerable village in the Kuwait Principality, situated near the foot of Kuwait Bay, about 2 miles inland, 40 feet above sea level, and distant 20 miles by road from Kuwait Town : it is the chief and almost the only seat of agriculture in Kuwait territory. Situation. —Jahrah stands in an open plain of sand sprinkled with camel grazing, 3 J miles to the south-east of the gap in the Zor hills through which caravans from Kuwait to Basrah pass: the desert rises gradually from the village towards the west and south-west. One mile to the north of the village is a plain called Maraitabah on which Bedouins camp in the hot weather : it is riddled with wells containing water at a depth of 12 feet. The few trees about J ahrah, except the dates belonging to the village, are either tamarisks orbers. The air of the place is dry and the climate healthy. Defences. —Jahrah is commanded at artillery ranges by the Zor hills, and, owing to the shoal water at the foot of Kuwait Bay, the place could not be effectively supported by naval fire. The only defensive work is a fortified residence of the Shaikh of Kuwait on the south-east side of the village outside the limits of cultivation. In form it is ap proximately a square, having the angles to the cardinal points and sides of about 200 feet in length ; the height of the walls is 15 feet, and there is a tower 20 feet high at each corner enfilading the wall; the only entrance, commanded from within by an old muzzle-loading gun, is m the north-west face. The enclosure contains stabling for about 100JAHRAH 897 horses. The fort is in bad repair, and its chief uses appear to Ibe as the residence of a Mutair wife of the Shaikh and as a place for keeping his brood mares and young stock. a new date plantation and garden, the property of the Shaikh, stand in front of the entrance at a few yards distance; they are about J3 acres in extent and are enclosed by walls, There is no well in the fort. Population. —The permanent inhabitants of Jahrah are mostly culti vators of Najdi extraction, who till the lands possessed here by the Shaikh and various merchants of Kuwait and by relations of the Naqib of Basrah. The houses, 86 in number, are built of clay and accommo date about 100 families or 500 souls. In the hot weather the population is increased by about 700 households, mostly of the Mutair tribe, who pitch their tents near the village; and even in winter there are generally one or two Bedouin encampments within sight. Agriculture.—As the importance of Jahrah is chie% agricultural, and as most of the cultivation in the Shaikh's dominions is concen trated here, we proceed to give a full account of the place in thi^ aspect. There is no 6xed scale for the division of produce between land owner and tenant. The staple crops are wheat, barley and lucerne, the amount of barley being about double that of wheat ; the total yield of wheat in a good year is about 120 maunds only. The wheat, called Hintah or Hubb, is sown at the beginning of September and is reaped along with the barley or Shamir at the beginning of March. A part of the cereal crops is cut green for fodder as in India, and is called Qasil ; the barley is twice cut for this purpose before it is allowed to mature ; but the young wheat is seldom so treated except in unusually good years. The lucerne, called Qatt, is of excellent quality and is cultivated on the same ground for four years, after which the plot is left Hailah or fallow for one year. Other crops are the musk melon or Batikh and the water melon or Raqi which are sown once a year, ripen about the beginning of ovembei, and continue in season for three weeks ; the quantity grown is too small to admit of export to Kuwait Town. The pumpkin or aia comes in at the beginning of December, lasts for three months, d is exported to Kuwait Town. Beans or Bajilla [i.e., Baqilla) ripen ebiuaiy^ hut the crop is small and only sufficient for village ^uirements. The onion or Basal is ready at the end of December 3 ¥898 JAHRAH and continues till spring ; the radish, called Arwaid, begins early in the year and outlasts the onion, The leek or Baqal is sown afresh every year • it is cropped like lucerne and yields 16 crops in the season. Clover or Halbah and cress or Eashad are small and short-lived crops ; these herbs are only used for seasoning. The brinjal or Bahdiyan, bindi orBamiyah, and the tomato—which has no Arabic name—come early in the year and do not last long^ but are exported to Kuwait Town. There are about 2.,000 date-trees at Jahrah producing about 500 maunds of dates per annum ; practically the whole of the fruit is eaten as Ratab, that is, in the yellow or semi-ripe state. Date plan tations, now number eleven, of which the best belongs to Saiyid Khalaf, a relation of the Naqib of Basrah r three new date groves are being laid out this year (1904). At present only about 30 tons of grain are exported yearly to Kuwait Town, but the agriculture of Jahrah might be greatly extended if more capital were sunk in it. Irrigation, —The crops enumerated above are mostly irrigated and are grown in enclosures formed by clay walls about 9 feet high ; most of these gardens are on the south side of the village. Some of the wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone, but the area of such cultivation is small compared with the rest. The water for irrigation is brackish ; it is raised in skins by donkeys which pull by walking down an inclined plane that slopes away from the well. There are 19 large wells with an average depth of about 20 feet. A waterlift is called an Arjiyah, and the channels which carry the water from the well head to the crops are Saqiyah. Sometimes the water raised is collected in a reservoir or Birkah to give it a good flow : natural or artificial hollows where water collects are known as Khabrahs. A Sharb is a small embanked terrace on which irrigation water is allowed to spread before being let go to a lower level. Agricultural —Late-sown crops are described as Musaiyaf, The chief varieties of soil are Harrah, or good arable land ; Daim, which is land either situated on the edge of a Khabrah or watered only by rain ; Hazam, or stony ground ; and Sabakhah, which is swampy, saline and non productive. The commonest instruments of agriculture are a rudimentary plough, called Ifdan ; an iron spade, called Fakhin, used in making, repaii- ing, opening and closing water channels; and a wooden rake or hoe, called Masah, for levelling the ground. The Makhyul is a bogey made of an ' Aba hung on a staff to prevent sheep and goats from straying; or toJAHRAH 899 scare binjs from growing crops. An economical substitute for a wall to protect crops against animals is a Khadad'or ditch, 2 feet deep and 2 feet broad, with sand walls on either side about 1 foot high. Livestock, water supply, etc. —The supply of fowls, eggs and milk at Jahrah is limited, and wood is very scarce, but there are plenty of sheep and goats and a few cattle. Luceme and some vegetables are procurable. •The local transport available consists of some 30 or 40 donkey4 but camels can be hired from the Bedouins. Drinking water of fair quality is yielded by certain wells about half a mile south-west of the village Mmtnisf, ration and political importan Shaikh of Kuwait is represented at Jahrah by one Amir 'Abdul Karim, a native of the village but of Najdi parentage, who exercises considerable undefined powers in the place. This man is also the Shaikh's agent for the cultivation of his garden, already mentioned, and takes half -the profits of the same while the Shaikh bears all the expenses. No revenue is collected on behalf of the Shaikh. In former times the dis orderly conduct of the Bedouins frequently caused annoyance at Jahrah ; hut under the strong rule of Mubarak this drawback has been removed. ' ■ The Shaikh of Kuwait regards Jahrah as one of the most important spots in his territory, not only on account of its agaicultural resources, but also because of the prestige which its possessor enjoys among the Bedouins frequenting its vicinity and of the hold which it gives him over them. Topography of the neighbourhood. Several places and landmarks which bear names and do not belong to any of the recognised divisions o the Kuwait Shaikhdom may conveniently be described here on account of their proximity to Jahrali. They are^ in alphabetical order, as follow Position. Atraf 8 miles west-south- west of Jahrah. Some broken mounds. These form the western extremity of the Zor hills.

At a point on the ridge 4 miles north of the Jahrah• Eiqa'i route is a triple summit known as Inhaidain which forms a good landmark. Small camps of Mutair may be found in winter under the shelter of Saddah. JAMMAH ^ town of tlie Western Hajar or possibly of the Batinah district in the 'Oman Sultanate, situated 1 or 3 miles to the east of Widi Fara' some distance outside the hills and opposite to Hazam it consists of about 500 houses of the Bani Harras tribe and is surrounded by a wall. The date plantations are large and are said to contain 80,000 trees. Livestock are 100 camels, 300 donkeys, 500 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. The fort, which is on a hill, belongs to the Sultan of Oman; but he keeps no Wali or garrison here as the place is loyal to him. The nearest garrison is at Mizahit above J ammah in Wadi Fara . JAN A'AT Singular Jana'i A tribe who claim connection with the vpLclia. Sa-htll of Najd; in religion they are Sunni Muhammadans of the Ma iJANJlBEH 901 school. The Jana at were formerly somewhat numerous in Bahrain, but the majority have migrated to Kuwait Town where they now number about 150 souls. In Bahrain only 2 or 3 families, who are shopkeepers, now remain at Manamah. An idea prevails in some quarters that the Jana'at were once Sabians ; this the Jana at would explain away hy suggesting that a fresh complexion and robust physique common to themselves and the Sabians of the north have led to confusion between the two. A small sandy islet about 10 feet tiigli, ^ a mile long and very narrow. JAN AH It is situated 10 miles east by north of Abu 'All island off the coast of . the Hasa Sanjaq, to which it may be taken as belonging. * • A general term including several of the districts of the Kuwait JANAIB Shaikhdom, namely, Kabd, Qra'ah, 'Adan, Salu', Hazaim, and (UMM) possibly the northern part of Sud ah. It is thus bounded on the east by ^ , the^sea, on the north by Kuwait Bay, and on the south by Dhula'-al- ^ ^ Mi aijil. This is one view of the meaning of the name. According to another authority Umm Janaib is a small sepa rate district, somewhat higher than Hazaim and to the west of it, and of Labibah, containing the hill of Kahaiyah and the wells of Shadhaf and ^ afrah which we have included in Hazaim. A point on the left bank of the Jarrahi Eiver, about 8 miles north- JANJIREH east of Fallahiyeh Town, from which a number of small canals radiate into the country to the southwards. The following is a table of the canals belonging to the Janjireh system; they are given approximately in order from east to west:— Name of canal. Dependent popnlation, Number of date palms.

The spot known as Janjireh has some date groves but is situated in fairly open country ; it is connected by winding j^aths with Buziyeh and Fallahiyell Town. It has been pointed out that^ as the heads of a number o£ canals are commanded at Janjireh, the place is one which it would probably be advantageous to occupy in case of military operations in the neighbourhood. Singular Jannaibi A large tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate^ Yamani by extraction^ but now belonging to the Grhafiri political faction and Sunnis in religion. They are partly settled and partly nomad. Their metropolis is Stir; but they also possess Masirah island and^ interspersed with Hikman and Al Wahibah, occupy in a desultory fashion the Solith-East Coast of ''Oman from Has Jibsh^ where they have a village^ to the commencement of the Dhilfar District; some of them visit Murbat in Dhtlfar, and the cave dwellings on Kas Sajar and the small hamlet of Safqot at the west end of Dhufar are said to be occupied by members of this tribe* A few reside among the HiklHan of Mahot. Detached colonies of Jannabah are found at Bahlah^ Khadhra-bin-Dalfa/ and ^Izz in 'Oman Proper and at Wadi Manumah in BatinaJl. It is necessary to distinguish the settled portion of the tribe, chiefly at Sur, from the migratory pastoral and fishing sections further to the south. The former, known in common with some of the Bani Bu 'Ali as ' Suris/' own and navigate a large number of se^ going vessels which run to Bombay, Zanzibar and the Bed Sea: they are JANNA BAH HI !004 JANNABAH also merchants^ having large commercial dep6ts at Sur^ and the Hajriyin of the interior carry on all their foreign trade through them. The pastoral portion of the tribe are dark-skinned^ thin and undersized but not ill- looking; they wear their hair long and confine it round the head with a leathern thong. They are disliked by their neighbours and appear to have little or no religion. In the cool season they come down to the coast with their herds of camels and goats^ which are said to be very large,, retreating again to caves in the hills on the approach of the south-west monsoon. It has been noticed that those who fish are of a lighter complexion than their purely pastoral brethren and that their cranial and facial type is more or less peculiar to themselves. As a tribe the Jannabah bear an evil reputation. Those of Sur indulged in slave-dealing and even piracy as long as these courses were open to them^ and the Jannabah of the south-eastern coast are wreckers and robbers to a man. The Jannabah are divided into the following sections :— Section. Fighting strength.* R emaeks. 'Aramah 400 At Stir. **jj£ Fawane Wjlji 600 At Stir, in Ja'alan, and on Masirah island. M Ohaijalin i) Ke 450 At Stir and on Masirah island. Maja'alah 300 Nil Makhanah 500 At Stir and on Masirali island. AjUr* * Evidently under-estimated. These sections are generally found intermingled at the places occupied by the tribe. Some of each section are JBedouins. The total number of the Jannabah may be about 12,000 souls, of whom over 9,000 are settled; but the strength of the nomad portion who inhabit the southern desert is necessarily difficult to estimate. The Jannabah have a perpetual feud with the A1 Wallibah, the enmity between these two tribes being the most deadly and constant in 'Oman* The Tamimah of(4?4) i JARAMAH (KHOR-AL-) 905 the Jannabah is Mahmad-bin-Mubarak, o£ the Makhanah section, who resides at Sur. A small sandy islet, about 12 feet high and J of a mile in extent, lying JAR All) 10 miles oif the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq about midway between Qatif jj and Musallamiyah bay: it is 14 or 15 miles south-east by east of the seaward end of Abu 'Ali island. It may be regarded as belonging to the Sanjaq which it adjoins. An inlet of the sea which breaks the coast-line of the ^Oman Sultanate JAE AMAH^ at a point 12 J miles east of the Sur creek and 4 miles west of Eas-al- (KH0R-AL-) Hadd. The entrance, which runs from north to south, is a mile long ^ L . and winds between cliffs 60 feet high; its breadth is about 150 yard^ but the channel at one point contracts to 60 yards and at the inner end it is divided into two by an island. Inland the Khor expands into a large, shallow basin with a length of 2^ miles from north-west to south-east, surrounded for the most part by cliffs 100 to 200 feet high but having, at its south end, a low and shelving beach with a few scattered trees. The interior of the inlet forms a perfectly sheltered harbour which is easily accessible to steam-vessels drawing less than 15 feet of water. Fish abound, and there are wells on the southern beach yielding brackish but drinkable water sufficient for a caravan of 20 0 camels and an equal number of men. The owners of the place are the Muwalikh tribe of Hadd, and the only actual occupants at the present time are a few fishermen who have some miserable huts near the wells already mentioned; but the ruins of a considerable village, said to have been called Labid t^J, are traceable close to the same spot. Disputes regarding the free use of Khor-al-Jaramah by mariners occurred between 1877 and 1880, and the British authorities, as related m the historical portion of this Gazetteer, were obliged to intervene. * A plan of Khor-al-Jaramah will be found in Admiralty Chart No. 2369— 10-C. ; and a route from this place to the coal-fields of the Jabal Khamis range, de scribed by Capt. Dowding, is among the records of the Intelligence Branch, Simla906 JAEBAHI DISTRICT JARRAHI This district of Southern'Arabistan has on the north-east of it ^ the Eamuz district, on the north-west the Ahwaz district, on the west ^ j ' the Fallahiyeh district, on the south Ma'shur and its connected terri- DISTEICT tlie eagt tlie J£indiyan district; it is itself situated upon both sides of the Jarrahi River in the upper two-thirds of its course. Boundaries. —The north-easternmost corner of the district is at tlie tomb of Shah Nabi ^ at the foot of some hills to the east of the Jarrahi, whence the boundary runs westwards through the southern extremity of Cham Manf in the Ramuz District to a mound named Rumais From Rumais it goes south to Qarqar village on the right bank of the Jarrahi; immediately below which it crosses that river to the left bank and continues southwards for 5 miles : it then runs south-eastwards to 'Aquleh about 8 miles west of Ma'shur where it turns to the north-east: finally it passes through a large mound named Radhwan 8 miles east of Khalfabad and so returns, following a range of low hills, to the point from which it started. Thysical features. —With the exception of a few miles of broken oround and ravines in the extreme north-east, the district consists of o open and generally level plains of alluvial soil. Parts of these are tilled by rainfall, and there is some permanent cultivation along the banks of the Jarrahi. The only trees are a few dates near villages and a little scrub along the river. People. —The fixed population of the district is collected entirely upon the banks of the Jarrahi River ; it does not appear now to exceed 4,000 souls, and the number is said to have declined during the last 5 years in consequence of a series of bad harvests. Of the whole nearly 2r ,500 personsj, or more than half, are Ka^ab, while other tribes deserving of separate mention are the Haiyadir at Butliyeh, Cham) Rahaneh, Gumbuzon and Thilith ; the Maqatif who are perhaps a branch of the Bani Tamim (11), at Aquleh Takhait and Abu Alaiq , and some Bandanyeh, or immigrants from Ma'shur, at Hadameh. The Haiyadir, who number 300 souls or more, are identified by some with the Haidaris of the Hindiyan District i they are said to be well armed with rifles and to own 50 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. The Maqatif are about 400 persons ; the Bandariyeh about 300. The balance of the district population is made up of miscellaneous Arabs and Peisians. Khalfabad is the principal village : among its inhabitants are a family oi clan, known as Amareh sjUl, on whom the Haiyadir are dependent.JARRAHI DISTRICT 907 Irom Hadameh upwards the houses of the settled population are all of miidj and foi some distance below it low mud walls and gables are seen ; but still further down the dwelling's are booths or wigwams of matting and reeds. These differences in domestic architecture are due less to differences in civilisation than to the nature of the materials available. Where mud is used it is mixed with broken straw and is made up into flattish oval blocks which do not possess a single straight line ; this is the form of brick used by Arabs on the Karun and in the Fallahiyeh District as well as on Jarrahi, but in r allahiyeh Town there are one or two buildings of the ordinary square-shaped thin burnt bricks of Persia. Matting is made of a stiff reed called Qassab^ crushed flat ; but in the construction of houses a large kind of bulrush called Bardi or Labbun is employed^ of which the blade is flat on one side and convex on the other but contains little substance. Eoof supports are made by binding up Labbun into faggots about 1 foot in diameter. The nomad population consists chiefly of Bawiyeh of the ''Amur and Bani Khalid sections from the Ahwaz District. Some Sharifat of the Kajaibat and Bani Eashid sections are found almost permanently in the neighbourhood of Khalfabad., and it is a question whether they should be reckoned as among the sedentary or the Bedouin inhabitants of the district. Villages and settlements,-— permanent villages of the district are described at length in the articles upon the Jarrahi River ; and a short table now follows of some of the inland settlements where culti vation is carried on : — Name.

Agriculture and Canal irrigation is confined, in tlie Jarrahi district, to a space of about three square miles in the neighbouiliood of Cham-as-Sabi^ and the crops, except on the banks of the river, depend entirely on rainfall. W heat, barley, and a little sesame are the staples of cultivation j onions and inferior tobacco are grown in the gardens of villages. The irrigation of gardens is by means of skin lifts worked by cattle. The exported produce of the district finds its way chiefly to the towns of Ma'shur and Buziyeh from which are procured m Return piece-goods, spices, tea, and sugar. Dates are brought from the Failahiyell and rice from the Ramuz District. CommunicationS.— Vh-Q JarraM River is navigable by boats up to Khalfabado and the country on both sides of it is free from obstacles to movement. The articles on the Jarrahi River and Fallahiyell District and the paragraph on routes in 'Arabistan may be consulted. Administfatiou* —The Jarrahi district was once a pait of the DOraq principality which belonged to the Shaikh of the Ka ab. In 1865 the Persian Government separated it from the Fallahiyeh^ District and constituted it, together with Ma'shur and the district of Hindiyan, into a separate governorship. Now it is a district by itself and is undei the Shaikh of Muhammarch, who is locally represented by a visiting agent from Ma'shur; but it is understood that the Shaikh holds it 111 farm only from the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Mushir-ud -Dauleh, who.JARRAHI RIVER 909 joint property it is said to be. Revenue is assessed at one-fourth of gross produce on canal-irrigated lands at Cham-as -Sabi only; at one-fifth on river -bank lands ; and elsewhere^ that is at inland settlements^ at a fixed cash rate of 44 Qrans per Faddan annually. The district is said to be worth 14^000 to IS^OOO Tumans a year. Frequently pronounced Yarrahi. This river is formed within the JARRAHI bounds of Ramuz District by the junction, near QaFeh-i-Shaikh, of the Ramuz * river from the north-east with the Marun river from the south- RIVER east. The Jarrahi, possibly with its tributory the Marun, —and not, as has sometimes been supposed, the Hindiyan —appears to be the Tab river of the medieval Arab and Persian geographers.t Course.—Passing a place known as Cham Mani'' 3 or 4 miles below the point of its formation, the Jarrahi breaks through the belt of low hills which form the boundary on this side of the Ramuz District and emerges near the village of Cham-as -Sabi into the Jarrahi District. The range of hills, it may be remarked, comes from the north-west and dies away in undulating ground at some distance short of the right bank of the river; its course is resumed on the left bank somewhat higher up-stream, and the gap in the middle—through which the river passes—is occupied by a tract of broken, hilly ground about 10 miles in extent. From Cham-as- Sabi the river runs via Khalfabad to the village of Maqtu^, which is about 11 miles north-north-west of Ma'shur ; the length of this reach is nearly 30 miles, it is free from serious bends, audits general direction is from north-east to south-west. At Maqtu' the river changes direction and runs for about 10 miles west-north-west to Qarqar, where it leaves the district of Jarrahi and enters that of Fallahiyeh. In the Fallalliyell District its course is somewhat winding, * ,e Eamuz river' appears to be the name least open to objection, as well as that most generally understood, for the river which passes a few miles east of Eamuz Town flowing southwards. It is sometimes spoken of, but only in the hills, as the Ab-i-'Ala or Ab-i-Zard ; in strictness, however, these appear to be the names of streams which go to form the river and not of the river itself. The Ramuz river has also been described as the ' Jibur but this name does not appear to be locally recognised. Of the manner of formation of the Eamuz river we have as yet no authentic information, and the statements which have been obtained from native sources are conflicting. The water which it brings down is fresh and good, f See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate.910 JARRAHI RIVER but its average direction to a point distant 14 miles in a straight line from Qarqar is due west; at the point in question it turns to the south-west and runs for 5 miles further to a place called Khazineh tiijk or the Reservoir, about 2 miles north of Buziyell Town, where it is mostly- dissipated in canals. The remaining stream now ceases to be the Jarrahi river and becomes the Fall a hlyeh- M arid canal, which is described in the article on the Fallahiyeh. District and on which Fallahiyeh Town is situated at 3 miles below its head. Volume and hallies. —^bove Cham-as -Sabi the river is broad and rapid with a breadth of about 80 yards ; and the banks, which are of no great height, are covered with tamarisks. For some few miles below Cham-as-Sabi the same characteristics are preserved and the stream is divided by tamarisk-covered islands into several arms. Below Kbalfabad the Jarrahi runs with a slow current, is 60 to 70 yards broad, and resembles a sinuous canal cut deep through the alluvial soil ; receiving no affluents, its stream from this point onwards continually diminishes in volume while its breadth decreases to about 40 yards. Above Khalfa- bad, though bare, level plains adjoin it on both sides, some fuel and grass are obtainable ; but below Khalfabad both fuel and forage are scarce until a more productive region is entered again near Tuwaiqiyeh. Date groves begin on the right bank at the place where the river changes its direction from west-north-west to south-west, but at first they are scattered. Crossings and navigation. —The Jarrahi is fordable in summer at numerous places, and some fords near Khalfabad are practicable for laden animals during the greater part of the year, except after recent rain. There is a ford, sometimes difficult in winter but probably easy in the low season, one mile below Cham-as-Sabi; and another, passable only in summer and autumn, exists at Rahaneh, 8 miles above Maksar, where the breadth of the river is 50 yards ; its greatest depth here in winter is 13 feet, and the height of the almost perpendicular banks is 15 feet. A Ballam which can be used as a ferry boat is kept at Maksar, and there is a second at Hadameh. Boats 40 feet in length, with a beam of 6 to 8 feet and drawing 2 to 3 feet of water, can ordinarily ascend the river as far as Khalfabad at all seasons of the year. Irrigation. —One mile above Cham-as-Sabi there are the remains of an old canal which took out on the right bank of the river ; and in thejarr A hi river 911 neighbourhood of Khalfabad are traces^ running inland from the present left bank; of a large canal, or possibly of a former bed or natural branch of the river. At Hadameh, also, a dam is said to have existed, by means of which irrigation was brought to the lands of Ma^shur to the southward. The Jarrahi, throughout its length, has now only one channel ; and there are no canals in operation above the point where the river enters the Fallahiyeh. District. The Jarrahi District appears to be commanded by the river at Cham-as-Sabi but below that point, until the Fallahlyeh District is reached, the level of the river as compared with that of its banks, is generally too low to admit con veniently of irrigation.

JASHK (I) ^ P 01 ^ P ers i an Uakran and a station of the Indo-European Tele . ^ graph Department; it is situated on a promontory about 140 mi es J ' south-east of Bandar ^Abbas, 145 miles north-north-east of Masqat or NEW Town, and ^90 miles west by north of Gwadar. ^ JASHK* ^ corr ect pronunciation, but by Persians the wprd is sometimes {is if it bad two syllables, Ja-sbak,JASHK (NEW) 915 The Jashk peninsula divides Jashk East Bay on the one side from Jashk West Bay on the other, and it is itself nearly cut of! from the mainland by a winding creek which runs inland from the western bay at a point 3| miles northwards from the tip of the promontory. The land on which New Jashk stands is low ; the upper stratum consists of a loose sand mixed with clay and the lower stratum of hard calcareous matter, chiefly a shelly conglomerate. Climate.—Hhe climate of the place is extreme; the thermometer, which may fall to 44'3° Fahrenheit in winter, sometimes rises to 110° in summer; and the heat is rendered more trying by the moistness of the atmosphere, the mean humidity of which often exceeds 70 per cent, of saturation. The prevailing winds are easterly, but in winter it frequently blows from the north-west. Sandstorms are' of frequent occurrence and during their continuance the air is heavily charged with a fine red dust. Malarial fever is prevalent in the cold weather. The normal rainfall is about 4| inches per annum, Surroundings. The extremity of the Jashk peninsula is called Jashk- i-Sar^ ; it carries a small tomb, about 15 feet above sea-level, which is styled Shaik Sa^id, Hindi, and which is an occasional object of pilgrimage. The recognised boundary of the British telegraph station, marked by a wire fence, crosses the peninsula in a zigzag line about | of a mile from its extremity.* In the centre of the space enclosed hy this land boundary and the sea stand the telegraph buildings with the British military barracks about 300 yards to the south-east of them. In Persian territory, on the eastern side of the peninsula at miles from Jashk-i-Sar, is a strip of coast distinguished by the name of Damilan , and beyond it is another known as Kurazi &lt;jrjy . On the western side of the peninsula, partly within and partly without the boundary of the telegraph station, is the West Bay in which is the ordinary landing place for New Jashk; and on this bay, just outside the station boundary, is a tumble-down mud fort, the property of the Persian Government, which, not being required for military purposes, is used as a place for drying and storing whitebait. On the same shore, half a mile beyond the fort, begins a date grove called Maksa * The actual boundary is thus seemingly not in accordance with the Agreemecfc of 1887 {vide Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. X, pages 93-94 and fobtnote), but closer examina tion of the question with plans shows that the apparent discrepancy is due to the distance of the telegraph station from the point having been underestimated ; that distance instead of being 800 is nearly 700 yards, 3 N 3916 JASHK (NEW) a mile in extent, where there is a large mansion with Badgirs, owned by a private merchant but sometimes used as a place of quarantine. Inhabit an ts.- -N e w Jashk is divided into two parts, namely, the European station, with a native settlement depending on it, and a Persian village which surrounds the Persian fort. In the European station, the position of which has already been described, reside all the members of ^he telegraph establishment with their families and servants. The Persian village consists of 45 mud houses and 150 date-leaf huts; it is inhabited by Baluchis, Saiyids, Mulais, Raids,;. Maids who are fishermen, and negroes who are either labourers or domestic slaves: in addition fco these there are some natives of the Minab District and other Persians, also a large number of half-breeds of various kinds. Except the Persians, who are Shi^ahs, the people are Sunnis and of the latter sect two divisions are represented, the Baluchis being Hanafis and the Saiyids Shafi'is. The Persian, Baluchi, Arabic and Hindustani languages are all spoken and some of the people understand a little English. The inhabitants of the Persian village are mostly traders, agriculturists, graziers and fishermen. Agriculture is now at a low ebb in consequence of a succession of bad seasons; and a formerly considerable trade, especially by the Saiyids, in goods imported from Karachi and Bombay, has declined since the establishment of an Imperial Persian Customs post in 190a. Skipping, anchorages and New Ja^hk is a fortnightly place of call for the steamers of the British India Company and is the chief port of Persian Makran after Chahbar. Four Baqarahs of about 12 tons burden and trading only to the Arabian coast belong to this place. There are anchorages suitable for steam vessels on both sides of the Jashk promontory in which shelter can be found from all but southerly winds : the customary berth is in the West Bay about 3 miles from the landing place. Native boats use the creek already mentioned as leading out of the West Bay ; the course is winding, its length 4 or 5 miles, and it has some depth of water inside, but the bar is almost dry at low tide. The estimated value of the trade of the port in the year 1906 was— imports, about £3,264, exports, about £841 sterling. A Goanese firm under British protection act as agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company. There is also 1 British Indian (Muhammadan) general merchant.JASHK (NEW) 917 Water and supplies, The^escuroeb of New Jashk are inconsiderable. Water, which is brackish, is from wells, the least bad of which is situated nearly 1 mile north-east of the telegraph station buildings and about 300 yards from the west coast of the peninsula ; the water from this well is raised by bullock power into an elevated iron tank from which it is carried by iron pipes to a cistern at the back of the telegraph office ; this water is not used for drinking except by natives. Drinking water for the telegraph staff is obtained from two rain storage covered masonry reservoirs, sunk in the ground, one of these has a capacity of 81,000 and the other of 58,000 gallons, and another similar tank of about 84,000 gallons capacity is now being constructed for the benefit of the Indian Military guard, Food stuffs and even vegetables for the European community have, during the recent bad agdcultural years, been mostly imported from India and Bandar ; Abbas. Livestock are about 200 cattle and 200 goats and sheep; there being no fodder there are no transport animals, and some of the residents who own camels keep them at Old Jashk. British telegraph station. —The telegraph station is an important one. The staff consists of 10 or 12 European clerks under a Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and there is an Assistant Surgeon in medical charge of the establishment. The inspecting officer of the land line from Gwadar to New Jashk also has his headquarters here. The Jashk office is connected with Karachi by a cable; with Chahbar, Gwadar, Pasni, Ormarah and Karachi by a two-wire land line; with Masqat by a cable; and with Bushehr by two cables, one of which runs direct and the other via Hanjam. The cables enter the sea at a point 550 yards south-east of the telegraph office; and of the 3 which at first turn westwards the nearest to shore is that to Hanjam, the next the direct cable to Bushehr, and the outermost that to Masqat. Messages are now transmitted direct between Karachi and Tehran, the current being reinforced at Jaslik and again Bushehr : from 500 to 1 ,000 messages pass in the 24 hours, in one direction by day and in the other by night, this being arranged in alternation with another line. The telegraph office and quarters form three blocks of substantial and commodious flat-roofed buildings. For the protection of the place a detachment of 50 sepoys of the Indian Army under a native officer are posted at New Jashk; they are accommodated hi well-built barracks which are capable of containing double the number. Political relations and administration.— head of the telegraphJASHK (ID isJUU. or OLD JASHK 918 JASHE (NEW) station is the political representative of the Britisli Government at New Jashk, and as such exercises jurisdiction over British subjects and deals with the Persian officials and local authorities under the orders of his superior, the Director at Karachi. The Persian Imperial Customs establishment consists of a Mudir and 4. armed guards locally recruited; the revenue collected by them during the year 1906 amounted to 8,728 Qrans, MU Qrans and 1,779 Qrans on account of imports, exports, and stamp duty respectively. Apart from these Customs employes the Persian Government have no agents at Jashk. The quarantine arrangements are in charge of the British medical officer of the telegraph station, on behalf of the Persian Government. Author, ity over Persian subjects in the settlement is exercised by the Mm of Old Jashk whose position is described in the article on Jashk District, In English generally 'Jask' and at a former period The administrative capital of the Jashk District and residence of the chiefs; it is situated 7 miles north of New Jasbk and one mile inland from the shore of Jashk West Bay. The village is completely surrounded by date groves which contain about 2,000 trees. The chief points^ of interest are the ruins of a reputed Portuguese fort, with an old gun lying buried in the ground, and a Ziyarat called Shah Mardan cV which is much frequented by BalucMs. There are about 10 mud houses and 150 mat huts and the population may be estimated at 800 souls, of whom rather more than half are Baluchls; the remainder are Shaikhs, Jats and slaves. Dates, wheat and Arzun are cultivated, and to a lesser extent cotton and barley. The village possesses 200 camels, 50 donkeys, 60 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Water is from 2 wells, 8 feet deep, and is muddy but sweet. The inhabitants are chiefly agriculturists, except some weavers called Julahag ; but they deal also in carpets called Zilu jbj and Khirsak in date mats called Tak , an » firewood and ghi which they export to Qishm Island and to the Ara ian coast, especially to Batinah, their trade relations being chiefly wit ese places and with the Persian districts of Bashakard and Ml nab. with Masqat Town is now insignificant. Some silk embroidery is one by the women and fishing nets are made. The administration is noticed4^() JiSHK DISTRICT 919 in the article on Jashk District. There is good partridge shooting, and some hares are obtainable^ near Old Jashk. The Jashk district, except in the administrative sense, is a division of JASHIt Persian Makran, and most of the general remarks contained in the article - v on the coast of that region apply to it without modification.

Our attention will, however, be conlined to the plain which here, as elsewhere in Persian Makran, skirts the sea and extends to the outer hills that rise at some miles inland. Physical characteristics, —-The remarks under this head in the article on the Persian Makran coast hold good of the Jashk district and need only to be supplemented by a slight description of some of the principal natural features. These are given below, in tabular form, in their order from west to east:— Name.

A summit of the coast range rising to 1,725 feet. A stream with low banks about 100 yards apart. On the seaward slopes of the range is a re markable rock-pillar of natural origin. These hills are divided from the rest of the coast range by the Tawarkand stream on the west and the Bahmadi stream on the east. Between the south eastern extremity of the Parkan hills and the Gaigan bill the stream runs in a deep and narrow defile called Tang Bahmadi. The hill is qaoin- shaped with a sheer fall to westward ; the precipices are of a yellow colour, As seen from New Jashk it somewhat resembles the Rock of Gibraltar. Towards the coast the bed of this torrent is 200 yards wide and the banks 40 foet high. There is good but scanty water in wells. There is no water except after rain. There is a small village on this hill where a few Shikaris live. Some pools and natural reservoirs contain good water. Tfle Shehroau is &lt;3i'y except after heavy rain.

A river which near the coast is low in summer and au tumn, but after heavy rain becomes impassable and over flows its banks. Ordinarily it is a rapid stream 50 yards wide and 3 feet deep with well-defin* ed banks 20 feet high which are in places half a mile apart. The water is good. Resembles the Shehr- nau above. A river somewhat re sembling the Jagin, but with low banks which at 10 miles from the coast are I- of a mile apart. A river which overflows its east bank in the mari time plain during high rises but is dry except after rain. The water is sweet. At 4 miles from the sea the Sadaich re ceives a tributary called the Haimin on its right bank and at 6 miles from the sea another called the Gilik t£jUl/ on its left ; the latter has a tributary called the Raiku R emarks. The river is some times impassable for 6 or 6 and even for 10 to 15 days. In the plain there is a thick belt of tama risk and acacia jungle on both banks. Near its mouth are two mangrove swamps called Janakani^jl&amp;L and Nazai ' separated by a marshy plain 7 miles wide through which the river wanders. The local chiefs are said to derive some revenue from the creek formed by the month of the river j they impose dues on the boats which call to cut mangroves. This stream has a number of small tributaries ; it is dry except after heavy rain After entering the maritime plain this river has a sandy bot tom abounding in quicksands, and the banks are lined with tamarisks and aca cias. The mouth of this river is a tidal creek with a shallow bar ; the coast on the east side of it is swampy, and on the west bare white saodhills called Surap, which waler can be obtained by digging, extend along the beach for 6 miles.922 JASHK DISTRICT Name.

These smaller streams con tain water after rain only and their banks are low and ill-de fined. Before leaving tlie subject of physical conformation we may note tbat the coast of tbe Jashk district is in general low and marshy. From Ras-al -Kuh to the mouth of the Jashk creek the shore consists of a narrow strip of sand, in places bearing tufts of grass, whicb has mangrove swamps behind it and in places is penetrated by inlets; of these Khor Hamid some miles east of Eas-al-Kuh, is the most considerable and is to some extent frequented by boats. At New Jashk there is a short interval of well-defined coast; and east of this again mangrove swamps, with creeks which are visited only for fishing and cutting firewood, resume their place till the Surap sandhills are reached near the mouth of the Sadaich river. Population. —The inhabitants of the Jashk district are comprised in the population which is described in the general article on the coast of Persian Makran. The Hots may in this district be regarded as the dominant tribe, inasmuch as the chiefs are of their number. The total population (including hill villages not given in the table below) is rough y estimated at 23,000 souls ; the fighting strength of the first line, that is, of men armed with modern rifles, at 500 ; and that of the second linfi at 3,000. The population of tbe coastal strip with which we are con- cerned is about 9,000 souls.

Administration. —The Jashk district^ though situated in Persian Makran, is under the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, by whom the local rulers are appointed. There are at present two joint chiefs or Mirs of Jashk, Mustafa Khan and Mir Hoti ; who reside at Old Jashk and are relations ; the former is the principal chief. These chiefs belong to the Hot tribe. Nothing is, or ever has been, paid by them to the Persian Government on account of the farm of the district; the nominal ground of their exemption from payment is that they are responsible for the Persian fort at New Jashk, but this is not the real reason. The chiefs collect several taxes for their own benefit, notably a land tax which produces about 1,500 Tumans per annum, a poll tax of 10 Qrans yearly on all men of substance and traders, a poll tax of 2 Riyals a year on male adults in the villages of Luran, Bahal and Kuh Mubarak, and a tithe or Dahyaki ^ on grain produce and dates. In the fishing season they also take 10 Eiyals on account of every fishing boat; and they receive annually 15 camels under the Baluchi title of Gurjawi Some of the slaves of the chiefs constitute a sort of police force. The political institution of greatest importance in the district is the British telegraph station described in the article on New Jashk, and the chiefs of Jashk receive an annual telegraph subsidy of Rs. 840 through the representatives of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Persian Governnient is as yet unrepresented save by a Mudir of the Imperial Persian Customs and his subordinates^ 4 armed guards, who are posted at New Jashk.

The largest towa in the dominions of the Amir of Jabal Shammar in Central Arabia; it lies, entirely surrounded by deserts^ about 365 miles south-west of Baghdad; 225 miles north-west of Hail and 310 miles south-east of Damascus. Site, —Jauf-al-'Amir is about 1^850 feet above sea-level. It is situated on a dead flat plain forming the bottom of an extraordinary depression of oval form which has a maximum diameter^ from north-west to south-east^ of about 3 miles. The walls of the depression are sandstone hills supporting a desert plain some 500 feet higher than Jauf. These hills are called on the north side Jal-al-Jauf , and on the south side Tabaiq ; behind Tabaiq, between it and the Nafud which begins two hours from Jauf ; is a clayey and pebbly tract called Safihah where Bedouins cut brushwood and dry grass for sale at Jauf. The Syrian road leaves Jauf by a defile in the Jal on the north-west side of the valley. At the opposite end is the descent into the Jauf basin from the Hail side which occupies about half an hour. The symmetrical form of the Jauf depres sion is broken &gt; on the west on^ by a limestone spur which projects from the encircling heights and subsides by degrees into the centre of the plain. The soil of the valley is a sterile ; crusty sand with clayey hollows here and there in which water collects; leaving salt behind when it dries ; ram however is rare.* Town. —The town forms a curve with the concavity to the south-west j for two-fifths of its length it runs from west-north-west to east-south-east and the remainder lies north-west and south-east. Its length is over 2 miles and its breadth less than half a mile., the latter being greatest near the point where the change occurs in the direction of its axis. The orchards and palm groves form a continuous line parallel to the town on its w r est side and mostly stand clear of it towards the western side of the valley. Jauf -air 'Amir is divided into a number of quarters; each of which is separately walled, and contains houses irregularly placed and interspersed with small orchards and with deep pits from which earth has been dug for building * A sketch of the Jauf oasis and basin is given in Lady Aiine Blunt's Pilgrimage (I&gt; 120).

Dirat Hattab is the broadest part of the town and at Salman occurs the more southward bend pre viously described. Habab possesses a strong tower and was in former days at feud with the quarter of Dirat Marid. DalhamTyah was destroyed in 1838 and has not been rebuilt. To these quarters may be added the village of Ghuti , a small walled hamlet of a dozen houses with a tower at each corner, which lies a few hundred yards to the east-south east of Khadhmah. About half a mile south of Khadhmah, on rising ground, stands a large fort built by Ibn Rashid about 40 years ago; it has walls 40 feet high and there is a tower considerably higher at each of the angles ; it is furnished with loopholes and machicoulis. About 100 yards to the north-west of this fort is a copious spring which waters some date gardens. Inhabitants. —The population of jauf-al-^Amir is estimated at about 6,500 souls. The inhabitants are Sahrarat, Hawazim (who are possibly Harb) and 'Anizah of the Ruwalah section j also, it is said ; some Bani Tamim, besides negroes and Mutawalladin. About a quarter of the fighting men of the town are armed with breech-loading rifles. The Jaufis are not naturally travellers, and those among them who are better off seldom leave the oasis unless to visit Hail or to make the pilgrimage to Makkah; some of the poorer sort however go every year to the Syrian Hauran to labour for hire among the Druses. Cultivation and The resources of Jauf-al- ; Amir are chiefly agricultural. The place is famous for its dates, which are unusually large and good, and particularly for a luscious and juicy sort called Hilwah; m all some 15 varieties are grown. Wheat, barley, maize, millet and lucerne are cultivated in the date plantations, but the cereals are not raised m quantities equal to the local consumption. Fruits include figs, apricots, peaches, oranges and grapes; a few vegetables also are grown. All theJAUF-AL-'AMIR 93f crops are irrigated from wells worked by 'bullocks : travellers disagree as to the distance of the water from the surface^ Imt it appears to be ordinarily 3 or 4 fathoms. The best wells for drinking purposes belong to the Khadhmah quarter. Besides wells there are some springs and tanks, but the latter, owing to the infrequency of rain, are not of much service. The water of Jauf is generally insipid and sometimes evil tasting. The only cattle kept are those employed on the wells. There are practically no horses or camels, and transport, when required, is obtained from the surrounding Bedouins. Trade. —Jauf-aVAmir is a market town for the Arab tribes of the country round, who bring in wool, hides, ghi, milk and occasionally ostrich feathers, and provide themselves here, generally by way of barter, with dates and other provisions, gunpowder, calico of various sorts, 'Abas^ leather, and camel furniture. The Bedouins, as already remarked, are the carriers of Jauf, and the balance of food grain which the town requires is imported through them from abroad. A strange product of the desert which the Bedouins bring to Jauf for sale in large quantities is a wild grain called Samh; it resembles canary seed, has the colour of wheat, and can be made into bread. Travelling Syrians and occasionally Persians from Najaf visit Jauf and do business there. The artificers of Jauf have a great reputation throughout north-western Arabia for their work in metal and marble ; from the latter coffee-mortars and pestles are made. Light 'Abas, spears, copper-ware, leather, camel-furniture and sandals are the other manufactures of the place. Administration. —The Amir of Hail is (or was till recently) represented at Jauf-al-'Amir by a governor and a military garrison of about 50 men. Some of the date plantations are owned by the Amir as his private property. Dependencies.- —The following places, one of which is important, may most conveniently, as tbey lie in the vicinity of Jauf-al-''Amir and do not belong to any region which has a recognised name, be described here :— Name.

The place has good palms: at the north end is a rocky mound with a ruin. Ruwalah Bedouins ('Anizah) camp about here. The town lies in a broad hollow, somewhat broken up by sand* hills and protruding rocks and surrounded by sandstone clifis» The surface soil is nearly pure sand. The town is scattered amidst the date-plan tations which are more extensive than those of Jauf-al- 'Amir ; but there are 4 more or less com pact groups of dwell ings called 'Umran , Hirkan J6jib ) Faiyad jbi and Su* 4U haiyan . The water is good, but some of the wells are deep, rendering irriga tion laborious. The inhabitants are mostly artisans who work in wood and iron. A well-beaten track leads from Jauf-al-^Amir by Jawah to Sakakab, and the march from Sakakah to Qarah and thence to Jauf presents no diffi culties. The valley in which stand Qarah and Sakakah contains many inscribed rocks. JAZIRAH ^ division of the Baghdad Sanjaq of the Baghdad ¥/ilayat in Turkish 'Iraq ; it was created in 1884, at the time of the separation of the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats, out of territory which had previously formed part of the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah. There is no a island ' in the Tigris in this part of its course, and the name Jazirah appears to have been given to the Qadha merely because it is situated in ' Mesopotamia 3, ,940 JAZlRAH TopuiaUon.—W&amp;z whole fixed population of the Qadha is estimated roughly at 15,000 Muhammadan souls, of whom the majority are Shi^ahs. There are also a few Jews. Resources. —The assets of the Qadha are altogether agricultural and pastoral. Wheat and barley are grown, and horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, buffaloes and sheep and goats are bred. Gram, ghi and wool are exported. The liquorice bush grows wild. Administration. —JazTrah is a Qadha of the 2nd class and has Suwairah for clef'lieu. Besides the Nahiyah of Jazirah, of which the headquarters are located at Suwairah, there is only one other Nahiyah in the Qadha, that of A'aiwij (2nd class), and it is said to have no existence except on paper. Much of the cultivable land in Jazirah belongs to the Dairat-as-Saniyah. Also called Jazirat-al-'Amair but this second name is ambiguous being borne by both Jinnah and Mnsallamiyah islands. Jinnah is an island a mile off the coast of the Sanjaq of Hasa near Musallamiyah bay \ it lies about 9 miles north-west of Abu 'Ali island and 3 miles south of Kas Bidya'. Jinnah is level on the top, of a light colour, and has cliffs 35 feet high on the north-east side; the western part of the island is low. The length, east and west, is about miles; and on its north-east side it is adjoined by a pearl bank known as Waih- al-Jazirah. On the north side is a mud house, occupied since 1902 by Turkish Dhabitiyahs, at first 8 and now 3 in number, over which the Turkish flag is flown; also a village of about 100 families of the Bani Khalid tribe, belonging to the Al Shahm, the Al Hasan and perhaps to other ^Amair sections, who with the inhabitants of Musallamiyall island own about a dozen pearl boats. Access to the village for native boats is afforded by a channel coming from the direction of Has Bidya' and there is a small basin with 8 fathoms of water close to the north-east of the island; but the entrance of this basin, open to the eastwards, is nearly dry at low water. Jinnah island is under the Qaim-Maqam of Qatlf ; and the local Shaikh, who belongs to the Al Shahin section of the Bani Khalid, has the title of Mudir and is paid an allowance of 30 Eiyals a month by the Turks.JIRI 941 A small but somewhat singular plain in the Eas-al-Khaimah District of the Sharjah Principality in Trucial 'Oman. Position and extent. —Jiri is shut in between a sandy desert on the west and the high hills of the 'Oman Promontory on the east^ and it forms a connecting link between the plains of Sir and Dhaid which enclose it on the north and south respectively; with these boundaries it is about 15 miles in length; from north to south, and 7 to 8 miles in breadth. At both ends it is contracted by an inclination of the western desert and the eastern hills towards each other ; but in either case a passage into the next tract remains open. Physical char act eristics. —The soil of Jiri is of a dark colour, forming a sharp contrast with the light red of the sandhills which border it upon the west; of this characteristic the detritus brought down from the hills on the east appears to be the explanation. The surface is generally sandy though firm; but in places it is more clayey, retains water after rain, and cracks when it dries. Jiri is thickly sprinkled with acacias and other wild vegetation, and in the neighbourhood of the Hadaithah wells Samr and Grhaf trees are particularly abundant; hereabouts, too, the soil is more loamy than in some other parts and produces, after rain, a good deal of rank grass and weeds. Among the plants which grow towards the western edge of the plain are Eimth, Halam, Thamam and Qasad, all of which are useful as grazing, also dwarf tamarisk. The slope of the Jiri plain is towards the coast of the Persian Gulf, but the whole of the drainage is intercepted and utilised by the inhabitants. Inhabitants. —The only fixed villages are those of Khatt, Habhab and Adhan described in the table below, and the settled population, con sisting of 'Awanat, Mazari', Naqbiyin, Sharqiyin and some Za'ab, hardly amounts to 1,000 souls. The predominant Bedouins of the district are Ghafalah and Na'im, the latter of the Khawatir section. Communications and water supply. —Routes which cross Jiri are dealt with in the paragraph on communications in the general article on Trucial 'Oman. The wells, some of which are mentioned in the paragraph on topo graphy below, are generally about 60 feet deep and are worked with a * Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from, personal observation and enquiry. A portion of Jiri is shown in the map Boute of Lieutenant-Colonel Herhert DisWowe, etc,., 1865, and the whole in the map Routt taken by Major P. Z* Cox, etc., 1905, Jim*942 JIRI bucket and rope arrangement, which limits their daily yield to about 1,200 gallons each ; but this amount they are capable of supplying, at least in the cold weather, and the water as a rule is of good quality. Administration. —Jiri is included in the dominions of the Shaikh of Sharjah and its government is in the hands of his Deputy Governor at Ras-al-Khaimah Town. Topography.-—'The following are the villages and other principal points of interest in Jiri :— Name. Position, Nature. Kemarks. Adhan At the head of Wadi Ham, of which it is often reckoned the highest up settle' ment; it is 10 miles south of Khatt and 14 miles north-east by north of Dhaid village. A village of 40 houses of the Mazari' tribe, chiefly of mud and date branches. Eesources are estimat ed at 15 camels, 50 donkeys, 30 cattle, 400 sheep and goats, and 2,000 date palms. Behind the village rises a hill known as Qumr Ilabhab One mile south east of Khatt vil lage, and about 1 mile north-east of the Qaliddi route between Eas-a 1 Khaimah Town and Dibah. A village of 35 houses of Sharqiyin. Habhab stands at the eastern foot of the hills of the 'Oman promontory. It has a Falaj of its own, dis tinct from the source which waters Khatt. Animals are stated to be 30 donkeys, a few camels, 20 cattle and 250 sheep and goats, and date palms in number about 3,500. Hadaithah At the western edge of the Jiri plain, under the sand hills which bound it. Two wells each about 10 fathoms deep and lined near their mouths with stone from the hills of the 'Oman Promon tory. The wells are in the open plain, but they are surrounded by Ashkar shrubs and some fine Ghaf trees. They are used by nomads of the Ghaf- alah tribe and of the Khawatir section of the Na'im. Hamraniyah tt) Seven miles west by sooth of Khatt village, near the western edge of the Jiri plain. A couple of wells situated in a small green oasis. Good shade is afforded by 4 or 5 substantial acacias near by. The tribes frequenting these wells are the same as at Hadaithah.JIRl '943 Name. Position. Nature. B emarks. Khatt Ml or At the eastern side of the Jiri plain close under the foot of the hills, about 12 miles south-south- east of Eas-al- Khaimah Town and 14 miles south-east by east of Jazirat-al- Hamra&gt; A village of 100 houses of 'Awanat, Waqbiyin and Sharqiyin. Some Za'ab from Jazirat- al-Hamra sojourn here in the hot weather months for the date harvest. The date plantations form a large oasis and are said to contain about 20,000 1 trees, of which -1 are owned by the Za'ab of Jazirat-al- Hamra. Livestock are esti mated at 20 camels, 30 donkeys, 25 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Water for all purposes including irrigation is supplied by a hot spring, over looking which is a tower built by the Shaikh of Shar jah ; the water of the spring is sweet and wholesome when cooled, and to bathe in the spring is believed to be a cure for certain diseases. The main range of hills receives behind Khatt the name of Jabal Kbatt. Sa'adi At the western edge of the Jiri plain, 5 miles south of Hadaithah. A pair of wells. In regard to situation and ownership they resemble the wells of Hadaithah and Hamraniyah, Saram (T* In a Wadi of the same name, said to be between Adhan and Khatt, about 6 miles north of the former. A watering place. It is used by passing caravans. Ya'ilaa (Bu) ^11x3 jj Two miles north- north-west of Hamraniyah, un der the sandhills which bound the Jiri plain on the west. 2 wells.. They are of the same character as the Ha daithah and Hamrani yah wells and are used by caravans and frequented by G-haf- alah and by Na'im of the Khawatir sec tion.944 JISSAH (BANDAR) JISS AH An anchorage on tlie coast of the 'Oman Sultanate five miles south-east (BANDAR)* Masqat Town : it is formed by a precipitous light-coloured island, 600 A jjj yards long and 140 feet high, which lies east and west across the entrance ' ^ ' of a bay one mile in length and the same in depth. The entrance round the east end of the island is 280 yards broad with a depth of 7 fathoms : tlie passage at the west end is nearly blocked by a flat rock which has only 1^ fathoms on each side of it. The outline of the bay is indented, and there is an islet towards the western side behind which, on the mainland, is a village of 60 houses of Qawasim with a date grove : this village stands on a sandy beach at the mouth of a valley and consists of a few stone houses and many mat huts. Hills rise all round the harbour and at the back of the village to a height of some hundred feet. The harbour is sheltered except from the north-east and would afford anchorage in 6 to 7 fathoms for all classes of vessels except the largest: if proper moorings were laid down a fair number of ships could be accommodated at the same time. The bottom appears to be of sand throughout; there are a few detached rocks which could easily be removed. The site is naturally adapted for fortification. Freshwater is somewhat scarce. JIZI A valley in the Western Hajar district of the Sultanate of 'Oman (WADI- which, rising in a locality 30 miles east by south of the Baraimi Oasis, AL-) t reaches the sea immediately to the north of Sallan in Batinah : its length thus between 35 and 40 miles in a straight line, and its general direction is from' west-south-west to east-north-east. Wadi-al-Jizi is apparently formed by the confluence of two other valleys, viz.,- Wadi 'Abailah from the north-west and Wadi Kitnah from the south-west; between these two, just before their junction, is a level expanse several square miles in area known as the 'Abailah plain. Wadi ^Abailah has its head in a larger plain named Hawaithah Wj** , and a well-marked ridge of hills runs parallel to it at a short distance from its left bank. The valley contains the villages * A plan of Bandar Jissah will be found in Admiralty Chart No. 2369—10-C. ; and the best account of the place, with sketches, is contained in the Proceedings of the Gov ernment of India in the Foreign Department for February 1899. f The only goo4 map of Wadi-al-Jizi is Route taken by Major P. Z, Cox, etc.,JIZI (WADI-AL) 945 of Subaitliah and Kabaidah on its left bank, at 4 and 7 miles respectively above its junction with Wadi Kitnah; and 5 miles north -west of Kabaidah is another village, Zahar j^j . on the western border of the Hawaithah plain. These are villages of the Bani Ka'ab tribes mostly of the Nawaijiym section. In Wadi Kitnah there is a village Kitnah consisting of 30 houses of Bani Kalaib of the Shawamis section.

At each village there are a few hundred date palms and every where wheat, barley, millet and lucerne are grown. Animals are not very numerous ; there are a few camels and some donkeys, besides goats and sheep. The above are the principal villages in the main valley^ and the chief tributary valleys with their village^ are; Wadi Hail 'Adha ^ from the north between Wasit and Khan^ with a village Hail ; Adha composed of 40 houses of Maqabil and Shabul; Wadi Hansi ? from the south-west about midway between Khan and Sahailah ; having a village Hansi with 40 houses of Shabul and Maqabllj and another Furfar jtiy with 15 houses of Shabul, on its left bank at 3 and 7 miles respectively from its mouth; Wadi Thiqbah &lt;*■£&gt;', from the north, coming in exactly opposite Wadi Hansi and containing the villages of Hail-ash-Shiya UsJI 10 houses ofKunud, Hail -ar-RafsahSo si KA^AB 947 60 houses of Kunudj and Thiqbah, ^0 houses of Kunud ; the village of Thiqbah is on the left bank of the Wadi of the same name at a little more than a mile from Wadi-al-Jizi. The settled population of the entire valley with its tributaries seems to be about 4^000 souls Wadi-al-Jizi runs in the hills until a short distance below Milaiyinah, when it leaves them and enters the Batinah plain. On its way across Batinah to the coast Wadi-al-Jizi is said to pass on both sides of the Hurah Barghah hill. Prom Hail down to Sihlat the valley contains flowing water; above Khawairij the stream is copious though never more than a few inches deep; below Khawairij it disappears and reappears at intervals. The fields are irrigated both by wells and by conduits from the stream. The route from Sohar Town to the Baraimi Oasis lies up Wadi-al-Jizi and over the ; Abailah plain; it is reported to be easy and not to present any obstacle which need delay field-artillery more than an hour. Travellers leave Sohar by Sallan^ whence they pass by ^Auhi and Falaj-al-Qabail to Falaj-as- Suq; 2 or 3 miles beyond Falaj-as-Suq they strike Wadi-al-Jizi^ which they follow for 4 miles and then again leave, diverging to the right for 9 miles; rejoining the W adi at Sahailah they follow it with little deviation to its head ; the further way lies across the 'Abailah and Hawaithah plains^ and then by Kharus and between Khatmat Shiklah and Khatmat Suwwad ; which are described in the article on the Jau district. Singular Junaidi • A tribe, said to be of ^Omani extraction, JUNAIDAT but not traceable in J 0man, of whom a few families are settled at Darin on Tarut island. They live by fishing and pearl diving and are Hanbali Snrmis by religion. aoA Pronounced Cha ? ab; the singular is Ka^abi (Cha^abi). The KA'AB Ka^ab are the largest and most important tribe of Southern ^ Arabistan, ^-^*5 3 p 2948 KA'AB they are Arabs, but at the present day they are to some extent Persian- ised. Distribution. —The Ka'ab^ form almost the entire population of the Fallahiyeh District, which is their headquarters, and they also occupy the greater part of ' Abbadan island, especially towards its lower end ; the articles under these names with those entitled Janjireh and Shatut include the great bulk of the villages of the Ka'ab. A few occur in the Haffar tract on the right bank of the Karun in the Muhammarell District, and some on the left bank of the Bahmanshir. Ka^ab are found in considerable numbers in the Jarrahi District, where they occupy the riverbank villages of Khar Faraih, Bun war. Bun war Eizaiq, Maksar, Maksar 'Atiqeh, Suwaireh, Kurduniyeh, Maqtu' Fauqani, Haskeh, Maqtu J Hadrani, Khamzeh, Sidaireh^ Saraimeh, Dob-al-Mir, Tuwaiqiyeh and Qarqar, and have settlements in the interior at Dauweh, ^Aquleh, Hor Trawaishid, Idaideh, Abu Saileh, Khalafiyat, Hamad and Haji Asghayar, and they spread northward into the Ahwaz District at Banneh and Shakheh : the tribe is represented also at Cham Sha'abani, Gharabi Kuchik and Hindiyan Village in the Hindiyan District. Detached colonies of Ka^ab emigrants occur further down the coast of Persia in the Lirawi, Eud-hilleh and Angali districts; but these are tribally isolated and unimportant. In Turkish 'Iraq some immigrant Ka'ab are settled at Fao. Subdivisions and numbers. —The structure of the Ka'ab tribe has been carefully investigated, but the results elicited are conflicting even as regards main divisions and subdivisions. The ordinary tribesman has no ideas whatever on the subject of the composition of his tribe, and the theories which are entertained by intelligent individuals here and there do not command general acceptance. One fact stands out clearly, - that the tribe consists partly of original and partly of adscititious families and groups, the divisional name Dris being closely associated with the former, and that of Khanafireh with the latter of these two classes. The more minute classification of the Ka'ab depends not on blood relationship but on political accidents, for the name of a headman^s family or section is generally extended to include all who find (or place) themselves under his authority; it follows that there are many semi-obsolete names, well as aliases both exact and partial.KA'AB 94.9 The following is the classification of the tribe which appears most satisfactorily to express the facts in so far as they are known:— Division.

The Dawariqeh^ of whom the name occurs more than once in the table above^ are stated to be an aboriginal race distributed among* the various branches of the Ka^ab as herdsmen and almost as serfs. It should be added that of the above only the Dris and Nassar divisions are universally960 KA'AB regarded as true Ka'ab; the Khanafireh and Muqaddana are frequently described not as Ka'abbut as Tawaif, that is (dependent) tribes/' There are said to be other adscititious Ka'ab also who are not included among either the Khanafireh or the Muqaddam. This is the system of classification of the Ka^ab which seems to be the most worthy of adoption out of two or three that have been propounded; but in order to exemplify the discrepancies of opinion which exist another is now added in brief. It is as follows III. Khanafireh (fighting strength 3,000 men). 1. Hamdi (A1 Bu) I. Dris wl)* (fighting strength 6,000 men) 1. Dris cH)* 5 2. Nasir (AlBu)^lj . 3. Nassar m II. Muqaddam (fighting strength i,100 men) 1. Is-haq m 2. Maiyah 3. Muqaddam The total strength of the Ka'ab tribe is, and must be, largely a matter of conjecture; but, if the first table of sections given above be accepted as correct, the number of fighting men arrived at is 15,722 as below: 4,750 3,042 1,200 4,680 2. Kawamil m 3. Shawardiyeh IV. Hazbeh ^ (fighting strength 3,000 men) 1. Ghuwainim (A1 Bu) 2. Hazheh 3. La'ateh (A1 Bii) Dris [ 'Asakireh. Ghubaish (Al Bu) Nassar Khanafireh Muqaddam 2,050 Total 15,722 According to the principle on which fighting strength is usually cal culated the figures given would represent a total of about 55,000 souls, a number which is not patently either in excess or in defect. These statistics do not include the Ka'ab colonies outside Southern Arabistan nor those of the Hindiyan District: the members of the latter in number about 1,500, mostly belong to a section called Sha abani not shown in any classification table of the tribe that has been obtaine Arms.~li may be added here that a large number of long-barrelled muzzle-loaders are still seen among the KVab, and that almost fighting man of the Dris and Khanafireh divisions is armed either wi one of these or with a superior weapon. The numbers of rifles possess by the Muqaddam and Hazbeh are indicated above in the table of sectioReligion and life. —The Ka'ab, like all the other tribes of Southern 'Arabistan are Muhammadans of the Shi J ah persuasion They cannot except in a few places be described as altogether settled, nor on the other hand are any considerable proportion of them truly Bedouin. The balk of the tribe are now in that stage of development, intermediate between nomadism and fixity, which is typified by the huts- less remove- able than tents and more easily abandoned than houses—in which they dwell. In out-of-the-way tracts like Shatut the Ka'ab are still very primitive in their ideas and habits ; and in some places a tradition as to the iniquity of buying and selling things for money lingers amongst them. Like the Pathans of the Indo-Afghan frontier they have a strong objection to being seen in a state of nudity, and this prejudice is even said to give rise to embarrassment among themselves when rivers have to be crossed by swimming. Where the Ka'ab possess arable lands they cultivate wheat, barley and rice; where pasture exists they own buffaloes, cattle, sheep' goats and even donkeys; in the marshes they move about in light canoes, catching fish and snaring or shooting wildfowl; at Fallahiyeh Town they are otherwise noted as the manufacturers of very fine and light woollen ^Abas for summer wear. Origin, history and political p Ka'ab claim to be 'Awamir yl,* or Bani 'Amir^ descended from a certain Kaah-bin-Rabi J -bin-' , Amir who was himself, they say, the 24th in descent from Ishmael, It is stated that the original home of the Ka'ab was in Najd and that some of the tribe are still to be found there at a place called Bishauraniyah; all efforts to identify this locality have, however, up to the present, been unsuccessful. According to tribal tradi tion the majority of the descendants of Ka'ab eventually established themselves in Northern Africa; but Nassar and Dris, the legendary pro genitors of the Ka'ab of Southern 'Arabistan made their way from Najd to Doraq and occupied it after expelling some other Arab tribes and some Afshar or 'Aushar Turks whom they found in possession. The date of these supposed events is altogether uncertain. Early i n the seventeenth century, apparently, the capital of the Ka'ab tribe was at Qubban; and there it remained until 1747, when a move was Made to Pallahiyeh Town or DOraq-al-Pallahlyeh as it was then styled nother old settlement of the Ka'ab, since abandoned, was Sablah iJbU blab cdxw; it stood on the right bank of the Karfln river, opposite ^ eislan d of Dair and tbe Marid creek. The history of the Ka'ab ' 6 m tlle eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is a part of that of962 KA'AB ' Arabistan^ which is related at length elsewhere. Here it is enough to add j that shortly after 1775 the jurisdiction of the Ka^ab chiefs seems to have I extended from the neighbourhood of Basrah, to the confines of Behbehan; but their influence declined as that of the Muhaisin rose, ] and the chiefs of the Ka^ab, stripped of political power, have sunk in i recent years into undistinguished vassals of the Shaikh of Muham- mareh. The divisional Shaikhs have no political power : the most important 1 among them are Shaikh Rizaij of the A1 Bu Ghubaish (Bait Hilayil) ; who is in charge of Buziyeh and lives there ; Shaikh 'Abud, the head of the Khanafireh ; Shaikh Musa of the 'Asakireh, and Shaikh Sultan of the Muqaddam, who is at present in jail. 1 11 Singular Ka'abi A tribe in the interior of the 'Oman Promontory, having their headquarters at Mahadhah, in the neighbour hood of which they are nearly all found.

About 60 nomad families of K a'aban belong to Qatar j 30 other nomad families wandei in the neighbourhood of Jabal-ad -Dukhan in Bahrain j and 30 milies^ employed in the pearl fisheries; are settled at Jasairah on Bahrain s ^nd. In religion the Ka^aban are Maliki Sunnis. They are said to have ompanied the Utub from Qatar to Bahrain^ but their earlier move- ^ ^ents are untraceable. 3 q 2934 KABB (KHOR-AL-) This is the name of the large salt water inlet on the east side of Bahrain Island which travellers between Manamah and the two EifS's must either cross or go round. It is a fine sheet of water with wooded \ banks and is sometimes dotted with waterfowl. At low tide the foot of the creek, called Khor-al-Maqta' Tubli is a stretch of mud covered with stumpy mangroves, which a donkey-rider can cross | at a ford 1 mile from its end without wetting his feet, A locality about 25 miles south-west of Kuwait Town, between the district of Qra/ah on the east and that of Shaqq on the west. Kabd is a row of hills or belt of high ground extending east and west over a distance of 6 miles. Immediately to the south of Kabd is a parallel ridge called Kabaidah Scuv/or Little Kabd, having to the east of it some wells called Jahliyah doUU. and to the south of it a well* known Bedouin landmark called Kijm-al-Jahtan ^ . South of Rijm-al-Jahtan, again, is Fawaris a s ma ll plain diversified by hillocks. A group of five small hills at the western end of Kabaidah is called Minaqish ; they are of a whitish hue and stand between the route from Jahrah to Hiqa/i andjfchat from Kuwait Town to Hafar.

The cove shoals gradually from its entrance^ where it is 4 miles broad and 6 fathoms deep in mid-channel^ to its head^ which is 9 miles west by south of Has 'Ashairij and within about 2 miles of the village of Jahrah. There is an anchorage^ well sheltered from the Shamal^ which would accommodate a large number of ships of 24 feet draught; but there is no deep water close to the shore ; and cargo would have to be worked in lighters or a large pier built. l^as Kadhamah is a low swampy point running out some 3 furlongs southwards into the cove at about 3 miles from its head: it is hardly above sea level, but it is partially protected by a natural bank of sand which follows the highwater line. * A sketch survey of Ddhat Kadhamah will be found in the GoverBment of India's Foreign Proceedings for July 1902. The suitability of the place as a terminus 01 proposed Baghdad Railway is discussed by Captain E. W. S. Mahon, R.E., in a re P 0 H dated 24th July 1905.

MAH*KADHI- MAIN QADHA 1 966 KADHIMAIN QADHA A division, by the Turks called Kazimiyali &lt;uJ^ 3 of the Baghdad( Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in Turkish 'Iraq. Position and boundaries Qadha of Kadhimain embraces the greater part of that narrow section of Mesopotamia which is enclosed between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates where they approacli one another in the neighbourhood of Baghdad City. On the north-east side the Tigris divides Kadhimain from the Qadha of Baghdad \ on tlie north Kaihimain appears to be in contact with the Qadhasof Samarrali and Dilaim \ the adjacent districts on the west^ south-west ; south and south-east are Dilaim ; Karbala, Hillah and Jazirah respectively Topography and tribes, —The only places of importance in this Qadha are Abu Ghnraib 5 Kadhimain Town and Mahmudiyah ; all of which are described under their proper names.

Resources.—-Apart from the town of Kadhimain the district Is rural, and its assets consist in cultivation and livestock of the same kinds as are found in the other Qadhas of the Baghdad Sanjaq, such as Jazirah The principal canals which traverse the Qadha are described in the articles on the EupliratBS river : they are those apparently from the Saqlawiyah to the Latifiyah inclusive. Admiuistvation. —The Qadha is of the 3rd class and is not ; appar ently, subdivided into Nahiyahs: the town of Kadhimain is the. clef-Ueii. The Dairat-as-Samyah have established a firm hold on the district and are represented by Mudirs at Abu Ghuraib and Mahmudiyah. Called Kazimiyah by the Turks, and known also as Imam KADHI- Musa This town in Turkish 'Iraq, situated on the right bank STAIN of the Tigris about 8 miles north-west of Baghdad City, is impor- tant both as a Shi^ah place of pilgrimage and as the headquarters TOWN of a Qadha of the same name in the Sanjaq and Wilayat of Baghdad. It is connected with Baghdad by a horse-tramway (which was constructed by Midhat Pasha, Wali of Baghdad about 1870, and runs most of the way along the top of an embankment) and with Mifadhdham on the opposite bank of the Tigris by a bridge of 21 Wats. The permanent population of the town is about 8,000 souls, all Muhammadans, of whom about 7^000 are Shi^ahs: about 1,000 are Persian subjects; 200 are British subjects, being Indians or of Indian descent; and 50 are Russian subjects of Persian race. The town is a hot-bed of vice; venereal and ophthalmic maladies are common, and the passage through the place of nearly all the Shfah corpses sent from Persia to be buried at the holy places of Najal ail d Karbala in no wise adds to its salubrity. In the cold weather the population is largely increased by Shfah pilgrims on their outward ftud return journeys.968 KADHIMAIK TOWN The chief feature of the place is the tomb of the 7th and 9th Shfah Imams, namely Musa-bin-Ja^far and his grandson Muhammad-bin- ? Ali, from whom the town derives its name of Kadhimain or ' the Two Self Restrained Ones/'' although in strictness the epithet of Kadhim belongs to the 7th Imam alone. Christians are not admitted within the precincts of the shrine, which is surrounded by a lofty wall; but a good general view of the buildings can be obtained from the roof of a Khan which faces the main entrance. The structure has the form of double cube, each of the two portions of which is surmounted by a cupola; and four tall galleried minarets spring from near the corners of the building. After his visit to the shrine in 1874 Nasr-ud-Din, Shah of Persia, imitating the munificence of Nadir Shah at Karbala, caused the twin domes to be plated and the minarets to be richly ornamented with gold, and the general effect produced by the large surfaces of the precious metal is brilliant in the extreme. The coloured encaustic tile work of the entrance gate and minarets, also the stalactite corbelling 1 below and the carved wood-work above the galleries of the minarets, are equally remarkable. The shrine is richly endowed and the endowments are under the management of the Auqaf Department of the Turkish Government by whom the salaries of the custodians and attendants are paid. There are graveyards here for devout Shfahs, of which the principal is the Maqabir-i-Quraish ; but they do not possess equal sanctity with those of Najaf and Karbala. Combs and small artistic objects of ivory, wood and tortoise-shell are manufactured for export, chiefly by Persians; Kashi ^ or encaustic tiles and bricks are also made by Persians ; and there are some skilful Persian painters who decorate walls and roofs. The weaving of silk kerchiefs and handkerchiefs is a considerable industry and some of the handkerchiefs are sent abroad as far as to Tunis and Algeria; there are also tanneries. There is a trade in Persian carpets which the pilgrims, combining business with the performance of a religious duty, bring with them from their country; and the fact that the pilgrims mostly leave their riding animals to wait for them at Kadhimain while they proceed by stage-coach to Karbala, creates a large demand for forage. The pilgrims, many of whom are visitors from cold climates, are considerable purchasers of tea, sugar and woollen cloths. Kadhimain contains 30 Khans or hostelries and over 300 shops. The principal civil officials are the Qaim-Maqam of the Qadha and representatives of the Departments of Customs and Public Debt. The ordinary police force of Kadhimain consists of about 50 Dhabitiyahs.kaiu 9^9 but at the Muharram, and on other occasions of religious excitement, large reinforcements are drafted into the town from Baghdad City, with which there is telegraphic communication. There is also a post office. The town is constituted as a municipality. Kadhimain is the headquarters of the 1st battalion of the 83rd regiment of the Eadif and also of the 4£nd brigade of the same. An honorary Naib-Karpardaz or Consular Agent is charged with the interests oi Persian subjects. (xenerally pronounced Chahafah. A well-known village in the Jabal KAHAFAH Shammar principality, about midway between Hail and Buraidah and some 75 or 80 miles from either; it is the ordinary third halting place on the Hail-Buraidah route. The village is unwalled and contains about 50 houses of the Mas^ud section of the A slam division of the Shammar. Some of the wells, which are 8 to 9 fathoms deep, have good water, and the place is reputed healthy ; there are only about 10 days^ rain in the year, at the beginning of winter. Dates, cereals and vegetables are cultivated; the best kind of date is a large, yellow variety called Fankhah; palms of all sorts are said to number about 3,000. There are the usual animals. The Turks, after their defeat in Qasim in the summer of 1904, fell back upon Kabafah. A river of Persian Makran which comes down from Gaih and reaches KAIR the sea by two mouths, of which the eastern is on Puzim Bay, 28 miles west by north of Chahbar, and the other 18 miles farther to westward on the east side of Tank point. The village of Tank is situated on the right bank of the western branch at about 3 miles from the coast, and some 50 huts, frequently empty, forming a settlement known as Kair are scattered upon both banks of the eastern branch at about 7 miles from the sea; barley, wheat, cotton and jowari are grown m small quantities round this settlement, which is occupied chiefly by Buzdars but partly also by Hots Much water comes down the Kair river when in flood ; it sometimes rises over its banks and remains ^passable for five or six consecutive days. The usual ford is at the telegraph crossing, but there is a better one 1| miles below it.970 KAKI KAKI A small town in the Dashti district of the Persian Coast, 26 miles south-sonth-east of Khurmuj town and 20 miles from the sea; it is situated about 5 miles from the left hank of the Mund river. The population is very mixed, including some of the N-asuri tribe, who are Sunnis. Kaki, 40 years ago, was larger than Khurmuj town but not so well built; the Khan of the place had at that time commenced the erection of an elaborate fort and residence. Now there are about 300 houses, but no shops ; some trade in sugar, tea and piece-goods is carried on in private houses. There are 8,000 date palms : livestock are 20 horses, 15 mules, 120 donkeys, 100 camels, 70 cattle&gt;nd 3,000 sheep and goats. Native vessels of 40 tons can ascend the Mund river almost to Kaki. A cousin of the Khan of Dashti has his seat at Kaki and acts as the Khan's deputy. Khor Kalba is not to be confounded with Kalba, otherwise called Ghallah. It is the southernmost village of the Shamailiyah district in the Sharjah Principality of Trucial 'Oman and is situated on the coast of the Gulf of 'Oman 20 miles north-north-west of Shinas in the Batinah district of the ''Oman Sultanate and 24 miles south of Khor Fakkan, Khor Kalba stands on a creek which boats can enter at high water and it is defended by a fort: it consists of 150 houses of theZa'ab tribe, who own 5 or 6 sea-going boats employed in the coasting trade. KALBAN Singular Kalbani A tribe of the ^Oman Sultanate inhabiting (BANI) both slopes of Western Hajar; they are found on the Dhahirah jy[aqniyat (740 houses), which is their principal place, at Sammah (60 houses), at Khadal (100 houses) in an affluent of JVadi Dhank, and at Miskln (200 houses), Najaid (40 houses) and 'Aridh (300 houses) in Wadi-al -Kabir. They occur also at 'Ibri m Dhahirah. On the Batinah side their villages are Zula (20 houses) in Wadi Bani Ghafir; Daiqarah (25 houses), Hiyal (70 houses), Minzifah (25 houses) and Haqaiyid (25 houses) in Wadi Mabrah; and Battah (90 houses) in Wadi Sarrami. There are also 30 houses of Bani Kalban at Bahlah in 'Oman Proper. In politics the Bani Kalban are Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi. None of them are Bedouins. KALBA (KHOR) l.

In the troubles of 1883 the Bani Kalban sided with the Sultan of ^Omail. They are sometimes at feud with the Miyayihah. re ligi® A village on the coast of the ^Omail Sultanate 12 miles north-west 0 f Sur. It has no dates or cultivation of any sort ; is unwalled and consists of 120 to 130 houses, all of mud, and a dozen shops. The Hajar hills rise behind the village at less than a mile's distance and ^adi Hilam reaches the sea at its east side. There are a few wells. The inhabitants are Bani Jabir of the Sha ; ibiym section: they are fishermen and sailors and own about 12 Badans running to Masqat Town and Sur and about 40 Hawari. They have recently become Hinawis and have allied themselves with the Bani Bu Hasan against their own tribe (1907). Kalhat is the port of Wadi Bani Jabir (I), of Kabda, and of Wadi Manqal in which is Fita. KALHAT also _ QALHAT972 KANGtTN KAN GUN In English formerly spelt ' Congoon.' With the exception of its small dependency Banak, Kangun is the northernmost of the Shlbkuh ^ ports on the Persian Coast and the only one of them lying north of the region in which the main maritime range falls directly into the sea; these high hills first approach the coast abont 6 miles west of Kangnn. Kangun is sitnated at the eastern end of a large bay, open to the south but fairly well sheltered from the Shamal, at the opposite end of which, 9 miles to the westward, stands the rival port of D£liyir» Kanguu is about 30 miles north-west of the next considerable Shibkuh port, that of Tahiri and is exactly opposite to Bahrain from which it is distant about 140 miles. The place, at the present time partially abandoned, normally consists of some 300 houses of Arabs of mixed tribes; about two-thirds of the population are Sunnis and the remainder Shi'ahs. Some of the recent emigrants are now settled at Fao in Turkish Iraq. The inhabitants of Kangun are fishermen, pearl divers and sailors owning 8 Sambuks which run to Qatar, Bahrain, Qatif, Basrah and various Persian ports; also 10 Baqarahs of the kind called 'Amilah which are used for fishing; they also cultivate dates and grain. Palms number about 9,000, and livestock are estimated at 5 horses, 300 camels, 100 donkeys, 200 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats, Good water is contained in 3 wells of 4 to 5 fathoms depth ; and there is a hot spring which is resorted to for its curative properties. Kangun possesses a fair anchorage (but inferior to that of Daiyir) in a Shamal. The number of shops is about 20. Imports are sugar, tea, piece-goods and rice; exports are wheat, barley, sheep, cattle, firewood, charcoal and onions. Kangun is the port of Jam ^ and Riz yj in the interior, 10 to 30 miles distant northwards. A square fort stands in the middle of the town. Kangun was till lately farmed by the Khan of Dashti, whose sub-lessee was one of his own relations. A post of the Persian Imperial Customs was established here in 1904.

The Qadha of Karbala extends, at a short distance west of the Euphrates, from the parallel of MusaiyiKARBALA QADHA 97 little above it) down almost to that of Najaf Town: at Musaiyib however it actually touches the river and even reaches a few miles to the east of it. On the north the Qadha is in contact with that of Dilaim . on the north-east with that of Kadhimain ; on the east with that of Hindiyah. and possibly with that of Shamiyah ; on the south with that of Najaf; and on the west with the Shamiyall Desert, Topography and mkaMtants.—By far the largest and most important place in the Qadha is the town of Karbala, described elsewhere under its own name; but the town of Musaiyib^ the settlement of Shifathah, and the village Sikandariyah. are also deserving of mention and form subjects of separate articles. Eazazah in practice belongs to the Karbala Qadha and is mentioned below in the list of Muqata'ahs, but nominally it is a separate Qadha. The chief feature of the Karbala district^— apart from the Euphrates river with which its connection is slight^ — is the Husainiyah. Canal^ running from Musaiyib to Karbala Town and beyond.

The characteristic tribes o£ the part of country adjoining the Fusaini- yah canal are the A1 Bu Masri, Mas'ud and Yasar; those o£ the Musaiyib neighbourhood are the Janabiyin, A1 Bu Mahaiyi and ; Uwaisat. The desert round Shifathah is occupied by nomads of the Khawadhir and A1 Bu Shibil tribes. j P optildtiou.—Karbala Town (50,000), Musaiyib (4,500), and Shifathah (8,000) being included, the fixed population of the Karbala Qadha is believed to amount to 80,000 souls. The great majority of these are Shi^ah Muhammadans; but Sunni Muhammadans number about 10,000 and there are about 300 Jews. Uesources. —The rural population, including the inhabitants of Shifathah, are altogether engaged in agricultural and pastoral occupa tions. Fates, wheat, barley, cotton, opium and tobacco are cultivated by them ; and their livestock include horses, cattle, buffaloes and sheep.KAEBALA TOWN 975 The date palms of the Qadha are estimated at 750,000 trees, of which some 50,000 belong to the rich settlement of Sllifathall. There is in this Qadha a remarkable salt-field which is said to yield about 500 tons English of salt every year. It begins on the west side of Razazah and passing to the north-east of Shifathah is said to reach for many miles to the north-westwards : it is described as a great hollow with broken, rocky banks resembling the bed of a dried-up sea. The hollow is said to contain water which in summer partly evaporates leavino* masses of crystalline salt along the margin.' In consequence of its position and extent the Turkish Government are unable to make efficient arrangements for the prevention of smuggling. Adminutration.—Cont&amp;mmg as it does the town of Karbala, the headquarters of the whole Sanjaq, the Qadha has no separate Qaim- Maqam and is subject to the personal rule of the Mutasarrif, as is also its headquarters subdivision which consists chiefly of the town and is known as the Karbala Nahiyah. The other two Nahiyahs of the Qadha are Musaiyib and Shifathah, each governed by a Mudlr who is stationed at the place from which his charge derives its name : both of these are of the Ist class. The Dairat-as-Saniyah, as mentioned in the article on Musaiyib, is strongly established in the part of the Qadha to the east of the Euphrates ; it appears to be in possession of the whole Nasriyah tract referred to above in the present article. One of the chief towns of Turkish 'Iraq, renowned as the scene of the martyrdom, or rather massacre, of Husain and his companions,—an went to which it owes its alternative name of Mashhad Husain crwx and in virtue of which it has become one of the principal places of Shi'ah pilgrimage ; it is situated about 55 miles south-south west of Baghdad City and about 25 miles west-north-west of Hillah Town, Rarbala is known also by the name of Ghadhariyah and hy the old-fashioned appellation of Nainawa [j-uj . ^ Site and buildings. —The town stands on the left bank of the ;.| isamiyah canal, which circles round its northern and western sides. On the north, east and south it is surrounded by cultivated lands, date plan- f »fa'ons and gardens of fruit trees ; audits general shape and disposition KARBALA v TOWN976 KARBALA TOWN cannot be observe! from any point o£ view accessible to Europeans, ^ On the west the SMmiyall or Syrian Desert approaches almost to the walls. About 2 miles to the south-east of Karbala begins the Hor-al- Husainiyahj a marsh formed by the KuStliniysill canal and the Shatt-al- Eindiyah ; an embankment running- north and sonth for a distance of 6,000 metres is supposed to prevent the ingress of the waters of the Hindiyah, but this work is at present in a ruinous and inefficient state. Karbala consists of an old town on the north, still walled on the east, north and west^ but open on the south—the side on which the new town adjoins it: the old town is crowded and irregularly built, the new is well laid out, with a broad main street running north and south, and is by comparison clean. A mile or more to the south of the new town the large mansion of a Panjabi Indian family is conspicuous, standing in its own ^rounds and known as Afzal Khan^s Fort. The walls of the old town are of brick, between 20 and 30 feet high, with towers projecting at intervals as bastions ; there are two tiers of loopholes, and on the inside is a banquette supported by arches which affords standing room for the defenders of the upper tier. The perimeter of the walls is about 2 miles; they are pierced by 5 gates, and about 25 towers still remain; but the whole work is now in bad repair, and the arches on the inner side serve chiefly as dormitories for vagabonds and as latrines. The bridges connected with the town are described in the article on the Husainiyali canal. The site of the town is level; but the ground is somewhat higher towards the north-western comer. Inhabitants. —No close estimate of the population is possible; but it appears to amount to about 50,000 souls, not reckoning pilgrims and other visitors. At least three-fourths of the fixed population are Persians, and almost the whole of the remainder are Arabs. There are only about 100 Turks and 50 Jews, but Indians or persons of Indian extraction number about 1,200 souls, and there are a number of Baluchis. With the exception of a few hundred Sunnis, of the Jews already mentioned, and of about a dozen Christians, the people of Karbala are all Shi ah Muhammadans. The Persians who compose the bulk of the population are almost altogether Persian subjects, so also are the BaluchiS; but the rest are of Turkish nationality, except the Indians, who are nearly all British subjects, and about 30 Persian-speaking subjects of the Fussian Empire. In all there are about 9,000 dwellingKARBALA TOWN 977 houses; but they are not sufficient and the extension of the town 5 although constant, does not keep pace with the growth of the population. Drinkiug water is from the Husainiyah canal, or, in the months when it is dry, from some 20 or 25 wells, mostly sunk in its bed. Trade, manufactures, and Karbala is a place of consider able trade, the most valuable imports being piece-goods, sugar, petroleum, spices, coffee, tea, Persian carpets, and candles, almost entirely for local consumption ; while the leading exports are dates, consecrated articles — such as rosaries, praying-tablets, and inscribed shrouds—skins and hides, wool and tobacco. The bazaars are extensive and well-stocked, and attached to the main bazaar in the old town is a Qaisariyah or arcade, in which are about 20 good shops dealing in European and other wares. Filigree work and engraving upon mother-of-pearl are the only two arts', but all the ordinary trades are carried on with success, and even mechanical professions, such as watchmaking and photography, are exercised with a fair degree of skill. The agricultural and garden produce of the environs ]is large, and the output of dates is on such a scale as to leave a large balance for exportation. Karbala is not, however, a good centre for the collection of ordinary supplies or transport: there are no mules, and camels can only be procured in autumn when Bedouins of the ; Allizah an4 Sharnmar tribes are in the vicinity. Administration. —Karbala is the chief town and the headquarters of the administration, both civil and military, of the Karbala Sanjaq in the Wilayat of Baghdad : internally it is administered as a municipality. The Mutasarrif of the Sanjaq has his residence here, and there is a Mudir of the Sanitary department, also a Mamur of the Tobacco Regie. A whole Tabur of Dhabitiyahs is supposed to be located at Karbala, but it is rare that more than 100 of the force are present. There is a post office, and telegraphic connection is maintained with Baghdad and Basrah vid Hillah : a branch line of telegraph also connects Karbala with Najaf. One battalion of regular infantry is, as a rule, stationed at Karbala; hut it is partly scattered in detachments over the country, and the garrison of the town does not often exceed 340 men ; these, in a manner charac teristic of Turkish administration, are quartered in a hired caravansarai in the new town. There are also two muzzle-loading field guns but no cavalry. A reserve of 600 rifles is said to be maintained, probably for H978 KARBALA TOWN arming the Radifs inscribed at this and subordinate centres n the event of their being called out; the place is the headquarters of the 3rd batta lion of the 84th Radif regiment. The interests of British subjects, both residents and pilgrims, are watched over by a native Vice-Consul, and the Persian Government also maintain at Karbala a paid Karpardaz or consular official of some what similar rank. Religious importance. —We may now mention the holy places which are the sole cause of the existence of a large Persian city on the verge of the Shamiyah Desert at a distance of nearly 150 miles from the nearest part of the Persian frontier. The historical events with which thej are connected are related elsewhere : but for those events Karbala, which does not appear to have been a seat of pre-Islamic civilisation, might never have existed, even as a petty town. The chief shrines within the town are the tombs of Husain and 'Abbas and the Khaimahgah; in the country outside the walls are the tombs of 'Aun and Hurr, The shrine of Husain, called Bargah Hazrat Husain OjJia . stands in the old town towards its western end. The interior is not acces sible to Christians, but it is known to consist, in the first place, of a large j enclosure called the Sahn ^ or Outer Court; this enclosure has 7 entrances, the main one surmounted by a clock-tower, and the enceinte- wall is lined upon the inner side by no less than 53 arched recesses forming rooms, some of which are of considerable size. In the midst of the Sahn stands the Haram ^ or Sanctuary proper: it is a roofed building surmounted by a lofty dome of gilded tiles and its fayade, fiom either end of which shoots up a gilded minaret of great height, faces the mam entrance of the Sahn. A tile-work minaret, larger than those of Haram but not so magnificent, rises in the corner of the Sahn which is a the back of the Haram and behind its proper left; and near this comer is a small external Sahn adjoining the main Sahn to which it serves as an entrance. In the centre of the building, underneath the dome, lies e Imam Husain with his son'Ali Akbar on one side of him. e tombs of both have an outer cover of steel lattice-work overlaid with si ver and an inner one of carved wood; both, are of hexagonal shape. ® e . ^ a silver grating in one of the corners are the tombs of the 72 S u a a W 4 *, or so-called martyrs, who died with Husain. ^ The tomb of ; Abbas, half-brother of Husain, to the east of th Husain and so nearer to the middle of the town, is similar but s ig 7(St) KAEKHEH 979 L tbe (jygjl ^ ^ smaller and has a dome of glazed brick only; the minarets however are gilded. Each of these principal shrines has a treasury supposed to contain l f m ' 35 untold wealth: but, as the treasury of Husain was looted by the wepit Wahhabis in 1801 and is still admittedly the richer of the two, it does s * not seem that in either case the popular idea can be well founded. Such treasures as remain are, along with the other endowments, in charge of tlie Auqaf Department of the Turkish Government. Both buildings owe ^ their gold plating to the piety of Nadir Shah.

It forms the western limit of effective Persian juris diction as exercised from Dizful or Shustar: beyond it, within the hills ; is the autonomous district of Pusht-i-Kuh ; and in the plains, upon that side, are the locations of the Bani Turuf and other virtually independent tribes. In the middle ages the Karkheh was known as the Dujail of Basinna U ^ jj , from an important town which was then situated near it a short day's journey to the south of Shush. Course, —Near its exit from the hills the Karkheh was formerly spanned by a bridge, of which the remains still exist and are known as Pa-i-Pul Jj About 4 miles south of Pa-i-Pul the river passes the Sassanian ruins of Aiwan-i-Karkheh or Kasra which lie half a mile from its right bank ; and about 14 miles further on, the direction of the stream being now somewhat easterly as well as southerly, Shush, the site of the ancient Susa, is left 2 miles from the left bank. Aiwan-i- Karkheh was still in the 10th century A.D. a small but populous town with a weekly market. The Karkheh after this pursues a general south-south-easterly course to a place, about 50 miles from Shush and perhaps 20 miles north west of Nasiri on the Karun river, at which it swings suddenly to the south-west and from which it runs in that direction for about 20 miles; after turning this corner it passes between the hills which form the north-eastern border of the Hawizeh. District and the low range which is their prolongation and which crosses the Karun river at Ahwaz Village. This bend of the Karkheh to the south -westwards appears to be a recent feature : there is reason to think that the river formerly fell into the Karun a few miles below Ahwaz, and it is believed that at the present day this condition of affairs could be restored without difficulty by artificial means. At the end of the reach which goes south-westwards the Karkheh arrives at Kut Nahr Hashim in the Hawizell District,—the site, not long since, of a massive dam by which the whole irrigation of the Hawizeh. District was regulated. When this dam was in existence the further course of the river lay first southwards and then through Hawizell Town; but since the dam gave way, in 1837, the mainstream of the river has taken a north-westerly course from Nahr Hashim, and its waters, dissipated in streams and marshes, have submerged and ruined the country. At the western end of the Hawizell District the livei gradually reassembles its water, and finally, under the name of Suwaib or Shwaiyib , augmented by the overflow of some of theKARKHEH 981 marshes, it enters the Shatt-al -'Arab about 4 miles below Qurnah. Character of stream.—Ki its entrance into ^Arabistan the Karkhehis a broad and rapid stream of whitish water. Near Aiwan-i-Karkheh it is split into several branches by low islands. Further down it continues to be broad, and islands and banks in midstream remain frequent; nor does its level fall much below that of the surrounding country until near the point at which it turns in the direction of Hawizeh. It is crossed by shifting 1 and dangerous fords at Pa-i-Pul and Aiwan-i-Karkheh and near Shush. At Aiwan-i-Karkheh, 60 years ago, it was observed that the Karkheh appeared to be navigable for vessels of light draught; and in the autumn of 1841, when the stream was at its lowest, a small steamer ascended the Suwaib section for a distance of 10 miles. The waters of the upper Karkheh are celebrated for their purity ; but lower down the stream is contaminated by the stagnant swamps through which it passes. The volume of the Karkheh exceeds that of the Jarrahi Biver. Character of the banks. —The banks of the Karkheh are wooded with tamarisk jungle and small trees, and in places they are lined with dense brakes of cane-reeds and willow. A remarkable belt of scrubs known as Jangal-i-Gharabi , extends for a distance of about 50 miles between the Karkheh and Shaur rivers and has an average breadth of 4 or 5 miles j it begins above a place called Buq'eh-i-Ghaib Ibn-^Ali an d reaches to a locality called Gharaibeh which is in the country of the 'Anafijell. The lion and fallow deer^ formerly found here ; are now practically extinct; but wild boars, hyaenas, and small game abound, and considerable herds of gazelles frequent the plains on both banks of the river. Irrigation and villages. —The level of the Karkheh being, in the upper part of its course, but little below that of the surrounding country, its waters there are applied to irrigation on a considerable scale. Several of the more western villages of the Dizful District are watered by canals from the Karkheh^ notably Jirqeh Saiyid Ahmad, ^Amleh Karim Khan^ Jirqeh Saiyid Muhammad, Jirqeh Saiyid Ta^ameh, Jirqeh Saiyid Tahir ; and possibly Shuhan ; two or three of these are served ky a channel called the Harmushi which takes off from the left bank of the Karkheh near Pa-i-Pul. Near Shush, are the remains 0 f great canals, down which were probably floated the stone columns forKAEUN 982 KAEKHEH the Sassanian palace of Susa, brougM from the mountains of the Western Lur country. Above the point where it turns towards Hawizeh. the Karkheh throws off a number of canals still actually in operation. In the Hawizeh. District again it is said practically to dissolve into a network of canals. The whole way^from Pa-i-Pul to its junction with the Tigris the river flows through alluvial plains which are for the most part capable of irrigation; and the entire Karkheh region, though now almost a desert, is studded with the remains of human habitations and of irrigation works. The only village of importance now existing on or near the Karkhek above the point where it enters the Hawizeh. District appears to be Khairabad abT jxL ) which is on the left bank below Shush, perhaps not so far from that place as has hitherto been supposed, for one report makes the intervening distance only 8 miles * This place consists of about 80 houses and some tents ; 20 families are of the Al Bu llawayeh tribe, and the remainder are Bani Lam of the Al Baji section, Ikrish of the Daghaghleh section and Arabs of various other tribes. The inhabitants possess about 100 rifles, and of the fighting men 60 are mounted. Livestock are 200 camels, 100 cattle and 6,000 sheep and goats. A noted outlaw, Saiyid Na'ameh, who was released from imprisonment by the Shaikh of Muhammarell about 1905, has been established by him here under surveillance of Shaikh Parhan Asad of the Kathir. ^are 11 u r i ® tke I f ilaliali III from i llitlie t life ffestw The largest river of Persia and the only one navigable by steamers. It has its rise in the mountains of the Bakhtiyari country about 100 miles due west of Isfahan and enters the plains of 'Arablstan some 15 or 30 miles north of Shuslltar Town.

At 4 miles below Got wand the Karun leaves the village of Jallakan on its right bank, the plain of 'Aqili being still upon its left, and H miles further down it breaks through a range of pinldsh sandstone hills, which rise on the right bank to a height of only 200 or 300 feet, but on the left bank attain an elevation of about 1,000 : the portion of the range nearest to the river upon its eastern bank is Kuh-i-Fidalak. The villages mentioned are described in the article on the Dizful District and the plain of 'Aqili under its own name. Two and a half miles beyond the Kuh-i-Fidalak barrier and at about half a mile from the town of Shuslltar the river, which has since emerging from the hills preserved a generally north and south direction. swings to the westwards. About 600 yards above the town it divides into two streams, the Gargar to the east and the Karun proper to the west. On the north side of the town the Karun proper forms a broad sheet of water, and then, turning to the south and passing an ancient dam and a bridge known as the Pul -i-Dizful, it changes its name to Shatait* The Gargar and Shatait form the subjects of separate articles, and the island enclosed by these branches and called Miyanab is dealt with under its own name. At a point 30 miles south in a direct line from the town of Shuslltar the Gargar rejoins the Sliatait --the village of Band-i-Qir standing between them in the angle above their confluence,—and the Karun river once more resumes its course under its own name. At the point of junction of the Gargar and Shatait the Diz river, coming from the west, adds its waters to the Karun ; and from this place to Wais, 12 miles further down upon the left bank, the course of the river is straight and almost due southwards. From Wais to Ahwaz Village on the left bank, the direction of the river is on the average south-west; but it winds considerably, and the distance, which is only about 14 miles as the crow fiies ; is fully doubled in travelling by water.

A dry hollow, containing bushes at the end towards the Karun, connects the Blind Marid with the Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa; at one time, no doubt, the Karun isc aige a part of its waters by this route to the sea.

The length of the rapids is about 2,000 yards; they are reckoned to be five in number and the real obstacle to navigation is the second rapid from the top. At this place a reef runs out from the left bank, leaving between its point and the right bank a channel, only 100 yards wide, through which the water rushes with a fall of 1 in 50 : this channel is moreover broken up by rocky islets into two or three passages, of which the one adjoining the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. Both reef and islets carry masonry remains, those of a great irrigation barrage which here raised the surface of the river to the level of the surrounding country. t Above the rapids the river is 400 yards broad, between them in places as much as 700, and below them only 200 to 300; from head to tail the total loss of level is 1 foot with a high river and 7 or 8 feet with a low one. From Aliwaz to Muhammareh, a distance of over 100 miles by river, the Karun averages a quarter of a mile in width and flows through an open uncultivated country. The banks are generally low upon this part of its course, and in winter they are occupied by Arab encampments around which some slight and shifting cultivation takes place; but in summer, with the exception of the permanent villages mentioned below, they are totally deserted. The worst reach for steamers is the 20 miles immediately below Nasiri; vessels of only 3| feet draft sometimes have difficulty in navigating it during the low season and are even obliged to unload part of their cargo. Date groves commence on the right bank of the Karun at Qisbeh, 7 miles above Muhammarell Town j and in the final section between the u * steamer Assyria ' ascended the rapids successfully in 1842, and the steamer Shushan ' in iggQ. t This barrage was called the Sliadhurwan^ and it existed in the lOth century A.D. [vide Le Strange).986 KARtJN Bahmausllir and the Shatt-al -'Arab both banks carry fine plantations. Above Qisbeh as far as Band-i-Qir the banks are bare and desolate and devoid of wooding. There are ferries on the river at various places noted in the table below: no bridges however exist except the Pul-i-Bulaiti and the Pul-i- Dizful—the latter broken—both at Sliuslltar. Volume, current, and variations of stream.—^ minimum discharge of the Karun has been calculated at 10,000 cubic feet a second, and the flood discharge at 120,000 to 140,000. The average surface slope of the river below the Ahwaz rapids is about 6 inches in the mile; and the current varies from 4 or 6 knots in the season of floods to 2 knots between August and November. The Karuu, along with its affluents, is liable to more violent and irre gular changes of level thau the great rivers of Turkish Ira(|- In most places the difference between low and high river is ordinarily from 12 to 14 feet; but there is a difference of 24 feet between the lowest recorded reading in October 1901 and the highest in February 1903. The river is generally at its minimum from the middle of October to the end of Nov ember ; and the highest floods usually occur in March and April* but some times earlier. The influence of the sea tides is perceptible as far up the river as Isma'iliyeh, and lower down they canse a rise and fall of 4 to 5 feet; but no salt water ever enters the Karun. Irrigation. —The Karun is not at present ntilised for irrigation except on a petty scale, and that principally by means of water lifts upon the banks which are worked by animals. When the river is full it carries a brown silt and in its lower course runs flush with the banks; its water is at all times more or less discoloured. The silt does not, it is believed, ever exceed of volume and its fertilising value appears to be low. Districts and villages.—Ahove Band-i-Qir the course of the Kama in 'Arabistan lies in the Sliuslltar District; the fiver then enters e Ahwaz District, which it traverses. The next and last district upon e Karun is that of Mllliammarell which begins on the right bank imme ately above SaVeh, and on the left bank just above the ruined tombs a 5 Ali-ibn-al-Hnsain. . rl It The riverside villages from Sliusktar Town to Band-i-Q^ aie ^ with in the articles on the Gargar and Shatait; those from Ban 1 1 * These data depend on records kept by the river steaaiBrs.KARtTN 987 to Sab'eh are given in the table which follows below in the present article : the remainder will be fonnd in the articles on the Muhammareh.

Five headmen of the Karwan district receive annual subsidies aggregating Bs. 700 from the Indo-European Telegraph Department for the protection of the land line within their district. The district forms part of the chiefdom e Gaih. Generally pronounced Chathir; an important Arab tribe of North KATHIE, 'Arabistan. The Kathir occupy both banks of the Diz river, the Sa'ad being in places interspersed with them, from the limits o'Anafijeh up to a point 8 or 10 miles above Qal'eh 'Abdush Sbah; also the country in general between the Diz and the Karkheh rivers belongs to them. The majority are tent-dwelling nomads; but in the Dizffll District they are found in the villages of Qal'eh 'Abdush Shah, Jirqeh Saiyid Ahmad, Qal'eh Banut and Dih Nan. Some Kathir also are settled at 'Arab Hasan on the Shatait. The Kathir, unlike other Arab tribes of 'Arabistan such as the Bawiyeh, not only take Persian wives themselves, but are accustomed to give their daughters in marriage to Persians. The following is a statement of the divisions of the tribe Section. Subsection, Location. Fighting strength. R emarks.

This section takes one of its names from Manleh who is a brother of Shaikh Haidar: the other name is generally pronounced Charim or Jarim.

They are seated to pos sess 100 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. Besides the above, or perhaps included in them, are said to be a section called A1 Bu Nassi who live at Hiddeh or Haddameh on the Diz and have 300 rifles. The whole tribe may be estimated at 7,000 souls, of whom perhaps not more than ],000 have a fixed residence. The senior member o£ the Ma^alleh section formerly commanded the obedience of the whole tribe ; but at the present time two rival Shaikhs divide the Kathir between them. Shaikh Farhan Asad is followed by the Bait Karim subsection and part of the Dailam subsection and has his headquarters at Dih Nan ; the village of Qal'eh Banut also belongs to his party; and, outside of the Kathir, the Miyanab Arabs of ^Abdun Nabi on the Gargar, the Al Bu Hamdan and Mahamid sections of the Bait Sa'ad, the Bait Sa'ad of Saiyid Hasan on the Gargar, and indeed the Bait Sa ; ad generally, are his adherents. The remainder and great majority of the Kathir upon the upper Diz, obey Shaikh Haidar, to whom the village of QaFeh 'Abdush Shah belongs. Both chiefs are recognised by the Persian Grovernment, and the control of the country and tribesmen and the collection of revenue is left entirely in their hands; the total annual revenue demanded from the two is said to be 4,725 Tumans, for the greater part of which Shaikh Haidar is responsible. Shaikh I'arhan Asad cultivates the friendship of the Shaikh of Muhammareh and his sister is married to Karim Khan, Faili Lur of ^Amleh Karim £hjin; while Shaikh Haidar, whose daughter is married to a chief of the Sagwand Lurs and who has himself a Sagwand wife, is inclined to rely for support in difiiculties on the Sag wands and indirectly on the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. The relations of Shaikh Farhan Asad are with the Persian officials at Shushtar and those of Shaikh Haidar with the authorities at Dizful ; consequently the tribe may be regarded as divided between the two districts of Northern ' Arabistan. It is a remarkable fact that of the Shaikhs—who are distantly related to one another— neither really belongs to the Kathir tribe., but both ere of Bait Sa'ad extraction.998 KATHIR (AL) KATHIB. Singular Kathiri The principal tribe in Dhu^r Proper (AL) wliei . e a ii tll e villages eicept Taqa belong to them; they are represented in the Samhan hills also by several sections, who act as a partial counterpoise there to the uncivilised Qaras.

The Shanafirah are said to have been originally 'Awamir but they are now reckoned to the Al Kathir. Other sections, entirely Bedouin, are the Bait Bakhit -bin-Sahm (J 1 - ^ ^ the Bait-al-Hamar the Bait Jadad ^ and the Bait MasanKAUNAK 99: ^; of these the Bait Masan gave much trouble to the Sultan's Government between 1895 and 1897. Altogether the settled A1 Kathlr probably number about 2,500, and the nomadic about souls. The settled A1 Kathlr are agriculturists their resources are described in the article on Dhufar Proper. The nomad sections in the hills own camels and cattle and collect frankincense like the Qaras, whom in their arms, clothing and habits they very closely resemble, except that they arrange their hair in a top-knot instead of binding it with a fillet; their language is possibly a dialect of Arabic, but it is reported to be quite different from that spoken by the Bedouins of 'Oman and it has not as yet been properly investigated. Some of the Al Kathir Bedouins are almost jet black. The Al Kathir are a Hinawi tribe and claim to have immigrated from Hadhramaut some 3 centuries ago^ conquering Dhu fSr Proper and establishing a capita] at Dahariz : they are Ibadhis. There is constant friction between them and their Qara neighbours. A considerable village in the Dizful District of Northern 'Arabistan, situated about 16 miles south-east of Dizful and 22 miles north-west of ^ Shushtar on the route connecting those towns ; it is the ordinary halting place for travellers between the two places. Kaunak stands on the left bank of a stream of the same name, which is a left-bank affluent of the Diz river. The bed of the Kaunak stream at the village is usually a dry or nearly dry stretch of shingle about a mile across ; after moderate rain, liowever, there is a good flow of water in several distinct channels, and heavy rain renders it impassable for short periods. The village consists of about 100 mud houses ; it is not surrounded by a wall, as are most of the villages of the Dizful District. A caravansarai stands about 200 yards north of the place ; it is a mud-walled enclosure, but some of the interior buildings are of brick and there are a few small lodgings for better-class travellers in an upper storey. This building, along with the right to maintain 4 shops in Kaunak village, is held on lease by a private individual who pays 50 Tumans a year to the owner of the caravansarai and 20 to the Kadkhuda of the village. The only1000 kAunak defences of Kaunak are a couple of ^ upper-storeyed buildings in the village, whicli show a few loopholes, and a small mud tower with a timber roof. There are two water mills. The inhabitants of Kaunak are Bakhtiyaris and a few Dizfulis: there is one shopkeeper from Shushtar Town. The fighting strength fluctuates; at the best there are but 10 or 12 rifles, and in September 1904, when an attack by Dirakwand Lurs was expected, the place was almost deserted. Rice, Kunjid, Mash, wheat, barley, beans and cotton are cultivated on the village lands, which are irrigated from the Kaunak stream. A canal takes out of the stream a few hundred yards above the village, and beyond Kaunak it reaches a group of hamlets called Gumar which also it serves : there is a fair supply of water at all seasons of the year, but it is rather brackish. No transport is procurable at Kaunak except about 50 donkeys ; cattle number about 150, and sheep and goats about 600. There are four local shrines : the Imamzadeh of Bibi Qulklian close to the caravansarai ; a Qadamgah of Hazrat ' Abbas and another of Imam Riza, both on the south side of the village and close to it; and a Qadamgah, called Amir Wazir, half a mile from the village in the direction of Shushtar Town. These shrines are visited by the surrounding Arabs as well as by Dizfulis and Shushtaris. The revenue of Kaunak is paid into the Dizful treasury, With that of Gumar it amounts to 1,000 Tumans per annum for crops except rice; being assessed, it is said, at the rate of 2 Tumans a plough; half produce in kind is paid on account of rice cultivation.* A flour mill belonging to the village, which charges customers 1 Qran and 1 Dizfuli Man of flour on every 12 Dizfuli Mans ground, is assessed to revenue at 500 Tumans a year, Kaunak belongs to the Bakhtiyari Khans and to Agha 'Ali, Mustaufi, of Dizful.

The population of Khabrah is about 3,000 souls aud, tliougli tradition represents it as originally a settlement of the Qahtan, the present inhabitants are described as of ''Ajlizah. extraction : they are dull, ungracious and inhospitable. The majority live by agriculture, but many are camel-men. Dates, fruit and the ordinary cereals and vege tables of Qasim are grown on the town lauds by irrigation from wells 8 fathoms deep; the water of the town is sweet. The arable lands are in the bed of Wadi-ar -Rummah below those of Eass. A weekly market is held on Fridays. There are said to be 300 camels, a few donkeys and about 60 cattle, but no horses at this place. KHABURAB. a town on the Batinah coast in the Sultanate of 'Oman, almost midway between its two extremities being situated 19 miles south-east of Saham Town and miles north-west of Suwaiq. Wadi-al- Hawasinah reaches the coast here, passing by the eastern side of the Khaburah bazaar. The town consists entirely of huts ; but it is now larger than Sohar Town and the inhabitants may number 8,000 souls, of whom 6,000 are Hawasinah belonging, in part at least, to the Hawamid and SaWalim sections. There are also a few Qatait. About 25 families of Khojahs are settled here. Khaburah is the port of Wadi-al- Hawasinah and its tributaries and partially of Wadi ' Ahin ; aud 5 sea-going boats are o wned which run to Masqat with dates and to the ports of Trucial 'Oman. There are also 30 Shashahs and 15 small boats* Wheat is cultivated by irrigation from wells and there are 8,000 date trees : sheep and cattle are few and the only transport animals belong to visitors. The Sultan of 'Oman has a Wali at Khaburah supported by a detachment of 10'Askaris. The revenue is only about $2,000 a year, collected as Zakat, and of this the whole is expended on the local administration.

The nomads of the district, chiefly in Jiri, are either Na'im of the Khawatir section or Ghafalah. Agriculture and trade, —The agricultural resources of the district may be learned from the village and topographical tables in the articles upon the divisions of which it is composed. The trade of the district is concentrated at Eas-al-Khaimah Town, to the article on which reference may be made. ?.—The subject of routes is dealt with in the general article on Trucial ; 0man. -The Has-al-Khaimah district is at present governed by Khalid-bin-Saqar, the eldest and only surviving son of the Shaikh of Sharjah, as his father's deputy \ it brings in no surplus revenue, but the receipts, which are said to amount to Rs. 6 ; 300 from the pearling interest alone, cover the expenses of the administration. The only military force is a body of armed retainers maintained by the Deputy-Governor at Ras-al- Khaimah Town, which is his headquarters. The town of Dibah and village of Wamm, it should be noted, are at present exempt from the Deputy-Governor's jurisdiction and are held in fief by Rashid-bin-Majid, a first cousin of the Shaikh of Sharjah.; the feudatory personally resides at the place and is styled Wali of Dibah. This town, the capital of the district similarly named in the prin cipality of Sharjah., is situated on the coast of Trucial 'Oman about 48 miles north-east of Sharjah Town and 24 miles west-north-west of Dibah on the opposite side of the 'Oman Promontory. Site and harbour, —The town stands upon a narrow spit of land, 24 miles in length, which runs parallel to the coast and is connected with the mainland at its south-western end. The country in the vicinity of the town is low, flat and sandy. A dense grove of dates, mostly belonging to the tract called Sir, begins opposite the town and extends a considerable distance inland, continuing north wards as far as Rams; while a line of reddish sandhills, commencing a KHAIMAH (RAS-AL-) ^1; TOWN1008- KHAIMAH (RAS-AL-) TOWN little to the south-west of tie town, reaches B to Jazirat-al -Hamra and beyond. The creek enclosed between the spit and the mainland contains an uninhabited island called Qurmah ; and on the eastern side of the creek there formerly stood a village named Maharah , of which the deserted site, or its vicinity, is generally occupied by some colony of temporary visitors to Ras-al-Khaimah. At present such a settle ment, known as Ma'airidh and inhabited by Persians from Earns, etc., exists on this shore of the creek. Apart from the entrance at Ras-al-Khaimah town, tiie creek is connected with the sea by a backwater, 4 miles long, which has its opening on the coast H miles south of Rams. The creek forms an excellent and well sheltered anchorage for native boats ; but, though 9 feet deep inside, it has only 2 feet of water at the entrance at low tide: the approach, however, could probably be somewhat improved by dredging. The anchorage for large vessels is at sea, 24 to 3 miles north-west of the town, Defences, —A dilapidated wall crosses the isthmus to the south-west of the town, and there is a fort in the town itself. Neither is of any modern value. Inhabitants, —There are altogether about 1 ,000 houses in Ras-al- Khaimah, of which half are built of stone and gypsum mortar, while the remainder are huts of date leaves. The largest section of the inhabitant are a mongrel race, known as Ahl Ras-al-Khaimah ^ cUI, formed by the fusion of various Arab tribes; these may number 400 houses. The other main elements of the population are Maharah (250 houses), A1 'Ali (150 houses) and A1 Bu Mahair (120 houses). There are also a few Na^im of the Darawishah section of the A1 Bu Shamis division. In the town are found also 10 families of Baluchis from the Bashakard district of Persia who live by working in the date gardens of Sir. There are here no resident Hindu traders; but 3? Kojijahs, British subjects, are settled in the place. Resources. —Drinking water is scanty and indifferent. The date plantations belonging to the town are estimated to contain about 15,600 trees, and the inhabitants possess in addition livestock to the number of 20 horses, 130 camels, 175 donkeys, 150 cattle and 800 goats. About 33 pearl boats and 15 other sea-going vessels, of which 7 are Baghlahs and the rest Sambuks, belong to this port; 10 of the pearl boats belong to Ma'airidh and are of small size. There are also about 120 fishing boats.(psS? khalp A b A d 1009 Trade and manufactures.—^ trade resembles that of other places on the coast o£ Trucial 01X13,11.

Ras-al-Khaimah town is the seat of the Deputy Governor of the district of the same name. He is at present a son of the Shaikh of Sharjah and has under his orders a force of 70 'Askars or armed retainers to man the towers and otherwise defend the place if required. There are said to be several hundreds of rifles in the town also, the owners of which would participate in repelling an attack from outside. Singular Khalaifi .

Distribution. —The domains proper of the nomadic Bani Khalid are the northern portion of Habl down to the Habaiyah wells and the northern half of Biyadh ; when however, as at the present time, they are on good terms with the Ajmail, they make use of the southern parts also of these two tracts. They also roam in Kuwait territory, sometimes travelling as far north as Kuwait Town to obtain supplies, but the ^aqta' stream is their ordinary limit in this direction. Smninail, too, is visited by them. Permanent communities of Bani Khalid have for long existed on the islands of Musallamiyah, Jinnah and Tarut; and during the last few years two fixed villages of Bani Khalid have sprung up on the mainland, namely, Umm-as-Sahak in the Qatlf Oasis and Qasr A1 Subaih in Biyadh. The Bani Khalid are also represented at Jishshah and Kalabiyah in the Hasa Oasis and in the fixed villages of Wadi-al -Miyah ; and a few are permanently settled in Bahrain and some at Kuwait Town, while others pay regular annual visits to Anik in the Qatlf Oasis, and may be regarded as partially settled there. In Najd part of the inhabitants of Malham in ^Aridh, of Zilfiin Sadair, of 'Anaizah, Qnsaibah and possibly of Khabb and Qisai ; ah in Qasim, and of Quwar'iyah in the south-western desert are believed to be of Bani Khalid extraction; those at 'Anaizah bear a stronger resemblance to Bedouins than their fellow-citizens who are Bani Tamim. Religion, character and mode of life. —The Bani Khalid, unlike most of their neighbours, are Maliki and not Hanbali Sunnis. the difference is probably accounted for by their hereditary antagonism to the Wahhabis, from whom the Hanbalis are sometimes almost indistin guishable. The Bani Khalid are described as more dignified and formal in their intercourse with strangers than the other Bedouin tribes of Eastern Arabia ; and among themselves the share of the women in the social li e of the tribe is said to be more restricted. Their tents are larger than the ordinary Bedouin tent. The Bani Khalid are considered to be handsomer and of fairer complexion than the average Bedouin, and in geneial appea ance they resemble the settled Arab rather than the nomad. As a they are well dressed and ordinarily wear ^Abas : they are said to5 KHALlb (BANI) 101J a characteristic way of bringing down their kerchiefs so as partially to conceal their faces. They have some slight peculiarities of dialect. In the 3 hot weather months the Eedouins of the Bani Khalid descend to the coast and tend the date plantations which they own at various places in its vicinity ; during the rest of the year they roam in the interior. The principal occupations of the tribe as a whole are horso and cattle breeding and the cultivation of dates ; but those who are settled on the coast engage also in pearl diving and in the sea-fisheries.

The fighting strength of the Bani Khalid, exclnsive of divisions which have separated from them and become independent tribes, is thus about 4,000 men ; and the total number of souls in the tribe, subject to a similar deduction, may be roughly estimated at 14,000. History and present political position. —Less than 150 years ago the Bani Khalid were the paramount tribe of Eastern Arabia, and the extent of their territory at that time is marked by the fact that caravans between Baghdad and Aleppo used to suffer from their depredations. Their power was first broken by the W ahhabis in or before 1795, and in 1830 they were obliged to surrender the sovereignty of the Hasa Oasis to the Wahhabi Amn\ In 1874 the Turks attempted to govern the Hasa Sanjaq through one of the Bani Khalid chiefs, but the experiment Was a failure. The Bani Khalid are on bad terms with the Mutair and the 11 Morrah, and the recent establishment of the village of Qasr A1 Snbaih was intended to facilitate the prosecution of hostilities against those tribes. With the Turks the Bani Khalid are in somewhat close relations, and the non-nomadic portion of the tribe for the most part pay them a regular Zakat; but the allowances disbursed by the Porte to the tribe as a whole exceed the revenue which is recovered from the sedentary sections. The Shaikh of the A1 Khalid section is styled Mudir of the island of Musallamiyah and receives a monthly allowance of $30, which he shares (unofficially) with the Shaikh of the Al Razin; and the other headmen on the island are given annual presents of about $50 each. The Shaikh of the Al Shahin is similarly called Mudir of Jinnah island, and lie also receives an allowance from the Turks of $30 per mensem. The settled Bani Khalid of Qasr A1 Sub aih, however, appear to consider them selves independent of the Turks; and so apparently do the nomadic branches of the tribe unless when they are in the neighbourhood of Turkish posts./'—x KHlLID (BAN!) 1016 A valley in the Eastern Hajar district of tlie 'Oman Sultanate which^ KHALID beginning at the watershed between the coast and the interior at a point in- (WADI laud from Tiwi runs from north-west to p.outh-east down into Ja'alan.

On passing Sibt, which is said to be about 10 miles north of Kamil in Ja'alan, the Wadi emerges from the hills and enters the plain of Ja'alan. Wadi Bani Khalid contains running water ; the principal crops are wheat, barley, lucerne and dates. The palms are said to number 100^000 distributed among the villages. KHAMIE A large village situated on the coast of the Bastak district of Persia jX+L about 12 miles west-north-west of Laft on Qishm Island; mountains called Kuh-i-Khamir run east and west immediately on the north of it, Khamir is approached within half a mile by a creek, leading out of the Masakeh branch of Clarence Strait, which is navigable for native boats of 30 to 30 tons^ burden. Sweet water is contained in 17 large reservoirs and brackish water in a dozen wells. Hills called Kuh-i-Dum- dumdeh , one mile to the north-west of Khamir, yield lime; and 3 miles to the north-westward, in a spur of the higher mountains which is called Kuh-i-Magadan cm ** , are deposits of sulphur (in conjunction with gypsum) and a hot sulphurous spring. The spring is called Ah Bad •ik ^ and rises in a tank of masonry. On the east side of the place are date plantations, and in this direction at 3 miles from the village, is a wall in excellent repair which was built by Saiyid Sultan of Masqat during an ^Omani occupation. This ram part is known as Sidar , The only other defence is a fort with a high square tower, also in perfect preservation and built in the same circumstances. There are 2 or 3 shrines of merely local importance, also a fine mosque in which free instruction is given to the young. Khamir contains about 350 houses, and the total population may be 1,800 souls. The people, except a very few, are Sunnis and belong to various Arab tribes : they are chiefly engaged in navigation, fishing, date- growing, wood-cutting and lime-burning, and they own about 50 camels ; 30 donkeys and 300 cattle, sheep and goats. Their diet is of fish, dates and coarse barley bread, the commonest and most esteemed fish being a large sort of mullet. The shipping of Khamir consists of 4 Ghunchahs and ^2 Baqarahs, some of which run as far as Basrah and even to Indian ports. Exports are fish, lime in large quantities, mill-stones and a little sulphur, but the trade in sulphur has ceased to be remunerative underKHAMlS (AL) 1017 the expensive method o£ extraction employed*; firewood is also seut to the towns of Trucial 'Oman and to Bahrain. Khamir belongs properly to the Bastak district, bnt it is under the political supervision of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the local administration is carried on by a Kalantar appointed by the Mu'in-ut- Tnjjar of Tehran who is revenue lessee of Khamir and its dependencies : the present Kalantar is one of the hereditary Shaikhs of the town.

KHAMIS This is the name of the range which forms the termination eastwards (JABAL)* of the Eastern Hajar hills in the Sultanate of 'Oman; it begins imme- diately south of Sur and runs due soutk into Ja'alan, a distance of over 20 miles; its direction is thus at right angles to the mam axis of Eastern Hajar. t Jahal Khamis is parallel to Jabal Khadhar, the portion of Hajar which next adjoins it on the west ; and Wadi Falaij, the mam route from Sur to Ja'alan and Sharqiyah, descends to the coast between the two. The height of Jabal Khamis, which at 9 miles from the coast has an elevation of 2,84&amp; feet, increases apparently from north to south and attains 4,195 feet at a point ■ bout 25 miles from Sur j 4 oi 5^ miles bow-ever to the north of this point it falls to a col with an elevation of only 2,340 feet above the sea. This pass, called Najd-al-'Ayun a crossed by a route practicable for camels, which on the one side pleads down via 'Ain-al-Masharifah (16 miles) to Khor -al-Jaramall (30 miles) and on the other falls to Wadi Fisao and passes by Wadi Falaij to Sur ,- 'Ain-al-Masharifah has shallow wells of indifferent water , — .

In Wadi Muswa ^ and Wadi Fisao, the valleys which begin respectively from the east and west sides of the pass and in their tributaries, are outcrops of coal which were scientifically examined in 1901.* The mass of the Jabal Khamis range is composed of limestone, sandstone and shale. A village on the coast of Trucial ^Oniail, in the Sharjah Prin- KHAH cipality. It stands about 2 miles south-west of Sharjah Town on the north side of a small inlet called Khor-al-Khan with tvvo branches, one of which runs north-east and joins, or almost joins, at high tide the Sharjah backwater, while the other turns south behind Abu Hail. In passing be tween Sharjah and Khan the Sharjah creek must be crossed or a detour made so as to pass between it and the Khan creek. The land inshore of the village is for some distance low and swampy. Khan consists of: about 200 houses, the majority of stone set in gypsum mortar or mud, the rest huts of date branches. The inhabitants, who belong to the A1 Bu Mahair, Mazari' and Manasir tribes, are pearl divers and fishermen, owning about 74 pearl boats, but no other sea-going vessels. Their fishing boats number 40, and they also possess some 115 camels, 85 donkeys, 35 cattle and 170 goats. By Arabs called Kharij and in English formerly known as KHAUAGrt Karrack/' An island of some importance in the Persian Gulf; its i south-eastern point is 34 miles west-north-west of Bushehr Town, and 2^ miles north of it begins the smaller island of Khargu. Kharag is over 4 miles in length from north to south and its average breadth is about 2 miles. 1 he greater part of the island consists of barren, table-topped hills, which are highest in the middle of the island and at the south end where ttiey exceed 25 l ) feet; northwards they decrease in elevation and terminate ^ * See the reports by Dr. A. von Krafft and Mr. R. D. Oldbam, of the Indian eo ogi u ,l Survey, in the Proceedings of the Government of India in the Foreign apartment for August 1901 and August 1902. t A plan of Kharag Island is given as an inset to Admiralty Chart No. 2374-^2837 Persian Gulf.1020 KHARAa in cliffs only 20 to 30 feet high. The hills generally consist of a bed of soft sandstone or limestone overlain by a thin stratum of nearly horizontal calcareous breccia ; this upper stratum, where the supporting material has been eroded by weather, has collapsed in slabs and masses which convey a singular impression of ruin and desolation. The only low ground is a plain about one square mile in extent which forms a protuberance on the east side of the island and carries at its extremity the only village on the island and the remains of a Dutch fort. The island is surrounded by a reef about | a mile broad; the best anchorages and landings are off the village, but they are exposed, and the holding-ground is rocky and indifferent. Pearl banks occur between Kharag and Khargu and also on the west side of Kharag to a considerable distance from shore. There are a few wild gazelle in the hills of the island. The climate resembles that of Bahrain but is rather cooler in summer. The village consists of 120 houses and the inhabitants are partly recent settlers from Bahrain^ Minab; etc., and partly tribesmen who give con flicting accounts of their origin ; some of the latter speak a language which is said to resemble that of the Kumazirah section of the Shihtlh. About | of the people are Shr'ahs and the remainder are Sunnis. In character the Kharagis are quiet and unwarlike, but they possess a few Martini rifles. They are mostly pearl-divers and pilots, but a little agriculture is carried on; there are 1,500 date trees and some wheat and barley are grown. Irrigation is partly from springs, of which there are four large and three small, and some old Qanats exist; there are also wells of good water close to the beachj and on these the supply of water for drinking principally depends. The inhabitants possess 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and 150 sheep and goats. Provisions however are mostly imported from Bushehr. The earnings of the Kharag pilots are considerable; they are employed by steamers proceeding to Basrah and Es. 140 is paid as pilotage for the voyage and return voyage. The people of Kharag also visit the Arabian coast for pearl-diving, and since 1901 pearling opera tions have been prosecuted with success on the reef of the island itself. The number of divers on the Kharag reef continued increasing until 1903, in which year Kharag pearls to the value of Ks. 12,500 were sold to Bahrain merchants : in 1904 however the value of the take declined to half of what it was in the previous year. The Kharag pearls are said to excel those from the banks about Bahrain in colour and lustre. The only sea-going vessel belonging to Kharag is one Kutiyah, but there are about 90 fishing boats of the Baqarah, Shu^ai and jolly-boat patterns; and about 40 boats are used for pearling.KHARFAH 10 2 1 The island is subject to the Khan of the Hay at Davud who is represented on the spot by a deputy, at present his own cousin Mirza Husain Khan. Taxation appears to be heavy. It is reported that a poll-tax of 2 Tumans a year is levied by the Khan on every male adult, besides which he takes the greater part of the pilotage fees and ^th of the pearls obtained locally by divers. The Persian Imperial Customs have recently posted an official of the department on Kharag. No import duties are at present collectedj but exports are taxed in the same manner as elsewhere. In the interior of the island are some caves * which are possibly prehis toric places of sepulture. They were originally divided into recesses by thin partitions of living rock which were grooved for the reception of 4 tiers of shelves, but they are now used as cattle-pens and the old work- manship is much defaced. A Muhammadan shrine of Mir Muhammad, also in the middle of the island, appears to have been in existence for more than 600 years and is still a place of pilgrimage. Kharag in the 13th century A.D. was a place of call for ships between Basrah and Qais and was then already celebrated for its pearl fishery.f Aconsiderable village in the Aflaj district of Southern Najd with KHARFAH one or two small hamlets and a number of detached Qasrs dependent on it; it is situated about the middle of the district, 3 miles north of Baudhahand 5 or 6 miles south-south-west of Lailah. Kharfah with its Qasrs comprises about 100 houses of Dawasir of the Ghaiyithat section and 50 of Bani Kliadllir ; of the whole about two-thirds are con tained in the main village which is known as Hillah or Qil'ah. The lands of Kharfah are said to be about 1| square miles in extent and to form a compact block ; the date palms are estimated at 5,000 only and there are no other fruit trees. Wheat and barley and a little millet aie S'own, also melons and lucerne; the wells are 7 to 8 ms deep.

Khargu is barren and uninhabited. KHAEJ A district of the Wahhabi dominions or Southern Najd; it is adjoined by ^Aridh on the north and by Hariq and Hautah on the west; on the other sides it is enclosed by deserts. It is understood to extend about 40 miles from north to soath and the same from east to west. * A plan of Khargu will be fonnd in Chart No. 2374—2837-B, Persian Gulf, where it is given as an inset,fotsrj KHARJ 1028 PJiysicttl chttVCLctsvistics, -Kharj a sandy plain without any remark able physical features. Ihe Sahabah. tract on the north-east is closely connected with Kharj, but should probably be regarded as distinct. On the east side Kharj passes into a sandy and at times stony country called Maraghah on the south it shades off into a bare sandy desert known as Dahi J** ; on the west it is divided from Hautah. by Saut a stretch of low flat country containing tamarisk and acacia trees. The drainage of the Hautah and Hariq districts is brought to Dilam in Kharj by a hollow (Wadi Braik) which has its beginning at Hautah towu ; or even further away, to the west-south-west; and the Sha'ib 'Alaiyah reaches from the eastern face of Jabal ^Alaiyah to the village of Yamamah in Kharj: on the other hand Wadi Hanifah, though it approaelies the district from the north, is dissipated in Sahclbah and does not enter Kharj. There is one flowing stream in the district, that of Parzan, which rises on the west side of the Kharj villages and after making its way across some miles of sandy country is utilised for the irrigation of crops. The air of Kharj is described as healthy and refreshing.'^ Topography, population and resources, —The following table contains some particulars of the principal places in Kharj ; — Name.

This village benefits to some ex tent by the Farzan stream and its own wells are only 6 fathoms deep. The chief__ Shaikh is of the 'Aid tribe. There are large date plantations, and the usual fruits, cereals, melons and lucerne are grown. Live stock are said to amount to 300 camels, 80 donkeys, and 200 cattle, ex clusive of sheep and goats, but there are no horses. The vil lage is partially irrigated from the Farzan stream and for the rest depends on its own wells, 6 fathoms in depth. As at Sulaimlyah, the headman of the village belongs to the 'Aid tribe.

In point of fertility Kharj ranks high among the districts of Southern Najd. The water level is only 6 to 8 fathoms below the surface, and dates and cereals are produced in large quantities ; among fruits other than dates are grapes, lemons, pomegranates, and figs; lucerne and melons are also included among the products of Kharj, Domestic animals are camels, donkeys, horned cattle, and sheep and goats ; but horses, unless belonging to Ibn Sa'ud or the Bedouins, are hardly seen in the district. Such trade as exists is concentrated in Dilam town. Communications. —The ordinary route from Kharj to Hasa leaves the district at Yamamah and, skirting the SaMbah tract which is on the right hand, falls into the Riyadh-Hofuf route at Tarabi or Abu Jifan. The distance from Yamamah to Abu Jifan is stated at 3 days by caravan. Administration. —'As explained in the article on Dilam^ the Wahhabi Amir at present governs Kharj through an official without local connections who is stationed at Dilam and occupies a fort within the walls. Taxes are collected from the nomadic as well as from the sedentary population of the district. KHARMAH A tract in tlie Sal W oi ^ asa i mmediatel y to the soutl1 of tlie 0asis of the same name; it is bounded on the north by the Oasis, on the west by Gliuwar, and on the other two sides by Jafurah. The length of | Kharmah from north to south is about 40 miles, and it tapers from about 30 miles in breadth at its northern end to about 15 at its southern extremity; the loss of breadth appears to be chiefly upon the east side. Jabal Arba' is situated on the border between this tract and the Hasa Oasis. The principal feature of Kharmah is a hill named Jabal Kharmah, which is situated in the middle of the tract at about 30 miles from its northern end. The soil of Kharmah is a light red sand and the ^ general level is higher than that of the Hasa Oasis. Water is found in a few places only but depressions contain Hamdh, Eimth and Thamam1028 KHARtTS (WADI BANT] Ba tin all it is call 3d Wadi-al-Qasim from tlie fact, it ig said, that in the time of Saiyid Sa^id II (1807-56) it was the frontier between the Snltan of 'Oman and the territory of the theu independent Yal Sa'ad tribe.

The trade of Wadi Kharus is partly with Barkah and partly with Masna'all.1030 KHASAB KHASAB* In Euglisli iormeiiy known as Kassaab,^ A smalltown on the coast of the* 'Oman Sultanate^ the capital of the Bani Hadiyah section of the Shihuil tribe,, situated on the sonth side of a great bay which forms the approach to Khor-ash-Sham on the western coast of the Ruus-al-Jibal district. It stands npon a sandy beach nearly a mile long and is surrounded by date groves^ which extend some distance up a wide valley, called Sal'alah behind the town ; these plantations belong partly to Shiliull of other places in the Ruus-al-Jibal district. At the back of the groves there is some cultivation of wheat and vegetables. Landing at Khasab is difficult at low water even from small boats. The only defences are a fort in the centre of the date plantations and two or three small towers near the sea. Good fresh water is obtained from wells 30 to 60 feet deep^ and, being abundant, it is applied to irrigation: wood, cattle and vegetables are obtainable. The town consists of about 300 houses of Shihuh, besides which there is a bazaar of 10 shops. The fixed inhabitants nearly all belong to the Bani Hadiyah section of the Shihuh, but a few are of the Bani Shatair section : of the former about 300 persons are of the Bayadir or field labourer class. There is also a floating population, especially in the date season, when people flock in from the country round and from Hanjam, Sharjah ^nd Dibal and camp in mat huts which they erect on the broad level in front of the town. The inhabitants own six sea-going boats which run to Dibai, Lingeh and the Batinah coast; they have no pearl-boats of their own, but some of them go to the pearl-banks in boats belonging to Dibai. They depend chiefly on their own cultivation of dates and wheat and upon fishing. The Sultan of 'Oman maintains a Wali here, who has 15 ; Askaris under his orders and is understood to collect §600 a year as Zakat. The present Sultan (Saiyid Faisal) has assigned to this official a date plantation and land at Khasab worth $1,000 a year from his own private estate, and out of this and the Zakat the Wali pays his own salary and defrays all other expenses ; he makes no remittances to Masqat and receives none thence. His functions mostly relate to visitors and strangers; with the affairs of the permanent Shihhi inhabitants he seems to occupy himself little, but he acts as an arbitrator when requested to do so. * A view of Khasah will be found at page 112 of Goldsm^'s Telegraph and Travel t@) KHASlB (ABUL) 1031 An important island belonging to the right bank of the Sbatt-al- KHASASIP ; Arab ; it subtends the tracts of Baljamyah, Faiyadbi, Zain and Mutawa' (UMM-AL-) upon that bank in whole or in part, and from its upper end near Sham- v — shamiyah island to the other which is a little below the mouth of the Karun it measures 5 miles ; its average breadth is less than ^ a mile, The island contains 2 villages; of which the larger is called Umm-al- Kliasasif; this one is situated on the south shore of the island about 1 mile from the western end and is inhabited by about 2,000 souls of the so- called Shaikh Hasan and other tribes. Umm-al-Khasasif village is well built and is laid oat in 4 broad parallel streets : its resources are esti mated at 20,000 date palms, 400 cattle, 3G0 sheep and goats, 10 horses and 20 donkeys. On the north side of the island near its eastern end is a ttj smaller village known as Umm-ar-Rasas ^ j it is said to possess 250 inhabitants of the so-styled Shaikh Hasan tribe, who own 7^00 date trees, 30 cattle, 30 sheep and goats and 4 horses. In the channel between Umm-al-Khasasif island and the right bank of the river lie two smaller islands ; the upper of these, Rumhailah , is between the western end of Umm-al-Khasasif and the shore of Baljaniyah and about J of a mile west-south-west of Umm-al-Khasasif w village; while the other, known as Umm-al-Yababi , is situated between the central part of the main island and the coast of the Faiyadhi tract. Rumhailah; which is of recent formation, is about 5 of a mile long by 100 yards broad : it has about 20 inhabitants of the Shaikh Hasan, whose whole property is comprised in a score of date trees, a similar number of goats and sheep and half-a-dozen cattle. Umm-al-Yababi, which is disposed so as to form a continuation of Rumhailah and is divided from it by a short interval only, is inhabited by about 100 souls of the Shaikh Hasan, who have 1,000 date palms, 10 cattle, and 25 sheep and goats. The main island of Umm-al-Khasasif is owned partly by the Shaikh of Muhammarell and partly by the family of the Naqib of Basrah.. It may be added here that the lower part of Umm-al-Khasasif has been thrown up since 1836, in which year the main channel was apparently upon the Turkish (and not as now upon the Persian) side of the island, Umm-al-Khasasif is Turkish territory. Also called Abul Ghasib ^^1 jj). Aconsiderable town in Turkish 'Iraq KHASIB 011 so nth side of the Shatt-al-'' Arab, about midway between Basrah. (ABUL) ail d Muhammareh but slightly nearer to the latter ; it is situated 2 w jf l1052 KHASlB (ABUL) miles up a creek o£ wliicli the month upon the river 'is 1 mile below Labani and which communicates inland with the creek of Abu Mughairah. Abul Khasib is said to have been named after a freedman of the Khalifah Mansur : in the middle of the 9th century of the Christian era it was a stronghold of the Zanj rebels. The town is divided into two quarters standing on opposite sides of the creek; that on the east is known as Bab Sultan &gt; and that on the west as Bab Sulaiman • The inhabitants number about 12,000 souls and belong to various tribes, including Bani Malik of the Bani Nahd section ; one of the chief residents is Shaikh Ibrahim- bin-'Abdul Wahad, who occupies a well-built house above the town; he has lived at Bombay and can speak Hindustani. The agricultural resources of the place are estimated at 400,000 palms, and livestock at 1,000 cattle, 3,000 sheep and goats, 300 horses, 500 donkeys and 50 camels. Each quarter of the town contains a large bazaar, in which European goods are exposed for sale. Abul Khasib is a centre of great activity in the date season, and the annual meeting between date growers and exporters, held early in September to fix the prices for the season, sometimes takes place here. The town is the seat of the Mudir of the Abul Khasib Nahiyah in the Qadha of Basrah^ and at the entrance of the Abul Khasib creek are a Turkish police post and customs house; nevertheless much smuggling of goods to and from Persia is carried on here. A harbour master is stationed at Abul Khasib- Also called Khatam Al Bu Shamis. A tract dividing the region of Dhafrah on the west from that part of Trucial ^Oinan which is some times called ''Oman-ash-Shamali on the north-east. Khatam is appa rently a compact district of somewhat circular shape with an average diameter of about 40 miles; its centre appears to lie 65 or 70 miles south-east by east of Abu Dhabi town and 45 miles south-west of the Baraiml Oasis. Khatam is covered with sand du nes, but it bears some Ghaf trees, besides shrubs of Abal, Arta, Markh and Ghadha. There are a number of wells, generally varying in depth from 1 to *2 fathom^ some of which contain good and the others indifferent water. Khatam appears to be a meeting ground of the Bedouins of the Bani Yas, Manasir, and Nairn tribes; and it may perhaps be regarded, at the1034 KHOJAH SECT KHOJAH The headquarters of the Khojah sect in the Persian Gulf are in the Sultanate of ^Oman, chiefly at Matrah, where they number about 1 ; 050 SECT* souls; but they are found also at Khaburah (1^5 souls), Sohar Town, Suwaiq (30 souls), Barkah and Masna'ah, in Batinah; at Quryat (l family); and at Gwadar, where they number about 300 souls. A considerable number live in the coast towns of Trucial ; 0man and Persia. The entire Khojah community of Matrah reside in a large fort or enclosed quarter upon the sea beach; security from attack by the Arabs and privacy for their women are the principal motives of this arrangement, and, except menials, the only non-Khojahs admitted to the enclosure are the British officials at Masqat, whom they regard as their natural protectors. The Khojahs of Matrah marry, for the most part, among themselves. Only about 10 families of those at Matrah are now adherents of the Agha Khan of Bombay; the remainder have been converted to Thain 'Ashari Shi'ism, but preserve to some extent their old social usages and customs. The majority of the Matrah Khojahs are petty merchants and shop keepers dealing in piece-goods, spices, etc. Only about I?- of them do business on a large scale, but there are seven or eight others who some times receive small consignments of goods on their own account. The business of the large Khojah merchants at Mat rah consists in the importation of rice from Calcutta and of piece-goods, oil and drugs from Bombay, and in the exportation to India of dates, both wet and dry, and of a small quantity of dried fish (Matut). Some land in the Masqat District has been acquired by Khojahs, particularly at Birain, at Darsait near Matrah, and at Ghallah in Wadi Boshar, The Matrah Khojahs are mostly of Sindi or Kachi extraction, but very few of them now have homes in India, and of 250 male adult? only about 120 are British subjects, those, namely, whose ancestors immigrated after the British conquest of Sind. Of 41 families of Khojahs in other parts of the 'Oman Sultanate except Gwadar, 29 are under British protection and 12 are Arab subjects ; those of Gwadar^ are comparatively recent immigrants and all claim British nationality. In the ports of Persia and Trucial 'Oman the Khojahs are all regarded as British subjects. In the Sultanate of ''Oman the Khojahs are known to the Arabs * Information about the Khdjahs is contained in the Government of India s Foieign Proceedings for May 1905. See aUo the Gazetteer Appendix on Beligions.KIBlSAH 1035 as Lawatiyah * Ax&gt;'y,and in the Persian Gulf they are called Lutiyan ; the singular in either ease is Lutiyah *juy. They are also commonly spoken of as Haidarabadis . The principal town of the Dashti district on the Persian Coast; KHURMtJJ situated at an elevation of 465 feet at the foot of the great maritime range, distant 40 miles south-east from Bushehr Town, 17 miles south-south-east of Ahrani; the capital of the adjoining Tangistan district, and nearly 20 miles from the sea. The present town is adjoined by traces of an older one which was destroyed by the Persian Governor of Shiraz at the beginning of the 19th century. The place, which has doubled in size during the last 40 years, consists of about 350 houses, of which i are mat huts and the remainder of mud and stone. The population, numbering about 1,800 souls, are chiefly Khajaha, Dehdarha, ''Umruha and Dabashiha: nearly all are Persians and Shi^ahs; very few are Arabs. On the outskirts of the town is a substantia] stone fort, the residence of the Khan of Dashti, which internally, in 1865, was comfortable and elegantly furnished. There are water-mills driven by a small stream from the high hills behind the town, and water for irrigation is brought from the same quarter in open channels. The water is good and grazing excellent. Barley and wheat are plentiful, and mutton and beef are procurable, though not in large quantities. Date palms in the immediate neighbourhood are estimated at 50,000 trees, and livestock at 200 horses, 20 mules, 500 donkeys, 1,000 camels, 500 cattle and 8,000 sheep and goats : in these figures a number of the surrounding villages may be included. Routes from Bushehr Town, Kaki and the sea-coast meet at Khurmuj. Singular Kibaisi • A small and rather unsettled tribe of Arabs, found chiefly in Qatar^ but represented also in Bahrain. Their principal settlements at the present day are Khuwair Hassan and Fuwairat in Qatar, where they have about 80 and 50 houses respect- ively; besides these they have a few houses at Hadiyah and Sumaismah * A. derivation of this name has been suggested frorn lota, the Indian water-vessel, ^hlch(it is said) they used to carry when they first arrived in the country. Another 's from uy ) a gcamp, used In a good-natured sense. The Khojahs never call them selves Lawatiyah, and they dislike the name^ KIBISAHKIBlSAH in Qatar, and at Jasairah and Rifa'-al-Gharbi on Bahrain Island, Their chief occupation is pearl diving; but those of Qatar also own camels sheep; donkeys and cattle ; with which they retire into the interior of the peninsula in the cold weather; in summer they leave their animals to the care of local Bedouins and betake themselves to the pearl fisheries. In religion the Kibisah are Maliki Sunnis. The tribe once lived mostly at Dohall, but they were compelled by a difficulty with the 'Amamarah to remove to Khuwair Hassan. Later they took part with the Na/im in the foundation of Zubarah, but after a time they returned to Khuwair Hassan, which is still their headquarters. A considerable village in Turkish ''Iraq, situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al -Hindiyah : it lies about 18 miles south-south-west of Hillah Town and 1 6 or 17 miles north by east of the town of Najaf. Kifl is surrounded on 3 sides by creeks from the river, which are not often more than 4 or 5 feet deep; but they extend in some cases for a number of miles. When the Hindiyah. rises in winter the village is surrounded by floods ; it is then connected with the mainland only by a winding embankment about 3 feet broad and J of a mile long. There are a good many date trees in the immediate neighbourhood. Kifl consists of about 7 0 houses of masonry and of a much larger number of poor constructions in mud and matting. The population of the place is estimated at nearly 2,000 souls, of whom|about 200 are Jews and the remainder Arabs. The village is filthy and the people are poor. There are a couple of small and inferior Khans at Kifi: the better of the two is double-storeyed and was built by a private individual for the gratuitous accommodation of pilgrims passing by water between the towns of Karbala and Najaf. The most striking architectural object at Kifl, however, is a solitary minaret, believed to have formed part of a mosque which has now disappeared ; it affords an excellent landmark to all the country side, becoming visible on the way to Kifl a few miles after leaving Najaf Town, but it is now in an insecure state and its days of usefulness appear to be numbered. The sole claim of Kifl to importance is founded on its possession tomb of Hizqil J or Ezekiel; this shrine stands in the middle of the village, in a courtyard surrounded by a wall, the cells and recesses on the inner side of which ^vei the duelling place of most of the Jews of Kifl. The building is extremely simple and at present it is in a bad state of repair. The supposed coffin of the prophet, covered with common cloth, is about 1% feet in length by 6 feet wide and 5 feet deep ; it is kept in a room which is 36 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a domed roof. The walls of the room are ornamented with pieces of inferior mirror glass and other bright coloured objects,—decorations attributed to the muni ficence of a Jewish merchant of Bombay, by whom the tomb is said to have been restored about 65 years ago. Jewish pilgrimages are made to this shrine, especially at the time of Pentecost; and many Jewish corpses are sent to Kifl from a distance for interment. A family of Mnhammadan Arabs are the custodians of the tomb and receive whatever is paid by pilgrims. There is some cultivation around Kifl,—chiefly on the further side of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, which is here about 200 yards broad. Trade, chiefly with Hillah Town and Tawairij, is unimportant; but there is a bazaar about 150 yards long by 10 yards wide. Kifi is the headquarters of a Nahiyah in the Qadha of Hindiyah and the seat of a Mudir, who has a few Dhabitiyahs under his orders. The present Mudir is of Afghan descent and can speak a little Hindustani. There is a government primary school at Kifl, in which Arabic and Turkish are taught. A low, white, sandy islet in the Persian Gulf, situated in latitude KUBBAR ^9°4/north and longitude 48° 30 7 east: it lies about 20 miles off the ^ coast of Kuwait, 30 miles south-east of Ras-al-Ardh and 24 miles north-west of the island of Qaru. Its diameter is about a quarter of a mile, and its height above sea level is 8 feet. A few birds from the mainland Sequent it, but there is ordinarily no fresh water except after rain, Kubbar is reckoned to the Kuwait Principality. A town in Turkish 'Iraq ; it stands on the right bank of the Shatt- KlJl^AH a l-Hindiyah at a distance of 6 miles eastwards, by road, from Najaf lown. The original Kufah, founded about 638 A.D., was in early Islamic times among the most famous of cities, and under the 'Omaiyids1038 KtJFAH shared 'witli Basrah the honour of being one of the 'Iraqan^ that is, one of the twin capitals of 'Iraq; but it subsequently declined and disappeared ; the modern town is not more than 20 years old. The name is said to mean e( the (city of) reed huts. ,, l^he ancient Persian city of Hirah probably stood 2 or 8 miles tt) to the south of Kufah, and the battle of Qadisiyah which in 635 A.D. gave the province of 'Iraq to the rising Muhammadan power, appears to have been fought at a place in the desert about 15 miles west of Kufah; this Qadisiyah is not to be confounded with the place of the same name on the Tigris above Baghdad. In 'Abbasid times the Hajj route from Baghdad passed through Kufah. Kindly ah stream and bridge. —At Kufah the Hifldiyah stream is 150 yards broad and flows deepest in the neighbourhood of the right bank, where, at the present time, about 6 feet of water may be found in midwinter. At this place the Hindiyah is spanned by a bridge of 16 boats, each of which is 30feet long, 10 feet wide and 4 feet deep; the roadway is 8 feet wide, and there is a handrail about 3 feet high on each side from end to end. This bridge is now in bad repair. There is a small island 200 yards above and another 350 yards below the bridge; these are both wooded, and either would afford good cover or support to a bridging party. Quarter of a mile above the bridge the Hindiyah is nearly 300 yards wide. Town and population. —Kufah consists of about 600 houses, mostly of stone and mortar, and 100 occupied shops; its frontage on the river is 500 to 600 yards. The whole town is upon the western bank, bnt there is one private Khan on the opposite side about 50 yards above the bridge. The present population of Kufah is about 3,000 souls, of whom one-fourth may be Persians (including a few Persianised Baluchis) while the remainder are Shi'ah Arabs; but this estimate does not include residents of Najaf r Fown, who have houses or offices at Kufah and visit them often for pleasure or business. Resources.' —Kufah, always the port of Najaf, is now a general entrepot of trade and the distributing centre, for a wide tract of country, of goods brought by water from Basrah Town. On the river bank are numerous store houses and places of business, where the exports and imports of Hillah, Najaf and other places lie awaiting disposal. Kufah is surrounded on all sides by excellent date plantations, and there is muchEOT AH o-arden cultivation belonging to the place upon the left bank of the HindiyaL Fruit; vegetables and forage can be had in abundance at Ktifah in the proper seasons. Half a dozen to a doze n bafiuahs of medium size may be seen at anchor o ff the town, and such vessels can ordinarily be hired for a Majidi a day, but in the case of freight it is usual to charge by the journey and not by time. Administration. —Kufah is the headquarters of a Nahiyah in the Qadha of Najaf and is the seat of a Mudir. There is a military detachment for the protection of the place, consisting of 40 rifles unde r 1 officer. A harbour master also is stationed here. Antiquities,* —There are two sacred buildings at Kufah, which for many years were the sole remaining vestiges of the town. By far the more important of these is the great Kufah mosque, the scene of the assassination of 'Ali in 661 A.D, by 'Abdur Rahman- bin-Muljam ; it is situated about miles from the present Kufah, upon the way to N aj af. Externally this building resembles a fortified enclo sure ; for it has no dome and from the wall surrounding it, which is 30 feet high, small semi-circular bastions 10 feet in diameter project at inter vals of 50 feet. Inside, the mosque is like a caravansarai j the courtyard, which is 128 paces long and 104 paces wide, is surrounded on three sides by the cubicles usual in Khans ; but behind these cubicles, instead of the usual stables, are little rooms with doors, 63 in number and equally divided among the 3 sides. There are also 9 Maqams or Sardabs in the centre of the enclosure ; they are named after Noah, Zain-al-'Abidin, 'Ali and others, who used, it is said, to retire to them for meditation. On the fourth side of the courtyard, that towards Makkah, is the mosque proper ; and here, enclosed by iron gratings, is a space about 4 yards square paved with blue tiles to show where ^Ali fell. It may be noted that from early times there have been some Muhammadan authorities who have main tained that 'Ali is buried at Kufah., not at Najaf. The mosque is adjoined by 2 other well-built brick enclosures ; one of these, on the east side, has a wall about 20 feet high and contains^ besides a few huts, the tombs of Muslim-bin-'Aqil and Hani-bin-Amwah, which are both objects of veneration. To the north of the mosque, outside it, are 2 or 3 small Khans. Many pious Mullas of Najaf are in the habit of spending a night of each week in the old mosque at Kufah for quiet devotion. The other sacred place is the Maqam Yunas near the bank of the Hindiyah. at the upper end of the present town. It appeal's to beKUMAIT 1040 KtJFAH doubtful whether this shrine is intended to commemorate the m h Jonah or some other of the name. The style of Arabic writing known as Kufic had its origin here, In Turkish 'Iraq, a small but growing village on the right bank of the ^ Tigris 30 miles above 'Amarah Town, in the country of the Al Bu Daraj. The place was founded only 5 years ago, but there are now 50 or 60 houses and about 20 shops : the whole is the property of the Dairat-as- Sanlyah. The population is mixed. The village is a market for the surrounding tribes and exports wheat, barley and maize: there areas yet no trees. It is protected by a military detachment of 100 men under an officer and there are no civil officials. JMZAB A small town on the coast of the ^Oman Sultanate, the capital of the jjjof Bani Shatair section of the Shihuh tribe, situated at the bottom of a cove in the northern face of the Ruus-al-Jibal promontory ; it stands at the mouth of a gloomy valley or gorge in the hills which is named Wadi Marwani . There is no route by land from Kumzar to any other place. Kumzar consists of about 600 low stone houses of Shihuh of the Bani Shatair section: there are two large whitewashed mosques. The people are fishermen and have no cultivation of any sort; they own 40 or 50 fishing-boats and 5 sea-going boats that run to Qishm, Dibai and Masqat Town with cargoes of salt fish and shark- fins. Small quantities of dried and salted fish are exported also to Kuwait and Basrah. The Kumzaris have no pearl-boats of their own, but a few of them go to the banks on Sharjah and Dibai vessels. In the date season all but a very few persons migrate, mostly to Khasab and Dibah ; the women go to the date harvest there or elsewhere, the men to the date harvest or the pearl fishery, and the 3 or 4 individuals who remain take charge of the flocks of the absentees. KUNG A small town on the coast of the LillgBh. District in Persia; about 4 miles north-east of Lingeh Town ; it stands on a sandy shore along which3 T y-r KUNtTD 1041 it extends about half a mile. At the west end of the place is a large, white, ruined factory which once belonged to the Portuguese with a round fort opposite it that is surrounded by the sea at high water ; there are also many ruined water-reservoirs and the remains of some old docks. Behind the village is a large date grove and much ordinary cultivation. The anchorage, sheltered from all winds except the Suhaili, is 1| miles off-shore in 5 fathoms of water. Kung consists of 5C0 stone houses inhabited by a medley of races representing most parts of the Persian coast ;most of the people are Sunnis but a few are Shi'ahs. Kung, though evidently less important than it once was, and at the present time reduced by emigration to about half the size stated above, is still an active and busy place. The inhabitants are merchants, boat-owners Nakhudas, sailors, fishermen and potters. Here are owned 14 Baghlahs 1 Bum and 6 Sambuks which carry dates from Basrah and salt and small salt-fish from other places to Aden, Zanzibar and Indian ports; they also bring rafters from Zanzibar to Lingeh, Bahrain and Basrah. There are also 34 Baqarahs and 2 Shu'ais. The fishermen of the place are largely engaged in catching sharks and for this purpose visit grounds in the upper part of the Persian Gulf near Fao, etc. The water-supply, from wells 5 or 6 fathoms deep and from covered cisterns, is usually ample. Live stock aie 40 camels, 50 donkeys, 200 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats. A few arras are owned for self-defence; but the people are not addicted to fighting. There is an Imperial Customs post here. reli mgU ^ ai ' ^' nC ^ ^ sca ttered Ghafiri tribe of 'Oman, Ibadhis in KUNUD 40 f 11 ' are ^ oun ^ a t Nizwa in 'Oman Proper, where they have ) _ ouses an 't which may be regarded as their capital; also in Wadi ,a awal at ^ a khl (50 houses) and in Wadi-al-Jizi and its tributaries houi 4 ' 10uses ^ Milaiyinah (15 houses).

In Turkish 'Iraq the Kurds are mostly Eailiyah that is they belong to the Taili section of the tribe. They are most numerous on the Tigris, where Shaikh Sa'ad is an entirely Kurdish village, and more than half the inhabitants of Bghailall and Kut-ai-Amarah are Kurds; Kurdish communities are found also at suwairah and 'AH Gharbi upon the same river • and there are many Kurds at Baghdad where they are chiefly known as porters and labourers. Part of the population at Hai and Qal'at Sikr upon the Shatt-al- Gharaf are Kurds ; and Badrah and Jassan, which lie nearer to the Mils than do the places already mentioned, are predominantly Kurdish. The Kurds form one of the finest classes in the towns and villages of Turkish 'Iraq. They are a sturdy and capable race and are well represented in the army and military police; some of the regular battalions of the Baghdad Army Corps to a considerable extent consist of, and are officered by Kurds ; and Kurds have also been known to rise to posts requiring some intellectual ability, such as the judgeships of Shara'courts. The Kurd is said to be quick in revenge, and poverty sometimes drives him to crime; otherwise he is, at least in the plains of iurkish Iraq, a peaceable and law-abiding subject of the Ottoman Government- In 'Arabistan the Kurds, few in numbers and far removed from their tribal headquarters, are naturally not prominent as a political factor; but they are found in the Dizful District in the villages of Qal'eh 'Abdush Shah, A sad Khan (I), Balingan Balai, Biyawtiyun, Hajiabad, Jjbar, Kalehwand, 'Amleh Karim Khan, Khusrauabad, Kuwigh, Shalgahi Buzurg and Jirqeh Saiyid Ta'ameh; and they occur also, in the Shushtar District, at both Shalailis upon the Gargar. KURD (AL BU) This is the Arabic form of the name : in Persian it is Al Bu Kuidan ys jl . These are a small tribe settled on the Karun Rivei in the Ahwaz District, where they are found in the contiguous villages of Harsheh, Kut Abdullah, Kut Saiyid Salih, Abu Dibbis, Kut-al- Amaireh, and Muzaffari on the left bank, and at Karaishan on the opposite side. Their origin is not clearly ascertained, but it is state that they were formerly subjects of the Bakhtiyaris and remained sue until about 100 years ago, when they immigrated from the direction oKURIA MURIA ISLANDS the Eamuz and Jarrahi Districts to their present seat; at that time they were a body only 40 0 or 500 strong, whereas they now number 1,500 or 2,000 souls. At first they resembled Persians in their habits, but they have now adopted the Arab dress and have become dependents of the Bawiyeh. The Al Bu Kurd marry among themselves and are credited with being good fighting men. Their present headman, Mulla Abus Saiyid, represents the interests of the Shaikh of Muhanmiareh at Zaidan in Behbehan : in his absence his brother Ahmad presides over the tribesmen in the Karun villages and is at the same time the Shaikh's Agent at Muzaffari. This group of islands lies 25 miles oft the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman KURIA between Ras Sharbatat and Eas Nus and is consequently a little to the MURIA* east of Dhufar. The origin of the English name ' Kuria Muria' is unex- ISLANDS plained; the Arabs call the islands Jazair Bin-Ghalfan ^ a fter a Mahra family who once seized them and in 1835 still claimed the group as their property. The Kuria Murias are 5 in number and form a chain running for 50 miles due east and west. They are of granite and stand upon a granitic ledge, with very deep water immediately outside, which extends hence under the sea to Ras Nus and from there by land to Murbat, where it ends. During the north-eafct monsoon the islands are exposed to winds blowing from all points of the compass. The north wind sometimes lowers the temperature as much as 20° F. bringing it down to 50° and causing severe sickness. Hallamyah, the largest and central island of the group, is the only one inhabited; the people are reported to speak a dialect closely allied to that current in the neighbour hood of Murbat and resembling Mahri.

There are a few tamarisk trees and at the east end a little grass. The natural fauna are wild goats, whip-snakes, scorpions and centipedes. The human inhabitants num bered 23 in 1835 and 36, including children, in 1883. Their race is uncertain; nominally they are Muhammadans. They keep goats and fish but have no boats and hardly ever visit the mainland. Their houses are mere semi-circular walls of loose stones and are roofed with sticks, fish-bones and seaweed. When Hallaniyah was last visited in 190] it was found deserted. Suda 6 miles west of Hallaniyah. The second largest island of the group, 3 miles long by 2 broad. It is of red and grey gra^ nite with dark strata interposed and reaches a height of 1,310 feet. There is some scanty grass and a quickly filling but brackish well. The island is now uninhabited but is known to have had occupants at the begin ning of the 19th century. Haskiyah W 18 miles west of Hallanlyah. About a mile square and mostly com posed of reddish granite; the highest point is 500 feet. There is no vegetation or fresh water here but thousands of gannets frequent the rocks. The Kuria Murias belonged at the beginning of the 19th century to the Mahra family named Bin-Ghalfan, already mentioned, and both the larger islands of the group were then inhabited. Pirates from the coast of Trucial ^Oman made a cruel raid on the settlements about 1818 and left them practically depopulated. In 1854 the Sultan of ^Oman, who had meanwhile established a title to the group,, ceded the Kuria Muriaseit#' EtTT-AL-AMARAH QADHA 1 o 45 to Great Britain and they have since remained a British possession. Between 1857 and 1859 the islands were a scene of busy activityy as the ricii guano deposits of Jibliyah and Haskiyah^ since exhausted, were then being- worked; Jibliyah was the more productive. In the season 1857-8, no less than 52 ships were engaged in removing the guano, and a European agent and analyst resided on Jibliyah. The guano was found on the lower and more level parts of the islands and extensive tracts were covered with it to an average depth of 3, and an extreme depth of 6 feet • it was mixed with fine stones, necessitating screening before shipment and its chemical composition ^ differed widely from that of Peruvian g-uano, to which, however, it was hardly inferior in fertilising properties.

The town of Kut-al-Amarah is the seat of the local administration. In this district, as in many others, the Dairat-as Saniyah has obtained a footing by the acquisition of land. Sometimes called simply Kut, and not to be confounded with the town KUT-Alr of 'Amarah, the name of which is differently spelt () it is a small town and municipality in Turkish 'Iraq on the left bank of the Tigris ^TOWN opposite to the point where the Shatt-al-Gharaf goes off from its right bank; by river Kut is 140 to 145 miles above ^Amarah Town and ^20 to 225 miles below Baghdad. The town stands along the river bank and has one mosque with a minaret: it is connected with the opposite bank of the river by a boat bridge varying from 35 to 41 pontoons. The population is about 4,000 and mixed; a large proportion are Faili Kurds j the rest are Arabs of the Shfah persuasion with the exception of 100 Jews, who have a synagogue, and a handful of Christians. The surrounding country belongs to the Bani Rabi'ah. The inhabitants are mostly agriculturists, cattle breeders, dealers in grain and wool, brokers and shopkeepers ; but the Kurds are generally porters and carriers; the Jews, goldsmiths; the Christians, liquorice merchants. Trade is mostly with the Kurdish towns of Badrah and Jassan and is not important; but there are about 2.00 shops, 10 Khans and 8 cafes, also 2 wool-presses. There is a considerable export of liquorice, which grows plentifully in the neighbourhood^ and barley, wheat, oats, maize and Mash are cultivated in the vicinity. Woollen tu rugs or Haramat oU|^ and coarse carpets called Zull Jj are manufac tured, and the town has some good gardens and date plantations; but supplies and transport are both scarce. Kut-al-Amarah is the headquarters of the Qadha of the same name m the Sanjaq and Wilayat of Baghdad. There are a few police, and travelling passes are examined here; Kut boasts also of a post and telegraph office and of a custom-house: the Customs, Tobacco Eegie a ud Public Debt Departments are each represented by a Mamur, and there is a harbour master. There is no military garrison ; but the place is a ceil tre for reservists of the 2nd battalion of the 86th Radif regiment, and a uaajor and captain of the Radif are stationed here. The Dairat-as Sanijah have an agency for their steamers, and the Euphrates and Tigris1048 KtJT-AL-AMARAH TOWN Steam Navigation Company a coal depot, represents the Persian Government at this This name is the diminutive of Kufc and means a small fort: it sufficiently indicates the insignificant origin of the thriving town of Kuwait, the capital of the Arab Shaikhdom or principality which now shares its name. In old English records and books Kuwait is generally- called 'Graine ^ or a Grane ; v doubtless from the island of Qurain, ashort distance to the west of it. The town, which is about 80 miles south and slightly east of Basrah, almost 180 miles west by north of Bushehr and nearly 280 miles north-north-west of Bahrain, faces the north west and is situated on the southern shore of Kuwait Bay about one-third of the way from its entrance at Ras-al-Ardh to its foot at Jahrah. Coast, harlour and anchorages.* —The bay itself is a large inlet of re markable form, leading out of the north-west corner of the Persian Gulf, with an extreme length east and west of over 20 miles and a maximum breadth north and south of about 10 miles. In shape it approaches a crescent with the convex side to the north and one of the horns pointing to the south-west. The bay proper is an indentation in the true Arabian coast line, which is represented northwards by the western shore of Khor as -Sabiyail and southwards by the coast below Kas-al-Ardh; but its shore line is prolonged on the side next the mouth of the Shatt-al -^Aral) by a mud-fiat, extending 20 miles south-east from the mouth of Khor-as- Sabiyah, on which stands the island of Failakah. The entrance of the bay, between this mud«fiat and .Ras-al-Ardh, is about 4 miles wide and open to the south-west and south-south-west. In the southern shore of the bay, within, there are three coves; the easternmost, between Has-al- Ardh and Ras'Ajuzah is shallow and vessels are recommended not to enter it; the middle cove, between Eas ^Ajuzah and Ras ; Ashairij contains Kuwait Town on its eastern side, a dead coral reef covered with mud and sand and known as 'Akaz j &amp;c in the centre, the island of Qurain or Shuwaikh on the southern margin of ; Akaz, and the island of Umm-am Namal JJJI ^1 near Ras 'Ashairij; the westernmost cove, Dohat * For recent information about the Kuwait boat harbours the Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for February 1905 and for September 1905 may be consulted. Some remarks on the bay by Admiral Atkinson-Willes, will be found hi the Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1904. An honorary Naib Karpardaz place._——KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN 1049 Kadhamah between Has' Ashairij and Ras Kadliamali, forms the innermost recess of the whole bay, and near the foot of it stands the village of Jahrah. The land surrounding the bay is low except on the north side where the Zor bills, parallel to the shore, attain a height of 150 to 400 feet. A flat of soft mud extends for some distance off shore on the northern side of tbe bay making communication diificult at low water between sea and land. In most parts o£ the bay the water is of suitable depth for anchorage and there is good holding-ground : the soundings are 14 fathoms off Eas- al-Ardh and 6 to 10 fathoms off Has 'Ajuzah, shoaling to 6 fathoms at the entrance of Dohat Kadhamah. There is a rocky 2-fathom shoal, called Fasht-al-Hadibah ^JJ 2i miles north of the town. The anchorage for large vessels is called Bandar Tuwainah j it lies a mile and a half to the north of the town inside Fasht-al-Hadibah. In a Shamal a considerable sea rises in the south part of the bay, not enough however to distress a large vessel; but in a Qaus vessels anchoring outside the Hadibah shoal^ or with the town south by west to south-south-west, might not be sufficiently sheltered. Shoal water extends off the town of Kuwait for about 8 cables, and landing at low tide is inconvenient as the beach dries out to a considerable distance ; but at high water the sea washes up almost to the houses. In front of the town are several tidal harbours, called Niqa ahs of considerable size, formed by piers and breakwaters or Surs of loose coral blocks : these are often breached in a Shamal, but are easily lepahed. On the beach proper lie in winter, drawn up above the high- watei line, many of the pearling and other vessels on which the pros- parity of the town depends : in places these extend, almost touching each othei s sides, for hundreds of yards, and when launched they must form an imposing fleet. The boat harbour of Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh near the town is described in the article on Qurain island, and the bay and P omontory of K ad ham ah are dealt with in the article under their own name. The town audits surroundings** —The town now measures about 2 miles i , 0rL ^ s ^ ore ; and is rapidly extending towards Eas^Ajuzah ; its depth om on e-f ourth to three-fourths of a mile. Free sites granted Govern aCC0Unt ^ these boat harbours, accompanied by a map, will be found in the of India s Foreign Proceedings for September 1905.7 1050 KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN by tlie Shaikh on all sides of the town are, on account o£ the increasing prosperity of the place, being rapidly taken np and built upon by enterprising individuals as a commercial speculation. The land surround ing Kuwait is pure desert as far as the eye can reach and belongs to the tract called Qra/ah. One mile west of the town, on Eas^ Ajuzah, is a fortified dwelling house, erected in 1904 by the eldest son of the Shaikh of Kuwait and named after him Qasr-ash-Shaikh Jabir jjU To the south of the town the land rises for a mile or so and then falls; consequently the place is lost from sight soon after leaving it. On this side, in the cold weather, are pitched many Bedouin camps, and there is a constant coming and going of camels and of small caravans. Kuwait was formerly walled and 30 years ago had seven gates on the landward side, but since that time it has doubled in size and the sites of the old gates are now known to few; of one only, the Darwazat Jana'at olcU^ ajl^, which was the second in order from the east, do any traces remain. Kuwait is now an open, undefended town. From the centre of the town on the south side has grown out a long suburb called Murqab beyond which is a gypsiferous tract where Juss or gypsum mortar is manufactured by simply firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. The site of the town is generally flat and sandy; but the south-western quarter stands on somewhat higher ground than the rest and has steep lanes leading down from it to the beach. The streets are irregular and winding, many of them are blind alleys, and the town is not laid out on any general plan; the only street of apparent importance, besides the main bazaar which runs at right angles to the sea about the middle of the town, is one which leads from the Suq or market square, situated at the back of the town near the Murqab quarter^ to the north-east end of the town, but it has no general name. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet-wall enclosing the roof; they are generally built surrounding a courtyard. The better sort are of stone plastered with Juss and have high arched gateways, sometimes with a wicket-door in the middle of the gate ; a few arches appear also in upper storeys. The system of conservancy is rudimentary ; the sewage is deposited in large, open public cesspools in the various quarters. There are between *20 and E0 mosques^ of which 4 are Jami's or Friday congregational mosques ; these are the chief mosque, which stands on the west side of the main bazaar, the Shaikh^s mosque on the sea face near his residence, the mosque of Haddad and the mosque of the Jana/at oUlU.; none of these have any architectural pretensions.KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN 1051 Climate. —Tlie climate o£ Kuwait compares favourably with that o£ most ports in the Persian Gulf. In winter, especially when a Shamal is blowing 1 , it is sometimes bitterly cold ; in summer the heat of the sun is tempered by sea breezes, and the clean sand desert cools down rapidly at night. The air, however, except in a breeze, is laden with fetid odours, chiefly of the fish-oil with which the boats that line the whole beach are smeared and of human excreta. MaUtants. —The population of Kuwait is now about 35,000, of whom the great majority are Arabs of the 'Utub, 'Awazim, Eashaidah, Bani Khalid, 'Ajman^ Dawasir, 'Anizah, and Dhafir tribes besides Hasawiyah or Arabs from Hasa and Baharinali from Bahrain. There are also a number of Persians, some Jews, some Jana/at and many negroes; also 2 Armenians. No Indians are settled here. The 'Utub are the tribe to which the Shaikhs of Kuwait belong, but they are reckoned to be only about 30 (another account says 250) families. The resident Bani Khalid belong, in part at least, to the Mahashlr, A1 Miqdam and Bani Nahad sections of that tribe. More than 100 Arab households in the town are immigrants from Zilfi in Kajd. The Persian community consists of about 3,000 souls j its members do not inhabit a separate quarter but are scattered through the town ; nearly all of them are permanently settled at Kuwait, nevertheless they go and come freely between Kuwait and the parts of Persia to which they originally belonged. Persian merchants are about a score ; over 100 Persians are shopkeepers; 20!) of the remainder are penniless labourers who live from hand to mouth. The Jews amount to between 100 and 200 souls ; they have a synagogue of their own, called a Kamsah ; at Kuwait they seem to be notorious chiefly for the distillation of spirituous liquors which some of the Muhammadan population consume secretly in dread of the Shaikh. Two of the Jews are well-to-do merchants; the rest are mostly cloth-sellers and goldsmiths. The Jana'at are a small colony of 150 souls; some are merchants, the others sailors and boatmen. The negroes are a very conspicuous element in the population ; they number about 4,000 altogether, and have social clubs of their own which are distin- guished by peculiar sky-signs ; about one-third are Ma ; tuq or emancipated, while two-thirds are Mamluk or enslaved. Ihe Muhammadans of Kuwait are nearly all Sunnis : the exceptions are the Persians, Baharinah and some of the Hasawiyah, who are Shfahs, and some immigrants from Uajd, who are Wahhabis. The pilgrimage Makkah from Kuwait is never made by land at present, and the annual dumber of pilgrims who go by sea is only from 20 to 40.1052 KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN The Arab population of Kuwait are not on the whole of a robust type; they are generally long-faced, slender and inclined to lankiness; the complexion of many is sickly. The men wear the ordinary garments of the sedentary Arab, while the women dress in black veils and over- mantles, but sometimes display beneath a bright-coloured skirt which they allow to trail in the dust for some distance behind them. A remarkable scene follows sunset, when the town suddenly becomes alive witli mendicants, mostly children, who beset the doors of the houses and beg in melancholy voices for a morsel from the evening meal; they are seldom repulsed from any gate. Merchants and other townsmen of Kuwait often resort for a change, before the pearling season, to the small villages in the adjacent Qra'ah and 'Adan districts. Supplies and water, —Neither Kuwait town nor its environs can boast of any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations, no fields, hardly even a kitchen garden. Forage and vegetables are mostly brought from Jahrah or from abroad; and the Bedouins of the neighbourhood provide the town with dried curds or Yuqat, ghi or Saman and truffles or Faqa 5 £-£■&gt;, both fresh and dried, besides camel- dung or Jillah which is used as fuel to supplement the scanty supply of brushwood from the neighbourhood. The drinking water of the town is mostly obtained from wells 4 miles to the south of the town and it is passably good, but water of better quality is supplied to the Shaikhs household from the wells of Qasr-as -Sirrah or those of Mishrif in Qra'ah. Sea yWrn^—The only truly local produce of Kuwait is that yielded by the harbour fisheries: these are a valuable asset. The principal fish is the Zubaidi, a deep thin fish about 1 foot long, which is in season from December to April and, though found all over the bay, is caught chiefly between the island of Failakah and its outlier ^Auhah in water from 2 to 12 fathoms deep ; the Zubaidi forms about one-third of the total catch of the Kuwait boats. The Zubaidi is captured with float-and-weight nets, 2 to 2| fathoms deep, which are set across the tide-way ; these nets are made in lengths of 36 fathoms, and each boat carries 8 to 16 lengths which are connected when set so as to form one long barrier of 300 to 700 fathoms in extent; sometimes as many as 70 boats go out. The nets are cast after sunset and are hauled three times in the night; fish that are not disposed of on the first day, in consequence of not reaching the town in time, are salted. The next mostKUWAIT BAY AND TOWN 1055 common kinds of fish are the Naqrur and the Nawaibi ; which each consti tute about one-quarter of the yield of the fisheries. The Naqrur, varying in length from 1 to 2 feet, is found all over the harbour, is in season in March and April, and is caught with lines or Khuyut by about 40 boats, prawns and small fish being used as bait. The Nawaibi is about the same size, is in season at the same time, and is caught in the same manner. The Maid is a fish rather less than a foot long, which is caught along the beach in summer with hand-nets. Eibyan or prawns, whieli are in season in March and April and again in October and November, are captured with fine triangular hand-nets. Many fish are taken also in stake-nets or rather tidal weirs called Hadhrahs, con structed of reed-hurdles ; the fish enter them with the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. These Hadhrahs are a common sight along the coast near Kuwait and also at other places such as Bahrain. The fishermen of Kuwait are mostly town Arabs, but there are a few Persians: the boats used are Shu^ais, Baqarahs and Ballams. As a rale Kuwait fishermen do not go outside ^Auhah near Failakah^ but occasionally they visit the Khor 'Abdullah and fish it, for Zubaidi only, between Ras-al-Qaid and Warbah island ; at such times they take their drinking water with them and are absent from Kuwait for about a week, not landing on Bubiyan island except to collect fuel. Pearl fisheries, —The lower and middle classes of Kuwait town almost all live by seafaring occupations, such as fishing, pearl diving and the coasting trade; at present (1904) the town possesses 461 pearl-boats carrying 9,200 men; but of the crews, in the pearling season, some 1,500 or 2,000 are Persian subjects. A large number of Kuwait pearl fishers—in 1905 no less than 3,000—now visit the Ceylon pearl banks in winter, instead of remaining at home to prosecute the cold weather sea fisheries which have been described above. Carrying trade. —The carrying trade of Kuwait is chiefly confined to the upper and western part of the Persian Gulf and to the Shatt-al- Arab \ its ordinary limits are Qatlf on the south and Basrah on the north, and the boats engaged in it are seldom absent from Kuwait for mo re than two months at a time. Seagoing cargo vessels number 36, ^•3 U Baghlahs, 20 Bums and 5 Shu'ais ; the Baghlahs have an average carrying capacity of 2,000, and the Bums and Shu ais one of 1,200 date packages each. Coasters 'are about 50 Bums with an average carrying a pacity of 700 date packages each» Besides these cargo vessels, which1064 KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN though owned at Kuwait are quite distinct from the pearl boats, about 50 strange boats—chiefly Ballams—visit the port with wood and vegetables from the Shatt-al-'Arab ; and occasional calls are made by vessels from Kharag island and from Sur in the Sultanate of 'Oman. Boat-building. —Except boat-building, there are no local mamifac- tures. About 20 or 25 vessels are turned out annually, the timber, coir- rope and flbre required being brought from Calicut, and the ribs from Karachi: the nails used are also from India. About 800 carpenters gain a livelihood by boat-building; their earnings range from J of a Rival to 4 Riyals a day. Miscellaneous occupations.—The other occupations and industries of the town are directed to the satisfaction of local requirements: an enumeration of them as they were in 1904 will help to elucidate the character of Kuwait. There were then 36 dealers in piece goods, 21 goldsmiths, 11 blacksmiths, 12 tinsmiths, 7 gunsmiths, II lamp makers, 182 dealers in Bedouin requisites (such as carpets, cheap'Abas or cloaks, nails, horseshoes, lead and shot), 18 leather workers, 17 quilt makers, 28 haberdashers, 21 tailors, 37 cloak embroiderers, 7 gold and silk braid workers, 12 makers of 'Aqals or Arab head fillets, 13 barbers, II confectioners, 8 bakers, 3 professional cooks, II fishmongers, 86 butchers, 14 tobacconists, 9 ghi sellers, 32 date merchants, 16 drag- gists, 28 fruiterers, 24 rice merchants, 15 wheat dealers, 2 oil pressers, 147 grocers and druggists, 9 grass sellers and, lastly, 35 male and 32 female brokers of private goods on commission who had fixed places of business. There were at the same time 12 tea shops, 7 cafes, 70 business offices, 250 warehouses for the storage of grain, and 6 stores for the materials used in pressing oil. Weights, measures and currency weights and measures by means of whicli the tradesmen of Kuwait conduct their business with one another and with the^ general public deserve a brief notice. Small weights are the Habbah ^ of 3 gr. English, the Mithqal 'Attari Jliu/e of 54 grains, the Mithqal Shirazi JU j U of 72 grains, and the Tolah aJy of 120 grains; but these are only in use for weighing such commodities as the precious metals, precious stones, gold and silver thread or lace, raw silk, silk thread and drugs. The ordinary unit of weight in retail transactions is a Waqiyah ^ equal to 4 lbs. 10 oz. 1 dr. English; there is also a retail Mann of 30 Waqiyahs or 138 lbs.KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN 1055 131 oz. EnglisL The unit of weight in the wholesale trade is also a Waqiyah, but one heavier (except in the case of the Mann of 30 Waqijahs when it is the same) than the Waqiyah of retail trade and equal to about 4 lbs. 14 oz. 3 dr. English. The larger wholesale weights are a Qiyas (pronounced Jiyas) of 6 Waqiyahs or 29 lbs. 5 oz. | dr. English, used for wool; a Mann of 12 Waqiyahs or 58 lbs. 10 oz. 1 dr. English^ used for twist and sail cloth from Persia and Bahrain; a Mann of 24 Waqiyahs or 117 lbs. 4 oz. 2 dr. English^ used for ghi, tallow and mortar; and a Mann of 27 Waqiyahs or 137 lbs. 14 oz. 10 dr. English; used for all other commodities except cereals and dates which are sold by the Mann of 30 (retail) Waqiyahs or 138 lbs. 13 oz. 11 dr. English. Weighments in the wholesale trade are all made with steel yards by professional weighmen who charge half an anna per Mann for their services. The license fees paid by these weighmen were in 1904 a perquisite of the Shaikh ; s mother^ but she died in 1905^ and they are now taken by the Shaikh himself. The unit of length is a cubit or Dhira' ^ of 18f inches. Cotton and woollen goods and some kinds of planking are sold by the Dhira/ and it is used for measuring up masonry work which has been given out on contract by the piece. Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut kandy o£ 10 cubic feet and 29 cubic inches^ chandals (round rafters or spars) by the Korjah or score^ and boat ribs by the Gari or cart load of 40 pieces or upwards according to size. Indian rupees and other coins are current; but the basis of the local currency is the Maria Theresa dollar or Eiyal Jb; of which 100 are on the average equivalent in value to 135 Indian rupeebut in 1905-06 the rate of exchange fluctuated between 133 and 152. Trade. — i Kuwait owes its mercantile^ as distinguished from its political importance; to its pearling and coasting fleet; to trade—especially a lucrative smuggling trade—with Persia and Turkish 'Iraq; and to the fact that it is the only port serving Najd which is not under Turkish control. The richest merchants of Kuwait are Arabs who have made their fortunes in general trade; ten of them possess capitals ranging from 25;000 to Rs. 5;00;000. Of the Persian trading community two are wealthy, while about 20 others have sums between Rs. 5;000 and ^ 10;000 invested in their business ; two Jews also employ from s * 40;000 to Es. 50;000 each in local trade. As no statistics of imports and exports are kept at Kuwait or; if kept ^y the Shaikh's customs department, are not communicated, it is impossible1056 KUWAIT BAT AND TOWN to give reliable particulars of foreign trade. According, however, to tlie most recent trade report the value of foreign goods imported bv sea in 1905-06 was Rs. 48,18,929 of which Rs. 27,69,054 represented goods arriving by steamer and the balance goods brought in native sailing craft. In the year mentioned the chief classes of imports were as foliows, in order of value :— Article. Value in lakhs of rupees. Eemaeks. Arms and ammu nition 10| Entirely by steamer; four-fifths of the total were of British and one-fifth was of French origin. It i s said that about three-quarters of the rifles and cartridges landed eventually find their way into Tmkish Iraq , the remainder, with the exception of a few which are smuggled into Persia, are disposed of to Central Arabian customers. Very few arms go from Kuwait to Hasa, which is more conveniently supplied through Qatar. Rice H More than half from Turkish 'Iraq by sailing boat the remainder by steamer from India. That from Turkish 'Iraq arrives in the husk. Piece-goods 5 By steamer, four-fifths from India and one-fifth from Americaj the latter are Mexicans. At present half the superior piece goods in cases go to Basrah and more than one-fourth to Muhammareh.; Tobacco By sailing boat from ^ Turkish 'Iraq. Nearly half the quantity received appears to be re-export ed to the same country. Wet dates 3| From Turkish 'Iraq by saiJing boat. Nearly one-third of the quantity received was exported to Persia and the Arabian coast. Wheat 2f Smuggled from Persia by sailing boat. More than half_ the quantity was re-exported to Turkish 'Iraq and the Arabian coast, being divided in about equal proportions between the two. Coffee 21} By steamer from India and America, in the propor tion of three quarters and one quarter respectively. The Brazilian coffee from America, which is of recent introduction, has not as yet found any sale in Najd, and the Indian is still preferred even at Kuwait. Some Arabian coffea for private consump tion, not for sale, is brought from Aden, etc., by owners of native sailing vessels. Barley- 2 All by sailing vessels, three-fourths from Persia and one-fourth from Turkish 'Iraq. Sugar If By steamer, three-quarters from Grermany and one- quarter from India.Ill' KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN It is said that the bulk of the rice, wheat, coffee and barley, and of the baled piece-goods such as cheap Mexicans, are not consumed at Kuwait but have Najd for their destination. The total value of exports in 1905-06 was only Es. 11,54,322 and the table of valuable exports and re-exports is consequently a short one ; it is as follows : — Article. Value in lakhs of rupees. R emarks. Tobacco 2 A re-export ; see table of imports, Wheat 14 Uitto ditto. Pearls i These all went to India. Wet dates U These were a re-export, as noted in the table of imports. Ghi i This is a true export and all went to Bahrain. Besides these commodities there is a small export of lambskins to Russia via Baghdad and of horses to India ; but the horse trade of North- Eastern Arabia with India seems now to have been diverted, or rather to have returned, to Basrah; its original port. It would be imprudent to base any general conclusions on the statis tics of a single year, the first for which complete figures have been avail able, but it is of interest to observe that the volume of imports is evidently much greater than that of exports. Of this fact a two-fold explanation is admissible ; first that, while Kuwait as a place of import serves Najd and to some extent; Turkish ''Iraq and Persia, as a place of export it serves only the poor and sparsely populated tract which is politically dependent on it, — in other words a large part of its trade is a transit trade taking place in one direction only; second, that the balance of trade is partly adjusted in specie, while the earnings abroad of the mariners and pearl fishers of Kuwait must also be taken into account in this connection. The value of the specie exported from Kuwait in 904-05 was Rs. 4?,32,223 and in 1905-06 Es. 2,87,535 ; in both years 18 specie went chiefly to India and was considerably in excess of the amount of specie imported. In 1905-06 of the total sea-borne trade of Kuwait in both directions, ^out 30 75 per cent, was with India, 26 , 77 per cent, with Turkish tlj ^ ^ ^ Kingdom and 9*21 per cent, with Persia ; am rei f am( ^ er was divided among various countries in less considerable 0 un -s. With regard to trade by land, it is stated that before the war 3 y1058 KUWAIT BAY AND TOWN in Central Arabia about 20 caravans from Southern Kajd and two from Jabal Shammar used to come in annually at Kuwait • on the other hand, while the course of events was unfavourable to the Shaikh of Kuwait and his allies and Ha far was in the hands of Ibn Rashid, the Central Arabian trade was in a large measure diverted to Basrah and Najaf; and at the present time direct commercial relations between Kuwait and Jabal Shammar are still in abeyance. Batches of 300 to 500 camels are occasionally exported to Syria by land. The slow steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company has called regularly once a fortnight at Kuwait since the 8th of July 1903, and on the 9th of December 1904 the fast steamer began to call in the intermediate weeks. In 1905-06 no less than 50 steamers (all British) with a total tonnage of 51,893 entered the port of Kuwait, Administration.— is despotically and personally governed by the Shaikh. There is no delegation of authority. The town is divided into many quarters, but in none of them is there any recognised headman: all the inhabitants must deal direct with the Shaikh, who generally gives audience at the market place for an hour or two every morning. The nature of the Shaikhs general administration is explained in the article on the Kuwait Principality. Bedouins are not now forbidden to enter the town armed, but they generally leave their weapons in their tents outside. The town guard consists of about 20 watchmen indifferently armed and equipped. KUWAIT PRINCI PALITY ^ Strategical and commercial advantages, close political relations with the British Government, the proximity and (at times) hostility of the Turks and an intimate connection with Central Arabian affairs combine to render the position of the Kuwait Shaikhdom remarkable. The Turks affect to regard Kuwait as a Qadha of their Basrah Sanjaq and the Shaikh as a Turkish official; but, as will be apparent from the recent history of the principality, it might be more justly regarded as an independent state under virtual British protection. *This leading article on the Kuwait principality and the other minor articles in the Gazetteer on places, etc., in tbe same are the outcome chiefly of special investigatiofls held between 1904 and 1907. The information previously available in books and reports was collected by the writer in 1904 and was brought out in November of that year in the form of 19 printed foolscap pages of notes to serve as a basis for fmther proceedings. In December 1904 the writer visited Kuwait, and, after collecting inform ation there for several days, travelled by land in company with Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait, Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel and Mr. J. C. Gasiin to t eKUWAIT PRINCIPALITY 1059 Extent boundaries of the Kuwait principality are for the most part fluctuating and undefined ; they are, at any given time, the limits of tlie tribes which then, either voluntarily or under compulsion, own allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The northern and southern frontiers Turkish frontier; between Jahrah. and Safwaa the party followed two different routes. A complete survey of the country traversed in this tour was made by Surveyor Sher Jang of the Survey of India and was after continued by him south wards from Kuwait Town for about 30 miles. The further collection of general inform ation was carried on by Captain Knox during the early part of 1905 ; and in September the writer was able to produce a set of draft articles on the Kuwait Shaikh- dom, extending to over 50 printed octavo pages. These drafts were carefully revised, by Captain Knox, and much fresh information also became available in consequence of two journeys which he made, one in January 1906 to Hafar and t'ue other in March 1906 to Warah, south of Kuwait Town. In 1906 Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent in Bahrain, supplied much useful information regarding the southern districts of Kuwait. The drafts were reprinted at the beginning of 1907 with corrections and additions which increased them to over 60 pages; and thereupon fresh references were made to the Political Agent at Kuwait. During 1907 the results of a survey by Commander Beauchamp, R. I. M., of Khor Zubair in the preceding October and of another journey by Captain Knox southwards along the coast (to Baniyat-az-Zor) became available and were incorporated, as were also new material relating to trade. An account, with maps, of a journey by Major Knox in the country north of Kuwait, made in December 1907 and January 1908, arrived too late for incorporation and has been transferred to the Foreign Department ; and similarly a report on an important journey from Kuwait to !Nta' in Wadi-al -Miyah, made by the same officer in February 1908, can only be mentioned here. General authorities on Kuwait up to 1904 were the following, which were con cerned chiefly, but not in the case of Colonel Pelly exclusivelv, with the town and its environs: Stocqueler's Fijteen Months' Pilgrimage, 1832, Bombay Records XKIV, 1856; Colonel L. Felly's Remarks on the Tribes, etc., 1863 ; his Recent Tour round the Northern Portion of ths Persian Gulf (with map), 1863; his Report on a Journey to the Wahabee Capital map), 1865 ; a report by Dr. Cassim Izzedine, dated 14th November 1897, contained in the Political Proceedings of the Government ot India for June 1898; and Captain H. H. Dowding's Report on Koweit (with m*p\ 1903. The Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898, deals sufficiently with the features of the coast except such as have only recently attracted attention, viz., those belonging to the Khoi 'Abdullah, Khor Umm Qasr and Khor Zubair waterways, which are on the border between Kuwait and Turkish 'Iraq.. In relation to these last the principal authorities are-.—a report on Khor 'Abdullah and Umm Qasr by Commander T. W. Kemp, R.N., dated 20th February 1902, and contained in the Government of India's Political Proceedings for July 1902 ; a report by Mr. F. E. Crow, Consul at Basrah, on a journev from Basrah to Umm Qasr and Khor 'Abdullah, dated the 4th May 1903 and contained in Proceedings for January 1904 ; a Reconnaissance Report, 1904, by Captain H. Smyth on Umm Qasr and Kadhamah in connection ^ith the projected Baghdad Railway, contained in Proceedings for October 1905 ; a report by Captain E. W. S. Mahon, B E., dated 24th July 1905, dealing with Umm Qasr, Warbah Island, and Kadhamah and Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh in Kuwait Bay as possible termini of the same propcsed line; and finally a report by Commander 31060 KUWAIT PBJNOIPALITY in the neighbourliood of tlie sea may however be regarded as fixed • on those sides the question is not between the Shaikh and nomadic Arab tribes but between the Shaikh and the Turkish Government.f On the north the most advanced Turkish outposts upon the mainland are at XJmm Qasr and Safwan and the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait is unquestioned up to the very walls of those places ; we may accordingly consider the frontier on this side to be a line running from Khor-as -Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam aud thence to the Batin. On the south the Turks have no station nearer to Kuwait Town than Musallamiyah Island, nor does the Shaikh claim to exercise any real control over the Radaif W. G. Beauchamp, on Khors 'Abdullah and Znbair, forwarded to the Government of India by Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, with a demi- official letter, dated 20th November 1906. The principal source of i nformation in regard to trade is the commercial report now compiled annually by the Political Agent at Kuwait. The map issued with this Gazetteer, superseding the Map of Parts of Arabia and Persia, 1883, will be found the most useful on a small scale for the principality of Kuwait as a whole ; and the large scale survey made by K. S. Sher .lang of the more important districts has since been reproduced by the Survey of India as a Map of the Country round Kuwait, 1904-05. Map of Route of the Political Agent, Kuweit, to Hafar, 1906, gives the topography of the region between Kuwait Town and that place and is filed in the Foreign Department Library, Simla, as No. 1373; while Cajtain Prideaux s Map of Eastern Arabia north of Qatar, 1.905, links the geo graphy of Kuwait with that of the Hasa Saniaq (Foreign Department Library, Simla, No. 1369). The^ principal charts of Kuwait waters are No. 2374—2837-B, Persian Gulf ] IS)o. 28/9—22 (plan), Kuweit Rarhour ; and No. 2380—1235, Mouth of the Eujphratet, etc. : some additional soundings in Kuwait Harbour are given in a tracing which ac companied a report by the Officer Commanding the R. I. M. S. Lawrenc?,' dated 8th February 1900, and is contained in the Government of India's Political Proceedings for October 1900. Recent marine surveys of general importance are the Port of Kuweit, Poona, 1905, and Approaches to Koweit Harbour E. 31, Poona, 1906. Special marine surveys relating to the waterways north of Bubiyan Island are Soundings in Khar Abdulla by H. M. S. ' Sphinx,' July 1903 (Commander Kemp,^R.N.) and a Sketch Survey of iQor 1906 (Commander Beanchamp, R. I. id.) Ihe general features of the last mentioned survey are now conveniently incorporated in a reproduction of Chart No. 2381—3293, Approaches to Kuweit Harbour and Shatt-al-Arab. fin our sr&amp;marks on the northern and southern frontiers we have given weight not only to the statements of the Shaikh of Kuwait but also to facts observed in 1904 on a journey between Kuwait Town and Basrah and tp reports (1905) from Bahrain regarding the northern limits of Hasa. The Shaikh of Kuwait stated (1904) that his authority was in some degree respected by the inhabitants of Wadi -al-Miyah, and it is questionable whether his limit in this direction should net be placed somewhat further south. If we carry the principality further south we must include Wadi-al- miyah among its districts and the Alu Dhahair bills among its natural features.lilml KUWAIT PRINCIPAIilTY 1061 tract; his boundary on this side may accordingly be considered to run westwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na'airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Eadaif. It is a task of great difficulty to circumscribe the Shaikh/s territories on the remaining sides with even approximate accuracy.* Shaikh Mubarak states (1904) that on the north -west his influence reaches to the Batin and somewhat beyond it, and that on the west the inhabitants of Summan^ but not those of Dahanahj acknowledge him; and his assertion is to some extent borne out by known facts in regard to the occupation of Hafai* which Ibn Rashid^ though at one time he seized it; was unable for long to retain. We may therefore consider that the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Ha far by the Batin, and that south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. These being the limits of the Kuwait Principality its length from north-north-west to south-south-east is about 190, and its breadth from east-north-east to west-south-west about 160 miles. The islands belonging to Kuwait are mentioned in the next paragraphs Districts and islands, —The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of aline joining Kuwait Town and Eiqal. In the northerii block lie the districts or tracts of Batin 5 Shiqqaq, Batih^ Umm-al^ Khilan, Yah, Qira'-al-Marru, Zaqlah and Zor. The southern block com prises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah and Umm Janaib: and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Kuwait Bay^ is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq^ Qra/ab, 'Adan, Salu , and Hazaim. There is also, in the extreme south, a district called SMah, -which some authorities treat as independent of Umm Janaib and others regard as a portion of it. Excluding the island of Bubiyan 5 which is claimed by the Shaikh of Kuwait but is at present (1905) occupied by the Turks^ and the island of Warbah, the ownership of which would naturally follow that 0 f Bubiyan, we may reckon the maritime possessions of Kuwait to consist 0 f the island of Failakah which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and^Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al-Maradirn.

As a whole the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait is monotonous, devoid of striking features, and sterile. The only well-marked valleys of any size are those of Batin and Shaqq, while the only eminences deserving of mention are Jabal Sanam on the northern boundary, the J al-az -Zor on the north side of Kuwait Bay, and the Dhula , -al -Mi , aijil towards the south of Umm Janaib ; isolated hills of some importance as landmarks are Sirrah in Qra/ah, Burqanand Warahin 'Adan^Qrain and 'Amudah in Sudah, besides the small plateaux of Ba^al in Sudah and Warai^all near Dhula'-al -Mi'aijil. The soil is generally gravelly in the districts to the north of Kuwait Bay ; in the more southerly it is partly sand and partly clay, except in Summan where there seems to be little sand. In many places there are low outcrops of sandstone, and in Sum- man these are a leading characteristic. Nowhere in Kuwait^ it is said) is there any flowing water or spring rising to the surface of the ground except Maqta': the entire water supply is from wells which are on the average about 20 feet deep and are frequently saline. Jhe only minerals known to exist are Juss or gypsum, in fields near Kuwait Town, and elsewhere^ and bitumen which exudes from the ground in a hollow near the Burqan hill. Flora and fauna* —Vegetation is exceedingly scanty and in winter becomes almost invisible. The only trees are the date and the ber or Sidar and they, even, are not met with except in the environs of villages. Shrubs founds especially in the northern districts, and useful as grazing for camels are the 'Arfaj and the 'Ausaj, the latter is a thorny bush with small leaves and red berries. The colocynth, called Handhal, flourishes in the desert; and south of Kuwait Bay the grass called Thamam is obtainable, but is often of poor quality. Nasi grass is also obtainable in places. Animal and bird life are scarce^ but the wild animals include the hare and a gazelle resembling the Indian chinkara, also the wolf: among land birds are the lesser bustard and the sandgrouse, the last being plenti ful in the Bat in in winter. Communications. —From what has gone before it will be apparent that Kuwait, though free as to its surface from physical obstacles^ is not a country of easy travelling. At a maximum distance of 20 to 25 miles from the town in any direction even the smallest quantity of provisionsKUWAIT PRINCIPALITY 1Q67 ceases to be obtainableit is thus necessary to carry all the food required for a journey. The case of forage is not so difficult, as in many localities camels are able to support themselves by grazing on the road. Water is scarce, especially to the north of Jahrah, and routes are determined every where chiefly by the position and state of the wells. The principal routes are two leading to Basrah and four (of which two pass through Hafar) to Najd: the details of the more important follow below. All these of course are mere tracks ; there are no made roads.— L—Route from Kuwait Town to Basrah via Qasr-as-Sahlyali, Umm Qasr and Safwdn.* Halting place.

Before leaving the Jahrah Distriot Khabrat-al-Ba'al is left on the right at five ^ miles, and Rahaiyah hill on the left at 6 miles ; at 9 miles a curving ridge, connected with the Faridah hill to the right, is crossed after traversing the plain o£ Umm Atwainij; and at 16 miles the ridge of Saddah is surmount ed. Up to this point there is a continuous ascent. Four miles beyond Saddah the route descends into the Shaqq valley, here 5 miles broad; the halting place is reached immediately on emerging from Shaqq. Khabrat- al-Paraq is to the left 2 miles before camp is reached. At 7 miles from the starting point the general route to Qasim is struck ; it consists of half-a- dozen parallel tracks, but it is easily lost from sight in the camel grazing which grows thickly here abouts. The country is poor and without landmarks. A few gazelle are to be seen. At 30 miles tne Khabrah of Umm- al-Hamir is passed.

Qasr Ballal m 36 miles south-west. See article Batin. There is frequently no water.

Water is sometimes obtain* able in the beds of the 'Adhariyat. Hafar 25 miles south-west. See article Hafar. There is water in deep wells, but fuel (except camel dung) is totally wanting. The route lies along the Batin. At inter vals there are places where water is some times obtainable. The nature of this route will be more fully understood after reference to the articles on Dibdibah, Riqa'i, Batin and Hafar, also to that on Jahrah : the distance from Kuwait to Hafar is, it will he seen, about 168 miles. The continuation of the route beyond Hafar is given in the article on Najd. IV.—Route from Kuwait Town to Hafar direct.* This route runs at first about south-west by south for 46 miles, tlie Kabd plateau being left to the north-west and the Warah and Burqan hills in 'Adan to the south-east : at 9 miles the Jadadiyah &lt;^1^.wells are passed, at a short distance to the west of which at 2 miles distance is another (*&gt; group of wells called Sulaibiyah At neither of these places is the water good ; but the supply at Jadadiyah is the more plentiful and nearer to the surface, standing at 4 fathoms. At 46 miles, at a place about ^0 miles west of the Subaihiyah wells in ' Adaiij a halt may be made; but, as ^This route is from the same source as the last. The stages described are those of Captain Knox's journey, the direction being reversed, but the halting places have no special advantages and are not obligatory. A more direct line might have been ^ the part between Kuwait Town and Abul Hiran,(^•72 V / KUWAIT PRINCIPALITY 1073 is usual in Kuwait territory, there is no reeog'nised camping ground. Here the direction changes to almost due west. At 9 miles beyond the camp ing'place, and at about 10 miles to the south of the IVHnaqTsh hills^ he route descends into the Shaqq valley, across which it continues for 9 miles; about 4 miles beyond the western bank of Shaqq a featureless plain belonging to the Dibdibah district affords the usual facilities (which do not include water) for camping in the desert. The next stage is about 30 miles, west by south, to Abul Hiran in Dibdibah; at a little more than half way the ridge of SaW is passed, distant a mile or two from the route on the right hand side. At Abul Hiran is a water hole which is said to contain water for a month after rain ; and between Sala^ and Abul HTran a ridge which is one of the principal features of Dibdibah is surmounted. The next stage is one of 24 miles, west by south, to a nameless halting place without water or other conveniences. The route then runs for 28 miles nearly west-south-west to a camping ground of the usual type upon the summit of the scarcely perceptible Musannah ridge, the most important natural feature of the Dibdibah district; during the second and greater part of this march the way lies along the Musannah ridge, upon which it has gradually converged from the southern side. The next march is also 38 miles and the direction is still the same, but the route gradually diverges from the Musannah ridge to its northern side. The ground is Hazam, that is to say is hard and lightly strewn with pebbles. The last stage of 1] miles, ending at Hafar, is of [a similar character, but the direction is west by south. It appears that water cannot be relied on, except after rain, at any point upon this route. The total distance from Kuwait Town to Hafar by this route is apparently about 180 miles. The article on the Dibdibah district will cast further light on the character of this route. y^Uoute Jfom Kuwait Town to Zilfi in Najd.

Non-Arabs and Shfahs are found only in the town of Kuwait. The two tribes which compose the bulk of the population outside of Kuwait Town are the 'Awazim and Rashaidah ; both are regarded as of socially inferior status, nevertheless they differ 'but little from the ordinary Bedouin Arabs. To these we may add wandering bands of the Saluba, between whom ani the Arabs there is a more pronounced difference. Some of the friendly Dhafir and Mutair tribes of Najd enter Kuwait limits at certain seasons; indeed, tlie Kuwait portion of Summan is exclusively tenanted by the Mutair, and a large number of the Mutair encamp every season at Jahrah. The people of Jahrah are mostly of Najdi extraction. A few stray 'Ajman, Bani Hajir and Bani Khalid from the south are found in Kuwait limits; and Kuwait Town containsj in addition to representatives of most of the tribes already mentioned, ^nizah, Dawasir, Jana/at, and ^Utub. The only permanent villages in Kuwait are Jahrah at the head of Kuwait Bay, Qasr-as-SabTyah on Khor-as -Sabiyah, Zor on Failakah island, Dimnah and Qasr-as -Sirrah in the Qra ; ah district and Fahaihil, Fantas, Abu Halaifah and Shi'aibah on the coast of 'Adan, none of which are more than 25 miles in a direct line from Kuwait Town. The fixed population of the principality, consisting of the inhabitants of the town and villages may be estimated at 37,000 souls, of whom no less than 35,000 are residents of the capital; and the Bedouin population, if we reckon only the 'Awazim and Eashaidah and a part of the Mutair (whose tribal headquarters are in the principality) and exclude others such as the Dhafir (who are merely visitors), must amount apparently to about 13,000 souls. Agriculture and trade.~~K general description of such agriculture as exists in Kuwait will be found in the article on Jahrah, and the article on Dimnah contains a description of village dwellings intermediate between the. houses of Kuwait Town and the tents of the Bedouins. Domestic animals are the camel, sheep, goat and donkey and there are some horned cattle and a few horses. Commerce is fully treated of m the article on Kuwait Town. General administration. —The present Shaikh's method of govern ment is among the most remarkable peculiarities of the principality. Mubarak's rule is personal and absolute; and if in some respects it isKUWAIT PRINCIPALITY 1076 mild and tolerant^ in others it is exceedingly strict. On the whole, it may be said that in the town he exacts absolute submission and in the country is content with general loyalty'and obedience; but this dictum implies a higher degree of ■control than might at first be supposed, inasmuch as in Kuwait the whole country depends for its wealth and prosperity upon the one town, and the political predominance of the capital is here greater than in almost any country. In all Mubarak's political an-angements precaution is a conspicuous feature. The heads of his departments are mostly slaves ; his near relations are excluded from his counsels; even his sons wield no executive powers. The duty of interviewing foreigners is one which he never delegates to 'an agent, and without his previous consent no stranger can obtain information or facilities of any sort at Kuwait. An illustration of Mubarak's policy and firmness was afforded by his treatment about 1904 of some Central Arabians at Kuwait who had collected money and were preparing to found a Wahhabi mosqne: they were quickly compelled to relinquish their schemes under pain of death. Management of the few®.—In the town the smallest disputes, whether civil or criminal, are settled by the Shaikh himself. Murderers, unless they pay blood-money, are handed over to the relations of the victim for Qisas or retaliation in kind; if the victim has left no relations, the crimmal, unless he can satisfy the Shaikh by payment of a fine, is put in pnson and practically starved to death. In cases of theft the offender is generally allowed to escape with a fine; but, if he is poor and cannot pay, his hand is cut off according to Muhammadan law. Kape is puni shed with fine, beating or imprisonment: a woman guilty of adultery may lawfully be put to death by her husband, but the conduct of the co respondent cannot be called in question. Shaikh Mubarak is zealous in e enforcement of the Muhammadan prohibition against strong liquor, 6 ' iaS Sported from Kuwait a relation of his own as well as other Muslims who were addicted to drinking; but foreigners are free from m 0 ereilCe ln res P ect both of their religion and of their social customs. Management of the tribes, etc.—The Bedouins are held to their V gifts and kindness, partly by fear of the untoward with V J ^ enSUe ' either direCtly 0r from a rupture Kut ' 10 ^ 11218 allied himself matrimonially to the edln '1 W ' 10 are importance in Najd and are generally reprpsent- uwait territory by encampments in Summan or, in the hot 3 z 2 A1076 KUWAIT PRINCIPALITY weather, at the head of Kuwait Bay. During the recent hostilities in Najdthe Shaikh is believed to have supplied Ibn Sa'ud with 3,000 rifles, worth $150,000 ; the terms of the transaction are unknown, but its effect was undoubtedly to ingratiate him with the rising power in Najd and even to place him, for the time being, in the position of a patron. Military resource^.' —The Shaikh's fighting force in war consists of the best levy he can raise from the tribes subject to his influence; but he also possesses a sort of standing army, armed with rifles, who defend his person, perform his errands in the country and supply the town guard at Kuwait. These are about 100 in number and are mostly footmen. Revenue, —There is no distinction in Kuwait between the State revenues and the privy purse of the ruler, nor, of course, are any accounts of revenue and expenditure made public. The following is a careful estimate by a Persian merchant settled at Kuwait of the Shaikh's annual receipts, of which a large proportion are in kind:— I Produce of date plantations at FaO . . . 108,000 Rent of shops in the Kuwait bazaar . . 9,000 Zakat on Bedouin flocks , , . &gt; 25,000 Tax on sheep brought into the town . , . 2,000 Tax payable by butchers , . . , 2,500 Tax on camels brought to the town for sale . 1,500 Sea customs ... ... 150,000 Duties on exports to the interior . . . 20,000 Tax payable by pearl divers* .... 60,000 Pines 6,000 Share of fish brought into Kuwait . . . Interest on money lent to merchants . . . 8,000 Total . $ 399,000 The Shaikh denies receiving anything from pearl divers or by way of interest on money lent; but it was generally stated at Kuwait in 1904 that he took one diver's share from each pearl boat, and that he had lent a large sum at 20 per cent, interest to a local Arab merchant named Shamlan. It is believed that the Shaikh is building up a large private fortune. Besides valuable plantations at Fao he owns some 300 shops and waie- • According: to g different authority the proceeds of the peal diving tax ard only worth $ 20,000 a year on the average.LAFT 1077 houses in Kuwait TWu and he is supposed to be accumulating large sums in specie; as far as can be ascertained he meets current expenses out of current revenue and converts the balance into Turkish gold. His savings have greatly increased since the acute stage of the war in Eajd was passed; for he now spends much less than formerly on his Bedouin allies. Singular is Kuwari . A tribe found chiefly in Qatar, but KUWARAH- therearea few of them in Bahrain also. In Qatar they have ^50 (AL-BU-) houses at Sumaismah, nearly 150 at Dha'ain, 100 at Fuwairat and JJ 20atDohah; in Bahrain there are now only about 10 houses at laharraq Town and the same at Hadd.

Provisions in small quantities are available; livestock comprise about 20 camels, 15 donkeys, 40 cattle and 50 sheep and goats; and there are about 1,200 date trees. A rough estimate of the local shipping is given in the article on Qishm Island. There are three ordinary mosques, but the place has no local shrine. The hill behind Laft is scarped and the scarps are strength ened at their crests with curtains and flanking works which, with a dilapi dated fort having 6 circular towers pierced for guns, appear to be traces of some foreign occupation.

Territory. —The Bani Lam country proper is the plain between the Persian hills (or Pusht-i-Kuh) and the left bank of the Tigris river from a point opposite Shaikh Sa'ad down to 'Amarali Town. In 'Iraq, however, parties of the tribe are found as far to the west and north as Badrah, Zorbatiyah and even Mandali; while in 'Arabistan their ordinary limit is the Karkheh river between Pa-i-Pul on the north and the Hawizeh District on the south., but they sometimes range as far as the Shaur fiver, especially below Khairabad. A detached colony of the Lawaimi section even exists beyond the Karun^ on the Malih at a few miles south-east of Nasiri ; and there is another, still more distant, at the village of Mirbacheh. in the Ramuz District. In 'Iraq both banks of the Tigris above the country of the Bani Lam are inhabited by the Bani Rabl'ah, and below it by the A1 Bu Muhammad ; on the south-west the Bani Lam are in contact with the Mimtafik, and on the north-east they are adjoined by the Faili LufSj with some or other of whose sections they are generally at feud. The tribal centre is in the Qadha of Dawairij, where Ghadhban-bin- Banaiyah, the chief Shaikh, has his residence in a tract known as «D Shamariyah ; and the dealings of the tribe are mostly with 'Amarah Town and 'Ali-al-Gharbi upon the Tigris. which 'Iraq numbers. —The Bani Lam consist of numerous sections have not generally, it is said, separate habitats, but live inter- ► The principal divisions of the tribe, as understood on the side, are the following ;— 1. ; Abdul Khan. 7* Khumais. 2. ; Abdush Shah. 8.

Besides the above there is a family called Bait Jandil to which one or two of the secondary Shaikhs belong. The A1 Bu Daraj Jl ; a tribe who inhabit the right bank of the Tigris from Kumait down to a point opposite 'Ainarah Town, are sometimes reckoned a section, of the Bani Lam; so also are a portion of the Maqasis whom others treat as Bani Rabi'ah {q.v.) ; and part of the Sagwand division of the Western Lurs is at present regarded, notwith standing the difference of race, as connected with the Bani Lam. On the side towards 'Arabistan the Bani Lam appear to be classi fied as below:— Division. Sabdivision, Habitat of subdivision. Fighting strength of 8 'iMiviBion.

Shabaikah % - Do. 300 In regard to the Lawaimi division above it may be noted that they have not now any apparent political connection with the main body of the tribe. The Sarkhah are not of very much importance: their Shaikh Mushattat has friendly relations with some of the Sagwand Lurs, and a few settled Sarkhah are found at Jirqeh Saiyid Ta'ameh in the Bizful District of ''Arabistan. The number of fighting men of the tribe in 'Arabistan is thus approximately 8,000, and from a comparison of various discrepant accounts their military strength in 'Iraq would seem to be about 10,000. In view, however, of the indefiniteness of the Turco-Persian boundary and of the mobility of some of the sections of the Bani Lam, it is probable that the two estimates to a great extent overlap : consequently it is not necessary to estimate the fighting strength of the tribe at more than 15,000 men or their total number at more than 45,000 souls. Mode of life and -Except the Kinanah division, who (unless those settled at Mirbacheh) are entirely pastoral in their habits^ the majority of all sections of the Bani Lam are agricultural and live by growing cereals. The tribe as a whole have not yet, however, abandoned the nomad life j for neither houses nor huts but only hair tents are found among them, and they migrate towards the hills in the cold weather and are on the move from February to June. Wheat, barley, oats, maize, millet, Mash and lentils are among their crops, but they have not much rice : their cultivation is shifting and desultory. The camels and horses of the Bani Lam are among the best in 'Iraq ; of horses their best breeds are the Hargah, Nasbah and Wadhnah, the two former being, it is said, a monopoly of the tribe. They have also buffaloes, cattle, sheep and donkeys and supply most of the ghi for which 'Amarah Town is famous. The livestock of theLAM (BANI) 1085 Zighaib subdivision are said to consist exclusively of buffaloes, and tlie Ka'ab Bait ^Amir are also among 1 the buffalo-owning sections. The horses possessed by that portion of the tribe which is connected with 'Arabistan rather than with Iraq has been estimated at 1,500 and their camels at 3,000. Political position and military Bani Lam are with a few exceptions, Shi'ahs; by some of them Persian is spoken as well as Arabic, but they are not to any appreciable extent bilingual. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted both within the tribe and against outsiders. The tribe, as a whole, show great respect for their Shaikhs, to whom they are said to be blindly submissive both in peace and war; and though much divided among themselves by feuds and factions they do not fail to combine against outsiders. Their present head Ghadhban is described as 'notoriously rich and brave, but a rude and violent savage without the experience or the moderation that age gives : » he appears to have a permanent good understanding with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. On the Turkish side of the border the Bani Lam are generally quiet, but the Ottoman Government dare not put much pressure on them ; and though the revenue collector is treated with outward respect he does not always succeed in recovering the demand in full. In Persia the Bani Lam give much trouble to the authorities and seldom pay any revenue. In 'Iraq, where they are probably the largest, the most powerful and the richest tribe next to the Muntafik, the land assessment of the Bani Lam is one-tenth to one-fifth in kind of agricultural produce, and they are also subject to a trifling annual tax in cash per head of livestock : these imposts are generally farmed out to the Shaikhs of the tribe who collect as much as they can. In both countries the Bani Lam are noted for their predatoiy tenden cies, but in reality the greater part of the tribe lead a peaceful and icspectable life.^ The proceedings of the lawless minority are said, how ever to be connived at by the Shaikhs, who even accept a one-fifth share ffi e proceeds of their raids and robberies.

The Bani Lam are now well supplied with modern rifles, chiefly Martinis, and are considered to be good shots, especially from the saddle. It is estimated that on the Persian side about one-third of the fighting men are mounted and two-thirds are armed with rifles; on the Turkish side the proportion of mounted and unmounted men is said to be about equal. LARAK* Also pronounced Larach and in English formerly spelt 'Larrack.' An island in the Persian Gulf, 20 miles south by east of Bandar 'Abbas and partially closing the marine approach to that place from the south between Qishm and Hormuz. The channel between Larak and Qishm to the north-west of it is 6 miles, and that between Larak and Hormijz to the north-north-east 11 miles broad. Larak is oval in shape and mea sures 6 miles from east-north-east to west-south-west by about 4 miles across; the chief irregularity of outline is a small sandy cape which juts out from the north coast. The island is closely surrounded by deep water except on the west side, from which a shore reef extends for about 4 a mile. The interior consists of a mass of rugged hills of sandstone, with an admixture of rock salt and red oxide of iron, and is almost entirely destitute of vegetation; the highest summit, a mile from the north shore, is 510 feet high, and another, a mile to the south-west of it, is hardly inferior in elevation. There is no vegetation, and sweet water, with the exception of that of the Salmi well, is not found except in reservoirs. Wild gazelle, however, are numerous; they are supposed to obtain what moisture they require from dew. The inhabitants of Larak, about 200 in number, are Dhahuriyin; but they are closely connected by intermarriage with the Bani Shatair Shihuh of Kumzar and they speak the Kumzari language. There is no trade except in salt, of which some quantity is exported to the adjoining district of Ruus-al-Jibal in the Sultanate of ^Oman and to Qishm Town, the latter being the market in which the inhabitants of Larak make most of their purchases. The people assert that they are independent of any ruler except of their own Kumzari Shaikh at Labtiyab village, and up to the end of 1905 no visible signs of Persian authority existed, but the island was said to be nominally included, along with the island s^ * A plan of the greater part of Larak is giTen as an inset in Admiralty Oharfc No. 2373-2837 A., Persian Gulf, and a distant xiew of the island from the sea Wil found in the same.LARAK 1087 Qishm and Hormuz^ among 1 the places farmed to the Mu^m-ut-Tujjar of Tehran,* Larak seems to have been at one time ocenpied by a non-Muhammadan people ; for a flat-topped hill on the east coast is covered with hundreds of graves, all of which lie east and west.

The coast of the dsv ^j Lingeh District appears to be identical with the Sif 'Umarah of the DISTRICT* mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers, so called in the 1 Oth century A.D. after an Arab tribe from the opposite side of the Ghilf who had occupied itf. Limits. —On the east and «oiith the Lingeh district is bounded by the sea; on the west by a line which runs inland in a northerly direction from the coast between Duvvan and Mughu. The northern border is constituted by the great maritime range, described in the article on the Shibkuh district; which after passing behind Lingeh terminates in the sea at Purghar, a few miles north of the eastern end of Qishm Island, Lingeh district has thus a length from west to east of about 40 miles ; and its maximum breadth between the mountains and the sea, a little to the west cf Lingeh Town, is about 25 miles. The island of Sirri is attached for administrative purposes to the Lingeh district. Physical features. —The bulk of the district is a plain slightly elevated about sea level, of which the centre is occupied by a great salt marsh called Muhrakun ^ 20 miles long* from west to east and 10 miles in breadth. The plain has, as it were, a raised rim along the sea coast; this rim falls somewhat steeply to the marsh, but on the outer side it declines to the sea-shore as a barren sloping glacis. The ordinary height of this barrier between coast and interior is only 200 to 400 feet, but 10 miles north-east of Lingeh Town and at Jabal Bustaneh 10 miles west of the same place it rises in hills having the respectable elevation of 1,017 and 1,800 feet, respectively. With the exception of the highest part of the former, which is of light colour and jagged outline, these two hills present a generally dark and volcanic appearance. The rainfall in the Lingeh district is slight and the climate is cooler, healthier and pleasanter than that of Bandar 'Abbas. Population* —The people of the district are principally Persians of various tribes and trace their origin to Lar, Galehdar and other places m the interior ; Arab tribes, however, occur, such as the Al 'Ali and Maraziq, who are noticed in the article on the Shlbkuh district, and the Qawasim of Duvvan. Outside the town of Lingeh and Kung and * The first is the Persian, the Second the Arabic form of the name. t Vide Le Strange's Lands of the EasternLINGEH DISTRICT 1089 H Duwail; which are the principal places in the district and are separately described, the population is almost entirely Sunni of the Shafi'i school. 1 i The total population of the Lingeh district, including Lingeli Town and ^1 gjrri island, is probably about 20,000 souls. On the coast pearl-diving, sea-fishing and the carrying trade are the chief occupations, except in Lingeh Town, of which the inhabitants depend mainly on foreign trade. Away from the sea the population is agricul tural and pastoral. The houses, where they are not mere huts, are mostly of stone. K :* Agriculture, trade and shipping. —Dates are the chief crop, aad the palms in the Lingeh district are estimated at about 180,000. Trade is concentrated in Lingeh Town, in the article upon which it is described. As will be apparent from the topographical table at the end of this article, the district (Sirri island being included) possesses about 143 vessels of sea-going types and about 222 of smaller sizes. Of the former 57 are pearl boats which cross the (inlf in the season to work upon the Arabian side, the balance being employed in the carrying trade ; and the latter, from Lingeh Town westwards, are used for local pearl* ing operations as well as for fishing. Supplies and transport, —Supplies, except at the larger places, are not abundant. Water is obtained from reservoirs and wells ; the latter are ordinarily from 5 to 8 fathoms in depth. The transport animals of tbedistrict may be estimated at not less than 500 camels and 400 donkeys. Routes. —Lingeh Town is connected with Mughu by a coast route passable for all arms, and with Bastak (and so with Lar) by a route which up to the border of the Lingeh district is also passable foi all arms.* The Muhrakun salt marsh which lies upon the latter route is traversable by animals in summer, but in winter it must either be avoided or crossed in boats. There is also a coast route to Khamir, Wt its character beyond Kung is uncertain, and at Purghar, between ^ and 30 miles from Lingeh Town, it becomes impassable at high tide in consequence of the sea rising against the side of the hill. L 'ion. —The Lingeh district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports who has his head-quarters at Bushehr Town ; his local repre sentative is a Deputy-Governor, very frequently changed, who is responsible Bee Routes in Pertia, I, Nos. 52 and 52A. 4 A' 1090 LINGKEH DISTRICT for the payment at Bushehr of about 150,000 Qrans annually as revenue. This revenue is assessed throughout the district upon date- groves and other cultivation, on the coast upon boats also; and in Lingeh Town warehouses and other places of business are taxed, while men and animals entering the place are laid under contribution by means of tolls, which are farmed. At present date trees pay J Qran each a year besides T V of their produce ; there is a poll tax on Nakhudas of Rs. per annum and on ordinary sailors of Rs. 4 ; and shops are assessed at Es. 4 to Rs. 8 a year. The general administration and collection of land-revenue are conducted by the Deputy-Governor through the Kalantar or headman of Lingeh Town and the Kadkhudas of villages. Criminal justice there is none, and the only form of civil justice is that dispensed by the ecclesiastical authorities. The power of the Deputy-Grovernor is supported by a military detachment of 14 infantry and of 6 artillerymen only, with ^ old muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns; besides these about 20 0 armed citizens of Lingeh Town can be called together for the defence of the place in an emergency. The Imperial Persian Customs have an important station in charge of a European at Lingeh and others depen dent on it at Bustaneh, Kung, Band Mu'allim and Birkeh Siflin and several places outside the Lingeh district. The annual gross receipts, which amount to about 500,000 Qrans, are distinct from the general revenue for which the Deputy-Governor is liable.

The surroundings are extraordinarily arid, and the background consists of an absolute desert rising gradually behind the town to a watershed of which somewhat prominent hills form the eastern and western extremities. no There is an eastern suburb upon the sea face called Ghariyeh , and one of the western quarters of the town is called Lmgiyeh. One of the chief features of the place is a number of Birkehs or domed cisterns which are scattered through the environs ^ these are circular reservoirs 20 or 30 feet deep for the storage of the water which in rainy weather ilows down from the desert at the back of the town. The anchorage is in 5 fathoms of water^ with good holding ground, at f of a mile from the beach; it is exposed to southerly and south easterly winds which sometimes make communication with the shore impossible, the waves then lasting full on the piers and the spray driving inland over the town. At a short distance to the west of the anchorage there is a email pearl bank, 200 yards off shore, in to SO feet of water. In1iaUtants.~~ T Vh.Q population at present amounts to 12,000 souls and is of a very composite character. The basis is Arab and is supposed to consist chiefly of immigrants from Trucial 'Oman, but Bahrain has contributed a quota of A1 Bu Samait, 'Utiib and DawSsir and there are also settlers from Kangun. Of these the A1 Bu Samait have 340 houses in the Ghariyeh suburb and 2 in the Lmgiyeh quarter. The remainder of the people of Lingeh are mostly Persians from the neigh bourhoods of Bastak and Lar, and the medley is completed by a con siderable negro admixture. The majority of the inhabitants are Sunnis 01 ^Wiabis: less than J are Shi^ahs.

Though the town is large its defensive strength is small. Arms are few and most of them, it is to be feared, are in undesirable hands. As a rule arms are not produced except on the incitement of Mallas and then not without the existence of personal interests to be served or the issue of injunctions by the Deputy-Govern or. Trade. Lingeh was until recently a trade emporium serving a large and important area. As a general centre for the collection and export of pearls it rivalled even Bahrain. As a point for the distribution of foreign goods, not only the adjacent districts of Persia but also the ports of Trucial 'Oman and Qatar and even, to some extent, those of the Batinah coast of Oman and of Bahrain were numbered among its clients. But the rigorous regime of the reformed Persian Customs and the partial application of the customs tariff to the transit trade on which the place depended appear to have set a term, at least for the pre sent, to its prosperity; and the towns of Trucial 'Oman formerly among its leading 'constituents, are now turning to Dibai, which the establish ment of direct steam communication with India and the absence of official barassments have at length enabled to compete with Lingeh upon favourable terms. It is estimated that goods imported direct at Dibal can be sold there 10 per cent, cheaper than similar goods imported through Lingeh. To save themselves from utter ruin most of the leading merchants of Lingeh have established agencies in Trucial 'Oman, by means of which they hope to retain a part of their former business; and it seems probable that, unless the Persian Government take steps to lemove the causes of the decline, Lingeh will shortly be reduced to the position of a merely local port. The tract of which the trade is naturally dependent on Lingeh lies to the north-west of it, including Bastak and Lar and not extending beyond Jahrum, a distance of little over 150 miles. The actual number of shops in Lingeh is 455 and of other business premises 28 ; of the shops the greater number are for the sale of cloth and provisions. Exports from Lingeh by sea consist of carpets, rose-buds^ flax-seed tobacco, gum-tragacanth, gum-arabic, assafcetida and a little dried fruit from Jahrum, Ishkani, Tarakameh and Galehdar : they are shipped chiefly to Indian and Turkish ports, but some of the assafcetida, gum-tragacanth and gum-arabic goes direct to the United Kingdo m. Mother-of-pearl shells are despatched also to London and Hamburg as well as to India, The value of the exports between 1901 and 1903 was about £101,000 per annum, exclusive of transit trade.LINGEH TOWN Imports, except pearls and a certain quantity of piece-goods which are received direct from England and Germany, are all from India: the principal of these are rice, wheat, barley, ghi, sugar, loaf-s agar, sugar- candy, spices, linen, silk, and cloth of all sorts. Imports, not including goods imported for re-exportation, were worth between 1901 and 1903 about £146,000 a year. The following figures, showing (in lacs of rupees) the average annual imports and exports of Lingeh from 1899 to 1906 in the principal branches of trade, place the character of Lingeh as merely a port of transit in a clear light:— Commodity.

The currency is that of Persia, but the Indian rupee, Maria Theresa dollar, Turkish Lirah and English sovereign also circulate. r.—The carrying trade of Lingeh, in the past considerable, appears not unlikely to fall off in the future in sympathy with the general export and import business. At the present time 2 sailing barques, 19 Baghlahs, 4 Grhunchahs, 15 Sambuks, 20 Batils, etc., 10 Baqarahs, 15 Shu'ais and 20 Ballams and Varjis belong to the port, besides 22 lighters ; the last are Sambuks, Baqarahs and jolly-boats. In 1905-06 steam vessels to the number of 67 with a tonnage of 73,700 visited the port of Lingeh : of these all but 4 were British. other than trade, -—The principal resource of Lingeh apart from commerce and navigation is the pearl fishery : included in the statement of shipping above are about 30 pearl boats of size (Sambuks, Batils and Baqarahs) which cross the Gulf to work on the Arabian side. The sea fisheries are of some value and employ 45 vessels of a smaller build, which are also used for pearling along the Persian coast. Date culture is of considerable importance, but other cultivation is insignificant 111 consequence of the paucity of the means of irrigation. There are some mechanics and artisans, and Lingeh is said to be the best place in the Gulf to have iron-work made or necessary repairs to ships executed; hut the workmanship is rude.LIE AVI S-T^ LIN&amp;EH TOWN 1100 transport an communications and land transport are dealfc with in the article on Lingeh District, and the nature of the sea-communications may be gauged by the remarks on shipping above. The water of Lingeh is generally abundant; that from wells however is brackish, and for drinking purposes the water of the Birkehs is almost exclusively used. The Birkehs appear to have a capacity of about 60^000 gallons each, but at times they are nearly empty. Cattle, poultry, vegetables, rice, flour and firewood are available in some quantity. Administration. —Lingeh, as one of the Gulf Ports, is subject to the Governor of that division, but it is administered by a local Deputy- Governor. The nature of his administration is described in the article on Lingeh District. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here; and there is a small Persian garrison, as already mentioned in the article on Lingeh District, besides whom about 200 armed citizens can he mustered by order of the Deputy-Governor for the defence of the town. British interests. —British subjects at Lingeh are 1 European; ^6 Hindus ; 56 Muhammadan Indians, Kh5jahs ; and 35 other iMuhamma- dans. Traders under British protection are 21 Hindus, 8 Khojahsand4 other Muhammadans. This is the only district of the Behbehan province upon the Persian Coast ; it separates the Southern 'Arabistan district of Hindiyan from the Gulf Ports district of Hayat Davud. Limits. —L iravi extends along the Persian Gulf from a point about 7 miles north of Dllam to Sabzpushan 31 miles south-south-east of that place; and it is bounded inland by a low maritime range, which at the north end of the district is about 6, and at the south end about 18 miles from the sea ; this range rises to about 1,000 feet behind Dllam. Thysical characteristics. —The principal points on the coast are Has-at- Fanb or Tanub j ^ miles south of Dllam, a low sandy point; Khor Lailatain, a small creek 1 mile south-east of Ras-at-Tanb; Khor Sini another small creek with deep water inside, 8 milesLIR AVI 1101 south-south-east of Khor Lailatain * ; finally Sabzpushan, a slightly projecting rocky point which has a small water-course on the south of it and is itself 18 miles south-south-east of Khor Sini. The most striking object in the interior of the district is Jabal Bang vJaj or Bag an isolated group of hills rising to a point 1.000 feet hig-h at a distance of 24 miles south-south-east from Dllam and 3 miles from the coast; these hills stretch for 1^ miles parallel to the coast, are precipitous on the seaward side ; and contain salt and gypsum.t Apart from Jabal Bang and the hills which form the inland boundary the whole district is low and flat and consists of plains, sometimes grassy, with an occasional outcrop of light-grey sandstone. The heat of summer is, it is said, not excessive ; and the winter resembles that of Bushehr. Water everywhere is from wells. The Liravi coast south of Has-at-Tanb can ordinarily be approached to within 1 mile by vessels of moderate size. Population, —A table of villages which is subjoined shows that the fixed inhabitants of Liravi are chiefly of Lur and Arab blood. Their number is probably about 6,000 souls, inclusive of the inhabitants of Dilam and its dependent villages. The people are all Shi^ahs unless, as is reported, there are a few Babis at Shehr-i-Yiran. They are quiet, free from fanaticism, and engaged for the most part in agriculture or sea faring occupations. Martini rifles are numerous, there being, it is said, one rifle on the average to each house in the interior, and on the coast about 3 rifles to every 2 houses. Dwellings outside of Dilam are nearly all huts. During the six winter months the district is visited by the Darashuli and Kashkuli Iliyat ^ULI, nomadic hill tribes whose summer quarters are in the valley of Bibi Hakimeh 30 or 40 miles inland from the coast. Agriculture and trade. —Wheat, barley, dates and tobacco are the chief products, and of the first two a certain surplus is ordinarily available for export. Cattle, sheep and goats are fairly numerous. The exports and imports are those described in the article on Dllam. There is no internal trade. Currency, weights and measures are the same as those # It would seem natural to identify Kbor Sini with the ancient Siniz had not Mr. Le Strange, wno is the best authority, already fixed upon Dilam as marking its Bite. Siniz was sacked bj the Carmathians in 933 A. D., but recovered its prosperity for a time : it was eel ibr^ted in the middle ages for the manufacture of a special kind of gauze, also of linen stu^s.

Liravi is believed to possess about 200 horses, 100 camels and 2,000 donkeys. The best known route is one which traverses the district longitudinally from Shehr-i-Viran to Kinar-i- Kuh at some distance from the coast; the marching by this is easy and there are numerous convenient halting-places.* Administration. —The district is ruled by a Khan (at present Hasan Shah Quli) who has his residence at the village of Chah Tahl and is subordinate to the Governor of Behbehan. There are no Persian officials in his territory and he manages the villages through their Kadkhndas or headmen. One of the Khan^s sons is posted at Hisar as his father's deputy. Land-revenue appears to be collected, on actual cultivation only, at the rate of 20 to 60 Qrans per Gau.

LUR y TEIBE1110 LUil TRIBE The Bakhtiyaris are a division of the Lurs, but they are generally mentioned by their own name, and throughout this Gazetteer—except where the contrary may be indicated by the context—the term Luris used to denote only those Lurs who are not Bakhtiyaris. The Lurs, in this restricted sense, may be divided into Western Lurs and It astern Lurs the Karun river being taken as the line of demarcation, and the Bakhtiyaris or Central Lurs being between, Western Lurs.* —The home of the Western Lurs is the mountainous tract between the Dizful District and Khurramabad ; but in winter tliey descend in considerable numbers to the plains of Dizful where, as the table of the villages in that district indicates, many of them have now become permanently resident. The principal sections of the Western Lurs with whom we are concerned are the Dinarwand Dirakwand Faili and Sagwand . Settled Dinarwands are found at ^Abbasabad and 'Amleh Karim Khan in the Dizful District; but the headquarters of this section, said to be of Kurdish descent, appear to be at Dih Luran i^I ^ , where they are subject to the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. The Dirakwands are a turbulent, marauding and entirely nomadic section, who are generally on bad terms with their neighbours, including the Bakhtiyaris, and do not emerge from the hills except for purposes of robbery ; in the Dizlui District the village of Bun war Nazir has been plundered by them once, and that of Sar Bisheh (a Bakhtiyari possession) several times. About 1902 the Dirakwands looted the Bakhtiyari village of Gotwand in the Shushtar District, the Bakhtiyaris ii 1903 retaliating by a raid on Qilab in which a number of Dirakwands of a subdivision called Qalawand &lt;^115 were either killed or captured, In 1904 the British Military Attache from Tehran and the British Vice- Consul from Nasiri were attacked and robbed in the hills between Khurramabad and Dizful by a Dirakwand escort and narrowly escaped with their lives. The fighting strength of the Dirakwands is about 8,000 men of whoKi only J are true Dirakwands, the rest being refugees from other tribes. A few Eaili Lurs are found at Qal'eh ; Abbas in the Dizful District, and Karim Khan of 'Amleh Karim Khan belongs to this section. b Sll ^ Full information about tlie Western Lurs will be found in the Proceedings of the Government of I«dia in the Foreign Department for October 1904, in repotts by Lieutenant D. L. K. Lorimer, dated 29th June and 4th July 1904LUR TRIBE 1111 It is understood that the Failis claim to be Saiyids descended from Hazrat 'Abbas, and that the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh is himself of their number. The Sagwands are among* the most powerful of the sections of the Western Lurs and numbers of them are settled in villages of the Dizfui District; especially at Qal'eh 'Abbas, 'Abbasabad, Qareh Haji 'Ali; 'Ali- ibn-al-Hiisain ; Anjireh, Aqa Abu Talab, Asad Khan (II), Bisheh Nau, Cbugiieli Sabz; QaFeh Farrash, Jibar, Kalehwand, ; Amleli Kariue Khan, Khizar Baigi, Kutiyan, Muradi, Qareh Qazi, QaVeli Saiyid, Salarabad, Bunwar Shami, Sharafabad and Jirqeh Saiyid Ta'ameh ; the village of QaFeh H aji' Ali is partially owned by the Sagwand chief Khanjan Khan. In winter nomadic Sagwands, up to the number of perhaps 15,(j00 souls ; encamp in the plains to the west of Dizlul Town ; and the country between the Diz and Karkkeh rivers, where they are found as far south as Shush, is then fairly safe ; this section, however, do not cross to the east of the Diz river. Besides innumerable sheep and goats the Sagwands own cattle of a very small breed, which they use chiefly as beasts of burden. They took a considerable part in the French excavations at Shush about 1903-04. The absence of men of any influence or enlightenment among the Western Lurs makes it difficult to maintain satisfactory political relations with them as a body; a large section of the Sagwands, however, headed as they are at present by Khanjan Khan, are an exception to the ordinary rule, The inhabitants of Dizfui Town, in view of cultivation which they possess at Mazra'eh Saliha bad, ordinarily find it worth while to purchase the friendship of the neighbouring Lurs 4 Eastern Lurs. —The Eastern Lurs occur in the Ramuz ; Ma'shur and Hindiyan Districts of 'Arabistan, and in the Liravi, Hay at Davud, Rud-hilleh, Angali and even Dashti districts of the Persian Coast ; in most of the latter they are popularly regarded as immigrants from Behbehan. The Lurs of the Ramuz District, so far as they are not Bakhtiyaris, chiefly belong to a division called Kuhgalu of which sections known as Bagdali , Bahmai , Bair Ahmadi ^ Agha Jari Ul and Taibi are found there. The buis of the Hindiyan District appear to be all, or nearly all, Agha Jaris. ^ oj ne of the Lurs in the Angali District belong to a section called N ui 'i?,\ among those who do are the ruling family. The principal ^visions, in the hills, of the Eastern Lurs aro the Kuhgalus, who adjoin e Bakhtiyaris on the south-east, and the Mamasanis , who re 111 C0I ^act with the Kashkai , a tribe of reputed Turkish originIll2 LUU TRIBEl occupying the country to the south of Shiraz. As far south at least as the district of Hayat Davud extends, the Lurs are distinguishable by the peculiar dialect of Persian which they speak. LUSAIL A village on the east coast of Qatar about 15 miles north of Dohah: the principal residence at the present time of Shaikh Jasim, the head of the Al Thani family of Qatar. About 500 yards inland of the place is Jabal Lusail, a rocky hillock of some height^ which forms a landmark well known to mariners. On the summit of Jabal Lusail is a double- storeyed tower which can be seen from several miles inland; and at tlie foot of the hill are three wells, one on the north and two on the west side; the water of these is extremely brackish. The village of Lusail consists of about 50 substantial stone and mud houses of Hamaidat and 2 or 3 of MVadhid, the latter being personal retainers of the Shaikh. To the village belong 9 pearl boats, 2 other sea-going vessels, and 3 fishing boats. Animals of transport are 20 horses and 70 camels. The house of the Shaikh stands about 200 yards to the south of the village: it was built about 1901 and is a four-sided, high-walled building of stone and plaster, adjoined by a few yards and Out-houses and by a small mosque. By courtesy it is called a fort, but it contains no guns. MA^ADHID Singular Ma'adhadi . It is difficult to decide whethel' the Ma 5 ad hid (or rather a part of them) should be treated as a distinct tribe or should be regarded as a section of the Al Bin -'Ali tribe of Bah rain and Qatar. In Qatar the Ma'adhid are said to be nearly related by blood to the Al Bu Kuwarah, who like themselves claim descent from the Bani Tamim. From the article on the Al Bin -'Ali it will be apparent that the Ma^adhid comprise at least 7 families, of which 1 has recently become extinct. Of the 6 remaining, the Al 'Ali, Al Talah and Al Thani deny relationship with the Al Bin -'Ali; the 'Aslriyin and Al Fadhal on the contrary seem to admit it; and the Al Bin-Muqbil are divided, a few who live in Muharraq Island (but not apparently the remainder) professing themselves Al Bin -^Ali. The Ma'adhid who claimMA'AWAL (WADI) 1113 independence of the A1 Bin -Ali do not fly the so-called Salaimi flag whicli is cttmaion to the rest of that tribe. The prineipal settlements of the Ma'adMd in Qatar are at Dohah, 100 houses; WaKrah, 70 houses; and Lusail—where their chief now lives—about 5 houses. In Bahrain they are found at Muliarraq Town and Hadd. The different families ofthe Ma'adhid live intermingled in their various settlements. In religion most of the Ma'adhid are Maliki Sunnis, but their Shaikh has become a Hanbali—that is in reality a Wahhabi-—and some of the tribe have gone with him in his change of belief. By occupation the Ma'adhid are either pearl merchants, pearl divers, sailors, or breeders of camels and cattle. Jasim of the Al Thani family is Shaikh of the tribe, and at the same time the most important and influential personage in the whole peninsula of Qatar. Singular Ma'awali Jy-*. A tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, Hinawi MA'AWAL m polities and Ibadhi by religion, found in Wadi Ma'awal in Western J.U^ Hajar where they own the villages of Afl (1,000 houses) ; 'Araiq (40 louses), Musilmat (300 houses), and part of Hibra (80 houses), also at Khabhah (150 houses) and Barkah (20 houses), in Batinah. There is moreover a Bedouin section, called the Yal Bin Rashid ^ ^ JO, w h 0 own about 60 camels, 20 donkeys, 30 cattle and 600 sheep and goats. The Ma'awal number altogether about 8,000 sovds ; Afl is the tribal capital and the present Tamimah is Nasir-bin-Muhammad. The Jalandite wlers of 'Oman, who flourished at the time of the conversion of the couutiy to Muhammadanism or somewhat earlier, are supposed to have belonged to this tribe. ofsma11 valle y s in the Western Hajar district of the MA'AWAL absence f ^ ^ disp0sition of wllicl:1 ^ is impossible, in the (WADI) apnea,t ^ t0 gail1 a clear i&lt;iea ' tlle dr ainage of the system LU* , combme and find a common outlet to the sea imm J iate]y ^ Sai'kah.

MADA1K A collective name for some ruined sites in Turkish 'Iraq upon both banks of the Tigris^ 30 to 84 miles below Baghdad City by river and 20 miles from it south-south-eastwards by land. The remains on the right bank represent the Macedonian town of Seleucia, those on the left the Parthian town of Ctesiphon. According to the Arab geographers there were for merly 7 towns at this place ; but in the 9th century of the Christian era only 5 of them were still extant. About 903 A.D. large quantities of stone were carried off from the ruins of Madain for use at Baghdad, yet in the 10th century Madain was still inhabited and fairly populous. The only building of which a considerable portion now remains standing i s the winter palace of the Parthian kings, known as Taq Kisra : the vaulted central hall and the half of the facade on the proper right are still standing, but the left facade has fallen since the British survey of I860- 65. Near the left bank of the river a little above Ctesiphon is the tomb of Salman Pak one of the companions of the prophet Muham mad and i said to have been his barber^ MADHA- An Arab tribe in Bahrain, said to have come from Qatar where HAKAH some still remain.

Position, extent, and 'physical features, —Mahadhah is probably situated 15 to 20 miles north-east of the Baraimi Oasis, but its exact position is uncertain. Its level is said to be somewhat higher than that of Baraimi; and its extent is described as about 6 miles in any direction. According to native accounts it is surrounded by hills, which are high upon the east and south sides and low upon the west and north; its soil is of clay mixed with stones, the western portion of the plain being less stony than the eastern: and its drainage escapes westwards^ through openings in the hills, to the sandy desert- that lies inland from the west coast of Trucial ^Oman. Topography of Mahddhah and surrounding country, —The plain of Mahadhah contains only one village, also named Mahadhah, which is described in the table below; but a number of settlements of the Bani Ka'ab and other points of interest exist in the neighbourhood and can be most conveniently dealt with in the same tabled Name.

Mahmudiyah was founded about 40 years ago by one Saiyid Ja'far of Ba^Mad, who built the first Khan ; and it soon superseded the stages ofXhan Azad and Khan-al-Bir which were respectively nearer to and further from Baghdad on the way to Karbala. The original inhabit ants were a few Bani Rabi'ah Arabs who migrated from Khan-al-Bir; kt Mahmudiyah is now a considerable and increasing place with 11 Khans^ a dozen shops, about 150 houses^ and a population of perhaps } 0 souls. The Khans are mostly defensible, one of them being partly oop holed and provided with circular towers at the four corners ; iii the W e gate they would provide accommodation for about 1,000 men and the same number of animals. go ^ lnana £ er 0 f the Dairat-as-Sanlyah resides here and has under him. ^ me ^ noun ^ Dhabitiyahs and a few regular soldiers for the work of the PP ment.

The island is a mere sand bank 2 miles long by 1 broad^ devoid of vegetation, except mangroves and of potable water ; the mangroves grow on a mud-flat, screening the island from view seawards and extending ronnd | of its circumference. The village consists of about 50 huts of mangrove boughs and there is one mosque roughly built of stone. The inhabitants are Hikman and a few Januabah ; they maintain a perpetual feud with the A1 Wahibah of the adjoining mainland; their semi-insular position protects them from sudden attacks. Water is fetched daily by slaves in earthen vessels from wells under a low hill on the mainland 4 miles to the northward. Mahot is the principal trade centre of this part of the 'Oman coast and in particular the market in which the inhabitants of the coast from Masirah to the Kuria Muria islands purchase their dates j its unimportance is in proportion to that of the district which it serves, There are no regular shops and few large boats ; but caravans constantly visit the place from Adam, the nearest point in 'Oman Proper, distant from Mahot 7 days' journey by way of Wadi Halfain which reaches the sea, it is believed, a little to the north-east of Mahot, These caravans bring dates and cotton twist and take away fish. Animals at Mahot are 10 camels, 10 donkeys, 20 cattle and 30 sheep and goats; there are 4 Baghlahs and 20 small fishing boats. In former days Mahot was a great place for the disembarkation of slaves, who were then smuggled into 'Oman by way of Wadi Halfain. Native sailing vessels passing between Aden or Zanzibar and the Persian Gulf used sometimes to call and ship cargoes of salt, made at E-as Sauqirah or Khor-al-Milh, or of salt fish, shark-fins and tortoise-shell, but this has become unusual.

These settlements are stated to be at present unoccupied. The settled population of Wadi Maih, exclusive of the village of Yiti W ich is on the coast, appears to be about 8,000 souls. Wadi Maih has only one important affluent, Wadi Jannah ^ or atat, which joins it on its left ba,nk from the south-west immediately below Tawilah.

Wadi-al -Hilu joins Wadi Maih on its east bank immediately below Yiti; but the junction being' so near the coast, it can hardly be reckoned a tributary. Wadi Maih below Tawilah contains a fast-flowing stream which irrigates the two villages of Mizra', but its aspect in its lower course is generally barren. The uppermost 7 villages are said to possess 30,000 date palms; and frankincense is stated to be obtained in their vicinity &gt; but this is doubtful.

In all the inhabitants may number about 3,500 souls. There are said to have been formerly as many as 60,000 date palms, but many of these have perished of drought in recent years and others have been cut down by the Wahhabi Amir. The water supply is described as scanty and precarious, and it is stated that there is only one well in the date plantations west of the town which can be absolutely relied on; in dry seasons the use of it is authoritatively restricted. The only fruit trees other than dates which have successfully resisted the late drought are vines. Cereals, lucerne and melons are cultivated as in other villages of the Sadair district. The wells are from 6 to 12 fathoms deep according to rainfall. Live- stock belonging to the town are estimated at some 20 horses, 600 camels, 200 donkeys and 400 cattle, besides sheep and goat?. There is a bazaar of about 50 shops dealing in coffee, piece-goods, arms and ammunitionj etc. i trade relations are chiefly with Kuwait, but the local merchants have also dealings with those of 'Anaizah and Buraidah in Qasim. A direct route vid 'Wabrah leads from Majma to Kuwait lown.

Our subject then, as the title of the article indicates, is primarily the coast of Persian Makran, but the circumstances of the interior are of importance to us in so far as they serve to elucidate the physical, commercial and administrative position of the coastal tiact, and in that decree they will receive attention. Limits* —Persian Makran is bounded on the south by the Gulf of 'Oman and the Arabian Sea. On the west it extends to and includes Kuh Mubarak, and in the opposite direction it reaches to a point 8 miles east of Gwatar— the termination upon the coast of the frontier between at Jashkand its immediate neigbbourhood being entrusted to Dr. VV. C. McMillan, Assistant Surgeon at that place. From the information thus collected in 1904-05 draft articles aggregating 32 octavo pages of print were compiled and were sent in March 1906 to local officers for amplification and correction. The work of revision, which was heavy, was carefully carried out by Mr. R. H. New of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, Officiating Assistant Superintendent; and some fresh information was supplied bv Mr. Whitby Smith personally, and by Captain Tindall of the telegraph ship 'Patrick Stewart'. Amended drafts extending to 50 octavo pages were ready at the beginning of 1907 and underwent further revision during that year at the hands of Mr. Whitby Smith and Mr. New. Valuable assistance was lendered in 1905 and 1907 by Mr. R. Hughes-Bnller and Major C. P.

On the west Persian Makran meets the coast district of Biyaban t and the inland district of Bashakard in Persia ; on the east, as already indicated, it is conterminons with the territories of the Khan of Kalat, For present purposes it is unnecessary to define its northern boundary precisely, and it will suffice to state that eastwards of the district of Bashakard that boundary lies between the 27th and 28th parallels of north latitude. Physical char act eristics.% —The bulk of Persian Makran is a labyrinth of mountains, which in some places attain an elevation of over 6,000 feet, and through which various streams—in this country styled Kaurs j&gt;y—and valleys travel southwards by devious courses to the sea. The rocks are generally sandstone or a conglomerate of sand and shells; they contain no minerals. The larger streams are the Jagln, Gabrig, Sadaich, Rapch, Kair and Dashtyari Chil, which contain water more or less throughout the year ; the remainder are mere torrent beds which after rain are impassable for a day or two, from March to August contain water in pools, and thereafter become dry on the surface but still yield water at about 10 feet below ground. Water is most scarce in the part between Chahbar and the Chil river. The maritime plain, of which mention has already been made and with which we are more particularly concerned, is bounded on the inland side by a range of hills of which the average height appears to vary from 1,000 to 2,500 feet: this outer range, which has no general name, is not straight or continuous but nowhere does its distance from the sea much exceed 20 miles, and towards both extremities, as well as in the centre between the R^pch and Kair rivers, it approaches, with an elevation of over 1,500 feet, to within a few miles of the coast. It is composed ordi narily of a light-coloured clay with streaks of gypsum, and it is capped with sandstone which frequently contains fossil remains. The greater part of the maritime plain is a sandy wast3 diversified by long dunes of sand in certain localities ; but here and there occur * See Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. X, p. 17. f The ordinary natiTes of the country regard Biyaban as being included in Persian Makran, and that district may accordingly be considered to belong to Makran in the geographical sense of the term. J Remarks on particular physical features, such as the principal hills and rivers, Will be found in the separate article on Jashk District and ia the topographical table at the end of the present article-MAKRAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) 11S3 patches of alluvial soil, and the courses of the rivers, for the last 7 to 12 miles before reaching the sea, are usually characterised by considerable alluvial deposits. One large and two small mud volcanoes * are met with between the Bh and Kair rivers, and on tbe sea-beach, 15 miles east of New Jashk, there are some hot springs. The rise and fall of the tide upon the coast is 5 to 10 feet. Trees are not found on the plain except by the banks of rivers^ where tamarisks and acacias grow in profusion and even large banyans are sometimes found ; but grass and other small vegetation is fairly plentiful after rain. In the hills of the interior the Pish palm flourishes, and the banyan and even the mango occur in some inland valleys Fauna. —Wild animals include, in the neighbourhood of the coast, the leopard, wolf; jackal, fox, hysena, gnzelle; ibex and oorial, while black bears also are found in the more northern ureas. The bustard, black and grey partridge, cbikor, nsi, pigeon, dove, vulture, kite, falcon and raven are always found, and the wild duck, sandgrouse and quail at the seasons of their migration southward. The adder, scorpion, lizard, centipede and tarantula are all seen; also the viper, which is very common, and the black rock-snake, which is seldom met with. In some places mosquitoes are troublesome. Climate and seasons. —The cold weather lasts from October to April, the hot weather from May to October. From the observations at New Jashk and Chahbar in 1903 and 1904 it would seem that the maximum winter temperature on the coast varies from 87° to 94° Fahrenheit, and the maximum summer temperature from 94° to 110°. At New Jashk the thermometer has been known to fall in the cold weather to 44*3°. Rainfall is uncertain, but usually occurs in November, December, Januarv, and February, occasionally continuing into March : the annual rainfall has not been observed, but is probably on the average between 6 and 7 niches ; it differs considerably from place to place. In summer it would impossible for Europeans to sleep under canvas by day on account of the heat; while by night, wherever water exists, mosquitoes and other insect pests frequently make rest impossible. These are hillocks from 20 to 200 feet in height which emit at the top a mixture 0 ac ^ ls h bluish clay along with hot water and gases. They are most active ^ ien sea is rough upon the neighbouring coast.1134 MAKRAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) Inhahifants. —The country is peopled by a medley of tribes, mostly claiming to be descended from Arabs wbo either originally settled in Makran or removed thither from earlier settlements in Sind and Kacb. Thp following is an alphabetical table of the predominant tribes and classes :— Name. Supposed origin, etc. Distribution. E emabks. Birdi Mostly east of Chah' bar. The Birdis are camel, owners. Bizanju Brahuis. Do. Bizanjus are not nume ous in Persian Makran. Buzdar BaltieMs. In and around Chah- bar. In Persian Makran the Buzdars are mat- mak rs and own sheep and goats. Durzadah Considered to be aborigines. Chiefly to the east of Gaih. A low class, mostly emancipated slaves. Gichki v Said to be descended from a Sikh who left the P anjab in the seventeenth century and settled in the valley of Gichak ; another account makes them Kajputs. Mostly in the Qasr- kand district. The chief of Qasrkand belongs to this tribe. Gurgaij Said to be of Persian origin; but ac cording to an other account they are Baluchis. At Bahn Qalat and to the westward ol' it.

These are Swahili negro slaves and not properly a tribe. Singalau At Bir and in the Gaih district gen erally. A high class tribe, but few in numbers. The total population of Persian Makran is estimated at 114,000 souls * the ordinary fighting strength at 6,300 men armed with Martini and in some cases with magazine rifles ; and the additional fighting muster provided with inferior firearms at 19,500 men. Almost every adult carries a sword, pistol or revolver : only the lowest classes, that is, the fishermen and herdsmen, go unarmed. The people are all Muhammadans, and the vast majority belong to the Sunni persuasion, but there are some Shfahs chiefly from the Minab District, The Makranis are addicted to pilgrimages to local shrines, whereat they perform vows. Their customs are mostly in accordance with Muhammadan law; but in matters of inheritance children by mothers of inferior status do not ordinarily receive their full legal rights, Girls may not be married until the age of puberty, but they may he betrothed at an earlier age. In character the- people are peaceable and not naturally inclined to violence. Slavery still prevails in most parts of the country and freeborn families that do not own one or more slaves are * The district totals will be found in the separate article on the Jashk District arid ip the notices of the other districts towards the end of this article.MAKRAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) 1137 the exception. Most of the slaves are negroes—some with Baluchi blood—and are born in the servile condition ; of late years^ however, the enslavement of Bashakardis and low class Baluchis, mostly orphans, has become common. Their condition is ordinarily a mild form of domestic and agricultural serfdom ; but the slave has no voice in any matter whatever, and in case of his committing a murder his master may put him to death without reference t-o any authority. The spoken language of the country is a dialect of Baluchi called Makraai; it contains a considerable admixture of Persian and Arabic words and differs widely from the standard Baluchi spoken in Northern Baluchistan. It is sometimes reduced to Persian characters, but the ordinary medium of communication by writing is Persian, which all chiefs of districts can speak fairly well. Except the Mullas, the entire papulation is illiterate. Popular ballads in which the deeds of tribes, chiefs of districts and other heroes are extolled, together with songs, having similar themes and chanted by roving minstrels of the Lori tribe to the accompaniment of a kind of fiddle, supply the place of literature and the arts. Agriculture and Cultivation, in the maritime plain, is mostly confined to the beds and banks of rivers, where an alluvial soil exists accompanied by the means of irrigation, and to places under the hills where rain water is caught and utilised by means of embankments called Bands ^ ; there are no canals or regular wells, only water holes, and the crops depend almost entirely on rainfall, which is deScient on the average in three years out of every four. Near the coast the staple of cultivation is the date, but small quantities of wheat, barley, millet, and jowaii are grown j also some cotton. In the valleys of the interior the percentage of arable soil is larger and considerable quantities of dates, wheat, barley, jowari, millet, lentils, rice, and cotton are produced. The wintei crop of cereals is sown in November and reaped in March or April; there is no summer crop except dates. Manure is not used ; and 6 Cr013S fr'^ently suffer from the depredations of locusts and cater- P ais. A wooden plough, resembling that of India but much smaller ^ is the principal implement of agriculture; field labour is fro ty R Pe ! foimedb y ^ om estic slaves, and seed grain is usually obtained i n f m f r ' tlSl1 ''■ I1C ^ an ^ ra&lt; ^ ers ' The proportion of the population directly cent 6 Vfli m a ^ r * CU ^ Ure sma ^ an( ^ P ro ^ a ^y 110 ^ exceed 20 per takenb ^ w ^ e ; One^fth of the gross produce is the share ordinarily .J c ^i e f s of districts or by local headmen as the revenue ot cultivated land. 4 D1138 MAERAK (COAST OF PERSIAN) Livestock and domestic animals are camels, donkeys, horses, buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs, all belonging to indigenous breeds and of small size; horses and buffaloes are both scarce. The Jats are the main pastoral tribe ; they live a primitive life, subsisting almost entirely on dates and milk aad changing their grazing grounds frequently according to rainfall. The chiefs of districts collect a small tax in money from the owners of herds grazing within their territories.. Fisheries, —The sea fisheries are an important asset on the coast of Persian Makran. The fish are of nam3rou^ kinds and may be roughly divided into two classes, those which are taken for local consumption and those which are caught for export. Fishing is carried on with both net and line, the bulk of it by local boats, of which two or three are owned in almost every coast village between New Jashk and Gwatar. In April and May, however, and again from October to December, Chahbar is the resort of a score of large-sized boats owned by Arabs from the coast of 'Oman and of a dozen others from Gwadar which come to take part in the fishing. The fish caught far export, whether by natives or strangers, are cured on the spot by being gutted, rnbbed with salt, kept a few days, then washed in the sea and finally dried in the sun. The fish, when thoroughly cured, are sold to Ealuchi and Indian retail traders who visit all the places upon the coast periodic ally in order to purchase them for re-sale to merchants at ChahMrand Gwadar ; the profits of the fish trade are said to be large, amounting to as much as 40 per cent, on outlay. There are no pearl fisheries upon the Persian Makran coast. Foreign trade. —The only at all considerable ports are New Jashk, Cliallbar and Gwatar, and a leading part is played in the foreign com merce of the district by Hindus and Khojahs, British subjects, who reside permanently at Chahbar and Gwatar. The chief exports are dates, Pish palm mats, dried fish, F5to or fish-maw isinglass, shark fins, raw cotton, ghi, goatsVhair, wool, and hides in small quantities. The annual value of the exports appears to be abo^t Rs. 1,50,000 at Chahbar and Rs. 50,000 at Gwatar: the trade of Gwatar is at present depresst d by the prevalence of disorder in the neighbouring country. No estimate is possible for the smaller ports: that for New Jashk will be found in the article under the name. The bulk of the exports goes to India, but a portion to r 'Oman, Qishm Island and Bandar 'Abbas. The profits of the export trade are saidMAKRAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) 1139 to mn f 1,om to 20 per cent, or, in the case of dried fish, from 5 to 40 per cent. Imported goods are principally rice, flour, piece-goods &gt; lead, iron, tobacco, beads, mineral and vegetable oil, matches, tea, cotton thread, silk, spices and sugar; and the profits of the trade are placed at 20 per cent, on the average. The annual value of the Chahbar imports is estimated at U 1,00,000 and of the Gwatar imports at Rs. 30,000; for New Jashk the article under that name may be consulted, and for the other ports there are no data. It should also be mentioned that thera is a considerable importation, chiefly from Masqat, of modern rifles manufactured iiv England, France, Germany, and Belgium. Internal trade and manufactures. —The internal trade of the country is carried on chiefly by barte^ agricultural and pastoral products being exchanged for dried fish and foreign imported goods. The ports of New Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar are the main trade centres; Tank and Galag also are markets, but petty ones. Business is chiefly in the hands of Baluchi and British Indian traders. The merchandise is trans ported about the country on camels and donkeys. Manufactures there are none, except of Pish palm mats, partly for export, and of swords and pistols for local sale. Cnnency) weights and measures.-—The silver currency consists of Maria Theresa dollars, by Baluchis called Qursh and by Arabs Biyal Jbj worth at present RI-^ each; of Persian Qrans, here worth one-third of a rupee a piece; and of the Indian rupee, in Persian Makran ^yled Kaladar jUiy : the small change of the country is copper pice, partly of Indian and partly of Masqat mintage. A Persian gold coin, V Baluchis called Sor jj.w, is said to exist and to be worth Rs. 7, but it is now hardly if ever seen. The principal weights are the Qiyas , ordinarily equal to about 8 oz. avoirdupois English, but varying from place to place, and 16 ^ an w bich is subject to wide fluctuations between 7 and 15 English pounds. The common measures of length are the Baluchi Gaz or cubit, lual to the distance from a man^s elbow to the tip of his middle n b er or about 1| feet, and the Persian Gaz of about 3 feet. Distances J es ^ ma ted on the coast by time, and inland by a Farsakh c 0U ^ ^ nules which is defined as the spaoe that a walking horse will Vei ai1 ^ our on ordinary ground. 4 o 21140 MAERAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) Communications, supplies, and transport. —The land line of the Indo- European Telegraph Department from Gwadar to Jashk traverses tlie whole district^ keeping near the coast: the only offices in Persian Makran are at Chahbar and Jashk. There is a continnous route along the coast which passes through Kuh Mubarak, Gangan, Jasllk, Chahbar and Grwatar, eventually reaching Gwadar ; and the ports of Jashk^ Chahbar and Gwadar, as well as some of the smaller places on the coast, are connected with the district capitals of the interior and through them with Bampur, the nearest seat of a high Persian official, by various routes of which the major portions lie beyond the scope of our inquiry. These routes have been fully worked out, along with a number of cross routes in the interior, by the military authorities in India.* Here it is sufficient to remark that the roads of the country are all camel tracks, and that—though on some there are difficult places—as lines of com munication they are fairly good of their kind. The maritime plain between New Jashk and Gwadar is free from physical obstacles in dry weather and would then, it is reported, be passable for field artillery with few delays; but the route along it is everywhere liable to be interrupted after rain for one or two days by floods in the torrent beds which cross it from the hills, or for 5, 6, 10 or even 15 days by the larger rivers ; and in the Dashtyari and Balm districts the country generally is sometimes impassable for a fortnight together. In a dry season the use of the coast route would be strictly limited by scarcity of water, fodder and other supplies, and it would probably be impossible to move with more than 500 men: it is estimated that in a favourable season, that is, after good rainfall, the local supplies of sheep, goats, ghi and fodder might suffice to maintain a force of 1;500 men except in the Dashtyari and Bahu districts, where the water is bitter and a detachment of even 100 men would be supplied with difficulty. In the hills supplies are at all times less inadequate : some particulars are given in the notes on districts towards the end of this article. Water, slightly brackish, can generally be obtained even in the hot weather from holes in river and torrent beds at a depth of 4 to 15 feet. There are also some artificial tanks, called Otags , which are filled by rainfall and are frequently not exhausted in less than 6 to 8 * See in particular Routes in Persia I, Nos. 4, 6, 6B, 15, 25, 26, 27, 27A, 2/B, 28, 34, 34D, 42, 43 and 62. There is also in the records of the Intelligence Branch, Simla, a recent report by Lieutenant A. J. H. Grey, I.A.&gt; on the route from ClialibSr to Bampilr,MAKRAN (OOA8T OF PERSIAN) 1141 montlis; these are not common upon the coast, but there are 3 between Chahbar and Gwatar. Pack -carriage is obtainable to a limited extent throughout the country, and abundance of camel transport can be obtained at Chahbar and Jashk on short notice. The Makrani camel carries a load of 5 maunds and marches 15 miles a day at the rate of 2J miles an hour. For transport purposes male camels are almost exclusively employed, females not being used unless barren, or in cases of emergency. Marches are usually done in the morning and evening, a halt being made in the middle of the day for grazing; in the hot weather movement only takes place before sunrise or after sunset. The price of camels varies from 20 to 40 Tumans according to size, age and sex, and the ordinary daily hire, to Europeans, is one rupee a head. Maritime transport consists of a number of boats owned at places upon the coast. Gwatar has 4 Safri Eojis of 75 tons; and Chahbar boasts 12 vessels of 20 to 100 tons burden, manned by crews of 8 to 20 men, which run to Karachi and Bombay as well as to Arabian ports. New Jashk possesses 4 and Tank 6 boats of about 12 tons, with crews of 5 to 7 men, trading to the coast of Arabia only ; and at G alag there are 5 boats of 20 tons each. The total shipping of the coast is thus only about 40 boats of 12 tons and over: there are^ perhaps, a few othei good-sized boats j at smaller places which are not included in the above estimate. Jdmmsiraiwn.—Persian Makran, except the district of Jashk, is administered by a Persian Governor or Hakim ^ , who has his seat at Bampm and is subject to the authority of the Persian Governor- General of Kirman. Persian Makran is divided into the 5 districts 0 ashk, Gaih, Qasrkand, Dashtyari, and Bahu ; of these the first is escribed under its own name and the remainder receive short notices e ow. Each of the districts, except Jashk, is ruled by a chief, who &gt;7- ^ibute to the Persian Governor at Bam pur, but in regard hitemal administration of his district is exempt from the of C eaCe ^ ^ le ^ &gt;ers ^ arL execu tive. In fact, with the exception emi)lo ^ s on tlle coast all( i a Baluchi Wali represent- found ii p Yern0r ^ arn P^ r Chahbar, no Persian officials are to be w hen b eiS ^ an and similarly there are no Persian garrisons; ^ ei 'sian ^ WeVer, anilua l tribute is refused or falls into arrear the with re , 0VeiUmei1 ^ accus ^ oine( i to make an incursion into the country &amp; ar tioops and wheeled artillery from Bampur and to devastate■ 1142 MAKHAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) the refractory districts by way of punishment. Persian Customs officials are stationed only at New Jashk, Cliahbar ; and Gwatar and foreign trade at other places on the coast is forbidden, but the prohibition has not as yet been successfully enforced. The chiefs are assisted in the administration of justice by the religious authorities or Mullas of the country, and they delegate their executive authority to headmen of sub-districts, who in some cases are hereditary but more commonly are appointed by the chiefs. These headmen have almost plenary powers within the limits of their jurisdictions, power to inflict death however being withheld, and are responsible for the collection of the taxes. The ordinary taxes are 4th of actual gross produce on cultivated land, a grazing due of 4 to ^ Qrans per animal for the year bn livestock except sheep and goats, 1 to ^ per cent, in kind of sheep and goats kept, and 10 per cent, in kind of fish brought to market. There are no recognised laws, and order, so far as it exists, is enforced by primitive, summary methods ; formal protection of life and property however is almost altogether wanting, and its place is only partially sup plied by the blood-feud system, which renders aggression upon natives of the country dangerous to the committer. Arms are frequently used in tribal disputes, but serious disturbances are rare. The British Government pays subsidies to various local chiefs for the protection of the land line of telegraph between Gwadar and Jashk, and the inhabitants are in general well-disposed towards the telegraph staff and other British officials. The Persian Government also receive an annual subsidy of 3,000 Tumans on account of the facilities afforded to the British telegraph in the district.* ParticuldTs of the districts except Jashk. —The Gaih ^ district has a population of about 48,000 souls. The capital is Gaib, population about 2,500 souls, which is situated 72 miles north-north-west of Chahbar, the second place of importance is Bint with 2,000 inhabitants, 4^ mile •west by north of Gaih. The tribes of the district will be found m^e table of tribes already given. The fighting men armed with modern n ^ are estimated at 4,000, and the second levy with inferior firearms 10,000. The chief of Gaih, at present Saiyid Khan, Shairkhanzai, ca ^ tains a bodyguard of 50 mounted men, armed with swords and a ^. carbines. The Gaih district is reported to contain large patches o ^ vation, and the water is said to be generally good: it i® es ^ m ^ e £ ^ su pplies and forage to maintain a force of 1;50U men would be forth* * See the Appendix on the Peisian Gulf Telegraphs.MAKRAN (COAST OF PERSIAN) IMi coming all the year round. The passage of wheeled artillery in this district, if possible, would be difficult. The chief receives a telegraph subsidy of Rs. 1,000 a year from the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The chief village of the Qasrkand district is similarly named ; Qasrkand; its population is about rl^OO souls, and it is situated on the Kaju affluent of the Cbil river, 68 miles north by east of Chahbar and 1/77 5 feet above sea level. The population of the district, is about 1^000 souls and the tribes are as stated in the tribal table given above. The fir^t fighting levy of this district comprises about 300 men, and the second 1,500. The rightful chief of Qasrkand is Jan Muhammad, Gichki, but he has been ousted by Saiyid Khan of Gaih. -It is calculated that the resources of the Qasrkand district might support a force of 1,000 men. The country is unsuited for field artillery. TheDashtyari district has a population of about 18,000 souls; the tribes will be found in the tribal table above. The principal village is Mir Bazar j!)^ &gt; with 1,500 inhabitants, situated 35 miles north- north-west of Gwatar. The well armed fighting men of Dashtyari are said to number 1,000, and the less well armed ^,500. In the coastal part of the district it would be difficult at any time to maintain a force of 100 men, and after heavy rain the country generally is flooded and may remain impassable for animals during a fortnight. The present joint chiefs of Dashtyari, the brothers ^Abdi and Mahmud, are Jadgals and are related to the chi£f of Bahu; they each receive a telegraph sub sidy of Rs. oOO a year from the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Bahu district has a population of about 14,000 souls ; its capital is Bahu Qalat 9 with 1,000 inhabitants, situated miles north of Gwatar. The tribal table already given shows the tribes to which^heipeople of the district belong. About 500 of the gbting men are said to be armed with modern rifles and 2,500 with indifferent weapons. Near the coast there are the -same obstacles to the maintenance and movement of troops as m Dashtyari. The chief -of Bahu, Mir ^Asbraf, is a Jadgal and belongs to the same family as the C ^ as btyari. He receives Rs. 600 per annum as a telegraph ubsidy, and one of ills. 400 is also paid to his cousin Mir Ahmad.

The Sulutah, elsewhere described ' in a separate article, are probably Bani Malik. Except the Sulutah in regard to whom there is doubt, the Bani Malik are believed to have reached Qatar from Persia; and, being Maliki Sunnis, they are accordingly classed as Huwalah. They are however, if the Sulutah be excluded few in number; and they have no tribal organisation. MALIK Generally pronounced Bani Malich : an Arab tribe of Turkish 'Iraq, (BANI) (II) no -t vei y numerous but somewhat widely disseminated. ■ ^ On the Tigris the Bani Malik are found between 'Azair and Qurnai Village ; but here, on either side of the river, the marshes behind them are tenanted by the Ma'adan and they are confined to the neighbourhood of the actual banks. On the Euphrates they occur at various places from Suq-ash-Shuyukh down to Qurnah Village. On the Shatt-al 'Arab the Bani Malik are met with in the villages on both banks from Qurnah Village to Muhammareh Town ; but chiefly at Abu Mughairah and in the neighbourhood of Abul Khasib upon the right bank. Finally there are a number of sections of the tribe who in winter cultivate the soil in the Hawizeh. District of Persia and whose Shaikhs in summer make their appearance at H arthah, Abul Khasib and Da'aiji upon the Shatt- aVArab. Among the sections of the Bani Malik are the following :— 1. 'Abudah-as-Sabti 7. Hnwaishim 2. Aghzawi 8^ Majada'ah 3. 'Ayaishah 9. Nahd (Bani) dLiJtxc 4, Baraja'ah 10. Sakain (Bani) 5. Hilal and JU* 6. Hamftdi 11. Sulaimftn Of thefle subdivisions the Bani Nalid are mostly settled at Abu Mughairah, Abul Khasib, Nahr Khos and thereabouts, while the remainderMABTAH 1167 belong to that portion of the tribe which has been described as oscillating between the Hawizeh District and the banks of the Shatt-al- ; Arab. In religion the Bani Malik are Shi'ahs. Their habitations are huts; their crops are wheat, barley and maize ; they are cattle-owners, but they have no horses, camels or sheep. The tribe are now well armed with Martini rifles. The Bani Malik above Qurnah appear to be subject to the chiefs of the Mimtafik. An important town of the 'Oman Sultanate, in the district of MAN AH 'Oman Proper; it is situated about 12 miles south-south-east of Nizwa and 16 miles south-west of Izki.

The Shaikh of this com munity is Eashid-bin- Salim. The total population is about 4,500 souls. The town is surrounded by date groves except on the south and is characterized by a tall tower, called ^inarah, in the Bilad quarter. The houses are of mud and stone, some them with upper storeys. Wheat, gram and sugar are grown in the1158 MANAH oasis, which also produces grapes, limes and quinces, but neither almonds nor oranges. The date palms are estimated at 20,000, camels at 30 donkeys at 100, goats at 1,000 and sheep at 2,000 ; cattle are very fe ¥ ! The cultivation is irrigated by hot springs. Manah suffered from a severe drought, in 1845, and the population in that year was reduced by emigration to 400 or 500 persons. The Sultan of 'Oman has a Wall at Manah with only 15 armed 'Askaris as a following.

Situation and Manamah is situated on the coast of Bahrain Island at its north-eastern corner, on the northernmost point of the island : it lies less than 2 miles south-west by west of the town of Muharraq, from which it is separated by the tidal channel connecting the Manamah anchorage with Khor-al -Qalai'ah. The harbour of Manamah,* the only one in Bahrain used by steam vessels, is sheltered by the Bahrain and Muharraq islands on the south and east respectively, by the Fasht-al- J arim on the north, and by the Fasht Khor Fasht on the north-west. The onter anchorage, the nearest point to which steamers of 19 feet draught can approach the town, lies 4 miles north-west of Manamah ; smaller vessels can run up to an inner anchorage less than 2 miles off shore in the same direction. The water of the harbour is clear, and the bottom over the greater part of it appears to consist of white sand in patches interspersed with flat coral rock. The bottom shelves very gradually and regularly up to the town, and even boats, at low water, cannot get within J of a mile of the beach, but are obliged to discharge their passengers and cargo by means of donkeys that come alongside j these donkeys, 30 or 40 in number and belonging to the large # For the harbour and its approaches se« Admiralty Plan No. 2377—20,ma^Amah 1159 Bahrain breed; have been specially trained to work in the sea. A feature of the harbour is the number of fish-weirs and nets which are always set.* General aspect and huildings. —-Including the suburbs of Ras-ar- Rumman on the north-east and Na J im-al-Kabirah on the south-west, Manamah now extends miles along the sea-front, and it has a depth inland of about \ a mile. The general aspect of the town is damp, squalid and depressing. The better houses are built of small stones cemented together with mud or inferior mortar, which, falling out, gives them a rickety as well as an unwholesome appearance : some of the tenements are roomy, but often a good deal of the internal space is devoted to business offices,and godowns. The bazaar, in the^ centre of which is the market place, is a filthy labyrinth of narrow lanes lined by shops and generally covered over with mats to keep out the sun. The habitations in the outskirts are for the most part mat huts with sloping roofs, standing in courtyards surrounded by hurdles of upright date fronds. There are but few really good buildings. The best are the new British Political Agency towards the north-east end, between the town proper and Ras-ar- Rumman; Qal^at-ad-Diwan ^*15 or Manamah fort, the Shaikh^s summer residence, a large construction in good repair with several bas tions, standing in the open plain behind the town between it and the date gardens; a neat and well built mansion belonging to his son Shaikh Hamad, partly upper-storeyed, which is situated near the fort but some what further inland ; and a large house with strong and high walls, situated near the south-west end of the town and occupied until his flight in 1905 by Shaikh ^Ali-bin-Ahmad, a junior member of the ruling family. The existing mosques are singularly plain and unpretentious, with dwarf minarets only about 12 feet high ; a new Jami' mosque, however, is now in course of erection which will be a much finer building than any of them. There are now no trees in the town ; but on the side towards the American hospital traces exist of a date grove which appears to have been watered by a Falaj from a spring in the Qarat -ad-Diwan. Large refuse heaps abound, especially in the suburbs. About 1 mile south of Manamah is an old shrine which is visited by Shi'ah women during the night: it consists of a stone with a hollow top in which the devotees deposit rice and eggs. * Some remarks on tbe harbour by Admiral Atkinson-Wiiles, R.N., will be found in the GoYernment of India's Political Proceedings for June 1904.1160 man A mah Defences,—'Except for Manamah fort, already mentioned, which ig badly placed and of no modern value, the town is open and undefended both from land and sea. Inhabitants, quarters and The population of Manamah (inclusive of the two suburbs mentioned further on) is now estimated at 25,000 souls, of whom about | are Shi'ahs and most of the remaining | are Sunnis. The Shi'ahs may be classified as follows Aiabs from Basrah Baharinah of Bahrain Baharinah from the Hasa Oasis Baharinah from the Qatif Oasis Persians . . .

The remaining* Mnhammadans of Manamah are distributed as below :~~ origin including Arabs from the Hasa Oasis . Arabs from Kuwait Arabs from Najd Arabs of various or uncertain Jana'at * . . , . Huwala h . # # # Negroes (free) Negroes (slaves, but not living with their masters) Persians from 'Awaz, etc. 'Utub T otal few 250 150 500 1,000 5,000 1,500 800 50 550 9,800 All of these are Sunnis of the various principal sects^ with the excep tion of the .Najdi Arabs who are mostly Wahhabis. Ihe small non-Muhammadan balance of about 200 souls consists of 69 to 175 Hindus, 50 Jews, 40 Oriental Christians, 6 Americans and 4 Europeans. The Hindus, whose numbers fluctuate, are not permanently settled and are mostly Bhatijahs and Lohanahs. The Jews are mostly immigrants of 10 years^ standing and less from Turkish 'Iraq. Of the Oriental Christians about 80 are engaged in trade and the remainder are attached to the American Mission, to which also the 6 Americans al] belong. The Europeans are the British Political Agent and 1 British and 2 German merchants.MAW AM AH 1161 Among tlie native population, other than the Baharinah and Persians, there is a noticeable infusion of negro blood ; and the people, without being sullen or disagreeable, look dull and dejected. Diseases of the eye are extraordinarily prevalent among them.

Another suburb known as Na^im-al-Kabirah , once a separate village but now connected with the west end of the town, consists of about 600 reed huts with a few masonry houses and is inhabited by about 3,000 low-class Baharinah dependent on boat-building and the pearl fishery* Resources and water supply.—'Ahont 500 date palms belong to the town proper and another 800 to the Na^im-al-Kabirah suburb. Livestock include 21 horses^ 175 donkeys and 135 cattle in the towil itself; 6 donkeys and 8 cattle in the Ras-ar-Rumman suburb ; and 18 donkeys in the suburb of Na^im-al-Kabirah. The better classes at Manamah buy their drinking water from eamelmen of Rifa'-ash-Sharqi and Rifa'-al-Gharbi who bring it for sale from the Hanaini and Umm Ghuwaifah wells of their respective villages. The water used by the poorer inhabitants is procured from on etwo sources, Quful Jyu and ^Ain Muqbil ^ ; the former 0 f these is a cistern, about 1 mile west of the fort, which is filled by the Sur plus water of several springs ; the latter is a well sunk in the coral 100 ^ tatween the British Political Agency and the American Mission, in 0 pen ground belonging to Haji-Muqbil-adh-Dhakari, the leading Najdi Merchant. The water of Quful is always contaminated by the ingress1162 MANAMAH and washing of men and animals, while that of 'Ain Muqbil is naturally very brackish ; but the servants of the Political Agency get their drinking water from the first, and the animals of the Agency are watered at the second. Water from both is hawked about the town by carriers; that from Quful fetches one pice per goatskin. For washing purposes nearly every house or courtyard in Manamah possesses a shallow well in which the water'stands at about 6 feet below the surface. Trade and shipping. —Manamah exists chiefly by its trade, which forms the bulk of that described in the article on the Bahrain Princi pality. The bazaar contains about 450 shops. To Manamah Town belong 2 Baghlahs, 6 Bums, 1 Shu'ai and 100 Mashuwahs and jolly- boats j while 1 Baghlah, 2 Bums, 1 Baqarah and 15 Mashuwahs and jollyboats, all used for pearling, are owned by the inhabitants of the 11 as ar- Humman suburb. Foreign interests and institutions. —Manamah is the seat of the British Political Agent in Bahrain, and a charitable dispensary and post office are attached to the Agency. A mission of the Reformed (Dutch) Church of America in Bahrain have their headquarters at Manamah, where they maintain a book depot for the sale of the Bible and of other books printed in the languages of the Gulf. There is also a Mason Memorial Hospital' belonging to the Mission which was built in 190^ ; it has 20 beds, and in 1904&lt; medical attendance was there afforded on no less than 17,000 occasions. An Arabic-English day school with 68 enrolled pupils also forms part of the Mission. MANA- NA'AH Singular Manna'i • A tribe of non-Bedouin Arabs, pearl divers and pearl merchants in Bahrain and Qatar. In Bahrain they have 100 houses at Qalali, 10 at Muharraq Town and 10 at Hadd: in Qatar, 10 at D5hah and 70 at Abu Dhaluf, They are Maliki Sunnis in religion and claim to be Bani Tamim by descent. MANASIR Singular Mansuri . A Bedouin tribe of Trucial ^Oman whose headquarters are in Dhafrah ; their general range is from Qatar on the north-west to the Baraimi Oasis on the east, and they are found all over Dhafrah, but especially in Dhafrah Proper and Liwah, and also in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi Town andMANAslR lies visit the Baraimi Oasis, and some are settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe are in contact with the Bani Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar and further inland, on the west, with the A1 Morrah: their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Faruq. On the east their territory marches with that of the Bani YaS, with whom moreover they are intermingled in Dhafrah ; and to the south of them the country is uninhabited, being part of the Ruba'-al-Khali. The Manasir, except those at Khan and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic ; most of them winter in Qatar or its neighbourhood and spend the summer in Liwah where they have temporary villages of huts and eome date groves, possessed as tribal joint property. Their manner of life in Liwah is described in the article on Dhafrah. A tabular account of the Bedouin portion of the tribe and its sub-divi sions follows below Section. Subsection.

The Manasir are Hinawiyah in politics and Muwalik in religion. They were formerly subject to the Wahhabi government and in 1866 were understood to pay a contribution worth J^OOO a year^ chiefly in kind ; into the Wahhabi treasury ; now they are independent of all control but maintain some degree of intercourse with the town of Abu Dhabi and its Shaikh. MANSAH (WADI) A valley in the Sultanate of 'Oman constituting an important right bank tributary of Wadi Samail, which it enters immediately below Qurta^ : its source is at Najd Wasitj where there is a village, Wasit in a bleak situation with a scanty water supply; this village consists of 35 houses of the Rahbiyin and is the seat of the principal Eahbi Shaikh. In the same vicinity are two other Rahbiyin villages^ Manaithirah and Eahbah of 35 and 20 houses respectively: the former is said to have 40 camels ; 200 donkeys and 2/J00 sheep and goats, the latter to have 60 camels, 200 donkeys and 6,000 sheep and goats, but these figures appear exaggerated. A frequented route leads up Wadi Mansah and over Najd Wasit into Wadi TayiH. The upperMANS AH (WADI) 1165 part of Wadi Mansah forms a broad liigliway, the acclivity being slight and the bed smooth and sandy ; the lower course of the Wadi is fringed with date groves. Not far from the head of tbe Wadi is the village of Sharabat , 1^ miles belo w which it receives, on its left bank, a tributary called Wadi Rak dJb • Sharabat consists of 30 houses of Rahbiyin who possess 10 camels, 30 donkeys and 500 sheep and goats.

In Wadi Mansah wheat, barley and lucerne are grown in villages in the bed of the ^Vadi, but the amount of cultivation is insignificant, The same holds of its tributary Wadi Kak. MAQABIL Singular Maqbali , A Ghafiri tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, located for the most part in Western Hajar. They are found at Khan (40 houses), Hail Adha (20 houses) and Hansi (20 houses) in Wadi-al-Jizi and its tributaries; at Muta J arishah (60 houses), Hail (40 houses);MAQLA (AL BIN-) 116rj Jjithaibat (25 houses) and 'Aqair (20 houses) in Wadi-al -Hilti ; and at Murri (60 houses), Mahbab (60 houses), Nizuk (20 houses), Madmah (25 houses) and Salam (80 houses) in Wadi Bani Ghafir. Outlying settlements of the Maqabil occur at Bat (180 houses) in Wadi Sharsah 'in DhaMrah, and at ; Awainat (50 houses), Himbar (90 houses) and Taraif (200 houses) in the Sohar sub-Wilayat in Batinah. The Maqabil at Muta 'arishah belong to a section styled Bani Khail and a number of those in Batinah are Samah The number of the tribe may be estimated at nearly 5,000 souls, and Hail in 'Wadi-al -Hilti appears to be their headquarters. In 1905 the Maqabil gave much trouble to the Sultan of 'Oman and were expelled by his troops from a fort in Wadi-al- Hilti. Or Mijdam : a place in Turkish ^raq on the left bank of the MAQDAM Euphrates river about 30 miles by water below Fallujah and 3cS miles (KHAN) above Musaiyib. There is no permanent habitation of any sort here, ooteven a hut ; but a collection of tents may sometimes be seen of the Zoba ? tribe. At this place the leffc bank of the Euphrates is shelving and very sandy, the right bank steep ; the distance between the two is nearly 200 yards. There is a small wood on the left bank about half a mile long by 150 yards deep, consisting of medium sized trees of Euphrates poplar and surrounded by a belt of tamarisks : it is said to be the property of a resident of Baghdad City. Goods from Hit, chiefly lime and Juss, are sometimes deposited by boats at Khan Maqdam for removal to Baghdad by camel caravan. A small tribe of Bahrain and Qatar claiming to be a branch of MAQLA the il Bu Kuwarah, —by whom however the correctness of the claim is BI^.-) denied. The A1 Bin-Maqla are Maliki Sunnis; they are pearl divers ^ an d pearl merchants by occupation ; and they own 100 houses at Halat ^ Mahur in Bahrain and 10 houses at Wakrah in Qatar. A small subdivision of the A1 Bin-Maqla in Bahrain are called A1 Bu ^ . jy t1168 MAQLAB MAQLAB A bay in Klior-asli -Shain ; on the west side of the isthmus which divides the Malcolm and Elphinstone inlets of theRuus -al-Jibal District of the ^Oman Sultanate. The bay lies between Qanah and Sham Island and is abont a mile broad by a mile deep. The whole neck joining the main body of Euus-al-JiMl to its head which ends in Eas Musandam is now generally spoken of by Europeans as the isthmus of Maqlah: it consists of a rocky ridge, about 200 feet high at the lowest part and 4 miles in length from west-south-west to east-north-east; at one place near its eastern end it measures only about 600 yards across from sea to MAQNI YAT oUxa/® A town among the inland slopes of the Western Ha jar of the 'Omllll Sultanate, but reckoned to the district of DhaMrah; it is situated in a valley called Wadi Bilad Shahum ^ ^ , which is a tributary of Wadi- al-KaHr and rises near the head of Wadi Bam Ghafir, Maqniyat consists of some 740 mud houses of the Bani Kalban tribe, the sections being represented as follows:'Amairah, 200 houses; Ghababm, 160 houses; Jarawinah, 200 houses ; Sinan, 80 houses; and Subaih, 100 houses, The people are cultivators, camel-men and donkey-men; they own about a00 camels and 600 donkeys which ply from Khaburah and Sohar in Batinah to 'Ibri and Dhank in Dhahirah. The agricultural resources of the place comprise 12,000 date-palms, 50 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. A mile or two west of Maqniyat is a village of 60 houses called Sammah A also inhabited by Bani Kalban; here wheat, millet and lucerne are grown, and there are 1,000 date-palms, 12 cattle, la donkeys and 200 sheep and goats. MAQTA' •.laii./* A stream of brackish, undrinbable water in the Kuwait Prmoi pality, forming the boundary between the district of Hazaxm on the north and the plain of Labibah or district of Sudah on the soutk rises in a salt spring called 'Ain-al-'Abd which * - d ^ L 15 miles from the coast, and it reaches the sea immed.td X north of Ras-al-Khafji. Maqta&gt; is described as having a flow ofMARtm 1169 water 10 or 12 feet broad and 1 foot deep, and it is stated that at full tide native vessels can proceed a short way up it. Its entrance is known as Khor -al-Maqta'. A plural form of the name (Maqata'' ) is also used. Alow, sandy islet, 28 miles south by east of Kubbar island and 16 MARADIM miles off the coast of Kuwait. It is under half a mile in diameter and (UMM-AJL) beais some brushwood, but is destitute of water. Umm-al-Maradim is ^ reckoned to the Kuwait Principality. Singular Marri . A tribe found chiefly in the coast towns of MARA&amp; Trucial 'Oman, but also in the interior: they have 200 houses at Sharjah in the Laiyah quarter, 40 at Abu Dhabi and 30 at Dibai : besides these there are about 70 families of Bedouin Marar who inhabit Liwah in Dhafrah. The Marar claim to be a section of the A1 Morrah, but their pretensions in this respect do not appear to be well founded. Most of the Marar are pearl divers by occupation; in politics they are Hbawiyah and in religion Maliki Sunnis. A tract in Kuwait territory, situated to the north of Jahrah between MARRtJ Zaqlah and Yah : it begins at 9 miles, and extends to 15 miles, from -Air) Mrah. Its elevation is from 250 to 800 feet; it has camel grazing but no water. The name, which means a barren pebbly waste, is perfectly descriptive. A river, also called the Kurdistan or Behbehan river, which emerges MARTIN a ^ft in the Kuhgalu hills some distance to tho north of Behbehan ^Wn and, flowing north-westwards, unites with the Rclmnz river 10 or ^iles below Ramuz Town to form the Jarrahi. Sultanabad^and 4 rI 1170 MAKtJN Jaizan in tlie Ramuz District lie respectively 13 and 28 miles up it from its junction with the Ramuz Uiver, The valley of the Marun in the Ramuz District is 1 to 2 miles wide, flac ; and enclosed by cliffs 50 to 100 feet high. The stream is 50 to 100 yards broad, 3 to 6 feet deep and has a strong current. The banks are bordered with thick willow jungle. About 5 miles above Sultanabad the Marun receives oh its right bank a tributary of fresh water, 10 yards wide and 3 feet deep, fringed with willows and oleanders. On the north side of the Marun, in places^ are grassy plains with thorn trees. MASA- Singular Maskari • A Ghafiri tribe of the ^Oman Sultanate, KIRAH Ibadhis by religion, numbering in all about 6,000 souls; they inhabit the ^Alayah or northern quarter of Ibra, sharing that town with the Hirth, and also occupy Yahmadi and the otter villages of the Baldan-al-Masakirah division of Sharqiyah. Some live at Bilad-as-Sur. The Masakirah have also the following Bedouin sections : the Falaihat 300 souls, owning 30 camels, 25 donkeys, 40 cattle and 200 sheep and goats; the Nahad 500 souls, owning 50 camels, 40 donkeys, 30 cattle and 600 sheep and goats; and the Masa/id c S ju L** or Masa/idah sj-ctw®, 800 souls, owning 300 camels, 200 donkeys, 100 cattle and 800 sheep and goats. In 1877 the Masakirah were reported to have given pecuniary aid to the Harithi rebel Salih, but they have at times been at feud with his tribe. The Masakirah have now 5 principal Shaikhs at Ibra, and others of their influential men are at Yakmadi in Baldan-al-Masakirah. MA'S HIT R * A village constituting, with some square miles of the country surround- ing it, a small administrative district in Southern ^Arablstan j it is the port of the JarraM District and formerly served the district of Ramuz also. Fo sit ion and boundaries.— village of Ma'shur, generally called Bandar joij, is situated about a mile north of the inland termination of the Khor Ma^shur branch of Khor Musa; ^nd its position, as very * The priucipal authority for this article is a repc?!:, dated 14th March 1906, by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, Vice -Consul for ' Arabistan.MA'SHtm 1171 recently astronomically determined, is 30° 34' 28' north by 49° 11' ES* east. According- to local tradition the original village of Ma'shur was situated at a place lall Kafiran which seems to lie on the south -east; bank of Khor Ma'shur at about 3 miles from its head. The limits of the tract dependent on the village are not clearly defined; but they may be taken to include the south-eastern bank of Khor Ma shur, so far as it consists of tefra firmci, and the north-western, bank down probably to the mouth of Khor Doraq, the locality Zaiigi which is mentioned in the article on Khor Musa thus falling within the boundaries of Ma'shur. On the side towards Buziyeh the limit of Ma'shur territory is said to be at a spot called 'Aquleh dOiic, about 3 miles from the village. Surroundings and communications.— T \\ q ground to the south of the town, which is mostly impracticable even for men on foot, is included in the description given elsewhere of Khor Musa ; so also is the only route connecting the village with that inlet at the point called Sif. A direct route connects Ma'shur with Buziyeh by way of 'Aquleh and of either Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan or a Kamleh ; up to the border of the Fallahiyeh District at 'Aquleh the countfy is mostly a saline plain, with patches of grass which support considerable flocks of sheep. A route to Fallahiyeh Town, more northerly and less westerly in its initial stages than the last, strikes the Jarrahi Eiver at Tuwaiqiyeh ; at two miles from Ma'shur village this route runs through ground which is intersected by ravines—the beginnings of the hollow which reaches Khor Ma ? shur between Ma/shur village and Sif—and would be heavy going after rain; beyond this point patches of wheat become frequent, and grass and scrub increase as the Jarrahi is approached. Communica?- tion with Eamuz is by various lines joining the Fallahiyeh-Ramuz route, which runs along the bank of the Jarrahi River, at various points. Character of village. — a^shur village stands upon a mound which the appearance of being artificial but in all probability consists ^eiely of the accumulated debris of a long inhabited site. A ruined dominates the place, and there are 3 mosques, of which the best Was kuilt in the present generation by one Haji Nasir, a merchant of the place. The houses are of the type usual in this part of Persia; they are of mud with mud roofs and each of them encloses its own courtyard, round the village, outside, are scattered the roofless mud walls of uiutive huts which are occupied in the wheat harvest, when the 4 y 21172 MA'SHtTR grain is heaped up outside the village. Sanitation is disregarded and drinking water is largely drawn from a stagnant pool, the same as that in which clothes are washed. The atmosphere in summer is said to be yery damp, and the heat oppressive. Inhabit ant population of Ma'shur village is about 1 ; 500 souls; as a whole the people are healthy and well favoured in appearance. Half of them are Bandavis or Bandarlyeh and are said to be connected with the Bani Turuf, but this point is very doubtful and the Bandaris themselves profess ignorance of their origin; the remainder of the people are described as Qanawatis from Behbehan. The Bandaris are said to have been the founders of the place and the Qanawatis to be later immigrants. A few Bandaris, perhaps 300, are found at Hadameh in the neighbouring Jarrahi District; the Qanawatis are better known through their connection with the Hindiyan District, in the article on which tbey are described. The entire community is bilingual, speaking both Persian and Arabic; but among themselves the people chiefly use a low form of Persian of the Lur type. Their dress is in the main Arab in pattern; but it is not free, especially in the case of the women, from Persian modifications. Men wear the Arab Kafiyah or kerchief, the Arab ; Aqul or head-fillet and the Arab ^Aba or cloak; underneath the last is a Zabun or long cotton coat reaching to the heels. The women all wear the'Aba, their coiffure is Arab, and the Persian Burqa^ is not seen among them; on the other hand trousers frequently form a part of their costume, shoes are worn, -— which are not found amono* Arab women of the lower O classes—and as children they frequently adopt the bandage round the forehead which is not assumed by the Arab woman until after marriage. Until two generations ago the permanent inhabitants of Ma 'shur were all Sunnis, at least so the people themselves aver; but now all have become Shi^ahs. Ma^shur is at present the seat of a Mulla, named Shaish Husain, who has considerable local influence and receives Zakat even from villages on the Jarrahi. His sentiments are believed to be anti-European. The people of Ma'shur are fairly well armed and possess in all about 100 rifles. Agriculture and UvestocJc. —There are traces of extensive irrigated cultivation to the north and west of Ma'shur village, but the fields have long ceased to exist; the necessary supply of water is said to have been drawn from the Jarrahi River by means of a dam at Hadameh. IhereMA'SHtTBi 1173 is now no irrigation on the north side of Ma'shur, nor is any met with in going westwards until the Kbatar canal of the Shatut tract is reached near Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan in the Fallahiyeh district. Cultivation is now limited to 50 or 60 Khish or ploughs of land in the neighbourhood of the village, on which precarious crops of wheat and barley are grown by rainfall alone. There are only about 30 date palms. Livestock are estimated at 20 or 30 horses and mares, 50 mules, 150 donkeys, 50 horned cattle and 5,000 sheep and goats. Water supply and other -Rain water is collected on the east side of the town by an embankment faced with brick which was built about 10 years ago by the merchant, Haji Nasir, already men tioned ; on the open tank thus formed the people of Ma'shur depend for all purposes during about 8 months in the year, and during the other 4 months they drink from wells, of which there are many small ones in the town. There is also, to the west of the town, a Birkeh or underground cistern which holds excellent water and is due, like the other principal works of the place, to the liberality of Haji Nasir j the entrance is kept locked during the winter. The fact that the livestock of Ma'shur are not sent elsewhere in the hot weather seems to indicate that the wateir supply is in no way deficient, but the well water at least is brackish, and unhealthy. Fodder is brought from the Jarrahi and Hindiyan Districts, and fuel, consisting of small bushes ouly, is mostly cut within a radius of 10 miles from the village upon its east and west sides. The prices of ordinary supplies frequently range high at Ma'shur. In March 1906 the rate for wheat was 23 to 27 Qrans, and for barley 14 Qrans per local Hashiin Man of about 248 lbs. English. Fish and excellent prawns are taken at Zangi; ^the rate for the latter, at the time just mentioned, was 1 Qran per Bushehr Man of 71 lbs. if dried, and 8 Qrans if cleaned. Trade —The rise of Nasiri on the Karun river has adversely affected Ma'shur and has taken from it the greater part even of the Ramuz export trade, of which it had formerly a monopoly. The fetaplo export is wheat, but the quantity available varies greatly, as elsewhere l &amp; 'Arabistan, from season to season. There is also some exportation of Wey. J n a good year the amount of wheat passing through the port reach 600, and that of barley 50 local Earehs. From 20,000 to 30,000 fleeces of wool, valued at from 15 to 26 Tumans the hundred.MA'SHtTR ai'e^expcrted in each year. Some beans, sesame and oak-bark also are shipped from Ma'shur, but it is stated that gum arabic and linseed no longer follow this route as formerly. Imports, which are mostly of Indian origin, are received throuah Kuwait, Bushehr and Muhammareh. The chief articles imported are Qand or sugar in the loaf, about 200 eases a year; Shakar or granulated sugar, about 300 bags per annum; also piece-goods, tea, and spices or Adwiyat. The piece-goods are mostly from Muhammareh. The prices of imported goods depend on the prices at Bushehr and are greater by the amount of the freight and other transit charges and by the commission of the local merchant which is at a rate of 5 to 10 per cent. The price of Qand is thus 8 to 11 Tumans for a case containing 32 or 36 cones. There are only 2 merchants of consideration at Ma'shur; both are Behbehanis by origin, and both now have their headquarters at Kuwait. There is no bazaar at Ma^shur and all business is transacted in private houses. The weightswn use at Ma^shur are the following :— 1 Waqiyeh ^ . = i Bushehr Man or 7f lbs. English. 16 Waqijeh . . = 1 Man-i -Khalfabad or 124 do. do. 32 Waqiyeh . . = 1 Man-i-Hashim or 248 do. do. 100 Man-i-Hashim . = 1 Kareh ^ or 24,800 do. do. The Waqiyeh is divided into Ruba^ g) or quarters, Nim ^ or halves, etc. The unit of linear .measure is the usual ZaraM-Shah of the Persian Coast. Port and shipping.--The i&amp;bilities which Ma^shur enjoys, or more correctly the disabilities from which it suffers, as a port are described in the article on Khor Musa ; there it will be seen that the landing place for goods is more than 2 miles from the village and that the path connecting the two becomes difficult in bad weather. Only about 10 trading vessels are owned at Ma J shur and 4 fishing boats of size: of the former class 5, belonging to one owner, are Bums capable of making voyages to Kuwait and even to Masqat- Numerous vessels from other ports call at Ma^shur, and in a year of large wheat export as many as 600 visits may be paid by strange craft ,* these are mostly Mashuwahs, G hunchahs and Baqarahs, but sometimes they are Ballams and occasion ally Baghlahs. All vessels must sail or drift up Khor Musa to Ma'shur aSj from the nature of the banks, there is no possibility of towing them.MA'SHtTR 1J76 v J i The journey from Ma^shur to Kuwait, by sailing vessel ordinarily occupies about 24 hours, but in favourable circumstances it may be performed in half that time. About 24 hours is the time usually required to reach Fallahiyell Town from Ma'shur by water via Khor Ma'shur and Khor Doraq. Government. —Ma^shur is understood to be the joint property of the Nizam-as-Saltaneh and the Mushir-ud-Daulehj having been obtained by the former from the Persian Government as a Tiyul in 1895. It is farmed from the owners by the Shaikh of Muhammarell, but the terms of the lease are not at present ascertainable. The local authority until about 8 years ago was a certain Mir 'Abdullah, belonging to a tribe or family called Amareh of Khalfabad ; and to him belonged the ruined fort which is still visible at Ma'shur. In the time of Mir 'Abdullah the Shaikh of Muhammareh had not perhaps obtained the farm of the revenues of Ma'shur, for they were then paid into the treasury at Shushtar. Four or five years ago Mir 'Abdullah died, having been held in imprisonment for the last 3 or 4 years of his life by the Shaikh of Mixhammareh^ whose displeasure he had incurred. Since this event the influence of the Shaikh at Ma'shur has become supreme and undisputed and he has been represented locally by a confidential agent named Shaikh Salaiyeh, who was at one time among his personal attendants and whose position and powers in regard to Ma shur^ as well as to the Hindiyan District also controlled by hinij appear to be indefi^ nite. The Shaikh of Muhammarell is exceedingly feared at Ma'shur &gt; but there, as elsewhere in Southern ' Arabistan, he appears to be regarded as a just man. The only agricultural tax is one on land actually cultivated, at the rate of 110 Qrans per Khish; but the Shaikh also recovers one Chaharak per Man (or the monetary equivalent) on the flesh of every animal slaughtered for food; and there is reason to believe, though efforts are made to conceal the fact, that he also collects an excise of 2 Tumans on every hundred fleeces exported from Ma shur. The customs of Ma'shur before their transfer to the Imperial Peisian Customs Department were valued at 6,000 Tumans per annum; no proper estimate of their yield under the new regime can be framed, but it is said to amount to 20,000 Tumans. There is no telegraph office. A post office managed by the Customs exists however, and a weekly service to Muhammareh, Hindiyan and Bushehr is maintained.1176 MASlRAH MASlRAH* The only large and important island nowmcluded in the Sultanate of W 4 *' 'Oman; it is situated off the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman and begins about 140 miles below Eas-al-Hadd. Masirah is of irregular oblong form, about 40 miles in length from north-north-east to south-south west and lies parallel to the coast, from which it is distant about 10 miles. Constricted in the middle to about 4 miles in breadth, the island widens out above and below this point to 10 miles and again tapers towards each extremity. The eastern or 'outward^ side of the island is called Dhahiriyah and the western or channel ^ side Khoriyah ^ The sound which divides Masirah from the mainland is so shallow that the greater part of it is dry at low water; it is navigable only on the side towards Masirah. The channel is used by native vessels of about 40 tons. A chain of hills traverses Masirah longitudinally from end to end sending ridges down to all the principal capes, while shorter spurs protrude in different directions over the island. The highest summit, Jabal Madhrub vj;** near the north-east corner, attains an altitude of 620 feet; hardly any of the peaks in the southern half exceed 300 feet, and in the narrow waist of the island the hills are low and undulating. Flat land is almost confined to the west side of the island, where it occurs in the shape of sandy plains that extend from the base of the hills to the sea and are raised only a few feet above sea level. The rocks of Masirah are chiefly igneous, of euphotide and diorite, with here and there small tracts of limestone raised upon them. Copper is found in many places, mostly among green earthy diorites and in low trap hills ; it occurs also as malachite, both disseminated and in veins. Traces exist in some localities of ancient workings and smelting furnaces. In the northern half of the island is a tabular bed of limestone, 2 miles long by | a mile broad, which rests upon greenstone and is elevated about 400 feet above the level of the sea ; both in horizon? tality and in colour it forms a marked contrast with the dark, rugged igneous rocks around and beneath it. On the inner side of the island, about the middle, good water is obtainable throughout the year at a few feet below the surface, t Masirah is almost destitute of vegetation. On the mountains only a few small herbs grow, and on the plains stunted Sidar and Samar trees, some herbaceous shrubs, and grass in matted tufts. Dates are few and poor # For Masirah Island see Chart No. 2369—10c. t The geology of Masirah is discussed by Carter in the Bombay Asiatic Society's Jour* iial for 1844-^, pages 400-403.fC?Z MAStBAH 1177 and are not found at many places. Wild animals are gazelles and grey- rabbits resembling the English rabbit but only half the size. Wild asses are found in the hills; and edible turtle, called Hamas abound in the sea, which also yields seer-fish, grey mullet^ sharks and porpoises. The sperm -whale is common, and cuttle-fish and other cephalopods are in myriads. There are no hyaenas or jackals. The climate is not unhealthy, and the thermometer in the north-east monsoon ranges from 68° to 78° F. The people are Jannabah with a few Hiktiaan interspersed : the total number of males on the island is said not to exceed 200, and the perma- nent population is probably about 600 souls. The following are the principal settlements on both sides in order from north to south ; there are no fixed villages in the interior. Name. Position, houses and inhabitants. Pv£MA.BES.

When provisions run short they obtain dates from Mahot. The women and children eat shell-fish. Domestic animals are sheep and goats, which are not numerous on account of the scarcity of pasture; also dogs, cats and fowls.

The massacre of the crew of the ec Baron Inverdale }J at Jidufah in 1904 was committed by these summer immigrants. The exports of M asirah are tortoise-shell, shark-fins and dried fish, all of which go to Bombay in Stir boats; and the principal import is cotton cloth brought by the same vessels. The people extract porpoise oil. The state ment that they deal in ambergris is now incorrect: none has been found for over 40 years. MASNA'AH A port on the coast of the Batinah district in the 'Oman Sultanate; 17 miles west-north-west of Barkah and 17 miles east-south-east ofMASQAT BAY AND TOWN Suwaiq; ^ is situated at the point where Wadi Fara^ or Rustaq reaches the sea. Masna 'ah is a small town of about 300 houses with date groves extending 4 or 5 miles along the sea and ,2. or 3 miles inland ; the inhabitants are Yal Braik (30 houses), Yal Shabib (20 houses), Yal Sa'ad (50 houses), YalJarad (80 houses), Nuwafil (10 houses), Baluchis (90 houses), and Persians (20 houses). There is an Arab bazaar of about 50 shops, and the fort contains about 10 shops kept by Hindus ; there are also a few Khojah traders. Masna'ah is the port of Wadi Bani Kharusand of the Rustaq District : it possesses 4 Baqarahs running to the ports of Trueial ■'Oman and 12 ^adans plying to Masqat Town, also 20 Shashahs. Livestock are 90 camels, 100 donkeys, 200 cattle and 320 sheep and goats : there are 9,000 date palms. There is a fort belonging to the Sultan of ; 0man; it is occupied by his W T ali of Masna^ah and is held by a garrison of 70 men. The customs duties produce about $3,000 and Zakat $2,000 a year, of which $^,000 is remitted to Masqat. Since 1901-02, before which they were farmed, the customs of this port have been under the direct management of the Sultan's officials. This is the established spelling of the name, but educated inhabitants oftheplacestate that it is frequently pronounced and sometimes written cJu*; the latter is the form given by Niebuhr. i.—Masqat is the capital of the ; 0man Sultanate and the usual residence of the Sultan : it is situated in the Masqat District on the southern shore of the Gulf of 5 Oman rather less than J of the way from Ras-al -Hadd, the eastern point of Arabia^ to R^s Musandam which marks the entrance to the Persian Gulf. It stands in the centre of an outcrop of volcanic rock which extends 10 miles along the coast from Darsait to Bandar Jissah and has a depth inland of about 3 uiiles: the town is at the bottom of a cove, the easternmost of 5 large contiguous indentations, where Wadi-al-Kabir a valley carrying the drainage of the greater part of the igneous basin, disembogues into the s ea. The northern portion of the volcanic bed is diorite and the remainder euphotide of a dark-brown colour resembling serpentine : m the diorite and the euphotide is a deposit of green steatitic clay.

MASQAT BAY and TOWN*1180 MASQAT BAY AND TOWN Rugged and almost inaccessible hills rise inland of the town on bott sides of Wadi-al-Kabir to heights of £00 and 400 feet, and are dominated by Jabal Bardah or Saddle Hill in the background, which is 1 350 feet high and about 3 miles south of Masqat. Through the hills on the West a track barely practicable for animals leads over a pass to Riyam and so to Matrah; while on the south-east a somewhat similar pass con ducts to Sidab; both these passes are situated beyond the outermost suburbs and each is barred by a wall with a gateway in it. There is no route, except for foot-passengers, by Wadi-al-Kabir to the interior, Harlour, —The bay of Masqat * is about | of a mile deep and i a mile wide ; it is open to the north-north-west. The western side of the bay is formed by a rocky promontory, 435 feet high, terminating at the seaward end in a point named Eas Kalbuh. The eastern side con sists of Masqat Island, 1,300 yards long and 350 feet high, indented and precipitous all round and ending seawards in Has Masqat. Between the southern end of Masqat Island and the mainland is a rocky islet, 100 feet high, which has a narrow and shallow channel upon each side of it; the channel between it and Masqat Island is known as Duwairah 8;^. The foot of Masqat Bay is a sandy beach terminated at each extremity by a rocky eminence on which stands a fort; and it should be mentioned that a spur from the western side of the bay projects about 300 yards into the harbour, forming on its south side a small sheltered cove ui called Makallah The side of Masqat Island next the harbour is covered with the names of European ships of different nationalities painted in white upon the rocks j the custom of recording a first visit in this manner is a time-honoured one with which few vessels neglect to comply. Among the names are those of one or two Euss:in vessels which have lately been lost in the war with Japan. defences. —The principal defences of Masqat are the forts called Mirani and Jalali perched on rocks at the opposite ends of the sandy beach already mentioned; each stands on a cliff ?

These two forts, in liu notion, W ere well calculated at the time they were built by the Portuguese to command the town and to protect it both from the landward and seaward sides ; but neither of them has the slightest modern value or is in a state of even tolerable repair. Subsidiary maritime defences, also legacies of the Portuguese, are Sirat-ash-Shar- myall ^ 0n the eaStern ^ 0f ^ J lal ' b0U1 ' ab0Ut 250 ya . rdS within Ras Masqat, and Sirat-al-Gharbiyah ^ on the other side, surmounting the promontory which shelters Makallah : both these are now in ruinous state. On the landward side the water-supply of the town, situated i a mile up Wadi-al-Kabir, is protected by a^ high, square fort of Portuguese construction with machicoulis, called Rawiyah «.K; and numerous points of vantage on the hills environing the suburbs are occupied by small blockhouses, the principal of which are Burj Sa'ali /«- above the south-east corner of the town, Bosto behind the middle of the town, Burj-al-Murabba' ^ som « distance up Wadi-al-Kabir, Bnrj Damodar above the^ west end of the town, Burj Madaimin on the side towards Riyam, and Bur] Makallah on the top of the ridge that forms the west side of the harbour. At present only the Mirani and Jalali forts are occupied ; their arma- ment consists of a number of old muzzle-loading guns in bad older, t only for firing salutes. The garrisons, amounting to 2/00 men o wliom one-fourth are private retainers of the Sultan, are composed Baluchis and miscellaneous Arabs armed with rifles but destitute of military training. Tow7i and 5.—Masqat consists of a town propel, surround by walls, and of a large agglomeration of unwalled suburbs twice or thrice as extensive as the town proper. It is necessary to dea wi these separately. The town proper is about i a mile long from east to west and i of a mile deep from the sea inland. On the north side ^it fionts t e harbour and comes right down to the beach ; on the east it is enclose by precipitous hills, which a gap called Mughab divides fiom the Jalali hill; on the south and west sides the town is walled. The wa is in fairly good order and has towers at intervals : it is broken in t e middle of the south side by the Bab-as-Saghir ^ or Little Gate on the road to Sidab, immediately outside which is a good bazaar of about 40 shops and stalls, chiefly for the sale of provisions; at1182 MASQAT BAY AND TOWN Wl tl'l the south-western angle it is pierced by the Bab-al-Kabir ^ ajX )) v U or Main Gate, through which runs the route to the majority of the suburbs and to Matrah : both of these Babs are fortified gateways at which guards are stationed day and night. There is another gate of less importance at the north-western corner under Fort Mir an i which is called Bab-al-Matha'ib ^UJI v b ; it consists of a row of four small iron-grated posterns through which Wadi-al-Kabir passes on its way to the beach. Many of tho houses in the town are somewhat handsome erections of two or more storeys, built of stone, concrete or mud, and plastered with gypsum-stucco. The old mosques are low and mean, without either domes or minarets, but one of greater elegance and pretension is now (1905) in course of construction towards the east end of the town. The bazaars inside the town, containing about 300 shops, are roofed and rather dark : of the shops about 20 belong to arms dealers, 80 to money-lenders and bankers, 100 to sellers of piece-goods and 100 to provision merchants.

Arabs of the full blood are extremely few and BalucMs appear to be numerically the strongest element; next to Baluchis are probably negroes and half-caste Arabs, called Mawalid The Baluchis are soldiers, sailors, porters, servants and petty traders. There is a considerable Persian community who are shopkeepers, fish mongers and makers of quilts and bedding. Hindus number about ^00 male adults and 50 wome^ besides some children, the presence with some of them of their families being a recent innovation ; they are bankers, importers from India of rice, piece-goods, sugar and coffee, date- exporterS) silversmiths and owners of some of the best gardens in the suburbs. There are some Hadharim or Hadhramautis in the Sultan's service, with their families; and a few families of fishermen from Soqotrah come annually to the Makallah cove in the begin ning of the hot weather and remain for a month or two. There are a few Abyssinians, called Habush and Nubians, called Nuban About 20 Portuguese are settled at Masqat as general store keepers, vendors of spirits and tobacco, clerks and servants. There aie 10 Khojahs and 6 Jews at Masqat. The population of Masqat is fluctuating and is at its lowest in the hot weather when more than half the inhabitants of the suburbs leave for Sib, Barkah. and other places in Batinah in quest of a less trying climate. In winter, when the town is full, the population of Masqat may be 10,000 souls, 3,000 residing within the walls; 5,000 in the suburbs and 2,000 visitors . in size Masqat is inferior to Matrah. The principal food of e people^ apart from fish, is rice; but the poorer classes subsist ai b e ly on bread made of jowari. Resources and climate. — Masqat has no natural rssources or amenities, and firewood are all imported, with the exception of the trifling yield 4 g1186 MASQAT BAY AND TOWN of a few date trees and of some small market gardens in Wadi-al Kab' and of the excellent and abundant fish which a fleet of boats belon ' the town catch outside the entrance of the harbour every morning the weather permits. About 30 cattle and 200 sheep and goats are ke t which are fed largely on fish. The climate is equable but extreme' the heat in the sun rising to as much as 189° F. and the temperature on the house roof at night in June occasionally remaining at 106° P There are only two seasons, a cool and a hot; the cool season lasts from November to March and is attended by occasional rain and heavy stormy weather with comparatively chilly winds from the north and north-west which produce outbreaks of malarial fever. The early part of the hot weather is the healthiest season of the year. The rainfall is about # inches per annum, and most of it is received during February and March in the course of a fortnight or 3 weeks. Commerce, shipping, efe.—The choice of Masqat as capital of the country appears to have been determined by the comparative excellence of its harbour, which favoured trade and in former times enabled the Sultan to maintain a naval force and exercise some influence at sea, and by its inaccessibility, and consequent security, from the inland side. Even as a port, however, Masqat suffers from various disadvantages. The harbour lies open to the prevalent Shamal, and landing is difficult when that wind blows. ^ Again Masqat has no landward communications and all goods for the interior after being imported at Masqat must be re-shipped to some other distributing centre, generally to Matrah. Despite these drawbacks Masqat continues to be the only steam-port of 'Oman, the Matrah anchorage being regarded as unsafe, and through it passes practically the whole export and import trade of the countiy. The only local manufactures are lungis, white skull-caps embroidered with silk, matting of Makran reeds, and ornamental daggers called Khanajir. Dates are the only export of any account. The values of the principal articles of export in 1906-07 were, in lakhs of rupeesdates, 102, specie, 10^; dried fish, mother-of-pearl and pearls, 1 each; dried limes, nearly 1; and fresh fruit, The total value of the exports for the year was Rs. 36,93,820, of which Rs. 26,92,600 went to India, Rs. 8.69,000 to Turkey in Asia and smaller amounts elsewhere. The Fard dates of Masqat all go to America, where they are much esteemed; other sorts are exported to Kach, Calcutta and Rangoon, mostly in native vessels. Native sailing boats fromMASQAT BAY AND TOWN theRed Sea, mostly from Hodaidah, visit Masqat in September 0 f each year and some of them ship full cargoes of dates at Masqat ; others which have previously visited Basrah, merely complete their cargoes; both dispose of their purchases along the east coast of Africa and in Madagascar. The date-trade with India is mostly by Kutiyahs from Kaoh which come over at the beginning of August. The dates are collected at Matrah by Hindu dealers, who sometimes advance money on an instrument executed before the Qadhi to Arab brokers; in these cases the dates are brought in at harvest time by the broker, who subsequently receives commission at the rate of 2^ to 5 per cent, on the price which the Hindu merchant is able to obtain. For the Indian trade dried dates are preferred; these are dates boiled in the Ratab or semi-ripe state and then dried ; they are in request at native weddings in different parts of India. The chief imports in 1906-07 were, according to the same notation rice, 24 j arms and ammunition, 16|; cotton piece-goods, nearly 8 J ; specie, ; twist and yarn, 2 J ; silk and silk goods, 2 ; sugar and coffee, 2 each; and cereals other than rice, nearly 2. The total value of the import trade for the year was Rs. 69,21,375, of which Rs. 43,25,000 belonged to India, Rs. 7,94,900 to the United Kingdom and smaller amounts to other countries. The large import of rice is chiefly from Calcutta ; the import of wheat, which is less important, is from Karachi, Persia or Turkish 'Iraq according to the season and the prices ruling in those countries. In 1906-07, 302 steam vessels with a tonnage of 578,505 entered and left the port of Masqat ; of these 279, with a tonnage of 542, 525, were British. The shipping of Masqat port consists of 1 Baghlah owned by a Hindu British subject, of 12 large Horis for loading and unloading cargo, and of 50 small Horis for conveying passengers between Masqat and Matrah. Cargo and fishing boats are built, and larger boats are repaired, at Masqat. The boat building yard is at the mouth of Wadi-al-Kabir, below Fort M Irani. There is only one European firm at Masqat and it is British ; its consists in exporting dates and in importing piece goods. Four British firms engaged in the trade in arms and ammunition are represented by agencies. Ten Hindu firms employ about Rs. 10,00,000 in the Masqat |* a de and own house and other property, worth about Rs. 5,00,000) at Masqat j altogether there are about 35 Hindu traders, all of whom are British protection. The Hindu merchants export dates ai1 ^ ^P 01 ^ piece-goods, rice, sugar and coffee; they also deal to some 4 g a m ill M .i.J ■ I I &lt; iliJ1188 MASQAT BAY AND TOWN extent in pearls and shells. The Hindu commercial community is smaller than it once was, but its prosperity is at present on the increase in consequence of expanding trade. Five miscellaneous firms (Armenians; Goanese, etc.,) do business in arms and ammunition or in spirits and enjoy British protection. Currency, weights and measures. —The currency of Masqat is de- scribed in the article on the ; 0man Sultanate. We may add here that the usual means of payment in the foreign trade is by Hundis, here called Kundis or bills of exchange at ^Idays' sight, drawn against require- ments ; these instruments are practically accommodation bills as posses sion is not given of tiie bills of lading for the cargo against which they are drawn and there is no relation between the value of the Hundi and the value of the consignment,~a trade usage sufficient in itself to deter European firms from engaging in banking business at Masqat. The weights and measures of Masqat are the same as those of Matrah, but differ somewhat from those of the Batinah coast and other parts of 'Oman. The ordinary table of Masqat weights runs as follows :— 1 Mithqal JUlU = 57-6 grains English. 1 Riyal Jbj = ^ Mithqals = 15'8 drams „ 1 Kiyas = 6 Eiyals = 5 oz. 14*8 drams „ tti 1 Mann = 24 Kiyas = 8 R). 14 oz. 8 drams „ 1 Farasilah = 10 Manns = 88 lb. 13 oz, 14*4 drams „ 1 Bahar = 20 Frasilahs = 15 cwts. 97 lb. 4 oz. 15 drams,, Dates are sold by these weights ; so also are liquids. Saffron, musk and ottar of roses, however, are sold by a Mithqal of 62'6 grains English. uj Gold is sold by Rattis and Ibramls one Ibramis being equal to 28 Rattis : the Ibramis is equal to 54*46 grains English and the Ratti consequently to a little less than 2 grains. Civet is sold by a Waqiyab of 14*5 grains English. For transactions in grain measures of capacity are employed, namely, the Sidis and Farah *y*; a Farah consists of 40 Sidis, and 2| Farahs of ordinary wheat are equal in weight to 2 Karachi maunds. The measure of length is the actual cubit, viz.j the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle fingei. Other measures of length are the long span or Shibar and the short span or Fatar from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little and the first finger, respectively^ when distended as widely as possible,MASQAT DISTRICT -Tlie town of Masqat is personally governed by tlie Sultan without the intermediacy of a Wali. Of the gross produce of the few gardens which belong to the town is taken as a tax. There is also a municipal police tax called Hirasah which is collected monthly from the occupiers of shops and places of business. The main source of revenue is of course the sea-customs, which are noticed in the article on tk Sultanate of 'Oman. This name is not current locally ; but it is the most suitable that can be MASQAT given to that tract in the '0 man* Sultanate which surrounds Masqat Town and is enclosed between ^ adi Samail on the west, Wadi Tayin on the DISTRICT south and the sea upon the east and north, t With these limits the district has a length of about 50 miles from west-north-west to east-south-east and a maximum breadth of about 25 miles. Configuration, —Masqat District consists of a complexus of small valleys which diverge in different directions from the slopes of Eastern Hajartothesea. The principal of these valleys in order from west to east are Wadi Risail, Wadi ^Adai, Wadi Bait-al-Falaj 3 W^adi Maihaudits tributaries, Wadi-al-Hilu and Wadi Mijlas with its affluents, including Wadi Sarain, all of which are described under their own names. The surface of the district, rugged and barren in its general aspect, is chiefly occupied by this network of valleys with their intervening ridges, but in places the country opens out into small expanses of more or less level plain which possess specific names, such are W^adi Boshar and Saih Hatat; to which special articles are devoted, and Saih-al-Harmal ^ or the ' Plain of Hue,a widening of Wadi Bait-al-Faiaj, between Bait-al-Palaj and Ruwi. The coast of the Masqat District is bold, the hills everywhere east of W adi 'Adai coming right down to the se a. in the neighbourhood of Masqat Town they are volcanic and elsewhere of limestone rock. ^ or authorities maps and charts see footnote to article 'Oman Sultanate, view of pan of the coast of this district will be found in Chart No. 2313-2837 A. t Thus defined the district slightly overlaps that of Eastern Hajar, the seaward 0 pes of Hajar being concmon to both. The places common to both have been included Qr statistical purposes in the Masqat district.1190 MASQAT DISTRICT r.—Apart from tlie valleys of the interior and their villages and from!the inhabited places on the coast; among which are tlie towns of Masqat and Matrah; the district possesses few points of interest. It is necessary however to mention various routes by which fifatrah and, through Matrah, Masqat Town are placed in communica tion with central ^man. The most important of these is the westernmost which, leaving Matrah by way of Rnwi and traversing Wadi Boshar, reaches Wadi Samailnear Fanjah and soltapsthe main highway between the coast and the interior of 'Oman. Probably the second in importance is one which, starting likewise by Ruwi, follows Wadi 'Adai to a point 7 miles above Birain and thence crosses into the upper basin of Wadi Maih, whence two steep passes, ^Aqabat Qahza and ; Aqabat 'Amdah conduct into Wadi Tayin j Wadi Tayin in its turn gives access to the Sharqiyah district. A third route, running from Matrah by Ruwi to Birain, leaves Wadi 'Adai at that point and crosses direct to Wadi Maih which it ascends to its head and then, surmounting an intervening pass, descends Wadi Mijlas to Quryat on the coast. The only land route which starts from Masqat Town is one which skirts the coast south-eastwards as far as Qantab, passing through all the intermediate coast villages; at Qantab its distance from the shore increases, but Jissah. and Yiti on the sea can be reached by following it. This last route is connected with Ruwi by a track that enters it between Jissah and Yiti. Yiti is connected with two different points on the Matrah-Quryat road by tracks, one of which leads up Wadi Maih, the other up Wadi-al -Hilu. Tocography. —It remains to describe the features and places on the coast of the Masqat District : in the following table they are given in the order in which they occur from west to east and, except when the contrary is stated, they stand upon the sea.

The composition of the population by tribes can be ascertained on reference to the separate articles on the Wadis of the district and to the topographical table above. A few of the Bani Wahaib appear to be the only nomads in the Masqat district. MAS'TJD An Arab tribe of Turkish 'Iraq belonging to the neighbourhood of Karbala and inhabiting both banks of the Husainiyah canal from the Euphrates down to the Pul-i-Sufaid ; as well as some land on the Mshorab canal to the west of the Shatt-al -Hindiyah : they seem to occur also on the left bank of the Euphrates a little above Musaiyib. The bulk of the tribe dwell in hamlets of grass, thorn and mat huts sprinkled along the banks of the Husainiyah canal, but the leading men have brick-built castles. The Mas^ud are about 7,000 souls. As a tribe they are reputed brave, generous and hospitable, and they have about 1,000 horses; but only the Shaikhs possess modern firearms. In religion they are Shi^ahs; by occupation they are agriculturists and graziers owning cattle, buffaloes and sheep. They are generally at feud with the Yasar and live in amity and alliance with the Janabiyin. Tbe small Khadhirat and Zumailat tribes are politically dependent on the(C4r MATRAH 1197 \ } and some would even classify the latter as a section of the Mas'ud. The Mas'ud joined the townspeople of Karbala in their rebellion in 1843 against the Turkish Government. They are exempt from conscription for Turkish military service. The official Shaikh of the tribe, recognised by the Turks, is Ibrahim-ibn-Haji Hatmi ; but the real Shaikh is Haji Sa'ud, eldest son of Haji Hatmi ; there is not however any dissension between these two. The Mas'ud comprise the following sections: Al Bu Ghanim ^^ J?, Harirj^ J obliLoI Inaqabat, Qarid and Shukan : in all there are about 15 different subdivisions. The Mas'ud are said to be of Shammar origin. The largest town in the Sultanate of 'Oman, and the most important ]y[ATRAH* commercially. Mat rah is situated on the south-west side of Mat rah Bay and is about 2 miles west of Masqat Town. Like Masqat it is enclosed on the landward sides by rugged volcanic hills ; but its isolation from the interior is less complete^for an easy route leads through a pass called Kharashlf to Bait-al-Falaj and Euwi, whence routes described in the article on Masqat District diverge to various parts of ; 0man. The ordinary way to Masqat Town lies by Matairah and Riyam along the coast j there is also a more inland route across the hills. Communication with the capital^ however, is maintained chiefly by boat, the passage occupying in a rowing-boat about | of an hour. The bay of Matraht is 1,400 yards wide^ 1,200 yards deep and shoals regularly from 8 fathoms at the entrance to the beach on which the town stands. In appearance it is less remarkable than the bay of Masqat ; but, though open to the north-east, it is sheltered from the north-west, is more easily entered, and is preferred as a harbour by ordinary native craft. The town extends along the water's edge for f of a mile and has a mean depth inland of about 250 yards. The fort, a Portuguese construc tion of the same type as the forts at Masqat, stands on a rocky eminence at the east end of the town which, like Masqat, is defended, where nature has left it unprotected, by a wall with fortified gateways ; the most important gate is the Bab-al-Kabir a t the south-west corner of the town, by which the Ruwi road leaves Mat rah. Several blockhouses, as Masqat, command the approaches through the hills. The Customs House is on the beach slightly to the west of the fort. In the centre of i^J^nupon the sea-front stands the fortified quarter inhabited by the * The map and chart for Matrah a 'e the same as for Masqat Town, q. v. f See Admiralty Plan No.2372—2869,1198 MATE AH Kh5jah community and generally known as tlie Khojah Fort; behind it, some distance to the north-west of the Bab-al-Kabir, is the Bab-as- Saghir • About midway between the Customs House and the Khojah Fort a hollow^ coming from the Bab-al-Kabir and known as Khor Bambah ^ , reaches the sea.

But whereas at Masqat there are many Hindus and almost no KhSjahS; here Khojahs are numerous and Hindus compara- tivelyifew, the Khojahs numbering about 1,050 souls, while the Hindus are only about 30 men, of whom 7 or 8 have their families with them. The population of Matrah is greater than that of Masqat, and the permanent inhabitants are about 9,000 within and 5,000 outside the walls, or in all about 14,000 souls, of whom at least half are Baluchis. The predominant Arab tribes are Bani Hasan, Siyablyin, Rahbiyin and Bani Jabir. The bulk of the trade of up-country 'Oman, apart from the mere shipping and unshipping of goods which takes place mostly at Masqat, is concentrated at Matrah; and its volume and character appear from the article on Masqat Town. Matrah is the loading and unloading place of all caravans for and from the interior. The import and export trade is mostly in the hands of the Kh5jallS and Hindus, who are as a rule general merchants and shopkeepers not confining themselves to parti cular lines of business. Both classes import rice from Calcutta and piece goods, sugar, oil, iron and spices from Bombay and export wet and dried dates; the Khojahs also export some quantity of dried fish of the small sardine variety called Matut. ^§ome of the Hindu merchants settled at Matrah visit the Samail valley and 'Oman Propei.' in person to purchase dates. Of the Hindu merchants 10 and of the Kh5jah merchants 38 at present enjoy British protection. To the port of Matrah belong 7 Baghlahs and 20 Badans, all owned by Khojahs The town is governed by a Wali on behalf of the Sultan of 'Oman and has a garrison of 100 ^Askaris. ituat jfcl# iltf jilto lit jif is s Wj litiibi MU iiisi MAT^TI (SABA- (KHAT)* 'i This is the name used among the inhabitants of ''Oman; but by- dwellers in Qatar and the Hasa Sanjaq it is generally called Sabakhat 'Oman, and sometimes it is even spoken of as Wadi Sabakhah.

Inland it extends probably 60 miles ; and its length is possibly greater at a distance from the coast than it is upon the sea. Sabakhat Matti is enclosed, landwards, by Mijan on the west, by Jafurah and possibly the Ruba'-al-Khali on the south, and by Dhafrah on the east. The well of Sufuk in Jafurah marks approximately the boundary of Sabakhat Matti on the south. The whole of the district appears to be a saline or nitrous marsh, the extreme of desolation, without wells or grass, or even mangroves at the coast. It is said that the sea runs up the middle of the Sabakhah at high tide for as much as 12- or 15 miles and that camels in that part of it are liable to be lost. Ordinary travellers prefer to pass it by sea, and the crossing is so difficult, and even dangerous, that the Manasir Bedouins in their periodical migrations between Dhafrah and Qatar avoid it by deviating into the Jafurah desert to the south, A large and picturesque village in Wadi Tayin in the Sultanate of 'Oman, about 10 miles above Hail-al-Ghaf; it is the capital of the Bani Battash tribe and has a population of about 1,700 persons, all Bani Battash and their dependants, among the last being Bani Na^ab. It stands on both sides of the Wadi, but chiefly on the right bank. The following are the quarters of the village :—' Name and quarter. Ghubairah Jazir Position, On the north-west side. Do.

The hills enclose it on west, north and east; on the south it lies open towards the flat districts of Dashtistan and Zira and it is believed to have formed originally a part, administratively, of Dashtistan. Mazara'i is itself a plain and suffers extremes of heat in summer. The inhabitants are Persian-speaking Shi'ahs, immigrants from Kazarun, Khisht and Daris, and number about 3,000 souls ; they cultivate wheat, barley and dates and export sonie wool and dates and a considerable quantity of gum, collected in the hills, to Bushejir Town. The eastern part of the districtis irri MAZARA'I VILLAGE in summer from the Daliki stream by a channel which first ^ through Zira. The imports and the details of trade generally do not Mer from those of the other small districts near Bushehr. The local Hashim Man is equal to 20 Mans of Bushehr or 155 lbs. English. Mazara 'i possesses about 700 donkeys^ besides a few mules and horses : the people are well armed with rifles and revolvers. The Salar-i- Mua'zzam realises about 2,500 Tumans per annum from the district, which be has farmed to the Khan of Shabankareh ; the latter is repre sented locally by an agent and takes half the produce of the dates, either in cash or kind, and 60 Qrans in cash per Gau of other cultivation.

The majority are found in Abu Dhabi terri tory, where they are regarded as a section of tbe Bani Yas tribe, and the number of these is computed in the article on the Abu Dhabi PrincipaUty : besides these some are found in Dlbai Town. Similarly, the Mazari' of the 'Oman Sultanate are dealt with in the general article on that state, and an estimate of their strength is given there. The remainder are subjects of the Shaikh of Sharjah inhabiting Wadis Ham and Sfuni in tbe Ras-al- Khaimah District and Wadi Sfai in the district of Shamailiyah : in Wadi Ham, where they hold the villages of Adhan, 'Asimah and Fara', their number is about 500 souls; in Wadis Sfuni and Sfai it has not been ascertained but is probably incon siderable. Besides these there are perhaps 300 Mazarf at the village of Khan near Sharjah Town. The extent to which the Mazari' are regarded, outside Abu Dhabi territory, as a section of the Bani Yas is uncertain; as a rule they are Ghafiri in politics and Hanbali in religion. MTAIDIN The principal valley in the southern slopes of Jabal Akhdhar (WADI) in the Sultanate of ; Oman ; it drains to 'Oman Proper. At its head is the village of Sharaijah : 3,000 feet lower is the village of Musairah chiefly remarkable for the possession of a date-grove at an unusual elevation; it consists of 200 houses of the Habus tribe. Below Musairah is Mi'aidin, a pretty village under a cliff, well-watered and possessed of date, lime and other trees; it is composed of 30 houses of Habus. A small hamlet called Misfah sliiwe is 3 miles below Mi'aidin : near it the banks of the 'Wadi begin to recede and decrease in height and vegetation grows moie abundant as the exit from the hills is approached: Misfah containsMIJAN 120S 40 horses of Habus. The crops in the villages are wheat, sugarcane and lucerne; and grapes, figs, quinces, limes and pomegramates are grown. The only animals are a score of cattle. In the plain of 'Oman Proper Wadi Mi'aidin passes Birkafc-al -Moz, and further on it probably joins Wadi Halfain. The descent into the upper part of the valley from Sharaijah is accomplished by means of an artiticial causeway or stair case which is practicable for horses. The valley contains 3 small but perennial streams. The banks of the Wadi exhibit a dark-bluish veined limestone and a very brittle ferruginous shale.

Inland it is bounded by the Jaftirah desert on the west and south and by the Sabakhat Matti tract on the east. On the coast its limits are Dohat-an-Nakhalah oq the west and Dohat-as-Sila^ on the east and its average breadth may be about 20 miles, while southwards its boundary with Jafurah is perhaps 70 miles from the sea. The Mijan district is full of stony mounds, apparently as much as 50 or 60 feet high ; at the foot of these lie firm pebbly tracts^ but sand dunes also occur between. The mounds and firmer soil, it is said^ are covered in winter with green grass, while Abal and dwarf tamarisk are found throughout the year.

Its principal Village is Sawaqim a pretty hamlet of 20 houses of A1 Bu Said on the right bank about 8 miles above Quryat, where there is a date-plantation and country-house belong ing to Sa J id-bin-Khalfan^ A1 Bu Sa'ldi. Not far from it^ in the hills to the soutliwardj are two other small places, Mizra ; Sumair ji** houses of Bani Wahaib, and Mizra' Balail 15 houses of Wahaib : the inhabitants are cultivators. The two valleys which by their junction form Wadi Mijlas may conveniently be disposed of here. Wadi Haithadh is short and conies from the north i it contains the villages of Haithadh (30 houses), %adh (20 houses), and Haifal (15 houses), all of Bani who cultivate grain* The other valley, W adi Sarain ^ore than 20 miles west of its junction with W 7 adi Haithadh: at MIJLAS (WADI)MlNlB MSTBIOT 1209 Minab District is bounded on the west by the sea; on the north by a line running from the mouth of the Shamil river to the Zitidan hills so as to pass immediately north of the village of Miyan Shehr; on the east by the crest of the Zindan hills till the village of Garuk is almost reached. At this point the boundary turns to the south -west and, passing between the villages of Taling and Garuk, leaves the village of Guwasmand in Biyaban, and then runs westwards by southwards to the sea between Ziyarat in Minab and Bundram in Biyaban. With these limits the district has a length of about 45 miles and a depth inland of about 25. Thnical characteristics. —The Minab district is a plain reaching from the foot of the hills on the east to the sea on the west. The coast generally is low and swampy, with a number of creeks too small to admit native craft of more than medium size and containing as a rule only saltwater; of these the principal is Khur Minab which is elsewhere described under its own name. Near the coast the country is every where a saline swamp, bearing only coarse grass and tamarisk bushes or, in the immediate neighbourhood of the sea, mangroves. The north western corner of the district, inland from the coast^ is a sandy desert so strongly impregnated with salt that nothing can grow in it. The remainder of the district is fertile and is well cultivated, partly by rainfall and partly by dint of irrigation from the Minab river and other smaller streams from the hills. The Minab river has at Minab Town a bed-width of 400 to 600 yards and usually carries a fair volume of water. In March the stream flows about 1 foot deep and 200 yards wide; in summer it is drained almost dry by various irrigation canals; in winter it runs at a higher level and sometimes becomes difficult of passage. At ordinary times but little water reiches the sea at its mouth, which is on the coast about 7 miles south-east of the entranci of &amp;hur Minab. The principal canals depend ent on the Minab river are one which takes off from the right bank at Basreh and waters several villages to the west and another which leaves left bank and runs through Minab Town to some of the southern villages. The water of the river is good and drinkable. The only other breams in the district deserving of notice are the Mazavi a broad but shallow flow, which crosses the district to the sea S8 veral miles south of the Minab river, and the Chahlak ♦JXaU. which disembogues one mile to the south of Kiahiistak.1210 m I n A b district The hills* forming the eastern boundary of the district and called Kuh-i-Zindan, or in the north where they adjoin the Rudbar district Kuh-i-Kudbar, are rugged of outline and barren of vegetation except for a few ber trees. Climate. —-By natives Minab is considered to be much healthier than Bandar 'Abbas, and shade and flowing water combine to render it at least cooler. In summer many Bandar ^ Abbasis migrate to Minab to escape the terrible heat of their own town. But mosquitoes abound and even early in March are sometimes so numerous as to make life a burden. Rain is said to fall more copiously in Minab than on any other part of the Persian coast within 150 miles on either side of it. Population.— P l majority of the inhabitants of the Minab district are Persians of mixed descent, in whom a Baluchi strain predominates over other foreign elements ; the rest are for the most part genuine Baluchis, or Arabs who are believed to have immigrated from Bahrain, etc. The total population, inclusive of the permanent inhabitants of Minab Town, may be placed at 26,000 souls. The most part are Shi^ahs, Sunnis being found only among the Baluchis and the Arab immigrants. The topographical table at the end of this article will iriake plain in detail the distribution of the population and their means b£ livelihood. In the interior all are date-growers, stock-raisers or ordi nary agriculturists ; on the coast there are some fishermen and sailors. The people on the whole are fairly well-to-do and most of them inhabit mud-brick hotises, only the poorest labourers occupying the date-leaf hute which in soine adjoining districts are the most common kind of dwelling. The character of the people is less degraded than in the neighbourhood of Bandar 'Abbas, a circumstance which is attribiited to the less direct aiid oppressive form which Persian Government here assumes ; as agriculttlrists they are reputed thrifty and careful. The language of the district is a local patois compounded of Persian, Arabic and Bal&amp;clii, Persian Words predoijainating. Few arms are carried Or owned in Minab, notwithstanding that the district was lintil lately upon a high road of the Persian Gulf rifle trade with Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Agriculture and trade, —The staple industry is the cultivation of dates, but wheat and barley, besides henna, vegetables, and fruits such as # A delineation of some of these bilk, as seen from the sea, will be found in Chait No. 2378—2837A., Persian Qulf.MlNAB DISTRICT citrons, limes ; lemons, oranges, mangoes and plantains, are grown in considerable quantities.* The chief facts about trade are given in the article on Minab Town, which is the only trade centre in the district; here it may be added that an illicit trade with Afghanistan and Baluchistan in imported rifles which formerly flourished here has now been all but suppressed by the reformed Persian Customs. Communicationsi transport and water supply. —The principal routes in the district are four, as follow :— 1. A portion of the coast-route between Minab and Bandar 'Abbas : this is the continuation of Route No. 1 of the paragraph on communications in the article on the Shamil district and no further remarks are necessary here, except that the section within the Minab district is divided at Dudau, which is 14 miles from Minab Town and 16 from Qultighan in the Shamil district. I, A small portion of the route between Minab Town and Shamil Village lies in the Minab district; vide RouteNo. 4 in the paragraph and article already cited. It will be seen, on reference to Route No, 5 in the same placej that faavellers proceeding from Mfaiab Town to Bam or Kirman may go by Shamil Village^ joining the Bandar ^bbas -Kirman route at Tang-i-Zindan. 3. There is a route over the hills from Minab Town by the Gardaneh Asyai and Murad Kushteh passes to Manujan whence, as ex plained under Route No. 4 in the passage cited above, ways lie to Sistan and Khurasan. 4. The route to Jashk runs fromMinSb Town to Kal&amp;vi (25 miles) by Kokogaz, Hazarmani, Kahatak, Majbun andDahi Qand j there is also a route a few miles shorter by Hazarmani, Ju Mahalleh and Dahi Qand. The continuation beyond Kalavi is given in the paragraph on communications in the article on the Biyaban District. The above routes are no better than those of SouthhEastern Persia generally ; but in dry weather they are free from difficulty for mounted flien and pack animals, at least until they enter the hilly country. w A rough estimate of the land transport owned in the Minab District shows that there are about 1,000 camels and an equal number of donkeys. * Iu the 10th century A. D. the crops of the district included maize, indigo, sugar aa &lt;l cummin: palm groves also were numerous at that time. See Le Strange's of the Eastern Caliphate.1212 MlNlB T)T STRICT As will appear from tlie village list at the end of this article the number of boats belonging to the coast villages is inconsiderable. It should be noted that the water supply in many villages of the Minab district, though described as good in accordance with native information; is probably only drinkable. Administration. —The district is ruled by an official who has his seat at Minal) Town. He is at present a nominee of the Mu'm-ut- Tujjar of Tehran who holds the district in farm from the Persian Government. Minab, however^ is subject in some respects to the Governor of the Gulf Ports ; and his subordinate, the Deputy-Governor of Bandar 'Abbas, is supposed to exercise a certain degree of authority over the official in charge of Minab ; no signs of control however are apparent. The Mu^n-ut-Tujjar^s agent dispenses a rude form of criminal and civil justice and is responsible for the collection annually o£ 14,000 Tiimans as land revenue. Except this Malyat or land revenue no taxes are collected in the district, which in this respect is more fortunate than Shamil or Bandar ^Abbas. The agent's behests are enforced by a small corps of about 30 Tufangchis; and about 20 rifles of regular Persian infantry have recently been stationed in the district to support the authority of the Imperial Persian Customs. The operations of the Imperial Customs establishment iu the district are supervised by a Persian Mudir stationed at Minab Town: his pay is 40 Tumans a month and he has under his orders a small post at Tiyab and another at Kuhistak. The leading men of the district are Muhammad Baqir of Minab Town, who is a native of the place, and Shaikh Hasan of Yazd, a large landed proprietor who was Deputy-Governor of Minab about 1901 but now spends most of his time at Bandar ' Abbas.

A salt water creek in the Minab District^ providing an incomplete MINAB a Pproach from the sea towards the district capital of Minab : its mouth is - or _ situated about 33 miles east by south of Bandar 'Abbas and 19 miles ^ % south of Minab Town.

During and after the date harvest, in August; Sep tember and October, a considerable trade is carried on here, as many as 20 boats arriving and leaving on the same day ; these are mostly from Qishm and Bandar 'Abbas, but a few are from the coast of Arabia and even from India. The Minab creek makes an indifferent harbour j the bar, as already mentioned, is shallow, while the inner channel, which at its head degenerates into a mere ditch, cannot be used by native boats exceeding 20 tons burden and at low water is impracticable even for these. During a Shamal vessels can neither enter nor leave Khur Minab and accidents in attempting to do so are not uncommon. From the accounts of the mediaeval geographers, Arab and Persian, it Would seem that the original town of Hormuz, on the mainland, must have lain on Khur Minab, probably in the vicinity of the present Tiyab.* MINAB _or _ MINAU TOWN In English formerly ' Minnow' The capital of the Minab District and the only populous or important place of the Persian Coast anywhere east of Bandar 'Abbas j it is situated about 28 miles south-south-east of Shamil Village and nearly 50 miles due east of Bandar ? Abbas, at a distance of about 15 miles in a direct line from the nearest point on the sea. Minab stands on the left bank of the Minab river and is immediately commanded on the east side by some hills, which rise to 640 feet and carry a large (but very dilapidated) fort overlooking the town ; the whole hill side is covered with remains of towers, bastions and walls. The greater part of the town consists of mat huts, but at the foot of the hill on which the fort stands is a quarter, about 5 acres in extent, with many good and substantial houses; this quarter was originally enclosed, but the wall which surrounded it has now almost entirely * The town on the mainland was abandoned, on account of the attacks of robber tribes, about 1315 A. D., the ruler transferring his seat to the itland now Ciilled Hormuz. See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate.MINAB TOWN 1227 disappeared, only the towers and bastions which belonged to it remaining k situ. On the south side are extensive plantations and gardens, and here begins an enormous date-belt^ about 6 miles in breadth, which follows the course of the Minab river half the way to the sea ; it belongs to various villages mentioned in the article on the Minab District. There are in all not less than 2,000 houses in Mmab Town, and the population may be estimated at 10,000 souls in summer, when the place is partly occupied by immigrants from Bandar 'Abbas, Hormuz and the adjoining rural districts ; the minimum winter population possibly does not exceed 7,000. The inhabitants are described as civil and oblig ing : the ma jority of them are Persians of no particular tribe, a considerable proportion of them being natives of the Rudbar district upon the upper course of the Minab river. Large numbers of Arabs and negroes also are among the inhabitants; and there are at present 14 Hindus and 17 Khojahs who are British subjects. The Khojahs, who are from Sind, are accompanied by their families, but the Hindus are not; the former have 2, and the latter 5 places of business. The Persians of Minab Town are all Shi'ahs. Nearly the entire popula tion is dependent on date and fruit culture, but a few are engaged in the manufacture of Lungis or coloured check cloths, and others live by trade. Dates, tobacco, henna^ oranges, citrons, lemons, plantains and mangoes are grown, and the town can furnish about 200 donkeys, 300 camels and 400 cattle. The bazaar is large and better supplied than that of Bandar 'Abbas, and carpenters and blacksmiths are here obtainable. Exports consist chiefly of dates, corn, vegetables, fruit, henna, wool, ghi and hides, while imports include piece-goods, rice, sugar, tea, kerosine oil and dried fish ; a portion of the trade really belongs to ^the Rudbar district in the interior which produces the greater part of the wool, ghi and hides exported. The town is the only trade centre of the Minab District; its currency, weights and measures are identical with those of Bandar ^ Abb as. Every kind of supply is obtainable at Minab, and water, which is from the Minab river and canals dependent on it, is good and abundant. There are a few wells. The Deputy-Governor of the Minab District has his residence here, and ®ere is also a Mudir of the Imperial Persian Customs ; the authority of tah is supported by the presence of a small detachment of 20 Persian infantry. There are shrines of Hazrat 'Abbas, Zain-ul-^Abidm, and Shah Wali. The elements of a Muhammadan education are imparted in two or three mosques : these are the only tuitional establishments.1228 MIRBACHEH A village with an elevation of 310 feet above the level of the se^ situated in the Rclmuz District about 11 miles west by south of Ramnz Town on the main track from that place to Nasiri. Mirbacheh stands on a mound about 80 feet high^ ascended by steep narrow paths and crowned at the summit by a fort-like enclosure ; on the north-east, east and south-east sides the village spreads downwards to the plain, and on the north, west and south it is surrounded by plantations of young date trees, while to the south-west there is a detached date grove and on that side a garden extends to a distance of about half a mile from the mound. In winter the surrounding plains are grassy. The salt Muwailheh stream, described in the article on Raftmz District, passes about 2 miles to the west of the village ; and at a mile on the east side of Mirbacheh a stream of fresh water ^ yards wide and 2 or 3 feet deep is encountered, besides other smaller channels, flowing to the north-westward. The ground on this side is boggy and treacherous, but the channels are now bridged with logs. These streams of fresh water on the east of Mirbacheh are said to have their origin in a perennial spring some 10 or 12 miles south or south-east of the village, of which the discharge is sometimes conducted by a channel, known as the Ab-i-Ju ^Abdullah, to the lands between Mirbacheh and the Muwailheh stream ; it is possible also that they are connected with the Zarnini stream of the Ramuz District. The place consists of rather over 100 houses^ of which 2 or 3 belong to Lurs and the remainder to Bani Lam Arabs of the Kiuanah section : the inhabitants possess about 70 rifles. The irrigated lands are estimated at 90 Khish or ploughs^ the unirrigated at 80 Khish ; the annual yield of the same in grain, which here includes rice, is placed at 5,000 Ramuz Mans. Date palms number about 6,000, on the average 15 years old, and are the property of the villagers. Transport animals and other livestock are 40 horses, a large number of donkeys, 400 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. The village is the property of the Ttizad-us-Sultan, one of the Bakhtiyari ruling family. Irrigated land is assessed at J of the gross produce and unirrigated at 25 Qrans per Khish per annum. * Or perhaps more commonly Marbacheh.

It consists of about 200 houses, of which 100 belong- to the Jarawinah, 80 to the ''Amairah and 20 to the Subaih section of the tribe. Wheat, jowari, and lucerne are grown ; the date, mango, plantain, Nabaq, fig and vine flourish ; the fields are fenced with thorny Nabaq branches and irrigated with water brought in channels from springs. Animals are 30 camels, 20 donkeys, 120 cattle and 1 ; 000 sheep and goats j date-palms are estimated at 4 ,000. Miskin stands on the usual route between Dhank and Rustaq, and from it two routes lead to Batinah, one over the Najd of the Wadi-al -Hawasinah, and the other over the Najd of its tributary the Wadi Dhula' further to the west: the latter is the more direct.

Running water is found in this valley. There are some cattle but not many other animals in the villages. The settled population of the valley and villages connected with it may be estimated at 1,500 souls. A long valley or depressed tract in the extreme north of the Sanjaq of Hasa ; it is distinguished by its comparative fertility from the regions which surround it upon every side and it owes its name, 'The Valley of Waters to its numerous wells and springs. Boundaries and extent. —Wadi-al-Miyah is considered to begin in the north at the Na^airiyah hill. From that point its border, curving out to the westwards, runs by the isolated hill of ^Uduwat to the ridge of Abu Dhahair, which it follows southwards to its termination; the remainder of the boundary on the west side is defined by the northern part of the TafU range. A line which leaves Jabal-at-Taff immediately north of the Jau-al-Ghanam portion of Habl and goes almost straight eastwards to Jabal Qadam marks the limit of Wadi-al-Miyah on the south; and on the east side its perimeter is completed by an almost straight boundary which runs northwards and very slightly westwards by Jabal Qadam, Jabal Labtalah and Jabal-al-Hass back to Jabal Na^airiyah. With these limits the extent of Wadi-al-Miyah from north to south is about 90 miles and its greatest breadth, which is in the southern half, is about 30 miles. It should be observed, however, that some Bedouins would greatly increase the dimensions of Wadi-ai- Miyah by including in it so much of Habl as lies further west than Jabal Qadam, and even the low-lying parts of Taff as far as the wells Judah; and Bedouins are also found who consider SanfaH-al -Hanna to be a subdivision of Wadi-al-Miyah. Position. —The districts surrounding IVadi-al-Miyah are thus Warai'ah in the Kuwait Principality upon the north-west, Summan on the west, Habl on the south; and, on the east, Habl as far north as Jabal Labtalah, then Sanfan-al-Hanna from Jabal Labtalah to Jabal-al-Hass, and finally Eadaif between Jabal-^l-Hass and Jabal Na^airiyah. MIYAH (WADI- AL-)MIIAH (WADI-AL-) 1231 Physical characteristics, —The soil of W adi-al-Miyah is dark brown jind perfectly cultivable; the fall of the land is generally from west to east After heavy rain the ground in the northern part of the district is said to be flooded to such an extent that the Bedouins move all their camps to the southward of Qubaibah, where the land is slightly higher. In spring the valley is covered with grass, which is in places 3 feet high, and the water overflows from many of the wells j in summer the water level is generally about 12 feet below the surface. At Bakha, Mughati, Halaisiyah and other places there are flowing springs. Population and villages. —Besides the Bedouins who visit the district therein a small settled population, inhabiting the three permanent villages of Kta; Mulaijah and Sarrar and the temporary' village of Kahafah; of these Nta/ is described elsewhere under its own name, and the others are dealt with in the paragraph on topography below. The settled population is very mixed and includes representatives of the ''Aj mail, J Awazim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Rashaidah and Southern Shammar tribes. The crops generally grown are dates, wheat, barley, maize and lucerne; livestock are horses, camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats. Notwithstanding the distance from the sea some of the people go to the pari fisheries. Political position, —The inhabitants of Wadi-al-Miyah are said at the present time to pay Zakat to the Shaikh of Kuwait, but the Shaikh does not regard the district as forming part of his territories. The local authority is the Shaikh of Nta', at present Ibrahim-bin-''Abdur Rahman. The sites of deserted towns and villages are numerous, from which it may be inferred that Wadi-al-Miyah was once more populous and politically more important than it is now : among the places at which these occur are, ; Aqair, ; Ataiyiq, ''Awainah, Bakha, Mishafin, Muraighah and Thaj.

YcystutioV/) cultivutiOTi (tud duiTticils, —'W^ithin a radius of 3 miles of Shushtar Town there are many Kunars and date palms; further to the south the only trees are the dates of 'village plantations. In spring Miyanab is covered with vegetation, the grass sometimes reaching to a horse's belly; but in winter there is no greenery except in the neighbourhood of villages, where the people cultivate the ground with the ordinary wooden-shared plough of ; Arabistan drawn, here as elsewhere; by horses, mules, buffaloes and even donkeys. The northern end of the island was once highly cultivated. It was also irrigated by the Minau canal from Shushtar Town and about one-fourth of it is still so served, among the villages which benefit being Kunarpir, Mehdiabad, Tabatti and Yissareh; but the total area of Miyanab is only about 270 square miles and the whole could be watered from the Minau canal, if improved and properly worked. The supplies of Shushtar Town, except fuel, are, so far as not brought from 'Aqili, mostly derived from Miyanab. Tlie game of the tract comprises mallard, teal, snipe, plover, francolin, sandgrouse and pigeon; there are also jackals and pig, and there were formerly lions. Inhabitants. —In the south the people of Miyanab are mostly Anafijeh Arabs, elsewhere they are chiefly Bakhtiyaris of the Shir Ali section. The remainder of the population are for the most part detribalised Arabs, called Miyanab Arabs, or Shushtaris. Communications. —The land route connecting Shushtar Town with Band-i-Qir is about 30 miles in length; it runs direct from Shushtar Town to the village of ; Arab Hasan on the Shatait, which is a much used and convenient halting place though rather nearer to Band-i Qir than to Shushtar, and thence it goes to Band-i-Qir ; the track is liable to become difficult after rain. There are two variants of this route, one fliore easterly for the whole way, and the other more westerly between ShUshtar and ^Arab Hasan, but they are hardly ever used. Topography.—The riverain villages of Miyanab will be found in the Nicies on the Shatait and Gargar rivers: those of th6 interior are 41^ MIYANAB or_ MIYAN- DAB1286 MIYANAB described in the following table, whence further particulars of population K cultivation and irrigation in Miyanab can be extracted from the column ! of remarks Name, Position.

MIYA- Singular Miyahi This tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate d iU? ar 0 also called Bani Ghafir but the alternative name is ambiguous and is apt to lead to confusion between the Miyayihah and the Ghafiri political faction, to which they belong and to which they gave their name. The Miyayihah are found chiefly in Western Ha jar, in Wadi Bani Ghafir, where they occupy the villages of Dhab^a (25 houses), Kahaf (30 houses), Dhawaihir (20 houses), Taiyib (25 houses), Eijlah (20 houses), Qarti (40 houses), Ruwaibi (15 houses), Difa ; (30 houses)^ Marji (50 houses), Khafdi (30 houses), Tabaqah (20 houses), Dihas (20 houses), ^Amar (25 houses), and Zawajir (35 houses); in Wadi Sahtan, where they have Khadhra (40 houses) ; and in Wadi Tara/ where their villages are Rustaq (400 houses), Mizahit (65 houses) and Hazam (40 houses) : but they also occur at Dariz (200 houses) in Wadi-al -Kabir, at Bait-al-'Ainain (20 houses) in W adi Sanaisal, and at Wahrah (100 houses) in Wadi Sharsah^ in the district of Dliahirah» They are found too at Bahlah in ''Oman Proper (30 houses). Tho^e of Marji and Mizahit belong to- a section called Bani Salman uUU, those of Dihas to a section known as Salamiyin and those of Bahlah are Maqarishah but it has not been possible to obtain a complete account of the subdivisions of the tribe; there is also a section styled Khanabisnah &lt;*^1^ , located in the villages of Niztik (20 houses) and Madmah (25 houses) in the Wadi-al-Hoqain section of Wadi Bani Ghafir. The Miyayihah are not a very large tribe, numbering perhaps 7,000 soulfr , but they have a reputation for valour and skill i' war, and in 1881 gave ample proof of pugnacity by being simultaneously at feud with eight other tribes. The Miyayihah at Dariz are Sunnis, the rest are ]badhis : none are Hedouins. The Miyayihah have not now, and never had, as a tiibe, any t dominant position in the Ghafiri political faction: that the faction Was named after them was a circumstance due not. to the strength of theMORRAH (AL) 1239 tribe but to tbe^personal energy and talents of their Shaikh, Muham- mad-bin-Nasir, who commanded the Ghafiriyah in the earliest struggle between that coalition and their rivals the Hinawiyah. The Tamimah of the Miyayihah nevertheless till lately continued to be titular Tarmmah of the whole Ghafiri faction, but this is not now the case. In 1881 the office of Tamimah of the Ghafiriyah was held by Barghash- bin-Hamaid, a member of an almost extinct family: he was subsequently murdered by a younger brother, and if the Ghafiris have now a general head it is probably ^Abdullah-bin-Salim of the Bani Bu 'Ali tnbei The present leading Shaikhs of the Miyayihah are Saif-bin- Hamad and his two brothers in Wadi Bani Ghafir and Muhammad-bin- Sulaiman and his sons at Darizs. The singular is Morri cjy. A considerable Arab tribe, altogether Bedouin, of Eastern Arabia; they are notorious for their misdeeds; but otherwise less is known of them than of any other tribe of equal size and importance in the same region of Arabia. Distrihitlon. —The Al Morrah inhabit the country in the south of tibe Hasa Sanjaq and that adjoining it but lying beyond its border on the same side: some are generally to be found in Kharmah near the wells of Zarnuqah; they visit Barr-adh -Dhahran j and their raiders sometimes infest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants of the Jafurah desert j Jab rill is their property; they sometimes visit Qatar in their peregrinations ; and they frequent the district of ^ Aqal to a certain extent. A few Al Morrah are among the Bedouins who resort annually to 'Anik in the Qatif Oasis and who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place. Religion, character, mode of life and language Al Morrah are tlanbali Sunnis in name, but concern themselves little with religion. They appear to be the wildest, most dangerous, and least civilised of the nomad tribes in this part of Arabia, and to exist, to an appreciable extent, by plunder. They are said to be staunch friends to those whom they recognise as neighbours j but otherwise they are treacherous and untrustworthy, and they sometimes betray persons who take sanctuary with them.1240 MORRAH (AL) The principal wealth of the A1 Morrah is in camels; but they have also some horses and many sheep and goats. Their tents are small and black : some of them have no tents. Of the sections enumerated below only the A1 ''Adhbah^ A1 Bahaih^ Al Fahaidah and A1 Shabib have either kerchiefs or ''Abas. The tribe as a whole avoid towns and villages. Those of the Al Morrah who enter Jafurah do so in winter, and while there they have often no drink other than the milk of their camels and are reduced to boiling their rice in the same. It is said that the sections which frequent Jafurah wear a specially thick footgear made of camel hair to protect their feet from the burning sand, that their complexion is of a swarthiness unusual among Arabs, and that their camels are generally dark-coloured. The dialect of Arabic spoken by the Al Morrah is peculiar, and to other Arabs they appear to talk ' in a stammering way' Divisions and numbers, —The following table contains all that is known about the internal structure of the tribe:— Section.

The Amirs of the Wahhabis sent L frequent expeditions against the Al Morrah; but one only, led by the Amir Faisal, was partially successful j his forces, however, reacHed the scene of action in such a feeble State, owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement and returned to Najd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with their postal service in the Hasa Sanjaq the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Shaikh of the Al Morrah, to the Shaikhs of the Al 'Adhbah and Ghafran subsec tions, and to Muhammad-as-Sa'ak of the Al Bahaih subsection: but these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 1865 the Al Morrah were paying the value of 13,000 as revenue to the W;ahhabi. Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported Ithe Wahhabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Sa J ad. = A large village in the 'Oman Sultanate obi the northern limits of the (•oTT^rr k&lt;v m 'Oman Proper, situated at the point about 6 miles west of Izki ^ ^ where Wadi Mi'aidin emerges from Jabal Akkdliar. It consists of ...... three Hujrahs or quarters, appropriated respectively to tlie Al'Umair, * ^ to the Bani Riyam and to tenants of Al Bu Ba'ldi landlords; the population is about 1,400, about 1,&amp;60 belongdng' to the Bani Riyam and 160 to other tribes. There are large date-g'roves containing about 15,000 trees, and the plantains to which the place owes its name are numerous. Irrigation is by Palaj. Bait Ruda,id.ah a fort|b?) MU'ADHDHAM 1243 and residence^ consisting of a rectangular enclosure with an upper storey and towers at the corners, lies to the west of the village and is separated from Birkat-al-Moz by a conical hill with a watch-tower commanding the water-supply. This fort belonged in 1876 to a relation of the Sultan of 'Oman, one Hamad, son of Hilal-bin-Muhammad who was murdered by Qais in 1864 ; it is at present (1906) in the hands of the Bani Riyam, who are holding it against the Sultan. op Also called AMhamiyah : a small town in Turkish on the left bank of the Tigris opposite to Kadhimain and distant 2 miles north-westwards from the nearest part of Baghdad City. Mu'adhdham is connected with Kadhimain by a bridge of 21 boats, and with Baghdad by an unmetalled road—very little better than a ploughed field—on which ply public conveyances drawn by four mules and many hackney carriages. The population of Mu^adhdham is about 2,000, and almost all are Sunni Muhammadans. Some good houses on the bank of the river serve as villas to wealthy merchants of Baghdad ; but the principal object of interest is the tomb of the great Sunni theologian Abu Hanifah, which is distinguished by a fine dome of blue tile-work; entrance is denied to Christians. The Mutawalliship of this shrine is hereditary in a local family: the- present incumbent (Mustafa) has been absent at Constantinople for some years and is represented by his younger brothei* ( ; Abdul 'Aziz). The chief industry is the tanning of skins and hides with gall-nuts from Musal : there are about 40 tanneries, employing a large number of hands and turning out about 5,000 pieces a week. The brokers and merchants of Baghdad- visit the yards once a week to make their purchases ; and the leather, though technically known as rough-tanned^ is of good quality and commands a ready sale in Europe. The red and yellow shoes called Yamanis are made at MuSidhdham and sold wholesale at Baghdad ; and some of the market-gardens which supply the city are at Mu'adhdham. There is a small bazar. Mu'adhdham is the chef-lieu of a Nahiyah in the Baghdad Qadha and the seat of a Mudir : it is also the headquarters of the 4th battalion of the 81st regiment of the Radif, Mtr, DHAM cu H1244 MTJ'AWDAfi MU'AW- small tribe of Maliki Sunnis in Bahrain, pearl mercliaiits, owners DAH of date gardens, and navigators in every part of the Persian Gulf and even in seas ontside it. They claim descent from the 'Anizah of Najd and are supposed to have come to Bahrain with the 'Utub from Kuwait and Qatar. They have now only 20 houses at Muharraq Town. MUBAEr r ^ ie nex ^ ^ own i m P 01 ^ arLce the Hasa Oasis after Hofuf, from RAZ which it is distant 2 miles due northwards. M Surroundings, —On the west of Mubarraz is the desert; on the other 3 sides it is enclosed by cultivation. A raised causeway which connects it with Hofuf traverses a heavily irrigated country, full of ponds and springs of tepid water. Immediately outside the town on the north side is the Harah spring, while the springs of Marjan and Nadharah adjoin respectively its south-western and its south-eastern corner: these are all described in the article on the Hasa Oasis. At half a mile westwards from the town is the Bedouin camping ground called Hazam, A cemetery extends along the south side of the town. Defences, —Mubarraz is enclosed only by a ruinous wall without a ditch. The only military work is a fort called Qasr Sahud which is just outside the town wall on the west side, between it and Hazam. The garrison is a quarter of a battalion of regular infantry in Qasr Sahud and 25 mounted and 10 unmounted Dhabitiyahs in the town.

Sijasib (Fariq-as-) Is on the north-west side and is met by 'Itban on the east and by 'Ayuni on the south. 300 houses, the major ity of Suunis. Shaikh 'Abdnllah-bin-Sa'- dun, a resident of this quarter, is headman of the whole town and des- cended from its ancient rulers. He traces his origin to the Bani Khalid. There are only two gates in the town wall, one on the north and one on the south side; the former called Darwazat-al-^Itban is in the ; Itban quarter; while the latter, known as Darwazat-al-^Anainah * s in the eastern end of the wall belonging to ^Ayuni, The houses of Mubarraz are mostly of stone and lime, but some are of unburnt brick. Inhabitants, —From the table in the preceding paragraph it will be seen that the population of Mubarraz is about 8,500 souls; of these about four-fifths are Sunnis. The people are all settled Arabs and there are not many foreigners among them; a few immigrants from Najd are found, but none from Persia or even from Bahrain. Resources, trade and industries. —The best drinking water is obtained from the Marjan spring. The interests of the town are largely agricul tural, but it has a market which is resorted to by Bedouins on account of the springs and grazing which enable them to encamp near by ; the Bedouin trade however is smaller than at Hofuf. A Friday fair is held in1246 MUBARBAZ the Suq around the Qaisanyah; the number of booths at this weekly fair is said to reach 250. -Mubarraz is the head-quarters of a Nahiyah. MUDHAIBI A town of about 700 houses in the Baldan-al-Habus division of the Sharqiyah district of the Sultanate of 'Oman] it is probably about 4 miles west of Sanau, but its position with reference to Samad is uncertain. Mudhaibi is the largest place in Sharqiyah, except Ibra, and has a population of 3^51'O or more. The inhabitants are Habus, Hajriyin, A1 Wahibah and Hirth. Date palms number about 10^000, and there are 100 camels, 60 donkeys, 70 cattle and 600 sheep and goats. Mudhaibi is said to possess the finest spring in Sharqiyah. MUGAM or MUQAM A port on the coast of the Shlbkuh district of Persia, situated 22 miles east-south-east of Shivuh at the mouth of a considerable valley which is described in the article on the Shlbkuh District. Mugam consists of 250 houses inhabited by a population of mixed Arab and Persian origin who in religion are mostly Sunnis of the Shafft seliooL A few of the people are merchants ; but the majority are seamen, divers, cultivators and date-growers. Mugam is the port of the Tarakameh and Ishkani districts in the interior, with which it has relatively good communications; and there is considerable intercourse between it and Bahrain, Trucial ■'Oman and Masqat Town. The principal article oi export is tobacco, grown about Tarakameh and Ishkani, which is sent to Lingeh and Bahrain. Livestock at Mugam are 6 horses, 20 camels, 40 donkeys, 120 cattle and 100 sheep and goats. Date palms number about 1,000. Water is from 5 reservoirs and from 6 sweet wells of 2 to 3 fathoms depth. Vessels are 12 Sambuks, 30 Baqarahs, 6 Shu^ais and 2 Varjis, of which 8 go to the Arabian pearl banks and others are employed in pearling near home and in the neighbourhood of Shaikh Shu'aib island. Mugam is the seat of the Hamadi Shaikh to whom Nakhilu, Jazeh and Makahil and the upper villages of the Mugam valley also are subject ,* he is under the authority of the Governor of Bastak and pays 800 Tumans a year as revenue on account of his possessions.MTTGAM 1247 The Imperial Persian Customs have a post at Mug-am, which is a centre of smuggling.

MUGHU J*' In English formerly spelt ' Mogoo/ J The last, on the south-east, of the Shibkuh Ports of the Persian Coast; it lies about 17 miles south-east of Charak and 23 miles west by north of Lingfeh. Town. Inland of Mughu are d«te-pIantations ; on the coast to the east of it low sand-hills extend for about 2 milps; and the nearest slopes of Kuh Namaki are about 1 mile to westward. Water is from a dozen wells, sunk about 15 feet in a clay soil, and is sweet. There are several towers for defence, and in 1899 a, fort was built to ward off the attacks of the people of Charak. The houses, which are of stone and mud, number about 150; but at the present time a number of them are unoccupied. The inhabitants, amounting to about 500 souls, are mostly Maraziq or Marzuqi Arabs who claim to be a branch of the 'Ajman tribe ; . but some are Sudan or belong to other tribes, among them the A1 Bu Samait of whom there are 4 families. The Marzuqi majority, or about three-fourths, are Wahhabis ; the rest are all Sunnis of the Shafi/i school. The people have numerous date-groves and some cultivation of crops ; the grazing near the village is good. There are 5 business warehouses, but no shops. Wheat, barley and dates are exnorted. A few of the inhabitants are traders, the remainder are sailors, pearl divers and cultivators. To Mughu belong 8 Sambuks trading- to the coast of Arabia, 8 Sambuks which cross the Gulf to the Arabian pearl banks, and 4 ''Amilahs and 12 Shu'ais which are used both for fishing and for pearl-diving on the Persian side at Bustaneh and Farur island. Mughu, with the connected villages of Hasineh and Kundarun, Farur island and a part of the village of Bustaneh in the Lingeh District, is ruled by a Marzuqi tSb .ikh, at present Ahmad-bin- Rashid. His subjects live, in unity under his authority and are well provided with rifles ; many of them habitually carry arms. The revenue for which the Shaikh of Mughu is responsible is 1,000 Tumans annually and is payable to the Governor of Bastak ; but the amount which actually(£-TZ) MUHAISIN 1249 reaches tbafc official ordinarily falls below half the prescribed sum. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here. A powerful Arab tribe of which the ruling Shaikh of Muhaniinarell MUHAISIN is the head in Southern 'Arabistan. Distribution. —The headquarters of the tribe are in Persian territory, and a majority of the Muhaisin are probably ( Persian subjects; but they also occur in large, and perhaps not much inferior numbers in Turkish ; Iraq. In Persia the Muhaisin occupy all that part of the Muhammarell District which lies north and west of the Karun and they are found in some of the northern and eastern villages of ^Abbadan island to the south of it; they also extend up the banks of the Karun into the Ahwaz District, where their principal settlements are Maqtu/ Khifi, Milaihan, Moran, Farsiyat, Isma/ili, Chimaiyan, Qajariyeh, Drisiyeh, Nathareh and Salaihawiyeh, but of these only Milaihan, Isma^ili and QajarTyeh are occupied at other seasons than those of cereal cultivation. In Turkish ^Iraq the Muhaisin are settled upon the Shatt-al^Arab, chiefly below Basrah, their principal places on the left bank being Mohiyah, Kut Ghadhban, Kut-ash-Shaikh, Kut Suwadi, Dahaimat-al- Kahir, Dahaimat-as-Saghxr, Kut-as-Sinni, Daghaimat, Nahr Jasim, Da^aiji and Kharnubiyah, and, on the right bank, Mahaulat-az-Zahair, Hamdan, Hamdan-as-Saghir and Abul Hamad: above Basrah there are Muhaisin at Kataiban, and possibly at other places.

The Muhaisin in Turkish ''Iraq appear to belong almost entirely to the Bait Kana^an section. The Abu Hamreh ^ in Northern ^Arabistan^ who are said to have 200 fighting men and to frequent the country south of the Haddam towards its source^ are considered by some to be a section of the Muhaisin j but others class them as Hamaid. The Al Eu 'Atuwi section of the Bawiyeh were originally Muhaisin and in some respects still belong to the tribe. The fighting strength of the Muhaisin proper in Persian territory would appear from the table above to be about 6,000, and the present Shaikh of Muhammareh estimates ifc at double that number; but a computation by settlements gives the total number of Muhaisin in Persia as about 12,000 souls only. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the fighting men of the tribe are armed with rifles and that about one-sixth of the total muster are provided with horses. Mode of life and character. —The Muhaisin in Persia are a settled, but not altogether sedentary tribe, having their permanent headquarters in the M uli a 111 111 a r e h District: at their homes they are cultivators of dates, but they also grow wheat and barley upon both banks of the KariiHMlTHAISIlSr 1253 as far up as Moran and even in the vicinity of Wais. Their custom, is to leave the Muhammareh neighbourhood in November for their grain lands on the Karun; in February, after sowing these, they return to Muhammareh to fertilise their dates ; in May they revisit the Karuil to reap their crops of wheat and barley; in Jnne or July they reappear at Muhammareh in expectation of the date harvest, which begins at the middle of July. The Muhaisin own many sheep and goats, some cattle and a few buffaloes; when they return from the Ahwaz to the Muhammarell District they leave part of their flocks in charge of sections of the Bawiyeh tribe. In religion, except some of the Bait Ghanim, who are Sunnis, the Muhaisin are all Shfah Muhammadans. They are described as a cheerful and lazy race, thoroughly amenable to tribal custom and authority. Origin, history and political position. —The Muhaisin are said to be descended from a certain man whose name was Muhaisin and from his son-in-law Kasib (pronounced Chasib^. Tradition represents these individuals as belonging to a tribe of the Mllhammareh District whom the encroachments of their neighbours the Ka'ab compelled to emigrate and to settle on the Tigris under the name of A1 Husain Pasha Ub JI . Muhaisin and Kasib however, having purchased land near the site of the present town of Muhammarch from the Ka'ab; returned with some followers to their native country and founded the Muhaisin tribe, of which the headship has remained vested in the house of Kasib. The later authentic history of the Muhaisin is included in that of 'Arabistan. H( re it is enough to observe that on the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian war in 1857 Haji Jabir, then head of the tribe, was recognised by the Persian Government as Shaikh of Muhammarell in his own right and with plenary powers j the Shaikhship up to that time had been held by him merely as nominee of the Ka'ab Shaikh. Shortly afterwards, the Shaikh of the Ka'ab having been deported to Tehran, the Fallahiyeh District was placed in charge of his Muhaisin rival; and, except during one short interval from 1860 to 1862, the heads of the Ka'ab tribe have ever since been in subordination to the Shaikh of the Muhaisin, or as he is now generally called, the Shaikh of Mllliamniarell.* At the present time the Muhaisin, in consequence of the authority wielded hy their head over all the districts of Southern 'Arabistan, maybe regarded, though still outnumbered by the Ka'ab; as the paramount tribe m all that region. * The Shaikh, it is said, now sometimes describes himself as Shaikh of the Ka'ab.1254 MUHAMMAD (AL BtT) MUHAM- A large but socially inferior and possibly non-Arab tribe, located MAD partly in Turkish 'Iraq and partly in Persian 'Arabistan : they are (AL BU) practically indistinguishable from the Magadan most Ma'adan i jf a ^ m ^ting themselves to be Al Bu Muhammad, and vice versa. The remarks which follow apply indifferently to both tribes. Distribution. — From ; Amarah down to 'Azair the Al Bu Muhammad inhabit the swampy land on both banks of the Tigris, extending inland from the left bank as far as the Hawizeh District and from the right bank to the furthest limit of the marshes ; but branches of them are found as far from the tribal head-quarters as Ghabishiyah near Suq-ash-Shuyukh, the Suwaib creek on the left bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab, Gurmat 'Ali on the right bank some miles above Basrah Town and parts of the Kut-al-Amarah Qadha. One of their principal settlements is Majar-al-Kabir, and Qal'at Salih is their chief market town. Wandering, Ma'adan, perhaps of this tribe, appear with their buffaloes at certain seasons in the Muhammareh and Fallahiyeh Districts of Southern 'Arabistan. Divisions.— subdivisions of the Al Bu Muhammad are said to be ' innumerable as worms but none of them are well enough known to deserve mention, and no estimate of the total strength of the tribe is possible. Mode of life and social matters. —The Al Bu Muhammad all live in reed huts, and within the limits of the tribal territory numbers of them are perpetually on the move, engaged in fishing and shooting; never theless they may be regarded as a settled tribe. Their principal occupation is the breeding of buffaloes, of which they possess enormous herds, and of cattle; Syrian purchasers sometimes obtain as many as 2,000 to 3,000 head of stock from them at one time. They have no sheep or camels, and their horses [are few and inferior. Their principal crops are rice, maize and Mash, grown on lands reclaimed from the swamps. A curious feature of the tribe is a custom of congregating in spring with their immense herds of buffaloes on the grazing lands nearest to 'Amarah Town ; and not less remarkable are the vast number of bitumen-covered Mashahif which they keep for the navigation of the marshes and their skill in handling these light craft. The Al Bu Muhammad are Shi'ah Muhammadans, except a few who are Sunnis ; but they are despised by the neighbouring Arab tribes, who refuse them their daughters in marriage and allege as evidences■'% ^ I'al H | MUHAMMAREH DISTRICT of their inferiority their intermarriage with Persian tribes^ the presence of Persians settled in their midst ; and their own principal occupation as herdsmen of buffaloes. The women of this tribe are accounted handsome and do not veil their faces. It is said that the Shaikhs of the A1 Bu Muhammad and the Saiyids who live among them enjoy far more latitude than the Quran permits in regard to the number of their wives. Arms and political position. —The A1 Bu Muhammad^ down to the youngest members of the tribe^ are at the present time extremely well armed with smuggled rifles; and their armament, in conjunction with the inaccessible nature of their country, prevents their neighbours from committing aggressions on them, however .much they may affect to despise them. The westernmost and principal division of Southern 'Arabistan^ the MUHAM- headquarters of the Shaikh of Muhammareh's jurisdiction, the seat of MAREH the Muhaisin tribe of which he is the head, and the basis of his terri- ^ torial power. DISTRICT Boundaries and divisions.— Muhammareh district is bounded upon the west by the frontier of Turkish 'Iraq which is, for the greater part of the way, the Shatt-al-'Arab; on the south by the Persian Gulf; oa the east by the FallaMyeh District, from which Khor Silaik, Khuwairin and tbe Salmamyeh canal divide it; and on the north by the Ahwaz District on the Karun and by the Hawizell District further to westward. The Muhammareh district reaches about 20 miles further upstream upon the right bank of the Karun river than it does upon the left bank ; on the former side the uppermost point included in it is SaVeh^ on the latter ''Ali-ibn-al-Husain There is no definite line of demarcation between the districts of Muhammareh and Hawizell. The Muhammareh district falls naturally into four portions, namely, (1) the tract upon the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab above its junction with the Karun^ (2) both banks of the Karuil except that portion of the left bank which forms the north shore of 'Abbadan island, (3) the part of the district on the left bank of the Balinianshir 3 and (4) 'Abbadan island.1256 MUHAMMAUEH DISTRICT Fhysical character, —The whole of this country is flat^ alluvial and low-lying, and so much of it as is within reach of irrigation by canals and creeks from the Shatt-al -'Arab, Karun and Bahmanshir is fertile and productive; the remainder^ situated chiefly in the centre of ^Abbadan island or to the north of Muhammareh Town, is barren, but only for want of water. The banks of the rivers are generally lined with dense plantations of dates. Fovulation. —The principal tribes of the district are the Muhaisin and the Ka'ab^ and the great bulk of the Muhaisin who reside in Persian territory are located within its bounds. The following table explains how the population is distributed, and shows the total number of souls to be about 24,000 :— nivision of the district. Mukaisin. Ka'ab. Various, Total num ber of souls.

Irrigation from the Karun river appears to have been once more extensive than it is at the present day; and 2 miles below Sab^eh^ on the right bank of the river, there are said to be traces of a canal which formerly ran from that point via Saiyid ^Abud to Failiyeh on the Shatt-al -^Arab. In the villages nearly every family own one or two cows, and a small proportion own mares. The Shaikh of Mnhammareh keeps at least 60 brood mares and a few stallions in his own possession, but he has other stock also which he distributes among the tribesmen to be looked after for him. Buffaloes are brought into the district by nomadic Magadan. Fowls, ducks and geese are owned by the inhabitants. Trade and communications. —The trade and comnmnications of the district are noticed in the general article on ^Arabistan. Administration, —The Muhammareh district appears to be sometimes called the district of Shatt-al ^Arafy doubtless on account of the importance attached by the Persian Government to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Muhammareh over the eastern or Persian bank of that river; but locally this name is not used, perhaps because it might lead to confusion with the Shatt-al-'Arab Nahiyah in the Turkish Wilayat of Basrah. For administrative purposes the Muhammareh district is at present divided into two principal blocks, the Karun river being the border between the two ; and ^Abbadan island is further sub-divided into 4 executive charges, 3 of which have their headquarters at Ruwais, Manyuhi and Qasbeh respectively. In the Muhammareh district the Shaikh takes as revenue half the produce of all date trees, and only those which are Waqf property or which belong to certain of the Shaikh's own relations are exempt. MUHAM- MAREH or MUHAM- RAH TOWN The first form of the name is used in Persian, the second in Arabic. Muhammareh is the capital and the only important town of Sonthern 'Arabistan j it may also be described as the sole seaport and entrepot of foreign trade in all 'Arabistan, Site. —Muhammareh stands upon the right bank of the Karun, the river being here from 200 to 300 yards wide j the houses begin mile?JV1UHAMMAEEH TOWN 1263 above the junction o£ the Karun and the Shatt-al -'Arab, and the river frontage of the town extends for about one mile upwards from this point. The soil is alluvial, and the river bank, which would otherwise be subject to erosion, is protected within the limits of the town by revetments of date logs laid horizontally to form quays and wharfs. Muhammareh is shut in upon its upper side by the date plantations of Nahr Siyab, on its lower by those of Hizan ; but these groves are only a quarter of a mile deep; and immediately behind the town begins an open treeless desert which stretches away to the interior. Buildings. —The town, which is constantly increasing in size, now consists of about 800 houses, some of which are of brick and some of mud, while some are merely huts. Upon the river there are now some fine modern buildings; among them the most conspicuous is the palatial mansion of Haji Muhammad ^Ali, Rais-ut-Tujjar, who is the chief secretary of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. There are six mosques, three public baths and a good brick bazaar: the last has a domed roof through out and was built by the present Shaikh, who is less afraid than were his immediate predecessors of exciting the cupidity of the Persian Govern ment. The state of the town, in spite of these and other improvements, continues to be highly insanitary : the only kind of drain seen is a channel cut down the middle of each street, which is generally choked up except after rain. Accommodation for travellers is afforded by 7 Husainiyahs w : these are buildings primarily set apart for the readings and lamentations which are obligatory on Shi^ahs at the Muharram and also as refuges for destitute strangers and for pilgrims, but they also serve as inns and in one of them superior rooms can be had on payment. There are also some Khans in Muhammareh ; but these, instead ot' being hostelries as in Turkish ''Iraq^ are merely places of business or warehouses where merchants store their goods. In the town, towards its eastern end, are the residence of the Persian Karguzar, the telegraph office and a battery, overlooking the river, of 5 brass field pieces of various sorts. The village of Kut^ash-Shaikh, on 'Abbadan island opposite to the town, is practically a suburb. Outlying appurtenances of Muhammareh are the Customs House — originally built as a Governor's palace—at the mouth of the Karun upon its right bank, and the quarantine station and doctor's quarters, which are upon the left bank a little further from the river mouth and were constructed in the first instance for artillery and infantry barracks respectively. Defences, —The only sort of defence which the town possesses-—except1264 MUHAMMAREH TOWN tlie miserable battery already mentioned—is a ruinous mud wall upon the landward side: it was built by the Persians in 1858 and suffered severely in the floods of 1896. This wall runs at an unnecessary distance from the town, and its perimeter is so great in proportion to any force which the Persian Government could place at Muhammareh as to render it valueless even should it be repaired. The only representatives of the Persian army at Muhammareh are two artillery officers,, with a dozen privates under them, who are in charge of the guns and of an arsenal that exists, at least in name. Population. —The inhabitants of Muhammareh are chiefly local Arabs belonging* to the Hilalat, Bait Kana ; an and Mutur divisions of the Mnhaisin tribe ; but there are also numerous Arabs who are descendants of refugees from Bahrain^ besides some natives of Dizful and Shushtar Towns, a few merchants from other parts of Persia, about 40 families of Sabians, and a handful of Jews and Oriental Christians. The Bahrainis are mostly small shopkeepers and mechanics; the Sabians are silver smiths ; the Jews deal in Manchester goods; and the Christians are clerks or lightermen. The total population is probably about 5,000 souls. The people drink the water of the Karun river, which is good. Trade and shipping.-^ Muhammareh can now boast of five large bazaars, containing over 300 shops, and of a grain market. Large stocks of rice and dates are generally available. There are two or three gun smiths who repair rifles and revolvers. More important, however, than the local trade or industries of Muhammareh are its foreign commerce and its functions as a port. The town is accessible to ocean-going steamers ; but, owing to the narrowness of the Karun and to the consequent difficulty in swinging, they generally discharge.their cargoes without-leaving the Shatt-al-'Arab opposite to the village of Ma/m.uri. Of the foreign trade carried on at Muhammareh, the greater part depends on places upon the Karun river and further up- country. Por particulars the paragraph on trade in the article on 'Arabistan may be consulted. The large boats owned at Muhammareh are chiefly employed in trading up the Karun river ; they are 19 Mahailahs and about a dozen Ballams of a kind for cargo called Nassari. Besides these about 80 ; Ashari or passenger Ballams are owned at Muhammareh or in its imme diate neighbourhood. Administrative and political matters. —The administrative arrange-MUHARRAQ ISLAND J265 ments and political interests of Muhammareh town are a part of those of 'Arabistan generally, to the article on which reference may be made. Muhammareh is in communication by telegraph with Nasiri, and by telephone with the Shaikh's headquarters at Failiyeh and with the Customs House; one or two of the public offices in the town belonging to the Shaikh or to the Persian Government are also connected by telephone. There are also a Persian post office and a Persian treasury which are both in charge of the Imperial Persian Customs. The town is nominally governed by a deputy of the Shaikh called the Naib-al- Hukumeh, but the Rals-at-Tujjar in reality wields greater powers : all .commercial cases are settled hy him. Among-private citizens three Bahraini and two Shushtari 'Alims, or doctors of religion not enjoying* the title of Mujtahid, are prominent. The British Consulate stands on the right bank of the Karun between the town and the Customs House, and the Christian cemetery is at some distance inland from the Consulate at the point where the date- groyes of Hizan give place to open country. There are only two or three registered British subjects resident at Muhammareh ; in the date season^ however, Indian boats containing British subjects visit Muhammareh; and numerous Indian pilgrims, Bohrahs and others^ pass through the place on their way to and from the Shi'ah shrines. Two European British firms are represented by agencies at Muhammarek, and there are S local Muhammadan firms enjoying British protection. A British post office exists in connection with the Consulate. { After Bahrain Island this is the most important island of the Bahrain group. It lies north-east of Bahrain Island and is separated from it only by a strait, miles broad, of which the greater part is extremely shallow. Its maximum diameter, from north-north-west to^ south-south-east, is about 4 miles; but the area of the island proper is relatively very small,—in fact only 5 i square miles,—on account of. its irregular and much indented form, somewhat resembling a horse shoe with the open side to the south. Muharraq consists of a low strip of sand, but it is surrounded by broad, flat reefs of coral which almost triple its superficies at low tide; and a rocky spit, called Ras-al- Khasaifah which runs out nearly four miles to seaward from the north-western corner of the island, constitutes the chief danger to * For authorities, maps, charts, etc., see footnote to the title of Principalitj. the article Bahrain 4 N MUHAR RAQ Uf ISLAND*1266 MUHAKRAQ ISLAND vessels entering Manamah harbour.

The principal town of Muharraq Island and the second in the prin cipality of Bahrain I as it is the headquarters of the Shaikh duiing eight months in the year it may even claim to be the political and. administra tive capital of the Shaikhdonu Situation and general character, —Muharraq is surrounded by the sea at high water on the eastern ; southern and western sides, and its situation is low ; nevertheless, as seen from Manamah harbour, it stands up hand somely in the afternoon or evening light. Its distance fiom Manam3.h« which it exceeds in area though it is not equal to it in population, is about 2 miles, measured across the shallow strait which divides the Muharraq and Bahrain Islands. Muharraq fort, more correctly described as the fort of Abu Mahur, stands on an island and is 800 yards south of the town, but it is no longer of military importance ; near it is the celebrated submarine spring of Abu Mahur which supplies the town of Muharraq with most of its drinking water. The sea, closely approaching the town on three sides at high water, is the scavenger of Muharraq and removes at inter vals of a few hours the town refuse which is deposited at its edge. MUHAR RAQ m TOWNMtJND 1271 Occupations&gt; trade, shipping and resources, —Muharraq Town contains a bazaar, the only one on the island, of about 300 shops. The people of Muharraq Town are general merchants, shopkeepers, pearl merchants j5 pearl divers, sailors, fishermen, boatmen, bakers, barbers, butchers, tailors, shoemakers, masons, carpenters, tin-workers, water-sellers and washermen. Trade is considerably less than at Manamah ; but the pearl diving pro portion of the community is many times greater. More than 700 vessels, some of considerable size, belong to Muharraq Town : they are 40 Batil6 &gt; 141 Btims, 68 Baqarahs, 189 Shu^ais and Sambuks and S96 Mashuwahs arid jolly boats; of these 282 are used as pearl boats. There are no date palms. Animals belonging to the town are 80 horses, 220 donkeys and 150 cattle. The second place in importance in the Hilldiyan District, situated on the right bank of the Hindiyan River about 17 miles north of Hindiyan Village. The inhabitants, who number about 700 souls, are half of them Ka'ab Arabs and half Qanawatis from Behbehan. Dih Mulla is the centre of a wool-raising tract which is said to yield 100,000 shearings per annum, worth a Qran each; a royalty is collected by an agent whom the Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains here. There are some old guns at Dih Mulla and some ruins on the opposite bank | a mile further up the Hindiyan River; the latter are perhaps vestiges of a Portuguese occupation. The upper course of this river in Fars lies beyond the scope of our inquiries, moreover it is imperfectly known ; but the stream, or one of its main tributaries, is believed to rise close to Shiraz and to pass Firu^abad on its way southwards. The Mund finally emerges from the hills in the Persian Coast district of Dashti, about 7 miles north of the town of Kaki, turning as it does to the north-western corner of Kuh-i- Namak. Erom this place it runs due west for 7 miles to the village of * A tuonogtaph on this river by Dr. Andreas is contained in the Persian Gulf AdmiruBtration Report for 1877-1878, pages 13-16. The Mund is the Nahr Sakkan of the mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers and pivbably identical with the Sitakus of Nearchus* See Le Strange's Lands of the iLastevn Caliphate,[212 MtJND Chagliapur where it receives on its right baiik the whole drainage of the Khurmuj valley. From Chaghapur it runs south for 17 miles skirting the inland flank of the Knh-i-Mundj then swings round the southern extremity of this range and runs west for another 15 miles to its estuary, the Khor Ziyarat, which is 65 miles sonth-south-east of the town of Bushehr. At the point where the track between Khurmuj ancf Kaki crosses it ; the stream is 120 yards wide and in winter is not as a rule traversable except on a raft; at times, however, even in that reason, it is not more than feet deep. Forty years ago (1865) it could be ascended by native craft of 40 or 50 tons burden almost as far as Kaki ; and after rain it discharges a large volume of water into the sea. Craft of some size still navigate it to a point about 3 miles above Kaki. The water is slightly brackish even in the cold weather, and in summer it is unfit for human use unless in an emergency. Khor Ziyarat, which forms the river's mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be entered by boats a nigh water, but the entrance is exposed. For a short distance to the north of this estuary and for some 20 miles to southward the coast of the mainland is swampy. MtJNTAFIK An Arab tribe, the largest and most powerful in Turkish 'Iraq. Territory. —To the Muntafik belong both banks of the Euphrates together with the adjacent western desert from Durraji, between the towns of Samawah and Nasiriyah, to the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris ; also the banks of the Shatt-al -Gharaf except in its upper course^ the right bank of the Tigris from 'Azair to Qurnah 'Village and the whole western portion of the country, called Jazirah or Mesopotamia, included between these three. Part of the right bank of the Shatt-al- 'Atab below Basrah was formerly occupied by the Muntafik, but they were at some period displaced by the Muhalsin ; some of them however are still found at Ma^amir above Fao and at Kut-al-Khalifah in the Dawasir District. The Muntafik are adjoined by the Dhafir on the west, and by the Khaza/il on the north-west; while the Bam Rabl'ah, A1 Bu Daraj and Al Bu Muhammad intervene between thein and the Tigris bank from Kut-al-Amarah to 'Azair. It follows that the bulk of the tribe are under the government of Basrah and com paratively few under that of Baghdad. The chief towns in the Muntafik country are Su-qash-Shuyukh, Shatrat-al-Muntafik and Nasiriyah, and the tribe also frequent the town of Samawah.MUNTAFIK 1273 Divisions. —No estimate of the number of the Muntafik is possible and tlieir subdivisions are innumerable; but they are sometimes classified under the three heads of Ajwad ^1, Bani Sa^id or Sa'ad and Bani Malik ; of these the first are predominant in the Euphrates valley above Hammar, the second (sometimes treated as a distinct tribe) are chiefly found upon the Tigris and Shatt-al -'Arab and have their centre about Qurnah, while the third are now generally regarded as a separate tribe and have been so dealt with in this Gazetteer. The term Muntafik is properly applicable to the central core only of the great tribal congeries of which the territorial limits have been described aboA?e ; but in use it has become extended to the whole. Some of the components of the tribe in the wider sense occasionally separate themselves from the general body and this is considered to be the position at present of the Bani Malik, and in a lesser degree of the Ajwad. Various client tribes also, though not included under the name^ are closely associated with the Muntafik ; such were formerly the Bani Mansur and Ahl Jazair^ Part of the once famous Bani Khalid tribe is believed to have been absorbed in the Muntafik. Mode of life. —A large part of the Muntafik tribe is still Bedouin; but the remainder inhabit tents, reed-huts, villages and even towns^ cultivate the land, grow dates, and breed sheep, cattle, buffaloes and camels ; many, however, even of those who belong to the settled pastoral sections rove the desert in spring with their flocks and herds for the sake of the grazing. The Muntafik women do not veil their faces* Religion and political position. —The tribesmen generally are Shr'ahs^ but the ruling Shaikhs and their subdivision, called the Sa^idun are Sunnis. The Sa^idun are said to have come from Makkah not quite 500 years ago, and their authority over the tribe was unlimited till about 20 years since, when the Turks removed the Shaikh of the day from the official headship. Some of the desert sections still ignore the Turkish Government and obey no orders but those of the Sa^idun. The Muntafik are at enmity with the Bani Rabl'ah. and with the Northern Shammar. In war they carry swords and lances, and they are well armed with rifles, chiefly Martinis ; a large proportion of their mounted men are camel-riders. Unite recently about 1,500 of the tribe under Sa'adun Pasha were in rebellion against the Turks.1274 MURAIKHAT - Sillgular Muraiklli • A tribe closely related to the oU j 11 ^ Sh;imis section of the Na'im or, possibly, one of its subsections They are found in Bahrain at Umm -al-Baidh on Sitrah Island, where thev have about 15 huts and are pearl fishers. The Muraikhat are said to have come from Qatar : they claim to have been originally Mutair but the Mutair repudiate them. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. MURBAT 0116 o£ tlie P rinci P al P laces in the district of Dhufar, and a complement- ary port to Risut from which it lies 48 miles almost due easfc, the plain of Dhufar Proper occupying the interval between. At Eas Murbat the coast changes its direction from east and west to south-south-east and north-north-west; and ofl; the village, which stands on the shore about a mile within the cape, there is consequently a perfectly sheltered anchorage in the north-east monsoon*; the depth of water is 6 to 7 fathoms at less than half a mile off shore. Near the sea, less than a mile north of the village, is a red granite hill called Jabal-al-'-Ali ^JUJ) and a plain of dark granitic rocks extends eastward from Murbat to Ras Nus and inland for about 10 miles to the foot of the huge scarp here formed by the Samhan hills ; one of the highest points in the Samhan range is situated about six miles north of Murbat. The village of Murbat consists of about 150 huts and houses; of the houses, 38 m number, some are of stone. The only buildings in good repair are the house of the Shaikh and the residence of the ^Aqid com manding the garrison; the latter is on the beach about i of a mile north-west of the village. The population of the place is mixed and includes 40 houses of Sadat, 20 of Ja^afar, 10 of Qaras of the Ahl ; Umr section (Bait Makhaiyir subsection), and a few of Mahras, Hikman and Mashaikh. The poorest classes live by fishing and none are well-to-do. Malarial fever is said to prevail throughout the year and the people are rather thin and amende. Little is to be had in the way of supplies except cattle and goats ; the water-supply is from wells in the bed of Wadi Murbat, which comes down to the sea about one mile north-west of the village, and is of fair quality. Livestock are a few camels, donkeys and cattle and about 400 sheep and goats ; in winter the cattle present a thin and miserable appearance, due to the scarcity of pasture at that season. Millet and sugarcane are grown, also cocoanuts. Frankincense from the Samhan hills is exported to Bombay, whence rice * A plan of the Murbat anchorage will be found in Chart No. 10MCTSA (Btl) 1275 and cloth are obtained in return. With the exception of 10 to 30 boat crews of Jannabah, who come every year to fish, few Arabs from abroad visit Murbat. Murbat is subject to the Wali of Dhufar and is held by a garrison of some %0 'Askaris in the name of the Sultan of 'Oman j but few of these levies are men from 'Oman. The virtual ruler of Murbat is the Shaikh of the place, whose authority is supposed to extend from Eas Nus to Taqa ; but he has little real power beyond the limits of his village. The plain of Dhufar Proper can be reached from Murbat by a track which runs along* the coast westwards for about 20 miles. Murbat was once occupied by Muhammad-bin' ; Aqil, a pirate who made himself master of Dhufar at the beginning of the 19th century ; the traces of his fort built in 1806 still remain, and his tomb also is here. In English formerly called ' Bomosa. ^ An island in the Persian Gulf, a few miles nearer to the town of Sharjali in Trucial 'Oman than to that of Lingeh in Persia and situated slightly to the west of a line joining those places. In shape it is nearly rectangular and lies with its corners approximately to the cardinal points; its extent is about 3 miles diagonally between opposite corners. The island is low and consists of great sweeps of sandy plain covered with tussocks of dry grass but without trees ; it carries however some isolated hills of dark, volcanic appearance, and a sugar-loaf peak, somewhat to the north of the centre, attains a height of 360 feet. Bu Musa is surrounded by fairly deep water and is a common place of refuge for native boats in bad weather. There is good drinking-water in about 20 wells, also a plantation of about 150 date trees which is said to belong to the Shaikh of Sharjah. The perma nent population consists of above 20 households of Sudan from the village of KMn in SMrjah, all of whom are fishermen and live in huts and mud Houses. They are reported to own 4 camels, 60 donkeys, 40 cattle, 200 sheep and goats, 7 pearling boats and 5 fishing boats; and their provisions are obtained from Lingeh. There is also a shifting population of persons from the Sharjah coast who come to fish, or bring animals for grazing on the island j but of late years their numbers have been fewer than formerly in consequence of failure of pasturage due to want of rain. Some 10 or 15 donkeys are kept on the island by the employes of a Persian contractor of Lingeh who has obtained from Salim-bin-Sultan the uncle of the Shaikh of Sharjah^ a concession to work deposits of * A distant view of this iaiand will be found in Chart No. 2373—2837A.1276 MtJSA (Bt?) red oxide of iron that exist on tlie island. The concessionaire pays $250 a year to the Shaikh's uncle by way of royalty; his Persian work people (men, women and children) sometimes number 100 souls; and the amount of oxide removed annually is said to average 40,000 bags. The island of Bu Musa belongs to the Shaikh of Sharjah who frequently visits it in the hot weather. There are several herds of wild gazelle on the island. MUSA'* ^ remarkable inlet of the sea which leaves the Persian Gulf at its (KHOR) northern extremity, to the east of the Shatt-al-'Arafy and affords access ory*to Enziyeh and Ma'shur, the ports respectively of the Fallahiyeh and JarraM Districts of Southern 'Arabistan. Course and main features, —The channel of Khor Musa begins in the open sea at a distance from terra firma, and the position of the entrance may be taken as approximately 29° 5 5' north and 49° 3' east, or about 30 miles east of the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab. For the first 31 miles within the entrance Khor Musa is nearly straight and runs approxi mately north-north-west wards ; in the course of the next 5 miles the channel gradually bends round to eastwards; and for the remaining 7 miles, to a point where it divides into branches running to Euziyeh and Ma'shur, its direction is slightly to the north of east. The total length of the main Khor is thus over 40 miles. * The priccipal recent authorities on Khor Musa are a report by Commanders T. W. Kemp and H. B. T. Somerville, B.N., dated 20th July 1903 and accompanied by a sketch (in the Government of India's Proceedings in the Foreign Department for June 1904); a note by Sir L.

Shearme, R.I.M., numbered 1398 in the Foreign Department Library, Simla. Khor Musa may perhaps be identified with the creek of Doraqistan, where (in the 13th century A D.) 44 ships coming from India cast anchor.' Vide Le Strange.ls iaii iii few Wsi; MtJSA (KHOR) 1277 Near the entrance the banks of the channel are not visible on either (gjde^ being covered even at low water; but on the east side^ from 5 miles within the entrance up to 23 miles^ there are patches of sand and mud which dry at low water; and on the opposite side, from 14 miles and upwards, banks of mud with rocky patches are exposed at half tide. At 11 miles within the entrance a. low swampy island to the right, called Dairah tji* , is passed at about 6 miles distance; 3 miles to the ui north-east of this island is Bunneh another island, 3| miles long, narrow, and distinguished by a ruin. A channel passing between Dairah and Bunneh is said to be called Khor Wastah . Beyond Dairah, Khor Musa is temporarily divided into two channels by Qassar-bin^ Siswan, a rocky shoal a mile in length; and at 23 miles from the entrance Qabr-an-Nakhuda , another low islet, lies upon the starboard beam at 3 or 4 miles distance. Immediately after passing Qabr-an- Nakhuda, a ridge of dry sand a mile or more in length appears above the mud on the western bank of the Khor ; and at 29 miles from the entrance there is a small sandy islet on the eastern bank, opposite which Khor Musa throws off to westwards a branch named Khor Qanaqeh. The banks of Khor Musa above Khor Qanaqeh are still low; on the western or northern side they are of mud with small patches of rock and are covered at high tide; on the other side they are of mud and are submerged at high water springs. Khor Qanaqeh Khor Qanaqeh runs inland, westwards and slightly northwards, for a distance of about 25 miles to the ruins of Qubban where it forks ; this is the distance as measured in a direct line, but by the windings of the creek it is somewhat over 50 miles. From Qubban one branch, named Khor Abu Khadhair , runs north and is lost in the marshes adjoining the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal; the other, known as Khuwairin j goes south-eastwards and meets, or almost meets, a creek called Silaik or Silaich which is said to leave the coast at a point between the mouth of the Bahmanshir and the entrance of Khor Musa. The level of Khor Qanaqeh as far as Qubbau and of its branches beyond Qubban is affected by the sea tides. It is interest in o* to observe that the head of Khor Qanaqeh at Qnbban is connected by a hollow, now dry, with the Karun river at Marid ; and it is easy to imagine that, as the inhabitants of the tract assert, the Karun or a part of it at one time flowed to Qubban and thence to the sea either by the Khuwairin and the Silaik creek or by Khor Qanaqeh and Khor Musa. The water in e upper part of Khor Qanaqeh is1278 MtfSA (KHOR) nearly fresh; at flood it is drinkable in the upper third, and at ebb in the upper half of the creek. The banks of Khor Qanaqeh at 7 miles from its mouth and upwards are 4 to 6 feet high, firm, and covered with coarse grass ; but nearer to the main Khor they are liable to be overflowed at spring tides. The west bank of the Khuwairm near Qubban is of hard mud. In the season of most water, e. g., in May, the whole country to the north of Qubban is a swamp. Khor Ddraq Iranch. —The branch which runs from the head of Khor Musa to one mile beyond Buziyeh is called Khor Doraq ^ or Khor Buziyeh; its direction is north-westerly and its length, owing to windings, is about 35 miles. As this Khor is ascended its water becomes less and less salt; and on its banks, at the same time, saline swamps gradually give way to pasture and cultivated land. At the point where it approaches Imamzadeh Abdul Hasan most nearly, Khor Doraq is several, perhaps 10, miles distant from that place and has a breadth of 60 or 70 yards. At about miles below Buziyeh, where the water of the Khor begins to be drinkable when the tide is out, villages commence on both banks; those on the western side belong to the A1 Bu Abbadi and Al Bu Dahaleh sections of the Ka'ab, and those on the eastern side to these two sections and to the Al Bu Hamadi section. Khor Doraq in the immediate neighbourhood of Buziyeh is described in the article under that name. Khor Ma 1 shur branch- —The other branch, and true continuation beyond its head of Khor Musa, is Khor Ma^shur which runs north-eastwards, has a length of about 14 miles, and may be considered to end at a point about a mile south of Ma^shur village; but with high tides and a south-east wind the sea water is said to reach almost to the town on two sides—the south and the west. On both sides of this Khor are broad mud flats which are mostly covered at high water springs. Navigation of Khor Musa. —The entrance of Khor Musa is crossed by a bar which carries only 3 fathoms at low water springs^ but is practicable for large vessels at high water, the spring rise being about 10 feet. The bottom, however, is of mud and could easily be dredged if necessary; and, though no more favourable sounding than 3 fathoms has as yet been obtained on the bar, it is possible that a complete survey might reveal a deeper channel than any at present known. Inside the bar the depth steadily increases, and shortly after passing Dairah island there is no bottom at 9 fathoms, a condition which is maintained the whole way from this place to the head of the main Khor. The soundingsMtTSA (KHOR) in Khor Musa do not appear to be liable to miich variation^ for recent surveys agree closely with others made a number of years ago. In Khor Musa^ Dairah island and the mainland upon the opposite side are very low and only just visible in clear weather; but as the inlet is ascended the mud banks and flats which uncover at low water afford guidance to the navigator. The Qassar-bin-Siswan shoal lies in the middle of the fairway and probably never uncovers ; as a rule, however, it can be seen ; but it may be missed^ especially if the western edge of the channel is followed. Above the entrance to Khor Qanaqeh the Khor Musa channel is difficult to find ; except at low tide, on account of the distance to which the sea spreads over the mud flats on either side. iiiiilfil® Navigation of the branches. —In the Khor Qanaqeh branch at 7 miles from its entrance the width of the channel is about 400 yards, and the depth within 20 yards of the banks is 4 fathoms increasing rapidly to 6 or more in the middle. In Khor Qanaqeh a minimum depth of 6 fathoms can apparently be obtained for 30 miles above the entrance ; and a ship's boat can proceed about ^0 miles farther still to a point about 14 miles east-south-east of Qubban where the creek is only 10 yards wide and has a depth of a foot at low water. In the upper part of the Khor the tide flows for 3 hours and ebbs for 9 ; its rise and fall is about 10 feet, and the ebb is very strong. At 7 and 12 miles from the entrance unexplored branches run southwards, and one at least of them must apparently communicate with Khor Musa or with the sea as a native vessel has been known to emerge from Khor Qanaqeh which had not entered it by the ordinary channel. The navigability of Khor Doraq has recently been tested ; in the uppermost few miles it is narrow and at low water nearly dry, but the rise of the tide is about 10 feet and sea-going native vessels of as much as 150 tons are able to reach the town of Buziyeh. For 21 miles above the mouth of Khor Doraq the soundings in Khor Ma'shur continue to be more than nine fathoms, but thereafter they shoal, not altogether regularly, to the head of this branch. In ordinary tides small boats reach a point 1| miles from Ma^shur village, and native sea going craft ordinarily discharge their cargo at a place called Sif , 2^ miles from the town, where at ordinary low tides the depth of water is 3 feet and the width of the channel 15 feet. The banks here are of shelving mud and the breadth of the water increases at high tide to 50 feet. Larger vessels discharge opposite a tract called Zangi further down.1280 MtJSA (KHOR) General navigaUUty. —The whole of Khor Musa Proper is navigable for large vessels, and the Khor Qanaqeh branch is also navigable for a distance of 7 miles at least. The only difficulty is that already remarked on, which arises from the invisibility of the edges of the channel except at low water; and it should be added that Khor Qanaqeh becomes, afte^ a few miles, too narrow for a long ship to be turned in. At the places most suitable for anchorage in Khors Musa and Qanaqeh the tidal stream runs not less than ^ knots an hour at springs. Land approaches. —So' far as examination has yet been carried, the navigable portions of Khor Musa and its branches appear to be difficult of access from terra firma, being as a rule separated from the same by wide stretches of soft mud or treacherous saline soil which are sometimes miles in extent. The ground in the neighbourhood of Ma'shur village has been carefully explored ; and the result has been to show that the channel, where it is deep enough for European vessels, is unapproachable on that side by animals or even by foot-passengers. The tract called Zangi which adjoins'the northern bank of Khor Ma'shur above the mouth of Khor Doraq appears to consist to a large extent of labyrinthine creeks containing liquid mud : some of these are ramifications of an inlet, called Ju-i-Zangi, from Khor Ma'shur. Even the route from Ma'shur village to Sif, the place already mentioned where native sailing vessels discharge their cargoes, is sometimes impassable by caravans. For one mile it lies across a bare plain of saline soil which is swampy in winter and almost untraversable after rain. It then crosses a drainage hollow leading from the desert west of Ma'shur village to Khor Ma'shur; this hollow is liable to floods after rain, and even in ordinary weather the tide runs up it to within a mile of Ma shur village. The remaining miles of the way are sandy going and somewhat firmer than the first mile ; but this section also is said to become deep and difficult in wet weather. At Sif itself is a patch of really firm sand. The only other point at which it is certain that access to Khor Musa exists by land is on the north-eastern bank of its Khor Doraq branch, at the point nearest to Imamzadeh ^Abdul Hasan which is on the direct route between Ma'shur and Buziyeh. The distance of the bank from the Imamzadeh is several, perhaps 10, miles; and the ground, especially in the neighbourhood of the Khor, is fairly high and firm ; but for part of the way it is somewhat cut up by the canals of the Shatut tract. The depth of the Khor at this place has not been reported, but it has .beenMUSAITIB 1281 ascertained that the water in the Khor does not ordinarily rise to within less than 3 feet of the top of the bank. Both above and below this particular spot however^ the north-eastern bank of Khor Doraq is stated to be low and marshy. It is possible that the Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa may be easily approachable by land from certain directions, but this point has not as yet been specifically investigated. Naval advantages and disadvantages of Khor Musa. —The principal anchorages of Khor Musa are completely protected from all winds and could be easily defended against attack from the open sea whether by bombard ment or by torpedoes. Fresh water could perhaps be brought from the Jarrahi River, which is not far distant; and the climate is probably less trying than in some other parts of the Persian Gulf. The nearness of the place to the mouth of the Shatt-al -'Arab and to the valley of the Karun is also an important consideration. On the other hand, it is not certain that the navigable portions of Khor Musa could be made approachable, at least without inordinate expense, from the landward side; the chief natural anchorages might require adaptation in order to form good harbours; and the bar at the seaward entrance must be dredged to enable the Khor to be entered by ships in all states of the tide. A country town of pleasant aspect in Turkish ''Iraq ; it is situated MUSAIYJ upon both banks of the Euphrates river where crossed by the Baghdad' w, Karbala road. Musaiyib is well sheltered by palm-groves, which surround it and extend along th« banks of the river, and most of the houses are masonry- built. The main body of the town lies upon the left bank, but some of the best buildings, including the government offices and several good fUians^ are in the small quarter on the other side. On the left bank, immediately above the town, a strong embankment carefully revetted extends for about 600 yards, and along the top of it runs the high road to Baghdad. The stream of the Euphrates is spanned at the town, where it is about 200 yards broad^ by a bridge of 24 boats: some of the boats are connected only by insecure gangways without hand-rails. The whole population of Musaiyib maybe about 3;500. The great 4 o1282 MUSA1TIB majority of the people are Shfah Arabs^ but there are about 80 Jews who are Turkisb subjects^ 100 Persians who are Persian subjects, 20 Panjabi Indians v^ho are British subjects, and a few Afghans. There are no resident Christians, The Jews are silversmiths and traders. Musaiyib contains 12 Khans, 25 granaries and over 100 shops. There are no local manufactures ; and trade, though the town possesses about 40,000 date-trees and is the centre of a good agricultural district, is inconsiderable ; most of the going and coming is of goods and travellers passing between Baghdad and Karbala. Transport is not readily obtain able in any quantity, and the surplus of forage and provisions is not great. In the busy season 12 boats of the Safinah type are retained to bring up rice from the Hindiyall barrage, 5 miles distant, and to take down cotton piece-goods and other Baghdad merchandise to boats which wait below the barrage to receive them; in the off-season 7 of these are released for up-stream traffic on the Euphrates. There are 20 Sajahs or small boats at Musaiyib. Musaiyib is the headquarters of a Nahiyah —which also contains Sikandariyah— in the Qadha of Karbala ; but only the smallest local affairs are settled by the Mudir. The town is a municipality, and Paswaniyah and Chiraghiyah, or taxes on account of night watch men and the lighting of the streets, are collected. Besides the civil Mudir there are here a harbour master, a Mudir of the Public Debt and a Mamur of the Sanitary Department; and the Persian Government main tain a Naib Karpardaz or Consular Agent. From Musaiyib a double line of telegraph runs to Baghdad on the one side and to Hillah on the other, The Dairat as-Saniyah has taken firm hold of the country around Musaiyib on the left bank and has planted down a number of masonry enclosures in the neighbourhood ; these are used as storehouses but in appearance resemble military forts. The same department maintains a school on one of its estates near Musaiyib, MUSAL- Singular Musallami A small clan of Qatar and LAM (AL) Bahrain who claim descent from the Bani Khalid and are probably a jj branch of the A1 Humaid section of that tribe. The Al Musallam were once numerous and influential in Qatar, where about 1850 a number of them were settled by the Shaikh of Bahrain at D5hah as a counteipoise to the Sudan ; they were brought apparently from Fuwailat and Huwailah. The present fort of D5hah, formerly(6^2 V / MUSALLAMlYAH 1283 known as QaFat A1 Musallam, was built by them; they founded the quarter of Duwaihah; and they maintained close relations with the Ma adhid. They have now been reduced by natural causes to about 25 houses in Bahrain (at Muharraq Town, Hadd and Halat Abu Mahur) and _8 houses in Qatar (at Dohah, Fuwairat and Wakrah). In religion the Al Musallam are Maliki Sunnis • by occupation they are all pearl merchants except a few who serve the Shaikh of Bahrain as soldiers. Mueallamiyah bay is a considerable indentation in the coast of the MTJSALLA- Hasa Sanjaq; it is situated about 77 miles north-west of Ras MIYAH Tanurah and divides the tract of Zor-al -Andhan on the north from .LL- that of Hwzurn on the south : at its foot it meets, or nearly meets, the inland district of Sabakhat-al -Mutaya. The northern point of the bay is Ras-al-Bidya' , a low sandy promontory with tufts of grass ; the southern, which is of some height and runs into the sea between Musallamlyah bay and the island of Jinnah, is named Ras-al- Abkharah M-^l ^1; . The width of the entrance between these points is 4 miles, and the depth of the bay inland from the entrance is 6. The inner area is for the most part shallow ; but a deep channel, known as Khor Musallamiyah, leads past Ras-a]-Bidya J up to Musallamfyah island. This island, which like Jinnah has Jazirat-al-^Amair ijiy?- for an alternative name, is situated in the bay about 5 miles west of Ras-al-Bidya'. On the east side of it is a village of 400 houses, protected by two adjacent forts, which possesses several wells and a few ber trees but no cultivation. The inhabitants are Bani Khalid^ of the 'Amair section and belong chiefly, if not altogether, to the Al Khalid and Al Kazin subsections ; they subsist by fishing and pearl diving and own, with the people of Jinnah island, about a dozen pearl boats. A detachment of S Turkish Dhabitiyahs is quartered on the island, which is under the Qiiim-Maqam of the Qatif Oasis: they are accommodated in a mud touse, and their sole duty is to fly and look after the Turkish flag The Shaikh of the Al Khahd is styled Mudir of the island, and he receives from the Turks an allowance which he shares, by private an-angement, with the Shaikh of the Al Razin ;the less important headmen also, as mentioned m the article on the Bani Khalid tribe, are stipendiaries of the Porte. The Zakat or revenue payable by the whole community on Mnsalla- miyah island is 60 Riyals per annum. 4 o 81284 MUSANDAM MUSANDAM mutair tA k~ or xjmtair In English formerly called ' MusseldomAn island adjoining the north-eastern tip of the RuUS -al-Jibal promontory, from which it is separated only by a narrow strait: it may be considered to mark the entrance of the Persian Gulf and to divide that sea from the Gulf of 'Oman. Musandam measures 2 miles in length from north to south and very little less in breadth across its southern »nd- its extreme height is 876 feet, and it is precipitous almost all round the only landing places being 3 or 4 small coves on the east side. Some'ruins exist at the north end, built of large blocks of stone without mortar • but a few herdsmen in charge of goats are generally the only denizens of the island. At its north end Musandam terminates m a clifi 100 feet high, the celebrated cape Ras Musandam. Not far from Musandam island, on the north and east sides, soundings are obtained of 100 fathoms, a depth considerably exceeding anything found within ^ the Persian Gulf. The strait which separates the island from the maims called Fakk-al-Asad ^ or Bab J it i* 600 yards wide, 24 fathoms deep, clear of obstacles and can easily be passed by steamers if a good speed is maintained, but in consequence of strong tides and baffling winds it is avoided by Arab vessels except rowing-boats; the cliffs on Tithcr side are perpendicular, resembling door-posts. A Pillar of rock called Kachalu ^, 100 feet high, stands i a mile north-north-east Ras Musandam with a clear passage between it and the cape. A great and typical Bedouin Arab tribe of Central Arabia.

The Mutair are in contact on the north with the ^Anizah, on the north-west with the Shammar, on the west with the Harb, 'Ataibah, Qahtan, Dawasir and Sabai', on the south-west with the 'Ajman, and on the south with the A1 Morrah, Bani Hajir and Manasir. At the wells of Dukhnah their Bedouins have been supplanted in recent times by the 'Ataibah. Settled Mutair are found chiefly in Qasim, where some of the inhabitants of Bukairiyah, Butainiyat, Ghaf I, Hatan, Khabb, Khabb- al-Qabar, Khudhairah, Muraid Saiyid, Eafi'ah, Kaudhat-al-Mahanna, Ta'amiyah, Qasr Zaid and Ummahat-az-Ziyabah are supposed to be of Mutair blood; and non-nomadic Mutair occur also at Dhrumah in 'Aridh, at 'Ashairahin Sadair and at Jaraifah in Washam in Southern Najd, and in the villages of Wadi-al -Miyah in the Hasa Sanjaq. Divisions and numerical strength.—The original divisions of the Mutair are two only, the ; Ilwah ^ and the Braih ; but to these have been added in recent times, probably by fission of the Braih, a third main division, the Bani ; Abdillah AJJloar ^ , During the late struggle for supremacy in Central Arabia the Bani 'Abdillah sided wich Ibn Rashid while the majority of the tribe were partisans of Ibn Sa'ud, and the estrangement continued until the final defeat of Ibn Rashid when the Bani 'Abdillah rejoined the general body of the Mutair. The 'Ilwah consist of two large subdivisions, the Jiblan and the Umwahah composed of the sections given below: — Vmwahah. subdivision. Jihlan suhd ivision.

Sections of the Mutair known as Dhawfun , Shahaba and Shakir are said to be known in Hasa^ but it is uncertain to which division of the tribe they belong. From estimates given it may be inferred that the total strength of the Mutair amounts to not less than 4,000 fighting men,* that is males who are neither infants nor decrepit with age; and the total number of souls may thus be 10,000 or more. Character and customs. —The Mutair are typical Bedouins, which is to say that they are poor, hardy, restless, impatient of control, much engaged in tribal warfare and ready to fight,—in the desultory nomad fashion,—where there is either hope of plunder or an injury to be revenged. In religion they are not fanatical, but, as compared with other Bedouins, they are perhaps somewhat deficient in hospitality. The principal customs of the Mutair mostly refer to marriage, to compensation and retaliation, and to crime and punishment. A sum, called Muhar ^ , is paid to the father or guardian of a bride; among Shaikhs and headmen it is $200, but among ordinary tribesmen it averages $40 to 50 ; Muhar is generally given at tbe time of the marriage, but occasionally the payment of half the amount is post poned. The customary bride-price among the Mutair is said to be the same as it has always been. If the Mutair happen to be near a town the Aqd &amp;*£ or ceremony of marriage is performed by a Qadhi, but in tbe desert his presence is dispensed with. The Fuqamah subsection (see above) will marry the daughters of other sub-sections of the Sahabah, but they will not give their own daughters in marriage except to men of * Tribal estimates of fighting strength are in Arabia as a rule too greatly exag-^ gerated to be of any value. In the present case the estimate may perhaps be accepted subject to some deduction, the tribe being well known at Kuwait and their fighting strength Laving been a question directly in issue during the past several years.1^88 MUTAlR Shaikhly class such as the Dhil Ghanaiman. The Dhil Ghanaiman on the other hand will give their daughters to certain selected classes only in their own section (the Malaibah), but they do not refuse them to any sub-section o£ the Sahabah. Ml Compensation for a man slain is 'called Idij'ah and among the Mutair it consists of $800 in cash ; a slave, a riding camel and a rifle. The blood-price of a woman is half that of a man, and if a slave or animal be killed the actual value must be made good. Injury causing the loss of both eyes must be compounded for at the same rate as homicide, while the loss of one eye or of the nose, the fracture of a bone and the severance or permanent disablement of a limb are each treated as entitling the sufferer to half the Idiyah. In cases of flesh- wounds, loss of fingers and deafness suitable compensation is assessed by the Shaikhs. Teeth knocked out must be paid for at the rate of one she-camel per tooth. A peculiar provision of the tribal code is one which authorises a man whose beard has been pulled in anger or by way oi' insult to cut off thehand or nose of the offender without recourse to the tribal authorities and without incurring any liability to pay compen sation. A murderer can go in safety for the settlement of his case only in company of a member of the opposite party who consents to act as his escort. Disputed points are Fettled to a great extent by oath. The formula in swearing to a homicide is e/ 6 (t 1 bear witness, being adjured,that thou art the slayer ; the established phrase of denial is D aJJIj ' By God neither do I know nor have I become aware. ' A solemn form of oath is one by which a man declares his wife to be divorced in the sight of Heaven in case what he is asserting be not true— ^ 3^1 fir ' Thieves are punished with the loss of the nose and one hand, but the delinquent may ransom his hand by payment of half Idiyah ; only the paramount Shaikh of the Mutair and the chief Shaikhs of the Jiblan and Braih have power to order this penalty. In case of seduction of an unmarried girl she is put to death, and the paramour also is killed if caught in the act. In case of adultery the husband kills the adulterer it he can, and the woman is handed over to her blood-relations to be put to death or otherwise punished ; the disgrace is considered to fall on her own family rather than on her husband^. Adultery cannot bs compounded. The adulterer is not regularly outlawed, but his goods are kept under attachment as long as he lives.

The subject of the war-cry, called ' Izwah or Nakhwah ^ is replete with complications. The war-cry of the ' Ilwah as a body is lU meaning apparently 'O noble ones, will ye not return to the fight ? ^ ; it is said to have originated from the words used by a leader to raliy the ' Ilwah in a fight in which they at first gave way, and the name ' Ilwah is supposed to be derived from it. If however the Jiblan should be engaged alone they cry J(Ll and the shout of the Umwahah in similar circumstances is ^iyJ) , both phrases referring to ancestral origin. The Aulad Wasil battle-cry is their name, and it is perhaps used by others of the Braih, for it is stated that if the Mutair generally were engaged the words 'Ilwah and Wasil would be those chiefly heard.

Mode of life and property .~~~ Vx\Vq other Bedouins the Mutair follow a wandering life, being assembled together in large bodies at good watering stations for 3 months in summer and dispersed during the rest of the year over their whole territory in search of pasture. They are said to prefer the northern part of their Dirah. Nowhere do they cultivate, and camels, mostly of a dark colour, are their chief wealth, but they also possess sheep and goats in large numbers and in about equal proportions. Both sheep and goats are of one kind only , the sheep belonging to the species called Nijad because proper to Najd. The best male riding-camels, called Dhaluls do not sell for more than $100 each among the Mutair, and a female (or Naqah Dhalul being weaker only fetches $60. The price of the best male baggage camels, called Ba'irs, is $60, and their Naqahs average about$10 less; but a Halfah or she-camel in milk may become more valuable than a male. The goats ( Ma^az ) and sheep (Dhan ) are sold at $4 to $6 a head, and the price of females is higher than of males. The Wasams ^ or property marks of the Mutair are endless and, as a rule, are branded only on camels. The Wasam of the Dushan is a eh placed low down on the off-quarter, and that of the Basaiyis a crescent impressed in two places, mz., below the right eye and low down on the off-quarter. The brand is applied to a camel when it is 2 years old, and operation is accompanied with the remark , &lt;f This is your mark and may good luck be your portion.^ Tribal constitution. —The paramount Shaikh of the Mutair is at I Pi - HI 1 i1290 MUTAIR present Sultan-bin-Hamaidi-ad-Dawisli ^ olkU ) a man 60 years of age ; whose authority over all lesser Shaikhs is admitted by such of the Mutair as are not at the moment in rebellion against him. The Bani ; Abdillah, as already mentioned, refused for a considerable time to submit to his paramount authority, and the Sahabah section are reported to have maintained a quarrel with him for the last 15 years in connection with the division of some booty obtained in a raid on the 'Ataibah. His authority, therefore, is far from being absolute, and it is said to be weaker now than it was formerly. The surname, ad-Dawish, shows that this Shaikh belongs to the Dushan wUy , a family of the Umwahah and not, as some authorities have supposed, a large division of the tribe. There are 5 other Shaikhs who are recognised as ' Shaikhs of the Dushan/' but the recognition appears in the case of each to be honorific and not founded upon the headship of any considerable group. Sultan appears to be chief Shaikh not only of the whole Mutair tribe but also of the 'Ilwah division; there are however sub divisional Shaikhs of the Jiblan and Umwahah; and there is a divisional Shaikhship of the Braih, vested in a family called Bin Basaiyis ^ of the Sa'aran section and held at the present time by Naif-bin-Hazal ^ aged 45. The nomenclature of the Mutair in regard to tribal groups seems to differ from that of most of their Bedouin congeners in Central Arabia, by whom small groups are ordinarily styled Findahs (plural ^ ), The Mutair divide the whole tribe or 'Ashirah ^ into Qabilahs ^ (plural ) and the Qabilahs into Badidahs (plural or Hamulahs - Thus, strictly speaking, Qabilah means a main division and Badidah a sub division or smaller group; but the current use of both terms is loose and inconsistent, and Qabilah is frequently employed to describe a subdivision. Political position—The Mutair have ordinarily been tributaries of Ibn Sa'ud, and their annual contribution to the Riyadh treasury was valued 40 years ago at $16,000; nevertheless by religion they are Maliki Sunnisj and in this respect they differ from most of the Bedouins of Central Arabia, who are tinctured with Wahhabiism and describe t e selves as Hanabilah. About 1878 the relations of the Mutair wit n Rashid were friendly, and deputations of the tribe used to visi ai with gifts ; but they were not then subject to him and nevei became so In Qasirn their disposition at the same period was hostile 'owar Qahtan tribe and the town of Buraidah, and amicable towards the own/ \ ■ MUTATA (SABAKHAT-AL-) 1291 of 'Anaizah. In the long struggle between the Wahhabi and Shammar Amirs a large majority of the tribe, as already noted above, adopted the side of the southern state and shared in its final victory. The alliance which subsisted between Ibn Sa'ud and the Shaikh of Kuwait during the war brought the Mutair into closer relations than before with that north eastern seaport. By arrangement with Ibn Sa'ud the Shaikh of Kuwait now collects on his own behalf from all of the tribe in his territories, aud possibly from some of those beyond it, a tribute or Zakat at the rate of |1 annually on every 100 sheep andthe same on every 5 camels. The Kuwait tax-gatherer or Muzakki at present a native of Buraidah visits the watering-places of the tribe with 30 or 40 followers, numbers the' animals and collects the amount due from all owners exc ept headmen ; he then pays a share of the proceeds to the principal Shaikhs of the tribe Ind conveys the remainder to his master at Kuwait. There is also a matri monial alliance between the Mutair and Kuwait. The Shaikh of Kuwait has espoused a daughter of Pahad-al-Askah ^ , one of the Dawish Shaikhs, and has appointed his fort at Jahrah as her residence. The Mutair, as befits allies of Kuwait, are well armed with breech- baders and it is estimated that every fifth fighting man uow possesses a Martini rifle or Sama ah , as that pattern is called. The best rifles cost |100. Among the Mutair are smiths who are accustomed to repair modern weapons. Matchlocks are now entirely out of date.

The village of Lajal (100 houses) belongs to them, and they are found also at Manah (30 houses) in 'Oman Proper, at Siya (70 houses) and elsewhere in Wadi Sarain, in Wadi Mi'aidin, and at Mazara' in WadiTayin among the Bani Battash. In the hills on the right bank of Wadi Tayin in its Wadi Dhaiqah section they are shepherds and form a warlike subdivision of the Bani Battash. They are possibly of non-Arab descent, but are now considered to be Arabs. They number perhaps 1,500 souls. na^aie* (SIR BU) An island in the Persian Gulf, 50 miles north by west of Abu Dhabi Town and 65 miles west of Dibai, on the north edge of the pearl banks. It is 2 ^ miles long from north to south by 2 miles broad, is covered with hills of volcanic rock which attain a maximum height of 240 feet, and has a low sandy point at its south-eastern corner. The only supplies it affords are brushwood and some brackish water in wells upon the east side. Sulphur is said to be found, and there is salt in the hills which until some two years ago used to be removed by Persians, chiefly from Lingeh and Kling, on payment of dues to the Shaikh of SMrjah. In winter fishermen from Sharjalb Khan and Dlbai resort to the island, and in the pearl season the fleets visit it to open their oysters ; at other seasons it is uninhabited. There are several pearl banks in the vicinity, in particular Hair Bin 'Adhbi, 6 miles to the north; Rrjlah, 8 miles to the south-west; and Lijjah, 6 miles to the north-west. Sir Bu Na ah belongs to the principality of Sharjah.. N A' A L AH A long, narrow, stony and rather elevated district in the Hasa. It has the same direction as Ghuwar and Wadi Faruq, which enclose it on the east and west respectively; and its extent northwar s and southwards is the same as that of Wadi Faruq, viz., between the Jau-as -Sa'adan tract on the north and the hill of Jau-ad-Dukhan on t south. With these for its boundaries the length of Na'alah from noi north-west to south-south-east is about 100 miles, while its average breadth is only about 8 miles. * A view of this island is given in Chart N o. 2373 2837A.NABAND 1298 A low desert island of the Bahrain group, lying about 2 miles off NA'ASAN the west coast of Bahrain Island and measuring less than 4 miles in tU MM) length from north to south by about 24 miles in breadth. It has two rather remarkable peaks of inconsiderable height and furnishes the best cement used for building in Bahrain. r i here is a fresh-water spring near the west coast of the island. The Dawasir of Budaiya' and Zallaq on Bahrain Island send their cattle to Umm Na^asan in the hot weather to benefit by a little grazing which exists at that season. Singular Nabhani A tribe of merely historical import ance, who furnished the rulers of 'Oman at the end of the 1 6th and beginning of the 17th century. They are now few in numbers, and are found at Sharqatain in Wadi Samail, at Hammam-al-A'li and Sunub in Wadi Boshar and at Nakhl, having been expelled from their original seats which were in Western Hajar about Yanqul and Maqniyat. The surviving remnant are Ibadhis in religion and belong to the Ghafiri political faction : they number about 600 souls. NABAHI- NAH d-UUj or NABHAN (BANI) One of the Shibkuh ports of the Persian Coast; it is situated on NABAND the south shore of Nahaud bay nearly 3 miles within the entrance and is distant about 4 miles smith-west of 'Asa hi and 39 miles weFt-novlh- west of Shivuh. Naband bay is more than 3 miles wide and rans inland eastwards for about 5 miles, becoming shallow towards the foot. The south side of the bay is low and rocky, is fringed with date-plantations, and has hills behind it rising to a height of some hundreds of feet. The east end is low and sandy, with patches of swamp, and forms the mouth of the great valley of Gabandi. On the north side are an anchorage and fishing- ground, off Eaidheh Khan village, which are protected by a sandy point with a reef extending off it. Among the pearl banks of value on the coast of the Persian mainland are those which adjoin]*Has Naband, the southern entrance point cf the bay, and extend thence south-westward as far as Barku ; diving is carried on here, but is not extremelv remunerative.1294 NABAND Naband village has a reef in front of it, inside which native boats anchor close to the beach. The place consists of about 200 stone houses and huts of the Al Haram Arab tribe j but the population, in conse quence of the place being partly deserted, probably does not exceed 600 souls at the present time. The inhabitants are nearly all Sunnis; they are fishermen and pearl-divers, owning about ^8 small Baqarahs and 20 Varjis. Naband, under that name, seems to have existed already as a port in the 10th centurv of the Christian era * NAFUD The word Nafud is used in the northern and eastern parts of Central Ojk) Arabia both as a generic term and as a proper name. In the wider and primary meaning the word denotes any expanse of sandy desert soil,— such for example as the wastes of sand which pervade southern Qasim and approach the towns of 'Anaizah and Buraidah. In the restricted sense in which it is employed in the present article, the name Nafud refers to the huge wilderness of sand which forms a counterpart in northern Central Arabia to the Euba'-al-Khali of the south. Extent. —The boundaries of the Nafud or Great Northern Desert have not yet been ascertained with any completeness, and its extent is consequently uncertain. On the west it commences between Taimah and Jauf-al-'Amir, probably not far to the west of a line joining those two places. The northern boundary of the Nafud runs thence in a curve almost to the edge of the Jauf-al-'Amir depression and from there to a point 50 miles north of Sham ah, while the southern boundary, after passing a little to the north-east of Taimah, continues by the northern extremity of Jabal Aja to a place about 10 miles south of Shamah. It follows that the breadth of the Nafud, which to the south of Jauf- al-'Amir is 200 miles, has near Shamah diminished to about 60; but the precise limits of this portion are difficult to fix as it is broken up and inter spersed with stony ground. Eastwards beyond Shamah the diminished Nafud appears to change its direction and run south-eastwards to a locality on Wadi-ar-Bummah immediately to the north-east of Qasim, where it terminates or at least ceases to be known by the name of the Nafud. If the Wadi-ar-Rummall b e taken as the south-eastern limit of the Nafud * Vide L© Strauge's Lands of the Eastern ^Caliphate.NAFtm 1295 the whole length o£ tlie desert from west-north-west to east-south-east is oyer 400 miles. The districts which border the Nafud on its northern side are, from west to east, Jauf-al-'Amir and its connected villages, the Hamad or Syrian desert, especially the tract known as Wadyan, and the region of Hajarah. On the south are the districts of Jabal Shammar and Qasim. Physical characteristics. —The surface of the Nafud is generally de void of prominent features. Its level above the sea varies, however, within considerable limits; and on the line between Jauf-al-^Amir and Hail differences of several hundred feet in elevation apparently occur; the central portion of the tract upon this section stands somewhat higher than either of the margins. It is generally agreed that the north-western part of the Nafud towards Jauf-al-'Amir is that which has the most broken and irregular surface; and here the ridges and valleys of which it consists, if they have any general direction at all, run from west to east, dealer to Sail the Nafud consists of open concave plains^ interrupted here and there by banks of sandstone; there are also sandhills of less height but greater circuit than those in the north. Further to the east the Nafud falls away into low sand ridges branching out from the higher western grounds : enclosed between these ridges are long but shallow valleys which descend eastwards. The average altitude of the Nafud between Jauf and Hail seems to be rather more than 8,000 feet; in a line between Hail and Najaf it is, apparently, some 700 feet less. The Nafud throughout is composed of a bright red sand, somewhat coarse but absolutely pure; this sand is almost crimson when damp and does not seem to vary in colour or consistency from one place lo another. In occasional deep depressions a firm bottom of clay, or a calcareous, flinty or quartzy stratum is exposed at the lowest point. The Arabs state that the sand of the Nafud is in most parts too deep and too loose to admit of the sinking of wells. The most remarkable phenomenon of the Nafud is a species of large depression called a Falj (^li or In shape it is semi-oval and resembles the print of a gigantic horse-hoof; the toe is the deepest part and points invariably to the north-west, while the floor of the hollow rises south-eastwards and reaches the ground level at the heel ,* the internal walls are inclined at an angle of 50 or 60 degrees to the horizon. The Falj is of all sizes, varying in area from 1 to 200 acres, but the average diameter is £00 to 400 yards and the ordinary depth from 150 to 250 feet. The formation of these hollows is generally ascribed to the agency1296 NAFtID of the prevalent western winds, bat this theory cannot yet be regarded as fully established. P^culkr facts relating- to these depressions are that, in spite of the instability of their sandy sides, they apparently remain constant in shape and size from year to year and even from generation to generation ; that none of them retnin water after rain; and that they lie in irregular courses or strings from west to east. To the north of Jubbali for the greater part of the way to Jailf-al- ; Amir there is a constant suc cession of Faljs on both sides of the road. In Nafud nomenclature sandhills^ particulaviy if (as is not uncommon) thej are of crescent shape with the concave side to the south, are styled Tu'us* (singular Ta^as ); and passages or spaces between them are called Khalul m (singular Khali ). Climate, vegetation and animals. — prevailing breezes in tlie Nafud are from the west: the Bedouins state that high winds are of rare occurrence. In winter a white frost is visible on the ground in the early ^ morning, and a considerable depth of snow has been known to fall in a ,| r single night. After rain, which is not frequent but is sometimes heavy, pools are formed and continue for a time in parts of the Nafud. — There is abundant desert vegetation, and but for the absence of water- _ ing places the Nafud would be permanently inhabited. The grazing is ^ excellent, and when the winter rains have made a sojourn possible the | surrounding Bedouins repair to the Nafud with all their flocks and herds. North of 'Alam-an-Nafud the principal plant is the Ghadha, which ^ yields good firewood and charcoal; south of that point it is the Artah, which when leafless resembles a thickly matted vine. The commonest plant however is ''Adar with stiff green leaves and brownish-yellow ^ flowers : there are also Nasi, a good kind of camel grass, and Hamrah, a blue prickly plant which is excellent forage for horses.t Animals include the wolf, the Beatrix antelope (called Baqiat-al- j Wahshi or Wadhihi), the hare, lizard and snake; among the snakes are believed to he the cobra and the horned viper. Birds are the buzzard, kestrel, grey shrike, linnet, wren, desert lark and wheatear with | an occasional crow ; and a few ostriches are still, it is said, found in the eastern and northern parts of the Nafud. There are also flies, dragon j flies and small butterflies.

In winter and spring the north of the Nafud is frequented by Shararat and by 'Anizall of the JWalah branch, the south by 'Anizah of the Bishr branch and by Southern Shammar, and the east by Northern Shammar, Dhafir and Muntank; in summer all the Arab Bedouins withdraw, the three last mentioned to Turkish Iraq, and Saluba and Hawazim remain in exclusive possession. Communications. —Political interest in the Nafud attaches mainly to the routes by which it is crossed, the most important being- that between Hail and Jauf-al- 'Amir known as Khali Bani Hilal ^ jl or Khali Abu Zaid jjJ Jl . They are described in the article on Najd. Below are described, in tabular form and alphabetical order, the principal inhabited places, recognised subdivisions and other points of interest in the Nafud :— Name. Positipn.

In that case Haiyaniyah must apparently be placed further west (which is difficult, see Wallin and Huber)or the existence of two soraewhat similar Haryaniyahs must be supposed. The most difficult known part of the Na- fud; it consists of valleys and scarped hills which make it difficult for the traveller to preserve his direction and render progress tiring. There are numerous deep Faljs and a quantity of bushes. The route between Jauf-al* 5 Amir and Hail traverses this tract. A group of 5 wells containing sweet water at 25 fathoms. Shammar Be douins and Saluba encamp here at times and a small permanent post is maintained by the Amir of Jabal Shammar for the protection of the wells. A couple of high sand dunes. A village situated in the midst of the Nafud, towards the north end of a plain several miles in extent of which the soil is hard and stooy. One mile to the west-north-west of the village is the hill of Umm Sinman. ubbah once consist* ed of 4 quarters and was a thriving place of nearly 1,000 inhabitants of the Armal section of the .Shanmiar; during the last seven years, however, it has rapidly declined and is now estimated to contain only 25 houses inhabited by about 100 Arabs of various tribes. The place was once walled, but is no \v open and undefended. The grazing in the neighbourhood is among the best in the Nafud and attracts nomad 'Anizati, Shammar and Hataim in the season to the number of 300 or 400 families. A few dates and some cereals are grown and here the Ithl tree is first seen in entering Central Arabia from the north. The wells are about 40 feet deep and yield water which though insipid is better than that of Jauf-al-'Amir. Forty years ago a toll, under the guise of payment tor water-rights in the Nafud, was collected at Jubbah on behalf of the Amir of Jahal Shammar : it was at the rate of ^ from travellers about to cross the Natu and $1 from those who had passed it.NAFCTD 1299 Name.

Political position of the Na'im in 'Oman. —The Baraimi Oasis, where they are still politically though no longer nnmerically predominant^ is legarded by the Na'im of ^ Oman as their tribal headquarters; but ^ Ajman and Hamriyallj both of which places are ruled over by Na aimi Shaikhs, their position appears to be more secure than it is in Baraimi at the present day. They are also the most powerful Ghafiri tribe in the Dhahirah District of the 'Oman Sultanate; but their relations with the ruler of the Sultanate are slight. Except at Ajman and Hamriyah the INVim appear to be weakened by internal dissensions, but their Bedouins are described as warlike and predatory. In Oman the Na'im are generally Sunnis of the Hanbali school; one or two exceptions to this rule are noted in the table in the preceding para graph. Settled Na J im of Bahrain.—'We now turn to the second territorial division of the tribe—a branch severed from the parent trunk some generations ago—who are found in Bahrain and Qatar. In the region in question non-Bedouin members of the tribe are now found only in the Bahrain islands where they have 60 houses at Umm-ash-Shajar, 50 at Halat-nn-Na'Im, 30 at Shajairah, 10 at Halat-as-Sulutah and a few at RifaZ -al-Gharbi; they thus number about 800 souls altogether. There are now no settled Na'im in Qatar.-fas) NA'lM Bedouin Na'lm of Bahrain and Qatar, —The nomadic Na^im out side 'Oman are believed to number about 2,000 souls. In winter they live in Qatar, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Zubarah ; in the hot weather most of them remove to Bahrain and form camps in the north ern part of the main island, but some take up their summer quarters near Dohah in the Qatar peninsula. These Bedouins are reputed to possess altogether about 100 horses, 600 camels, 1,000 sheep and 1,000 Subdivisions of the Na'lm of Bahrain and Qatar. —The main tribal divisions of the Na'im are the same here as in the south, namely, the A1 Bu Kharaiban and the A1 Bu Shamis; but the prominent sections appear to be entirely different. They are— Al J ifaf alah Khaliiwi Matawa'ah Fahad (Al) Haiyi (Al) Hutura Jabar (Al) ^ JI J' Miza'idah and- Qahatiu Al Bu Shdmis. JT Jima'an (Al) Ramadlian (Al) and Sawawarab J1 These sections, and even the two main divisions, are here much inter mingled ; but all the tribesmen in Bahrain and Qatar are followers of one of two Shaikhs who belong to the Al Haiyi and Al Ramadhan sec tions respectively. The Muraikhat of Bahrain are sometimes regarded as a section of the Al Bu Shamis division of the Na'im, with whom they are at least intimately connected ; but it appears preferable to treat them as a separate tribe. The Na'im of Bahrain speak of the Shaikh of Ajman as a JafEali, and it is therefore possible that the Jifafalah section among the Na'im of the north corresponds to the Qaratisah section among those of the south. Political position of the Na'lm in Bahrain and The Nairn of Bahrain and Qatar are now completely detached from the main body of the tribe in 'Oman and maintain no relations with the latter. They1306 NA'lM believe that their ancestors immigrated from 'Oman several generations ago at the invitation of the 'Utub, then in Qatar, for the purpose of expelling the A1 Musallam, Some of these northern Na'im have become pearl divers, but the majority are still pastoral and depend for subsistence upon their livestock. The Bedouins of the northern Na'im are retained as mercenaries both by the Shaikh of Bahrain and by the Al Thani Shaikhs of Dohah, and the protection of those Shaikhdoms is considered to devolve principally upon them during the absence from home of the pearl fleets. Their efiicieney and trustworthiness are not however beyond doubt, and their presence in Bahrain in summer is a source of annoyance to the peaceable agriculturists of other tribes. In Bahrain and Qatar the Na^im are Maliki Sunnis. KAJAF QADHA A division of the Karbala Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in Turkish Iraq. Position and boundaries Qadha of Najaf is situated on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah in its lower reaches^ chiefly on the western side ; it is bounded by the Qadhas of Karbala and Hindiyah on the north, by that of Shamiyah on the east, and by the Shamiyali desert on the south and west. Topography and inhabitants. —The only town which the Qadha contains is that of Najaf^ elsewhere described \ the only fixed village of any size is Rahabah ; the seat of a Mudir, which is situated nearly 20 miles south of Najaf Town on the western verge of cultivation and at the beginning of the Shamiyah desert. Eahabah is a small place inhabited by sedentary Arabs whose houses are miserable cabins of mud. The chief physical features of the district are the Bahr-an-Najaf, which is noticed in the articles on the Shatt-al -Hindiyah and Najaf Town, and part of the Shatt-al -Hindiyah which flows into it. Tables follow below of the agricultural tracts and of the tribes of the Najaf Qadha ; by Nahiyahs. Ndhiyah of Hor-ad-Duhhn. The names of the tracts in this Nahiyah, which is situated betweenNAJAF QADHA 1307 'Abbas 'Adhaib (A1 Bu) 'Aradhi (A1 Bu) Kifl and tlie Shamiyah Qadlia, have not been ascertained. The principal tribe are Bani Hasan of the following sections :— Hadari (Al Bu) Hawatim Majatim There are also some of the Mawash tribe who are intimately connected with the Bani Hasan. The Hor-ad-Dukhn tract is intersected by a canal which leaves the Hindiyah (left bank), under the name of Abu Shurah a little below Klfl and goes first to the eastward ; it then assumes the name of Abu Kufuf and circling round to southward eventually rejoins the waters of the Hindiyah in the neighbourhood of Shinafiyah ; it is known in the last part of its course as the Khurm. The chief village in the Nahiyah and the seat of the Mudir is Abu Shurah, several miles to the north-east of Kufall; it consists of about 7 0 huts. Nahiyah of Kufah.

In the Qadha generally there are a number of nomadic Arabs, chiefly of the 'Anizah (including Dahamishah), Ghazalat, Bani Hasan of the 'Ayash and Bani Salamah sections, Zubaid of the 'Ajalb subsection (Jabur-al-Wawi section). Northern Shammar and Al Shibil. Population. The total fixed population of the Qadha, inclusive of the town of Najaf, is probably not less than 50,000 souls. In the Hor- ad-Dukhn Nahiyah there are said to be 2,000 huts of tribesmen. Except about 750 Sunni employes of the Turkish Government, who are collected in the town of Najaf, the people are all Shi'ah Muhammadans. Resources. Agrieulture is the principal pursuit; the crops and live stock are of the usual sorts ; but, as parts of the district are marshy, rice cultivation and buffaloes are also found. A number of saline hollows have been drained by the Saniyah administration and converted into rice lands. The date palms in the Qadha are estimated at 250,000 trees, of which 170,000 are in the Nahiyah of Kufah. Near Rahabah are large salt fields, formed by the evaporation in the hot weather of previous floods; the more important are three in number and are known as Wadi-al-Hamarah Sirajiyah 'II,- and Eahmlyah ^*,1 of these the first two are close together and the third about 3 miles from the others. These three fields together yield about 1,000 tons a year of salt, but the produce is of poor quality and has not been utilised by the Public Debt Department during the last 10 years in their dep6t at Najaf Town. MrninistTation.—m^iu a Qadha of the 1st class; it contains— besides the Markaz Nahiyah—the Nabiyahs, already mentioned, of Hor- ad-Dukhn jy., Kufah and Eahabah . Each Nahiyah, except the one at headqnarters, is governed by a resident Mudir: that of Kufah belongs to the 1st and that of Hor-ad-Dukhn to the 3nd class.NAJAP TOWN 1309 Ulij 1 Sometimes characterised as Najaf-al-Ashraf and also well- known as Mashhad 'Ali • a famous town of Turkish ''Iraq, the most sacred of the places regarded as holy by Muhammadans of the Shi ah sect. The origin of Najaf^ unreliable traditions apart^ is obscure^ and there is no mention of its existence earlier than the 10th century of the Christian era. From ancient times it has been maintained by some Muhammadan authorities that 'Ali was really buried at Kufah, and not here. In 1051 A.D. a Shi'ah shrine which existed here was burned by 'Sunnis from Baghdad. The battle of Qadisiyah by which the Muslims in 635 A.D, gained the province of 'Iraq from the Persians, is believed to have been fought at a place about 10 miles west of the present town of Najaf; Qadisiyah was then a village, and its existence as such continued until the 14th century of the Christian era, if not longer. NAJAF TOWN Position and site. —Najaf stands in the desert 6 miles west-south west of Kufah on the Hindiyah.; it is situated on a ridge of reddish sandstone and gravel and overhangs and overlooks from the north-east the Bahr or Sea of Najaf, described in the article on the Hindiyah, to which its site falls away in cliffs about 40 feet high. The Bahr is now dry near the town and contains several date plantations. In the plain surrounding the town on every side except the south-west irregular earthen mounds rise in different directions ; some of those to the north and east are about 30 feet high, but their summits are narrow. A mound of rubbish, also narrow-topped but commanding the town, is situated on the south-west side between the town and the Bahr. On the south, between the town and the Bahr, is open ground, where the Turkish expeditionary force destined for Najd was encamped in 1904- 1905. The Hanudiyah canal from the Hindiyah., mentioned again further on, runs in the bed of the Bahr skirting the foot of the cliffs ; its bed, opposite the town, is 12 feet wide and 6 feet deep, and the water in it runs in midwinter about 6 feet wide and 6 inches deep; it is occasionally filled up by drifting sand. The Hamidiyah canal is sometimes, from the name of the Saniyah agent who constructed it, called the (A) Bakriyah &lt;*^6 Cemeteries adjoin the northern and eastern sides of the town. The environs generally contain market gardens and plantations of young date trees which have not yet begun to bear fruit,1310 NAJAF TOWN Town and buildings.—ThQ town of Najaf, which is roughly quadran gular, is surrounded by a wall built a century ago to defend it from the attacks of the Wahhabis; the wall is about 30 feet high and has circular bastions, some 50 in number and each 50 feet in diameter, at intervals of 100 yards. This work is now in a state of decay ; in places it is cracked and in others it is actually falling down. There are two main gateways with gates, one 12 and the other 9 feet wide, on the eastern face of the town ; of these the larger is the Bab-al-Husain v b; and the other, opened only three years ago, is the Bab-al-Kufah diyJI ob . On the south-west side towards the Bahr is a third gate, called Bab Murad on account of a tradition that the turban of the Sultan Murad IV fell off when he was passing through it in 1638 or 1639 A.D. In the western wall is an aperture known as Thilmah aJj which has no gate but is large enough to afford a passage for field artillery or other vehicles. At the north-east corner of the town, adjoining the military barracks, is a fifth gate spoken of simply as Bab The principal building in Najaf is the shrine which contains the tomb of 'Ali; it rises in the centre of the town and is even richer and more splendid than the shrine of Husain at Karbala. In general design it resembles the sacred edifices of Karbala; but it is double-storeyed, and the gold plating of the minarets reaches almost to the ground. Its dome has been described as ' a mound of gold rising from the level deserts/'* The main bazaar of Najaf runs from the shrine to the larger eastern gate, and in it are situated the Turkish Government buildings or Sarai. The dilapidated barracks of the Ottoman troops are in the north-eastern part of the town. About a score of caravansarais for travellers are located in different quarters ; these include 5 or 6 well-built brick Khans of modern construction which stand outside the town on the north-east side at about 25 yards from the town wall. The houses of Najaf are mostly of brick and mortar and new ones of modern design are steadily replacing those in the old style. The site of Najaf is greatly overcrowded. Up to the present time the efforts of the executive authorities to arrange for an extension have been frustrated by the Auqaf or Department of Religious Endowments. nS , w Inhabitants. —The population of Najaf, which has greatly increased during the last generation, is now estimated at more than 30,000 souls. ^ Of these more than one-third are Persians and nearly all the remainder are L ^ # See Loftus's Travels and Besearches, page 52.—Loftus and his party are perhaps ^ ^ the only Christians who have ever entered the precincts of the shrine.NAJAF TOWN 1311 Arabs; but there are also about 250 Negroes, 100 Barbaris of Afghan origin ; 100 Indians and 50 Turks. No Jews or Christians are found. With the exception of about 100 Sunnis, chiefly government employes, the entire population (including the Barbaris) is Shi'ah. The town is divided between two turbulent political or municipal factions, the Shumurd ^ and Zugurd , of which the origin and raison d'etre have not been explained, and in the past the public peace was often disturbed by their frays ; even at the present time serious fighting sometimes takes place between them in the streets. The atmosphere of Najaf is one of Shfah culture and bigotry^ both carried to greater lengths than at Karbala ; and most of the permanent residents depend for their livelihood on functions connected with the shrine, the pilgrims, or religion. There are many Mujtahids, some of whom carry great weight in the Shi'ah world; also real and nominal students of Shi^ah theology to the number, probably, of several thousands. The town boasts 15 Madrasahs or religious high schools and 90 mosques. Resources. —In a place so artificial as Najaf^ a large town situated in a desert, supplies and transport are necessarily deficient. The water of the Bahr, when it contains any, is not drunk except by animals ; but it serves for washing and other domestic purposes. A better water ui supply is now furnished by the Hamidiyah ^ an open canal, the property of the Dairat-as-Saniyah, which brings the water of the Hindiyah. to the town; and the ancient jingling proverb ; ^DI ajbj - -jid]AA&gt;He who tales up lis residence in Najaf must he content with hracJcish well-water and barley-bread compensated for ly the virtue of the shrine of 'Ali ''—has now lost its appropriateness. Trade and manufactures. —The trade of Najaf, of which the river port is Kufah., depends on local consumption, on the influx of pilgrims, and in a minor degree on intercourse with Jabal Shammar. Two-thirds of the imports are said to be consumed by pilgrims. The trade with Najaf is carried on by Hadrahs or commercial missions from the interior, sometimes private enterprises and sometimes officially despatched by the Amir of Jabal Shammar, which visit Najaf periodically to make purchases. In seasons of scarcity inland there is a steady flow of grain from Najaf to Hail. The principal exports of Najaf are lambskins, sheepskins and wool brought in from the adjacent country, ■'Abas manufactured in the town, and grain. The chief imports are Manchester piece-goods from Baghdad, sugar, Indian spices, tea, largely from Calcutta, hardware and timber.1312 NAJAF TOWN' The most important local manufacture is of silken and woollen ^Abas^ dyed in fast colours and embroidered with gold thread ; it maintains about 200 looms and 30 shops in the town. There is a business also, as at Karbala, in praying tablets and inscribed shrouds. jpeD lllf^ .liitk f( ■iljtlelo itiiM ip#! 1 sill Ij 111 ' Mtical atolle Po ilwtt iilittt Administration, —Najaf is the headquarters of the Oadha of the same name and the seat of a Qaim-Maqam, but Turkish officialdom is not conspicuous ; it seems to be maintained, perhaps in order to avoid wounding Shi'ah susceptibilities, at the lowest strength compatible with effective control. The Sanitary and Public Debt Departments and the Tobacco Eegie are each represented by a Mamur. A single telegraph wire connects Najaf with the Euphrates valley line at Hillah vm Karbala and Tawainj, but the working of this branch is inefficient and in 1905 it remained interrupted for several months continuously. There is also a post-office at Najaf, and a govern ment primary school exists in the town, but it is a small one and indifferent. The military garrison of Najaf is one company of infantry and the force of Dhabitiyahs is even smaller, but there are about 300 military reservists at call for whom rifles are kept in store, and the town a W is the headquarters of the 4th battalion of the 84th Radif regiment. The M ^ town itself is administered as a municipality. The municipal building p 1 ''™' consists of 6 or 7 rooms, partly furnished, over the Bab-al-Husain: it was placed at the disposal of the British Consul-General on the occasion of his ^j. last visit to Najaf (1905). The interests of Persian subjects at Najaf are protected by a paid ij^ Naib-Karpardaz or Persian Consular Agent. Ihini. i!%w Religious importance. —Najaf owes its celebrity and even its existence ^ to the estimation in which it is held by Shfah Muhammadans as a place iJniij, of pilgrimage and interment; the subject of the Shi'ah pilgrimages is fcll,( fully dealt with in another place. * The consecrated cemetery of Najaf, M-SO known as the Wadi-as-Salam r XwJ! or Valley of Salvation, is even more highly esteemed than the corresponding necropolis of Karbala; it covers the sandy plain to the north and east of the town, and it con- tains, besides myriads- of obscure tombs, a few pretentious mausoleums % ^ and a number of enclosed family graveyards : some of the last are pictured 11!^ as delightful places of retirement and seclusion. The deposit of bodies, at pmtaii the rate of several thousands annually, has now been going on at Naja l*i for centuries, grave being superimposed on grave; mouldering bones are often visible, and the soil must now consist largely of decomposed J human remains. This enormous difficulty in the way of sanitation may L,^ account for the epidemics which sometimes ravage the place in spite of a j^, climate said to be healthy in comparison with that of the neigbourhood. See the Gazetteer Appendix on Keligions. ki\iNAJD ISiS Najd or Central Arabia consists of the three provinces of Jabal NAJD Shammar or Northern Najd, of Qasim or Midd le Najd and of Southern ^ The compilation of all accessible Information relafeing to Najd or Central Arabia was commenced by the writer in 1904 and in November of that year the result appeared in the form of 57 printed foolscap pages. Copies of these preliminary notes were taken by the writer to Kuwait and Bahrain, where he personally initiated further investigations, and after his return to India the work of inquiry was continued by the local officers. During 1905 much new information, especially in regard to tribes, was obtained by Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait; and the principal routes across Arabia were successfully worked out by Mr. J. c! Gaskm, Political Assistant. The materials obtained during 1905, after being added to those already existing, took shape in February 1906 as printed draft 'articles extending to 162 octavo pages. The work, however, was still incomplete; and during 1906, by the labours of Captain Knox at Kuwait and of Captain F, B. Prideaux, Political Agent, assisted by Mr. In am-at-Haqq, in Bahrain, so great a quantity of fresh data was amassed that the next set of drafts, printed in January 1907, filled no less than 260 octavo pages. These again became the subject of fresh references to the Political Agents which were disposed of in the course of the year. Captain Knox dealt chiefly with the eastern end of Qasim and the more northern of the Wahhabi districts, while Captain Prideaux extended his investigations over the whole of Southern INTajd and also mer Qasim. Mr.. C. M, Doughty, the Central Arabian traveller, and Mr. D. G, Hogarth, author of The Penetration of Arabia, were good enough to examine some of the more important of the earlier draft articles. The following are the principal published works which contain general and topographical information regarding Ndjdf—Sadlier's Diary of a Journey across Arabia (in 1819) ; Wallin's Notes taJcen on a Journey tKrough Part of Northern Arabia in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society for 1851; Wallin's Narrative of a Journey from Cairo to Medina and Mecca, by Suez, Arab a, Tawila, AI Jauf Jubhe, Hail and JSejd in 1845 in the Journal of the Eoyal Geographical Society for 1854; Palgrave's A 7 arrative of a Tear's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia, 1865 ; Guarmani's Itineraire de Jerusalem au Neged Septentrional in the B.S.G. for 1865; Beport on a Journey to the Wahabee Capital of Riyadh, 1866; Colonel E.

Ch. Hubar's posthumous Journal d'un Voyage en Arabic, 1888-84 ; published in 1891 ; and Mr. D. G. Hogarth's Penetraiion of Arabia, 1904. AU of these, except the two German authorities, are accompanied by valuable maps ; those contained in M. Hvhsv * Journal and in Mr. Doughty 'a book are the most important. The best general map of Najd at the present time is the one issued with this Gazetteer. It has been compiled by Captain F. Eraser Hunter, I. A., from all available sources, including those described above and also the following; maps contained in Brydges' Brief History of the Wahauby, 1834, and in Mongin's Histoire Sommaire de 7 Jtgyjpte, 1839; Captain Knox's Map of the 'Aridh District, 1906, and Map of the Sadair District, 1906, both from native information, Noa. 1374 and 1385 in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla; Captain 4 P131^ NAJD Najd ? andtlie articles under those names comprise, if read in conjunction, most of what if is necessary to know concerning Central Arabia. We have reserved for the present article the discussion of routes, for which, as lying- partly in one province and partly in another, an appropriate place could not elsewhere be found; also the description of a few villages, wells and natural features belonging to districts which do not possess recognised names 5 and, lastly, a short notice of the political organisation and external relations of the country at the present time. Routes.—The three principal routes of Central Arabia are those which traverse it from Hofuf, Kuwait and Najaf to Makkah, where they meet; and they ate the first described in the tables that follow. Next are tabu lated the sections of a great longitudinal route which, beginning 011 the confines of Syria, runs crosswise to the first three and intersects the Najaf-Makkah route at Hail; the Kuwait-Makkah route at Buraidah and the Hofuf-Makkah route near the head of Wadi Hanifah. The subject is concluded with an account of the routes connecting 'Anaizah with Madinah and Makkah and with an enumeration of several subsidiary routes linking together places of minor importance.

It leaves Makkah on the 7th Muharram, starts again from MadTnah on the 1 6th Muharram and arrives in Najaf on the 18th Safarj thus taking about 42 days on the return-journey, inclusive of the ten days' halt at Madinah.NAJT) The portion of this route between Najaf and Hail is called the Darb Zubaidah or Darb-as-Sultani ^IkLJI It was travelled (in the reverse direction) by the Blunts in 1879 and by Huber in 1881. The line followed in both cases was, some trifling deviations apart; that described in the table above, but many of the halting-places were different.'* Huber mentions two subsidiary routes from the Eu phrates valley to Hail ; the first, called Darb Grhazal, is to the west of the Darb Zubaidah; while the second, styled the Darb Samawah because it starts from that place, is to the east of it and runs by the wells of Lainah.t The Darb Grhazal is probably identical with the route by which Wallin travelled from Hail to Najaf in 1848. The following are the principal points on Wallin^s route, which was in his time considered safer, but more difficult, than the ordinary route :— Name. Nature, Hours from the last point.

At 6| hours a sand- ridge called Dahanah is reached which is considered to be the north-eastern boun dary of the Naftid: it is crossed in I an hour and the stony desert of Hajarah is entered. At 7 hours the direction of the route becomes more northerly. Low ridges of lime stone and conglome rate sandstone are At 51 hours the dis trict of Musbaiqiq is pas sed. It has cisterns which dry up iu summer. At 8| hours the end of Hajarah is readied and an open valley con taining acacias is entered. The road runs over a crisp sandy soil and then passes through a defile in the isolated hill of Jabal Sanam The total length of this route is about 340 miles and Wallin^s hours may therefore be reckoned (with allowance for deviations) at about 3 miles eaeh. The average direction is to the north-north east; but the northing apparently increases in the last 4 or 5 stages.* Route No. IV,—From Kdf to Hail, This is a highly important route^ being the direct avenue of approach fco Central Arabia from the Mediterranean basing The portion beyond Kaf and towards Syria lies outside our scope : the remainder may be * See Wallin in J. G. S., 1851, pages 336—339.NAJD 1333 divided into two sectionSj that from Kaf to Jauf-aP -Amir and that from the Jauf to Hail. The former of these lies, except the last march, along Wadi Sirhall, of which the general characteristics are described in a special article. There appear to be 3 or 4 j parallel or intersecting routes in the Wadi, and a comparison of the narratives of different travellers shows that there must be a considerable choice of halting places with water. The water is generally brackish and in places extremely so ; fuel however appears to be sufficient. The distance from Kaf to Jauf is about 160 miles and the journey does not seem to be a very difficult one. The remainder of the route from JauftoHail, a distance by road of some 280 miles, lies, except the first few miles from Jauf and the last 25 miles before Hail, entirely in the sands of the Nafud. The ordinary line, that which with slight deviations has been followed by all European travellers except Nolde, * runs straight from Jauf to'Alam-an-Nafud; thence direct to Jubbah ; and from Jubbah by Qana, where the Nafud is finally quitted, round the north-west end of Jabal Aja to Hail. Except in Wadi Shaqiq, not far from Jauf, no water is obtainable between Jauf and Jubbah, a distance of 170 miles ; consequently there are no fixed halting places between these two stations. Fuel appears to be ample for the requirements of caravans. A general idea of the nature of the route can be obtained from the article on the Nafud. Here we may add that the track, called Khali Bani Hilal ^ cK, Khali Abu Zaid or simply Khali is merely a camel path about one foot broad, and that in the more exposed parts it is often obliterated by wind, camel droppings alone remaining to mark the way ; it is seldom clearly defined except between ^Alam-an-Nafud and Jubbah. It is said that the journey between Jauf and Jubbah can be accomplished in 3 days on a good drome dary, but apparently no European traveller has performed it in less than 49| hours, and the average time taken by Europeans appears to be about 75 hours, of actual travelling.t * 'Who travelled by Qarah and Haiyaniyah ; see his Beise, pages 16- 28, f For detailed accounts of this route the reader is referred to Wallin, J.

The route at first runs through broken ground, and at 15 or 20 miles a valley running from north west to south-east is crossed in which there are wells. Thereafter the way lies amidst detached rocky hills, and at 40 or 45 miles something resembling a range is crossed, of which the direction is from north-west to south-east. It is probable that this route joins Route No. ill (return section) near the stage called Shaqrah, about 30 miles west-south-west of Hana kiyah, and so reaches Madinah. Route No. VIII.—From 'Anaizah to Maklcah. This route is parallel to the Kuwait - M akkah route through Buraidah and is distant from it only a few miles south-eastwards. It was traversed % Doughty in 1878 and by Huber in 1884; an analysis of Doughty^s stages to the point where they become identical with those of Route No. I is given below.* Disputes with Bedouir s as to the use of the wells * The two routes appear to unite some 3 marches before the point to which we have carded this one, but the stages do not at once become ideptical. fl ll I 111342 NAJD give less trouble on this route, but the watering places are further apart and are not so good as on the Buraidah- M akkah line. The journey is not to be undertaken, in summer at least, without considerable hardship from scarcity of water. The large ghi caravans which go from ' Anaizah to Makkah every summer travel this way ; otherwise, apparently, this track is not much used, for wood is still abundant near some of the halting- places.

There is another route between 'Anaizah and Makkah further to the eastward: it is called Darb Wadi Sabai ; , has few and small watering pi ace S; and is used only by well mounted men travelling rapidly. Minor routes in Central Arabia,—A few subsidiary routes of lesserNAJD 1345 importance, of which accounts are extant, may be noticed before leaving the subject. The route between Taimah and Hail has been described by Wallin, Doughty and Huber,* to whom we may add Guarmani for a part of the way.t A route from Taimah to Jauf-al-'Amir is given by Doughty from native information; | and his personal experiences between Khaibar and Hail are on record, as well as those of Huber. § Passing to the other side of the peninsula we note the route followed by Pelly from Kuwait to Sidus together with the branch routes of which he makes incidental mention, H A practicable but little frequented and probably difficult route is said to lead from the coast of Qatar to the Haatah district of Southern Najd.H Supplementary information about minor routes in various parts of the country will be found in the articles Dhrumah, Hariq, Jauf-al-'AlUir and Parj. We conclude with an itinerary, from native information, of the journey from Salaiyil in Widyan Dawasir to Hasa; it traverses one of the least known parts of Central Arabia. The stages are Hamam, 1 day 1 Badr in Aflaj, 4 days; * ^Kharfah in Aflaj, 6 hours, followed in ^ or 3 hours by Lailah, also in Aflaj ; Hautah days; Dilam in Kharj, li days; Yamamah in Kharj, 4 hours; Abu Jifan, 3 days; Hofuf in Hasa, 6 days. The general direction of this route is from south-west to north-east, and a comparison of its last 6 stages with the first 3 of Route No. I suggests that the 'days' are short, each representing only 20 to 25 miles.

Itim Batn Hajarah i. NAJD ftorth-JEastern District. Hazil Khadhra (Jabal) 4Ji .lL a Lainah or Llnah AijJ A depression included in the desert of Hajarah and crossed on the route from Najaf to Hail at about one-third of the distance from Najaf. Batn has a length from north-west to south-east of about 100 miles, one-third of which is to the west of the usual Najaf-Hail route and the remainder to the east of it: the breadth of Batn is about 3 hours and its slope is downwards to the south-east. On the south Batn is bounded by a clay plain, which gradually rises from it; and on the north by a remarkable rocky scarp, called Jal-al-Batn , about 140 feet high and co-extensive in length, or nearly so, with the Batn itself. Above the Jal, is a stony tableland stretching away to the north without visible change of level. The track scales the Jal, of which the vertical face is to the Batn plain, by a difficult pass, called merely 'Aqabat isi* j here camels frequently lose their footing, and elsewhere the Jal is said to be generally impossible of ascent even by men climbing. The surface of Batn at the bottom of the Jal shows signs of strong water action and contains some pasture. There are various wells in Batn and its elevation above the sea is about 1,640 feet. Batn is debatable land between the Shammar and 'Anizah tribes. A hard stony tract or calcareous desert of great extent, lying to the north-east of the Nafud between Hazil on the north-west and a point considerably beyond the ordinary Najaf-Hail route on the south-east. On the south Hajarah is bounded by the Nafud and on the north it includes Batn and a considerable area beyond,^ approaching to within about. 50 miles of TiTajaf*. The greater part of Hajarah consists of an unvarying succession of broad ridges, like waves, alternating with gravelly plains; not a single hill meets the eye to relieve the monotony or serve as a landmark, unless we except the Jal-al-Batn and a couple of small hills called 'Athamin ) which are 10 miles north of Batn on the west side of the Darb Zubaidah. Hajarah is traversed both by the Darb Zubaidah and by the Hazil route between Najaf and Hail. Shammar and 'Anizah Bedouins camp in it while pasturage lasts and while there is water in the tanks upon the Darb. A camping ground on the more westerly route between Najaf and HSil, apparently about midway between those places. There are said to be over 100 wells at Hazil, sunk through sandstone rock, in which the water stands at 12 to 20 fathoms. A route from Jauf-al-'Amir to Sbabaikah on the Darb Zubaidah passes through a place Hazil which can hardly be the same as this one.f A solitary hill 2 hours south-west of the Khadhra wells on the ordinary Najaf-Hail route. It stands in a depressed tract of dark soil which covers a large area. A famous camping ground, but its position is difficult to fix : it is variously stated to lie 30 miles east of the Darb Zubaidah, \\ days north-east of the Khadhra wells on the same, 3 days north-west and 4 days north, respectively, of the Batin and Mustawi sections of Wadi-ar-Eurnmah, and close to Jal-al-Batn at 6 stages from Samawah. The celebrated wells of Lainah are said to be about 300 in number and are sunk through hard white rock ; the water, • See Wallin's route in Route III, ante. t Hubert Hazil (from native information) is much further west fchau WalHn's ; and a recent report on native authoiity places one Hazil at only 3 caravan days from Jauf-al- 'Amir.R ^ J NAJD 184? Loqah Rutha (Wadi-ar-) iyf cs^ij Sha'aibah Taisiyah dxw.j.j (Jal-al-) IjJ | ^JUk. Zubaidah (Darb) which is at 10 fathoms, is good but not what Arabs oall ' sweet.' Dhafir say that the water supply at Lainah would suffice for the whole of their tribe. Some miles to the east of Lainah is another group of wells, called Bida' , which contain good water at 4 fathoms ; Shammar Bedouins encamp round them in summer. A halting-place on the direct route from Jauf-al-'Amir to Shabaikah on the Darb Zubaidah : it is said to lie 6 hours east of Hazil (probably the second Hazil referred, to above) and to possess about 25 wells with water, equal in goodness to river water, at 12 fathoms from the surface. A valley which begins between the wells of Lainah and Birkat 'Ashshar on the ordinary Najaf-Hail route; it runs north as far as Birkat Zibakh on that route, its drainage then dispersing partly northwards to Batn and partly eastwards to Hajarah. The Wadi is two or three miles in breadth, and its fall in a course of some 25 miles appears to be about 500 feet. The name Kutha is derived from a plant which grows in the valley and is much prized as pasture for both camels and horses; the grazing rights belong to the Shammar. A camping ground about 25 miles east of Baqa'a sometimes used by the Persian Haji as an intermediate stage between Khadhra and Qitaiyan near Baqa'a. At one time the pilgrim roate instead of continuing through Hail turned southwards at this point and ran to Buraidah in Qasim. Sha'aibah has 30 or 40 wells, 15 to 20 feet deep, of very salt and bitter water ; they stand in a large bare space with hills of white sand to the north of them. A great plain which extends from the Dahanah on the east into Qasim on the west. Its eastern end, which is diversified by ravines and ridges with ber and acacia trees, is crossed on the route from Kuwait to Makkah between Thamami and Taivib Ism; at its western extremity it lies within the Qasim border and apparently divid.es into two prongs, Taisiyat-ash-Shamaliyah m m djJio-St and Taisiyat-al-Janublyah adjoin the Fuwailik plain on its north and south sides respectively. A scarp somewhat similar to Jal-al-Batn and parallel to it, but in every way less striking ; it crosses the Darb Zubaidah 20 or 30 miles on the Najaf side of Batn. This Jal is said to have a length of about 40 miles and consists of two tiers with an aggregate height of 70 feet and with a level space between them 100 yards in extent. The steep face of the scarp is to the south-west. This term is now practically a synonym for the Persian pilgrim- route * to Makkah from Najaf as far as the beginning of the Nafud, but it originally referred to a well-cared-for highway of which the construction is attributed by tradition to Zubaidah, wife of Harun-ar-Rashid. Many vestiges of this great public work still exist, chiefly in the form of tanks or Birak of masonry and cement, some of them of great dimensions and excellent work manship ; the remains of over a dozen are seen by the way, hut the only one which escaped the destructive energy of the Wah- habis and is now in serviceable order is the Birkat Jamaimah, a march to the south of Batn. In a couple of places there aie remnants of the walls enclosing the road on both sides by which, * See Route No. III.1348 NAJD it is said, Zubaidah intended that even the l)lind should be enabled to feel their way to the Holy Cities ; and at various halting places there are ruins of what must atone time have been considerable stations.* South-Western District. Dhariyah Dukhnah Duwadimi Hazam or Ha/am-ar-Raji Rilit (Jabal) Rhanuqah Khazaz (Jabal) ly A village situated 2 days' south-south-west of Bass in Qasim on the Kuwait -Makkah route. It consists of about 40 mud houses. Grain and vegetables are grown, but there are no date palms; irrigation is from a score of wells with good water at 7 fathoms. The inhabitants are partly negroes and partly Arabs of Qasimi extraction. 'Ataibah, Harb and Mutair Bedouins all camp in the neighbourhood of Dhariyah. A camping ground 50 miles south-south-west of 'Anaizah and 4 or 5 miles eastwards from Jabal Khazaz. There are about 40 wells scattered over a space of 1 or 2 miles; they contain good water at about 3 fathoms. At one time Dukhnah was exclusively occupied by the Mutair, but it subsequently passed to the 'Ataibah, whose tribute to the A_mir of Jabal Shammar was collected here in 1884. The Qahtan have been known to visit the place, and were surprised and severely punished there in 1878 by the Mutair and the people of 'Anaizah with whom they were then at feud. A considerable walled village of Sabai' on the route from Riyadh to Makkab ; it is situated in the desert about two-thirds of the way from 'Ayainah in Wadi Hanifah to Jabal-an-Nir and probably lies about 110 miles south and slightly east of 'Anaizah. There are date groves and numerous wells with sweet water at 8 fathoms. A great tract of stony desert of which the eastern border is near the 'Afif wells ; its extent south-westwards from Afif is 2^ days march and its length from north to south is ex « ee , d .i ts breadth.

Political organisation and external relations. —The normal con stitution of Jabal Shammar, Qasim and Southern Najd, the three states which together compose Central Arabia, is described in the articles Under their names. Each of those articles, however, ends with the intima* tion that an ostensible Turkish sovereignty or suzerainty has been established in the tract with which it deals, and it remains to consider here how far the Ottoman Crovernment have been successful in enforcing their pretensions. nisr) 7 \ li i l rn p1350 NAJD In 1904, when a state of war had for some years prevailed between Ihn Sa'ud, ruler of Southern Najd, and Ibn Bashid, the Amir of Jabal Sliammar, the Turks intervened with a military force on the side of Ibn Rashid ; hut they were defeated in two actions by the followers of Ibn Sa'ud and the people of Qasim, nor were these reverses ever made good on the field of battle. Early in 1905, however, Ottoman officials at Basrah succeeded in inducing Ibn Sa'ud to negotiate. The result of the discussions became apparent in April 1905, when Qasim was formally occupied by the Turks and it was understood that Ibn Sa'ud had professed allegiance to the Sultan ; the efiect, Ibn Rashid being already a Turkish vassal, was to convert the whole of Central Arabia, at least in name, into a Turkish province. A Turkish cantonment was established at Shaihiyah in Qasim and Turkish garrisons of 100 men each were placed in the towns of 'Anaizah and Buraidah ; but no attempt was made, apparently, to occupy any point either in Jabal Shammar or in Southern Kajd. The design of the Porte was plainly to create out of Qasim a neutral state, garrisoned by themselves, which should serve to separate the territories of the rival native powers in Central Arabia and prevent their committing aggressions upon one another ; and the Turkish Government probably hoped that their own commanding position between the disputants would throw the balance of Bower into their hands and enable them to dominate, with an insignificant military force, the politics of Central Arabia. So far did the confidence of the Turks in their scheme extend, that they proceeded to parcel out the country into civil administrative divisions as if it had actually been incor porated with the Ottoman dominions. Southern Najd was declared to be a Qadha, having its M arkaz or headquarters at hiyadh and 1 on a u for Qaim-Maqam. In Qashn, Buraidah and the places dependent on i were erected into a Qadha under Salih -bin-Hasan-bin-Mahanna, ai of Buraidah, as Qaim-Maqam ; and at the same time 'Anaizah and t » villages were constituted a Mudiriyah, of which 'Abdul 'Aziz-bm- u a hin-Yahya, Shaikh of 'Anaizah, was appointed the first lvIudlr ' e ne Qaim-Maqam of Southern Najd and the Qaim-Maqam and Mwhr o Qasim were nominally made subject to the authority of t e Basrah ; but the relations towards each other of the last two o no seem to have been defined; and the titles of all, as soon became mamtet, wer? honorific and implied no real subordination to the Porte. No m ^ civil officials from abroad were introduced into the new province not even into its Qasim district: indeed the whole of the arrangements iom first wore little better than make-believe. f T om The results of the scheme were far) it may safely e ;NAJD (SOUTHERN) 1361 corresponding with the anticipations of the projectors. The Turkish military garrison in Qasim was never after its institution employed to enforce compliance with Turkish policy; and, being rapidly reduced by desertions and deaths, it soon ceased to inspire awe or even respect. In April 1906 the son- of Ibn Sa 'ud, ignoring the presence of the Turks in Qasim, attacked and slew Ibn Rashid on the borders of that district; and a little later he seized and deported the Shaikh of Buraidah, who enjoyed, equally with his own father Ibn Sa'ud, the status of a Turkish Qaim-Maqam. The weakness of the Turks in Central Arabia was such that they dared not even manifest their displeasure at these insulting acts; and from the latest reports it would seem that their military strength in the country soon after reached the vanishing point. In the circumstances it does not appear that the claim of the Turks to have established effective sovereignty, or even a protectorate, over Central Arabia could at present be substantiated j on the contrary, it would appear that, in strict accordance with facts, the whole of Central Arabia should be regarded as still independent of their authority. It is possible that in the future the Porte may take measures which will place their title to the possession of Central Arabia upon a valid basis ; but up to the present time they have not succeeded in doing so. lor want of a more distinctive term sanctioned by usage we are obliged NAJD* to call by this name the assemblage of districts which form the southern (SOUTH- part of Central Arabia and constitute the hereditary dominions of the ERN) WahhabiAmir. Middle Najd is better known under the title of Qasim, and Northern Najd is generally referred to as .Tabal Shammar ; but Southern Najd has no alternative designation, and it is not clear that the name even which we have applied to it is current among the Arabs. i/sm^.—Political changes keep the boundary- of Southern Najd to the north in perpetual vibration; but westward, on this side, it teuds to settle at Wadi-as -Sirr between Washam and Qasim, and further to the east at Wadi-ar -Rummah on its lower course from Qasim to the Dahanah. On the west the frontier of Southern Najd is approximately represented by a line parallel to the watershed between the Red Sea basin and Central Arabia and about 100 miles east of it. On the remaining two sides the limits of Southern Najd are natural and well marked: on the south it ends in the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Southern •For information regarding authorities, maps, eto., see the footnote to the title of article Najd.1352 NAJD (SOUTHERN) Desert, and on the east it is separated from the littoral districts of the Persian Gulf by that comparatively narrow, but long and perfectly continuous strip of desert which is known as the Dah^nah. Physical features and divisions. —Southern Najd has never been surveyed, and the greater part of it is as yet unseen by European eyes, nevertheless something is known of its chief regions and their characteristics. The dominant feature of the country is Jabal Tuwaiq, a range or elevated tract which has its commencement approximately in the 27th parallel of north latitude and thence runs almost due southwards for the space of at least five degrees of latitude. Of the actual height, breadth and configuration of the northern part of this range or plateau we have little certain information; of the southern, none. Our knowledge of Jabal Tuwaiq is practically confined to the facts that in the north it consists of a light-coloured stone, calcareous in appearance; that its eastern slopes give birth, rather nearer its northern than its southern end, to Wadi Hanifah, one of the only large valleys, properly so called, of Central Arabia ; and that beyond Hantah the hills assume a darker hue and are perhaps of a different geological formation. The existence of this imperfectly known range enables us to distribute the districts of Southern Najd into three groups, the first consisting of the districts which reach from Jabal Tuwaiq eastwards to the DahaHi^h; the second of the single one between Jabal Tuwaiq and the Great Southern Desert, and the third of those that lie on the farther (that is On the western) side of Jabal Tuwaiq. The northernmost district of the first group is Sadair, which lies chiefly on the Tuwaiq plateau, and is furrowed by four well marked hollows, of which one has a westerly and the other three an easterly course. The district contains a fair proportion of arable land, and water k obtained from rather shallow wells, but does not apparently reach the surface in springs. Immediately south of Sadair, and not divided from it by any very conspicuous landmark, is the premier district, in the political sense, of all Najd : this is 'Aridh, a tract hilly or even mountainous towards the north, west and south, level to the east and in the centre, and seamed across by the deep Wadi Hanifah^ with its numerous villages and (in places) highly cultivated banks. An includes Dhmmahj, a valley lying to the west of the Tuwaiq hills but sending its drainage through that range into the lower course of *Vadl Hanifah. The hilly mass of Jabal 'Alaiyah, perhaps an eastern outlier ofNAJD (SOUTHERN) 1353 jabal Tnwaiq, divides Aridh from the next trough or compartment to the southward, that formed by the three interconnected districts of Hariq, Hutah and Kharj. Of these Hariq, the north-westernmost and probably the most shut in, drains downwards into the lower but still moun tain girdled plain of Hautah, which leads in its turn to the open arable district of Kharj on the east. Hariq and Hautah are covered with date groves, irrigated by water which camels raise from wells of no excessive depth. To the north-east and east of Kharj is SahSbah, a sandy and featureless tract with one large spring : not only the drainage of Hariq, Haatah and Kharj, but also the floods of Wadi Hanifahfrom 'Aridh, cross SahSbah to be finally absorbed and disappear in the Dah^nah. Aflaj, the next to the south, is the last of the eastern districts; its upper portion is divided from Hautah by a spur, probably of Jabal Tuwaiq ; but its lower lies open to Kharj ; on the south it seems to meige through the sandy and scrub-grown hollow of Maqraninto the great Euba'-al-Khali. The upper or western end of Aflaj is covered with thorny jungle^ while its centre is irrigated from flowing* springs and numerous wells and at its lower extremity it passes into blank and waterless plains. Shutbah, an inhabited recess in the eastern face of Tuwaiq, is close to the south-western corner of Aflaj and may be reckoned a part of that district, Next is reached Widyan Dawasir, the only district of Najd that lies immediately between Tuwaiq and the Great Southern Desert: the head of the valley or aggregation of valleys composing it is said to lie towards the Red Sea watershed, its lengthy and apparently open course seems to be from west to east; and its lower extremity is the sub-district of Salaiyil ; a sandy tract which is irrigated exclusively from wells and lies perhaps 80 to 100 miles south of Shutbah, with a small fertile locality called Hamam intervening. Widyan Dawasir is, in parts, not ill supplied with water from wells ; and it contains many villages and date Plantations and much cultivation. At some point Widyan Dawasir receives, it is said, from the west a part of the drainage of Wadi Sabai*, the first of the trans- Tuwaiq districts which we have had occasion to notice. This district is a plain or system of open valleys with springs and shallow wells, where cultivable soil alternates with sandy desert and collections of stagnant water are formed after rain. W r ith Wadi Sabaf is associated another Wadi, that of Tathlith, which lies apparently to the south of it and is sometimes reckoned a separate district of Southern Najd. The last remaining district, Washam, is also behind Tuwaiq, but less remoteikkiC® 1 U* ifitljm 01 .tktseBm 1364 NAJD (SOUTHERN) from the centre of Southern Najd ; it lies immediately west of Sadair gt and 'Aridh; it is practically surrounded by sandy deserts or by hills, and its drainage seems to have no outfall. The soil of Washam is described # as a sandy loam, at times cultivable by the unassisted rainfall. More full ^ f ^ and exact information in regard to these districts is given under the name of each. ^ Southern Najd is, like Jabal Shammar, a portion of Central Arabia which the lava hills in the west of the peninsula have saved from burial under growing and moving sands : the limestones are still generally exposed, but here and there, especially in depressions, are strips and intervals of sand. Climate and products. climate is healthy and, in the highlands, even invigorating. Pasture is abundant, but there is a scarcity of trees except date-palms. The four staple products ol; nearly all the districts are dates, barley^ wheat and maize ; but cotton and millet are also grown. Some localities produce fruits, including figs, peaches, citrons, grapes, ^ pomegranates and melons ; also lucerne, brinjals, onions, spinach and other vegetables. The date groves of Wadi Hanifah are famed for their size and luxuriance, while the palms which cover the valley of Hautah are particularly fine and prolific, a single tree there sometimes yielding (it is said) as much as 14,000 pounds weight of dates in a season : the date plantations of Aflaj are described as extensive but thin. Horses ^ are bred by the nomad tribes and sent, for exportation, to ^Anaizall and Buraidah in Qasim. Camels are numerous ; those of the southern nomads have frequently a blackish tinge and are smaller than the dun-coloured animals of J abal Shammar. There are no buffaloes, but cattle of a small- limbed, humped breed are comparatively abundant in the south, especially in Kliarj : nowhere is there any lack of sheep and goats. Wild animals include leopards, wolves, and jackals ; and in the south lions are said to ar | lces be found. Among the game of the country are the gazelle, bustard, M partridge, sand grouse, quail and pigeon and, possibly, the wild boar. * of i Southern Najd, in common with Jabal Shamniar,* is said to enjoy almost complete immunity from insect pests. Communications. —The main routes which traverse Southern Najd are described in the article on Najd. In regard to minor routes we may J) remark that from Zilfi in Sadair a direct desert route leads to Laqit IH near Kuwait, and that desert routes from Maj ma ; and Eiyadh converge 1 al at Wabrall on the way to Kuwait Wahbabi troops are known ik oi fffi m iiiipi i i sta ilfin AW) * See Rviher's Journal de Voyage, page 179.NAJD (SOUTHERN) 1355 have reached 'Oman by land, but whether after entering Hasa and skirting' the coast or otherwise is uncertain. There is no recognised route between Southern Najd and Qatar, though arms caravans follow that line ; and, so far as can be ascertained, communication with Yaman or Hijaz by way of Widyan Dawasir is not very frequent or active. Population. —The population of Southern Najd, both fixed and migra tory, is composite in a high degree. The Arab tribes to which the settled inhabitants of the districts principally belong are the 'Anizah, Dawasir, Sabai J and Bani Tamim, to whom may be added the Fadhul and Sahul. Of these the Dawasir, besides practically monopolising Widyan Dawasir and Aflaj, are found in all the districts enumerated above as composing the Wahhabi domi nions except the petty ones of Wadi-as -Sirr and Wadi Tathllthj the Sabai ) are the next most widely distributed after the Dawasir ; and the 'Bani Tamim, though not found in so many districts as these two, are a strong tribe and enjoy a local predominance in Sadair. Other Arab stocks, but of less importance as settled residents in this part of the country, are the 'Aid, Ashraf, 'Ataibah, Biiqiim, Bani Hajir, Harb, Hataim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Qahtau, Shammar and Bani Zaid; the number of persons belonging to some of these is very small. Inferior non-Arab tribes of cultivators, comprehensively described as Bani Khadhir, are a large element in the population ; and the menial caste of Sunna ' is represented in many places : there are also a few ''Awazim or Hawazim. A strong infusion of negro blood and a considerable proportion of full negroes are said to exist in the southern districts, especially in Aflaj and W idyan Dawasir. The information available regarding the distribution and numbers of the tribes mentioned will be found in the articles under their names and the names of the districts which they inhabit. The Bedouins of Southern Najd are for the most part these: 'Ataibah in the vast stretch of country between Qasim and Makkah and in the districts of Wadi Sabai^, Wadi-as -Sirr 5 Wasliam, Sadair, Aridh and Kharj; Dawasir in Widyan Dawasir, Aflaj and Kharj j Mutair in Sadair, Washam, Wadi-as -Sirr and in the direction of Miskah and Dhariyah, etc.; Qahtan in Wadi Tathlith, Wadi Sabai^ Washam and even Sadair; and Sabai' in Wadi Sabai', Kharj and ^Aridh. Besides these some 'Ajman visit Kharj and some Buqum frequent adi Sabai'. The Sulaba wander in Southern Najd as they do elsewhere m the interior of Arabia.1356 NAJD (SOUTHERN) The following is a rough calculation of the population of Souther^ Najd, excluding Wadi Tathllth for which no estimate is possible :— | ( (M C ytto Fixed.

The people of Southern Najd are of good physique and often attain an age which would be considered advanced even in Europe; among the manhood of the country the palm is awarded to the Bam Taminl, especially ot Sadair, whose more than average physical development is attributed to the quantity of camel's milk that enters into their diet. The description of the settled population and nomads of Jabal Shammar applies in the main to those of Southern Najd, with this modification, that the inhabitants of Southern Najd are for the most part professed Wahhabis. The meagreness of exports and imports bears testimony, in gpite of the agricultural wealth of a few favoured localities, to the general poverty of the country and to the almost total absence of surplus produce. Horses to India and ghi to Hasa are perhaps the only articles exported, while imports are chiefly arms and ammunition, piece-goods and coffee. About half of the general imports is obtained through Hasa, while the other half is almost equally divided between Kuwait an the ports of Hijaz. The trade in arms is of an exceptional character and ^ol $0 iliilsor a Lsoi®! .irfei 1 : ii{ Ij wig ijliesi iisftcific? jfalWi iliitfo; fhe iMislci skljW sita, WlrAgt I'iWistori ai * is y ^ as tie 114® of I Nljjj] ■ He ]NAJD (SOUTHERN) may not be of long duration ; at present it is conducted by Najdi mer chants who visit the Masqat market once a year and, after purchasing a stock of arms, introduce them into Southern Najd by way of Qatar, a neighbourhood in which their operations are not exposed to interference by any civilised power. English medicines are said to be obtainable in some of the bazaars of Southern Najd and some merchants of the southern districts, especially Hautah, are accustomed to visit India in the course of their ordinary business. Wholesale weights in Najd are the Waznah ^ , equal to 52 dollars in silver coin or about 8 lb. 1 oz. 6 dr. English avoirdupois, and the Mann of 40 Waznahs or about 123 lb. 6| oz. W holes nle weigh merits are g-enerally made with a sort of steelyard. For retail transactions dry and liquid measures of capacity are employed which are really weights in dis guise. These take the form of turned wooden bowls made to contain exactly a unit by weight of the substance or fluid they are intended to measure; this result is obtained by adjusting the cubic capacity of the bowl to the specific gravity of the article for which it is to be used. The m standard sizes of bowl are the Midd a * which holds a Waznah and the Sa'* l^&gt; which holds two ; but quarters, fifths, sixths and eighths of Sa's are also employed. The unit of lineal measure is the Dhira' of 19^ inches. Turkish coins and the Riyal or Maria Theresa dollar circulate in Southern Najd and form the bulk of the currency ; tlie Indian rupee is hardly ever seen. Government* — A genealogical table of the ruling family of Najd wiil be found in the historical volume of this Gazetteer, they are known as the A1 Sa ; ud Jl and the regnant member is Ibn Sa^ud par excellence. As head of the Wahhabi interest the ruler was formerly often described as the Imam ; but political considerations having since eclipsed religious in Southern Najd, he is now generally spoken of as the Amir. The Washam of the A1 Sa^ud is -f- placed, on a camel, on the near quarter: their battle-cry is either ^ ^1 JUL c &lt; I am a horse man of'Aujah, a son of Mijrin,^ or vyi* ^ til ' I am a lord of 'Aujah, a son of Mijrin.' ^Aujah means Dara'iyah and refers to the crookedness of Wadi Hanifah near that place. The vicissitudes undergone by the Wahhabi state have been so many and so violent that a general account based on past events and implying a fixed organisation would necessarily be misleading; nor have we the materials for a complete and reliable description of the constitution and resources of the principality at the present day,1358 NAJD (SOUTHERN) Some permanent features appear in the historical account given in the other volume of this Gazetteer, and for the rest it may be observed that in the palmy days of the Wahbabi empire the greater part of the country was in strict subjection to the Amir; justice was administered by salaried Qadhis of the government; tribes were held responsible for crimes committed within their territory ; attempts were made to abolish the blood-feud system; one-fifth of the spoils of war went into the treasury of the ruler; the ordinary Quranic Zakat was levied on land, merchandise, capital and other forms of property; confiscation of land as a punishment for rebellion, followed by a regrant on terms of tenancy to the original owners, was not un- common ; fines were levied on law-breakers, the proceeds being applied to such purposes as the relief of paupers, the support of teachers and ecclesiastics, the repair of mosques and wells belonging to the state, the maintenance and equipment of indigent soldiers and the entertainment of strangers at public hostels; war was carried on by means of temporary levies of the Amir's subjects collected under a requisition that usually containe d the significant formula: ' We shall not count those who join, but those who do not '; less regular hostilities were initiated by pro claiming the enemy to be beyond the pale of the law; a small body guard of retainers kept by the Amir about bis person was the only semblance of a standing army. The Wabhabis have abated the moral strenuousness of their earlier lays, but an administration modelled somewhat on these lines probably still constitutes their ideal of government. The revenues of the Amir were estimated in 1865 at $402,000, of which $114,000 were derived from the Bedouins. In 1865 the annual revenue was generally received in horses or otherwise in kind ; it was either collected on the spot by emissaries from Riyadh or brought to the capital by leading men in person or their deputies. The revenue of a district is now assessed about a month before the date harvest by a Wakil or subordinate official, gener ally a local man and frequently a merchant, who goes round the planta tions and inspects them in company with a party of camel riders sent from Riyadh. This assessment is called Ikhras j the result of it is communicated at once to the Amir. The duty of collecting the govern ment share, which is taken in kind and is fixed at T V of the gross produce, devolves subsequently on the Wakil, and the Wakil is also responsible for the storage of the same. Such is the procedure in regard to the taxa tion of dates, and that for ordinary agricultural produce is similar. The Amir afterwards makes local payments due by him in the form of ordershso) NAKHL ia59 or Hawalahs on the produce stored at convenient places ; and every six months a settlement takes place with the local officials, in consequence ^ W of which the balance of the Amir's produce is generally sold and the net surplus to which he is entitled is remitted in money to Eiyadll. It is ^4 estimated that about a quarter of the tenth share or Zakat ultimately reaches the central treasury in this manner. Contingents for military service are still demanded by districts and towns, and it is understood that, up to a limit of one month per annum, ^ these contingents must be maintained by the districts furnishing them, ^ \ but their expenses after the first month are defrayed by the Amir. The Wahhabi ruler is represented at various places in his dominions by Amirs or governors; such are Majma , in Sadair^ and Dilam in Kharj. These Amirs may be either local or non-local men, and in places where Ibn Sa^ud has reason to distrust the loyalty of the inhabitants they are generally the latter ; the Governors at the present time at Majma' and Dilam are apparently non-local. The relation of the Widyan Dawasir district, which at present is almost autonomous, to the Wahhabi government is noticed in the article under its name. The present equivocal relations of Southern Najd with the Ottoman Empire are described elsewhere.* A large village, or small town, at the head of Wadi-al-Hammam in NAKHL the Western Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate. The site of Nakhl is enclosed on the south and east by mountains, and to tbe west of it is an intricate country of low hills and ravines. The approach from Wadi Ma'awal is impressive: at first only a watch tower on a pinnacle 200 feet high is visible : next a fort on a hill comes in sight : finally, on skirting the base of the pinnacle and passing under a two-arched viaduct, houses, palms, gardens, orchards and cultivation burst suddenly on the view. The settlement is scattered through date-groves and covers an area of perhaps 4 square miles: the date-plantations, containing 25,000 palms, leave little space for other cultivation. There are 11 permanent quarters, some of which possess more than one Sablah or public hall, and other temporary quarters spring up in the date-season. The elevation above the sea is 1,100 feet, and, as Nakhl receives the sea-breeze and is sheltered from hot winds, the climate is generally fresh and agreeable. The # See article Najd ad Jin.i860 NAKHL fort, which stands on an eminence between the pinnacle rock already mentioned and a hill called Jabal Laban is not now in a serviceable state. Nakhl is celebrated for its hot springs; of these the w largest group, including Hammam Thuwarah ^ and about 20 others, rise among gardens at the bead of the valley : on the other side of the town is a second group, of which the best known is Hammam 'Adaisah These springs are tasteless and inodorous '• their highest temperature is 106 F. The population of Nakhl is mixed : the tribes of which it is composed belong mostly to the Ghafiri faction and include Salamiyin pOO houses), Bayasirah (100 houses), Bani Harras (65 houses), Kunud (50 houses), Ya'aribah (50 houses), Bani Kharus (40 houses), Bani Hadhram (25 houses), Sarairiyin (20 houses), Nabahinah (20 houses), Yahamidah (15 houses), Bani Jabir (10 houses), Hirth of the Khanajirah section (7 houses), and Bani 'Azzan (4 houses). Some of the leading citizens of Nakhl belong to the Bani Harras. There are not many negroes and those are Mutawalladin with Arab blood : no Zatut or resident Persians are now to be found here. The total population of Nakhl is about 3,500 souls. The date-groves are prolific and their produce is celebrated, the NaghalJ^ date of Nakhl, along-shaped variety, being held in high estimation. The water of the spring is entirely expended in irrigation. There is one water-mill for grinding flour. The bazaar consists of two streets and comprises over 60 shops. Turbans called Wizrnh and luno'is called Taurir are made, but these manufactures are not peculiar to Nakhl. Porous earthenware vessels for cooling water are manufactured by local potters, mostly of the Sarairiyin tribe, from bluish clay mixed with sand, some of which comes from Musilmat. Barkah is the port of Nakhl. There are 5 schools in Nakhl, but the people are not more educated than elsewhere in 'Oman. The Sultan of 'Oman maintains here a Wali who is supposed to collect as revenue for his master the value of X V of the agricultural produce, especially of the dates; about $1,200 are realised annually under this head, but there is no surplus over local expenditure to be remitted to the Masqat treasury. The Sultan of ' Oman's authority is maintained by a garrison of 25 men. The present Sultan (Saiyid Faisal) owns some date groves and land at Nakhl as his private property; they are worth $1,000 a year and are at present assigned to the Wali as a grant-in-aid for public purposes. *4NASIRI 1361 «■ Singular Naqbi ^ an Arab tribe found only in the Sharjah Princi- NAQBIYIN pality, and chiefly on the eastern side of the •'Oman Promontory. The principal places which they inhabit are Khor Fakkan, Ghallah, Lulaiyah and Zubarah in the Shamailiyah district; Dibah ; Pahlain in the Sir tract j Khatt in the Jiri plain ^ and Diftah in Wadi Ham. The total number of the tribe appears to be about 1,800 souls, all of whom are engaged in agriculture and similar settled occupations. The Naqbiym belong to the Ghaflri political faction and are Snnnis of the Hanbali sect s they are quite distinct from their neighbours the Sharqiyin, to whom they are generally hostile. Nasiri is the local Persian, Bandar Nasiri the official Persian, and Nasiriyeh the Arabic form of the name. A small but flourishing place, which has sprung up, since the opening of the Karun to steam naviga tion, on the left bank of that river immediately below the Ahwaz rapids and about 1 mile from the village of Ahwaz ; the growth of Nasiri was somewhat tardy until about 1894, when it became more rapid. Nasiii stands upon a slight elevation^ overlooking the river^ and it now contains 118 houses, 2 caravansarais, 2 public baths, 3 mosques, 196 shops—of which 106 are occupied,—and 2 coffee-shops. The houses are nearly all of stone, which is obtained from the ruins of an ancient city, but a few are of brick or mud. The population of about 1,500 souls is mixed and consists of Shushtaris, Dizfulis and Arabs. The importance of Nasiri, which after Muhammareh Town is the chief place on the Karun below Shushtar, depends partly upon its being the chief place in the Ahwaz District and the seat of a Deputy Governor representing the Shaikh of Muhammareh, but still more upon its favourable situation in regard to trade. The run of the ' Malamir, ^ the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamer on the Karun, ends at Nasiri, where she has her berth to the north of the village above the lowest of the rapids ; there is a Persian Customs House a little further down ; and cargoes for the upper Karun are dis- chaiged and conveyed by tram-line to a point a quarter of a mile above Ahwaz Village where they are reshipped^ mostly for Shushtar. The tramway is owned by the Mu'm-ut-Tujjar, a well known Persian merchant, and the rate charged on it for the conveyance of goods between Nasiii and Ahwaz is 3 Qrans per ton. The English firm of Lynch 4 s nasiri •• ^ ■u or nasiei (bandar) • • or uu- n A siri- YEH 4ai1362 NASIRI NASIEJ- YAH QADHA Brothers are tlie principal European traders; besides there are a Dutch and an Armenian merchant. There is a weekly letter post, managed by the Persian Post Office, to Shushtar and Muhammareh ; and Nasiri is connected by telegraph with those places and with Ramuz. A ferry having 1 small boat affords communication with the opposite bank of the Karun. Nasiri is the starting point of the Ahwaz -Isfahan road, which traverses the Bakhtiyari country and is the line followed by a steadily increasing caravan trade. About 100 mules and 40 or 50 donkeys, belonging either to the place itself or to Ahwaz Village, are obtainable at Nasiri; but the camels used on the Bakhtiyari road are all from the Isfahan District. Fuel is chiefly from the jungles on the Diz River. Nasiri is a centre of local trade, and much grain for export changes hands here. A British Vice-Consulate and a Russian Consular Agency are located at Nasiri: the former is situated a short distance inland of the Customs House. jk Ltot 111 mp\ jiiloiliei idiirrm A division of the Muntafik Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish 'Iraq. Pontion and boundaries.-^ Qadha of Nasiriyah is situated on the extreme lower course of the western branch of the Shatt-al -Gharaf, and on the Euphrates both above and below the confluence with it of that branch. The district is surrounded by the Qadhas of Samawah. on the west, Shatrat-al-Muntafik on the north, Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the east; on the south it is bounded by the Shamiyah Desert. Topography and inhabitants.— The only large place in the Qadha is the town of Nasiriyah, but the villages of Azairij and Butaihah may be mentioned as they are the headquarters of Mudirs: the former of these is on or near the right bank of the Euphrates above Nasiriyah Town. The Euphrates and Gharaf rivers are the dominant physical features. The Arabs of the country belong to the Muntafik tribe. Population.—•The fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 53,000 souls, of whom all,—except 1,000 Sunnis and about 1,100 persons o other races and religions who reside in the town of Nasinyah ,-are Shi'ah Arabs. yi|Aa Mm p d dali iksiie ( nW jomNASIRlYAH TOWN 1363 Resources. —The district is moist; and rice^ maize and buffaloes are among the principal assets.

An important municipal town in Turkish 'Iraq, situated on the left NASIRI- bank of the Euphrates about 4 miles above its junction with the western- most channel of the Shatt-al- Gharaf. Site and surroundings. —The town stands on level ground and has a river frontage of half a mile. The date gardens attached to the place end about miles above it, where there is a boat bridge of 25 pon toons, not much used on account of its distance from the town, leading to a suburb of date-plantations and mud huts on the opposite bank; on the lower side of the town the palms extend down the left bank for some hours' journey till they meet those of Suq-ash-Shuyukh. Fopulation. —The town is unwalled but contains, in addition to a greater number of huts on the outskirts, about 6U0 good masonry houses arranged in broad and well-aligned streets. The population is about 10,000 souls, most of whom are Shi^ah Arabs ; but there are ovef 1,000 Sunnis, as well as about 300 Sabians, 300 Persians, 200 Abyssinians, 150 Jews, 50 Turks, 50 Kurds and some 20 Oriental Christians j the Sabians are goldsmiths, carpenters and boat-builders. Nasiriyah is a place of considerable trade, receiving its foreign imports from both Baghdad and Basrah. The chief exports are skins and hides, wheat, barley and ghi: the principal imports are Manchester piece-goods, groceries, spices and drugs. Shops number about 350, and there are 5 Khans for the accommodation of travellers. TOWN .—There is generally some surplus of foodstuffs brought in from the rich grain-producing country around; but transport can only be got from the Arab tribes, and the amount available is impossible to estimate. The position of Nasiriyah near one junction of the Shatt-al- Gharaf with the Euphrates is commercially favourable. Commuiii- 4 B 21364 NASIRlTAH TOWN cation with abroad is mostly by boat, and about 10 large boats are ordinarily obtainable, besides whicb there are a number of local Ballams for crossing the river and for short journeys. Admimstration .'—'NsisiYlyah is the headquarters of the whole Sanjaq of Muntafik, as well as of the Qadha of Nasiriyah in the same. It ig . i'Dmai an outpost in an unsettled country, frequently disturbed in recent years by the rebellions of Sa'adun Pasha, the Muntafik chief, and by the general lawlessness of the local Arabs. The combined functions of civil jfilial Mutasarrif and military commandant are here discharged at the present Lgjlit' time by an officer of the Turkish regular army. The police force consists of 100 to 150 Dhabitiyahs. There is a branch of the Public Debt Department, a post office, and a telegraph office having a single-wire connection with Durraji on the one side and with Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the other. Shipping and river conser- ■ ^ vancy are under the charge of a harbour master. Two Government schools exist, a primary and a secondary. ^|| The Nasiriyah garrison consists nominally of two infantry battalions, ; IcT with a squadron of cavalry and 5 guns of which 2 are muzzle-loading; but the town is nevertheless exposed to incessant nocturnal sniping by ,, rNt Arabs, and the task of defending it falls chiefly on the civil inhabitants, ' ^ who are armed and often exchange as manv as 50 or 60 shots a night ° J Mies on with the raiders. Only about 50 Radifs can be collected here, but the place is the headquarters of the 1st battalion of the 86th Radif regiment. ? There are large blocks of Government buildings comprising civil L yj offices, military barracks, gun-park, hospital and commissariat storehouse. ^ ^ ^ A Naib-Karpardaz or Consular Agent represents the Persian Gov- ^ , ernment here. j ](J •te tieie NIDA- BIYIN Singular Nidabi ^1^. A Ghafiri tribe in the Sultanate of 'Oman, chiefly located in W adi-al -^Aqq where the villages of Lizugh, MiziV Bu Ba'arah, Fankh, Da^asar, and Sinsilah belong to them, and in Wadi :ij| 0 | j,, Saijani where they have Mizra^ and Mizra^-al-Haitani, but found also ^^ at Mahbub, Hassas and Sarur in Wadi Samail and at Jarda in Eastern Hajar. They are not a very large tribe, but their position in Wadi-aVAqq, and Wadi Saijani commands the principal route from Sharqiyah to Matrah and Masqat Town, and their services have frequently been retained by the Sultans of 'Oman to bar the progress ;j j (NIZWA of insurgents from Sharqiyah towards the capital. They number about 3 ; 500 souls : none of them are Bedouins: in religion they are Ibadhis. Their present chief is Salum-bin-Sa^id in Wadi-al-^Aqq. A town of 'Oman Proper in the Sultanate of ■'Oman, the most central of the district, situated at an elevation of 1^900 feet above the sea near the foot of Jabal Akhdhar, some 20 miles west of Izki and about the same east of Bahlah. The place is divided into an 'Alayah or upper town and a Sifalah or lower town, which are separated by Wadi Kalbu; the Alayah is on the east bank and is the further up-stream. The water supply of the 'Alayah depends on a stream called Daris , that of the Sifalah on one called Ghunduq c3^» Another Wadi, Wadi- al-Abyadh traverses the town and joins Wadi Kalbu near the market-place. Date groves succeed one another continuously upon the lower course of the Wadi from Nizwa down to Raddah ; and the number of the palms is estimated at 25^000. The houses of Nizwa are of stone, and many are two storeys high, but the streets are narrow. The fort of Kizwa, in the Sifalah^ is reputed the strongest in 'Oman : it consists of a Hisn or large quadrangular enclosure, in one corner of which stands a huge circular tower or keep, known as the Qal'ah The whole construction rests on a solid base which rises to a considerable height above the level of the plain. The population may be 6,000, and many tribes are represented, especially the Bani Riyam (500 houses), Bani Hina (300 houses), Al Bu Said (250 houses); Bani Rashid (80 houses), 'Awamir of the Aulad Saif section (40 houses), Kunud (40 houses), Hirth (10 houses), Bani Hadhram (10 houses), and Bani Ruwahah (4 houses): besides these there are about 40 houses of mixed tribes including some Bayasirah of the Aulad Subah section. The Bani Riyam are found in the 'Alayah, also called Samad-al-Kindi and their Shaikh in 1902 was one of the principal Shaikhs of the Bani Riyam; he had at that time some influence with the Bani Riyam of Jabal Akhdhar and maintained a blood-feud with His brother, the Shaikh of Tanuf. Indigo is grown at Nizwa, also some sugar and cotton 5 ordinary crops are wheat, barley, millet, maize, peas, beans, sesame and lucerne. Livestock are estimated at 7 horses, 600 camels, 60 donkeys, 150 cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats. There is some indigo-dyeing, and vessels and utensils of copper and brass are manufactured.1366 NIZWA Nizwa is now in the possession of the Sultan of 'Oman, who has a Wali here, and a garrison of 30 men, commanded by an ^Aqid, in the fort. ° Abont |3,000 is collected annually as Zakat, but no balance is remitted to Masqat. The present Sultan (Saiyid Faisal) owns some date groves here as his private property; these have an annual value of |^000 and are at present assigned to the Wali as a contribution toward the public expenditure. Or Nata' or Anta' f M*. A considerable village in the Wadi-al- Miyah tract of the Hasa Sanjaq; it is situated about 50 miles inland, westwards, from the foot of Musallamiyah bay, audit lies approximately 140 miles south by east of Kuwait Town and 160 miles north-north west of Hofuf. It stands in a hollow and is surrounded by hills. The isolated position of Nta/ and the one or two small villages which adjoin it is very remarkable. Nta* is surrounded by a mud wall, 12 feet high and 2 or 3 feet thick, which has small bastions and is pierced by 2 gates, one on the north and the other on the south side of the village. There are about 250 houses,t and the people are Hadhar or settled Arabs belonging to various tribes, among them the 'Ajman, 'Awazim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Eashaidah and Southern Shammar. There are 3 or 4 mosques and a small school; the people are Sunnis. A few date groves, containing about 300 trees, adjoin the place; and wheat, barley, maize and lucerne are grown by irrigation from wells. The water is the best in Wadi-al -Miyah. Livestock include about 5 horses, 30 camels, 150 donkeys and 120 cattle^ besides sheep and goats. The bazaar consists of 10 shops, and artificers such as blacksmiths, carpenters and tailors are to be found in the village; wooden bowls of a special pattern are made here. Some of the inhabitants take part in the pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf in the hot weather. Nta/ is said to have come into existence after, and in consequence of; the destruction of Thaj in the same neighbourhood.

In English formerly known as ' Khore Alladeid.' An inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi Principality at its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles, almost due west, from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet. The Khor consists of a winding channel, 6 miles long, which runs inland in a south-westerly direction ; within it opens out into a lagoon 6 miles long from north-north-east to south-south-west and B miles broad. The lagoon contains soundings of as much as 6 fathoms; but ordinary vessels^ on account of reefs, cannot approach within 3 miles of the entrance of the Khor. A ridge of stony hills, 300 feet high^ on the south side of the entrance, is called Jabal-al-'Odaid; and on the north side of the creek, overlooking it, are sand hills known as N iqa-al-Maharaf, There are now no permanent inhabitants at 'Odaid, and it is not visited by Bedouins from the interior; but fishermen from Abu Dhabi spend some months here in winter, and fine mullet are caught by them. A village occupied by seceders from Abu Dhabi; of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas, has existed at ^Odaid at various times. The village was situated on the south side of the creek at a short distance from the entrance and consisted of about 100 houses: the inhabitants lived by fishing and obtained their drinking water from 4 wells which 'were less than a mile from the place and contained brackish water at 2 fathoms below the surface; they had no dates or cultivation. Prior to 1866 the defences of this village consisted of a fort with two towers^ of 7 other detached towers, and of blockhouses protecting the wells. The settlement was finally abandoned in 1880.

The word 'Oman however is now (and has for a long time been) employed, with a wider but still purely geographical meaning, to designate the whole projecting butt of the Arabian continent which is enclosed between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Ruba'- al-Khali or Great Desert of Southern Arabia. Upon the coast the geographical 'Oman is considered to end north-westwards with the district of Sabakhat Matti, * and southwards somewhere between Ras-al-Hadd and the district of Dhufar. 'Oman in the political sense and its divisions.—Vaz political 'Oman has the same inland boundary, namely, the Ruba'-al-Khali desert, as the geographical; but upon the sea its extent is somewhat greater. On the north-west it is bounded at the coast by Khor-al -'Odaid, and it thus includes the districts of Mijan and 'Aqal which are beyond Sabakhat Matti : on the south it takes in the entire maritime district of Dhufar. The large tract thus constituted is divided chiefly between the 'Omail Sultanate and Trucial 'Oman, oi which the boundaries are more precisely explained in the articles under those names; but there is also a small tract between the two, consisting chiefly of the districts of Jau and Mahadhah, which is not subject to any recognised ruler and may therefore be styled Independent 'Oman. 'OMAN (PR0M0N- TOEY and GULF of) ..tUr The sense in which the term 4 ''Oman Promontory' is used throughout the present Gazetteer may here be explained. It is used to describe that great projection of the Arabian coast of which the point nearly blocks the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and of which the base is a line running from Abu Dhabi Town to the Baraimi Oasis and thence to the town of Sohar. The point and eastern side of the promontory consist of a range of mo untains which are a continuation of those forming the Western Hajar of the ^Oman Sultanate : the western side is flat and open. The political distribution of the promontory is # Some authorities would carry the geographical 'Oman so far as to include the iVTijan tract which lies immediately beyond Sabakhat Matti ; but the nest district on the westj that of 'Aqalj is certain!v outside 'Oman in this sense.'OMAN PROPER 1369 rather complex. The district o£ Ruus-al-Jibal at its extremity is an isolated possession of the 'Oman Sultanate, divided on the eastern face of the promontory from the Batinah district of the Sultanate by the Shamailiyah District of Trucial 'Oman. The whole western face belongs to Trucial ^Oniaii; but in the heart of the promontory, at or near its base, are the Jau and Mah^dhah districts^ which are not subject either to the Sultan or to any of the Trucial Shaikhs of ^Oman. The expression iC Gulf of 'Oman' also requires explanation. In this Gazetteer it is employed, in harmony with general European usage, to denote the arm of the Indian Ocean or Arabian Sea which forms the approach to the Persian Gulf. Its outer limit may be taken as a line joining Gwatar in Persian Makranto Ras-al-Hadd on the Arabian coast; and at the inner end it may be considered to pass into the Persian Gulf in the neighbourhood of Ras Musandam. The terms Bahr 'Oman j and Darya-i-'Oman c/** • isk)* are current locally, but it is not clear that they are consistently used, or that they refer with precision to the sea of which the limits have just been specified. : i - the most central district of the 'Oman Sultanate, enclosed by the OMAlf district of Dhahirah on the west, that of Western Hajar on the north, and that of Sharqiyah on the east; on the south it merges in the Ruba'- PROPER* al-Khali desert.

Both passes are practicable for camels, but the descent from Najd-al-Makharim on the eastern side lies down a rocky torrent-bed and is not easy for loaded animals. Jabal Hamrah appears to run south-eastwards from Najd-al- Makharim, but its direction and extent have not been investigated by any European traveller ; this range is of a terra-cotta colour and may possibly differ in geological structure, as it does in appearance, both from Jabal-al-Kor and Jabal Akhdhar, Valleys, —'Oman Proper possesses two main channels of drainage, WadiKalbu^, and Wadi Halfain, both of which traverse it from north to south, the former from Iftizwa near its centre, the latter from Izki at its eastern extremity. The western part of the district appears to be drained by various Wadis from Jabal-al-Kor which join Wadi Kalbu on its right bank ; one of the principal of these is the Wadi on which Bahlah stands, formed by the junction of Wadi Ghol from Najd-al-Barak and a more southern Wadi called Wadi Shams. Another is Wadi Saifam containing a village of the same name ; it runs south- eastwards from the neighbourhood of Najd-al-Barak, and joins Wadi Kalbu. The subsequent course of Wadi Kalbu is uncertain; but it is believed to fall into Wadi Halfain in the desert. Genera/l configuration, etc. —The surface of ^Oman Proper outside the oases is rough and broken. The central portion, which contains the towns of Bahlah, Nizwa, and Izki but not Manah, is called the Jauf 4 -^, that is the hollow or basin ; it is a stony plain thickly dotted with small volcanic hills and mounds, some of conical shape. The northern part of it in particular, under Jabal Akhdhar, is very barren and is seamed with dry water courses. A wide and level surface with a gentle declivity to the south separates Izki from Manah, and between Manah and Adam again is a smooth, gently descending expanse, uninhabited, but sprinkled with dwarf mimosa and bunches of desert grass and containing bustard, partridges, sandgrouse, gazelle and hares. Looking to the south and east from Adam neither hill nor habitation meets the eye, and the line of the horizon is unbroken as the sea; to the north, in the distance, the grand pile of Jabal Akhdhar towers into the sky.

The whole of Batain from Has Jibsh to Ras Mishayu is low and sandy except a stretch of a few miles to the north of Shaiblah ; towards the south end it is covered with shrnbs and bnshes. Masirah island which lies off this part of the coast is described nnder its own name. The remainder of the coast may be disposed of in six sections corre sponding to its principal divisions which are Barr- al- H ikman; Ghubbat Hashish; Bahr-al-Hadri^ a featureless stretch between Ghnbbat Hashish and Ras Madrakah; Sauqirah bay between ii as Madrakah and Ras Sauqirah; a short stretch between Ras Sauqirah and Ras Sharbatat; and, finally, the large bay which contains the Kuria Muria islands. Each of these we now proceed to describe separately. f 00 Barr-al-Hikmdn. — Parr-al-Hikman so called from being the domain of the Hikman tribe, is a blunt promontory, 18 miles broad and only about VZ miles long, which points south between Masirah channel on the east and Ghubbat Hashish on the west. It is low and sandy and contains a large salt-water lagoon called Khor-al-Milh ^-Ulwhich is divided from the sea only by a narrow ridge of sand : the Hikmail and the inhabitants of Mahot and Masirah island resort to the Khor to ^ and to make salt, and Stir boats also load salt here for Stir and India.. Barr-al-Hikman is covered with scattered bushes of tamarisk and salsola and with tufts of grass and rushes. The U. S. ship 'Peacock^ was wrecked on this coast in September 1835. Ghubbat Hashish. —Ghubbat Hashish ^ i s a l ar g e bay forming the foot of the Gulf of Masirah : it is open to the southward and divides Barr-al-Hikman from the continuation of the coast to the south -westward. The bay is 8 miles wide at the entrance and 10 miles deep, with soundiDgs 4 T 21380 'OMAN (SOUTH-EASTERN COAST OF) decreasing regularly from 6 fathoms in the middle of the entrance. The shore is low, sandy, and desolate throughout. Near the centre of the hay is tt) the small rocky islet of Abh v' frequented by natives for fish-curing. From Abb a mud-bank, which dries at low-water, extends northwards for 3 miles dividing the bay into two parts and then spreads out eastward and westward across the foot of the bay. On this mud-flat, 4 miles north of Abb, stands the island of Mahdt with the village of the same w name; 2 miles west-north-west of Mahot is Raqq Jij , a steep and rocky islet. Thick and sudden fogs are prevalent in the neighbour hood of Ghubbat Hashish during the north-east monsoon. Bahr-al'Hadri.^-HhQ section of the coast from Ghubbat Hashish to Eas Madrakah, called Bahr-al-Hadri , possesses few points of interest. It is distinguished chiefly by the re'-appearance of hills upon the coast; indeed for more than J of its length, towards the southern end, it presents to the sea a line of bold cliffs which are composed of light- coloured limestone. At Has Sarah vlr' ^4 miles south-west of the entrance of Ghubbat Hashish, there is a small village of huts inhabited by the A1 Wahlbah. At Ras Sidarah again, 20 miles south by west of Has Sarab, the existence of a small village of Hikman and A1 WaMbah with a date-grove has been reported. Six miles south- south-east of Ras Sidarah and 3 or 4 miles off-shore is Hamar-an- Nafur a white limestone islet 400 yards long, 300 yards broad and 320 feet high. The summit is flat and split in all directions ; myriads of wild-fowl frequent it and Arabs used formerly to remove the guano for agriculture. From Hamar-an-Nafur to Ras Madrakah is about 53 miles in a due south direction. When approached from seaward, Ras Madrakah, which is 450 feet high^ appears as an island and for this reason, or because of a small island which lies off the point of it, has received the alternative name of Ras Jazirah or Isolette. An outcrop of igneous rock here has greatly disturbed the strata of the prevailing limestone. The coast about Ras Madrakah and for gome miles to the northwards is frequented by Jannabah who have no boats, but put to sea on goat-skin floats and capture sharks, of which they sell the fins and tails. There is a good anchorage* in the south-west monsoon about 1 mile north-west of Ras Madrakah in 5^ fathoms, and good but slightly brackish water can be obtained from a well on the coast about 2| miles to the north-eastwards. # A plan of this anchorage will be found in Chart No, 2369—40 o#♦OMAN (SOUTH-EASTERN dOAST OF) 1381 Sanqifah Bay. —Sauqirah sjly* Bay extends from Ras Madrakah to Ras Sauqirah and is about 102 miles in length, but its maximum depth is only about 26 miles. The coast is barren and inhabited only by a few Janna- bahand Mahras, who come here in the winter months to fish and graze their cattle ; and are too poor, apparently, even to construct huts, for they camp under the sails of their boats. They attack helpless strangers and avoid armed ones, are under no human control, and seem to pass their lives in a chronic state of semi-starvation. The best known locality in Sauqirah bay is Jazir near its south-west end, which is a favourite winter camp ing ground and the only point where the land-route from Dhufar to ^man Proper strikes the coast: water can be obtained by digging in the low ground near the sea. Ras Sauqirah is a prominent bluff cape rising bOO feet above the sea : connected with it is a rocky table-land which forms a background to the greater part of the bay at some miles from the coast. Has Sauqirah to Rds SkarbatdL — From Ras Sauqirah to Ras Sharbatat oUbpi, a distance of 24 miles, the coast presents to the sea a noble lime stone cliff, 600 feet in height, falling precipitously to the water's edge and having a table-land behind its summit. Eds Skarhatdt to Eds Nits. —From Ras Sharbatat to Ras Nus again the coast forms a slight bay, 8*2 miles in extent, which contains the Kuria Muria islands, described elsewhere under their own name, W ith a few intervals the coast in this part also consists of cliffs supporting a table-land 500 to 800 feet high; they are throughout of pale-brown limestone rock except at Ras Shuwamiyah , about the middle of the bay, where there is a remarkable outburst of igneous rock, corresponding doubtless to the Kuria Muria islands which lie opposite it. Ras Qarwao 4 miles west of K as Sharbatat, is a headland nearly insulated by a lake at the inner end of which the water is fresh; a few Jannabah fishermen reside there in caves ; and hares, f oxes ; partridge, plover, duck and widgeon are said to be found near the lagoon. Near the w T est end of the bay are TVadi Raikhut and Hasik Wadi Raikhut is a valley opening on the sea 12 miles north of Ras Nus, where there is a spring of fresh and a lake of brackish water ; it appears to be thickly wooded and well watered, is said to come down from the far interior, and shows signs of violent tor rent action.* Hasik is a miserable village at the mouth of a valley thickly wooded with small trees j it is near the head of a bay of the same name three miles south-east of Wadi Raikhut and ten miles north of Ras Nus. What was once an inlet of the sea is now a marsh contained by a * A sketch of the mouth of this valley will be found in Admiralty Cliait No. 1]»1382 'OMAN (SOUTH-EASTERN COAST OF) sandbar, but there is still a well of brackish water. There are considerable ruins here and tradition relates that the place was once a thriving town • it is said to have been ruined by pirates from the coast of Trucial ^Omail who carried oft the women and children into slavery at the beginning of the 19th century. The present inhabitants are some 15 families of various tribes; they are very poor, subsist almost entirely on fish, and are nearly destitute of clothing. They have about 300 sheep and goats • there are no boats, but vessels from Sur call occasionally. There are cocoanuts here and a few dates. Inhahitants. —As will have been observed there are no places of any importance, except Lashkharah and Mahot, on the whole South -Eastern Coast of 'Oman. Such villages as exist are mostly small and fluctuating, inhabited by migratory fisher-folk who dispose of shark-fins to passing vessels and obtain in exchange the dates, grain and cloth of which they stand in need. Many of these fishermen have no boats, and between Ras- ar-Ruwais and Hasik they commonly put to sea on a float made of a goat or sheep-skin; after this has been inflated they tie the hind and fore legs together with string and sitting on the string with the skin in front of them paddle their way with their hands to the fishing ground. As many as twenty men have been seen to enter the water at once in this manner and proceed two miles out to sea. Exclusive of places belonging to the Ja'alan district the settled population of the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman is extremely small in proportion to its extent. An estimate gives only 1,500 souls, distributed as follows Ras Jibsh to Mishayu, 60 families; Mahdt^ 50 families; Balir-al- Hadri, 40 families; Ras Sharbatat to Ras Nus, 30 families; and Masirah island, 120 families. The Bedouins of the district^ whose number is uncertain, are chiefly Jaimabali 3 A1 WaMbah and 'Awamir. 'OMAN SCTLTAN- ATE* The Sultanate of ''Oman is not, as explained in the article on 'Oman; co-extensive with 'Oman in the geographical sense ; for Trueial 'Oman, the Baraimi Oasis and the Mah^dhah tract, though they belong to 'Oman, are not included among the Sultan's possessions. On the * The matter contained in this article on the 'Oman Sultanate, and in the articles subordinate to it, has for the most part been obtained at first hand expressly for the present Gazetteer. All information regarding the country available in publislied books and inofficial reports was first condensed by the writer into 82 foolscap pages of print,—-a process which was completed in August 1,904.—and the resulting volume was then forwarded to Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and' f142 X / 'OMAN SULTANATE 128S other hand the Gwadar District on the coast of Baluchistan and the Dhufar District on the southern coast of Arabia are under the Sultan s W. Grey, Political A^ent at Masqat, to serve as a basis for fresh inquiries. It was also taken by the writer himself on tour to the Gulf in the cold weather of 1904-05, when, with the assistance of Mr. J. C. Gaskm, at that time holding a political appointment nnder the Gulf Residency, a large quantity of new geographi cal material was collected ; the investigations relating to Euus-al-Jibal were made at Sharjah, those relating to the western parts of Batinah and Hajar at Sohar, and the remainder at the town of Masqat itself, where informants for most parts of the country were easily obtained. Full information regarding Gwadar was kindly supplied in 1905 by Mr. E. Hughes-Buller, I.C.S., in charge of the Imperial Gazetteer of Baluchistan. From his own materials and from those furnis ed by Majors Cox and Grey and by Mr. Hnghes-Buller the writer next prepared a number of draft articles which appeared in January 1906 in the form of 240 octavo pages of print and were sent to the local officers for revision and completion, ihes* latter operations continued throughout the greater part of 1906, the Ruus -al-Jioal district being carefully dealt with by Major Cox, assisted by Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif-bin-'Abdur Rahman, the British Agent at Sharjah, and Gwadar by Mr. H. Whitby Smith, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs ; the Kumzari dialect was care- fully investigated by Captain A. P. Trevor, Assistant Resident; and the very large quantity of matter relating to the other districts was disposed of by Major Grey, who, at the end of 1906, paid a special visit to Dhufar in order to acquaint himself with that part of the country. Major Grey's principal assistants were Yusuf ^tephan, Agency dragoman, and Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Sa'id, son of a late Wazir of the Sultan ot 'Oman. On receipt of the reports of these officeis a revised set of ^ft^extending t about 300 pages, was prepared at Simla and was finished in February 1907 ; but there were still omissions to be supplied and doubts to be solved, and the work of local investigation was not finally brought to an end till November 1907. It will be convenient to mention here the principal authorities to whic may be had for information (on specific points) more detailed than is o e oun t ' ie I^gedogioal matters, besides the Geological Appendix to this Gazetteer, for wh.ch the writer is indebted to Mr. Pilgrim, the following *.11 be found nsefol.

Carter, however, has some interesting Ghara Tribe, 1845, and a continuation of the same, 184,7, which may still be perused with advantage. Turning to geography, we find the literature of that subject reviewed by Colonel Miles in his Memorandum on the Geograp 1879; and Arabia, 1900 by the Rev. S. M. Zwemer contains a short acoount of the 'Oman Sultanate as » whole. The Persian a elf Pilot, 1898, and the Ttei Pilot, 1900, deal completely and systematically with the entire coast and give details relating to navigation with a fulness which would be out of place in a political Gazetteer: the two overlap on the Arabian coa &gt; t between Sur andEas- al-Hadd. More restricted in their scope, but still each relating to irore than one district of the 'Oman Sultanate, are the hooks, articles and reports hy Wellsted, Aucher- Eloy, Ward and others, Cole, Colonel Miles, Captain Dowding and Major Cox which are fpecified and partially analysed in the paragraph on coramunications in the present article: among these are some of the most important contributions which we possess towards a knowledge of the geography of the Sultanate. Whitelock's Descriptive Sketch, 1838,^ and Goldsmid's Telegraph and Travel, 1874, deal partially with the Ruus -al-Jibal district; but more recent and full is a letter by Major Cox (No. 290 of the 2nd July 1902) in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for Novem ber 1902; Burchardt's Ost-Arabien von Basra bis Maslcat, 1906, is useful also, and contains photographs. The Batinah district is described in Pengellej's Eemarh on a Portion of the Eastern Coast of Arabia between Muscat and Sohar\?rt&amp; Stiffe has left an account of Wadi Boshar in his Visit to the Eat Springs of Basher. Carter's Geographical Description of Certain Parts of the South-East Coast of Arabia &gt; 1851, deals with the entire littoral between Masqat Town and the extreme western end of the Dhufar District; while Haines' i/emo^ o/^e South and East Coasts of Arabia covers the same strefcb, except the part between Masqat Town and Sur, which is omitted. The Kuria Muria islands are the subject of more than one monograph, viz., Hnlton's Notice on the Kuria Muria Islands, Whish s Descriptive Sketch of the Island of Jihbleea, Dawson's Geography and Meteorology of the Kuria Mnria Islands, and Buist's Kuria Muria Islands, all of these being papers which appeared between 1840 and 1860. Colonel Miles' Beport on a Visit to Dhofar, 1883, and his Visit of the Political A^ent, Muscat, to Bus Fartak, 1884, are partly concerned with, the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman, the Kuria Muria Islands, eto., and partly with the District of Dliufar ;but Cruttenden s Journal of an Excursion from Morebat to Dyreez, Mr. T. Bent's Exploration of the Frankincense Country and his Land of Frankincense and Myrrh, 1895, and the chapters XVIII to XXI of Mrs. Bent's Southern Arabia, 1900, refer altogether to Dhufar. Trade is dealt with in the annual Administration and Commercial Reports of the Persian Gulf Residencj 7 . The antiquities and ancient geography of the 'Oman Sultanate have not as yet received much attention. Besides Mrs. Bent's already mentioned, it only remains to cite under this heading Carter's Descriptive Account of the Buins of El Balad, 1846, Colonel Miles' Note on Pliny's Geography of the East Coast im, 1878, and Stiffe's Ancient Trading Centres of the Persian Gulf— Maskat, 1897. To this account of the chief sources of information we may subjoin, for the convenience of the student, a list of the most useful maps and charts in which the'OMAN SULTANATE 1385 which is fully dealt with elsewhere under its own name., will be left out of consideration, and our attention will be confined to the Sultan's Arabian possessions. Boimdaries. —The dominions of the Sultan of ^Oman, if taken as comprising not only regions under his direct government but also inde pendent or semi-independent localities where his influence is stronger than that of any other recognised authority, extend along the coast of Arabia from the entrance of the Persian Gulf to the neighbourhood of Kas Sajar opposite Soqotrah, and inland as far as the confines of the Ruba'-al Khali or Great Desert. More precisely, the extreme points on dorainions of tlie Sultan of'Oman appear. The most servicefible map including the whole Sultanate has hitherto been Parts of Arabia and Persia, 1883 ; hut it is now superseded by the map, on the same scale, which is issued with tbe present Gazetteer. Another comprehensive map of the Sultanate is one by Colorel Ross entitled Map of 'Oman showing the Distribution of the Principal Tribes, 1901. Chart No. 2373'-2837 k. oi Persian gives the whole coast from the Ruus-al-Jibal district to Quryat village inclusive ; No. 2369—100. of the North-East Coast of Arabia, partially overlapping the last, extends from Khadhra in Batlnah to Eas Sauqirah on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman ; and No. 2365—1012 of the Arabian ISea, also overlapping its predecessor, reaches from Ras-al-Hadd to Aden. The foregoing are general maps and charts, and we pass now to others which represent smaller tracts, but usually upon a larger scale. The coast and hills of EutiS-al-Jibal are shown in Chart No. 2375—753, Entrance of the Persian Gulf, and those of the Masqat District and Eastern Hajar Coast in Chart No. 2383 - 38, Maskat to Karachi, A Sketch Map showing the Boundary between the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial 'Oman near Murair, 1905, gives some of the topographical details in the vicinity indicated; and a plan known as the- EWVotw ofSohdr, 1905, is sufficiently described by its name ; both of these were prepared for the Gazetteer by Surveyor Jamna Parshad, and they have been filed in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla, as No. 1363 and No. 1362, respectively. Black's Sketch of the Batinah Coast, 1874, shows approximately the positions of all villa ges in that district east of Makhailif. The Indian Survey Sheets Maskat District and Maskat and Matrah, are both the result of surveys undertaken in 1904-05 in connection with the Gazetteer operations. Admiralty Plan No. 2372 2869, Maskat and Al Matra, covers much the same ground as the last mentioned map, but with less attention to detail except upon the sea. The following are of the highest value in connection with tho geography of the interior ; Compass Sketch of part of the Boute taken by Major P. Z. Cox from Abu Dhabi to Maskat, 1902, extending acrossthedistrictsof Dhahirah and 'Oman Proper, the map contained in Well- sted's book Travels in Arabia, 1838, embracing several districts ; and the Sketch Map of the Country round Sur, 1903, covering the part of the Eastern Hajar District between Ja'alan and tbe northern coast.

Between these the Sultan's territory is continuous but for a strip of coast-line which^ extending from Dibah to Khor Kalba on the east side of the 'Oman Promontory, belongs to the Shaikh of Sharjah and is Cvmsequently part of Trucial 'Oman. The Sultan's land frontier on the side towards Baraimi may, to the northwards of the Great Desert, be placed at the watershed between that place and the coast of the Gulf of 'Oman. Divisions, —The country is not regularly parcelled out into adminis trative districts, but it falls naturally into several distinct tracts which have recognised names. The chief physical feature is a range of mountains or hilly tract which commencing at Has Musandam, the entrance of the Persian Gulf, sweeps round in a curve parallel to the coast to terminate in the vicinity of Ras-al-Hadd, the point which divides the Gulf of 'Oman from the Indian Ocean. From Ras Musandam to Dibah this tract is called RllUS -al-Jibal ; the remainder is known as the Hajar of 'Oman. Hajar attains its maximum altitude of nearly 10,000 feet in Jabal Akhdhar, a group of lofty mountains to the south-west of Masqat Town, and immediately beyond Jabal Akhdhar it is cut across by the great Wadi Samail, which thus divides it into Western and Eastern Hajar. RuiiS -al-Jibal and the two parts of Hajar in themselves constitute three territorial divisions; and between Western Hajar and the sea is enclosed a long and narrow but populous maritime district, known as Batinah. From Western Hajar a number of valleys descend across Batinah to the sea, most of which are thickly inhabited in their upper courses. Immediately east of Wadi Samail the mountains of Hajar reach down towards the coast in confused masses ; and beyond this again, almost as far as Ras-al-Hadd, the range actually skirts the sea. The intricate country immediately behind Masqat Town has no comprehensive name; part of it is called Saih Hatat and the whole of it is described in this Gazetteer under the title of Masqat District. The valleys of Eastern are not so numei'ous, nor, with the notable exceptions of Wadi Tayin^ Wadi Samail and their tributaries, * genefally so populous as those of Western Hajar. _ * It appears advisable to include Wadi Satnail and its affluents in Eastern Hajar inasmuch as the area which it drains is chiefly (n its east side.'OMAN SULTANATE 1387 The districts on the coast being concluded we turn next to those of the interior. Behind Batinah and divided from it by Western Hajar lie the two inland districts of Dhahirall and 'Oman Proper. Of these DhaMrah, which is to the west, slopes inwards to the Ruba'-al-Khali desert ; while 'Oman Proper, the physical centre of the whole country, surrounded except on the south-east by hills and situated from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea, discharges its drainage towards the Indian Ocean. Inland of Eastern Hajar are the districts of Sharqiyah and Ja'alan, which also belong to the oceanic side of the watershed and unite their wateis with those of 'Oman Proper. Sharqiyall adjoins 'Oman Proper, while Ja'alan touches the south-eastern corner of Sharqiyah at one end and the Indian Ocean at the other. The desolate coastal tract from Ras-al-Hadd to Eas Nus has no general name and may simply be called the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman: off it lie Masirah and the Knria Muria islands. Beyond Has Nus is the district of Dhufar, consisting of a maritime plain and of the crescent of the Samhan hills whose horns reach the sea upon either side of the plain. Physical geography. —-The orography of ; Oman has been noticed above in distributing the country into districts, and the subject of geology is fully dealt with elsewhere.* The rocks consist mostly of limestone which in places is metamorphic, but the town of Masqat is the centre of a remarkable outcrop of volcanic serpentine that extends for 10 miles along the coastand igneous rock occurs also in the neighbourhood of Stir, in parts of the interior, and at various points on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman. The only mineral is coal, of which a small field exists about 20 miles south of Sur; deposits of silver and copper are said to exist in the neighbourhood of Samad^ but they are not now worked. Clayey soil, merging into sand at the coast, is found in Batinah. * 9 Dhahirahis a mixture of clay and gravel; Oman Proper has a stony surface; Sharqiyah and Ja'alan tend to sandiness; the Hajar districts are rocky and mountainous; Ruus-al-Jibal consists entirely of lugged and precipitous hills. Springs and streams abound in the hilly districts and Ja'alan; but in Batinah the supply of water depends entirely on wells, and wells are found to some extent in Oman Proper and Sharqiyah. Many of the springs of ^Oman have a high temperatuie. The two largest valleys of ^Oman are Wadi Samail and Wadi Halfain which rise on opposite sides of the same pass. W adi Samail * See Appendix on Geology.1388 ♦OMAN SULTANATE reaches the Gulf of 'Oman at Sib; it is a main seat of population and date culture and the chief highway between coast and interior. The course of Wadi Halfain is southwards ; it carries the drainage of all the inland districts except Dhahirah to the Indian Ocean at Mahot and is the longest valley in all ^Oman. Climate. —The summer heat of ^Oman is intense and the average rainfall scanty; but in the interior, in winter, cold and wet weather is sometimes encountered. Occasionally violent storms accompanied by floods devastate the country. The climate of the sea-coast is relaxing and oppressive except in the coldest months. The ordinary annual rain fall over the country generally is probably between 3 and 6 inches. Wild flora and fauna, —The natural vegetation of the country is sparse and stunted, and wood of large growth is not found even in the highest hills. Mimosa, acacia, tamarisk and ber are among the commonest trees. Grass is not abundant. Fauna are correspondingly poor. The wild mammals of the country include the Masqat gazelle or Dhabi, common all over 'Oman in suitable localities; the Marica gazelle or Rim, which is rare except on the edge of the Ruba'-al -Khali; the Beatrix Oryx or Bansolah, which is brought in by nomads from the desert; Jayakar's wild goat—a kind of Tahr — in Arabic called Wa'al ; also a lynx of which the species is doubtful. There are besides hares, jackals and foxes; the existence of leopards has not been established. Among the birds are the bustard [Houhara Macqueeni), grey partridge, francolin, sisi, sandgrouse and quail. Agricultural products, —Cultivated trees and crops are more plentiful and varied than vegetation of natural growth. The principal tree and staple of agriculture is the date, of which some very fine varieties are grown; it flourishes eyerywhere, even in almost inaccessible valleys among the hills and at a height of over 2,000 feet; the extensive date plantations are a striking feature of the landscape, especially in Batinah, Wadi Samail and Sharqiyah. Other fruit trees more or less common are the plantain, mango, pomegranate, quince, sweet and bitter lime, olive and almond ; and the walnut, fig, vine and mulberry flourish in Jabal Akhdhar. Cereals are wheat, barley, maize, millet and bajri ; other crops are musk melons, water melons, lucerne, cotton, sugarcane and, in places, indigo and tobacco. Domestic animals. —Camels are n umerous in Sharqiyah and Batiuah and donkeys in Hajar and elsewhere, but horses are everywhere few.'OMAN SULTANATE 1389 The dromedaries o£ 'Oman are esteemed tlie best in Arabia. Cattle, sheep and goats are found everywhere, the sheep being most common in the hilly tracts and in the possession of Bedouins but less numerous than the goats. The cattle are of the humped Indian variety. On the coast livestock are largely fed on fish heads boiled up with date stones, remnants of mat bags and other refuse. Inhabitants and tribes. —The great majority of the inhabitants of ; Oman are of Arab race and, with regard to their main characteristics, may be described as a homogeneous population. Supposed racial divisions. —According to their traditions* they belong to two distinct Arabian stocks, the Qahtani JM*** or Yamani and the 'Adnani or Nizari but this belief has not as yet been scientifically verified. The Yamani tribes, according to the same tradi tions, were the first Arab settlers in 'Oman ; while the Nizaris, whose pedi gree is regarded as less purely Arab, were for the most part later immi- grants. Each of the supposed racial groups is divided into a large number of separate tribes, and these again into sections and sub-sections. Politic a I divisions. —In the 18th century there arose, in the course of a cu general civil war, two large factions known as the Hinawiyah and U) the Ghafiriyah t to one or other of which almost every Arab tribe found in 'Oman at the present day is attached. The Hinawi faction consists chiefly of Yamani, and the Ghafiri faction mainly of Nizari tribes ; but there is a residue both of Yamanis and Nizaris who have joined the faction of their hereditary rivals, and transfers of allegiance from one faction to the other even now occasionally take place. Throughout the length and breadth of Oman the Hinawiyah and Ghafiriyah live intermingled, usually in groups of villages belonging to one tribe or section, and thus the political balance of power is maintained j but on the whole the Ghafiriyah are predomi nant in the north-western and the Hinawiyah m the south-eastern regions. Fixed and nomadic population. —Another broad division of the people is into settled or Hadhi'j^-^ and nomad or Badu^J ; but this * That is to say, traditions which must have been current among the literati w'th whom Colonel Eoss and Colonel Miles dealt. The ordinary 'Omani knows nothing now of the terms Qahtani and 'Adnani or Yamani and Nizari. -i • t These are the collective plurals ; the singulars are Hinawi and Ghafiri whidh are also the forms of the adjectm*.1390 'OMAN SULTANATE diBtinction has no racial or political basis^ either condition of life being adopted indifferently by the Hinawiyah and the Ghafiriyah. The Bedouin element is relatively strong in 'Oman Proper and Dhahirah^ and generally upon the verge of the desert; in the other districts the settled populations are completely predominant. Tribal constitution. —Tribal organisation is loose and haphazard. Some of the tribes are scattered territorially and have no local centre ; while others^ though their domains are compact, are broken up into sections headed by chiefs who acknowledge no common authority. In a few cases the tribe is governed by a Tamimah or president whose power extends over all the branches of the tribe, wherever domiciled; the office of Tamimah is nominally elective, but in practice hereditary. Formerly each of the great political factions had also a Tamimah, the headship of the Ghafiriyah being vested in a Dhahirah family and that of the Hinawiyah in the ruling Sultan of the house of the Al Bu Sa'ld, As a rule small and weak tribes attach themselves as clients to more powerful neighbours, but they retain their names and separate existence. Armament. —The tribesmen of some of the larger towns, especially at Sur and in Ja'alan, are now well armed with modern rifles, mostly Martinis of inferior patterns. In other parts, such as Eastern Ha jar, arms of precision are still comparatively scarce. Religiont—K great majority of the Hinawi tribes belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam, whose tenets were adopted as the national 'Omani form of faith in the 8th century of the Christian era. Of their Ghafiri opponents a considerable proportion are orthodox Sunnis, and a few tribes are Wahhabi, notably the Bani Bu 'Ali and the Bani Rasib who were converted at the time of the Wahhabi invasions early in the 19th century; but the dominant sect in ^Oman is still the Ibadhi. The short- u) lived character of occasional Mutawwa' or puritanic movements that have taken place in 'Oman seems to demonstrate the absence of a fanatical spirit among the people. Non-Arab population. —The Arabs compose seven-eighths or more of the population; the residue consists partly of aboriginal tribes and partly of immigrants whose arrival was later than that of the Arabs. Among the aborigines may perhaps be classed the Bani Na'ab, part of the Shihuh; the Zatut and possibly some of the Bayasirah. The later immigrants are represented by colonies of Persians,—-in part relics of'OMAN SULTANATE 1391 Persian occupations;—in the neighbourhood o£ Sohar and elsewhere; by Baluchis and JadgalS; the former now very numerous^ who were originally introduced as mercenary troops ; and by considerable Indian communities in the town of Masqat and Mat rah. Nor must the large negro element which exists along the coast be overlooked; an outcome of several centuries of the slave-trade. Character and language. —The chief characteristics of the people of- ; Oman are impatience of control; strong factional and tribal feeling; unprogressiveness in the social and material aspects of life. Their settle ments in East Africa however show them to have been; in the past; not devoid of enterprise of a kind. Arabic is the language of the country as a whole; but the dialect of the Shibiih is peculiar; and the Kumazirah section of that tribe have in addition a language of their own which belongs to the Iranian group. Baluchi may be heard in 'Oman among the Baluchis and Swahlli where negroes are numerous. The Qaras of Dhufar have a language of their own. Classification and distribution hy factions and tribes, —The following is a conspectus of the tribes of the Sultanate of 'Oman; arranged under the heads of Ghafiri and Hinawi:— /.— Ghdfiri Tribes.

Ibadhis.1412 'OMAN SULTANATE The tribal tables contained in the preceding paragraph yield the following statistics, of population^ both sedentary and nomadic : — Ghafiris . » . . . 205,540 Hinawis . . » . . 220,820 Others 60,000 Total . 486,360 souls. A scrutiny in detail of these tribal tables will show, however, that the number of Bedouins in the Sultanate cannot be less than 30,000 souls, and as regards settled population the estimate by districts (which includes negroes) is probably more reliable than that by tribes. We may therefore conclude that the total population of the 'Oman Sultanate is not less than 500,000 souls, of whom at least 30,000 are Bedouins. Occupations and mode of life, —The greater part of the fixed population of 'Oman live by agriculture, of which date cultivation is the commonest form. Cultivation, whether of date trees or of other crops, is dependent on irrigation. In the hills and where springs exist the water is brought to the field by a carefully constructed channel, sometimes subterranean and in that case called a Falaj : an open channel is called Saqiyah Where irrigation is from wells, as in Batinah, the water is raised in leathern hoists, as in some parts of India. On the sea-coast agriculture is supplemented or replaced by fishery, and inland by the keeping of flocks and herds. In Batinah, where the fisheries are important, the nets are sometimes a mile long and form the principal possession of the village. The fishermen of ^Oman ply their business along the coast of Makran at certain seasons.* The livelihood of the inhabitants of Masqat and Matrah is excep tional, depending upon the presence of the Sultanas government and on foreign commerce : Sur and Khaburah also are ports of which sea- borne trade is the mainstay. In some of the larger inland towns part of the population live by letail trade or by simple industries and manufactures : such are indigo dyeing at Nizwa and Ibri, copper and brasswork to an insignificant extent at Nizwa, pottery at Nakhl, and the weaving of cloth, turbans, and lungis in other places. Masqat Town is renowned for its gold and silver wor , especially the sheaths and mounting of daggers and swords; the woi - men are Indians. . Local trade and trade between the coast and the interior maintain a carrier class ; Maqniyat in Dhahirah, for instance, is a place wh subsists largely by the earnings of its do nkey and camel owners, * ISoe Appendix on Fisheries.;7ry : 'OMAN SULTANATE 14i^ The Bedouins are altogether pastoral' in their habits, depending for a livelihood on their camels and flocks. In hilly districts and their vicinity the houses are generally of stone and mud, but in some of the Sharqiyah towns, as also in Masqat and Matrah, the better houses are of stone plastered with gypsum stucco. Where stone is not easily obtainable sun-dried brick often takes its place; but throughout Batinah and in part of Sharqiyah light sheds of date branches and mats are the commonest form of domestic arehitee- ture. Beef is little eaten by the people, and fish is an important article of diet even in the interior. Trade. The trade of 'Oman which is described in full detail in the article on Masqat Town, is chiefly with India ; and its character is by no means complicated. The only valuable export is dates, of which the better sorts go to America and most of the remainder to India. The Fard ■y date, a small dark-coloured sort grown in the Samail valley, enjoys high favour in America and the supply of it is never equal to the demand of the market: the Americans have lately been endeavouring to acclimatise it in Arizona, but as yet without much success. Another date called Mibsali preferred by natives of 'Oman to the Pard date and much appreciated in India, is grown in Sharqiyah and exported through Sfir to Bombay j a third kind is the Khalas Exports of secondary importance are pearls, mother-of-pearl, dried limes, fresh fruit and salt fish all of which go chiefly to India. Before 1906 — 1907, in which year it rose to lis. 36,93,830, the recent average value of the exports from Masqat, the only steam port of the 'Oman Sultanate, was about B/S. 26 ; 84,000 per annum. By far the most valuable import received in return for these exports is rice from India, and after rice come arms and ammunition, consigned direct from Europe : but this is not unlikely to prove an ephemeral traffic, for the arms market in 'Oman itself is said to be already glutted and the extinction of the arms trade through Masqat with other countries is an object of the British Government. Next are cotton goods, Indian, Manchester and American, mostly (except the American) imported through Bombay. The American cotton is a time-honoured import which shows no sign of increasing at the expense of the other kinds. Twist and yarn, silk and silk goods, sugar, coftee, and cereals other than noe are the chief remaining imports. Timber, except date trunks, is all brought from India and Africa. The foreign trade is largely in the1414 'OMAN SULTANATE hands of Indian mercliants resident at Masqat and Matrah the latter being 1 the real commercial capital,—but there are also some wealthy Arab merchants. The annual value of the imports at Masqat appears, of late, to have been about Rs. 48,17,000, but in 1906-1907 it rose to Bs. 69,21,375. The trade of ^Oman is limited, not so much by insecurity^ bad communications and the difficulty of recovering debts in the interior, though these are not without their effect, as by the natural poverty of the country and the limited purchasing power of the inhabitants. The only valuable asset is the date crop, which is liable to be severely affected by drought. The carrying trade of ''Oman is small and practically confined to Sur ; the only other ports of any account are Wudam and Sur Haiyan in Batinah with about 15 and 40 sea-going vessels, respectively, Suwaiq with 10^ and Matrah with about 7. Weights and measures vary somewhat from place to place.* The standard of currency everywhere is the Maria Theresa dollar or Eiyal, but the Indian rupee also circulates. Accounts are kept in Muhammadis, an imaginary unit of which 11J are equal to one dollar. Subsidiary coinage consists of copper pice, partly imported from India, Zanzibar and German East Africa, and partly minted by the Sultan at Masqat or for him in London. During 1904, the value of 100 dollars fluctuated between 126 and 139 rupees and the number of copper Masqat pice to the dollar varied from 320 to 270. In 1906-1907 the dollar exchange fluctuated between 15If and U'Sf. This instability of the silver exchange occasions many shipments of specie between Masqat and Bombay and is unfavourable to general trade. Communications. —There are three principal routes which conduct from the coast to the interior of the ; Oman Sultanate, namely, one from Matrah or Sib by Wadi Samail to 'Oman Proper, which is central and the most important of all; one on the east from Stir to Ja'alan by Wadi Falaij ; and one on the west from Sohar to Baraimi by Wadi-al -Jizi. The chief lateral communications in the interior are a line from Ja'alan which traverses Sharqiyah to 'Oman Propel 4 , connecting ^ the Wadi Falaij and Wadi Samail routes, and two from Baraimi aci-oss : ** See however tlie article on Masqat Town. Here it may be added that the Kiy§s of the interior is only | of the Masqat Kiyas, and the same holds of the Man. In the interior there is a weight called Sa' (plural ) equal to 7f KiySs, and another called Makiyal JtxC* (plural Makail equal to 12 Kiyas or \ a Man.'W: 'OMAN SULTANATE 1415 }l 1' Dhahirah into &gt; 0lliail Proper, one vid Najd-al-Makharlm, the other Najd-al-Barak, joining the route from the coast by Wadi-al -Jizi with that by Wadi Samail. These are all easily passable for loaded camels and present no difficulties as to water, while other supplies also are abundant on the Samail route. Subsidiary routes in Western Hajar are that from Batinall to Dhahirah by Wadi^al -Hawasinah and that from Batinah by Wadi Bani KhaiUS and over Jabal Akhdhar into ^Oinail Proper! the first is passable by camels, the second only by donkeys. Parallel routes to the interior are said to lie between these up Wadi Bani Grhafir and Wadi Jara, and to be practicable for camels, but neither of them has been ns&amp;l in its entirety by a European traveller. Minor routes in Eastern Hajar lead from Wadi Samail, or from Saih Hatat by the Qahza pass, into Wadi Mansah and thence into Wadi Tayin ; these can be used by camels. Two other routes, over the ^Amdah and Manqal passes respectively, give access from Saih Hatat to Wadi Tayin, but they are more difficult than those aheady described. There is also a camel route down Wadi Tayin from its head to the sea at Daghmar j and one or two routes exist between Wadi Tayin and Sharqiyah, the best known being that which runs up Wadi Khabbah from Grhubrat-at-Tam, but their character is not well ascertained. There is also a route, in favour with natives of the country, which connects Wadi Samail with Sharqiyah by way of Wadi-al -^Aqq. Ja'alan is easily accessible from Khor Jaramah by a route that crosses Jabal KhamiS into Wadi Falaij*. # Some notion of the character of these routes can be gained from the articles on the districts or valleys in which they lie and the mountains which they cross» some of which are specified in the text in the following sentence.

Eoutes from Barkah and Masna'ah to Rustaq converge at Jammah iii WadiFara' and thence ascend Wadi Para' to Rustaq. The distances from Barkah and Masna'ah, respectively, are 10 and 6 hours by caravan, 2. A route from Suwaiq. to Rustaq. reaches Wushail in Wadi Para' and thence follows Wadi Fara' to Rustaci. Distance 8 hours by caravan. 3. A route from Masna'ah to Dhank lies up Wadi Bani Ghaflr from Dihas to Ehafdi; it then reaches Miskin, in Wadi-al -Kabir. From Miskin, there are alter native ways to Dhank, one via 'Aridh in Wadi-al -Kabir and Yanqul in Wadi Dhank, the other via Khadal in Wadi-al-Jailah and Fida in Wadi Dhank. Dis tance to Miskin 10 hours by caravan (apparently underestimated), and thence by the alternative ways 12 and 24 hours, respectively. 4. A route from Suwaiq to Dhank follows Wadi Bani G-hafir from Hoqain to Khafdi and beyond that point is identical;with the last route. Total distance 30 hours by caravan. 5. A route from Khaburahto 'Ibri follows Wadi-al -Hawasinah from Ghaizain to Mijzi, whence Miskin in Wadi-al -Kabir is reached ; from Miskin it continues down Wadi -al-Kabir to Dariz and so to 'Ibri. Total distance 24 hours by caravan. 6. A route from Khaburah joins the ordinary Wadi -al-Jizi route from Suhar to Baraimi at Sahailah in Wadi-al -Jizi. Distance from KhSburah to Sahailah 12 hours by caravan. 7. There is a route from Saham to Yanqul which goes by Falaj-ash-Shakbariyin and Wuqbah in Wadi 'Ahin. Distance 18 hours by caravan. 8. The way from Yanqul to 'Ibri is via 'Aridh in Wadi-al -Kabir, down that Wadi to Dariz, and so to 'Ibri. Distance 9 hours by caravan^1418 'OMAN SULTANATE Navigation and Tiarloun. —Tlie navigation o£ tlie'Oman coasts is simple, and hidden dangers are few; bnt there is an almost entire deficiency of harbours and safe anchorages. The Elphinstone (Khor- ash -Sharn) and Malcolm (Ghubbat Ghazirah) Inlets and Dohat Haffah in RuuS -al-Jibal would make good harbours, but their position in a wild and barren district renders them commercially valueless. There is not a single sheltered anchorage for vessels on the whole Batinah coast. The coast of the Masqat District possesses the best anchorages in ^Oman, viz., the bays of Matrah and Masqat and the inlets of Bandar Jissah and Bandar Khairan; but the first two are imperfectly sheltered, and the others are badly situated with regard to internal communications. From Bandar Khairan south-eastwards there is no sheltered anchorage till the Sur, Khor Jaramah and Khor-al -Hajar creeks are reached near Ras-al-Hadd; the first and third of these are only accessible to native boats, and the second, though well-sheltered, cannot be entered by vessels of more than 15 feet draft. The South- Eastern Coast of 'Oman is poor in good anchorages • indeed, excluding Ghubbat Hashish, the approaches to which are not free from danger and an indifferent anchorage at Ras Madrakah, there are none until the complementary harbours of Murbat and Kisut in the Dhufar District are reached* 'Political constitution. government of i Oman is a Sultanate or absolute monarchy, and the manner in which the present hereditary Sultanate has arisen out of an ancient elective Imamate will appear from the chapter on the history of 'Oman in the first volume of this Gazet teer. The title of Imam is inapplicable to the present ruler, who has From the map it would seem that some of the distances have been underestimated or that a very high rate of travel has been assumed. The following itinerary has been furnished by the Rev. Mr. Cantine of Masqat; the hours represent about 2^ miles each Matrah to Ghubrah in the Masqat District, 4 hours ; Ghubrah toMisfahiu Wadi Boshar, 5hours: Misfah to Bidbid in Wadi Samail, 5| hours; Bidbid to Sartlr in the same, 2^ hours; Sarur to Hisn Samail in the same, 3^ hours ; Hisn SamS-'il to Fanjah in the same—apparently by Wadi Dhaba'un , 6 hours, Faniah to Buwah, 4 hours; Buwah to Lajal in Wadi Lajal, 3? horns ; Lajal to Nakhl, 3^ hours ; Nakhl to Ghubrat Pani Ruwahah in Wadi Mistal, 5 houis , Ghubrat Bani Buwahah to Hijar in the same, 5 hours; Hijar by Ghubrat Bam Ruwahah to Ibai in Wadi Ma'awal, 8 hours; Ibai to Barkah on t e Batinah coast, 7 hours ; Barkah to Sib on the same, 6 hours ; Sib to Matrah, 8 hours. , It is understood that nearly all tba routes enumerated are passable by came s an that sufficient water and grazing are available by the way.'OMAN SULTANATE never qualified for th-e semi-religious dignity of the Imamate, and he is commonly mentioned as the Saiyid. The term is not free from ambiguity however, for each member of the ruling family is also a Saiyid, though not the Saiyid; and'the term Sultan, though possibly a British invention, * appears to be coming into general use in the capital and its vicinity. General administration.—The government of ' Oman is without system or efficiency, and outside the districts of Masqat and Batinah the Sultan's authority is either precarious or merely nominal. The Sultan is represented at a number of points by executive officials styled Walis, who exercise their powers, according to the will of their master, to the extent which the means at their disposal permit ; and there are, at some less important places, minor civil or military officials who receive their orders from the Wali nearest them. The town of Masqat is ruled by the Sultan personally, but at Matrah there is a Wali, the only official of that rank m the Masqat or head-quarters district. In Batinah there are Walis at Sib, Barkah, Masna'ah, Suwaiq, Khahurah and Sohar; and the Wali of Sohar, whose charge is in some respects the most highly or- ganised in the Sultanate, is assisted by deputy-Walis at Saham, Liwa and Shinas, each of whom is responsible for a defined district and for certain specified villages. In the Hajar hills the Sultan has Walis at Nakhl and Hisn Samail and outposts in charge of minor officials at 'Awahi, Bidbid, Mizahit, Hibi, Haiyadh, and Burj-ash-Shikairi • the last three are subject to the Wali of Sohar and the others to the Wali of Samail. In the Rustaq portion of Western Hajar there exists what is practically an imperium inimperio, held by a distant relation of the Sultan over whom he has no real control. On the coast of Eastern Hajar there are Walis at Quryat and Sur and a post at Hadd under the Wah of Sur ; but the position of the Sur Wali is extremely ifiicult, and at present he is to a large extent merely a spectator of events^ (1905). 'Araqi, close to 'Ibri, is the seat of a Wali and the k-ultan g only post in DhaMrah. In 'Oman Proper the Sultan has Walis at Izki and Nizwa besides a post at Manah under the Wali of Nizwa, but his position in this district is insecure and implies no real control. - In the detached district of B uus-al-Jibal, where his authority the I | Brliisl '' may havc had !ts ris e in a misapprehension, the personal name of Com* i at . the time ot . the fir8t two treaties between Masqat and the East India Faisafv t been Sai ' yid Salt5D - 1(1 is uoteirorthy that on the pice minted by 'OmsJ''u- 0r t0 hk 0rder, he is Var!onsly described as « Iman of Masqat and » Sultan of Masqat and 'Oman ' and 44 Sultan of , Omau. ,,1420 'OMAN SULTANATE is recognised rather than felt, the Sultan has a Wali at Khasab ; and in the still more remote district o£ Dhufar, where Masqat rule is tolerated by the inhabitants rather than actively enforced by the Sultan, His Highness is represented at the present time by a substitute Wali with his head-quarters at Hisn, by a garrison at Murbat and by small detachments in other places. In Sharqiyah and Ja'alan the Sultan has no official agents of any sort, and, though the Shaikhs profess allegiance to the Sultan of 'Oman, their attitude towards the present ruler makes it impossible to regard them otherwise than as semi-independent. The South-Eastern Coast of ''Omail between Ja'alan and Dhufar is valueless and its existence is ignored in the Sultan's administrative arrangements. Gwadar is a Waliship, and in the town and its environs the authority of the Wali is complete. Further particulars about the Sultan's ' posts are given in the para graph on military forces below. Criminal and civil Justice. —Criminal justice is dispensed in the name of the Sultan only in places which fall within the jurisdiction of his Walis. The most heinous cases, as of murder or extreme personal violence, are, if the culprit can be arrested, sent to the Sultan for disposal along with the witnesses of the crime ; and a person convicted by the Sultan of murder is frequently put to death by the same means as he employed to destroy his victim. Minor offences are tried by the W alis who are supposed to report their decisions to the Sultan: in these reparation to the person injured is usually exacted or, failing reparation, a term of imprisonment is awarded. The procedure is on the whole in accordance with Muhammadan law, but the requirements of the Quran are not always strictly complied with. Outside the juris dictions of the Walis there is no justice apart from the settlements which local Shaikhs are able and inclined to arrange on the basis of Arab customs of compensation and retaliation. Tribesmen are never surrendered to the Sultan by the tribal authorities as criminals for punishment. Questions of civil right are adjudicated on by Qadhis in the same manner as in other Muhammadan countries. Finance. —The sea customs, here called' Ushur, , are the principal source of revenue in the Sultanate of Oman ; import duty is levied on all goods at the rate of 6 per cent, ad the maximum permitted by treaty. At all principal ports the customs'OMAN SULTANATE 1421 are now under direct management instead of being farmed^ as formerly; payment of duty is accepted either in cash or in kind; and in the latter case the goods taken are generally sold by auction. Subsidiary sources of income are the Zakat and Bait-al-Mai JUI ^ j • but these terms, unless in the interior, are not employed in the strict Quranic sense. At places on the coast Zakat, instead of signifying the impost authorised by Muhammadan law on agricultural produce and moveable property, denotes a virtual export duty which, though not fixed by treaty, is permitted by the British Government to be taken at the rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem in lieu of Zakat proper; this concession has been made on account of the inability of the Sultan to collect the Zakat in the up-country localities where it becomes due. On the seaboard Bait-al-Mal'means not the public revenue from all sources, but the rent of shops and other property owned by the State. It will be seen from the table given in the next paragraph, which is based upon inquiries made in 1906-07, that import duties and real and so- called Zakat produce together a gross revenue of $429,000, but that of this amount only $290,700 or about Rs. 4,00,000 actually reaches the central treasury at Masqat j the remainder is absorbed in administrative, expenditure at the places where the collections are made. The Bait-al-Mal brings in about $500 a year at Masqat Town and |750 at Matrah, and the total proceeds of this tax are thus about Es. 1,750. In addition to the revenues of ^Oman the Sultan receives from the British Government a subsidy of which the origin is explained in the history of^Oman; its amount is at present Us. 7,200 per mensem. The net annual public income of ^Oman from all sources is thus about— Rs. from customs and Zakat •••.*» 4,00 3 000 from Bait-al-Mal r . . . . . 1,750 from the British subsidy ,..»*♦ 86,400 or Es. 4,88,150 As we shall presently see, this is supplemented to a slight extent out of the Sultanas private estate. The expenditure of the Sultan is even more difficult to estimate than his revenue; it is certain however that his normal position is one of financial embarrassment. His personal expenses are small, but large sums are spent in placating discontented tribes of the interior and in supporting a multitude of parasites in his entourage ; consequently he finds it difficult to make both ends meet. The Sultan is in the habit of1422 'OMAN SULTANATE forestalling his customs receipts by overdrawing on his customs officials, who are thus compelled to obtain advances from local merchants in anticipation of duty payable in the future.

When an efiort that is more than merely defensive is required it can only be arranged by subsidising tribal levies, a method which experience has shown to be as ineffectual as it is expensive. The Sultan's soldiers or Askaris are partly foreign mercenaries; about 25 per cent, are Hadhramautis and 5 per cent. Baluchis, and these are the most reliable part of his force j but in some districts, as in Dhufar, they are altogether locally recrmtcd and are consequently not to be depended on. The Askaris are without training and have no organisation unless by sections ot about 20 men, each of which is supposed to be commanded by a sort ot non-commissioned officer called an 'Aqid ^ . Every regular fort is in charge of a military commandant called a Jama'dar , In the more important stations the 'Askaris are armed with breech-loading rifles. e Sultan has a number of old muzzle-loading guns, but not more than one or two of these are capable of being moved.

Foreign interests. —Foreign interests in the 'Oman Sultanate, whether political or commercial, are predominantly British, and Britain is the only power represented by a Consul or Political Agent.

Valuable though early authorities on the country are Whitelock's Account of ^ the Arabs, etc., and his Description of the Arabian Coast, 1836-38, the former of lii' ® 1 which is occupied largely with the subject of population. Trade, as it was in 1863,and U questions of local resources, taxation, etc., are fully dealt with by Pelly in his Report |0l)| on the Tribes, etc., around the Shores of the Persian Gulf, 1863, in which some older , statistics for 1826 and 1831 are also quoted. Eecent topographical and other infer- i 18 * mation regarding the interior is due almost entirely to Major P. Z. Cox, among whose communications the following are important: his Notes to accomvany Slcetch Map of ^ Route ... from Abu Thabi to Mashat in the Proceedings of the Government of India ' in the Foreign Department for December 1903 (relating to the route between Abu Dhabi Town and the Baraimi Oasis) ; his letter No. 290 of the 2nd July 1902 in njlmk Foreign Department Proceedings for November 1902, (relating to the Shamailiyah ^ ^ district) ; and the eiidosure to his letter No. 1800 of the 5th August 1906, as Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary in the Foreign Department to the Government! W 111181 of India (describing the route from E-as-al-Khaimall Town to the Baraimi Oasis). jTpoti The only other modern account of any part of the country at a distance from the coast will be found in the Rev. S. M. Zwemer's Three Journeys in Northern Oman, 1902; but a recent description of places on the coast, accompanied by photographs, is given by Burchardt in his Ost-Arabien von Basra bis Masqat, 1906. The Annual Administration and Commercial Reports of the Persian Gulf Residency yy are the principal source of information in regard to trade. The map which accompanies this Gazetteer is the most useful, for general purposes, of Trucial 'Oman ; its predecessor in this respect was that known as Parts of Arabia fltprii and Persia, 1883, on the same scale. Smaller portions of the region are shown on a larger scale in the Boute of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Bisbrowe ... and Captain | _ 'Walter Powell... from Dihba in the Indian Ocean to Pas-el-Khymah in the Persian s. Gulf, 1865, and in the Bovte taken by Major P. Z. Cox and Lieutenant C. A. Scott, B.I.M., from Bas-al-Khaima to Sohar via Beraimi, 1905 ; the former of these is map No. 1366 in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla, and the latter was reproduced by the Survey of India in 1907. A Map of Dhafrah, Liwah,^ etc., 1906, compiled by Major Cox from native information, gives the topography o ^ ^ that tract so far as it couid be ascertained and is filed as map No. 1367 in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla; and one by Captain F.

Among the subjects of the 'Oman Sultanate the whole is ki own as Shamal either on account of its position with reference to their own country or because of its exposure to the north-west wind ; and in Eastern Arabia, further to the northward^ the part adjoining A bu Dhabi Town seems to be spoken of as'Oman-ash-Shamall because it is the northernmost part of ^Oman ; but neither of these terms is in common use among the inhabitants of the regions which they used to describe. The nearest approach to a recognised general designation is apparently Sahil ^Oman uU* l UU or Coast of 'Oman ; but this expression, though not unknown to the people of the country, is wanting in precision and distinctiveness and is far from being universally understood. In English official literature a part of the shore line has long been familiar under the name of u The Pirate Coast but the term is not sufficiently comprehensive, and, at the present day, is obsolete and even misleading, inasmuch as the state of affairs which it once accurately connoted has long since passed away. Regard being had to a perpetual maritime truce which regulates the relations of the rulers to one another and to the British Government the pentarchy in question may be styled, not inappropriately, Trucial 'Oman* ; but it must be remembered that the trucial obligations of the Shaikhs do not extend to the interior of their dominions. The component principalities of Trucial 'Oman are fully described elsewhere under their own names ; and the function of the present article is accordingly to correlate them, to describe the country and its inhabitants as a whole, and to dispose of certain matters (such as com munications) which could not be dealt with piecemeal under the names of the separate principalities. to Khor Fakkan on the eastern, and that from Sha'am to Dibai on the Trestern side of the 'Oman Promontory. Of the coast between Abu Dhabi To'.vn and the island of Yas the best delineation will be found in a Triqonometrical Survey of the Arabian or southern side of the Fersian Gulf from Ahothuhhee to Zabooi Island, 1824; this was apparently once a chart numbered 19B, but it seems to have teen withdrawn. A small sketch of Fart of Khor-al^Batin was prepared by Coromander G. Sinclair, R.T.M., in 1906 for the information of the writer, and is now ^ap No. 1364 in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla. ^This name was suggested by Captain P. B. Prideaux, and in the absence of any other, either Arabic or English, it appears to be the most convenient, the most des- cnptive, and generally the most suitable for adoption. 4 y 21428 'OMAN (TRTJCIAIi) P' [ ?# —Upon the coast, Trueial ? Oman extends in the Gulf of 'Oman from Khor Kalba to Dibah, and in the Persian Gnlf from Sha'am to Khor-al-'Odaid, the places named being all included in it; in other words its boundary between these two sets of points is the sea. ^ ]je} Inland, its frontiers are more difficult to define ; but it covers a consi- derable portion of the interior of the 'Oman Promontory. On one side j, there it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai'ah on the east coabt to Ras Sha'am on the west coast, and so divides it from the RuiiS -al-Jibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate to the north • on another by a line, even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor ' ^ g Kalba and Murair and, after partially crossing the promontory in such ^ a way as to exclude the MaMdhah and JaU districts to the south, is J ^ eventually lost in Khatam. Westwards of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial 'Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba'-al-Khali and J Jafurah deserts. I Physical divisions.—■he&amp;vmg out of consideration for the present the artificial political divisions of Trucial 'Oman, we find that it consists Jiirjal of a maritime belt (or Taff oilo ) and islands; of inland plains ; and of a mountain system : these we now proceed to describe. jkofisb Maritime features and islands of Trucial 3 Oman. —The eastern coast—that washed by the Gulf of 'Oman—is bold, somewhat re- sembling the coast of Suus-al-Jibal, and the hills in places come down to the water's edge. The western coast—-that within the Persian Gulf—is low and monotonous. In the north the latter is diversified by occasional date groves, especially by those of the Sir tract between Rams and Eas-al-Khaimah Town, but as the coast trends away to south and west trees languish, and at Aba Dhabi they cea^e altogether. The ^ hills, too, which near Ras-al-Khaimah. Town form a pleasing baciv- ground, rapidly recede inland and are soon lost to view from seaward as the coast is followed to the south-west. Silt-water creeks abound on this coast, and the lagoons at Ras-al-Khaimah Town and near the town of Abu Dhabi have a considerable superficies; yet there are no ^ ^ inlets of real importance. The creeks sometimes unite inland to form ^ backwaters and mangrove swamps, which are separated by a short , ^ distance only from the coast; and quasi-islands, sometimes inhabited and sometimes not, are created in this manner. The best known instances ^ 0? such islands are Qurmah between Rams and Ras-al-Khailtta^; P ^ nam %arefo'OMAN (TRUCIAL) 1429 Jazirat-al -Hamra ; the Siniyah island, formed by Khor-al -Baidhah near Umrn-al -Qaiwain; Zora ; the not altogether insulated site common to the village of Khan and to the Laiyah suburb of Sharjah Town ; and, last but not least, the tract of country in which stands the town of Abu Dhabi. Beyond Abu Dhabi, as far as Khor -aVOdaid, the coast is almost unknown; it is barren and generally low, but has some bluff headlands. The only eminence and conspicuous landmark on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, Dhafrah being excluded, is Jabal-al-^Ali in Dibai territory. In the Gulf of ; 0man the sea is deep at no great distance from shore. In the Persian Gulf, from Sha^am to Abu Dhabi it is open and free from dangers but rather shallow ; here the coast lies open to the full fury of the Shamal, there are no harbours or sheltered anchorages except for boats, and landing is often difficult. From Abu Dhabi to Khor -aVOdaid the coast is adjoined by a labyrinth of islands, shoals and reefs, irnperfecfcly surveyed and so intricate that even Arab vessels, if larger than pearl boats, avoid these waters. In this direction most of the space between the coast and the 20 fathom line,—-which runs approximately from opposite Sharjah Town to the tip of the Qatar peninsula,—is occupied by pearl banks. Full details of these banks are given in the Appendix on the Pearl Fisheries. A number of islands are associated with the coast of Trucial 'Oman, the most important being Bu M US a, Tunb, Sir Bu Na'air, Yas and Dalmahj the last of these is adjoined by a number of others which are eaumerated in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, and by Shura/awah. Inland plain of Trucial 9 0 mans —The interior of a country so ex tensive naturally varies in character from one part to another, but, atten tion being for the moment confined to the non-mountainous portions, the variations are found to be less considerable than might have been expected. Almost the whole consists of sandy desert ; uncultivable but not altogether destitute of natural vegetation or even of wood ; the principal exceptions to the general infertility are the Jiri plain, the plain of Dhaid and the Liwah division of the Dhafrah tract, in all of which some cultivation, at least of dates, is carried on. These relatively small districts are fully described in the articles under the names indicated, and it is unnecessary to enter here upon the exceptional features which they present. Another tract of a different nature, which has no general name and which it is consequently impossible to make1430 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) the subject of an article^ is described below in the paragraph on the ^ j topography o£ Tmcial ^Oman. The only remaining portion of the : 8 ^ country is that which lies between the sea and an imaginary line joining ' irt ^ Eas-al-Khaimah Town to the Baraiml Oasis: it ends southwards in : , the district of Khatam which is elsewhere described under its own name. ^ 1 So far as can be ascertained this portion, from Ras-al-Khaimah as far south as Dibai Town, is not entirely composed of sand dunes, but contains also level shingly plains with sparse acacia vegetation; iM southwards from Dibai the whole surface appears to be sandy and : ^ undulating, but deserb vegetation and wells and water holes are still 01 sufficiently plentiful to support a scanty Bedouin population. In the iff 1 ' 611 whole of this region no running water is found except in one subterranean J8^ ^ aqueduct which irrigates the settlement of Falai; but there are numerous wells, sunk generally on the banks or in the beds of dry watercourses, jtilseemst and sometimes in spots which from their elevated position might have been supposed unsuitable for the purpose. On the Ras-al-Khaimah- igjlmora Baraimi route these wells are generally from 40 to 60 feet deep and soul are lined for 8 or 10 feet near the surface with timber or rough-hewn .,^1 stones brought from the hills. ilfflil Acacias, which are the commonest kind of tree, are of the Grhaf and ^ 1( Samr varieties j the Ashkar shrub, the Markh bush, and grass of the kind called Arfca are frequently met with ; and the dwarf tamarisk, the wild castor oil plant, and a bulbous grass called Qufa are also found. Other sorts of vegetation which afford grazing are Rimth, a species of ^ Salsola which, when green, is eaten by camels ; Halam, a small sand ^ ^ plant; Thamam, a coarse grass which eventually dries up into twigs , and becomes inedible ; and Qasad, a small vivid green shrub of the caper tribe ; the last three are eaten by livestock of all kinds. There is also a ^ bright green edible weed, somewhat resembling mignonette, which is ^ ^ called Haram. Eills of Trucid 'Omdn.^he, only mountainous part of the country is in the east, where a section of the spinal range of the ; 0inan Promon- k k tory is included : this section is the part between a line joining Dibah 1 to Sha'am on the north, and another, on the south, which runs inland from Khor Kalba, first westwards then southwards, so as to curve ^siona round the northern and western sides of the MaheLdhah tract and the hills connected with it. The hill tract of Trucial 'Oman is thus about 50 miles in extent from north to south, and its average breadth seems to tttnb ( be about 20 miles. It is still almost entirely unexplored, the only part ^ Am'OMAN (TRUOIAL) 1431 of it as yefc traversed by Europeans bein^ that which lies on the direct route; through Wadi-al -Qaliddi^ between Dibah and Ras-al -Khaimall; and even of this part no account appears to be extant. As seen from the west, from the Ras-al -Khaimah-Baraimi route, the mountains appear to be disposed in three more or less parallel ridges running from north to south : of these the westernmost terminates at a bill called Qumr J** immediately behind the village of Adhan ; and the second ridge, after curving slightly westwards, seems to continue the interrupted line of the first. The third or easternmost ridge contains the highest peaks and probably overlooks the Gulf of 'Oman : one of these high peaks, situated apparently 12 to 15 miles east of Adhan, is said to be named Jabal Sa'ta . It is possible, however, that these three ridges are apparent only, and that the hill system is more complex than from the west it seems to be. As Adhan in the Jiri plain is considered to be a village of Wadi Ham, it may be inferred that this valley pierces the whole mass of mountains from side to side and even conveys part of the drainage of the south end of the Jiri plain to the Gulf of ^Oman at Fujairah ; but it has not been found possible to locate with certainty the true head of Wadi Ham ; in any case, however, its average direction appears to be from north-west to south-east, and not from west to east as has hitherto been generally supposed. Wadi-al -Qor, further south than Wadi Ham, is the only other considerable valley that comes down to the sea from the hills of Trucial 'Oman on their eastern side. The drainage from the western slope of the hills never, apparently, reaches the Persian Gulf, but is swallowed up by the intervening sands. Climate. —The climate of Trucial ^Oman in winter is pleasantly cool by day and cold at night, but frost is unknown : on the coast, in the same season, the weather is often boisterous. Between May and October the climate is excessively hot and trying; and during the worst of the heat, that is from May to September, travellers journey by night as much as possible. The rainfall is scanty and is believed to average about 5 inches a year. Most of the rain is received in midwinter, but there are also occasional showers in spring. Population and tribes.' —The people of Trucial ^Oman belong to numerous distinct tribes; indeed, the country is tribally one of the most composite and perplexing in the Persian Gulf. The comprehensive Joasmee tribe, assumed by some writers, has no real existence. Only1432 'OMAN (TRUOlAL) the members of the family of the Shaikh of Sharjah, numbering at the present day about 20 adult males, are Qawasim (Jawasim) by blood • and the use of the name to denote all subjects of the Sharjah Shaikh though partially sanctioned by local practice, is really incorrect. The following is a synopsis of the principal tribes of Trucial 'Oman Tribe. 'Abadilah iJoUc 'Ali (Al) ^ JT 'Amim(AlBu) 'Awamir Singular. 'Awgnat Baharinah Dahailat Dabaminab 'Abduli. 'Aliyi. w' .

This tribe is now prac tically extinct; and, according to some, those who remain are not genuine 'Awanat. Some say | that the 'Awanat ' were slaves of the Qawasim; others that they were con- g nected with the y Maqabil. See article Bahari nah. By some regarded as a section of the Al Bu Mahair.

Maliarizah Mahairizi. &lt;£3^° 250 Masafi and Taiyi- bab in \V adi Ham.

They own about 10 camels and 150 sheep and goats ; but they also cultivate a little, and some of their number are semi- settled. See article Qawasim. See article Bani Qitab. There is also a singu lar Shahyari. The Shahairah are consid ered to be aborigi nal. The Bani Shamaili are said to have been originally Jews {sic), but now they are closely connected with the SMhuh and may almost be regarded as a section of that tribe, though not included in either of its 2 main divisions. They are also called Shamaliyin A few of them who are noma dic are found among the SMimh in the Rutis-al- Jibal district of the * Oman Sul tanate.

Besides the foregoing there are about 1,400 Baluchis at l)ibai Town, Ghallah and Ras-al-Khaimah; 194' Hindus at Abu Dhabi, Dibai; Umm-al-Qaiwain and Sharjah Towns; 214 Khojahs or other Indian'OMAN (TRUOIAL) 1437 Muhammadans at Dibai, Has-al -Khaimah and Sharjah Towns; and Persians, some Arabicised and some not, abont 2,400 at Abu Dhabi and Dibai Towns, Khor Fakkan and Ghallah. Negro slaves are exceptionally numerous in the coast towns, but no separate estimate of them is possible and they may be taken as included in our tables among the Arabs to whom they belong. The Indians are not domiciled nor accompanied by their families. Here it may be useful to mention that the Bayadir j JOUj found in Sir, at Dibah, and elsewhere e.g., at Khasab in Ruus-al-Jibal, are not a tribe but a class,w the class namely of the agricultural labourer to whatever tribe he may belong. The singular of the name is Baidar • The total number of Bedouins in Trucial ; Oman may be estimated in accordance with the table above at about 8,000 souls. In respect of settled population, however, the table is not exhaustive, and recourse must be had to the articles upon the principalities, from which it will appear that the figures are : — Principality.

Qaiwain (Umm-al- Sharjah Total for Trucial 'Oman Settled inhabitants. 750 11,000 10,250 5,000 45.000 72,000 By far the strongest numerically of the settled tribes are the Bani Yas, whose Bedouins also are the most numerous of any except the Bani Qitab. Next after the Bani Yas there rank, in point of numbers among the settled tribes, first the Sharqiyin and Al 'Ali, and then the A1 Bu Mahair and the Sudan. Political and religious distinctions. —Like the people of the ■'Oman Sultanate those of Trucial 'Oman are divided between the Hinawi and Gbafiri political factions, but Ghafiriyah greatly predominate, the Bani Yas and the Shihuh alone being Hinawi j and, whereas in the Sultanate the Hinawlyah are mostly Ibadhis and the Ghafiriyah mostly Sunnis by religion, here the Hinawiyah are all Sunnis of the Maliki school while the Ghafiriyah are virtual Wahhabis. The Wahhabiism of Trucial 'Oman is not now, however, of the militant order; it is generally described as Sunniism of the orthodox school of Ibn Hanbal, and it even Qonnives at the private consumption of tobacco, though not as yet at the1438 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) public sale of the same. Modern rifles are widely distributed among the people in both town and country. Character, life and language.— people of the western coast, at least those of the more northern parts, have shown themselves in the past a bold and energetic race. By their piratical exploits at the beginning of the 9th century they gained, under the misleading name of ' Joasmees/' a permanent place in history; and they played a large part in the politics of the Persian Coasts especially of Qishm island, and in those of Bahrain and the 'Oman Sultanate. At the present day they lead a quiet and unobtrusive existence, but doubtless the old qualities are latent in them still. The well-to-do classes on the coast of Trucial 'Oman have three meals ca) a day; the first, called Fakk-ar-Riq , ^ or 'Loosening of the Spittle, - ' is a kind of breakfast and consists sometimes of pancakes made of eggs, rice flour and sugar ; the other two meals, at noon and evening, comprise rice with fish or meat, accompanied by dates and thin cakes of white bread. Coffee is drunk several times a day. Virtually the whole free population is Arab, and Arabic is almost the only language spoken. Swahili, however, survives among negro slaves of the full blood. Occupations and resources, —Pearl diving is, since the suppression of piracy, the principal and almost the sole occupation of the maritime population. In summer most of the able-bodied men, to the number of more than 2 2,0 CO, are absent at the pearl banks; and the coast towns and villages are left to a great extent unprotected and deserted. The number of pearl boats in Trucial 'Oman is approximately 1,215, carrying on the average crews of about 18 men each: they are distributed as follows : — Principality. Number of boats. 'Ajman 40 Dhabi (Aba) Dibai Qaiwain (Umm'al-) Sharjah 410 335 70 360 In winter some of the pearl diving class take part in the ordinary sea fisheries, but the majority of them spend the season at home in idleness, supported by boat owners and contractors who thereby acquire, under the stringent rules of the industry, an indefeasible lien on their services for the next pearling season. A few of the seafaring class are employed on the cargo vessels mentioned in the paragraph on shipping below. FishrTro) 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) 1439 are everywhere plentiful and excellent, and turtle are caught upon the islands.* The settled population who do not live by the sea are herdsmen and agriculturists : to this class belong 1 most of the non-nomads of the interior and of the eastern side of the ^Oman Promontory. The agricultural capabilities of the country are^ however, very limited; and cereals, such as wheat and jowari, are grown only in a few favoured localities such as Sir and the Shamailiyah. district. Dates flourish in most places; but on the west coast south of Ras-al-Kliaimah. Town they never fully ripen, for want of water, and are eaten fresh. Vegetables are raised at most places by means of well irrigation. Livestock are chiefly camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, and there is plenty of poultry; but horses are few in consequence of the difficulty of feeding them ; the last are kept on barley and desert grass, with occasionally a little lucerne, which in places is grown among the date groves. The Bedouins depend chiefly on their livestock for subsistence, but some of them take part in the pearl fisheries. In winter, when the weather is cool and grazing abundant, they are scattered far and wide in small parties ; but, as water and pasture become scarce with the approach of summer, they congregate in larger bodies around the more copious wells in the less inhospitable parts of the country. Favourite Bedouin summer resorts of this kind are the Jiri plain in the north and Bainunah in the west. They own many camels and a number of donkeys; but the latter are used only for work in the neighbourhood of the camps, and not for long caravan journeys. Foreign trade, ~ Commercial statistics are available only for the larger towns on the western side of the 'Oman Promontory, and so much of the foreign trade of the country as is carried on from the Shamailiyah coast escapes observation: the amount of this trade is probably inconsiderable, bat the fact of its non-inclusion should be borne in mind. Scrutiny or the trade statistics shows how artificial is the existence of the larger coast settlements of Trucial 'Oman and how entirely dependent they are on the proceeds of the pearl fishery for the means of purchasing the ordinary necessaries of life, which they do not themselves produce. Pearls are the only export of any magnitude, and the average annual value of those sent abroad (almost entirely to India) during the last seven years has been 67 lakhs of rupees : the second export in value is that of mother-of-pearl shell, worth only J of a lakh of rupees per annum. Dibai is now the chief pearl mart of the Persian Gulf after Bahrain and * See Appendix on Fisheries,1440 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) occupies in this respect the place formerly held by Lingeh ; it has also eupplanted Lingeh as the distributing' centre for imported goods on the Arabian coast between Rutis-al-Jibal and Qatar. The following are the chief imports with the average annual value of each during the past septennium (in lakhs of rupees) : — grain and pulse, chiefly from Persia and India, J; cotton piece-goods, from India, 4; dates and date juice, mostly from Turkish 'Iraq, 3 ; coffee, from India, 2|; miscellaneous provisions, from Persia, 2 ; and sugar, from or through India, 1J. Considerable amounts of specie also pass in both directions. In face of the facts it does not seem unreasonable to hold that all sources of profit here are subsidiary to pearl diving, and that if the pearl banks were to fail this coast would shortly be depopulated. Shipping. —Dibai is the only steam port of Trucial 'Oman. Ten years ago Dibai was almost unvisited by European vessels, but in 1905-06 the number of steamers calling had risen to 34, all British, with a tonnage of 70,132; the progress of the place is a consequence of the decline of Lingeh. The number of native sailing vessels, — other than pearl boats, coasters and fishing boats, — owned in the ports of Trucial 'Oman is about 90, distributed as follows :— Bidyah . . . .10 Dhabi (Abu) Town . - 10 Dibai Town . . .20 Takkan (Khor) • . • o Ghallah .... 10 Kliaimah (Eas-al-) Town . 15 Qaiwain (Umm-al-) Town . 1 Rams 1 and Sharjah Town . , ; 18 The majority appear to be Sambuks, but a proportion of them are Baghlahs, and there are some jollyboats and Badans : these vessels are chiefly employed in running to India and ports of the Persian Gulf for supplies. The statistics of pearl boats are given in the Appendix on the pearl fisheries. Fishing boats not also used as pearlers appear to be roughly equal in number to pearl boats, but they are often extremely small. Jazirat-al -Hamra and Sha'am, though they have no large vessels, possess some coasters of a useful size. Internal trade and manufactures. —Inland traffic is petty and is chiefly with the Bedouin tribes ; but Sharjah, Dibai and Abu Dhabi divide with Sohar Town in the 'Oman Sultanate the trade, such as it is, of the Baraimi Oasis. Local manufactures are few and none of them are exported. Fine sheep wool 'Abas are made at Sharjah Town, and daggers at Eas-al- Khaimah. A certain number of sailing vessels are built, chiefly at(~7yh 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) 1441 Umm-al-Qaiwain; the average numbers launched annually are about 20 at that place ; 10 at Dibai and 5 at Sharjah Town. Topography. —The topography of nearly the whole of Trucial ^Oman is explained in the articles on the five principalities of which it consists, and in the various subsidiary articles to which clues are given in the articles on the principalities. Some additional facts may be learned from the paragraph on communications which follows below. It only remains to deal in this place with the topography of a small land locked tract which does not apparently belong to any one of the princi palities in particular, and which has no general name; the centre of this tract is approximately the Madam plain which lies about 40 miles inland, south-eastwards, from Sharjah Town. The principal points of the tract in question are as follow * : — Name. 'Aiydh m 'Aaaij (Eamlat) Dhakhar faijah (Jabal) Position.

Communications, —The principal routes of Tracial ^Oman may be divided into three groups^ viz., (1) those which lead across the , Oman Pro- niontoiy from the Persian Gnlf to the Gulf of 'Oman, (2) those which 4 z ^U44 'OMAN (TRUCIAL) connect the western coast of the 'Oman Promontory with the Barahni Oasis, and (3) those which run westwards through Dhafrah, providing access from the eastern parts of Trucial 'Oman and from the Barai- mi Oasis to Qatar and the Hasa Sanjaq.. We proceed to deal with them in the above order. l{o). Route from Bas-al-Khaimah .D«W.*—The places first passed are Falaiyah, Hail and Khatt in Sir, which are reached at 6, 7 and 14 miles, respectively, from Ra-al -Khaimall Town. About 1J miles beyond Khatt the hills of the 'Oman Promontory are entered; and from this point the way lies up Wadi-al -Qaliddi to a pass near Muhtarqah village ; the chief points passed between Khatt and Muhtarqah are given as Labanah , Saram ^, and Tuwiyain , which are watering places, and the village of Ya'akal. From the pass near Muhtarqah, which is about half way from Khatt to Dibah and has good water, the route descends towards Dibah; and at five miles short of that place it emerges from the hills, continuing for the rest of the way over a plain grown with brushwood. The journey was performed (in the reverse direction to that described) by Colonel Disbrowe and Captain Powell in 1865, apparently in eight stages, but most of these were extremely short. The direct distance between the termini seems to be less than 26 miles, but the actual distance is probably about 40 : the general direction is, rouglily, from west-north-west to east-south-east. 1(5) Route from'Vmm-al-Qatwain Fujairah\-^ route runs across the desert by the wells of Muwaih .Ghara and TJmm-an- iVao -hul JjiiJI r 1 to the inland village of Falaj Al 'Ah (or Falai), which is a'dependency of Umm -al-Qaiwain and 16 miles distant, son h-east- wards, from the same. From Falaj Al 'Ali it continues 8 I south-eastwards, to the Muraqqibat wells in the v-nity o Dhaid then enters the hills, passes by Siji, and drops xnto Wadi Ham wh oh follows down to Fujairah. This route is said to present no d^s to camel transport: its length, were it straight, would be ^ 60 ^ but in consequence of windings it is probably a good deal more tha The average direction is nearly south-east. *^ M aoWto.-Partly Major P.

From Dhaid it runs to the wells of Wushah, and thereafter it enters Wadi-al-Qor, which it descends to Murair. It is asserted by native informants that Wadi-al -Qor has easy gradients and could probably be made practicable for wheeled traffic witnout great difficulty, but the statement must be treated with reserve. The distance direct from Sharjah Town to Murair is under 70 miles, but by road it mnst be considerably more. The general direction is about south-east by east. The part of this route beyond Dhaid may be used also !by travellers from Hamriyah and Umm-al -Qaiwain, those from Hamriyah making direct for Dhaid (35 miles) by the wells of Sirrah and Rafi-'ah &lt;u ; j, . and those from Umm-al -Qaiwain following route No. 1(4) above as far as Falaj A1 'Ali and then diverging to Dhaid (9 miles from Falaj Al'Ali). l(^).

It then falls into Wadi Hatta which it follows down to Shinas. The actual distance in travelling must exceed by a good deal the distance in a straight line—which is a little over 80 miles—between the extreme points. The average direction is south-east bj east. Travellers from Sharjah Town to Shinas may also avail themselves of this route, joining it at Ghattah or at lahfar-al-Faiyah. 2(«).

Just beyond Fahlain the Jiri plain is entered and the route follows its western edge, the sand dunes of the desert being close upon the right, by the wells of Bu Ya'ilanat]4, and those of Hamranlyah at 16 miles. The distance is 18 miles by road, and the direction is on the average south by west. The route continues to follow the western margin of the Jiri plain and passes the wells of Sa'adi at 5 miles.

Water for this halt is taken from Wushah. The distance to the traveller is 18 miles, and the direction nearly due south. The Qallah Mahafidh plateau is traversed tor 3 miles; the hollow containing the Hamdah well is then crossed ; and at 12 miles the well of Yahfar-al-Faiyah is reached. Throughout this naarch, after Qailah Mahafidh is left behind, Jabal Faijah is upon the right at one or two miles distance, and the path winds over a well- wooded sandy plain. An alternative halting place to Musaifi is Yidaiwi, also in the Madam plain but 6 miles further to the south-west. The actual distance is 19 miles and the general direction is nearly due south. The route crosses between 10 and 12 miles a projecting tongue of the western sand desert. At 14 miles it falls into Wftdi Samaini in which it continues almost until the halting place is reached. The distance by road is 16 miles and the average direc tion of the track, which is crooked, is a little to the west of south.

The route runs at first more west than south along Wadi Misakin, just before leaving which the Misakin well on the right is passed : for the next 4 miles it lies over the gentle sandy undulations of the Batin-al-'OTan and the direction is southerly. After this it wanders for 7 miles in the difficult sandy desert of Kamlat Kahal. Mas- 'udi is the first settlement passed after dropping from the high sand-dune tract into the Baraimi Oasia. The total distance from Ras-al -Khaimah Town to J imi by this route is 125 miles, and tlie journey is generally performed by caravans in 6 to 8 days. There is no well-worn track, and no two caravans follow exactly the same course. Camel transport is the only kind used in travelling by this line; for donkeys—the only other beast of burden available cannot, when laden ; negotiate the sandy tracts that have to be crossed on the way. The wells along the route are generally from 40 to 60 feet deep and are lined for the uppermost 8 or 10 feet with timbers or rough hewn stone from the hills : the water is invariably raised by means oi: a leathei bucket which is hauled by a rope over a pulley, the pulley being suspended from a trestle over the well mouth.

Stages named Habal and Muwaih Arnab ^ , slightly more to the south, may be substituted for those of Suq Iblis and Nahshilah. The track from Maqta ' to Baraimi lies over a desert of sand dunes, and there is almost no grazing by the way.

There is no tixed route between Baraimi or Trucial 'Oman and the Hasa Sanjaq, and different caravans follow different lines of wells across Dhafrah and the tracts beyond it, A straighter and more inland course is apparently preferred by travellers in winter; while those who make the journey in summer generally take a route less direct but nearer to the coast. SiW, Sakak and the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa seem to be among the usual halting places in either season.

Political position) foreign relations and foreign interests. —The political position of Trucial 'Oman in regard to Great Britain is difficult to define with exactitude; it is regulated in the main by two agreements, each of which has been signed by, and is individually binding upon, the five Shaikhs of 'Ajmaii, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm al-Qaiwain and Sharjah. The earlier in date of these agreements is a perpetual truce, concluded in 1853, which provided for the entire cessation of hostilities at sea among the signatories, and imposed on the British Government the duty of enforcing peace and obtaining reparation for maritime aggressions commit ted in contravention of the arrangement. It is in virtue of this treaty that the Shaikhs of the principalities are styled Trucial Shaikhs and that their country may appropriately be styled Trucial 'Oman. By the second treaty, signed in 1892, the Trucial Shaikhs bound themselves not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with a power other than the British Government; not to permit, without the absent of the British Government, the residence within their territories of the agent of any other government; and not to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give. for occup.atiQn. any part of tteir. territories- save to. the E^&amp;isb.

'Oqair stands on the south-western shore of a bay* which runs inland north-north-westwards for about 4 miles. The point round which the bay turns in taking this peculiar course—almost parallel to the coast outside it— is Eas Saiya Lu, , a low sandy promontory covered with scrub; the entrance to the bay, on the south of this cape, is 200 or 300 yards wide. The entrance channel and part of the bay inside are 3 to 4 fathoms deep; but the sea without is shallower, in places, and dangerous for ships. The only buildings at 'Oqair are a fort and a large Khan or caravan- sarai which closely adjoin one another. The fort is an old dilapidated building with bastions at the corners. The Khan is a spacious enclosure 150 yards long by 80 broad; it consists of a wall 16 feet high which has sheds on 3 of the inner sides with a parapet of 81 feet above them: the entrances to the enclosure are in the centres of the front and rear faces. The Khan contains 3 shops, and all travellers passing through ; Oqair lodge in it. The ordinary water supply of the place is from sand pits at a spot called Abu Zahmul a short distance south-west of the fort; if better water is required it is fetched from the wells of Suwad in Biyadh (VI). The civil population of ''Oqair consists of a customs Mudir, who lives in the fort ; and of a few petty Turkish officials, including a Eais-al- Liman or harbourmaster, and some agents of merchants in the Hasa Oasis, who reside in the Khan. A military detachment which was quartered here as lately as 1897 has been withdrawn, and the garrison now consists of 50 mounted and 20 unmounted Dhabitiyahs. The surrounding Arabs are Bedouins of the Al M or rah, 'Ajmail and Bani Hajir tribes. 'Oqair is the port of the Hasa Oasis and indirectly, to a considerable extent, of Southern Najd as well: the imports are chiefly rice, piece goods, coffee, sugar and hardware. The volume of trade is considerable and it has been estimated that on the average 200 to 300 loaded camels leave 5 Oqair every week for the interior. 'Oqair is the headquarters of a Nahiyah in the Hasa Qadha, The customs of the port are stated to have been leased in 1904-05 for a sum equivalent to £5,148 sterling ; and in the following year a larger amount was obtained. rough plan of the 'Oqair inlet will he found in Douglas's Jowrwey opposite p«*go 5.PEES1AN COAST 1455 The districts of the Persian Coast of the Gulf are described elsewhere, PERSIAN each undei its own name; but the districts are so numerous^ their physical COAST differences though subtly graduated are so considerable, and the adminis- OP THE .— PERSI A * This principal article on the Persian Coast and the numerous related articles GULF* on tne districts, etc., of the same depend mainly upon special investigations made in connection with the present Gazetteer between 1904 and 1907. An abstract of the information at the time available was compiled by the writer in November 1904, amounting to 28 foolscap pages of print, and was circulated to all local officers for further enquiry and report. Want of time prevented the writer, though be visited Bushehr and Bandar 'Abbas on tour in the winter of 1904-05, from personally initiating the new enquiries upon the Persian Coast; consequently the whole of the arrangements for procuring information devolved here from the first upon Major P. Z. Cox, the Political Resident at Busbehr, and upon his subordinate officers. In the operations of 1905-06 the districts north of Bushehr, and also those south of it as far as Dashti, were dealt with by Agha Muhammad Mohsin and Agha Muhammad Khalil, native Persian gentlemen, working under the direct superinten dence of the Residency ; the districts of Shibkuh and Lingeh were disposed of by Khan Sahib Agha Badar-bin-Muhammad Amin, Residency Agent at Lingeh, who also supplied somejnformation regarding the districts of Dashti and Tangistan included in the Bushehr circle ; Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, British Consul at Bandar ^Abbas, reported on Bandar 'Abbas, the districts of Shamil, Minab and Biyaban and the islands of Qishm, etc., which fell within the limits of his political charge ; and Mr. R. W. Lobo of the Indo-European Telegraph Department submitted a monograph on Hanjam. The Lingeh Agent was assisted by Agha Muhammad Khalil. The data obtained were worked up by the writer into draftarticles, which were ready in March 1906 and extended to about 200 printed octavo pages. The revision of the draft by the local officers occupied the remainder of the year 1906, and a personal share was taken in it not only by most of the officers who supplied the original information, but also by Major Cox, the Resident; Captain A.P.Trevor, Assistant Resident; Mr. J. H. Bill, Assistant Resident ; Captain de V. Condon, Residency Surgeon; and Mr. H. Whitby Smith, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs. Lieutenant R. L.^ Birdwood, 2nd Assistant Resident, made a special tour in the Minab and Biyaban districts, on the villages of which he reported m detail; and Mr. G. Grahame, Consul at Shiraz, afforded valuable information m regard to administrative divisions. An improved draft, founded on these further investigations, was finished by the writer early in 1907 and extended to over 250 pages: portions of it were again sent to the Gulf for further correction and completion. The work remaining at this time fell chiefly to Mr. Bill and to Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, who had now succeeded Lieutenant x Shakespear as Consul at Bandar 'Abbas. A list of publications bearing on the districts, islands, etc., of the Persian Coast is given below ; but many useful works are omitted from it—e.^., those of Niebuhr Moner and Binning-in which the author has dealt but slightly with the region In ^stion, or has subordinated geographical topics to others.

Exports by Dr. Colvill on the Persian Coast were forwarded to Government by the Kesident with his letters No. 73 of 31st December 1864 and No. 46 of 4th May 1886. Besides these there are a number of military works on Fersia dealing with the southern districts upon the Gulf, mainly from the military point of view ; such are Lieutenant E. E. Galindo's Record of Two Years' Wanderings in Eastern Persia and Baluchistan, 1890; Captain H. B. Vaughan's Report of a Journey through Persia, 1890 ; and his Reconnaissances in Persia, 1892 ; the Gazetteer of Persia, 1892; Surgeon-Major G. W. Brazier-Creagh's Reconnais sance through Persian Baluchistan and Eastern Persia, 1895; Routes in Persia (with index map), 1898 ; and a Military Report on Southern Persia (with sketches and maps), 1900. The Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898, is the best authority upon the coast and all maritime features. An apparently valuable source of information which came into the writer's hands too late to be utilised in connection with the present Gazetteer is a bulky volume in Persian, descriptive of the entire province of Fars and accompanied by a large scale map : it is entitled Fdrs-Ndmeh-i-Ndsin, was lithographed in 1895, and is the work of Haji Mirza Husain, Fasai. It is probably a good authority for the spelling of names, and it explains by means of village lists the Hdministrative organisation of the province. The subject of trade has hitherto been treated of from year to year in the Persian Gulf Administrative Eeport, but the place of the latter for this purpose has now been taken bv various commercial and consular reports. Eecent reports of value on questions of trade are Mr. H. W. Maclean's Conditions avd Prosvects of British Trade in Persia, 19C3, and Mr. A. H. Gkadowe-Newqomei/s CoanwemaZ to South-Eastern Persia, 1906. The principal work on the ancient geography of the Persian Coast is Mr- Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate, 1905, and the fallowing also deal with the same or with kindred subjects; Vincent's Voyage of l$earchus,Vl$l ; Kempthorne's On the Ruins at Tahrie, 1838, and his Narrative of a Visit to the Ruins of Tahrie, 1857 ; Captain A.

These have been utilised in the comp latioa of the map which is issued with the present Gazetteer. A useful map in its day andPERSIAN COAST 1467 measures also find their place most appropriately in this article. For information on topics not dealt with below the reader is referred to the articles on the separate districts. Thy deal conformation. Persian littoral tract is monotonous, but not without variety of detail. It may be described in general terms as a narrow strip of flat land, situated between the sea and a great maritime range of limestone which runs parallel to the coast. Inland from Bushehr, however, and again between Bandar 'Abbas and Minab at the entrance of the Gulf, the hills retreat from the coast with the effect of widening the maritime plain; and behind Lingeh the same effect is produced in a different manner by the projection of a low sub montane tract outwards into the Grulf. At one part of the coast, from Kangun to 'Asalu, the maritime range may be said to fall directly into the sea, and here the littoral plain is in abeyance ; in other places the plain is itself diversified, or is screened from seaward, by subsidiary ridges and hills which only the most recent survey enables us to distin guish from the main maritime range.* We may now proceed to examine the conditions more in detail, by sections of coast-line taken in order from the head to the entrance of the Gulf. The first section consists of the coastal districts of Liravi and Hay at Davud and the inland district of Shabankareh. Here the con figuration may be styled normal, for these three districts compose a plain from 15 to 20 miles in depth inland, of which the surface is unbroken save by the Kuh-i-Bang ridge skirting the coast at one place for about 12 miles. The true maritime range is here of no great elevation and still of service is Colonel E. C. Ross's Sketch Map of Fdrs, which is included with the Persian Gulf Administration Report of 1875-76. Recent and special Survey of India maps are Bushahr (i.e., the whole Bushehr Peninsula}, 1904-05, and a Map of Parts of the Behbehdn, Eindiydn, Jarrdhi and Falldhlyeh Districts by Jamna Parshad, Surveyor, 1905. A good map of communications in Persia was published hy the Postal Department of that country in 1906. Marine surveys and charts are : the Persian Gulf, No. 2373-2837A. (with insets of Charak, Chiru, Hanjam, Qais and Qishm); the No. 2374-2837B. (with insets of Shaikh Shu'aib, Kharag, Klhargu and Bushehr) ; the Entrance of the Persian Gulf, No. 2375-763 ; Basidu, No. 2376-35 ; and Abu Shahr, No. 2378-27, now superseded by a preliminary chart of the same which aepends on a re-survey of the harbour by Captain T. H. Homing, R .N. (retired), in November 1904. * Distant views of the coast range from the sea between Bushehr and Shivuh are given in Chart No. 2374—2837B., and between Shivuii and Bandar 'Abbas ittChart No. 2378—2837A., Persian Gulf. 5 Ailli 1458 PERSIAN COAST behind Dllam, where it most nearly approaches the coast, it is only about 1,000 feet in height. The plain itself in this section consists in some places of grass lands and in others of good arable soil; here and there it is pierced by light-grey protruding sandstone rocks, and everywhere it is more or less seamed by lines of drainage from the hills. The second section of the littoral tract comprises the littoral districts of Eud-hilleh, Angali, Dashtistan and the Bushehr Peninsula, besides the small districts of Zira and Mazara'i which are cut off from the sea by the others. This is one of the exceptional parts of the coast, for, partly by the receding of the hills in a curve that passes inland of Daliki and partly by a protrusion of the coast about Bushehr, the depth of the sub montane region is here increased to about 45 miles, the greatest width which it anywhere attains. Moreover this section is distinguished by the possession of a river, the Eud-Mlleh, which gives it an alluvial character and is, as we shall see, an unusual feature upon the Persian Coast. The maritime range behind this second group of districts varies in altitude from about 3,000 to about 6,000 feet and is highest towards the south and east: the plain, which at the foot of the hills is not unfertile, degenerates as it approaches the sea into a barren desert of baked clay, and at the coast is gradually merged in extensive and ill-defined mud-flats. The third section consists of the districts of Tangistan and Dashti only. In it the maritime range is 25 miles from the coast and at one place reaches a height of 6,500 feet; but there are two subsidiary ridges immediately skirting the coast which are unusually conspicuous and give these districts the character of troughs parallel to the sea, not connected with it except by two passages of which the more important is the valley of the Mund river. The coast range north of the Mund river is straight, and in one place it rises to a height of over 2,500 feet: south of the Mund river it forms a half moon with the convex side to the sea, and the plain that it encloses is open to the coast ^ only at one point between Daiyir and Kangun. The Mund river is, ii| e with the exception of the Rud-hilleh and Minab rivers, the only considerable stream which reaches the Gulf on the Persian side in the districts now under consideration. %i The next or fourth section, consisting of the SMbkuh and Lingeh ^ districts, is the most extensive and in some ways the most remarkable of ^ all. The main maritime range, which at the commencement of this section at Kangun abuts upon the coast, extends thence in an unbroken and almost straight line for over 200 miles, with heights of 3,000 to 5,000 feet, to a point between Ling.eh Town and Khamir where thePERSIAN COAST U59 coast again meets and terminates it. In this section the physical geo graphy of the land enclosed between the range and the coast is very complex, and, being fully described in the articles on the Shlbkuh and Lingeh districts, need not be dealt with in detail here. Its principal features are two subsidiary coast ranges en echeloU) meeting the main range at a slight angle and so forming the valleys which reach the sea at Naband and Mugam. To these may be added a third feature, the Iiingeh plain, in which the submontane terrace attains its maximum breadth (in this section) of 30 miles ; the plain is basin-shaped, containing a marsh in the centre, and its rim towards the sea is studded with detached coast hills 1,000 to 2,000 feet in height. Throughout this section the main range is of limestone and supports some vegetation, whereas its outliers upon the sea are of sandstone and absolutely barren. The sea-front of the Bastak district upon Clarence Strait constitutes in itself a section. As far as Khamir it is free of hills and is in fact the mouth of an immensely long valley which has followed the back of the maritime range all the way from a point inland of Tahiri and here discharges its drainage into Clarence Strait. A little beyond Khamir another range of hills, running in a direction parallel to the original maritime range, strikes the coast and accompanies it for some miles. The sixth section is entirely cut off by the section preceding it from the littoral of the upper Gulf, but it is not dissimilar from it in character. It consists of the district of Shamil alone and bears some analogy to the widening of the maritime plain at Bushehr, but its maximum depth inland is only about 25 miles and its two streams, the Kul and Shamil rivers, are not comparable with the Rud-hilleh river in volume or importance. The hills however which form its inland boundary are of great height, attaining in Kuh-i-Ginau nearly 8,000 feet. This section is subdivided at its western end by a low sandstone ridge, which is parallel to the coast, into two belts ; the coast belt is for the most part sandy and swampy, while the inland belt is comparatively fertile. The seventh and last section of the Persian Coast of the Gulf is a plain, co-extensive with the Minab and Biyaban districts and tapering from 20 miles in width at its north end to 10 miles and less at its southern extremity. The portion situated in Minab is swampy towards the coast and elsewhere fertile; in Biyaban the surface is partly sand an d partly clay. The maritime range behind this section .decreases in ^ight from about 2,000 feet in the north to 1,000 in the south. In the northern part of this section the not inconsiderable Minab river reaches 5 A 8 if I ^ the sea.1460 PERSIAN COAST Beyond this section commences Persian Makran, which lies outside the Persian Gulf on the shores of the Gulf of ^Oman, but of which the westernmost or Jashk district belongs for administrative purposes to the Persian Coast. Administration, —The administrative system—if such it can be called —which prevails on the Persian Coast of the Persian Gulf is difficult to explain and even to understand ; it is full of irregularities, complexities and fluctuations, and there is no recognised nomenclature even for territorial divisions or for official appointments.* The arrangements are haphazard and undefined. The districts of the Persian Coast at present are divided,t in the manner shown in the following table, between the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Fars and that of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, each of whom is directly subordinate to the central Government at Tehran :— * Persevering attempts by loc^l officers to establish a consistent terminology have ended in proving that none exists. Large provinces such as Fars and Kirman are ordinarily called Mamlakats or Ayalata and the Governor-General placed over such a province is generally styled Farman-Farma At present, however, the Governor-General of Kirman happens to possess the title of Farman-Farma as a personal honour, and in his official capacity is fre quently called Vali instead. The Governor-General of Fars appears to be generally spoken of 'in the Gulf as 'the Ayalat' and not as the Farman- Farma, Behbehan and Lar are both sub-provinces of Fars, and each is admi nistered by a Governor subordinate to the Governor-General and styled Hakim • yet the former territorial unit appears to be described as a Mahallat while the latter is denominated a Khittah aIo ^. The Gulf Ports form a Mamlakat, but are governed by a Hukmran For a district, in the sense in which the word is used in the present article, there appears to be no current term ; and such expressions as Mazafat oUlA-® (meaning ' dependencies'), Qasbajat olac-^ (meaning 'small towns') and Dihat oUi (meaning 'villages') are loosely employed as a substitute: in a similar manner Tavabi' (meaning 'dependencies') is sometimes used instead of Mahallat. There is also a word Buluk which seems to denote a territorial division intermediate in size between a sub-province and a district. The official called in the table below a Deputy-Governor appears generally to rank in the Persian hierarchy as a Naib-ul-Hukumeh ^513. In the Gulf the other rulers of districts are Khans, Shaikhs, Kalantars, etc.; and the local executive authority in a small group of villages is sometimes called a Zabit Among the higher officials posi tion and title are frequently determined by personal rank instead of by official status, and the confusion regarding the relative importance of appointments is thus further increased. t The political constitution of the Persian Coast in 1873 is described in the Gulf Administration 'Report for 1873-74, and that obtaining ir 1875 is given with much detail inj the Beport for 1875-70, &amp; At15 Qis'hm Island Qisiim Town.

It will be seen that four different kinds of administrations exist side by side in the districts dealt with in this table. The first of these is direct rule by Persian officials at places where the Persian Government have retained the full rights of sovereignty in their own hands ; such are the Bushehr Peninsula and Town, Lingeh District and Town, and Bandar 'Abbas. The second is government by a local hereditary chief to whom the revenues of his own domain have been farmed, and this is the kind which predominates in the part of Persia now in question. The third is administration by a non-local, but wealthy or otherwise influential personage, who has farmed the revenues of the tract from the Persian Government; on the Persian Coast of the Gulf an arrangement of this nature exists only in regard to the islands of Qishm, Hanjam, Larak and Hormuz, the district of Minab and part of the district of Bastak, all of which are farmed by the M u^in-ut-Tujj ar. The fourth is the rule of a holder on Tiyul,* that is by royal grant, instances of which are found on the Persian Coast in the districts of Eud-hilleh^ Zira and Mazara'i. It should be noted that the Persian Government in making a Tiyuli grant or in farming out revenue do not regard existing administrative boundaries, and the effect of such operations is consequently to dismember or confuse previously recognised districts; the present districts of Mazara'i, Zira 5 Angali and Shabankareh appear to have been carved in this manner out of the formerly larger district of Dashtistan, and in common parlance the name Dashtistan is still sometimes used as if it included the smaller and now separate districts. In all cases the general political control and the power of inflicting death or mutilation as a punishment for crime are understood to be reserved to the Governor-General of Fars or the Governor of the Gulf Ports, as the case may be ; but, with these exceptions, where there is a revenue farmer (either of the local or non-local class) or a grant holder, the whole powers and functions of government are delegated to him and * Ti^ul J . ju is of two kinds. The first is a free assignment by the Shah, generally • i • in lieu of a pension : it corresponds to an Indian *' Jaglr ' and is called Nam ^ JU . The second is a grant made by the same authority in return for a lump sum paid into the treasury or for an engagement to make periodical payments at a fixed rate ; in the 'Utter case Tiyul differs from an ordinary farm of the revenue only in bein^ for more than a year, or for an indefinite period. Here we may mention that the ordinary agricultural revenue is styled in Persia Malyat oUiU, while the total assessment of a district in view of its assets of every kind is known as TumSr The existence of the Tumar is said to date from early Qajar times.PBESIAN COAST 1465 he uses them to wring' the highest possible revenue out of the tract thus placed under his authority. There are no criminal courts and no forms of procedure in criminal matters. Civil justice of a kind is dispensed by the Shara' courts, which exist every where ; but these are hopelessly vetial, and conflicting decisions can be bought by the parties from rival Mujtahids, and sometimes even from the same Mujtahid. Civil cases accordingly drag on for years, and frequently they cannot be settled at all except by agreement of the parties, a result which is sometimes brought about by arbitration. The pimcipal dofocts of tlie administration which, wo havo now described are intermixture and conflict of jurisdictions, anomalous forms of decentralisation which in practice are almost the same thing as local inde pendence, and an entire want of fixity or permanence. The Persian authorities are feeble and opportunist and maintain themselves chiefly by keeping dissensions afoot among the local powers. The small military force at their disposal is concentrated for the most part at Bushehr Town, where there are 50 artillerymen and ^00 infantry; trifling detach ments however are maintained at Lingeh Town, Bandar 'Abbas and in the Minab district. The results of this system, especially in the group of Persian districts nearest to Bushehr and in the semi-Arab district of Shibkuh, are in the highest degree unsatisfactory, and they appear occasionally to strike even the Persian mind in this light. In the Bushelir neighbourhood the Khans of Burazjan, Shabankareh, Angali, Hayat Davud and Liravi and the Shaikh of Chah Kutah are constantly engaged in intrigues against one another and form combinations and counter-com binations among themselves for the promotion of their ends. Burglaries by night and cattle raids by day in the various districts are the outcome of these factions, and they are sometimes followed by general encounters between the subjects of the different chiefs, in which many persons are slain and wounded, for in these days nearly every fighting man possesses a modern rifle and a cartridge-loading machine^ The local Persian officials appear indifferent to these disturbances and are sometimes suspected of bringing them about, which they can easily do at any time by displacing a hereditary chief in favour of a neighbour or enemy who undertakes to pay a higher farm for the district. Disorders of which the raison d'etre is to discredit the new chief soon break out, while the rivals lay their complaints before the central government by post and telegraph and each receive in reply satisfactory assurances which have passed into a proverb among the peasantry as a Tehran promises*'. Eventually the1466 fEESlAN COAST question is settled on the spot by force or by negotiation between the parties chiefly concerned. In the Shlbkuh district also disturbances are not uncommon; but for these the Persian Government is perhaps less to blame, inasmuch as their control over the Zabits or rulers of groups of villages, in this district for the most part Arab Shaikhs, is slight and insecure. Here they find it practically impossible to replace a Shaikh except by a member of his own family, for an intruder from outside would soon be removed by assassination, and the certainty o£ such a fate deters aspirants.* Intrigues and enmities are no less rife here than among the local chiefs near Bushehr. The principal groups are the Hamadis and liaramis &gt; who are in alliance together against the Nasuris, and the Hamadis and Marzuqis who are combined against the A1 'All, the Bushri section of the A1 'Ali however being in league with the Hamadis and Marzuqis against their own kinsmen. The ^Obaidlis also are on bad terms with the A1 'Ali. These warring communities and their leaders occasionally, when common interests appear to be in danger, Undergo formal reconciliations ; but their pacts, though solemnly entered into by an oath on the Quran, are of short duration, and their power has been much weakened by internecine feuds which the Persian autho rities have carefully fostered. Cufrency) weights and measures.^ this is the only article which deals with the tract as a whole, the present is a convenient opportunity for dealing with the currency, weights and measures of the Gulf Ports and the coast districts of Fars. The money table of the Persian Coast is as follows :— 50 Dinars • . • • . = 1 Shahi 20 Shahis or 1,000 Dinars . • = 1 Qran 10 Qrans or 10,000 Dinars . • . = 1 Ttiman I The Dinar is an imaginary coin, and there is another fictitious unit Called Pul JjJ which is used by native traders in their calculations and is equal to ^ a Imperial Persian Customs in their accounts * Eecent events have now shown this to be no empty conjecture (1907). See article Shibkuh. fFor further information under this head the reader is referred to the P ersian Gulf Administration Beport, 1877-78; Mr. H. W. Maclean's Report on tie Conditions and Prospects of British Trade in Persia^ 1903; and Mr. A. H. Gleadowe-New- comen's Reports on the Commercial Mission to South Eastern Persia, 1906. The subjects of credit, exchange, etc., are fully explained by Mr. Maclean. + Tuinan means 10,000, sc. Dinars.8^ or ' Cents ' called Ghaz The average value of the Qran is at the present time about four pence English, but the number of Qrans to the pound sterling fluctuates between 52 and 65 according to the rate of exchange, and 100 Indian rupees are following: - Nickel worth Silver 1 Shahi piece, called fakshalii or Dupuli. 2 Shahi piece, called Dushahi or Chaharpuli. a Qran piece 1 Oran „ 2 Qran „ 6 Qran | Tuman \ Tuman 2 Tuman ,5 Tuman newer Persian coins all of Belgian mintage. Notes of 1 Tuman value and upwards, issued by the Imperial Bank of Persia, are in circulation. English sovereigns and Indian rupees are accepted in Bushehr Town at the current rate of exchange. The unit of weight throughout Persia is the Man ^ ; but it varies, within considerable limits, from place to place. T'he Tabriz Man ^ or Batman,* equal to 6*547 lbs. English, has been adopted by the Imperial Persian Customs as a standard of weight for the use of the department in all parts of the country; but in the Gulf region a local Man varying from 5 lbs. 13 oz. to 10 lbs. 10^ oz. is still universally employed in all but customs transactions. The weight of this Man in each district is given in the article on the district: at Bushehr Town^ where before the advent of the Imperial Persian Customs it was wrongly described as a Tabriz Man, the local Man is equal to 7 i lbs. English^ In each of the Persian Coast districts there]is, in addition to the simple Man, a larger Hashim Man consisting of 16 local Mans. The table of weights on the Persian Coast runs as follows :— 24 NakMd = 1 Misqal JUu*) 48 Misqal = 1 Qiyas 16 Qiyas — 1 Man 16 Man ICQ Hashim Mans There is no liquid measure in Southern Persia, and the quantity of liquids is estimated by weight, the weight of the receptacle being deducted from the total weight. # The writer has not been able to ascertain the origin of this word or the language to wtich it belongs. = 1 Hashim Man = 1 Kharvar r'1468 PERSIAN COAST The table of lineal measure is as follows ;— 4 Gireh tjf :=: 1 Chaliarak &lt;-^1^ 4 Chaliarak = 1 Zara' or Gaz j/ The Gaz is ordinarily equal to 40^ inelies English; local variations in a few districts are noted in the articles under their names. The Zara 5 is supposed to be the distance from the tip of a man's middle finger (when one of his arms is extended horizontally) to his nose,, his face being at the same time turned in the opposite direction. There is also a ZaiV-i-Dast or cubit^ which is not now in general use it is defined as the distance from the tip of a man's middle finger to his elbow, and it is regarded as being half of the ordinary ZaiV. The only unit of square measure for land is a very indefinite one called Gau ft; it is described as the area which one yoke of animals can plough in the ploughing-season of about 25 days, or alternatively as the area which requires 6 Hashim Mans of seed grain to sow it, and it appears to be approximately represented by a square of which the side is 250 yards. lFAR Frequently pronounced Gufar or Jifar ; the second town in importance 5 U3 in Jabal Shammar proper, hardly inferior (if it is not equal) to the capital in population. Qafar is situated about 9 miles south-west of Hail, than which it stands about 400 feet higher; it consists of two ^ main parts and there are 4- distinct quarters. The place with its cultivated fields and date-groves stretches some £ J miles ; palms are more numerous than at Hail itself. The people are Bani Tamim and number 3,000 souls or more. This is the westernmost point between Hail and Taimah where women are seen veiled. The wells are said to be 15 to 18 fathoms in depth, and there are the usual livestock. Q AH TAN The singular is Qahtani ; and, as distinguished from the collective plural Qahtan, there 'is a distributive plural Qahatin The Qahtan are an important tribe, principally nomadic, of Centia Arabia. Distribution and number.— The eastern, southern and western limits of the territory of the Qahtan are not precisely ascertained; but on theQAHTAN 1469 north they wander in Sadair and Washam; sometimes they dispute the pastures of Qasim with the Mutair or visit, the districts of 'Aridh and Summan. They are believed to be numerous in Wadi Sabai', Wadi Bishah and Wadi Tathllth and to be found also in the Tihamah of the Red Sea basin; but in Widyan Dawasir they have no place. The distribution of their Bedouins is explained in greater detail in the table of tribal divisions below; and we may note that settled communi ties of reputed Qahtani blood are found in the south-western part of Najd at Quwai'iyah and Sha'arah ; in Qasim at Basr and tlatan ; in Sadair at Majma/ Eaudhah and Zilfi; in 'Aridh at Malqa and Manfuhah; and in Hautah at Hautah town.

Some of the settled Qalitan of ^Aridli are said to belong* to a section called ^Aidh and those in Zilfi are Mashf The total number of nomadic Qahtan in Central Arabia has been estimated at 8^000 souls, but this is little better than a conjecture. Character and possessions. Qahtan appear to be unpopular among the more northern tribes with whom they are in contact; by these the term Qahtani is sometimes used as an invective. Many reports to the disadvantage of the Qahtan are current among 1 their neighbours ; as for instance that they murder smokers, that they eat the flesh of their slainqais un enemies^ and that their own dead are thrown to the birds without burial. These stories are probably untrue, but they are in reality an evil-natured race and ' austerely fanatical 33 in religious matters to an unusual degree. That they are habitually treacherous in war is a well established fact. Nevertheless they are an Arab tribe of the noblest lineage, and none of the Bedouins excel them in arms except perhaps the 1 Ataibah. They are fairly rich in cattle and horses. P oliHcal,position.' In 1864!; in consequence probably of their nearness on one side to the centre of Wahhabi power, they were under the influence of Riyadh, but their loyalty to the Amir was apparent only. In 1878 they intruded close to ' Anaizah and raided the Mutair; but they were surprised in their turn and suffered a disastrous defeat by the wells of Dukhnah at the hands of the Mutair and the townsmen of 'Anaizah. In English formerly known as ' Kaeese/ , a Ghes' or'Kenn': QAIS the origin of the last name is not now traceable. An island in the Persian Gulf still of considerable, and in former times of great importance; it is situated 11 miles off the coast of the Shlbkuh district, slightly nearer to Cbiru than to Charak, and is divided from the mainland by a fine channel from 20 to 30 fathoms deep. Qais in its conformation resembles an oval and slightly convex stud : it measures about 10 miles in length from west to east by 44 in breadth, and it rises from the coast to a plateau in the interior which is 120 feet above sea level. The shores of the island are low, and the beach is sandy with rocky points; eastwards and westwards Qais ends in very low cliffs. The island is encompassed by a reef which is nowhere more than a mile broad and has deep water immediately outside it; it is surrounded by pearl banks except at one place on the east side off Masheh. The general colour of the island is a light brown, and it is bare of vegetation except a few scattered date groves and some stunted herbs. The water level is high, and at a cape called Sar Masheh or Mamzar j)^, at the north-eastern corner of the island sweet water can be obtained near the beach by digging to a depth of between 1 and 4 feet. * For a plan of the anchorage and port of the island see Admiralty Chart No. 2373—2837 k., Persian Gulf and for an older plan of the whole, Bombay Selections XXIV of 1856, page 45.U72 QAIS The island contains the following villages : — Name.

Saifat-al-Ghafeh djUJI On the southern coast at its eastern end. 3 houses. - Sajarn A short way inland of Dal me h. 20 houses. There are 10 donkeys, 10 cattle, SO sheep and goats, 1,700 date trees and 5 fishing boats. There are thus in all about 450 occupied houses, and the total population may be estimated at 2,250 souls, chiefly of the A1 'Ali tribe. They possess only a score of modern rifles. In summer the population is considerably increased by an influx from the Arabian and Persian coasts generally. Some cultivation of dates, wheat and barley is carried on at all the villages by means of irrigation from wells and,, at Masheh, of an inferior aqueduct. Onions, cucumbers, water melons and marsh melons are also grown; but the principal resources are fishing and pearling. There are 26 large pearl boats, chiefly Sambuks, which go to the pearly banks on the Arabian side in the season ; also 27 small Baqarahs and 40 Shu^ais which are used for fishing in winter, and in summer for pearling off the coasts of the island itself. There is also some general trade. To the island belong 3 trading Baghlahs which make voyages to Basrah, Bahrain, India, and even Yaman. The bazaar at Masheh contains about 50 shops and 9' commercial warehouses. About 12 Hindus, British subjects, without their families are settled here as shopkeepers and pearl merchants, and about 10 more sojourn temporarily in the island dur ing the pearl season. Pearl boats working in tlie vicinity call at 5 B1474 QAIQ -Masheh twice or thrice during tlie diving season to dispose of their takings and replenish their stock of provisions and water, Qais island was till lately understood to belong to the Shaikh of Charak, who is locally represented by an agent, at the present time his nephew ; and the comparative wealth of the Shaikh was attributed to his possession of Qais. Towards the end of 1906^ however, it became known that the Qawam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz and his family claim absolute ownership of the island on the strength of an autograph deed of gift, said to have been executed by Nasr-ud-Din Shah about 1878 in favour of 'Ali Muham mad Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk, as a reward for services rendered by him in the Gulf provinces. The Qawami family allege that they derive about 800 Tumans a year from Qais, chiefly by way of dues on the pearl fisheries. From the antiquarian standpoint Qais is interesting on account of ruins,* probably those of the mediaeval Muhammadan town of Qais or Harirah which line the northern coast for about half a mile midway between the villages of Dih and Safil. These ruins are of less extent than the supposed ruins of Siraf at TaMri and consist now of mere mounds of stone and fragments of masonry. A mosque, however, which was of well-cut stone, had one minaret standing until about 50 years ago; the pillars of this mosque were octagonal in section and the blocks of which they were composed were mortised together by central tenons^ There are remains of several large oblong water-reservoirs, formerly vaulted over, two of which measured 150 feet by 40 feet and in 1857 were still 24? feet deep. Near these began a fine Qanat nearly half a mile in length, cut in the solid rock and running at its deeper end 20 feet beneath the surface ^ it had about 40 shafts at intervals of 15 to 20 yards apart, and the bottoms of the shafts were accessible in four cases by a stairway of shallow steps cut in the rock. QAIWAIN In English at one time known as ' Amulgavine ^ A town on the (UMM-AL-) western coast of Trucial 5 Oman forming, with the country adjoining it, a small independent principality of which the political position is described TOWlJ i 11 the general article on Trucial 'Oman.f and • These are described by Capt. Stiffe in an article on Qais in the Geographical PBINCIPA- Journal tor 1896, Volume 7, page 644. Qais, 'by the mediaeval Arab and Persian LITY geographers also styled Qaish. and Kish, was tbe principal centre of trade in the Persian Gulf in the 12th century A.D., having succeeded to the position of the eanier Siraf (vide Tahiri). See Le Strange' 8 Lands of the Eastern Caliphate. ^ For authorities, maps, charts, etc., see first footnote to article Trueial 'Oman.QAIWAIN (UMM-AL-) 1475 The town of Umm-al-Qaiwain is 27 miles south-west of Ras-al- Khaimah Town and 18 miles north-east o£ Sharjah Town. It is peculiarly situated on the eastern end of a peninsula which is so turned in as to point towards the coast and to form, with the island which Khor-al- Baidhah divides from mainland^ a landlocked creek 3 or 4 square miles in area and containing several low islets. This creek, at the town, is 600 yards wide and 6 to 8 fathoms deep; but its entrance, which is 3 miles to the north-north-east, carries only Ji feet at low water ; nor can a depth of 5 fathoms be found at sea nearer to the town than 1 mile. Umm-al- Qaiwain is defended by a wall with towers, which traverses the isthmus to the west of the town, and by several detached blockhouses. The town, except for a quarter called Lazimah which is situated | of a mile west of all the others, is compactly built and arranged; the western part of it. in which the Shaikh has his residence, is called Libinah . There are in all about 1 ,000 houses of which | are of masonry, the remainder being huts of date branches. The people, except a few Al Bu Mahair and others in the Lazimah quarter, all belong to the Al 'All tribe and may number some 5,000 souls. Three Hindu traders are settled in the place, two of whom are accompanied by their families and one of whom has a Hindu servant. The inhabitants of Umm-al-Qaiwain are chiefly pearl divers and fishermen^ owning about 70 pearling and 60 fishing boats. One Baghlah, which runs to Bombay, is the only sea-going vessel belong ing to the port. There are about 38 horses, 720 camels, 40 donkeys, 10 cattle and 200 sheep and goats : the water supply, which is from wells about 6 feet deep, is good: the date plantations comprise about 1,500 trees. The bazaar contains 20 shops. About 20 boats per annum are built here, or more than at any other place on the coast of Trucial 'Oman. The Shaikhdom of which Umm-al-Qaiwain town is the capital has no clearly defined boundaries, but it forms an enclave in Sharjah territory. On the coast it reaches north-eastwards to Jazir? v -al-Hamra and south-westwards part of the way to Hamriyall: the Simyah island formed by Khor-al-Baidhah is thus included in it. The only place of importance not on the coast which belongs to Umm-al- Qaiwain is Falaj Al 'AH ^ jf — for short generally called Falai ,— which is about 16 miles south-east of Umm- al-Qaiwain town and perhaps 8 miles north-west of Dhaid village. Falai is said to consist of some 60 households of the Al 'Ali tribe who possess 50 camels and a few other animals. There are here about 5,000 date palms, irrigated by the Falaj from Thiqbat-as-Sanaibil on Wadi Manghol and all belonging to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. 5 B1476 QAIWAIN (UMM-AL-) Falai is the regular rendezvous for Bedouins in the Umm-al-Qaiwain service when they are called to arms. The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain lerives a regular iucome of about Rs. 19,000 a year from the pearling- industry in his state, besides which he himself engages in trade as a pearl merchant, and to a lesser extent as a dealer in rice; his date plantation at Falaj A1 ''AH, if it is not a source of wealth, at least enables him to avoid certain pecuniary expenses. In one year he obtained enormous profits by obligino- the pearl fleet of Umm-al-Qaiwain to purchase all their provisions from himself. QALAI'AH The name is commonly pronounced as if it were ' Khor Lijlar'ah.'' (KHOR-AIr) A lagoon 2 miles in width by 3 miles in length, lying to the southward AsaiiiJi jj L . 0 £ Muharraq Island in Bahrain. Shelter. —It is enclosed on the south by Sitrah Island and its fringing reef ; on the west by the Island of Bahrain ; on the north by Muharraq Island ; and on the east by a barrier-reef extending 3 miles to the southward from Muharraq Island and terminating in a rock, one foot above sea level at high water, which is called Qassar-ad- m Diwan Entrance. —The only entrance available for shipping lies between Qassar-ad-Diwan and the Sitrah reef; it is two cables wide and has a bar, formed by an extension of the eastern barrier-reef which stretches right across its mouth and is 120 yards across at its narrowest part. In the centre of the bar is a gut, 60 yards wide and generally 16 to 17 feet deep ; but the bottom is rocky and uneven, and in places the depth is only 14 feet. The remainder of the entrance-channel is from 5 to 7 fathoms deep and steep-to on both sides. A shoal lies outside the entrance, and there are two approaches, one to the north, the other to the south of the shoal, of which the northern is the better. Interior. —Within the Ehor the 5-fathom line extends for a mile, enclosing a gutter from 1 to 2 cables wide with an average depth of 6 fathoms; this gutter is situated between the barrier-reef and a large sandbank which lies in the middle of the Khor. The 4-fathom line extends further northward and encloses an anchorage about 1 mile long and 3 to 4 cables wide, suitable for vessels o£ moderate draught. The bottom here is hard and covered with a thin layer of sand j it does not afford good holding-ground. There are two other good anchorages^ lyingQALAII 1477 respectively south and west of the middle ground, with mud bottoms and depths of 4 to 5 fathoms ; but they are difficult of access. There is abundant anchorage for light-draught ships up to within a mile of Muharraq Town. A channel which leads from the north-west corner of the Khor into Manamah harbour is 2 feet deep at low water and con« sequently fit only for small boats. Tides. —The velocity of the tidal streams in the Khor is generally about \ a knot, the flood setting to the northward. In the entrance they are much stronger, being about 3 knots at springs, with swirls, eddies and overfalls at the bar. Naval value. —The entrance to Khor-al-Qalai'ah could be very easily defended by forts erected on the reef, and ships lying within would be secure from torpedo attack. The Khor is also perfectly sheltered from all winds. On the other hand it would be expensive, if indeed it were possible, to dredge out the entrance and anchorages to the depth necessary for large ships j the entrance even after improvement would be difficult, and the holding-ground inside, as already remarked, is iudifferent: in these respects Klior-al-Qalai^ah does not lend itself to the establishment of a large defended port, but it might serve as a station for a torpedo flotilla. Survey. —The Khor was surveyed and reported on by Lieutenant and Commander H. B. Somerville of H.M.S. ' Redbreast ) in 1905 and the above are the principal results of his inquiry.* A village on the north-east coast of Muharraq Island in Bahrain. QALALI It consists of about 450 mud and reed huts with two good masonry houses, of which the one nearest to the sea resembles a square tower and is a good mark for mariners. On the ground near the squaie house lie three old iron guns, relics of former times but of uncertain oiigin. 1 he inhabitants of Qalali are all Sunnis, chiefly of the Ma nan a ah tribe (100 houses), engaged in pearl-dealing, pearl-diving and sea-fishing. About 60 sailing vessels belong to the village, viz., 55 Shu^ais and Sambuks and 4 Mashuwahs and jollyboats; out of these 21 are used for peailing. * For iull deiAils see lieutenant Somerville's report* with two charts, printed in the Foreign Deparfcment of the Government of India, Simla, July 1905#1478 QALALI There are no dates Or cultivation : livestock are donkeys and 2 cattle.

A valley (WADI-AL -) in the hills of the ''Oman Promontory within the limits of the Shaikhdom of Sharjah; the route from Eas-al-Khaimah Town to Dibah lies up it. The pass from which Wadi-al-Qaliddi apparently descends in a west-north-westerly direction to the neighbourhood of Khatt in the Jiri plain seems to form the watershed between the two coasts and to be situated about 11 miles in a straight line to the west-north-west of Dibah ; and the Qaliddi hill, from which perhaps the valley takes its name, is said to occur about midway between the pass and Khatt. The following two villages are in or near Wadi-al-Qaliddi ; but their exact positions are uncertain :— Name. Situation. Inhabitants. E emabks. Muhtarqab iSjXs?* Near the pass where the valley rises.

QARA An uncivilised tribe of the Sainhan hills and certain coast villages in the district of Dhufar ; in their own tongue they call themselves Hakli TRIBE and the word Qara is locally pronounced Gurrah. Their range is from Sadah on the east to Bakhyut on the west and inland as far as the country is habitable, that is to say for no great distance. Physical characteristics. —The Qaras are commonly stated to be a branch of the Mahra tribe. They differ greatly in appearance and character from the typical Arab, and, though they are generally regarded # This valley is shown in the map Route of Lt.*Col, Ilerhert Vishrowe, etc,, 1865.QARA TRIBE 1479 as belonging to the Gliafiri faction, it may be doubted wliether they are really a part of the Arab race. They are an active and well-built people, too slender to be termed athletic and formed for agility and endurance rather than for strength. The typical Qara face is oval, with a forehead low but not receding, a prominent frontal sinus, and eyebrows horizontal rather than arched. The cheekbones are high and prominent 3 the nose is long ; the lips are thin, the upper one short j and the chin tends to protrude. The Qaras have generally handsome features and a pleasant expression. Character) religion and language.—'ThQ Qaras appear to be excitable and untrustworthy. They profess Islam and Undergo circumcision, but they pay little attention to other forms or ceremonies and are regarded as heathens by the ordinary Arab. Their beliefs are said to relate chiefly to Jinns and sorcery, but they are classed as Sunnis. No specimens have as yet been obtained of their language which has been described as a dialect of Mahri. Food and clothing. —The food of the Qaras is chiefly milk and flesh with honey, wild fruits, roots and vegetables. They are much addicted to smoking, and the men all carry short pipes carved out of stone. The clothing of the male sex is a piece of cloth 7 cubits long by 4 cubits broad, fringed or tasselled at the ends; this they wrap round their loins allowing it to hang down to their knees like a short kilt. The men wear their hair long and secure it in a bunch by means of a leather fillet or a cord made of their oWn hair: the fillet serves upon occasion for many other purposes. The women dress in a piece of cloth measuring 9 cubits by 3 cubits ; it is fashioned with short sleeves and descends a little below the knee in front, while behind it trails upon the ground : in addition to this they throw a cloth 4 cubits long by 2 cubits wide over the head and shoulders. Pemale ornaments are nose and toe-rings^ armlets and necklaces of silver; the women divide their hair in the middle and collect it-on each side in a tress which passes behind the ear and hangs loosely over the breast. The garments of both sexes are dark blue, being dyed with indigo, and men and women alike mark themselves tipon the cheekbones with 3 vertical cicatrices. Mode of life and customs, —During the greater part of the year the majority of the Qaras inhabit thatched huts^ and a few of them live in small tents : but in the 3 winter months they occupy caverns. Certain of their cave-dwellings are of great size, accommodating the flocks and.1480 QARA TRIBE herds as well as the families of the owners; in some there is an upper storey. One of these caverns at Dirbat is 150 feet in span, 50 feet high and 30 feet deep. The Qaras keep camels, cattle, sheep and goats ; they have very little cultivation. They subsist chiefly by collecting frankincense and other gums but they deal also to a small extent in hides and ghi. The Qaras salute strangers by touching fingers with them, they do not shake hands. Qara relations kiss one another upon each cheek by Way of greeting. A distinctively Qara custom is to slaughter a bullock at the grave on the occasion of a funeral and to distribute the meat to the assembled poor. As a race the Qaras are quarrelsome and addicted to mutual slaughter. The blood-feud is tempered only by the employment of Rabi's ^ ^ or third persons specially engaged as protectors, whose duty it is to take up the feud should the person for whose safety they are responsible be attacked while under their protection. Qara disputes, so far as they are not fought out with arms, are settled by the authority of elders. Arms. —The arms of the Qaras are a wooden, shark-skin, basket- work or metal shield, about 1^ feet in diameter and conical in shape, which is also used as a stool, as a head-dress and for carrying water ; a throwing-stick a yard long and pointed at both ends which they can deliver with great precision at 30 feet, causing it to turn over once in its flight, and can also make to ricochet along the ground ; and an iron sword without a guard, straight-bladed, 3 feet long a-nd 3 inches broad, which they carry on the right shoulder without a scabbard: the sword is sometimes of German manufacture. They also wear daggers and a few of them have muzzle-loading guns. Tribal divisions and number, —The principal divisions of the tribe are; — Section. FigMing strength. Habitat. Remarks.

Political characteristics, —Politically the Qaras appear to be a restless and irresponsible, but not a resolute or really dangerous tribe. Saiyid Muhammad-bin-'Aqll, pirate and self-constituted governor of Dhufar,1482 QARA TRIBE was murdered in 1829 in pursuance of a blood-feud by Salim-bin-Thon, the head of all the Qaras. In 1845-6 parties of British officers in Dhufar were fired on by the Qaras^ and it was found unsafe to move about in their hills without the company of a Qara Rabr'; but other and more recent travellers experienced no trouble. In unsettled times the tribe sometimes cause annoyance to the villagers of Dhufar plain, especially by damaging their crops at night; but they never attack the settled villages; and the A1 Kathir say they are not afraid of them. QAHAH (BARErAL-) A coastal tract in Eastern Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa, It reaches from Ras-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on the south, a distance of about 36 miles; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-'Oqair to the north; and Qatar to the south of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert.

Qararah consists of large date plantations in which stand the summer houses of the owners, who are mostly inhabitants of Baghdad, and the residences of the cultivators. Here are 4 distilleries, owned by Jews and worked under the control of the Public Debt Department, which supply nearly the whole of Turkish 'Iraq with native liquor. There is a long boat bridge of 36 to 45 pontoons, according to season, of which 7 adjoining the left bank are swung down stream to let vessels pass. There aie no shops. A Nahiyah which formerly existed was abolished about 10 years ago, and only a few police now remain. When epidemic disease prevails lower down the Tigris, steamers for Baghdad undergo a sanitary inspection at Qararah. QARNAIN* O . l • An island about 53 miles from the coast of the Abu Dhabi Princi pality, lying in the middle between the islands Arzanah, Das and Zirko. It is 1^ miles long, north-west and south-east, by i a mile broad. Qarnain has three remarkable detached peaks, one of which is 190 feet high, near its northern end ; the southern part of it is low. There is no fresh water. The following pearl banks are - in the neigh bourhood of * A view of this island will be found in Chart No. 2374—2837 B.^r) QASlM 1485 Qarnain Qidair; 4 miles to the north ; and on the south, closely adjoin- ingv the great group known as Sutuh Arzanah which reaches from Zirko almost to Arzanah. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi appears to be the owner of Qarnain. A small sandy islet in the Persian Grulf, situated in latitude 28° 49' QARU north and longitude 48° 47' east, about 25 miles off the Kuwait coast and 24? miles south-east of the island of Kllbbar. Its diameter is 200 yards, and its level 3 or 4 feet above high-water. There are some tufts of grass but no fresh water. The island swarms with sea-birds and is covered in the season with their eggs and young: it is overlaid with a deposit of guano a few inches thick. Qaru is reckoned to the Shaikhdom of Kuwait. A small, but comparatively populous and highly important district in QASIM the very midst of Central Arabia ; in shape it is compact and measures on ^^5 the average about 80 miles across. t' r\ - • i ii n MIDDLE Limits. —(olasim is bounded on the north and north-west by the NAJD* frontier of the Jabal Shammar principality, which runs between the Shammar village of Kahafah on the one side and the Qasim villages of Quwarah and Qusaibah on the other ; on the east it meets the Sa d air district of Southern Najd j on the south-east it is divided from the district of Washam by the desert containing Wadi-as-Sirr j on the south and west it ends where a country of igneous rock begins, a little beyond as- 3 Physical geography, —Qasim is a flat and almost featureless tract. Its elevation above the sea probably varies above and below 2,500 feet, and its surface is thus 1,000 feet lower than the plains of Jabal Shammar. Qasim falls from both sides to the Wadi-ar-Rummah in its centre, of which the slope and direction, within the bounds of Qasim, are downwards from south-west to north-east. Though Qasim contains numerous villages the greater part of it is stony or sandy desert; and a ccidents of s urface are generally insignificant. Where rock protrudes it is information regarding authorities, maps, etc., see the footnote to the title of avticle Najd.I486 QASlM. generally sandstone, the voleanic formations whicli belong- to the territory of Jabal Shammar and girdle Qasim on north, west and south not apparently penetrating within the district. The water table is generally ' high, few wells having a depth of as much as 10 fathoms, but the water is commonly brackish and in many places almost undriukable. Wadi-ar -Rummah is the chief physical feature of the country, but it is scarcely distinguishable, owing to the width and ill-defined character of ^ its bed, from the country on either side of it; more than one European traveller has crossed it without, apparently, becoming aware of its exis- ' tence. Jabal Sarah is a low sandstoce ridge which has its origin in the vicinity of Buraidah and runs thence north-westwards for about 30 miles, the villages of Shiqqah, Qara^ah, ^ Ayun and Rodh lying in bays upon its south side; a little to the west of Rodh it throws off a low spur which is crossed by the road from Buraidah to Samirah in Jabal Shammar. A great plain, called Fuwailik remarkable even in Central Arabia for the unbroken level of its surface, begins on the south side of Jabal Sarah near Rodh and extends westwards for some 25 miles; its breadth however is inferior to its length. A number of the villages of Qasim are situated in remarkable hollows or pits, in which water and loamy soil approach the surface : such are the depressions, several miles in extent, which contain the villages of Quwarah, Qusaibah and 'Ayun, and the valley a little to the west of Buraidah, free of sand though surrounded by desert, along which the plantations of Khabb, Huwailan and Qisar'ah extend for 7 miles; such too is the Sarif hollow to the north-east of Buraidah, which is 5 miles long by a mile broad and like the Khabb valley has a northerly and southerly direction. Certain of the larger deserts which separate the cultivated basins of the villages from one another are known by special names, Among these may be mentioned Batain ^ a tract of which Jabal Sarah possibly forms the scarp on the south-west; it consists towards its southern end of sandstone boulders and towards its northern of round pebbles; not a blade of green is to be seen in its whole extent of 25 miles from Wathal to Qusaibah. Another is Tarmus a wilderness of disintegrated sandstone bearing not a single shrub, which stretches along the border of Qasim between Qusaibah and Kahafah, with a length from east to west of 20 miles and a breadth of 10. Tarmus is remarkable for a small, deep depression near its centre, called Thiqbat-az- Zarraq 3bwhich holds rain water for 3 or 4 months in the year and is adjoined on the south by a small hill named 'Anz y £ .

Climate, products and livestock. —The air of Qasim is often stagnant and sultry. From April to June the weather is warm, with overcast skies and on some days light rain. Pates and cereals—especially wheat, barley, maize and millet—are the principal crops, and both are abundant; the barley harvest is in the end of April. Fruits also are grown, including grapes, pomegranates, figs, citrons, melons and peaches; radishes and onions are among the vegetables ; lucerne is raised in the date groves. Cultivation is everywhere dependent on irrigation from wells which are worked by camels, and in the less favoured localities it is desultory and fluctuating. The usual domestic animals are horses, camels, donkeys, horned cattle, sheep and goats. - -v v - '• .. -- ' &gt; Inhabitants. —A large proportion of the population both in town and country are probably Bani TamilU, and the people may perhaps be assumed to belong to that tribe when no other is specially mentioned. Next in number to the Bani Tamim are the ^Anizah, ''Ataibah, Harb and Mutair, and there are some representatives also of the once renowned tribe of the Bani Khalid. It is possible however that in some cases the connection claimed with well known Bedouin tribes is fanciful. In conse quence of the flatness of tbe country, and of the insecurity of property when Bedouins are about, almost all villages in Qasim are provided with watch towers ; these, when the village, as is often the case, stands in a hallow, are the first indications of its existence to tbe approaching traveller. The Qusman (Singular, Qasimi, or Qasaimi ) or settled inhabitants of Qasim are a prudent, industrious and not unintelligent race; but Wahhabi-ism has soured their disposition, and nowhere does their reputation for hospitality stand high, Qasim furnished a strong contingent of labourers to the original Suez Canal works, and the Qusman are almost the only villagers of Central Arabia who ever take service with the Turks in border provinces ; these are facts which seem to indicate some enterprise and energy. It is said that one of the principal purveyors of camels at Damascus, a supplier at the same time of escorts to Muhammadan pilgrims, is at the present time Bin-Rawwaf, a native 0 f Qasim. Their history and institutions bespeak a sturdy love of freedom among the people of Qasim ; and, though mainly addictedk 1438; [ QASIM to husbandry and trade, their citizen infantry have always borne a bi good name for steadiness in the wars of Najd. The main peculiarity ^odei of dress in Qasim is among the women., who wear sleeves so loose as j has sometimes unexpectedly to expose their persons to view from the i few shoulder to the knee. The men generally wear their hair short. illllDwW ■ A number of the Qusman, but probably less than half, are Wahhabis - ore and, among these, Wahhabi doctrines as late as 1878 carried more weight ^ 0 f than law or civil authority. Y et even then Wahhabi-ism was not really popular, for intercourse with abroad had rendered the people compara tively tolerant, and the word ' c Wahhabi ' had even begun to be used :i among them as a term of abuse applicable to an ill-natured fellow. The Bedouins of Qasim are chiefly Mutair, but the Harband Qahtan also visit the district, and a few Shammar encamp in summer within its !s ^ eC ^ northern border. plW® On the data available the fixed population of Qasim may be roughly ' . , estimated at 45, n 00 souls : if 2,000 be added on account of Bedouins the ' ' „ A ftfictffllj total population will be 47,000. The area of the district being approximately 5,000 square miles, the density of population works out at less than 10 . 1 • • -i -i . . i iimtmei individuals to the square mile. ifcitliecoi Occupations and trade. —Agriculture and the carrying trade are the ateliips principal means of subsistence; the latter, it is calculated, employs one-third ifkciM of the population of Qasim, and the operations of the Qasimi camel masters liffltka extend to Makkah, Madmah, Hail, Baghdad, Basrah, Kuwait and Iiil8J8si Riyadh. Dates, which in Qasim are sold by weight, are commonly exported to Jabal Shammar. and ghi to Makkah ; and in some years, ^ ^ when the rate is favourable, the dates and corn of Qasim find their way to Madinah. There is also an important trade in horses bought from the Bedouins, chiefly with India through Basrah, and horse and jq camel dealing are accounted highly respectable occupations. 'Anaizah, supplied by the Qahtan, and Buraidah, supplied by the Mutair, are the ^ two principal horse markets ; at Buraidah the number of animals is gener- ally larger, while at ^Anaizah they are of better class. ^Anaizah is the principal trade centre, of the country, and further details of the trade and industries of Qasim will be found in the article on that town. Both 'Anaizah and Buraidah are wealthier places than Hail. Usury is | ^ common in Qasim, and agriculturists, and even Bedouins, in the ,« neighbourhood of the towns are frequently burdened with debt ; the cash 1 ^ rate of interest is 15 per cent, a year, and the rate in kind 50 per cent. l0i Al at harvest prices. The weights and measures of Qasim are identical with those of Southern Najd.QASlM 1489 ToliUcal position and administration.—Qi^im has generally enjoyed a virtual autonomy, but at times tlie whole or parts of it have been depen dent or semi-dependent, now on Southern Najd and now on Jabal Shammar. It has frequently played the part of a make-weight, causing the scale to dip on this side or on that in the long contest between the Wahhabi Amir of the south and the Shammar Amir of the north. Qasim is moreover the battle-field of Central Arabia ; but its people, unlike those of Belgium, have ever taken an active and frequently a decisive share in the combats waged upon their own soil. Qasim contains the principal cross-roads of Central Arabia, routes* from Riyadh, Kuwait^ Hail, Madinah and Makkah meeting at Buraidahor 'Anaizah, The internal political constitution of Qasim is loose j but, such as it is, it seems little subject to change under the influence of external events^ and it has outlasted many vicissitudes of foreign war and alliance. The affairs of Qasim are dominated by the great municipalities of 3 naizah and Buraidah, each ruled by an Amir or chief who is in name a tyrant but in practice efiectually restrained by public opinion. Between the twin capitals there is perpetual rivalry and sometimes war; but they are not incapable, in great emergencies, of sinking their differences and taking united action for the common weal. Each stands at the head of a cluster of dependent townships and villages, related to it in various and varying degrees of closeness and subordination; as a rule places south of Wadi- ar -Rummah are thus attached to 'Anaizah and places north of it to Buraidah. In 1878 some of the places subject to Buraidah paid to it a tribute of one-twentieth of their produce, the corn by measure and the dates by weight. About 1878-80 ^Aushaziyah, Shabibiyah, Wadi and Wahlan were included in the 'Anaizah sphere of influence, while that of Buraidah comprised 'Ayun, Bukairiyah, 'Ain Ibn-Fahaid, Hilaliyah, Huwailan, Khabb, Khabrah, Khadhar, Nabqiyah, Qara^ah, Qisai^ah, Qusaibah ^Quwarah, Nabqiyah, Rakaiyah, Rass, Hodh, Rodhat-ar-Rubai'i, Sarif, Shamasiyah, Shiqqah, Tarfiyah and Wathal. The distribution at that period was probably normal, and from the positions of the places mentioned it is easy to infer what must have been the political situation of most of the remainder ; in some cases however the present political con nection is specified in the table below. Between 1874 and 1884 the village of Mudhnib and the Washam town of Shaqrah were also tributary to Buraidah : Mudhnib is still so. The administrative and military system of ''Anaizah is described in the article upon that town, and the system at Buraidah is similar. * See article ad Jin, 5 c14 .90 QASlM There is at present (1906) a Turkish cantonment at Shaihiyah and small Turkish garrisons are stationed in 'Anaizah and Buraidah ; in all but name, however, the district is still independent.

Kemp, R.N., in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for Jiilyl9&lt;i2; Captain H. Smyth's Reconnaissance Report, 19(H. in Foreign Proceedings for February 1905; and a report, dated 24th Jnlv 1905, by Cap'ain E. W. S. Mahon, E.E., relating particularly, as does also the last, to the si itability of TJmm Qasr as a terminus for the proposed Baghdad railway. Detfiiled information was also supplied by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, IA., who visued the place in 1904. Tne most recent authority is however Coninifinder W. G. BeauchMmp, R.I.M., whose report was f'orw irded to the Govern ment of India by Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, with a demi-official letter, dated the 20th November 1906 ; the results of Commander Beauchamp's survey are embodied in Cnart No. 23bl—3293 (1907 edition).1504 QASR (TJMM) 1111' For 6 miles above Warbah island the inlet on which Umm Qasr stands is on the average three-qnarters of a mile broad and its depth Ljfev varies from 6 to 9 fathoms : at 6 miles it divides into two branches, one Lg T of which runs for a short distance (perhaps 3 miles) north-westwards, l0 e ] narrowing as it goes; while the other continues northwards in the jg ] direction of Basrah. The former branch at low tide is a mere : J a mud-flat with a channel not more than 3 or 4 feet deep close to its wes- tern bank ; but the branch which runs northwards continues undivided, with a depth generally exceeding 7 fathoms, for a distance of 14 miles ' and then splits into two arms of minor importance. Of these arms one, going north-north-east, reaches to within 12 miles of the Shatt-al ^Arab at Abul Khasib with soundings of 3| fathoms and over; while the second, going north-north-west, has its head only 11 miles south of Basrah and 10 miles east-south-east of Zubair Town; but it is narrower and much shallower than the other. Nowhere within Khor Umm Qasr or Zubair is the navigation easy, for the channel is winding and the banks are submerged and disappear at high tide. ^ There is some doubt as to the true nomenclature of these waterways; ^ but the main inlet for 6 miles above Warbah island appears to hp known locally as Khor-ath-Tha^alab jjA } the small branch run- ning to the north-west as Khor Umm Qasr, and the large branch running to the north as Khor Zubair. Umm Qasr proper is situated about 1 mile above the point where Nrt 1 the inlet first divides and about half a mile inland from the western JJJ ^ bank of the western branch (Khor Umm Qasr) ; the usual landing-place, however, is opposite to the point of separation of the branches. The iiy oa country to the east of the main inlet and to the north of Khor ^ Abdullah appears to be a marsh several miles in extent; but it is possible from ^™ lfi Hamdan on the Shatt-al -^Arab to reach, without leaving terra firma, a point about 5 miles east of Umm Qasr proper. The only building at Umm Qasr proper : is now a small Turkish fort, V garrisoned by an infantry detachment from Basrah of about 30 men ' ifsefec f under an officer. The fort is nearly square, measuring about 120 feet each ^ ^ way, and having one entrance in the middle of the north face: a recently ifp^j j constructed salient on the west side enfilades two faces. The walls are 15 Acoaiili feet high, loop-holed at feet from the ground, and are built chiefly of Jj! 'M mud : but the gateway and coping of the wall are of burnt bricks. There are wells with a plentiful supply of water to the northward, opposite the entrance to the fort at &amp;50 yards distance, and the water used by the garrison is sweet: whether it is obtained from these wells or from KasjQATAR 1505 elsewhere is uncertain. No supplies are obtainable at Umm Qasr and not even vegetables are grown; there is grazing for sheep, but not for horses. The wells are a favourite camping ground of Bedouins. At 300 yards to the east of the Turkish fort are the remains of an old Arab Qasr. The ground in the neighbourhood is firm and gravelly. Umm Qasr is 15 miles east-south-east of Safwan and about 34 miles south and a little east of Basrah. ; there are no wells on the direct route from Zubair to Umm Qasr, and travellers between Basrah and Umm Qasr ordinarily pass through Zubair and Safwan. Frequently pronounced Gatar, and sometimes spoken of as Barr-al- Qatar ^ksUI^ especially when the reference is to the interior rather than to the coast. Qatar is a remarkable tongue of land projecting from the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf midway between its entrance at Ras Musandam and its head at the mouth of the Shatt- * The bulk of the information contained in this principal article on Qat ; .r, and in the minor articles subordinate thereto, was obtained expressly for this Gazetteer during tlie years 1904-07 ; previously little was known regarding the promontory. The data at the time existing were condensed by the writer in November 1904 into 6 foolscap pages of print, which formed the basis of the subsequent investigations. The further enquiry was begun by the writer in Bahrain early in 1905, was continue d y Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Political Assistant in the Persian Gulf, and was completed by Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent in Bahrain, in tbe same year ; the greater part of the information obtained was supplied by the last named officer. A set of draft articles was then compiled by the writer, which extended to nearly 40 printed octavo pages and was ready at the end of 1905; it was sent to Captain Prideaux for revision, a process which occupied a considerable part of the year 1906. Early in 1907 the diaft, improved and somewhat amplified, was reprinted, and investigations for the purpose of clearing up uncertain points continued to be made by Captain Prideaux throughout the year. Previous to these recent enquiries, as already remarked, there was a deficiency of information concerning Qatar. The principal authorities up to 1904 were Bombay eections XXIV, 1856, Palgrave's Central and Eastern Arabia, 1865, and the . erHan Qulf Pilot, 1898, of which the last was the most valuable. The mo«t important public contribution to a knowledge of Qatar since 1904 is Herr H. Bur- chardt's article Ost-Arahien von Basra his MasJcat, 1906. fhe best small scale map of Qatar is that issued with the present Gazetteer, superseding the Map of Parts of Arabia and Persia, 1883 ; as regards the interior ie new map is founded on a Rough Map of the Qatar Peninsula, 1907, by Capraia ndeaux from native information, which is filed in the Library of the Foreign Slmla, 38 1368 ' Tlie onl y cllarfc showing the whole Qatar coast is . o74-2837 B., Persian Gulf-, but a portion of that coast is included in Prelirainarv No. O. 2, Bahrein to Bas Bah kip, Poona, 1903. 5 D1506 QATAR al-'Arab: the axis of Qatar runs due north , and south, and the promontory as a whole measures about 85 miles in length by about 40 in breadth. Boundaries. —On the east, north and west Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak: thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north-east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east bv south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-'Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al- 'Odaid, and as the A1 Thani Shaikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-^Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial 'Oman, though the A1 Thani Shaikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men, stationed at Dohat-as-Salwaj Sakak, and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea. Physical characteristics. —The interior of Qatar has only once been visited by a European but its nature is tolerably well known from native accounts, and a list of the chief wells and camping grounds is given in this article: the principal features of the coast line also are enumerated and described below. Practically the whole promontory consists of undulating rocky and pebbly desert, and the northern part at least is very low ; the level of the rest is generally higher than that of Bahrain Island. The only hill of any importance is Jabal-at-Tawar. Wells are numerous, and in winter there are also many pools of water among the rocks. The soil is poor, consisting in the best localities of gravel and marl mixed with sand; fields and date groves there are almost none, and such gardens as exist near towns and villages are small and unproductive, while hardly a tree is to be seen anywhere. The only natural vegetation is coarse grass, growing in tufts upon the sandhills, and stunted brushwood in places. The climate is dry, and at a few miles inland the air appears to be entirely destitute of moisture; nevertheless the rainfall appears * Viz., the German traveller Herr H. Burchardt, who traversed Qatar from Dobat- as-Salwa to Dohall via Mukamis in January 1904. In December 1905 Capt. F. B.

It will be observed that a few gardens are the only places permanently occupied which are not situated upon the coast: this also is a noteworthy circumstance. The people, —The inhabitants of Qatar, as of most of the districts or* the western shore of the Persian Gulf, may be conveniently classified as fixed and nomadic. The sedentary population consists of a number of different communities and tribes of which nearly all are common to Qatar and the Bahrain islands; the following table gives its composition in some detail | Name of tribe or commu nity. Number ol souls in Qatar. Where found in Qatar. 'Ainain (Al Bu) 2,000 Wakrah. *Ali (Al Bin-) 1,750 Bohah. 'AmSmarah 200 Dohah and Wakrah.1632 QATAR Of the tribes mentioned above the Hamaidat and the MaMndah appear to be peculiar to Qatar. The settled population of Qatar—that ; namely, of the towns of Dohah and Wakrah and of the villages of Dha'Sin, Dhakhirah, Abn Dhaluf, Fuwairat, Hadiyah, Khor Hassan, Lusail, Ruwais, Khor Shaqiq and Sumaismah, together with the Turkish military garrison at Dohah and a few families of negro gardeners at 2 or 3 small gardens in the interior—cannot be far short of 27,000 souls, A considerable proportion of the settled tribes of Qatar go into camp in the interior in winter with their flocks and herds. The Bedouins properly belonging to Qatar are the Bani Hajir and the small Ka'aban tribe of whom about 60 families usually roam there, A large body of the Na'im of Trucial 'Oman, however, have become detached from the parent stock and now fluctuate between Bahrain and Qatar. Qatar is also visited by Al Morrah from Hasa and in the cold weather by Manasir from Trucial 'Oman; 'Ajman too are sometimes seen, but not frequently. The inhabitants of Qatar—whether townspeople, villagers or Bedouins—are Maliki Sunnis in religion, From this statement we must however except the Sudan and a few of the Ma^adhld, who are Hanbalis ; the Sadah, who are Hanafis and Shafi^is; the Baharinah and Persians, who are not Sunnis but Shi'ahs ; and the Arabs of Najd who are Wahhabis. Negroes generally follow the religion of their masters. Occupations, resources and trade, —The principal and almost the exclusive source of livelihood in Qatar is pearl-fishing, supplemented in some places by the breeding of camels. Agriculture hardly exists. The only date palms—and they are not numerous—appear to be those in the gardens at Laqtah, Markhiyah, Mushairib, Na'aijah, Sakak, Sakhamah and Wakrah ; and it is not clear that any vegetable gardens exist except at some of the same places, A few semi-wild clumps of dates are found on the west coast near Dohat-as-Salwa. Besides camels the settled villagers have a few horses and cattle, which they keep in their own possession, and some sheep and goats which are tended for them by the Bedouins^ They also fish along the coast of the district. These remarks are not intended to apply to the Bedouins of Qatar, who are pastoral in their habits, like the rest of their race elsewhere, and own livestock in the proportions usual among Arab nomads.QATAR 1533 A tabular estimate o£ the principal resources of Qatar follows below, from which the property of Bedouius is excluded: — Town or village.

The Qatar pearl fleet carries about 13,000 men, the average crew of each pearl boat being* about 16 men. Such foreign trade as Qatar possesses is carried on chiefly with Bahrain and Lingeh. Pearls are the only export of value. Routes, As may be judged from the remarks above on the physical characteristics of the promontory and from the table of wells, travel is not more difficult in Qatar than in any other barren but open country which is without inhabitants but not altogether without water. The lines of movement from point to point are generally optional, but caravans from Hofuf in Hasa to Dahah in Qatar after leaving the Ba'aij wells in Hasa generally proceed by the wells of ^Araicj-al-Janubi, Kara anah, Mukainis and Sailiyah, giving 5 stages between Ba^aij and Dohall of 2^0, 12, 15, 6 and 14 miles respectively, or 67 miles in all. Political conditions.— Vnox to 1766 A.D. the peninsula of Qatar, it is believed, was included in the dominions of the Bani Khalid Shaikhs,QATAB wkosjB head-quarters were at that time in Hasa and whose jurisdiction then extended as far north as Kuwait; and it is probable that the 'Utub, when they arrived at Zubarah in 1766, found the A1 Musallam occupying a pre-eminent, though not a paramount position in the country. In the course of about 20 years the pre-eminence of the A\ Musallam appears to have been transferred to the 'Utub ; but the attention of the latter was for some time held in another quarter by their conquest of Bahrain. By the middle of the 19th century, however, the Shaikh of Bahrain had established a suzerainty—more apparent than real—over Qatar, and was represented at Bida' (D5hah) by a political agent who was a member of his own family. In 1868 direct negotia tions took place between the British Government and the tribal Shaikhs of Qatar j. and, in the result, the interest of the Shaikh of Bahrain in Qatar was limited to the receipt of tributes probably on behalf of the Wahhabi Government of Najd. In 1872 the Turks established a garrison in D5hah ; and with the cessation of the Wahhabi Zakat the political connection, such as it was, between Bahrain and Qatar came to an end. At the present time the Turks are still in occupation of D5hah, which they hold with a regular infantry battalion, nominally 350 strong, commanded by a Bimbashi or Major; there are also 2 old guns. The title of the Porte to the ownership or possession of &gt;ny part of the Qatar promontory is not admitted by the British Government; but want of British recognition has not prevented the Turks from acquiring strict control over the foreign relations of the Shaikh of Dohah— a control which possession of the Dohah fort enables them to enforce without difficulty. Otherwise Turkish authority in Qatar is merely nominal extending to little or no distance beyond the walls of their military posts*; nor does the pretence of government at D5hah go beyond the conferment by them on the Shaikh of Dohah, a junior member of the A1 Thani family, the Turkish title of ' Qaim-Maqam of QatarOccasional efforts have been made by the Turkish autho rities to introduce a Turkish official as &lt;c Assistant Qaim-Maqam/' but these as yet have been unsuccessful, and matters which arise in the town continue to be disposed of by the Shaikh, or, if of a legal nature, by the local Qadhi. It is reported that a Rais-al-Liman or Turkish harbourmaster is about to be appointed at Dohah. In 1903 the Porte were about to attempt the establishment of Mudirates in charge * The evidence of the German traveller Herr H. Burchardt is conclusive on this point; the position of the garrison in 1904 even struck him as precarious,QA.TIF OASIS um of Turkish officials at Wakrah and Zubarah, but thQy desisted in deference to a protest by the British Government. Communication between the Turkish garrison and the outside world appears to be kept up by means of a letter post exchanged monthly with Hofuf across the desert. The A1 Thani family of the Ma'adhid tribe, to whom reference has just been made, are the natural leaders among the Shaikhs of Qatar; their authority however is not by any means absolute or despotic through out the district. The present senior member of the family is Jasim-bin- Muhammad-bin-Thani 5 who usually resides at Lusail or in the interior 1 to be out of the way of the Turks; and the coast from Lusail to Khor-al- 'Odaid may perhaps be regarded as strictly subject to his rule. ■'Abdur B^hman, the governing Shaikh of Wakrah, is Jasinr's third son ; and 'Abdullah, recognised as Shaikh of Dohah both by his own father and by the Turks, is 'Abdur Rahman's next brother. Jasim from being a Maliki Sunni has become a Hanbali, that is to say, a proselyte to Wahhabi-ism, and has carried a portion of his tribe with him his change of belief. The Shaikhs of Qatar are said to exact forced labour under the name of Sukhrah ^ from foreigners and poor Bedouins in their jurisdictions ; and occasionally they compel their tribesmen to work ^ out of kindness [i.e., without pay) for the public good. There are now no Indian or other British subjects anywhere in Qatar. A well watered maritime tract in the Sanjaq of Hasa, the counter- QATIF part upon the coast of the larger and richer Hasa Oasis in the interior. Position and extent—THowis of Qatif immediately adjoins the coast for a short distance on both sides of the town of the same name : on the east it is hounded by the sea, and on the other sides it is enclosed by the large desert tract of Biyadli, except at its south end upon the coast where it meets Barr-adh -Dhahran. The oasis extends about 9 miles north and the same distance south of Qatif Town and has thus a total length of about 18 miles ;its depth from the coast inland is on the average about 3 miles. * The principal authorities, maps, etc.. on this tract awmcluded among those speqified in a footnote to the title of the general article on the Hasa PW a&lt; l-1636 QATlF OASIS Physical characteristics and climate, —The greater part of the Qatif Oasis is a sandy plain, saturated with spring water and raised only a few feet above the level of the sea. The springs are not warm like those of the Hasa Oasis, but the source from which they are supplied is doubtless the same—the drainage, namely, of Southern Najd which disappears underground in the Dah^nah desert and the Sah^bah tract. There are also various marshes producing reeds, especially in the north about Safwa and Umm-as-Sahak. Not the whole area comprehended by the boundaries above described is cultivated. On the south cultivation ends altogether in the latitude of Saihat, or about 6 miles south of Qatif Town, and to the north and north-westwards it is somewhat dispersed ; the villages of Safwa Umm-as-Sahak and Lajam stand, as it were, in separate small oases of their own, and these are divided from one another and from the main oasis by intervals of 2 or 3 miles. The intervals are occupied partly by sandhills, but partly also by the marshes already mentioned. Throughout Qatif generally the atmosphere is denser and heavier, the heat more oppressive, and the vegetation ranker and more luxuriant than in the twin oasis of Hasa. The climate of Qatif is damp and unhealthy, and the results of malarial fever are manifest in the sallow complexion and poor physique of the inhabitants. Population and inhabited p^c^.—The settled population of the Qatif Oasis is not large; it may be reckoned at 26,000 souls in all, viz., 5,000 in the town proper of Qatif, 5,000 more in the suburbs of the same, and 16,000 in the remaining villages of the oasis, which are 17 in number. Except some non-nomadic Bani Khalid chiefly at Umm-as- Sahak and a few Huwalah and Turkish officials and troops at Qatif Town—who are Sunnis—the people of the oasis are by race nearly all Baharinah and by religion Shfahs. There are some negroes, both enslaved and free, who have been included for statistical purposes in the communities with whom they live or by whom they are owned; in religion the great majority of these are Shfahs. The 'Utub, who a century ago dominated the district along with the rest of the coast on both sides of it and later were displaced by the Wahhabis, have now entirely disappeared. In addition to the sedentary population some Bedouins, chiefly of the Bani Hajir, Bani Khalid and 'Awazim tribes, frequent the oasis and are held in fear by the timid Baharinah. It is reported that nearly every male adult in the villages of the oasis possesses a®rifle.5 ? QATIF OASIS 1537 pfsW aiecrfi' 1 !

Sadriyah helps to irrigate the plantations of Qudaih. Taibah (ujkk) Close to the north side of 'Awamiyah village. One of the various sources of irri gation belonging to 'Awamiyah. Agriculture and UvestocJc. —Dates are the staple crop in Qatif^ no village being without its date grove; the water irrigating the plantations is in some places brackish, but this does not appear to afreet the trees injuriously^ and the total annual yield of dates in the oasis is computed at 24,000 tons. Cultivation other than dates—mostly wheat, barley and rice—is inconsiderable. Fruits are abundant and of fair quality; they include pomegranates, figs; peaches ; grapes, bitter limes and citrons: besides these there are musk and water melons, the last sometimes of gigantic si^e, and a few mangoes are produced at Saili§,t. Vegetables of many sorts are grown. Domestic animals are the same as in the H^SSt Oasis. Transport animals in the possession of villagers are estimated at 50 horses, 200 donkeys of the famous white Hasa breed, and 650 donkeys of ordinary breeds ; the last are small and generally grey or dark in colour.qatif oasis Gommunications, transport and supplies, —The only important rouie is that from Qatif Town to Hofuf, which lies for a short way only in the oasis ; it is de^lt with in the article on the Hasa Sanjaq. There is no definite information as to the quantity of transport and supplies locally available; but the resources of the district may be roughly gauged by means of the village table and the remarks on agriculture and livestock above. Manufactures, trade, civil administration and military arrange ments. —These matters are disposed of in the general article on the Hasa Sanjaq, except the trade in dates, the nature of which is explained by the following table:— Quantity in tons. Disposal. Rbmabks. 2,500 Exported to Bahrain. For local consumption in Bahrain. 12,500 Exported to 'Oman and Persia. 4,000 Exported to India, partly direct and partly vib Bahrain. These are boiled dates. 5,000 Locally consumed in tho Qatif Oasis. ... The sea customs of the Qatif Oasis were leased in 1904-05 for a sum equivalent to £4,230 sterling ; and in the following financial year a larger amount was obtained. QATIF TOWN Site and marine approaches, — Qatif town stands on the shore of the bay which reaches from Ras Tanurah to Dammam and may be called Uatit Bay. The coast at this point runs nearly north and south ; and Tarut island, in the bay, bears east-north-east from the town at a distance of about % miles. The principal place and only considerable town in the Qatif Oasis; it is situated on the coast of Eastern Arabia about 230 miles south-east by south of Kuwait Town, 36 miles north-west by west of the nearest part of Bahrain Island, and 64 miles north by west of 'Oqair Port.QATIF TOWN landing at Qatif is inconvenient; for boats of over 6 feet draft cannot in any circumstances reach an inner berth. The reef opposite the town extends about 10 miles to seawards ; and upon it, 2 miles east of the town, is an islet carrying a small and ruinous but conspi cuous fort, of which the name is Burj Abul Lif cixUI . On the north side of Burj Abul Lif 3 channels leading from the open sea converge; two of them are in the shore reef and come from the south east and east respectively, the second of these passing immediately south of Tarut island ; the third approach is round the north side of Tarut, but it is only practicable at high water. From the basin in which these three channels unite, a single passage conducts landwards to the town and a passenger by boat feels as if he were ascending a river. The berth of Turkish Government vessels calling at Qatif is just within Kas Tanurallj at a place where the Ottoman Government maintains a coal dep6t, upon the side of the cape nearer to Tarut island : this anchorage is 10 miles east-north-east of Qatif Town, Tarut island being between, and the circumstance helps to illustrate the defects of Qatif as a port. Town and sulurhs. —The town proper consists of a Kut or forti fied quarter, and of a long bazaar outside but connected with it ; and besides these there are various suburbs. The Kut, called also QaFat-al-Qatif, is surrounded by a bastioned wall 30 feet high and presents a front, about 400 yards long and containing a gate, to the sea; the shorter faces on the north and south measure about 300 yards each. There are gates also in the western and southern faces, the former opening on the suburb of Bab-ash-Shamal, to which it gives its name, and the latter leading into a cemetery. The froh.t of the Kut is almost upon the beach ; but between the gate and the sea are a pier and the Port Office of Qatif, and a building known as Mansur Pasha^s house stands at the water's edge a short distance to the south of them. Immediately to the north of the Kut is a dense forest of date palms, and on the west and south sides are suburbs which will be mentioned further on. The whole space within the walls of the Kut is filled by about 700 houses, mostly constructed of stone and gypsum mortar but a small proportion of them mere huts. There are no shops in the Kut; but the Turkish Government offices stand in its extreme south-eastern corner, and a minaret of considerable height towards the southern end is one of the most conspicuous objects at Qatif *QATIF TOWN The bazaar, joining on externally to the south-western corner of tlie Kut; runs due south for quarter of a mile to the suburb of Kawaikib in which it ends; it is built of stone and lime; is roofed, and contains about ,300 shops. There is also a quarter known as Fariq-al-Maqbarah perhaps from its adjoining a graveyard which is situated on the east side of the bazaar, between the bazaar and the south wall of the Kut. The principal suburbs are Bab-ash-Shamal, immediately outside the back gate of the Kut; Jarari, 200 yards west of Bab-ash-Shamal; Madaris, 200 yards west of the Kut end of the bazaar; Maiyas, a similar distance west of the middle of the bazaar ; Dabaibiyah, i of a mile south-west of Maiyas; Kawaikib, at the south end. of the bazaar ; and Shari'ah, a little east of the middle of the bazaar, between it and the sea. All of these are capable of being regarded as distinct villages and they have accordingly been described, each under its own name, in the general article on the Qatlf Oasis. The ground between Bab-ash- Sjhamal, Jarari and Madaris is open; that between Madaris^ Maiyas and the bazaar is occupied by enclosed yards and godowna; that between Maiyas, the bazaar and Kawaikib is open. l)efeiices. —There are no defences except the wall of the Kut. The Turkish garrison of Qatif consists of a detachment of 50 infantry furnished by the battalion at ^Anik. Population, —The total population of Qatif town, inclusive of the 7 suburban villages of which the names have been given, is estimated at 10,000 souls; or, without the suburbs, at 5,000. Nearly all the inhabit ants belong to the class called Baharinah and are consequently Shfahs by religion ; but there are a few Huwalah artisans, who are Sunnis, and to the latter sect must be reckoned most of the Turkish oMcials, but these^ are not many. There are no Oriental Christians or Jews, neither are there any permanently settled Persians. British subjects, even Indians, are entirely absent. OccwpationSy manufactures and Uade.^^omQ of the people engage in pearling and 13 pearl boats belong to tlie town, of which 4 are owned in the Fariq-al- JVl aqbarah quarter and 4 and 5 respectively in the Suburbs of Dabaibiyah and Kawaikib. There are no manufactures of importance at Qatif. As a port and market Qatif serves only the oasis in which it stands and the nomad country dependent on the same ; it does not compete with 'Oqair for the foreign trade of the Hasa Oasis or Najd. The principalQAWASIM J54J exports of Qatif are dates to Bahrain, largely for the Indian market, to 'Oman and to Persia; date syrup to Bahrain, Trucial ^Oman and Persia; date branches for firewood to Bahrain and Persia ; fuller's earth, used for ablution^ to Bahrain and Basrah J reeds for mat-making to Bahrain } hides to Bahrain and Persia ; and finally, Qatif Town being a market of the Kuwait pearling fleet, a quantity of pearls and mother-of-pearl shells to Bahrain and some to Bombay. The imports of Qatif are mostly from Bahrain, through which come rice, coffee, piece-goods, spices, sugar and metals, these being to a great extent of Indian origin ; but unhusked rice is also received from Basrah and wheat from Persia. Qatif traders visit Bahrain periodically to bay goods and there are some Bahraini merchants settled at Qatif ; but inconsiderate treatment and insufficient protection by Turkish officials have brought about the removal of the Hiadu traders at this port, who before the Turkish occupation numbered 70 or more and had a share estimated at 15 lakhs of rupees annually in the trade of the place. There is a small direct trade with India, the goods consigned in both directions being transhipped at Bahrain. Govemment.-~ r i\iQ place of Qatif in the civil and military adminis tration of the Hasa Sanjaq is described in the article under that name : it is the headquarters of the Qatif Qadha. Dhabitiyahs actually present in the town, for duty there, number 20 to 30. The port is in charge of a Turkish Rais-al-Liman or harbourmaster. Generally pronounced Jawasim and sometimes even spelt ; the QAWASIM singular is Qasimi or Jasimi This is the family (or small /^!) 3 tribe) to which the ruling Shaikh of Sharjah and his relations belong i they claim to be Shurafa descended from the family of the prophet Muhammad. •; At the present time the genuine Qawasim in Trucial ^Onlan number only 18 adult males, viz., 5 at Sharjah Town/ including the Shaikh himself; 8 at Ras-al -Khaimah Town, including a son of the Shaikh who is Deputy-Governor of that place; 2 at 'Ajman, namely, . ^ cou sin of the Shaikh who holds the Shamailiyah district in fief and his son; and 3 at Hamriyah, viz., an exiled uncle of the Shaikh and his two sons. Outside Trucial 'Oman, for example on the Batinah coast, the objects of Sharjah generally are sometimes spoken of as Jawasigi, and.1648 QAWASIM a tribe which has submitted to the Shaikh of Sharjah is said to have become J asimi '; to this fact is probably due the indiscriminate application^ in old British records, of the term 'Joasmee' * to all the piratical inhabitants of what is now Trucial 'Oman. The trucial flag of 1820 unfortunately come to be known (and is still known) as the Jasimi flag, and the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi have consequently always shown a certain disinclination to fly it. A tribe of Qawasim, by some supposed to be identical with the Qawasim of Trucial 'Oman, are found in the ' Oman Sultanate at Miltiqa in Wadi Samail, at Nafa^ah in Wadi Mansah, in WadiRisail, at Falaj-al-Hijari in the sub-Wilayat of Saham in Batinah ; afc Mizra'-al-^Alowi in Wadi Maih, and at Bandar Jissah on the coast of the Masqat District. According to some authorities, however, these Qawasim are a section of the Nidabiyin. Other Qawasim, about 650 souls, occur at Duwan in the Lingeh District of the Persian Coast. QISHM t ^ s0 pronounced Jishm, and by Arabs occasionally styled Jazirat-at- Tawilah The largest and most important of all the ISLAND i B ^ an ^ s Persian Gulf ; it is situated off the coast of the Persian districts of Bastak and Shamil, which it subtends from Lingeh almost to Bandar J Abbas, and is divided from the mainland by the channel 1 to 15 miles in breadth known to British mariners as Clarence Strait. The islands of Larak and Hanjam may be regarded as being physically appendages of Qishm. Size and configuration. —The extreme length of Qishm from east- north-east to west-south-west is 68 miles; its average breadth is difficult to calculate on account of the irregularity of its outline, but may be roughly stated at 10 miles, though in one place, nearly abreast of the adjoining island of Hanjam, it actually exceeds 20. The shape of Qishm is some what that of a fi^h, the eastern end representing the head, the western end the tail, and Laft point a projecting dorsal fin. The coast is * This term, it may be observed, is in any case an ungrammatical compromiBe between &lt;e Jasimi' and ' Jawaaim. ' fA monograpb on Qishm island by Lieutenant V. Hunt will be found in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for May 1901; and the marine surround ings of Qishm are best shown in Chart No- 1375—753, Entrance of the Persian Gulf. There is another report by Captain W. Grey in the Proceedings for June 1904. In the writings of the mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers Qishm appears to figure under the names of Bani Kanan, Abarkafan, Abarkuman and Laft: its inhabitants in those days were hardy sailors, much given to piracy ; vide Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate.QISHM ISLAND 1549 generally rocky : its two principal salients are Laft point and Khargn point, both about the centre of the island, the former on the northern, the latter on the southern coast. Khargu point is low and rocky, but Dairistan bay to the west of it is sandy and has swamps behind it. Has Dastakan the south-western point of the island, is also low and rocky : Basidu point, the westmost, is described in the aiticle on Basidu. HilU and geology. —Qishm is nearly covered with table-topped hills of a light brown colour, having broken-down sides and in some cases of very remarkable appearance; there is however a general absence of dominant or characteristic peaks. The land which rises immediately behind Qishm Town continues increasing in elevation till, at one point 3 miles west of the town, it reaches 560 feet; it then falls away abruptly to a low plain which reaches across the island from sea to sea and is several miles in breadth. Beyond the plain the hills recommence, but without any remark able features until Kishkuh the highest summit on Qishm with an elevation of 1,300 feet, is reached at about 17 miles from Basidu and nearly in the middle of the island. About 3 miles west of Kisbkuh a range of dark red hills with patches of slate colour crosses the island from north to south; where it abuts upon the southern coast, with which it is in contact for 5 miles, it contains great salt-caverns and is known by the name of Namakdan ^1^3. The largest cave is at the eastern end of Namakdan; it is over 200 feet in height, is about as deep as it is high, and has a span of 60 or 70 feet.* The general geological formation of the island is the same as that of the adjoining coasts. The upper strata are of coarse sandstone grit and con glomerate, supported by a blue lias marl and interrupted in one place by the salt hills already described : the aspect of the whole island is that of a plateau rising by a perpendicular scarp from the sea beach and eroded by weather into many valleys, some of which are parallel to the coast. Mora and fauna. —The surface of the island along the southern coast has the bleak and barren appearance generally associated, in this part of the world, with the formation to which it belongs. Qishm is in fact, apart from its villages, almost a desert; but the hills contain some wild goats, black and grey partridges and pigeons, and the plains some gazelle. # This cave, with the methods of working, and the Namakdan generally are described by Pelly in the Bombay Geographical Journal, Volume XVII, 1865, pages 239-— 241.1550 QIS&amp;M ISLAND Inhahifants.—^e population, including Qislnn Town, amounts to about 13,500 souls. Nearly all are Arabs by race and Sunnis by religion; but there are Persian communities at Qishm Town and Diraku, who together may number 500 souls and among whom also the Sunni form of Islam prevails. The Arabs belong for the most part to tribes of Trucial 'Oman, but their tribal divisions are not here of much importance ; the Shaikh of the island belongs to a tribe called Bani Ma'in or Mu'ain yjM w ho are said to be connected with the Shammar of Najd and number in Qishm Town about 100 persons, and of whom a few belonging to a section called Shaqosh are found at 'Ajman in Trucial 'Oman. The population of Qishm is said to have been considerably reduced by a severe earthquake which in 1898 visited Qishm and levelled many villages with the ground. Arabic is the language of the island. Besources. —Salt is the only natural product of value, but most of the villages possess date-groves and some have small expanses of cultivation, these forming the only verdurous spots. Fishing, navigation and boat-building are the principal occupations, Qishm Town and Laft village being centres of the last mentioned industry j but there is also some weaving of Liingis and Chadars, and some villages are given up to camel-breeding and stock-rai sing Shipping. —The following is a table of the native craft belonging to Qishm;— Kind.

Political position. —Qishm island is held in farm by the Mu^in-ut- Tujjar of Tehran, whose authority is concurrent with a general political control exercised by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Deputy- Governor 6f Bandar 'Abbas occasionally attempts to assert jurisdiction over the island, but his authority is not respected. The local chief through whom the general administration is carried on is the Shaikh of Qishm, who resides at Qishm Town and is an Arab of the Bani Ma^in tribe, at present Shaikh Hasan. The Persian central government is un&gt; represented save by officials of the Imperial Customs at Qishm Town^ Laft , Dairistan and Suzeh.

Water is sweet from reservoirs, but supplies are scanty. There are 200 date trees. The chief place and only town in Qishm Island^ on the easternmost QISHM extremity of which it is situated. The town stands on a fairly level, sandy site close to the water's edge; it has a small date-plantation on TOWN either side of it and several domed water reservoirs at a short distance to southward. Behind it and to the south of it the land rises in a gradual slope from the sea; the hill thus formed breaks off precipitously on the north and west. Qishm is a well-built town and formerly contained several high Badgirs reaching 50 to 60 feet above sea-level, but they were destroyed by an earthquake in 1898 ; there is an old Portuguese fort now m a ruinous condi tion. A number of the private houses in the town still bear witness to the violence of the earthquake, and many of the inhabitants still avoid residence in stone-built houses. There are several wells in and about the town ; but only one ; which is about 1 mile from the fort, furnishes good water : 7 Birkehs also exist for storing rainwater and these generally suffice for the needs of the population. The climate is cooler than that of Bandar 'Abbas. The population imiy amount to ^000 souls and comprises luO families of Persians, of whom 8 are 'Avazis, and 2 of Hindus (goldsmiths); the remainder of the people are Arabs of the same tribes as occupy the rest of the island. The inhabitants are mostly engaged in fishing, in trade, in boat-building and in the weaving of Lungis. The chief exports are dried fish, shark-fins, Lungis salt, and a small quantity of ghi collected from the villages of the island ; the1558 QISHM TOWN leading 1 imports are rice from Bombay or Karachi^ piece-goods, planks and beams, coffee and sugar. Some common pottery is manufactured from local clay. Date-palms number about 900 and livestock are a few camels, 30 donkeys, 60' cattle and 200 sheep and goats. The bazaar contains 47 general shops, besides which there are 19 fish shops. The shipping of the port (included in that of Qishm Island q. v.) is considerable ; but there is no harbour, and off the town there are several reefs of rock and sand. Vessels of moderate or large size must anchor a mile or more from the beach, but there they are fairly well sheltered from tbe pre vailing winds.* Qishm is the seat of a Shaikh who, under the Persian authorities, has executive power over the whole island, but cannot inflict the penalty of death. The town possesses a Madrasah in which advanced instruction in Arabic and theology is said to be given. &amp; il QITAB (BANI) I'his or Qatab (rather than Kitab or Katab) appears to be the correct form of the name, though colloquially it seems to be sometimes pronounced Chitab or Chatab : the singular is Qitbi The Bani Qitab are an Arab tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial and Inde- dent 'Oman^ having a considerable range over the 'Oman Promontory and extending into the district of Dhahirah. They are divided into the following sections : - Sectidn. Locatioil. Fightiug strength. B emabks.

The limits of the Bani Qitab Bedouin territory are the northern end of the Dhaid plain, the towns of Sharjah and Dibai; the Baraimi Oasis and the western slope of the hills of the 'Oman promontory. These Bedouins do not as a rule enter the hills, but they occasionally send their women and children and flocks and herds thither for asylum in time of danger. The fighting men of the nomadic sections boing estimated at 600, the total strength of those sections may be assessed at 2-, 100 souls ; and they are believed to own about L3Q0 camels, 200 donkeys, 200 cattlej and 2,000 sheep and goats. The Bani Qitab have recently been recognised by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi^ the most powerful chief in Trucial 'Oman, as clients of the Shaikh of Umm -al -Qaiwain and entitled to claim the protection of that ruler. # Either the number of the Mugharibah fighting men is greatly imdere^tiroated Lsre or other settled sections must be represented at A-flaj Bani Qitab : see page 429.1560 QOR (WADI-AL-) OOR A vaUey which rises in the hills of the 'Oman Promontory between (WADI-AL-) Wadis Hatta and Ham and reaches the sea at Bu Baqarah village in Batinah: it is the last Wadi of flajar in this direction of which any part is included in the 'Oman Sultanate.

At Ihe head of the 'Wadi, above the highest village, are camping-places of Beck, lins of the Bani Ka ab and other tribes. Of the settled inhabit-QtlA'AH 1561 ants about 400 appear to be subjects of the Sultan of ; 0lliail and 250 of the Shaikh of Sharjah. Native informers state that the gradients of Wadi-al-Qor are easy and that there is no rugged pass at the top ; they believe that a road for wheeled traffic could be made up the valley without great difficulty, but the point must be regarded as doubtful. The route from Murair to Dhaid lies for the first part of the way in Wadi-al-Qor. A barren sandy tract in the Kuwait Principality, bounded on the QRA'AH* north by Kuwait Bay, on the east by the sea, on the south by the district of ^Adail, and on the west by the locality called Kabd: its dimensions are thus about 15 miles either way. Qra/ah contains, besides the town of Kuwait, the village of Dinmah and the fort of Sirrah, the following places, which we give in alphabetical order;— Name. Position. Character. E emaes S.

Ras' Ajuzah and K as-al-Ardh, both described in the article on the Kuwait Principality, are among the maritime features of the Qra'ah district. EAOf rfhe name of a small isolated hill, of a Khor or depression, and of some wells, all situated in Kuwait territory on the boundary between the 'Adan and Salu ; districts. The hill is about 40 miles south of Kuwait Town and about 14 miles inland from the sea-coast, and the wells are 4 miles from it to the south-south-west. The Khor or depression lies to the north and east of the hill, between it and the sea; it measures about 6 miles in each direction and is overgrown with grass and bushes. In spite of the fact that it is called a Khor or inlet, it appears to have no communis cation with the sea and its drainage is said to sink into the ground. QEAIYN ^ small sandy islet, hardly above high-water level, 4 miles south of Qran Island. There is apparently no territorial authority.@ QUBBAN 1563 An island off the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq, about 36 miles norfch-east by east of Ras-al-BidyV. It stands only a few feet above sea level and is quite flat and covered with brushwood. There is an anchorage on the south side, in 8 fathoms, | a mile off the island. The island is frequented by fishermen from Musallamiyah and Jinnah islands, from Hadd (II) in Bahrain and possibly from Kharag island, who dry fish and make turtle oil for sale at Basrah and Kuwait- The oil is used as a remedy both for rheumatism and for costiveness. The ownership of Qran is apparently indeterminate. QRAN V^l in J U ,9)111# Generally pronounced Gubban. A deserted site on the western border of the FallaMyeh District of Southern 'Arabistan; it lies at the point where the Khors Bu Khadhair and Khuwairin unite to form the Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa, and it is thus distant about miles south-east wards from the Marid creek on the Karun river and 7 miles north and somewhat east of the village of Bu Shaneh on the Bahmanshir. The highest point attainable by boat on Khor Qanaqeh is about 1^ miles east-south-east of the place. A bush-grown hollow, in former times probably a canal, connects the Marid creek with Qubban: and the Salmaniyeh canal, now nearly dry, which crosses the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal in a south-easterly direction a short distance east of Marid, also runs in the direction of the settlement and may have been originally constructed for its benefit. In dry weather, e. g., November, there is a scarcity of water about. Qubban ; but at other seasons, e. g., May, the whole country to the northward as far as the eye can reach becomes a swamp and the mounds mentioned below are converted into islands. Qubban was formerly the capital of the Ka'ab tribe, but was deserted by them about 1747 A.D.—whether on account of drought or of flood ing, or for some other reason, is not known. The only traces of occupation now remaining are 3 large earthen mounds, about 20 feet high, which appear to be relics of fortified mud buildings, possibly of the corner towers of a village. * Authority ; Chiefly Major Cox, who examined the spot in November 1905 and May 1907, and was the first European to visit it since Colonel Chesney's Expedition in November 1836. In Colonel (. hesney's map Qubban is shown nearly 10 miles south of its true position : the latter is given in Commander Shearme's Topographical Sketch showing Dry Bed of Blind Karun River, 1908, and is 80° 22' 20'' N, by 48° 26' 55' E.

They are said to have come from Qatar with the ^Utub. QUMAT A large village in the Dizful District of Northern 'Arabistan: it is situated about 4 miles from the right bank of the Diz River at a point 6 miles above Kut Bandar^ and 8 miles from the left bank of the Shaur, The place consists of about 400 mud houses and mat huts inhabited by mixed Arabs, and it is divided into 4 Qariyehs or hamlets known by the names of Saiyid Ahmad, Saiyid Saim, Saiyid Salih ; and Saiyid Khalaf. The inhabitants possess about 100 rifles, and of the fighting men 100 are mounted. Livestock are estimated at 200 camels, 100 mules, 200 buffaloes, 4,000 cattle, and 10,000 sheep and goats. The community has gathered round the sacred personality of Saiyid Ahmad, the principal man, who is a ' Tufakh'—that is a diviner oi exerciser credited with power to discover thieves, cure the bites of rabid animals, etc. Saiyid Ahmad is much respected by the surrounding Arabs, who even make use of his name in oaths. :ilas oi jiitwto •iSiHili- QTJRAIN or QRAIN Frequently pronounced Grain. A small barren islet in Kuwait Bay, about half a mile off shore at a point 4 miles to the west of Kuwait Town. Towards its south end is a small brown-coloured mound 27 feet high. On the south-east side of the island, between it and the shore, there is a small basin called Bandar -ash-Shu waikh where native boats may ride, perfectly sheltered from all winds, in 3 to 4 fathoms of Water. This harbour is connected with the open bay by a long, narrow gut, which over a distance of 400 yards carries only 12 to 13 feet of water at low spring tides : the obstruction appears to be of rock which could not be very easily removed.^ ' Graine/'' the old English name for Kuwait Town, was probably taken from this island. *For an account of t'his anchorage and channel, see the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for September 1905 and plan there.QtrRNAH QADHA 1565 A division of the Basrah Sanjaq of the Basrah W ilayat in Turkish Iraq. Position and houndaries. —The Qadha of Qurnah is situated on both banks of the Shatt-al ^Arab immediately below the point where that river is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates ; a small portion of the district also ; containing* the administrative centre^ is enclosed between the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence. Conterminous tracts are the Qadhas of Shatrat-al-'Amarah and (perhaps) Zubair on the north, Persian territory on the east, the Qadha of Basrah on the south^ and that of Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the west. Topography and inhabitants. —The clef-lieu, Qurnah Village, which is elsewhere described in a special article, is the only place of any import ance in the Qadha, and it too is of small size. The only other villages deserving of mention are Madinah, Nashwah and Sharish, which are the seats of Mudirs : the first of these is the subject of a separate article, and tlie other two are noticed in the article on the Shatt-al -^Arab. The only great natural features of the district are the rivers Tigris, Euphrates and Shatt-al -'Arab, on which its entire character depends. The principal tribes of the Qadha are Ahl-al-Jazair, Qatarnah, Bani Malik and Bani Mansur ; of these the first and the last are found on both banks of the Euphrates and on the right bank oFthe Shatt-al -'Arab the whole way from Hammar to Sharish, while the Bani Malik are found chiefly on the eastern side of the Shatt-al -^Arab. Population. —The fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 30,000 souls, and nearly all of these are Arabs belonging to the Shi^ah section of Islam. Resources. —Qurnah is a damp and unhealthy district, but fertile and well-irrigated. Large quantities of dates and rice and smaller quantities of wheat and barley are produced year by year; and livestock are abundant, especially buffaloes. The only local manufacture is one of reed mats. Administration. —Qurnah is divided into 4Nahiyahs besides that form ing the headquarters orMarkaz : they are Dair-wa-Sharish on the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab j Madinah upon both sides of the Euphrates before its junction with the Tigris; Bani Mansur ; and Nashwah on the left bank of the Shatt- QUENAH QADHA1566 QtJRNAH QADHA al -'Arab. The headquarters of the firsts third and fourth of these are the villages of Sharish^ Madinah and Nashwah, respectively. QUENAH VILLAGE A small municipality in Turkish ''Iraq, situated between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers at the point of their junction. Qurnah consists of about 160 houses with a larger number of huts; and the inhabitants, who are almost all Shf ah Arabs of the Bani Mansur and Ahl Nahairat tribes, may number about 2,000 souls. Many natives of the place are employed as lightermen at Basrah and elsewhere. The neighbourhood produces dates, barley, wheat and rice and many buffaloes • but the climate is unhealthy and there is very little trade. The only manufacture is of fine summer ^Abas, some of which (it is said) can be passed through a finger-ring and are called Khachiyah Qurnah is also famous for a kind of cheese which is made in strands and plaited together for sale. The position of the town, commanding both rivers where neither is more than 100 yards broad and the water in each is 30 to 30 feet deep, is one of high administrative and military importance^ and the fact has been realised, though imperfectly, by the Turks. Qurnah is the headquarters of the Qadha of the same name. There are a customs-house, a quarantine station and a telegraph office, the line from Basrah to Baghdad dividing at the latter into two branches, one of which follows the Tigris and the other the Euphrates valley. The Department of Public Debt is represented by a Mamur, and river conservancy is controlled by a harbour master. The military garrison of Qurnah consists of 50 men, com manded by a lieutenant. The present Qurnah was founded more than 100 years ago by the Turks, who fortified it with a double wall on the landward side against Persian attack ; but the name existed as early as the 17th century, and there was a a castle ' even in the 16th. Qurnah is said to occupy the site of a more ancient place called Dighah , while local tradition even places the Garden of Eden here and points to a tree, still in existence, as planted by the patriarch Noah.

Quryat consists of hamlets, of which 3 stand upon the sea-shore and the remainder upon a plain^ about 2 miles wide ; between the coast and the hills of Eastern Hajar. This plain is traversed by two Wadis from the hiJls ; one being Wadi Mijlas at the northern end, and the other Wadi Bani Battash at the southern.

This quarter contains the bazaar and a fort belong ing to the Sultan of 'Oman. Do. The total population of the place is about 3 ; 500 souls. In the Sucj quarter there is a good bazaar with 7 shops of Hindus who reside here for the sake of the trade with the interior via Wadi Tayin,of which Quryat is the port. There is also one family of Khojah traders, under British protection. The date-plantations are considerable and barley and musk and water melons are cultivated. All the hamlets have date plantations, but they are small and unimportant. The people are also fishermen and export lime, which they burn, and firewood to Masqat Town : they own a dozen large Badans by means of which communica tion is maintained with Masqat Town, 12 smaller ones used for fishing, and about 50 Horis or skiffs. There is a tradition that horses were once bred here for the Indian market, but that the trade expired some two centuries ago in consequence of political troubles. The Sultan of 'Oman maintains at Quryat a Wali and a military detachment of 15 men who occupy the fort in the Suq quarter. The customs of the port bring in a revenue of $3,000 and Zakat yields $1,700 a year, but, with the exception of about $1,000 remitted annually to Masqat, the whole is swallowed up by the expenses of the local administration. The present Wali holds an assignment at Quryat from the private property of the actual Sultan (Saiyid Faisal) ; it consists of date plantations and arable land at Quryat and is worth $ 350 a year. QUSAIBAH A large village or small town in Qasim near its northern border; it is about 45 miles north-west by north of Buraldah. The site of Qusaibah is in a natural basin with sides about 100 feet high. The place consists of '^froint' ^eiampl %RABI'AH fBANI) 1569 4 detached quarters, at considerable distances apart, lying along the west side of the basin. The population of the entire settlement is about ^500 souls, mostly Anizah, Bani Khalid and negroes; they are small, thin and weak and have a drawn and emaciated appearance. This is doubtless due to the climate, which varies little with the season, mcsquitoes and fever being prevalent all the year round. The date plantations of Qusaibah extend 2^ miles, and there is cultivation of fruits, cereals and vegetables as well: the dates are reputed among the finest in O.asim. A small artesian well of warm water is one of the features of the place. The ordinary wells are unreliable, frequently failing or turning salt so as to necessitate the digging of new ones. It is reported that there are about 8,000 goats and sheep, but that larger and transport animals are not numerous at Qusaibah. The strait between Ghanam island and the coast of the QUWAI Ruus-al-Jibal district in the 'Oman Sultanate. It is 2 miles long, 600 (KHOR)* yards wide at its northern and southern entrances and 1,000 yards lJJ * JJ** broad in the middle. The soundings are 15 to 10 fathoms, and the bottom is of sand and gravel without hard rock. A well-sheltered, safe and commodious anchorage, Khor Quwai is also naturally defensible and would make a good naval flying-base, but there is no water supply deserving the name. A strong and well-to-do Arab tribe in Turkish ^Iraq. RABI'AH (BANI) Ternfory.-—The Bani Rabi^ah inhabit both sides of the Tigris in the neighbourhood of Kut-al-Amarah.: on the left bank their territory extends from opposite Bghailah. to Kut-al-Amarah. and on the nghj bank from Bghailah. to Shaikh Sa^ad, with a depth in either case of 20 to 25 miles from the river. They are also found sporadically in other places, as for example at Mahmudiyah. on the route between Baghdad and Karbala. * A full report on Khor Quwai by Commander W. Kemp, R N., will be found in the Government of India's Proceedings, Political, for June 1904 ; also some remarks by Admiral Atkinson-Willes, H.N. P H1570 RABi'AH (BANI) and number. —The principal divisions of the Bani Rabi'ah are the Amarah* the largest of the clans and the one from which the Shaikhs are drawn, occupying the right bank of the Tigris for some distance below Bghailah. \ the Maiyah or Maiyah sU' 0 in the angle between the Tigris and the right bank of the Shatt-al -Gharaf; the Sarai or Siraj in the corresponding position between the left bank of the Shatt-al -Gharaf and the Tigris, and around Hai Town; the Maqasis between the Sarai and Shaikh Sa^ad ; the Bulhah between :f® the Am arah and the Maiyah ; and the Khammas upon the left bank ■ ^ of the Tigris. A section called Karaish are found chiefly in the ^ Kut-al-Amarah Qadha j the most important of their subsections are (1) the Kawam who are found on the left bank of the Tigris I between Kut-al-Amarah Town and occur also in the Kadhimain ^ Qadha ; and (^) the Bani Tamim who are represented in both the same Qadhas. Of the above sections the Maqasis are respected as Saiyids by the other Bani E/abi^ah and wear their hair long; they engage in agriculture and also in robbery, and some of them are considered to belong to the Bani Lam rather than to the Bani Habi'ah. There is also a predatory section called Kinanah ajUJ , every member of which owns a breech-loading rifle. The distribution and composition by subsections of the Kawam and Maqasis sections of the tribe are explained in the article on the Kut-al-Amarah Qadha, where the names of a number of petty sections not mentioned above will also be found. In number the Bani Rabv'ah are inferior to the Muntafik and the Bani Lam, but no exact estimate is possible. Beligion and life. —All the Bani Eabi'ah, with the exception of the Kawam, are Shfahs by religion and live in tents; they both cultivate themselves and employ others to cultivate for them; their chief crops are wheat and barley; they possess many sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. Military strength and political position. —About one»fourth of the fighting strength of the tribe are horsemen and are well mounted. A proportion of old-fashioned firearms is still carried by the Bani Rabi^ah, who are in fact on the border line between the well-armed tribes of Lower and the worse-armed tribes of Upper ^Iraq. As revenue to the Turkish Government, the Bani Rabi'ah pay one-fifth produce on account of lands classified as easily irrigable, and * Apparently the section whose subdivisions are given at page 130 of the Gazetteer of Baghdad, 1889.

The extreme length of Radaif from Jabal Na'airiyah to its southernmost limit is about 40 miles and its average breadth about 1.4 j its eastern boundary is some 20 or 25 miles from the sea. Radaif consists of dark, firm soil, with here and there stony mounds or patches of rising ground. There are no trees, and grazing consists of Thamam grass and ^Arfaj and ^Ausaj plants; Hamdh and Rimth are not found. Except in the matter of vegetation Radaif very closely resembles the adjoining tract of Jau Shamin.

A village on the coast of the Ras-al -Khaimah District of the Sharjah RAMS Principality, about 8 miles north-east of Ras-al -Khaimah Town, It stands on the south side of a small creek, the entrance of which is nearly dry at low water; the shore in the vicinity is swampy; and another creek, which opeils from the sea 2 miles south-west of Rams, enters the bay at Ras-al -Khaimah Town after running parallel to the coast for 5 miles. There are no trees at Rams itself. Earns consists of about 400 houses, mostly of mud and stone, but a few of date branches; the inhabitants are all Tanaij. The principal occupations are pearl diving and fishing; the inhabitants own some 3 pearl boats and 10 fishing boats, also 1 sea-going Sambuk, which fetches dates from Basrah. The only shop at Rams is kept by a Persian. The date plantations belonging to Rams are partly situated at Dhayah a place 2 miles inland to the eastwards, and on the south they join the plantations of Sir, forming a belt of palms which is continuous as far as Ras-al -Khaimah Town : they are said to comprise about 7,000 trees and to be irrigated from wells about 10 feet deep. Livestock at Rams are estimated at 20 camels, 50 donkeys, 20 cattle^ and 600 goats. The place Dhayah, just mentioned, is now uninhabited; but there are wells and the remains of a fort situated upon a hill. A century ago Dhayah was of more importance, and in 1820 the general treaty of peace between the British Government and the Shaikhs of Trucial ''Oman was signed by the Shaikh of ' Zyah ^ among the others • this was Hasan-bin- ^Ali ; a prominent partisan in his day of the Wah- habi interest. The easternmost district of ^rabistan; it is attached for fiscal pur poses to the northern division of that province and may therefore be reckoned, though administered separately from the rest, to belong to Northern ^Arabistan. es. —The Ramuz district is bounded along its side, beginning at some naphtha springs known as Naft-i-Salid north-eastern kiu RAMUZ j'b or RAM EURMUZ Jzr* rb DISTRICT1574 RAMUZ DISTRICT at its northern corner, by the range of Kuh-i-Gach £ or the Gypsum Hills, which reaches to the Ramuz river; its south eastern corner is on the Martin river, above Jaizan which is included in the district. From Jaizan the boundary runs, at a short distance from the left bank of the Marun, to a point Cham Mani' ^ on the Jarrahi 3 miles below the confluence of the Ramuz river and the Marun ; from Cham Mani^ it is continued to the low mud and rock hills through which the Jarrahi breaks above Cham-as -Sabi, crosses that river and, following the same hills, arrives at a point on the Ramuz-Nasiri route on the eastern verge of the Bu'airish plain and about 9 miles east of the village of Mirbacheh. The remainder of the boundary is a line connecting Bu'airish with the naphtha springs first mentioned; this line crosses the Gupal stream about 4 miles above the barrage on the same. Physical characteristics. —The district is a fertile plain, about one- half of which is said to be watered from various streams and springs. The most important of the streams are the Ramuz river (or upper course of the Jarrahi) between its exit from the hills and its junction with the Marun and a short section of the Jarrahi proper between that junction and its exit from the district, also the Martin river which is the principal feature of the south-eastern part of the district; informa tion concerning these will be found in the articles on the Jarrahi and Martin. The Gupa] stream, which traverses a part of the district north of the Ramuz-Nasiri road, is described elsewhere under its own name. It remains to mention the Zarnini and Muwailheh streams which are features of some importance in the neighbourhood of Mirbacheh. The Zarnmi ^^3 or Zarini is crossed about 4 miles from Ramuz Town on the way to Mirbacheh ; at that point it is (in winter) a swiftly flowing stream of fresh water, 1 to 2 yards wide and 2 to 3 feet deep, with perpendicular banks 4 or 5 feet high except at the crossing place, and its course is to the west-south-west. The subsequent course of the Zarnmi is uncertain; a good deal of it is probably expended in irrigation, but it has been identified conjecturally with a fresh water stream of about the same size which passes a mile to the east of Mirbacheh village travelling in a north-westerly direction; possibly however it goes southwards towards the Jarrahi river. The Muwailheh is a salt stream which is crossed about 2 miles west of Mirbacheh on the way to Nasiri ; at that place it is running to the north-'West^ its bed is 200 to 300 yards across, and on the left bank.r A muz district 1575 which is scarped, there are stony hillocks rising as much as 80 feet aLove the level o£ the water. The stream here resembles a canal and hugs the left bank of its channel; its average breadth is about 10 yards, but even in winter a place was observed at which its breadth was only 4 yards and its depth nevertheless did not exceed feet. About 5 miles from the crossing place the Muwailheh falls into the G-upal. Besides these two streams in the neighbourhood of Mirbacheh, springs of fresh water are said to exist 10 or 1^ miles to the south or south-east of that village. People. —The inhabitants of the Ramuz district are chiefly Ahl-i- Ramuz, a local breed of mixed Arafy Lur, Behbehani and Qanawati blood, who are related to the surrounding population much as (i Dizfulis' and ' Shushtaris' are to the tribes in the districts of Dizful and Shushtar. The Lurs, who are the next most numerous, are chiefly Chahaiiang Bakhtiyaris, including Shir ^Alis and Talaw r aris, or Kuhgalus of the Bagdali, Bahmai, Bair Ahmadi, Agha Jari and Taibi sections. The balance of the population are Arabs or Saiyids. The Arabs belong chiefly to the Hamaid, A1 KhamiS and Bani Lam tribes and are mostly settled or semi-settled cultivators. It is calculated that among the Lurs one-half of the fighting men are armed with rifles and one-fifth are mounted. Ramuz Town is the principal place in the district: a conspectus of the villages is given at the end of this article. The total population of the district is probably about 12,000 souls inclusive of the A1 KhamiS, only a few of whom, though the tribe is now semi-settled, appear in the table of villages below. Agriculture, —Rice, sesame, cotton, wheat, barley, beans, linseed^ and tobacco are produced, and the fruits grown include dates, oranges, sweet and bitter limes, pomegranates, plums, apples, grapes, figs, quinces, citrons, apricots, pears, and almonds; the fruits, except dates, are mostly of recent introduction. The district, under its piesenfc judi cious managers, the Bakhtiyari Khans, promises to impio\e in every respect and is attracting settlers from all directions, especially from the Jarrahi region and further east. There are 20 flour mills driven by water power in the district. The ordinary unit o£ land measurement in the district is the Kbish , or area which requires 5 Hamuz Mans of wheat or 3 of barley to sow it. As the thickness of the sowing varies with the nature of the soil, the Khish cannot be expressed in terms of acreage.1676 eamuz district Trade. —Ramuz Town is the only commercial centre. Exports are wheat, barley, sesame, rice, beans, linseed, ghi, wool, and hides, which are the produce of the district, and wool, Zidu or gum- arabic, a kind of logwood called Runiyeh and various nuts which are brought from the hills. Exportation takes place direct to both Nasiri and Muhammarell, but nearly all imports—namely, piece-goods, metals, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, crockery, and candles—are received through Nasiri ; the more highly taxed of these commodities, however, as also prohibited articles such as firearms and ammunition, are brought by muleteers from ports such as Pallahiyeh, Ma'shur, Hindiyan and Dilam, into which they are smuggled from abroad. The Man of Ramuz is equal to 106 lbs. English. Administration. —The district is subject to the rule of the Bakh- tiyari Khans, who also enjoy its revenues subject to a yearly payment of 15,000 Tumans into the Persian treasury at Shushtar. The agricul tural taxes are generally collected in kind at the rate of one-fourth of the gioss produce in the case of wheat, barley, linseed, cotton, beans, and tobacco, and at the rate of one-'-third in the case of rice and sesame. Unirrigated crops ordinarily pay revenue in cash at the rate of 33 Qrans per Faddan.* In 1904 the revenue collections in kind consisted of 2,000 Hamuz Mans of wheat, 12,000 of barley, 100 of beans, 1,500 of linseed, 70 of tobacco, 12,000 of rice, and 1,000 of sesame, and their total value was estiniated at 55,000 Tumans : in the same year the area cultivated hy rainfall was 2,000 Faddans and yielded 6,500 Tumans in cash. The revenue-paying cultivation of the district at the present time is estimated as below by a reliable authority:-— Unirrigated land. Area in Khish. Proprietors. 600 The Samsam-us-Saltaneh and the Mnntazim* ud-Dauleh. 800 The Shahab-us-Saltaneh and others.RAMUZ DISTRICT 1677 Irrigated land. Area in Ehish. Proprietors.

The remarkable differences in the rate of these rentals are said to be justified by corresponding differences in the productiveness of the estates. The people are generally contented under the present regime^ and the land owners are busy in improving their properties by extending the irrigation canals. The Khans pay one Qran per Man of their rents into a common fund which is maintained by them for the internal government of the Bakhti- yari tribe.

These villages are all agricultural. In the Persian villages the livestock; consisting of cattle^ sheep and goats, are not in excess of the requirements of the villagers ; but the Arab settlers are believed to possess a consider able surplus of sheep. RAMUZ yb TOWN Also called Ram Hurmuz ^ and Suq Ram Hurmuz ^ (jy, is the chief town of the district similarly named. It stands 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of the Ramuz river about 12 miles above its junction with the Mariin river and is situated about 48 miles almost due east of Hasiri. The hills of the Bakhtiyari country begin about 2 or 3 miles north of the place. Ramuz is a thriving town and consists of about 600 houses ; most of these are of mud, but a few are of brick and plaster, the latter being the property of the Bakhtiyari Khans, who reside at Ramuz in winter. The population is about 3,000 souls and consists entirely of a class of mixed origin who are describd as Ahl-i-Ramuz. There are about 100 indifferently supplied shops, partly collected in a vaulted bazaar 100 yards in length and partly scattered through the town ; there are also two water mills. Wood ;BAPOH fuel, and charcoal are cheap. Several good gardens already exist on the south side of the town ; and others are being laid out on the north side. The trees are dates, oranges, pomegranates, figs, lemons, and vines. Irrigation is from a canal which takes out of the Ramuz river near its exit from the hills and about 5 miles to the east of Ramuz; the water is fresh and good and is used for drinking. There are also wells, said to be about 50 feet deep, but they are little used. Ramuz town is the chief centre of trade in the district, and here the produce of the adjacent hills finds a markets Messrs. Lynch Brothers have an agency at Ramuz in charge of a native. There is a Persian Grovernment telegraph to Nasiri on the one side and to Behbehan on the other ; but there is no post office. The town appears at one time to have covered an area much greater than that which it at present occupies ; it possesses twoshrines rone. Haft Tanan in the north-east corner of the town among some date palms; the other, Wlamdarof a tapering shape north of the centre of the town in the outskirts. Ramuz in the 10th century A. D. was a prosperous place, famous for its raw silk. There were excellent markets and a fine J ami'' mosque built by the Buyids ; also a celebrated library. The name Ram Hurmuz, received from King Hurmuz, grandson of Ardashir Babgan, was already in the 14th century A. D. generally shortened to Ramuz.* A river in Persian Makran which comes down by Bint in the Gaih district and reaches the coast by two mouths 9 miles apart, of which the western, Khor Rapch, is 92 miles east by south of New Jashk, and the eastern and more important, Khor Galag, is 78 miles vest by north of Chahbar Town. Both estuaries have shallow bars with deep water inside, and on each is situated a small village having the same name as the Khor; neither place however is much frequented except by fishing boats.f Khor Rapch is the more considerable on account of a large tidal backwater, and it could be used by small vessels if it were buoyed. The coast on both sides of the river is low and sandy and full of creeks and backwaters. At about 12 miles from the coast the Rapch river is crossed by the land telegraph line between New Jashk and Gwadar, its width from bank to bank being at this point 612 yards. On the east bank is a telephone hut. This spot is chiefly memorable as the RAPCH I *Vi(jleliQ Strange. t For Khor Eapch see Admiralty plan No. 145.1684 RAPCH scene of the cruel murder by Karwanis on the 2nd December 1897 of Mr. E. Graves, Telegraph Superintendent. The country on both banks of the river from near Balak on the east to the Kashi stream on the west, at a distance of 10 to 25 miles from the sea, forms the district of Karwau, which is described in a separate article. The Rapch river, when in flood, inundates the country on both sides of it. The usual ford is at the telegraph crossing, but a better one exists IJ miles further down, while the last ford to become impassable in floods is 3 miles further up. iiliw RASH A- Singular Rashidi An inferior Bedouin tribe found in Kuwait territory, in the fixed villages of 'Wadi-al-Miyah and in other parts of ^ the Sanjaq of Hasa. In some respects they resemble the 'Awazim; they appear to be of Hat aim extraction; and they are clients or dependents of the Mutair. Their fighting strength and numbers are about the same as those of the ^Awazim. The Rashaidah in Hasa breed horses and camels and take menial service under various Shaikhs. RASIB Singular Rasibi . A tribe of the Ja'alan district of the 'Oman (BANI) Sultanate, where they possess the one large village of Wafi. They are said to be of Nizari descent and in politics are Ghafiriyah; but although, according to tradition, they were the first tribe in 'Oman to embrace the national Ibadhi form of Muhammadanism, they are now bigoted Wahha- bis, having been converted during the Najdi invasions at the begin ning of the 19th century. They have an old feud with the Bani Ru Hasan and amicable relations with the Bani Bu 'Ali and the Hishm. They intermarry chiefly with the Bani Bu 'Ali and in conjunction with the Hishm are able to close the route from c&gt;ur into Sharqiyah. At present they are at feud with the Hajriym. Their number is reckoned at 1,500 souls. Their principal sections are the Aulad Faris aiy, Maraziqah and Aulad Rabi ; &lt;*■£; . The Bani Rasib are better off than most of the tribes of ^Oman. Their chiefs are Sa^ud-bin- Sulaiman and Nasir, his brother, who reside at WafirRAUDHAH 1585 An important township or oasis of Qasim, about 40 to 45 miles southr RASS west of Buraidah and perhaps 10 miles south-south-west of Kliabrah, situated on one bank (most probably the southern) * of Wadi-ar- ^ Rummah; it is the last place of importance on this side of Qasim, and immediately beyond it begins a granitic and basaltic region which stretches to Makkah. The name Rass means ' place of pits for watering.' Rass is described as consisting of 3 quarters lying north and south; the first and largest, Ruwaidhah &lt;'-%), is a walled town t; the second, Rafi'ah ( or P erha P s Rass proper), is a village with a high watch tower rising above its palms; the third, Shinanah tUU, i s the smallest hut is sometimes accounted a separate village.t The total population of Rass is about 3,500 souls and is regarded as belonging to the Anizah, Ataibah and other tribes. The oasis is girdled, except on the east, by date groves§ and orchards and possesses much arable land, the last lying m the bed of Wadi-ar-Rummah; water is good and abundant at 6 to 7 fathoms below the surface. Several outlying granges also, where corn is grown, are associated with Rass. Rass lies &amp; on the route between Kuwait and Makkah and is consequently in the path of many caravans ; supplies are plentiful and many of the inhabitants live by the carrying trade. The place is usually subordinate to the Amir of Buraidah: the local Shaikh is said to be one of the 'Ataibah. A considerable village with several dependencies in the Aflaj district RAUDHAH o JNajd, where it lies about 3 miles south of Kharfah and 10 miles north This is doubtful. See Doughty's index sub Jarada, but also Huber's m»r and oui article on Najd, Route II. Two recent and entirely independent reports concur in placing Rass south of Wadi-ar-Eummah. t According to a recent report, however, Euwaidhah is no less than 10 miles north west by west of ' Rass ' and is separated from it by tVadi -ar-Eumman tAccording to one report Shinanah lies 5 miles south-west of the centre of ass; according to another it is miles to the north-west and nearer to Wadi-ar- ummah.

In name a Qadha of the Karbala Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilajat RAZAZAH in Turkish ^Iraq; in practice rather a Muqata'ah of the Karbala Qadha. Razazah is really a small estate situated on the north-western bank of the Rashdiyah branch of the Husainiyah canal, about 12 miles south west of the town of Karbala : on the south side of it is the swamp known as Hor Abu Dibis, fed by the water of the canal. Originally the property of the Turkish Government, Razazah was, as a measure of policy, conferred by the Porte as a free grant on Fahad Eaig-bin- - 'Abdul 5 i 21588 RAZAZAH Mulisin, a leading Shaikh of the 'Anizah. tribe, and about 1875 was constituted a Qadha of the third class, the Shaikh being at the same time appointed Qaim-Maqam. At a later period Fahad Baig, while allowed to retain the ownership of the estate, was deprived of the official post of Qaim-1 ilaqam in favour of his cousin Fahad-bin- Daghaiyin, by whom it is now held. The emoluments of the Qaim- Maqamship consist in monthly allowance of 12| Lirahs and one- fourth of the net amount of the cattle tax collected from the Arabs; under his authority. Both the owner and the so-called governor of Razazah lead a wandering life in the desert with their tribe; the former is represented locally by a negro agent and has a small mud fort there, in which he used at one time to reside and which is now used as a granary. The ordinary inhabitants of the place live in huts and number about 750 souls. The value of the Government share (|) of the crops of Razazah is estimated at 500 Lirahs per annum. ^ Or Rifa'-al-Qibli &amp; . A village situated on the bleak, stony GrHARBI plateau of Bahrain Island, H m il es west-north-west of EifaZ-ash-Sharqi gUj and overlooking the great central depression of the island from the north. It consists of about 40 reed huts and one masonry house, the latter inhabited by Khalifah-bin-Ahmad, a member of the ruling family ; the village however is in the jurisdiction of Shaikh Khalid, brother of the ruling Shaikh of Bahrain. The people are Maliki Sunnis, chiefly of the ^Utub tribe, but there are 8 houses of Kibisah, 4 of Na'im and 3 of natives of Hasa. Most of them are engaged in the sale of drinking water at' Manamah, whither they convey it on camels. The well,* Umm Ghuwaifah, in the water of which they traffic, is situated on the high plateau and is considered by natives to be the best in the island : it is probably however not so pure, being practically in the village, as that of the Hanaini wells belonging to Eifa'-ash-Sharqi. There are no dates or other trees or cultivation here. Animals include 8 horses, 35 donkevs and 7 cattle. This place and Rlfa-ash-Sharqi are the sanitaria tlle8 J ■ %tlll(! of Bahrain. ^ * An analysis of water from this well will be found in Lieutenant Somerville 8 ^ m report on Kl.of-al-Qalai'ah, printed by the Foreign Department of the Government of India, Simla, July 1906.1%) Rla 1589 A large village of fortified aspect, with several watch towers, over- BJFA'-ASH looking the central depression of Bahrain Island at its north-eastern SHARQI corner: it is 7 miles south of Manamah fort and occupies a dreary and barren site. It contains about 300 mud houses and two large masonry houses, one of which is occupied by Shaikh Khalid-bin-'Ali, brother of the ruling Shaikh of Bahrain, and the other by Shaikh Sabah-bin-Hamud, the oldest member alive of the ruling family. In the middle of the village is the fine well of 'Ain Khalid oJU. ^ in which the water stands at 20 fathoms below the ground level. Close to the village, beneath the cliffs that enclose the central depression, are the wells of Hanaini. The inhabitants of Rifa'-ash-Sharqi are Maliki Sunnis, and may be classified as follows: Utub, 170 houses; natives of Hasa, 60 houses ; free negroes, 20 houses ; and slaves living apart from their masters, 50 houses. The place is in the jurisdiction of Shaikh Khalid. Most of those who are not members of the ruling family live by purveying drinking water at Manamah, Except a few dates near the Hanaini well no vegetation is visible here. Animals however include 16 borses, 85 donkeys and 20 cattle. RifaZ-al-Gharbi and this village are the natural sanitaria of Bahrain. The port and chief town of the Persian Coast district of Hay at jjjq . Davud] it is situated on the coast 31 miles north-north-west of Bushehr Town and 156 miles due east of Kuwait. Situation and character, —Rig stands upon a low sandy coast ^hich runs north and south ; there is a creek at the town fronted by two sandy islets or banks inside which native boats lie aground at low water. On the north and south the town is adjoined by cultivated lands and on the east, at about 2 miles distance, is a chain of low sand-hills which screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. The only defensive work is the loopholed, semi-fortified residence of the Khan, built of stones and mud. The smaller houses are built of sundried brick ; in the construction of those of a better class stone from the Bushehr Peninsula and cement from Kharag Island are employed ; but the Khan, fearing the cupidity of the Persian Government, quietly does his best to prevent the improvement of the town. Rig possesses a few date trees. There are two unimportant shrines. The place is said to be very ancient ■1590 Rla Fovulation. inhabitants number about 2,500 souls : they are a mongrel breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominate. Persian modified by the Lur dialect is the language spoken. The people are caltivators ; boatmen, sailors and traders ; they are reputed peaceable and ^ not fanatical^ but there are about 3 Martini rifles to every 5 houses. The f ' sC( inhabitants of Rig are Shi'ah Muhammadans, but traditions survive of a time when some of them were Gabrs. Trade and supplies.--Rig is a fairly prosperous port, dealing princi- iiei pally with. Bushehr and Kuwait, and serving the considerable district gt^ of Hayat Davud, and part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazaar contains about 50 shops, and trade has increased during the last few years j the monthly imports are said now to average 100 packages or bags of sugar, 5 cases of tea, 50 bags of Indian rice, 100 cases of kerosine oil and 50 bales of Manchester prints, all from Bushehr. There is also a considerable importation of camels from Kuwait. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle, all to Bushehr except the wheat of which the bulk is sent to Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. The Persian Qran is the basis of the currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The standards of weight are those of the Hayat Davud district. The unit of length is a Gaz of 38 J inches. Resources and communications* —Water is from wells, and some wheat, barley and straw are locally obtainable. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys are owned in the town, also 100 cattle and 600 sheep and goats, and there are 8 Bums of various sizes besides 10 Mashuwahs and about 15 fishing boats. A Persian post office was opened here 4 years, and a telegraph office about 1^ years ago (1905) ; but very little use is made of the latter^ which is intermediate between Burazjan and Dllam on the Burazjan-Ahwaz branch line. There is frequent communication with Bushehr by sailing-boat. Administration. — Rig is the residence of the hereditary Khan and governor of the Hayat Davud district. The Imperial Persian Customs established a post here in 1903. lllvaUe E/IND A tribe of Makran who claim to be of Arab origin and to have come TEllb f^om Aleppo, but are to all intents and purposes Baluchis. Their head- quarters are at Mand ^ , about 80 miles north of Gwadar and a short , r Wl)yRISAIL (WADI) 1591 distance east o£ the Persian frontier, bnt a few are found scattered through the districts of Persian Makran. Their fighting strength is estimated at 1 ; 500 men. The majority of the Rinds ordinarily follow peaceful pursuits, but the headmen exercise little influence over individuals, and the tribe is consequently prone to misbehaviour and difficult to control. The Einds hardly fall within the scope of this Gazetteer but for their connection with Gwadar, in the neighbourhood of which they have some times given trouble by raiding. In recent years, however, they have conducted themselves peaceably and have taken to cultivation, of which their country, which is open, is not incapable. A group of wells situated within the limits of the Batin, apparently mQA^I in the bed of a tributary from the south-east at or near the point where it joins the Batin, Eiqa^i lies about 105 miles west by south in a direct line from Kuwait Town and may be regarded as marking the Kuwait frontier in this direction • it is the usual third halting place on the route from Kuwait to Qasim and lies 61 miles north-east of Hafar. At a short distance from Eiqa^i, on the side towards Kuwait^ a torrent bed (which is perhaps identical with that containing the Eiqa'i wells) drops in its descent to the Batin over a ledge of limestone rock about 50 feet wide and 10 feet high. The wells of Riqa'i are dotted about in the middle of the hollow which contains them and are connected by subterranean galleries. In January 1906 they were found empty except one, named tfmm Khurjin ^1, which descended vertically for about 7 feet and then divided into two pockets which continued downwards^ obliquely and in opposite directions, for a few feet further; this well yielded half a skin of water. It is said however that, should a full flood occur in spring, water may be obtained at Riqa^i throughout the whole following suinmer. A small valley at the west end of the Masqat District of the ; 0inaH Sultanate; it comes down from the Eastern Hajar and reaches the sea four miles south-east of Hail A1 'Umair in Batinah.

The settled population o£ the valley is thus about 300 souls. There is water in the valley, but the flow is not constant. At Risail the Wadi receives a tributary called Wadi Jaba ^ which comes down from the west end of Wadi Boshar. EIYABH The capital of the Wahhabi dominions and the principal town of the 'Aridh district in Southern Najd: it is about 195 miles south-east of 'Anaizah in Qasim and the same west-south-west of Hofuf in Hasa.RIYAM (BANI) The name Riyadh is the plural of Raudhah, meaning not only a garden but any moist hollow in which natural vegetation grows. Riyadh stands about 2 miles from the left bank of W adi Hanlfah upon a plateau with higher ground to the northward. The town is walled and has 6 gates, and in the midst of it is the fortified palace of Ibn Sa^ud. There are about 20 mosques^ of which 3 are recognised as Jami's. Sundried brick is the only building material. In the suburbs^ especially on the south and west sides^ are many cultivated enclosures and very extensive date groves. Neither the town itself nor its surround ings are in the slightest degree picturesque. * The population of Riyadh amounts to about 8,000 souls ; the majority are said to be of ^ Anizah descent, but some are Bani Tamim of a section called Wahub, and there are also many Bani Khadhir and slaves. Drinking water is obtained from wells in the town and its environs, which are from 40 to 50 feet deep ; and the date plantations are said to be irrigated entirely from this source. Wadi Hanifah also, after good spring rains, contains flowing water for some months. Trade is mostly with Hasa^ whence the bulk of the imports is derived ; the remainder are from Kuwait and Hijaz in about equal proportions. Coffee mortars and pestles are manufactured at Riyadh from local marble. The Wahhabi ruler maintains a small standing force in Riyadh • the defence of the capital however rests chiefly with the citizens, who are said to be well armed with Martini rifles. There are half a dozen muzzle-loading guns belonging to Ibn Sa'ud, some of brass and some of iron, which are said to be in good condition. Singular Riyami A somewhat peculiar tribe of the 'Oman EJYAM Sultanate, found chiefly in 'Oman Proper, but also in Jabal Akhdhar and ^ . in the upper villages of some of the valleys in the seaward slopes of ^ ^ Sr Hajar. In 'Oman Proper their settlements are Izki (450 houses), Kamah (20 houses), Karsha (20 houses), Manah (140 houses), Birkat-al -Moz (250 houses), Muti (300 houses)^ Nizwa (500 houses), Tanuf (40 houses), and Zikait (15 houses); in Jabal Akhdhar they have Sharaijah (100 houses) and Saiq (60 houses); in Wadi Bani Kharus they are found at Misfah (100 houses), and in Wadi Mistal at Hijar (50 houses), and Qorah (40 houses). Those of Saiq belong to a section called Jawamid * For a plan o£ Riyadh, as it was 40 years ago, see Palgrave.1594 UIYAM (BAM) j and those of Misfah to a section called Sliaraiqiyin The ''Azur of Khashbat 'Azur in the Baldan-al-Habus division of the Sharqiyah district are believed to be connected with the Bani Eiyam. The Bani Riyam are said to be of Yamani descent and are reputed to have been among the earliest Arab settlers in 'Oman; but they are now attached to the Ghafiri political faction. In religion they are Ibadhis : none of them are Bedonins. They are a large tribe of perhaps 11,000 souls, well-to-do and peaceably inclined, but those of the hills do not bear a good reputation among the people of 'Oman generally, who regard them as irascible, slothful, immoral and wanting in hospitality; the prejudice against them may be partly due to their disregard of Muhammadan principles in drinking a wine which they themselves manufacture from home-grown grapes. The men, in the hills, are described as haggard and prematurely old, without the usual vivacity and robustness of mountaineers ; the women go unveiled and are sometimes of a clear, ruddy complexion. The Tamimah of the Bani Riyam is Hamyar-bin-Nasir, who resides at Tanuf; his father Nasir-bin- Sulaiman exercised much real authority over the tribe and unlike most other Tamimahs was equally conspicuous in peace and in war. RUBA-AL- This great desert of Southern Arabia skirts 'Oman along its entire KHALI western boundary, and most of the Bedouin tribes of inner 'Oman roam It ♦ Jl . the fringe of it with their camels. The number of the wanderers is small; for the only water is that left in hollows after rain and some springs of brackish fluid which well up here and there. The soil on the side next 'Oman is said to be generally salty or nitrous. The oryx ; wild ass and two species of gazelle are said to be found in most parts of this desert. ijii RUD SHUR A salt stream which rises in the coast range where it is called Taviseh, to the north-east of Rig ; it passes the villages of Khalifeh, Samiyeh, Anjiru, Chahrusahi and Bldu and finds an independent outlet to the sea. Throughout the greater part of its length this watercourse forms the boundary between the district of Hay at Davud and the district of Shabankareh. Its bed, where it is crossed by the route between DihRtTD-HILLEH DISTRICT 1595 Kuhneh and Chalirusahi, is about 150 yards wide, and in May is almost dry. A small district of the Persian Coast, subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports ; it is wedged in between the district of Hay at Da V lid on the north, the sea on the west and south, and the districts of Angali and Shabankareh on the east. Limits and physical characteristics, —The Rud-hilleh district comprises only the banks of the river of the same name to a distance of 15 miles inland, together with the uncultivated mud-flats which extend from the river to the north shore of the Bushehr harbour : including* the latter it measures about 15 miles in each direction. The coast of the district opposite Bushehr Town is swampy, but at its extreme southern point, called Tahima , there is a rocky patch; throughout its length the coast is only a few feet above high-water level. The district is flat and its only important feature is the Eud-hilleh River. The winter is said to be colder than in Bushehr, while in summer the day-breezes are less scorching than those of Angali and Shabankareh and the nights are fairly cool. Vovulation. —The inhabitants of the district number somewhat over 4,000. souls. The majority are Arabs who speak both Persian and Arabic and are Sunnis by religion. Some of them claim to be the descend ants of Ka'ab immigrants from the FallaMyeh district in Southern 'Arablstan, and the remainder represent themselves as Bani Hajir and Bani Tamim from the mainland of Arabia; both classes say their ancestors came to the country 150 years ago and that they were refugees from Turkish oppression (sic). The Bani Tamim claim to have been the earlier settlers. The villages consist of huts and are generally defended by small towers. Agriculture. —Wheat and barley are the ordinary staples; musk and water melons also grow ; and there are dates, but not many. Cattle and sheep and goats are fairly numerous. Trade. —Trade is insignificant. Exports are a little wool and some wheat, barley and melons, which go to Bushehr, Muhammareh, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Lingeb. Imports are piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee and EUD- HILLEH DISTRICT1596 RtJD-HILLEH DISTRICT sugar from Bushehr, The Persian Qran is the medium of exchange ; the standards of weight are a Man of 8 lbs. 4 oz. English and a Hashim Man of 16 ordinary Mans or 132 lbs. English, The Gaz or unit of length is here 40 i inches. Communications and transport, —The Rud-Mlleh Kiver is a consider able obstacle to movement, especially in summer. There is a ferry over it at Mahmadi, where it is crossed by a land-route from Bushehr to Behbehan.* The di strict can produce about 250 horses, 200 mules and 1,300 donkeys. The inhabitants own about a dozen cargo boats of small size by means of which they maintain communication with Kuwait and even Basrah. Administration, —The district is subject to the general control of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who at the present time also farms the collection of the revenue from the holders in Tiyul, the Fateh-ul-Mulk and the Sa ^Td -ul-Mulk. About 60 years ago the district was leased to the Khan of Angali, with whom it remained until its transfer by the farmer of the revenues, 6 years ago, to the Khan of Hayat Davud ; the latter now manages it through a brother of his own stationed at Mahmadi. Justice is dispensed as in the Khan's own district of Hayat Davud. The taxes are 60 to 80 Qrans per Gau of cultivation ; also ^ of the produce of the date-palms or, in a bad year, 2 or 3 Qrans in cash on account of each tree. The district is at present farmed for an annual sum of 3,500 Tumans. An official of the Persian Imperial Customs at Mahmadi is the only direct agent of the Persian Government in the district.

EUD- HILLEH RIVER A river in Persia formed at about 25 miles inland from the coast of the Rud-hilleh district by the junction at Durugah, near the meeting point of the Zira, Shabankareh and Dashtistan districts, of the Rud Shirm or Shapur river with the Daliki stream.* The Eud Shirin comes from Shulistan and the Mamasani hills,.passing Khishtt immediately before it breaks through the last barrier of * In mediaeval times the whole Eud-hilleh Eiver appears to have been known as the Shapur : see Le S trance's Lands of tk* IS astern Caliphate. f Consequently it is sometimes called the Khisht Riyer.BUHUM (DOHAT) 15^9 hills and enters the maritime plain ; the waters of the Eiud Shirin, as the name betokens, are sweet and potable. The Daliki stream rises in the hills far to the south-east of Daliki ; but near that place, at its exit from the mountainous country, its course suddenly changes to south-west. The Daliki stream differs from the Eud Shirin in being brackish, at least below Daliki. Neither of these streams is fordable in winter; hut when the water is low it is possible to march from Burazjan to Sa^adabad and thence to Dih Kuhneh by fording both streams, which upon this route are each over 100 yards in width. The Rud-hilleh, as the joint waters are called below the place of union, is described as a sluggish stream flowing in a firm bed between banks of considerable height : the depth is said to be about 20 feet on the average, but at the shallowest parts it varies from or 3 feet in summer to 4 or 5 feet in winter. In floods the river sometimes rises as much as 20 feet and submerges its banks. There is a ford between the villages of 'Askari and Qal^eh Sirhan, the river being 100 yards wide at this place ; fords are said to exist also near Karaband and Mahmadi, and there is a ferry at the village of Mahmadi j these places are all situated in the Rud-hilleh district. The Rud-hilleh stream divides the Shabankareh district on its right bank from the districts of Dashtistan and Angali on its left; and in its lower course it bisects longitudinally the fertile part of the district which is called, after it, Eud-hilleh. A large shallow bay in the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq ; it is situated RUHUM in Biyadh between Qatif Town and the port of 'Oqair, about 35 miles (DOHAT)* from the former and 26 miles from the latter ; and it divides Barr- adh -Dhahran to the north of it from Barr-al -'Oqair to the south. The entrance, the north side of which is marked by Has Buraiqat in Barr-adh -Dhahran, is about 3 miles wide; inland the bay expands and has a roughly circular shape and a diameter of 6 or 7 miles. Along the south side of the entrance stretches a line of sand hills called Tall-az- * Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent in Bahrain, has ascertained, by very care ful inquiry, that several names in the neighbourhood of Dohat Ruhum are misplaced in the present naval charts. Thus the real D5hat Ruhum has been marked ' Duhat Thalum ' ; the name of ' Kureya ' has been transferred to Has Buraiqat ; and Tall- az-Zabanat figures as ^ Hamadiya '.

They have 80 houses at Jau, 20 at Busaitin and 15 at ■ y. Muharraq Town. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. L fl f RUMAI- THAH A town or settlement in Turkish 'Iraq, now half deserted on account of the drying up of the reach of the Euphrates upon which it stands; it is situated upon both banks of the river above Samawah Town, ap parently less than half way from that place to Diwaniyah. The houses of the place are scattered about among gardens and plantations so that their number is difficult to estimate ; but it is placed at 600, mostly low mud huts, of which a large proportion are now deserted. There is no bridge connecting the two parts of the town. The inhabitants of Uumaithah, whose number does not exceed 2^500 souls, are all Shfahs by religion, and with the exception of about 70 Persians they are all Arabs by race. Animals are kept, except camels ; and the place possesses about 3,500 date palms. There are 180 shops, chiefly of cloth merchants, grocers and druggists; but of these 40 are now unoccupied. A few rough carpets manufactured Ihj the surrounding tribe are obtainable. Rumaithah deals with both Basrah and Baghdad and in the days of its prosperity was a centre of commercial distribution serving a considerable area : after the date harvest a good deal of business is still transacted here with the Arabs of the neighbourhood- Manchester cottons and drugs and groceries are the chief imports, while the principal articles of export are barley, wheat, Idhrah, ghi, wool and hides : the annual value of the imports is estimated at about £T.12,000 and of the exports at about £T. 23,500. Eumaithah is in the Nahiyah of Abu Juwarir (also called the Nahiyah of Bumaithah) in the Qadha of Samawah and is the seat of the Mudir. This official formerly had his residence in a stone fort on the left bank of the river near the end of the town, but he has changed his quarters. iisloic kt ilajl ilk aljdlec i tkoi itag btk i Int. ai ife tie ilami iii i jimlly iiliell ^ll ; j '%(]RUMMAH (WADI -AE-) The longest valley in all Arabia, it begins in the Harrat Khaibar RUMMAH j^-towards the western side of the peninsula and sweeps north- (WADI-AR-) eastward; after bisecting the district of Qasim and traversing the Dah^nah it ends near Jabal Sanam in the neighbourhood of the ShattT al-'Arab. In the successive stages of its course this great Wadi bears different names, and though really one valley it does not form, at the present time, a continuous waterway: the floods of the upper portion never, it is said, succeed in passing the Dahanah, and the lower end is blind and seems to lose itself in the gravelly plains to the north of Kuwait. Its place of origin, which is at the eastern foot of Jabal Abyadh, * a k of Harrat Khaibar, lies about 35 miles west-south-west of Hayat and has an elevation of some 5,000 feet or more : Jabal Abyadh has itself an altitude of 6,000 t feet above the sea, and is therefore the highest known point in Najd. From its commencement to the point where it enters Qasim near Rass, a distance of about 200 miles in a direct line, the Wadi is generally called Wadi Risha U) and has an almost due easterly direction; here it runs through an uninhabited country, the banks are often of clay and gravel, and the bed is sometimes 3 miles across from eliff to cliff. On its downward way it receives several tributary Wadis, the first being Wadi Makhit kii', which comes down on its left bank from the exceedingly barren and monotonous desert of Zarb in the Harrah, and the next Wadi Qahid at the head of -which stands Thurghud, also on the left and from the Harrah, The third tributary, Mubhil , is likewise on the left, and between it and the last lies the wilderness of Kalankuwah. Then follow Wadi Rakub on the right; Wadi Sha'abah, on the left, draining the Sha'abah district of Jabal Shammar and having the villages of Grliazalah and Mustajiddah not far from its left bank ; Wadi Jadak on the right ; Wadi-al- Miyah or Wadi Jarlr ^, the greatest of all the tributaries, coming in from the right at a place called Hamaliyah; Wadi Thalabut from the left, the outlet of the drainage of the country immediately east of Qasim ; finally Wadi Garib on the right, after the twin hills of Abanat, between which the main valley passes, have been left behind. The next section is that situated in Qasim, the true Wadi-ar- Rummah, often called simply ' Al-Wadi. ' At Rass where it enters * Most of the names in this paragraph are from Huher, who has not given the Arabio ^uwalents of all ; the rest are from Doughty. t As calculated by Lieutenant P. Fraser Hunter from Huber's observations (see foot. Bote to article Jabal Sbammar. 5 X1602 RUMMAH (WADI-AR-) Qasinij, its course turns to the nortli-eastj a direction whicli it thereafter f steadily pursues. In the sandy plain of Qasim the bed of the Wadi is ^ hardly discernible by an unpractised eye; it first passes the towns of Eass and Khabrah, and after them it leaves the Qasim capitals of 1 'Anaizah and Buraidah on its right and its left respectively. The arable lands of Rass lie in the Wadi bed ; its palm groves ave upon the high - bants. Below the fields of Rass are those of Khabrah stretching 1 for 5 miles down the hollow of the valley. Between 'Anaizah and Buraidah, Wadi-ar-Rummah is full of palm groves attaining a breadth of as much as a mile ; the water here is only 5 to 10 feet below the surface^ but it is brackish and fever is prevalent among the negroes who tend the plantations. These outlying plantations, which belong to 'Auaizah. are ancient ; bnt they are the first to suffer in time of war and old trees are consequently seldom found among them. A village here, called Wadi, is for the most part temporary and is at its full size only in the date harvest. In the centre of the bed is much good loam, but it cannot be tilled on account of the saltness of the subsoil water; it bears only tamarisks and desert bushes, and in places the ground is covered with a white efflorescence. In leaving Qasim Wadi-ar-Rummah seems to take temporarily a more northward direction, for it is reported to pass between Sarif and Rakaiyah. From Qasim downwards the valley preserves its general north-easterly direction and perhaps bears the comprehensive name of Bat In; but some distinguish the portion lying in the Dah^nah as Wadi-al-Mustawi and call only the remainder Batin or Batain. Of the section between Qasim and the frontier of Kuwait little is known except that at Thuwairat about 50 miles below 'Anaizah, the valley is blocked by a great natural dam consisting of sand dunes ; that it is a ^ route of caravans from and to the north, and that it contains a few halting places with a little water, the most important politically being that of Hafar, about 160 miles west south-west of Kuwait Town.* Except in time of flood Wadi-ar-Rummah is dry. Great floods do not occur on the average more than twice or thrice in a century, and the Wadi, even when the water rises, can be crossed by camel riders except where the stream is confined. The last great flood was about 1888, • when the waters pent up by the Thuwairat dam washed back towards 'Anaizah and formed a lake of about 200 square miles which remained 1 — ; ■ — • ' ^ — —-— ^ ^ ~ rdflH * Some of the other stages are described in the article on the Kuwait principality and, under lioute II, in the article on Najd: see also the articles Batin, Hafar and 1 Riqa'i,rust A q for two yoars and attracted many watGr-fowl not seen before, within the memory of man, in Central Arabia.

Limits. —The coast of Ruus-al-Jibal may be considered to begin at Dibah bay in the Gulf of 'Oman and to terminate, after running round Has Musandam, at Ras Sha'am in the Persian Gulf. The inland boundary of Ruus-al-Jibal between Dibah and Ras Sha'am has not been determined; but the route which runs from Dibah by Khatt to Ras-al- Khaimah Town is regarded as the boundary between the country of the Shihuh on the north and that of the Sharqiyin and other tribes on the south. These are the boundaries of Ruus-al-Jibal in the political sense and define the scope of the present article, but geographically the Shamailiyah tract with its hills belongs to Ruus-al-Jibal. Thy sic al characteristic*. —The whole district is a maze of barren mountains. On the east side these rise abruptly from the sea, and the east coast is accordingly precipitous throughout, the cliffs being frequently undercut at the water-level; where valleys come down from the hills, however, small sandy bays often occur. The northern portion of Ruus-al- Jibal is indented by numerous deep-water inlets, some of considerable extent, the largest being Ghnbbat Ghazirah or Malcolm Inlet and Khor-ash-Sham or Elphinstone Inlet; their navigation is rendered difficult for sailing vessels by bafflino: winds, and only such native boats enter them as can be propelled by oars. On the western coast the hills, from the entrance of Khor-ash-Sham to Ras-ash-Sha'am, closely adjoin the sea. The mountains of Ruus-al-Jibal are almost entirely bare; but some scanty vegetation affording pasture for goats grows in the fissures of the rock, and there are date-groves in some of the valleys, especially where they debouch upon the coast. Wild animals *Three views from the sea of Ruus-al-JIbal will be found in Chart No. 2373 2837A, For authorities, maps and charts, see footnote to article 'Oman Sultanate ; vide also the Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for March 1905, where a nav^l appreciation of particular places will be found.KXTtTS-AL-JIBAL 1605 are said to include the fox, jackal, and striped hysena; and Jayakar^s wild goat is fairly common, especially in tlie hills near Limah. The chief peaks in the district are that by Europeans called Fine Peak, 4,470 feet high, 8 miles south-west of Khasab; Jabal-al-Harim by the Shihuh called Tutuh »yy, in the centre of the peninsula 15 miles south of Khasab, 6,750 feet high with a small table-top; and Jabal Qa^awah sy*, 8 miles north-north-west of Dibah^ height 5,800 feet. There are also 2 peaks, each 3,000 feet high, which overlook Khor-ash-Sham and are called Jabal-ash-Sham and Jabalash Sibi or, by the SMhuh, Jabal Sa^adun and Qarn Ghubar. A peak adjoining the Fakkal-Asad strait is named Jabal Qafa^an Inhabitants.— The fixed population of Ruus-al-Jibal are entirely of the Shihuh tribe, with the exception of some Dhahuriyin who inhabit the villages of Shabus and Shisah and most of the villages in Ghubbat Ghazirah and Khor-ash-Sham •, from the topographical table below it will be seen that the number of the settled inhabitants of the coast, where alone such are found is about 13,750 souls. In the interior of the district the people are all Bedouins of the Shihuh tribe.

In the foregoing table a few unimportant and uninhabited islands are omitted, of which the native names have not been ascertained with certainty. Administration. —Ruus-al-Jibal is a district in the Sultanate of ; 0man. The Sultan is represented by a Wali who has his seat at Khasab; in the article on which his position is described. The district brings in no revenue to the Masqat exchequer and it probably does not even pay for its own administration—if the slight political supervision exercised by the Wali may be called by such a name. The amount annually collected by the Wali as Zakat is about $ 600, and the present Sultan of 'Oman (Saiayid Faisal) has in addition, out of his own private property, assigned him at Khasab a date plantation and land of the value of $ 1,000 annually. ruwahah Singular Ruwahi or Ruwaihi ^^3)* This important tribe of (bani) Hajar in the Sultanate of 'Oman are said to be of N izari descent, but ^ they are now attached to the Hinawi political faction; in religion theyRUWAHAH (BANI) 1615 are Ibadhis. Their principal seat is the upper part of Wadi Samail, called Wadi Bani Ruwahah^ which they entirely monopolise, and where they have about 900 houses; but they also inhabit the lower villages of 'Adhdah (50 houses), Eissah (II) (20 houses), Rufai'ah (80 houses), Qarwashiyah (50 houses), Naghzah (50 houses), Suharah (100 houses), Hijrat Wilad Sa^ad (50 houses), Jammar (75 houses), Hijrat-al-Bakriyin (100 houses), Ibrahiimyah (40 houses). Bait Walad-al-Khalili (100 houses), Dighal (100 houses), Subarah (50 houses), Daqdaqain (20 houses) and Tasawir (25 houses). In Wadi Boshar they are found at Falaij-ash-Sham (15 houses), in Wadi Dim a at Hajir (100 houses), and in 'Oman Proper at Izki, Khadhra Bin-Daifa' (60 houses), Nizwa (4 houses) and Saddi (10 houses). In Wadi Mistal, on the northern side of the Western Ha jar hills, they occur at Ghubrat Bani Huwahah (40 houses) and Hail (40 houses). The greater part of Wadi ^Andam belongs to them and the whole of Wadi Mahram. Th.eir total number is perhaps 18,500 souls. The Bani Ruwahah are a troublesome tribe; they were consistently adversaries of the Sultan of 'Oman during the reign of Turki (1871-88) and are supposed to be still very hostile to the ruling power ; but they can be subsidised when necessary, and in 1905 the Sultan made use of them against the Bani Riyam of Izki and Birkat-al-Moz. They are perpetual enemies of the Bani Jabir, the hostility between the tribes being', it is believed, a remnant of the ancient historic feud of Abs and cD y y Dhubyan. The Bani Bawahah have no general Tamimah : each section is ruled by a Shaikh of its own. The principal subdivisions of the Bani Ruwahah are :— Section.

The place is protected by a small fort with four towers, and drinking water is fetched from the Umm Dha'an well, 1^ miles inland souih of Ruwais. 5 L1618 RUWI EUWI SA'AD (BAIT) 4*^ An important but not large village in the Masqat District of the ^Oman Sultanate, 24 miles south-soutli-west of Matrah; it is situated in a small W adi of its own which is a right-bank tributary of Wadi ^ Adai. It consists of about 50 houses^ a few of mud, the rest huts ; the inhabi tants are 'Awamir and Bani Wahaib. Plenty of good water is obtain able from wells 50 feet deep, and the cultivation of the village, which is a market-garden for Matrah and Masqat Town, includes sugar, maize, onions, lettuce, radishes and brinjals. There are fine dates, about 400 &gt; trees, also mangoes and tamarinds ; some of the palms are the private property of Saiyid Faisal, the present Sultan of 'Oman. A refers ence to the article on the Masqat District will show that Ruwi is the point from which all routes from Mat rah to the interior diverge, and this fact has more than once invested it with military importance when rebellious tribes were threatening an attack on Masqat. 1 here is a fort, now practically in ruins, resembling the smaller fortifications at 1 Masqat Town.

SA'AD (SHAIKH) A village in Turkish 'Iraq with a small police post and a customs fc house , it is situated in the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah on the right bank — of the Tigris, 25 miles above 'All-al-Gharbi and 60 below Kut-al- I Amarah by river. It consists of 50 to 100 houses of sun-dried brick j and about 25 shops. The inhabitants are mostly Kurds, and the ad joining Arab tribes are the Al Bu Daraj on the east and the Bani J Rabi'ah on the west. The trade, such as it is, resembles that of 'Ali-al-Grharbi. SA'AD Singular Sa^adi A numerous tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate I (YAL) estimated at 18,000 souls. The Yal Sa'ad occupy a block of territoiy. 25 miles in length, towards the east end of Batinah, but a numbei of the coast places in their tract are in other hands. Their traditional , boundary on the east is the lower course, called for this reason Wadi-al- ^SA'AD (YAL) 1621 Qasini; of Wadi Bani Kharus , on tlie west the furthest point they occupy is Khadhra. Their principal villages or towns are Masna'ah (50 houses), Tau-ash-Shawi (20 houses), Tarif (60 houses), Muladdah (400 houses), Raqqas (100 houses), Gharaifah (500 houses), Sur-al-Qarat (200 houses), Tharmad (250 houses), Bat-hah Suwaiq (600 houses), Khadhra (230 houses), and Sur Haiyan (50 houses); of these only the first and the three last are upon the coast. They are also found at Khabbah and Hadhib (II). The Yal Sa^ad belong to the Hinawi faction and are Ibadhis by reli gion. Among other Arabs they are reputed unwarlike, mean-spirited and inhospitable and are little respected. They are wealthy, owning hun dreds of thousands of date-palms and a good deal of land under grain^ also many trading and fishing-boats ; but some of them are Bedouins. They have always shown a predilection for the ''Azzan branch of the ruling family in ; 0inan, perhaps because Rustaq adjoins their own territory ,* and they pay no taxes to the present Sultan of ; 0man. In 1874, when Ibrahim of Rustaq seized Masna'ah, they plundered some British sub jects of the place and a heavy fine was recovered from them at the instance of the British Government, not without difficulty. On the whole, however, they are peaceably disposed, and, so long as they are left alone, give no trouble to the Sultan's Government. The principal subdivisions of the Yal Sa'ad are : — Section.

Jau-as-Sa^adan is a low tract covered with a thin coating of yellow sand. The name is said to be derived from a plant called Sa^adan which grows in the tract and of which the thorns or prickles, falling off when the plant withers, make it impossible for people to walk about barefoot. filUlld U iat'Af jl iitliflw ijiil at Hi Ifeli SABAI' JLXX jju An important tribe of Najd, partly migratory and partly settled. Distribution. —^The Sabai^, both Bedouin and non-Bedouin, have a wide distribution. Their nomads are found as far to the north-east as Banban in ; Aridh, as well as about Hair on Wadi Hanifah and in the district of Kharj, and they sometimes visit StiniinSll; but their headquarters are in the district of Wadi Sabai' in the far south-west, to which they have given their name. They are probably not unknown in the districts inter mediate in position between those just mentioned. Non-nomadic Sabai^ like their Bedouin fellow-tribesmen, are found chiefly in Wadi Sabai^ especially at ''Amair, Dhurum, Hanqan, Hazam, Khazam, Lamlah, Kanyah, Raudhah^ Suwaiyid and Ziyad, and at Khurmah in the Wadi Turabah division of that district. Further to the north-east they occur at the desert villages of Duwadimi, Khanuqali and SlWarah ; in Washam at Shaqrah and Wathaithiyah; in Qasim at 'Anaizah, ■'Aushazlyah, Badayah and 'Wadi; in Sadalr at ^Attar, Ghat, Harmah, Hautah, Khatamah, Khis, Majma' and Ruwaidhah; in 'Aridh at ; Awainidh, Barrah, Ghiyanah, Haraimlah, Hizwah, Malham^ Bghabah, Salbukh and Sidus in Mahmal, at ^Ammariyah, ''lib, ^Audah, 'Arjah, Masani'' and Hair on Wadi Hanifah, and at Dhrumali; in Kharj at Dilam and Yamamahj in Hariq at Hariq town : in Hautah at Hautah town and Hilwah; and in Aflaj at Lailah.

Some authorities regard the entire Sahul tribe as being a section of the Sabai'. The number of the noinad Sabai' is altogether uncertain: the settled Sabai* are included in the estimated populations of the districts where they are found. Character, —Little is known of the Sabai^ Bedouins, and the settled Sabai^ resemble in their characteristics the other sedentary tribes of Najd. In religion the Sabai^ are Hanabilah, or, in other words, Wahhabis who claim to be Sunnis. Political position. —The bulk of the Sabai' have always been subject to the ruler of Riyadh, and 40 years ago the value of their annual tribute was estimated at $8^000. During the recent struggle in Najd the Sabai' were ranged on the Wahhabi side. Wadi Sabai' is the south-westernmost district of Southern Najd.

'Amair About 12 miles east- south-east of Ranyah. A village of about 250 houses of Sabai' of the Wuzran section, This is a settlement rather than a village or town, and is scat tered over a large Boundaries. —Wadi Sabai' is bounded on the east by Widyail L Dawasir; on the south by Bishah and Wadi Tathllth j on the west ^ by the Hijaz province; and on the north by an unknown tract which separates it from Hazm-ar-Raji. Physical character and divisions, —Arabs state that the surface of Wadi Sabar* is level, but that it is traversed by occasional hollows. iiL It is mostly sandy desert ; but here and there earth crops up, and in such places dates, wheat, barley and maize are grown. Both springs and wells exist, the wells being generally shallow; and there are depressions in which rain water collects and forms ponds that remain for as much as a year and become the abode of aquatic birds. Little is known of the district except from native accounts*; but it seems clear that the name Wadi Sabai^ applies not ; as might have been expected, to one great valley, but rather to an open plain with two main lines of drainage. The north part of the district appears to fall to Wadi Turabah, Tarabah or Trubah uy, which has its head in the Hijaz mountains about 150 miles east of Makkah and is reported to send water down to a depression called 'Irq ^ near Shaqrah in Washam; if these data are accurate the direction of Wadi Turabah is from south-west to north-east and its length some 350 miles. The drainage of the southern portion of Wadi Sabai' appears to be carried by a Wadi called Ranyah, which rises near the head of Wadi Turabah and runs eastwards for perhaps 120 miles to a point where it is joined by a great Wadi named Bishah. Wadi Bishah seems to have its origin in the district of 'Asir, possibly 150 miles to the south-west of its junc tion with Wadi Ranyah. It should be added that the term Wadi Sabai' b seems to be used at times in a restricted sense to describe Wadi Ranyah , only, or even a part of it. Topography of Wadi B any ah or Wadi Sabai' proper. —The following appear to be the principal villages and points of interest in Wadi Ranyah or Sabai' proper :— *JoCQard*8 3nap at the end of Mengin' only.

Dates, figs and grapes are grown by irrigation from wells, 3 fathoms deep, of good water. The western villages of the Wadi supply themselves with wood from this place* Cultivation as at 'Amair above, but there are also peaches and melons, and irri gation is assisted by drainage from hills near by. These hills are called J abal Dhurum ; they begin here and stretch westwards passing between Harrah and Khasah below. Dates, figs, peaohes, grapes and melons are grown, but no cereals. The wells contain good water and are 2 fathoms deep. The nomads frequent ing this place are Sabai', ShalaWah gjK. and Buqum. Harrah is said to be infested by scorpions and by snakes of the kinds called Haiyah and Hanash. Dates, figs, grapes and pumpkins are grown; and the wells, which are 2 fathoms deep, contain good water. Here resides a Sharif named Mansur-bin- Madhi who about 30 years ago was deputed to Wadi Sabai* to collect1626 SABAI* (WADi; Name. Position. Nature. R emabks. Zakat by the Sharif of Makkah. This emissary was unable to realise anything on behalf of the Sharif ; but be con tinues to reside here, enjoying the barren respect of the people. Huwaiyah m About. 20 miles north-north-west of Ranyah. A summer camping ground of Sabai' and 'Ataibah Be douins. There are about 15 wells here, 3 fathoms deep and containing good water, but no cultivation of dates or cereals exists. Khasah About 50 miles west by south of Ranyab, on the south side of Jabal Dhurum. A summer camping ground of Sabai' Bedouins. There are some 10 wells here, 4 fathoms deep and containing good water, scattered over an area of about 3 miles in extent. Khazam r!^ About 8 miles south-west of Ranyah. A walled village of about 150 houses of Sabai' of the Wuz- ran section. There is cultivation of dates, figs, peaches, grapes and pome granates. Wells are 2 fathoms deep and the water good. Lamlali About 7 miles south-west of Dhurum, at the foot of Jabal Dhurum. A walled village of Sabai' of the Al Mijami'ah section. Date?, figs, and grapes grow here, also the Bambar tree of which the fruit and leaves are used as medicine* A number of the in habitants were once slaves of the Al Shanaif, but now they have obtained their freedom and some of them own landi The Shaikh of Lamlah is Shaikh also of Su- waiyid. Munkhashshah (spelling uncei' ' tain) About 35 miles east-north-east of Ran yah. A camping ground of Sabai' Bedouins, This is a sandy locality with a dozen wells, 3 fathoms deep, of good water. Namlah About 40 miles north-west of Eanyah. A summer camping ground of Sabai' Bedouins. There are about 8 wells here, 3 fathoms deep, of good water.SABAI' (WADI) 1627 Name. Qunsaliyah Ranyah Raudhah Position. 50 to 60 miles north-north-west of Eanyah. This may be taken as the central place in Wadi Sabai', but it seems to lie be tween the actual centre of the dis* trict and its south west corner. It is probably 90 to 100 miles east of Turabah. Abont 6 miles south west of Ranyah. Nature, Eemabks. A summer camping ground of Sabai' Bedouins. Thfc capital of Wadi Sabai' proper, though perhaps not the largest place in it; Ranyah consists of 200 houses of Sabai' of the Sudah section, ex clusive of a very large number of huts which are scattered among the date plantations. In summer the popu lation is about doubled by an influx of Bedouins of the Sabai' tribe. A walled and fortified village consisting of about 400 houses of Sabai' of the Maraghin, and Sudah sections, Dawasir, and a few 'Anizah. The ground is sandy and the wells, about 10 in number, are 2J fathoms deep and contain good water. This is the seat of Fidai'-bin-Bahas, ti tular Shaikh of Wadi Sabai' proper, but he has little in fluence over the Shaikhs of villages, and some parts of the Wadi are altogether exempt from bis authority. The date plantations are fine and extensive; and figs, peaches and pomegranates are also produced. Wells are numerous and contain good water at 2 fathoms. There is a fort called Qasr-al-Mar a g h i n occupied by the Shaikh of the place; also a con siderable bazaar, said to contain 100 shopsj and a large J ami' mosque. This is the market town of the district and goods are imported chiefly from M akkah; coffee however is brought from Najran and arms and ammuni tion from Qatar via Aflaj and Wadi Dawasir. Swords, lances and daggers come either from Wadi Dawasir or from Haahramaut, the best daggers— called Hadhram — being from the latter. There are not many craftsmen here, only a few blacksmiths, car penters and cobblers. Wells are 3 fathoms deep and contain good water. The date plan-1628 SABAI' (WADI) Name. Position. Nature.

A tract where wheat and barley are ex- teneively grown in winter, this being one of the few places in Wadi Sabai' where there is any cultivation of cereals. The cultivation is car ried on by agricul- tarists from different villages, who build themselves huts of date leaves here for the season. The number of huts, it is said, sometimes amounts to 1,000. There are 200 or more wells with good water at 3 fathoms, but dates are entirely absent. Several miles to the south-east of Riqah is a hill called w Jabal Sillah aiw , Sharif (Qulban) In the extreme north-west corner of the district, near Wadi Turabah. A summer camping ground of Sabai' bedouins. The ground here is stony. There are half a dozen wells, of good water, 3? fathoms deep. Suwaiyid (spelling uncer tain) Apparently near Lamlah. A village of 100 houses, mostly of Sabai' of the A1 Mijami'ah section, but a few of Dawasir. The Shaikh of Lamlah is Shaikh also of the greater part of Su- waiyid; but the small Dawasir community have a separate Shaikh of their own. Dates, figs, peaches and grapes are the chief products and there are many wells, 2 fathoms deep, of good water. Taghdawi (J abal) Begins on the north side of Hazam and runs north for some miles.

A large walled village of 300 houses of S_abai' of the Bani 'Amir and Bani Thaur sections, of 'Anizah, of Bani Zaid, and of Dawasir. Besides the town proper there are many Qasrs, houses, and huts scattered in the very extensive date plantations: some of these are practi cally separate vil lages. If these suburbs be included the estimated size of the place must be doubled. The people, as elsewhere throughout this valley, are Wah- habis. The Shaikh of Khurmah, at present Malaisan- bin-Dhabban of the Eani Thaur, divides with the Amir of Turabah the sover eignty of the Wadi. Large numbers of Bedouins camp in the environs of Khurmah in winter. Eemaeks. There is a large fort belonging to the Shaikh, one mosque of great size, and a bazaar containing a considerable number of shops. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Dawasir and of immigrants from Qasim ; imports are partly from Makkah and partly from Qasim. Coffee and American piece- goods are brought from Yaman and Najran, while arms and ammunition are imported either from Kuwait via Qasim and Washam or from Qatar via Aflaj and Wadi Dawasir. Gun powder is obtained from Makkah also. The date plantations are described as being of enormous size and owned exclu sively by the Bani 'Amir and Bani Thaur, between whom they are about equally divided. A good deal of wheat and barley is grown among the dates, but very little elsewhere. Water is good and stands at about 4 fathoms below ground level.1630 SABAI' (WADI) Name. Position. Nature. Eehaeks.

Eumadan is independent in internal matters, but in its external rela tions it is politically dependent on Tura bah village. Sultan- bin-Ja'afar, a refugee from the Sharif of Makkah, resides here. Shudhnb d-Jtis-w About 15 miles east of Khurmah. A camping ground of Sabai' Bedouins of the Bani 'Amir and Bani Thaur seo- tions. There are a score of good wells, only 2 fathoms deep. Turabah On the soutb-south- east side of Jabal Hadhan , a i hill which is about ! 150 miles east of Makkah and can be seen from the Burai- ! dah-lVIakkah pil- i grim loute. A long narrow vil lage of 150 houses of Buqum, surrounded bj date groves ; there is a considerable subur ban population, who inhabit houses, huts and watch towers among the date groves. Large numbers of Bedouin Buqum encamp in the environs in summer. There is little or no trade at Turabah, of which the market town is Rumadan. There is one large mosque. Cultivation is chiefly of dates; the wells are 3 fathoms deep, and the water is good. The Amir of Turabah, at present Manahi-bin-Mahmil, rules the southern (that is probably the upper) part of Wadi Turabah, which is outside the jurisdic tion of the Shaikh of Khurmah. There is no Qadhi at Tura bah and cases are referred by the Amir to the Qadhi of Rumadan. General. —The preceding tables sufficifTitly explain the facts regard ing the population^ agriculture, trade and political organisation of Wadi Sabai J . and no further analysis is necessary here. On the information available the settled population may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls ; of whom about 10,000 are located in Wadi Sabai' proper and theSABIA.NS 1631 remainder in Wadi Tnrabah. Except in the villages of Humadan and Turabah^ wbich belong to the Buqum, Sabai^ everywhere greatly pre dominate ; but a few Dawasir and even 'Anizah. and Bani Zaid^ also tribes known as Shalawah and Shanabarah^ are intermingled with them. Camels are numerous and horses not rare, but cattle and donkeys appear to be scarce in proportion. Eanyah, Turabah and Khurmah are, as will be seen, the three political centres. A village situated on the right bank of the Jarrahi^ but separated SABI &amp; ^ w caj j. x JJ AM - A S') from the stream by a few hundred yards of low-lying ground, a little below the point where the river emerges from a low range of hills and S; ^ enters the Jarrahi District. Q he village is 24^ miles from RaniUZ Town on the route to Ma'shur. An old disused canal of considerable size takes off from the right bank of the Jarrahi about 1 mile above the village ; after passing a large flat-topped mound which seems to be an ancient site, it cuts through a low mud ridge and can be traced beyond this for several miles running nearly parallel to the river. At Cham-as- Sabi there are about 15 permanent habitations, mud houses, belonging to Bani Khalid who are connected with the Bawiyeh ; and in winter a large encampment of about 200 tents of the same tribe is located here. The low land near by is regularly cultivated. The village is said to derive its name from Sabians who formerly inhabited it; and among this sect a vague tradition is current that many of their faith were once massacred here, but they are unable to assign any date to the supposed event. Along with the rest of the Jarrahi District, Cham-as-Sabi is farmed by the Shaikh of Muhammareh from its owner the Nizam-as-Saltaneh. In Arabic and Persian Subba : singular Sabi The Sabians SABIANS are a remarkable people dispersed in small communities over parts of Turkish 'Iraq and Persian ^Arabistan, but united everywhere by the possession of a common religion. In 'Arabistan they claim a Syrian origin and say that their ancestors formerly owned most of Shushtar, and they have also a tradition that many of them were once massacred at Cham-as-Sabi. Distribution and numoers, — Suq -ash -Shuyukh, on the Euphrates, Where they number 700 souls, is now the headquarLers of the Sabians |1632 SAB IAN S and they are found also at 'Amarah (1,000 sonls), Nasiriyah (300 souls), QaFat Salih, and Shatrat-al-Muntafik in'Iraq. In Southern ''Arabistan they occur at Muhammareh. (40 families), at Hawizeh Town which 60 years ag-o was one of their important places (20 families), and at Aminiyeh on the Karun river (4 families) : there are also a few at the port of Buziyeh. The numbers of the Sabians have greatly declined in recent years and are still dwindling. There are none now at Ahwaz Village or Dizful or SMshtar Towns, but there are still 15 families at Shahwali in the Shushtar District. Their religious head, known as the Qari or Reader, has his residence at Suq-ash-Shuyukh. Life and occupations. —In dress and appearance the Sabians are indistinguishable from their Arab neighbours, nor do they, perhaps, differ from them in descent, thoug'h their speech is different and their Arabic is broken and less emphatically pronounced than that of the Musulmans. The men all wear their beards long. They show a special aptitude for working in gold and silver, and probably a considerable ma jority of them follow that profession: in 'Iraq, however, many are canoe builders and carpenters : few or none are agriculturists. The use of the term ' Sabian by different authorities at different times has not been consistent, and it may be doubted whether the Subba of the present day are the same as the Sabiuna of the Quran. Religion and customs,— V &amp; q exact nature of the Sabian religion and its affinities with star-worship, Judaism, Christianity, and Muhammadanism have not been clearly ascertained. It is stated, however, that baptism is one of the principal rites and that water enters into all the important ceremonies; that the Sabians respect Yahya or John the Baptist as a prophet, regarding him as a re-incarnation of Seth, and that they consider both Moses and Christ to have been false teachers : their paradise is said to be located in the North Star. They possess scriptures of their own and a book of ritual. It is said that strangers are not admitted to their rites and that these are conducted in Syriac. They are an uncircum- cised race, not monogamous ; but a second wife is seldom taken except when the first has proved barren. SABIYAH A remarkable inlet of the sea ranning north-north-west for nearly (KH0R-AS-) 30 m ii eg from the entrance of Kuwait Bay to Warbah island, and dividing, throughout its entire course, the island of Bubiyan from thesabiyah (rhor-as) 1633 main. a small prolongation of the Khor passing west of Warbah island joins Khor-ath-Tha^alab on a branch of which Umm Qasr stands; and a channel with soundings of 3 to 8 fathomapparently known as Khor Bubiyan , runs along the south side of Warbah island and unites the head of Khor -as -Sabiyah witb that of Khor 'Abdullah.* The average width of: Khor-as-Sabiyah appears to be about three- quarters of a mile ; at its mouth it is one mile broad, but at places higher up it contracts to as little as half a mile. The banks are swampy, but there are a good many boulder^ especially among the eastern shore. A route which runs along the western side of the Khor is part of the first route described in the article on the Kuwait Principality. The sound ings appears to vary from 1 to 5 fathoms ; but navigation just outside the mouth of the Khor is difficult on account of numerous patches and rocks which are almost dry at low water, and even native boats cannot enter at less than half flood. Qasr-as-Sabiyah is a fortified mud enclosure belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait ; it is situated on the east bank of the Khor about 3 miles from the tip of the promontory that divides the mouth of Khor-as- Sabiyah from Kuwait Bay. The enceinte of the Qasr is about 100 yards long by 80 yards broad, and at high tide the sea approaches it very closely ; in spite, however, of a rather steeply shelving bank, landing is difficult, on account of mud, in all states of the tide. The garrison consists of about a dozen retainers of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The supply of water, from wells outside the enceinte, is brackish; there is a planta tion of about 300 young date trees. Qasr-as-Sabiyah formerly boasted some cultivation, which it owed to Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim, the enemy (now deceased) of the present Shaikh of Kuwait : but the place was ruined in hostilities between Shaikh Mubarak and some of his nephews about 1899. Qasr-as-Sabiyah is surrounded by some tamarisks which, in approaching the place from the west, first become visible at a distance of about 5 miles, * From a report by Commander Kemp, R.N., which, with a sketch chart, will be found in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for July 1902, it may be gathered that Khor Bubiyan and the upper part of Khor-as-Sabiyah were found navigable bj H.M.S. 'Sphinx,' but that the channel to the west of Warbah island was too narrow to be safe. The latter is a mere boat channel, 100 yards broad at the northern end, but widening to f of a mile (including swamps at high tide) at the southern end: see a report dated 24tb July 1905 by Captain E. W. S. Mabon, R.E., who calls this channel ' Khor Salem.' 5 M1634 SABAH SADAH Or Saiyids; singular Saiyid This article relates to a com- mTinity of Saiyids who had their origin in Qatar and afterwards, for the most part, removed to Bahrain in the train of the conquering 'Utub. There are still 70 families of Sadah at Ruwais in Qatar and a few at Doliall ; in Bahrain their headquarters are Hadd where they have 150 houses^ and they have also 10 houses on Tarut Island off Qatif. In Bahrain and Qatar they are pearl merchants or divers ; some of those in Qatar are breeders of cattle. By religion they are Sunnis of the Hanafi. and Shafi/i schools^ and they continue to be notorious for their fanaticism and slave-dealing propensities. ]! uiles I SADAIB Sometimes pronounced Isdair. A district of Najd, the northernmost of the Wahhabi dominions proper^ and one of much general and political importance. Sadair is bounded on the east and north by deserts,—on the east, namely, by the Dahclnah, and on the north by a Nafud which passes between Jabai Tuwaiq and Qasim and contains Wadi-ar -Rum- mah; on the west the Jaraifah valley separates Sadair from the district of Washam, and on the south the valley of 'Ajsh marts its border with ^Aridh. The length of Sadair, which is greatest from north west to south-east, is about 145 miles. P'/iysical features, —The district thus defined practically coincides with the northern part of the Tuwaiq plateau or range, consequently the geography of the hills hereabouts is also the geography of Sadair; from this statement, however, must be excepted the flat, low country in the extreme north between Zilfi and Wadi-ar -Rummah, lying between the Tuwaiq hills and the northern part of Qasim. The hilly portion of the district has an elevation increasing from north to south ; the bulk of its drainage goes eastward to the Daheinah ; and its principal features are four valleys or torrent beds which we now proceed to describe in order. The northernmost or Ghat valley, rising at no great distance to the east of Majma', the capital of Sadair, pursues a winding but generally northerly course by the villages of Ruwaidhah and Khis to Ghat, where it emerges from the hills and, being deflected by a projecting spur of Tuwaiq, turns westward into the Nafud; at one place shortly before reaching Ghat its fall is extremely abrupt. In time of flood the stream hi /SADAIR 1635 from this valley penetrates into tlie Nafud as far as the sand hills of Imghair-az-Zilfi Jd'J 10 miles from GhaC, where it is absorbed and disappears. At this place Im^hair there are wells, and in favour able seasons some cereals are grown by cultivators from Zilfi. The Ghafc valley is the only one in Sadair which drains to the west side of luwaiq; the other three all run eastwards. The next valley, that of Majma', has its origin in a group of 5 sum mits of Jabal Tuwaiq, calh d JViishqar , to the south-east of Majma' ; Mishqar is said to overlook from the north the plains of Washam. From Mishqar the valley of Majma , is described as running northwards for about 12 mile^ to Dhalmah , and thence 6 nnles north-eastwards to Majma', which is situated upon it. A little beyond Majma' it receives on the left a small tributary from Hannah ; and at about 10 miles beyond Majma' and to the east-south-east of that place, it reaches Qadhaimah } a locality where there are wells of 7 fathoms and where an affluent from the village s of Wu^hai and Ijwai comes in, apparently from the south-west. From Qadhaimjih the hol low continues for about 9 miles eastwards to Amtaiwi , and then for 12 miles further in the same direction till it ends in a Eodhah or bottom named Shahamah . Shah amah is situated in the Iblat-as-Sadair ^ , which seems to be a sort of plain lying entirely to the east of the Majma^-Jalajil route and reaching almost as far south as Tamair. The third valley, which we may call that of Tuwaim, begins in the neighbourhood of Dhalmah and trends at first south-ea&gt;twards to Jalajil which it leaves on the right, and Tnwaim which it leaves on the left bank; it then goes eastwards for about 15 miles and terminates in a Rodhah under ^Abaid-al-Iblah aIuJ } , a hill in the centre of 'Iblat-as-Sadair. The fourth valley, known as Batin-as-Sadair, is by far the most important and contains, with its affluents, a majority of the villages of the district. Its head is apparently a little to the west of Tuwaim, and it runs at first southwards, having Dakhilah, Raudhab, Hasun and Hautah upon its left bank, and then Janubiyah, ^Attar (with Janaifi j over against it) and 'Audah upon its right; at ^Audah, where it is about 15 miles north-west of the hamlet of Hasi in ''Aridh, it turns eastwards and exchanges the name of Batin-as-Sadair for that of 'Ajsh or '. a4 (:' • From this point to its termination, 15 miles to the eastward, in i a Rodhah called Haqaqah , it forms the boundary between Sadair and ^Aridht Haqaqah is about 25 miles north-west of the Khafs basin 5 H 21636 SAD AIR in 'Aridh. 'Ajsh has two tributaries from the north which enter it before it reaches Haqaqah ; the more western of the two comes down from the villages of Khatamah and ^Ashairah and the other from Tamair, It is stated that when the Tnwaim valley is heavily flooded part of its water overflows into the Khatamah affluent of 'Ajsh. Sadair is partly arable, especially in the north, and in the valleys just described which furrow its surface at intervals and are sometimes steep-sided. The rest of its surface is down-land with some pasture, but bearing few trees. The rocks and soil of Sadair are reported to be generally calcareous. Inhabit ants. —The settled population of the district appears, from the table of towns and villages at the end of this article, to amount to about 21,000 souls. The predominating tribe are the Bani TamilU with about 7,500 persons ; after them come the Bani Khadhir, or inferior tribes of the district collectively, who number about 4,000. These again are followed by the Dawasir, Fadhul, ^Anizah, and 'Ataibah, with strengths of 2,500 to 1,000 each ; the remainder are chiefly Shammar, or Qahtan, neither of whom are numerically considerable; there are also a very few Harb, Bani Khalid, Mutair and 'Awazim or Hawazim. The villagers of Sadair are described as hardy and of good physique, with a complexion in some cases almost ruddy. Their houses have ordinarily stone foundations, but the walls are of clay. The district is subject to visits from various Bedouin tribes, among whom are the ^Ataibah and the Mutair. Agricultriral and other resources, —The nature of cultivation in Sadair will be apparent from the topographical table which concludes this article. The crops are watered from wells of 6 to 20 fathoms ; the most important staples are dates, wheat and barley \ but lucerne, melons, water melons and some ordinary fruits such as grapes, citrons and pomegranates are also grown. Domestic animals are chiefly camels, donkeys, horned cattle and sheep and goats; both camels and bullocks are used to work the water lifts. Horses are few. Poultry and pigeons are plentiful in the villages of Sadair; but ducks, unless an occasional wild duck, are never seen. There is little local trade : Majllla , and Zilfi are the sole commercial centres, and they are so only upon a small scale. Communications. —The principal route is that frcm Buraidah to EiySdh, which traverses t}ie district lengthwise ; it is described in theSADAIR 1637 article on Najd. The roads of Sadair are not entirely safe, and the 'Ajsh valley in particular has an evil reputation as being haunted by marauding Bedouins, generally 'Ataibah J this fact is referred to by a local poet m a line m which he speaks of a UUJI Vj j^ j ' the neighbourhood of 'Ajsh, the highroad of the attacking bands.'' Administration. Sadair belongs to the Wahhabi dominions; it was formerly ruled through an indigenous family who had their seat at Majma'; but, as early as 1862 at least, a Wahhabi governor had been stationed at Tuwaim. There is again at the present time a non-local Wahhabi official in Sadair, but he has his headquarters at Majma'. The present relations of the Shaikh of Majma' with the Wahhabi ruler are noticed in the article on that town. Topography. The following are the chief towns and villages of Sadair in their alphabetical order :— Name. Ill ll Asliairah IjX&amp;C ** &gt;A A ^ 5 ' Position.

In all the tribe Dumber about 6,000 souls. A somewhat populous village or group of villages in the Aflaj district of Najd, covering a space of about six miles in length from north to south by two miles in breadth; the central portion of Saih appears to be about four miles south-east of Lailah and seven miles north-east of Raudhah. The settlement is said to consist of about 1^000 houses, of which 50 are occupied by Ashraf of the Hamid section and the remainder by Hani Khadhir. Some of the inhabitants of Lailah own date palms in Saih, but they never reside at Saih except in the date season, and even then their interests are sometimes left in charge of their cultivators or agents. On the other hand a large number of Dawasir of the 'Ammar section, estimated at 2,000 souls, flock into Saih in the hot weather ; nearly all the subsections of the 'Ammar own date groves here. The winter population may accordingly be estimated at 5,000 and the summer population at 7,000 persons j or, with the dependent village of Mishrif, at 5,500 and 7,500, respectively. The date plantations are described as extensive and as containing a prodigious number of trees; the other fruits of Najd are also grown. Wheat is cultivated, also maize and millet to a small extent, but not barley. Lucerne is plentiful. Water stands in the wells at less than a fathom below the surface of the ground and is of fair quality. Camels are few, but other livestock are found in the proportions usual in Najd, except horses; these the 'Ammar Dawasir possess in large numbers, but they do not keep them at Saih.SAIH 1649 The following table contains some particulars of the principal quarters and other points of interest in Saih Name.

Salalah is garrisoned by about 20 Askaris of the Sultan of 'Oman. SALALAH dJlU A long island or chain of islands off the coast of Dhafrah in Trucial Oman ; it begins 38 miles south-west of Abu Dhabi Town and extends westwards some 30 miles, parallel to the mainland and at a short distance from it. If we regard the group as one island, the land being practically continuous at low water, we may say that the east end is called Salali, the middle Abul Abyadh jjl, and the west end Miqaishit . The extreme western end is called Bas Miqaishit. SaUU i s included in the Abu Dhabi Principality. 5 2 SALALI JDU1652 salAmah-wa-binAt-ha salamah- wa- binat- ha* LjUJ. ^*11-. ' Salamah and her daughters/' known to Europeans as ' the Quoins,' a remarkable group of 3 rocky islets lying in the entrance of the Persian Gulf north of Musandam island. Salamah or the Great Quoin, 540 feet high, is 7 miles from Ras Musandam and visible, in clear weather, 27 miles. It is half a mile across, and in profile wedge-shaped, having the perpendicular fall on the south-east side: the north-west side alone is accessible : there is a small detached fragment of rock in the sea about 80 yards off the north side. The Little Quoin, 168 feet high, is 5 miles from Ras Musandam : its highest bluff is on the south side and this island is accessible from the north only. Between the 2 Quoins and a little to the north-east of a line ioining them is ' Gap Island,' the third of the group, which has cliffs all round and a peak 260 feet high in the centre. The Shihuh of Kumzar call the Great Quoin Mumar the Little Quoin Didamar or Shanaku /U and Gap Island Panaku /ii: Mumar ap pears to be a Kumzari word for ' mother ' and Didamar for 'daughter.' salamat oUlU An Arab tribe of the Ahwaz District in Southern 'Arahistan, numbering perhaps 1,600 souls ; they are connected politically with the Bawiyeh Most of the Salamat live in tents : they grow wheat and barley and own a considerable quantity of livestock.

Their territory from north to south has an extent of about 20 miles, beginning a few miles south of Hawizeh. Town} its eastern boundary is at a place called Shaikh Muhammad ; and on the west it includes part of the Karkheh or Karkheh-Tigris marshes. The majority of the tiibe engage in wheat and barley cultivation and own large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle besides about 3,000 camels ; but certain of the subdivisions inhabit the marshes, where they cultivate rice, keep buffaloes and cattle, and move about in Mashhufs and Taradahs. The fighting strength of the Hani Saleh is estimated at 1,000 horsemen and 3,350 footmen, and the proportion of rifles is about 1 to every 2 men.

At the south-eastern corner is a patch of sandstone, supplying material for the numerous solidly built tombs that are a feature of the place. Fresh water, derived from two copious ui springs named ; Ain-as-Safahiyah &lt;u^UuJI ^ and 'Ain-al-Khadlira ^ is abundant. There are two villages inhabited by Baharinah, who are pearl-divers, fishermen and cultivators : one, Kaflan , has 40 houses ; the other, Quryah has 35. To these places belong 1 Baqarah, 8 Mashuwahs and jollyboats and one other boat, all used for pearling; also 11 donkeys and 6 cattle. About 200 yards north of Nabi Salih is a still smaller island without houses, except 2 huts, but covered with date trees : it is called Jazaiyirah The date palms bere are now in the possession of Shaikh Khalid, brother of the Shaikh of Bahrain, but they were formerly attached to a Shi - 'ah mosque, of which the ruins are still visible at the spot. Nabi Salih is subject to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain S brother, Khalid-bin-'Ali, who ordinarily resides at Eifa', ash, Sharqi. SALIH Officially known as Shatrat-al-'Amarab ; a small town (QAL ; AT) i n Turkish ; Iraq on the left bank of the Tigris^ 27i miles above 'Azair and miles below 'Amarah Town by river ; it has grown up out of a small village during the last twelve years in consequence of the general pacification of the country and the development of the rice trade, of which it is a centre. The town, divided into two portions by a eanal, consists half of briek houses and half of huts; and the population is 3,000 or some what more. The people, said to be of Central Arabian origin, are nearly all Muhammadans, Sunnis greatly predominating; ^ but there are some 400 Shi'ahs, about 60 Jews, and some Sabians. The Sabians are goldsmiths and make Mashhuf canoes. The surrounding tribe are the A1 Bu Muhammad; the original fort, to which the place owes its name, belonged to Faisal, one of their chiefs. There are some dates and the chief local products are rice, maize, millet, sesame, cucumbers, onions and radishes. The bazaai ' s w Stocked with cotton cloth, sugar, cofiee and tea, mostly from Basra4f SALMAH (JABAL) 1667 QaFat Salih is the headquarters of the Qadha of Shatrat-al- ■'Amarah. in the Sanjaq of ; Amarah; it has one Sabian and three Muhammadan schools and a customs house ; and it is connected by a single line of telegraph with Qurnah Village on the one side and AmarahTown on the other. The Dairat-as-Saniyah have an office here. A range of granite hills in Jabal Shammar, resembling Jabal Aja but SALMAH inferior in size and importance. Jabal Salmah runs parallel to Jabal Aja (JABAL) at a distance of 30 miles to the south-east; it is lower than Jabal Aja &lt;u.Lsw and only about half the lengthy reaching to a corresponding distance on the north-east but falling short on the south-west. Hail stands on the plain ; called Batn, which is enclosed between the two ranges. Jabal Salmah is divided into two nearly equal lengths by a pass called Ei'-ash-Shara' over which the road from Sab'an to Tabah runs at an elevation of 3,990 feet above the sea, or nearly 500 above the Batn plain. Both sections of the range contain craters or amphitheatres^ accessible only by narrow gorges and exhibiting in their interiors basalt, granite, red basaltic schist and gravel conglomerate. The principal crater in the northern part of the range is entered by a m gorge at the north-eastern corner which is called Ei 7 Fuqqah ^ ^ anc l is the most difficult of the many passes in Jabal Salmah, being obstructed at its narrowest part by a step feet high over which only strong unloaded camels can pass ; it can also be reached however by a pass from Tabah. The approach to the chief amphitheatre in the south end is by Wadis Madhaiyih Horah Matrafiyah , Dahshamiyah and Mahdaj 5 and finally through a gorge called .Rr , Mahdaj which loaded camels can pass in single file. Each of the principal amphitheatres contains many petty valleys, of which 49 belonging to the northern and 22 belonging to the southern have special names. Jabal Salmah also possesses a number of external valleys, the chief of these in the northern section being Na^ai (^Ui ; Rak Jub Amlah Shinayin , Hamrah , Halqum Hafiyah Umm Haruj pj*. Tiryan and 'Adwah ^; all drain towards Faid except Tiryan, which has no outlet, and ^Adwah which goes towards the north-east. The exterior valleys of the southern section are those already mentioned as affording access to the southern amphitheatre, they form a series of which one leads into the next and all five ai'e1658 SALMAH (JABA'li) absolutely barren. The valleys of the north on the contrary mostly contain date palms belonging to Shammar of the Aslam section ; these palms flourish on the natural water of the subsoil and receive no attention except when they are fertilised and again in the date harvest, when the owners camp beside them. Some of the Ri^s can be passed by horses only after they have been unshod. Jabah Salmah is crossed by the route from Hail to Faid, not however md the Rf-ash-Shara/ but by a pass near the northern extremity of the range which is narrow, difficult, for camels even dangerous, and was in former times a noted lurking place of brigands. iiWl SALU' A tract in the Kuwait Principality between the district of 'Adan on the north and that of Hazaim on the south. Its extent is uncertain but may be considerable, possibly 3.0 miles from north to south and 20 miles from the sea inlands. Other accounts make it only a small locality towards the north end of the region between ^Adan and Hazaim. The name is derived from a peculiar geological formation consisting of more or less horizontal strata of rock interspersed with layers, about three feet thick*, of sand and earth : the Arabs are accustomed to obtain water by excavating the soft parts. There are no very celebrated wells in Salu', and water, where found, is generally fit only for animals. The surface of the Salu' tract is described as extremely sterile, consisting of a somewhat loose and dark-coloured sand, and bearing little or no vegetation except the Silaij plant. On the coast the following maritime features between ^Adan on the north and Hazaim on the south may be regarded as connected with the Salu' tract:—the southern end of Dohat-az-Zarq, Ras-az-Zor, Ardh-al- c Khor, JabaL Banayah and Ras Bard-halq. These are all described in the article on the Kuwait Principality. SALUBA Singular Salubi A race or tribe dispersed in small nomadic UU groups all over Najd, in Kuwait territory, and to some extent in Turkish or Iraq; their range is said to be from Syria in the north to Yaman i 11 the south. In particular they, are known to frequent HaiyamjahSALUBA 1659 in the Nafud and Bir Taiyim on the direct route from Hail to Najaf * Numbers aucl divisions . No estimate exists of their numbers^ and nothing is known of their divisions; the different sections, however, appear to have fixed limits within which they wander; and there is said to be one section, called Ghanaimi which declines to intermarry with the others. A'ppeQjTciTicd ciud chccTdctGf .—The Saluba are a peculiar and interesting people, but the problems of their origin and history are as yet unsolved, and may be insoluble. The cast of their features is almost European^ their complexion is fair, their eyes are often light-coloured j and in character they are tolerant and humane, less suspicious and reserved than the Arabs, more peacefully inclined and more intelligent. Mode of life, —The Saluba, though they own some cattle and flocks of sheep and goats, are extremely restless, and can hardly be described as a pastoral race. They are to a great extent hunters who live by the chase, but they eke out their subsistence by mechanical industries and veterinary surgery . They are reported to be excellent marksmen and unrivalled in the art of finding and stalking the gazelle and even the ostrich; in landcraf fc generally they are as superior to the Bedouins as the Bedouins are to the Hadhar or settled Arabs; and in the desert the Saluba are the safest of guides and the surest of water-finders. They own an exceptionally fine breed of donkeys, with which they go hunting and perform desert journeys that are difficult even to Bedouins mounted on dromedaries. They mend firearms, they tin pots and kettles, and they manufacture hatchets, sickles and flint-steels for the Bedouins and the inhabitants of the oases ; but their work in this line is ruder than that of the Sunn a'. Workers in wood also, they make well-pulleys, milk-vessels and camel- saddles of desert acacia. They are besides the farriers and cattle surgeons of the Bedouins, to whom they also act as guides and for whom they perform many menial services. Their occupations vary with the season, and the summer, when the Bedouins have no milk to give them, is generally devoted by the Saluba of Najd to hunting in the desert: those of the Kuwait side encamp near the coast for four months in the hot season. The Saluba subsist chiefly on dates^ on the milk and ghi afforded by their flocks and herds, and on the flesh of the animals they kill in the chase; dried locusts are also a part of their diet; and the Arabs accuse them of feeding on carrion, such as sheep and camels that have died a * See Route III {adJin.) in the article on Najd.1660 SALUBA natural death. In personal habits they are far from clean. Their drees often consists of a smock-frock made of gazelle skins. Religion. —In religion they now conform, at least outwardly, to the Muhammadanism by which they are surrounded; but it is certain that they also possess, or possessed till 40 years ago, a religion of their own. When following their ancestral opinions they profess, it is said, belief in one God and respect for Muhammad as a man; revere some nameless celestial beings whom they style the ' confidential friends of God pray three times a day, at sunrise, noon and sunset; fast three times a year, to wit for 30 days in Ramadhan, for 4 to 7 days in S ha ''ban and for 5 to 9 days in one of the summer months; adore the Pole Star, which they call Jah by facing it and spreading out their arms so as to form a cross; respect a star named Jadi in the constellation Aries; and consider a part of Mesopotamia to be holy ground. They sometimes declare that they were originally Sabians, and the position of the North Star in their system of belief gives colour to the assertion. But it is difficult to predicate anything of a religion which is now concealed and is moreover in course of being superseded by another. Customs. —Some of the customs of the Saluba appear to be peculiar to themselves. It is said that a child 40 days after its birth is seven times immersed in water, and that all male children are circumcised before they are seven years old ; at the circumcision sheep are killed and all comers are made welcome to the feast. The marriage ceremony is simple and is per formed in the presence of the fathers or next-of-kin of the bride and bride groom ; the voluntary consent of the principals is necessary and a present is given to the bride^s father ; after this has been done, a greybeard asks the parties whether they agree to the union, receives a fee, pronounces them married, and sends them off to cohabit. Corpses are washed, wrapped in a white shroud, or when cloth is not procurable in a new deerskin mantle, and then interred with a prayer. The characteristic feature of Salubi festivals, especially their circumcisions and weddings, is the erec tion of a cross,* draped with red cloth and topped with feathers, at the door of the tent where the ceremony takes place; the planting of the cross serves as a general invitation to the neighbours to assemble and dance round it. In the Salubi dance the men lightly kiss their female partners on the shoulder, but do not otherwise touch them. * Some of the authorities accordingly derive the term Saluba from Salib the word for a cross. Their cross-like attitude in addressing the North Star will alio be recollected.SAMAD TOWN 1661 Political position. The political position of the Saluba is peculiar, somewhat resembling that of the Zatiit. It is one of semi-subordination to the Arabs as a race. The Saluba wander among the Arab tribes and are friends with all, but remain entirely distinct and take no part in Arab feuds. The Arabs do not intermarry with them, and in joint camps the two communities pitch their tents apart. The Saluba have a patron in every considerable Arab tribe who protects them from wrong, and they pay a small tribute wherever they go. They themselves never plunder, and the Arabs generally disdain to injure them. Socially they are contemned by the Arabs, and an Arab will not drink out of the same vessel as a Salubi. To the west of Hail in Najd they are called Khaluwah or ' Solitaries '; sometimes, in disdain, Kilab-al-Khala or 'Doo-s * to of the Desert.' The term Salubi is sometimes used opprobriously in addressing members of other inferior tribes such as theHataim, Shararat and Sunna' j yet a sickly Bedouin Arab child is occasionally named ' Salubi' or ' Khaluwi ' in the hope of propitiating the fates to spare him.* A considerable bay forming the southern extremity or foot of what may be called the Gulf of Bahrain^ the sea, namely, which divides the shores of Qatar from those of Hasa. On the eastern shore of the bay is a small group of date groves belonging to Bedouins who profess allegiance to the A1 Thani Shaikh of Qatar, also a few wells of indifferent water. One of the plantations, now abandoned, has a small spring of water which runs down to the sea and is resorted to by Bani Hajir. The route between Hofuf and Dohah passes close to the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa. SALWA (DOHAT- AS-) iM An important oasis and township of about 2,500 inhabitants; it is situated on the left bank of Wadi Samad in the Baldan-al-Habus division of the Sharqiyah District of the 'Oman Sultanate. The inhabitants are Habus (180 houses), Jahadhim (100 houses), Zikawinah (60 houses), Al Bu Sa^ld (50 houses), Shuruj (50 houses), Hirth (40 houses), and Warud (40 houses).

The population of Wadi Samad is about 5^500 souls. This valley forms part of the boundary between Sharqiyah and Eastern Hajar. i Also called Kut Samail ( JjU - w Oj ./ , An important place situated SAMAIL on the right bank of Wadi Samail in the ; 0man Sultanate and dividing (HlSN) the ; Alayah or npper valley, tenanted by Hinawi tribes, from the Sifalah JJU** or lower valley, which is occupied by-tribes of the opposite faction. The main feature is a fort, in the possession of the Sultan of 'Oman, commanding the great highway between coast and interior that lies. up the valley. It stands on an isolated rocky eminence, scarped all round at the base and presenting a high precipitous cliff on the side towards the valley. On the east or lower side is a massive barbican containing 2 unfailing wells cut through the solid rock. The keep is a circular stone tower built on the highest point of the rock and contains a capacious water reservoir. The curtain walls connecting the keep and barbican enclose a considerable area of irregular shape. Immediately under the fort on the west side stands a collection of 30 or 40 houses and 60 shops which is called Suq Samail A Wali ordinarily resides at Hisn Samail on the part of the Sultan of 'Oman, and his authority is supported by a detachment of 25 ^Askaris, under an ; Aqid. About $2,400 is annually collected as revenue, and of this a balance of $1,000 reaches the Masqat treasury. Saiyid Faisal, present Sultan of ^Oman, owns some land and date plantations here as his private property; these have an annual value of $2,000 and are at present assigned as a grant-in- aid to the Wali. ■ p I | The largest, the most populous, and politically the most important SAMAIL valley in the Sultanate of 'Oman. It cuts the range or mountainous (WADI) district of Haj ar across, dividing it into an eastern and a western massjuMt^w and is thus a leading feature in the physical geography of 'Oman. Rising at Najd-al Mughbariyah, called also Qarn-ad-Daru' uj*, oyer which a pass leads into 'Oman Proper, the Wadi runs in j*1664, SAMAIL (WADI) north-north-easterly direction and reaches the coast by several mouths in the neighbourhood of Sib after a course of about 50 miles. In different parts of its course it bears different names, and in strict parlance only a portion is called Samail: within the hills it is first W adi Bani Euwahah, then W adi Samail; after emerging from the higher hills it becomes successively W adi Bidbid, W adi Fanjah and W adi Khodh.

The settled population of Wadi Samail appears to be about 27,500, or. including Wadi Dhaba'un, 28,000 souls. In its course through Hajar, that is, in its Bani Ruwahah and Samail sections, the W^adi is enclosed between lofty ranges of irregular outline which rise to heights of 5,000 and 7,000 feet: the eastern wall of mountains has fewer high peaks, but presents more broken contours than the western. W^ide in some places and narrow in others, Wadi Samail is extremely contracted near Grhubrah ; its aspect also varies, desolate stretches of sand and pebbles alternating with well-cultivated and thickly- populated tracts. As far as the middle of W^adi Samail Piopei, the slope is somewhat rapid, though free from sudden falls; lower down it is more gradual, and the soil, which is dark in the Wadi Euwahah, becomes lighter coloured and more sandy as the valley descends. The famous Samail date groves are watered by open conduits, not by the subterra nean Palajs common elsewhere, and the palms are estimated at 600,0001672 SAMAlL (WADI) of all sorts. Samail is the home of the Fard date, and cotton is extensively grown. Below Samr the hills recede, especially on the west • and the stream, perennial above this point, vanishes under ground to reappear again nearer the coast. At Bidbid the Wadi bed is broad, barren and sandy ; finally it breaks up into branches as it approaches the coast. Wadi Samail was at the beginning of the 1 7th century the seat of a chief who, in coalition with the Bani Hina tribe and the Ya'arabi chief of Rustaq, successfully resisted and eventually overthrew the power of the dynasty of the Nabahinah. In recent times it has generally been submissive to the Sultans of 'Oman, but it is often disturbed by feuds between the Hinawiyah of the upper and the Ghafiriyah of the lower valley, The trade of the Wadi is with Matrah and Sib. SAMAIT A restless tribe of non-Bedouin Arabs, at the present time settled on (AL BU)^ the Persian Coast, chiefly in Lingeh Town. In Ghariyeh, an eastern j) J) suburb of Lingeh, upon the sea face, they are said to own 34&lt;0 houses; and in Lingiyeh, a western quarter of the town, 2. Besides these there are about 4 houses of A1 Bu Samait at Mughu, 10 at Barku, and about 10 at Halat Naband, all places in the Shibkuh district. The total number of the tribe is approximately 1,800 souls. It is estimated that among them they own 3,500 date palms ; but they are chiefly engaged in pearl fishing nd other seafaring occupations, and they possess a number of boats. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. The original habitat of the A1 Bu Samait appears to have been at a place near Khor Shaqiq in Qatar^ but towards the end of the 18th century they removed to Zubarah, where they joined the 'Utub. About 1810 they migrated from Zubarah to Jau in Bahrain, and there they remained for about 20 years ; afterwards, a blood feud having arisen between themselves and the Na'im in Bahrain, they transferred their abode to Dammam in Qatlf. At Dammam they stayed for about 7 years only and then returned for a short period to Bahrain, eventually emigrating about 1840 to Lingeh, where they still remain. In 1899 they incurred the displeasure of the Persian authorities by supporting the cause of the Arab Zabit of Lingeh, who was expelled in that year; and in 1900 they appear to have entertained some idea of emigrating to the British station of Basidu, but did not carry it into effect. Their relations with the Shaikh of Bahrain have never ceased to be friendly, and it is believed that oppression by Persian officials might even now cause them to return to his jurisdiction.* * The hisuorj of the A1 Bti Samait is contained in the Foreign Prooeedings of the Government of India for June 1901.SAM AW AH QA.DHA 1673 A division of th .G Diwaniyali Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in Turkish 'Iraq. Position and boundaries, —The Qadha of Samawah is situated on both sides of the river Euphrates immediately above the point where it leaves the Wilayat of Baghdad and enters that of Basrah. It is boanded on the east by the Nasiriyall Qadha of the Mnntafik Sanjaq, on the south and west by the Shamiyall Desert^ on the north-west by the Qadha of ShaiUiyah, and on the north by that of Diwaniyah. Topography and tribes. —The only considerable town in the Qadha is Samawah, which is the headquarters of the local administration ; the other principal places are Eumaithall, which forms the subject of a separate article^ and Durraji, Abu Juwarir and Khidhar^ all of which are described in the article on the Euphrates; besides Ishan (100 houses); Sadah (30 houses) and Wusaitah (40 houses). The ancient site of Warkah is situated in the Durraji Nahiyah of this Qadha.

Resources. —The date palms of the district are estimated at 75,000 : agriculture and livestock do not differ from those of the other Qadhas of the Sanj aq. In many parts of the Samawah Qadha the soil produces salt; and about 10 miles south of Samawah Town there is a lake, fed by salt streams, which yields by evaporation a large quantity of excellent salt resembling rock-salt. The deposits of the lake are not under the management of the Department of Public Debt, but the dep6ts of the Department at the towns of Samawah, Diwaniyah, Nasiriyah and Suq-ash Shuyukh are stocked from them, as also to some extent the depdts at Hillah and JNfajaf. It is estimated that the lake could produce about 15,000 tons of salt a year. Administration. is a Qadha of the 2nd class : the head quarters o£ the district are at the town similarly named. Besides the Markaz Nahiyah of Samawah there are 2 others,—-Durraji (3rd class) and Abu Juwarir or Rumaithah (1st class) : the Mudir of Abu Juwarir has his head-quarters at Rumaithah and the Mudir of Durraji at Khidhar. Durraji belongs to the Dairat-as-Saniyah.^5 SA.MAWAH TOWN 1677 A large and flourishing municipal town in Turkish 'Iraq, situated SAMAWAH on the Euphrates about 5 miles helow the point where the water drawn off by the Hindiyah near Musaiyib rejoins it. Samawah is about 50 TOWN miles south by east of Diwaniyah Town and 70 miles west-north-west of the town of Nasiriyah. Situation and buildings.^ —The river divides the town into two parts, of which that on the right bank is the larger and better and contains the Government offices ; but there are brick houses in both quarters, and the military barracks, ruinous but occupied, are upon the left bank. There are 6 Khans and 8 mosques. The river is crossed at the town by a boat bridge. Inhabitants, —The population, which may be about 10,000 souls, is almost entirely Arab and Shi'ah, but there are some 500 Persians, 200 Jews, 80 Abyssinian slaves and 60 Turks; Christians, Afghans and Indians there are none. Samawah is much frequented by the Muntafik tribe, especially as a market. resources and transport. —The neighbourhood as far as Rumaithah is well cultivated; but it is also studded with forts, and among the Arabs there is constant tribal warfare. The town possesses some 20,000 date palms, the groves being chiefly on the right bank of the river, but these do not suffice for the local consumption : the case of cereals, vegetables and fruit is however different, for of these the town possesses and exports a considerable surplus. All kinds of transport animals, except camels, are owned by the surrounding tribes; but the number that might be forthcoming if required cannot be calculated. Trade and manufactures. —Importation and exportation take place chiefly by river, and there are complaints of an insufficiency of boats. There is a bazaar of over 250 shops, and commercially the town has a prosperous appearance. The chief exports are wool, wheat, barley and lambskins; while the imports of most value are Manchester piece-goods, coffee, sugar and indigo. Most of the trade, both export and import, is with Basrah Town, but the tribes of Najd also make purchases here, and cotton piece-goods and articles such as glass and chinaware come from Baghdad, while the lambskins exported mostly go to Russia. The only local manufacture is of a kind of woollen carpet, which sometimes fetches as much as 4- Larahs the piece, but is not ordinarily exported.1678 SAM AW AH TOWN Administration. —The ordinary officials of a Qadha are stationed at Samawah, and the police force consists of about 50 Dhabitiyahs. The Department of Public Debt and the Tobacco Regie are each represented by a Mamur^ and there is a harbour master for the river. Samawah is connected with Diwaniyah Town above and Durraji below, both on the Euphrates, by a single line of telegraph. The military garrison consists of one battalion of infantry and two guns ; but, as usual, the greater part of the force is generally absent, engaged in collecting the revenue of the tribes. Samawah, though not shown in the distribution scheme of the Radif, seems to be a centre for about 300 reservists. Politically Sama wah is important as one of the chief points at which the Turks come in contact with the tribes of Najd. SAMHAN A range of mountains which extends along the southern coast of (JABAL) Arabia from Kas Nus to Has Sajar, a distance of 120 miles. At both extremities of the range, and also near Murbat, it impinges upon the coast j but it does not follow the sinuosities of the shore line, and the hills are in places removed to a considerable distance from the coast. Between Ras Nus and Murbat a level plain with a maximum width of about 10 miles divides the hills from the sea ; and, at the deepest part of the curve into which the range falls behind the maritime plain of Dhufar Proper, its crest is 20 miles from the coast. There are no spurs of importance upon the seaward side, and the inland slopes subside through a waterless table land styled Qatan ^5 towards Hadhramaut and Central Arabia. The highest points in the Samhan range are one of 3,600 feet, 6 miles north of Murbat, and Ras Sajar, the western termination of the range, which has an altitude of 3,880 feet; behind Dhufar Proper the range has a constant elevation of about 3,000 feet. Between Ras Nus and Murbat the range, which is here of limestone supported on sandstone, drops almost in one scarp to a plain of igneous rock at its base ; in the neighbourhood of Murbat the scarp is relieved by sloping buttresses reaching J of the way to the top ; inland of Dhufar the fall of the hills towards the coast is gradual, not precipitous. The portion of the range to the east of Murbat is bare and rocky ; that to the west is covered with grass which in winter withers for want of rain, bears patches of trees, and is furrowed by several well-marked valleys.SAMHAN (JABAL) 1679 The easternmost of these valleys is Wadi Murbat, which reaches the sea about one mile north-west of Murbat ; it is inhabited by the Qara tribe and is said to be of considerable length and to contain wells of good water throughout its course. The next to westward and the most re markable is Wadi Dirbat which reaches the sea by Khor Eori : it rises in Jabal Qarhah and at first flows from east to west for about 25 miles j then, turning, it runs 8 miles southwards to the sea. About 4}\ miles from the coast the valley is divided by an isolated hill into two branches, the larger being on the western side, each of which immedi ately drops sheer over a calcareous ledge 250 feet high. The ledges are white and grey, adorned with long white stalactites, and feathery waterfalls are continually adding fresh materials to the chalky secretions composing them. Below the ledges is vegetation of luxuriant growth, including plantains and the castor-oil plant ; above is a small grassy plateau with pomegranate, fig and lime trees, and some cultivation of grain, indigo and onions. About | of a mile above the ledges begins the lower of two narrow lakes which extend up the valley for about miles : they are connected by a running stream and are the resort of various aquatic birds. The greatest breadth of these sheets of water is about 30 yards and the greatest depth about 12 feet; they are overhung in places by trees and bordered here and there with bulrushes. Wadi Dirbat is inhabited by the MVashani section of the Qara tribe. The third Wadi is that of Bizat olj;, about 12 miles west of Dirbat ; its stream waters the settlement of the same name in the plain of Dhufar. The fourth Wadi, Sahannut oy^, comes down to the sea about the middle of Dhufar Proper ; at several different points it feeds water courses ; the water-supply is unfailing and there is good pasture. Wadi Nahiz ^ , the fifth of the series, belongs to the Qatan section of the Qara tribe and reaches the coast in the neighbourhood of Bilad -al- Qadimah. The sixth and westernmost of the series is Wadi Jarzizj^ (pronounced Garziz), which emerges from the hills behind Salalah ] it contains a spring forming a pond at a place about 2 miles above the entrance of the valley. About the pond grow figs, limes, cactus, aloe and mimosa, while jessamine and maiden-hair fern also are found. Here W adi Jarziz, or the lower part of it, ends in a cul-dc-scic surround ed by high rocky cliffs, in which are a number of caves. The valley is said to afford good grazing in June and July; in the rains a considerable stream issues from it j and the remains of a stone aqueduct leading from the spring to the plain of Dhufar may be traced in places upon the face of the cliff. The main route to the interior, for travellers by land to1680 SAMHAN (JABAL) Hadhramaul or 'Oman, lies up Wadi Jurziz. The highlands of the Samhan range behind the plain of Dhufar are grassgrown and studded with groups of trees, which give them a park-like aspect. Behind the hills, on the confines of the Great Desert, is a place, Hasiki inhabited by the Bin Sa^id section of the Qaras, where frankincense of the best quality is obtained. The chief product of Jabal Samhan is frankincense,* by the Qaras called Shihaz, which is obtained in May and December: the gum is collected 7 days after the scratching of the stem, an operation which is repeated 3 or 4 times in the month; the trees are marked and are recog nised as belonging to particular families. The tree yielding caoutchouc, called Tishkat by the Qaras, grows 15 to 20 feet high,- the Akor tree producing Muql J^ 0 or bdellium is found; and the Sulbur tree of Soqotrah, which grows upon limestone without visible soil, is said to attain a height of 8 to 15 feet. Regarding the fauna of the Samhan hills we have no very precise information, but it is said to include a kind of ibex, the civet cat, fox and hare ; also guinea-fowl and partridges. There is also a large black and yellow spider which produces a strong filament of a bright golden colour resembling silk. No minerals are known to be present, but natives report the existence of something resembling coal. The terms Samhan range and Qara country are practically syno nymous ; and the Qaras live by the great herds of camels, cattle^ sheep and goats which they pasture upon the sides of Jabal Samhan. The Bedouin sections of the A1 Kathir tribe also inhabit the Samhan hills. SANAISAL (WADI) An important valley in the Dhahirah district of the 'Oman Sultanate; it is formed by the junction of Wadi-al -Kabir and Wadi Sharsah and runs southwards or south-eastwards to the desert, where it is lost.

Iraq and Kuwait. It is one mile long from north to south, half a mile in breadth and covers a lozenge- skaped space; its height is 430 feet and its summit commands an excellent view of the flat ; featureless country by which it is surrounded. The hill first becomes visible from the south near the southern end of Batih, at a distance of about 30 miles : it can also be seen from three miles beyond Umm Qasr to the east-south-east. The Batin passes about 15 miles west of Jabal Sanam, O P SANAM (JABAL)1682 san A u j AANAU A town of nearly 3,500 inhabitants in the Baldan-al-Habus division o£ the Sharqiyah district of the .'Oman Sultanate, probably about 4 miles to the east of Mudkaibi ; with reference to Samad its position is uncertain. The houses are of mud and some have upper storeys. The town stands upon an eminence with date groves below. The inhabitants are Bani Rashid (300 houses), Suwawifah (200 houses), Mahariq (100 houses) and Yal Bin Rashid (60 houses). There are also a few Bani Na'aman.

SHA'AM A village on the west coast of Trucial 'Oman, 1 7 miles north-north east of Ras-al -Khaimah Town. It is the northernmost village in the Ras- al -Khaimah district of Sharjah; 2 miles north of it is Ras-ash-Sha'am which marks the boundary between that principality and the Ruus-al- Jibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate. Sha^am stands on a sandy shore with a plain 1 to 1^ miles broad between it and the mountains of the 'Oman Promontory. Five miles south of Sha'am, half-way to Rams, is a creek called Khor Khuwair ^ which can be used by boats at high water and near which is a village of the same name, described in the article on the Ras-al -Khaimah District, Sha^am consists of about 300 houses, mostly of mud; it is protected by a small tower on a hillock 5 0 feet high about 1 mile south of the town. The people are all Shihuh of the Rani Shatair section; they live by pearl diving and fishing, and by date and other cultivation. They have only 3 pearl boats and no large vessels, but they own 6 or 7 coasters in which they bring firewood and dried fish to Sharjah Town for sale, also 8 fishing boats, Sambuks. About 30 camels, 50 donkeys, 20 cattle and some sheep and goats belong to the place, and there are about 7,000 date-palms. , ^ 'i wnved SB ABADI) ^ valley in the Eastern Ha jar district of the 'Oman Sultanate, reacn- a) ^ ie sea a point 26 miles north-west of Stir and 37 south-east of , ^ ^ ^ Qiryat; it is the north-we.stern most of the 3 valleys called Wadi Bani ^ ^SHABANKAREH 1685 Jabir (I). From the coast it appears as a deep chasm in the hills from which issues a fine stream of fresh water; the course of this stream between its exit from the hills and the coast is short, and it forms a lagoon within 50 yards of the beach» The principal village of 'Wadi Shab is one at the coast called Hillat-ash-Shab ^}\ or Ghail-ash-Shab : it stands on the eastern side of the mouth of the stream^ is built upon a slight eminence and consists of about 50 stone and mud houses. The in habitants are Bani Jabir of the Bani Muqim section; they grow quinces, bananas^ pomegranates and betel-nut. A mile or two inland of Hillat is Qata^ah within the hills; it has a large date-plantation and is merely a summer resort for date-owners ; and above Qata^ah are various other plantations possessing distinctive names. The only fixed villages are Jahl a place of 30 houses, and Jailah, both villages of the Bani Muqim; they are said to be distant respectively 4 and 6 hours'' journey on foot from the sea. The settled population of Wadi Shab (inclusive of Ghail-ash-Shab) may be about 500 souls. An inland district of the Fars province, separated from the sea by the Gulf Ports district of Hayat Davud, and meeting on the south the Gulf Ports districts of Dashtistan, Angali and Eud-hilleh. Shabankareh is said to have been originally a part of Dashtistan and to have been separated from it for administrative reasons. Limits. —Shabankareh is bounded on the west by the Rud Shur» which divides it from Hayat Davud \ on the north and east by the outer range of the Persian hills, in this neighbourhood called Taviseh ; and on the south by the Rud-hilleh. Eiver. Its length from north-west to south east is thus about 20 and its breadth about 12 miles* Physical characteristics, —Except for the seaward slopes of the Taviseh Mis, which are included in the district, Shabankareh appears to consist entirely of flat open country. It is crossed by various watercourses from the hills, but there is none of importance between the Eud Shmn or Shapur River on the east and the Rud Shur on the west. Water is generally derived from wells, but the villages on the Rud-hilleh River * The name Shabarkareh appears to have been t^ken from a Dailami family or tribe. By the medisaval geographers of the country it was applied not to the district now in question, but to one further eastward in Fars, having its capital at D^rabjird. See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate. SHABAN^ KAREH* J1686 SHABANKARE H derive iheir supply from that stream. In summer, hot winds blow for 8 months from June to August^ but the temperature falls considerably at night. Inhabitants. —The populatiQp mostly belong to Persian-speaking tribes who have been settled here from time immemorial, but there are a few villages of immigrants from neighbouring Persian districts and of Arab settlers. Most of the people belong to small or obscure tribes : the inhabitants of Dih Kuhneh, the principal place, are described as tJaijab and Khajahvan the latter from Behbehan. With few exceptions the people are ShI'ahs. They are neither fanatical nor turbulent^ but they are well armed and Martini rifles arj almost as numerous as households. The dwellings in most places are huts, but about ^ are houses of sun-dried bricks and mud. A list of the villages, most of which have one or two small towers for defence, is given below, with particulars of each village, under the head of topography : the total population amounts to about 10,000 souls. Agriculture. and barley are the staples of cultivation, but there are date plantations in some of the villages, and in particular places tobacco and water melons are grown. Cotton has recently been intro duced on a small scale. Livestock includes a fair number of cattle, sheep and goats. Trade. —'There is a small export of wheat, barley, tobacco, straw and wool; and piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee, sugar and spices are imported to a limited extent. Business is chiefly with the town of Bushehr, the more northern villages dealing with that place through the nort of Uig and the more southern through Shif. The standard o length is a Gaz of 384 inches ; the unit of weight is a Man of 9 lbs. 11 oz. ; and there is also a Hashim Man of 16 ordinary Mans or 155 lbs. English. Persian Qrans make up the bulk of the currency. Cgmmunications and transjoort.—D\h Kuhneh, the principal place in Shabankareh, lies upon the route from Burazjan to Dllam and Zaidan, and from Dih Kuhneh there is a track to the sea at Rig.* Shif on the coast opposite Bushehr Town is easily accessible across country from the southern villages of Shabankareh, the distance being about 15 miles. The transport resources of the district are roughly estimated at 200 horses, 100 mules and 8,000 donkeys. In most villages where there are horses mules are found, to about half the number of the horses. There are also some camels. # See Routes in Persia, I, Nos. 19 A. and 21 A.SHABAN KAREH 1687 Administration. —Shabankareh is ruled by a hereditary Khan who is subject to the Governor-General of Fars; the present incumbent is Isma/il Khan. The Khan at present pays 5;500 Tumans a year for the farm of the district j he manages it through the Kadkhudas or headmen of villages. There are no arrangements for the administration of justice, and private retaliation of injuries is the rule, though to a certain extent disputes are adjusted by the Khan, by village-headmen and by local Qazis and Mullas. Land revenue is collected at the rate of 60 Qrans pei Gau of cultivation. There is also a cash tax on dates, equal to ^ of the value of the produce, and an annual poll tax of one Qran per man is collected* There is no official directly representing the Persian Govern ment in the district.

SHAH ABUL SHAH »14J| ^jl j U So styled by Persians, but by Arabs called Shaikh 'Abdullah aJl^vc juU. It is the easternmost village on the coast of the Hindiyan f District of Southern 'Arabistan; 8 miles to the south-south-east of it is Dilam. shah Abul Shah is situated on a ridge of sand which has evidently at some former time been an island and is still surrounded by mud flats. High tides reach the present village on its western side. There is a small coasting-trade. The inhabitants are sometimes at feud with the people of Dilam. A white-domed tomb gives its name to the place: the Mullas iu charge of it are hospitable and have even lodged a European traveller in the gateway. On the sand dunes to the north-west of the village of Shah Abul Shah are the remains apparently of some considerable place, with much broken pottery and other debris. According to local tradition 'Abdullah, Ibrahim and Bibi Hakimeh, two brothers and a sister of Imam Eiza, having fled from Baghdad took refuge and died in this part of the country, and Shah Abul Shah is the burying place of 'Abdullah. The shrines of the othei two are in the hills, and that of Bibi Hakimeh is the most respected of the three. ■infcSHAM (KHOR-ASH-) 1693 Singular is Shakaili .

SHAKAIL (BANI) JO fflcfr Also called Elphinstone Inlet. This is an extensive and winding arm of the sea by which the RllUS-al-Jibal promontory is indented on its western face about 14 miles from its northernmost extremity; it runs inland for about 10 miles, first for 3 miles to v^e south-south-east and then for 7 in an east-north-easterly direction ; and its width varies from half a mile to 1J miles. On the south side, throughout the greater part of its inner reach, it is divided from Ghubbat Ghazirah on the other side of the peninsula only by the slender isthmus of Maqlab, while the barrier separating its foot from Dohat Shisah is also very narrow. On its northern side stand the villages of Sham and Midah ; on the southern side are Fanakhah, Nadhifi and Hum si near the entrance; further in is Qanah ; at the foot of the inlet is Sibi: these with their positions are described in the article on the Ruus-al-Jibal district. The principal islands of the inlet are Sham and Sibi, opposite the places similarly named, and Telegraph Islet, 50 feet high, on which once stood a British telegraph station, 600 yards south by west of the island of Sham. The foundations of the telegraph buildings are still visible. Immediately south of Telegraph Islet is Maqlab bay, which gives its name to the better known isthmus and also to the islet itself, by the Arabs called Jazirat-al-Maqlab. Two peaks, each 3,000 feet high, overlook Elphin- stone Inlet: they are Jabal-ash-Sham on the eastern side of the entrance, * Some remarks on this inlet by Admiral Atkinson-WilleB; K.N., will be found ^ the Government of India's Proceedings for June 1904. SHAM* (KHOR- ASH-)1694 SHAM (KHOR-ASH-) whieli has a great precipice on its south-east side, and Jabal Sibi at the bottom o£ the inlet between it and Ghubbat Shabtis.

SHAMAILL YAH* ui A littoral tract situated on the eastern side of the 'Oman Promontory, but forming part of the Sharjah Principality. JloMndanes.— TJpon the coast Shamailiyah extends from Khor Kalba on the south to Gharfah (not Gharaifah) on the north, and includes both of these villages ; Dibah, immediately north of Gharfah, is the only place belonging to Sharjah on this side of the 'Oman Promontory which is outside the limits of Shamailiyah, Inland Shamailiyah reaches for some distance into the hills, and north of the W adi Ham it is in contact there with the Ras-al-Khaimah district of the Sharjah Shaikhdom: the lower part of Wadi Ham belongs to Shamailiyah and the upper to Ras-al-Khaimah. South of Wadi Ham the inland frontier of Shamailiyah is altogether indefinite.f Physical features. —The coast for the most part resembles that of Ruus-al-jibal further to the north; but opposite the villages of Ghallah, Gharaifah, Fujairah and Saqamqam the desolate coast hills retire inland, forming a curve between which and its chord—the latter represented by some 11 miles of coast—these villages are enclosed. From Saqamqam to Khor Fakkan, a distance of 12 miles, a mass of low hills comes down to the sea; but the coast is broken by numerous small indentations, in which stand little hamlets and date plantations. The principal feature of the interior o£ the district is Wadi Ham, elsewhere separately described.

Bidyah is apparently the largest, though it is not the most important, place. The inhabitants are settled ; they are date growers, farmers and fishermen, but only upon a small scale. Administration and political position. —The Shamailiyah tract is a part of the Sharjah Principality ; for some time past, however, the district has not been directly managed by the Shaikh of Sharjah, but has been held of him as a fief by one of his relations. In 1902 the fief-holder was Hamad-bin-Majid, a first cousin of the Shaikh ; this feudatory had his residence at Ghallah and was in a position to collect about $ 2,000 a year by way of revenue for himself. The position in Shamailiyah subsequently became complicated through the action of Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, Sharqi, headman of Fujairah, who had for some years been striving to render Fujairah and certain other villages in Shamailiyah, occupied by his adherents, independent of Sharjah juris diction ; the rebel now holds adverse possession not only of Fujairah but also of Bithnah, Gharaifah, Marbah, Qaraiyah, Qidfa^, Saqamqam and Sufad. Sa^id-bin-Hamad, the successor of the Qasimi fief-holder of ]902 ? now resides at 'Ajman ; and the connection of the Sharjah0 SHAMIL DISTRICT 1699 family with Shamailiyah appears to be, at the present moment, little more than nominal. As the ownership by the Shaikh o£ Sharjah of the whole of Shamailiyah was explicitly recognised by the British Government so recently as 1903 and as the actnal state of affairs has now ceased .to correspond with the view then taken, the present position in Shamailiyah is somewhat difficult to define. SHAMIL A district of the Persian Coast bordering the north-west side of the loop formed by the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman at their junction; it Jx encloses the port of Bandar 'Abbas, which however is not administra- or_ tively included in the district. SHAMIL AT Limits. —The bulk of Shamil lies eastward of Bandar 'Abbas in the form of a somewhat elongated parallelogram with its south-west corner at that town : the boundaries of this portion are, on the north, a line running from Kuh-i-Namak to Kuh-i-Niyan in such a manner as to include Khurgu village and thence crossing the valley of the Shamil river to the Zindan hills; on the east, the Zindan hills from the Shamil river almost to the breach formed by the exit of the Minab river; and, on the south, an imaginary line running from the point last mentioned to the coast at the mouth of the Shamil river, and beyond the Shamil estuary, the sea-coast as far as Bandar ' Abb as. To the west of Bandar 'Abbas the district is irregularly bevelled off to the coast at the mouth of the Kul river j the northern boundary is first carried south from Kuh-i-Namak to the eastern shoulder of Kuh-i-Grinau, the crest of which it follows westwards to the Kul river; from the point where the boundary strikes the river to the sea the Kul itself is approximately the boundary, but a few villages, of which the most important are the two Kishars, though lying to the west of the river are included in the Shamil district. Physical characteristics, —The district is in fact a maritime plain enclosed between the sea and some bold mountain ranges of which the elevation generally exceeds 3,000 feet. The dominant feature of the whole country is Kuh-i-Ginau of which the summit reaches 7,783 feet at a point 18 miles north-north-west of Bandar 'Abbas. The mountains to the north of the district rise very steeply from the plain and attain 4,481 feet in Kuh-i-Namak ^ at their western end and 6 a 057 feet in 5^2 DISTRICT1700 SHAMIL DISTRICT Kuli-i-Niyan at their eastern extremity ;* between these points they are interrupted by 4 gaps through which valleys of some size descend to the plain giving the range a disconnected appearance. The Kuh-i- Zindan V range (also called the Rudbar hills) on the east of the district appears to have a nearly constant elevation of over 3,000 feet. A great mountain situated beyond the district but visible from the Persian Gulf is Kuh-i-Bakhun , which is 42 miles north of Bandar 'Abbas, 10,660 feet hi^h, and covered with snow in winter. Besides these considerable mountains the district possesses a generally low and in places ill-defined sandstone ridge, which subtends the sea-coast at a distance of from 3 to 10 miles and divides the country into two portions that differ widely in their characteristics; the ordinary height of this ridge is perhaps 200 feet, but at a point 13 miles west by north of Bandar 'Abbas and 6 miles from the sea it reaches a height of 1,645 feet. On the east this ridge dies away a little beyond Baghu, Between this ridge and the mountains the land js a fertile plain; between it and the coast it is a sandy expanse, impregnated with salt and diversified, at intervals only, by date groves and small patches of cultivation. From the sandstone ridge numerous steep sided and extremely tortuous ravines, containing no water except during heavy rain, run down to the coast. The seashore is sandy in its whole extent. The only valleys of importance are the Tang-i-Zaj ^Ij , which enters the district between Kuh-i-Ginau and Kuh-i-Namak, and that of the Shamll river, known as Dareh-i-Salugalam ^^ , which emerges between Kuh-i-Niyan and Kuh-i-Zindan. The former contains a salt stream, called the Rud Shur jj* , of which the channel, turning to the south and leaving the villages of Nung and Baghu on its right bank, reaches the sea at a point 8 miles east of Bandar 'Abbas. The bed of the Shamil divides on reaching the district, sending one branch straight to the village of Shamil and thence south-south-east to the sea, while another branch strikes south-westwards until it receives, near Budik village, an affluent from the hills known as the Jamush ; when it turns to the south- south-west and rejoins the eastern branch at 8 miles from the sea ; in the neighbourhood of the coast the united stream bears the name of Rud Shirin *)) . Both the Rud Shur and the Shamil river vary greatly in volume, being sometimes wide rippling streams a few inches in depth *A distant view from the sea of Kuh-i-Niyan (called Jabal Shimil) will be found in Chart No. 2373—2837A, Persian Gulf.SHAMlL DISTRICT I70t atid after rain impassable torrents; the western branch of the Shamil river is frequently dry. The Rud-i-Kul or Kul river which bounds the district on the west is very salt, and its riparian villages depend on wells for their drinking water; near Gurband it receives from the north a stream called the Rud Shur. In the neighbourhood of its mouth the Kul is about 70 yards wide, with a bed of soft mud and banks of sand 3 or 4 feet in height; it is said never to contain less than 1J feet of water, and after rain it is liable to become a raging flood. The Kul river carries part of the drainage of the southern slopes of Kuh^i-Grinau; the remainder of the southern drainage of that mountain is borne by a channel which runs eastwards to Chah Chakur, then breaks through the sandstone coast range and, turning southwards, reaches the sea a very little to the west of the stream from Baghu. The Shamil district contans some clear flowing streams and a number of springs, especially in proximity to the bills; the water of most of these is absorbed in irrigation or sinks into the porous soil before reactiing' any channel by which it could be brought to the coast. Mimosa and oleander are among the commonest plants, and in places the country is covered with thorny jungle. The climate of Shamil resembles that of Bandar 'Abbas, but inland the summer heat is even more intense, owing to the distance from the sea and the reflection of the sun's rays from the bare sandy soil. Population, —The inhabitants of the Shamil district are of Persian race, but there is probably a considerable infusion of Baluchi and Arab blood. The universal language is Persian of a purity which increases with the distance from Bandar ; Abbas ; Arabic is scarcely understood, and Baluchi is not heard except at the eastern end of the district. On the west side of the mouth of the Shamil river, however, is a cluster of villages near the coast, of which the inhabitants are all Baluchis speaking both Persian and a debased form of Baluchi, There are no distinct or well-known local tribes. The people are mostly Shi'ahs except the inhabitants of about a do^en villages, to the west of Bandar ^Abbas, which are either altogether ot predominantly Sunni. As subjects the inhabitants of Shamil are weak, peaceable and oppressed : as cultivators they are idle and unthrifty. The majority live in a squalid fashion in date leaf huts, and as long as they can obtain enough dates to eat they are content to do nothing. In the interior they are cultivators, on the seaboard fishermen and boatmen; ir the season every man, woman and child becomes a date picker. There are1702 SHAMIL DISTRICT? practically no arms among them; only a headman here and there owns a rifle or two. The total population, excluding Bandar ; Ab'bas, which is not reckoned to Shamil; probably amounts to about 25,000 souls. Villages are somewhat numerous, but they are small, and those that possess so many as 100 houses are less than a score. Agriculture and Dates and barley are the staples of cultiva tion, but in some places wheat and tobacco are grown, and a few villages possess a considerable acreage of henna. In a number of the villages the lauds are watered by means of channels cut from the Shamil river and other streams; in a few irrigation is from wells, the water being raised by means of a balanced pole called Duro ^ , similar to that used in Egypt; elsewhere the crops are grown by rainfall. The grain harvest is in April and May, the date harvest in August and September. Potatoes, turnips, radishes, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, and water melons grow. The grain raised is only sufficient for home consumption; but there is a small surplus of dates which is exported. Imports are trifling on account of the poverty of the people and comprise little except tea and cotton goods. The commercial capital of Shamil is Bandar 'Abbas, and the currency, weights and measures of the district are (with some trifling differences^ the same as those o£ the town, except that the Indian rupee is seldom met with in the district. The area of land is generally estimated by Mans, that is, by the number of Mans of seed grain required to sow it. Communications and transport. —The land routes which radiate from Bandar ; Abbas all lie in their first stages within the Shamil district. 1. The coast route from Bandar ^Abbas to Minab (54' miles) runs within the Shamil district as far as the Shamil river; and the first halting place, Qulughan (at 24 miles), is in Shamil. Several muddy and swampy streams have to be crossed which might at any time present dithculties to wheeled carriage, and in wet weather this route would be impracticable.* The remaining stages are mentioned in the article on Mlliab District. S. The Kah-i-Miyan »); or middle route from Bandar 'AbbaS to Minab runs by Dih Nau (at 20 miles) and Jallabi (at 30 miles) to Gavarband (at 50 miles) which is on a direct route from Shamil Village to Minab and distant 18 miles from Ml^ab. This route is said to be a good one &gt; and passable except in very wet weather. This is the * See Boutes in Persia, I, No. 15.SHAMlL DISTRICT 1703 route by which caravans for Bam ; Kirmari; Sistan and Kharasan ordinarily leave the district in winter. 3. The best known and most frequented route in the district is one still further to the north which runs from Bandar 'Abbas by JBaghu (15 miles) and Kalkazi (32 miles) to Kushku (50 miles); beyond Kushku it,enters the hills by the Tang-i-Zindan or gorge of the Shamil river. This route is free from obstacles; at least in ordinary weather j but some streams are crossed here and there, the plains traversed are hard and stony going, and there is some swampy ground just before Kushku. In summer caravans for Kirman generally leave the district by this route, and it is frequently used by hot weather caravans for Yazd. It is also a section of the Persian postal road between Bandar 'Abbas and Kirman. 4. The preceding routes are linked together by various cross-roads^ which are -considerably used. The , principal of these is a route from Minab Town by Gavarband already mentioned under Route No. 2 (at 15 miles), and Shamil Village (at 30 miles) to Kushku (at 40 miles); this route is good from Minab Town to Shamil Village/ but between Shamil Village and Kushku it is bad and liable to be swept by floods.t There is also a route, said to be fairly good, which runs due north from Shamil Village and joins Route No. 3 near the Tang-i-Zindan. 5. The route to Furg and Shiraz, also to Sa'idabad and Yazd, goes north by Chah Chakur (at 9 miles) and Ginau village (at 22 miles), leaving the district by the Tang-i-Zaj. Within Shamil it lies over rough stony or rocky ground, t 6. The route to Lar (137 miles) and by Liar to Shiraz goes by Chistaneh (at 15 miles) and Gachin Bala (at 23 miles) and so leaves the district: the only part at all difficult in dry weather lies apparently in broken country 4) miles beyond Chistaneh.§ Ordinary supplies are obtainable throughout Shamil in small quanti ties, but it is estimated even a single regiment moving rapidly would have difficulty in subsisting upon the country. Not much transport is available. The only animals are camels and donkeys, and according to a rough estimate the district possesses only about 700 camels and 1,000 donkeys, which could ill be spared by the owners* * Described by Preece in his Notes of a Journey made between Shiraz and Jaskk. t See Routes in Persia, I, Nos. 13 and 17, and Preece's Notes, I See Routes in Persia, I, No. 60, and Preece's Notesi § See Routes in Persia, I, No 20,3704 SHAMIL DISTRICT Administration, —The district of Shamil is under the Governor of the Gulf Ports j the local ruler or Kalantar (at present Asad Ullah Khan) has his residence at Ziyarat, is virtually independent of the Deputy- Governor of Bandar ; Abbas ; and holds his position in virtue of a lease of/the revenue in his favour by the Governor. The district is not capable; in its present condition, of paying more than 8,000 Tumans even in a good year as land revenue, but nominally it was leased in 1904 for 11,000 and in 1905 for 13,000 Tumans. The administration is carried on through the headmen or Kadkhudas, each of whom is responsible to the Kalantar for the behaviour and revenue of his village. There is no system of police or of civil or criminal justice. The land revenue, which is payable in cash and represents y 1 ^ of the gross produce as valued by the Kalantar's Kharras vj or assessor, is the only recognised form of taxation; but the Kalantar levies as many irregular extra imposts as he can. Ecclesiastical authority is not strong in Shamil. The principal local families are that of the Kalantar and another at Shamil Tillage of which one Mir Ahmad Shah is the present head.

The inhabitants are Shi'ahs ; they belong to no well-known tribes. Besides date palms, which number not less than 10,000, wheat and barley are very extensively cultivated, the fields being irrigated from the Zaruvi stream, a tributary of the Shamil river. There are 100 cattle, 300 sheep and goats, 100 donkeys and a few camels. Water is abun dant. A Qadamgah of the Amir (i.e., 'AH) and a shrine of Shah Ghaib are situated here.

On the west and south Jau Shamln is bordered by Habl; and on the east, from its south-eastern corner for two-thirds of the distance northwards, by Biyadh, and for the rest of the way by Huzum. The parts of Jau Sham in nearest to the sea are distant from it about 40 miles in the south and 20 miles in the north. The north-eastern corner of the district is at the Mistannah wells, which are regarded as belonging to Huzum but at the same time are the meeting place of Huzum, Jau ShamTn, Radaif and Sabakhat-al -Mutaya. On the north Jau Shamin is divided from Radaif by a line connecting the Mistannah and Hajrah wells. Jau Shamin is a sandy plain. Its vegetation consists chiefly of Thamam grass and of the shrubs known as Hamdh, Rashad, Markh, ''Abal and Arta.

The Qadha of Shamiyah takes its name from this desert, which it adjoins ; and the part of Hillah Town on the west bank of the Euphrates is likewise called Shamiyah because it is on the side of the river towards the desert and not, like the other qnarter, in Mesopotamia, DESERT QADHA A division of the Diwaniyah Sanjaq of the Baghdad Wilayat in SHAMIYAH Turkish 'Iraq. Position andhoundaries.—^he Qadha of Shamiyah is situated between the Euphrates river on the east and the Bahr-an-Najaf or lower course of the Shatt-al -Hindiyah on the west. On the south it is bounded by the beginning of the Shamiyah Desert, from which it derives its name ; on the west by the Qadha of Najaf in the Sanjaq of Karbala ; and on the north and east by the Qadhas of Hillah and Diwaniyah respectively. Topography and inhabitants, —The administrative headquarters of the district are at Hamidijah, a place described in the article on Umm-al -Ba'rur which was formerly the seat of the administration ; the largest places in the Qadha are probably Hamidiyah and Shmafiyah, the latter a village which forms the subject of a separate article. The Mushkhab tract, Jaarah and,Abu Sikhair, important places in the Qadha, are noticed in the article on the Shatt-al -Hindiyall.

The inhabitants of all the tracts of this Nahiyah are Hamaidat. Regarding-the Markaz Nahiyah and the Nahiyah of Shinafiyah we have no detailed information; but the latter, it is said ; is not divided into Muqata'ahs. There is also, either separate or included in one of the above Nabiyahs, a Muqata'ah of Ja'arah which is owned in its entirety by the Dairat-as- Saniyah and is cultivated by Al Bu Fatlah, Ghazalah, Ibrahim, and A1 Shibil of the Ahl-ad-Dawab and Al Lajam sections : it extends for about 20 miles along both banks of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah below Kufall. In this Muqata'ah, which is one of the most flourishing and prosperous at the present time in Turkish are situated the villages of Abu Sikhair and Ja'arah and the tract of Mushkhab, which are described in the article on the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. Most of the inhabitants of Samiyah are agriculturists j the rest are breeders of hoises ; sheep, goats, etc. Population, —The fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 65,000 souls. With the exception of about 500 persons in the employ ment of the Turkish Government, who are Sunnis, Muhammadans belonging to local tribes. all are Shi ; ah 5 s 21732 SHAMlYAH QADHA Resources.—Hhe number of date palms in the district is calculated at about 75^000. Besides wheat and barley, grown in spring, large quantities o£ rice are cultivated in the summer, and rice may perhaps be regarded as the staple crop of the district. The whole district is marshy and unhealthy, and only a proportion of its area is in present circum stances capable of cultivation. Livestock are numerous, and there are many buffaloes. The grazing in Shamiyah is excellent, and even the northern Shammar are said to visit the Shamiyah pastures in summer. Nothing is manufactured locally except mats of reeds. j4.dmiuistTdtiou: Shamiyah is a Qadha of the 1st class. It is divided into 5 Nahiyahs,. z;^., that of the M arkaz or headquarters, that of Ghamas, and those of Hor Allah, Salahiyah and Shinafiyah ; these subdivisions are all of the second class. The Markaz is Hanridiyah near Umm-al-Ba'rur: the headquarters of Ghamas are at an Arab encamp ment between Hamidiyah and SMnafiyall; those of Hor Allah at an Arab encampment between Shinafiyah and Samawah Town; those of Salahiyah at an A rab encampment between the Shatt-al-Hindiyah and Hamidiyah ; and those ot Shinafiyah at Shinafiyah. The interest of the Dairat-as-Saniyah in Ja'arah, which is one of the largest and most prosperous places in the Qadha, has already been mentioned above. SHAMMAR This term primarily denotes the hilly portion of the territory of the (JABAL) Shammar tribe in northern Central Arabia, that is, the region which has tor its chief landmarks the Aja and Salmah hills. On the plain between TORTH ^ ese ^ wo ran ^ es ^ e3 Hail^ the capital of the Shammar Amir, and from ERN c ^ cums ^ ance J doubtless, the words Jabal Shammar have come to be NAJI)* employed,' 5 —almost as an equivalent of Dirat Ibn Rashid ^ — to designate the whole of the Amir^s dominions. As the principality governed from Hail is a political unit, and as, in some other respects also, it lends itself to a general description, we shall proceed to deal with it as a whole under the title of Jabal Shammar. ' Jabal Shammar' in the more restricted sense will be styled in this article ' Jabal Shammar proper/' * For information regarding antliorijties, snaps, etc., sef footnote to the title of the article Ifajd.Olii M SHAMMAR (JABAL) I733 of Jahal Shawmar. —The dominions of Ibn Rashid extend on the north to the Hamad^ a portion of the Syrian desert ; and embrace the oasis of Jauf-al-'Amir and Wadi Sirhan, but the frontier in this direction is indefinite. The Ruwalah and Dhafir tribes to the north and north-east may be regarded as entirely independent of the Amir; but the Shararat owe him a nominal allegiance, and the whole of the Nafud or Great Northern Desert, in which he maintains posts at Haiyamyah and Trubah, is under his control. On the east his influence does not extend beyond the Dahanah desert. On the south Wadi-ar-Eummall is the approximate limit of the Amir's jurisdiction ; but on this side we must exclude that portion of Qasim which, with Buraidah for chief town, lies noith of the Wadi, and include, midway between Qasim and Madinah, a considerable district south of Wadi-ar-Rummah where the authority of the Amir, if of any ruler, may be considered to prevail. To the west the watershed between the Red Sea and the plateau of Central Arabia is roughly the boundary of the Amir's possessions, which comprise Taimahand Hayat but not Madain Salih or Khaibar. Madinah lies in about 100 miles from his south-western border. j?hysiccil featuTGs of Jcthal SJiaiUTiiciT pTOjoev. —The more outlying possessions of the Amir of Hail—Jauf-al-'Amir and its connected villages, ^'adi Sirhan, the Nafud, and the Taimah oasis—are described in separate articles under their own names. The central region or Jabal Shammar proper may be shortly described as a granitic and basaltic plateau with a mean elevation above the sea of o,000 to 4,000 feet,* diversified by some mountain ranges but generally consisting of gravelly plains with intervals of sand. The bulk of this region drains southwards to Wadi-ar-Rummah, but the Batn plain between Jabal Aja and Jabal Salmah discharges its floods to the north- eastern desert, in which they are soon lost, A few springs occur in the hills, but in the plains flowing water is not seen ; life and cultivation depend on wells, of which the depth is usually considerable but the ^ater, as a rule, is soft and wholesome. On the north the igneous central region of Jabal Shammar proper passes abruptly into the sands of the Nafud desert ; on the east and south-east it merges, through a transi- * The elevations given in this Gazetteer and in the map accoinpanying it have been very carefully worked out by Lieutenant F. Fraser Hunter of the Survey of India from the observations taken by Huber in 1883-84 and with reference to barometric pressure at mean sea level at Karachi at the actual times of the observations. The results are closely corroborated, in some cases, by heights given in the recent Turkish survey for the Hijaz Railway.1734 SHAMMAR (JABAL) tional stage of sandstone ; into the sands of DaMnah and Qasim ; on the south it stretches unbroken up to and far beyond the Shammar boundary ; on the south-west it has a unique termination in the Harrat Khaibar ; on the west it gives place to a wide sandstone tract that reaches to Taimah and beyond. The cardinal features of Jabal Shammar proper are the twin ranges of Aja and Salmah, to which principally it owes its title of ' Jabal, ^ and the plain between them ; called Batn . Jabal Aja is fully described elsewhere ; it is a great parapet of granite, 75 miles in length, with a maximum elevation above the plain of 2,000 feet, which protects the country on the north-west side against the advancing sands of the Nafud. Jabal Salmah, also the subject of a separate article, is a miniature Aja parallel to the first and distant from it 30 miles to the south-east. The plain of Batn, enclosed between the two, is the heart of the Shammar principality ; on it stands the capital. Hail, and the town of Qafar. Some of the subfeatures of Jabal Shammar proper are the follow- inff:— Name. Position. Nature. Eemaeks. Baharat Sharhan About 10 miles west of Sab'an. A plain several miles in extent. Overgrown with scrub j and contains good camel-grazing. Da'aijan (Wadi) Begins in the slopes of Jabal Aja about 35 miles south-west of Hail. A valley on the right bank of which stands Hall town ; imme diately beyond Hail it pierces Jabal Samra. i Also called Wadi Hail. The whole course of the Wadi is from south-west to north-east, and it appears to end in the Baqa'a hollow 45 miles north-east of Hail, or even earlier, and not to join Wadi- ar -Rummah as was at one time supposed. Fitiq (Jabal) 18 miles south-east of Hail. A small chain of granitic hills. Parallel to Jabal Aja and Jabal Sal mall and about midway between them, but only some 20 railes in length. Habshi (Jabal) Begins a few miles east of Samirah and skirts the north side of the road thence to Buraidah for some miles. A range of black basaltic hills.

The height above the plain is over 600 feet and the slope of the sides about 70° or 80®, There is fair pasture about, and the place is often named by the Amir of Jabal Shammar as a ren dezvous for his military expeditions. The rocks of this and neighbouring hills abound in Himyar itic inscriptions and pictures. Rummau (Jabal) Ul (wA/O) 50 miles south of Hail. A small range running south-west wards from the southern extremity of Jabal Salmah. The range is traversed by a gorge through which runs a route from Hail to the south. Jabal Rumman may be regarded as the limit of the Batn plain on the south. Samra (Jabal) Adjoining Hail town on the north and east. ... See article Hail. Sirrali (Jabal) w 40 miles south by west of Hail. A hill on the route from Hail to Mus- tajiddah. Remarkable for a long Himyaritic in scription of 98 charac ters.

Two other important features of Jabal Shammar, though they lie beyond tlie limits of Jabal Shammav proper^ may be mentioned here; they w are Jabal Misma Uw© and the Harrat Khaibar j-uA. to which allusion has already been made. Jabal Misma is a range of reddish sandstone in vertical stratification; it is crossed by the ordinary route from Hail to Taimah about 60 miles west of Jabal Aja, to which it is approximately parallel^ and it abounds in Aramaean and Himyaritic inscriptions. Harrat Khaibar is a great lava region which begins about 100 miles south-west of Hail and extends perhaps 100 miles further in the same coloured sketch of this hill will be found at the end of Huher's Journal de Voyage, ' Y1736 SHAMMAR (JABAL) direction with an average breadth of probably 50 miles. The town of Khaibar, which does not belong to the Jabal Shammar principality, is situated in the Harrah towards the further end, and the village of Hay at, which acknowledges Ibn Rashid, lies in a cleft in the nearer extremity. Wadi-ar-Rummah has its origin in this tract. Climate, products and animals of Jabal Shammar The climate of Jabal Shammar proper is healthy. There is considerable cold in Wintev: indeed snow has been known to fall and to lie for a few days, causing much mortality among camels. Rain is uncommon; and showers, when they fall, are local and erratic. Date palms are abundant in the plains and flourish even in clefts and hollows of the hills, as for instance in the remarkable amphitheatre of 'Aqdah. Other fruit-trees are found, but their number is limited by difficulties of irrigation. Wheat, barley, oats, millet, and maize are grown, partly on unirrigated lands; also lucerne for fodder: it is said that the grain produced is in good years sufficient for local consumption, and that it fetches a higher price than what is imported from abroad. Gourds of uncommon size and pumpkins and melons of different sorts are raised and are stored in large quantities for winter consumption. Truffles grow in the desert. Horses are more numerous than in Southern Najd and are owned in greater or smaller numbers by all the wealthier men. The camels of the country are good, though not equal to those of Southern Najd or 'Oman ; they are of lighter colour, better tempered and more tractable than those of Southern Najd. Donkeys, frequently white, are used for short journeys between inhabited places. Cattle are few and poor. Sheep and goats are numerous, the former being all of the broad- tailed variety and yielding fine wool; the sheep of the Harb tribe are mostly black. Dogs are not many and are kept at a distance for religious reasons. There is a sufficiency of fowls. Wild animals include the leopard (Nimr), wolf (Dhlb), hysena (Dhaba'); jackal, fox (Husani), mountain-goat (Badan and Wa'al), gazelle (Dhabi) of various kinds, and wild cat (Fahd) ; also the hare (Arnab), and a curious creature called Wabar, resembling a large grey Alpine rat, but arboreal in Its habits in spite of the want of claws. Besides these are found a large variety of lizard called Dhabb, the hedgehog (Abu Shauk), the ^oi jerboa; scorpions and snakes. In some of the deserts there are ostriches; 1^, other birds are the hawk, buzzard, small black eagle and small whiteSHAMMAR (JABAL) ITSV carrion eagle; the true vulture is not found.* The climate, flora and fauna of the Nafud are described in the article on that region, Population of Jahal Shammar. —The settled inhabitants of Jabal Shammar proper are chiefly Shammar, mingled on the side towards Wadi- ar -Rummah and Qasim with some Bani Tamim ; the Shammar are enterprising both in trade and war, while the Bani Tamim are skilful and diligent in agriculture but take little interest in other matters. In the west, beyond the limits of the central region, especially at Hay at and Huwaiyat, are negro communities; and there are a few sedentary Hat aim. The villages of the plain are surrounded with mud walls and flanked by watch towers resembling lighthouses; generally they stand in date groves which rise from amidst an expanse of sand. Villagers and townsmen are commonly lean and tall, and often of un healthy appearance; they have somewhat remarkable eyes and long faces of a flat or hollow type. Diseases of vision are rife; it is even said that one person out of every three is partly blind. The men wear a long garment of white cloth under a black, brown or black-and-white striped ; Aba; their head-dress is a cloth kerchief and their foot-wear sandals: the garb of the women consists of a blue gown, beneath a black or brown''Aba which covers the figure from head to foot, and of a black crape veil. In mind the people are more active, and in disposition more magnanimous, than the sedentary population of Bijaz. The national character is temperate and self-restrained; brawls are consequently uncommon. Wahhabi-ism no longer tyrannises over the land, but in some families moustaches are still shaved and smoking is discountenanced ; de votion to the coffee cup is however universal. Pastimes are few and gambling is unknown. The prevailing form of religion is Sunni-ism of a fanatical cast, which does not readily tolerate the presence of Jews or Christians. The law of inheritance is that of the Quran. There is a strong prejudice against the marriage of Arab women with negroes or half-castes. Many of the people can read and write, but men of real education are rare; the art of extempore composition in verse, however, is said to be commonly practised among both sexes. The people consider their language to be purer than that of Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt or Hijaz, but admit that it has departed from the standard of the Qnran; the final n of nouns is by them pronounced indistinctly. * Full information about the animals and birds of the country will be found in Huber's Journal de Voyage, pages 568 —71 and 576 —80 .1738 SHAMMAR (JABAL) The foregoing remarks refer to the fixed population of the central tract: information regarding the settled inhabitants of the outlying parts of the state will be found in the articles on Jauf-al-'Amir, Wadi Sirhan, the Nafud and Taimah. Roughly estimated the non-nomadic popula tion amounts to 28 ; 000 souls, composed as follows ;— Jabal Sam mar proper . Jauf-al-'Amir and district Wadi Sirhan . Nafud . . . . Taimah . . . . Total 15,0 (10 10,000 250 750 2,000 28,000 The Bedouins of Jabal Shammar comprise the whole of the nomad Shammar, inhabiting the country round Hall ; part of the 'Anizah, in the northern Nafud and on the west between Jabal Aja and Taimah : some of the Shararat, in and about Wadi Sirhan ; and part of the Harb and most of the Hatalm, upon Wadi-ar-Rummah between Harrat Khaibar and Qasim. Most of these are Arabs, but the Shara rat and Hataim belong to inferior castes, as do the despised Sulaba and ■'Awazim, or HaWazim, who also have their recognised beats and loca tions in Jabal Shammar territory. The nomadic population may be set in round numbers at 27,000 souls, as below 'Anizah • Harb Hataim , Shammar Shararat . 'Awazim, Sulaba, etc. Total 12,000 3,000 3,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 27,000 The life of these Bedouins is at once free and hard, roving and monotonous. For nine months of the year they are dispersed over the country in small Farqan or nomad villages, each Fariq consisting of families more or less connected by blood ; but in the height of summer the Farqan collect together and form large Manzils or standing encampments at the principal watering places of the Dirah, that is, of the territory belonging to the tribe. The Bedouin women wear a silver ring in the right nostril and have a braided forelock hanging over the temple; the majority of them cover their faces from the mouth downwards.'^ Close and friendly intercourse * Some of the customs, etc., of a typical Bedouin tribe, though not one belonging 'Ij ^ to Jabal Shammar, are described in the article on the Mutair.SHAMMAR (JABAL) 1739 between the village and desert populations is a peculiar feature of Jabal Shammar, and one by which national life and unity are sensibly strengthened; it results probably from community of bloody the bulk of both sedentary and nomad classes being here of one tribe, the Shammar. The townspeople, in whose hands is the caravan trade, frequently send their worn-out camels to recover in the desert under the care of the Bedouins and hire fresh animals from the nomads to take their place. Again, most Bedouin families own date gardens in the Aja and Salrnah hills and encamp beside them in the date season, whereby a complete exchange of roles takes place, for some town families are accustomed to wander in the desert in spring accompanied by their horses, camels and sheep. Occasional companionship in arms also brings the two classes together, but in skill and courage the towns man or villager enjoys an indisputable superiority over the nomad. We may estimate the total population of Jabal Shammar at 55,000 souls; and as the area of the principality (including the Nafud) is 70,000 square miles at the least, there is less than one person on the average to the square mile.* Trade and industries* —Jabal Shammar is an entirely pastoral and agricultural country, yet it is hardly self-supporting even as regards the necessaries of life. In bad years there is a heavy import of grain from Turkish 'Iraq through Karbala and Najaf ;and rice, which is a luxury, is brought from that side at all times. Manufactured goods come from abroad through Turkish 'Iraq, Southern Najd and Hijaz, and are hawked about the country by itinerant vendors. Iron, metal for tinning, English pig-lead and English gunpowder can be obtained in the Hail market, and most of the cotton cloth worn in the country is of Bombay or Manchester make. Horses, collected from the Bedouin breeders bv merchants for sending vigj Basrah to India, and camels, which find a sale in Turkish Iraq, are the most noteworthy exports ; some ghi and wool also are sent abroad. Common cloth is woven by the women in their homes, and striped ; Abas and coarse carpets are made ; other than these there are no manufactures. Usury and money-lenders are said to be as yet unknown. Eiyals or Maria Theresa dollars and Turkish Majidis make up the ordinary currency, while the small silver is mostly Persian. The weights and # The detailed estimates given above of population are of course in a high degree1740 SHAMMAR (JABAL) measures of Jabal Shammar are the same as those of Southern Najd, but at Hail there is a Sa' used for measuring glii which is double the size of the ordinary Sa'. Internal administration. —In the prosperous days of the Jabal Shammar principality, about 1880, it was governed with vigour and efficiency. The Amir or Mahfudh , as he was at that time generally styled, maintained a fluctuating force of 500 to 1,000 armed retainers, distinguished by brown cloaks, red and blue Kafiyahs and silver-hilted swords, who formed the nucleus of his fighting force. For the rest a loose system of compulsory military service prevailed. According to a cautious estimate, the Amir had at call in the settled villages about 2,000 fighting men, mostly mounted on dromedaries ; but only about a fourth of this number could be mustered for a particular expedition. It was calculated that he could raise about 1,800 nomads as well, mounted on dromedaries •, but this Bedouin contingent was not trusted. The fire arms of the country were at that time old fashioned, but modern rifles are now widely distributed. From the attention bestowed by more than one European visitor on taxation and finance we may infer that the subject was a prominent one at Hall a quarter of a century ago. There were taxes on date trees, on corn and on sheep, which were regularly collected even in the remoter districts ; Turkish coin was accepted in the villages north of the Nafud, and elsewhere payment seems to have been made in kind. An incidence of £1 per head of taxation seems to have been not uncommon in either town or country. The ordinary Government revenue, exclusive of large receipts from pilgrim caravans, was about £50,000 a year, the greater part being derived from the settled population, besides wLich the Amir owned valuable private property. His chief expenditure was on hospitality, which he dispensed on a lavish scale, and large sums also went in military expeditions and stores, in presents and political bribes, especially in disbursements at Makkah and Madinah made to secure his border from Turkish encroachments. Justice was well administered ; theft, in consequence of the rigorous infliction of the usual Muhammadan penalty, was almost unknown; highway robbery had been stamped out ; and arms were not usually carried in Jabal Shammar proper. The Grovernment was popular with all classes, and its policy was influenced by public opinion to an extent not universal in the countries of Europe;. The chief political weakness was uncertainty regarding the succession to the chiefship.SHAMMAR (JABAL) 1741 In recent years the prestige and power of the Amir have been seriously reduced by the defeats which he has suffered at the hands of his rival Ibn Sa ud and by the dependent relations which he has found it necessary to form with the Turks ; it is probable however that his system of internal government, so far as it has escaped disorganisation, remains substanti ally the same as it was before. The ruling family of Jabal Shammar, which belongs to the Ja'far section of the ^Abdah branch of the Shammar tribe, is generally charac terised by ability and caution ; but there is a strain of insanity in the blood which has shown itself most strongly in the collaterals of 'Obaid's line.* Fiom the fact that the father, or possibly a more remote ancestor, of the founder of their house was named Rashid, the family are known as the Al Rashid ^ Jj • and their head, the ruler of the day, is often spoken of as Ibn Rashid in contradistinction to Ibn Sa'ud, the Wahhabi Amir of Southern Najd. A petulance which is apt to distinguish the Al Rashid princes in early youth is attributed to their upbringing along with slaves. The family own large private estates in Jabal Shammar {e.g., at Hayat and Laqitah), in Jauf-al-'Amir and at Taimah^ which alone would secure to them consideration in a country so poor as Jabal Shammar. The Wasm of the Al Rashid is IX or +, which is placed, in camels, on the near quarter ; their battle-cry is cw J ' A horseman of the Compassionate, a descendant of Sin'us.'' Sin^us is believed to have been an ancestor of the tribe, and the chief in addressing his followers sometimes calls them Sina'is. —Jabal Shammar has, as we have seen, a fixed population of about 28,000 and a nomadic population of about 27,000 souls, or in all 55,000 inhabitants, and the density of population falls short of one parson to the square mile. Such a country would ordinarily be a cypher in politics, but Jabal Sham mar is rescued from insignificance by its central and commanding situation. Practically equidistant from Damascus, Baghdad and Makkah, it li^s also midway between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and dominates several routes. Its external relations, however, are more restricted than might be anticipated from such a position ; and,—with the reservation that Jauf-al-'Amir and the part adjoining it are in communication with Syria while normally, that is in the absence of hostility between the rulers, there is some slight intercourse with Kuwait, —Jabal Shammar may be said to have no * A genealogical table p£ the family will be found in the historical volume of thi^ Gazetteer.1742 SHAMMAR (JABAL) dealings except with Turkish ^Iraq. There is but one route to Syria, by Jauf-aVAmir ; to Turkish ; Iraq there are at least two, a western and an eastern, the former being the safer though the more arduous, while the latter is a section of the Najaf-Makkah route. These routes 1 are dealt with at greater length in the article on Najd. There is an inveterate enmity between the rulers of Northern and Southern Najd, and the chances of war have for some years been adverse to L Jabal Shammar, of which the fortunes are now correspondingly depressed. The principality has for the present sunk into a state of semi-vassalage to Turkey, but it does not appear that any part of its territory is occupied by Turkish troops, or that the Amir has renounced the right of negotiating with foreign powers.* Topography* —The principal inhabited or frequented places in Jabal Shammar proper are given below ; with them are included three which belong to the Harrat Khaibar Name.

They are a powerful tribe whose territory adjoins ^Iraq on the north- west, but they lie generally beyond the scope of this Gazetteer: the Shammar of Jabal Shammar are their relations and the Shammar Tdqah are reckoned one of their offshoots.f Some of their Bedouins frequent the Shaniiyall and Najaf Qadhas. *Thurghud actually lies beyond the limits of Jabal Shammar Proper, f For particulars regarding the Northern Shammar, see Gazetteer of Baghdad, 1889, pages 126 and Ji42-3 ; also Lady Anne Bl^nt's Bedouins of the Euphrates, iitis m] W i isii h tei He St H\i t ^Ui taiicSHAMMAR (SOUTHBEN) 1749 One of the most remarkable and important tribes of Central Arabia; they form the main strength of the Jabal Shammar principality and the Amir himself is of their number. Part of the Southern Shammar are settled and part are Bedouin, Distribution, The settled portion of the Southern Shammar are almost confined to the plains between or immediately adjoining the ranges o£Aja and Salmahj the more northern parts of these they monopolise, and the central and southern they share with the Bani Tamim ; they have moreover an important detached colony at Taimah and a smaller one at 'Ayun in Qasim. The ascertained settlements of the Shammar in Jabal Shammar are Hail ; Taimah^ 'Alaq, 'Aqdah, Ayun, Bida, Faid; Ghazalah, Hafainah, Hafnah, Jadhamiyah, Kahafah, Laqitah, Muqaq, Mustajiddah, ; Odhaim, Qasr-ar-Rabai'iyah, Sab^an, Tabah and Waqid. A number of the inhabitants of permanent villages in Qasim also claim Shammar descent, especially at Butainiyat, Ab-ad-Dud, Hamar^ Qasr Sa^id, Shaihiyah, Shiqqah and Tanumah. There are settled Shammar at Qana in the Nafud, at -'Attar and Zilfi in Sadair, and even in the villages of Wadi-al-Miyah in the Hasa Sanjaa . some Shammar also, apparently of the Ja'afar subdivision, reside in Hofuf town in the Hasa Oasis. The Bedouins of the tribe have on the whole a more extensive range. On the south they enter the borders of Qasim ; on the west they reach to Jabal Misma ; on the north they visit the wells of Shaq^q towards Jauf-al-^Amir, dispute Batn beyond the Nafud with the 'Anizah and camp in Hajarah ; on the east their boundary is a line drawn southwards through a point to the east of Lainah. Places near which they are known to encamp in Qasim are 'k mudiyah, Anbuwan^ Ab-ad- Dud, Barud-as-Siyah and Saqiyah, all close to its northern border ; Haiyaniyah, Jubbah and Umm-al-Qulban are among their camping places in the Nafud ; to them belongs Wadi-ar-JRutha ; the easternmost wells of which it is certain that they avail themselves are those of Bida^, some miles east of Lainah, where some of them pitch their tents in the hot weather, and those of the Madhhur tract at the south-east end of the Nafud. As has been remarked in the article on Jabal Shammar the distinction between nomads and non-nomads is not so sharply drawn among the Shammar as in some of the other tribes which follow both courses of life. Mode of life, —The western territories of the Shammar tribe are full of basaltic and grey-red granite hills and contain many water •holes \ and1750 SHAMMAR (SOUTHERN) their Bedouins live even more dispersedly than is usual among Central Arabian nomads. In the valleys of Jabal Aja and Jabal Salmah the Shammar Bedouins own a multiplicity of small date plantations, in which they camp during the summer months ; but they depend chiefly on their flocks and herds, and they eke out their subsistence by carrying merchants' goods on camels and by transporting pilgrims to and from Madinah. In their tents the wife^s apartment is at the left side in entering. Of the settled Shammar it is unnecessary to speak at length as they are included in the description of the fixed population of Jabal Shammar. Character,— Shammar are one of the most vigorous tribes of Arabia and regard themselves as the noblest of all,—a pretension which may be excessive but is not without justification. They are believed to be mainly of Yamani or Qahtanic descent but do not appear to be of unmixed race. The men are generally tall, wear brown 'Abas, and are easily distinguishable in physiognomy from their neighbours the 'Anizah. The Shammar are of a hospitable disposition. Divisions and numbers, —-The Shammar tribe consists of 5 main divi sions, the 'Abdah 8^, Aslam ^1, Dighairat , Sinjarah and Tuman ; these again are constituted of the following subdivisions and sections :— I ^—'Abdah division, j Miyakhah 1.

The numbers of the settled Shammar are included in the estimated population of Jabal Shammar Proper j and the nomad Shammar, regard being had to their political strength and to the wideness of their range, cannot be placed at less than 4,000 souls. SHAMMA. This tribe of Turkish 'Iraq is reputed a branch of the Northern Shammar or Shammar Jarbah : it was originally Sunni, but is now tiylo entirely Shi^ab. Tbe Shamir:ar Toqab domains extend upon the left bank of the Tigris from Baghdad to opposite Bghailah, and the depth of the tribal territory from the Tigris bank in the direction of the Persian hills is about 25 miles and includes part of the course of the Diyalah. Mucb information about tbe divisions of tbe Sbammar will be found in Huber [Journal de Voyage, pages 637-8, 660-4 and 670). It does not fit in well with that given in tbe text.A SHAMSHAMlYAH 1753 t Considerable uncertainty prevails as to the true divisions of the Sham - mar Toqah, but the following may be mentioned 1. Banwah uj 2. Battah diaj w 3. Da'aiyah or D^ajah 4. Dalabhah 5. Da war 6. Dawud 7. Hadail 8. Khawalid 9. Majabilah dbUr^ 10. Majli 11. Manahir 12. Manasir 13. Mardan 14. Nifafshah ^Lai 15. Qaraghol Jj-^fy 16. Qufaifan or Eukaifan 17. Shwaifi 18. Shuwaiqi 19. Sud ; an 20. Zakaitat bkjfj Of these the Qufaifan and Manasir, who live on the Tigris a little below Khanasah and Ctesiphon respectively^ are possibly Zubaid ; and so perhaps are the Qaraghol. Some regard the Dafafi^ah as a separate tribe, others as a branch of the Shammar Toqah. Sections known as 'Atbah txl* and Salmat oUL- are found in the Kut-al-Amarah Qadha; of these the former have their residence among the Bani Rabl^ah; and there are ''Atbah also in the 'Aziziyah Qadha. The distribution of the sections given above will be found, in part, in the article on the ; Aziziyali Qadha. The Shammar Toqah are agriculturists and a large proportion of them are now employed by Kazim Pasha, a brother-in-law of the present Sultan of Turkey, who is kept in honourable detention at Baghdad, to cultivate his lands near Ctesiphon; their crops are wheat, barley, maize, and sesame. They also breed cattle and camels. Like most of the other cultivating Arab tribes, thev are inclined to wander in spring, and tents are their only dwellings at all seasons. As yet the Shammar Toqah are not well provided with modern rifles, iior are they strong in horses. The recognised Shaikh of the whole tribe is at present Saiyid Suftikh, and the actual heads of the Khawalid and Qaraghol section are Abtan-al-Hardi and Mutlaq-bin-Rashid respectively. An island in the Shatt-al-^Arab belonging to the left bank; behind SHAMSHA- it is the mouth of the Khaiyain creek, which here forms the boundary MI YAH between Persia and Turkey ; and opposite to it, on the other side of the river, is the tract known as Baljaniyah.1754 SHAMSHAMITAH ShamsliamTyali; itself only a mile long, is virtually a continuation o£ the Island of Tawallah; but it is divided from Umm-al -Khasasif, the next island below it, by the main stream of the Shatt-al -'Arab, which here sets from the right to the left bank. On Shamshamiyah is a post of Turkish Dhabitiyahs, who are respons ible for patrolling the river. There are also some scattered huts, inhabited by about 80 persons of the so-styled Shaikh Hasan tribe, to whom belong about 2,000 date palms, besides other fruit trees, 10 cattle and 20 sheep and goats. Shamshamiyah has apparently come into existence since 1836. It is a Turkish possession, and the Turks have recently proposed to locate on it the sanitary lazaret for travellers arriving in Turkish 'Iraq from the Persian Gulf. SHAQIQ Generally pronounced Shajij or Shagig'. The name of an inlet and of (KHOR) the village which it contains, upon the east side of the Qatar Promontory : the entrance of the inlet, which is shallow and runs about 4 miles inland, is situated between Ras-an-Nof and Ras Matbakh^ about 26 miles north of Dohah. Khor Shaqlq is frequently called u Khor-al-Mahandah,' or simply ' Khor,' in contradistinction to Khuwair,' that is, Khor Hassan, on the other side of the peninsula. The village stands on the south side of the inlet, near its foot; not far from it is a hill, surmounted by a watch tower, and under the hill is a well of good water called Halaitan Dhakhirall is only 4 miles to the northward of Khor Shaqlq and is reached by a track which turns the foot of the inlet and then crosses a level plain. Four miles south of Khor Shaqiq is Halat Wabil cUjj an island-reef, still covered at high tide but said to be rapidly increasing in elevation. The village consists of about 400 mud and stone houses of Mahandah, half of the A1 Hasan and half of the Misandah section, to whom belong 80 pearl boats, 90 other sea-going vessels, and 30 fishing boats, besides 100 camels. A long, shallow valley, forming a district in the principality of Kuwait, perhaps 80 miles long from north to south and on the average about 10 miles broad. On the north it ends about 20 miles north-west of Jahrah; on the south it is bounded by Dhula^al -Mi'aijil ; XJmm Janaib SHAQQI,,,.., SHARAIJA.H 1755 encloses it on the east and DiMlball on the west; Summan approaches its south-western corner. Shaqq has no fixed inhabitants^ but yields most of the grass and firewood that are sold in the town of Kuwait; in the north it marks the boundary between the Hamdh grazing 1 on the east and the ''Arfaj on the west. Where it is crossed by the route from Kuwait Town to Riqa^i, at 40 miles west-south-west of Kuwait, it contains a Khabrah called Faraq jjjlji ; and similarly on the direct route to Hafar, at 54 miles south-west of Kuwait Town ; there is situated in it Khabrat-ad-Dawish which was disputed in 1905 between the ^Ajman and the Mutair and was assigned by the Shaikh of Kuwait to the latter. A large town, the capital of the Washam district in Southern Najd; SHAQRAH it is situated towards the west side of the district about 100 miles south east of ''Anaizah and the same distance north-west by west of Riyadh. Shaqrah stands in a plain between two hills, one to the north^ the other to the south, which are two miles or more apart. The town is surrounded by a wall, both high and thick, with towers ; and ifc has 4 gates. The date plantations belonging to Shaqrah are considerable, and there are many wells of excellent water about 8 fathoms deep both inside and outside the town. The population is about 3,000 souls, mostly Bani Zaid, but partly Sabai' of the Sudah section ; besides cultivating they engage in trade, dealing principally with Kuwait. The bazaar is large and contains nlany shops. There are about 500 camels and many horned cattle besides sheep and goats, but horses and donkeys are few. Shaqrah lies on the direct route between ''Anaizah and Riyadh. Between 1874 and 1884 the place was tributary to the Amir of Buraidah. The ruling- family are Bani Zaid of a section called A1 Sabyan. The principal village in Jabal Akhdhar; it stands on terraces on the face of a cliff at the head of W adi Mi'aidin and looks down the valley; its elevation above the sea is 6,300 feet. The houses are square, solid and built of stone j but they are small and mean in appearance and a SHARAI- JAH tsHr1756 SHARAIJAH few only are plastered with clay; the windows are narrow and the doors small, the better to keep out the weather. The dwellings appear to over hang one another, and the different rows are connected only by flights of irregular steps. Sharaijah consists of a main village with two annexes called, as is not uncommon in 'Oman, ^Ain ^ {i e., having a spring) and 'Aqarjix {i .e., barren). Just below the village are a copious spring of pure water and a circular reservoir. Cultivation extends for about 1,000 feet down the hillside upon ledges, only 10 or 12 feet wide, which are frequently revetted. These 'pensile gardens/'' as they have been called, contain apricots, grapes, figs, pomegranates and grain ; the grain is sometimes sown intermixed with leguminous plants and even with melons. The greatest attention is given to the cultivation of the grape, and from it the inhabi tants make a wine with which they regale themselves in the long winter evenings; after the vine the pomegranate appears to be the most highly valued plant. The people are Bani Eiyam (100 houses) and Bani 'Umr (100 houses). Animals are 100 donkeys, 60 cattle and 400 sheep and goats. The name a Sharaijah' J means a place where water flows out of rocks into soft ground. A considerable Bedouin tribe on the northern borders of Central Arabia between Jabal Shammar and Palestine; on the north-west they reach to Ma^an towards the Bed and the Dead Seas, on the west to Tabuk on the south to Taimah, and on the north-east to Jauf-al- ^Amir ; on the last side they make excursions into the Nafud as far as to the wells of Shaqiq. Some of the tribe are permanently settled in Jauf=al- 'Amir. Wadi Sirhan is the headquarters of the tribe, and one of their principal summer stations is at 'Obaid between Taimah and Jauf-al- ^Amir. The Shararat Dirah, generally, is one of sandstone hills. The tribe are not considered to be Arabs ; they rank below all Arab Bedouins, but above the Hat aim and the Sulaba. Striking differences appear to exist among the Shararat. Some of those in the north are of fair com plexion and blond, but dirty and almost naked ; the men are strong and handsome, and the women are bold with an innocent freedom in the presence of the opposite sex. Shararat coming in to trade at Taimah, on the other hand, have been described as lean and ragged with quiet and dejected manners. The Shararat possibly number 3,500 souls and they are divided into a number of sections not subject to any common chief. The Shararat have almost no horses, but their riding camels are theSHABJAH PRINCIPALITY 1757 lightest and swiftest in Western Arabia and are used by Ibn Rasbid to mount hisarmed retainers. The dealings of the Shararat are chiefly with Jauf-al- Amir, which they visit in the date harvest to barter camels, cattle, wool, butter, cheese, rice imported from abroad, and even milk, for dates, mats, sacks^ tent cloth, 'Abas and calico ,* they also resort to Taimah, where their camels and wool find a market. Besides these two places they have no market town. The Shararat render tribute and obedience to the Amir of Jabal Shammar. An Arab tribe represented in the Jarrahi District by two sections, SHARIF AT the Rajaibat and the Bani Rashid asAj : ^b, who inhabit the left bank of the Jarrahi River near Khalfabad, The former section has 20 fighting men and 30 horses, the latter 30 fighting men and 35 horses, and each has about 100 camels, besides some donkeys, cattle and sheep; both inhabit tents, but both are to some extent tillers of the ground. The Sharif at are also found in the Hindiyan District at Hindiyan Village, Shirabad and QaFeh Mashraqi, and upon the Turkish side of the Shatt-al -'Arab in the neighbourhood of Abul Khasib. Those who visit Qal'eh Mashraqi are nomads and number about 100 families : the remainder of those in the Hindiyan District are few but settled. The chiefs of the Sharif at are called Mirs and the tribe themselves claim descent from the Shurafa of Makkah, but they are generally believed to be of Bani T a mini (I) extraction. They seem to have immigrated from Najd about 200 years ago. Also written , and pronounced both Sharjah and Shargah. SHARJAH Limits and extent.— Shaikhdom of Sharjah, the most important of the Arab principalities of Trucial 'Oman, covers a considerable portion of the 'Oman Promontory ; indeed with the exception of the small Shaikhdoms of 'Ajman and Umm-al -Qaiwain on the west coast, and of a part of the interior which is virtually independent, it may be considered to embrace everything between a line joining Sha'am to Dibah on the north and another connecting Sharjah Town and Khor Kalba on the f For authorities, maps, chart?, etc., see first footnote to article Trucial 'Oman.1758 SHARJAH PRINCIPALITY south. On the east it is bounded by the Gulf of 'Oman and on the west by the Persian Gulf, Divisions, —The principality consists of 4 portions, Damely, of the Ras-al -Khaimah District on the north ; of the Shamailiyah tract on the east ; of the village and plain of Dhaid in the interior ; and, lastly, of what we may call the district of Sharjah Proper upon the west coast towards the south. The upper part of Wadi-al -Qor belongs to Sharjah : it is uncertain whether it should be regarded as connected with Shamailiyah or with Dhaid. The maritime possessions of Sharjah are the islands of Bu Musa and Sir Bu Na^air, which are associated with the district of Sharjah Proper ; and the island of Tunb, and probably that of Nabiyu Tunb, which are attached to the Ras-al -Khaimah District. The island of Sirri was once, it cannot be doubted, in the effective occupation of the Shaikh of Bharjah ; but, though the validity of Persian claims to it is not admitted by the British Government, it cannot be regarded at the present time as forming part of the Sharjah dominions. Tie district of SharjaJi Projoer.—Th.Q other divisions of the prin cipality are separately described elsewhere under their own names, but the district of Sharjah Proper can be most conveniently dealt with at this point in the present article. It is situated on the sea between 'Ajman and Dibai, its boundary with the former Shaikhdom being at a place called Dabdabah 2 J miles from the north end of the date groves of Sharjah Town, and with the latter at Abu Hail: Hamriyah however, which is beyond 'Ajman, may be considered as attached to this division. Inland the district does not, it is stated, extend beyond Wasit kwlj , a locality 5 miles east of Sharjah Town, the tract between this and Dhaid not being under the Shaikh's control. The surface of the district is flat sandy desert. The following are the principal places in Sharjah Proper. Name. position Nature. E emxeks, Fasht Oo the coast, 1 mile north-east of Sharjah Town.

The settled population of the district appears to be about 18,750 souls and is almost altogether concenti ated in Sharjah Town ; its tribal com position may be ascertained from the preceding table and the articles quoted therein ; no single tribe enjoys a great numerical preponderance over the rest. Questions of resources^ trade, etc., are chiefly dealt with in the article on Sharjah Town. Population, —The facts regarding the settled population, of the Sharjah principality as a whole can now be thrown into the form of a general statement. The following are the numbers by districts: — Ras-al -Khaimah District ...... 16,000 Shamailiyah. . ...... 10,000 Dhaid 700 District of Sharjah Proper 18,750 Bu Musa island 100 and the total is approximately 45,500 souls. The tribes represented are numerous, and no one of them can claim a general as distinct from1760 SHARJAH PRINCIPALITY a local superiority: they are detailed in the special articles upon the divisions. The subject of Bedouins is dealt with in the general article on Trucial 5 Oman. Resources, trade, and communications.—^^ resources and trade of the Sliarjall ShaikMom are described in the articles upon the component districts and tracts, and in those upon the towns of Sharjah and Ras-al -Khaimah. The total number of pearl boats in the principality appears to be about 360, and they are of average size. The subject of communications is dealt with in the article on Trucial ^Oinan. Administration. —The principality forms a somewhat disjointed whole and is at present governed without efficiency or success. The headquarters district is under the personal rule of the Shaikh, Saqar- bin-Khalid, who resides at Sharjah Town; and the detached oasis of Dhaid is administered by him through the medium of a Wali, at the present time an individual of servile origin. The district of Ras-ak Khaimah is under the management of the Shaikhs only surviv ing son Khalid, who resides at Ras-al -Khaimah Town as Deputy- Governor on behalf of his father ; the town of Dibah however, in that distuct, is held as an appanage by Rashid-bin-A.hmad, a first cousin of the Shaikh of Sharjah, who lives there and enjoys the style of Wali. The Shamailiyah District is nominally made over to Sa^id-bin- Hamad, son of a first cousin of the Shaikh, who is settled at ^Ajman and is in fact beyond the control of his relation and superior; but this is of the less importance that the feudatory has lately been deprived by the rebellious headman of Fujairah of the central part of his fief and of most of his influence in the remainder. The Ras-al -Khaimah and Shamailiyah Districts bring nothing into the exchequer of the Shaikh of Sharjah, but neither are they a source of expense, for the local revenue is sufficient in each case to meet the local expenditure. There are customs houses at the towns of Sharjah and Ras-al -Khaimah only, tiie collections at the former amounting to about Rs* 8,000, and at the latter to about Ks. 800 a year. Piece-goods pay a duty of about per cent, and other articles are charged 2 per cent. There is also a tax of one-twentieth produce in kind on date trees throughout the Shaikh's dominions, but its proceeds, except in the Ras-al -Khaimah District; are insignificant; and other taxes on sheep, miscellaneous cultivation, etc., are stated to yield only about Rs. 1,000 a year. TheSHARJAH TOWN 1761 annual revenue of the Shaikh—apart from taxation of the pearl industry, which is his main resource and produces about Rs. 23^400 a year^—prob- ably does not exceed Rs. 10,000. At Sharjah Town the Shaikh has only about 20 armed retainers, and these, with a larger guard of 70 men maintained by his Deputy^ Governor at Ras-al-Khaimah. Town, compose his entire army. For the defence of Sharjah Town, he relies chiefly upon the ordinary inhabi tants, among whom are some 1,600 rifles. At Sharjah Town, but not at Ras-al-Khaimah, there are public arrangements for the watch and ward of shops at night, and a small due is recovered on this account from the occupiers. Political position. —The ruler of Sharjah is one of the Trucial Shaikhs whose political position is described in the general article on Trucial 'Oman. The name may also be written j it is pronounced both SHJLllJAH Sharjah and Shargah, but the present Shaikh appears to favour the thw W former pronunciation. Sharjah is the largest and most important town on the coast of Trucial '0 HI ail; the capital of the principality of the same name, and the residence of its Shaikh. It is situated between the two other Arab capitals of 'Aj man and Dibai; about 5 miles from the former and 7 from the latter, and it is almost equidistant from the base and the extremity of the ; 0man Promontory, being a little less than 100 miles from either. Site, surroundings and defences* —The main town extends for more than a mile along the eastern shore of a small creek parallel to the sea, while a detached quarter called Laiyah stands on the western shore of the same. The low sandspit which forms the bank of the creek on the seaward side is long and narrow. The entrance of the creek is on the coast about a mile north-east of the middle of Sharjah town and there are only 1 or 2 feet of water on the bar at low tide : the foot of it adjoins the creek on which Khan village stands, and boats can pass from the one to the other at very high tides. At the south end of the town is rocky rising ground 30 or 40 feet high, forming a bluff to the south. The country inland is a desert of white sand with sparse date groves which are separated from the town by a short interval. 5 P'1762 SHARJAH TOWN Water ib from wells and is moderately good. There is now no town wall • and the fortified residence of the Shaikh and a series of mud towers which command the plain between the town and the date planta tions constitute at the present time the sole defences. Quarters and inhabitants* —The only divisions of the town are the main town or Sharjah Proper and the quarter of Laiyah, already men' tioned^ which stands on the sandspit outside the creek, near its south west end where the Sharjah and Khan creeks unite. There was formerly another detached quarter called Mbaraz to the north of the town, but it is now incorporated. Good masonry buildings are numerous, but the bulk of the town consists of date-branch huts: the streets are a labyrinth of narrow, crooked lanes winding between the date-mat walls of the courtyards. The population of Sharjah is about 15,000 souls. The principal tribes are, in Sharjah Town Proper, Shwaihiyin (400 houses); Huwalah and Sudan (300 houses each); A1 'All, il Bu Mahair,'Abadilah and Matarish (200 houses each); and Na^im of the A1 Bu Shamis division (100 houses) j besides about 700 houses of mixed tribes, mostly Arab and known collectively as Harat-as-Suq Laiyah consists of 200 houses of Marar and 100 of Sudan. The ruling family alone are of the Qawasim tribe. There is also a large negro community, many of whom still speak their original Swahili tongue. About 51 Hindus and 158 Muhammadan Indians, British subjects, are permanently settled here; the figures given for both communities include a number of women and children. The Muhammadans are Khojahs. All the Arab tribes inhabiting Sharjah belong to the Ghafiri faction, and nearly the whole of the people are Wahhabis calling themselves Hanbali Sunnis : exceptions are the Marar who are Malikis and some of the Sudan who are Shafi^is. The open sale of tobacco is still prohi bited, but it is freely bought and sold in private houses. The mosques number 21, of which 2 are Jami^s. Trade, manufactures and shipping. — There are 4 or 5 shops in and Sharjah Proper contains a bazaar of about 200 shops, and an equal number of warehouses in which most of the merchandise of the place, such as wheat, rice and dates, is deposited. Hindu merchants number 16, but their number increases in the pearling season. There are 85 Khojah traders; and about 14 'Khojah women, mostly widows, deal in gold lace ; etc...1 &gt; . ... SHBSHpi? - - sill'!' SHAUQlYAH • 'Abas are manufactured of fine sheep's wool. To Sharjah Proper belong five Baghlahs and 13 Sambuks ranning to Basrah, the Persian Coast, Bombay and occasionally Yaman, also 183 pearl boats and a similar number of fishing boats. Some 5 or 6 large boats are built locally every year. Agricultural The date plantations of Sharjah include about 3,600 trees, and the livestock of the place are some 500 camels, 550 donkeys, 180 cattle and 2,200 sheep and goats. The Shaikh and his relations have 22 horses. An important inland district of the 'Oman Sultanate, at present difficult of access to Europeans on account of the political disaffection towards the Sultan which prevails there. Boundaries and —Sharqiyah is bounded on the north and east by the hills of Eastern Hajar; at its south-east corner it meets the district of Ja'alan; on the south it merges in the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert; on the west it is conterminous with the district of 'Oman Proper. By some authorities Ja'alan is regarded as a part of Sharqiyah, but it seems preferable to treat it as a separate district. The divisions of SharqTyah, Ja'alan being excluded, are, in order from south-east to north-west, Badiyah, Baldan-al-Hirth , Baldan-al- Masakirah a/lwjl ^ and Baldan-al-Habus ^ also a small tract called Maghsat of which the position is uncertain but appears to be south-south-east of Baldan-al-Habus. Natural character* —The Badiyah division resembles Ja'alan in being an open sandy plain; the other divisions consist of a net work of small valleys adjoining the hills of Hajar. Nowhere is there natural wood of any size. A few miles from Wasil, on the way to Ibra, are low limestone hills rising about 150 feet above the plain. Further to the west, between Ibra and Samad, the country is described as consisting of valleys and plains sprinkled with grassy knolls or scrub jungle, among which are interspersed small limestone hills of pyramidal form and rugged outline, devoid of vegetation. A line of drainage, called in its upper course Wadi Ibra and in its lower Wadi-al-Haimah , is said to traverse Sharqiyah from Ibra to Wafi in Ja'alan and thence to run .to the sea. * 3Por authorities and maps, see footnote to article 'Oman Sultanate. 5 U 3SHARQITAH I?6S Name.

The Bedouins of Sharqiyah belong chiefly to the Al Wahibah and Jannabah tribes, but some of them are 'Awamir, HabuS; Hirth and Dawakah. Their total number cannot be stated. Agriculture. —In Sharqiyah there are few wells and nearly all irriga tion is from springs. All the permanent settlements have date-groves of their own j and quinces^ limes, mangoes, olives, plantains and pomegranates are generally grown. Sharqiyah is the principal camel district in •'Oman.($40) SHARSAH (WADl) 1769 Singular Sharqi an Arab tribe of the ''Oman Promontory, found chiefly in the Shamailiyall tract and in Wadi Ham^ but also (in smaller numbers) in the Jiri plain, about Wadi-al -Qaliddi, and at Dibah and other places in the Ras-al -Khaimah District. In Shamailiyah they occur at Bidyah (300 houses), Dhadnah (50 houses), Fujairah (150 houses), Ghallah (70 houses), Gharaifah (50 houses), Gharfah (100 houses), Marbah (100 houses), Qaraiyah (100 houses), Qidfa^ (100 houses), the two Ruls (80 houses), Saqamqam (30 houses), Sharam (40 houses), and Sufad (15 houses)—total 1,185 houses; in Wadi Ham at Bilaidah (4 houses), Bithnah (50 houses), Khalaibiyah (15 houses), Man amah (7 or 8 houses), Masafi (25 houses) and Taiyibah (25 houses)—total about 125 houses; in Jiri at Habhab (35 houses) and Khatt (30 to 35 houses)—total about 70 houses; in Wadi-al -Qaliddi at Muhtarqah ; and in the Ras-al -Khaimah District at Shariyah (10 houses), 'Wamm (30 houses), and Dibah (10 houses)—total 50 houses. The total number of the Sharqiyin thus appears to be about 7,000 souls. Th^ most important section are the H afaitat to which belong the well known Shaikh of Fujairah and most of the people of that village, as well as the Sharqi inhabitants of Manamah and Masafi in W adi Ham and of Sufad in Shamailiyah. The Sharqiyin of Muhtarqah and Shariyah belong to a section called Yamamahah (singular Yammahi m and those of Wamm are Hamudiym According to some (possibly interested) authorities, the Jalajilah, Maharizah and Zahum are also sections of the Sharqiyln; but, the evidence on this point not being conclusive, they have been treated in the present Gazetteer as independent tribes of Trucial 'Oman. The Sharqiyin reside, without exception, in the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Sharjah j but about half of those in the Shamailiyah tract have succeeded, under the leadership of the Shaikh of Fujairah^ in casting off—temporarily at least—the yoke of Sharjah. Their independence has not, however, been recognised by the British Government. SHAEQI- TIN A valley in the Dhahirah district of the ' Oman Sultanate, joining SHAESAH Wadi Sanaisal from the east between Dariz and Bait-al-'Ainain. It ... » contains the villages of Bat above and Wahrah further down. Bat obis a walled village of about 180 houses of MaqaM who possess 30 camelsj 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 sheep and goats; Wahrah has 100 houses of the Miyayihah tribe who cultivate wheat, indigo, sugarcane,mo SHA&amp;SA# (WADI) jowari, lucerne ; dates, mangoes, plantains and limes, besides owning 15 camels, 25 donkeys, 20 cattle and 300 slieep and goats. There are wells at both villages. The settled population of the valley is about 1,400 souls. S^ATAIT The Karun river is known by this name between Shushtar Town or an(i Band-i-Qir, the stage in which it suffers temporary diminution AB-I- through part of its waters taking the alternative channel of the Gargar SHATAIT lajkk£ «^j| General description. —The stream of the Shatait is much wider than that of the Gargar, attaining a maximum breadth of 250 yards at a point about 16 miles by land above Band-i-Qir. At and for some distance below Shushtar Town the bed is stony and the stream swift, but the latter is usually shallow enough to be fordable at a point IJ miles below the town ; at its junction with the Gargar and Diz the Shatait is still 150 yards wide. Its colour when in flood is a greyish- green, and it is slower to show discoloration than either the Gargar or the Diz I it carries less silt than either the Gargar, the Diz, or the lower Karun. The lower half of the Shatait is more winding than the upper, and even when the.water is high the current is less rapid below Chahar- dingeh than it is above. At two places in its course, 6 to 10 mile^ above ''Arab Hasan, the river impinges against hillocky clay grounxf on its right bank^ but rocks are nowhere seen; the upper of the raised tracts is about f of a mile, the lower about \ a mile long, and they are separated by an interval of about 2| miles. Below ; Arab Hasan there is a good deal of small scrub on the banks, especially on the right bank. Public works and irrigation. —At Shushtar Town a canal called the Minau, fed by the Shatait but described in the article on Shushtar, has its head. About 500 yards below the Qal'eh of Shushtar the Shatait is crossed by a dam, the Band-i-Mizan supporting a bridge which is known as the Pul-i-Dizfulfrom its carrying, when in repair, the Dizful road.* The original height of the dam above low water appears to have been 9 feet, and the rise of the river at this place seems to be from 10 to 14 feet above the lowest level. The bridge winds irregularly, and when * The name Pul-i-Qaisar is no longer in use. The term Band-i-Mirza is occasionally perhaps applied to this dam (as also to the upper barrage on the Gargar) on account of its having been repaired by Muhammad 'Ali Mirza.SHATAIT RIVER complete it Lad 41 arches and was 570 yards long' with a cobble-paved road-way 21 feet wide. In 1905 there were still 28 arches standing on the left bank and 8 upon the rights but these were divided by a breach about 170 feet long through which the mainstream of the river poured, the dam at this point having given way as well as the bridge. The materials and construction of the dam are superior to those of the bridge, and it was formerly a magnificent work, but the greater part of it has now been either broken up or removed in the course of endeavours to repair the bridge.* The Shatait is not at present applied to irrigation. Navigation. —When steam navigation was introduced on the Karun, the u Shushan/^ still in use, a stern-wheeler 100 feet long with a beam of 23 and an ordinary draft of 2J feet, ran for more than a year upon the Shatait, instead of upon the (Jargar as at present, it being at that time believed that in the low season the channel of the Gargar might become impassable. It was found that the Shatait could not be navigated with safety by a vessel of the ' Shushan^s ^ dimensions above Chahar- dingeh, a point 12 miles distant by land from Shushtar Town, on account of the intricacy and number of the channels and of the shingly nature of the bed which prevented the use of anchors for getting off when aground. Below Chahardingeh, which from the end of 1890 to the beginning of 1892 was the ' Shushan^s 93 regular terminus, the only serious obstacle was a double reef of rocks, not far from Band-i -Qir, with a narrow channel through which the water raced violently : the difficulty of the reef was at times increased by the formation of sandbanks below it* It was found that, owing to want of water, the passage of the reef was uncertain in August and September, dangerous in October, and impossible in November; but the level of the river did not vary regularly with the season. Once the ' Shushan ' crossed the reef when there was only 21 feet of water on it; in this case she was slacked over with lines, sheering about very much in the strong water, and took the ground twice in the operation, Native craft prefer the Gargar to the Shatait; The descent of .the Shatait on a skin-raft from Shushtar to Band-i-Qir occupies nearly 17 hours even with a high river. # The dam, in ancient times called the Shadhurwan, is a very old construction, and according to Persian historians it was designed the Eoman Emperor Valerian during his captivity with the Sassanians, which began in 260 A. D» In the 10th century A. D., however, the only bridge appears to have been a bridge of boats. Vide Le Strange. A notice of the bridge In its present condition will be found in the Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1904.1772 SHATAIT RIVER Villages—Tlxe following are the villages upon the Shatait; none of them are more than about a mile from the river :— Name.

A division of the 'Amarah Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat_in Turkish SHATEAT 5Ir5q - 'AMIRAH Position and houndaries, —The Qadba of Shatrat-al-'Amarah is situated on the river Tigris; it begins a short way below 'Amarah1774 SHATRAT-AL-'AMARAH Town and ends some distance above Qurnah. It is bounded on the north by the ^Amarah Qadha^ on the east by the Persian frontier, on the south by the Qadha of Qurnah, and on the west by that of Shatrat- al-Muntafik. Topography and inhabitants, —The only place of size in the Qadha is the administrative capital, QaFat Salih, which is described elsewhere under its own name; another place well known in spite of its small size is 'Azair or the Tomb of Ezra. The Tigris river and the marshes formed by the Jahalah canal in its lower course are the only physical features of importance. The country at large is inhabited by the A1 Bu Muhammad tribe. Population, —The fixed population of the district is about 45,000 souls, of whom nearly 43,000 are Shi^ah Muhammadans. The balance consists of about 1 ,500 Sunni Muhammadjans^ some Sabians and about 50 Jews ; almost all of these live in the town of Qal^at Salih. Resources. —The district as a whole is wet and marshy, and rice, maize, millet and sesame are among the chief crops. Buffaloes are the most valuable kind of livestock and exist in enormous numbers,'beinor J o bred by the A1 Bu Muhammad for exportation. Fish and feathered game abound in the marshes. There are two salt fields in this Qadha, Abu Eubah ^ yl and Bani Malik, but the produce at least of the latter is inferior. Administration. —Shatrat-al-'Amarah as a Qadha has no administra tive subdivisions. SHATRAT- A division of the Muntafik Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish MUN- ,Ir ^- TAFIK ..... .. „ Position and loundaries, — This Qadha is situated on both sides of l J ^ the Shatt-al -Gharaf in its lower middle course and appears to be enclosed QADHA between the Qadhas of Hai on the north, Shatrat-aVAmarah —or possibly Suq-ash-Shuyukh— on the east, Nasiriyah on the south, and either Samawah or Diwaniyah on the west. Topography and inhabitants. —The only considerable place in the Qadha is the town of Shatrat-al-Muntafik, and except the Shatt-al- Gharaf there is no salient physical feature.SHATRAT-AL-MU NTAFIK TOWN 1776 Vovulation,—fixed population of the district is estimated at 65;000 souls ; all Shi^ah Arabs 'with the exception of some Sunni Muhammadans and Sabians and a few Jews ; who are settled in the chief and only town. Resources. There is nothing remarkable about the agriculture or livestock of this Qadha. AdministTa$ivn.~-~ The Qadha is subdivided into 4 Nahiyahs, namely, that of the Markaz or headquarters and those of Bada^ah Dajjah and Shatt-al-Kar : the last named is at the western end of the district, while Bada^ah is apparently on the eastern branch of the Shatt- al -Grharaf, not very far from the town of Shatrat-al-Muntafik on the western branch. The Dairat-as-Saniyah have land in the Qadha and are represented by a Mamur in the chief town. Frequently called ' Shatrah ' only, but confusion with Qal'at Salih, SIIA TIIAT- of which the official name is Shatrat-al-'Amarah, should be avoided ; it is a municipality and country town in Turkish Iraq near the right bank ^ of the western branch of the Shatt-al -Gharaf about 20 miles above the TOW]/ ^ junction of that stream with the Euphrates near Nasiriyah Town. The inhabitants of Shatrah number about 4^000 souls and are nearly all Shi'ah Arabs ; but there are a small Jewish community, who maintain a primary -school taught by a Rabbi, and some Sabians, the latter as usual mostly goldsmiths. The bazaar contains about 300 shops and is much resorted to by the surrounding JTuntafik Arabs, but there is not much trade with distant places. In summer, when the Shatt-al- Gharaf ceases to flow, the inhabitants of Shatrah obtain water for drinking and irrigation from wells which they dig in the dry bed of the stream. Shatrat-al-Muntafik is the headquarters of a Qadha, similarly named, in the Sanjaq of Muntafik, and is the residence of the ordinary Qadha officials and of a Mamur of the Public Debt and Civil List departments. A harbour master for the Shatt-al-Gharaf is common to this place and Hai. There are about 50 Dhabitiyahs, mostly mounted, under a Tabur Aghasi. The military garrison consists of 1 battalion of infantry and 2 guns. The ancient site of Talluh lies about 8 miles to the north-east of Shatrah.1776 SHATtFT SHAT^T An ^ rr ^ ate&lt; ^ tract Fallahiyeh District of Southern 'Arabistan, J^k&lt;i reaching on the east to Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan, which is about 20 miles west-north-west of Ma'shur, and on the south almost to Khor Doraq ; on the west it falls short of Buziyeh and on the north it does not extend to the left bank of the Jarrahi River, though it approaches within about 4 miles of it at Qarakhan. From north to south Shatut measures about 8 miles. The tract is irrigated by a num ber of distributaries of which it is difficult, without the aid of a survey, to establish the relative positions or direction of flow : they are, with two exceptions, fed by the canal variously known as Shakhat-as-Saiyid Fakhar, Qahan or Sharukhiyeh, which leaves the Jarrahi River a little below Gharaibeh and is mentioned in the table of canals in the Fallahiyeh district. The following are the principal distributaries in Shatut:—' Name. Occupiers. Number of Faddans irrigated. Eemaeks. Khatar Ka'ab of the ll Bu Ghu- baish subdivision, whose Shaikh is Rizaij.

The distributaries in Shatut are empty in the dry season, but wells in their beds still supply drinking water. On each distributary there is a settlement of the same name, which consists of reed huts and is at least partially inhabited throughout the year, The crops grown are wheat, barley and onions. o x1778 SHATYAR SHATVAR A small and low islet, 1 mile long from east to west and | a mile in Jg jb^ breadth, off the eastern point of Shaikh Shl^alb island, from which it is separated by a strait less than a mile wide with 3 fathoms of water . i 'I d ffli in the passage. Shatvar is politically a dependency of Mugam, but it i is uninhabited and visited only for fishing and for pearling upon a bank which adjoins its western extremity. SHAUR ;) u EIVEE This river rises from springs in the plain between the rivers Diz and Karkheh at a point opposite Aiwan-i- K arkheh : it flows to the south- south-east, and throughout its course of about 60 miles (bends being neglected) it is roughly parallel to the Karkheh and never many miles distant from it. Some 12 miles below its source the Shaur washes the western foot of the ruins of Shush, and it ultimately joins the Diz by two branches which separate at Hawasiyeh and enter the larger river at 88 and 26 miles respectively by water above Band-i-Qir ;* the former of these branches is named the Sharish and the latter the Kharur ; both contain water at all seasons of the year, but the Kharur is the more important. It is believed that the Shaur originally flowed into the Karun, at one time near Wais and at a later period near Ahwaz, and some hold that it was originally an artificial canal from the Karkheh ; it is stated in support of this view that in one place it passes through a ridge of low hills by an obviously artificial cutting. The stream of the Shaur is winding, deep and sluggish, with a fairly uniform width of 25 to 30 yards; there are fords at frequent intervals; the bed and banks are of soft alluvial soil. The banks are clothed in spring with luxuriant herbage ; in the upper reaches they are lined with thorn trees and in the lower with tamarisk jungle. The river is largely drawn on for irrigation and at the low season its waters are practically exhausted in this manner. The lands which adjoin its course are fertile; in some places the stream forms marshes, which are tenanted by pastoral Arabs and cultivated with rice. The principal canals which leave the Shaur on its left bank are, in descending order, the following: the Khairabad ) the Taraifi , the Qumat -kU* , the Ishareh u» (near Jajis on the Diz) and the Hawasiyeh ; of these the Taraifi and the Hawasiyeh benefit the 'Anafij eh tribe and the re- jjcoa U is s: Us of 1 llmife jisteat' itkofl '■its, T Iplk [ iioimdi iity if Tin ol if llli ce ijiiomii ft-Tk bi-we itaice \ ma itssa an mainder water the lands of the Bait Sa'ad.

The range throughout is composed of masses of limestone tfcli which have a quaquaversal dip and rise in places to as much as jiudii 5^,000 feet above sea-level; its mojt general name is Jabal Sat-heh |ilile The principal summits are Jabal Siri 4 miles inland 3 comin from Miyalu, height 4,660 feet; Sir-i-Yalfal J a I j 6 miles inland jj^ej from Nakhl Taqi and 4 ; 870 feet high; and Jabal Turanjeh ^ 0 {, 20 miles inland from Gurzeh, elevation 5,150 feet. We may here notice that a great trough, co-extensive with the portion of the maritime range just described, adjoins the range on its j^tot] inland side and is divided into two parts by a wa,tershed which is behind Tahiri on the coast. Portions of this great valley are still un- ^ ^ surveyed ; but the part of it to the north-west of the watershed, con- |yj ^ taining the small district of Jam ^ about 10 miles north of TaMri, seems to drain to the upper course of the Mund river, while the major or south-western part runs straight in the opposite direction to Clarence Strait, the channel between Qishm Island and the main. The valley contains 3 places of some importance whose trade with the outer world ^ ^ is conducted through Shlbktill ports ; they are Galehdar , 8 miles from the sea at a point rather nearer to 'Asalu than to Tahiri; Tarakameh 20 miles inland from Shivnh ; and Ishkani , 22 miles from the coast at Mugam. It remains to describe the sub-features of the Shibkuh tract between the main range and the Persian Gulf. in J From Kangun as far as'Asalu, a little over 40 miles, the main te S e( range immediately adjoins the coast and presents to it a face appar- ■ some ently precipitous, on which however the fires of charcoal burners are 31 ^ seen to twinkle at night. Immediately below 'Asalu is Naband bay, ^ tli and from there to another but less pronounced bay at Mug am,—a i| dig llfeet, 'fflst of ( siitlecoSHlBKtTH 1781 distaiiee of about 60 miles,—the coast lies parallel to the foot of the main range at about 20 miles from it, the intervening space being % . occupied by the Gabandi valley which begins immediately inland of ijsumi]; Shivuh and, skirting* the foot of the main range^ reaches the sea at the foot of Naband bay. The Gabandi valley is separated from the coast by a sandstone ridge^ called Shahin Kuh ay ^ which is 1 nowhere more than a mile or two from the shore and in the neighbour- hood of Shivuh attains its maximum height of 1 ; 100 feet. This ridge t jj ; ^ continues along the coast to Mugam, when ; the littoral making a fresh ^, echelon seawards ; it is left at some distance inland and almost immediately ^ ^ terminates about 16 miles due east of Mugam. Between Shivuh and Mugam, rather nearer to the latter, is a gap in the sandstone ridge j llai through which a small valley, called Darveh Asuh, comes down to ^ Z the sea in a direction perpendicular to the coast: this valley has two WbSiJ the interior which unite at about 10 miles from the sea, one - 0 f them coming from the west from a point near the bead of the L ' X W L Gabandi valley and the other from the east, from a watershed on the Jialt. 0 ^j ier 0 f w hich a valley called Hamiru ; a tributary of the ^ Mugam valley, has its origin. The Hamiru valley from its source at , co-ffikk {i rs t runs eastwards, then bends southwards round the end of the sand- ijoilf stone ridge;to the east of Mugam, and joins the Mugam valley which, anfeS with a course of 30 or 35 miles from east to west, reaches the sea at Mugam by an opening between two parallel raoges similar to that of oifcrf the Gabandi valley at Naband. The southern of the two parallel Jes iiiiiit ranges in this case is another ridge of sandstone which extends from Kas Naband for 50 miles to Charak, where it ends, closely adjoining the shore throughout its length ; between Chiru and Charak it has an [jjii,! elevation of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The greater part of the interval to the north of this ridge between it and the great maritime range is occupied by the Mugam valley and by the turn of the Hamiru valley already described; but the remainder consists of the basin of the Gulshan valley, which has its mouth on the coast less than a mile to the east of Charak. Beyond Charak a gap about 5 miles in width occurs in the coast ridge and a plain called Tank Khum ^ e] tends from the edge of the sea to the main range, here 15 miles inland, Iroken only by some dark-coloured detached hills between 1,000 and ^OOO t feet high. Between this gap and Mughu, the last of the Slibkuh If ports in this direction, the detached hill Kuh Namaki ^ (in the I Admiralty Chart called Jabal Yarid) rises close to the sea to an elevation ^ } tlf of 1,200 feet. l;i (1782 SHlBKtJH The strata o£ the sandstone ridges which skirt the sea below Ras Naband dip toward the coast, and it appears not improbable that the ridges themselves have been formed by the gradual elevation of the great inner limestone range through a bed of superincumbent light- coloured sandstone. It is worthy of remark that, while the limestone range gives birth to many fresh springs and streams and is clad, though sparsely, with almond, dwarf-oak, hawthorn, rose and terebinth, the sandstone ridges produce hardly a shrub or a grass and the streams that spring from them are generally brackish. The actual coast of the Shibkuh district possesses no remarkable features, unless we reckon the islands of Shaikh Shu^aib, Shatvar, Hindarabi, Qais, Farur and Nabiyu Farur. Dangers of navigation, apart from these conspicuous islands, are few ; and north of Shivuh the tide-stream is either faint or imperceptible. Population.—HkQ number of houses in the Shibkuh district—the valleys of Gabandi, Darveh Asuh and Gulshan in the interior being included—appears to be about 8,500, indicating a population of about 42,500 souls ; but at the present time; in consequence of recent emigra- tion, there is at most places a considerable proportion of unoccupied houses. Persians of unmixed descent are few in the district, and such as are found are mostly settlers from Lar and other Persian districts; the bulk of the people are of mingled Persian and Arab blood and the tribes to which they belong are of no consequence. Local patriotism is however strong among those who are subjects of the same chief, a bond which is here regarded almost as one of clanship. The following Arab tribes are deserving of notice :— Name.

English, and that of length a Gaz or double Zara' of 38 inches.

Routes and tfausport. —A route presenting no special difficulties follows the sea-coast from Kangtin to Naband bay, from the foot of which it runs up the Gabandi valley, traverses the upper basins of the Asuh and Gulshan valleys and passes across the swampy plain of the Lingeh District to Lingeh Town. * There is a land route along the coast from Charak via Mughu to Lingeh Town; one from Charak inland to Bastak and so to Lar; and a third, crossing the last, from Mughu to Lar.f The coast route is fit for all arms. Transport resources can be gauged from the topographical table in this article and in the connected articles on the Gabandi valley, etc. Administration. —The following table explains the organisation of the Shibkuh district, for administrative and revenue purposes, as it stood at the end of 1906 : — £ Groups of villages. Province to which attached. Villages of th( group. 1. Kangun Fars. Banak, Kangun, Miyalu, 'Ayanat and Akhtar on the coast. Local authority and revenue. In 1905 this group was farmed by the present Khan of Dashti for 1,800 Tumans a year and was sublet by him to his cousin Ahmad for 1,500 Tumans a year. In 1906, the sea customs of this and of the Tahiri and 'Asalu-Naband groups, which also lie held, were transferred from the Khan to the Imperial Persian Customs, from whom ha receives an al lowance of 2.300 Tumans * It was travelled by Colvill in 1865-66 ; vide his report forwarded to the Govern^ ment of Bombay by the Resident in the Persian Gulf with his letter No. 46 of 4th May 1866.

The Khan apparently con tinues to collect the other revenues of the 2 first- named groups, but it does not appear that he now pays^ anything to the Persian Government. The total revenue formerly derived by the Khan from the 3 groups was 8,000 Tumans a year, of which 4,910 Tumans went to the Persian Government and the rest was retained by the Khan. 2. Tahiri Fars. Bagh-i-Shaikh, Tah iri, Barak and Ras- ash-Shajar on the coast. In 1904 the Khan of Dashti succeeded in expelling Shaikh Sulai- manj Nasuri, nephew of the Nasuri Shaikh of Ga- bandi, from TaMri; and the group was there after farmed by him for 1,900 Tumans a year. The subsequent arrangements of 1906 are described under the Kangun group above. 3. 'Asalu-Na- band Gulf Ports. Nakhl Taqi 'AsalU Baidhah Khan, Halat Naband, Na- band, Barku, fias Ghurab, Ghaf, Khuvadao, Tibin and 'Amaiiyeh on the coast. Up to 1905 the villages of the group, except Eas Ghurab, Ghaf and Khuva- dan, were subject to Shaikh Ahmad-bin-Saif, Harami, of 'Asalu, under the Khan of Dash ti who held them in farm ; and Eas Ghurab, Ghaf and Khuvadan were controlled bv the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandi. In 1906, the whole group was transferred from the juiisdiction of JJ 'ars, in which it had formerly lain, to that of the Gulf Ports ; and the Tamimi Shaikh of Gabandi was at the same time placed in charge, superseding the previous holders.

It is not clear whether after 1906 the Shaikh of Dashti preserved any interest in this group. The present annual revenue of this group is indicated in the remarks upon the next The following places upon the coast : Dastur, Kharaheh, Bustanu, Buraghleh, Ziyarat, Kalatu, Shivuh and Saif- ash- Shaikh; also the Harami, Maliki, Nasuri and Tamimi villages of the Ga- bandi valley and the villages of Darveh Asuh, The following places upon the coast: Mugam, Nakhilu, Jazeh and Makahil; also the villages of Mugam valley. This entire group was, before 1906, subject to the Nasuri Shaikh of Ga- bandi, who paid 12,000 Tumans per annum as revenue for the whole ; but in the year mentioned the Harami, Maliki and Tamimi villages of the Gabandi valley were transferred to the Tamimi Shaikh of Gabandi on condition of his paying 3,560 Tumans a year to the Imperial Persian Customs for the Harami villages of this and the preceding group, and 5,000 Tumans a year to the Governor of Bastak for the Maliki and Ta mimi villages of the Gabandi valley. The annual revenue of the Nasuri Shaikh of Ga bandi was at the same time reduced to 7,000 Tumans a year for the Nasuri villages of the Gabandi valley^ the villages of Darveh Asuh, and the places upon the coast.

Kalat and Gurzeh on the coast and the islands of Shaikh Shu'alb and Shatvar. This group is held by the Hamadi Shaikh of Mugam, who also holds the Mugam group above. The revenue of the Kalat group separately is 1,400 Tumans a year, and the Hamadi Shaikh is re presented on the spot by his younger brother Ibrahim-bin-'Abdul lab. It should be observed that the Qawami family of Shiiaz claim Shaikh Shu'aib island as their property, but nothing is known of their relations in this connection with the Hamadi Shaikh. 8. Charak Do. 1 Tavuneh and Cha rak on the coast ; Qais island ; the villages of the Gulshan valley, except Gnlshan ; Bavirduo ; and part of Duvvan in the Lingeh District. This groupjs under the All 'Ali Shaikh of Charak ; the annual revenue for which he is responsible being 1,600 Tumans. The headman, however, of the Bushri section of the A1 'Ali at present holds Tavuneh on the coast and Nakhl-i-Mir in the Gulshan valley and de fies the authority of the Shaikh of Charak. 9. Mughu Do. Hasineh and Mu- ghu on the coast; Farur island; Kundarun; and part of Bustaneh in the Lingeh District. This group is subject to the Marzuqi Shaikh of Mughu, the annual revenue payable by whom on that account is 1,000 Tumans. From this table it will be apparent that at the end of 1906 the great bulk of the district was still subject to the Governor-General of FaiSj but that a curious exception existed in the 'Asalu-Naband grouphi SHlBKtTH 1789 of villages which had recently been transferred to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The prime movers in the transfer were the Customs Department, who had more influence at Bushehr than at Shiraz and were consequently desirous that the Shibkuh ports generally should be brought under the authority of the Governor. The two groups of villages to the north of 'Asalu were, it will be seen, managed in 1906 by the Khan of Dashti, whose hereditary dominions they adjoin ; and the remainder of the coast with its islands was parcelled out among various Arab Shaikhs, namely, the Tamimi Shaikh (then Saqar-bin-Mubarak) with headquarters at Chah Mubarak in the Gabandi valley; the Nasuri Shaikh (then Hasan-bin-Mazkur) residing at Gabandi village in the Gabandi valley ; the Hamadi Shaikh (then Ahmad-bin-'Abdullah) with his seat at Mugam; the 'Obaidli Shaikh (then 'Abdullah-bin-Muhammad 'Abdur Kasul) of Chim j the Al 'Ali Shaikh (then Salih-bin-Muhammad) of Charak, and his rival Muhammad-bin-Rahmah, Bushri headman, residing at Nakhl-i-Mir in the Gulshan valley; and, finally, the Marzuqi Shaikh (then Ahmah-bin- Rashid) of Mughu. In 1907 the situation in groups Nos. 3 and 4 above was modified by the assassination, in March 1907, of the Tamimi Shaikh Saqar along with his son Mubarak, against whom the Harami and Nasuri Shaikhs, although at enmity between themselves, formed a coalition. The head of the Harami family at the time of this incident was in consequence of the death of Shaikh Ahmad-bin-Saif, who formerly held part of group No. 3, a certain Muhammad-bin-Ahmad, his nephew, then residing at Sarvbash in the Gabandi valley. Shaikh Sulaiman, Nasuri, who at one time controlled group No. 2 in opposition to the Khan of Dashti, was also dead by the end of 1907. The administrative consequences of the murder of the Tamimi Shaikh have not as yet fully declared themselves. Up to the present time the local influence of the hereditary Shaikhs has been sufficient, except in the instance of the 3rd and 4th groups above, to restrain outsiders from attempting to farm the revenues of their villages, which the Persian Government would otherwise have no hesi tation in handing over to the highest bidders; and the failure of the recent experiment at 'Asalu and Nab and may now for some time deter the Persian Government, who had hitherto interfered but little in local affairs, from endeavours to assert their authority over these semi-inde pendent chiefs. The jurisdiction of a revenue farmer being very similar in character to that of a hereditary Shaikh as described below, a conflict I in imo SHIBK tTH would necessarily ensue from the introduction of the former in a place where the latter already existed. Although the conduct of the Shaikhs towards their own people is often, if not generally, characterised by violent and extortionate proceedings, they enjoy the full sympathy and support of their subjects in every effort to maintain local independence against the encroachments of the Persian Government; and for this purpose also the Shaikhs, though ordinarily at feud with one another, are able to combine among themselves for joint action, as instanced lately in the removal of the intruding Tamimi Shaikh. Each hereditary local Shaikh at present exercises considerable powers in his own district. He settles all civil disputes—except such as are of a religious or semi-religious character, for example matrimonial cases — ac cording to his own idea of what is right and proper ; he disposes of all criminal matters, inflicting at his discretion imprisonment and the bastinado, but not the penalty of death ; and without his permission no stranger dare engage in pearl diving in his territorial waters. As a rule he is also, as we have already seen, the exclusive revenue farmer of his own territories ; and the system in this respect does not seem likely to be permanently altered at any very near date. The revenue of the Shibkuh district after the reorganisation of 1906 appears to have stood, nominally, at 21,960 Tumans a year, payable as below:— By the Khan of Dashti . . . .Nil. By the Tamimi Shaikh By the Nasuri Shaikh By the Hamadi Shaikh By the 'Obaidli Shaikh By the A1 'Ali Shaikh By the Marzuqi Shaikh In some instances however, it is believed, the demand is not and cannot be recovered in full from the local authorities.

A TT5j&lt; or, more pedantically, Shifatiyah : a fruitful palm oasis and .... ... thickly inhabited settlement on the border between Turkish ; Iraq and the Shamiyah Desert. Position. - Shifathah is situated nearly 40 miles to the west of Karbala Town, from which it is separated by a barren and sandy desert. The village of Razazah apparently lies between, at about one-third of the distance from Karbala. * Authorities : Muhammad Hasan, Muhsin, Vice-Consnl at Karbala, and the Turkish Almanac.Site and character, —Sliifathah is described as occupying a site whicli is flat, but raised somewhat above the level of the neighbouring country ; the surface of the district surrounding it is said to be broken up by hollows and stony mounds. The date plantations of Shifathah extend over an area of many square miles ; and among these are scattered at intervals of half a mile to a mile apart, the 17 Qasrs or walled villacres of which the settlement consists. The 4 largest Qasrs, those of ''Ain Darawishah ^1;^, Hasawi and Al Bu Zain-ad-Din ^ contain about 200 houses each ; while the smallest, that of Mutlaq has 50 and the remainder are intermediate in size. The enclosing walls of these Qasrs are 9 to 12 feet high and about 1 foot thick : the houses within are entirely of mud and very poorly constructed. The oasis is said to be 7 or 8 miles in length and the same in breadth. 'Population. —The population of the entire settlement is estimated at 8,000 souls, nearly all of whom are Shi'ah Arabs not belonging to any of the well-known country tribes. Among them live a few Persians and Baluchis, who are Persian subjects. The nomad tribes of the vicinity are Al Shibil and the Khawadhir, who remain in the neighbourhood for so much of the year as they can obtain sufficient water and pasture for their animals. Agriculture. —The chief [ox only wealth of Shifathah consists in its date plantations, which are extensive and form a sort of forest. The number of the palms has been estimated at between 50,000 and 60,000, and the average annual yield of dates is said to amount to 4 ; 000 Taghars j of the palms only about 35,000 now bear fruit, the rest being barren or worn out. Pomegranates are the only kind of fruit produced at Shifathah besides dates. In the settlement itself there is little cultivation except of dates, but lucerne for cattle fodder and small quantities of vegetables are sometimes grown in the open spaces between the groves. A little cultivation of wheat and barley is carried on at Jultah a locality 4 miles west of Shifathah, and there is a little also at a place called Ilaudhah Irrigation. —The whole of Shifathah proper is irrigated by the water of a large and copious spring which rises inside the village of ; Ain and supplies 3 canals, each of them as large as the Hanaidiyah branch of the Husainiyah canal at Karbala Town ; and there is even a surplusSHIPATHAH 1803 wlrich escapes and is lost in the hollow containing salt that crosses the Karbala Qadha to the north-east of Shifathah. There are many other similar springs in the neighbourhood, but their flow is feeble and scanty by comparison. The cultivation at Jultah is dependent partly on local springs and partly on rain, that at Raudhah exclusively upon rain. Livestock and transport. —The animals owned in the settlement are estimated at 100 horses, 1,500 donkeys, 1,500 sheep and 500 goats: there are no buffaloes or camels. The horses are said to be good, but the other stock are not of much account. There is little communication with the outside world, and transport between Shifathah and Karbala must as a rule be specially engaged. Twice or thrice a month, as a rule, a small caravan of 15 to 20 mules and donkeys makes the journey from Karbala to Shifathah and back again. Water-supply and food. —Drinking water is obtained from the spring at Qasr-al-^Ain and from the channels which it feeds. This water, where it issues from the ground, is warm and tastes and smells of bitumen and sulphur ; when it cools it becomes inodorous ; but the flavour remains brackish, and it is said to cause indigestion. Rain water is procurable in hollows at Jultah until the end of July, when it dries up. Good water is also obtainable by digging to a very slight depth at Khaidhir or Akhaidhir , a place situated in the sandy desert about 12 miles to the south-east of Shifathah. Food, except dates, is scarce at Shifathah and is mostly imported : the inhabitants have little besides dates and barley bread. Vegetables can be had in small quantities only. Occupations and industries* —Date culture is almost the only occupa tion at Shifathah, but some of the inhabitants are engaged in the manufac ture of palm-leaf baskets and matting. Trade. —The only bazaar in the settlement is in Qasr-al-^Ain, where there are 60 shops : of these 10 are occupied by grocers, 3 by barbers, 2 by dyers, 14 by drapers, 4 by cafe keepers, 9 by grain dealers, 9 by tobacco merchants, 1 by a coppersmith, 1 by a blacksmith and 1 by a carpenter: the rest are at present empty. In each of the other Qasrs are 1 or 2 shops only, in which necessaries are sold.1S04 SHIFATHAH Trade, apart from commodities consumed in the settlement itself is small j and the demand of the settlement for goods is declining in con sequence of the misgovernment under which the place has laboured for some years. External commercial relations are with Karbala and Baghdad on the one hand and with the ^Anizah and Dilaim tribes on the other ; the tribesmen come periodically in bodies to make their purchases, bringing with them wool and skins, and the market thus formed is called the Musabalah . The annual imports and exports of Shifathah are estimated at about £19,000 each. The principal imports are piece- goods (£17 ; 500), loaf sugar (£650) and coffee (£270) ; the main exports are dates (£18,000), lambskins (£450), wool (£270) and baskets, etc. (£180). Administration. —Shifathah is the headquarters of a Nahiyah in the Karbala Qadha and as such is the seat of a Mudir, whose authority is maintained by a force of 20 Dhabitiyahs, half mounted and half unmounted. The government of the place, especially in the matter of taxation, has been reckless and shortsighted in recent years and has been a cause of impoverishment and discontent. It is reported that a numbef of cultivators have emigrated, while others have cut down their date groves and sold the wood at Karbala to avoid payment of the tax on trees. The Government revenue of Shifathah is said to amount to 10,500 Lirahs a year, of which 7,500 Lirahs are produced by the Silyan or tax on palms, 2,000 Lirahs by an Ihtisab tax, and 1,000 Lirahs by cattle and other taxes ; but more than this is collected from the people. Reliable reports have been received of the existence of ancient remains, known as Qasr-al-Akhaidhir, at the watering place already mentioned 12 miles south-east of Shifathah. They are said to be those of a vast twc-storeyed building, constructed mostly of hewn stone, facing the west, and containing some very large rooms and deep, dark cellars. Local tradition connects them with the pre-Islamic Arabian dynasty of Mundhir, and the Turkish Almanac definitely ascribes them to the 8th Niman of the kingdom of Hirah. There is now no cultivation anywhere in the neighbourhood of these ruins ; but water, as already mentioned, is obtainable by digging. To the east are other remains, and in a knoll about 4 miles distant in that direction is a cave from which a spring issues. Half way from Shifathah to Rahaliyah, to the left of the road, is a small ruined fort known as Qasr Bardawil ; it stands on a mound about 20 feet high,, from the summit of--»:'-r-- &lt; -.v , ■■■■■. — SHIHtTH 1805 which a winding passage leads down into the interior.

A peculiar tribe who inhabit the 'Oman SHIHTJH* Promontory from Bafah northwards on the eastern^ and from Khor Khuwair northwards on the western coast. The whole of the Ruus-al- Jibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate is in their occupation^ except a few villages which belong to the Dhahuriyin. They also form the population of the three northernmost places in the Sharjah Principality^ viz., Sha^am, Ghalllah and Khor Khuwair, and of the village of Hail in Sir; they are found, too, at Saham Town in Batinah. The Shihuh are divided into two main sections and various sub sections , as follows :— r 1. 'Abaid (Bani Muhammad) I. Hadiyah (Bani) • 2. 'Ali (Bani) Xc ^ 3. Ham Mazyud (Bani) •Mr* r ! .JO II.

Among the Shihuh of the coast the main distinction between Ban Hadiyah and Bani Shatair alone is regarded, and the people ordinarily classify themselves in detail by villages and not by subsections ; in the interior however the minuter classification is by subsections. * The information for this article has been obtained cliiefly from the Bani Shatair section of the tribe and di;e allowance must be made for the fact. or SHIHHI- YIN JJ^sr^ uSHIHtTH 1807 Hadiyah of the group called Habus, and tlie latter are Bani Sbatair, The Dhahuriyin of Larak island (40 houses) are closely connected with the Bani Shatair Shihuh of Kumzar.

The total number of tbe Shihuh tribe may be roughly estimated at 21,500 souls, of whom 14,500 belong to the coast and 7,000 to the interior.*' The Shihuh are almost entirely included in the dominions of the Sultan of 'Oman ; only about 2,000 of those on the coast and a few of those in the interior are resident outside the limits of the Sultanate in Trucial 'Oman. In complexion, the majority of the Shihuh are somewhat darker than the generality of Arabs. A broad distinction may be drawn between those * 1 he estimate of nomad sections is of doubtful accuracy ; it was mostly obtained from Bani Sbatair of Kumzar.SHlHtTH 1809 of the coast and those of the interior, between whom there is little inter course : and who know little of each other. The Shihuh of the littoral inhabit houses built of stones and mud ; their food consists of the fish they catch; of rice imported from the towns of Sharjah^ Qishm and Masqat, and of dates grown at Khasab or imported from Dibah or Batinah, supplemented in some places by shell-fish which they gather in the shallows. Their occupations are fishing, pearl diving on the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf in boat3 belonging to other tribes, wading for pearls on their own coasts, the culture of dates where possible, and the herding of goats ; they also keep poultry. A part of the date plant ations at Khasab and Dibah is owned by Shihuh of other places on the coast of Ruus-al-Jlbal; and in the date season the majority of the littoral Shihuh forsake their coast villages and migrate to Khasab, Dibah and Batinah, partly to escape the intolerable heat which then prevails at their homes and partly to gain a livelihood by labour in the date harvest. The Shihuh of the interior are described as Bedouins, but some of them have houses built of loose stones. Their chief wealth appears to consist in goats, of which they own large numbers, but they are said to grow the greater quantity of the grain which they require. Water they are said to obtain from natural reservoirs in the rocks which, where necessary, they have improved; they have no regular wells. They are entirely ignorant of fishing and seafaring pursuits and many of them never come down to the coast. In religion the Shihuh, both settled and nomad, are mostly ShafTis ; but from and including Sha'am and Bai'ah southwards on either side of the 'Oman Promontory they are now Hanbalis. They have, since Wahhabi times, abandoned the practice of worshipping at certain Mazars or tombs of holy men to which they were formerly wont to resort; but those in the hills have no mosques and are extremely superstitious, and the tribe as a whole are still ignorant and imperfect Muhammadans In the last cholera epidemic (1904) some of the Shihah offered sacrifices to the Jinns in the mountains and dug ditches round their villages to keep out the cholera spirits. Two languages are spoken among the Shihuh. The more general is the Shihhi dialect of Arabic; the other, which is confined to the Kumazirah subdivision of the Bani Shatair and to their Dhahuriyin relations, is heard chiefly at Kumzar and on Larak island and is an Iranian dialect. From this fact it may not unreasonably be inferred that the Shihuh are a composite tribe, essentially Arab, that has absorbed some Persian elements. 5 11810 SHIHtTH Tlie Sultan of 'Oman intervenes but little in tlie affairs of the tribe : tlie Wali wlio represents him has his seat at Khasab. The Shikuh belong to the Hinawi political faction and are now fairly well armed with modern rifles. The Dhahuriyin, whose settlements are surrounded by Shihhi country, generally follow the lead of the Shihuh in political matters, though nominally they belong to the opposite political faction : . their connection with the Shihuh appears to be chiefly through the Bard : Shatair section, only those of Maqaqah, it is said, and perhaps of Qanah and Sibi being connected with the Bani Hadiyah. The Bani Shamaili tribe of Trucial 'Oman are closely related to the Shihuh, of whom they B may almost be regarded as a section.

Half-a-mile south-east of the village is a peaked hill about 250 feet high, and a hill about 120 feet in height behind the village carries a tower ; there is also a fort in the place itself. A large, flat, black rock, projecting into the sea in front of the village, forms a small boat-harbour and is the best landing-place. The anchorage at Shivuh is said to be tolerably well sheltered, close in, from the Shamal ; but there must be a considerable swell. A moderate amount of good water is contained in wells close to the beach. Shivuh consists of about 150 stone houses and huts, partly of Arabs and partly of Persians from Lar, etc. ; the people are mostly Sunnis, and are engaged in trade, navigation and pearl-diving, but they have also some ordinary cultivation and date-gardens. Their palms are estimated at 2,000 trees and their livestock at 4 horses, 20 donkeys, 60 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. Sweet water is yielded by two wells. Shivuh is the principal port of the Gabandi valley and carries on a considerable trade with the ports of the Persian Gulf generally and also with 'Oman. There are no shops but there are several warehouses. Here are owned 15 trading Sambuks, 9 Sambuks used for pearl fishing on the west side of the Gulf, and 21 small Baqarahs and Varjis which are used for fishing and pearling upon the Persian coast. Shivuh is subject to the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandi, and the annual revenue of the place, which till lately was payable to the Khans of Lar, is now payable to the Governor of Bastak. The placQ has recently received a considerable accession toits populntion throughSHU'AIB (SHAIKH) '•It immigration from Kangim and Tahiri ; the immigrants were sympathisers with Sulaiman, the Nasuri Shaikh of Tahiri; whom the Kban of Dashti expelled by force of arms in 19U4. .J. To British navigators at one time known as ' Bnsheab.'' An island of some importance in the Persian Gulf; it subtends the coast of the Shlbkuh district, to which it is nearly parallel, from SMvuh in the west to Nakhilu in the east at a mean distance of about 14 miles^ but at the east end a curve in the coast line brings it within 5 miles of the island. The length of the island from west to east is almost 15, and its breadth nearly 3 miles. It is of brown colour and level outline, rising to a height of 120 feet in the centre and having alow plain 1 to 2 miles m extent at either extremity ; the greater part is nearly destitute ot vegetation. The coast of the island all round consists chiefly of low cliff with sandy points and bights In places ; the anchorages off the coast are sheltered from one direction only j pearl banks are found upon the whole circumference except at one part on the north side near the east end of the island.

A very SHUIIA- small island, not rising more than 40 feet above the sea, situated in AW All the bay between Abu Dhabi and Qatar about 34 miles north by west of Dalrnah. Its political position appears to be indeterminate, resemb ling that of Halul island. In the neighbourhood are two pearl banks, viz., Tubabat Shura'awah about 5 miles to the north, and Qarn-al- 'Ashairiq about 6 miles to the north-west. The site and ruins of the ancient palace and citadel of Susa, on the SHUSH left bank of the Shaur stream, 15 miles south-west of Dizful Town. The uV' city of Susa extended from the right bank of the Shaur to the river Karkheh, U miles distant, and beyond it. The remains upon the left bank of the Shaur occupy a space over 6 miles in circumference and consist of three concentric tiers : the second of these, representing the palace and its enclosure, is still 72 feet high with a perimeter of 2 2 miles j the tipperinost or citadel, still known as Qal'eh Shush, is 120 feet in height and measures 1,100 yards round the base and 850 yards round the summit.* Below the chief mound of Shush, with the Shaur running immediately below its walls, is the reputed tomb of the prophet Daniel JWb, the custody of which affords a livelihood to a Saiyid. The shrine is admittedly empty, and the guardians maintain that the coffin, made of glass and containing records as well as the body of the prophet, is buried beneatJi the waters of the river ; they trust to the uncertainty regarding the exact spot to protect the remains from the sacrilegious curiosity of the European * A French Archaeological Mission under M. De Morgan has for some years been engaged in excavations here, and the proportions of the citadel have now been reduced to less than the dimensions stated in the test, The Mission occupj a sort of castle which they have themselves constructed. A plan of the rules, as they were and a sketch of the tomb of Daniel will be foafid in Loftus's1816 SHtTSH archseoiogist. The shrine is much resorted to by pilgrims from the towns of Dizful and Shushta^ and it is naturally held in high veneration by the Jews, who admit its authenticity. 'When the country between is quiet it is occasionally visited by Jewish pilgrims from 'Amarah on the Tigris. In the 10th century A. D. Shush was a populous town, and the district in which it stood was celebrated for its raw silk and sugarcane, both of which were then important products of 'Arabistan. To the mediaeval Arab geographers the place was known as Sus SHtJSHTAIl A district of Persia, forming with the districts of Dizful and Ramuz the northern division of the province of 'Arabistan. The physical DISTRICT geography, climate, population and government of the Shushtar District are described in the article on Northern 'Arabistan, and its agriculture, trade and communications receive notice in the article on 'Arabistan as a whole : only the question of limits and that of topography remain to be dealt with here. Boundaries, —The Shushtar district is completely surrounded by Persian territory. On the north it is bounded by the Bakhtiyari hills, extending however for a short distance into the same to include the level tract of 'Aqili upon the Karun river ; on the east its limit is the Gargar river, except opposite Shushtar Town, where it makes a loop 7 miles in length to the eastward so as to include the village of Bulaiti along with its lands ; its southern boundary, which is short and divides it from the Ahwaz district of Southern ^rabistan^ crosses the Miyauab island from side to side about 5 miles above Band-i-Qir and thence runs to the left bank of the Diz, which it strikes immediately above the locations of the 'Anafijeh tribe ; its western border is at the same time the eastern border of the Dizful District of Northern 'Arabistan and is defined in the article on that district. topography&gt; —The majority of inhabited places in the Shushtar district are enumerated and described in the articles on 'Aqili, on the Gargar and Shatait rivers and on MiyaHab ; a few more which ai'e situated to the west of the Shatait are given in the table below. Re ference to the various articles quoted and to the following table will showSHtTSHTAR DISTRICT 1817 that the population of the district without 'Aqili, inclusive of Shushtar Town (30,000) and exclusive of nomads, is about 35,000 souls.

In the hot weather Arabs under Shaikh Farhan Asad of the Kathir come here for pasturage and sink shallow wells in a dry watercourse beside the village. Mares, mules, donkeys, buffaloes, cattle, sheep and goats are owned here; the crops are wheat, barley, beans, rice, Kunjid, cotton, millet and Mash ; water is from the Shureh stream, apparently the tributary so named of the Diz river.

The name is pronounc ed Chimtar Khan, The town of Shushtar, the administrative capital of Northern 'Arabistan, is situated at the northern extremity of the Miyanab in the angle formed by the division of the Karun into its Shatait and Gargar branches. Shushtar ; by the Arab geographers called Tu6tar ; was a very1820 SHtTSHTAR TOWN flourishing- place in the 10th and 14th centuries A. D. and appears to have been at that time the capital of 'Arabistan.* Site. —Shushtar stands for the most part on somewhat elevated ground, consisting of the ordinary alluvial soil of the country intermingled with the ruins and rubbish of ages. Overhanging the Shatait, however, at the corner where its course changes from west to south, is a high isolated sandstone cliff 100 feet high^ on which stands the citadel or QaFeh j except at this point the left bank of the Shatait at Shushtar is low, and exhibits, when the river is running at its normal level, a long shelving beach of shingle. On the Gargar an outcrop of sandstone commences a little way below the head of the stream and continues for a short way down. Buildings and public works, —The houses of Shushtar, though of some height and architectural pretension^ are mostly old and in bad repair, and large parts of the town are ruinous and deserted. The majority of the houses are provided with subterranean chambers, lighted and venti lated by vertical shafts here called Shawwadans and with flat parapeted roofs about 30 feet from the ground. Both these appurte nances are designed for comfort in the hot weather; the cellar then becomes by day the scene of family life, which at night is transferred to the roof.t The sanitary condition of the town, chiefly in consequence of an arrangement which makes the public street a receptacle of domestic sewage, is indescribably foul; but, as the ground in most parts has a natural fall, matters are improved by rain instead of being aggra vated as at Dizful. The bazaar consists of an open space, surrounded by rows of hovels used as shops, and encumbered with fragments of ruined walls against which shelters and screens are placed in the day time to form booths. The chief architectural features of the town are a large Jami ; mosque standing on an eminence near the Pul-i-Lashkar bridge to the south of the town ; a lofty leaning minaret; about 20 mosques, some of which have blue-tiled domes ; and some 15 Imamzadehs and Qadamgahs. * A Yide Le Strange. f A curious point about Shushtar is that some of the houses in the town bave nick* names by which they are universally known. Such are the Khaneh-i-Pashkheh or House of Flies, the Khaneh-i-Buz or House of the Goat, the Khanehn-Kalleh Khushk or House of the Hot-Tempered One, and the Khaneh-i-Mawas Bird or House of ' Hurry and Begone, ' the name in the last case referring (it is believed) to some former owner of particularly repulsive aspect.SHtJSHTAR TOWN 1821 The engineering works connected with Shushtar upon the Gargar and the Shatait are noticed under those names; but here must be mentioned the IVTinau canal^ which traverses part of the town and is the only canal that waters the IVtiyctnab. This channel leaves the Shatait by an opening pierced in the base of the citadel rock and, running for some distance underground, emerges near the head of the Dizful bridge ; thence it finds its way by a deep cutting to the south of the town where, passing under a bridge called the Pul-i-Lashkar j&amp;J &lt;Jj, it gains the open country. The discharge of this canal, measured on the 25th of March 1905 when it was running 5 feet below its maximum level, was 970 cubic feet a second; its bed-width was found to be about 60 feet, the maximum depth of water was 6 feet and the surface velocity 5 feet a second. Shushtar could formerly be quitted by three land-routes; that to the west over the Dizful bridge has now ceased to exist in conse quence of the rupture of the bridge, and its place has been taken by a ferry ; the others are the PuH-Lashkar* road already mentioned, which conducts to the Miyanab^ and the Pul-i-Bulaiti dam which affords at passage to Bulaiti village, virtually a suburb of Shushtar on the left bank of the Gargar, and to the country beyond. Inhabitants. —The present population of Shushtar is about 20,000 souls, but the place seems to be declining. The great bulk of the people belong to an indigenous mongrel breed, unknown by any name save that of Shushtaris, who speak a Persian patois of their own resembling (but distinguishable from) that of the Dizfulis. All of the Shushtaris are Shfah Muhammadans: their most prominent sections are Saiyids, Khawanin and Mashaikh, found here as at Dizful, who number about 1,000, 500 and 500 persons respectively. The town contains no Arabs, and a few Bakhtiyaris constitute the only community which is not merged in the general body of Shushtaris : the greater homogeneity of the population may perhaps be regarded as indicative of a municipal existence longer or more continuous than that of Dizful. Manufactures, occupations and trade, —A number of local industries are carried on at Shushtar. Among the articles manufactured are woven carpets of wool called Gilims or Haramis ; woollen cloth for 'Abas; coarse cotton canvas ; light cotton stuffs for clothing ; turbans and waist cloths ; cotton shoes ; coats, hats and floor cloths of felt; objects of iron, copper, * This road no doubt led to the town of Lashkar or 'Askar Mukram while it existed ? hence tlw, name of the bridge.1822 SHtTSHTAR TOWN brass and German silver as at Dizful; silver work ; glazed earthenware ; pack and riding saddles, Occupations not connected with these manufao tures are the burning of bricks, the making of lime, the manufacture of opium for local use and for export, the tanning of leather, and the dyeing of cloth. Such of the inhabitants as are not engaged in these manufactures and other occupations live for the most part by wholesale or retail trade, by agriculture or by religion : the residue are builders, carpenters, muleteers and raftsmen, Shushtar is the river port of Dizful, through which the latter receives all its imports from abroad and des patches all its foreign exports; and all Dizful merchants have agents or correspondents at Shushtar. Messrs, Lynch Brothers have a trading agency at Shushtar • their representative is at present an Armenian. Trade methods are much the same as at DizfuL The Shushtar Man is equal to .15-487 lbs. English. Resources and transport, —The water-supply of Shushtar is of course unlimited. Supplies, except fuel which comes from ^Aqili and the jungles on the Diz^ are drawn chiefly from Miyanab : food and forage cannot be called abundant, but in good years there are considerable stocks of both in the town. About 800 mules are owned at Shushtar, but of these a varying number are always absent either at grazing or on caravan. There are 20 flour mills in working order on the Gargar, but only 10 of them can be run in the hot weather. Administration and revenues —Shushtar, though inferior to Dizful in size and prosperity, is the head-quarters of the Persian administration in Northern 'Arabistan and the seat of the Hakim or Governor:^ this distinction it no doubt owes to its historical pre-eminence, strategic importance with regard to both hills and plains, and convenient position upon the Karun river. The citadel or castle, formerly known as QaPeh-i- Salasal hut now generally styled simply Qal'eh-i- Hukumati is situated, as already mentioned, upon a rocky bluff that overlooks the headwaters of the Shatait: it contains the Governors palace and is adjoined by an arsenal. The QaFehis con structed in several tiers, is surrounded by a lofty wall and appears to threaten rather than to protect the town. In former days it might well have withstood siege, but its defences would be valueless against modern artillery; moreover, it is partially commanded at a short range by the houses on the edge of the town, and, at longer ranges, from the further * There was also till recently a Deputy-Goveruor : see the article on Northern 'Arabistan,SIB 1823 side of the Shattlit. The strength of the garrison is not fixed and is usually a negligible quantity. There are at Shush tar a Persian post offioe^ telegraph office and -customs house. The revenue levied on the town is a part of that assessed on the district^ but it is collected separately^ viz., it is distributed in lumpsums among the different trade guilds and the amount due from each trade is collected by the head of the guild and paid by him to the Mustaufi.* The following are some of the principal items : Baqqals or general dealers, 300 Tumans per annum; Bazzazes or cloth merchants; 200 ^ ^Attars or grocers and druggists, 120 ; copper-smiths, 14; Harambafs or carpet weavers, 150. The flour mills upon the Gargar afford an annual revenue to Government that fluctuates between 600 and 800 Tumans; this is collected by a curious double method. The mill-owner first takes for himself 1 Chaharak of the flour for every Man ground and the Government Farrash at the same time takes 2 Siyah Pul in cash from the owner of the flour on account of every Man; afterwards, the money received from the persons patronising a particular mill having been totalled at the end of the week, the owner of the mill is required to deliver to Government one Man of Hour for every Qran which has been collected by Government from his customers. The Governor at present holds a monopoly of the ferry upon the Dizful road, for which he pays 600 Tumans a year to the Persian Government. Political matters. —Shushtar is the seat of two powerful groups of Mujtahids who are much more influential than the Mujtahids of Dizful; the principal Mujtahid is at present Haji Saiyid ■'Abdus Samad^ who with his family owns numerous villages situated on the Gargar and Shatait and in Miyanab and is landlord of the Hardan tribe in Kharran. The administration of public charity and the management of education are in their hands; and before the advent of the present strong Governor in 1905 the town was virtually ruled by them, some of the more important among the Khawanm being then the only other persons who had any voice in public affairs. There is an Imam Jum^eh at Shushtar as there is at Dizful. Shushtar is not now a natural political centre, and if the Persian Governor and Mujtabids were to be removed it would probably fall into obscurity. A scattered town on the Batinah coast of the ^Oman Sultanate ; it g jjj is 25 miles west of Masqat Town and is the first place of importance * In 1908 the Mustaufi stated that the assessment on the town of Shushtar, and on the villages most closely connected with it, was 3,000 Tumans a year in cash and 100 Kharvars of grain.3 1824 SlB reached in Batinah from tlie Masqat side. Sib consists of several detaclied quarters; the aggregate number of dwellings may be about 1,000 ; nearly all of them are huts. The principal tribes are 'Awamir (460 houses^ including 60 of the Aulad Mahaiyi section), Baluchis and Jadgals (200 houses), Siyabiyin of the Mabasili, Mahamil and other sections (30, 30, and 5 houses), Bani Hina of the Aulad Yusuf section (60 houses), Aulad Hadid (50 houses), Hani 'Umr (45 houses), A1 'Umair (45 houses), Bani Jabir (30 houses), Hirth (30 houses) and Persians (15 houses). The bazaar consists of about 50 Arab and Persian shops, besides 8 which are kept by Hindu traders. Extensive date groves and many gardens producing lucerne, mangoes, limes and almonds, surround the town; the chief resources of the people are date and fruit-growing and fishing. Sib is the port for Wadi Samail, so far as not served by Matrah, and for Wadi Tau the trade of which it divides with Barkah : 10 Shashahs and 40 small boats are owned here which do not ordinarily run further than Masqat. Sib is cooler and healthier than Masqat, and in summer many inhabitants of Masqat resort here and erect temporary houses. A Wali, whose residence is at the inner edge of the date groves about a mile from the coast, is posted here with a detachment of 40 men commanded by an ^Aqid to support his authority. The customs duty on goods imported into Sib is payable at Masqat, but Zakat to the amount of $1 ,000 a year is collected locally at Sib and remitted to Masqat- SIKAN- ^ I1 ^ ur kish 'Iraq, a village of some 50 mud houses with a Khan DARIYAH and several brick enclosures, forming a stage on the main route from Baghdad to Karbala.

Cultivation is being rapidly developed, especially to the east of the village; there is also some grazing in the neighbourhood, and numerous flocks and herds may be seen in winter between Sikandariyah and Musaiyib.

The uncultivated parts are fairly well covered with mimosa bushes and tussocks of coarse grass. Irrigation is from wells : there are no Falajs. Tn old-fashioned books and records the whole of the Eas-al -Khaimah District is sometimes called ' Seer ' or ' Julfar ,; : the latter word appears to be a corruption of Jirfal &gt; which is the name of a tract in the bounds of Shimil village. SIRHAN A valley, or rather a long sinuous tract of depressed ground, in north- (WADI) western Arabia extending from Kaf, 160 miles south-south-east of Damascus, to a point 20 miles west of JaTlf-al-^Amir ; its length, from north-west to south-east, is about 140 miles. On the northeast the Wadi is bordered by the Hamad or Syrian desert, on the south-west by basaltic hills and sandhills and, towards its south-eastern end on that side, by a plain of clayey soil and pebbles called Basaitah The breadthSIRHAN (WADI) 1827 si k vii; of the Wadi varies ; near its north end at Ithrah it is about 12 miles wide. The lowest part appears to be in the neighbourhood of Ithrah and Kaf, where the elevation is about 1,800 feet above sea-level. There are different routes along the valley following different series of wells &gt; conse quently the accounts of travellers are difficult to compare and their stages are rarely the same ; this much however is clear, that the northern balf of the Wadi is the more sandy and level and has some vegetation, wbile the southern is sterile, stony and broken. Near Kaf are some saline marshes, where the ground is difficult for camels and the surface for some miles is covered with a dazzling white deposit of salt. The Basaitah plain already mentioned is said to contain ostriches, and it produces Samh seed in large quantities, which Euwalah Bedouins bring to Jauf-al-^Amir for sale. In midwinter there is sometimes hard frost in Wadi Sirhan. The following are the chief points in Wadi Sirhan regarding which we possess definite infoymatioii Name. Position. Nature. R emarks.

There is a date grove of 450 palms which, with some salt de posits 2 or 3 miles to southward, forms the chief resource of the place. The salt is purified by crystal lisation and becomes very white but re tains a bitter taste. It seldom rains here, and the summer is hotter than at Jauf- al-'Amir. The people wear Bedouin costume and many of them suffer from ophthal mia. In 1877 the village acknowledged Ibn Rashid and paid an annual tribute of £4. The wells are 5 fathoms deep and the water is sweet. The place is frequented by the Shararat. This is a station of the Shararat and of the Hawizim section of the Harb or Hataim. The wells are sunk in sandstone and contain sweet water at 1 fathom or less. The spot is hidden among sand hillocks covered with brush wood and has a few stunted palms. 'Wadi Sirhan belongs to the Shararat and is visited also by the :i|. eag y Hawazim section of the Harb or Hataim and by the ^Anizall, both Enwalah and Bishr. With Jauf-al-'Amir it formerly belonged to the Jabal Sliammar principality, but Kaf and Itbrah at the north end ^ appear now to have passed under Turkish domination. ^ ^SIRRAH (QASR-AS-) 1829 A depressed tract in Najd, situated in the desert between ShaQrah SlRR and Anaizah ^ it is said to be about 40 miles in length from north to (WADI-AS-) south and 20 miles in breadth. Wadi-as-Sirr contains wells and springs, 'J, o| but its drainage is stated to have no outlet. It is traversed by the route ' between 'Anaizah and Shaqrah and is separated from the latter place by a tract of red sandhills. Wadi-as-Sirr contains the following 8 villages:— Xame* Position.

Faidhali About midway between 'Ayuu- as-Sirr and Bar- rud-as-Sirr. 60 mnd houses of Hataim and Bani Tamim. Faidhah is surrounded by a wall with towers, and there are a few outlying towers to protect cultivation. There are several date groves, and the wells are 6 to 7 fathoms deep. 'Ataibah and Mutair encamp here occa sionally. A fortified desert residence of the Shaikh of Kuwait, 8 miles south- SIRRAS south-east of Kuwait Town: it was built about 1900. The fort is (QASR-AS-) oblong and measures 150 by 120 feet : there is a tower at each corner. The walls are of mud faced with gypsum plaster, 12 feet high and 2 feet thick; they are not loopholed. The only entrance is in the north face. The fort stands at an elevation of 180 feet above the sea upon the1830 SIRRAH (QASR-AS-) highest of half a dozen lov/ hills^ and it is supplied with water from wells 60 to 70 feet deep; the water is good and abundant for this part of the country, and the Shaikh when living at Kuwait sometimes obtains his supply from here. About 12 miles south and slightly east of Sirrah are the wells of Thamilat-al-'Atul JyxJI &amp;UJ (so called from a section of the 'Ajman tribe) of which the water is always sweet* In English maps of a former period shown as a Snrdy ;; . An island in the middle of the Persian Gulf, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, which is the nearest point upon the Persian Coast. In shape it is a truncated wedge^ 3^ miles in length from east to west, 21 miles broad at the eastern eDd ; and 1 mile across at its western extremity ; it is low, sandy and bare of natural vegetation, with many small detached hills of dark colour, none of which exceed 60 feet in height. On all sides the sea is deep at more than | a mile off shore, and on the east and south-east sides the deep water comes close in; the anchorages are all indifferent. There are two permanent villages on the island : Bilad Zara/iyali uu dfcfyj jib and Bilad Ghawawis ^ . Bilad Zara/iyah is situated towards the north-eastern coi'ner of the island and consists ofa dozen mud huts tena.nted by Abu Dastur Arabs; the Abu Dastur are one of the divisions of the Arabs of the Persian Coast who are known under the general name of Fawaris j in religion those of Sirri are Sunnis of the Hanbali school. The village possesses a date grove of about 500 trees, and the inhabitants cultivate a little wheat and barley and some melons and onions for their own consumption. Irrigation is from a group of 12 wells called Tui Na^amih d+xi about d fathoms deep, which provide a fair supply of good water; but it seems that at s,ome previous time water was more plentiful than it is now, and the cultivation of the village more extensive. Livestock at Bilad Zara/iyah are 20 donkeys, 12 well-bullocks, 12 milch cows and 400 sheep and goats. There are no boats. Bilad Glmwawis is situated on the south-eastern coast of Sirri opposite the anchorage marked in the Admiralty Chart. It is occupied by 40 families of Sudan and SO of Huwalah, all origiually from the coast of * A distant view of Sirtl from the'^a is given in.

At this village there are no animals and no cultivation; but the people own 15 Sambuks for pearling on the Arabian banks and 30 small Baqarahs which are used for pearl-diving and fishing round the island. Their drinking water is from a single well called Bu Sur , about 600 yards north-west of the village, which yields an abundant supply but inferior in quality to the water of Tui Na'amih. There has been a Persian flagstaff on Sirri since 1887, and since 1899 it has been located at Bilad Ghawawis. In 1904 two Tufangchis of the Imperial Persian Customs were stationed at Bilad Ghawawis, where they are now in charge of the Persian flag and collect duty on all imports reaching the island not covered by an exemption pass from Lingeh. From 1887 until recently tithes used to be collected on Sirri after each harvest by an emissary of the Deputy-Governor of Lingeh, and the island is apparently regarded by the Persian Government as belonging to their Lingeh District j but the title of Persia to Sirri is not admitted by the British Government^ and the Shaikh of Sharjah has certain hereditary claims to the island.* An island of the Bahrain archipelago, the third of the group both SITKAHt in size and importance. It lies off the east coast of Bahrain island, tji** from which it is separated by a narrow and shallow channel on its south-west side. Sitrah island measures H miles from north to south and tapers from the north, where it is H miles broad, to its southern extremity. The northern part is exceedingly fertile, watered from both springs and wells and covered with high date palms; it contains 7 villages of Baharinall, of which the largest is Kharijiyah. The remainder of the island is an expanse of sand, raised only a few inches above high-water level; the only village in this part is Umm-al-Baidh, near the southern extremity, which is inhabited by Sunnis. As in Bahrain the only crops grown, besides dates and fruit, are lucerne and vegetables, Sitrah forms a valuable part of the fief held by Khalid- bin-'Ali, a brother of the Shaikh of Bahrain : his summer residence is a bastioned house at Kharrjiyab. * Information about the statuB of Sirri is contained in the Foreign Proceedings of the Government o£ India for February 1905. . „ ,. . , . . t The more important authorities, maps, charts, etc., are specified in a footnote to the general article Bahrain principality.1832 SITRAH The principal places and features of interest on or connected with Sitrah island, some of which have already been mentioned above, are as follow :— Name.

I ^ V.iA / SIYABIYIN Singular is Siyabi . A somewhat widely distributed but ( Jjj U aw not very numerous tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate ; Ghafiri in politics and Ibadhi in religion. None of them are genuine Bedouins. They are disposed to friendship with the Bani Jabir and to enmity with the Nidabiyin, Bani Battash, Bani ^Arabah and Hadadabah. The Siyabiyin are found chiefly in Hajar and the Masqat District, their principal settlements being in Wadi Mansah at Nafa'ah (300 houses) ; in Wadi Samail at Sib-adh-Dhafar (40 houses); Ghail-ad-Dakk (20 houses); Ghubrah (25 houses); Dan (20 houses), Bidbid (20 houses), Mizra^ (30 houses), Qurta/ (50 houses), Milaiyinah (20 houses) and ; Amqat (15 houses) ; in 'Wadi Bani Kharus at Mahalil (20 houses) and Salaiyah (10 houses) and also at 'Awabi; in Wadi Saijani at Eissah (20 houses) and Saijani (100 houses); in Wadi Fara' at Talaj Shirah (50 houses) and Misfah (50 houses) j in Wadi Khabbah at Khabbah (50 houses) j in Wadi Tayin at Ghubrat-at-Tam (60 houses) j in Wadi Boshar at Sa'al (20 houses); Ghallah (15 houses) and both Misfahs (40 houses) ; in Wadi Risail at Marairat (3 houses); Jafnain (10 houses) and Risail (10 houses). They occur also in Batinah at Sib (65 houses) and Barkah (20 houses) and are represented at Mat rah. Their total number is thus roughly about 5,500 sotlls. Those at Rissah in Wadi Saijani belong to a section called Mubasili . Some of the Siyabiyin are rich, but the tribe generally arp not held in much repute. Kafa'ah is the tribal capital and the residence of the chief of their Shaikhs, Saif-bin-Muhsin.SOHAE WILAYAT 1835 SOHAE This is an important administrative division of the ; Oman Sultanate : it comprises the whole western half of the Batinah District. Sohar is in chaige of a Wali of the Sultan of ^Oman who has his seat at Sohar WILAYAT Town; it is composed of 4 administrative subdivisions^ which are^ and .in order from south-east to north-west; Saham, Sohar Proper, Liwa and SUB- Shinas. Sohar Proper is under the direct supervision of the Wali and details concerning 1 it are given below j the other three subdivisions, each governed by an official subordinate to the Wali of Sohar, form the subjects of separate articles. The valleys of Western Hajar from Wadi ^Ahin to Wadi-al -Qor inclusive are regarded as pertaining, along with the tribes that inhabit them, to the Sohar Wilayat; but the degree of control, if control it can be called, exercised by the W ali over this part of his charge is slight. The Sohar Wilayat resembles the rest of Batinah in most of its physical features. Springs, however, occur at Falaj-al-Hijari, 'Auhi and Falaj-al-Qabail; elsewhere, as is usual in Batinah, water is from wells. The chief places in the subdivision of Sohar Proper, in their order from south-east to north-west, are the following :— WILAYAT Name.

Ih i i i i l J, !'♦/1838 SOHAR WILATAT The total fixed population of the suh-Wilayat is thus about 20,000 souls. In the whole Wilayat practically no substantial houses are found except at Sohar Town, Bu Baqarah and Murair ; there are one or two also at the subdivisional headquarters of Saham, Liwa and Shinas. Huts of date branches are the usual kind of dwelling'. The subject of trade, so far as trade exists in the Wilfiyat, is dealt with in the articles on the subdivisions and on Sohar Town, The. revenue of the whole Sohar Wilayat, to which for fiscal purposes Hibl in western Ha jar is attached, amounts to $10; 000 in customs duty proper and $15,000 in Zakat; the whole of this, however, is swallowed up by the expenses of the local administration, nothing remaining over to be remitted to the central treasury at Masqat. SOHAR TOWN An important town on the Batinah coast of the 'Oman Sultanate, the seat of government of the whole western half of Batinah and the port of Wadis 'Ahin, Hilti, Jizi, Bani 'Umr-al-G-harbi and, to a certain extent, of the Baraimi Oasis. Sohar is situated on the coast about 34 miles north-west of Khaburah and 30 south-east of Shinas; Baraimi lies about 65 miles from it, almost due west. A remarkable isolated hill 1,550 feet high, to Europeans known as Sohar Peak but by Arabs called Hurah Barghah rises 14 miles inland to the west-south-west of Sohar. The town of Sohar proper contains about 800 houses, of which half belong to Persians, 100 to Bayasirah and 40 or 50 to Baharinah : the rest of the population belong to miscellaneous tribes, among whom the Yahamidab though now reduced to a few families, appear to be universally known. The town proper is walled upon the landward sides and contains a huge, square, 4-storeyed fort of brick ; parts of the works connected with it have a Portuguese appearance. Several villages upon the coast adjoining Sohar are reckoned quarters of the town. On the north-west side there is only one such quarter, Hadhlrah a place of ^50 houses inhabited by Baluchis and divided from the town proper by a small creek which extends about 300 yards inland ; half a mile north-west of Hadhlrah another creek breaks the line of coast and runs southwards for 600 yards in a direction roughlySOHAR TOWN n I ft ii Hi It 1839 parallel to tlie store.

Do* Do, The houses in the town proper are of mud and stone, and those in the extra-mural quarters are huts. The total population of Sohar is pro bably about 7,500 souls. The Batinah date belt is about 3 miles deep at Sohar, and the palms belonging to the town are estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 ; there is conse quently great abundance of dates, and mangoes also are plentiful, but ordinary cultivation, which is chiefly of lucerne, wheat and sugar, is insignificant. The remains of an ancient stone aqueduct called Falaj-al^ Mu^taridh which once brought water a distance of 14 or 15 miles from Wadi-al -Jizi near Hurah Barghah to Sohar town, are still traceable for the greater part of the way. The Sohar bazaar contains about 200 shops. The only industry at Sohar town, except tanning in which about 12 households are engaged, is the manufacture of silken turbans and lungis which find a sale at Masqat} but local weaving has been nearly extinguished by the competition of cheap Indian manufactures. The principal exports of the circumjacent district which are shipped at Sohar are dates, ghi, dried limes, cowhides and goat-skins j these are mostly destined for Masqat. Three iKllojall and 6 Hindu traders are settled at Sohar, some on their own account and some as agents for Masqat merchants ; they deal in cloth, flour and rice which they obtain from Masqat. Here the Indians do not engage in the date trade, the whole surplus stock being cleared of£ by boats which come from the coast of Trucial 'Oman, Masqat and other places to purchase. About 8 sea-going Badans running to Masqat and Makran are owned here besides some 30 smaller craft.1840 SOHAR TOWN Sohar town is the seat of the Sultan of 'Oman's Wali for all Western ^ ^ Batinah; this individual resides in the fort and has at his disposal a ^ ^ force of about 30 men. A wet ditch^ starting from the head of the M creek between Hadhirah and the town proper, girdles the latter on the landward side, keeping close to the outside of the town wall, and rejoins the sea between the town proper and Harat Shizao. pf / SUBAIH (QASRAL) A considerable village in the Sanjaq of Hasa ] it is situated in the Biyadh tract (I), about 4 miles from the coast midway between Jubail- al-Bahri and Ras-ad-Dafi. The village consists of the Qasr proper, a fortified enclosure, and of about 350 permanent date-stick huts by which it is surrounded. The Qasr is described as about the same size as the Shaikh o£ Bahrain's fort at Manamah and its armament consists of 6 muzzle-loading guns, in good order and well oiled, which have been there for many years. The fort was in a ruinous condition and the exterior village did not exist until 1905, when the fort was rebuilt and the village was founded by the Shaikhs of the Had-hud and Dhahairat subsections of the A1 Subaih section of the Bani Khalid, as a base of operations against the Mutair and Al Morrah tribes. The Shaikhs of the Had-hud and Dhaliairat now reside permanently in the fort, and the paramount Shaikh of the Al Subaih section camps periodically in the vicinity. The inhabitants of the place, which is also known as Qasr Mar'ubr regard themselves as out of reach of the Turks. m SUDAH An extensive plain forming the southernmost district of the Kuwait Principality. It lies on the sea ; is bounded on the north by the district of Hazainij, from which the Maqta' stream divides it; reaches on the west to the eastern extremity of the Dhula'-al -Mi'aijil range and to the Na'airiyah hill at the head of Wadi-al -Miyah : southwards it is bounded by Radaif, Sabakhat-al -Mntaya and Zor-al -Audhan in the Hasa Sanjaq. At its north end it includes the Labibah plain. The length of Sudah from north-north-west to south-south-east is thus about $0 miles ; its surface is said to be very level, consisting of a dark firmnil l StJDAH 1841 sand. There are no trees, but Rimth, 'Andal, 'Arfaj and Thamam afford camel and other grazing. The following are the principal inland features of the district; — Name.

Singular Suwaidi . A tribe of Trucial 'Oman, Qatar and Bahrain ; they are closely connected with the Kunud, and their descent from Aswad-al-Kindi—supposed to have been an immigrant from Yaman in the time of Muhammad—is generally admitted. In Trucial 'Oman the Sudan have 375 houses at Abu Dhabi Town and 30 at Batin in the Abu Dhabi Principality; 250 at Dibai Town, 300 at Sharjah Town and 20 on Bu Musa Island in the Shaikhdom of Sharjah; and 12 at 'Ajman : in all nearly 1,000 houses. In Qatar they occur at Dohah, 80 houses, and in Bahrain at Hadd, 10 houses. On Sirri Island there are about 40 families. The total number of the tribe may consequently be estimated at about 5,500 souls, of whom almost 5,000 reside in the ports of Trucial J 0man. There is little to differentiate the Sudan of Trucial 'Oman from the ^ other tribes among whom they dwell; but those of Qatar are distin- ^ ^ guished from most of their Sunni neighbours by being Hanabilah and not Muwalik; their two principal divisions are the A1 Ramdha and hk the A1 Salmin. The northern Sudan of Qatar were once an influential ^ community; but after 1867 their power declined, in consequence of ^ the attack made on Dohah in that year by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Abu Dhabi : they now live by pearl dealing, by pearl diving and by seafaring occupations. A tribe of which the population of the Hillah Qadha in Turkish l^l ar i 'Iraq is to a large extent composed: they seem to occupy the whole, or llj ^ ^ nearly the whole, of the Barmanah and Mamduhiyah subdivisions of the ^ district, which follow one another on the left bank of the Euphrates ii 'j^ ( below Hillah Town. The A1 Bu Sultan are also found in the Najaf 4]^ Qadha. . ^ a +1844 SULUTAH they live by pearl diving, pearl dealing, navigation, and the breeding of cattle and camels. The Sulutah are Maliki Sunnis and appear to be of restless habits. A number of them immigrated into Bahrain with the 'Utub in 1783 ; and some were settled at Dammam in the Qatif Oasis during the earlier part of the 19th century. The descendants of those who went to Bahrain, finding themselves on the losing side when Shaikh 'Isa was established as Shaikh of Bahrain in 1869, fled back to Qatar ; but a few of them returned to Bahrain in 1893 in con sequence of trouble between the Shaikh of Ddhah and the Wali of Basrah, SUMAI8- A walled village on the east eoast of Qatar, situated at the bottom of MAH a small bay about midway between Lusail and Khor Shaqiq. One mile ea st of it, at the southern point of the same bay, is the village of Dha'ain with which it is intimately connected. Sumaismah is inhabited by about 250 families of the Al Bu Kuwarah tribe, and there are also a few Kibisah. There are 50 pearl boats here, also 10 other sea-going vessels and 10 fishing boats. Livestock include 6 horses and 70 camels. Drinking water is obtained from the wells of ^Awainat Bin-Husain, 4 miles to the westward : near the village there is also a small well called Khariqat Sumaismah, but its water is bitter. SUMMAN A huge district, the northern part of which is claimed by the present ^ Shaikh of Kuwait as part of his territory; it lies between the Dahclnah. desert on the west and the districts of Dibdibah and Shaqq, the Aba Dhahair hills and the Taff hills in Hasa on the east. Summan extends approximately from the latitude of Hafar on the north to the route between Riyadh and Hofuf on the south, and possibly beyond; its length from north-west to south-east is thus at least 340 miles. It is divided, half way between the extreme points mentioned, by the Wabrah route from Kuwait to Najd ; and its breadth, which at Wabrah is 90 miles, diminishes southwards to about 20 miles at the place where the road between Eiyadh and Hofuf crosses it. Entered from the Kuwait side, by the Wabrah route, the Summan is at first a confused region of earthy mounds and fiat-topped sandstoneStTQ-ASH-SHU YtJKH QADHA 184,5 hills^ through which run shallow winding 1 valleys that in spring are biightened here and there by wild flowers^ grass and shrubs. Further on the hills become more entangled, and the celebrated wells, cross-roads and camping ground of Wabrah are reached. Beyond Wabrah the country becomes again more open ; the valleys, broad and fiat-bottomed, run with winding courses almost north and south, while the hills, low, level and less inegularly disposed, are frequently ribanded near their bases with brick- colour or, when their form is conical, exhibit brick-red in their summits. A barren and glaring tract follows and is succeeded by a second labyrinth of valleys, but the aspect of the country is now milder. The last 20 miles, as the western border of the Summan is approached, consists of broken ground with patches of grass and brushwood ; it gradually opens into undulating plains, with outcrops of sandstone, which end abruptly at the sandy barrier of the Dahtiliall. On the Riyadh-Hofuf road the Summan presents towards the west scarped and embayed cliffs from 50 to 100 feet high, and on this parallel the central portion consists of bare plains, reaching to the horizon and strewn with gravel and small stones, that afford no fuel and no grazing for camels. After good rain there is admirable pasture throughout the greater part of the Summan, better than that of the Dah&lt;lnah. The common brushwood of the tract is a kind of wild myrtle; and sour sorrel, said to have been introduced by the Turks in Hasa, is abundant. In spring wild parsley and various wild flowers are seen.* The Arabs who encamp in Summan are nearly all Mutair ; but towards the south end there are some 'Ajman who occupy it in common with the Mutair. The tract is visited also by Bani Khalid. Qahtan and Sabai'. The best known wells in the Summan are those of Wabrah : but it also contains those of Safah, mentioned in the articles on Hafar and Dhula'-al- Mi'aijil. A division of the Muntafik SanjSq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish SUQ-ASE- Iraq. ^SHUYtJKH * Fuller information about the botany and geology of Summan is contained in tiy* Felly's Beport on a Journey to the Wahahee Capital^ especially Appendices II and QADHA in.1846 StJQ-ASH-SHUYtJKH QADHA JPosiUon and boundaries. —This Qadha lies upon both sides of tKe Euphrates river, nearly all of it below the town from which it takes its name. It is bounded by the Qadha of Shatrat-al-^Ainarah on the north, by that of Qurnah. on the east, by the Shamiyah. desert on the south and by the Nasinyah Qadha on the west. Topography and inhabitants. —The town of Suq-ash-Shuyukh is the only place of importance in the Qadha, unless Garmah and (to Hammar jU*. are to be reckoned as being the headquarters of Nahiyahs. Hammar is situated at the eastern end of the district, on the left bank of the Euphrates at the place where it is joined by the principal channel of the Shatt-al-Gharaf, viz.) about 35 miles by Water below Suq-ash-Shuyukh and on equal distance above Madinah. The Euphrates and the large marshes formed by the meeting of that river with the Shatt-al-Gharaf are the distinctive features of the district. The people of the country are Muntafik, Bani Asad, Ahl-al-Jazair, Bani Mansur and Bani Sa^id ; and Hammar, from the inhabitants of the marshes surrounding it, is sometimes spoken of as a Bani Asad/ ; Population* —The fixed population of the Qadha is placed at 85^000 souls ; except some 3,000 Sunni Muhammadans, 700 Sabians and 300 Jews, all are Shi'ah Arabs. The general health is not good in consequence of the marshes. Be&amp;oitrces. —Large parts of the district consist merely of swamp; and the productions, vegetable and animal, are those of the wetter portions of ''Iraq. Large quantities of matting are made from reeds and some matting is exported. Administration. —Suq-ash-Shuyukh contains &gt; besides the Markaz of headquarters Kahiyah, two others, viz., Garmah and Hammar. There is generally a military detachment about 100 strong at Hammar, furnished (it seems probable) from the cantonment of Khamisiyah nearer to Suq-ash-Shuyukh. Hammar is a telegraph station. The Dairat-as^ Saniyah department holds land in the Qadha and is represented by a Mamur at Hammar. SH i ^ 11 i m P 01 ^ an ^ ^own and municipality in Turkish 'Iraq, situated for the most part on the right bank of the Euphrates: it derives its name from TOWN ^at the desert tribes resort to it for trade*StJB, 1847 The town has numerous fruit gardens, and its date plantations extend up the left bank of the Euphrates till they meet those of Nasiriyah Town; the neighbourhood, unfortunately, is marshy and the climate unhealthy. The Euphrates is spanned at the town by a bridge of about pontoons, the number of which is increased to 15 or 16 when the river rises. The population of Suq-ash-Shuyukh amounts to about 12,000 souls^ about three-fourths of whom are Shi^ahs, but it includes 700 Sabians and 280 Jews. The religious head of the Sabians, known as the Qari, lives here. The Sabian community, who have a small primary school for their children, are mostly goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and builders of Mashhuf canoes; they inhabit a quarter on the left bank of the river which is connected with the main town by the bridge of boats. The Jews are mostly petty traders and money-lenders* There are over 200 shops at Suq^ash-Shuyukh, and ^Abas are manufactured; but, except with the Arab tribes, there is no consider- 4 able trade. Suq-ash-Shuyukh is the headquarters of a Qadha of the same name in the Sanjaq of Muntafik, and it is connected by a single line of telegraph with the town of Nasiriyah above, and with the village of Hammar below it. A post office also exists, and the Customs department is repre sented by a Mamur, while the affairs of the river are controlled by a harbour master. There are no troops at Suq-ash-Shuyukh proper; but a battalion vu of infantry with its headquarters at Khamisiyah , a little further down the Euphrates^ is dispersed in detachments about the adjacent country. c ■- - — ^ ' . ■ ■ ' L - ' • v - v&gt; \s ■* A town of gi'eat political and commercial importance on the coast of the Eastern Hajar of the ^Oman Sultanate ; it is reckoned the second town of the Sultanate in size, coming next after Matrah of which the population is 14,000, while that of Sur with its suburbs is about 12,000 sotds. Sur is situated 17 miles west of Eas-aMladd and 94 miles south-east of Masqat. The shore at Sur is low and sandy, destitute both of trees and of other vegetation. The principal features of the place are a creek, with the town standing on both sides of its entrance; a stony ridge, called 'Is which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats, ^ A rough plan of Sur will be found among the Government of India 's Foreign Proceedings for September 1908. See also Admiralty Chart No. 286—100 and Sfcetch Map of the Country round Sur, 1903* Foreign Proceedings for May 1905 may also be consulted.1848 stm and runs from south-east to north-west behind the town at a distance of 2 miles from the sea; and a plain, having the same direction as the ridge and lying behind it, which contains the lower course of Wadi Falaiu The entrance of the creek runs southwards, is half a mile long, 150 yards wide and has only | of a fathom in it at low water. The interior basin is about 2 miles in extent from east to west with several indenta tions ; at low tide it is practically dry. It follows that Sur cannot serve as a port except for vessels of the smallest size. The town of Sur consists of two large quarters separated by the entrance of the creek. That on the eastern side is 'Aiqa 'it consists of about 300 houses of the Bani Eu ^Ali tribe. On the opposite side is Muqraimatain , a large quarter of 1,500 houses inhabited by Jannabah. The houses in both quarters are mostly of mud and stone with stuccoed roofs, but there is also a proportion of huts; the Muqraima- tain quarter contains both the best houses and the largest number of huts&lt; There are no dat e-groves in the vicinity of those two quarters, which together compose the town of Sur Proper and have an aggregate population of about 9,000 souls; but livestock amount at ''Aiqa to 15 camels, 50 donkeys, 30 cattle and 150 sheep and goats, and at Muqraimatain to 8 horses, 40 camels, 200 donkeys, 85 cattle and 600 sheep and goats. Adjoining the north-west end of the stony ridge already mentioned, about IJ miles west of Muqraimatain and 4 a mile from the sea, is Sanaisalah ^ a village of 200 houses inhabited by the Ghafiri tribe of Bani Sinan, which, with another village Shaghi of 100 houses of the Jannabah. tribe on the coast to the north of it, may be regarded as a component part of Sur. Animals at Sanaisalah are 60 donkeys, 30 cattle and 80 sheep and goats; at Shaghi 15 donkeys, 10 cattle and 30 sheep and goats. The people of Sanaisalah and Shaghi are sailors and fishermen, owning 8 Baghlahs, 20 Badans and 15 smaller boats. On the plain at the back of the ridge, between the ridge and the bed of Wadi Falaij, is Bilad-as-Sur, jj-dl sh, a stone-built village with extensive date-groves and cultivation of lucerne, divided into about 7 quarters and comprising altogether some 250 houses of Masakirah, Hishm and other tribes, who supply the town proper of Sur with vegetables and fodder: Bilad-as-Sur is said to be a flourishing settlement and to possess 95 wells, 250 cattle and 150 donkeys. Part of Bilad-as-Sur is called Suq Sur One mile north-west of Bilad-as-Sur is a village called Jinah of 40 houses, mostly huts^ of Bani Bu Hasan of the Huwajir section ; it has 10 cattle tod 400 sheep and goats, and there is an old fort.SUE 1849 'rhere are two routes from Muqraimatain to Bilad-as-Sur; the inore direct follows the shore of the creek and crosses the stony ridge at its middle; the other, more circuitous, crosses the ridge near its east end. The inhabitants of Mucjraimatain obtain their drinking water from Bilad-as-Sur; from Jinah; from Sakaikarah a white-walled enclosuie with date-palms at the head of the Sur creek j and from Shamih ^ a spot on the east side of the creek to the south of ^Aiqa: the inhabtants of ^Aiqa depend chiefij on Shamih. Sur is the port of all Ja^alan and nearly all Sharqiyah : the celebrated dates of Badiyah. are shipped «t Sur. Imports at Sur arerice ; piece-goods, wheat and other grains, coffee, kerosene and other oils from Bombay and various Indian ports; ghi from Dhufar ; and tortoise-shell, shark-fins and dried fish, for re-export, from Masirah. The trade of Hadd and Masirah is entirely with Sur, and that of Kalhat is partly with Sur and partly with Masqat Town; but Daghmar and Quryat deal exclusively With Masqat. It is said that there were once 100 Hindu traders in Suq Sur^ but after the attack on that place in 1865 by Wahhabis^ Jannabahj etc;, in which one Hindu was killed and another wounded, they lost confidence, and now there remain (exclusive of dependents) only 7 in Mnqraimatain ; one in^Aiqa and one at Suq Sur. The sea-going vessels belonging to Sar and its suburbs are at present 50 Baghlahs, 4 Sambuq^ and 40 smaller craft, chiefly Badans. The slave trade still lingers here but in a much restricted condition. Sur is a troublesome and disturbed place in consequence partly of a perpetual feud which exists between the Bani Bu ^Ali of ''Aiqa and the Jannabah of Muqraimatain, partly of the insufficient conttol exercised by the Sultan of ^Oman, and partly of the way in which the inhabitants, in late years, have been encouraged by French agency to defy the Sultan's authority. The Sultan maintains a Walihere, but has no garrison in the town of Sur Proper. The following forts and posts in the environs are kept up by him, partially for the protection of the town and partially in order to control it by commanding its wiiter supply j— Name* Position, Strength of garrison.

The weakness of the Sultan's position at Sur is illustrated by the fact that from this place and from Hadd he only succeeds in realising about I^OOO a year as customs proper and $2,200 as Zakat, the whole of which is absorbed by the local expenses of maintaining his position, whereas if his power were firmly established he could collect (according to an estimate)- $50,000 per annum in customs from Sur alone. SUWADI Some small islands off the Batinah coast of the Oman Sultanate (JAZAIR)*' closely adjoining Has Suwadi on its west side, about midway between Barkah and Masna ; ah. The group consists of one large islet and 6 * A large scale delineation of these islands (with view) will be found in Chait No. 2371—228*SUWAIRAH smaller ones ^extending 2 miles east and west. The large islet, called Jabal 'Add s*, is the easternmost; it is more than i a mile long and more than J o£ a mile broad, and it rises 280 feet above the sea; the channel dividing it from Kas Snwadi is fordable at low water. The other islets westward of Jabal 'Add are from 50 to 150 feet high, and the only one of them deserving notice is the southernmost, Maqbarah : between it and the mainland is a partially sheltered anchorage, which is crowded in the date season and has been used as a headquarters for boats o£ the British naval squadron on detached duty. Also known as Hamidiyah Sirah Jazirah and Juwaimisah a village in Turkish 'Iraq on the right bank of the Tigris, 85 miles by river below Baghdad City. By officials the place is generally spoken of as Jazirah, and the name Hamidiyah is hardly ever used. The population of Suwairah is about 750 souls, of whom a proportion are Paili Kurds, 15 are Jews, and 15 are Oriental Christians. Of the present inhabitants 5 are British and 20 are Persian subjects. A town and port on the Batinah coast of the ' Oman Sultanate, 14 miles SUWAIQ west-north-west of Masna^ah and 22 miles east-south-east of Khaburah. lKj ** It is a compact place of 600 dwellings, all huts: the inhabitants are Suwalih, Baluchis and Persians; they live by sea-faring occupations and the cultivation of dates* There are 6 families of Khojahs and 7 Hindus. Suwaiq is one of the ports of Wadi Bani Ghafir. About 10 Baqarahs and 5 Badans are owned here and run to Masqat Town and the Persian Gulf j there are also 20 fishing boats. Date trees number about 8,000 ; irrigation is from wells* Animals are 100 camels, 90 donkeys, 150 cattle and 400 sheep and goats* The Sultan of 'Oman has a Wali here and a fort garrisoned by 25 men. Since 1901-02 the collection of taxes has been directly managed instead of being farmed; but as yet there is no revenue from customs proper and Zakat brings in about $2,000 per annum only, the whole of which is still spent locally in salaries, etc.1852 SUWAIBAS The soil of Suwairah is productive, but the facilities for irrigation are not adequate. Wheat and barley are the usual crops ; and ; when the river overflows, cultivation of maize, sesame, and peas also is under taken. Agricultural supplies not locally produced are generally brought across country from places in the Hillah. Qadha. The liquorice plant grows in abundance in the vicinity. The bazaar contains about 50 shops, and there are 3 merchants of substance and 1 goldsmith. An American liquorice-exporting firm has an agency here, and the Christians of the place are its employes. Suwairah is the headquarters of the Jazirah Qadha and the seat of a Qaim-Maqam who has under him a few civil police. In order to encourage the growth of a settlement here, the present Sultan of Turkey ordered free grants of land to be given in and around the place for a period of 10 years, which has now just expired; and to this fact the name of Hamidiyah owes its origin. There is a customs house and a passport examining station, and the Turkish army is represented by a captain and lieutenant of the Radifs; but the place is not, apparently, a regular Radif centre. An elementary school is maintained by the Government, and the Turkish river steamers stop here to deliver and take up mails. Much land on the opposite bank is owned by Muhammad Pasha, i)aghistani, of the Turkish army, who has much influence with the local Arabs and is sometimes employed to mediate between them and the Government. The Dairat-as-Saniyah has at present no land in the neighbourhood, but intends, it is said, to acquire some. There is a government reserved forest near Suwairah on the left bank of the Tigris. Suwairah is completely sourrounded by the country of the Zubaid tribe» A tract in the Ha^a Sanjaq ; it adjoins Jabal Taff, towards its southern end, upon the east side. Its border on the west is Jabal-at- Taff from the salient known as Naslatain-al-Farha to the south end of the range, dividing it from Summan; on the south it is terminated by the Hamrat-al-Judah hill ; on the east it is bounded by a line runmng' from Hamrat-al-Judah to Jabal Mathluth and separating it from Jau- as-Sa'adail&gt; and on the north it meets the Habl tract along a line connecting Jabal Mathluth and Naslatain-al-Farha. It should be remarked, however, that the Bedouins who would include the south-TlHIRI 1853 western part of Habl in Wadi-al-Miyah would deal similarly with Taff ; but the general opinion seems to be adverse to this view. Taff consists of low lying, rocky ground, which forms a strip at the foot of the hills similarly named. It contains the following 5 wells :— Name. Vernacular equivalent.

In English formerly called ' Taurie One of the Shibkiih ports of TAHIEJ the Persian Coast; it is situated about 20 miles south-east of Kangun ^57^ and 25 miles north-west of Naband. Tahiri lies in a small open bay, formed by low points 2 miles apart which project from the shore at either side of it and carry date-groves. The bay deepens regularly from the coast to 8 fathoms at | a mile off shore. The village is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range behind it, which is here 700 feet high. A square fort stands on a hill at the west end, about 100 feet above sea level. There are about 150 stones houses inhabited by Arabs and Persians of various tribes; the Arabs are in the majority and are Shafi'i Sunnis ; the Persians supply a Shi'ah element. Water is from wells 3 fathoms deep, and there are about 350 date-palms besides cultiva tion of wheat and barley. Livestock are 10 horses, 50 donkeys, 500 cattle and 100 sheep. Tahiri is the port of the Galehdar and Jam districts, immediately behind the maritime range, with which it is connected by passes practicable for camels and donkeys. The chief exports are tobacco and charcoal from Galehdar and salt-fish collected from the neighbouring coast villages. The people of Tahiri are merchants, sailors, fishermen, pearl-divers, cultivators and date-gardeners: they own 6 trading Sambuks, which run to 'Oman and Basrah as well as to Gulf ports, and1854. TAHIRI 4 fishing- ^Amilahs. In the neighbourliood is a small cape called Has Majnun^ off which is a pearl bank. There is a post of the Imperial Persian Customs at Tahiri. The hills inland of Tahiri, at a distance of 3 to 6 miles from the place; 1 1 are said to be occupied by a Baluchi tribe who possess a quantity of livestock^ chiefly sheep and goats, also a few date-palms, and who culti vate wheat, barley and maize, The only claim of Tahiri to distinction is the possession of prehistoric remains and early Muhammadan ruins. The sides of the ravines which come down from the hills on the north-west of the village are pierced with numerous chambers, most of which are inaccessible except by lad ders, and in one place the hillside over a space of half a mile square has been worked into tiers of remarkable troughs. This portion is inter sected by a ravine to which a flight of broad shallow steps, cut in the rough conglomerate rock ; descends on either side. Here and there pillars of natural rock have been left standing, and the largest of these has been hollowed out to form a chamber. There are many wells in the hillside, one of which is 204 feet deep and contains 36 feet of good water ; some of these wells are circular, some oblong, and the diameter is usually two or three feet; those furthest up the hill are the deepest. These remains are apparently pre-Islamic : the chambers appear to have been sepulchral, and some of them in 1857 still contained crumbling human bones. On a plain near the shore immediately to the west of Tahiri are the ruins of the old Muhammadan town, of Siraf extending for a mile or more along the coast and for some distance up the slope of the foot-hills. These are now mere heaps of rough masonry ; but foundations of houses, wells, and the remains of water-cislierns of the pattern still common on this coast— viz., oblong excavations lined with gypsum cement and vaulted over—'are still traceable. The whole extent of the ruins is strewn with broken pottery including many fragments of Chinese porcelain. The only building in a state of tolerable preservation is a mosque of well-cut stone and elegant design with pointed doors and windows. There are many ornamental monolithic tombstones bearing Kufic inscriptions: one of these^ now in the British Museum, bears a date equivalent to 991 A. D * * Accounts of the antiquities of Tahiri are given by Kempthorne in the Transac- tious of the Bombay Geographical Society, Yolume XVII (1857); by Colvillin a report forwarded to the Government of India with a letter No. 46 of 4th May 1866 by the Resident in the Persian Gulf ; and by Stiffe in the Journal of the Geo-raphical Society, Volume VI (1895) : the : last contains a sketch and ground-plan. Siraf was the principal emporium of the Persian (Mf in the 10th century of the Christiaix era aijdiil# Jiisffff' 1 TA1MAH 1855 { «o &gt; i\n oasis and town on the western frontier of the principality of Jabal Shammar, to which politically^ though not geographically, it belongs ; it lies almost 200 miles west of Hail and slightly over 200 miles north and a little west of Madinah. The altitude is some 8^120 feet above sea*- level. Taimah stands in the midst of a barren, undulating desert with protruding rocks and a sprinkling of ironstone shingle ; the actual site is a shallow, loamy flood-bottora ; the place is healthy, and fever is unknown. The town consists of three blocks detached and separately walled ; the principal is Haddaj in the centre, the others are Grharb ^ on the north and Sharq ^ on the souths The interior of each of these quarters consists of a labyrinth of shady lanes; the houses, many of which have an upper storey, do not as a rule form streets but stand apart, each surrounded by the date plantations belonging to the owner; the town consequently, in its general aspect, resembles one vast date grove. Less than a mile to the westward are the ruins of an ancient town, built of black basalt, including remains of columns. The population, now estimated at 2,000 souls, is Shammar; a colony, it is said, of Jabal Shammar which has been 200 years in existence. Though far removed in distance from the Shammar Dirah, the speech of the people of Taimah is still that of their ancestors, and like their kinsmen of Hail they are tall and ready of tongue. They go barefoot, but are well dressed in clothing from Turkish 'Iraq ; their women do not wear the veil. In character they are said to be shallow-minded, without fore sight or reflection. There are no beggars or destitute in the place. The surrounding Bedouins are 'Anizah of various sections : Shararat also pay annual visits to Taimah. Taimah is in the first place a date oasis ; its produce as such is ex cellent and includes the variety of date called Hilwah. Some of the palms are 90 feet high and are said to be 200 years old. Wheat, barley and very fine oats are grown, also millet and Duqsah, a small grain resembling Dukhn, but the cultivation of cereals is not extensive; the wheat and barley harvest is in the beginning of April. Fruits are figs, grapes, peaches, and pomegranates, and there is some was then oommercially a rival of Basrah, but it suffered severely by an earthquake in 977 A. D. and thereafter was gradually supplanted by Qais ; at the beginning of the 13th century A. D. Siraf was already reduced to a heap of ruins. The imports cf Siraf in the 10th century were aloes-wood (for burning), amber, camphor, precious gems, bamboos, ivory, ebony, paper, sandal-wood, and all kinds of Indian perfumes, drugs and condiments ; in the town itself excellent napkins were made, also linen veils, and it was a great market for pearls. See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliyhate, * See plan in Doughty (I, 287). TAIMAH &amp;.6jJ I I r U1856 T AIM AH tobacco. Cattle are few but poultry common. 'Water is abundant, clear, and agreeable to drink. The main well of Haddaj, from whieli the most of the plantations are watered, is on an enormous scale and is the most celebrated object at Taimah. The mouth has 4 unequal sides and is about 50 feet in diameter, the depth is about 40 feet; there are no less than 60 draw-wheel frames, and 48 camels are constantly employed in raising water. This well is in theory public property, but in practice it is controlled by several of the more influential families who mulct the others for its use. Landed property is of high value in Taimah owing to the security of the water supply, which never fails. Local manufactures are 'Abas, sleeping carpets of black wool with coloured borders, saddle-bags, goats'-hair cloth for making tents, and household utensils. There are a few shops, but they are usually rooms in private houses opening on the street. Taimah is a date-purchasing market for the Bedouins of the surrounding desert, who dispose here of part of their sheep, goats and pastoral produce. The imports are chiefly piece-goods, metals, spices and a few articles of European manufacture ; these are received partly through Hail and partly through Madinah. The currency consists of Riyals and Turkish coins, supplemented by camels and dates which are used for barter. In 1878 Taimah was governed in the name of the Shammar Amir by an African freedman, and the revenue realised from the town was $4,000 a year. Taimah is interesting chiefly on account of its ruins, which in 1883 yielded the celebrated Taimah stone, one of the most precious of Semitic monuments.* TAMIM An important and widely distributed Arab tribe of Central Arabia; (BANI) (I) they form one of the principal ingredients in the population, not only in Southern Najd, where perhaps the bulk of them are found, but also in Qasim and Jabal Shammar. Distribution.—In Hautah Bani Tamim are found at Hilwah and Quwai'; in Kharj at 'Adhar, Dilam, Na'ajan and Sulaimiyah; in 'Aridh at Dhrumah Proper and Mizahmiyah in Dhrumall, at 'Ammariyah, Dara'iyah, 'Arjah, Riyadh, Manfuhah and Masani' upon 'Wadi Hanifahj and at Haraimlah, Hizwah, Mahnqah, Sidus, Sufurrah and Thadiq in the * See Hogarth, pages 280-2.d at) i tit TAMlM (BANI) (I) 1857 Mahmal division of the district; in Sadair at ^Ashairah, 'Audah, Dakhilah, Dhalmah, ^ Harmah, Hasun, Hautah, Jalajil, Janubiyah, Khatamah, Kills, Majma', Raudhah, Ruwaidhah, Tamair, Tuwaim, and Wnshai; in Washam at Fara'ali, Haraiyiq, Qussab, Tharmidah and Washaiqir ; and in Wadi-as -Sirr at Faidhah. These are their principal settlements in Southern Najd. In Qasim they are numerous in the two capitals, Anaizah and Buraidah, as well as in a number of other villages ; and m Jabal Shammar they occur at 'Alaq, Qasr-al-'Ashlrwat, Faid, Qafar, Mnstajiddah, Samirah, Silaimi and Sab'an. Qafar is probably the northernmost place which they inhabit, unless, as is stated in one report, some are found at Jauf-al-'Amir also. Arabs who claim to be Bani Tamhn are found at places on the Persian Coast, e.g., in the Rud-hilleh district. Divisions and number.—The genealogical divisions of the Bani Tamim are of little importance, inasmuch as their tribal organisation has dis appeared and all of them are now attached to the soil. The following however, recognised as sections, have come to light in the course of our enquiries:— Husain Madhi (Al) Jl Majid Mu'ammar (Bin) j**-* ^ at Hautah in Nawasir Sadair. at Dhalmah in Sadair. Thamarah at Harmali and Raudhah T uwaim in Sadair. at JThadiq in Wahabah 'Aridh. at Sidus in Wahub 'Aridh. at Dhrumh, acd at Hautah and Majma* in Sadair. at Majma', in Kliarj, sl'c Majma 1 . at Riyadh. The total number o£ the Bani TamTm can be roughly ascertained from the list o£ villages given above. In all districts in which they are found they are included in the estimate of the fixed population. life and character.—ki the present day the Bani Tamim are entirely a settled tribe and have lost altogether those nomadic habits to which a proportion at least of nearly all other tribes cling. They are skilful and diligent agriculturists, seldom engaging in war and not often in trade. Those of Qasim and Jabal Shammar are physically more robust than the Bedouins by whom they are surrounded, and they have the spirit of industry and a good plain understanding; but they are heavy, dull ; mean and inhospitable, and sometimes they are ultra-religi ous, visiting Makkah as frequently as they have opportunity, 6 c18 58 TAMlM (BANI) (II) TAMIM A large and powerful Arab tribe, dwellers in tents, wbo range the (BANI) (II) dr i er p ar ts of the country between the Karun, Shatt-al-'Arab and ^ ^ Tigris Rivers; they are said to be of Mimtafik origin. In religion they are mostly, but not all, Sunni Muhammadans; and in their mode of life also they differ considerably from the other Arab tribes of Arabistan. Their territory in Southern 'Arabistan includes the right bank of the Karun between Milaihan and Sab''eh, and they may be found anywhere to the west of that line up to the Turkish frontier. In summer the bulk of the tribe approach the Karun; in the date season they encamp on the left bank of the Shatt^al-'Arab between Nashwah and Da'aiji, where many of them own date plantations; in winter and spring they occupy the western end of their country, but a few of the 'Ayaishah section sometimes encamp and cultivate in the cold weathei at Maqtu' on the Karun River and others more regularly appear at Qajariyeh. The Maqatif of the Jarrahi district are said to be a branch of the Bani Tamim. There is no estimate of the number of the tribe by sections, but their strength is reckoned at 1,000 unmounted and 2,000 mounted men, part of the latter being camel-riders and their total number of souls may therefore be about 10,000. They own some 2,500 camels, 1,400 horses and large numbers of donkeys, cattle, and sheep. They also cultivate wheat and barley. When in Southern 'Arabistan they pay revenue to the Shaikh of IVEulianimareh at the rate of 10 Qrans per cultivated Taddan as well as one-fourth of the actual gross produce. Their divisions are the Bam Malik to whom belong the ruling family ; the 'Awainat • the 'Ayaishah ; the Baraji'ah the Ghazaiwi LSjiy ; the Ohizli ^ ; the Ghizzi Jf : the Halaf Ji* ; the Hamid ' } the Hamudi &gt; the Bani Nahad the Bani Sakain J j ., and the Sulaiman . The correspondence of some of these names with those of sections of the Bani Saleh will be obseived. The Bani Tamim are now all enrolled in the A1 Bu Kasib division of the Muhaisin tribe; the 'Awainat and the 'Ayaishah divisions have been so affiliated to the Muhaisin for some years. TANAIJ Or Tanaiq jssh : singular, Tanaiji 1 ^ Sd , An Arab tribe of Trucial 5 Oman 5 their principal places are Rams (400 houses) and Dhaid (70 houses), and a few are found at Hamriyah. They have exclusive posses-TANG I STAN 1859 sion of Rams, and Dhaid is the chief centre of their nomad sections, whose fighting men are said to number 5U0. The settled portion of the tribe may perhaps be estimated at 2,500, and the nomadic at 1,500 souls. The Tanaij belong to the Grhafiri faction and are Hanbali Sunnis in religion. _ This distri ^ o£ the Persian Coast, which belongs to the province of Pars, is somewhat irregular in shape. Its maximum length from north to south is about 40 miles and the northern half has a breadth inland of about 20 miles, but the southern half is merely a narrow strip upon the coast. Limits* The northern boundary is a line running east and west a few miles south of the important village of Chah Kutah and dividing the district from Dashtistan. The western boundary is the Mashileh of Bushehr and, further south, the coast of the Persian Grulf. The peri' meter is completed by a line which, commencing at the north-east corner of the district, follows the crest of the main maritime range until it has passed several miles beyond Ahram and then crosses to the summit of a subsidiary maritime range, much nearer to the sea, along which it continues southwards for about 20 miles, finally running down to th6 coast a little south of the Baraki group of villages and north of Qalat in Dasllti* Khaiz* jjukk in the upper valley of the Ahram stream is attach ed to the district, but does not belong to it geographically. Physical chcircict6Tistics.~~' T Y\ie great maritime range where it adjoins Tangistan is of no great elevation, the highest point being Kuh-i- Qal'eh-i-Dukhtar «/ (better known locally as Kuh Gugardi ), which is 3,938 feet high and is situated a f ew miles to the north-east of the Tangistan capital of Ahram. A spring of extremely hot water is said to issue from the western face of Kuh Gugardi and to be adjoined by deposits of sulphur. An important feature of the district proper is the Ahram or Bahush stream, which has its exit from the hills on the south side of Kuh Gugardi and, leaving the town of Ahram on its right bank, runs north west and joins the Chah Kutah stream of the Dashtistan district a few * Kbaiz, though possessing apparently the best water and orchards in the KLan's jurisdiction, has been omitted from the Gazetteer as lying beyond the maritime plain. 6 o 21860 TAN GIST AN miles above the point where the latter empties itself into the swamps near Bushehr Town, A short way below Ahram Town this stream has a channel width of 100 yards^ the right bank being- 20 feet high, of a tenacious white clay, while the left bank is lower and more shelving ; but the breadth of the actual stream is ordinarily about 30 feet and its depth 1 foot only: it is believed however to be liable to sudden floods after rain in the hills. Part of the district is irrigated from this stream. The surface of the Tangistan district would be flat and open through out, as it is in its northern part, were it not for the accident of a consider able sandstone range which, ranning parallel to the sea at the distance of a mile or two inland, divides the southern portion of the district into an inland valley and a littoral tract. These three physical features, the inland valley, the coastal range and the maritime strip, are all prolonged southwards into the Dashti district. The inland valley is cultivated, under the hills, and a chain of small villages depending on cultivation extends down each side of it. The coastal range has a length of over 50 miles and belongs as much to the Dashti district as it does to Tangistan : its most general name appears to be that of Kuh-i-Mund My* sy, derived probably from the Mund River upon which its southern extremity abuts; but it is also called Kuh-i-Kar ft because parts of it are capable of being cultivated. The northernmost point of Kuh-i-Mund is only 467 feet high ; but at the middle of its length, behind the coast village of Bulkhair, the range attains a height of a,68a feet. It is crossed in one or two spots by passes leading from the coast to the Tangistan Valley and Khurmuj. Where the district is flat the surface is generally an alluvial clay, often covered with good natural grazing and sometimes cultivated with cereals, and travelling is rendered difficult by mud in wet weather. The water of the Ahram stream is almost undrinkable except in rainy weather, and in the hot season the water supply everywhere depends upon wells. The climate and seasons of Tangistan resemble those of Dasllti. The Tangistan coast possesses no remarkable features ; off it the tidal stream is so weak as often to be imperceptible. Foflulation.—lLh.Q population of Tangistan may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls. The people belong to various little known tribes among which are the Darhlru &gt; Darshamal , Gutu , J amm^li f Khadaru &gt; Puladi j Zanganeh and Zandabud , but they are generally spoken of m the aggregate as Tangistanis. The Zandabud are said to havefctlll TANGISTAN 1861 immigrated from the neigWbourliood of Shiraz ; the Zanganeh to have come from central Persia or Afghanistan,, and the Puladis (of whom the Khan is one) to be settlers from Central Arabia^ but the last are now completely Persianised. The name Grutu means a largein the Tangis- tani dialect; the Gutus and Jammalis are always at feud. The Khadaru tribe is also called Zair Khizar yl} . The Zanganeh are reckoned a brave tribe. In religion the Tangistanis are Shi'ahs and their language is a dialect of Persian. Notwithstanding their nearness to Bushelir Town, they still live in a rude and uncivilised state; blood-feuds flourish amongst them and their name continues to be ; in Bushehr Town, a synonym for lawlessness, brutality and ignorance. The houses in the villages are mostly huts of date leaves plastered with mud, but some are built of stones. The people are poor in consequence of their perpetual wars. There are about 2 rifles to every 3 houses. Agriculture and trade, —The district is entirely agricultural and is reckoned highly fertile. The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates, to which may be added water melons, cucumbers of two kinds (Balang and Khiyarzeh) and onions. Fruits are lemons, sweet limes, pomegranates and a kind of orange (Naranji) which is grafted on the lemon. Part of the district is irrigated from the Ahram stream. There is no internal or external trade unless we reckon a small uncertain export of dates and of other fruits from the hills, such as pomegranates, grapes, lemons, oranges and citrons, and a more regular export of locally manufactured Gach or gypsum cement. A poor kind of woollen cloth for making ^Abas is the only local manufacture. The currency consists of ordinary Persian Qrans and copper change, and the standards of weight throughout the district are a Man of 8 lbs. 4 oz, English and a Hashim Man of 16 Mans or 132- lbs, English. Communications and transport, —The only routes traversing the district are one from Buslielir vi® AllTcini to Jahrum and .Fasa and the coast-route from Bushelir to Bandar 'Abbas; neither is of much importance, and the latter is of course unable to compete with sea- carriage. The journey from Ahram to Burazjan presents no difficul ties, but the road crosses a spur of the hills between Abad and SamaL The transport of the Tangistan district has been calculated at 150 horses, 60 mules, 850 camels and 2,500 donkeys. Adminittratiorb* —Tangistan belongs to the province of Fars. The total revenue is 10,300 Tumans a year, for the whole of which the Khan 1 » 1 .1862 TANGISTAN o£ Tangistan, at present Haidar Khan^ is responsible; he pays 7^300 Tumans a year to the Governor-General of Fars and 3^000 Tumans to the Nizam-as-Saltaneh, who holds Ahrani; Khaiz and Abad in Tiyul. The residence of the Khan, who belongs to the Puladi tribe, has for at least 40 years been at Ahram ; it is said to have been formerly at Tangistan village. In Tangistan there is no pretence of government, a deficiency which is attributed to the backward condition of the people and their intractable character; but Saiyids and Mullas are respected and dispense a kind of rudimentary civil justice, as they do in other districts. The Khan is badly off in consequence of the unsettled condition of the country, but by leasing the villages of the district to their headmen he manages to realise a considerable revenue. The incidence of the land tax is about 26 Qrans per Gau of cultivation; date trees are subject to a tax of J a Qran each per annum ; and there is a poll tax on residents of 50 Qrans a year and on new settlers of 25 to 30 Qrans. At the coast there is a tax on boats. The rule of the present Khan is considered oppressive, and of late there has been much emigration from his territory to the Bushehr Peninsula.

Its length is 8 miles or more ; but it is very narrow, its breadth in places not exceeding 100 yards; and near its extremity it is exceedingly low. There is an anchorage just within the point of the cape where Turkish Government vessels visiting Qatif generally lie, and near which, on the shore, the Turks maintain a coal dep6t. A great meeting of tides takes place off Has Tanu- rah ; the courses of the currents are complicated but the general result ^ appears to be a division of the tides, for the flood stream south of the cape f sets to southwards, and north of it to north-westwards in the direction of Kuwait. At the extremity of Has Tanurah is a pearl bank, known as ^TARtTT 1871 wH ,u ,,,l ' i 2?^ rv. vzz, Umm Raliim, immediately north of which upon the coast are others, (in order from south to north), Duwaiyisain, Abu 'Adhum, Abul ^Uruq and Ja'aimah. An island in Qatif bay, of which the part nearest to the coast is about 2 miles east-north-east of Qatlf Town; it forms part of the Turkish Sanjaq of Hasa. At low water it is connected with the mainland by a ford about | a mile north of the Kut of Qatif. The island measures about 4} miles each way and about J of it is covered with date groves : the western side, however, has no trees. The whole island is irrigated and supplied with drinking water by two fine springs situated near the centre, in the lands of Tarut village : the water of these is hot, but excellent. The total population of the island may be about 4,000 persons : the following table gives the villages with the tribes of the inhabitants and some other particulars.

Very little is known of this remote tract except that it belongs to the Qahtan tribe; but it is stated to be bounded on the south-west by hills called Jabal 'Amk and on the south-east by a ridge known as Jabal Jahar . According to the same authority it contains a detached hill styled Jabal Kilab and villages (or perhaps camping grounds) known as Habaiyah oj ^9- f Hamzah , J ash l /'U. , Maraighan &gt; Murabba^ , Nahamsah and Qasr Bin-Toq Jjl* . The Qahtan of Wadi Tathlith are said to profess allegiance to Ibn Sa^ud.TAWAILAH 1873 A valley nsmg m the Western Hajar of the 'Oman Sultanate and reaching the Batinah coast not far from Rumais ; it is to the west of Wadi Lajal. Wadi Tau contains only one village of importance, that of Tau j-b ;it consists of 300 mud houses of the Bani Jabir, partly of the Aulad Rashid section, and lies some 10 or 13 miles inland from Rumais. Dates aie the principal if not the only form of cultivation and the groves contain 10,000 trees. There are 70 camels, 100 donkeys, 50 cattle and 800 sheep and goats. The trade of Wadi Tau is with Sib and Barkah. Tau is one of the capitals of the Bani Jabir, and the chief Shaikh there is Saif-bin Snlaiman. A long narrow island adjoining the left bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab, forming a continuation virtually of 'Ajairawiyah, and itself prolonged downstream by ShamshamiyaL Tawailah begins about 10| miles by liver below the British Consulate at Basrah and ends about 6 miles above the junction of the Karun and the Shatt-al -'Arab ; its length between ^ ese points is 5J miles^ while its average breadth is i of a mile or less. It fronts the village of Labani ; the creek of Abul Khasib, and the tracts of Abu Ibgai^ and Abul Fulus ; and partially that of Baljaniyah^ on the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab ; and on the other side nearly the whole stretch from Nahr Jasim down to the Turco-Persian frontier is subtended by it. Tawailah is part of Turkish 'Iraq. The only village on Tawailah appears to beknown as Shiraji; it stands jjgilflet#! 0I1 nor th shore of the island about midway between its two extremities luiuM and consists of about 50 huts of the so-styled Mashid tribe, and its agri^ cultural resources are estimated at 10,000 date palms besides other fruit yitis^ trees, 30 cattle, and 50 sheep and goats. About 50 other families of Mashid are scattered over the rest of the island, most of their huts being p. |p near the southern shore : these cultivate wheat and other cereals, possess IjjJakl ® fruit gardens and about 10,000 date palms, and own 50 cattle and an equal number of sheep and goats. ' 31 It would seem that in 1836 the lower part of Tawailah island was i non-existent^ and that the upper part of it was then connected with the present island of 'AjairawiyaL 6 D1874 TAWAIEJJ Also called Hindiyali fosyb. a town and municipality in Turkisli 'Iraq, standing upon both banks of tbe Hindiyah. at 13 miles below its bead. Most of Tawairij is on the right bank of the stream and^ the environs being 1 low, is protected on the three landward sides by an embankment ^hich circles round it at a radius of a few minutes^ walk. The quarter on the left bank, consisting of some mud houses, a few shops, and a good Khan owned by a Jew of Baghdad, is connected by a boat bridge of 21 pontoons with the main town. The latter contains numerous juasonry buildings and all the public offices, Tawairij thirty years ago was merely a small village and the centre of a rice^growing tract; it is now a considerable town. The population is about 4,000 souls, of whom nearly all are Shfah Arabs; there are however some 40 Persians, 60 Jews, 50 Turks, 10 Panjabi Indians and Afghans regarded as British subjects, and half-a-dozen Oriental Chris tians. There are 8 mosques and 4 Khans. The staple business to which, in conjunction with political and admi nistrative causes, Tawairij owes its present position has now declined; for, in consequence of the general drying up of the country round, half of the tract formerly under rice is now thrown entirely out of cultivation, while the rest only produces crops such as barley and wheat. The produce tax payable to the government has fallen to about one-third of its former amount. Tawairij, however, shows no symptoms of commercial decay and is still to a large extent an entrep6t for rice brought from other places. Shops number about 150. Manchester piece-goods, received from Baghdad, are the only valuable import; some other foreign goods are received direct from Basrah; exports other than rice are chiefly dates, barley, wheats and wool. The 'Allizah tribe from the Shamiyall Desert visit Tawairij in large numbers to make their annual purchases of food and clothing. Camels can be had only when the 'Anizah are in the neighbourhood, but a considerable number of horses and donkeys are procurable in the district, as also buffaloes, cattle, sheep and goats. About 20 boats of the size ordinarily in use on the Hindiyah are as a rule obtainable at Tawairij. Tawairij, in addition to the ordinary appurtenances of a Qadha head quarters. has a telegraph-office connected by a single wire with the towns oi Hillah. and Karbala : the department of Public Debt and the Tobacco Regie are each represented by a Mamur. There is also a harbour master. The military force at present consists only of 75 Radifs under 3 officers:TAYlN (WADI) 1875 the town is the headquarters of the 2nd battalion of the 84jtb regiment of Eadif.

Wadi Tayin rises a few miles to the north-west of Najd Wasit ; ^ on the opposite side of that pass from WadiMansah, and runs at first to the south-east for 25 miles between two high ranges till it reaches Ghubrat-at-Tam; then, turning at right angles towards the north-east and assuming successively the names of Wadi Dhaiqah and Wadi Hail , it breaks out of the hills and reaches the sea at Daghmar after a further course of about 27 miles.

Ghubrah is protected by an oblong fort at the western extremity of a hill. A small ham let called Tul adjoining Ghubrah, was practically de populated in the cholsra. epidemic of 1899 and has caased to exist as a village.TAYlN fWADJ) 1879 As far as this place the Wadi is broad and straight, and is enclosed between two parallel ranges of hills which present a remarkable contrast to one another. The range on the north-east side is called Jabal Baidhah ^ U) or Baiyadh ; it consists of limestone in horizontal strata and appears to have a table-top; its height has been estimated at 3,000 feet. It is arid and sterile in aspect, but is said to support a large number of shepherds with their flocks ; the hollows and crevices conceal much thorny undergrowth and coarse herbage. While Jabal Baidhah is distinguished by its light colour, the range of Jabal Halwi which faces it across the valley is equally remarkable for the darkness of its hue and differs no less from Jabal Baidhah in its general configuration, which is rugged and intricate. The ravines in the slopes of these mountains contain some of the villages oi Wadi Tayin, but others extend along the fertile bed of the valley, their orchards and plantations fringing it at intervals for miles and alternating with scenes of desolation and stretches of barren rock. In the bottom of the valley there is no continuous stream ; but water is perennial and abundant, now above the surface and now below. The vast assemblage of date-palms is very strik ing, and grapes, peaches, apricots, custard-apples, guavas, figs, pome granates, plums, limes, sweet limes, quinces, oranges, bananas, citrons, mangoes, melons and mulberries are grown with success. Here, besides the ordinary grains and vegetables of 'Oman, are found tur meric, sugarcane, bastard saffron and henna. At Ghubrat-at-Tam the direction of Wadi Tayin changes to north east, and 4 a mile from Ghubrah it enters an extraordinary cafion and becomes Wadi Dhaiqah. A quarter of a mile down the canon occurs a sudden drop in the bed of the valley, where men and baggage are lowered with ropes, and camels are sent round by a circuitous track on the left bank, involving a delay of an hour. At the end nearest Ghubrah the width of the gorge is only 100 yards and further down it varies from 150 to 500, the cliffs on either side rising sheer to 1,000 and even 1,500 feet. This deep and narrow section of the valley is liable to sudden and dangerous floods, and even at ordinary times there is a considerable flow of water which increases in volume as it descends. It is this canon which, seen from the sea, has obtained among English mariners the name of the &lt;f DeviFs Gap. 0 * The Wadi Dhaiqah section continues narrow for about 6 miles and opens out about 4 miles before Mazara', elsewhere described under its own name, is reached. * A distant view from the sea of Devil's Gap will be found in Chart No. 238;;r88 and another in No. 2373-2837 A,1880 TAYlN (WADI) About 10 miles below Mazara' is Hail-al-Ghaf, which forms the subject of a separate article^ and here the name of the valley is ^ changed to Wadi Hail ; indeed nowhere below Grhubrah is it called Wadi Taym. The coast is reached at Daghmar about 7 miles below M Hail-al-Ghaf. ^ The entire settled population of Wadi Tayin amounts, apparently, to about 8,600 souls. Wadi Tayin has only two tributaries of any importance, both on its right bank; these are Wadi Dima, which joins it at Sidafi, and Wadi Khabbali, which comes in at Ghubrah. Wadi Tayin forms a sort of vestibule to Sharqiyah ; it is entered by routes from the Masqat District over the ^Amdah and Manqal passes and by a route from Wadi Mansah over the Wasit pass; on the other side routes to Sharqiyah leave it at Malahlah and Ghubrah. All these routes are said to be passable for camels. . mni The trade of Wadi Tayin is partly with Quryat and partly with Matrah and Masqat Town. TIGRIS The eastern and now the more important, at least with reference to or communications, of the two great rivers of Turkish 'Iraq ; it is the nearer filJLAH * to the Persian frontier, it is the highway to Baghdad from the Persian Gulf, and it offers at the present time greater facilities for navigation than the Euphrates ; but as a source of irrigation it is probably of less value. The general direction of its flow is from north-west to south-east, like that of the Euphrates, but both above and below Baghdad it deviates in a curve to the north-east of the direct line, and in this respect its behaviour is contrary to that of the twin river. The Tigris is the Hiddekel of the Bible and the present name (Dijlah) Represents the last two syllables of that word. * Authorities. ^-The information contained in this article was partly supplied by Col, L.S. Newmarch and Major J. Earn say, Political Residents at Baghdad, and partly obtained by the writer on the spot from Sir W. Willcocks and from Messrs. Braine and Cowley of the E. T. S. N. Company's service. The best existing maps of the Tigris are Chesney's of 1833 ; Felix Jones's of 1849-50 (in Bombay Selections XLI1I), and Selby, Collingwood, and Bewsher's of 1860-65, but they are about to be superseded: the first is of the whole river, the second of the portion from Tikrit to Kut-al-Amarah, and the third of the part from Kadhimain to Kut-al-Amarah. The most elaborate survey yet made of the river Tigris between Baghdad and Qurnah was carried out by Lieut. A. Hamilton, of the ' Comet ' in 1906-07 and completed by Lieut. Gardner, R.I.M., in 1907 ; the resulting map has not yet been published, but the principal data obtained in the survey are embodied in the last paragraph of the present article. Some information about the river is contained in the Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1899.flu TIGRIS 1881 General course and character.—The source of the Tigris is in Armenia and after passing Musal the of the Wilayat of that name, it enters the tract with which we are concerned at Samarrah. The following is a tabular account of its course in the names given being those of the principal places on its banks;— Name. 1! tr{||| Tikrifc «44 ^ lib Samarrah rtii (1)1 On which si^e situated, (2) distance by stream and (3) direction from tbe last place.

The town stands inland from a high hank and is in visible from the other side of the river where the land is lower ; the eastern bank is 70, the wes tern 30 feet high. The Sanitary and Public Debt Depart ments and the Tobac co Eegie are repre sented at Samarrah. Many of the houses are empty and the place seems to be declining. There are several tine mosques. The Persian Govern ment is represented by a paid Naib Kar- pardaz or Consular Agent. There is a carriage service between Samarrah and Baghdad. The ruins of a tower, probably a Sassanian structure. E emaeks. The people are poor and mostly inhabit mud and stone huts. Supplies are obtain able in moderate quantities only. Samarrah is the burial place of the 10th and 11th Imams and consequently a place of Shi'ah pilgrimage. It was founded by the Khalifah Mo'ta- sim, who transferred his residence thither from Baghdad in 836 A.D., and it remained the seat of the 'Abbasid empire until 892 A.D., when the ruling Khalifah returned to Bagh dad. The original (Aramaean; name of the place, Samarra U&gt; JycU- was officially changed to ' Sarra Ui man raa ' (= who behold it rejoices), but it is now written and spelt as above. The river is here 460 yards wide when full, and the current is normally 3 miles an hour. There is a bridge here vary ing in length from 32 to 55 boats. The second or lower head of the ancient Nahrwan canal was at this place.1882 TIGRIS 1 Kadhimain f Town and Mu'adhdham (1) On which side situated (2) dibtauce by stream and (3) direction, from the last place- Left bank. 4 miles.

Not to be confounded with the battlefield of the same name near iNajaf Town, The barriers appear to have been natural, consisting of a hatd conglomerate, bat they may have been increased in height by artificial works. The disappearance of the conglomerate foundations appears to have resulted from the erosion by the river of a clay bed on which they rested. The ancient city of Opis probably stood somewhere in this neighbourhood. Cap tain Felix Jones would identify with its site a place now called Manjur which is 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of the Tigris at a point opposite the mouth of the 'Adhaim.

About here a large canal takes off from the right bank of the river and is understood to run across Mesopotamia a long way to wards _ Stiq-ash- Shuyukh ; this is apparently the Ma jar Minshad mentioned in a paragraph below. A canal from the left bank goes off from the river at the middle of the town. Another called Ghumaijah Aar^^by which surplus water returns from the marshes to the river, joins the Tigris on the left bank about 22| miles below Qal'at Salih and a little below a sharp bend in the river, at a place called Mantari?, which is known to Europeans as the Devil's Elbow. The reach from Qal'at Salih above down to fchis place is known as the Marshes. The sea tides cease to affect the level of the river at a place Humaiyan , a few miles only below 'Azair. This reach also is swampy. I m m e - diately below Qurnah Village the Tigris unites with the Euphrates to form the Shatt-al -'Arab.6 |) TIGRIS 188S T e distances given in the above table are by river and are onlv approximate 5 * the direct distances by land, especially in the part between Baghdad and Kut-al-AmSrab, are much less and on the average are hardly more than half of those by water, ^ nri Tlie | eneral W1&lt; i th of the Tigris above 'Amarah Town is from 200 to 400 yards, but below 'Amarah it is greatly reduced in consequence of the absorption of water by canals; in the Marshes, between QaFah SaHh and Azair, its average breadth is only 60 to 70 yards; but in the reach from Azair to Qurnah Village it expands again to about 100 yards in J consequence of the return of some water from the adjoining swamps. The banks from Baghdad down to ^Ali-al-Gharbi vary in height from 5 to 20 feet, and are generally abrupt and only occasionally shelving ; near 'Ali-al-Gharbi they rise 15 to 20 feet above the lowest summer level of the river. In the Marshes the swamps which skirt the river are divided from it by a firm bank, which sometimes, however, is awash • and for some distance both above and below this section the banks are but little above water level. Below Baghdad the bed of the Tigris is all of mud and sand, with a little red clay in places. The country traversed by the Tigris below Baghdad is chiefly pastoral, inhabited by semi-settled Arabs whose villages o£ reeds and matting frequently stand upon the very bank. Except in the Marshes, buffaloes, cattle, ponies and large flocks of sheep, mostly brown, are to be seen in every direction ; and the Marshes themselves are alive with wild Pig- The water of the Tigris contains some salt, sulphur and lime in solution, and it is never clear; but it is drinkable at all seasons of the year. Irrigation, —The Tigris, less constant in its flow and running in a deeper bed, is probably inferior to the Euphrates as a source of irri gation. There is, however, a considerable similarity between the two rivers; for the Tigris has the same average gradient as the Euphrates, # The results of the latest survej (1906-07) appear to indicate that the course of the river is now longer than had ueen supposed even by those employed on it, from whom the distances between the main points in the above table were obtained. According to a preliminary forecast the distance from Baghdad to Basrah may now prove to be more nearly 496 th »n 448 miles, 2 miles of tho increase bein^ above Shaikh Sa'ad, 24 miljs between that place and 'Araarah Town, and 22 miles below 'Amarah Town. Tnis is still uncertain ; but comparison with older sarveys shows that, in places at least, the course of the river h *8 be ome more crooked and therefore longer.1890 TIGRIS or about 1 in 13,000, and the same average velocity; while the diagram of periodical increase and decrease given in the article on the Euphrates will serve approximately for the Tigris also. But the rise of the Tigris in flood is greater than that of the Euphrates and may amount at Baghdad to 6^ metres. The minimum discharge of the Tigris at Baghdad has been calculated at 250 cubic metres per second, and the maximum at the same place at 5,000 to 6,000 metres. Moods in the Tigris ordinarily arrive a week in advance of the corresponding floods on the Euphrates, and the level of the Tigris has been known to rise by 12 feet in a single day. The Tigris carries much silt, and in winter and spring it runs a rich brown in colour. In ancient times an extensive system of perennial irrigation was dependent on the Tigris and had for its two principal features the Nahr- wan or Nahrawan and Dujail canals, to both of which reference has been made in the table in. the preceding paragraph. The Nahrwan, which had a course of about 140 miles from Qaim to 'Aziziyall on the eastern side of the river, or possibly of 200 miles to the neighbourhood of Kut-al-Amarah, was constructed so as to inter cept the ^ Adhaim and other torrents from the Persian hills; and Sir W. Willcocks, the designer of the Assouan Barrage, has pronounced it to be an engineering work as bold in its conception as the canals of the ancient Egyptians were ingenious. The Nahrwan was destroyed by a change in the course of the Tigris which closed in upon its flank from the south and swept part of it near the head entirely away : the lower part of it had ceased to be operative by the 13th century of the Christian era, probably before the failure of the uppermost section. The Dujail on the south side of the river, probably less ancient, had originally a bed width of 40 metres, but it is now reduced to 3 : this canal has been once more brought into operation on a small scale by the Dairat-as- Saniyah. The only other ancient channel supplied by the Tigris was the present Shatt-al -Gharaf, perhaps natural and not artificial in its origin. Immediately before the Muhammadan conquest of ' Iraq, probably about 600 A.D., the main stream of the Tigris was diverted into the Shatt-al -Gharaf, through which it continued to flow until about 1550 A.D.; but Newberie (in 1581 A.D. ) and Tavernier (in 1652 AD.) seem to have travelled by the present course of the river, to which it had by then returned. There is no modern irrigation, except on a small scale from the Tigris aoove Kumait ; and below that point, though there is much, it is wasteful and inefficient. The Bitairah canal on the right bank several milesTIGRIS 1891 above ' Amarah Town and the JahSlah on the left bank at that place itself are said to carry off between them nearly half of the river; but most of the water which they take is wasted and merely goes to form swamps. From ; Amarah down to QaPat Salih. there are many canals thiownoff on both banks^ some of which are Dairat-as-Samyah property; among the best known is the Majar on the right bank, which is said to reach to the Euphrates and is at present the property of Shaikh Saihud of the A1 .Bu Muhammad tribe. Then come the Marshes, and below the Marshes the flow in side-canals ; such as the Ghumaijah, is generally of water returning from the swamps to the river. It has been suggested that waterlogging in this tract could probably be reduced if the heads of the canals were reconstructed facing down stream, instead of opening upwards—as at present—to receive the current; but the Turkish Government are either too apathetic, or they too greatly dread a conflict with the tribesmen, to undertake such an experiment. Navigation, —The steam navigation of the Tigris is troublesome, though not difficult or dangerous, and it is carried on by night as well as by day. The general course of the river, which is nearly the same as at the survey of 1836, appears to be little liable to alteration, no doubt in consequence of the banks being well held together by vege* table matter; but many and considerable modifications have taken place in the smaller bends and windings during the last 70 years. The navigable channels are constantly changing and the steamers are steered by eye, men being sent off to sound only when the channel ahead is not apparent. As the river bed consists of pure and soft alluvial matter, no regard is paid to occasional contact of the steamer with banks or bottom, and she feels her way along on all but the darkest nights. The river begins to rise with the melting of the snow in the moun tains about the end of March and is at its best for navigation during April: in the middle of May it commences to decline and it is lowest in August and September. Freshets due to rain in the hills at its source may occur at any time between November and February. The current varies from half a knot with a low river to 7 or 8 knots with a full one, and it is most powerful where the channel bends. The influence of the sea tides extends, as mentioned in the table above, to a place Humaiyan which is about 30 miles by water above Qurnah. 6B?1892 TIGRIS In the swampy tract from Qurnah up to 'Azair there is a depth of no^ less than 1% feet, but some of the turns are so sharp that a vessel more than 2^0 feet in length could not negotiate them. In the Marshes proper, from ^Azair to Qal ; at Salih, the river is at its narrowest with a navigable channel of only 25 to 50 yards; in this section there is no place where a steamer of ^0 feet could go about, and two steamers cannot pass one another without one tying up to the bank. The channel here is shallow in a low river. The unsatisfactory character of this reach is due to the numerous canals,—some of them 20 to 30 yards across at the head,—between Qal^at Salih and 'Amar ah Town which, after the river has lost nearly half its water above 'Amarah, absorb perhaps one-third of the remainder; conversely the improvement below the Marshes is due, as already indicated, to the return of part of the water by circuitous courses to the parent stream. The channel through the Marshes is deteriorating and has lost about one-fourth of its breadth during the last ten years. Above the Marshes the depth and width of the channel are both as a rule satisfactory, and from ; A mar ah Town to 'Ali-ash-Sharqi there is always 8 feet of water even with a low river. There are three or four bad reaches after this before Kut-al-Amarah is reached ; but the worst on the upper river are above Kut and are usually those known as Sharshar or Sharish, Shidhaif, Lajj, Khannasah, Jirf-al-Battah ; and Qusaibah; the shallowest sounding obtained at low river in tbis part is generally 3 feet and the place (or places) where it occurs varies from year to year. These reaches^ as will appear from the general table ia the first paragraph of this article and from the special table in the paragraph below ; are sometimes more extensive than the river-bank localities from which they take their names. The banks having been denuded of wood, except where there are Government forests, fuel is not now obtainable by the way. The Turks maintain Nuqtahs akiu or small police posts on the banks at short intervals from 5 miles above Qal'at SSlih down to Ezra's Tomb ; but the river, in spite of these, is not always entirely safe. When the local Shaikhs have differences with the Turkish Government, native crait, especially Mahailahs being towed along the bank, are liable to depredation, and at such times an official order prohibiting the carriage of valuable goods by boat is not uncommon; steamers however are never molested.TIGRIS 1893 Topography of the hanhs with especial reference to irrigation and navigation,* The following table contains a more precise description of the course of the river than the general table above; it may be useful in connection with questions of irrigation and navigation.

The Bani Turuf have from time to time resisted the authority of the Shaikh of Muhammareh in the Hawizeh District; but without much success* They are generally characterised as thieves and robbers^ This mountain range, of which the name is frequently pronounced Tuwaij or Itwaij, is the dominant feature of Southern Central Arabia and divides the districts of Southern Najd into an eastern and a western group. For convenience of description we may distinguish the northern part of the range from the southern^ dividing Tuwaiq at the point where it is crossed by the route between the villages of ; Ayainah and Barrah in the ^Aridh district. Northern Tuwaiq. —The northern division of Tuwaiq is perhaps a plateau rather than a chain of hills; it contains most of the villages of TUWAIQ (JABAL)1912 TUWAIQ (JABAL) the Sadair district besides those of the Mahmal division of 'Aridh, and in describing the physical features of those districts a good deal has been said about its configuration which need not be repeated here. In the north the range begins somewhere to the north-east of Zilfi; on the east side of which it passes. Near its north-western corner it has four spurs or outliers which are rounded in succession on the way from Zilfi to Ghat: they are Khashm Samnan cZ-U**, Khashm Imlaih Khashm Iswais and Khashm A'dhaidan • to these may be added Khashm 'Arniyah , at the foot of which lies Ghat. Of the better known valleys of Sadair only the northernmost, that of Ghat, leaves Jabal Tuwaiq in a westerly direction; the other three, namely, those of Majma^ and Tuwaim and the Batin-as Sadair or jsh hollow, all go eastwards. From this it may perhaps be inferred that the major portion of Tuwaiq in the Sadair district drains to the east, and that the western slopes are here shorter and more abrupt. To the south-west of Majma' there is a group of 5 peaks called Mishqar jzt** which are said to command a view of the W a sham district to the south ; and about 15 or 20 miles to the south-east of Tamair is an unusually high portion of the range. In the 'Aridh. district it is necessary to distinguish between the main range and a subsidiary range which goes off to the south-eastwards. The main range passes southwards by Haraimlah, which is situated apparently on or near its watershed ; and the surface of the plateau seems, from the number of valleys and villages on both sides, to be more equally divided than it is in Sadair between the eastern and the western slopes. On its eastern side this main range is said to merge in the plain along a curving line marked by the villages of Dqalah, Diqail, Mahriqah, Malham and Sidus. At the southern limit which we have assigned to the section now under discussion we find the Haisiyah hollow, which goes to form Wadi Hanifahj descending the eastern slope of Tuwaiq; while on the other side at the same point a smaller torrent bed, also called Haisiyah, goes down to the plains on the west. The eastern Haisiyah contains water only after rain; but in the other, near its origin, are shallow wells called Hasyan in which water stands at two fathoms. The route from Ayainah to Barrah runs up the larger Haisiyah and crosses Jabal Tuwaiq by a pass which, as demonstrated by the Turkish expedition of 1818, presents no serious obstacle to field artillery; in descending again from this pass the smaller or western Haisiyah is not followed but remains to the left.— - -- (fa I ^ TUWAIQ (JABAL) 1913 Hi] ^1:. Vn The subsidiary range of Tuwaiq in the 'Aridh district breaks off from the main one in the Sadair district; not far from Tamair, at a hill known as Umm Jazzal and thence runs south-eastwards to a place called Hit somewhere between Riyadll and the Dahanah desert. This subsidiary range encloses between itself and the main range to the west the Khafs depression which is such an important feature of the 'Aridll district; and it also separates the Khafs depression from the ^Urmah plain to the east of it. Some further particulars are given regarding it in the article on the ; Aridll district. The northern part of Jabal Tuwaiq is described as white and calca reous; with a maximum elevation above the surrounding plains of less than 2;000 feet and an altitude generally increasing from north to south. There is good pasture which lasts throughout the year; and a few Sidr; Markh and Talh trees are seen; generally speaking, the higher the eleva tion in this portion of the range the less the fertility and the drier the soil. Southern Tuwaiq.—Om knowledge of Jabal Tuwaiq south of the point where it gives birth to Wadi Hanifah. is fragmentary and conjee^ tural. Immediately south of Haisiyah; Tuwaiq seems to project very considerably to the eastwards; for the main range is said to run parallel to the right bank of Wadi Hanifah and at no very great distance from it as far as Riyadh; but at Hair it has again begun to recede towards the west. Just below Hair the range appears to be entirely cut across by a valley from Dhrumah^—a place regarded as being on the west side of Jabal Tuwaiq,—which enters Wadi Hanifah below Hair. The mass of Jabal Tuwaiq between Dhrumah and Riyadh is said to contain two Very high portions; they are Jabal Kharshah } which is appar ently close to Haisiyah; and Abaljid , which is crossed on the direct route through the hills from Dhrumah to Riyadh. To the south of Dhrumah, according to native information, Tuwaiq changes its character and becomes of a greyish colour. It is uncertain whether Jabal ; Alaiyah ? which separates 'Aridh from Hariq and Hautah and is described in the article on Hariq, is a spur of Tuwaiq or a separate range j and a similar doubt prevails in regard to Jabal Birk; which forms a barrier and a boundary between Hautah and Aflaj. Jabal Tuwaiq however is evidently prolonged to the southwards behind the districts named ; for, near the south-west corner of the Aflaj district, Shutbah stands in a recess in its eastern face; and the Maqran valley; forming the southern boundary of Aflaj, leads down from its foot hills1914 TUWAIQ (JABAL) to tlie DaMnah desert. From the neighbourhood of Shutbah a series of detached eminences extends southwards and connects Jabal ^Aridh—as ;Jabal Tuwaiq in the 'Aridh district and also to the south of it is fre quently called—with the hills of Salaiyil. Of the western slopes of Jabal Tuwaiq in these lower latitudes nothing is known; it is possible that, as has been stated by one authority, a long limb stretches away to the south-westwards between Wadi Dawasir on the south-east and the route from Qasim to Makkah on the north-west and reaches to Wadi Sabai'. The aggregate length of the two sections of Jabal Tuwaiq has been described by Bedouins as equalling c ' a month's journey/' a statement which could hardly be considered,as justified, even in a loose sense, if the range ended at 'Aflaj. 'UMR Singular Ma'amari {jj**'. A tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate found at (BANI) various places in Batinah and the Western Hajar : they are not to be confounded with a section similarly named of the Bani Battash tribe. In politics the Bani ^Umr are Ghafiriyah, in religion Ibadhiyah, except some of those in Hajar who are Sunnis; none or few of them are Bedouins. The Bani ^tlmr are always at feud with the Hawasinah and Maqabil, their neighbours. In Western Hajar they occupy the whole of Wadi Bani TJmr, viz., Mijzi (70 houses), Jahanat (200 houses), Eahbah (150 hotises).

On the basis supplied by the table above, the strength of the 'Utub at the preseut day may be roughly stated at 5,000 souls. It should be added that at Kuwait uncertainty prevails as to who are really 'Utub, and the number of the tribe at that place may have been under estimated in consequence, possibly to the extent of 1,000 souls or more. Religion and occupations.— 'Utub are Maliki Sunnis. Those of Bahrain are engaged in date cultivation, pearl dealing and pearl diving, and in navigation both within the Persian Gulf and beyond it as far as India and Zanzibar.('0 IT WABEAH 1919 Migrations and political position.— is generally admitted that the 'Utub are of the 'Anizah, but beyond this fact their antecedents are obscure. Their first appearance in the Persian Gulf was probably at Kuwait, where they seem to have settled about 1716 A.D. The Al Subah section have never left Kuwait ; but about 1766 A.D. the A1 Fadhil, Jalahimahand A1 Khalifah commenced to distribute them selves along the eastern coast of Arabia between Kuwait and the southern limits of Qatar. The headquarters of the principal Shaikh of those sections—himself a member of the Al Khalifah section—are said to have been at Zubarah in Qatar until 1783, when the southern 'Utub, as we may call the sections other than the Al Subah, crossed over from Qatar accompanied by most of the Arab tribes of that promontory (the Nairn, Al Bin -'Ali, 'Amamarah, etc.) and conquered Bahrain with the assistance of their kinsmen of Kuwait. Since then the southern ^Utub have remained practically paramount in Bahrain, but in 1800 they were subjugated for a short time by the Imam of 'Oman and they have been at various times compelled to profess allegiance to that potentate, to the Wahhabi Amir, and even to the rulers of Turkey and Persia. There are now no 'Utub in the towns or villages of the Hasa Province or of Qatar. The northern J Utub have retained undisturbed possession of Kuwait. A certain degree of intercourse and relation ship between the northern and southern ; Utub is maintained by inter marriage. A well-known camping ground and watering station in Summan, WABEAH about 140 miles south by west, as the crow flies, of Kuwait Town; it is close to the southern limit of the Shaikh of Kuwait's jurisdiction, either just within or just outside it. Wabrah is a main and central halt ing place for tribes on the move between the coast and the interior in this part of Arabia, and, as indicated in the article on Sum man, the Wabrah route to Najd lies about half-way between the northern route from Kuwait to Qasim and the southern route from Hofuf to Riyadh. At Wabrah there are over 100 wells within a space of about 400 yards square, but ordinarily only a few are in good repair. They are sunk some 3 or 4 fathoms through sandstone rock and are reputed ancient; their mouths are deeply grooved by the friction of the ropes with which the water is drawn ; the fluid they yield is brackish. Wabrah is a centre upon which many routes converge : one leading to Majma' in Sadair leaves Wabrah in a direction south-west by west across masses of rugged sand-0 1920 WABRAH stone hills, while the direct route to Riyadh departs in a line about south ^ ^ by west: on an eminence to the west o£ the latter, immediately after it I b ollS( enters some broken ground, are the remains of a small hill fort. 0 ^ 00 [0^ pphoust A large depressed area in the southern part of the Hamad, not far j^es) a north of the Nafud ; it begins a little to the east of Jauf-al-'Amir and fiti (20 runs north-eastwards towards the Euphrates basin, to which it is said to | aS (pt drain.

A section in Wadi Hatat are known as the Rajaibiyin ^ and those of ^Arqi belong to a section styled Jaradinah ^ The Bani Wahaib are Hinawiyah and Ibadhiyah. In the Masqat ^ District their settlements are : in Wadi Mijlas and its tributaries, at ,,Uom WAHIBAH (AL) 1921 ijiti iiiii La^ban (40 houses)^ Salifah (30 houses) ; Bulidah (25 houses), Habubiyah (60 houses), Mizra ; Sumair (20 houses), Mizra' Balail (15 houses), Hai- thadh (30 houses), Fayadh (20 houses) and Haifal (15 houses) ; in W^-di Maih and its tributaries, at Dhahr Sidrah (30 houses), Tuyan Jahlut (40 houses), Sa^adi (60 houses), Mahaidith (^0 houses), Rakil Milh (30 houses), Mandhariyah (20 houses), Mahail (25 houses), Tawilah (30 houses) and Hajir (30 houses) ; on the coast at Bistan (20 houses) and Yiti (20 houses) ; and at Wataiyah (6 houses), Ruwi (25 houses) and Masqat Town (45 houses). Besides these settled Bani Wahaib there are two Bedouin sections, the Kawasib^ r '^ly'(25 families) and the Shabul (35 families) ; the former possess about 30 camels, 18 donkeys, 14 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats, and the latter about 20 camels, 20 donkeys and 300 sheep and goats. The total number of the Bani Wahaib may be about 3,500 souls. Their principal chief is ^Ali-bm- Qulaim who resides at Tuyan Jahlut, Singular Wahaibi jjilll'': A very important tribe of the Sharqiyah WAHIBAH and Ja'alan districts in the 'Oman Sultanate, almost entirely Bedouin, but enjoying at present a high position in the tribal system. In the Baldan-al-Habus division of Sharqiyah settled A1 Wahibah occupy the villages of Sadairah and Aflaj and part of the town of Mudhaibi. On the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman they are found as far north as Has Shaiblah (20 houses) and as far south as Ras Sarab. Settlements of them exist at Majiz-al-Wahibah (100 houses) and Laghshibah (20 houses) in Batinah ; at ; Adaibah (15 houses) and Ghubrah (30 houses) in the Masqat District; and at Grhallah (10 houses) in Wadi Boshar. Of the nomadic A1 Wahibah a great majority are purely pastoral, owning camels, sheep and goats ; but some of those on the south-east coast are expert fishermen and venture as much as 2 miles out to sea on skin floats to catch small fish with casting nets. The A1 Wahibah as a whole are warlike and have the usual Bedouin virtues and defects; they are always ready to fight when there is a pros pect of plunder, but they are not unpleasant in their ordinary dealings. They are undoubtedly a very numerous tribe and are besides enemies of an inconvenient kind ; for their camels are the swiftest in 'Oman, and they have almost no date groves or villages on which damage can be 6a (AL) Jl I 1/1922 WAHlBAH (AL) iDflicted by way of retaliation. In politics the A1 Wahibah are Hina- wiyahj in relig-ion IbadhTyah. Their last great Tamimab, Nasir-bin-'Ali, died in 1866 at an advanced age ; the principal Shaikh at the present time is ; Ali-bin-Sultan who lives at Aflaj. Parties of A1 Wahibah regularly visit the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in Trucial 'Oman, the most important Hinawi chief not connected with Masqat, and receive from him presents or subsidies. The A1 Wahibah have a standing feud of great bitterness with the Jannabah, and they sometimes annoy the Hikman of Mahdt.

Wais takes its name from the shrine of one Wais-ibn-Karani ^1/ who is said to have been a companion of Muhammad. The place consists of about 250 mud houses of which only 150 are occupied; the inhabitants are mixed Arabs and natives of the towns of Dizful or Shushtar, most of whom are engaged in the cultivation of wheat and barley. There is one garden with a few Kunar trees. About 60 mules are owned here, which, when not in use for the plough, are employed on the caravan routes to Ahwaz, Ramuz and Shushtar. There is a ferry with 1 small boat, and the Ahwaz -Isfahan road leaves the Karun bank at this point. Some Muhaisin cultivate in the neighbourhood in winter. A town on the east coast of Qatar 5 about 10 miles south-south-east WAKE»4JJ of Dohah, g yjy Situation and surroundings.-— is no harbour or even bay at the town; but a coral reef lies in the sea about 1 mile north-east of Wakrahj reaching east and west, while 7 miles to the south-east another reef, known as Fasht Shuwaimsah or Ras-al-'Arq ^*.11 projects from the coast ; between them these reefs enclose, as it were, a large and imperfectly sheltered basin. The town is near the beach and at high water native boats can run close up to it ; either over or through the shore reefs; but European vessels, even of small draft, cannot anchor within a less distance of the shore than ^ miles. One mile to the south of the town is a hill, Jabal Wakrah, 85 feet high. The country between Wakrah and Dohah is bleak and barren. The houses in Wakrah are all of mud and stone, for no date fronds are available here for use as building material. The town1926 WAKRAH originally formed a compact block, but during tbe last few years a detached quarter known as Kumailah has sprung up about 800 yards further to the northward.

There are no British subjects of any sort at this place. Besouvces and trade, —The people of Wakrah are mostly pearl divers^ sailors and fishermen ; and 150 pearl boats, 20 other sea-going vessels and 30 fishing boats belong to the port. In a grassy Raudhah about 1 mile west of the town is a walled date grove j it contains about 80 palms besides some cultivation of lucerne and is surrounded by about 15 shallow masonry wells. From this spot, which is called 'Ain Wakrah, the drinking water of the town is fetched. Live-stock at Wakrah include about 40 horses and 150 camels. Wakrah is a market town of the Bedouins and has about 75 shops. Government.—The governing Shaikh of Wakrah is at present 'Abdur Rahman of the A1 Thani family of the Ma'adhid of Qatar, third sonWARBAH 1927 of Shaikh Jasim who is the present head of the family. ^Abchir Rahman is the owner of the date plantation at ''Ain Wakrah and inhabits a large fort about | a mile inland of the town; in the area which it covers this building is similar to the fort of the Shaikh of Bahrain at Manamah^ but the walls are not so massive and, except where they support an upper storey, probably do not exceed feet in thickness. The Rum ail ah quarter has at the present time a separate headman in the person of Shaikh lhani, another son of Shaikh Jasim. There are no Turkish officials or troops or other tangible evidences of Turkish influence at Wakrah, A small tract or plateau, situated apparently between the Sudah district and Summan on the southern confines of Kuwait territory : it extends from 6 miles north-east of Wabrah to 21 miles north-east of Wabrah.. The surface of Warai^ah is irregular : the ground is broken, strewn with pebbles, and diversified with mounds of earth and sandstone At the western end of Warai^ah is a group of 3 or 4 eminences, called Hurbat . An island lying between the north end of Bubiyan island and the W ARB AH mainland of Turkish 'Iraq. It is enclosed by Khor 'Abdullah comij?.g from the south-east and Khor-as -Sabiyah coming from the south, which, breaking into two channels each, meet around it, while from opposite its west end the inlet on which stands Umm Qasr runs off in a north-westerly direction. Warbah is about 8 miles long north-east and south-west, and is shaped like a crescent with its concavity towards the south; its greatest breadth is over 2 miles. The surface is flat and sandy with low scrubby bushes ; the general level is about 10 feet above high water; at the south-west corner the ground has a steep slope and there is deep water close in shore. * The channels surrounding Warbah are described in the articles on Khor 'Abdullah, Umm Qasr and Khor-as -Sabiyall» * See a repoit, dated 24th July 1905, by Captam E.

The southern iaj Na^ boundary of Washam is a locality called Hammadah which divides it from Dhrumah in 'Aridh ; to the west there is desert and no definite ^ border. uj Physical —Washam is described as aflat district, narrow in proportion to its length which is from north-west to south-east. Towards the west end Washam is traversed by a longitudinal ridge called Dhaharah ^ which is parallel to Jabal Tuwaiq and only, it is said, 10 jmin or 15 miles distant from it: in the middle of this ridge is a break in which ^ stands Shaqrah^ the principal town of the district. Un-ier the face of ^ ^ Tuwaiq which overlooks Washam from the east is a broad belt of ^ sandy desert containing the valley of Jaraifah already mentioned. The general slope of Washam between Dhaharah and Tuwaiq is understood to be towards the south-east corner, but it is stated that the drainage of the district finds no outlet even in this direction and is absorbed. A valley which comes down from Haraimlah by Barrah in the 'Aridh district is reported to end in a sw'amp, called Mufidh u^^ 0 , near the villages of Shams and Shamaisah in Washam. None of the villages of Washam are to the west of the Dhabarah ridge_, beyond which the district extends only a short distance and the country is all desert. 15 Inhabitants. —The settled population of Washam are chiefly Bani Zaid and Bani Tamim, but a few Sabai', Dawasir and even Mutair are found. Their number may be roughly estimated at 6^000 to 7,000 souls. The 'Ataibah are the principal Bedouins, but nomad Mutair and Qahtan also visit Washam. psab tt) Agriculture and -The cultivable parts of Washam consist of a sandy loam in which crops can sometimes be raised by rainfall; and there are good date plantations, especially at Shaqrah. Camels, donkeys, horned cattle, sheep and goats are fairly numerous ; but there are not many horses in the possession of the villagers. Such trade as exists is centred at Shaqrah, where the best horses for the Indian market were formerly collected from the surrounding Bedouins.WASHAM 1929 Topography. —The following are the principal inhabited places in the Washam district ,— Name, Position.

They are now found at Nakhl (50 houses) in Wadi Ma'awal, at Tuwaiyah in Western Hajar, and at Tikhah (20 houses) and Hazam (40 houses) in Wadi Fara'. Those at Tikhah belong to a section called Wilad ^Abdas Salam. The Ya^aribah probably number about 800 souls. They have no prominent chief. The tribe supplied the rulers of 'Oman between 1625 and 1744 A. D., but they have since lost all influence and credit. Their power was not finally broken mi til the capture of Hazam by Saiyid 'Azzan bin-Qais in 1870 after a 9 months^ siege. A tract in the Kuwait Principality between Jahrah and Batih. It YAH begins 15 miles north of Jahrah and thence extends northwards 8 miles ^ to the beginning of Batih ; its eastern and western limits are not ascertained. Half-way between its northern and southern borders it is crossed from east to west by the Jal-al-Yah JU^ a well-marked ridge 50 feet high, half a mile broad and covered with round stones : to the south this ridge presents a rather steep face, but on the north it declines gradually to the level of the plain. Yah is an exceedingly barren tract with very little grazing. Its average elevation above the sea is about 250 feet. An island in the bay between Abu Dhabi and Qatar ; it lies rather YAS over 100 miles west by south of Abu Dhabi Town, 18 miles east-south- east of the island of Dalmah and only 4 or 5 miles north of the coast of Dhafrah at Jabal Dhannah. The island measures 6| miles from north to south by 5 miles across, and its shape is roughly oval with a remarkable indentation at its south end. The shores of Yas are low, but the centre consists of volcanic hills culminating in twin peaks each 430 feet high. The indentation already mentioned forms a singular landlocked natural harbour, to British mariners known as Meriton Bay; the depth is from 4 to 6 fathoms and the bottom mud, but the entrance is rather narrow and inconvenient. The island is frequented in winter by Bani Yas fishermen, mostly from Dhafrah., and pearl boats sometimes take refuge1932 YAS there during storms. The following pearl banks exist in the neighbourhood Ghashshah^ % miles north of the north-west corner of the island; Umm-al-Knrkum_, 3 miles north of the north-east corner ; Buwairdah^ 5 miles to the south-west; and Dhahr-al-Yas^ which, though 33 miles to the westward and considerably nearer to Dalmah, appears to take its name from Yas Island. Water is obtainable only after rain. Yas is included in the Abu Dhabi Principality of Trucial 'Oman. YAS (BANI) One of the most compact and powerful tribes of Trucial 'Oman ; their range is practically co-extensive with the territories of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the basis of whose power they are. The following is a tabular view of the composition of the tribe Sections Falah (Al) Falah (Al Bu) j JT Falasah (Al Bu) J I Houses and distribution.

E emaeks, This section own 2,000 date palms: they have no pearl boats of their own, but some of them go to the banks from Bandar Radaim on boats belonging to other sections. One of their subdivisions is known as the Al Sa'adun Jl. The Al Bu Falah are also known as the Al Nahyan ; they are the section to which the Shaik of Abu Dhabi person ally belongs. One or two of those in Liwah go to the pearl fisheries, but they own no boats : the remainder of those in Liwah subsist by their date palms which nu/nber about 4,000. Singular is Falahi The Al Bu Falasah who live outside of Trucial 'Oman are divided into the following sections :—Mijardah (singular Majarudi Bawa- shid (singulap Rashidi j and Yidaiwat or Lidaiwat (singular Yidaiwi ). These are all MaliKi Sunnis^ like the rest of the tribe elsewhere, and are engaged in the pearl fisheries and in navigation.

Singular is Mabairabi The Mazari' of Liwah own 20 Baqarahs and go pearling from Bandar liadaim : they have also 8,000 date trees and are said to possess very large numbers of horses and camels and a few goats. The other Mazari' of Trucial 'Oman, who may or may not be identical with this section of the Bani Yas, are dealt with in the article Mazari'. This section have 3,000 date trees, and a few of them go pearling from Mu- ghairah. They possess 5 or 6 camels and a few goats. Singular is Qanaisi The men are all pearl fishers and own 4 boats. They have also 800 date trees. Those in Liwah a,re credited with the possession of IO j OGO date palms and 60 camels. The section geneially are pearl divers and have 40 Baqarahs at Abu Dhabi Town and 16 others at Mu- ghairah, etc., upon the coast of Dhafrah.

They own 3,000 date palms and go to the pearl banks from Bandar Kadaim and Khor Mughairah Singular is Sultani jUcJL*, The Al Bu 'Amim of Abu Dhabi Town are now generally regarded as included in the Bani Yas; and the Halalamah, who where formerly a section of the Bani Qitab, are at the present day attached to the Bani Yas; SO also the Thamairat, who were originally Marar. Besides the above, a few Bani Yas whose section has not been ascertained are found at Jumairah in the Dibai Principality and about 1,200 on Hanjam island. It will be observed that the total number of the tribe in Trucial 'Oman, is about 1^_,000 souls, of whom some 10,000 are settled and 2,000 are Bedouins. The Bedouins are all in the Abu Dhabi Princi pality ; of the non-nomadic portion about 2,000 are in Dibai territory, but the remainder of them, about 8,000 persons, are all subjects of the Abu Dhabi Shaikh. Besides the Bani Yas of Trucial 'Oman there are, ifc will be seen, about 600 of the tribe settled in Bahrain, 200 on Tarut island in the Hasa Sanjaq, and over 100 in Qatar, besides those on Hanjam. The ruins of the Muraijib fort and the incipient villages of Jahali and Mas^udi attest also the past and present connection of the/ YATAIL (AL BANI) 1935 tribe with the Baraimi Oasisj which is nearer to their ancestral country than the settlements just mentioned but still outside the tribal territories proper. It will also be noticed that the Bani Yas of the Dibai Principality nearly all belong to the A1 Bu Falasah section and that those of Bahrain and Tarut and part of those in Qatar are likewise members of this roving subdivision^ which is now but slightly represented in the original home of the tribe. The resources of the Bani Y as and their occupations are sufficiently explained in the table above and in the article on Dhafrah, in the Liwah division of which tract nearly half the tribe have their permanent abode. The Bani Yas of the Abu Dhabi Principality are on the whole well affected and faithful to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who is himself of their number. The principal exception to this rule are the Qubaisat section who have at times evinced a disposition to follow the example of the Al Bu Falasah by hiving off from the main body of the tribe; but at the present time they are stationary and appear to be contented. The prin cipal men of the tribe, under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, are Buti-bin Khadim of the Qubaisat section, who generally resides at Abu Dhabi Town but is headman of Muzaira^h, ■'Attab and Qarmidah in Liwah; Hamad-bin-Aghtail of the Maharibah section, under whose authority are Dhafir and Taraq in Liwah; Eashid-bin-Humaid of the Hawamil section, to whom Hadhi ; Shah, Subakhah and Wazil in Liwah are subject; and Faris-bin-'Ali of the Mazari' section, who is over Khannur Hafif and Mariyah in Liwah, and himself lives at Khannur. The Bani Yas are of the Hinawi political faction and differ from most of their neighbours in being, wherever they occur, Maliki Sunnis and not Hanabilah. They have at present no special relations of friendship or enmity with adjoining tribes. A small tribe of Bahrain who claim connection with the Bani BANI) Tamim, but are generally believed to be of sei vile descent. They have j lU , ^ jy 10 houses at Salbah and live by pearl diving and fishing ; in religion ' ' they are Maliki Sunnis. They immigrated from Qatar with the 'Utub.1936 ZA'AB ZA'AB Singular Za^abi : a tribe of Trucial 'Oman, found also in the (_&gt;Uj 'Oman Sultanate. They are Hinawi in politics and Hanbali Sunnis by religion. Their headquarters are at Jazirat-al -Hamra, where they have 500 houses, and they are substantially represented also at Khor Kalba by about 150 families ; both of these places are in the Sharjah Principality but on opposite sides of the 'Oman Promontory. Some of the Za^ab of Jazirat-al -Hamra own date plantations at the village of Khatt in the Jiri plain in the interior and betake themselves to that place in the hot weather. In the 'Oman Sultanate Za^ab are found at Saham Town and at Qasbiyat-az-Za^ab and Abu Dhurus in the Saham sub-Wilayat, also at Bu Baqarah in the sub-Wilayat of Shinas. The total number of the tribe may be estimated at 3,300 in Trucial 'Oman and 1,200 in the 'Oman Sultanate, or at 4,500 souls altogether. The two territorial divisions still maintain communication with each other and intermarry. ZAID A settled Arab tribe of Southern Najd^ whom some authoritie (BANI) would connect with the Bani Tamim and some with the Dawasir; they are found in W a sham at Shaqrah and Washaiqir ; in W adi Inrabah at Khurmah and Rumadan; and, in the tract between the two districts mentioned, at Quwai'iyah and Sha'arah. They are said to consist of three main divisions, viz., Bawarid ^I^Ghaihab or Qaihab and ; isa • Apart from a well known line of poetry * in which the Bani Zaid are described as resembling the Sulaba in one particular, there appears to be no reason at all for regarding them—as has been done—in the light of a socially inferior tribe. As a matter of fact the ruling family at Shaqrah, the Al Sabyan, belong to the Bani Zaid. ^CTTAmi 0ften pi ' ono ™ ce(i as if writtei1 C^m ZaitCm ^ .

The route from Dilam to Eehbehan crosses tlie river here by fords which are described in the article on the Hindiyan River. Cham Zaidan consists of about 120 houses of the Agha Jari tribe of Lurs and of Behbehanis, who, besides other crops, cultivate rice on the river-banks, and possess about 400 cattle and 500 donkeys. The Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiyari Khans, who have a joint interest in the Zaidan valley as lessees of the government revenue, maintain representatives at this place. An island off the coast of Barr-al -'Oqair in the Hasa Sanja^, about ZAKHNIT* 10 miles east-south-east of 'Oqair Port. 20 miles south-south-west of the NIYAH southern tip of Bahrain Island and 32 miles distant north-north-west- wards from the foot of Dohat-as -Salwa. Zakhnuniyah lies parallel to the coast, from which it is separated by a shallow channel 2 miles wide : the length of the island is 4 miles and its greatest breadth about 1 J. It is barren and without good water, and there are now no permanent inhabitants. The Dawasir who are now settled in Bahrain halted here for some years in the course of their emigration from Najd ; they left again for Bahrain about 60 years ago; but their Shaikhs with some of the 'Utub of Bahrain still occasionally visit Zakhnunlyah for sport in the cold weather, as they also do the mainland opposite. A fort built on the island by Shaikh 'Ali-bin-Khalifah of Bahrain 40 years or more ago is now in ruins. A small tract in Kuwait territory between Jahrah and Qira'-al- ZAQLAH Marru, extending from 5 miles north of Jahrah to 9 miles north of Jahrah ; its eastern and western limits have not been fixed. Zaqlah is a basin, somewhat lower than Qira'-al -Marru, and its drainage falls to a hollow in the centre; it is covered with ^Ausaj, a thorny plant which affords grazing for camels, and with colocynth. An Arab tribe of Southern 'Arabistan, politically allied to the ZaRQAN Bawiyeh. ^ they occupy Qraneh on the Karun, the country inland 6 H1938 ZAEQAN from Qraneh, and; it is said^ a small tract on the Jarrahi River. Their fighting men number about 420, of whom half are armed with rifles and about 180 are mounted: the total strength of the tribe may be about 1,500 souls. The Zarqan live principally by cultivating wheat and barley, but they also own a considerable number of sheep and goats. The divisions of the Zarqan are :—• Section. Location. Fighting strength.

All sections aiike dwell in huts, which are sometimes of mud and sometimes of matting; but some of the tribesmen at Qraneh inhabit mud houses. About J of the tribe is settled or semi-settled at Qraneh, while the remainder is still nomadic. The Zarqan are said to pay 500 Tumans a year as revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareh.. Icjloj * Singular Zutti • A peculiar non-Arab tribe, sometimes nomadic, found in various parts of 'Oman and particularly at Baraimi, Masqat Town, Mat rah and Nakhl. They are easily distinguishable from Arabs, *A fuller account of tho Zatut with somG speciniens of their language is given by Col. Miles, J. A S. B., Vol. XLYI for 1877, pages 57-59.{im ZILFI 1939 have apparently a language of their own^ and are regarded as being a branch of the Saluba, who are found all over Arabia and in Mesopotamia : some authorities however connect them with the Jats of India ; and it is stated that according to their own traditions they came from India: others have remarked on their resemblance to Gipsies. Everywhere the Zatut maintain themselves as separate communities, marrying chiefly among themselves and readily welcoming members of their own tribe from other places who come to settle amongst them. They are despised but are not molested by the Arabs, who value them for the useful services they render. They are farriers, goldsmiths, black smiths, armourers, carpenters and pedlars; their women are handsome and dance publicly for payment, but are not immoral. Levirate law obtains among them, and in default of a brother the nearest male relative of the deceased can take the widow to wife. Some of them are regarded as more closely connected with the Arabs^ and others with the Baluchis of the places where they are found. In 'Oman they are generally Ibadhis, and their number in the Sultanate may be estimated at 1,000. A large village or small town in Najd, with its dependencies; Zilfi is generally reckoned to the district of Sadair in Southern Najd, but some authorities would include it in Qasim. Site. — Zilfi is situated at the western foot of Jabal Tuwaiq, near the northern end of that range; it apparently lies about 60 miles east of Buraidah and a little over 40 miles north-west of Majma^ A desert route connects Zilfi with Kuwait Town, crossing a valley called Artawiyah at a point about 50 miles from Zilfi and running thence to the wells of Subaihiyah or to those of Laqit in the Kuwait district of 'A dan. ZILFI Zilfi proper.—Tiilii proper lies in Batin , a depression consist ing of arable land immediately under Jabal Tuwaiq ; out of this depres sion a hollow leads westwards, which is known as Khali Izlaiqif and carries the route to Qasim (see article Najd, Eoute No. VI). The inhabitants of Zilfi proper number about 2,000 souls : there are approxi mately 150 houses of Bani Khadhir, 100 of Dawasir, 100 of 'Ataibah, 50 of Shammar and 20 of Fadhul. Dates, grain, musk melons, water melons, lucerne and the usual fruits of Sadair are cultivated by irrigation from wells. Water is obtained at 8 to 18 fathoms. There are a few 6 h 21940 ZILFI horses among the Fadhul, and flocks and herds are exceptionally numer ous. Some merchants live here whose operations extend to Kuwait on the one side and to Makkah on the other; Zilfi benefits by its proximity to the route between those two places^ and also by the transit of trade between Northern and Southern Najd. More than 100 households from Zilfi are now settled at Kuwait Town.

A small district of the Persian Coast belonging to the administrative division known as the Gulf Ports ; it is situated between the Rud Shirin and Daliki streams immediately above their junction where the Eud-hilleh River is formed, and it extends also a little to the west of the Rud Shirin. Zira is enclosed between the ShaMllMreh district on the west, the Mazara'i district on the north, and the Dashtistan district (o£ which it is supposed at one time to have formed part) on the east and south ; it lies close under the hills and the heat in summer is great. Dates and some cotton are grown, but the principal crops, as in the neighbour ing districts, are wheat and barley. The inhabitants are a medley of Persian- speaking tribes, all of whom are Shi ahs ; their number is estimated at 3,000 souls. The men are well armed with rifles, and knives and revolvers are worn. Agricultural produce is the only expoit, and imports are the same as in the other small districts near Bushehr. The Hashim Man of Zira is equal to about 150 lbs. English. The trans port available in the district amounts to about 90 horses, SO mules and 900 donkeys. This district (like Mazara'i) is held in Tiyul by Mehdi Khan, a cousin and ward of the Salar-i-Mu'azzam, and is farmed at present by the Khan of Sliabankareh, who has a representative at Durugah. Arable land is assessed at 100 Qrans per Gau of cultivation, and the tax on dates is half the produce or the value of the same in cash. The culti vators in this district appear to be regarded as tenants rather thanas proprietors. Administrative arrangements are the same kareh.

An island in thG bay betweon Abu Dllclbi and Qatcir t it lies some 85 miles west-north-west of Abu Dhabi Town and 50 miles north-east by east of Dalmah. Its length from north to sonth is 3 miles and its breadth 2 miles ; it tapers to its southern end and carries a rather remarkable peak 540 feet high. There is no water, and no vegetation except grass and stunted brushwood. An anchorage exists on the south-east side and there are several pearl banks in the neighbourhood, particularly the following :—Khor Zirko, 13 miles to the north-east; Qasmul and Sutuh Umm -ash-Shalt, at 4 and 8 miles respectively, to the south ; Sutuh-al-Hulah, a group of banks 7 or 8 miles to the south-south west ; and Ghazrat Zirko, 2 miles to the north-west. About 27 miles to the north-north-east, but apparently named from this island, is the pearl bank Umm -ash-Shaif Zirko. A great group of banks, known as Sutuh Arzanah, runs westwards from Zirko almost to Arzauah. Zirko is reckoned to the Abu Dhabi Principality. ZIRKO * A) An island or insulated tract of land on the right bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab, cut off from the mainland by a creek of the same name which leaves the river about 1 mile below the lower end of Haji Salbuq island and returns to it immediately opposite to the upper end of the Dawasir islands. The tract thus enclosed extends for 5 miles along the river and * For a view of this island see Chart No. 2374—2837 B. ZIYADI- YAH «»1946 ZIYABlYAH its breadth is a mile to a mile and a half: it should be noted that the eastern side of the island—not the western shore of the creek behind it— is the true bank of the Shatt-al -^Arab. The inhabitants are some 2,000 persons of various tribes whose huts fringe the island on both sides; they are agriculturists and their property consists of 100/) 00 date trees besides orchards of other fruits, 300 cattle, 500 sheep and goats, and 5 horses. The whole island belongs to the Naqib of Basrah. Closely associated with Ziyadiyah are two small islands named Bardah and Sibyah which lie on the eastern and western sides respectively of the upstream entrance of the Ziyadiyah creek. Hardah, which very closely adjoins Ziyadiyah island, is inhabited by about 150 persons of mixed tribes owning some 2,000 date palms, other fruit trees, 30 cattle and 30 sheep and goats. Sibyah, opposite to the lower extremity of Haji Salbuq island, is of very small size, with only 25 inhabitants and proportionate resources. Ziyadiyah with both its satellites is in Turkish ^Iraq. ZIYAIMAH Singular Zaiyani : the name is said to be derived from Zaiyanah, jdUjj a place near Makkah. They are also called the ^Adawin on account of their supposed descent from two brothers who were perpe tually fighting each other and were nicknamed for that reason J Ad wan. The Ziyainah are believed to have come to Bahrain from Qatar with the 5 Utub. They have now 150 houses in Muharraq Town only. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis : their occupations are general trade, pearl dealing, pearl diving and navigation in the Persian Gulf and beyond. Ojbj The present administrative centre and residence of the Kalantar of the Persian Coast district of Shanril; it is situated near the left bank of the Jamush stream, 28 miles north-east of Bandar ■'Abbas and 19 miles west by south of Shamil Village, and takes its name from a shrine dedicated to Saiyid Sulaiman, a supposed descendant of one of the twelve Imams.ZORA 1947 (j^fi The house of the Kalantar is a conspicuous object. There are 200 houses and the population may be 1^000 souls; the inhabitants are Shi'ahs of no particular tribe. Dates and barley are the staples of cultivation. Sweet water for drinking and for cultivation is obtained from the adjacent stream. There are 50 cattle and 500 sheep and goats, but 50 donkeys are the only transport animals. The annual revenue is 312 Tumans. The name of the district in Kuwait territory that bounds Kuwait Bay on its north side from the neighbourhood of Jahrah to Khor-as- Sabiyah. It consists chiefly of a range of hills or hilly belt called Jal-az-Zor which runs in a general north-easterly and south westerly direction, for the most part in an almost straight line, passing about 3 miles to the north-west of Jahrah. At the point nearest to Jahrah is a gap in the ridge : the hill on the east side of the gap, 415 feet high, is called Mutla/ • that on the west is Mutaili'ah AauJUk/o; and through the gap a small valley, which has its head 2 miles to the north and is called Jauf-al-Mutia' , discharges its drainage into the Jahrah plain. A few miles to the west of the Jauf are some hills forming a landmark known as Khashm-al-^Ifri cjryuJJ^^. Between the Jal-az-Zor and Kuwait Bay stretches a plain from 1 to 5 miles in breadth with numerous wells, called simply Sif ^ or 'the beach this plain is generally barren and stony, but for 8 miles between Mdairah and Mghairah its surface is muddy, though beyond the reach of the sea. The range declines in height as it goes eastward, and at Mdairah, at half its length, is only abotit 150 feet high. Near the east end, about 2 miles north of the Mghairah wells, it has a conspicuous cone-shaped peak called Mghatti Full information about the wells in Zor will be found in the first route described in the article on Kuwait Principality. ZOR ;;; A strip of land on the west coast of Trucial 'Oman between Hamriyah and ^Ajman ; at high tide it is practically an island, an4 this and other circumstances have combined to invest it with a certain political importance. The seaward flank of Zora is in line with the rest * Chief authority. Cox, from personal observation and enquiry. ZORA*■ 1948 ZORA of the coast, but a creek whicli runs inland immediately to the south of Hamriyah and rejoins the sea a little to the north of ^Ajman passes behind it and effectually detaches it from the mainland. The tract thus enclosed is about 5 miles long, the direction of its length being that of the coast, and perhaps 2 miles broad. Towards its south end Zora contains one or two wells and a few palm trees. The people of Hamriyall and 'Ajman, when there is peace between them, send their cattle to Zora to graze, but the chief value of the place is as a military stronghold surrounded by a natural ditch. The creek which protects it is not fordable at more than half tide, and then only at 2 places, one near Hamriyah and the other near 'Ajman, each of which could be easily commanded by the building of a tower. Thus secured from the landward side and already inviolable from the sea by reason of the Maritime Peace, Zora would be a secure place in which to keep flocks and herds during warfare on the mainland ; or, under different condi tions, it might serve as a base of offensive action against the Bedouins of the interior. These obvious facts have not been lost on the Shaikhs of Trucial ''Oman, and various contests relating to Zora have taken place among them during the last 60 years, of which the incidents are related elsewhere.* ZUBAID V A numerous and widely distributed Arab tribe in Turkish 'Iraq : their territory covers the whole of Mesopotamia from Baghdad City and Musaiyib on the north to Bgliailah and the Dagharah marshes on the south.

Yasar jtwJ Of these sections the Ba^aij and Dawar are sometimes regarded as inde pendent tribes and may perhaps be so: it will be noticed that the Shammar Toqah. have also a Battah and a Dawar section. The J ahaish section, now generally regarded as an independent tribe, comprises two sub-sections known as Al Bu Dadah 8^ and A1 Bu Sanaid jjow ; and a number of the sub-sections of the two Jabur sections are specified in the article on the Hillah Qadha, also one in that on the Qadha of Najaf^ and two more in that on the Qadha of Samawah. Some would make the two Jabur sections a tribe by themselves (see tribal table, 'Iraq). The entries under ^Akarat, ; Atij, Da^um and Jahaish in the table of tribes in the article on Turkish 'Iraq may also be consulted. The position of the Khasraj is doubtful ; they are by some identified with the section so named of the Bani Lam and by others considered to be neither Bani Lam nor Zubaid. The Jabur Al Bu Khattab (or part of them) live at the confluence of the Diyalah and the Tigris, the Jabur-al-Wawi on the Euphrates below Hillah Town, and the Jahaish in the direction of NaSlriyah Town. Some further facts regarding the distribution of the sections will be found in the articles on the Hillah and Jaziralt Qadhas. With the exception of the Bani ^Ajil and ^Azzah (or some of those sections) who are Sunnis, the whole Zubaid tribe is Shfah. They dwell in the usual black tents, or at best in huts : they are agriculturists, cultivating wheat, barley, rice and maize, but not sesame ; and they breed horses, camels, cattle and sheep, but no buffaloes.1950 ZUBAID The Znbaid are not as yet particularly well armed with rifles. They are politically allied with the Dilaim and have a standing fend with the Northern Sham mar Their recognised chief at the present time is Rashid Baig, who lives 10 or 12 miles west of Suwairah. A division of the 'Amarah Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish 'Iraq: it is not to be confounded with the town and Nahiyah of the same name in the Markaz Qadha of Basrah. Position and houndaries. —The Qadha of Zubair is situated On the Jah^lah canal below^ or to the south-east of, the Qadha of 'Amarah. It is bounded by the 'Amarah Qadha on the north-east, and probably by that of Dawairij on the north ; on the east it meets Persian territory, and on the south apparently the Qadha of Qurnah ; on the west the Qadha of Shatrat -al-' Amarah seems to be interposed between it and the left bank of the Tigris. Topography and inhabitants. —Nothing definite is known of the geography of the Zubair Qadha, which lies at a distance from all main lines of communication, but it appears to be watered by the Jahcllall canal. The only fixed village is Masa'idah which is the seat of the local administration and seems to be situated on the Jahllah canal somewhere 20 or 25 miles to the south-east of Amarah Town, Masa'idah consists of about 100 mud houses and 30 shops : it is the residence of a manager of the Dairat-as-Saniyah and is protected by a garrison of 100 regular infantry. The people of the dis trict belong almost entirely to the A1 Bu Muhammad tribe. Population,—ThQ fixed population of the Qadha is estimated at 14,000 souls, who are all Shi^ah Muhammadans with the exception of a few Sunni officials and Government employes at Masa'idah. Resources. Eice and maize are cultivated by the tribes; and some date plantations laid out by the Dairat-as-Saniyah in its estates promise to be highly profitable. Buffaloes, cattle and sheep are bred in large numbers. Administration.- Zubair as a Qadha has no subdivisions.(JdM ZUBAIR TOWN 1961 A gtJat ita ois A town of Turkish 'Iraq; it stands in the desert 9 miles to the south west of Basrah. I own and forms the first stage on the route from Basrah, to Kuwait or Najd. It has no connection with the Zubair Qadha. Around the town, which is walled, the country is entirely barren except to the south-east, on which side a scattered series of lucerne and melon fields, hedged with tamarisks, extends to a distance of 3 miles; this tract is called Dirhamiyah &lt;4^0 and the drinking water of the town is supplied by its wells. A few miles to the north-west of Zubair are a property and fortified dwelling-house belonging to the hereditary Shaikh of Zubair. The principal object of interest outside the town is the tomb of Hasan- al-Basri, about half a mile from the western gate; and within the walls is the tomb of Zubair, distinguished by a blue tile-work minaret about 40 feet high, now inclining dangerously to the north. There is in the town a large covered bazaar, mostly of masonry, and the dwelling-houses are either of sun-dried or of burnt brick, the latter being excavated in great quantities on the adjoining site of ancient Basrah. The better houses are fitted with Badgirs or wind-catchers, and with subterranean apartments or Sardabs ventilated by the Badgirs. The population is about 6,000 and virtually all are Sunni Muham- madans, as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zubair, arch- rebel against Mi and killed here in fighting against him. Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbourhood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the hot weather in quest of a drier atmosphere; and some important families of Central Arabian origin are located here. Juss or gypsum mortar is exported from Zubair, and sandals and rude saddlery are manufactured; but the carrying trade probably supports a larger number of the population than any other industry. The melons of Dirhamiyah have a high reputation. Zubair is a market town for the surrounding Bedouin tribes. Asa Nahiyah in the Qadha of Basrah it has a Mudir and a few civil police; and there is also a small military detachment of about 20 men under an officer. The inhabitants of Zubair are themselves still legally exempt from military service; but some of them, caught in /asrah Town, are made into soldiers by the Turks. The ruins of Old Basrah extend from the walls of Zubair for three miles along the road to the modern Basrah ; they consist of mounds of earth intermingled with fragments of yellow burnt brick, and they cover an area of several square miles. Two miles from Zubair, on the southern ZUBAIR jV) TOWN - mmm mam* 1952 ZUBAIH TOWN edge of the higliroad^ are the remains of one of the principal mosques of the ancient town ; part of its northern minaret, faced with excellent yellow brick, is still erect. About a mile to the east of this old J ami' is the tomb of Talhah who was slain along with Zubair in the Battle of the Camel, fought near this place in 656 A.D. These two monuments alone remain to testify to the greatness of the former city. A ruined and deserted town on the west side of the Qatar Promontory, about 5 miles south of Khor Hassan. It stands at the foot of a deep bay of the same name, of which the western point is lias 'Ashairiq and which contains a small island, also called Zubarah. The town was formerly the stronghold of the A1 Khalifah ruling family of Bahrain : its site is still frequented by the Na^im of Bahrain and Qatar. The town was walled and some 10 or 12 forts stood within a radius of 7 miles round it, among them Faraihah, Halwan, Lisha, 'Ain Muhammad, Qal'at Murair, Rakaiyat, Umm-ash-Shuwail and Thaghab, which are mentioned in the article on Qatar. All of these are now ruinous and deserted, except Thaghab, which the people of Khor Hassan visit to draw water. Murair is said to have been connected with the sea by a creek which enabled sailing boats to discharge their cargoes at its gate, but the inlet is now silted up with sand. r CALCUTTA *.

II geographical and statistical CALCUTTA SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA 1908/ INTRODUCTION THIS second volume of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, 'Oman and Central Arabia is a geographical dictionary, presenting, in a series of alphabetically arranged articles, a detailed account of the physical and political conditions of the Persian Gulf and its surrounding countries. For a description of the Gulf region as a whole, however, the reader is referred to the Introduction to the first volume of this Gazetteer, some of the Appendices in which also deal with subjects of a general or statistical nature. The information contained in the Gazetteer has been specially collected or compiled, and much of it is entirelv new. Of the articles composing the present volume those that are enumerated below, relating to the chief political divisions of the Gulf region and covering among them the whole of its extent, are the most important; they stand, in fact, on a different footing from the remainder, which are subordinate and explanatory ; and they contain in themselves all that it is most essential to know in regard to the Persian Gulf. The principal articles in question are these :— . Pages 1382—1425. . Pages 1425—1451. . Pages 1505—1535. . Pages 233—253. . Pages 657—679. . Pages 1058—1077.

Pages 1455—1468, supplemented by the articles ol the component districts, mentioned in the article itself and too numerous to be specified here. Makran (Coast of Persian) . Pages 1130—1155. All these articles follow similar thougli not identical lines ; and the topics discussed in each; though the order of arrangement is not invariable^ are generally as follow :— Boundaries and sub-divisions of the tract. Physical character and main features, viz., mountains; rivers, etc. Climate and seasons. Natural products, vegetable, animal and mineral. Agriculture and crops. Livestock, including transport animals. Inhabitants, with reference to racial and tribal distinctions, religious differences, mode of life, character, language, customs, dress and arms j also estimates of population. Trade, internal and external, with a notice of currency, weights and measures; also shipping, manufactures and industries, and miscellaneous occupations. Communications by land and water, with descriptions of routes and estimates of transport. Administration and government, especially police, justice, military resources, taxation and finance, and political constitution. International position and foreign interests, especially British, and their representation in the country. Some of the principal articles contain in addition a paragraph on topography, dealing with that subject in so far as it has not been exhausted in subordinate articles; and a list of useful authorities and maps is given in a footnote at the beginning of each principal article. The fullest and most general information in regard to meteorology and health, date culture, transport animals and livestock, religions and sects, trade, sailing vessels, fisheries, pearl fisheries and postal and telegraphic communica tions will be found, however, not in the articles above cited, but in Appendices, which the reader will have no difficulty in finding, in the first volume of the Gazetteer. The subordinate articles deal in greater detail with the districts, places, tribes, etc., of which mention is made in the principal articles; and, toINTBODTJCTION. HI facilitate reference^ names which form the subjects of separate articles have been printed in bold type throughout this volume. In subordinate articles on districts and tracts the arrangement and method of treatment are somewhat the same as in principal articles ; but^ so far as possible, repetition of the information already given in principal articles is avoided. Topographical information has generally been thrown into tabular form in order to avoid an excessive multiplication of separate articles, and most wells, villages of minor importance, etc., will be found described in the article on the district to which they belong, or on the river, valley, etc., where they are situated. It has not been possible to prepare an index of these smaller places, and they should accordingly be looked for first in the article on the appropriate district or, in a few cases, the main division, and then in the other articles containing topographical tables to which the article first consulted may afford a clue. The map issued with this Gazetteer will be found useful in tracing the articles in which minor features and places are described. The reader should understand that estimates of distance, where they depend on native information only, are not very reliable; and that a good deal of the geography—especially of the remoter Arabian districts—is more or less conjectural, though no pains have been spared in testing, where possible, the account of one native informant by that of another. Esti mates of population are necessarily very rough and have generally been derived, subject to other checks, from numbers of houses and from reputed tribal fighting strengths ; it appears to be the general opinion that on the average there are about five souls to a ' house ^ in settled populations, and that among nomads the proportion capable of bearing arms is about two-sevenths of the whole tribe. The figures for livestock and other agricultural resources have generally been obtained through untrained native reporters and cannot be regarded as altogether trustworthy, but they explain the general character of tracts and help to determine the relative importance of villages in the same neighbourhood. The common statement that water is ' good ' must be received with caution, for in many cases it probably means no more than that its taste is not disagreeable and that it may be drunk with impunity by natives of the country. It remains to define the sense in which some of the terms used in this Gazetteer are employed. When distances are computed by the ' hour/ ; a pedestrian s hour of about three miles in ordinary ground is meant; but, when ' days ' are mentioned without a qualifying adjective, the re ference is to the daily journey of a caravan, which may be anything fromir INTRODUCTION. 25 to 80 miles. A c&lt; day ' by riding camel may be taken as the double or more, in mileage, of a caravan day. ' Miles ' are common land miles, except where it is stated that they are geographical or nautical. By the ' right' and ' left ' banks of rivers and valleys are meant those banks which a traveller would have on his right and left hand, respectively, in descending with the stream or slope. The term ' foot ^ is used to indicate the end furthest from the sea of a bay or inlet; and ' depth in the same connection, sometimes refers not to the soundings but to the depth of the indentation formed in the coast line, the sense in this case depending on the context. The system of transliteration followed in this volume is that explained in the Introduction to the first volume. J. G. LOEIMER.

'ABBAS A n important town on the Persian Coast at the entrance of the (BANDAR)* ^ &gt;ers ^ an j it constitutes in itself an administrative district and is surrounded, except on the south side which is to the sea, by the district Of Shamil. Bandar ^Abhas is situated about 280 miles north-north west of Masqat and 96 miles east-north-east of Lingeh Town. Site and Bandar ^ Abbas stands at the foot of a bay upon a low, sandy, shelving beach j the buildings approach within 100 yards of the water ; s edge and at high spring tides the Sea washes their walls. The town looks out, between the islands of Hormuz and Larak, upon the junction off the RuuS -al-Jibal promontory of the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman : its background, as viewed from the sea, is formed by the massive pile of Kuh-i-Ginau, which at a distance of only 18 miles north by west of the town attains an altitude of 7j783 feet. The immediate surroundings of Bandar ''Abbas are utterly bare; even garden cultivation and the usual drapery of a few palms are here wanting. The anchorage for ships drawing up to 18 feet of water lies south of the town at a minimum distance of 2| miles ; it has good holding-ground and is Well sheltered from every direction except the south-east, but the landing is bad on account of shallows which extend a long way off the beach. Large vessels lie as much as 4 miles out. Opposite the town the distance between high water and low water mark is about J of a mile, and rowang boats ground at as much as 100 yards from the shore. At the middle of the town a pier 100 yards in length and 20 in breadth extends seawards; but it is left high and dry at low tide, and at high water boats drawing 6 feet or more can only reach the seaward end of it. The bulk of the town consists of houses of sun-dried brick plastered with mud or Gach, but there are a few old Portuguese and Dutch houses lilt ill • Bandar 'Abbaa, so named by Shah 'Abbas in the 17th century, was known at tbe time of the Portuguese occupation of Hormuz, when it was the place of embarkation for that island, as Gombrtin, a name which continued to be current among Europeans till the end of the 18th century. ' Gombrun ' is believed to be a corruption of Gumruk- custorus. See LeStrange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate** ■■■ — 1 '® •ABBAS (BANDAR) 0 ^ of better material and a large number of huts; the frontage on the sea is f tli about half a mile. A number of the houses possess Badgirs, which here take the form of low square towers like those of English country churches, but more squat and with vertical slits in all four sides towards the top; each of these Badgirs is divided into 4 internal compartments or shafts by vertical walls which start from the corners and meet in the middle of the tower. Bandar 'Abbas was formerly enclosed by walls upon the landward side ; but these, where they still exist, are concealed fte [ by the quarters which have sprung up outside them. At the head of the pier stands the old Dutch factory, now called the Kulah-i-Farangi * m and used as a residence by the Deputy-Governor, who shares it with the Imperial Customs Department; the courtyard contains an extraordinary number of solidly built warehouses, up The condition of the town and foreshore is highly insanitary : there 'arit I are no scavengers and no system of conservancy. A &gt; Climate. —The climate of Bandar 'Abbas is notorious for its heat and rat, nnhealthiness ;t but there is no meteorological station and precise data s ol 1 are not available. The summer heat is almost intolerable this is due, ■med [ doubtless, to the combination of the moist air from the stagnant bay in fli front of the town and the heat reflected or radiated by the mountain Tie wall behind. Even in the depths of winter the mercury seldom falls dm below freezing point, and, when on the morning of the 29th of The January 19051 pools were found covered with a slight coating of )wn ice, the oldest inhabitants professed themselves unable to recall any dis similar occurrence. The months of January and February are cool ling and salubrious with occasional showers of rain, which are sometimes acl, heavy ; in March, April and May the temperature rises, the surround- tte ing country becomes dried up, and malaria prevails J in June, July, lile, August and September the heat is intense and most of the inhabit- At ants desert the town to escape it, but at the same time fever ii 1 diminishes; during October, November and December the heat is again ligl upon the wane and malarial fevers are once more rife. Mosquitoes are it. troublesome in the spring and autumn months. &gt;,«! JFtier and supplies.—The town contains wells, but the water is invariably bad aiid brackish and seems to conduce to guinea-worm and *Or European Hal;.' f A selection of lemaiks by travellers on the Sandar Abbas cliriiate will be found in Lord Curzon's Pt-rsia (II, 421).

I f10 'ABBAS (BANDAR) kidney disease ; the former complaint seems to be most prevalent in May ; June and July. The better-off among the inhabitants obtain their supply for drinking 1 from wells at Naiband village,, 3 miles to eastwards of the town ; and their demand has given rise to a regular traffic. Water from reservoirs at the town is used for drinking by the poorer classes^ but by others only for washing. Fish are generally abundant, being caught with seine nets, wicker baskets, cages, and lines ; but they become scarce in summer and in stormy weather. Grain is not obtainable in very large quantities ; vegetables are scarce; firewood is scanty and expensive; and fodder is almost un obtainable. About 250 cattle and 150 sheep and goats are owned in the town. Population. —Bandar ■'Abbas is describe.! as at present consisting of over 2,000 houses and huts, the more substantial structures outnumber ing the slighter in the proportion of 3 to 2. The cold-weather popula tion is about 10,000 souls ; the summer population, as already explained, is very much less. The bulk of the inhabitants belong to a hybrid race of mixed Persian, Baluchi, Arab and negro descent and are known as ^Abbasis; the lower orders of them speak a patois—also called ^Abbasi—which is a compound of Persian, Baluchi, Arabic and Swahili ingredients. The 'Abbasis are a poor-spirited race and hardly, it is said^, regard truth, honesty or charity as virtues. The poorer classes lead a squalid life in date-leaf huts. A cheap diet of fish and dates is all that they require^ and, when this has been provided, laziness and independence alike forbid them to work; this apathetic spirit among the labouring classes greatly impedes business and affords some justification for a local saying to the effect that nothing begun at Bandar ; Abbas is ever finished. Apart from the merchants and shopkeepers, who are mostly strangers from abroad, the people are boatmen, fishermen or labourers, and in the date-season they all become harvesters. The immigrants, upon whom the life of the place chiefly depends, are Persians from Lar (500 souls), from ^Avaz (300 souls) and from Bastak (150 souls) ; also Hindus (66 souls); Khojahs (67 souls) and Arabs (50 souls). The Hindus here are not accompanied by their families, but of the Khojahs half the number mentioned are females. Sunnis at Bandar ; Abbas are about half as numerous again as Shfahs and mostly belong to the Shafi ; i school, but some are Hanafis. About 300 or 400 persons^ chiefly Laris and ''Avazis, possess arms.1 'ABBAS (BANDAR) U Trade and commerce. —Local trade with the surrounding district of Shamil is inconsiderable; and the Bandar 'Abbas bazaar, wbich contains about 200 shops, is only moderately well supplied with goods. There are no local manufactures, and practically no skilled labour is available, The export and import business of Bandar 'Abbas, though its pre-emi nence as the port of Southern Persia has disappeared since the rise of Bushehr and th: development of the Shiraz route to the interior, is still valuable. Kirman and even Yazd still fall within the commercial radius of Bandar 'Abbas j and so also, to some extent, do Sistan and Khurasan. About 1903-04 the average annual value of the export trade of Bandar 'Abbas was approximately £130,000, more than half of which was with India, the United Kingdom being the customer of next greatest importance, The chief exports during the 7 years preceding 1906 were (in lakhs of rupees per annum) the following : fruits and vegetables (6), opium (3), wool (1|), drugs and medicines (U), gums (U) and carpets (li). Except opium sent to China, nearly all of these went to India. Imports at the same time (1903-04) were worth about £390,000 a year, among which goods to the value of £160,000 were from India, and to that of £135,000 from the United Kingdom. The principal imports durino- the period 1899-1906 were (in lakhs of rupees per annum) cotton piece-goods (14^), tea (13|), yarn and twist (9i), sugar (64), grain and pulse (2} ; dyeing and colouring materials (1|) and spices (1). Excep the cotton piece-goods, which were from Britain, and the sugar, which was from France, nearly all these imports were derived from India. A con siderable import trade in rifles which was formerly carried on here has been either extinguished or forced into other channels by the vigilance ot the Imperial Persian Customs Department. Drafts on Bombay and Karachi are obtainable at Bandar 'Abbas. Currency, weights and measures.-^ currency of Bandar 'Abbas, which is typical of this part of Persia, consists principally of silver and nickel. The silver coins are pieces of 1, 2, and 5 Grans, the double Or an beln&lt;&gt;■ the commonest. The nickel coins, minted in Belgium, are of 100 and 50 Dinars each and are used as small change ; they are styled respec tively Dushahi (or Chaharpul) and Yakshahi (or Dupul). The money table runs as follows: - 50 Dinars l Sliahi 20 Shahis ^ Q 1 ^ 11 10 Q ia ns = 1 Tuman12 'ABBAS (BANDAK) Indian rupees are also current: in 1905-06 the rate of exchange varied between 415 and 350 Qrans to the hundred rupees. The official standard of weight at Bandar ^Abbas^ as elsewhere in Persia, is now the Tabriz Man of 640 Misqals^ equal to 6*547 lbs. English avoirdupois. The unit generally employed in trade, however, is the so-called ^Abbasi Man of about 9 lb. English, which is subdivided as follows;— = 4 Cbaharaks = 6 Qiyas = 37| Misqa 1 Man 'Abbasi 1 Chaharak 1 Qiyas = 37| Misqals jLaI/«e The silver one and two-Qran pieces are supposed to weigh 1 and 2 Misqals respectively, but those of the most recent mintage are slightly under weight. Measures of length are as below :— 4 Girehs = 1 Chabarak 4 ChabSraks = 1 Zara'-i-Shah glJi or 41*143 English incbesi There is also a ZaraM-Dast ^ or cubit of 18 inches, a ZaraM- Bandari ^ of 9 Girehs or about 22 inches, and a Zara'-i-Lar of 12 Girehs. The English yard is used by cloth-merchants under the name of Var and is taken as equivalent to 14 Girehs. There are no liquid measures, fluids being sold by weight, and no measures of capacity. Square measurements are expressed in terms of length and bieadth, and there is no separate table of square measure* Shipping and sea communications. —The native craft of Bandar 'Abbas are :— Class.

All but 8 were under the British flag. Transport and communications.— owned in Bandar Abbas is small, amounting to only 10 horses and 350 donkeys ; there are no camels or mules. The town is dependent for pack-carriage on the sur- rounding district of Shamil, of which the resources are estimated in the article under that name. Between November and April there is a large influx of Afghans with camels, and at that season the number of camels in the neighbourhood sometimes rises to 2,000 or more. The inland routes which have their starting point at Bandur 'Abbas are dealt with in the article on the Shamil District. Bandar 'Abbas is now connected with Hanjam island by telegraph. The shore end of the cable is landed about | of a mile east of the pier at the centre of the town. Administration. —Bandar ; Abbas is one of the Gulf Ports and as such is subject to the Grovernor who has his head-quarters at Bushehr Town. The local representative of that authority is a fesideat Deputy-Grovernor who is his nominee ; this individual appears to be entitled in theory to exercise official influence over the Kalantar of the Shamil District, whose seat is at Ziyarat ; but in practice the Kalantar generally succeeds in maintaining a position of equality and the Deputy-Governor is ruler of the town only. The Deputy-Governor is an unsalaried official, who pays a premium for his post and recoups himself as best he can by the collection of dues and taxes; the predecessor of the present incumbent paid 5,000 Tumans for his appointment for one year, and the highest annual eum ever contracted for is said to have been 14,000 Tumans. From the Deputy-Governor^s sources of income the revenue of the sea customs, collected by the staff of the Imperial Persian Customs, are of course excepted. His chief items of revenue are a shop tax called Asnafiyeh m at the rate of Tumans per annum on each shop, and a passport tax called Tazkireh at 14^ Qrans for each person. Attempts are made from time to time to increase the revenue by the imposition of m various irregular imposts under the names of Dallali or brokerage, collected at the rate of per cent, from both seller and buyer; of Sar-i-Rigi a tax levied on goods placed in position for loading on transport animals ; of Maidani , a kind of octroi duty, at i a Qran to 8 Qrans per package according to size; and of Askaliy^h14 'ABBAS (BANDAR) or pierage, nominally for the upkeep of the pier or Astaleh, at to 5 Qrans per package according to size. Eahdari cjjUd, or road tolls, nominally for the maintenance of roads and the provision of road guards, are not at present levied in the neighbourhood of Bandar 'Abbas. The Deputy-Governor in fact has carte to make what he can out of the place during his lease, subject only to the restraints imposed by the presence of the Director of Customs and of the consular repre sentatives of foreign Powers. The town produces no land or agricultural revenue. Incidentally the Deputy-Governor conducts the general administration of the town and decides criminal and civil eases. He maintains no regular police, and his settlement of cases appears to be determined chiefly by corrupt or partisan considerations. As a criminal authority he has power to inflict fine, torture or imprisonment, but death sentences cannot be carried out without the sanction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The religious authorities, who in some districts of the Persian Coast aie respected and administer at least the semblance of civil justice, appear at Bandar Abbas to be utterly venal and are not spontaneously resorted to by litigants even as an alternative to the court of the Deputy-Governor. Fanaticism is absent and the ecclesiastical element at Bandar 'Abbas is a negligible quantity. There are no leading families : the most influential of the local notables at the present time is the Amin-ut-Tujjar, Haji Husain, who belongs to a family from Galehdar. The Persian Government is represented at Bandar 'Abbas by the officials of the Imperial Customs Department, at the head of whom is a Belgian Director, and by a Naib Karguzar jUSjIf wJU or deputy agent of the Persian Foreign Office. The office of the Customs Director has become a general court of appeal from the decisions of the Persian Deputy-Governor, and relations between the Director and the general body of Persian officials in the place are strained. The duties of the Naib Karguzar are nominal. The subjects and representatives of foreign Powers are supposed to have their dealings with him ; but in fact he merely plays the part of a spy in the interests of the Persian Gov ernment upon the proceedings of the Customs officials and of the consular representatives of foreign Powers. His salary is 50 Tumans a month. The place is undefended. The only armed men are 8 artillery-men, charged with the duty of firing the sunset gun, and about 40 Tufangchis0 'ABDULLAH (KHOR) 15 or armed l.vi« who .ro undor the orders ot tie Deputj-Goyevno, or th.

The Indian Government maintain at Bandar 'Abbas a Consul, who is a member of then- Pohtieal Department; and there are also an Indian post office and savings bank, of which the operations are exempt from Persian interference unless in t e matter of parcels, which are treated as imports and pass through the hands of the Persian Imperial Customs. The British Consulate is situated at Naiband, on the coast 3 miles east ^of the town and is surrounded by a garden and some trees which constitute almost the only trace of verdure in the locality. To the British Consul are confided the interests of 21 Hindu and 9 Muliammadan traders, British subjects, some of whom own trading vessels and pearl boats ; the Hindu com munity have in addition a Sarai (or residential quarter) and temple ot their own. One European British firm has a branch at Bandar'Abbas, and there are 3 native houses which act as agents for various British firms and shipping companies. The only other foreign power locally represented is Russia, who maintains a Consulate with a staff of a Consul, a Persian Ao-ent, an Armenian clerk, a Persian Mirza and 10 Cossacks. Russian trade however at Bandar 'Abbas is very small, and there is not a sing e resident Russian subject.

The southern shore is formed by Bubiyan island, off which, at the entrance of the Khor, lies a detached bank of hard sand, 8 miles long and nearly parallel to the island : this bank is called 'Aik . The entire Khor could be traversed by the largest ships at high water; and there are good anchorages for large vessels, in any state of the tide, both below Warbah island and in the northern continuation of the Khor above it. When the shores are overflowed by the tide, the navigation of Khor 'Abdullah, especially at the east end of Warbah island, is somewhat difficult owing to the absence of beacons and buoys.

The southernmost town in the ^Oman Sultanate, situated in 'Oman Proper, 20 to 25 miles south-south-west of Manah. To the northward is open country, without human inhabitants, sloping* gradually down towards Adam; on the southward the Rllba'-al-Khali begins imme diately outside the town. The road from Manah^ as it approaches Adam, passes between two arid hills of considerable elevation, namely Jabal Salakh ^ on the west, and Jabal Madhmar on the east. The town stands some 850 feet above sea level and has extensive date'planta tions irrigated from warm springs. The principal defence is a large fort built by the Imam Ahmad, the founder of the present A1 Bu Sa^Idi dynasty, who, according to one tradition, was born here : it was repaired in 1869 by Saiyid 'Azzan. The population is about 3,000 souls, com prising about 300 houses of Mahariq, 150 of A1 Bu Sa^ld, 30 of Hawashim and 20 of Bani HasMd. The only trade is in dates, which are exported to Mahot.

By some authorities ^Adan is considered to include the district of Qra'ah; if, however, we adopt the view that the two are distinct, ''Adan commences 16 miles south of Kuwait Town, immediately beyond Malah which is in Qra/ah, and extends 22 miles southwards to the Qrain hill which marks its boundary with the'ADAN 19 district of Salu^. Mi^aidniyat and Subailnyah^ mentioned below, are situated in the north-western and sonth-western corners respectively of ^Adan^ from which it appears that the breadth of the district from the sea inland varies from 10 to 20 miles. On the coasts''Adan reaches rather further north than Malah and includes Fanaitis^ mentioned further on. ''Adan is a plain of softish sand, but elevated so as to form a sort; o£ ridge : there is very little fuel, and almost the only serviceable product is Thamam grass of bad quality. The nature of such agriculture as exists is described in the articles on Fahailnl, Fantas, Abu Halaifah and Shi'aibah, the only villages in the district. These are virtually dependencies of Kuwait Town, to which merchants and others resort in the Aiyam-ar-Rabi■ , or period preceding the pearling season; the inhabitants are generally unrelated to one another and have been attracted to the service of some prosperous man who has dug a well.

The inhabitants of 'Adan, except im the fixed villages of FahaiMl, Fantas, Abu Halaifall and SM'aibah, are wandering Arabs who encamp now at one well^ now at another. The 'Adan district contains the only relics of antiquarian interest which have as yet been discovered in Kuwait Principality; these consist of some sarcophagi at a spot 6 miles from, the War ah hill, from which that hill lies at 258° and the westernmost part of the Burqan hill at 214°. The tombs lie east and west and ^are therefore not Muham- madan : they occupy a plot of high ground about 100 feet square. The sarcophagi are of gypsum cement^ about 5 feet long, 1 foot 8 inches broad and 2 feet deep ; the thickness of the sides is about 4 inches ; they are buried 3 to 4 feet below ground and a large number of stones of irregular shape, each about 2 cubic feet in volume are piled over them. There are no inscriptions. A copper coin found here seemed to be Persian &gt; of Baghad mintage, belonging to the 17th or 18th century A.D.* As used in Bahrain and Hasa the term 'Adan designates the whole desert tract which extends along the coast between the Qatlf Oasis and Kuwait. See Barr-al -'Adan. A term sometimes applied by mariners to the entire coastal region 'ACAN between the towns of Kuwait and Qatif in Eastern Arabia. Bedouins, (BAEE-AL however, seem to be unaware of any such general application of the Jj name; and among them, as among the settled population of the Kuwait Principality also, the term ^Adan is only understood as referring to the small tract near Kuwait Town which is described in this Gazetteer under the title 'Adan. The shore between Kuwait and Qatif is a low sandy and stony desert with occasional date-groves owned by Bedouins and a few isolated hills at intervals ; it is fronted throughout almost its entire length by extensive reefs, which in places have a passage between them and the mainland ; the bottom of the sea in many parts consists of white clay, and the water in consequence is not generally so clear as it is further to the south. * This spot was first visited and described by Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait, in March 1906,24 'ADAN (BAERA-AL-) The pearl banks decrease in number off this coast, and^ though there are some small pearl fisheries further to the northwards, they may be said to end near Abu 'Ali island. The districts composing' Barr-al-'Adan are enumerated in the articles upon the Kuwait Principality and the Hasa Sanjaq, and most of them form the subject of separate articles under their own names. Singular Adwani ^[5^ • A Hinawi tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, found chiefly in the Western Hajar district where they occupy the villages of Sawalih, Murbah, Qasra, Ghashab and Wabil in Wadi Fara'. They are found also on the coast'at Quryat and at Ghuwaisah in the sub-Wilayat of Saham. Those at Ghashab belong to a section called Bani Bakr jO ^ .Their total number is about 5,000 souls. At present they have no Tamimah or other recognised chiefs. Or Aflag, sometimes called with greater precision Aflaj (or Aflag) ad-Dawasir . A district of Southern Najd descending from Jabal Tuwaiq on the west to the Dahanah desert on the east north of it lie the districts of Hautah and Kharj, and on the south a great depression called Maqran ^ divides it from the Ruba'-al -Kliali. There is no means of determining the real size or exact position of Aflaj, but it is stated to be several caravan days in length from east to west j and the centre of Farshab, which is one of its subdivisions, is said to be a or 3 days south of the centre of Kharj, Divisions and physical features.—■'Yh.e Aflaj district consists of several tracts differing in their characteristics and distinguished by names, ^^eai the western end is Hadhafah ^ jj, region en - closed by Jabal Tuwaiq on the west and by Jabal Birk ^ —pro bably, but not certainly, a spur of Jabal Tuwaiq— on the north; Hadhafah is described as uninhabited and covered with thorny juno-Ie and is perhaps the part of Aflaj which lies between the hill villages mentioned in the topographical table below and the other villages further to the east. If this assumption is correct, Hadhafah is seamed by a series of parallel valleys which run eastwards from the hill villages ofAFLAJ 25 Aflaj to those of the plain ; conveying the drainage of the hills. Of these, the northernmost is one which descends to Wusailah from Haradhah and is joined between Wusailah and Ghail by another coming from Starah and Ghail; the N third passes Hamar and Wasit on its way to Kharfah and Saih ; a fourth has its rise near Haddar and ends near Badi^j the southernmost begins at Shutbah ; and arrives by way of Ijliyah at H inn, which is also in the neighbourhood of Badl^. On the east of Hadhafah is Aflaj proper, the most important sub division of the Aflaj district; it resembles Hadhafah in being bounded w on the north by Jabal Birk, a pass in which—called SalamTyah — connects it with the district of Hautah. The plain villages of Aflaj are all situated in this part of the district ; their names aud positions will be found in the topographical table at the end of this article. Besides the numerous wells irrigating date plantations and gardens^ Aflaj proper is said to contain as many as 14 springs. One of these, called Yahmum ^ rises a short distance to the east of Eajaijiyah village and forms a stream, which, after flowing about 3 miles, leaves a tall black hill on its left bank and continues on its way through stony ground until it is absorbed by sandy soil at a distance of about 20 miles from its source. Next below and to the east of Aflaj proper is the Farshah tract, on the northern side of which the Jabal Birk spur at length dies away and ceases to form a barrier between Aflaj and Kharj. Farshah has numerous wells and some wheat is grown, but there are no trees or villages; cultivation, where it exists, is defended by small forts. Parshah is followed on the east by Biyadhah , a tract which is adjoined on the north by Sahctbah. Biyadhah contains no springs or wells, but there are Sidr and other wild trees and some grazing. Apparently at the south-eastern corner of Biyadhah is a prominent, dark- coloured hill named Da^ajah , having wells to which Bedouins resort. East of Biyadhah again is Haraisan ; Da^ajah, just mentioned, marks the point of transition from the somewhat sandy surface of Biyadhah to the more pebbly ground of Haraisan. The flood water of Haraisan is carried eastwards into the Dahanah by a depres- uu sion, called Mahammil , which is barren but contains some grazing. Shutbah &lt;uLi , a tract situated in a recess in the eastern flank of Jabal Tuwaiq and containing a village of the same name, is generally reckoned to Aflaj; but it lies in the direction of Widyan Dawasir and is included by some authorities in that district; its drainage appears to escape north-eastwards into the neighbourhood of Badi ' in Aflaj proper.26 aelaj We may note that the Aflaj district is apparently skirted on the sonth throughout a considerable proportion of its lengthy by a depression called Jadwal which is to the north of Maqran and parallel to that valley, but of much smaller size. The beginning and end of Jadwal have not been successfully located; but it appears to be shorter than Maqran, which is said to extend the whole way from Jabal Tuwaiq to the Dahanah, and it is positively asserted that Jadwal and Maqran do not communicate with one another. According to some authorities the Jadwal depression receives a torrent called Harim ^ from the direction of Badl ' and swallows up the Yahmum stream which, as we have seen, rises near Rajaijiyah. Maqran is said to contain large Sidr and other trees, and wells at which animals can be watered. Population. —As will be apparent from the topographical table which concludes this article, the settled inhabitants of Aflaj are mostly Dawasir landowners and their cultivators of the Bani Khadhir tribe; but there are also a few representatives of the Fadhul, Sahul and Sabai and possibly of the 'Allizah and of other smaller but still distinct tribes, besides negro and half caste slaves.^ The total number of the fixed population of Aflaj may be roughly estimated at 22,000 souls. The people are Wahhabis. Agriculture and general resources, —The topographical table at the end of this article and the related articles to which it affords a clue contain some information as to the crops and livestock of Aflaj. It appears that the agricultural staples are dates, wheat, barley and lucerne, and iu a lesser degree fruits, maize and millet. The fruit trees oO the hill villages are superior to those of the plains; but, in regard to livestock, the lower lying villages are the better provided with horses. The domestic animals are those of Southern Najd generally, viz., camels, donkeys, horned cattle, sheep and goats. Admiuidration.—lw comparison with the more northern districts of the Wahhabi dominions Aflaj is backward and uncivilised; and, in common with the neighbouring but still more remote district of Widyan Dawasir, it seems to play but a small part in the political life of the country. Aflaj appears to have been but little affected by the internecine struggle, since 1880, between the rulers of Hail and Riyadh ; but it is ^'According to Palgrave the half caste population at Kharfali in 1862 almost equalled the Arab in numbers and, like full negroes, frequently wore nothing but a waist cloth. Hospitality was meagre, and a want of sociability and a coarseness of manners were observable. It should be added that Palgrave's account of bis journey to Kharfali does not inspire confidence, chiefly on account of the position which he assigns to it and to Aflaj with reference to adjoining districts.apl A j 27 stated that the Waliliabi Amir now extracts an annnal revenue of about ISOjOOO from the district, of which ^ is paid by the Bedouins and | by the villagers. The control of the settled villages of the plain appears to be vested in the headmen (here called Amirs) of the principal villages of Badi', Kliarfah, Lailah, Raudliah and Saih, each of them being answerable for the component hamlets of his own group : in the hills, however, each village is independent of the others and subject to its own Shaikh, the only exception being Wasit which is under Hamar.

Water is at 4 to 5 fathoms below the surface. There are said to be 7,000 date palms and a few fruit trees, be sides the usual crops ana domestic animals of Aflaj. The name is said to be due to the fact that the hills from which floods reach the vil lage are of a blood- red colour and that the flood water itself is red. There are extensive date- groves, besides the usual fruit trees, cereals, lucerne and melons; also the ordinary domestic animals and 25 horses. Water stands 6 to 7 fathoms below the surface. There are two routes between Ghail and Haradhah, one direct and one by Starah. The date trees here are estimated at 8,000 and the fruit trees are specially good. Water is at 3 to 4 fathoms.

Ahram stands at a short distance from the right bank of the Ahram or Bahushi stream, a little below its exit from the hills, and is overlooked by the Kuh Gugardi mountain a few miles to the north-east; its elevation above the sea is 360 feet. The town, which is not now walled, covers an area of nearly J a square mile ; it is enclosed by date-groves on the north and south, and palms partially mask its western face also, On the south-west side is a stone fort; the residence of the Khan of Tangistan^ which has walls 40 feet high and round towers at the four corners. The town within is crowded with mud and stone houses and contains many mat huts, but a large proportion of the houses are ruinous and uninhabited. The inhabitants number about 1,500 souls and belong to the various tribes which, under the common denomination of Tangistanis, compose the population of the surrounding district. They depend on the cultivation of wheat, barley, dates and water-melons and have no industrial or commercial resources; communication with Bushehr however is maintained by constant caravans. Animals are 20 horse.AHWAZ DISTRICT 33 5 mules^ 40 camels, 200 donkeys, 70 cattle and 1,500 sheep and goats, and the date palms are estimated at 20,000.

Natural features and general topogr The great plain between the Karun river and the Ramuz District, which has no general name though parts of it are distinguished and designated, lies entirely in the Ahwaz District, of which it forms about half; this plain is generally grassy, and in favourable years it is sprinkled with patches of wheat cultivation! After rain it becomes swampy, and in some seasons the mosquitoes are very troublesome. The Gupal stream enters the plain at its eastern end and forms a marsh at Shakheh towards its centre ; and the principal hills are those of Ahwaz and Bunneh, elsewhere described. A considerable strip of country, parallel to the Karun river on its east side, is drained by the Malih hollow which begins near Ahwaz and ends near Gharaibeh in the Fallahiyell District; a ridge of higher country divides the marshes formed by the Malih in its lower course from the overflow southwards towards the Jarrahi of the surplus waters of the Gupal stream. The main feature, however, of the Ahwaz District is the Kariin river bisecting it, which is the subject of a separate article. The part of the district to the west of the Karun is still, except for information from natlve sources, virtually a terra incognita. 11 has been suggested that ,|yfc| of the word (Huz) common m (Ahwaz) is a cornrption of j the plural jT- common in Southern 'Arabistan in the sense of a tivated aiea 01 estate.

During this period Raghai weh became a place of refuge for discon tented subjects of the Shaikh emigrating from his jurisdiction. Eventually in 1905 an arrangement was reached between the Shaikh and the Ilbaigi of the Bakh- tiyaris by which the former was per mitted to remove his subjects and also42 AHWAZ DISTRICT Name.

Villages and population. —The fixed villages of the district are almost without exception situated upon the Karun, the largest being Nasiri^ Muzaffari, AhwaZj Braikeh and Wais; and the settled population of the district, including besides the Karun villages the large semi-per manent settlements of Banneh and Shakheh, may be estimated at 13^000 souls. The sedentary population consists chiefly of Bawiyeh, Al Bu Kurd^ Dizfulis^ Shushtaris and Ma^awiyeh; but among them there are Hamaid; Zarqan^ Hawashim and Muhaisin^ and a very few 'Ikrish and Sabians. The KVab of Banneh and Shakheh are here reckoned among the fixed inhabitants of the district, and there is proportion of miscellan-(76) AHWAZ DISTRICT 43 eous Arabs and Persians. The mud brick used in domestic architecture is of the same pattern as in the Jarrahi District. The nomad population is very much larger, amounting to about 37,930 souls, and includes the bulk of the Bawiyeh tribe and of the 'Anafijeh* besides these there are Faratiseh, Hamaid, Hardan, Hawashim, Jama', Ka'ab } Marawuneh, Muhaisin, Al Bu Rawayeh, Bait Sa'ad, Salamat, Shawakir, Bani Tamim and Zarqan ; ot these the Hamaid, Hardan and Salamat are chiefly found on the outskirts of the district, in the quarter to which the second of the topographical tables given above refers. . . 1 . The following is a tabular account of the principal among the minor tribes which have their headquarters in, or are peculiar to, this district :• Name. Location. Fighting strength. Remarks. Taratiseh Chai Faqaisat. 60, of whom 20 are mounted and 20 are armed with rifles. The Faratiseh are poli tically allied to the Bawiyeh, but they are said to be of Bani Lam stock and to have immigrated from the neighbour hood of 'Amarah on the Tigris. Hawashim Muwailheh and Aminiyeh on the Karun, and scat tered. 150, of whom 130 have rifles; but none are mounted. The Hawashim have 100 mules and donkeys and pay in their reve nue at Wais. The tribe are said to bo related to the Kinanah section of the Bani Lam. Jama 5 On the G-upal stream. 150, of whom 60 are mounted and 60 have rifles. 1 They are politically connected with the Bawiyeh 4 , but pay revenue at Kut-ash- Shaikh to the Samsam- ud-Dauleh, Ilkhani of the Bakhtiyaris. They draw their fresh water at Hilweh. Their livestock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. Ma'awiyeh Braikeh on the Karun. 200, of whom 60 have rifles and 30 are mounted. At one time subordi nate to the Bawiyeh, but now recognised as a separate tribe.44 ahwaz district Name, Position. Fighting strength. Remarks. Marawuneh, 'V Ri^ht bank of the Karun between Aminiyeh and Li'aimi and to 20 miles inland; their focus is at Luq- bair. 200, all with rifles, of whom 60 are mount ed. This tribe pay half their revenue through the 'Anafijeh and the other half direct to the Shaikh of Muham- mareh's Deputy* Governor at Kasiri. They own 100 camels, 400 cattle and 5,000 sheep and goats, Kawayeh (Al Bu} Li'aimi on the Karun and Khai- rabad on the Karkheh, the latter in the Diz ful District. 200, of whom 50 are mounted and all are armed with rifles. The position of the Al Bti Rawayeh in reve nue matters is the same as that of the MarawuneK Their livestock are 100 camels, 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. They bear an evil reputation as thieves and robbers. Shawakir yir* J Shawweh. 50, of whom 10 are mounted and 20 have riOes. They are subjects of the Shurafa of the Hawizeh District, but their revenue is paid through the Shaikh of the Bawi- yeh, with whom they are politically allied. They have 20 camels, 60 cattle and 800 sheep and goats. Apart from the Hawashim and Ma'awiyeh^ all of whom are settled and from 20 families of Al Bu Eawayeh in the Dizful District, these minor tribes appear to be entirely nomadic and to represent a Bedouin population of about 2 ; 250 souls. They all cultivate wheat and barley, and some of the Hawashim are weavers. Agriculture, trade and communications. —These subjects are dealt with in the general article on ' Arabistan ; but here it may be noted that there is an old disused canal leaving the Karun at Ahwaz Village, which runs southwards for 30 miles and is lost in the marshes on the right bank of the Jarrahi west of Gharaibeh. On the western side of the Karun a canal, it is said, formerly took ofp at Maqtu'' and ran to Ha .Wlzeh.AHWAZ VILLAGE 45 Administration. —The district is subject to the Shaikh of Muliam- mareh who manages it through a Deputy-Governor with head-quarters at Kasiri —at present a nephew named Haji Shaikh Rahmah; the Deputy Governor only acts on orders from the Shaikh and has little real power outside the village in which he resides. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is also represented in the district by various political agents: the principal of these at the present time are Mulla Thani at Kut-an- Naddafiyeh Kablr, through whom the revenue of the Hamaid and Faratiseh and that of a few of the 'Anafijeh is collected; Mulla Abus Saiyid at Muzaffari, who is responsible for the A1 Bu Kurd commu nity in that neighbourhood; and Shaikh 'Anayeh at Umm-at-Tamair, who is in charge of the right bank of the Karun generally and through whom part of the Hardan tribe pay their revenue. These agents usually deal with their master direct and not through his representative at Nasiri, but there is no fixed rule in the matter. The Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains police posts on the Karun in this district at Kut-an-Naddafiyeh SaghTr (10 rifles), at Milaihan (20 rifles, of whom 10 are mounted) and at Qajariyeh (60 rifles, of whom 50 are mounted). For administrative purposes the Ahwaz district is roughly divided into two tracts, that of Bawiyeh on the east, and that of Karun upon the river. So much of the district as lies west of the Karun is claimed by the Nizam-as- Saltaneh as his property, and it is understood that the Shaikh of Muhammareh pays him 3,000 Tumans a year on account of the tract but does not admit the validity of his title. © v A considerable village on the left bank of the Karun river, situated at the head of the rapids to which it gives its name and at the western end of a range of sandstone hills which subside before reaching it but re-appear at some distance on the opposite side of the river. The elevation of Ahwaz is 220 feet above the sea, and it stands upon a somewhat high bank; the country behind it is desert. At the north end of the village, on an elevated salient of the river bank, there was until recently a large, dilapidated, rectangular Persian fort, but it has now been pulled down for the sake of the materials : an Imamzadeh shrine is still a feature of the place. In the stream, opposite to the lower end of the village, are some mills which are removed in time of flood; and a little below these again is a bluff or rock, forming part of the bank and traversed by galleries AHWAZ Ji/i VILLAGE !|46 AHWAZ VILLAGE which probably carried mill races in former times. Immediately below this rock is a garden on the bank belonging to the Mu'in-ut-Tirjjar. Houses number about 160, and, except a few which are of stone, are built of sun-dried bricks. The population is about 800 souls ; most of them are Arabs of mixed tribes ; but there are some Persians; the majority are engaged in agriculture, but about 60 mules are kept. To Ahwaz belong 17 sailing boats of 10 to 15 tons burden, besides the river steamer ' Shushan ' of 30 tons capacity and her barge of 50 tons ; there is also an iron barge belonging to the Mu'm-ut-Tujjar. Without the help of sails the native boats, which can be and are towed up the rapids when necessary, drop down the river from Shalaili on the Gargar to Ahwaz in 3 days, or with a good stream sometimes in 24 hours, and from Ahwaz to Muhaminareh in from 4 toi days ; some pilgrims to Karbala adopt this means of conveyance, especially those from Shushtar and the Bakhtiyari country and a few from Isfahan. There is a ferry at Ahwaz with two small boats. The rapids are fully described in the article on the Karun river. Ahwaz is situated in the Southern 'Arabistan district of Ahwaz and its revenues are equally divided between the local headman and the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Ahwaz, under the name of Hurmuz - Ardashlr, was in early times the capital of ^Arabistan ; but it suffered greatly during the rebellion of the Zanj in the 9th century A.D., and was for a time the residence of their leader. It was partially restored by the Buyids in the 10th century; and the main town, situated on the east bank of the Karun, was then connected by a masonry bridge with a quarter which stood on an island in the river.* The principal tribe, Bedouins being excluded, of the Kharj district in Southern Najd ; they are found in the villages of ^Adhar, Dilam, Sulaimiyah and Yamamah. They are possibly identical with the section called'lyadah of the great 'Anizah tribe; but some authorities would identify them with the 'Aidh section of the Qahtan. A very few 'Aid are found also in the ; Aridh District, and there are some 'Aid or 'Aidh in Zilfi in Sadair. # Vide Le Strange.'ATN (WADI-AL-) 47 A valley in the Dhahirall district of the 'Oman Sultanate, which, 'AIN rising in Jabal-al-Kor at the eastern end of Dhahirah, runs westwards (WADI-AL-) to the neighbourhood of 'Ibri where it joins Wadi Sanaisal.

The Al Bu 'Ainain gain their liveli hood as pearl-divers, pearl-merchants and boatmen. None of them are pastoral; but a proportion, though smaller than in the case of the other settled tribes of Qatar, live in tents in the interior during part of the cold season. The Dohah quarter of Dohah is said to have been founded early in the 19th century by Al Bu 'Ainain, who did not remain there long but were removed in 1828 to Ruwais and Fuwalrat and subsequentlv settled at Wakrah. AJA or A range of mountains in the Jabal Shammar principality and one of IJA the ehicf physical features of northern Najd; it bounds the Batn plain (JABAL) in which Hail stands on tlie north-west, being interposed between Batn ' ^ andthe NafQd and divided from the latter by a strip of hard gravelly ground in places 2 hours wide. The length of Aja is about 75 miles * its breadth is about 15, and its general direction is from north-east to south-west. Its elevation is fairly constant and about 1,000 feet above the surrounding plains, but one peak (Jabal Fara' ^ ) immediately to the west of Hail is 5,550 feet hight and so rises fully 2,000 feet above the town. There are no subordinate ranges or spurs of importance. The material of Jabal Aja is a coarse-grained granite of « rov r - ,, JLYWI /Kok - j j . _ t&gt; vj, JJHIK or reddish-brown colour ; the strata are inclined to the horizo', at an an-le of 55° ; and the sides of the hills, in places vertical, are generally go steen that the number of points from which they can be ascended is limited Wells and springs abound ; the hills bear brushwood and, in valleys where there 1 s water, fine palms ; there is also a tree, resembling a tamarisk in appearance, which yields gum mastic and is perhaps the Talh A s eci of wild goat is found. Snow is seen, but not often, upon Jabal The principal features of the range are two : first a remarkable e nclosed valley in the east flank of the range near Hail, called 'Aqdah.

The entrance of the Ei^ on the east is close to Qafar and the exit on the west is near Muqaq ; the distance between these points may be 20 miles in a straight line. The crest of the intermediate pass is about 1,000 feet above the level of Hail ; the descent from it on the west is steep and rugged, and at some distance below the top on the western side is a place where cold springwater falls from a clift 1 .

In most of them are date palms, owned by Shammar Bedouins,* which fiourish on the water of the subsoil; the owners, who live elsewhere at other times, camp in the groves to enjoy the fruit from May to September and obtain their drinking water from wells which are numerous and often very shallow. The large valley of 'Aqdah is the only one permanently inhabited. Tuwarin contains Himyaritic inscriptions and ancient drawings on the rocks.

This is the only name by which the Portuguese Fort on Bahrain Island is known among the surrounding villages; but the townspeople of Manamah, especially the Persians among them, generally call it Qal'at-al-Farangi . The fort, a regular bastioned Portuguese construction of the 16th century, is now an untenanted ruin. It is situated on the north coast of Sahraiu Island, 3i miles west of the Manamah fort, stands ^about 150 yards from the beach, and covers nearly 2 acres of ground. The top of the highest portion still standing is 80 feet above sea level; and there is a deep well in the centre, lined with excellent masonry, but now dry. j| i AJIRDB Or'Ajairub; by Persians called Ab-i-Girub ^ ■ A considerable V^ e permanent stream in the Dizful District of 'Arabistan, having its source in a spring near the village of Qal'eh Qazi, and joining the Diz river on its left bank some 3 or 4 miles below Kut 'Abdush Shah. The villages of Qazi, Shama'un and Biyawtiyun are irrigated by the 'Ajirub, which also forms the border between the portion of the Kathir tribe under Shaikh Farhan Asad on the east and those under Shaikh Haidar on the west. 'AJMAN TOWN and PRINCI PALITY* Sometimes pronounced 'Aiman. A town on the coast of Trucial 'Oman forming, with its immediate environs, a small independent principality of which the political position is defined in the article on Trucial 'Oman. It is situated 6 miles south-west of Hamriyah and * For authorities, maps, charts, etc., see first footnote to article Trucial 'OmSn. mamKammoaaaBKm.© ^AJMAN TRIBE 53 5 miles nortli-east of Sharjah Town^ on the south side of the entrance to a creek which^ having- a bar of sand and not of rock with 5 feet of water on it at low tide., is one of the most accessible on this part of the coast; the sea anchorage off ^Ajman^ however ; is bad. Fresh water for drinking is obtained from wells 9 feet deep^ of which the locality is constantly changing. The population of man is about 750 souls^ composed of 25 houses of Na'im of the Qaratisah^ Hamirat^ and A1 Bu Dhanain sections^ 80 houses of A1 Bu Mahair, houses of Sudan, 14 of A1 Bu Kalbi, 5 of Masaibah and 12 of Shaqosh. All the inhabitants are pearl divers and fishermen; they own about 40 pearl boats and 25 fishing boats ; besides some 60 camels ; 20 horses^ 100 donkeys ; 100 cattle and 400 goats. The plantations of the town contain about 1 ; 900 date trees : there is no other cultivation. One or two boats are built here each year, but most of those in use have been obtained from Sharjah or Dibai. The authority of the Shaikh only extends 2 miles inland^ and^ upon the sea ; 1| miles south-westwards and 2^ miles north-eastwards, embracing on the last-mentioned side part of the tract called Zora : his dominions are thus an enclave in Sharjah territory. There is no dependent village, and no Bedouin tribe owes allegiance to the Shaikh, who is of the Qaratisah section of the NVim : a political alliance and friendly relations, however, generally subsist between the inhabitants of 'Ajman and the people of Baraimi; and the present Shaikh of ^Ajman is a maternal uncle of the present Shaikh of Umm-al -Qaiwain. The Shaikh of ^Ajman derives a revenue of about Rs. 4,600 a year from the pearl fishers of his port, and he owns some date gardens at Dhaid of which the yield is inconsiderable. 'AJMAN TRIBE Distribution. —The head-quarters of the tribe are in the Sanjaq of Hasa, where the tract of Taff, the southern half of Habl, all Jauf, and Biyadh as far south as 'Oqair Port are recognised as being ^Ajman terri tory. The 'Ajman also occupy the northern confines of Jafurah »nd are generally found in Kharmah, especially about Zarnuqah ; their winter An important nomad Arab tribe in Eastern Arabia. The singular is ^Ajmi ; and in the mouth of Bedouins the name generally becomes ; Aimi (singular) and ^Aiman (plural).54 'AJMAN TRIBE quarters are partly in Summan ; in the cold weather a few of them occa sionally visit Qatar and some of the A1 ^Arjah and A1 Shamir sections habitually camp in the Kharj district of Southern Najd. These are the ordinary limits of the tribe^ but, when as at present they are on good terms with the Bani Khalid^ they wander over the whole country as far north'vards as .Kuwait Town. Some settled ''Ajman detached from the tribe are found in Kuwait Town and there are a few in the fixed villages of Wadi-al -Miyah, Religion) character and mode of life. —In religion the ^Ajman are Hanbali Sunnis. As a tribe they are reputed hospitable, steadfast, and trustworthy according to Bedouin standards; and their Women enjoy a considerable degree of social freedom, even in the presence of strangers. By occupation the ^Ajman are pastoral; and they own many horses, camels, sheep and goats, but have not a large number of cattle j their camels are bought by merchants from the north, and even from Syria^ who visit their country for the purpose every year. The dealings of the ■'Ajman are principally with the Hasa Oasis, where they dispose of their marketable wares, including horses, and supply themselves with the products of civilisation; part of their dates, however, they obtain from the Qatif Oasis. Some of the tribe own date plantations in the oasis of Hasa, but none of them have any in Qatlf. The tents of the 'Ajman are next in size to those of the Bani Khalid and are generally black with a white lining. Divisions, numbers and arms.- —The following table shows the principal divisions of the tribe, together with some particulars concerning them :— Section. Sub-section. Alleged fighting strength. Present sub-sectional Shaikh (etc.)i 'Arjali (11) (J I 'Arjah (Al) Do. Mirja' (Al) 100 • Do, Rizq (Alj &lt;33; 15058 'AJMAN TRIBE To these may be added the A1 Jiblan section o£ the Mutair^ who have separated from their own tribe and at present form part of the ''Ajman ; and it may be noted that the Maraziq of the Shlbkuh District of the Persian Coast lay claim, to ^Ajman descent. In Arabia the various sections of the tribe are intermingled throughont their whole territory and have not separate locations. The estimate of fighting strength, amounting to 10^000 men, appears high; it indicates a total tribal strength of about 85,000 souls, but regard b'eing had to the wideness of the area over which the tribe extend the number is perhaps not excessive. The ''Ajman are said to muster 2 5 000 mounted men, all of whom are armed with Martini rifles, for spears and swords are now hardly to be found in the tribe. Political position, —The ^Ajman, whom some authorities would connect with the Qahtan, state that they are descended from Shurafa of Najran; but their pretensions are generally disallowed^ or at least ignored, for no special consideration is shown them in virtue of the origin to which they lay claim. On the other hand, their tribal strength makes their alliance valuable and their enmity a serious danger; but in politics they are a shifting and inconstant factor, being, as they them selves have been known openly to profess, 'the friends of those who treat them best/' At the present time the ''Ajman are on good terms with the Bani Khalid, the two tribes being mutually free of each other's country ; and they have somewhat similar relations with the Bani Hajir, who, after providing themselves with Eafiqs from the 'Ajman, range as they please in the ^Ajmi districts. With the Al Morrah, whose camps intermingle with theirs on the south side of the Hasa Oasis, the 'Ajman are presently at feud; and they were also at enmity with the late Ahmad-bin-Thani, Shaikh of the Ma^adhid of Qatar, but with Jasim, the senior Shaikh of that tribe, their dealings are amicable. As a body, they are particularly well disposed to Ibn Sa'ud, whose cause they sup ported throughout the recent wars in Najd ; and they are friendly as a rule, though not at the present time (1907), with the Shaikh of Kuwait. In the desert the 'Ajman do not acknowledge the authority of the Turkish Government; but in the vicinity of Hofuf, where a large number of them are encamped for 6 months in the year, they are more submissive; and those who actually enter the bounds of the Hasa Oasis pay as Government revenue in each season 1 Riyal ou account0 AKHDHAIl (JABAL; 59 of every 5 camels and the same on acconnt of every 10 sheep and goats. The Shaikhs^ however; are subsidised by the Porte, the more important among them receiving in this manner $50 a month in cash and monthly rations of the value of $15 or further cash in lieu of the rations ; and it is calculated that the Turks in this manner pay more to the tribe than they receive from it. The principal Shaikhship of the tribe is vested in a family of the A1 Naja ; division of the Al Ma^idh. The present holder of the position is Muhammad-bin-Hazam-bin-Hithlain, who attained to it in 1905 by the murder of his relation Shabib-bin-Hithlain. Position and extent. —A mass of mountains in the Western Hajar of AKHDHAR^ the 'Oman Sultanate, forming the highest portion of the Hajar range (JABAL) and dividing the district of 'Oman Proper on the south from that of Batinah on the north. Its axis lies west-north-west and east-south-east, its eastern extremity being at Najd-al-Mughbanyah, the head of Wadi SamcLil ,and its western at or near the head of Wadi Bani Ghafir, The length of the range proper is thus about 50 miles and its breadth on the average about JiO; but it throws off from its eastern end a great unnamed spur which runs for nearly 30 miles to the north-east and forms a barrier dividing Wadi Samail from the Wadi-al-Hammam branch of Wadi Ma'awal. Or Configuration. —The top of Jabal Akhdhar is described as a table- 6 land which is highest, throughout its length, upon the side next the sea. From the crest the fall on the northern side is abrupt and precipitous ; but inland the plateau first declines gradually to southwards and then drqps, by cliffs less remarkable than those of the seaward face, to the plains of 'Oman Proper. The chief peak of Jabal Akhdhar is Sham or Wisham 9 nearer to the west than to the east end of the range ; it is 9,940 feet high and is visible from the sea at a distance of over 100 miles. Another peak is Khadhar , 7,500 feet high, at the south east corner between Wadi Mi'aidin and Wadi Halfain, above Muti in the latter. One of the highest points on the limb of Jabal Akhdhar tvhich reaches to the north-east is Jabal Nakhl, 7,000 feet. The northern # A distant view of Jabal Akhdhar from the sea will be found in Chart No. 2373 — 2837 A.60 AKHDHAR (JABAL) f'i ' .,1 flank of Jabal Akhdhar gives birth to tlie Wadis Bani KharUS, Fara', Sahtan and Bani Ghafir which descend to Batinah; while Wadi Mi'aidin and Wadi Tanu£ ; both draining to 'Oman Proper, are the principal hollows that furrow its southern slopes. Routes. —Routes across Jabal Akhdhar are neither numerous nor easy. The best known is one which leaves Wadi Bani KharUS near the village of ^Aliya (2,400 feet), and rises by an extremely steep and partly artificial road to the top of the ^Aqabat-al-Hajar (8,000 feet), the ascent occupying, if local donkeys are used, about 5 hours ; from this pass it traverses an undulating plain to the head of a ravine containing Saicj village^ to which it descends about 400 feet by a stairway cut in the rock j the way beyond Saiq lies through the adjacent village of Sharaijah, whence it drops into Wadi Mi'aidin. The other principal route across the main mass of Jabal Akhdhar is one called Tanq-ash-Shass which leads from 'Awabi to Saiq and Sharaijah and thence to Tanuf; it is narrow and inconvenient but, like that already described, it is passable by animals. Sharaijah is connected with Tanuf, 21 miles distant to the westward, by a route practicable for mules and donkeys, which could be rendered passable for camels; to the east a difficult track, fit only for men and local donkeys, leads from Sharaijah over the southern slopes of Jabal Khadhar and thence for about 3,000 feet down a steep stone staircase to Muti in Wadi Halfain. To these routes may be added a footpath called ^Aqabat-al-Qatt «• 6m by which a strong walker can cross the hills between Nakhl and Wadi Samail in about 6 hours, and 'Aqbat-al-Fiq &lt;3^1 , an inferior route by which Jabal Akhdhar can be ascended from the north. Geology and natural Jabal Akhdhar consists, so far as is known, entirely of limestones of the ; Oman series : regarding these the Appendix on Geology^ may be consulted. In some places the rock lies exposed in large tabular masses ] in others it has hollows containing a shallow earthy deposit ; in others again it is covered with good soil. The high plateau is stony, intersected by ravines and covered with grass in tussocks which must afford good grazing after rain ; it bears evergreen bushes and even some trees of considerable size. Animals are the wolf, hysena, wild cat and Wa'al or Jayakar's wild goat; birds are few, principally kites and vultures. ^ See the other volume of this Gazetteer.'AM (ABU) 61 Population, villages and agriculture. inhabitants of Jabal Akhdhar nearly all belong to the Bani Riyam and HabuS tribes. The principal villages are Bani Habib, Saiq, and Sharaijah in the hills and Musairah, Mr'aidin and Misfah in Wadi Mi'aidin ; of these Sharaijah is the largest and most important. The cultivated lands of these villages are generally terraced and irrigated ; the crops include wheat and legu minous plants, but most attention is given to fruit culture. The hillsides in some places are covered with vineyards, producing white and black grapes which are made into wine or raisins; and pomegranates are grown in great profusion and exported. Peaches, apricots, figs, mul berries and melons are among the other fruits. There are also walnut- trees, and a kind of coriander called But which grows wild. Outside the villages possessing irrigation the people are pastoral, depend ing for subsistence on their flocks and herds, but they are not nomadic. The total population of Jabal Akhdhar, the upper villages of Wadi Mi'aidin being included, is about 3,500 souls. A considerable village on Bahrain Island, 6 miles south-west of 'ALI Manamah fort and near to the south-west end of the date groves which cover the north end of the island. 'Ali consists of 200 houses of Baharinah, who are lime-burners, potters and cultivators of dates. The largest of the prehistoric tumuli of Bahrain adjoin this village on the south side. Date palms are estimated at 8,250 trees and livestock include 35 donkeys and 10 cattle. An uninhabited island, about ] 2 miles long from east to west, lying 'ALI off the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq about 16 miles south-east of B^as-al- (ABU) Bidya'. The nearest point on the mainland is the extremity of the so- called Jazirat-al-Batinah m Biyadh (I), distant 3 miles to southward ; the passage between the two, known as Maqta'-ar-Raiyafah ^sU' is not navigable. The eastern point of Abu 'Ali, named Has Abu 'Ali, is low and rocky ; it has an anchorage on its south side, protected from the Shamal, in a bay which is known as Dohat Abu 'Ali. A cape on1 62 'ALI (ABU)- the south side of the island near its western end is known as Has-ar- Kaiyafah, and another on the same side but near the opposite end as Has Barabakh Abu 'Ali island is closely surrounded by pearl banks : on its north side, at about J of the distance from its west to its east end, is a bank known as Dhahr-al-Baidhah; a short distance off its north coast, rather nearer to the eastern than to the western end, is another called Dhahr Abu ^Ali; adjoining Eas Abu ^Ali is a bank named after that cape; and in the strait between the island and the mainland are the bank of Batin at the eastern entrance and that of Barabakh farther in. [ i i 'ALI Singular 'Aliyi ,An Arab tribe of Trucial • 'Oman and the (AL or AHL) Shibkuh district in Persia : they belong to the Ghafiri faction and are Ja|—JT described as Hanbali Sunnis in religion, but are virtually Wahhabis. The bulk of the tribe are now settled in towns,—1,000 families residing at Umm-al -Qaiwain^ 200 at Sharjah and 150 at Ras-al -Khaimah. The Bedouin portion of the tribe in Trucial 'Oman number about 140 families and frequent the country from Umm-al -Qaiwain to Jazirat-al -Hamrah and as far inland as Falaj A1 ^Ali. The A1 'Ali of the Persian side are separately described in the article on Shibkuh : by them the A1 ^Ali of Trucial 'Oman are regarded as forming a division called Bin Mu^alla ^ . The Al 'Ali generally claim connection with the Mutair of Najd, and by some authorities the Bani Bu 'All of the 'Oman Sultanate are considered to be of one stock with the Al ^Ali. i 'ALI One of the largest Arab tribes in Bahrain and fairly numerous also (AL BIN-) j n Qatar. In Bahrain they are found at Muharraq Town (400 j' houses) and at Hadd (100 houses) ; in Qatar, exclusive of some of the Ma'adhld section, they number 350 households at Dohah. m Below follow the principal sections and sub-sections, according to the best information obtainable, of the Al Bin-^Ali; but it is not certain that all the divisions specified originally belonged to the tribe, and there is even reason to think that some of them are separate,, tribes which have(5 'ALI (AL BIN-) 63 undergone affiliation, The peculiar ease of the Ma'adhid * is discussed in a separate article.

Some of the Al Bu Shadhaib are said to live with the Manasir in Trucial * The leading families of the Ma'adhid whose names are printed in italics in the table are those who, either in whole or part, repudiate or do not claim membership of the Al Bin-'Ali tribe.64 11 f if 'ALI (AL BIN-) Hi 'Oman J and one of the A1 Bin-Durbas family of the A1 Bu Shadhaib is reported to have sueeeeded, on the ground of affinity by marriage, to a tribal Shaikhship left vacant by the extinction of the Al Salamah family of the Ma'adhld. All the sections and sub-sections of the Al Bin-'Ali are so much intermarried and such stress is at the same time laid on female descent that a majority of the tribe now describe themselves indifferently as belonging to one division or another, and that there is considerable doubt even among tribesmen as to which divisions include, and which are included in, others. The number of the Al Bin- J Ali, apart from the Ma'adhid families who disclaim connection with the tribe, is probably about 4,500 souls. These Ma'adhid families alone excepted, the Al Bin-'Ali fly on their boats a distinctive flag of 5 red and 5 white stripes alternating • it is called the Salaimi flag, and the bulk of the tribe for this reason are known also by the alternative name of Al Salaim jf. By profession the Al are pearl divers^ pearl merchants, cultivators of dates, and sailors voyaging to all parts of the Persian Gulf and even to places beyond ; none of the tribe are pastoral. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. The Al Bin-'AH are variously derived by different authorities from the 'Anizah, Qahtan and Bani Tamim, all Arab tribes of Najd ; the truth, perhaps, is that they are of mixed origin. The greater number of the Al Bin-'Ali of Bahrain arrived in 1783 with the 'Utub and have ever since been closely connected with that tribe, but in a subordinate capacity. A considerable number of them again emigrated to Qatar in 1894 to escape the tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain. There is at the present time a serious feud, arising out of bloodshed, between the Al Bin-'Ali and the 'Amamarah. 'ALI (BALAD. BANI BU) jo oJb yi The principal Ghaflri settlement in the Ja'alan district of the 'Oman Sultanate : it is situated about 40 miles south-south-west of Sur and 7 miles to the scuth-south-east of the rival Hinawi township of Balad Bani Bu Hasan. The houses number about 600, and the population which consists entirely of the Bani Bu 'Ali tribe may number about 3,000 souls. The settlement boasts about 3,000 camels, 800 donkeys and 4,000 sheep and goats, but only a few horses; the date palms are estimated at 30,000 f .'ALI (BANI BtJ) 65 Singular is J Alawi The principal Gliafri tribe of the Ja'alan 'ALI (BANI and Sharqiyah districts in the Sultanate of 'Or. ail. They are partly BU) nomadic and partly sedentary: the Bedouin portion of the tribe inhabit Ja'alan only and possess considerable herds of camels and goats, while the settled portion cultivate dates and grain in the Balad Bani Bu 'Ali oasis and are found also at Sur and at Kag-ar-Ruwais, Suwaih, Khov Bani Bu 'Ali, Jumailah and Lashkharah on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Oman where they are mostly mariners and fishermen. A few occur also at Khabbah in Wadi Kliabbah- Some authorities connect the Bani Bu 'Ali with the Al 'Ali of Trucial 'Oman and the Shibkuh district of Persia.

The total number of the tribe appears to be about 7^000 souls. The Bani Bu 'Ali became Wahhabis at the time of the Najdi invasions of 'Oman nearly a century ago; and as late as 1845 they were strict^ if not fanatical, in the observance of Wahhabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco ; but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer and are accounted the most religious tribe in the 'Oman Sultanate. They belong to a Wahhabi sect known as Azraqah The Bani Bu 'Ali are on the average men of middle size, with short features and quick deep-set eyes. A gloomy and determined expression which characterises some of them does not belie their natural character. They are a warlike, independent race and bear a high reputation for courage and dash. Their favourite weapon was originally a thin, straight, two-edged sword, sharp as a razor and attached by a leather thong to a shield 14 inches in diameter, in addition to which they carried match locks ; their armament is now of a more modern character, but they still have few breech-loaders. The Bani Bu ■'AH are the only tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate that have met a British force on land. On the 9th of November 1820, as related in the historical portion of this Gazetteer, they defeated a forc^'ALI-AL-GHARBI 67 of British Indian sepoys at their village of Balad Bani Bu 'Ali, and on the 2nd March 1821 suffered severe retribution near the same place. On the latter occasion the tribe lost heavily in billed and wounded, the town and fort were destroyed and a large number of prisoners were taken including the principal Shaikh, Muhammad-bin ^Ali; but the date groves belonging to the place were spared,—an act of clemency that was much appreciated and is still remembered. The prisoners after being kept for two years at Bombay were repatriated and received grants of money from the Indian Government to enable them to rebuild their houses and restore irrigation. Since this episode the tribe have uniformly shown themselves well-disposed to the British nation and have treated hospitably more than one British traveller visiting their country ; but they have never fully regained their position in tribal politics. The Bani Bu ^Ali have a chronic feud with their neighbours the Bani Bu Hasan ; their present Tamimah is ^Abdullah-bin-Salim of the Hamudah sub-section, who resides near Lashkharah but sometimes visits Sur, where he has a house. A small town in Turkish 'Iraq, on the right bank of the Tigris about half-way by river between 'Amarah and Kut. There are about 300 brick houses and a population of perhaps 3^000 souls. The inhabitants are of mixed origin, but almost entirely Shi'ahs by religion; they live by agriculture and petty trade. Wheat and barley grown in the surrounding country are exported; also ghi, wool, skins and other Kurdish products, for ^Ali-al-Gharbi is a dep6t of the Kurdistan trade, besides being a market town of the Bani Lam tribe. A small business in Manchester goods is carried on, chiefly by Jewish merchants who barter them for grain. 'Ali-al-Gharbi is the headquarters of a 'Nahiyah of the same name in the Qadha of 'Amarah and is consequently the seat of a Mudir: it has also a telegraph office, a customs house and two Khans. The town takes its name from a mosque dedicated, it is said, to 'Ali, a son of the Imam Musa whose tomb is at Kadhimain. The name of ^Ali-ash-Sharqi I ^ , a place pn the left or eastern bank of the Tigris about three-sevenths of the way from 'Ali-al-Gharbi to 'Amarah, has a similar derivation; it also is the headquarters of a Mudirate in the 'Amarall Qadha and exports some grain, but it is much smaller than 'Ali-al-G harbi, in fact there is only a shrine and a few tents. Ihere is a Government reserved forest at Ali-ash-Sharqi. f %68 'AMAMARAH 'AM AM A- Singular ^Ammari . A comparatively poor, seafaring tribe RAH Bahrain and Qatar, by some supposed to belong to the 'Ammar yoU-c division of the Dawasir of Najd. In Bahrain the ^Amamarah have 40 houses at Muharraq Town and 100 at Budaiya' ; in Qatar they have 20 at Dohah and 20 at Wakrah. Their total number may be about 900 souls. They are Maliki Sunnis by religion and live by pearl diving and by navigation in all parts of the Persian Gulf. They are closely connected with the A1 Bu Kuwarah and Ma'adhld and originally came to Bahrain from Qatar along with the 'Utub. At present they have feuds with the A1 Bin -'Ali and with the A1 Bahaih section of the A1 Morrah, A division of the Sanjaq of 'Amarah in the Wilayat of Basrah in Turkish 'Iraq. Position and boundaries, —The Qadha is situated on both banks of the Tigris chiefly above, but also for a short distance below, the town of 'AmSlrah : it is bounded on the north-west by the Qadhas of Kut-al- Amarah and Badrah, on the north-east by the Persian frontier, on the south-east by the Qadha of Shatrat-al-'Amarah, and on the south-west by that of Hal. Topography and inhabitants, —The town of ^Amarah and the villages of 'Ali-al-Gbarbi, Kurnait and Majar are the only considerable centres of population in the Qadha. Above, that is to the north-west of the town of Amarah, the people are mostly of the Bani Lam tribe, but those about Kumait are A1 Bu Daraj; below 'Amarah Town the principal tribe are the A1 Bu Muhammad. The chief physical features of the district are the river Tigris, which flows through it, and the JahSlah canal derived from the same. Population, —The total fixed population of the ^Amarah Qadha is estimated, inclusive of 'Amarah Town, at 41,000 souls. It is calculated that of these about 34,000 are Shi^ah Muhammadans, 4,500 Sunni Muhammadans, 1,000 Jews, 1,000 Sabians and 500 Christians: the classes other than Shi'ah Muhammadans are practically confined to the town of Amarah. 'AMARAH «jU.c QADHA'AMARAH TOWN 69 ^ Wk Be sources. —Above Amarah Town the principal crops are wheats barley and millet; below it rice and maize predominate. Sesame and Mash ^ are also grown ; and cotton ; linseed and opium have been cultivated with 1 Hl\ success. The district is important for its livestock^ especially horses and maj sheep, and for its pastoral products such as ghi, wool, skins and hides, livelj Among the more productive estates in the district are those of %■; Akhdhar l ^ Bahathah aj W ^ Jahalah (on the canal of the same w name), Misharrah and Shatt , all of which belong to the Dairat-as-Saniyah. Balail Administration. —''Amarah is tke headquarters Qadha of the Sanjaq of the same name. It consists—the Markaz Nahiyah of ^Amarah, which is administrated by the Mutasarrif of the Sanjaq personally, being excluded—of four rural Nahiyahs ; namely 'Ali-al- Gharbi ^Ali-ash-Sharqi ^ } Majar-al-Kabir juO] and Majar-as-Saghir Each of these is governed by a Mudir who has his seat at ml in the place from which his charge takes its name. This important and rising town of Turkish ^Iraq, not to be eon- 'AMARAH founded with Kut-al-Amarah is situated upon the left bank of the Tigris about 130 miles by water above Basrah and is distant TOWN some 30 miles from the Turco-Persian land frontier: it is the chef'lieu of the Sanjaq and Qadha similarly named in the Wilayat of Basrah, Rite and buildings, —^Amarah stands on a strip of land enclosed on the west by the Tigris and on the north and east by the JahSlah canal j while to the south of it, but at some distance, are the marshes of the Al Bu Muhammad tribe. To the east of the Jahglahare extensive swamps and waterways, by means of which some boat communication is maintained with the Hawizeh District and with Persian 'Arabistan as a whole. On the right bank of the Tigris opposite ^Amjlrah are flourishing plantations of dates, other fruit trees and poplars, amidst Which is the village or suburb of Daffas • so called from a shrine which it contains,—united to the town of 'Amarah by a boat bridge formerly of about 40 pontoons, but now (it is reported) reduced to about half that number by the employment of larger boats. 'Amarah has a river frontage of more than half a mile upon the Tigris; and a70 'AMARAH TOWN good embankment or wharf faced with brick, alongside of which steamers can lie^ runs the whole length of the town. The northern quarter is the older and extends the whole way from the Tigris to the Jahalah, which is spanned behind the town by a boat bridge of several pontoons. In the northern quarter is situated a fine building belonging to the Dairat-as-Saniyah; here also are the military barracks and, upon the quay, the principal government offices. The main street of the town traverses the northern quarter from the Tigris to the Jahcilah running at right angles to both streams : it contains the chief bazaar, of which the end next the Tigris was destroyed by fire in 1903 and has now been rebuilt in a more modern and commodious style. The southern quarter consists of a row of 27 new houses of uniform pattern and handsome appearance which face the river and form 6 large blocks : 15 of them were built as a speculation by the Dairat-as-Samyah and the remainder by local Shaikhs in emulation of the Departments example. There are at ; Amarah two public baths. Inhabitants. —The population of 'Amarah is estimated at 10,000 souls, of whom 4,500 may be Sunnis, 3^000 Shr'ahs, 1,000 Jews, 1,000 Sabians, and 500 Christians ; most of the Muhammadans with the exception of the Turkish officials are town Arabs, but there are also a good many Kurds and a few Persians. The country Arabs to the north of ; Amarah are Bani Lam, and to the south Al Bu Muhammad. The townspeople—apart from the officials^ some well-to-do Persian merchants and the representatives of Baghdad and Basrah firms—are mostly petty traders and artisans. Products&gt; manufactures and tfade. —The gardens of the town pro duce citrons, pomegranates, quinces, figs and grapes. Arab cloaks, Kurdish rtigs and silverware are among the manufactures of the place j the silverware is the work of the Sabians and one variety of it, inlaid with antimony, is unusual and not inelegant. Ghi, wool, hides and skins, various kinds of niits, also walnut and other woods are imported from the Kurdish hills, while wheat, barley, maize, rice and sesame are brought in from the surrounding country. The imports of ^Amarah from foreign countries are the same as those, of Turkish 'Iraq generally. Live cattle are exported by land in great numbers from ; Amarah to Syria. ■'Amarah supplies Baghdad and Basrah with ghi, rice and barley; a considerable quantity of the barley is shipped to Europe and the greater paifc of the ghi to Bombay and the(*Ty 'ANAFIJEH 71 Levant ports. ^Amarah wool, which is of excellent qnality, is for tne most part baled in a press belonging to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and goes chiefly to London and Marseilles. In matters of trade ^Amarah is dependent to a great extent upon Baghdad through which it receives nearly all its imports from abroad. Skins and bides are usually sent to Baghdad to be pressed for exportation : there are^ however ; two native hand-presses for hides. The currency of ^Amarah consists chiefly of nmniiij Persian silver Qrans. Shops are said to numbei 4 150. BO! Administrative and official matters. —^Amarah is a place of administra tive importance, being the headquarters of the Sanjaq of ^Amarah and the residence of the Mutasarrif: it has ordinarily a military garrison amotinting to one infantry battalion, one squadron of cavalry and three or four field guns, and it is the headquarters of the 3rd battalion of the 85th Kadif regiment. The Dairat-as-Samyah has a head office here \ ahd the Customs, Public Debt and Sanitary Departments and the Tobacco Regie are each represented by a Mamur, while a harbour master superintends shipping and river conservancy. There is a telegraph office linked with 'Ali-al-Gharbi on one side and Qal^at Salih on the other. The Persian Government are represented at ''Amarah by a Naib-Karpardaz or Consular Agent. The town is constituted as a municipality. General.^'km&amp;xvh did not exist at the time of Colonel Chesney^ survey in 1836 : it is said to have grown up since 1860 in consequence of the pacification and material development of the country around. It is believed to mark the site of a battle field on which a Turkish com mander broke the power of the local Arabs and afterwards encamped, and for this reason it is still sometimes called Ordu or The Camp. The present thriving condition of the town is largely due to the operations of the Dairat^as-Sanlyah, whose local manager at the present time (1905) is a man of progressive ideas. A Committee of Management, subordinate to the Central Committee at Baghdad, and the principal offices of the Dairat-as-Samyah in Turkish ; Iraq a,re now located here. There is a Government reserved forest near ^Amarah, Singular ^naifiji An Arab tribe, said to be related to the Al 'AllAFIJEJET Kathir, once powerful and of first-rate importance in Southern toiUr Arabistan, but now diminished in numbers to about 5,000 souls of whom72 'ANAFIJEH about 1 000 are settled and 4,000 are nomadic. The former boundary of the ^Anafi^eh ran along the right bank of the Shatait from its confluence with the Diz to a little above Chahardingeh; thence it crossed to Kut Bandar on the Diz and^ passing by Khairabad to the left bank of the Karkheh followed the Karkheh to a point some 10 miles above Kut Nahr JJashim : from this point it ran to Khar Ishtireh opposite Ahwaz village on the Karun river and then kept along the rig-ht bank of the Karun to the mouth of the Diz river. The Anafijeh now chiefly occur on the lower course of the Shatait, on the banks of the Diz within 20 miles of its mouthy and on the right bank of the Karun : a few are found however on both banks of the Gargar. The Anafljeh are mostly tent-dwellers and they own livestock in considerable numbers, but they depend chiefly for their livelihood on the cultivation of wheat, millet and barley. The tribe can still muster some 1,140 fighting men, of whom about 150 are mounted, and the majority are armed with rifles. Except the 'Abadat section the ^Anafijeh pay revenue direct to the Shaikh of Muhattimareh through their own Shaikh, at present Alwan. In bad years the Shaikh of Muhammareh remits his demands and even finances the tribe. The sections are :— Name. Location. Fighting strength.

The A1 Bu Haji section of the Hardan tribe pay their revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareh through the 'Anafijeh, among whom they reside. The principal toWn of Qasiw and in fact of all Najd ; it is 'ANAIZAH situated about 150 miles south-east by east of Hail, 300 miles north- west of Riyadh and 12 miles south of Buraidah. It is thus about half way between Basrah and Makkah, being distant about 400 miles from74 ^ANAIZAH either, and lies nearly in the straight line^ and not far from midway, between the capitals of Northern aud Southern Najd. 'With good reason it is regarded by its inhabitants as being the centre of the whole tw Arabian peninsula and is styled by them Umm Najd ^ or ee Mother of Central Arabia/' Site and buildings, —The site of ^Anaizah is a loamy hollow 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of Wadi-ar -Eummah, underlain by sandstone rock and. surrounded by sandy desert. To the south-east^ at no great distance ; are some very barren Mils covered with loose stones. The height of 'Anaizah above the sea is probably about 2,500 feet. The town is walled and stands in the middle of; an oasis which is also walled,, or formerly was so ; the space between the outer and the inner enceinte is filled with date groves^ gardens and cultivated fields. On the north of the town this cultivated belt has a depth of 1 to 2 miles, and the aspect which the place presents to a traveller approaching from this side is imposing in its extent as well as in its richness. Both walls are strengthened by towers set at intervals, and the agricultural resources and abundant supply of well-water which the oasis contains would render its reduction by blockade a difficult i£ not impossible task. Internally the town is divided into three principal wards, each of which has its own separate banner in time of war ; they are Kharaizah on the north and west, (M Hofuf on the south, and Umm Himar on the east* The houses, even the best, are clay-built, but pleasant and clean : a large proportion of them have upper storeys. Fovulation. —The inhabitants of ; Anaizah are mostly of the Bani Tamim tribe; but the town is said to have been founded by Sabai' from 'Aridh, to whom Bani Khalid refugees were added at a later date. There are also some 'Anizah. The total population is probably between 10,000 and 15,000 souls. The people have a free bearing and are well clad; they are industrious and not unintelligent, but their disposition has been somewhat soured by the Wahhabi form of religion, which is still in the ascendant, though not universal, among them. The poorer townsmen resemble Bedouins in garb, and wear the Kafiyah and ; Aqal of the desert; while the richer classes use the fez, over which a gay- coloured kerchief is loosely thrown. The well-to-do dress in light worsted ^Abas from Turkish ^Iraq, with sometimes an embroidered collar ; and persons of good birth, when walking in the street, carry in their hands long rods that are brought from Makkah.'ANAIZAH The women axe not visible in the day time^ but go out to visit at one another's houses between twilight and the last prayer. Friday is the market day, and the Friday prayers in the congregational mosque are attended by all and sundry residing in the oasis. More aged men are to be seen here than in north-western Arabia generally. The principal diseases are fever^ enlarged spleen, catarrh, and cataract. In 1880 the mosques of ^Anaizah numbered 15, including the Jami' in the public square; and there were four schools, of which one was for girls. The residents of the town have an agreeable custom of camping en familie in the surrounding desert for change of air. Agriculture. —^Anaizah, though it possesses a considerable trade, is largely dependent on its agriculture. On the town lands wheat is grown year after year in the same fields, and the crops are dense but light j fresh loam and the dung of the camels which work the water-lifts are the only manures in use. The fields are levelled, embanked, and irrigated from wells ; the date trees stand in channels which are flushed with water twice daily. The ordinary cereals, fruits and vegetables of Qasim are cultivated. Most of the small'owners are burdened with debt and cannot afford sufficiently to irrigate their ground. Animals are horses, camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, the horses are estimated at 60, the camels at 1,000, the donkeys at 800 and the horned cattle at 1,500, Internal trade and supplies, —Supplies of many kinds are abundant. In the main bazaar are sold piece-goods, clothing, drugs (including occasionally English medicines such as cod-liver oil), camel medicines, loaf sugar, spices, Syrian soap imported through Madinah, and Yaman coffee brought by caravans from Makkah. This principal bazaar is called Maskaf it contains about ] 20 shops, but only a small part of it is roofed over. Most of the imported commodities are deceived through Kuwait ; the remainder come through Hasa or, as already mentioned, from Makkah or MadTnahi In the outlying quarters of the town are small shops which deal in sundries, such as iron, nails, matches, salt, onions, eggs, girdle-bread and milk ; and on Fridays veiled 'Women sell chickens in the market-place and dispose of skins for holding milk or water which they have tanned and prepared with their own hands. Common food, Arabian coffee and clothing from the Persian Gulf side are cheap; aiid dates, sold by weight sometimes at 30 lbs. for a dollar, are excellent; but grain is dear. There is only one well of perfectly fresh water, and it is observed that the wells near the desert yield as a rule76 'ANAIZAH sweeter water than those lower down in the Qa/ or basin in which the town stands. Occupations and industries. —Numerous handicrafts and industries are exercised in ; Anaizah : there are goldsmiths, silversmiths, armourers and tinkers; turners of wooden bowls and makers of wooden locks, of camel-saddles and of wheels for wells ; stone-cutters, who seldom live more than three or four years at their trade on account of its unhealthiness ; sinkers and liners of wells, workers in marble and manufacturers of coffee* mortars ; house builders and plasterers; seamsters and seamstresses ; em broiderers and sandal makers. The goldsmiths and silversmiths of ^Anaizah are renowned for their filigree and thread work, and same who have settled at Makkah are said to surpass all their competitors there* External trade, —Trade on the large scale is represented by about 1 5 merchants of substance, some of whom have representatives at Basrah and Jiddah; the capital of the wealthiest among them may be worth £24,000. Among the leading merchants are a family named Bassam who are said to be of Washam origin. There is no horse-breeding at 'Anaizah itself, but horses are purchased from the Bedouins in winter and brought into condition for export to India. Ghi also is collected from the Bedouins in spring by ^Anaizah merchants and stored in marble troughs till summer or autumn, when it is sent by caravan to Makkah; one such caravan may carry as much as 30 tons of ghi worth £2,000, Political position and The history of ^Anaizah is that of Qasim, in which it has ever occupied the leading position. Before the capture of the place by the Amir of Jabal Shammar in 1891, 'Anaizah was ruled by its own Amirs ; they possessed arbitrary powers, but wielded them in a constitutional manner, deferring to some extent to their Majlis or council. Capital punishment was then but rarely inflicted. Common offences and theft were visited with a beating; cutting off of the hand for theft, according to Muhammadan law, was not in vogue. Hardened felons were expelled from the township. In case of a military expedition the lists for service were made up by the Amir, only the better-off classes being required to serve; those who were called out were obliged to send a camel and back-rider each, the front place on the animal being filled either by the sender or, if he preferred it, by an efficient substitute. The poorer classes remained at home for the defence of the (town, and on such occasions it was customary to discontinue the morning market, to prohibit the killing'ANDAM CWADI) 77 s ; armi ^sofei J le til of butcheiV-meat; and to close by order all places of business except small general shops. A typical expedition sent out by the town in 1878 against Bedouins consisted of 400 men with 20 mares and 200 camels. It is probable that, after the liberation of Qasim from the yoke of Jabal Shammar in 1902, the old order of things was in most respects re -established under the present Amir, 'Abdul 'Aziz-bin-'Abdullah-bin- Yahya; nor does it appear that ifc has been seriously modified since the nominal Turkish occupation of Qasim in 1905. The sole sign of Turkish influence in 1906 was a Nuqtah or military post garrisoned by a detach^ ment of less than 100 Turkish soldiers under a Yuzbashi; this detach ment occupied a house belonging to the Amir of 'Anaizah in the Umm Himar quarter, it seemed to have no police or other duties in the town, and according to the accounts received its presence was virtually ignored by the Arabs. The Amir held the honorary rank of Mudfr, but he drew no salary and maintained no relations with the Turks. He wjas understood to profess allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud alone and to pay him occasional tribute. .eeifeii ]j i ) i . it A valley of considerable importance in the Sultanate of 'Oman: it 'ANDAM begins in the Eastern Hajar, in a part of the hills called Jabal'Ulya Ulc } and runs southwards across the western end of the Sharqiyah C Sf ; district to Wadi Halfain, which it joins.

Wadi ^Andam forms, from Khadra Bin-Daffa/ downwards, the bound* ary between the districts of 'Oman Proper on the west and Sharqiyah on the east. The affluent called Wadi Qant 9 which comes in at Majazah, has its head at Saddi in 'Oman Proper and forms the boundary, from that place to Khadhra Bin-DafEa/, between 'Oman Proper and Sharqiyah. It apparently contains three or four of the villages described in the article on 'Oman Proper. A small district on the mainland of Persia immediately to the ANGALI north-east of Bushehr Town; it is enclosed between the Rud-hilleh. River on the north, the Rud-hilleh District on the west, the Bushehr harbour on the south and the Dashtistan District on the east, and is in the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Angali is said to have been at one time a part of the Dashtistan District and to have been detached from it for administrative reasons. Extent and 'physical characteristics.— length of Angali is about 15 miles from north to south, but its breadth is only 5 to 10 miles. The whole is a plain ; and the portion about Shif, Hasan Nadu and the two Nukals (mentioned below) is a barren waste. The climate in winter is cold, and in summer from June to August a very hot wind blows in the middle of the day. Fojoidation. —The people numbering only some 2,700 souls are a ^mixed race, the blood of Behbehani Lurs probably predominating; there is a small Arab infusion. The men of Angali are described as brave and hard-working. They wear the ordinary Persian knife and are well-armed with Martini rifles, nearly 400 of which are owned in the district. All the people follow agricultural pursui s and their dwellings are mostly built of sun-dried bricks and mud^ but some are huts of wood and matting. They are Shfahs by religion,80 ANGALI Agriculture, transport and Wheat and barley are ; with the exception of a few dates and melons, the only crops. It is calculated that the district possesses about 100 horses, 500 donkeys and 2,000 sheep and goats. Communication with Bushehr Town is by boat from Shif. The Hashim Man of Angali, consisting of 16 ordinary local Mans of 8 lbs. 4 oz. each, is equal to 132 lbs. English. Trade is small and of a commonplace character. Building materials, chiefly Zanzibar timber and Muhammarell matting, are imported through Bushehr Town. Administration* — The villages of Angali are ruled by a hereditary Khan, at present Ahmad Khan, who is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports : his family are said to have been originally Nui Lurs who immigrated from Behbehan 60 or 70 years ago, but they have absorbed some Arab blood. The administration is of the same type as in the neighbouring districts ruled by Khans. The only tax is one of 65 Qrans per Grau of cultivation, the Gau being here a plot measuring 250 by 250 yards and requiring 6 Hashim maunds of seed to sow it. The annual sum at present payable to the Persian Government as revenue is 1,500 Tumans exclusive of the farm of the tolls at Shif. Topography. —The villages of the district are :— Name.

Distribution. —Their original seat is believed to have been a little co the north of Madmah on the water-shed between the Red Sea and the basin of Wadi-ar -Rumiuah^ but the Dirah of their Bedouins now extends from Qasim and Madmah on the south to the Hauran in Syria on the norths while on the east it reaches to the main route between Hail and Najaf and, further north, to the Euphrates valley. Some of the Bedouin 'Anizah occupy the neighbourhood of Musaiyib in Turkish Iraq for about two months in the year, and make their annual purchases of food and clothing there and at Tawairij. The greater part of the Syrian desert belongs to the ^Anizah, and they come in contact with the Persian Gulf basin chiefly to the west of the Euphrates between Karbala and Najaf and further south on the borders of Jabal Shammar, where they camp in Hajarah and dispute the possession of Batn with the Shammar tribe. They frequent Wadyan and the Nafud ; in the latter Jubbah is one of their chief centres. The Bedouins around Taimah are 'Anizah, and numbers of the tribe collect during the date harvest at Khaibar, which formerly belonged to them and where they still own plantations. Besides these Bedouins a very considerable proportion of the sedentary population in the districts of Southern Najd and in Qasim appear to be of 'Anizah blood. Divisions and numbers of the Bedouin 'Anizah*—The internal organisation of the ^Anizah tribe is a subject of great difficulty, and comparison of the various authorities who have written on the subject yields no clear or consistent result. According to information collected recently at Kuwait^ the more southern 'Anizah fall into two main divisions, the 'Amarat and the Bishr .* The Amarat are sub-divided into Dahamishah and Hilban , and these again into the sections and sub-sections below: — Dahdmtshah sub-division of the 7 Amarat, I 'Adalat 'Ayash r Dhuwaidah s Sumair Suwalira Jt r'r Tawatihah Khamis Mahuwwis Marwan Mirabidah Qahus y Shtaiwi m S Jj'O dnp« D ° ugllt y ll0wever (!• 331) treats the 'Amarat as a sub-division of the Bishr and important 11 ^ ^ Daliamisllah an ' i Hilban whom our Kuwait authority treats as 'ANIZAH dJ.X£ g 2'ANIZAH 85 end of the Nafud.

In person the Bishr are robust and resemble the Bedouins of the north ; for dress they wear clothes imported from Turkish 'Iraq and sometimes don as head-gear a worsted band wound fold upon fold like a turban. The Saba'ah sub-division of the Bishr are said to be found chiefly in the direction of Najaf and Karbala; on the average they are short of stature but carry long spears. Batn is on the border between them and the Shammar. The Wald Sulaiman * sub-division of the Bishr is said by some to include, as well as the sections given above, the Bajaidah aojLd* , a portion of the ^Anizah tribe of whom a good deal is heard. It seems certain that the Fuqarah section of the Wald Sulaiman together with a number of rather strong sections collectively known as the Wald ^Ali t ^ compose a group known as the Bani Wahab { ^ whether this group includes other sections of the Waid Sulaiman besides the Fuqarah cannot, on present data, be determined. The ^Awajiyah section of the Wald Sulaiman are described as inhospitable and violent in their dealings ; they are found between the Nafud and Qasim. The Fuqarah § section of the Wald Sulaiman, in number about 800 souls, inhabit the country between Taimah and Khaibar and extend to the west of the pilgrim-route from Syria to Madmah. They live generally in the Bedouin manner, but their Shaikhs have houses at Khaibar, where the tribesmen sell querns of their own manufacture at the autumn fair. In religion the Fuqarah are somewhat fanatical; yet they eat the hedgehog and the fox, and their women go unveiled. In 1878 they were subject to Ibn Bashid, to whom they paid tribute of $400 a year at the rate of one dollar per 5 camels or 30 head of cattle. They were then on bad terms with the Muwahib another section of the ''Anizah who are variously described as belonging to the Hilban and to the Saba/ah. * It may be noted here that there is little or no agreement between Guarmani's divi sion of the Wald Sulaiman and that furnished by our authority. 4. Regarding the Wald 'AH there is considerable agreement between Doughty and Huber. The largest section of the Wald 'Ali appears to be the Tuwalah and the most aristocratic the Alaidah. X By some accounts the Bani Wahab include also all the Bishr, Ruwalah and Qalas : see Doughty, I. 229. § Doughty divides the Fuqarah into 8 sub-sections, Huber into 9 : only 3 names in the two lists appear to correspond—an apt illustration of the difficulty of tribal questions in Arabia. It is not clear that our Kuwait authority, in classing the Pnqarahas Bishr, has Doughty's support.86 'ANIZAH The ^Amarat and the Bishr, except the Saba^ah, mainly belong to the south : the best known ^Anizah of the north are the Ruwalah , the Qalas or Jalas and the Shavian . A close connection exists between these three^ but it has not been satisfactorily explained. The Ruwalah are certainly a large body; their range is from the Nafud northwards to the Syrian Hauran and from Wadi Sirhan on the west to the Hail-Najaf route on the east. The Euwalah^ it is said ; can ordinarily be distinguished from their southern neighbours the Shammar by their smaller horses and shorter spears. Portions of the ^Anizah tribe who cannot^ on the information available^ be correlated with any of the foregoing are the— 'Aj ail Makasira^ Alftidah * »A)D| M asa'ib ^LA/© Daghaiyim (Al) ■0 _ ^ Jl Matutah diojia/e Dahman Muwaijah Dhayan (Bani) Nuri Dilimah Rus Wl) Hasani Shiblan t or Shimlan Idhn Shumailah Jala id Taiyar juk Probably a number of these are fractions of the larger and smaller units already enumerated.

The features of • Possibly a section of the Wald 'AH group. See second footnote, page 85. t The Shiblan are said to include the Naif who appear to be identical with a clan mentioned by Wallin as belonging to the north. On the other hand, Guarmani appears to include the Shimlan with the Wald Suiaiman of the south-west. This estimate is partially based on Kuwait reports of the fighting strength of the southern Anizah, which, though containing useful indications, were not sufficiently reliable to be included in the article. Doughty placed the total of the tribe at 25,000 souls only ; the present Shaikh of Kuwait on the other hand would raise the 'Anizah to a frankly impossible figure.(?. 'ANIZAH 87 the northern 'Anizah are often of a Syrian or even Jewish caste. Some 'Anizah families^ for the sake of a more comfortable life^ live among the Hataim; but they do not intermarry with them. The tents of the 'Anizah are high compared with others., and the apartment of the wife is upon the left in entering. Political sympathies.—'In the recent struggle in Central Arabia the Bedouins, at least, of the ^Anizah took part with Ibn Sa^ud and the Shaikh of Kuwait against Ibn Rashid. Settled 'Aniza/i. —The foregoing remarks relate to the Bedouin ^Anizah • but, as already observed, a large part of the settled population of Najd claim to be_, and many of them probably are^ of the 'Anizah. In Jabal Shammar they are not mentioned except at Jauf-al-'Amir and Ghazalah; but in Qasim settled Arabs who call themselves ; Anizah are apparently found at 'Anaizah, Buraidah, nhalfia/ah, Dharas, ^Ain-ibn- Fahaid, Ghaf I, Khabrah, Khadhar, Qusaibah, Muraid Saiyid, Rass, Raudhat-ar-Rubai^ Saib ; Shaihiyah, Shiqqah^ Ta'amiyah, Watat and Wathal ; and possibly at Khabb^ Mudhnib and Qisaiya^ah. In Sadair they are said to occur at Dakhilah^ Dhalmah, Harmah, Ijwai, Janubi- yah, Khis ; Majina', Ruwaidhah, Tuwaim and Zilfi; in 'Aridh at Barrah, Haraimlah and Malham in Mahmal, at Batin-ash-Shuyukh, Manfuhah and Eiyadh on Wadi Hanifah, and at Dhrumah town ; Mizahmiyah and Rodhah in the Dhrumah tract. In Hariq their presence is report ed at Hariq town and Mufaijir, and in Ha Utah at Hautah town and Hilwah. In Aflaj they are found at Raudhah and in Wadi Sabai' at Khurmah and Raudhah. They also occur in Kharj. The sections to which the settled ^Anizah belong have not been investigated in many cases ; but the following are mentioned :— Hawaishan in Zilfi. 'Askar in Kharj, and at Dhalmah and Majma' in Sadair. Daud ; at Hautah town in Hautah. Harqan j at Malham in 'Aridh. Hawaidi at Maima' in Sadair. Hazazinah : at Kariq town and Mufaijir in Hariq.

Among the settled ^Anizah mention must also be made of the Misalikh . According to some authorities these are a branch of the Wald 'Ali; and the Al Maqran jl , the family of the rulers of Southern Najd, together with the family of the Shaikhs of Buraidah in Qasim^ are said to be sprung from them.* ^AQALt A small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side; it is bounded by Khor-al -'Odaid on the north-west and by Doliai-an-Nakhalah on the south-east^ the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on the average about 20 miles. On the landward side ''Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, by the Jafurah desert on the south and south- west, and by Qatar on the north-west. The coast of ^Aqal is embayed by a great opening, Khor-adh- Dhuwai- t* 11 5 which is 20 miles deep and, being about 16 miles wide at its entrance, occupies nearly a half of the whole sea frontage of ''Aqal; this inlet is rather nearer to the Khor-al ^Odaid end of the district than to the other. The depth of the bay varies over the greater part of its extent from 4 to 10 fathoms, but in different parts of it there are shoals. The soil of 'Aqal in the proximity of the sea is fairly firm, and the land rises in steps to a height of several feet; behind the ridges thus formed, which are of a reddish colour, lies a tract of heavy dark sand with hillocks of light-coloured sand occurring at intervals.

A remarkable amphitheatre or bay in the eastern slopes of Jabal Aja in Northern Najd; it is formed by the junction of several small valleys within the mountains. The elevation of its floor is 4^020 feet above the sea or about 500 feet above Hail 3 but the climate is exceedingly hot in summer. The hills which surround ^Aqdah are inaccessible from the outside^ and the only entrance to the place is by a narrow gorge, called Ri^-al-^Aqdah ^ ; 6 miles west-south-west of Hail^ which is 100 yards wide at the mouth but contracts, further in, to 50 or less. At the narrowest part it is barred by a dry-stone wall, about 10 feet high and 8 feet thick ; in which at the southern end is a gateway with a heavy iron gate, broad enough for 4 camels to pass through abreast# The approach is capable of defence by a small number of riflemen posted behind the wall and upon the hill on its flanks. The various interior valleys of ^Aqdah are overhung by naked granite crags, and their floors are of granite covered with 12 to 15 feet of a gravel which contains much moisture and supports plantations of date trees aggregating about 75,000 palms. The various groves are walled, and each contains a 'AQDAH90 'AQDAH hamlet named after the clan o£ the Shammar tribe whicli inhabits it; they are :— ''Abaid ^Abdullah , Aqni , ; Ali , 'Ata llxe ; Fadhil , Dhiyab &gt; Hamil ; Jabar , Jinidah , Mufadhdhal Rakhis &gt; Salit iaAlv. ^ Shirah ? Shumailah and Zuwaimil . The total number of houses, which are of sun-dried brick, is about 460; and the largest villages are ^Abdullah and Mufadhdhal with 40 houses each, 'Abaid with 35, and Shumailah with 30.* The fixed population is estimated at 1,500 souls and this is increased by 500 during the date season when Bedouins who own some of the date groves are encamped in them. About | the palms belong to the permanent inhabitants, J to Bedouins of the Shammar tribe and i to the Amir of Jabal Shammar; the plantations belonging to the Amir and his relations are situated in the middle of the valley where the subsoil contains most water. Besides dates, limited quantities of maize^ millet and fruit are grown. 'Aqdah is regarded by the A1 Rashid as their ancestral stronghold, and various members of the family own forts in it large enough to accommodate their households in time of danger. In spite of the abundance of its dates Aqdah, it is believed^ could not on account of the paucity of its other resources stand a siege of more than 3 months*t The correct spelling of this name is uncertain; it is frequently pro nounced as if written , or 'Aqili is a rich district, mostly plain, situated on the left bank^of the Karun river between its exit from the hills at Tang-i-Qareh-i-Dukhtaran and the town of Shushtar ; a part of it is enclosed on the west by the loop which the Karun forms near the villages of Gotwand and Jallakan in the SMshtar District. The riverain lands of 'Aqili are probably the most valuable unon the Karun; they bear luxuriant crops of wheat, barley, tobacco and cotton, and the whole surface is cultivated. Cattle and sheep are fairly numerous, and there are some buffaloes and a few horses and donkeys.

'Aqili, as tv ill be apparent from the table that precedes^ is virtually a private estate of the Bakhtiyari Khans, but it is attached to the Shushtar District ; the revenue payable by the Bakhtiyari Khans to the Persian Government is 12 ,160 Tumansin cash, 300 Kharvarsof grain and 280 Kharvars of straw. At the beginning of 1907 a contest was in progress between the Khans and the Persian Governor of Northern 'Arabistan for the direct administration of the district. The population of 'Aqili is apparently about 15,000 souls.* This name appears to denote not one valley in the Eastern Hajar 1AQQ district of the 'Oman Sultanate but two, of which the eastern enters (WADI-AL-) Wadi Samail 1 mile and the other miles above Sarur, both on the right bank; the second is the true Wadi-al-'Aqq. In the last 4 or 6 miles of their course the two valleys run parallel and close together. The eastern valley contains the villages of Lizugh and Mizra' Bu Ba'arah ^fjy; Lizugh is 1J miles up the valley on the right bank and consists of 100 houses of NidablyiH, while Mizra' Bu Ba'arah, also on the right bank, is 8 miles above Lizugh and comprises 80 houses of Nidabiyin. At each of these villages the usual livestock are found and about 1,000 date palms. The villages of the western valley are three : Fankh , on the right bank, 4 miles from Wadi Samail, 50 houses of Nidablyin; Da'asar or 'Aqq, on the left bank 5 miles from Wadi Samail, 50 houses of Nidabiyin; and Sinsilah iU-i— , 5 miles further up, 40 houses of Nidabiyin. These villages also have the usual complement of livestock and from 500 to 700 date palms each. (Jf*■' ^ i I • * According to the recent report already cited in a footnote (page 91), lation is much smaller than this, perhaps only half or even less. the popn-'AQQ (WADI-AL-0 The total population of Wadi-al-^Aqq is about 1^500 souls. Wadi Saijani joius Wadi-al-^Aqq at Fankli, apparently from the western side. A pass at the head of Wadi-al-^Aqq, 3 miles south of Sinsilahj leads into Sharqiyah and is one of the best routes thither: the topography of this part is not well understood^ but the route after crossing the watershed falls into Wadi Samad. The command of Wadi-al-'*Aqq is of high importance to the Sultan of 'Oman as it is one of the principal routes by which Sharqiyah insur- gents have been accustomed to enter Wadi Samail and advance against his capital. The Sultan has no post in the valley and controls it^ so far as he is able, by keeping the Nidabiyin tribe upon his side. The largest, or, if small native'sailing vessels be excluded from consider ation, the only navigable river that enters the Persian Gulf; it carries the whole drainage' of Turkish Iraq and a large part of that of Persian 'Arabistan as well. Course and general characteristics. —The Shatt-al-^Arab is formed by the confluence at Qurnah Village of the Tigris and the Euphrates; in winter the swift brown Tigris and the feeble transparent Euphrates, the latter strained of its sediment in a journey of many days through marshes, present a remarkable contrast at their Junction. At about 40 miles below Qurnah village the Shatt-al- ; Arab leaves the celebrated city of Basrah upon its right bank; 22 miles further on it passes the smaller and less ancient but important town of Muhammareh, situated at a short distance from its left bank within the embouchure of the Karun * immediately below Fao, at a distance of about 50 miles from Muhammareh and 112 miles from Qurnah, it ends in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The average direction of the river is to the south-east, but in the reach between Basrah and Muhammarch it has a more easterly and a less southerly inclination. The width of the Shatt-aVArab at Basrah as measured in 1905 is 600 yards, and from Basrah to Muhammareh its mean breadth is probably about the same; but after receiving the Karun at Muham mareh it expands at once to half a mile, and its dimensions thereafter gradually increase to a maximum of about one mile in the neighbourhood of its mouth. 'ARAB (SHATT- AL-)'ARAB (SHATT-AL.) 95 The sea tides affect the level of the Shatt-al-'Arab throughout its entire lengthy raising and lowering it by 6 to 9 feet in the neighbourhood of Basrah and by about 4 feet at Qurnah Village; and they are stronger than the current of the river. Sea water, however^ does not reach further than about 20 miles above Fao. The temperature of the Shatt-'al- 'Arab stream is sometimes as much as J 6° Fahrenheit higher than that of the Karun which enters it near MuhammareL Tributaries. —Tributaries of the Shatt-al-^Arab deserving of mention u&gt; are two only,—the Suwaib or Shwaiyib and the Karun : of these the latter is by far the more important. The Suwaib, which enters the Shatt-al-'Arab from its left bank about 4 miles below Qurnah Village, comes from the direction of Hawizeh and consists of the mingled waters, so far as not expended in irrigation, of the Karkheh river from 'Arabistan and of the Jahalah canal which taps the Tigris at 'Amarah. The Karun, the only really navigable river in all Persia, joins the Shatt-al-'Arab, also from the left bank, at a point about 22 miles by the course of the stream below Basrah. The Karun is described in a separate article. Here may be mentioned—though it is not exactly a tributary—the creek or backwater, known as Gurmat 'Ali ^.JU , which cuts the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab at a point about 8 miles above Basrah. Town and is said to communicate through marshes u ith the right bank of the Euphrates near Hammar. It is also stated that water which leaves the Euphrates near KhamisTyah below Suq-ash- Shuyukh reaches the Shatt-al-'Arab by a creek immediately above Kut- al -Farangi. Islands. —Above Basrah the river; now contains no islands worthy of note; between Basrah and Muhammareh on the contrary the islands of Ajairawiyah, Tawailah, Shamshaniiyah and Umm-al -Khasasif, which are separately described under their own names, form a continuous chain reaching nearly the whole way; and below Muhammareh also there are several islands, namely Bahriyah, Gat'ah, Haji Salbuq or Muhilleh, Ziyadiyah and Dawasir; these form the subject of separate articles. Comparison of the most recent charts with those of Colonel Chesney's expedition shows that the islands of the Shatt-al- Arab are somewhat unstable, or, in other words, that the main channel of the river is not constant.96 'ARAB (SHATT-AL-) In 1836 ^Ajairawiyah included part of the present Tawailah ; the rest of Tawailah had not then been formed; Shamshamiyall did not exist; Umm-al -Khasasif was smaller than at present and belonged to the left instead of to the right bank; Haji Salbuq on the contrary belonged to the Turkish and not to the Persian side; and Ziyadiyah. was still a part of the mainland. Navigation. —The Shatt-al-^Arab is in most respects a fine example of a navigable river. It forms as it were a spacious vestibule to Turkish 'Iraq while the Tigris and Euphrates resemble long but narrow corridors in the interior. An impressive though common spectacle on the Shatt-aVArab is that of a tall ocean steamer ascending or descending the river with swiftness and confidence. The great blemish of the river as a waterway is the undredged and unlighted bar, ] 2 miles in breadth, which obstructs the entrance. The passage over the bar is marked by a line of 5 buoys belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company of which the positions are occasionally changed; at the present time the buoys* extend from about 6 to about 15 miles from Fao, the innermost or Bar Buoy alone being situated within territorial waters at a distance approximately of 1-7 (nautical) miles from the Persian and 2*8 (nautical) miles from the Turkish shore. Steamers can cross the bar daily with a draft of 18, and at spring tides (or once a fortnight) with draft of 21 feet; but in both cases the combination of daylight and high tide must be awaited, a necessity which is liable to cause a delay of as much as 14 hours. Moreover, the soundings on the bar do not depend on the tide alone but are liable to be considerably reduced by a wind from the north, and the position and depth of the channel are variable. The bar itself consists of soft mud, stifller on the Persian than on the Arab side: a powerful steamer may sometimes plough through even when the water is less than her draught, but she will list to one side when inequalities of bottom are encountered and will not steer; in this way a turbine steamer of the British India Company has been known to force her way out on an actual draft of 16 feet when there were only 13 feet of water on the bar. Any vessel which can pass the bar can also ascend to Basrah without diffi culty, the intermediate soundings being commonly 24 feet or more and the worst places not difficult: it is believed that such vessels might even reach Qumah Village without let or hindrance. In 1047 A. D., the * Detailed information in regard to these buoys will be found in the Political Proceedings of the Government of India for December 1905.'ARAB (SHATT-AL-) 97 entrance of the SHatt-al-^Arab was marked by a teak-wood beacon on the east bank^ 120 feet high ; on a stone platform at the top of which a fire was kindled at night. In the autumn of 1841^ when the water was at its lowest, a small steamer ascended the Suwaib tributary of the Shatt-al-^Arab to a dis^ tance of 10 miles. Irrigation and cultivation. —The value of the Shatt-al-^Arab as a natural irrigation canal and as the fertiliser of a date-growing region, probably the most prolific and extensive in the world, is not inferior to that which it possesses as a highway of travel and commerce. Below Muhammarell the river is rich in silt, contributed chiefly by the Karun j and the fertility of even the higher reaches is considered by an expert authority (Sir W. Willcocks) to depend largely on mud from the Ka^un carried upstream by the action of the tides. Everywhere the banks of the Shatt-al-^Arab are extremely low, and in places the water must—as in Holland—be kept out at high tide by means of dykes. The watering of the plantations is a simple operation • it depends solely on the existence of creeks and distributaries up which twice a day the tide forces the fresh river water, generally making it rise to within 2 feet or less of the general ground level. Between Basrah, and Muhammareh. the date groves are practically continuous on both sides of the river and have a depth inland of half a mile to 2 miles; the number of trees upon this reach in Turkish territory alone is estimated at over 1,900,000, including those on the islands. On both banks above Basrah, and on the right bank below Muhammareh. there is generally a fine palm belt, but it is not so dense or unbroken, as between Basrah and Mnhammareh. The number of trees on the right bank and its islands below Muharamarell appears to be about 250,000. Political importance.' —The Shatt-al-^Arab in the lower half of its course is an important political boundary, dividing Turkish Arabia from ^tbe Persian province of ^Arabistan.

The singular form of the word, which is ^Arabi , is avoided as it is ambiguous, meaning also a hill-donkey. The Bani ^Arabah are a Ghafiri tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, found chiefly in Wadi Tayin, where their principal places are Sibal, Qurr, Hammam and Shat. Twenty years ago they are said to have been a large tribe; but they are now much less numerous in consequence, chiefly, of the ravages of cholera, and probably do not exceed 1,000 persons. They have been on bad terms with the Siyabiyin for more than 30 years, but the feud is now less aeute than formerly. 'ARABAH (BANI) An island, only 3 feet above sea level, situated about 60 miles east- north-east of Musallaimyah bay and 15 miles south of Farsi island. It consists of a sandbank with a rocky foundation and is visited by fishermen to catch turtle. It swarms with cormorants, being- covered in the season with their nests and young ones and there is a deposit of guano, a few inches thick, all over it. The question of the owner ship of 'Arabi has never arisen, and there is apparently no reason for legarding it as the property of one territorial power rather than of another.

'Arabistan falls .^y'^standing the existence of a large number of previous works on tliia ce, e poitions of the Gazetteer relating to 'Arabistan have involved more CT '''ligations than almost any other. A beginning was made in November inf n ^ 6 ,Slrae ' in I 1116 f0rln of 27 P r!llted foo'scap pages, of an abstract of the rroa ion at that time available: this collation of materials was supplied to the I 2 'ARAB ISTAN *116 'ABABISTAN naturally^ in its tribal and narrower administrative aspect, into two parts or sub-provinces wbich may be styled Northern 'Arabistan and South ern 'Arabistan respectively ; and each of these, in so far as it differs from the other, is described in the article bearing its name in this Gazetteer. Questions of boundaries, physical geography, climate, and internal government,—and to some extent that of inhabitants, having been disposed of elsewhere, the subjects of the present article will be flora and fauna ; agriculture and livestock ; external and internal trade • currency, weights and measures; communications of all kinds; administra tion in the wider sense ^ foreign relations and interests : these are all subjects which are common to the province as a whole. But first of all we may consider, in a more general and comprehensive way than was possible in the articles on the two sub-provinces, the matter of population and tribes. local officers and was used by them, and by the writer while on tour at Mubammareli, as a basis for fresh inquiries. During the earlier part of 1905, a large quantity of new information was supplied by Mr. W. McDouall, Consul at Muhammareh, in regard to the Muhammareh and Faliahiyeh Districts, and by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, Vice-Consul in 'Arabistan, in regard to the remainder of the province ; a number of reports were furnished also by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Political Assistant. The materia) obtained appeared in September 1905 as 156 printed octavo pages, and, having been sent in this shape to Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Mr. McDouall and to Captain Lorimer, was very greatly amplified and improved by the further efforts of those officers and of Major Morton, R.E., then on special duty for irrigation matters in ' Arabisfctan. A number of journeys were made by Captain Lorimer in connection with this work, and in the autumn of 1905 the districts of Hindiyan and Fallahiyeh and the Bahmanshir were explored by Major Cox and Lieutenant 0. H. Gabriel, LA., a number of doubtful points being thus settled. The observations of Major Cox on land were supplemented by those of Commander C. G. Sinclair, R.I.M., along the coast, which were made at the same time. The result of the further investigations, which continued during 1906, was that most of the articles on the province had to be re-written, and when they were reprinted at the beginning of 1907 they had expanded to nearly 300 octavo pages. Most of the new articles underwent further revision during 1907, and in some instances were extensively added to and corrected. A second journey to Khor Musa and Qubban, visited by him in 1905, was made by Major Cox, accompanied by Captain Birdwood, Assistant Resident, in 1907 ; and the Karun in the Mubammareh District and the Bahmanshir were examined bv Mr. J. IL Bill, Assistant Resident, with a view to solving certain difficulties. Information on particular points was supplied also by Ahmad Khan, Naib Tahsildar, Captain Lorimer's assistant at Nasiri. The articles in their present shape represent a very large amount of work, especially on the part of Captain Lorimer.

The writings of Ainsworth, Rawlinson, Layard, Loftus, Houtum Schindler and De Morgan, above, have special reference in part to antiquities and ancient geographv; and these subjects are expressly treated of in Vincent's Voyage of Nearchns, 1797; m Loftus* Determination of the River Eulaeus, 1857, and in Mr. Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Cali^phate^ 1905. Pull information in regard to trade is afforded by the annual Consular Eeports on the trade of 'Arabistan; and the special reports of Messrs. Maclean and Neiycomen, cited in a footnote to the article Persian Coast, may be consulted. The best general map of the province on a small scale is that issued with the present Gazetteer, which takes the place of Parts of Arabia and Persia, 1883. The country is shown on a large scale in sheets Nos. 71 S. W. and 72 N. W. and S. W. of the South-Western Asia series of the Survey of India, but the present edition of these is now out of date. Useful surveys or maps relating to portions of the province are : Map of the Turco-Persian brontier, made by Russian and English Officers (Sheet VIII), 1849—55 ; Captain Well's Sketch of the Karun River at Ahwaz, 1881 (Map No. 1378 in the Foreign Department Library, Simla); Lord Curzon's map of the Karun River and Branches in the Proceedings of the R.

This table shows the total number of the nomadic inhabitants of 'Arabistan to be about 119,680 souls, and, as the settled population have already been estimated at 229,000, it would seem that the total number of persons resident in the province must be about 348,680. The manner in which these numbers are distributed between Northern and Southern 'Arabistan and among the districts of the same is explained in the articles on the two sub-provinces. The great bulk of the nomads inhabit the Southern 'Arabistan districts of Ahwaz and Hawizeh. In the above figures no account is taken of Baklltiyaris and Lurs, who only enter the districts as winter visitors: the most important of these numerically are probably the Sagwand Luis, who encamp annually in the Dizful District, sometimes to the number of 15,000 souls. Wandering Turkish tribes who, under Bakhtiyari protection, enter the north-western corner of the province have likewise been neglected. Similarly a large number of the 'Idan tribe who have recently immi grated from the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab into the Muhammareh District have been omitted from the calculations, their sojourn being possibly temporary. Fer contra it is probable that a proportion of the nomads of the Hawizeh District, who have been treated as permanently domiciled there, belong as much to Turkish 'Iraq as to Persian 'Arab- istan. It is needless to remark that the estimates of numbers are in a high degree conjectural. To speak generally, the tribal system of ■'Arabistan does not,—like that of the North-Western Frontier of India for instance,—rest upon a rigid basis of race; nor is the tribal or sectional position of the individual determined immutably by his descent upon the male side. On the contrary tribesmen can, in 'Arabistan, be made as well as born; and the strength of the tribe or section is liable to be increased by addition to its numbers from without or diminished by desertion from within. W hole tribes are sometimes merged and disappear, or are distributed as sections among two'ARABISTAN 125 or more other tribes; while at the same time the process of disintegration is actively bringing fresh tribes^ or at least sections, into existence. ^ New sections generally take the names of the Shaikhs nnder whose auspices they are formed, and the result shows itself in perpetual varia tion and much confusion of tribal nomenclature. Another consequence of the looseness of the tribal system is a constant transfer of fighting power from one tribe or section to another,—a fact which goes far to explain the discrepancies between the numerical estimates that have been formed of the same body at different periods. In the present Gazetteer an endeavour has been made to present as accurately as' possible the grouping of the tribesmen at the present day; but it is probable that the account will soon be out of date. An explanation of the want of permanency in tribal matters in 'Arabistan may be found perhaps in the migratory habits of some of the tribes, who constantly change their place and are obliged, as a guarantee for their safety amid new surround ings, to affiliate themselves to strong tribes already established there. The important tribes of ^Arabistan, with the notable exception of the Bakhtiyaris and Lurs^ are all Arab, but they have a strain of Persian blood, which has increased perceptibly since the famine of 1872, when many Arabs bought Persian girls as wives. The vast majority, indeed practically all, are Shi^ahs ; and until recent years Sunnis, being considered infidels, had difficulty in obtaining justice. Some of the tribes of ''Arabistan are settled, others are nomadic; and some are difficult to class, being at present in a transitional stage between the two modes of life. The settled or semi-settled tribes are mainly agricultural, and the nomadic mainly pastoral; but even the latter culti vate a certain amount of grain in winter. Dwellings are houses^ huts and tent-. A mud house having a roof of timber and mud is called in Arabic Bait-at-Tain and in Persian Dar jb ; and every other habitation, except a tent, appears to be included in the term Kipar (Arabic, Kibar plural Kubarah ), though strictly speaking a * Obvious illustrations of these sfcarements could be collecled from the articles on particular tribes of 'Arabistan : here it may suffice to recall that besides the Nais tribe there are sections styled Nais belonging to the 'Anafijeh, Bait Sa'ad and Bani Turuf ; that Dallam are found among the 'Anafljeh, Kathir and Bait Sa'ad ; that A1 Bu 'Adhar are common to the Bani Saleh and Bani Turuf; that Halaf occu among the Bani Salela, Bani Tamim and Bani Turuf; that Hamdan and Sitatleh belong alike to the Bait Sa'ad and to the Bani Turuf; and that the Hamaid, Bani Lam, Bani Turuf and Ka'ab have sections called Maiyab. It is not contended that in all these cases oommunity of naire indicates community of blood, but ip some of them it certainly does.126 'AR A BIST AN Kipar is a hut of Bardi or Qassab reeds only. A mat hut is properly- styled Kukh (plural, Kuwakheh ), but may also be spoken of as Kipar Buwari. On the nomenclature and classification of huts composed in various ways of mud, matting, grass, reeds and tent cloth a manual might be written; but it is sufficient to note that Kipar is the most comprehensive term. In character and customs the Arab tribes of ^Arabistan are all more or less alike. Shaikhs or headmen are generally chosen, by the grey beards of the tribe or section, from a family in which the office is here ditary ; but the greybeards are not fettered in their selection by the wishes, or even by a nomination, of the late Shaikh ; in deciding between claims they pay much attention to fitness and experience. When the greybeards are not unanimous the tribe or section frequently break up and follow different Shaikhs. A dispute between men not belonging to the same tribe or section is arranged, if possible, by their respective chiefs in consultation. If the minor chiefs cannot agree a reference is made to a common superior having authority over both tribes or sections ; and in Southern 'Arabistan the Shaikh of Muhammareh thus generally becomes arbiter when the disagreement is between two of the larger tribes. In case of a murder, the blood money payable by the murderer is fixed in the above manner ; and, if the culprit has not the wherewithal to meet the demand, the adult males of his tribe or section must contribute rateably, according to the tribal books, to make up the deficiency. A case once settled by tribal custom cannot be re-opened by an appeal to the Shara' or ecclesiastical law. Religious shrines are numerous in the country and are of two kinds, Imamzadehs and Qadamgahs ; the difference appears to be that the Imamzadeh is (or is supposed to be) the actual tomb of a Shi'ah saint, while the Qadamgah is merely a cenotaph erected, as tradition usually relates, on a request from the spectre of the sacred personage whom it commemorates. Flora and fauna.— now return to the subjects which have not been dealt with at all in the subprovincial articles. The most widely distributed trees are the Kunar or ber and the tamarisk, the dwarf species of the latter being included ; they seem to occur almost everywhere that any natural wood exists. Smaller brush wood is confined chiefly to the banks of streams and consists, besides dwarf tamarisk, of Gharab or Euphrates poplar, SarTm (a medium-sized thorny bush), liquorice, willow, a kind of blackberry, and similar shrubs.I (lo) 'AEABISTAN 127 mots Other plants are the ^Ausaj, the Qaqilah, the Eimth—a plant which in habit somewhat resembles ling heather and is found growing near salt-water creeks,—and a kind of Salsola which is burned for potash. The swamps produce Qassab ; a reed of which matting is made, and Bardi or Labbun, a coarse marsh grass used for hut building. Of animals, and especially of birds, there is a large variety. There are said to be a few lions still in the jungles on the Karkheh and Diz Rivers and in the marshes near Fallahiyeh ; and the presence of a pair at Banneh in the Ahwaz District was reported in 1904. The lynx certainly exists, one having been seen near Shush in 1905, and the Arabs of the Ahwaz neighbourhood state that there are wolves. Marks of hyaena have been seen near Masiri ; and the jackal, fox, hare and porcupine are found there, and probably everywhere throughout the province. Wild pigs are numerous wherever there is cover ; of the fallow deer only a few remain in the jungles on the Diz, but gazelle—said to be of two kinds—are not uncommon, especially about Shakheh in the Ahwaz District, whence they sometimes approach Nasiri in the hot weather. Natives say that there are otters, and a badger was killed at Ramuz in 1905. Water rats are seen, of more than one sort. The mongoose lives in date plantations, and in the open plains near Ahwaz there is a small kind of jerboa. Bats exist. .Theie are scorpions, including a variety called Jarrar; also centipedes. Snakes of several kinds are found everywhere and lizards of more varieties than one in Nasiri alone. Locusts occasionally make their appearance, and appeared as jumpers in May 1905, subsequently develop ing wmgs. Mosquitoes are numerous in the damper parts of the province : in the drier districts their place is taken by sand-flies. There is also a fly like the ordinary house fly, but it stings sharply. Sharks frequent the Karun, and even the Gargar, and a fish called Anz, which is said to run to 185 lbs. in weight, abounds in the Karkheh and is present, though in smaller numbers, in the Karun. A small kind of turtle, about a foot long, lives in the Gargar and the Diz. Among land birds the sandgrouse is one of the most common; it is found everywhere in the open country, especially in the plains of the Hindiyan and Jarrahi Districts. The large kind (pterodes arenarius) and the small or pin-tailed kind (pterodes alclata) are both represented, the former being the more numerous; the local names for these are Kokar^y and Kharkharah respectively. The black partridge [francolinus vulgaris), by natives of the country called Duraj ijii,128 'ARABISTAN occurs wherever water and brushwood are found together^ as at many places on the Karun, Jarrahi, Hindiyan and Diz rivers: there appears to be also a distinct kind of brown partridge, which might easily be mistaken for the female of the black. The Sisi {jimwioperdix BonJiOiyni), locally styled Tihu y*#, frequents suitable stony grounds, as upon the Gargar and in the valley of the Hindiyan River; and the chikore {caccabis chuJcor), in Persian Kabk is found in the hills. The Houbarah bustard may be shot on the Hindiyan and Jarrahi plains, and it is said that the great bustard also has been seen. Quail visit the country in their season, and blue rock pigeons inhabit the banks of the Gargar. Swifts and sparrows are common; but the crow is rare at Nasiri and the rook, kite and mynah are said not to be seen there. Water birds include several kinds of duck; the snipe [gallinago scolopax), here called Tapuk ; the common curlew, especially near the sea; the great and small grebe; the purple and ordinary coot; the bittern, and a bird called Baiyudhi which is probably an egret. The woodcock is said not to be unknown. Agriculture and livestoclc. —'Arabistan is a fertile and productive country and the variety of crops is considerable; wheat and barley are the most general in their distribution, but rice, cotton, sesame and beans also are grown in a number of the districts. Linseed, maize or millet, and different kinds of pulse are produced in some localities. Special crops are indigo in the Dizful District, opium and pepper in the Shushtar District, and tobacco in 'Aqili and Ramuz. Vegetables include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, Lubiya (a kind of French bean), garlic and onions: in the Shushtar District all of these are obtainable. The most widely distributed fruits are dates, pomegranates, figs and grapes; but limes (both sweet and bitter), oranges, citrons, quinces, apples, pears, apricots, plums, peaches, mulberries, water melons, musk melons and almonds are grown in various places. Dizful and Ramuz appear to be two of the best fruit-producing districts; yet it is reported that in Ramuz all the fruit trees, except dates, are of recent introduction.* Cultivation in ^Arabistan is either by rainfall, when it is called Daimi or by irrigation, in which case it is described as Paryab • The most heavily irrigated districts are those of Fallahiyeli, Hawizeh and Mutammarel^ in which is grown the bulk of the dates and of the » In the 10th century A.D. sugarcane was the most important crop of 'Arabistan and the province supplied the whole of Persia, Mesopotamia and Arabia with sugar (vide lie Strange).

Local terms relating to irrigation are f eaS1 ^ Shakheh , a main canal; Naqreh a branch of the same; Nahr^frS a smaller than a Shakheh; Jub ; an ordinary Q ^ open water channel; and Qanat 0U3 ; a subterranean aqueduct like fce « Karez ^ of the Indo-Afghan frontier.

Dob is apparently a long shallow depression in which water tends to collect. mp Domestic animals are horses^ mules^ camels^ donkeys, buffaloes, ' m cattle, and sheep and goats. The distribution of these, like the distribu- 'ift tion of the crops, follows to some extent the character of the country; buffaloes, for instance, occur only in the wetter tracts such as the Fallahiyeh and Hawizeh Districts and parts of the Districts of Dizful and Hindiyan^ while camels and mules are kept chiefly in the drier nek districts. Camels are not ridden in 'Arabistan, and ' mounted men ^ in e J M this province are generally mounted on mares : almost all colts are inten- ^ tionally destroyed. Of sheep and goats the former are the more numer- ous, and in some parts there is only a sprinkling of goats.

Small ports exist at Buziyeh and Ma'shur, but they [ tk ar e without steam communication; at both the amount of shipping and of 11 tk business transacted is inconsiderable, and Ma^shur is partially dependent for its trade upon Muhammareh. Buziyeh serves the Fallahiyeh and ^ P ar t ef the Jarrahi District, the remainder of the Jarrahi District being commercially attached to Ma^shur; but Muhammareh is the ^ P or ^ of all 'Arabistan and even, to a slight extent, of parts of Persia tie beyond it. In 1905-1906 the steamers which called at Muhammareh numbered 143, of which 140 were British, and their tonnage aggregated ^ 137,070. No exact estimate is possible of the native sailing craft that yisit Muhammareh annually, but it is stated that about 100 such130 'ARABISTAN mi* from. vessels ranging' from 80 to 150 tons burden call there in the date season and a similar number during the remainder of the year. The average annual value of the merchandise (other than specie) exported from Muhammarell in recent years has been about £100;000, The chief articles of export are dates^ wool ; gum, oil-seeds and opium, and in some years wheat. The dates exported are mostly of the mis cellaneous inferior sorts called Sair : the best kind of local date, known as Qantar, is not sent out of the country, and the proportion of the superior Khadhrawi and Halawi varieties is small in proportion to the quantity of Sairs. Dates go chiefly to India, the Uuited Kingdom and America, but some are carried by native sailing boats to Masqat, the Red Sea and other places. The date trade is influenced by a prohibition in con sequence of which no private owner may bring his dates on the market until those of the Shaikh of Muhammareh have been cleared of r one result of this rule is that the smaller merchants are sometimes obliged to part with their stocks to the Shaikhs broker at a very low price. The grain trade is uncertain and fluctuating : in the past it has been greatly hampered by embargoes on exportation suddenly and arbitrarily flire. imposed in the interest of local officials and notables. A large quantity lib of the good wheat sold at Basrah, is from ''Arabistan, and in favourable years such as 1903 the native merchants of Basrah send agents to Itrea: Nasiri to buy. The destination of the wheat exported is generally the Mtice United Kingdom ; that of the wool, India and the United Kingdom. Gum includes gum tragacanth from the direction of Isfahan and ordinary ifin gums collected at Nasiri ; both are sent chiefly to the United Kingdom. Of the oil-seeds, linseed goes mostly to India, the United Kiugdom and Germany; and sesame to India and France. Opium from the side of Isfahan is nearly all consigned to Hong Kong: local opium from Jitde Shushtar is said not to go beyond Masqat. Other exports are raw cotton to India and Turkey, bugloss and almonds to India, barley to ports of the Persian Gulf, tobacco chiefly to Egypt, and madder root to the United Kingdom and to France ; there are also carpets of Isfahan origin. il^L Altogether about half the exports from Muhammarell are to India and nearly a quarter to the Uuited Kingdom; the shares in the remainder of countries not under the British flag are sepurately inconsiderable, especially when a further deduction has been made for the large quantities of opium that are shipped to Hong Kong. The import trade of Mnhammareh is worth, at the present time, about . E^SjOOO annually. The most valuable items, in their usual order of ^ J importance, appear to be : cotton goods, sugar, metal and metal goods^ S!ARABISTAN 131 ^ thread and twisty tea^ silk ; and wood for making' date boxes. The cotton goods are chiefly from Bombay or Manchester^ and the Indian article— lai1 ^ which is chiefly grey or indigo-dyed—exceeds the English in quantity J but not in value. The sugar is from various European countries, chiefly ^ 4 France, Belgium, Germany and Austria; but some is received from M Egypt, and a small quantity from Mauritius. Metals are chiefly iron e, ' ill(lfl and steel from India and the United Kingdom, whence also come most of thread and twist. The tea is mostly Indian : the silk goods are Indian, ^4 British, French and Japanese. Other imports are rice, drugs, spices and indigo from India, and kerosine from Eussia and America. The imports thett a t Muhammareh. in recent years from countries forming part of the 011 in f British Empire has amounted on the average to more than four-fifths of the ii; the whole, cleairit 5 mi Internal trade. —The only considerable centre of internal trade is a yerj! Muhammareh Town, whence distribution of imported goods is carried on ititU and where local merchandise is collected for exportation. After i aril Muhammareh the most important commercial entrepot in the province 'ge (ji is Nasiri, which, since the opening of the Karun to navigation, has [ faYot superseded Ma'shur as the port of the landlocked Ramuz District. 1 affeii; The mercantile position of the towns of Dizful and Shuslltar enerallj! deserves notice with reference to the surrounding hill and other tribes and d Kiif to the general trade of the province. The Arab tribes of Northern Joi ; Arabistan have their dealings with both Dizful and Shushtar, and M Dizful is also the market town of the Western Lurs. The commodities i^M with which the tribes supply themselves at these centres include sugar, tea, ^ 6 | dates, date syrup, rice, beans, onions, garlic, tobacco, matches, candles, ^3 locally-made soap, henna, ready-made clothes of European, material, or |, g gi block-printed cloth of Persian manufacture, leather shoes, cotton shoes ; felt, hair rope, horse and mule saddles, copper vessels, spades, horse shoes ^ ^ and other articles of iron ; also lead, gunpowder and rifles. Besides these the Arabs take kerchiefs and the Bakhtiyaris felt hats ; while the . o yj Arabs purchase some wheat and barley, as do also the Bakhtiyaris and lin J the Lurs, and that in greater quantities than the Arabs. At Dizful and e ggpct Shushtar the Arab tribes bring in ghi, curds, wool and live sheep for | eg0 |()jj sale ; they also supply wheat, barley, millet, mules and horses to the Dizful market, and skins and hides to that of Shuslltar. At both places the Bakhtiyaris bring in ghi, wool, live sheep, gum, charcoal and j J bitter almonds : Dizful they also supply with curds, goats, lime and a few etal6 c&lt; ru ^ ail( i Shushtar with goats''hair. The Bakhtiyaris of Mai Amir, K %i ' 11 IT i: 132 'ARABISTAN Murgheh and Anteh Kuh are among' those who have dealings with SMshtar ; and the more neighbouring 1 Bakhtiyaris of 'Aqili provide the town with donkeys, hides, linseed, rice, firewood, honey, pomegranates, water melons and salt ; also ashes—said to be of dnng—which are used for mixing with a lime made from boulders found in the bed of the Karun. The commodities brought by the Western Lurs to the Dizful market are chiefly live goats, ghi, firewood and charcoal. Both towns deal with Muhammarell Town by way of the Karun, goods for Bizful passing in this case through Shushtar en route. Piece-goods are the most valuable of the imports by river; but sugar, tea, matches, candles, iron, copper, lead and German silver are also imported in con siderable quantities by this line; and letter paper, liquors, boots and shoes, glassware and henna are also received, though on a smaller scale. Both Dizful and Shushtar have trade relations with Isfahan and obtain thence native fabrics with block-printed patterns called Qalamkar and cotton shoes known as Giwehs : besides these, dark cloth for women s veils, linen cloth, waist-cloths, and a sweetmeat styled Halwa Gaz y compounded from a sticky exudation of the tamarisk tree, are brought from Isfahan to Dizful ; and Shush tar receives from the same source various native textile fabrics, dried fruits, walnuts, pipe tobacco and tea samovars. Dizful has dealings with a number of other places besides Isfahan and is provided with lacquered boxes^ spoons and tobacco from Khonsar ; with tanned leather from Hamadan ; and, when the route —which has been closed to trade for some years—is open, with wheat, barley, gram, dried fruits, pistachios, saddle-fittings, samovars and trays from Khuiramabad and Burujird. There is also some direct trade between the Towns of Dizful and Shushtar, the latter supplying the former not only with foreign merchandise brought from Muhammareh, but also with pottery, sieves, local soap, local petroleum and dates ; while Dizful in return provides Sliushtar with raw cotton, indigo, rice, beans. Mash, fruit, felt cloth, pencases, and in some seasons with wheat. The production of raw silk, an industry which seems to have flourished in Arabistan in the 10th century A. D.,* appears to have ceased. Salt is sent to Dizful from the village of Gotwand near Shushtar. Wool, linseed, hides, gums and sometimes wheat form part of the contri bution of both the Dizful and the Shushtar Districts to the export trade of Arabistan; and in addition to these the former produces indigo, raw cotton and pen-reeds for the foreign market, while the Shushtar District is a source of opium. * Vide Le Strange,'AEABTSTAN 133 The commercial characteristics of the remaining districts of 'Arabistan may be described in a few words. The Aliwaz District produces grain : its river port is Nasiri and its sea port Muhammareh. Nasiri is a centre for the collection of ordinary (or so-called insoluble) gums. The exports of the Fallahiyeh District are dates^ rice, wheat, barley, wool, ghi ; hides and the skins and feathers of the Baiyudhi and other birds found in the marshes. The dates are mostly disposed of to sailing boats from the Persian Gnlf at the local port of Buziyeh; the wheat and barley are purchased by visitors from Kuwait, Bushehr, Bahrain and Masqat ; Kuwait is the destination of most of the rice; the remaining articles are sent to Muhammareh. Town. Imports into Fallahiyeh. are chiefly piece-goods from Muhammareh Town, and metals, coffee, tea, sugar and spices from Kuwait. Buziyeh, besides being the port, is the only trade centre in the district; at Fallahiyeh Town, though it is the political capital, business is inconsiderable. The trade of the Hawizeh District is mostly with ''Amarah on the Tigris Eiver by way of the marshes and the Jahalah canal: rice and hsh constitute the sole exports. Of the Hindiyan District the only valuable exports are grain and wool, which are sent abroad in considerable quantities from the similarly named capital and port upon the Hindiyan River. Imports consist of necessities of life and simple luxuries which the district does not itself produce. Jarrahi is a pastoral district with a small population : wheat, barley and a little sesame are the only agricultural exports. It imports dates from the neighbouring district of Fallahiyeh and rice from that of Eamuz, while its small demand for piece-goods, tea, sugar and spices is met by the sea ports of Bliziyeh and Ma'shur. Ma'shur is merely a port, though it ranks as a district, and it is unnecessary to repeat here the facts about its trade which are fully stated in the article under its name. Ma^shur, as already mentioned, has lost to Nasiri the foreign trade of the Ramuz District; and little now remains to it beyond a share in the trade of Jarrahi. Dates and date-syrup are the most important products of the Muham- ttiareh District, of which the port is naturally Muhammarell Town: for the latter reason it is difficult to discriminate the trade of the district from that of ^Arabistan as a whole. Itamuz Town is a market and depot of exportation for the produce of the district of which it is capital and also for that of the adjacent134 'AKABISTAK Bakhtiyari and Eastern Lur hills. The exportable products of the plain are wheats barley, sesanie ; rice, beans, linseed, ghi, wool and hides: those of the mountains are wool, gums, various nuts, a kind of logwood and some carpets. Piece-goods, metals, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, crockery and candles are among the chief imports of the district. The trade of Ramaz with places abroad is now conducted chiefly through Nasiri, hut a part of it is still carried on direct with Muhammareh Town by way of the Jarrahi River. Manufwttures .—There are no manufactures of any importance in ^Arabistan. Such handicrafts as exist are exercised chiefly at the towns of Dizful and Shushtar, in the articles on which they are described. Currency and accou7its,^^hQ currency of ''Arabistan is much the same as that of the Persian Coast, but it has a somewhat different nomenclature. The Qran, worth ordinarily about English, is not the commonest coin in actual circulation, but it is the most convenient to take as a basis for the money table of ; Arabistan. The coins actually current in the province are the following \— Name. Si} ah Pul Nominal value ii Qraas, Shahi Sr Qamari Lfj** Qran vjlf Variable.

Besides these actual corns tbere is an imaginary unit called a Pinar Arii equal to the one-thousandth part of a Qran; for this reason the etwt Qran itself is often spoken of simply as' Hazar' or thousand beeonh Qrans). At Dizful aiid Shushtar the single Qran is sometimes also called ' Riyal '—a very misleading abuse of terms. Persians ordinarily work out Qran sums in Tumans and Dinars, but they express fractions of a Qran in Qamaris and 8hahis and not in Dinars. Europeans and Arabs reckon in Qrans, the Arabs making use of the Qamari and half Qamari to express fractions, and Europeans of ' cents.' Some native merchants are said to keep their accounts in Qamaris. AraN For Turkish gold Lirahs and for Indian rupees there is always a iljiki. demand; and Maria Theresa dollars and Turkish Majidis also can generally be disposed of. The value of these foreign coins is liable to tea' fluctuations.

The Indian rupee has acquired a conven- [,''1,1 tional value of S-85 Qrans, and the word ' Eubiyah ' is sometimes (it is p' 1 * said) used by Arabs to express this amount even in transactions into which the rupee as a coin does not itself enter. The rupee is to all^1 !» I 136 'AKABISTAN intents and pnrposes current at Muhammareh Town: m the Bazaars of Nasiri, Shushtar or Dizful, the case is otherwise; bnt even at those places merchants willing to purchase Indian rupees can ordinarily be found. At Nasiri a coin with the slightest crack or defect is invariably refused, but such coins are current at Dizful and to a lesser extent at Shuslitar and E amuz. Weights and measures. —The only weight common to the whole of 'Arabistan is the Misqal , which is used like the English grain as a standard for comparing different weights that are neither multiples nor aliquot parts of one another: 97 , 744 Misqals are equal to 1 lb. avoirdupois English. The only larger weights in general use are the Man-i-Tabriz ^ of 640 Misqals or 6*5478 lbs. English, which under the name of ' Batman has been adopted by the Persian Imperial Customs as their unit of weight in all parts of Persia, and the Man-i- Shiraz jl^ ^ of 720 Misqals or 7*8662 lbs. which is not altogether unknown in general trade. Besides these there is a Man-i-Shahi ^ of 1,280 Misqals or 13*095 lbs. English, which appears to be used only in arranging transport on the Bakhtiyari Road, and the British steamship Oke or company on the Karun do their business everywhere in an Huqqah of 2*87 lbs. The weights used at Ma'shur are described in the article on that place. The other local standards which still hold the field in native trade are those given in table below :— District where used.

Englisli; and in the Muhammareh District date crops are computed by means of the Karah of 1| tons English, which is mentioned above as used in the Ahwaz District. At Nasiri, Dizftil and Shushtar, and possibly in some of the other districts, the local Man ^ is subdivided as below 4 Sanar ji* = 1 Charak; 2 Charak = 1 Pashti. ^ a Pashti Jy&amp;i 1 Dahsi. 4 Dahsi := 1 M^Ui Liquids are sold by weight or, if in small quantities, by the reputed quart bottle. Units of linear measurement are the Gaz-i-Shah sU j? of 40 to 41 inches and the double cubit; the latter, called by Persians Zar' ^ and by the Arabs Dhara^ varies in ^Arabistan between 32 inches in Shushtar and rallahiyell and 37 inches or even more in other'ARAB I STAN 139 districts. Persians subdivide this measure into Nim ^ or halves and w Rub'' fJ; or quarters; by Arabs these are styled Nuss ^ (for and Ruba^ £&gt;&gt; The Rub^ or Ruba^ is also called a Charak and the Charak is said to consist of 4 Gireh *J. Piece-goods are sometimes sold by the English yard: otherwise they are measured by the actual cubit [viz&gt; } the combined length of a man^s forearm and hand) ; or ; usually, by the actual double cubit [viz., the distance from a man^s nose to the tip of his fingers when the arm is extended). In some parts of the country, and especially in Northern ^Arabistan^ distances are estimated by the Farsakh (Persian) or Sa^at (Arabic), which is equal to some thing between and 4 English statute miles. Areas are generally described in terms of their dimensions; but a rudimentary unit of square measurement for land exists on the Shatt-al- 'Arab in the Jarib Jarib is supposed to accommodate 200 date palms and on the average it appears to have a superficies of about acres, but in practice its size is somewhat variable. There is also CM the Faddan (Arabic) or Khish^ (Persian), a somewhat in definite measure of land, but one more generally understood than the Jarib : it is described as being that area of land which can be j)loughed over with one pair of bullocks during the season of ploughing, or which requires 100 Shushtar Mans (13 cwts. English) of seed to sow it. It is evidently the same as the Gao of the Persian Coast and in the Hindiyan District it is even called by that name. Commercial Usages and ohstacles to ^^.—Importation of goods from abroad generally takes place at the order of the larger merchants, and from these the petty dealers and shopkeepers obtain their stocks. Traders, whether on the large or on the small scale, frequently keep their merchandise—especially the more valuable articles—at their private residences instead of at their places of business. In the date-growing districts credit is ordinarily allowed for goods purchased until the following date season, and in other parts until the ensuing harvest of cereals. The principal difficulty with which foreign traders in ^ArabistaU have to contend is the uncertainty (and frequent impossibility) of recovering sums due. This difficulty arises from the absence of proper tribunals and is common to the whole of Persia. It is probable that if adequate arrangements were made in ^Arabistan for enforcing the just * For the Bamuz Khisb, however, see article Bamuz Districts -140 'ARABISTAN claims of foreign merchants a portion at least of the European trade with Western Persia which at present passes through Baghdad would enter the country through Muhammareh instead. Water communications.—Access from the sea to Muhaminareh Town is afforded by the Shatt-al -'Arab, and to the minor ports of Buziyeh and Ma'shur by Khor Musa : the river and the inlet are described in articles under their own names. The principal waterways in the interior of the province are the Karun and Jarrahi and; to a lesser extent^ the Hindiyan River : a steamer is run on the lower Karun by the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and another on the upper Karun by the same Company on behalf of the Persian Government. The Karkheh and Diz do not appear to be utilised for purposes of travel or of carriage, except that at certain seasons wood is made into rafts and floated down the Diz by Arabs, chiefly to Ahwaz on the Karun. The Fallahiyeh- Marid canal or Shakheh, which connects the Karun and Jarrahi rivers and so provides water communication—though at present of an unsatisfactory character—between the towns of Muhammareh and Fallahiyeh^ is noticed in the article on the Fallahiyeh District. The navigational features of the streams of ^Arabistan are described in the separate articles which are devoted to them, and for statistics of river (as well as of seagoing) craft the articles on the appropriate towns and villages may be consulted. Here however we may mention that the native cargo boats on the lower Karun amount to 19 Mahailahs and a dozen Nassari Ballams, owned at Muhammareh Town ; and that there are 17 native cargo boats at Ahwaz which ply upon the upper river. The carrying power of the Mahailahs is from 200 to 600 gunny bags. Besides these about 80 passenger Ballams are obtainable at Muhammarell Town, and about 40 small ferry boats are stationed at different villages on the Karun and Gargar between Muhammareh and Shushtar. There are also a number of small Ballams in the Pallahiyeh. District. On the Karun native sailing boats maintain a not unsuccessful competition with the steamers, especially in the carriage of grain; this may be explained by the facts that the owners accept grain in bulk and do not insist on bagging, that for petty collections from point to point small craft have a natural advantage over large, and that the boat of the country is able to some extent to evade the embargo when imposed.'ARABISTAN 141 ^ Land communications. —With one or two notable exceptions, especially ^ the Bakhtiyari Road and the route between Shtishtar and Dizful Towns, land communications are subsidiary to the Kartin and Jarrahi rivers and are of comparatively slight importance. The main obstacles ^ to movement by land are rivers and marshes, and, in places, the lawless . state of the inhabitants. In wet weather long detours must often be y made in order to avoid impassable ground; whereas in dry weather, on 1 the contrary, the possibility of obtaining water sometimes becomes the governing factor in a choice of routes. farii The principal routes in ''Arabistan may be arranged in 6 groups according as they start from (1) Muhammareh Town, (2) Nasiri, (3) Shushtar Town, (4) Dizful Town or (5) Ma^hur or lie in the (6) Hindiyan District. It will be sufficient to indicate the courses of these routes, leaving the distances in most cases to be roughly determined by map and the probable nature and amount of supplies available to be gauged by means of the articles on the districts, etc., traversed; the majority of the routes being described from native information only it seems inexpedient to enter into greater detail. 1. [a) Boute from Muhammareh Town to Dizful Toivn. —This caravan route follows more or less the right bank of the Karun passing by Rahwali (about 20 miles), Sab''eh (about 30 miles) and Umm- at-Tamair (about 35 miles). Leaving the river at the last-named place the route strikes northwards and crosses the Kharur and Sharish branches of the Shaur River, which travellers must bridge for themselves with local timber ; beyond this point the route runs between the left bank of the Shaur and the right bank of the Diz and finally crosses to the left bank of the Diz at or near Dizful. Until 1892 about one caravan from Dizful used to arrived at Muhammarell by this route every 6 weeks: it was then preferred to the river route as enabling merchants to escape the extortions of Persian officials. Troops moving up the Karun by land from Muhammarell would follow the right bank, at least until the marshes on the left bank, in the Muhammareh. District, were left behind. 1. (5) Boute from Muhammareh Town to Falldhlyeh The ordinary route is by water via the Karun River and the Marid-Fallahiyeh Canal; but there are also winding paths, practicable for transport animals, which conduct from the left bank of the Karun to Fallaliiyeh Town.m 'AHABISTAN 2. (a) Route from Nanri to Dizful Travellers between Nasiri and Dizful ordinarily g-o hy Shushtar Town^ but—the state of tribal politics permitting 1 —it is possible to march by the right bank of Biz. The total distance is said to be about 90 miles^ and it seems probable that this route falls into route No. 1 (^) at a short distance from Nasiri, 3. (b) Route from Nasiri to Shushtar Town. —The route runs up the left bank of the Karun to Wais Q6 miles)^ and continues along the same to a point opposite Eand-i-Qir (10 miles),, where it crosses the Gar gar into Miyanab. Prom Band-i-Qir the way lies by ■'Arab Hasan on the S hat ait (14 miles) and thence to Shushtar Town ,16 miles). The nature of the latter part of this route will be better understood on reference to the article on Miyanab, where also some unimportant variants are mentioned. Supplies are scarce^ but water of course is plentiful, between Nasiri and Shush tar In connection with this route may be mentioned a horse tramway^ owned b y a Persian merchant^ which runs from Nasiri to Ahwaz Village ; it is 2 /00 yards in length and the gauge is 3 feet. It passes through Nasiri and then behind (that is inland of) the village of Ahwaz. There are 2 new and 2 old trucks^ each of which can carry 2 tons and is drawn in good weather by a single horse. At present there are 6 trained horses. The permanent-way is unballasted and the wooden sleepers are crooked; but for practical purposes the line is efficient. The sole function of this tiamway is to transfer goods from vessels on the lower to those on the upper Karun and vice versa. 2. (c) Route from Nasiri to Isfahan. —This line of communication consists of a road constructed by the firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers through the Bakhtiyari hills on behalf of the Bakhtiyari Khans : it was opened for traffic in December 1899. Among natives it is generally known as the Rah-i-Bakhtiyari or the Bakhtiyari Road^ but its name at Isfahan is Rah-i-^Arabistan. The first 40 miles only of this route lie in 'Arabistan : they present no difficulties to wheeled transport except in wet weather. From Nasiri the road follows the left bank of the Karun by Qraneh and Kut Saiyid •'Anayeh to Wais (16 miles) which is the first stage; from Wais it runs by Umm-al-Gharaibeh^ Linhairi and Rag'haiweh to 'Alwaniyeh (24 miles) : these places are described in the article on the Ahwaz District. One and a half miles beyond Alwaniyeh the road enters the hills.* # This route has been minutely described by Captain D L. R Larimer, Vice-Consul in 'Arabistan, and his report is in possession of the Intelligence Branch, Simla. As the route does not properly belong to 'Arabistan it is only mentioned here.@ 'ARABISTAN 143 2. (d) Route from Mdnri to Bamuz Town, —The length of this route, which runs across the plains of the Ahwaz and Ramuz Districts, is about 60 miles in actual travelling*. It breaks off ; as does also the Persian telegraph line to Ptamuz and Burazjan, from route No. 2 (c) at 2 miles from Nasiri : it lies at first along the north side of the Kuh-i- Ahwaz across plains which are sometimes cultivated with wheat, but in places are grassy and trackless, and in others swampy. At 26 miles the village of Shakheh in the tract of the same name is passed, and at 32 miles the Gupal stream is crossed near the place where the camp of Shaikh Rashid generally stands on its right bank; the nature of the crossing, which is sometimes difficult and after rain impassable, is described in the article on the Gupal stream. Beyond the Gupal the route after traversing a bejt of sandhills, crosses the level plain of Bu^airish and at 39 miles reaches the administrative border between the Ahwaz and Ramuz districts. At 8 miles from this border, or 47 miles from Nasiri, the route crosses the Muwailheh affluent of the Gupal, and at 49 miles the village of Mirbacheh is passed ; at 4 miles beyond Mirbacliell the Zarnini stream is encountered; and finally, at 7 miles from the Zarnini and 60 from Uasiri, the track enters Ramuz Town, having lain after Mirbacheh across cultivated grassy and swampy plains. The Muwailheh and Zarnmi are described in the article on Ramuz District. Cart caravans of the D'Arey Oil Concession Syndicate now leave the Karun Eiver at Shikarehand proceed by Easiri, Wais and ^Alwamyeh* in the Ahwaz District, and along the foot of the Kuh-i-Gach which bounds the Ramuz District on its north-eastern side, until the valley of the liamuz River is reached 5 miles east of Eamuz Town. The route then runs up the valley, crossing the river 3 times, to Shardin Mamatain, etc., where there are oil borings. For 10 miles beyond Wais the track is very soft in wet weather, and for the next 5 miles there are sandy hills; but beyond this, along the foot of the Kuh-i-Gach, the going is good, except for the crossing of the Kindak tributary of the Gupal which is difficult after rain. The Ramuz River is not uncrossable for ridden animals for more than a few days at a time j but vehicles may be greatly delayed there. 2. [e) Route from JSdsi i to Euziyeh and -This route runs to Puda J in the Ahwaz District (16 miles) and thence to Gharaibeh on the Jarrahi Hiver (22 miles). The Malih stream accompanies the ror te on its western side for the first two-thirds of the second march and then expands into a large Hor or swamp ; from this point for about 2^ ^ See Route 3 (&amp;) below f144 'ARABISTIN miles there is a Hor on the eastern side also ; and the track follows an elevated strip of land between the two. This narrow strip is cnt across by one or two channels connecting* the two bodies of water, and it appears that at times it is itself submerged : in fact the practicability of this ronte depends in part on weather and season. Between the marshes and Gharaibeh there is only one easy canal to be crossed. From Gharaibeh communication with Fallahiy eh. Town and Buziyeh is maintained chiefly by boat. Cotton goods manufactured at Shushtar are regularly sent by this route, and the forwarding charge is 15 to 20 Tumans per 100 Shushtar Mans for the whole journey by road and river. If the Jarrahi be crossed at Gharaibeh and the left bank be then followed upstream for some distance it brings the traveller into one of the routes to Ma'shur. (See Route No. 5 (a) below.) 3. (^) Eoiite from Shushtar Town to Dizful Town.—The most direct route between these two important centres is via Kaunak, 22- miles from Shushtar and 16 from Dizful^ which affords a convenient halting place and has flowing but rather brackish water. Some caravans travel by Ab Bid, skirting the right bank of the Karun for the first half of the first march : water is obtainable at Ab Bid, which divides the journey into two equal stages of 21 miles each. Travellers from Dizful to Shushtar by Ab Bid may strike the Karun at Gotwand and complete their journey by water. 3. {h) Route from Shushtar to Rdmuz.~~ r £\i\&amp; route runs along the outer foot of the Gypsum Hills which extend in a continuous line from the one place to the other. The total distance is said to be about 7 0 miles, and it is divided into 3 stages of which the first is perhaps rather shorter than the two others; the intermediate halting places are ordi- tw narily at Darreh Naft 8^ and at 'Alwaniyeh in the Ahwaz District (or on the banks of the Kindak affluent of the Gupal a few miles beyond 'Alwaniyeh). In wet weather a different route appears to be followed from a point 8 miles from Shushtar Town to the neigh bourhood of ^ Alwaniyeh : travellers by this variant usually make the U) first halt at a place called Mazzabanur jyjj* 0 instead of at Darreh Naft. 3. (c) Houte from Shushtar Town to Eawlzeh Town, —The inter mediate stages on this route are given as Band-i-Qir—see route No. 2 {a) above—and Kut Nahr H^shim^ and the total distance is stated at about 80 miles.I' 'ABABISTAN 145 4. (a) Route from Dizful Town to &gt; Amara/i.~~- r rh.e following are given as the stages upon this route :—a camp known by the name of Shaikh Mushattat of the Bani Lam tribe, 18 miles; Qiraiziyah, where there is a small spring, 16 miles; the Dawairij stream, where there is water (but bitter), 24 miles ; Sifsafat oliLaio on the left bank of the Tigris^ 28 miles. From Sifsafat the route is said to follow the Tigris bank to ^Amarah for 16 miles, the total distance being thus 102 mile&amp; 4. {h) Routes from Dizful Town to KhuTTcimdhad*'~li}\iQYQ are apparently 4 routes from Dizful Town to Khurramabad of which the 3 easternmost partially coincide with one another: in length they vary from 8 to 12 stages. The easternmost of all, which is also the most direct, is known as the Kiyalan route and is about 150 miles in length; it was once provided with caravansarais, but insecurity has completely closed it to traffic since six or seven years. These routes lie outside of ^Arabistan and it is enough to mention them here.* 4. (c) Routes from Bizful Town to Isfahan is said to be connected with Isfahan by two routes through the hills, one of which (by Khonsar consists of 18, and the other (by Gulpaigan of 20 stages. 4. [d) Route from Dizful Town to Havnzeh The first few stages on this route are the same as the last ones upon route No. 1 (^) above: the present route then diverges to the right and follows th§ ine fe Karkheh River to Hawizeh about I 5. (a) Routes from Ma 3 shur to Fallahlyeh 'One route runs north-westwards from Ma'shur until it strikes the left bank of the Jarrahi River at two miles above Saraimeh: Saraimeh, at 15 miles from Ma'shur, is a convenient halting place. The second stage is from Saraimeh along the left bank of the Jarrahi to the take-off of the Janjireh canals (15 miles). From Janjireh to Fallahiyeh Town the distance by the river and its continuation the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal is 13 miles ; and from the fact that boat is usually taken at Janjirell it may be inferred that progress by land on the river bank is difficult below e intff that point, on account of the numerous canals which are thrown off. ^ ^ *^ e most re3ent sports on these routes are by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, Vioe- Consul in 'Arabistan, and will be found in the Government of India's Political Proceedings for October 1904. J*146 'ABABISTAN From Ma'shur to Janjireh the route is passable to all arms in ordinary weather; supplies are obtainable and water is abundant,* The other route from Ma'shur to Buziyeh. and so to Fallahiyeli Town lies by Imamzadeh ''Abdul Hasan in the FallaMyeh. District (20 miles) audits total length is perhaps 30 miles: a variant of it passes by Ramleh which is four miles south-east of the Imamzadeh. This second route to Buziyeh, sometimes called the 'Aquleh route after a locality through which it passes at eight miles from Ma'shur, is interrupted in winter by flooded country between Imamzadeh ^Abdul Hasan and Buziyeh ; and the traveller may then, if irrigation in the Shatut tract permits^ make from Imamzadeh ■'Abdul Hasan for Nahr-ash-Shaikh on the Jarrahi River (12 miles) and then follow the left bank of the river down to a place opposite Gharaibeh, where boats can be obtained. The 'Aquleh route has fresh water and its course is very nearly straight.t 5. {b) Route from Ma'sMr to Ramuz Town. —The stages are Rahaneh on the Jarrahi Kiver (16 miles), Cham-as -Sabi (19 miles); and Ramuz Town (about 25 miles); the total distance is about 60 miles. The route crosses from the right to the left bank of the JarraM at Rahaneh; it then runs to Cham-as -Sabi, keeping within 3 miles of the river all the way; 4 or 5 miles beyond Cham-as -Sabi a gorge in low mud hills is entered, and for 10 miles or so thereafter the ground traversed is more or less broken and hilly; at 7 miles before Ramuz Town the track diverges from the river bank; and at 1 mile before the end of the stage the village of Kimeh is passed. The principal obstacle on this route is the Jarrahi River ; at the crossing place at Rahaneh it is about 50 yards wide and has perpendicular banks 15 feet high; the current here is not generally rapid, but in winter a maximum depth of 13 feet of water may be attained. At 10 miles beyond Rahaneh there is a deep ravine which requires ramping for wheels^ and at 4 or 5 miles beyond Cham-as -Sabi some cutting and widening would be necessary. With the exceptions noted the route is good throughout and passable to all arms ; some supplies also are obtainable, and there is plenty of fresh water from the Jarrahi by the way. ^ An exact description of this route by Major E. B. Burton (with a map) will be found in Government of India's Proceedings in the Foreign Department for July 190 4. f This route has been more fully described by Captain D. L. E. Lorimer, Vice- Consul in 'Arabistan, in a letter No. 412, dated 22nd March 1906, to the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf.'ARABISTAN 147 This route is used by caravans in summer and autumn after the wheat and rice harvests; at other times there is but little traffic on it,* 6. (a) Route from HinMycin Village to Ma'shur. —A track runs from Hindiyan village along- the right bank of the Hindiyan Eiver to ' Abbad Ilahi village a few miles further down; it then strikes away north-westwards to Ma^sMr. The distance by this route cannot be less than 40 miles, but some miles might possibly be saved by travelling in a more direct line between the two termini. The ground crossed appears to be a plain, fairly level, of which parts are grassy, t 6. (h) Routes from Hindiydn Tillage to Belihehan Town. —The principal line of communication within the Hindi yan District is a track that everywhere skirts the right bank of the Hindiyan River. Travellers from Hindiyan to Behbehan either follow this track to Cham Zaidan and thence strike direct for Behbehan, or proceed by Gargari on the Hindiyan to Cham Siyah on the Ma run and thence up the valley of the Ma run to Behbehan, The distance by the former of these routes appears to be 75 or 80 and by the latter 60 or 65 miles. 6. [c) Routes from Hindiyan Village to l)llam % —The way lies by Shah Abul Shah (at about 25 miles) and the total distance is between 30 and 35 miles over plains. An alternative route is up the right bank of the Hindiyan River to Chihl Mani (6 miles); thence, crossing the river, to Shah Abul Shah (24 miles) j and so to Dllam (about 8 miles). Beyond Chihl Mani the track first crosses good grazing land w T ith numerous flocks of goats and sheep; at about 14 miles it traverses a plain with sparse herbage, which is muddy in wet weather j and as Shah Abul Shah is approached it follows a line of sandhills which are hemmed in between mud-flats on the landward side and the sea upon the other. J This route appears to be free of obstacles except in wet weather. Telegraphic communications, —The telegraphic system of ; Arabistan is entirely under Persian management and extremely inefficient; the wires are frequently interrupted — sometimes for weeks together^ the * This route has been minutely described by Major E. B. Burton— vide Government of India's Proceedings in the Foreign Department for July 1904, where also a map will be found. f See Pelly and Colvill's Becent Tour. 1 From a report by Colonel Bail ward, R.F.A. L 2AEABISTAN signalling is defective, and messages are only sent in tlie Persian language ;* consequently the lines are of little service to Europeans except for the simplest purposes. The central telegraph office in 'Arabistan is at Nasiri, from which place one branch line runs to Muhammareh. Town and another via Shushtar Town to Dizful Town : Nasiri itself is connected with Burazjan on the Indo-European Telegraph Departments Bushehr-Shiraz line by a wire on which the intermediate stations are Ramuz Town, Behbehan Town, Dllam and Big. The only telegraph offices in 'Arabistan are those at Nasiri and the towns of Muhammareli, SMshtar, Dizful and Ramiiz. The Telegraph Masters at these places all hold the military rank of Political constitution, —The systems of internal administration in Northern and Southern 'Arabistan are explained in the articles on those sub-provinces; and the exceptional position of the Eamuz District/ which is attached to Northern 'Arabistan, is mentioned in the article under the name of the district. It remains to describe the political constitution of the 'Arabistan province as a whole. The leading political authorities are three in number, namely, the Persian Governor of 'Arabistan in Northern 'Arabistan, the Bakhtiyari Khans in the Ramuz District, and the Shaikh of Muhammarell in Southern 'Arabistan. The Persian Governor is nominally ruler of the whole province, but outside of the Northern 'Arabistan districts of Dizful and Shushtar his authority is slight or non-existent, and in the 'Aqili tract in Shushtar it is disputed by the Bakhtiyari Khans. The Shaikh of Muhammareh holds his position as Governor of Southern 'Arabistan directly from the Shah, and the Persian Governor cannot summon the Shaikh to his presence. The position of the Bakhtiyari Khans with reference to the Persian Governor is similar; at least in practice the latter would not venture to send for them. The only establishments which are general to the province are those of the Persian Foreign Office, the Persian Army, the Persian Telegraphs, the Imperial Persian Customs, the Persian Posts, the Treasury and the Land Revenue Accounts. The Foreign Office is represented by a Karguzar or Agent who has his residence at Muhammarell Town, This official is supposed to possess copies of all the treaties into which Persia has entered with # In autumn .1906, howeverj a signaller able to transmit English messages was posted to Nasiri. ^ _'ARABISTAN 149 J foreign powers^ and he is in theory the only medium of communication 2 with Foreign Consular representatives; it is his duty to try cases which may occur between Persian and foreign subjects and to piotect the interests of foreigners whose countries may be without consular representa tion in the province. In practice the functions of the Karguzar are much more restricted, for Foreign Consuls deal directly in many cases with the local administrative authority, especially with the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiyari Khans, and disputes between natives and foreigners are but seldom referred to the Karguzar for settlement. The Persian army is represented only by a skeleton garrison at Shushtar Town, at the present time probably not more than 20 men,* and by a Qurkhanehchi (or captain of ordnance) and a few artillery men under the command of a Naib at Muhammareh Town: this Muhammareh detachment is under the orders of an artillery officer at Shushtar. The Persian military arrangements in the province cannot be regarded seriously. The Telegraph Department in ''Arabistaii has been described in the paragraph above on telegraphic communications. The head of the Imperial Persian Customs in 'Arabistan is a Director General, at present a Belgian, who has his headquarters at Muhammareh Town. The establishment under his control is detailed in the Appendix on the Persian Imperial Customs. Posts and treasuries in the province are also subject to this official. Treasuries exist only at the towns of Dizful^ Shushtar and Muhammareh and their character is as yet somewhat informal: land revenue payments, not collected by the Customs, as well as customs receipts, are understood to be now deposited in these treasuries; and all official disbursements such as salaries are regularly made from the same. The accounts of land revenue for the whole province are believed to be kept and adjusted by the Persian G overnor of ^Arabistan. f For the remaining branches of administration,—such as police, justice, and revenue collection as distinguished from revenue accounts, •—the local administrative authorities are responsible; and for informa tion in regard to these the articles on Northern and Southern ^Arabistan and the Ramuz District may be consulted. ^ While the Salau-i-Mukarram was here (1906) there were several hundred — perhaps 1,000 — Persian soldiers at Shushtar. t According to a statement furnished by the Mustaufi in 1907, the total annual revenue of Northern and Southern 'Arabistan, including everything paid by the Bakhtiyari tribe, is 1 ^5,725 Tumans; but the items, given by him separately, aggregate 139,217 Tumans.150 'ARABISTAlSr FoTeign uvieresis, Foreigri interests in ^Arabistan are almost entirely British and are principally represented by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company^ by the firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and by the Persian Transport Company, all of which are closely connected with one another. The Navigation Company maintain a steamer service on the Karun between Muhaiximareh and Nasiri and also run, on behalf of the Persian Government, a steainet on the upper Karun from Ahwaz Village to the neighbourhood of Shushtar, The Nasiri-Isfahan Road was constructed and is kept in repair by Messrs. Lynch as agents of the Bakhtiyari Khans, who hold a 60 years - ' concession for its management dating from 1897. Messrs. Lynch are also the chief trading firm in 'Arabistan and the only one which maintains a European establishment* The Transport Company are holders of a 60 years^ concession, beginning in 1890, for the construction and working of a road from Nasiri via Dizful, Khurrama- bad and Burujird to Qum, with a branch from Burujird to Isfahan. The D'Arcy Oil Exploitation Company, also British, have recently commenced operations in ''Arabistan under a concession obtained by them in 1901. Various British trading and steamship companies and one of two Jewish firms of which the headquarters are in England have agents at Mnhammareli. British subjects at the present time resident in 'Arabistan number nearly 50, exclusive of Indian military consular guards; of these about 20 are Europeans and only 1 is a Hindu. The number is at present above normal in consequence of the operations of the Oil Syndicate. The only monopoly enjoyed in ^Arabistan by Europeans other than the British is one for antiquarian research, conferred on the French Government, in virtue of which the ruins of Shush have been excavated since 1897 by a French scientific mission under M. De Morgan. The principal non-British commercial concerns in 'Arabistan are the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company, who have offices at Muhammareh, and that of a Dutch merchant who is settled at Nasiri. Mepresentaiion of foreign interests, —The British Government is represented in ^Arabistan by a Consul, whose functions are almost entirely commercial, and also by a Vice-Consul whose duties are exclusively political. The Consul is a member of the British Consular Service, his headquarters are at Muhammareh, and his jurisdiction extends to the whole province ; the Vice-Consul belongs to the Indian Political Depart ment, is stationed at NasirL and is charged with all political matters'S) 'ARABISTAN (NORTHERN) 151 relating to 'Arabistan or to the country of the Bakhtiyaris and Western Lurs. The Consul is under the authority of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran only^ while the Vice-Consul receives orders from the Minister at Tehran or from the Political Resident of the Indian Govern ment at Bushehr according to the nature of the case. The only other European power represented in ^Arabistan is Russia, who has a consular agent at Nasiri in the person of the Dutch merchant already mentioned: this official is subordinate to the Russian Consul-General at Bushehr. Northern 'Arabistan is a division of the Persian province elsewhere described as a whole under the title of 'Arabistan ; it is composed of the districts of Dizful and Shushtar and includes also, in one sense, those of 'Aqili and RamuZ. The boundaries of Northern ^Arabistan may be as certained by referring to the articles on the districts mentioned; in which also the topography of the country is detailed ; and for particulars of flora and fauna, agriculture, trade, communications, political constitution, and foreign interests and representation the reader is referred to the general article on 'Arabistan. But the differences in physical geography, climate, population and internal administrative organisation between Northern and Southern ^Arabistan are so considerable as to demand separate treatment of the two divisions in these respects, and we accord ingly proceed to deal with Northern ^Arabistan under heads corresponding to these subjects. Thysicat geography, —For a few miles within the northern border the country slopes gently downwards from the foot hills of Western Luristan and the Bakhtiyari country, and the soil contains shingle ; elsewhere it is a level, rich, and stoneless alluvium. The principal exception to this general rule is a system of ranges, collectively known as Khadhar j.^, which extend for about 60 miles in a north-westerly direction from the right bank of the Karkheh a little above Kut Nahr Hashim to the left bank of the Dawairij. A very low ridge of earth-covered hills called Kuh-i-Khak vJtA sy is also deserving of mention : it begins 3 or 4 miles east of Dizful Town and, following a direction parallel to the hills of Western Luristan, reaches Jallakan on the Karun, becomes rocky, skirts the right bank of the Karun at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from it, and finally dies away in the plain a few miles to the west of Shushtar Town. An important prolongation of this 'ARAB- ISTAN (NORTH ERN)152 'ARABISTAN (NORTHERN) ridge begins oii the left bank of the Karun River some two or three miles above Shushtar Town, where it attains a height of nearly 1 ; 000 feet and bears the name of Kuh-i-Eidalak To these accidents of surface may be added the rocky ridge styled Umm-al-^Ayai which crosses the Diz River obliquely at Kut Bandar ; as seen from that point it appears to run north-west and south-east and to be nowhere more than 100 feet high. The principal rivers of Northern ^Arabistan are the upper Karkhell, the Shaur, the Diz, and a portion of the Karun including the Shatait and Gar gar branches of that river. The course of the Diz below Kut ^Abdush Shah is marked by an almost continuous belt of scrub with a sprinkling of trees, and there is some insignificant brushwood at places on the Gargar and Shatait and in the neighbourhood of Shahabad on the Dizful-Shushtar Road ; elsewhere the country is bare of natural wood. The preceding remarks apply only to the districts of Dizful and Shushtar ; the Ramuz District lies detached from the others, with which it has physically little in common, and is fully described in a separate article under its own name. The ''Aqili district also forms the subject of a distinct article. Climate and seasons, —The hot weather in Northern ^Arabistan is absolutely rainless, the cold weather as a rule moist and long; but even in winter protracted droughts may be experienced. The rains ordinarily bfegin at the end of October, the weather at the same time becoming cooler, and continue at intervals until the end of March ; in 1905-06, however, hardly any rain fell before the spring. The rainfall decreases from north to south, Dizful Town receiving more rain than Shushtar, and Shushtar again more than places to the south of it. In ordinary years, though very high temperatures are registered by day, the nights, at least in the open country, are generally cool. The climate, except where it is marred by bad sanitation as in the towns of Dizful and Shushtar, is not an unhealthy one. Population* —Northern ^Arabistan, if we exclude the Ramu^ ^ Aqili Districts of which the population is described elsewhere, is inhabited chiefly by three races : first, an indigenous breed known as Dizfulis and Shushtaris; then certain Arab tribes; thirdly, various representatives of the great Lur family of clans. The Dizfulis and Shushtaris, who are more particularly noticed in the articles upon the towns from which their names are drawn,'IRABISTAN (NORTHERN) 153 J, Ijll )Oo ^ appear to be of mixed origin^ Persian blood however predominating in their , „ veins ; the dialects spoken by both are debased forms of Persian, yet 3 ot ^ ,, differ to a certain extent; in appearance as well as in language these two p ears ^ classes somewhat resemble one another and are distinguishable from the natives of other parts of Persia. ' Earll Politically the most important of the Arab tribes are the Kathir, who he Slit settled upon the Diz and who are at present broken into two rival Sbeloij groups. Numerically the strongest of the Arabs are the Bait Sa'ad, who ■ u ^ rf! also have their headquarters upon the Diz and are intermingled, both ^ Pfci geographically and politically^ with the Kathir. The only other con- iatabali siderable Arab tribe are the A1 Khamis of the Ramuz District, eofnafc The Lurs of Northern ^Arabistan are partly Bakhtiyaris and partly Western Lurs ; regarding the distribution of both of these the articles under their names may be consulted. lasep® Of the above tribes the Dizfulis and 3bushtaris alone are never ' sukjecl nomadic ; they are not, however, confin d to the larger towns, but are found besides in many of the country villages. The Arabs, except some of the Kathir and the mixed Arabs in general of Miyanab, are still irabisl Bedouin in their habits ; but the Kathir, besides owning livestock, cul- ' Jllt tivate wheat and barley. The Lurs are mostly nomadic, except a certain orfe proportion of the Bakhtiyaris and Sagwands who occupy fixed villages. i n gi gjjjl O ' km The nomadic Bak htiyaris mostly encamp in winter between lb Bid and the Diz River, while the wandering Sagwands in the same season occupy SMi tlie C0Unt,ry to tlie west oJi I)izfGl TowI1 as far south as Shush, bnt . never cross to the east of the Diz. rs, tte' ist ill Minor tribes of Northern ^Arabistan are the Kurds, who form the ismii subject of a separate article, the Afshars and the Gundazlus. The s m: Afshars appear to be found only in Dizffil Town, where they are practically merged in the general body of Dizfulis ; and, though they now claim descent from Nadir Shah, they are possibly identical Ull! with the Afshar Turks, from whom the Ka'ab are said to have conquered Fallahiyeh, and even with the 'A ushars of the Hindiyan District. The Gundazlus , who occur at Bulaiti on the Gargar and'Arab Hasan on the Shatait, are stated to be a branch of the Turkish tribe of t oS but there is n0 evidence that th ey ever spoke Turki and their ^ present dialect appears to be Lurish.154 'ARABISTAN (NORTHERN) The following' is an estimate o£ the population and a statement of the tribes of Northern ^Arabistan^ condensed from the corresponding para graph in the general article on 'Arabistan I— District. Number of settled inhabitants. Characteristic or dominant settled tribes. Nnmber of nomadic inhabitants. Characteristic or dominant nomadic tribes. Total number of inhabitants. 'Aqill 15,000 Bakhtiya r i s, Western Lurs, Saiyids and Kangarpaz. ... 15,000 Dizftil 61,500 Dizfulis, W estern Lurs, Bakh- tiyaris and Kathir, 15,000 Bait Sa'ad and Kathir. 76,500 ( Ramuz 12,000 Ahl -i -Eamnz, A1 Khamis, East ern Lurs and Bakhtiyaris, 12,000 Shushtar 35,000 Shushtaris, Bakhtiyaris and Gundazlus. 6,000 Bait Sa'ad and Kathir. 41,000 Prom this abstract it would appear that the settled inhabitants of Northern 'Arabistan number about 123,500, and the nomadic about 21 ; 000 souls : the total population is thus approximately 144,500 souls. In this account the very large numbers of Lur and Bakhtiyari nomads who visit the district in the cold weather only are omitted, as they are temporary visitors and their numbers fluctuate. The nomads of Northern ^Arabistan are avowedly predatory, and the game tendency, partly mitigated by civilisation, manifests itself among the settled population in the shape of grasping avarice* The people treat foreigners tolerably well, but only in expectation of rewards which shall be adequate according to their own exorbitant standards. The town popula tions are quarrelsome and turbulent, especially at Shushtar ; but it is probable that under an efficient Government they would, after the removal o£ their self-constituted leaders, subside into a litigious orderliness. Shfism is almost the only form of Islam here current, and in the towns It is of an extreme type in consequence of the numbers and influence of the local religious leaders. Customs vary from tribe to tribe, and the only observances common to all are those founded on religion, such as the Muharram and Rozehkhwani. The weapons chiefly in use are rifles-—almost entirely trade Martinis of English make—and long, rather heavy sticks carried by Arabs and'ARABISTAN (NORTHERN) 155 Lurs who cannot afford to buy rifles. Rifles are still scarce among- the Bakhtiyaris, and there are not many in Miyanab ; but the townsmen of Shushtar possess several hundreds. Cartridges are all of the solid- drawn brass pattern and are repeatedly recapped and reloaded by the owners or by tradesmen in the towns. Swords and daggers are rare. In the Dizful District the villages are usually fortified against sudden attack^ but the towers are inferior to the solidly built Burjs of the North- Westem Frontier of India. General internal administrations —The province of Northern 'Arabis^ tan is ruled by a Governor who is appointed by the central government at Tehran \ he is generally (from the situation of his headquarters) des cribed as Governor of Shushtar, but his proper official style is Hukmran- i-'Arabistan The position of this individual in regard to Southern ^Arabistan is defined in the article on that division of the province. The Ramuz District^ though its revenue is paid into the Shushtar treasury, is ruled in all respects by the Bakhtiyari chiefs who hold it in farm; its administration is described in the article under its name, and the remarks which follow here do not apply to it. The posi tion of the 'Aqili tract ; attached to the Shuslitar District, is likewise somewhat ambiguous. Until recently the telegraph masters at Dizful and Shushtar were Deputy-Governors, each with the title of Naib-al-Hukumat, of the districts of which those towns are capitals) but these appointments have been abolished since the advent of the present Governor, the Salar-i- Mukarram, in 1905. The Governor is now represented by a special agent at Dizful, and when he leaves Shushtar upon tour a temporary agent is appointed at that place also. In the former regime the chief object of the Governor was to secure the goodwill of a few influential personages whose assistance might enable him to make a living, and normally the power which a Governor possessed did not extend to any distance from the towns of Dizful and Shushtar, while even within the walls of those places it was subject to the competition of the Mujtahid^ whose wishes carry immense weight with the populace. Outside the two principal towns matters were entirely controlled by the chiefs of the Kathir Arabs and the Bakhtiyari and Sagwand Lurs. To the state of matters thus outlined there will always be a tendency to revert; but for the presentISs 'AEABISTAN (NORTHERN) there is a partial improvement due to the personality of the new and vigorous Governor.* Police and justice. —There are still no regular police in Northern ^Arabistan and arrests are made by the orderlies or Farrashs of the Governor. Similarly there are no criminal or civil courts^ but justice—or a travesty of it—is administered in the towns by the religious leaders, and in the country is dispensed by the local chiefs in their own jurisdictions.t Bevenue.—l^Q collection of revenue, in so far as revenue is realisable, takes place through Mustaufis^ of whom there are two, one for the SMshtar and one for the Dizftil District; these officials are strictly accountants and removable annually, but in practice they are more or less permanent collectors and farmers of the revenue with authority to sublet the demand in portions. Revenue defaulters are reported to the Gover nor, who takes such action against them as he finds convenient. In the country the revenue consists of taxes on produce, not on land; in the towns it takes the shape of taxes on industries and taxes on shops; in each tract or area it is imposed as a lump sum, which appears to have been arbitrarily fixed at some time in the past, and it is subdivided and apportioned by local arrangement. The revenue proper is collected in cash, but in the Dizful District there is a surtax ^hich is exigible in grain. In the Dizful District the annual demand amounts to 26,000 Tumans,J and in the Shushtar District it is ^0,000 Tumans ; but in the latter district, at least until lately, not so much as half the nominal amount was actually recovered; the figures given include the urban as well as the rural assessments, also miscellaneous taxes on mills, indigo works, rafts, etc. In the Dizful District there is, in addition to the foregoing, an impost in kind of 600 Kharvars of wheat and 600 Kharvars of barley. Of the total annual revenue for the two districts, of 46,000 Tumans, no less than 4,725 Tumans is payable by the Kathir tribe, who are partly under Dizful and partly under Shushtar. More detailed in- * The Salar-i-Mukarram, while he has not broken with the Mujtabids, does not allow them to dictate to him, and he has completely subjugated the towns of Dizfiil and Slmshtar. Naturally he has not been able to effect so much in regard to the Arab and Lur tribes in the open country, but with them also he has made some progress. He maintains a sort of Border Police composed of Bakhtiyaris and Sag wand Lurs. f The Salar-i-Mukarram, who has the defects of his qualities, has now taken the administration of justice in the towns into his own hands and is energetically exploiting it as a source of private income (1906). J A recent report (1907) gives the assessment of Dizful (town and villages) as 19,577 TumaDS in cash, 1A50 Kharvars of grain, and 700 Kharvars of straw. wm hhbbbbhi'ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN) 157 formation regarding urban revenue will be found in the article on Shushtar Town. The annual revenue of tlie Ramuz District is IS^OOO Tumans or less 9 and of ^Aqili 12^150 Tumans. Miscellaneous departments. —The Imperial Persian Customs have posts; each under the superintendence of a native Mudir who is locally called Rais Gumrukat, in the towns of Dizful and Shushtar; these are under the orders of the Director-General of ^Arabistan Customs^ whose seat is at Muhammareh. At each of the towns mentioned there are also a post office and a treasury both of which are now—as elsewhere through out Persia — in charge of the Imperial Persian Customs; from the latter are disbursed all the salaries and pensions which are payable locally. Southern 'Arabistan forms part of the Persian province of 'Arabistan, to which a separate article in this Gazetteer is devoted^ and greatly exceeds in extent the remainder to which the name of Northern 'Arabistan has been given. The botany, zoology, agriculture, trade and communi cations of the country as a whole are discussed in the general article on 'Arabistan, as are also the general political position and foreign relations and interests ; here it is only necessary to refer to the boundaries by which Southern ^Arabistan is defined, and to give some account of its physical features, climate, inhabitants and government—the respects in which, chiefly, it differs from Northern 'Arabistan. 'ARAB ISTAN (SOUTH ERN) Boundaries and divisions, —On the north, Southern ^Arabistan includes the village of Band-i-Qir, which is situated in Miyanab in the angle between the Gargar and the Shatait streams at their confluence ; and from that neighbourhood its border runs westwards in such a manner as to take in the territories of the 'Anafijeh tribe upon the lower Diz, and the town of Hawizeh together with the marshy district surrounding it. On the West, the limit of Southern 'Arabistan is the undemarcated frontier between Persia and Turkey which becomes definite only at the place where it reaches the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab at the larger Khaiyain creek opposite to the Turkish island of Shamshainiyall; from this point to the Persian Gulf the frontier, as fixed by the Treaty of Erzeroum in 1847, is the Shatt-al-'Arab. The whole southern boundary of the sub-province ; from the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab eastwards as far as a point between Shah Abul Shah and Dllam, is supplied by the waters of the Persian Gulf. The eastern limit is unfixed, but corresponds approximately with an imaginary curved line drawn from the extremity, upon the coast, of Southern 'Arabistan to the intersection of the 50th158 MRABISTAN (SOUTHERN) meridian of east longitude with the 31st parallel of north latitude; another imaginary line drawn from this intersection to the point immediately north of Band-i-Qir, from which we started, completes the perimeter. The actual point where the boundary crosses the Gargar seems to be immediately below the village of Naghaishi, which is 8 miles up stream from Band-i-Qir. In a few cases the course of the boundary is explained with greater precision in the articles on the component districts. The regular districts included in Southern ' Arabistan are Ahwaz, Fallahiyeh, Hawizeh, Hindiyan, Jarrahi and Muhammareh, all of which are separately described under their own names ; and the village of Ma'shur with its few square miles of dependent territory may, as not forming part of any of the others, be reckoned a separate district. Physical geography. —The natural divisions of Southern 'Arabistan are nearly identical with the administrative districts specified in the last paragraph, each of which has a physical character peculiar to itself. The main features are the Karim, Jarrahi, Hindiyan and Karkheh rivers; and the articles under these names, and under the names of the adminis trative districts, contain the bulk of the information available regarding the nature of the country. Southern''Arabistan consists, as a whole/ of open alluvial plains which in some places are barren or thinly sprinkled with desert scrub, but in others are grassy and in spring diversified with patches of wheat and barley. In the Fallahiyeh and Ma'shur tracts there are, however, con siderable swamps and saline tracts ; and of such the south-eastern part of Ahwaz District also is not altogether free, while the neighbourhood of Hawizeh is entirely a marsh. Belts of tamarisk, willow and other bushes fringe the banks of the rivers, but as a rule there are no large trees j in the valley of the Hindiyan River, however, are scattered Kunar trees of considerable size ; and dense plantations of dates clothe the lower course of the JarraM River and its canals, the upper part of the Bahmanshir, the banks of the Karun from Qisbeh downwards, and the Persian shore of the Shatt-al -'Arab. The generally level surface of the sub-province is broken chiefly in the Hindiyan District, in the east and north of which there is a considerable hilly tract, and in the Ahwaz District by the Kuh-i-Ahwaz. This last is a range running in a west-north-westerly and east-south-easterly direction'ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN) 159 do 1 ,ll!! which is pierced by the Karun River at Ahwaz Village : the hills are of red tertiary sandstone^ oblique in stratification and jagged in outline, and ^ they rise to a height of 200 feet above the plain. It is believed that the SeeBlb entire length of the Ahwaz range is about 30 miles' and that the Karun ' ^ divides it into two almost equal parts : the portion to the east of the Karun is interrupted, however^ at 5 miles from the river by a gap or co ^i( Thinly eh and the part east of this gap is distinguished by the name of Jabal Musarbeh.* Another group of hills in the Ahwaz District, known are ^ as Banneh, is perhaps an isolated continuation of the Kuh-i-Ahwaz—or rather of Jabal Musarbeh—but is separated from the latter by an inter- A val of at least 10 miles ; and it is possible that the low hills through which ntorjn the Jarrahi River breaks between theRamuz and Jarrahi Districts are lasp a sort of link between the hills of the Ahwaz and those of the Hindiyan District, lis J Climate and seasons.—The temperature at Muhammareh Town ii ranges, in the course of the year, from 32° to 115° F. on shore, and from ; 27° to 120° F.—the last under double awnings—on board ship. The f usual daily range of temperature on shore in July is from 85° to 110° F., and in January from 40° to 57°. In January 1906 the temperature in the open near Muhammareh is said to have dropped on one occasion to 34° F. Rain may fall at any time between the middle of October and the middle of May, but the principal rains generally occur at the end of December or in J anuary, and heavy local showers are usual about the time of the vernal equinox. The total annual rainfall is, however, insignifi cant. About the middle of May a dry north-west wind generally blows for 10 days and is followed by a calm of similar duration before the setting in of the Barih or great north-wester, which lasts for about 40 days. After the Barih come, as a rule, 10 days of light southerly breezes; and thereafter hot winds from the north-west and damp winds from the south east blow alternately till the end of August. jj ! The summer heat in the plains of Southern ^Arabistan is intense, but ^ (except in the marshes) dry and not unhealthy; and from the middle of October to the end of April the climate is pleasant. Such is the ordinary, ial ^ nvar i a hle, course of the seasons. [eri * Properly speaking the part of the range to the west of the river is not ' Kiih-i- Ahwaz.' It seems to be sometimes called Manyur (but see article Hawizeh District).160 'ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN) Inhabit following is an estimate of tlie population and a statement of the tribes of Southern 'Arabistan, condensed from the corre sponding paragraph in the general article on 'Arabist^H I—* District.

The great dominant tribes of Southern ^ Arabistan are the Muhaisin and the Ka'ab— the former politically, the latter numerically: of these the Muhaisin with their centre at Muhammarell Town should certainly, and the Ka'ab whose focus is FallaMyeh Town should probably, be regarded as settled. The only other sedentary tribe of importance is the Qanawati in the Hindiyan District and at Ma'shur. The principal'ARABISTAN (SOUTHERN) 161 tl011 ^ nomad tribes are the Bani Turuf, Bani Saleh and Bani Tamim (II) all l ^ ec(: of the Haw izeh District, and the Bawiyeh who are almost confined to the district of Ahwaz : of less importance, but yet substantial nomad tribes, are the Hamaid between the Ahwaz District and the Bakhti- ^ yari hills, the Ikrish on the border of the Ahwaz and Hawizeh ^ Districts, the 'Anafijell at the frontier between Aliwaz and Dizful^ the ^ Al KhamiS (semi-settled) in the Ramuz District, and the Hardan in ' the district of Ahwaz. The institutions and characters of these tribes are dealt with from a general point of view in the article on ^Arabistan and detailed information will be found in the separate articles upon particular tribes. In religion all are Shfahs. The fighting strength of Southern 'Arabistan was calculated in 1902 at 54,500 men ; this estimate was founded partly on the tribal I books, but it is in remarkable accord with the figure given above for total population, which was obtained by entirely different methods. The principal arm of the fighting man is here the Martini carbine; of these there are at least 20,u00, and probably more, within the limits of the sub-province, and cartridges for the same are refilled locally with native powder. Percussion guns, generally fow T ling-pieces, are also used. In the neighbourhood of Muhammareh Town arms are not generally f carried by private persons except on journeys. General internal administration.—^^ whole of Southern 'Arabistan is governed by the hereditary Muhaisin Shaikh of Muhammareh*— now Khaz^al Khan, Sardar Arfa', Mu'izz-as-Saltaneh jbp* —who bears the title of Governor of the Shatt-al-'Arab and Karun, and also of Sarhadd-dar ) or Warden of the 1 Marches. The rule of the present Shaikh is personal and extremely stringent, but, while his severity inspires awe, his justice commands respect, and tribal opinion is fully consulted by him through tribal coun- tbitaife cils. He has two principal advisers or ministers: the first is Haji idle i Muhammad ^Ali, a Persian merchant of Behbehani family, but settled at j Muliaminarell, whom he utilises in his affairs generally and in negotia tions with the Persian Government or with communities and persons not 0 y other is Mirza Hamzah, an Arab of Hillah, who generally .•ofI res ^ es Basrah but is entrusted by the Shaikh with much of his Arab Jcerti * Trie poetical position and extent of jurisdiction cf the Shaikh are explained by yk Ma 3 or ^ ^irton and Captain Lorimer in the proceedings of the Govemmpnt of India (Political) for June 1904, January 1905, and August 1^05.

The relations of the Shaikh and liis two advisers among them selves are not well understood^ and it is doubtful to which of the three the ability and determination that have distinguished the present Shaikh's policy since his accession should in the main he ascribed. The following table explains the connection of the Shaikh with the various districts for the government of which he is responsible : — District. Annual amomt payable by the shainh as farm.

The incompleteness of the table is due to the difficulty of obtainino- reliable information locally in matters of the kind * It should be added that the Shaikh has a joint interest with the Bakhtiyari Khans in part of the Bellbehan sub-province, which is outside the limits of 'Arabistau and that he maintains an agent at Cham Zaidan to watch his interests in that quarter. The Shaikh, it may be mentioned, is a trader on a large scale in dates and grain and keeps his own accounts. He also owns large properties on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-'Arab and has a large private income which he uses to strengthen his administrative position and push his political interests. In describing the relations of the Shaikh with the districts under his charge no mention has yet been made of the local chiefs through whom, and not through the special agents, the work of executive Government is carried on. These headmen, generally called Qilids or Qilaits are the real medium of communication with the people : the most important of the class are two Shaikhs of the Ka'ab through whom the Fallalliyeh District is managed. The Qilids are as a rule appointed by the Shaikh of Muhammareh from the family in each tribe in which the post is heredi tary, and by him also they may be removed; such appointments and removals, however, are not usually made without consultation of other headmen. The Shaikh of Muhammareb seldom or never goes on tour in sa * ^ eo £ ' r , d!n S a ro«ent report, hasod on information roppli-d by the Mnsfemfi, the Shaikh of Muhammareh pays 71, 670 To,nana a year for the Ahwaz, Fallalliyeh, awizeh, Hindiyan Jarrahi, Ma'shur and Muhammareh distiicts (It07), u. %164 'AEABISTAN (SOUTHERN) the districts^ but in winter he frequently camps at Muzaffari or some other place on the Karun in order to attend to the atfoirs of the Bawxyeh and Bani Turuf tribes. Military forces— Besides the whole force of tribal levies which is at Ms disposal, the Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains a corps of Makram and Arab mercenaries, called Baluch-i-Shah , which is about 400 strong and furnishes g-uards for Muhammareh Town, the customs houses, and the Shaikhs own residences at Failiyeh and elsewhere. The expenditure on this corps is chargeable to the Persian Government and is adjusted by means of deductions from the annual revenue which is pay able by the Shaikh into the Persian Treasury. In addition to the tribal levies and the Baluch-i-Shah, there is a sort of militia in character intermediate between the two others, of uncertain strength, and known as the Ghulams ^ : it consists partly of the Shaikhs Mamluks who are either negro slaves or half-caste or cs white [i.e. Arab) serfs from the neighbourhood of Basrah—and partly of villagers on whose services the Shaikh has some special claim : the peasant Ghulams are paid by assignments of dates from the Shaikh^s share of the crop and receive them regularly whether they are employed or not. The only militaiy details under the direct control of the Persian Government in Southern 'Arabistan are a Naib or lieutenant and a few men of the Persian Artilleiy and a Qurkhanehchi or captain in the Ordnance Department; these are stationed at Mail am mar eh Town and receive their orders from the officer commanding the artillery in the 'Arabistan province. Police and justice.— There is no separate police force, and crime is dealt with by the Shaikh through the civil and military agencies already described above. The official at Mnhammareh Town known as the Naib-al-Hukumeh is, however, virtually a head of police. The criminal procedure is generally severe. Persons accused of theft, especially if they belong to the town population, are often beaten to make them confess; and in serious cases, such as piracy, the Shaikh seldom requires witnesses but proceeds upon information obtained by means best known to himself. In civil cases affecting tribesmen only tribal custom is followed, and that to the exclusion of ecclesiastical law ; such suits are decided by oaths which no tribesman can tak^ falsely, as to do so would be treason to the tribe. Commercial cases are settled by the Shaikh's Persian adviser, Haji Muhammad &gt; A j already mentioned, whom the Persian Government have recognised as Kais-ut-Tujjar or official head of the mercantile community.J ABAQI 165 Hevenue. —The rates and character of agricultural and other taxation \Sivy from one part of the sub- province to another. They are described in the separate articles upon the component districts. Small Mahailahs ascending the Karun pay a to 1 ! of 2 Qrans in the Haffar reach and an additional ^ Qrans on arrival at K asiri ; in the case of large Mahailahs these rates are doubled. Every Mahailah plying on the river is required to bring down gratis, twice in the year, a load of firewood for the Shaikh of Mnhammareh. Miscellaneous departwents&gt;—K^xi from Telegraphs, which are noticed in the general article on 'Arabistan, the principal departments are Customs ; Posts and Treasuries : of these the management is at present combined in the hands of a Belgian Director-General of Customs in 'Arabistan. This official is nominally subordinate—except in departmental matters—to the Shaikh of Mllhammareh and enjoys his support, which has been pur chased by concessions on the part of the Persian Government: without the co-operation of the shaikh the Customs officials would be helpless. Custom houses exist at Muhammareh Town, Nasiri, Buziyeh, Ma'shur and Hindiyan Village, and post offices at these places and at Fallahiyeh Town* The only treasury in the sub-province is at Mllhammareh Town. The position of the Karguzar or representative of the Persian Foreign Office at Muhammarell Town is explained in the general article on J Arabistan. An old disused name for the whole of Muharraq Island in Bahrain; 'AEAD it is now applied only to one of the villages which are described in the table in the article on Muharraq Island. A village in the Dhaliirali District of the ; 0inan Sultanate, situated ^RAQI in a plain on the right bank of Wadi Sanaisal about 3 miles above 'Ibri and between Ghabbi and Bait al-'Ainain, both of which it adjoins. The place consists of about 100 houses of 'Abri} in, 90 of Bani Rashid, and 35 of Balucllis : it derives its importance from the existence of a fort which came into the possession of the Sultan of 'Oman in 1904 and constitutes his only foot-hold in the district of Dhahirah. A Wali besides at ^Araqi on the part of the Sultan and about $100 is collected166 'ARAQI annually as Zakat and locally expended. There are about 150 camels, 20 horses, 200 donkeysj 300 cattle, 500 sheep and goats and 3,000 date palms. The central and from every point of view the most important district of tlie Wahhabi dominions^ of which the capital, Riyadh, is situated within its borders. Boundaries and extent. —''Aridh reaches westwards from the DaMnah desert to the principal range of Jabal Tuwaiq and even to some distance beyond it; on the north it is separated from the district of Sadair by a hollow called ^Ajsh l A f * y and on the south from the districts of Hautah and Hariq by the mountainous mass of Jabal 'Alaiyah. The only data for determining the dimensions of the ' Aridh district are those dcducihle from the information about routes which is contained in the articles on Eajd and Dhmmah and from the facts that are known about Wadi Hanifah. From these it would appear that the district, to neg lect a portion on the north-east which lies outside the Tuwalq system and should not perhaps bereck -nedto ; Aridh, measures about 80 miles from north to south aud the same from east to west. Physical features and geographical divisions physical confor mation of the district is by no means simple. The chief range of Jabal Tuwaiq traverses it, as we hive seen, from north to south towards its western end and may be used as a base from which to describe the dis- -rict. A subsidiary range belonging to the Tuwaiq system leaves the principal ran^e in the Sadair district and, gradually inclinmg away from it m a south-easterly direction, ends somewhere between Riyadh aud the Dahanah desert/ Pan of ^Aridh, that which was left out of account in estimating the extent of the district, lies to the north-east of this subsi diary range on the side towards the Dahclnah; and another portion^ containing numerous villages, is included between the lesser and the greater range. Towards the south end of the district Wadi Hanifah takes its rise in the eastern slopes of the msdn Tuwaiq range and* travelling eastwards with a southerly inclination, leaves ''Aridh by the swxh-ear tern comer. Stiil further south, but on the western side of Jabal 'AEJDH DISTRICT'ARIDH DISTRICT 167 eameli Tnwaiq, is the plain of Dhrumah from wliich a valley descends easT&gt; wards^ piercing Jabal Tuwaiq on its way, to join Wadi Hanifah in its lower course. Between Wadi Hanifah and Dhrumah; Jabal Tuwaiq appears to extend considerably further eastwards than it does in the north. The recognised geographical divisions of the ; Aridh District are not, unfortunately, altogether determiued ley the physical features—in them selves sufficiently perplexing—which have just been described. It has been possible to describe th^ southern parts of the district under the titles b Slt11 Wadi Hailifah and Dhrumah without in any way violating native usage j but it is more difficalt to know how to deal with the remainder to the north of Wadi Hanifah which consists of two hill ranges, inclined e Dalai towards one another at their northern ends, and of three plains, one of me fa which is between the ranges while the others lie outside them on the Waill extreme east and extreme west. The plain on the extreme east is named ' Urmah . It is bounded ^ ^ on the south-west by the subsidiary range already mentioned, ictareli an( i 01jL the north-east by the Dahanah desert; its breadth between the two is 1| days' journey with laden camels or about 45 miles. On the nownal north ^tlrmah is said to reach to a locality called Batainiyat obiokj •icUoi and it extends far enough south and east to include the wells of Abu J if an ra W on the route between Hofuf and Eiyadh. A dry water-course^ it 80ffi commencing in the subsidiary range and named Thamamah &lt; u U j , intersects the plain from south-west to north-east and is eventually lost in the DahSnah desert; to the south of it, in a parallel dry torrent bed, are two ileal coi groups of wells called Rumah ^ and Etimhiyah ^j, of which the latter is about 8 miles nearer to the source of the torrent than the former, iowaii In the neighbourhood of these wells is a customary halting place on the Ibefci route from Kuwait to Riyadh; Riyadh lies about 70 miles or two long leaves ti camel marches to the south-south-west of Rumah) and on the way a wajh thither the village of Banban is either passed through or left some Jiaudl distance to the right. Also to the south of Thamamah another torrent bed accDimS 1 Called Misajidi which has its rise in the same hills, crosses ibis ^ pl™ in a similar direction and is also lost in the Dahanah. e[ . poitiii The plain of ; lJrmah is itself stony and barren and broken up into low graoii hillocks, some of which are flat and some conical, with intervening hollows. angesi The remainder of the district, consisting of the principal chain of (Jjjiytl Jabal Tuwaiq north of Wadi Hanifah together with the plains on the eofji east and west of it, is sometimes included in the term Mahmal to[gg 'ARIDH DISTRICT* U k'' 1 L^ 1 1# ^ ijgsfali )es frc 01 ssiioir ca 'ijalnali iilisfixp 1 which however certain authorities would assign a much more restricted meaning. The village topography o£ Mi»hmal will be found in a table at the end of this article ; at present we are only concerned with its more outstanding physical features. The true centre of Mahmal is a large depression named Khafs ^ . in which rain water is said to collect and stagnate for as ranch as a year together ; it lies between the main range of Tuwaiq and the subsidiary range, and it is fed by the drainage, after rain, of valleys coming down from both. The southernmost and most important of the valleys on the western side of Khafs is Wadi Wutar which comes down from Sidus ; at Salbukh, perhaps 30 miles below that place, it receives on its left bank a tributary coming down from Qasr Harqan and Ghiyanah ; and before reaching Khafs it is joined, again on the left., by the Abu Kithadah sjliC torrent bed of which the head is Lffi near Haraimlah, whde Malham is situated on its middle course. Wadi (4 Wutar is a deepish, well-defined valley, and between Sidus and Salbukh it j cuts through a mass o£ hills : in its lower course it contains, at least at times, a certain quantity of running water. North of Wadi Wutar ^4 another hollow carrying the drainage of Dqalah, Diqad and Mahnqah ^ finds its way to Khafs. The outlying part of Tuwaiq on the east side of Khafs appears to overlook the Khafs basin from a short distance and to send down to it no less than 6 hollows of which the names, in order from north to south, are Khanasar , Hifnat-at-Tairi ^kll Ol Tauqi ; Hamamah , Hamaiyim and Thamamah ; of these the last named has its origin in the same part of the range as the torrent similarly named which goes down to the 'Urmah plain upon the opposite side. This eastern range of Tuwaiq rises less than 1,000 feet above ; Urmah ; and it is pierced by a remark able gap, through which runs the route between Kuwait and Sidus. iiL ® wage a lidiiili 11 appear Waaifi ill Tan Hese, li Hail, Somewhat further north than Khafs and the drainage hollows connected with it is a depression, on which are situated the three villages of Safurrah and further down the hamlet of Hasi ; its course is at first north and ihen north-east and it ends a short distance to the east of Hasi at a bill named Khatilah , whicli is described as standing solitary ^ in the desert lik« a ship at sea. This hill is said to be about the same height as Jabal Sanam near Safwan, and on the east side (»f it are wells, 4 fathoms deep, known as Qulban-al-Khatilah HjWl ^Uli. Beyond this hollow of Safurrah and Hasi, but raiher perhaps to the West than to the north of it, are two others which convey the drainage are ^Weyer coi ktiie l-UM' H 3 ^1 to coif ia mala) ke draina^ rnniost aii; iWadiflj •iown fe, s joineil,a (i which tW IS itains, att )f Wadi 1 nl and Mi [ on the d ort distarn ! names, i Fairi 'ARIDH DISTRICT 169 of Bir and Thadiq away in a direction which has not been exactly ascertained but is probably northerly. Another interesting feature of Mahmal that calls for notice is a depression furrowing the plateau (apparently styled Sad-hah between Sidus and 'Ayainah on Wadi Hanifah; this hollow is named w Ghallah 3JU, it begins a mile or two from Sidus^ and it eventuaHy enters Wadi Hanifah just above the village of Jabailah. At about 10 miles from Sidus Ghallah is blocked by a masonry dam forming a reservoir called Haqar which is close to the road from Sidus to ^Ayainah upon its north-east side; when this reservoir is filled by rain it is expected that a spring at ^Ayainah, called ^Ayainat Bin-Mu , - ammar j**-* ^ will begin to flow. Part of the rest of the country between Wadi Wutar and Wadi Hanifah drains to Banban and not to Khafs. It remains to mention that, on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq, a hollow descending from the neighbourhood of Haraimlah passes Barrah and ends in the swamp of Mufidh in the Washam district; while another, also from the direction of Haraimlah, runs down to Washam by way of Rghabah. The western Haisiyah, which is to the south of the valleys just mentioned, is described in the article on Jabal Tllwaiq. me part Inhabitants.—The 'Urmah subdivision of the 'Aridh district contains no settled inhabitants : from a consideration of the appropriate articles it will appear that the fixed population of Mahmal is about 1^500, of ntotbe l Wadi Hanifah (inclusive of Riyadh) about 15,000, and of Dhrumah TaWJl! an( } i ts dependencies about 2,500 souls, mating up a non-Bedouin total dbnt- for'Aridh of some :-i0,000 persons. In the whole district, Riyadh Kuwait fc own being left out of consideration, the predominant tribe of respect able lineage appear to be the Dawasir, with about 3,600 souls, who are particularly strong in Mahmal j they are followed by the Sabai ' and ainage» the Bani Tamim with about 2,600 persons each, and by the 'Anizah ette' and 'Ataibah, whose numbers are ahut 2,000 and 1,000, respectively; lonrseirf after these come the Fadhul and Qahtan, and after these again the Bani Hajir, Sahul, Mutair, Aid, Harb and Bani Khalid whose ading® 111 numbers are exiremely small. More numerous than any single Arab bout tk' tribe, however, are she low caste cultivators, generally grouped'together t A f UIlder the common designation of Bani Khadhir, who appear in 1 jUUU this district to number nearly 6,000 persons.

Agriculture and resources* —The character of agriculture in ^Aridli will be understood on reference to the village lists of its various divisions, from which it will be seen that the people depend chiefly on the cultiva tion of dates, wheat, barley, millet, melons and lucerne, all of which are grown for the most part by irrigation from wells. There are also, in most places, fruit trees of the various sorts met with in Wajdj especially citrons, limes, pomegranates, figs and vines; vegetables also are raised in considerable variety. A large part of the district consists of pastoral uplands or downs, and the ordinary livestock of Najd are owned, in the usual proportions, by most villages. The flocks and herds graze on the lower levels in winter and the hill grass is reserved for consumption in summer and autumn* Communications. —The routes which traverse the 'Aridh District are described in the article on Najd. Administration. —The political importance of the district is proved by the fact that, despite political convulsions and foreign wars, one of its towns has always remained the capital of the Wahhabi dominions. The revenue of 'Aridh, then mostly collected in kind^ was valued in 1865 at $50,000; at the present time the revenue from dates is estimated at $12,000 and that from cereals at $4,000 only. The decrease is said to be due to the damage done by both sides during the recent wars in Najd* Topography. —The villages of Wadi Hanifah and of the Dhrumah neighbourhood are tabulated in the separate articles on those subdivisions of the district: those of the remaining Mahmal tract are as follow ♦— Name.

There is an anchorage, in 4 or 5 fathoms, to the east of the southern tip of the island : no fresh water is obtainable. Some pearl banks exist in the vicinity of Arzanah, of which we may here mention Sutuh Arzanah, a large group extending eastwards towards Zirko Island; Batm Arzanah, 16 miles to the east-, south-east; and Maiyanah, 4 miles to the south. .te plairt imm: a'Z 0ne of the Skibkuh ports of the Persian Coast j it is situated 22 'ASALU miles south-east of Tahiri and 4 miles north of Naband at the north ; entrance point of Naband bay.

Its boundaries are further defined by the Gharaimil hill on its east side, by the Qarat-ar-Eukban hill at its south-east corner where it meets the oasis of Hasa, by the Ghar-ash- Shuyukh hill at its south-western extremity, and by the Baraim hill on its western border towards the north end. Badd-al-Asis is described as a plain of sand interspersed with undulating rocky ground; the sand is reddish and the rocks are dark-brown in colour. Grazing consists of Thamam grass and of ^Arfaj and Rimth bushes, of which the last is particularly favoured by camels. The only well in Badd-al-Asis is Shatqam about 5 miles north-west of Qarat-ar-Rukban, which is 2 fathoms deep and contains good water. It should be noted that according to some authorities the district described is mostly a part of Ghuwar, and that Badd-al-Asis is merely the name of a track leading across Ghuwar in the direction of Taff and Wadi-al -Miyah.'ATAIBAH 179 A valley in the Shibkuh District of Persia, in the article on which its e ■ position and course are fully described.

A great part of the noted' rou ^ es from ^Anaizah and Buraidah to Makkah lies in their, territory ya^ ai1 ^ Q-asimi caravans travelling by those lines are accustomed to enlist clilesl of the ^Ataibah. Their camps are seen especially at Dbariyah, Dukhnah, Miskah and Shibirmah. On the north their limit is at Wadi-ar- K 2180 'ATAIBAH Rnmmah^ and they are found as far east as tlie Qatan liill in tliat valley, and as Wadi-as-Sirr and W a sham f'they are also among'the Bedouins who frequent the district of Kharj, they are sometimes seen in Aridh, and a few poor ^Ataibah occasionally visit Kuwait; in search of a livelihood. Ihe op p osite direction they are known to encamp at Huwaiyah in Wadi Sabai'. The Dirah proper of the 'Ataibah : consists of sandy or gravelly plains^ sprinkled with isolated bergs .of granite and basalt, but containing excellent desert pasture. Life ciud subsist majority of the tribe are nomads wander ing dispersed through their vast domains ; but the 5 Ataibah have also some fixed villages, with palm groves, in the hills 10 0 miles to the north of Makkab, and colonies of settled 'Ataibah exist at different places in Eajd, especially in Middle Najd or Qasim. The 'Ataibah live chiefly by the camels, sheep and goats of which they own large numbers ; the wool of their flocks is short and coarse and suitable, only for making ropes and Bedouin tents. Forty years ago the 'Ataibah owned some of the best horses in Arabia, and good horses are even now said to be sold within the tribe for $200 each. The prices of camels, sheep and goats are lower among the 'Ataibah than among the Mutair; the best riding camels fetch only $60 to $70, the best baggage camels $40, .and sheep and goats $3 a bead. The ^Ataibah eke out their subsistence by raiding, especially to the north of Wadi-ar-Eummah, and by protecting pilgrims on their way to Makkah. Character, —As a tribe the 'Ataibah are honourable, hospitable, and not inclined to treachery; more stable in mind than most Bedouins; better fighters than even the redoubted Qahtan ; in religion moderate and free from fanaticism. Number and divisions, —Their total number within the limits of Central Arabia may be roughly estimated at 6,000 souls. The ^Ataibah consist of two large divisions, the Ruwaqah or Koqah and the Barqah •* The war cry of the Koqah is (i# ^ Ul and the Wasm of their chief Shaikh is a snake branded below the left eye of the camel. • The composition of the tribe as given j below from! t Kuwait information differs considerably from that attributed to it by Doughty (II, 437) on a western authority.hii 'jiife •ji 4 'ATAIBAH 183 The Barqah appear to have no general war cry, but some of the sections have distinctive war cries and also Wasms of their own. Such are the following :— Section. War cry. Wasm. 'Asumah § Half-way up the near side of the ammars neck. Daajil r ~^ Half-way up the ofE side of the animal's neck.

Ataibah have from early times paid allegiance to the Wahhabi power and in 1865 their annual contribu tion to the treasury of Riyadh was estimated at tjjl 12^000. In the civil War in Southern Najd about 1871 they sided with ^Abdullah against Sa^ud and^ assisted by the treachery of the Qahtan, defeated Sa'ud when he attempted to subdue them. Subsequently^j when the fortunes of Hail were in the ascendant; they came under the authority of the Shainmar Amir, who severely enhanced their taxation; but in 1902, on the tecovery of the Wabhabipowei^ they again became subjects of Ibn Sa'ud whose cause they always favoured and to whom they now render tribute at the rate of $1 on every 5 camels and $2 on every 10 sheep. The 'Ataibah are fairly well armed with trade rifles. Settled } Atailah* —Up to this point we have been concerned with the 'Ataibah as a tribe of nomads^ but it is necessary to observe that residents of a number of fixed villages in Najd are described as ■'Ataibah by descent. In Qasim the following villages are said to be wholly or partially possessed by 'Ataibah Qasr-bin-^Aqaiyil, Athlah, Badayah,184 'ATAIBAH Basr, Bitah, Bukairiyah, Ab-ad-Dud, ; Ain Ibn-Fahaid ; Gliaf I ; Gliammashj Haid ; Jau^i, Quwafali^ Nafi, Rass, Saib, Shaihiyah and Wuzakh, to which should perhaps be added Mudhnib. In Jabal Shammar territory Baqa'a is said to be occupied by 'Ataibah of the Sa^adah section ; and in Sadair the people of Zilfi^ and in 'Aridh those of Banban^ Barrah and Rghabah, are mentioned as being to a greater or less extent ^Ataibah. Those of Zilfi belong to sections known as Farahid and Masa^idah 'ATUB An Ar^b tribe of Turkish 'Iraq, who have their headquarters upon the Shatt-al-^Arab between Basrah Town and Muhammareh Town • in religion they are Shi' , ahs, and like all their neighbours they are addicted to robbery. Nearl} all the villages upon Ajairawiyah island towards its lower end are inhabited by 'Atub, as are also the large villages of Sangar and Sabiliyat upon the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab opposite; and the 'Atub are (with the ^Idail and the Qatarnah) the principal element of the population in the mixed villages generally of the right bank. They are also found at Sulaimaniyah on the left bank of the river below the Da'aiji creek. Outlying colonies of 'Atub are found at Kataiban and one or two other villages on the left bank of the river above Basrah Town ; also at Dorah which is a short distance above Fao. Some ''Atub also occur on the Haffar reach of the Karun who probably belong to this tribe. The principal Shaikh of the 'Atub was till lately Alag*al-Humaiyid, who lived in one of the Sulaimaniyah hamlets; but he is dead ; and his son Sultan is now in prison in connection with offences committed on the river. AUDHAN A tract in t5ie HaSa Sanjaq, forming its extreme north-eastern (ZOR AL') corner upon the sea. On the coast it extends from Jabal Manifah on the north, where it meets the Kuwait district of Sudah, to Musal- lamiyah bay which forms its southern limit. Inland it is bounded by the marshy depression known as Sabakhat-al-Mutaya . It is in fact the irregularly shaped strip cut off by a line joining Jabal Manifah to the foot of Musallamiyah bay, and its extent measured in any direction hardly exceeds 20 miles and is generally much less.'AUF (WACi BANI) 185 The principal features of the Zor-al-Audhan coast are the capes of Kas-al-Ghar /jJl &gt; Ras-al-Musainah ^1) and Eas al-Bidya^ ; of these the first is about 14 miles south-east of Jabal Manifah, the last is 8 or 9 miles further to the south and forms the northern entrance point of Musallamiyall bay ; and the second is about midway between the other two but rather nearer to Ras-al- Bidya\ Off Ras-al-Ghar is a pearl bank similarly named. m The wells of the Zor-al-Audhan tract are Ruwaqiyah on the coast halfway between Ras-al-Ghar and Ras-al-Musainah ; Bahajah in the centre of the tract; and Sudah about 3 miles inland from the north-western side of Musallamiyall bay. The water of all three is indifferent in quality. A valley in the 'OmanlSultauate, connected with Wadi Fara^ which it is said to leave in the neighbourhood of Rustaq, and subsequently reaching the sea at Sha^ibah near Masna'ah by an independent course to the east of Wadi Fara'. The villages in this valley are, apparently in descending order, the following 1 Namd. 1 Propositioii. House and inhabitant. BxHAltES. 1 Qasmitain I 1 hour from Wadi Fara.' 10 houses of Bani 'Auf.

Jab' in186 •AWABi 'AWABI A town or large village in the Western Hajar of the 'Oman Sultanate on the left bank of Wadi Bani Kharus within the hills ; it lies about 15 miles west of Nakhl and somewhat less (13 miles) to the east of Eustaq. The elevation is 1,850 feet above the sea and the settlement covers a fairly large area. There are about 300 houses in the town proper, mostly of mud and stone ; but some of them mere huts; and another 150 stand outside upon lower ground. The place is defended by a fort called Bait- aVAwabi 1 which occupies a position of natural strength commanding the approach from Nakhl. The population is about 2 ; 500 souls, belonging chiefly to the 'Abriyin (1^0 houses), Bani Kharus (70 houses), Bani Harras and Dhahul; but there are also some Siyabiym, Bani Bahri and Bani 'Auf. The bazaar contains over 50 shops kept by Arabs of the place. Every available spot in the vicinity is reclaimed for tillage, and the neat regular fields attest good husbandry. Dates, lucerne, maize, millet, wheat and barley are the principal crops; the palms are estimated at 4,000. Livestock are 100 camels, 150 donkeys, 100 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats ; the cattle are of a small hiimp-backed sort; they are not sent to graze on the coarse grass of the hills, but are stall-fed on barley, dates and lucerne. 'Awabi is a position of great natural importance dominating as it does adi Bani Kharus, up which lies the best route to Jabal Akhdhar from the north: it has been perpetually in dispute between the Bani Hiiyam and the Abriyin, but the political influence of the ^Abriyin, who number 120 households, has generally been predominant. In 1900 the 'Abriyin transferred possession of the fort from themselves to the Sultan of 'Oman who still retains it by means of a garrison of 30 men. The route called Tariq-ash- Shass leads direct from 'Awabi over Jabal Akhdhar to Wadi Tanuf in 'Oman Proper. aw A l The old name of Balirain Island, disused, but still remembered. J)y According to tradition Awal was the name of the first occupier, the brother of a certain Na^asan whose name also is supposed to survive in that of Jazirat Umm Na'asan. The name Awal occurs in the annals of the earliest Muhammadan conquest.* ^AWAMIE Singular 'Amiri A large Arab tribe of 'Oman, by race jstjyc Nizariyah, but now in politics Hinawiyah. About one-third of them are *Vide Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate*'AW AMIR 187 Bedouins ranging the borders of tlie Ruba'-al-Khali from Trucial 'Oman in the north, which they occasionally visit in small numbers, to the district of Dhufar on the southern coast of Arabia. The other two-thirds are now settled, chiefly in 'Oman Proper where they possess the villages of 'Aqil, Qal'at-al-'Awamir, Falaj, Hamaidhah, Quriyatain, Qarut, Khurmah, Shafa^, Saiyahi and Suq-al-Qadim and are found at Nizwa : they occur also at Masqat Town, Bait-al-Falaj and Ruwi in the Masqat District; at Ghallah and Sad in Wadi Boshai? ; at Hail Al 'Umair, Sib and Ma'bilah in Batinah ; at Khodh in Wadi Samail and at Khubar and Luwiz in Daghmar. In 'Oman Proper the settled ^Awamir number about 2,500 souls and are divided into the following sections: Ahmad (Aulad) ^), ^Ali-bin-Hamad (Aulad) ^ ^.Js. oSy, &gt; Ali-bin-Khalf (Aulad) ^ ty], Amir (Aulad) jS*J Haramilah &lt;^1^, Ja'afarah yU^, Ja^id (Aulad-al-) Khanajirah Muhammad Musa (Aulad) ^^1, Rakhbah Rashid (Aulad) ^1; Saba (Aulad) ^ Saif (Aulad) Salim (Aulad) Sand (Aulad) ^ ^^1, Sarahm Sarahin-al-Muwailah and Shiraz (Aulad) ; those at Nizwa are of the Aulad Saif section, and at Sib a section called Aulad Mahaiyi are found. The settled ^Awamir outside 'Oman Proper are about 4,000 persons. Their migratory habits and the slightness of their contact with civilisation renders a close estimate of the strength of the Bedouin portion impossible ; but, regard being had to the wideness of their distribution^ they may safely be assumed to be numerous and perhaps amount to 3,500 souls. The total strength of the tribe is thus probably about 10,000 souls. A term ^Afar j^, frequently used in connection with the 'Awamirj appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a particular territory, called ^Afar or Dhafrah 8^ , between Mahot and Dhufar; it includes representatives of many sections. The 'Awamir are reputed brave and warlike, but crafty, treacherous and predatory; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet, not excepting members of their own tribe with whom they happen to be unacquainted. The 'Afar are popularly supposed to feed upon carrion: they deny this, but admit that they are not infrequently reduced to devouring the animals^ skins with which some of them are clothed. The ' Awamir speak a peculiar dialect of Arabic and the language of the westernmost sections is hardly intelligible to their settled brethern in 'Oman Proper. The tribe is Ibadhi in religion ; , they are at feud^aw A mir with'the Jannabah and the Daru'. The tribal capital is ^Aqil; and the present Tamimahs are Suhail-bin-Aswad and Biban-bin-Biban. Distrihution. —Singular 5 Azimi A preponderantly Bedouin tribe now hardly found in Eastern Arabia outside the limits of the Kuwait Principality, within which they range from Kuwait Town and Jahrah on the north to the borders of the Hasa Sanjaq on the south, and from the sea on the east to the beginning of Summan on the west; some; however, exist in the neighbourhood of Qatif, where they breed horses and camels and take menial service under various Shaikhs ; and a few are settled in the fixed villages of Wadi-al-Miyah. About 250 non-nomadic families of the tribe are established in Kuwait Town, where one of the quarters is called after them ; and 25 others possess the village of Dimnah. 'Awazim or Hawazim are apparently found in various parts of Central Arabia, especially at Jauf-al-'Amir, Sakakah, Taimah and Baidha Nathil in Jabal Shammar, and at Ghat in the Sadair district of Southern Najd ; but these ''Awazim or Hawazim are possibly not identical with the Kuwait 'Awazim and may belong to the Hat aim tribe [vide article) or to the Harb.* Origin and traditions,— Shaikh of Kuwait says that the name ^Awazim means the ' segregated/ , and that they are sprung from the bastard children of a victorious Turkish army in Central Arabia, who were collected and formed into a tribe. This story appears improbable, especially as it is not supported by anything peculiar in the physical characteristics of the ^Awazim and involves the difficult supposition that the word ^Awazim was originally 'Awazil : it serves, however, to ♦ This is a difficult question which it has not been possible t o clear up at the present time, though the names 'Awazim and Hawazim could hardly, one might suppose, be confounded by Arabs. The &lt;&lt; Hawazim ,, of Wallin, the ' 'Azzamees ' of Palgrave, and the Howeysin of Lady Anne Blunt must apparently all be the same people ; and the first and the last, at any rate, resembled the 'AwSzim of the Kuwait in being of undistinguished origin. Wallin found the Hawazim living intermingled with the Shararat, despised and poor, and robbed of almost all their animals by raiding parties of the Southern Shammar. The latest reports however state that the 'Awazim, the Hawazim section of the Harb and the HawaziBl section of the Hataim are entirely distinct from and independent of one another.'AWAZIM 189 illustrate the slight esteem in wliicli the ^Awazim are held socially. The tribe themselves claim to be an offshoot of the Harb^ and say that their name means ' quick in startingand refers to a sudden tribal dispersion, of which their accounts are various and conflicting; it is generally ascribed to a difficulty with the Sharif of Makka. Some of the 'Awazim admit the descent of their tribe from a Harb foundling adopted by the Mutair. The ^Awazim appear to have immigrated into Kuwait territory about three generations ago and the island of Umm-an-Namal was granted to the Adhyaibat subdivision by the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Kuwait. Numbers and divisions. —The ^Awazim Bedouins of Kuwait are divided into two main sections, the Ktfah ^Aiyal Kuwa^ ^ JUc or Aulad Kuwai' and the ^Aiyal Ghiyadh JUr. The Ku'ah, who on account of their supposed descent from an elder brother take precedence of the ''Aiyal Ghiyadh, are subdivided into the Hadhalin Braikat and Shqufah each of which sections has a Shaikh of its own: the Braikat are not considered to be true descendants of Kuwai^. The ^Aiyal Ghiyadh are subdivided into the Mala 'ibah axclU ; Musahimah 3 Misa^idah ^ Adhyaibat oUoil , Jawasirah , Muhalibah , Muwaijiyah or Mwaiji f m , Aghrubah ^1, Karashah and Sawabir . One authority mentions a subdivision called Tuwalm , without indicating to which of the divisions it belongs. The Aghrubah and Muhalibah are so much scattered that they hardly possess a corporate existence. The ^Adhyaibat and Muwaijiyah admittedly have no Shaikhs of their own and are variously represented as being included with the Mala/ibah or the Sawabir; and the Shaikh of the Sawabir appears to be also Shaikh of the Misa/idah. The strongest subdivision are the Misa/idah, and the Hadhalin are among the weakest. The number of the Bedouin 'Awazim in Kuwait territory may amount to 4,000 souls. and resources. —The 'Awazim of Kuwait are pastoral nomads, fishermen and pearl divers, and some of them cultivate melons at Warah in the ■'Adan district. Their camels are estimated at 7,000 and their sheep and goats at 140,000, but these numbers are probably exaggerated: they have some donkeys, but no cattle and only 15 horses. Religion, social position and customs. —Vague stories are current that t he Awazim in other parts of Arabia have a strange religion of their190 'AWAZIM own; but those in Kuwait territory are now without exception Sunnis o£ the Maliki persuasion. By the Arabs the 'Awazim are regarded as an inferior tribe^ and they intermarry only among themselves and with the Rashaidah. The Mihr or price paid for wives among them was formerly only 40 Riyals, of which half was given in kind; it has now risbn to 100 and even 200 Riyals. The ; Awazim can recognise one another by their pronunciation or Nutaq. r Political position. —The tribe are at present loyal subjeets of the Sbaikb of Kuwait and, from the military point of view, the backbone of his state; the Shaikh regards them, despite their dnbions origin, as good fighting men —and with justice, for about 50 of them were killed in his invasion of Jabal Shammar in 1901, including three sons of the Shaikh of the Sawabir and several men of mark among the Jawasirah. The real head of the tribe is now the Shaikh of Kuwait, but a representative of the old tribal authority exists in Is'ud-bin-Hablb-bin-Jam'ah cr? of the Hadhalin subdivision. The J Awazim are politically allied to the 'Ajman. An important village or small town in Qasim, the most populous place between Hail and Buraidah ; it is situated about 25 miles west- north-west of Buraidah. The emplacement of 'Ayun is a large depression, some miles in extent, in a bay on the southern side of Jabal Sarah. The plantations cover a space 3 miles in length and nearly 1 mile broad, and the palms are among the best in Qasim. The groves are said to be 40 in number : some of the palms are planted in excavations in sandstone rock. On the west side of the town is a large and growing sand dune, retained by a mud wall of which the height has frequently to be increased'. Water is very abundant and though not good is drinkable ; the depth of the wells is from 5 to 6 fathoms. The people, about 2,500 souls, are said to be of Shammar descent. They are small, thin and ugly, with hollow eyes and projecting cheek-bones; they wear a red iUfiyah without an 'Aqal and are Wahhabis by religion, but they are reputed to be of a humorous disposition. 'Ayun has about 20 shops and is the market town of Ghaf, Eaudh and Wathal. Politically it is dependent on Buraidah. The rocks at the entrance of the 'Ayun depression at its north-western end bear some Himyaritic inscriptions.@ 'AZlZlTAH QADHA 191 The reputed tomb of the prophet Ezra, domed and having a row of Jewish houses attached to the precincts : it stands on the right bank of the Tigris midway between Qumah. and Qal'at Sallll about 80 miles by river from each. 'Azair is within the limits of the Tigris marshes and is included in the Qadba of Shatrat-al-'Amarah : the surrounding Arabs are of the Al Bu Muhammad tribe. There are some trees and gardens, but no village. 'AZAIR A division of the Sanjaq of Baghdad, which is a part of the Wilayat ' AZ IZIYAH 11 of the same name in Turkish 'Iraq ; it was constitued in 1884, at the ' time of separation of the Basrah Wilayat from that of Baghdad, out of OADHA 'nili, fji territory formerly included in the Qadha of I^U.t - al - A.lliai*all* reptsfi ... j iiHffl. j ' Position and boundaries. —The 'Aziziyah Qadha is situated on the j i ., left bank of the Tigris some distance below Baghdad City, and is enclosed by the Qadhas of Baghdad and Khurasan on the north-west, by that of Badrah on the north-east, by that of Kut-al-Amarah on the south-east, and by that of Jazirah on the south-west. 'Aziziyah appa rently reaches up the Tigris to the junction with that river of the Diyalah. nc-stpjjt Topography and tribes.—The Qadha contains only two villages of i milaii any importance ! of these one is 'Aziziyah, described elsewhere under gedepis its own name ; the other is Salman Pak, which is mentioned in the article Sank I 011 tlie Tigris. _ The following is an alphabetical table of the principal Mnqata ahs or tracts in ^Azxziyah and of the tribes occupying them ;— Tract, Tribe.

The principal crops are wheat and barley ; livestock include horses^ donkeys, camels, cattle and buffaloes in considerable, and sheep in large, numbers j and there are a few mules. In the Shadi tract there are extensive deposits of good white salt, said to be formed by the evaporation in the sun of water from certain brackish streams. Some 15 or 20 miles to the east of 'Aziziyall Village these deposits reach down towards the Tigris bank, and the salt is removed in boats by a contractor to whom they are leased. Wild liquorice is another asset of some value. ■■'AZlZlYAH VILLAGE 193 Administraiion.~~T\iQ Qadha of 'AzizTyali belongs to the 2nd class. 'Aziziyah Village was until recently the seat of the Qaim-Maqam^ while ofts, the only Mndir in the Qadha was located at Salman Pak and was of the j ec ^ ^ i 1st class ; now however it is reported that since 1905 Salman Pak has become the headquarters of the Qadha^ and 'Aziziyail Village (on account of its inconvenient situation and the encroachments of the river) that of a Nahiyah only. The Dairat-as-Saniyah owns the Shadi tract together tommar !■ Mamlahah or salt-field which it contains, f ^ 'n •'jllwtin ammar j Soi'jji A village in Turkish 'Iraq, on the left bank of the Tigris about 'AZIZIYAH a]a midway between Baghdad and Kut-al-Amarah; it is about 50 miles from ^ either in a direct line, but by river it is 117% miles from Baghdad and 110 miles from Kut. Prior to 1860 there was at most only a police VILLAGE station upon the site now occupied by ''Aziziyah ; but some years later the place began to develop in consequence of the acquisition of land in the tammarTji vicinity ^ tlie Dairat-as-Saniyah ; and in 1884 from being the head- eMajabilab quarters of a Nahiyah it became those of a Qadha. About this time the population of ^Aziziyah amounted to 1,000 souls, of whom three-fourths immarTof were Sunni Muhammadans and the remainder Shi'ahs with a few Jews, e a n After 1884 'Aziziyah again retrograded, partly in consequence of the inroads of the river upon the bank; and in 1905 it exchanged places administratively with Salman Pak, the latter becoming the clef-lieu of the Qadha while ''Aziziyah again descended to the status of a Nahiyah. The population of ''Aziziyah is now under 200 persons : there are about 30 small mud houses only, and half a dozen shops.

Badi' consists of two^ quarters, a northern called Batmah and a southern called Taraf, which are separated by a mile or two miles of date plantations and cultivated land. The population of Badi^ is about 3,000 souls and consists of 300 houses of the Sukhabirah and 200 of the Ishkarah (A1 Bu ^Ali) sections of the Dawasir and of 100 houses of the Bani Khadhir. Date palms are said to number 25,000 and the common fruits of Najd are grown. The other crops are wheat, barley, maize, millet, lucerne, musk melons and water melons. The wells are 5 to b fathoms deep. Horses are few among* the settled population, but other livestock are in the usual proportions.

BAGHDAD The city of Baghdad^ the capital of the Wilayat of the same name and the largest and most important place in Turkish 'Iraq, is also styled CITY*' Dar-as-Salam ;!*&gt; or the Abode of Safety and Madinat-al-Khulafa or the City of the Khalifahs; sometimes it is even men tioned by the ancient and possibly pre-Islamic name of Zauraf bi • The name Baghdad appears to be ancient Persian, meaning ' the God- given place/' Ruins of a solid brick embankment discovered on the right bank of the Tigris in 1848 prove that Baghdad, no doubt under a different name, already existed as a place of some importance in the days of Nebuchadnezzar; and (with an interval of 56 years from 836 to 892 A.D.j during which its place was taken by Samarrah) Baghdad was for about 3 centuries under the 'Abbasid Khalifahs the political capital of the whole Muhammadan world. The Muhammadan city of Baghdad, which supplanted Hashimiyah near the present Hillah, was founded by Mansur, the second of the ^Abbasid Khalifahs, in 762 A .D., »nd was originally on the right bank of the Tigris only. Although its administrative pre-eminence was somewhat impaired by the erection of the Musal and Basrah regions into independent * The best map is of Baghdad revised to 1906, numbered 1388 in Foreign Department Library, Simla. f The semi-official local newspaper is called ' Zaura/'BAGHDAD OlTY Rt , p Wilayats m 1878 and 188% and although the rapidly growing port of Basrah is thought by some to threaten its^commercial ascen dency; Baghdad is still the true capital of all Turkish 'Iraq. The civil governorship of Baghdad even now enjoys a higher prestige than that of neit Basrah; and to the 'Wali of Baghdad are still accredited the consular SiiiiJ representatives oE highest rank maintained by foreign powers in Turkish ot H Baghdad moreover remains the headquarters of the 6th Army ^ Corps of the Turkish Army; and to Baghdad also are posted the officials who superintend the working throughout Turkish 'Iraq of the depart ments; such as Customs^ which are directly controlled from Con stantinople. Again; if from the trade of Basrah be subtracted so Sl much as depends directly or indirectly upon Baghdad; the commercial subordination of Basrah to Baghdad will at once become apparent; and in matters of education and religion; likewise; Basrah occupies '' ' a merely secondary place, ouk T r ssesali Position, site and climate, —Baghdad is situated in latitude 33° 19' 7^ north and longitude 44° 25' 33 // east; it is further north than Jhelam and not so far north as Rawalpindi in the Punjab province of British India* , From Damascus it is distant 480 miles very slig^htlv to the south of he sai: . . &amp; j east; and from Basrah 283 miles in a north-westerly direction; but its Mhlt ( ^ ance ^ r; ^ vers Shatt-al -'Arab and Tigris from Basrah is 500, and from the Persian Gulf about 570 miles.

The banks of the river at Baghdad and to a consi- | derable distance both above and below the town are of good clay soil and | s ^ an( i fi rm and high ; in places beyond the walls they are bordered tk p cultivation irrigated from water-lifts ; and in others they are madan ct date plantations in which fodder crops are grown between ; Hillal f sometimes they even carry a sprinkling of natural wood; s in $' c ki e % dwarf poplar. These fertile waterside belts however are narrow, and upon the sides away from the river Baghdad is closely hemmed riat ^ ^ parched clay deserts of dreary aspect; the north-eastern desert ;o indf reaclies awa J towards the Diyalah river and the hills of the Persian frontier and is high lying and waterless; but the other; between the ted ^ Tigris and the Euphrates, is liable to be inundated by the spill of the latter river and is not altogether uncultivated. From each of198 BAGHDAD 01TY these deserts the part of Baghdad whicli it approaches is cut off hy a depressed tract surrounding the town, imperfectly protected by embank ments and liable to be flooded by the Tigris at certain seasons j when this occurs the city itself becomes, as it were, a low island crowd ed with houses and divided into two parts by the broad and rapidly flowing river. The climate of Baghdad, owing to the proximity of arid and treeless deserts, is extreme, and upon the whole dry. The summer maximum at 8 a.m . ranges from about 114° to 121° Fahrenheit, and the winter minimum from about 26° ,to 31°; but the thermometer has been known to rise to 123° and to fall to 20°. The rainy days, mostly in winter, vary from 5 to 20 per annum; the normal rainfall for the year is 9-04 inches; and the mean humidity for the whole year is about 56 per cent, of saturation. Perimeter and area. —Until the time of Mid-hat Pasha^ who was Wali now nearly 40 years ago^ Baghdad possessed a complete enceinte of earthworks and brick fortifications ; but they were dismantled by the reform ing governor, and the debris now forms an almost continuous embank ment along which runs a path or road. Except for this raised (but unfortunately shadeless) boulevard surrounding it, Baghdad is now a perfectly open town. * On the left bank of the Tigris these remains, together with the river, enclose a rough parallelogram about two miles in length and somewhat over 1 mile in average breadth. About J of this area on the side next the desert is empty or occupied only by graveyards and ruins, and towards the southern end a good deal of space is still occupied by date groves, which are however rapidly making way for houses ; the rest is covered by the main town of Baghdad. To the old fortifications belonged 4 gateways which still exist and preserve their ancient names; these are the Bab-ash-Sharqi at the present south-eastern, and the Bab-al-Mu^adhdham at the present north-western corner of this part of the town, and the Bab-at-Tilism p-wlkll wb or Talismaiiic Gate and the Bab-al-Wastani or Middle Gate in the long face towards the desert of the former fortifications, the first towards its south-eastern and the other near its north-western end. The Bab-at- Tilism, which was bricked up after the exit through it in 1639 of tlie conquering Sultan, Murad IV, has recently been converted into a military * The defensibilitjr of Baghdad is.discussed by Captain H. Smyth in his Beeon- miisance Report, 1904.BAGHDAD CITY 199 magazine : both it and the Bab-al-Wastani now stand isolated in the open at a long distance from the houses of the town. The names of a number of Tabiyahs (bastions and redoubts) which have disappeared remain attached to the mounds that mark their sites. The quarter on the right bank of the Tigris begins somewhat further upstream than the main town on the other side : but its length is not so great and its depth is a good deal less. On this side the outline of the former fortifications was more irregular and the area enclosed much less considerable; but the vacant spaces within are not now so large, proportionally, as they are in the main town. On the south side there seem to have been four gateways, the Bab-al-Karaimat v b at u&gt; the east end^ the Bab-al-Hillah near the south-eastern comer, the Bab-al-Kadhimain v 1 ^ at the north-western extremity, and the Bab Shaikh Mah'uf midway between the two last; but some of these are possibly modern. Apart from the uncompleted demolition of the fortifications, from the building over in the south-eastern quarters of the main town of lands formerly arable, and from the construction outside the Bab-al-Mu''adhdham of some military and other government buildings, Baghdad has changed but little since it was surveyed by Jones and Collingwood in 1853-54. General aspect. — The general appearance of Baghdad, seen from the top of a high building such as the Roman Catholic Church, is flat and monotonous. The narrow and crooked streets are invisible from such a point of view; the height of the houses, which in the better residential quarters is considerable, cannot be appreciated; and there are few inequalities of ground or striking edifices and but little verdure to break the clay-coloured superficies of terraced roofs and insignificant upper storeys. Some rising ground occurs in the trans-Tigris suburb, and one of the quarters in the west centre of the main town appears to stand on higher ground than the rest. Conspicuous single objects are the isolated minaret of the Suq-al-Ghazal JjiJI or Thread Market, rising to the height of about 100 feet in the very centre of the main town; the Latin Church, with a cupola of brick, 150 yards to the west of it; the domed shrme of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir near the south-eastern extremity of the town; and, lastly, the fine blue cupola of the Jami'-al-Maidan ubiJ) towards the west end, with the summit of the Jami J -as-Sarai mosque somewhat nearer the middle of the town, close to the government ofiSces ; and the AzbaK mosque nearer the circumference^ just within the Bab-al-Mu^adhdham or westernmost gate of the towa.200 BAGHDAD CITY In all, Baghdad is said to possess 145 mosques. The trans-Tigris suburb is devoid of architectural features. Views of Baghdad from the river or from the ground level are less disappointing; the better houses, built of soft yellow brick, are some times three storeys high and are frequently ornamented with projecting balconies or windows of carved wood called Shanashil . The long, vaulted brick bazaars are dark/ but their very obscurity only increases the picturesqueness of the effect. The poorer quarters of the town contain low and commonplace houses of unburnt brick. Shrines, monuments and inscriptions. —The most famous shrine at Baghdad is the tomb and mosque of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir, Gilani, near the east end of the town; it was once a centre of political intrigue and was regarded as a place of sanctuary from the law and from the civil arm; but the Turks have now brought it under proper control. A well-known tomb is that of Shaikh 'Umr, with a fretted tapering top, which stands in the vacant space between the town and the old northern wall; the individual commemorated whose full name was Shaikh ''Umr-as-Suhrawardi, Shahab-ad-Dm ^ , was an eminent Muham- madan teacher and preacher who was born at Suhraward in 539 A. H.&gt; taught at Baghdad and Basrah, and died at Baghdad in 632 A. H. We may mention also, though it possesses no sacred character, the tomb of the Lady Zubaidah consort of the Khalifah Harun-ar- Bashid; it is situated on the edge of the desert beyond the southern suburb and consists of an octagon surmounted by a shaft which suggests the inverted cone of a pine-tree. The minaret of the Suq-al-Ghazal bears an inscription in the Kufic character, but it is reported undecipherable. Another, on the wall of what is now the Customs House, is in excellent preservation and fixes the date of that building as 630 A. H. Thoroughfares and communications. streets of Baghdad are generally ill-kept and too narrow for the passage of a wheeled vehicle. There is no main street unless a road, somewhat wider than the others, which leads from the main bazaar past the military barracks and govern ment offices to the Bab-al-Mu'adhdham may be so termed; this road shortly before it reaches the city gate traverses the Maidan or principal piazza of the town. The two sides of the river are connected about the middle of the town by a Jisr or bridge of boats 240 yards in length, composedBAGHDAD CITY 201 of strongly-built wooden pontoons ; these are lashed together and are moored not only to the banks, but also to buoys in midstream. The roadway laid across the bridge is fit for any kind of vehicle and is pro vided with a parapet or handrail. A section of 3 boats near the ri^ht o bank can be disconnected and swung down stream to allow the passage of steamers or masted vessels, and the bridge can be opened at the other end also. The whole bridge is removed in case of high floods, especially if the wind is blowing up the river; for such a wind, if strong, sometimes raises quite a sea. Numerous Quffahs ply as ferry boats between the two parts of the town. A horse tramway to Kadhimain starts from a station in the south western part of the town not far from the head of the bridge of boats. * Viater supply.—Ahowi 30 (1 houses in the Maidan and 3 other quarters of the town are supplied by means of pipes with water from the Tigris ; the water for these is pumped from the river by an oil engine of 20 horse power, but no attempt is made to filter it, and the silt even is not allowed to settle. In other parts of the town water is furnished by carriers who bring it in single skins balanced on the backs of donkeys, not in pairs of skins loaded so as to counterpoise one another as in India : the present cost of water so fetched is from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 4-11-0 per 100 skins according to the distance of the house from the river. The shrine of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir, Gilani, and part of the quarter in which it stands are provided with water by means of pipes that are fed by lifts worked by horses. Many houses in the town have private wells, but the water in these is not sweet and is only fit for such purposes as watering the roads ; the level of the water in the wells varies with the level of the Tigris. Estimates are now being prepared by the local authorities for a scheme to supply the whole town with water automa tically. Inhabitants, religions, mode of life, and health. —From the ethnical standpoint Baghdad is a remarkable place : situated in an Arab country it is governed by Turks and inhabited chiefly by Jews, and so polyglot and cosmopolitan is its character that as many as 13 languages may occasion ally be heard in the same assembly. The population of the town is believed to amount, at the present time, to about 140,000 souls ; if so, it is apparently more than double what it was fifty years ago, when the ravages of the great plague of 1831 and other losses had not been fully repaired. Jews are about 55,000 and out-number every other racial group ; ♦ Fully described by Captain H. Smyth in his Beconnaissance Report, 1904.202 BAGHDAD CITY Arabs are next with a strength of about 38 ; 500 ; of whom some 7 ,500 are Bedouin sojourners; then come real or reputed Turks, 30,000 ; Kurds, 5,500 ; and Persians, 5,000. There are also about 8,000 native Christians who belong to various races. Some Pathans are found and a few Muhammadan Indians, but no Hindus. The Turks inhabit chiefly the western part of the main town, while the jews and Christians still partially adhere to their ancient quarters, adjoining the Suq -al-Ghazal on the north and west respectively. The original Christian quarter, however, is being rapidly overrun by Jews, While the Christians are spreading simultaneously into the more eastern quarters. The Arab, Persian and Kurdish elements live commingled throughout the remainder of the town^ except that the quarters on the right bank of the river are predominantly Persian and almost altogether Shi^ah. Of the Muhammadan population about five-ninths are Sunnis and four-ninths Shi'ahs. Among the leading Muhammadan inhabitants are the Naqib of Baghdad, who has a bouse on the left bank of the river immediately above the new British Residency, and Kazim ^ Pasha, a brother-in-law of the Saltan of Turkey who resides here as a political detenu in a mansion on the right bank of the Tigris nearly opposite to the French Consulate. The native Christians are divided into the following sects : Gregorian Armenians and Chaldsean Catholics, each about 2,000 j Syrian Catholics, 1,400; Roman Catholics or Latins, 1,200; Catholic Armenians, 1,000 ; Protestants^ 200 ; Greek Orthodox, 60. The Christians are mostly Christians by descent; few are recent converts or the children of such. The first five of the Christian communities specified have each a church of their own. The enclosure belonging to the church of the Gregorian Armenians was used for the burial of British Christians until the right to a separate British cemetery was conceded by the Turkish Government. It contains the grave of a British Residency Surgeon, Dr. Ross, who di:d in 1849. The present Armenian, Roman Catholic 2nd British cemeteries succeed each other upon the right of the road from the Bab- ash-Sharqi to the north-east corner of the old fortifications. A school and orphanage, managed by the Carmelite order, are attached to the Roman Caf lolic Churchy and a social club and library to that of the Gregorian Armenians. The Roman Catholic, Syrian Catholic and Catholic Armenian churches are closely associated with one another and are subject in common to the Bishop of Babylon, whose seat is at Baghdad. Advocates and lawyers are nearly all Christians.Baghdad oity 203 Fuller informafion about some of the classes of Baghdad society will be found in the general article on Turkish 'Iraq which should be consulted. Some characteristic features of life at Baghdad depend on the extreme climate of the place. Such is the habit of living in Sardabs or subterranean cellars during the heat of the day in summer, and of existing entirely on the roof between sunset and sunrise during the same season. Among institutions of public utility at Baghdad are, according to the Turkish official almanac, 12 libraries, 1 reading-room, ■28 baths, 7 gymnasia and 3 hotels. Schools are noticed in the general article on Turkish 'Iraq. The ' Baghdad boir' or ' date-mark' is a disease peculiar to Baghdad city, and a large proportion of the inhabitants bear its traces in the shape of permanent oral scars. It is a slow, sloughing, rodent ulcer, which generally attacks the face, hand, wrist or ankle, and is not generally amenable to treatment, but disappears of itself after running a tedious course of months ; in these respects it resembles the ' Aleppo button' and the ' frontier-sore 'of India; its cause is believed to be the entrance of dust from the streets through an abrasion in the skin. Trade. —The trade, manufactures and commercial position of Baghdad are dealt with at length in the article on Turkish 'Iraq. The principal bazaar runs parallel to the left bank of the river, at a short distance from it, from the bridge of boats to a point a little above the old British Residency. There is a smaller bazaar, also parallel to the river, in the southern suburb; it extends both above and below the bridge of boats and contains a number of grain stores or J Alwahs. The only bank is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman. In the whole town there are reported to be 4,000 shops, 208 Khans or caravansarais, 235 coffee houses, 182 'Alwahs, 116 flour mills worked by horses, 17f weavers' hand looms, 22 silk weaving machines, 68 dyeing establishments, 4 wool presses, and a soap factory. To these we piay add 13 potteries, a number of sweetmeat and treacle factories, 3 oil mills, and an ice machine. There are also 3 printing presses. Civil, military, and municipal Baghdad is the clef-lieu at once of the Wilayat, of the Sanjaq and of the Qadha—all simdarly named—m which it is situated. Its position in regard to the general administration of Turkish 'Iraq in all its departments is dis cussed in the article under that name. The law courts, including the mercantile court, and the civil and military offices of government form a block of buildings known as theh Sarai on the left bank of the Tigris ; the Sarai begins about 350 yards above the bridge of boats and has a considerable frontage on the river ; it contains also the public reception rooms of the 'Wali. Imme diately above the Sarai is the local office of the Dairat-as-Sanlyah. One court-house at a distance from the others is the Shara' court, which stands on the left bank of the Tigris about i of a mile below the bridge of boats. The Customs House is on the left bank of the river a short dis^ tance below the bridge of boats ; near to it is the mooring place of all the river steamers. Baghdad is the centre of the telegraph system of the Basrah, Baghdad and Musal Wilayats, which is described in the article on Turkish 'Iraq and the head office, which is accommodated under the same roof with the principal post office, is situated in a back street a little way from the Maidan on its north side. There is a harbour master at Baghdad who superintends shipping and river conservancy. Baghdad is the seat of the Central Committee of the Dairat-as-Saniyah administration in ; Iraq. The military importance of Baghdad as the headquarters of the 6tli Turkish Army Corps will be apparent from the article on Turkish 'Iraq, in which also the strength and composition of the local garrison are noticed. It is the headquarters of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 81st regi* inent of the Eadif and also of the 41st brigade of the same. The tow^ as already explained, is now practically unfortified. The infantry of the garrison, with the exception of certain guards such as that over the magazine at the Bab-at-Tilism, are quartered in barracks having a large parade ground with a clock tower in the centre; these are called the Qishlah —a corruption from Qishlaq —and extend up the left bank of the Tigris almost all the way from the bridge of boats to the Sarai. The eastern end of the Qishlah contains a secondary military school, but the local Government now propose to sell the building and transfer this school to another site. The cavalry lines are outside the Bab-al-Mu'adhdham at no great distance from the river or the town: they adjoin the road to Mu/adMham and are surrounded by an ordinary wall. There are also quarters for marines. The town contains 19 small military posts or guard houses. The QaFah or ancient citadel still exists, retaining its mili tary designation, in the corner of the main town between the Bab -al -Mu ; - adhdham and the river ; it comprises the artillery lines known as Top- khanah , a military prison, a prison for ordinary life-convicts, a large open space, and possibly an ordnance store. The Turkish official UBKtBMammamBAGHDAD OITY 205 almanac stows that there are two arsenals and two arms depots. A - military hospital, known as the Majidtyah is situated outside the ' town on the river bank just above the QaPah, and a military bakery ^ ' exists. ' * ' Baghdad is a municipality, and as such its affairs are supposed to be 11 regulated by a Municipal Council working nnder the supervision of the * rs 4: civil authorities. In point of fact the committee can do little beyond . pwolil offering suggestions to the Wali j they cannot of themselves expend any sum larger than 200 gold piastres and in the circumstances it is not extra- 10 11 ordinary that few signs of their activity should be observable.

There were formerly 3 separate municipalities in the town, ' C coiib but now they have been combined into one by order of the local Govern- airat-as-Si ment. im of i foreign consular buildings, etc. —The question of foreign interests and their representation at Baghdad is sufficiently dealt with in the article on Turkish 'Iraq ; here it only remains to mention the tangible evidences f tie SP 0f 4116 Same W ^ cl1 e3 ' st * n tlle slla I )e of buildings.

The new British Residency, which is the property of the Indian Government, is on the same bank but at twice the distance below the bridge of boats; along with its dependencies (which include a separate ,n X house for the Residency Surgeon, a dispensary, a post office and lines 16 ki for the native infantry guard) it is situated not far from the south- arcoite eastern end of the town and was originally one of the last buildings in or fci this direction, but already a number of houses have sprung up between by an ^ and the open country.

These residences are all rented from private owners, except the German which is the private property of the German Consul. The Persian Consulate-General is on the right bank of the river about 150 yards above the bridge of boats : it also is a hired building. The consular representatives of Belgium and Norway, being private merchants charged with consular functions, have no official residences* BAGHDAD A division of the Sanjaq, similarly named, in the Baghdad Wilayat of Turkish 'Iraq. QADHA Position and houndaries, —The Qadha of Baghdad is situated on both banks of the Tigris, partly above and partly below Baghdad City. It is bounded on the east by the river Diyalah. in its lower course, and on the south and west—except that it includes the trans-Tigris suburb of the —'by the Tigris : on the north and north-west it is in contact with the Qadha of KadMmain and on the north and north-east with that of Khurasan. Topography, —The only points of any importance which the Qadha contains, besides the city of Baghdad itself, are Mu'adhdham and Qararah, each of which is described in a separate article under its own name. Population. —The fixed population of the Qadha may be estimated at 150,000 souls. Of these about 55,000 are Jews by religion, while 50,000 are Sunni Muhammadans, 37,000 are Shi'ah Muhammadans, and 8,000 are Christians. The articles on Baghdad City and Mu'adhdham give the composition by races of almost the whole population of the Qadha. Resources, —Most of the wealth in the Qadha belongs to the city of Baghdad, the article on which may be'consulted, It remains to add that a considerable cultivation of fruit and vegetables is carried on upon P% a rPpkli wBAHARINAH 207 07 4ii (1 ive a^ Hese nj % 4;i }ft!ie nicn aj, Deing;; ial resifcs rer course,! T1S m the banks of the river immediately above'and below the town/and even within the municipal limits. The gardens are irrigated from the Tigris by means of water lifts or pumps ; and in many of them are situated country or pleasure houses belonging to wealthy residents of the town. The fruits grown are dates, grapes, peaehes ; nectarines, pomegranates, figs, plums, mulberries, quinces, limes, citrons, oranges, apples and apricots, but only the oranges are of the first quality ; the vegetables include ladies^ fingers, brinjols, cucumbers, musk melons, water melons, pumpkins, beetroot, carrots, cabbages, cauliflowers, turnips, cress, lettuce, beans, tomatoes, onions, garlic and radishes. Some of the vegetables are of recent introduction ; on the whole they are good, but, as successive sowings are not regularly made, they are obtainable only during a short season. According to Turkish official statistics there are 769 water lifts in the immediate environs of Baghdad City, while date palms within the same limits number 177,800 and] other fruit trees 130,000. The area of cultivation in the Qadha has been estimated at 1,850 Faddans. Administration. — In this Qadha there is no Qaim-Maqam; the ad ministration is carried on by the Wali of the Wilayat, whose residence is within its limits, in Baghdad City. There is only one Nahiyah, that of Mu'adhdham, belonging to the 2nd class ; another which formerly existed at Qararah has been suppressed. SID I I'adMta isnf, # f the ft' gs t#:' 1 Singular Balirani . The name of the race or class to which nearly all the ShI'ahs of the Bahrain Islands, of the Hasa and Qatif Oases and of the Qatar promontory belong. The mistake of supposing that Baharinah means ' natives of Bahrain must be carefully guarded against; on the contrary the Sunni inhabitant of Bahrain repudiates the name of ' Bahrani' and describes the class to which he himself belongs as ' Ahl-al-Bahrain.' As employed along the western coast of the Persian Gulf the term Bahrani is practically a synonym for a Shi'ah Muhammadan whose mother tongue is Arabic. Numbers and distribution. —In Bahrain the number of the Baharinah appears to be about 38,000 souls ; in the Hasa Oasis, if we include the Shi ah population, of the towns of Hofuf and Mubarraz, they are about 80,000 persons in the Qatif Oasis, inclusive of Qatif Town, they are perhaps 28,000 souls, In Qatar they have about 60 houses at Dohah BAHARI NAH Lsr? i208 BAHARINAH and 40 at Wakrah, representing in all about 500 heads. Some of tlie tribe have emigrated at various times to other parts of the Gulf, especially to some of the districts of the Persian Coast, such as Dashti and perhaps Dashtistan; about 250 Baharinah are settled at Sohar Town in the Sultanate of ^Oman and about 600 at the towns of Abu Dhabi and Dibui in Trucial 'Oman ; and the total number of the Baharinah cannot now be assessed at much less than 100,000 persons. Religion and character.* —All Baharinah are Shi'ahs. They are un- warlike in character and tend to peaceful pursuits, the richer among them living by trade and the poorer by husbandry, pearl diving and various handicrafts. Leading families. —The Baharinah have no tribal cohesion or organisation, but some of their leading families are distinguished by names. The prominent Bahrani families of the Hasa and Qatif Oases, —if we except the ; Alaiwat ,who are found at ^Anik in the Qatif Oasis, and the Al Bin-Ghanim ^ ^ J},whose Shaikhs ruled Qatif Town until they were subverted by the Wahhabis,—have not been ascertained ; but among the wealthier and more important in the Bahrain Principality are the following:— ^Anabirah 'Asafirah jyUa* (or Al ^Asfur Jf) 'Asakirah Ghabarah Hadadid Majid (Al) jf Muslim (Al) jf Eafyah (Al) aa S j JI Rahmah (Al) jf and Suwar (Al Bin-) Jl; besides numerous families of Saiyids who are now recognised as Baharinah. The above are mostly large families of which branches are found in different parts of Bahrain. The Baqaqalah of Bahrain —but not those of Qatar who are Sunnis — are considered to be Baharinah; so are the Hamidah. Origin. —The Baharinah are generally stated to have come into existence by the conversion of certain Arab tribes, including one called the Bani Rabf, to Shi'ism about 300 years ago; this is the local Muhammadan tradition. Some European writers on the other hand have manifested an inclination to regard the bulk of the Baharinah as an aboriginal tribe conquered by the Arabs. In the absence of sufficient ethnological data it is impossible to pronounce in favour of or against &gt; to ■ either theory.r^N, ^3) BAHMANSHlR 209 A town of the 'Oman Sultanate in 'Oman Proper towards the west BAHLAH jfi end of that district and about 20 miles west of Nizwa; it is situated la % 1^600 feet above sea level. The site with the surrounding' cultivation ^ 1 forms an irregular parallelogram about 2 square miles in extent^ which ^ is enclosed by a wall and stands on the left bank of Wadi Bahlah^ a ^ cail,1 t tributary probably of W adi Halfain. The town, composed of a number of distinct villages or walled quarters, is in appearance one of the Tlej - most striking in 'Oman. On an eminence in the centre of it rises a hug'e ie riclen white fort with two towers, one of which is very lofty and commands pearl &amp; a splendid view of the whole valley; while around, on various sides, the plain is broken by low hills less than two miles distant. The )a j ^, inhabitants of Bahlah are Mahariq (35 houses), 'Abriyin (200 houses), ! Bayasirah (100 houses), Jannabah &lt;30 houses), Miyayihah of the ^^ Maqarishah section (30 houses), Bani Jissas (30 houses), Bani Kalban (30 houses), Bani Rashid (50 houses), Bani Shakail (40 houses) and mixed ' tribes,'amounting to about 3,000 souls in all. The crops grown on the town lands include wheat, barley, lowan, susrar. beans, srram and cotton ; cenwrki i . • , „ ) , there are also plantains and mangoes and the number of date palms is estimated at 3,000, There are 40 horses, 300 camels, 400 donkeys^ 600 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats. Cloaks called Manasil JLuAl* are manu- factured of fine goats^ hair, some earthenware is made, and lungrs are I fk woven as in most of the larger places in 'Oman. Bahlah is believed to I be a very ancient place and was for a time under the Nabhani dynasty, I) who ruled at the beginning' of the 17th century, the capital of all 'Oman. The principal Shaikh is Nasir-bin-Hamaiyid, a man of forcible character who attained his position about 1885 by the murder of two elder brothers, rgcojgBarghash and Bashid. In March 1885 a destructive flood occurred in 1 branete^ e Wadi by which many date trees and houses were swept away. be tit Or Bakmishir but the forms Bahmanshir and Bahmanshir BiBMAN- ive are ^ oca lty more prevalent.

There are two remarkable bends rather below the middle of its course. The breadth of the river varies from 300 yards in the upper reaches to 600 yards and even | a mile as it approaches the sea. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century it carried about two- fifths of the water of the Karun and its depth at low water was nowhere less than 9 feet; but by 1890 the uppermost 15 miles of its course had become obstructed by banks which in places dried almost across the channel at low water, and the R.I.M.S. ' Comet/* drawing only three feet, grounded twice in making the passage: the 80 miles of the river nearest to the sea however then continued navigable for vessels of not more than 7 feet draft. Native sea-going boats cannot now pass tlie shoals of the upper Bahmanshir without assistance from the tide. The rise and fall of the tide, which is felt throughout the whole length of the Bahmanshir, is about 9 feet. The channel between the mouth of the river and the open sea is called Khor Bahmanshir; at its north end it had, in 1890, 15 feet at low water diminishing to 12, 10 and finally to 8 feet on the bar, which is of soft mud and 10 miles distant from the river mouth; the river was then accessible, at low water, to craft drawing not more than 7 feet. When there was no steamer service at Kuwait and Muhammareh was the steam-port of that place, the native sailing boats by which communication was maintained frequently made use of the Bahmanshir channel in order to escape Turkish interference upon the Shatt-al -'Arab. From the Karun downwards the banks are lined with villages and date-plantations to within about 10 miles of the sea; low grassy plains follow, the banks for some distance remaining firm and steep ; finally, the stream enters a region of shelving mud-flats, covered above the water line with coarse grass and reeds. Islands are easily formed in the Bahmanshir by staking the stream and so causing a deposit of silt, and this is frequently done ; the new island is at first used for pasturage and ultimately brought under cultivation. * Of these two names, that of Silaich is perhaps sometimes used by natives to describe the whole stream to which the present article relates. But the term is open to objection as leading to confusion with Khor Silaich—see article Khor Mtisa—which enters the gea between the Bahmanshir and Khor Musa.BAHMANSHlR 211 The villages upon the right bank o£ the Bahmanshir are enumer ated and described in the article on 'Abbadan island; tho^e on the left bank are :— 'miles ^ Nam0, leu' Munikh Pwetsl ater- i Silaik (Upper) )t nowp Q tlie i ghLj Kharkhareh II 0 J ^ i tlie mi ihir; aliti' no; to II,: 1#mJ ^ilaik (Lower) iw water, ? amer sen Bu 'Abbadi Jj rithls r)W Malakeh ifU Bu Shanak jj sit o: d.Od Tingeh Position.

Shape, size and physical characteristics.-— shape of the island corresponds with that of the gulf, the coa.sts that front'the mainland being approximately parallel to it throughout. From the northernmost point near Manamah town to the southern extremity at Has-al-Barr, Bahrain Island measures 80 miles : its maximum breadth from Bas-al-Jufair to Budaiya' is 10 miles. The total area of the island is 208 square miles, and about 18 square miles are covered by date plantations. The principal date belt is at the north end of the island; it is almost continuous from Manamah to Buri, with a length north-east and south west of 7 and a maximum breadth at the middle of 3 miles ; and it thus occupies most of the space north of the great marine indentation, known as Khor-al -Kabb, which penetrates from the east coast almost to the centre of the island. The greater part of Bahrain Island is flat and low, but the surface rises gradually from all sides towards the centre to form a plateau 100 to 200 feet high; in the middle of the plateau is an oval-shaped depres sion, about 13 miles long from north to south by 4 broad, containing in its centre the solitary hill of J abal-ad-Du khan, 440 feet high, the most elevated point on the island. The descent inwards from the plateau to the depression is in most places too steep to be practicable for animals ; it consists at the northern end of a nearly vertical drop of 20 feet followed by a steep slope of 30 feet. The plateau itself is extraordinarily stony and presents a line of low cliffs, perhaps 15 feet high, to the north, below which is a sandy plain extending in all direc tions to the coast and draining from west to east. Jabal-ad -Dukhan is of a dark hue, but elsewhere the rocks are light yellow or light pink, indeed almost white, in colour. Features of the coasts.— We need not dwell here on the geology of Bahrain Island, which is dealt with at length in the article on the Bahrain Principality; but it will be convenient to give at this point, in alphabetical order, a list of the chief features and points of interest ♦ The more important authorities, maps, charts, etc., are specified in a footnote to tha general article on Bahrain Principality.II BAHRAIN ISLAND 213 fj —other than inhabited or cultivated spots—which occur upon the ;if L coast:— Name.

The article on the Bahrain Principality may be con sulted in regard to all matters not dealt with above which concern Bahrain Island. Heie however we may mention that in Bahrain Island a space of more than 12 square miles is covered by fields of prehistoric tumuli, by the Aiabs called Muraqib ; they lie for the most part on the glacis of the plateau to the north of the central depression, and those of the laigest size and seemingly greatest importance are close to the village of 'Ali.BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 233 I'he term Bahrain once embraced the promontory of Qatar and the Oases of Qatif and Has a as well as the islands of the archipelago : some authorities indeed would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from E .UUS -al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-al -'Arab. The derivation of the name is uncertain. Its apparent * This leading article on fche Bahrain principality and the minor articles on places in the same are founded chiefly upon systematic and careful investigations made on the spot during the years 1904-1905. The information available from sources existing before 1904 was arranged by the writer and was issued in November of that year in the form of 9 printed foolscap pages intended to serve as a basis for further inquiry. The inquiry proper was begun by the writer on tour in Bahrain early in 1905 ; but it was carried out chiefly by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, I.A., who personally travelled over the greater part of the islands, and by Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent in Bahrain, who supplied very full information regarding all places in his jurisdiction. A set of draft articles founded on the notes and reports of 1905 was then prepared by the writer; it was finished in January 1906 and extended to over 60 octavo pages of print. These drafts were sent to Captain Prideaux, by whom they were very carefully revised with the assistance of Mr. In'am-al-Haqq, the Agency Interpreter, a graduate of the Aligarh College. Early in 1907 the drafts were reissued, with modifications and additions, and some points which remained doubtful or obscure were disposed of by Captain Prideaux and his assistant during the year. Geological information was kindly furnished by Mr. G. Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India. The articles in their final form now occupy over 70 octavo pages. Bahrain has from an early time attracted the attention of travellers in the Persian Gnlf, and the following are some of the older authorities on the islands: Niebuhr's Description de VArabie, 1774; Buckingham's Travels in Assyria, Media and Persia, 1829 ; Whitelock's Description of the Arabian Coast, 1838; iMignan's Winter Journey, 1839; Bombay Records, XXIV, 1856; Whish's Memoir on 'Bahreyn (with map), 1862 ; and Palgrave's Central and Eastern Arabia, 1865. More recent are: Captain E. L. Durand's Description oj the Bahrein Islands, 1879, and his Extracts from a Report on the Islands and Antiquities of Bahrain, 1880; Mr. T. Bent's Bahrein Islands in the Persian Gulf, 1890 ; Captain J. A. Douglas's Journey from the Mediterranean to India, ISW the Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898; the Reverend S. M. Zwemer's Arabia, 1900; Mrs. T. Bent's Southern Arabia, 1900; and Captain A. W. Stiffe's Ancient Trading Centres of the Persian Gutf— Bahrain, 1901. Captain Durand's second paper and the contributions of Mr. and Mrs. Bent deal partly with the subject of antiquities ; the Persian Gulf Pilot is concerned chiefly with maritime features; and the remainder of the authorities are general in their scope. In matters relating to trade, the annual commercial reports of the Political Agent in Bahrain are the chief source of information. A large scale map of the Bahrain Islands (except Jazirat Umm Na'asan) exists in the Survey of India's sheet Bahrain 1904-1905, the result of a survey undertaken in connection with the Gazetteer inquiries; and Admiralty Plan No. 2377-20, Bahrain Harbour, shows some detail of the northern half of the islands and their coasts as well as all marine features on the northern side of the (g) BAHRAIN PRINCI PALITY*234 BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITT meaning is ' the Two Seas/' but the reference is not clear and is inter* preted in different ways. Extent and importance,— present Shaikhdom of Bahrain consists of the archipelago formed by the Bahrain, Muharraq, Umm Na'asa^, Sitrah and Nabi Salih islands and by a number of lesser islets and roc k s which are enumerated in the articles upon the islands ; taken all together these form a compact group almost in the middle of the gulf which divides the promontory of Qatar from the coast of Qatlf and which, as it has no recognised name, may appropriately be styled the Gulf of Bahrain. Connected with the sovereignty of Bahrain, or possibly appertaining to the Shaikh as hereditary personal property, are certain ill-defined rights upon the mainland of Qatar, at present (1905) under discussion. Whatever the nature or extent of these rights our attention will be confined, in the present article, to the undisputed insular possessions of the Shaikh. On the western side of the Persian Gulf, Bahrain is, agriculturally and commercially, the most valuable district. Its position moreover as regards the Persian Gulf is central, for the distance of its port and capital from the entrance of the Gulf is only a little greater than its distance from the mouth of the Shatt-al -'Arab. On the Arabian side of, the Gulf, Bahrain has no rival in political importance except the principality of Kuwait; and the Turkish province of Hasa, although it affords the best and shortest approach from the Gulf to Najd, is itself commercially dependent upon Bahrain. Marine surroundings, —The most striking feature of the Bahrain group of islands is the lowness and levelness of the land and the shallowness of the environing sea. The whole Gulf of Bahrain from Ras Rakan to Ras Tanurah, a distance of 73 miles, is, except for one clear and fairly wide channel which runs north and south off the east coast of Muharraq Island, a mass of reefs and shoals. The most exten sive obstacles to navigation in the archipelago are the Fasht -ad-Bibal lMI , between Muharraq Island and Ras Rakan, four miles group. The general chart for Bahrain is No. 2374— -2837-b., pemw both this and the Plan mentioned contain distant views of the Bahrain Islands from the sea. There are two recent marine surveys of the wafers to the west and east of the Bahrain islands, respectively, namely, Bahrain to Ojar and Bahrein to 'Ras Bahhn, Preliminary Charts Nos. O. 1 and 0. 2, Poona, 1902. Two charts relating to Khor-al- Qalai'ah accompany a report by Lieutenant H. 0. Somerville, R.N., which was printed for the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, in July 190o.BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 235 long from north to south by three miles broad ; and the Fasht-al-Jarim 15 miles long north and sonth by 9 miles broad towards its northern end ; which shelters the harbour of Manamah from north and west winds. Many of the reefs of the Bahrain islands are partially dry at low water. On the side towards the open sea the shallow waters of Bahrain may be considered to end at the Eennie Shoal, 54 miles north of Muharraq. There is a passage called the Khor-al-Bab from Manamah to Qatif south of the Fasht-al-Jarim^ which is practicable for vessels drawing not more than 15 feet* Many pearl banks are situated in these waters : their names and positions are given in the Appendix on the Pearl Fisheries. Geology. —The main island of Bahrain forms a striking geological contrast to the other islands of the Persian Gulf. The rocks are chiefly white or pale-coloured limestones of the eocene age^ sometimes sandy or argillaceous^ and so disposed as to form a low anticlinal dome of which Jabal-ad -Dukhan is the summit. In the hollow betweeu the girdling plateau (described in the article on Bahrain Island) and this central peak the rock has been denuded by marine agency and forms a plain. In places the eocene limestone rocks are highly fossiliferous and contain foraminifera^ echinids and mollusca : as a whole they are characterised by an abundance of siliceous materia], occurring as flinty as cherty concretions or as quartz geodes^ and by the dissemination of gypsum and salt through out the series in a marked degree. The presence of the salt and the gypsum is most conspicuous in certain places where they have been leached out of the rock and have formed vast accumulations of saliferous or gypseous soil. The most distinctly marked areas of this character are one towards the south end of Bahrain Island and another on the island of Umm Na'asan, and the gypsum fields of the latter supply practically all the mortar that is used in Bahrain. The coastal portions of Bahrain Island^ as also of the other islands of the group^ are overlaid with sub-recent coral rocks or shelly concrete; and sandstone of the same age is found in the central depression of Bahrain Island* This depression^ as well as the littoral flats ; has in fact emerged from the sea in comparatively recent times ; and the remains of the old sea-beaches are well marked. A small deposit of asphalt is found penetrating the eocene rocks 3 miles south-south-east of Jabal-ad -Dukhan. The Bahrain islands are famous for a remarkable set of springs &gt; beautifully clear and but slightly brackish^ some of which are sub marine ; the majority of them are enumerated in the articles on the^ if-y. - v - 236 BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY principal islands^ and here it will be snfficient to mention that in the northern part of Bahrain Island, north of Khor-al-Kabb ; they are warm, copious and nearly fresh, the best known in that district being those of 'Adari, Qassari and Abu Zaidan. The most noteworthy springs in the sea are that of Abu Mahur close to Muharraq Island and the Kaukab on Fasht Khor Fasht. The best water in the islands is obtained from the Hanaini wells, at the north end of the central depression of Bahrain Island, and from the Khalid and Umm Ghuwaifah wells on the plateau adjoining. There can be little doubt that the springs of Bahrain, like those of the Hofuf and Qatlf Oases, are fed by the drainage of part of Najd which, temporarily lost in Dah^nah and Sah^bah, travels thence eastwards by subterranean passages. Climate and seasons, —The climate of Bahrain is by no means the worst in the Persian Gulf, and some travellers have emphasized its less pleasant features in terms which the facts do not warrant. Daily observations have been taken only since October 1901, and since that time the highest temperature registered has been lOT'S 0 F. and the lowest 40°. The weather from October to April inclusive is pleasant, the temperature indoors ranging between 60° and 85° F.; January and February however, in which north winds blow and it is cold enough to light housefires, are sometimes rainy and unhealthy. From the beginning of May till the middle of June the weather is hot; but the heat is still tempered by the sea-breeze or Barih, and the nights are fairly cool. From the middle of June until the end of September the heat is oppressive; land breezes from the west, south-west and south, it is true, continue irregularly all summer; but in the intervals the thermometer remains persistently above 100° F. The average rainfall between 190^ and 1906 was 3*25 inches a year; but the atmosphere of Bahrain, in consequence of irrigation and the nearness of the sea, is damp and heavy, as is evidenced by the mean humidity which ranges from 79 to 80 per cent, of saturation. The rainy season is considered to begin at the middle of October and to end at the middle of May ; the rainy days however are ordinarily 3 to 6 only. In Bahrain only the Shaikhs, who own flocks and herds, welcome rain; to the poorer classes in their frail huts of date fronds it causes serious discomfort. The prevailing wind is the Shamal or north-wester, which in winter is violent and dangerous to shipping ; after it the north wind is the most frequent; the only strong wind besides the Shamal is the Qaus from the south-east which blows irregularly between December and April. On the wholeBAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 237 II? L the climate of Bahrain is probably superior to that of Masqat or Bandar ^Abbas and it certainly excels that of the neighbouring' shores of Qatit but rheumatic affections are very common, and so also are diseases of the heart and lungs. A grey-headed negro is hardly ever ^een, and the pearl divers of Bahrain are notoriously a shorfc-Iived race, though this possibly is due rather to their occupation than to the climate. Natural products and wild animals. —The only minerals of value in Bahrain have been mentioned already in the paragraph on geology. There is almost no natural vegetation ; mangroves in the creeks and a few ber trees in other places appear to be the only exceptions f there is not even grass except what is artificially cultivated. A kind of small gazelle (believed to be Arabica) is not uncommon in the less inhabited parts of the main island ; and hares and mongoose are fairly numerous. The Houbara bustard is a winter visitor, and the Shaikhs keep hawks (impoited from Persia) for hunting it. Sandgrouse also are sometimes seen, but are not apparently sought after by native sportsmen. Population and trihes.~~No census has ever been taken of the popu lation of Bahrain, but we subjoin here a rough estimate based on the reported number of houses. The totals of souls have been calculated on an assumed aveiage of 5 persons to a house j and if, as is not improb able, the figure assumed is too low in the towns, the totals for urban population must be proportionally increased.

To these must he added about 200 non-Muhammadans at Manamah, making a grand total of 99,275 settled inhabitants. The only nomads are Na'im Bedouins, who frequent the island in varying numbers, and a few Ka^aban who bave no settled residence. Of the whole population of about 100,000 souls some 60,000, chiefly townsmen, are Sunnis and about 40,000, mostly villagers, are Shi^ahs. The largest community—for it cannot be called a tribe—in the princi- pality is undoubtedly that of the Bahranis or Baharinah, who compose nearly the whole of the Shfah community and more than three-fifths of the rural population. The remainder of the people, except a few foreigners such as Persians and Basrah Arabs, Hindus, Jews, etc., belong to various Sunni tribes or classes, of which the most important, numerically or for other reasons, appear in the following synopsis :— Name.

Although the Baharinah are numerically the strongest class they are far from being politically the most important; indeed their position is little better than one of serfdom. Most of the date cultivation and agriculture of the islands is in their hands; but they also depend^ though to a less extent than their Sunni brethren; upon pearl diving and other seafaring occupations. The Huwalah are the most numerous community of Sunnis; but they are all townsmen living by trade and without solidarity among themselves;BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 241 consequently they are unimportant^ except commercially. The 'Utub, the Sadah and the Dawasir are the most influential tribes in Bahrain ; the first on account of their connection with the ruling family, the Sadah by virtue of their sacred origin, and the Dawasir because they are com paratively wealthy, united, and obedient to their chiefs, and partly, perhaps, that as the most recent immigrants from Najd they enjoy a pertain prestige. The remainder of the Sunni population are mostly settled on or near the coast, and depend chiefly on the sea, and in a lesser degree on cultivation, for their subsistence. The races inhabiting Bahrain are generally insignificant in appearance and there is nothing remarkable in their character. The pearl diving sections of the community seem to be distinguished by weak eyes and raucous voices. The huts in which the bulk of the rural population live are constructed of date or reed mats and have gable roofs. In concluding this paragraph we may notice that, though negroes are numerous in Bahrain, a mixture of Arab and negro blood is here less frequent than in the ports of 'Oman and Trucial 'Oman. The analysis of population given above shows that there are nearly 5,000 free negroes and 6,000 negro slaves in the principality, and these figures are probably much below the mark as it has been impossible, except in the larger places, to distinguish negro families from the communities among whom they live or by whom they are owned. The reason given for the non-^ mixture of blood is that in Bahrain a full-blood negro slave is more valuable than a half-caste son. The services of slaves are hired out by their masters for the pearl fishery, and in winter the slave and his family are left to support themselves. In some cases the slave is married to a free woman with whom his master has no concern ; but in others the master provides the slave with a slave wife and takes possession of the offspring. Agriculture and domestic animals. —The agricultural products of Bahrain are chiefly fruits, lucerne and a few vegetables ; the last, includ ing brinjals, cucumbers, carrots, leeks and onions, are almost the only non-arboreal crops. The supply of vegetables is sufficient for local con sumption and none are imported. Plant growth generally is rank, but the produce is poor. The citrons of Bahrain are, it is true, the best in the Persian Gulf, and there is a kind of small and luscious banana; but the date palms are here of a dull green and have a poor and stunted appearance, while the other fruits, whether almonds, apricots, figs, grapes, limes, melons, peaches or pomegranates, fall below mediocrity. There are some tamarinds, and the mango and mulberry are seen, but are rare. RBAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY Tlie soil is perhaps not sterile, although, without cultivation, it does not ordinarily produce even grass; deficiency of rainfall is probably the chief reason, for in exceptionally wet years grass is said to grow knee-deep all over the central depression of the main island to the edge of the Mimlahat-al-Mattalah. All cultivated land is irrigated from springs or wells. The springs are many and copious, but the low level at which many of them lie makes it necessary to conduct the water to the planta tions in very deep cuttings, which in places are lined with stone and in others are carried through outcrops of rock. Irrigation is of 3 kinds, and date plantations are distinguished as Nakhl-as-Saih ^JI Dulab and Nakhl-al-Gharrafah ; of these the first kind is watered by gravitation from flowing channels, the second by a lift of 1 or 2 skins raised by bullocks or donkeys walking down a slope, and the third by a Gharraf ah or lever and skin with a counterpoise.* Fish-manure is used to fertilise the date groves. Agricultural produce is brought to market daily in the Manamah bazaar, and weekly at the Suq-al-Khamis fair (on Thursdays) and at a place near Qal^at-al -'Ajaj (on Mondays). The most valuable of the domestic animals are donkeys of a particular breed, from 12 to IS'l hands in height; they aie generally white but a few incline to greyness, probably on account of impure breeding. The stock was originally imported from Hasa and is perhaps the finest kind of donkey in the world. The females, being less noisy than the males, are sold at higher prices, and a good one sometimes fetches as much as RSOO; the stallions are all sold to professional donkey boys, who hire them out in the towns for riding or carrying loads. Only about 200 of these donkeys, it is said, now exist upon the islands; but the number of donkeys of all sorts, according to the statistics obtainable, is nearly 2,000. The ordinary donkeys, about 1,800 in number, are of all colours- white, grey, black and brown—»and vary in height from 12 to 10 hands and less; they are useful and capable of hard work. The provender of donkeys is chiefly lucerne, dates and grass. Horses are only kept by the family of the ruling Shaikh : they are generally of pure Najdi blood, but have somewhat deteriorated through being bred in an unsuitable climate. No horses are bred for exportation : those owned are about 50 in number. About 100 camels are owned by the Shaikh and his family and perhaps 50 others belong to private individuals at the two Eifa/s, who employ them in carrying water to Manamah for sale. There is a small but fine local breed of cattle, famous even on the Persian coast for their milking * The Gharrafah is handled by one man. The counterpoise is genera Ut a basket of earth,BAHRAIN PEINOIPALITT 243 qualities ; the beef of Bahrain howeyer, which sells locally at about 6 annaw per lb., is by no means first-rate. Cattle of ail sorts ii) the islands are reported to amount to about 850 |iead; they are stall-fed upon dates, lucerne,, bhoosa^ dried fish and old bones and are sometimes unable to walk on account of their over-grown hoofs. Sheep and goats are few and are hardly owned outside the principal island^ there being no grazing else-!- where except upon Umm Na'asan; it is estimated that there are in all about 500 sheep and 700 goats, of which 600 belong to the leading members of the A1 Khalifah or ruling family, 400 to the larger Arab tribes, and ^00 (stall-fed) to individual townsmen of Manamah and Muharraq. Mutton and goats' flesh, mostly imported, sells locally at 7 to 8 annas per lb, according to quality. Pearl and sea fisheries. —The pearl fisheries of Bahrain are the most important in the Persian Gulf except those of Trucial 'Oman j they employ 917 boats and afford occupation to over 17,500 men, the Bahrain pearl boat being thus manned on the average by about 19 men. The local sea fisheries are productive and afford a livelihood to a considerable proportion of the coast population. The fish are taken both with nets and in tidal weirs or enclosures called Hadhras made of reeds, some of which surround large areas. Communications and navigation. —The Bahrain islands are travers* able in most directions with riding and pack animals: in irrigated tiacts the water channels, which would otherwise seriously impede movement, are generally sufficiently well bridged. The most important route in the islands is that from Man amah to the two Rifa/s \ wayfarers travelling by it either ford the Maqta'-at-Tubli creek or go round the head of it, 1 mile further west, according to the state of the tide, A table * of the various kinds of craft owned in the ports of Bahrain is given below. © .

COmpared with the e^ate given by Polly in Ms lieport onBAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 245 A word is necessary as to the uses for which these various types of vessels are suitable; a certain number are convertible and are not restricted to one form of employment. Trading vessels are Baghlahs, Bum , Shu^ais and Mashuwahs; pearl boats are chiefly Baqarahs, M ashuwahs^ Sambuks and Batils) cargo lighters are Bums of a wide flat-bottomed species called Tashashil * ferry boats are M ashuwahs and Shu^ais^ and so are fishing boats. It has been ascertained that there are in Bahrain about 100 vessels used for trade which run to Qatlf, 'Oqair, Qatar, Trucial 'Oman and the Persian Coasts some of them even to India, Southern Arabia and Zanzibar; 917 which proceed to the pearl banks; 80 cargo lighters in Manamah harbour, of which half are Bums ; 300 ferry-boats plying chiefly between Manamah and Muharraq Town; and 600 fishing boats. The total of these figures is 1,947, clearly illustrating our statement as to partial convertibility. Manufactures -The leading handicrafts of Bahrain are sailmaking and the manufacture for local sale of woollen 'Abas, lungis both white and coloured, and cheeked sheeting. Matting is woven from fine Hasa reeds and is the best obtainable in the Persian Gulf. A new textile industry has recently sprung up in the manufacture of a striped cotton cloth from which Qabas and Zabuns are made, and the output of this material now amounts to about 100 pieces weekly. Bahrain is famous throughout the Persian Gulf for its boat build* ing, and this industry gives employment to about 200 carpenters. In 1903-04 nearly 130 boats, ranging in price from R300 to R8,000, were sold to purchasers in Qatar and Trucial 'Oman. The timber and nails used in construction are chiefly from India. Foreign trade. —Bahrain is the principal pearl market of the Persian Gulf. It is also an emporium of general trade with the mainland of Arabia ; but its former function is the more important, and it is probable that, if the pearl beds were to fail, the Shaikhdom would shortly be reduced to comparative insignificance. Imports are oyster shells and pearls from the neighbouring seas and coasts ; rice, cotton piece-goods, silk piece-goods, embroidery, spices, coffee, sugar, tea, coir-rope, timber, metals, hardware and haberdashery from India; barley, wheat, ghi, carpets, rosebuds, rose water, firewood, almonds, currants, gram, walnuts, live cattle, sheep and goats and some henna from Persia; fruit and sweetmeats from the Sultanate of 'Oman; 'Abas, dates, ghi and hides from Hasa ; dates, fruits and some sheep and ghi from Qatlf; ghi, sheep, a few 'Abas and a little wool from Kuwait; dates^ ghi Mash,246 BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY wheat, barley, tobaeeo and coarse reed-mats for roofing from Turkish ; rafter® and cocoanuts from East Africa, Of tliese the most important with their values (in lakhs of rupees) in 1905 were pearls (118), rice (26|), cotton piece-goods (9J), dates (9^), coffee (4|), wheat (41), gbi (2 j)j sngar and tobacco (^ ^ each), Abas (14), silk piece-goods (U), slaughter animals (IJ) and timber and wood (1), The slaughter animals are chiefly sheep and goats imported periodically bv about 15 Persian butchers from the Persian COclSt j in 1905 no less 'a) than 14,000 sheep and goats were thus brought over from Persia and 2 ; 050 from Qatlf. An import of arms ; worth 4 lakhs of rupees annually only a few years ago, has now entirely disappeared. The total value of the imports for 1905 was 243 lakhs, of which 103 lakhs were from India and 102 lakhs from Turkish possessions. In the same year 65 steamers in cargo, all British and with an aggregate tonnage of 95,097, entered Manamah, the only steam port of Bahrain. The principal exports with their values (in lakhs of rupees) in 1905 were pearls (161), rice (6), cotton piece-goods (3|), dates (3|) and coffee {H). The pearls go chiefly to Bombay; the dates (of which some are dried and some, called Saluq ; are boiled) to Karachi and the ports of Kathiawar. Oyster shells are sent to the United Kingdom, to Germany, and a few to France. Some sail cloth is exported, mostly to Basrah.; fine reed matting is sent to Persia and Turkish ; IraCl; and a portion of the striped fabrics, already mentioned as locally manufactured, is disposed of in Hasa and Qatlf. In 1905 the total value of exports from Bahrain was 204 lakhs of rupees, of which 129 lakhs &gt; worth went to India and 62 lakhs &gt; worth to Turkish territory. In the same year 35 steamers * cleared from Manamah with cargo; all were British and they had a total tonnage of 54,666* It is calculated that about J of the total goods imported eventually leave the island again for various destinations ; and this at least is clear that the trade of Bahrain is largely a transit trade. In particular Manamah is the steam port for the Qatar promontory, for the Oases of Hasa and Qatif and, through Hasa, for part of Najd as well; the goods despatched to the mainland are chiefly piece-goods, rice, barley, metals, coffee, sugar and spices* About 50 horses per annum pass through Bahrain en route from Najd and Hasa to the Indian market. Until a few years ago donkeys # This does not mean that only half the steamers which called at Bahrain found cargo there. Ihe explanation is that not all the steamers which call take out clearance certificates.BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 247 also were largely exported from Bahrain to Persia; but the diminution of their numbers^ together with the rise of their price in the Bahrain islands, has brought about a cessation for the present of this trade. The trade with Qatar is divided between the towns of Manamah and Muharraq : that with Hasa and Qatif is concentrated at Manamah. Currency, weights and measures. —The currency of the Bahrain princi pality is mixed. Indian coins of all denominations are the most popular and circulate freely; but Maria Theresa dollars or Riyals Jb) are largely current during the pearl season, as the divers, who are mostly Arabs from the mainland, prefer them; and quantities are imported from Bombay to meet the demand. The Riyal is at present (1905) worth normally Re. 1 As. 5^ but it is liable to fluctuations in value of as much as 1 or 2 annas either way. The Turkish Lirah passes at a valuation of Rs. 14. The ordinary unit of small values is however an imaginary coin called the Bahrain Qran ul/ which is worth fths of a rupee. The Tawilah 4^ of the Hasa Oasis is seen and is valued at ^ an anna, but it is not readily accepted. A large quantity of specie from abroad enters Bahrain In 1903 the (ralue of the coin imported was 43 lakhs of rupees, and coin worth 4^ lakhs is known to have left the islands in the same year.

The Dhira' is equivalent to 18| English inches. General administration. —The Government of Bahrain is of a loose and ill-organised character. It is ruled by a Shaikh—at present J Isa-bin- 'Ali—who, with the assistance of a Wazir or principal adviser^ disposes of matters of political or general importance and personally governs, unless when absent on sporting expeditions to the mainland, the island of Muharraq and the part of Bahrain Island which is adjacent to Manamah. During four months in the hot weather the Shaikh has his seat at Manamah : his headquarters during the rest.of the year are at Muharraq Town, but he indulges in frequent journeys. A brother, sons, nephews and other near relations hold fiefs in various places, of which they have almost independent possession for life; upon these estates they collect taxes for their own behoof and exercise magisterial and seignorial jurisdiction. The most important semi-independent holding of this sort at the present time is in the hands of the Shaikh's brother Khalid j it includes the islands of Sitrah and Nabi Salih^ as well as all the villages on the east side of Bahrain Island to the south of Ehor-al- Kabb and the inland villages of RifaZ-ash-Sharqi and Eifa'-al-Gharbi. These fiefs are resumable at the death of the holder ; in theory, at least, there is no obligation to continue them in favour of heirs. Class disabilities and 'privileges. —Under the regime of the Shaikh and his relations the condition of the Baharinah, who form the bulk of the cultivating class in the principality, is unhappy. They are subject to a constant Sukhrah or corvee which affects their persons, their boats and their animals ; their position in regard to the land is that of serfs rather than of tenants at will; and if they fail to deliver a certain amount of pioduce, which is often arbitrarily enhanced by the Shaikh's servants and relations, they are summarily evicted from their homes and in some cases are beaten and imprisoned as well. Some of the Baharinah are in theory landowners, having been allowed in the past to purchaseBAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 249 gardens and obtain Sanads for the same; but their estates are often resumed for no valid reason : even the sons of the present ruler have been guilty of this injustice. The crops of the Baharinah are frequently stolen by the Bedouins who range the island, or are damaged by their animals. It does not appear that the Baharinah are ever put to death without a regular trial by a Qadhi; but there is reason to suspect that deaths due to ill-treatment sometimes occur among them, and their women are apt to be molested by the Shaikh^s servants. If oppressed beyond endurance the Baharinah might emigrate to the Qatlf Oasis, and a consciousness of this possibility is the principal check upon the inhumanity of their masters. The position of the Dawasir of Budaiya' and Zallaq is somewhat peculiai. With their neighbours the Baharinah they have little to do ; and their relations with the Shaikh of Bahrain are distant though not unfriendly. They insist on being dealt with through their own chiefs, and they have given the Shaikh of Bahrain clearly to understand that, if he should take any action affecting them of which they disapprove^ they will quit Bahrain in a body. It is considered, however, that the extensive purchases of date plantations which four or live of their head men have made of late years in the vicinity of their settlements now render this threat difficult, if not impossible, of fulfilment. The Bedouins, chiefly Na^im^ of whose presence the islands are never free and whose number reaches its maximum in the hot weather, are a cause of much trouble and annoyance to the settled inhabitants; but they are patronised and encouraged by the Shaikh from an idea, pro bably erroneous^ that they would rally to his side in an emergency. Religious and legal institutions * —The Shaikh of Bahrain and his family and tribe are Sunnis, and the Sunni form of Islam consequently enjoys, as it were, official recognition and preference. Serious cases of a criminal nature and important cases of civil law not relating to mercantile transactions or to the pearl fisheries are referred by the Shaikh to an official chief Qadhi—at present Jasim-bin-Mahza-' of Manamah— who is a Sunni j and, provided that the whole of the parties are Bahrain subjects, the fact that some of them may be Shi'ahs does not affect the established procedure in this respect. Minor cases, especially those of a civil character, are sent for settlement, if both parties are Sunnis, to Shaikh Sharaf-bin-Ahmad of Muharraq, Sunni; and, if both parties are Shf ahs, to Shaikh . * The Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for April 1901 contain some information under this head.25Q BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY Ahmad-bin^Hutz of Manamah, Shi'ak: to this extent the right of Shi'ahs to have their eases disposed of by, co-religionists is recognised. The secular arm is brought into play by the Shaikh to enforce the findings, on the criminal side, of these various judges; the latter, unfortunately, are reported to discharge their functions 'with the maximum of injustice/'* Besides the legal experts whose names have just been mentioned, there are at the present time in Bahrain 7 other Sunni Qadhis and 2 Qadhis of the Shi'ah persuasion who are permitted by the Shaikh to adjudicate on cases which the contesting parties may agree to refer to them. It is believed that, in criminal matters, the headmen of Sunni tribes other than those residing in the towns of Manamah and Muharraq wield considerable magisterial powers j and it is probable that landowners of the Shaikh's family and their agents exercise a similar authority in regard to the agricultural Baharinah. It is understood that the Baharinah, who, as we have seen, are not generally landowners, are accustomed to submit their matrimonial cases and petty disputes about moveable property for settlement to their village Mullas. M ercantile cases, especially those in which foreigners are concerned, are decided by a tribunal f called variously the Majlis-al-'Urfl or Majlis-at-Tijarah that is the Customary or the Commercial Court. This body, of which the permanent members are nominated by the Shaikh in consultation with the British Political Agent, possibly had its origin in arrangements made long since for settling by arbitration claims which arose between British subjects and persons amenable to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain J; but it has now existed for at least 50 years, and has come to be regarded as the only authority in the islands competent to settle mercantile suits. In practice such suits, if both parties are Bahrain subjects and the dispute is one of fact only, are often irregularly settled by the relations or servants of the Shaikh; but all questions of principle, by which the interests of foreigners might afterwards be affected, are referred to the Majlis for decision, and the Shaikh admits a moral obligation to make use of the Majlis on all suitable occasions. When one or more of the parties to a case is a British subject, or when none of the parties are Bahrain subjects, the Majlis is ordinarily convoked by the British * Since the political crisis of February 1905 the adniinistration of justice in Bahrain has somewhat improved. Public opinion on the subject is growing more powerful, largely in consequence cf a steady influx of protected foreigners. t Regarding the MRjlifj, etc., see letters from Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, No 76 of 25th February and No. 516 of 4th March 1906; the Govern ment of India's Foreign Proceedings for April 1901 may also be consulted. J Some authorities, however, suppose it to be a purely indigenous institution.BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY 251 Political A gent and sits at the Eritisli Political Agency, but la represen tative of the Shaikh is allowed to be present, and his presence is occasionally requested by one of the parties; the finding in such circumstances becomes operative only after it has been approved by the British Political Agent. Cases arising out of pearl diving operations or the pearl trade are determined by a board of arbitration, known as the Salifat-al-Ghaus, of which the constitution and powers are described in another place. * Judicial fees (called Khidmah ) ar e levied, sometimes by the Qadhis, sometimes by the Amirs or Bazaar Masters of the Ma nam ah and Muharraq towns, and sometimes (particularly in large cases) by the Shaikh himself. In small cases the plaintiff generally pays Khid mah on the amount of his decree; but sometimes he is made to pay 10 per cent, on the amount of his claim, even if he does not obtain a decree in full. If the plaintiff loses his case Khidmah is not taken, unless it had been recovered in advance* In large cases the Shaikh is careful always to take Khidmah in advance. Finance, f The budget of the Bahrain principality is at the present time, in rough outline, as follows } :— Receipts. Expenditure. Sea customs. Agricultural dues (viz., the pro duce of state gardens and a tax called JNob on the gardens of private individual from whom it can be col lected). Tax on pearl boats. Judicial fees, succession duty (at 10 pet cent.) on all estates transferred by inheritance, etc. Rent of towii lands, shops and Khans. Miscellaneous (including secret extortions).

It will be observed that the above is the budget of the Shaikh of Bahrain alone^ and that the column of receipts does not include the amounts which are wrung by fief-holders of the Shaikh^s family from the villages situated in their estates. A poll tax called Taraz jl^Jo is among the additional imposts to which the agricultural Baharinah are at times subjected. In the Sunni villages as a rule^ and especially in those where one tribe largely predominates^ there is either no taxation at all or the proceeds go to the tribal chief instead of to the Shaikh of Bahrain or members of his family. Military and naval -Altogether the Shaikh of Bahrain and his principal relations and servants maintain about 540 armed men, distributed somewhat as follows : — Shaikh ; lsa-bin-'Ali, Shaikh of Bahrain . . 200 Shaikh Khalid ; brother of 'Tsa , , 4 ,100 Shaikh Hamad, son of ^Isa Shaikh Muhammad, son of ^Isa Shaikh ^Abdullah, son of ^Isa . The Bazaar Master of Manamah The Bazaar Master of Muharraq 80 30 30 50 50 Total 540 Of this force about 200 men are armed with rifles, but the remainder, if they possess firearms at all, have only matchlocks : all, however, carry swords. For the defence of his dominions from foreign aggression^ however, and for the maintenance of order within, the Shaikh depends not so milch on these retainers as on the Na'im tribe, of whom he pro fesses to have large numbers at call. In point of fact the Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar only amount to about 400 fighting men all told, and of these more than half are generally absent in Qatar^ while not more than 100 out of the whole number are mounted. The Shaikh, as already mentioned, has a small but excellent stud of Arab mares, and he and his family own about 100 riding camels. Till lately he possessed several fast-sailing but unarmed Batils, of which 2 or 3 were ordinarily placed at the disposal of the customs conti actors for the prevention of smuggling*; these,, however, have nowBAHElYAH 253 disappeared, and when the Shaikh requires a boat he takes one by Sukhrah. Tolitical position and foreign interests. —The treaty relations of the Shaikh of Bahrain are exclusively with the Indian Government, who maintain at Manama!^ as their local representative, a European officer of their Political Department having the local rank of Agent : this Agent is subordinate to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The maintenance of a charitable medical dispensary, built by local contribu tions and known as the Victoria Memorial Hospital^ was undertaken by the Government of India from 1905, and the institution itself has been attached to the Political Agency. There is also a British post office connected with the Agency. British subjects ordinarily resident in Bahrain at the present time, inclusive of officials but exclusive of an Indian military guard for the Agency, are : European British subjects, 2 ; Eurasians, 4 ; Native Chris tians, 2; Hindus, 69 ; Muhammadans, 122 ; Jews, 5. In the hot weather the number of Hindus under British protection rises to about 175, and that of Muhammadans to 150. One British mercantile firm and 2 British steamship companies are represented in the islands; and there are 22 resident Hindu and 11 resident Muhammadan traders who are under British protection. After the political and commercial interests of Britain in Bahrain, the interests of the United States, arising from a mission of the Reformed (Dutch) Church of America, are the most important; this mission, which is at Manamah, was founded in 1893. Of more recent origin, and less extensive, are the German interests represented by a cpmmercial firm. A n • ^ A small island in the Shatt-al-'Arab close to its right bank at a t ut T R . T little more than 6 miles below the mouth of the Karun ; immediately YAH below it is Gat'ah Island^ from which a small channel only divides it; ^ ^ and opposite to it, on the other side of the main stream, is the upper end of Haji Salbuq Island. Bahriyah lies off the centre of the tract called Gat'ah on the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab ; its length, up and down stream, is a little over half a mile ; its breadth is considerably less. The inhabitants, who belong to various tribes and live in huts, number254 BAHMYAH _or BFAH SJtXi about 80 souls. They possess about half a dozen cattle^ a score of sheep and goats and 30 date trees besides fruit trees of other kinds. Bahriyah is in Turkish territory: it is owned by the present Shaikh of Muham- march and by the family of 'Abdul Wahhab. BArAH A village on the coast of the Euus-al-Jibal District in the ' Oman Sultanate j the mountains rise behind it at a distance of about 1^ miles It consists of about 45 / &gt; houses of Shihuh; nearly all of the Bani Shatair but a few of the Bani Hadiyah section^ and is situated in Dibah bay about 1 mile north of Hisn-ad-Dibah or Dibah proper, but it is sometimes regarded as a part of Dibah. From the sea the two places appear to form one town with a background of date palms, but in reality they are separated by a watercourse up which the sea runs for about 200 yards. The inhabitants live by date-cultivation and fishing and own about 14 sea-going Sambuks which carry dates and fish to Masqat Town and places in the Persian Gulf. A little wheat, barley and sweet potato is grown both in the date gardens and behind the town, and dates are exported. There is one provision shop kept by a Persian. Bai'ah is the southernmost village in Ruus-al-Jibal on the eastern side of the ' Oman Promontory, but it is controlled by a Shaikh appointed from Kumzar. BAIDHAH A cr eek on the coast of Trucial ' Oman which, leaving the sea half- rTTTHTv!?^ wa y between Jazfrat - al - Hamr a and Umm-al .Qaiwain, runs parallel to (KHOR-AL -J the coast for 4 miles at a distance of 1 mile inland and terminates in the bay of Umm-al -Qaiwain, entering the same at its north -eastern corner. The island thus formed is known as Siniyah ^ and belongs to the Umm-al -Qaiwain Principality ; it has no date trees but contains the ruins of two deserted villages, namely -Mallah -JL a t the north-east end, where there is an unoccupied fort belonging to the Shaikh of Umm-al' Qalwain, and Siniyah at the south-eastern extremity, where an old mosque may be seen. It is said that scarcity of water obliged the inhabit- ants to migrate to Umm-al -Qaiwain Town. The Shaikh of Umm-al- Qaiwain sometimes goes hawking on the island.A??) bakhtit A ri tribe 255 A very short valley in the Masqat District of the Sultanate : it begins 3 or 4 miles south and a little west of Masqat Town^ runs 3| miles to the north-west and then turns due north reaching the sea at Darsait 2^ miles from the bend. The only places in this W adi are Darsait at its mouth and Bait-al-Falaj, from which it takes its name, 1 4 miles from the sea. Ruwi is close to the left bank of Wadi Bait-al-Falaj at a point 3 miles from the sea ; but its lands mostly drain to Wadi 'Adai, in which we have included it. Bait«al-Falaj village isl^ miles from Mat rah Town ; its main feature (and raison d^etre) is a large fortified residence of the Sultan of 'Oman, who comes to live here in the hot weather. There are young date plantations watered by Falajs from the Wadi, Saih-al-Harmal 5 and Ruwi. A village has sprung up on the north-east side of the fort; it contains some stone houses and a considerable number of less substantial dwellings, about 30 in all. The inhabitants are 'Awamir and are mostly connected with the garrison: they possess 60 camels, 30 donkeys, 7 0 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. The situation of Bait-al-Palaj is open and airy for this district and there is convenient access to the sea both at Darsait and at Matrah ; with the latter Bait-al-Falaj is connected by a road running through a natural opening in the hills which is called Kbarasbif . BAIT-AIr FALAJ (WADI) Wl C' An important division of the Lur race; they have their headquarters in the mountains between Shushtar and Isfahan, but are found also in the districts of Dizful, Shushtar and Ramuz in Northern 'Arabistan and in the plain of 'Aqili. In all these localities some Bakhtiyaris are permanently settled, while others make their appearance as cold weather visitors and camp mostly to the south of Ab Bid between that place and the Diz river. The plural of the name is Bakhtiyariha . Divisions and distribution in 1 Arahistan. —The sections of the Bakhtiyari tribe form two groups known as the Haftlang c&amp;i and the Chaharlang ; the ruling chiefs of the whole tribe at the present time belong to a section which is included in the H aftlang group. The sections most frequently met with in Northern ^Arabistan are perhaps the Shir 'Ali ^ jxl and Talawari , who belong to the Ghaharlang group, as do also a section or incorporated tribe called Zanganeh . These three sections are all represented in the Ramuz District, BAKHTI YARI TRIBE256 BAKHTIYAEJ TRIBE of which the population is largely Bakhtiyari; but in the Shushtar District the settled Bakhtiyaris, almost without exception, are members of the Shir ; Ali section. Bakhtiyaris are found in the Dizful District permanently established in the villages of Ab Bid, Asad Khan (I), Biyawtiyun, Chugheh Sabz, Chugheh Surkh ; i3ubandar, Kaunak, Khusrauabad, Kutiyan, Najafabad, Salarabad, Sar Bishell, Shahabad, m Shalgahi Buzurg and Kuchik, Shami, Shamsabad and Siyah Mansur, ^ of some of which they have exclusive possession. In the Shushtar District they occur at the villages of Gotwand, Jallakan and Pahwindeli; at Shalaili Buzurg and Kuchik, Qurumizi, Hasmawa, Chahargaweh, 'Abdullah Jarrah, Sufan, 'Abbas, Hilaleh, Sozi and Saiyid Hasan on the Gargar; at Kunarpir, Lungur, Mahdiabad, Qal'eh Nan, Kut Saiyid and Tabatti in Miyanab ; and at Buraki and Yissareh on the Shatait: a few live also in Shushtar Town. There are a few Shir ; Ali Bakhtiyaris in the Hindiyan District at Gargari Balai. Political organisation and position in } Arabistan.— l^iQ political headship of the Bakhtiyaris is vested in two chiefs, the Ilkhani or paramount chief and the Ilbaigi or second chief, both of whom are recognised by the Persian Government j the present Ilkbani isNajaf Quli Khan, Samsam-us-Saltaneh, while the Ilbaigi is his cousin, Ghulam Husain Khan, Shahab-us-Saltaneh. The Ilkhani and Ilbaigi are however only two, out of a large number of Khans, relations- all of whom are deemed to be chiefs of the tribe. To the Khans belong, besides almost the whole of the Ramuz District, the villages of Ab Bid, Kutiyan and Sar Bisheh, part of the village of Kaunak and a water mill at ^Abdush Shah, all in the Dizful District; the plain of 'Aqili^ Gotwand and Jallakan in the Shushtar District j and 'Arab Hasan, Shaikh Jarrah and the site (at present deserted) of Chahardingeh on the Shatait. Each Khan is accustomed to administer the tracts which he owns, and in spring the principal Khans generally encamp in the neighbourhood of Ab Bid and take charge of the whole surrounding country; during the anarchy which prevailed in 1904 they even undertook the protection of the route between Shushtar and Dizful and maintained an armed guard at Shushtar. The Bakhtiyari Khans are responsible to the Persian Government for the revenue and administration of the Ramuz District, where they own much property and enjoy a good reputation as considerate and progressive landlords ; and 'Alwaniyeh and Eaghaiweh on the borders of the Ahwaz District of Southern 'Arabistan are also within their jurisdiction.

Apart from land revenue in agricultural districts^ the Bakhtiyaris are said to pay an annual assessment of 16,700 Tumans to the Persian Government. General. —A favourable opinion was formerly entertained by British officers of the Bakhtiyaris^ who were described as a manly and spirited tribe; but closer political relations with them in recent years have caused them to appear rather in the light of truculent, avaricious and quarrelsome savages. They are submissive to the authority of their Khans ; but the only bonds are those of money and fear, recalcitrant subjects being coerced by spoliation and force of arms; little, if any, loyalty towards the chiefs fill a ,c: idE an, Sotl 3nt j ie ^ is apparent which is not due to the dictates of immediate self-interest. ^ The Khans appear to greater advantage as landlords in the Ramuz District. They are not always at accord among themselves. The total fighting strength of the Bakhtiyaris is about 20,000 men: of these a very few are armed with rifles of recent patterns, perhaps IlklT l&gt;ave Martinis, and the rest carry smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns ^ ^ of native manufacture. About 2 ,000 men are serviceably mounted and some others possess inferior ponies. A good many mules and horses , .. ^ are bred by the tribe and some of these find their way to India through Muhammareh. The speech of the Bakhtiyaris is a dialect of Persian. For more exact information in regard to the distribution of the i i', 101,111 Bakhtiyaris in'Arabistan and the property owned there by the chiefs the reader is referred to the articles in this Gazetteer on the districts of li l mentioned.

The Balarud, after irrigating the tract known as evei ^ aZra ' e h Salihabad in theDizful District, passes 5 miles west of Dizful ^I 1 Wand then 1 mile east of Bunwar Nazir; it finally joins the Diz ' lafiJ^ yer ^ I0m wes ^ a 11 niiles below Dizful Town. The 5 Amleh Karlm Khan is partly irrigated from the Balarud. JJie bed of the Balarud is coarse shingle; in summer the Balarud is dry258 BALARtTD except in pools ; in autumn it becomes a flowing stream supplying many camps of Sagwand Lurs ; after heavy rain it is apt to become impassable for one or two days. Throughout this Gazetteer the name Baluchi^ sanctioned by Englisli usage, is used to designate the race or tribes which form the subject of this article : but the correct form of the word in Baluchistan is Balocli ( SjIj , both for the singular and for the plural, and there the term Balochi refers only to the language spoken by the Baloch. In Arabic the name is Balush in the plural and Balushi ^ in the singular. In Baluchistan the name Baloch is strictly employed to designate certain respectable middle-class tribes of the country only ; but in the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman, and consequently throughout this Gazetteer (except in places in the articles relating to Persian Makran), it is used in a wider sense to include immigrants from Baluchistan generally and persons whose &gt; mother tongue is the Baluchi language. The principal tribes of Baluchis proper represented in the area covered by this Gazetteer are the Buzdars, Hots, Kalmatis, Lattis, Mullais, Bais, Rinds, Sangurs and Shaizadahs, who are scarcely if ever mentioned by their tribal names outside the limits of Persian Makran, also the Jadgals who in Baluchis. tan are reckoned Baluchis, but elsewhere, and especially in the 'Oman Sultanate, are generally distinguished under their proper name from other Baluchis. In the political divisions of the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman Baluchis are found chiefly in the Sultanate of 'Oman, where their number is roughly estimated at 20,000, or, including Jadgals, at 30,000 souls. In Trucial Oman they appear to number about 1,400, and in Turkish ; Iraq about 3,000 persons; in the intermediate regions of Qatar, Bahrain, Hasa and Kuwait they are a negligeable element; and in Najd they are apparently not found. A few occur in Southern 'Arabistan, chiefly as mercenaries and dependents of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. On the Persian Coast they are few until the district of Shamil is reached, in which and in the Minab District they form an appreciable part of the population. The district of Biyaban is, like the whole of Persian Makran, almost altogether a country of Baluchis in the wider sense of the term as explained above. The Baluchis even abroad are seldom Shi'ahs, and they settle more readily among Arab than among Persian communities. Some remarks on(Sr) BAQA'A 259 those in the 'Oman Sultanate will be found in the article on that country, and the article on Turkish 'Iraq explains the distribution of the Baluchis domiciled there. h termj Aratl; gular. onlyjluti ■t tt ( jji Jran), iti langeml i.

BARAIMI OASIS* In English formerly spelt ' Brymee/' a remarkable oasis in the district of Jan, in a tract situated between the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial 'Oman which may be described as Independent 'Oman; it was ui formerly known also as Tuwamlyah , but this name has fallen into disuse. Position and extent, —The exact situation by latitude and longitude of Jimi, one of the most central villages in the oasis, is given in the table of villages below; it shows the oasis to lie a little south of a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi 3 about 65 miles west by south of the former, and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The plain of Baraimi is bordered on the north by the wilderness of Ramlat Kahal; on the east by well-wooded plains and small ridges of hills belonging to the district of Jau ; on the south by Jabal Hafit; and on the west by the first dunes of an ocean of sand that stretches without interruption to the coast of Abu Dhabi. The oasis is nearly circular and its diameter is about six miles. InJiahitants and villages population of Baraimi amounts to about 5,500 souls, of whom the greater number are Dhawahir, some are Na'im and a few areBani Yas. The general condition of the people is poor, probably in consequence of tribal warfare and chronic insecurity • The map for the Baraimi Oasis is Boute taken hy Major P.

Milk is abundant, and a hard cream cheese is made, the juice of the euphorbia being sometimes used instead of rennet.

C OX.)BARAIMI OASIS 263 The villages are unwalled and consist of liouses ; built of mud and date branches; which are scattered and concealed among the plantations. Besides those occupied there are many empty and dilapidated habitations. Agriculture. —The general aspect of the oasis is verdant and fruitful. The soil though thin is fertile^ and streams of running water abound on every side; these are brought by Palaj from the hills, sometimes several miles distant, and supply the deficiency of the slight rainfall. Each village has its separate belt of date groves; within the village the sub division of arable land among owners is minute, and individual holdings are on the average extremely small. Attention has been devoted with success to the culture of dates and other fruits; of cereals and vegetables the quantity and quality are at best moderate^ Some of the best varieties of date are grown, including the Fard, Khalas and Mibsali sorts; but they are not held in equal estimation with the produce of Wadi Samailand Badiyall in the 'Oman Sultanate; The palms of the oasis number about 60,000. Fruits other than dates are lemons, sour and sweet limes, pomegranates, water melons, musk melons, bananas, mangoes, grapes, figs and olives : the papai also exists. Cereals are wheat and barley in spring, and jowari and millet in autumn ; vegetables include sweet potatoes, radishes, brinjals, beans, onions and garlic. Pulse, cotton—both of the white and the red flowered varieties—and lucerne yielding 8 to 9 crops a year are among the other products. Leguminous plants are not here sown among cereals, but follow them in rotation on the same ground stubble, too, is ploughed in and never burnt. It is said that coffee was once cultivated on the slopes of Jabal Hafit, but the plantations, if any ever existed, have now disappeared. Livestoclc, —Horses are only seen in the possession of Shaikhs, and cattle too are somewhat scarce; but camels are cheap and abundant, and donkeys are largely in use both as riding animals and as beasts of burden. The villages of the oasis are reckoned to possess in the aggregate about 50 horses, 550 camels, 300 donkeys, 300 cattle and 2,500 sheep and goats. Besides these a number of horses, said to be as many as 100, are ordinarily kept by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the Oasis. Trade* —There are few or no professional traders, but a primitive local market is held each afternoon in one of the quarters of Baraimi Village • here commodities mostly change hands by barter. The foreign trade of Baraimi passes chiefly through the port of Sharjah, which is distant nearly 80 miles north-north-west wards, but also to some extent through the other coast towns of Dhabi, Dibai and Sohar.264 BARAIMI OASIS Political position.—QaxMrai is independent, but the influence of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is [strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired (and is now engaged in developing) an estate at Jahali 5 while Mas'udiis being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover a regular tribute, of which the form and amount are mentioned in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, is paid him by the Dhawahir who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Shaikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so, but his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Na'im are the original owners of the oasis, and possession of the fort in Baraimi Village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manasir of the Abu Khail subsection frequent the Baraimi Oasis or its neighbourhood in summer. BARAIMI The original and most central village of the Baraimi Oasis. It consists of 9 quarters stretching northwards from a fort which may be APP* re ^ arc ^ as one them. The quarters are given below in alphabetical oi'der; they are mostly inhabited by Na'im of the Qaratisah and other sections, and the population may be estimated at 500 souls altogether.

There is also a quarter called Hamasah on the west of the Qasr. Except the fort none of these quarters are walled : some of the houses are of mud and some are huts of date branches. There is no bazaar except that mentioned as situated in the Hillah quarter. The resources of the village are estimated at 100 camels, 50 donkeys, 50 cattle, 500 sheep and goats and 10,000 date palms. The Baraimi fort consists of a square with sides about 150 feet in length : the whole construction is of sun-dried brick. At each corner stands a tower about 40 feet high ; but the curtains connecting the towers are less than ^0 feet in height. A ditch 25 feet broad surrounds the place: both the scarp and counter-scarp are'steep and faced with brick. Two wells in the interior yield water, apparently of good quality and sufficient for a large garrison. The situation of the fort, standing in a plain, is generally good ; but on the north and west it is too nearly adjoined by houses and cultivation, and on the opposite side the ruins of another fort were (in 1875) capable of affording shelter to an attacking force. A wooden gate in the south face was (in 1875) the weakest feature of the work. The Baraimi fort is not equal to the best of those in the Sultanate of 'Oman, but it is the key of the ; 0inan Sultanate on the west, and must necessarily, as has been observed, be reduced or masked by an invader of the Sultanate approaching from that direction. A considerable town on the coast of the Batinah district of the BAUKAl! Oman Sultanate : it lies about 43 miles west by north of Masqat Town ^ud is on the east side of Wadi Ma'awal at its moutlu The place extends266 BARKAH along the shore for about 3 miles and consists mostly of huts scattered among the date-plantations. There is no harbour, only an open road stead. In the centre of the place rises a lofty fortress with flankino 1 - • ^ towers at the angles. The houses surrounding the fort on east, south and west number about 1,200, but some of them are empty and the population of the town may be estimated at about 5 ,000 souls. The inhabitants of the eastern quarters are chiefly Dawakah, Muwalik and Mashafirah with some A1 Hamad and Siyabiym; in the neighbourhood of the fort the population is mixed ; the western quarters are tenanted by Hirth, Ghawarib, Ma'awal, Muwalik, A1 Badar, Hikman and Bani Bu Hasan. There are also some Daru'. These Arab tribes (except the Muwalik, most of whom are found here) number on the average only 20 households each and their number is exceeded by that of the Baluchis and Jadgfals who form the remainder of the population. A few Khojahs also are found, and there are. 11 Hindus, the latter representing 6 commercial concerns and enjoying British protection. Many of the Arabs are Bedouins,—still owning cattle, sheep and camels,—who have settled down and acquired date-plantations ; and some should be classed as a rural rather than as an urban population, occupying as they do a great part of the country between the town and the promontory opposite the Suwadi islands. Temporary Bedouin visitors are also numerous. In the date-season the population of Barkah is swelled by immigrants from Mas qat Town and elsewhere who come to work as harvesters. Barkah is cele brated chiefly for its dates. The groves extend continuously from Wadi Manumah 6 miles east of the town, to Wadi-al-Qasim some 10 miles to westward of it, and the trees number 40,000 or more. There is also some ordinary cultivation; and in the month of August large quantities of a shell-fish called Dok , resembling a cockle, are collected and dried in the sun for export to the interior. Live-stock are 6 horses, 700 camels, 200 donkeys, 500 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. The bazaar contains over 100 shops dealing in ordinary wares. Barkah possesses jiO large Badans and is the port of the villages in Wadis Lajal and Ma awal and partially of those in Wadis Tau and Bani KharuS, as also of the town of Nakhl. The place is governed by a Wali with a salary of $1,800 a year on behalf of the Sultan of 'Oman, who also maintains in the fort a garrison of 20 men commanded by an 5 Aqid. The customs of the port produce about $3,000 a year and $1,800 is realised as Zakat; the former amount is locally expended, and of the latter only $1/200 leaches the Sultan s treasury. The customs here have been under direct management, instead of being farmed, since 1901-02.bAsIdu 267 A village, formerly chef-lieu of the Qadha of Shamiyah. in Turkish BA'RUR ^Iraq; it is situated 17 or 18 miles east by south of the town of Najaf in (UMM-AL-) the marshes which compose the Shamiyah district. The population of ^ ' Umm-al-Ba^rur is now very small, and the majority of the inhabitants, ^ ^ though the place was till lately the administrative headquarters of a Qadha, merely inhabit reed huts. Umm-al-Ba ; rur is regarded as un healthy and was abandoned by the administration for this reason. Its place has been taken by Hamidiyah , a town which has sprung up on the left bank of the Abu Kufuf canal about 2 miles above Umm- al-Ba'rur. Hamidiyah is said to contain 800 houses, 150 shops, 3 mosques., 3 Khans and 10 granaries, also a Government Saraiand barracks. Anglice ' Bassadore/ ; a British station situated on the westernmost BASIDU* point, similarly named, of Qishm Island and about 25 miles east by north of Lingeh Town. It includes a native village called Bandar Singau jAw about 1 mile to eastward of the remains of the principal settle ment described below. The village of Nakhlistan, mentioned in the article on Qishm Island, lies just outside the station and to the east of it. Basidu Point is of low clifE rising 20 feet above high-water mark, is level on the top, and carries a few date-trees ; it is an airy position open to ail the winds that blow. The station has been practically unoccupied since the abolition of the Indian naval squadron; but three reservoirs, a jetty extending to low-water mark, and a rifle-range laid out to 600 yards still exist. There are also a small building on which the Union Jack is hoisted daily, ^ of a mile south of the point, and a graveyard which is maintained in good order. The former officers^ quarters, hospi tal, sepoy lines, bazaar and store houses have been allowed to fall into decay, being no longer required. There were never any permanent defences, and the only establishment now existing for the public service is a small coal depot in charge of a Native Agent who is also responsible for the flag and receives a salary from the Indian Government. The * Plans of Basidu and its immediate surroundings are included in the Govern ment of India's Foreign Proceedings for July 1902. See also Admiralty Chart, No. 2376-35, Bdsldu. A discussion of the boundaries of the British station will he found in the former place (as also in the Proceedings for January 1902), and a view of the approach from seaward in the latter. Some remarks on Basidu by Sir L. Dane and Admiral Atkinson-Willes are contained in the Foreign Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1904 and a general report by Lieutenant V. Hunt in those for August 1901.268 BASlDU population of this part of the station is now only about 30 souls: it consists of natives who inhabit some scattered mat huts. Bandar Singau^ above mentioned, falls within the bounds of Britisli jurisdiction. The people are fugitive slaves and gain a living as fisher men and weavers of Lungis : they possess 6 boats. The village has no trade and affords few supplies except water, for the collection of which there are 8 reservoirs. There were formerly about 200 huts here, but now nearly all are in ruins, and the population has fallen to about 20 souls. The reason for the decline of Bandar Singau is that residence there is now discouraged by the British authorities lest the place should become a base for the operations of smugglers in Persia, The anchorage at Basidu extends parallel to the shore on the north side of the point and consists of a belt J of a mile broad at J of a mile from the shore : the depth is 5 to 7 fathoms and the bottom, of clay, is good holding-ground. The landing is inconvenient in a swell on account of the rockiness of the coast, and at low water on account of a mud-flat which is then uncovered. Outside the anchorage lies a channel 12 to 16 fathoms deep called the ' Gut, ^ in which vessels avoid anchoring. Protection against the Shamal, which here blows from south-west by west, is given by the northern point of Beacon Shoal, a narrow bank which curves round the west end of Qishm Island from Basidu point for two-thirds of the way to Has Dastakan ; of this bank the northern half, about 2 4 miles long, is dry at low water and has its extremity marked by a beacon. There is a deep but narrow and unnavi- gable channel between Beacon Shoal and the coast of the island. Other important features of the approaches to Basidu are the North Bank and the Plat. The North Bank is a westward prolongation of the middle shoal of Clarence strait which has its final ending in the sea 7 miles west-south-west of Basidu point. The Plafc is a great bank carrying 2 to 3 fathoms at low water and lying round the whole south-western corner of Qishm Island. It extends for more than 20 miles along the coast) about i of its length covering the western and the remainder the southern side of the island, and its northern end overlaps the south end of Beacon Shoal and is outside it. The main entrance to the Basidu roadstead begins between the Plat and the North Bank where it is 2 miles wide and has 3| fathoms of water ; it then runs between Beacon Shoal and the North Bank, deepening as it goes to 7, and eventually to 9 fathoms. There is a passage between the south coast of the island and the Plat joining the ordinary entrance at Beacon Shoal; it contains a channel of 4 to 41 fathoms, but this channel is not easy to find nor is1V11) W BASRAH QADHA 269 ^ 301, 1 it suitable for vessels so large as a second-class cruiser, though it might be used by such in clear weather,* 9 c 'hlili tliat 3 on tfci it j ofi in a« n accflit ! h atk k vessels i 3re hi Be^il in IsM njoitiii ir ani Is ortlEil The headquarters division of the Basrah Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish 'IrSq. Position and boundaries. —The Oadha of Basrah is situated on both sides of the Shatt-al-'Arab and extends from a few miles above Basrah Town down to Zain on the right and down to the Persian frontier upon the left bank. It is bounded by the Qadha of Qurnah on the north, by Persian territory upon the east, by the Qadha of Fao upon the south, and by deserts upon the west. Topography and inhabitants. —The most populous and important place in the Qadha is the town of Basrah, to which a separate article is devoted: but Hamdan, Abul Khasib and Zubair also are towns of considerable size and consequence, and there are numerous large villages such as Khorah, Muhaijaran, Sablliyat and Abu Mughairah upon the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab and Da'aiji upon the left bank. The region is probably the most densely inhabited in Turkish 'Iraq and even in the whole Persian Gulf. The main feature of the district and that to which it owes its entire character is the Shatt-al-'Arab, in the article upon which and its islands will be found detailed topographical informa tion about the whole Qadha. The rural tribes in the settlements irrigated by the river are chiefly 'Atub, 'Idan and Muhaisin. ?ovulation,— fixed population of the Qadha appears to be as follows, according to the Nahiyahs of which the positions are explained in the paragraph on administration below :— j mik 1 to 96' e iM , it«i&lt; 50 Nahiyah of 'Arab (Shatt-al-) „ Basrah {i .e., Basrah Town) „ Hartbah „ Khasib (Abul) „ Zubair [i .e., Zubair Town) 17,000 58,000 12,500 56,500 6,000 Total . 150,000 souls.

Resources. —The Zubair Nahiyah is situated in the desert, but the other Nahiyahs together constitute one of the richest date-producing tracts in the world. Some cereals are grown in the more open lands, and lucerne and vegetables are cultivated among the date trees. Livestock also are abundant and include buffaloes. Administration. —This large as well as populous Qadha has no separate Qaim-Maqam; being the Markaz Qadha of the Basrah Sanjaq—which is the Markaz Sanjaq, in its turn, of the Wilayat— it is, according to the usual Turkish arrangement, in direct charge of the Wali of Basrah. The Qadha is subdivided^ as we have already seen, into 5 Nahiyahs. Two of these are simply the towns of Basrah and Zubair: the others are Harthah, which extends along the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab from the borders of the Qadha of Qurnah to Basrah Town; Abul Khasib, which reaches along the same bank from Basrah Town to Zain, the latter being included,—that is to the commence ment of the Fao Qadha; and Shatt-al-'Arab, which occupies the left bank of the river from the limits of tke Qurnah Qadha down to the Persian frontier. The name is believed to mean ' the Black Pebbles.-' Basrah is the second town of Turkish ^ Iraq in political and commercial importance and perhaps in population; in all these respects it is inferior to Baghdad, and in the last it is possibly equalled by Karbala. Basrah is the chef-Ueu of the Turkish Wilayat similarly named, and such influence as the Ottoman Government possess in Eastern Arabia and even in Najd is exerted chiefly from Basrah. Old Basrah, which occupied a different site from the modern, was famous for its schools of theological and philosophical learning; but the present Basrah can lay no claim to any kind of erudition. Fosition and site, —Basrah,—the position of which, as the town is rather scattered, we may take to be that of the British Consulate,—is * The best map is Flan of Basrah and its Environs from a Turkish Survey, 1905 numbered 1389 in the Foreign Department Library, Simla.BASRAH TOWN 271 ^ ^ 1 about %% miles west by north of the neighbouring Persian provincial ^ capital of Muliaminarell^ and about 80 miles north by west of the Arab town of Kuwait. By river it is 72 miles distant from the head of the lertjluti Persian Gulf, and by way of the Shatt-al-'Arab and Tigris it is 500 diielngtfjj m ^ es fr om Baghdad. [ids ) The town stands, enveloped in and interspersed with date groves, partly ivestoij near an( ^ P ar % u P on right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab, which here flows from north-west to south-east and has a breadth of 600 yards ; the surrounding country is flat and is intersected in every direction by tidal Wall cre eks and irrigation channels. After the Shatt-al-'Arab the dominant features of Basrah are two 6 1 creeks, the Nahr-al-'Ashar ^ and the Nahr-al-Khandaq C ^ L which leave the right bank of the river about 300 and 1 ,200 yards respectively above the British Consulate; both run inland, with sli^htlv M 811(1 W • • * &amp; J winding courses, for 3 miles or more in a general south-westerly *' direction; and their breadth, which is about 60 yards at the entrance, lit bl diminishes as they go. occtpisl Climate and water-supply. In December and January the weather at B fat Basrah is col(1 ' sometimes with frost at night; the months of July, August and September on the other hand are intensely hot. The greatest heat experienced in summer is ordinarily about 112° Fahrenheit and in winter the thermometer falls to 85° or lower. The hottest weather is generally in July, and the coldest in January j in 1901 the thermometer rose to jjjllS-g 0 on the 8th of July, and in 1902 in winter it fell as low as imp)* 82 ' 50, T,ie an nual average rainfall appears to be about 6 inches. oBj{li BaSrah was once re P ute(i vcr y unhealthy, but it is now less so than s tlerf formerly ' nevertheless the climate is extremely trying during the summer Js j| 1 ((| mon ^ s ' and if is malarious all the year round.

We now proceed to describe the divisions and suburbs which in their - iown. of Basrah proper .—The main town, which alone is properly nkfroml i tlie m compose Basrah.272) BASRAH TOWN called Basrah, extends along the south-eastern bank of the -Ashar creek, beginning at about two miles from the Shatt -aVArab and ending 1 mile further on at a bridge called Jisr-al-Ghurban, beyond which the ^Ashar is narrow and unfrequented. Some of the best native residential houses at Basrah, occupied by officials and rich merchants, are on the ^Ashar just below this bridge. The main bazaar runs from near the ^Ashar creek southwards through the busiest part of the town to a suburb called Mishraq 0^* i it is about f of a mile long and is built of brick and roofed all the way ; at the end towards the ^Asliar are a few shops which deal in European commodities. The town is said to contain 7 mosques besides several shrines and Imamzadahs. Boh and Mdqdm. —The spit between the 'Ashar and Khandaq creeks is called Dob ; it is about half a mile broad and is overgrown with dates except so much of it as is within a mile of the Shatt-al-^Arab. In this lower and open extremity there stands, upon the ^Ashar creek at ? to I a mile from its entrance, an important quarter of the town which is generally known as Maqam 'Ali ^ or M aqam, but by the Turks (together with the whole clear end of Dob) is styled 'Ashar. Maqam contains houses, shops, cafes and a considerable population, and it has a post office and telegraph office, the latter only for messages in oriental characters ; here too were a flour mill and an ice factory belonging to a Jew, but they have lately been transferred to 'Ajairawiyah island. Behind Maqam, more in the direction of the Khandaq creek, are the unfinished barracks of the Turkish military garrison. The 'Ashar creel, —The ^Ashar creek has been partially described above. It remains to mention that superior houses are now springing up along its south-eastern bank ; some of these are occupied by Europeans and one is the private residence of the present Wali of Basrah. Opposite the middle of M aqam the ^Ashar creek is spanned by a wooden bridge on piles which can be crossed by horses and vehicles and of which part can be removed to allow boats with masts, etc., to pass. The Khandaq creek. —The Khandaq creek, of which the general character has already been outlined, is the seat of the grain trade; its banks are lined with yards and depots, and many Mahailahs and other boats constantly lie moored within its entrance. The Khandaq is bridged in two places, which are on a level with the upper and lower ends respectively of Maqam. The lower of the two bridges, near to the graincopyright.

The hanks of the Shatt-aWArab at Basrah. —A number of localities which may fairly be considered as included in Basrah Town are situated on the banks of the Shatt-al-^Arab, partly above and partly below the British Consulate. These we enumerate^ in the order in which they are passed by the rker, beginning with the furthest up-stream: — Right bank. Rubafc (Nahr-ar-) ^4/^ J** Khandaq (Nahr- al-) J* 'Ashar (Nahr-al-) A creek, the next above the Nahr-al- Khandaq, from which it is about 600 yards distant. On the north side of it are a new house belonging to Mirza Hamzah, the Arab Secretary of the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, and a house belonging to Raphael Sayegh ; below it is a house belonging to Asfar and Co. This creek, 1,200 yards above the British Consulate, has already been fully described. On the north side of the entrance are the premises of the Basrah Trading Co., known as ' Bait Muir' but owned by Asfar and Co. This creek opens into the river 300 yards above the British Consulate and has been described at length above. Left bank. Gardilan Khastahkhanah 'Askari A creek and large village about 1 mile up-stream from the British Consulate. Below Gardi- lan are 3 large houses owned by Ibn-al-Faraib, Salim-al-Badr and Mu- hammad-ash-Sha'aibi; the last of these 3 pro prietors is now in exile and his house remains unfinished. Some date plantations at Gardilan are owned by nephews of the present Shaikh of Kuwait. A Turkish Government hospital exactly opposite the entrance of the 'Ashar creek; it was originally a naval hospital, but is now used also by the military authorities and resorted to by the general public. In maps it is generally shewn as Gardilan, but it should rather be called Tanumah. T274 BASRAH TOWN Rigbt bank. British Consulate (by Arabs called Bait-aI-Baly5z jyJUl OT Qansulkhanah Ay.

Sarai (Nabr-as-) Quarantine Office or Karantinab a large bandsome building with a bigb flagstaff upon the bank of the river: it contains, besides the residence and offices of the Consul, a British Indian Post Office. Imme diately above the Consulate are the offices o£ Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., and just below it and a little further inland are those of Messrs. Lynch Bros. A large village ; next below it is a house belonging to Saiyid Hashim, a nephew of the present Naqib of Basrah, about §00 yards below the British Con sulate ; this house is now leased to Messrs. R. Wonck- haus and Co., the agents of the Ham burg-American Line of steamers. A creek about 750 yards below the British Consulate ; on the south side of the entrance is the house of the Turkish Commodore with the naval barracks behind it. This office is only a abort way below the Commodore 's house and stands on land lelonging to Asfar and Co. It is imme diately followed by a bouse belonging to M. Asfar, at present leased to Manashi Karah, a Jew; and below this again is Mr. Hamilton's house, where there is a liquorice press.

Man awi-al-Pasha (iMahr) A creek, about a mile below the British Consulate, in which Turkish Government vessels somefcimes lie. A short distance up it is situated a considerable village suburb of Basrah, consisting of about 400 houses. It will be seen that if any quarter of Basrah can claim to be a Euroj^ean quarter it is that on the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab below the ^Ashar creek. The houses in this part are generally large and stand in their own grounds. Communications by water and land. —The Shatt-al -^Arab connects Basrah by water with the Persian Gulf, and on the other side^ continued by the Tigris, with Baghdad. Basrah is at present the head of naviga tion for ocean steamers which usually anchor in the stream, in a depth of 5 to 6 fathoms, from the British Consulate downwards: but river steamers lie by preference near the mouth of the 'Ashar. The rise and fall of the river and creeks under the influence of the sea tides is from 6 to 9 feet, but the water is always fresh. For the service of the town itself the Shatt-al-^Arab, the 'Ashar and the Khandaq are all highways, and the Ballam is to Basrah what the gondola is to Venice. The ''Ashar and Khandaq become shallow when the tide is out, but they are crowded with boats and full of life and activity at other times. These two are connected at intervals by transverse irrigation cuts ; but the last are not passable even for small Ballams except at high water, and they are consequently little used unless for removing dates in the date season. A driving road fol lows the south-eastern bank of the ''Ashar creek from the Shatt-al- 'Arab up to the town of Basrah proper, and a few flies and omnibuses ply upon it; but most passengers between the two prefer to go by water. The wooden bridge at Maqam gives access from this road to Dob. General character of the town and buildings. —From the foregoing account of quarters and suburbs it will be evident that the modern Basrah is a straggling town : it might even be called a disjointed collectioi] of places. The walls and gates of the town proper which until recently t %276 BASRAH TOWN existed in a dilapidated state have now practically disappeared, leaving the place undefended except by its dense forest of date palms and its labyrinth of muddy tidal canals. The better houses in the residential quarters are mostly built of a soft yellow burnt brick ; but timber, at least in the town proper, enters largely into the construction of the upper storeys. Rooms on the ground floor are not generally inhabited except in the hot weather. Inhabitants, —The population of Basrah, in the sense in which the name is used in this article, is now roughly estimated at 58,000 souls, but it may be less. Of the people about one-eighth are Persians and most of the remainder Arabs ; the rival Muhammadan sects of Sunni and Shi'ah are said to be here about equally balanced in numbers. There are also many Jews—probably more than 1,000—among whom are some of the wealthiest merchants. Resident Indian Muhammadans, mostly Sunnis, number about 50 ; and there are about half a dozen Hindu tra ders. Negroes of servile origin are fairly numerous. Among institutions of general convenience are 4 public baths in the town proper and 2 in Maqam. Schools are noticed in the general article on Turkish 'Iraq. Trade. —The trade and commercial position of Basrah are fully de scribed in the general article on Turkish ' Iraq, where also will be found some remarks on the native shipping of the port. Khans or caravansarais are estimated at 2.5 in the town proper and 10 in Maqam, and there are said to be 33 coffee houses in the former and 27 in the latter. Soda water and ice are manufactured locally and there are various wool presses and one liquorice .press. The only bank is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman. There are no wharves or pontoons at Basrah for the discharge of cargo from sea-going vessels ; ships are laden and unladen in the stream by means of lighters, and during the date season the harbour is much congested. Steamers have commonly to complete their lading outside the bar of the Shatt-al-' Arab or even (in bad weather) at Kuwait. General, military, marine and municipal administration, —Basrah is the headquarters of the W ilayat of Basrah and its position in the civil ad ministration of Turkish 'Iraq will be understood on reference to the article under that name. The Sarai or principal group of government buildings stands upon the Ashar creek in the , town of Basrah proper towards its iowei end ; and the principal telegraph office is also in the main tow^-BASRAH TOWN 277 THe branch telegraph office in Maqam (by the Turks called the'Ashar office) ; accepts messages in Turkish or Arabic only. The principal customs house is in Maqam at the junction of the 'Ashar creek with the Shatt- al-'Arab; the port office being near it; there is also a customs house upon the Khandaq creek. The Dairat-as-Saniyah have a workshop on the south bank of the 'Ashar near its entrance where there are a few machine tools and where small castings can be made and ordinary engineering repairs executed. A mud dock at the same place is useless as it cannot be emptied ; but the Dairat-as-Saniyah have also a dry dock on the north bank of the Khandaq at | of a mile from the Shatt-al-'Arab, and here 2 new river steamers were put together in 1904. The site of the quarantine office has been mentioned above and that of the lazaret is described in the article oi /'AjairaWiyah island. There are at Basrah about 100 Astarsuwars or gendarmes mounted on mules. Shipping and river conservancy are in the charge of a harbour master; the Dairat-as- Sanlyah is represented by a Mamur and subordinate staff ; and the prin cipal offices ; etc. ; of the navigation branch of that department are located here and are under a director who is subordinate to the Central Com mittee at Baghdad. There is also a local Samyah Committee. The military position of Basrah is explained generally in the article on Turkish 'Iraq. There is now no defensive military work of any sort at Basrah; but a field battery of 6 guns is permanei^tly located in the angle between the south bank of the ''Ashar creek and the right bank of the Shatt al-^Arab and partially commands the river both above and below that point. Two battalions of regular infantry form the bulk of the normal garrison; and a detachment of engineers also is said to be stationed at Basrah. No cavalry are ordinarily present; but there are about 40 horses belonging to the artillery. The principal barracks; two in number; are in Dob behind Maqam: in the town proper there are 9 military stations or posts. Basrah is the head-quarters of the 1st battalion of the 85th regiment of the Radif and also of the 43rd brigade of the same. The marine establishments are described in the article on Turkish 'Iraq s and the position of the naval and military hospital on the left bank; and that of the Commodore's quarters and of the naval barracks upon the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab have already been specified above. The municipal affairs of Basrah are regulated by a Municipal Council which in powerlessness and inefficiency resembles that of Baghdad. The streets are unpaved and the main town is notoriously insanitary.^ * For a full account of the sanitar} condition of Basrah and its surroundings, also of the nature of the water supply, see Dr. Borel's Report on the Sanitary Defence of the Persian Gulf and the 8hatt*al-A.rab t 1901.278 BASRAH TOWN Foreign consular and other huitdings, —In regard to foreign interests at Basrah the general article on Turkish 'Iraq may be consulted. Of the foreign communities the British is the most numerous and important and possesses a club; reference has been made already to the British Consulate and to its situation upon the right bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab a little below the mouth of the ''Ashar. An American Consular Agency and an American Presbyterian Mission exist; the latter stands upon the south bank of the 'Ashar above Maqam, where also are the Eussian Consulate and the office of the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company. A small hospital and free dispensary managed by the American missionaries are near the English club^ and there is also a school attached to the Mission^ but it is not recognised by the Turkish authorities who are taking steps to have it closed if possible. A Eoman Catholic church and school are under the direction of the Carmelifce Fathers. The Persian Consulate^ which has much business in consequence of the passage of Persian pilgrims to the Shi'ah shrines through Basrah, is situated in the town proper. Shrines and antiquities. —-In the Mishraq quarter at the south end of the town proper is the mosque of Shaikh 'Abdullah Bash A'yan IM a U) axc which was built about 1729 A.D^ its minaret com mands the only good general view that is obtainable of Basrah and its environing sea of palms. The ruins of the ancient Basrah, founded in 638 A.D., begin about 6 miles south-west by west of the modern town and extend for about 3 miles farther in the same direction up to the walls of Zubair, in the article upon which they are described. The site of the present town is divided from that of the old by a depression liable to inundation by the Euphrates. The names of the streets and quarters of Old Basrah are said by local literati to be preserved in those of the modern town. Under the Omaiyids Basrah was one of the 'Iraqan or twin capitals of 'Iraq, the other being Kufah. The greater part of Old Basrah was burned in an insurrection in 871 A.D., and in 923 it, suffered a 17 days' sack at the hands of the Carmathians ; by 985 A.D. a considerable portion of it had gone to ruin, but by 1052 it appears to have been once more in a fairly flourishing condition. In 1123 A.D. the town wall was rebuilt with a smaller perimeter than before. The port of Old Basrah on the Shatt-al- Arab was Ubullah , which had existed from Sassanian or even eailiei times and had become, by the 10th century, a place of considerable size. L bullah was probably the GreeK t&lt; Apologos and it seems to have occupied the site of the present Maqam quarter of Basrah.BASTAK 279 A division of the sub-province of Lar ^ in the province of Fars BASTAK in Persia j the greater portion of the district lies inland at a distance from the Persian Gulf, Bastak has nevertheless a partial connection with the Persian Gulf and is held^ in a sense, to extend to the shore of the Gulf on both sides of the Ling eh District. To the west of the Lingeh District the revenue of the territories subject to the chiefs of Gabandi, Mugam, Chiru, CMrak, and Mughu has now for some time been payable to the Deputy Governor of Bastak. To the east of the Lingeh District again, the town of Khamir together with the cosist from the bordet of the Lingeh District at Purghar to the frontier of the Shamil District at the mouth of the Rud-i-Kul is recognised as belonging geographically to Bastak. This recognition however is of iio practical significance, for Khamir, the only place of importance, is actually subject for administrative purposes to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, while its revenues are farmed by the Mu^in-ut-Tujjar of Tehran : the powers of the Governor of Bastak in relation to this part of his territories are consequently nominal. The coast of the district from Purghar to the mouth of the Hud-i-Kul is about 34 miles in extent ; its average direction is from west-south west to east-north-east, and it forms the north shore of the Clarence Strait between Qishrn Island and the main; it is a low coast and the greater part of it has not as yet been satisfactorily examined. The town of Khamir, situated J 4 or 15 miles west of the Rud-i-Kul, divides the coast into two portions ) of which the western is the mouth of a great valley from the interior, namely, the long trough which lies behind the maritime range of the Shibkuh and Lingeh Districts and contains Galehdar, Tarakameh and Ishkani. Off this part of the coast line lie miles of swamp, from which most of the firewood used in the lower part of the Persian Gulf is obtained; the marshes, thickly grown with mangroves, are intersected by numerous creeks and difficult of passage except for small boats. The maritime range which forms the northern boundary of the Lingeh District and has already been described in the articles on that district and on Shibkuh encloses this part of Bastak on the south; and the district appears to be intersected by a higher range, similar in direction, [ which leaves the coast at Khamir. This last range has two principal summits near Khamir; one, which is 9 miles north east of the village and nearer to the coast, is 3,700 feet high ; while another, 12 miles north-west of Khamir, is even loftier but is less bold280 BASTAK in outline. .From the higher peak a spur runs off south-eastwards in the direction of Khamir; its foot-hills contain deposits of sulphur. The following are the principal places on or near the Bastak coast Name. Khamir Lashtaghan Mahtabi (Bandar) Puhal -i-Kdsh Puhal-i-Qibleh Position, On the coast 12 miles west-north west of Laft on Qishm Island. 2 miles west of Khamir.

The inhabitants own 6 fishing-boats and en gage ^ in petty trade. The village is under the Kalantar of Khamir. This is a port of the Ishkani district and also a mart for fire wood, charcoal and sail-cloth made at Dishkun, the trade being mostly with Trucial 'Oman. There are some fish ing boats and a good harbour to keep them in. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post at this place, There are 4 camels, 20 cattle and 150 sheep and goats. Cultiva tion is insignificant. There are 5 water re servoirs and 1 or 2 fishing-boats. There are a few dates, a little cultivation and a few cattle and sheep, also 4 water reservoirs, a ruined caravansarai and a few fishing- boats. In the neigh bourhood is a salt mine which is worked, A considerable tract of land in Kuwait territory between Kuwait Bay and the 1 uikish outpost of Safwan; Batih begins 23 miles north of Jahrah, its extent from south to north is 32 miles, and its end 11 miles south of Safwan. On the east it is separated from Khor-as-Sabiyah byBATIN 281 , a low-lying 1 tract called Rodhatain^ and on the west it reaches to the ^ locality known as Umm-al-Kllllan. Batih consists of nndulating ■v perfectly waterless desert and lies somewhat high^ its elevation above the S sea varying from 130 to 210 feet. Numerous slight ridges cross it from ^ west to east ; the more northern appearing to be included under the common name of Hamar^^U^ ; and the slope of the country downwards from west to east is uniform but gradual. Batih is traversed from west to east near its northern extremity by a broad, shallow depression called Bil Jirfan ^ and towards its southern end by a series of sandy runs, through rtli which the rainfall drains from the higher ground in the west down to l| Rodhatain: between these two, on the southern side of a well-marked M ridge, is a locality which appears to be generally known under the name of Batih-aVAud or Great Batih. A few gazelle are to be seen in Batih. The final and lowest section of the great Wadi-ar -Rummah, of which the middle and upper course lies in Eajd. The Batin may be considered to reach the Kuwait frontier first at Hafar; from Hafar it runs for about 61 miles north-eastwards to Eiqa'i and from Riqa'i it continues in the same direction for about 95 miles further to the neighbourhood of Jabal Sanam, to the westward of which it passes at a distance of 15 miles, thereafter vanishing altogether.f The Batin is generally a well marked depression, varying in breadth from 8 miles (as at Hafar) to 2 miles (as at Riqa'i). The actual bottom or bed of the valley measures about 3 miles across at Hafar, but it is ordinarily much less, and for some distance above Riqa'i its width does not exceed | a mile: it shows no signs of water action, but it is covered with a level deposit of dark-coloured clay which may have been gradually Washed down from the higher ground on either side. The level bed bears large patches of low scrub which give cover to gazelle and bustard. Between Hafar and Jabal Sanam the Batin is approximately the north-western boundary of the Shaikhdom of Kuwait, but the Shaikh asserts that his influence extends some distance beyond it. * The Hamar ridges have a slightly reddish tinge (whence their name) and are said to curve southwards between Batih and the sea ending somewhere near Mdairah. The drainage, nevertheless, of the country towards Khor-as -Sabiyah is apparently not intercepted by these ridges. It is from the highest part of Hamar crossed by the road that Safwan is first descried by the traveller from Kuwait, fA later report, from Bedouin information, states that the Batin below Jabal Sanam passes south of a place called Barjisiyah, and then a little north of Zubair lown, and finally ends in a marsh in Turkish 'Iraq. BATIN or BATAINw. ififii mm 282 BATIN The routes from Basrah and Kuwait to Qasim run along the Batin, the former joining it near J abal Sanam and the latter at Riqa/i, In the following table the principal features of the Batin are enu merated and are described in descending order :—* Name. Hafar Ballal (Qasr) Position. In the middle of the Batin, about 160 miles west- south-west of Kuwait Town. In the middle of the Batin, about 25 miles below Hafar. Dharabin 'Adhariyat Biqa'i Kharjah (No name) Mahziil On both sides of the Batin, about 17 miles below Qasr Ballal. On the right bank of the Batin from Dharabin to Riqa'i, a distance of 19 miles. Between the deepest part of the Batin and its right bank, abont 19 miles below Dharabiu. Near the left bank of the Batin opposite Eiqa'i. On the right bank of the Batin 10 miles below Riqa'i. Near the right bank of the Batin at an uncertain distance to the north-w est of Jahrah. Nature. The remains of an old mud fort, about 50 yards square, with some outlying debris There is nothing impressive about Ihese ruins though the Arabs attribute them to the prehis toric Bani Hilal. Two groups of mounds opposite to each other. A series of half a dozen dry water courses which enter the Batin from the higher ground on the south-east. R emaeks. A number of knolls. A conspicuous hill forming a good land mark. A hill. See article Hafar. The bed of the valley is here of greater breadth and bears more vegetation than near Riqa'i, but there is uo water, and the existence of the ruins is some what difficult to account for. The mounds are low. In scire of these there is water underground. See article Riqa'i. The knolls form groups^ Mahziil marks the western extremity of the Kuwait district of Shiqqaq. in * A portion of the Batin below Jabal Sanam was examined by Major Knox January 1908. The results were unfortunately received too late for incorporation m this Gazetteer and were transferred to the Foreign Department.0 BATINAH 283 .—An important maritime district in the Sultanate of 'Oman j BATINAH* its coast forms a great hollow curve between Masqat Town and the pro- montory that divides the Gulf of ''Oman from the Persian Gulf. Its extreme points are Khatmat Milahah a spur coming down c ] 0S e to the sea nearly 3 miles north-north-west of Murair, and Hail ' ' A1 ; Umair on the south-east, which are 150 miles apart in a direct line; its houndarv inland is the foot of the Western Haiar hills which run eeattitU roughly parallel to the coast at a distance varying from 10 to 20 miles. The exact boundary with the Qasimi district of Shamailiyah beyond Murair is marked at the present time by a stone wall which runs seawards Hijli for a quarter of a mile from the extremity of the hills and through a gap in which the road from Murair to Ghallah passes.J rrSjj Physical geography, —The whole of Batinah is a low-lying plain, » sandy towards the sea, clayey in the interior, and stony as the hills are approached. There are no springs, but water is everywhere obtainable 'tat ft from wells which are generally 15 to 20 feet deep. The great valleys of the seaward slope of Western Hajar all traverse Batinah on their way to the coast; but their courses within the limits of Batinah are often ill-defined &gt; and in some cases their channels are so broken up and ^ dispersed as to render uncertain the point at which they reach the sea* is water uli; A list of the principal of these valleys, in order from east to west, will be found in the article on Western Hajar : some of them bear in Batinah names different from those by which they are distinguished in the hills. The coast of Batinah is destitute of prominent capes, and the only ieafM islands that lie off it are those of the Daimaniyat and Suwadi groups. Climate. —The Batinah coast is much cooler in summer, especially at . night, than the rocky coastal tract to the east of it in which Masqat Town is situated. The months of May, June and July are healthy, but fever begins with the date harvest. ii( ^The principal villages of Eatinah are shown in Black's Sketch of the Bdtinah Coast, For authorities on the district see article 'Oman Sultanate (foot note). ^ The etymology of the names of Batinah and Dhahirah is not free from difficulty. 0 tfEatin ordinarily means that which is hidden or inward, DLahir that which rtftern# 8 evident or external ; but unless we suppose the districts in question to be viewed the west instead of the east—a supposition which appears unnatural—the f Shi'names in these senses are clearly inappropriate. It is possible that Dhahirah is so called because it is high and prominent, while Batinah has received its name because it is low-lying and not visible from a distance. Or the names may bo --jjfeferred to other senses of the Arabic roots, and we may connect Batinah with the ^ tcf' * which is in front, and Dhahirah with the ' back which is behind.

Batinah is an exceedingly populous district in the neighbourhood of the coast; and a number of the tribes represented in the towns and villages are understood to have Bedouin sections which wander in the interior of the district with their flocks and herds. Practically the whole of the people belong to the Hinawi faction. The following is an estimate of the settled population of Batinah ; — Eastern Batinab, viz. Places on the coast (see end of this article) . . . 51,200 Wadi Bani Ghafir (Lower) ...... . , 2,800 Western Batinah, via., the sub-Wilayats of Liwa ......... 12,500 Saham * 12,800 Shinas ..».•• 6,200 Sohar . 20,000 Total . . 105,500 souls. The nomads of Batinah^ whose number is quite uncertain, belong chiefly to the important Hawasinah, Bani Kharus and Yal Sa'ad tribes and to the less important tribes of the Biduwat, A1 Hamad ; Yal Jarad ; Muwalik, Nuwafil, A1 Bu Qarain, Al Bu Eashaid and Shabul. Agriculture, animals and fisheries. is celebrated principally for its dates; and the Arabs have a saying that a man can walk along the coast from one end of the district to the other without leaving the shade of the palms : the statement is not literally true., but it conveys without much exaggeration an idea of the magnificent date belt which fringes the sea-shore almost continuously and has sometimes a depth of 7 miles Inland. There is also much ordinary cultivation along the coast; the chief crops are wheat, barley, cotton, sugar, and lucerne; and some tobacco is grown in the north-westernmost villages. Fruits include—besides dates—mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, figS; hmeS; melons, quinces, olives and Loz almonds. All crops are irrigated from wells which are copious and, as already mentioned^ not deep. The interior of Batinahj with the exception of a few spots, appears to be uncultivated and barren. The domestic animals are camels, horses, cattle^ goats and dogs ; but horses are few; wild animals include the gazelle and the hare. The country, though suitable enough for wheeled traffic, has no vehicles-BATINAH 285 o! J| k ah The fisheries of the coast are productive. The commonest kind of lllai fishing-boat is the Shashah &gt; composed of a bundle of date stalks 0 UrV held together with strings which floats by the buoyancy of its materials and not by excluding water ; in these slight but unsubmersible craft the tie ii people of Batinah put to sea in all weathers and perform journeys of 50 i rti miles and more. 0 f| ; : Trade. —The only article of exportation is the date. Imports are principally rice; cotton goods ; sugar and cofdee., received for the most part 51| from India through Masqat Town; and the trade^ in consequence of the denseness of the local population and of the fact that the valleys of Western Hajar are supplied through the Batinah ports; is not inconsider- ^ able. The coast of Batinah possesses no harbours^ nor even any creeks 121 that are accessible to boats except of the smallest size; it lies quite open 5,11 to the Shamal and is a dead lee-shore in a Na^shi. Nevertheless some sea- 20,(1 going and coasting craft belong to Batinah^ and the following table of 1051: its ports; in order from east to west ; contains particulars regarding them:— .certaii,; ™ Port. lap.: Inland area served by tlie port.

Administration. —The Sultan of ^Oman is represented in Batinah by Walis at Sib, Barkah, Masna'ah, Suwaiq, Khahurah and Sohar Town. The Sohar Wilayat is divided into the sub-Wilayats of Saham, Sohar Proper, Liwa and Sllinas, each of which is described under its own name. The other Wilayats are smaller and less organised. At present the Sultan derives almost no revenue in excess of local expenditure from his possessions in Batinah.

Singular Battaslii A tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate; they BATTASH are of Yamani descent; belong to the Hinawi faction, and are Ibadhis (BANI) in religion. Their principal seat is in W adi Tay 111, where they occupy ^ a large number of villages including Hail-al-Ghaf ; but they are found ^ ^ also in Wadi Maih, Wadi-al-Hilu and Wadi Bani Bttaash, at Daghmar and Quryat, and at one or fcwo other places on the y %(fs^) V _/ BAWlYEH 293 The total number of the tribe is now about 7,000 souls : formerly they were more numerous. The Bani Battash bear a good character and are peaceably disposed; they concern themselves chiefly with trade and the cultivation of dates. In ancient times, it is said, they used to breed horses for the Indian market on grazing grounds near Quryat ; but this occupation has long been discontinued. The Bani Battash are sometimes at feud with the Siyabiyin. Their TamTmah or chief Shaikh belongs to a family called Wilad Shimas ^and has his residence at Mazara'. A valley in the Masqat District of the Sultanate of 'Oman; its course is from south-west to north-east, its length is about 20 miles, and it reaches the sea at the south end of Quryat. The inhabitants are all of the Bani Battash tribe, and the following are their villages in order from the head of the valley down to Quryat upon the seaMazara' £jlj*(left bank, 150 houses) ;Mihya (right bank, 100 houses); Misfah (right bank, 100 houses); 'Aqair /it (left bank, 50 houses); Khadhra (right bank, 80 houses) ;Hail (left bank, 70 houses) ; Sakhbari (left bank, 10 houses); Khilaiyif oilk (left bank, 20 houses). The population of the valley is thus about 3,000 souls. Kesources are estimat ed at 200 camels, 280 donkeys,, 860 cattle and 4,500 sheep and goats, which are distributed among the villages roughly in proportion to the size of the latter. Date palms amount altogether to some 21,000, of which about 7,000 are at Mazara' and 7,000 at Misfah. BATTASH (WADI BANI) Singular Bawi cyjb . A large and powerful Arab tribe of BAWIYEH Southern 'Arabistan; they claim descent from Muhalhal, an Arab hero, J b and consider their ancestry superior to that of the Ka J ab. The Bawiyeh ^ ' number perhaps 20,000 souls and occupy, along with certain small tribes dependent on them, the whole of the region between the Jarrahi on the east and the Karun on the west, from the confluence of the Haddam With the Gargar in the north to J Ali-ibn-al-Husain or even Marid on the Karun in the south. A few are found also on the right bank of the Karun. The tribe are mostly nomads living in tents and owning, ^ mm 294 BAWlTEH large flocks and herds; but on the Karun they possess the permanent villages of Kut 'Abdullah, Kut Saiyid Salih, Kut-al-'Amaireh, Umm-at- Tamair and Ghazzawiyeh, also the more than temporary settlements of Kut Saiyid Salih, Kut Saiyid 'A nay eh and Moran. The residence of the chief Shaikh, at present Husain-bin-'Ali whose father died at an advanced age in 1907, is at Kut-al-'Amaireh where he has a fort and house. The number of settled Bawiyeh is probably about 1 ; 500 souls, as against 18,500 who are nomads. The Faratiseh, Hamaid, Jama', A1 Bu Kurd, Salaiuat, Shawakir and Zarqan tribes which are politically connected with the Bawiyeh are described elsewhere, and the detailed analysis whicb follows below relates only to the divisions of the Bawiyeh proper. From this table it would appear that the Bawiyeh have 2,710 fighting men&gt; of whom 920 are mounted on horses (or rather mares) and 800 are armed with rifles, but in practice they seem unable to put as many as 2,000 warriors in the field; on the other hand the estimated fighting strength appears small in proportion to the alleged total number of the tribe.

Most of them are at present attached to the Bait Rahameh section above and are dependents of Shaikh 'Anayeh ; nephew of the principal chief of the Bawiyeh. It is affirmed that the Bawiyeh as a whole pay annual revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammarell through their own Shaikh, but that certain sections are exempt and even receive allowances. Or Bayasir singular Baisar . A community or tribe of inferior social status, found everywhere in ^Oniail; but especially at NakhljBGHAILAH 297 Bahlah and Nizwa and in the coast towns of Masqat, Matrah, Saham and Sohar J they occur also at various places in Wadi Samail, and at Misinnah and Mali in Wadi Bani Ghafir. Their origin is doubtful; some authorities state that they are a tribe of Hadhramauti origin, but it appears to be the case that most of them are merely the children of 'Omani Arabs by slave mothers. Some are Ghafiris and some Hinawis and there is no agreement among them in religious matters. They are peaceable and industrious and some have accumulated wealth, but the Arabs do not entrust them with authority or command ; and they are accustomed to remove their sandals, after the manner of servants and inferiors, before kissing the hands of Shaikhs. Those who regard the Bayasirah as a regularly constituted tribe divide them into the following 4 sections : Aulad Barakain and Aulad 'Abdu ^ with headquarters at Nakhl, Aulad Subah o3)jl with headquarters at Nizwa, and Al Khasaib Jl with headquarters at Masqat Town: there are also at Nakhl sections or subsections called Aulad Hamad and Aulad ■'Ubaidan mliwxc The Bayasirah number perhaps 10,000 souls and are connected, among others, with the following tribes with the Bani Hasan, 400 houses; with the Baui Ruwahah, 70 houses; with the Bani Battash, 30 houses; and with the Habus, 20 houses. A few Bayasirah have emigrated to Dhufar Proper and are to be found there cultivating at Hamran. This sub-province of Fars, with the town of Behbehan as its capital, BEHBE- lies for the most part beyond the limits of the Gazetteer: the only HAN portions included are the coast district of Liravl, which is described l^j in a separate article under its own name, and the Zaidan plain which, ^ ■with its villages, is noticed in the article on the Hindiyan River. The town of Arrajan, famous in the 10th century, seems to have been situated within a few miles of the site of the present town of Behbehan, by which it was superseded before the end of the 14th century A. D.* A small town in the Jazirah Qadha of Turkish -'Iraq, on the right BGHAI bank of the Tigris about 50 miles above Kut-al-Amarah and 60 below LAH * Arrajan declined after its capture by the Ismailiang in the 13th century A. D and by the end of the Uth century had fallen completely to decay. See Le Strange's Lands of the Eastern Caliphate. The name of Behbehan is first mentioned in connection with a march made by Timur in 1293 A. D.BGHAILAH 'Aziziyah by river; it stands on Dairat-as-Saniyah land and belongs entirely to tbat Department. The population is about 2,000, of whom more than one-third are Kurds and a majority are Shi'ahs. The town is situated on the boundary between the country of the Bam Rabi'all on the east and that of the Zubaidion the west, and it is much frequented by the surround ing Arabs. It is the centre of a cultivated tract which produces wheat, barley oats, rice, sesame, maize, millet, beans and Mash in profusion and the lands are watered by a large canal, called Bad'ah which takes off below the town and runs into the desert behind it. There are as yet no dates ; but gardens of fruit trees, including peaches, have been laid out. Supplies not locally'produced are brought from Hillah., Dagharah and the Maj district in the Euphrates valley. Sheep are numerous, but larger animals scarce. There is a bazaar of about 50 shops. A manager of the Dairat-as-Saniyah, who is said to be invested with executive powers, resides here, and there is a small police post of 7 mounted and 3 unmounted Dhabitiyahs. Trade and cultivation are both on the increase. The local Arabs are nearly all employed as cultivators by the Dairat-as- Saniyah and pay | of the gross produce as rent. The income of the Department from this estate is said to be 4,000 Lirahs annually and ihe annual expenditure 500 Lirahs. BIDTAH A coast village of the Shamailiyah tract in Tmcial 'Oman, subject to Sharjah and situated 5 or 6 miles north of Khor Fakkan. A small island, also called Bidyah, lies off the coast a little to the southward: it is 200 feet high. Bidyah consists of about 800 houses of Sharqiyin who are fishermen and cultivators of dates, wheat and maize. There are 8 shops, but no Indian traders. Some 10 sea-going boats running to Sib and Masqat are owned here and 8 fishing boats. Livestock are estimate at IB camels, 30 donkeys, 200 cattle and 100 sheep and goats, and date palms number about 8,500. There is a suburb or dependent hamlet ca H aqil • BILAD-AL- QADIM A large scattered village on Bahrain Island^ about miles so ^ west of Manamah fort. It consists of about 350 mud and iced hu &gt; along with the ruins of many well built houses. There L &amp; sBIYABAN 299 western suburb called Bilad-ar-Rafi' and the ground on the north-west side of the village, called Suq-al-KhamTs ) is the scene of a largely attended market which is held every Thursday throughout the year. About ^ a mile west of the existing habitations are the ruins of the Madrasah Abu Zaidan ^ mosque, with two slender and not inelegant minarets, 7Q feet high, still standing : in combination with J abal-ad -Dukhan these minarets form the leading mark for vessels entering Ma nam ah harbour. In the midst of the ruined part of the village is the Abu Zaidan spring, over which is built a modern Shi^ah mosque; its beautifully clear waters fill a tank to which all the notabilities of Bahrain resort for bathing in the hot weather. The people of Bilad-al-Qadnn are Baharinah w r ho gain a livelihood as pearl merchants, cultivators and tailors. Livestock include 21 donkeys and 7 cattle. Date palms are estimated at 11,500 trees, and there are also some figs, almonds and pomegranates. The rose and jessamine grow. A district of the Persian Coast, included in the administrative province known as the Gulf Ports ; it is intermediate between the district of Minab on the north and the district of Jashk on the south, and it flanks upon the eastern side the passage which connects the Gulf of 'Oman with the Gulf of Persia. Geographically Biyaban is considered to belong to Persian Makran. Boundaries. —The Biyaban District is bounded on the west by the sea, and on the east by the crest of a range of hills which runs parallel to the coast at a distance of 10 to 15 miles inland, dividing Biyaban from the districts of Eudbar and Bashakard. On the north the boundary with Minab District is aline which passes between the Minab villages of Ziyarat, Dudar, QaFeh-i-Gat and Taling and the Biyaban villages of Bundram, GuwSsmand and Garuk; on the south the boundary with the Jashk District passes between the Biyaban villages of Bunji and Bashib and the Jashk village of Kuh Mubarak. The district is thus about 50 miles in length from north to south and from 10 to 20 miles in ^ breadth. ^ Ptysiealfeafares.^ke chief range of hills is that forming the eastern boundary of the district; it is known as the Kuh-i-Biyaban . BIYABAN800 BIYABAN In the north near Guwasmand it reaches an altitude of 1^962 feet, and in the south it has a peak 3,946 feet in height. Between Kuh-i-Bijaban and the sea are several minor ranges which begin near the coast and trend gradually away from it in a south-easterly direction towards the main range; these ridges have no general names and are called after the villages near which they pass. They are entirely of sandstone, assuming in places curious and grotesque shapes and lending themselves to varied uses as forts, store houses for grain, etc. In one peak these subsidiary ranges attain a height of 899 feet.* The principal streams of Biyaban, in order from north to south, are the Graz y , Hiwai cfly* , Karai c?)/ , Biriz and Zangali, all of which, except the Karai and the Biriz, flow down from the main range to the sea. The Gaz, which passes about a mile north of the village of Gaz, derives its name from the tamarisks which grow in profusion along its banks. The Hiwai reaches the sea approximately in north latitude 26° 15' j the Karai is about 7 miles south of the Hiwai, and the Biriz about 8 miles south of the Karai; and the Zangali, which is the southernmost of all, has its course immediately to the south of the villages of Tujak and Gawan. All these streams have steep banks which are about 20 feet high and from 50 to 70 yards apart. In winter the Gaz, Hiwai, Karai, Biriz and Zangali are sometimes impassable, but in summer they either fall to a low level or dry up altogether. In spring the Gaz river has been known to run 6 feet deep with a current of 6 miles an hour, and travellers are sometimes delayed by it for as much as a week at a time. Besides these large streams there are a number of hill torrents, varying in width from 10 to 30 yards, which after rain would undoubtedly become difficult, if not impassable, for transport animals. The coast line is low and sandy except for a short distance southwards from Biriz, where it is said to be rocky and bold. There are few inlets or creeks, and none of consequence except that which forms an anchorage for Sirik. The soil of Biyaban is clayey in parts and sandy elsewhere, A feature of the district are Mins or dangerous quicksands, formed by the sun drying the surface of the ground while below the soil remains in a serai-fluid condition; they occur chiefly upon the coast between the firm, damp strip near the water &gt; s edge and the soft, dry ground further inland. The commonest wild trees are the camel thorn and the tamarisk. * A delineation of some of the hills in this district as seen from the sea is given in Chart No. 2373—2837-A., .Persian Gulf,BITABAN 301 People. —The inliabitants of Biyaban are all Baluchis^ chiefly of the KaTs and Hot tribes ; in religion they are Sunnis^ and they are not in any degree Persianised. They are extremely poor, ignorant and uncivil ised. Almost all of them inhabit date leaf huts; there is hardly a dwelling of any other kind in the whole district. The people are date growers, stock owners and cultivators; a few upon the coast, however, eke out their livelihood by working as fishermen and sailors. The total population of Biyaban is about 8,000 souls. Agriculture, livestock and trade. —Dates, wheat and barley are grown for local consumption and the surplus for export is inconsiderable; a little produce, however, from the smaller villages finds a market in the larger, especially in those at the coast and most of all at Sirik. Cattle, sheep, goats and fowls exist only in numbers sufficient to meet local require ments. The only commercial centre is Sirik, from which agricultural products are exported in small quantities to the islands of Qishm, HormUZ, etc., and to the ports of Trucial 'Oman and 'Oman. Sarkand and the landing places for Sirik and for the village of Gunari near the mouth of the Hiwai stream are also points of call for vessels of light draft. Native vessels which are too large to enter the creeks or to be hauled up on the beach generally avoid the exposed shores of Biyaban. Communications and transport. —Two main routes between Minab Town and Jashk traverse the Biyaban District lengthwise; they divide at Kalawi in the Minab District and unite again at Gangan in the Jashk District. One of them, known as the Rah-i-Darya alj follows the coast; the other, called Rah-i-Kuh «!; runs farther inland through the lower hills. The Eah-i-Darya,* starting from Kalavi passes by Kuhistak (6 miles) and Ziyarat (1^ miles) in the Minab District, and then by Tahrui (9 miles), Sirik (4 miles), Kardar (6 miles), Gaz (3 miles), Gao or Namurdi (Smiles), Zarawat (5 miles), Sikui (4 miles)j Karai (Smiles), Birlz (Smiles), Gawan (5 miles), Mukhjangan (3 miles), and Gatan (6 miles) in Biyaban to Kuh Mubarak (10 miles)) in the Jashk District, and so to Gangan (12 miles). The points through which the Rah-i-Kuh runs after leaving Kalavi are Shahmurdi Kunarzu Dudar, Bangurman and Hunzam most if not all of which are in the Minab District, and *This route is fully described by Preece in his Notes of a Journey between Shira* and Jashk*302 bit A ban the villages of Maihmani, Sarzeh, Qalamui, Gosliki, Agushki, Zahraki, Shirahan, Sarkuh and Bashib in Biyaban; Gangan in the J^shk District is reached after the last named. The Rah-i-Darya is frequently impassable in winter in consequence of floods, otherwise it presents no difficulties of a physical nature ; it is a mere track, however, sometimes not even visible, across the sandy deserts which divide the villages and date groves situated upon it. The Rah-i-Kuh is described as hilly and difficult, and water, at least in summer, is scanty and bad. It follows that the Rah -i-Darya is used in summer and the Rah-i-Kuh in winter. It should be noted that the inhabitants of Biyaban consider all water ' good ^ which can be drunk without immediate evil results: this fact should be borne in mind in consulting the table of villages given below. The district possesses about 300 camels and 500 donkeys, but these are only sufficient for the requirements of the owners, and no con siderable demand for transport could be enforced without hardship to the people. Administration, —^The district is governed by a Kalantar of local influence appointed by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. At present the Kalantarship is in dispute between Mir Haji and Mir Barkat who both belong to the family of the Mirs of Jashk. The revenue for which the Kalantar is responsible appears to be about 2-,500 Tumans a year. The seat of Government has ordinarily been Sirikj but Mir Barkat, when in power, has made Namurdi his headquarters. The state of the district is lawless and about 1,200 rifles of various kinds are said to be in the hands of the inhabitants. The Kalantar has authority to order any punishment, except death, without reference to the Governor of the Gulf Ports and in practice he may be said to inflict even the extreme penalty at will, for persons obnoxious to him are liable to be shot out of hand on pretext of their having attempted to escape from custody. Civil cases are nominally decided by the Shara ; courts, but in reality they are generally settled by force. The Imperial Persian Customs are now represented in Biyaban by Mudirs at Sirik, Biriz, Sarkand and Bunji; these officials are at present directly subordinate to the Director-General of Customs at Bushehr and their duties as yet are far from onerous.BIYABAN 303 Topography* —The following is an alphabetically arranged table of the principal villages in Biyaban ;— Name.

The largest tract in the Sanjaq of Hasa that is included under one name: on account of its desolate character^ however, its importance is not in proportion to its size nor comparable with that of the oases of Hasa and Qatif. Boundaries, —On the coast Biyadh reaches from the cape off which lies Abu 'Ali island in the north to Ras-as-Safairah, a promontory opposite the south end of Zakhnuniyah island on the south—a distance of 130 miles. Biyadh is bounded on tlie north by the tract called Huzum; on the west of it lie in succession from north to south the tracts of Jau Shamin, Habl, Jauf, Badd-al -Asis and th.e Hasa Oasis; on the south it meets Jafurah inland and Barr-al -Qarah near the coast. BIYADH31-2 BITADH The maximum breadtli of Biyadh is between the sea and Habl where it amounts to about 50 miles. The Qatif Oasis; which lies upon the coast about midway between the two ends of Biyadh, is regarded as a separate tract, surrounded on the landward side by Biyadh but not forming* a part of it. Certain other areas also, which fall within the limits above described, but are distinguished by names and characteristics of their own, are scarcely to be taken as included in the term Biyadh ; these are dealt with in separate articles and their names will be found in the following paragraph. Physicctl characteristics ancl divisions, — considered gener ally, is a tract of light-coloured sandy soil and abounds in low white sandhills called Naqiyan . Qasba, Subat and Thamam are among the grasses, and ^Andal, Eashad and Tarfah are among the shrubs whioli grow, and they are found in great profusion. Almost everywhere water is obtainable by digging a very few feet beneath the surface, and the Bedouins say that the wells of Biyadh are numbered ' ( by thousands.^ There are several areas which call for notice as differing in character from the rest of the tract. The northernmost of these is the tu # | I Sabakhat-as-Summ , a large saline plain or nitrous depression covered with sandhills, which almost reaches the sea in the neighbour hood of Jabal Dhalaifain and extends inland for many miles with a very considerable breadth. To the south of it, and divided from it only by a narrow strip of the ordinary Biyadh, is a second Sabakhah of similar character known as Sabakhat Salaliyat oUUL* • on the east this marsh nearly touches the confines of the Qatif Oasis. The two areas containing the best groups of wells in Biyadh are known as Dabaisi and Hushum and have their centres respectively 10 miles south west and 30 miles west by south of Qatif Town. Next to these in excellence are two coastal strips, the Barr-adh-Dhahran which extends from the Qatif Oasis to the large bay of Dohat Ruhum^ and the Barr-aVOqair which reaches southwards from Dohat Euhum to the end of the Biyadh tract. The least inviting part of Biyadh after the Sabakhahs is said to be Habail y a region some miles in extent which is traversed at 30 or 40 miles from Hofuf on the route to Qatlf Town; water is obtainable, however, and Bedouins sometimes encamp here. Jau-al-Ajal JaJ) ^ is a small similar tract between Jiibail- al-Barri and Qtasr A1 Subaih.BIT A Dfi 313 Features and wells, —For the purpose of more minute d scription it is necessary to divide Biyadh into the following parts :— I. The part north of Sabakhat-as-Summ. II. The part between Sabakhat-as-Summ and Hushum, Dabaisi and the Qatlf Oasis. III. The part between Hushun^ Dabaisi and Jauf. IV. The part between Dabaisi on the west and the Qatif Oasis and Barr-adh -Dhahran on the east. V, The part inland of Dohat Ruhum. 'VI. The part westwards and south-westwards of Barr-al -'Oqair. Each of these artificial divisions we now proceed to describe: but Hushum, Dabaisi, Barr-adh -Dhahran and Barr-al -'Oqair— whether they ought to be regarded as belonging to Biyadh or only as enclosed by it—are dealt with separately under their own names ; and so^ of course, is the Hasa Oasis. 1.

TS324 BtTBITAN BIJBIYAN ^ large, low island, about 26 miles in lengtn by IS in breadtli, at tbe north-western corner of the Persian Gulf ; Khor 'Abdullah divides it from the month of the Shatt-al -'Arab and from Turkish territory, Kbr Bubiyan from the island of Warbah, and Khor-as -Sabiyah fromtlie possessions of the Shaikh of Kuwait north of Kuwait Bay. The eastern most point (or nearly so) of Bubiyan is called Bas-al-Qaid ^xaJ) j the southern point, 7 miles north-north-west from Failakah island, is known as Bas-al-Barshah wh The island has no date trees or villages, and is destitute of fresh water. The northern end of it is very low and is sometimes broken in upon by the sea; the south end also is partially overflowed at high water. In summer some of the ^AwSzim of Kuwait visit Bubiyan and catch fish upon its north-eastern coast by means of tidal weirs or Hadhrahs ; and, chiefly on this ground, the Shaikh of Kuwait claims the island as his property. A storehouse, guarded by a small military detachment under an officer, was established by the Turks near Ras-al-Qaid in 1902 and still remains. BUDAIYA' Ml A town on the coast of Bahrain Island near its north-western corner: it stretches for about a mile along the sea and is about 300 yards deep. It consists of 3 quarters named Farlq-al-'Amamarah, Pariq-ad-Dam ^ and Fariq^al-Budaiya': of these the last is the oldest and southernmost. Fariq-al-Budaiya^ is adjoined on the north by Fariq-ad-Dam, which stands on Ras Budaiya'* or Budaiya*' point; and Fariq-ad-Dam is adjoined in its turn by Fariq-al- - 'Amamarah on the east. W aste spaces which divided these quarters have now entirely disappeared. There are a considerable number of stone houses, including 5 or 6 buildings of solid masonry with upper storeys, besides a large number of reed huts; and Fariq-al-Budaiya' contains a tower. The inhabitants of Budaiya' are all Sunnis, comprising Dawasir (800 houses), 'Amamarah (100 houses), Huwalah (50 houses), free negroes (200 houses) and a large number of negro slaves (perhaps 4 50 houses). The total population is estimated at 8 ,000 souls. The Budaiya^ and Dam quarters are mostly Dawasir ; their water supply is from wells in the date plantations of Diraz and Bam Jamrah villages ; that of the quarter of the 'Amamarahis from a well a little to the east of their houses. Most of the people are engaged in the pearl fisheries. Over 100 boats, some of considerable size, are owned here; they are 11 Batils, 10 Baqarahs, 56 Shu^ais and Sambuks and 37 MMhuwahs and jollyboats ; of these 57 are used for pearling. LivestodBURAIDAH 3^5 include 2 horses, 55 donkeys and 25 cattle. There are 3 day schools kept by Mullas. The internal administration of the place is conduclted by the Shaikh of the Dawasir without any interference from the Shaikh of Bahrain. An Arab tribe, partly settled and partly nomad, found in the extreme BU'QIJfil south-western corner of Najd and beyond. Wadi Bishah is one of fjsy their seats, and Rumadan and Turabah in Wadi Sabai : are amono' their villages. Bedouin Buqurn encamp in large numbers near Turabah in the summer. The singular of the name is Buqumi . An important town of Najd, situated in Qasim and second in that BURAIDAH district to 'Anaizah only. Buraidah stands on the opposite side of Wadi-ar-Rummall from 'Anaizah, at some distance from the left bank, and is distant 12 miles from 'Anaizah northwards. Buraidah is almost surrounded by desert, and palm groves and cultivation are found only on that side of it which is next the Wadi. On the west side of the place the sand of the desert appears to be constantly accumulating to a greater and greater height* Tne sub soil is a sedimentary deposit of bluish-white clay ; but in some places three strata of sandstone, each from 3 to 6 feet thick, are encountered within 30 feet of the surface. The elevation of Buraidah above the sea ^ is slightly less than that of 'Anaizah. ija'i' Arrangement and buildings. —The town is surrounded by a strong IjJ mud wall with square towers at intervals^ and contains, at its north end, gil a large but not lofty fort called Qasr Mahanna ^jl which also es fl possesses towers. The houses of Buraidah are of clay, but many have Pill ^Pper storeys; they cover on the average a larger area than those of [Za ill Anaizah, and their size, together with the greatm- width of the Buraidah streets, makes the town appear more extensive than 'Anaizah. ^ Tlie cen ^ r al feature of the town is the main bazaar, called Majlis a i{if , which runs north and south and is divided by sections among various trades. At the northernmost end are blacksmiths and tin- I# sm ^ s ) next them are cobblers and shoemakers ; then tailors and vendors326 BTJRAIDABL of ready-made clothes and of piece-goods; tten green-grocers; then butchers ; finally a miscellaneous collection of shops belonging to dealers in piece-goods, confectioners, arms and ammunition merchants, and gold and 'silver smiths. A street running eastwards leaves the main bazaar near it s southern end and is given up to female traders who traffic m collyrium, henna, toilet requisites, dresses, gold thread, rings, etc. In two places, one in the tailors 5 quarter and the other in that of bntckrs and miscellaneous dealers, ihe bazaar widens out and forms an open spa«e; both these spaces are used as camel and cattle markets, and in the latter auctions are also held. The various wards of the town surround the Majlis and are as follows: on the north-east, Jaradah 5 on the south-east, Jadidah on the south-west, Butah ou the west, Duwash and on the north-west Shamal Of these Jaradah is by far the largest, amounting perhaps to a third of the whole town. The Jami' or principal mosqne, which is situated to the east of the Majlis near the northern of the two cattle markets, has a high square tower; it is a large building but like other Wahhabi mosques can lay no claim to elegance. There are five other considerable mosques, one of which has a tall minaret; this minaret and the tower of the Jami', though attached to places of worship, are used as ordinary look-out stations by the town watchmen. Inhabitants. —The population of Buraidah amounts to about 7,500 soms; they are mostly 'Anizah but partly Bani Tamim. Galla slaves, dependects of the Amir of Buraidah, were formerly numerous, A number of the fighting men are mounted on the Amir^s horses. There are seven schools in which Muhammadan jurisprudence and Quranic lore are taught, also a number of elementary schools ; five schools for girls exist at which instruc tion in reading, writing, needlework and the Quran is imparted by female teachers. Agriculture and supplies, —The date groves of Buraidah are very extBH' sive and ordinary fruit trees are numerous. Cereals also are grown m the vicinity of the town, and desultory cultivation is carried on by Buraidah agriculturists at outlying places such as Duwairah and Naqib. The date belt to the south of the town is called Subakh; it is full of wells ot good water, on which the irrigation depends, and lucerne is raised in large quantities among the palms. Livestock are estimated at 1,000 cam3ls, 200 donkeys and 600 or more horned cattle. The Amir owns about 50 good horses and mares and his relations have 10 or 15 more, but there areBU RAID AH 327 few or none among the ordinary townsmen. Camels for transport are supplied by the adjacent Bedouins, those of the town itself being: mostly employed on the wells. Buraidah is a stage on the route between Kuwait and Makkah. All kinds of supplies are plentiful. The water of Buraidah, however, is generally dull and brackish; its level varies from 20 to 40 feet below ground and rises after floods in Wadi-ar -EummaL The wells in the town are lined with dry-stone masonry. Commerce and indus fries. —The shops in the main bazaar number about 300. Buraidah is a great commercial centre, but its trade and activity are at their height only during the four months following the date harvest, When nomads resort to the town to buy dates, rice and cloth ; sometimes as many as 1,000 of their tents may be seen at one time pitched outside the walls. At other seasons of the year a considerable proportion of the shops are closed. Buraidah is celebrated for its horse market; the animals mostly come from the Mutair and are more numerous than in the Anaizah market but not so good. Buraidah is partly dependent on Kuwait for food-stufis and entirely so for cotton goods. There are richer merchants at Buraidah than at Hail, among them being some prosperous camel masters who have made their money by transporting grain in Turkish '1 raq, by importing rice and clothing into Najd, and by exporting ghi to Makkah or, in some years, dates and corn to Madlnah. The chief indigenous handicrafts are those of the blacksmith, gold smith and silversmith. Swords of good temper and workmanship are still turned out, and in former days Buraidah was celebrated for the manu facture of fire-arms. Political position and government.—Th history of Buraidah is inseparable from that of Qasim; it is a record of rivalry with 'Anaizah varied by occasional coalitions between the two places to meet a common danger. The constitution of Buraidah under its own Amir has hitherto resembled that of 'Anaizah, political relations with the sur rounding Bedouins being however less close ; and it appears to be as little in abeyance, notwithstanding the nominal Turkish occupation of Qasim established in 1905, as that of the larger town, The Turkish Nuqtah or military post at Buraidah consisted in 1906 of 60 rifles and was aecommo- ated in a large house without an upper storey in the Jaradah quarter, which belonged to the Amir of Buraidah. The Amir, at present Salih- bin-Hasan-bin-Mahanna, received in 1906 the rank of Qaim-Maqam inBIT RAID Afl the Turkish service ; but his appointment, in so far as his employee are concerned/is an unpaid sinecure, and he is understood to own allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud.* Ordinarily pronounced Burazjiin. The principal place m the district of Dashtistan and the seat of the Khan who under the Governor-General of Fars rules tne greater part of that district: Kurazjan is situated about 38 miles north-eait of Bushehr Town. The ordinary route from Bushehr Town to Shiraz passes by Burazjan, whidh by land is distant 48 miles from Bushehr and 16 from Daliki, the next stage beyond it; hut the land-journey from Bushehr can be reduced to 28 miles by taking boat from Bushehr to Sbif. Burazjan stands on the plain of Dashtistan, at an elevation of only 250 feet above the sea and dominated by the lofty crests of the Gisakan mountain less than 10 miles to the eastward; it is surrounded by date- o.roves which are most extensive upon the west side. The ordinary houses are poor but there is a fine stone-built Sarai with loopholed walls, commanding the town and capable of being utilised as a fort; it was in fact occupied in 1906 by a Persian military detachment of 150 infantry with one mountain gun. High Persian officials passing through Burazjan treat the Sarai as a residence. Water is from deep wells and is good and abundant. The town contains about 500 houses and the population may be esti mated at 2,500 souls; the people are mostly cultivators, traders, or muleteers. The only prominent tribes are the Paparis who have dominated the place since they expelled the original Bag owners less than a century ago; the Qaidan wWtS, also comparatively recent immigrants; and some Saiyids: the remainder of the townspeople are a medley of immigrants from other places, such as Bushehna, Dashtis, Khishtis and Kazarunis. The standard of civilisation is higher at Burazjan than is usual in the coast districts about Bushehr, but the inhabitants avoid needless display of well-being and even allow their houses to remain unrepaired lest the Persian Government should be templed to quarter a high official permanently among them, at the same time their attitude towards the Government is somewhat defiant. * In 1906 the son o£ Ibn Sa'ttd seized and deported him, undeterred by hi* Turkisti official statusBUSAITlN 829 The opium-habit is very prevalent. There are several religious shrines of slight importance. There are no local manufactures, but the bazaar contains about 170 shops. Burazjan depends upon dates and agriculture and upon the transit through it of the Shiraz and up-country trade. About 300 mules belonging to Burazjan are employed on the Shiraz route; formerly there were over 500, but many were sold in consequence of scarcity in 1903-04. Burazjan is the only trade centre in Dashtistan and its trade is consequently an epitome of the trade of the district. The exports all go to Bushehr Town and comprise wheat, barley, beans, melons, tobacco, gum, wool, firewood, charcoal and lime : the imports in the contrary direction, for the consumption of town and district, are chiefly prints, rice, coffee, sugar, tea, opium and spices. The currency is Persian, chiefly silver Qrans ; and the Man of Burazjan is equal to 18 lbs. 11 oz. English, giving a Hashim Man (16 ordinary Mans) of 139 lbs. English, Burazjan, though at present farmed along with its dependencies by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, belongs to the Grovernment of Fars and is the seat of the Khan who administers the greater part of the Dashtistan District. He is not himself a Papari but belongs to a tribe called Maiman A Deputy-Governor also resides here on behalf of the Governor-General of Fars, The Indo-European Telegraph Department's line from Bushehr Town to Shiraz passes through Burazjan and is connected at this place with the Persian Government telegraph which goes by Rig, Dllam, Behbehaa and Ahwaz to Muhammareh, Shushtar and Dizful. A village on the west coast of Muharraq Island in Bahrain, 1 mile BUSAITIN north of Muharraq Town. East of the village is a date grove about 300 yards in length by 200 in breadth, in which are situated two wells that supply the village with slightly brackish drinking water. Beneath the date palms carrots and lucerne are extensively cultivated. Busaitin contains about 400 dwellings ) some are of masonry, but the majority are date-mat huts. The inhabitants are Sunnis, chiefly Madhahakah (150 houses); but a few are A1 Bu Kumaih (20 houses), 'Utub and Bani Yas of the Al Bu Falasah section. The inhabitants own 8 Baqarahs, lii Shfvais and SambCiks &gt; ml ^6 Mashuwahs and jollyboats; of these 32830 BUSAITlN are used as pearl boats. Date palms number less than 1,000 : there are a few pomegranate and lemon trees. Donkeys number 8, and cattle 4 only. A torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast of the Persian district of Tangistan at a distance of 4 or 5 miles; the intervening space is occupied by a grass and reed-grown swamp or Mashileh across which^ at about midway between the extremities of the peninsula ; runs a caravan route to the mainland. Extent. —The peninsula measures exactly 12 miles from its north-western tip on which stands Bushehr Town to Ras Halileh at the opposite end: between these points the outline on each side is a convex curve and the maximum breadth ; at midway, is about 3^ miles. A small tail running eastwards from Ras Halileh almost cuts off the Mashileh from the sea. The peninsula is surrounded by the sea on north, west and south ; on the east it is bounded by the Mashileh which at its northern end merges in Khor Sultani, a creek entering Bushehr harbour. Physical features, water and tegetation. —The site of Bushehr Town is rocky and slightly elevated above the sea, but immediately south of it a strip of very low land runs across the peninsula from coast to coast; beyond this low strip the ground gradually rises again, and the remainder of the peninsula is a sort of turtle-back attaining its maximum elevation of 150 feet in the centre at Imamzadeh village. There is a stretch of low cliff along the coast at the south-west corner of Bushehr Town and again in the neighbourhood of Rishehr: south of liishehr the high ground falls away abruptly, at some distance inland, both on the west towards the sea and on the east towards the Mashileh and there are several considerable ravines. One hollow called Andar-i-Buneh Dareh &lt;ujjo.il or Andar Bandar jojl runs down from the middle of the peninsula to its east side, a little south of the telegraph line to the mainland j and parallel to this, on its south side, is a Qanat which taps a subterranean water-supply. The low parts of the peninsula are sandy, the higher are generally of a firm, arable soil; but there are protrusions at numerous places of a soft, porous sandstone rock in horizontal strata, and elsewhere there are considerable stony tracts.BtFSHEHR PENINSULA Wells are numerous^ but there is no really good drinking water in the peninsula; the best is obtained from a shallow well near the beach at Bandar Halileh and some of respectable quality at a spot called Naidi between 1 and 2 miles south of Bushehr Town. Here and there a little grass is found. An occasional ber and tamarisk are the only naturally growing trees; but the Babul and cypress are found, also a tree with yellow flowers called Gul-i-Abrisham and another with red of which the name is Panjeh-i-^Arus. Roses grow, but not well: the jasmine, Bougainvillea and oleander flourish. Climate. —The climate resembles that described in the article on Bushehr Town, but on the higher parts of the peninsula the heat is less oppressive in summer. The cold weather is frequently ushered in by dust- storms. In winter white clouds, formed by exhalations from the Gulf meeting the cold air of the mountains, cling to the summits and seaward slopes of the great maritime range to the east of the town ^ and are sometimes carried by a change of wind down to the coast itself. Storms are frequent in December and are sometimes accompanied by thunder and hail. Population, —The inhabitants of the Bushehr peninsula, apart from Bushehr Town which forms the subject of a separate article, number about 8,500 souls and belong to mixed tribes. A number of the wealthier natives of Bushehr Town have gardens and country houses in the northern part of the peninsula and live there, driving or riding every day to their business in the town. The inhabitants of the villages of the peninsula own about 300 rifles exclusive of those in the possession of the Kadkhuda of Rishehr's levies. Agriculture and trade. —A large proportion of the peninsula consists of arable land, which in partis cultivated regularly by means of wells, and in part after a more desultory fashion by rainfall. The ordinary crops are wheat and barley, sown about December after the beginning of the winter rains and reaped after 4 months. The seed is scattered on the surface of the unprepared ground and is then turned in with a light plough drawn by a single bullock or even donkey. In places there are date-groves, but not of a thriving appearance. A peculiar feature of the peninsula is its viticulture, conducted after a somewhat curious method. The vines are planted in deep pits or wells, led to the surface of tbe * A sketch of these hills as seen from the sea will he found in Chart No. 2378-27, Ahu Shahr,BtTSHEHR PENINSULA ground^ and then trained over rockeries of loose stones; each vine-pit and mound is surrounded by a low dry-stone wall and forms a circular endosure with, an average diameter of about yards, some being less and some considerably more. The vines of Eishehr are particularly prolific and it is said that one at that place used to yield nearly 2,000 lbs. weight of fruit every year. The grapes find a market in Bushehr Town. The number of date palms in the peninsula is from 15,000 to 20,000. Other fruits are water melons, marsh melons, oranges, lemons, pomegranates, citrons and figs, and there are a few Purtuqal or Baghdad oranges. Vegetables of all sorts are grown, including cucumbers, pumpkins, brinjals, tomatoes and bindis in summer, and carrots, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, beans, mint, lettuce and chillies in winter ; the lettuce of Bushehr has a high reputation in Persia. Potatoes are very little grown and are imported from Shiraz and Karachi. There is no trade apart from that of Bushehr Town, and no other port exists except a few small boat-harbours which are little used except by the fishing craft of adjoining villages. Communications. —The only road in the peninsula fit for vehicles—and those of strongly built types—is one 6 miles in length from Bushehr Town to Sabzabad ; it is maintained at the expense of private subscribers, under the supervision of the British Residency, and has a branch to Rishehr. The land routes* from Bushehr Town to Bandar 'Abbas, Muhammareh and Shiraz all leave the peninsula by one common crossing about 5 miles south-east of Bushehr Town, Here it may be noted that the Shif route was closed in 1906 by the Governor of the Gulf Ports in favour of the route by Ahmadi, and that caravans from up-country were then obliged to come to Bushehr Town and encamp outside the walls. This change was due chiefly to the extortions practised at Shif by the Khan of Angali, who paid 4,800 Tumans a year for the right to collect tolls at Shif ; but in 1906 it was intended to continue the new arrange ment and to build a large caravansarai just outside the town. The Shif route Was always unpopular because there was no warehouse for goods at Shif, and transport animals could not be kept nearer to that place than at Khushab whence it was Necessary to fetch them when required. Three cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, 2 from Jashk and 1 from Fao, are landed a few hundred yards to the west of Rishehrfort and conducted overland for about one mile north-eastwards to the telegraph station which consists of 6 or 7 large buildings. The * See Routes in Persia I, Nos. 20, 21 and 23.BtTSHEHR PENINSULA 383 European signalling staff, formerly 25 strong, has been reduced to 14 since the introduction of automatic long-distance instruments which render manual repetition unnecessaiy. From the Rishehr telegraph office three land lines run across the peninsula and the Mashileh to the coast and thence to Shiraz. A short line runs direct from the office to the British Resident's liouse at Babzabad, and another line accompanies the Shiraz line to the coast of the peninsula and then strikes northwards to Bushehr Town where instruments in the British Residency and the Persian telegraph office are connected with it. The British town Eesidency is thus placed in communication with Sabzabad, and the Persian telegraph office with Shiraz. through the Rishehr office ; and the Persian office in the town is almost continuously in possession of one of the 3 wires to Shiraz. Administration. —The present Kadkhuda of Rishehr, a refugee of the family of the Khan of Angali, farms the land revenue of the peninsula for 500 to 600 Tumans a year. He maintains a body of 35 to 40 men armed with rifles, who act as a sort of police in the villages and supply personal escorts to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Bushehr peninsula is naturally under the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports who has his head-quarters at Bushehr Town.

The holding ground in Khur Daireh is good and the soundings 3 to 4 fathoms, but the approach in many parts has only 15 to 17 feet of water and the anchorage is a rough one in a Shamal. The bottom being very soft steamers drawing 15 feet can reach Khur Daireh in any state of the tide unless a Shamal be blowing, when it becomes necessary to wait for high tide. Steamers drawing from 19 to 20 feet can generally be brought in upon the highest high water of the 34 hours. The outer anchorage, that ordinarily usfed by steam vessels calling at Bushehr but exposed both to the Shamal and to the Sharqi, is in 5 fathoms at about 5 miles west by south of the town. Here steamers drop anchor and wait to be relieved of their mails and cargo and to receive fresh shipments by a fleet of native sailing boats which, if it suits the convenience of the boatmen and the Hammalbashi, immediately put off from the town under a full press of canvas. A deep creek about 200 yards broad, called Khur Sultani runs past the east side of Bushehr town in a south-easterly direction towards the Mashileh; it is unfortunately divided from the inner anchorage by a bank 1| mile broad on which the soundings are only 5 and 6 feet; the bottom here is hard sand and a good channel could probably be dredged. At Pudar 1^ miles above the town this creek, which has many soundings of over 20 and some of more than 30 feetj forks; one branch continues south-eastwards to the Mashileh, while the other, styled Khur Shakari Lf/*, bearing at first to the north-east, sweeps round in a great semi-circle and eventually rejoins the bay at its northern end. On this creek, near the place where it opens again into the bay and is called Khur Bandargah is Shif in the AlXgali District, a landing-place for travellers to the interior. Between the curving creek just described and the open bay is enclosed a mass of mud-flats, sand-flats and low islands. The principal island, divided into two parts— viz., Shaikh Sa'ad ^ to the north and ' Abbasak to the south—which are separated by a shallow channel named Khur -i-^Abbasak, easily fordable at low water, is long and narrow with an extent from north to south of over 4 miles ; it forms a low plain covered in places with coarse grass and is largely overflowed by the sea at the highest spring-tides. At the northern extremity of Shaikh Sa'ad, not far to the west of Shif, is a village called JazTrah of 50 houses of boatmen and fishermen, Arabs of the Bani Tamim or Dumukh Dawasir tribe, pr originally from Kuwait, who are all Sunnis and speak both PeysianPart of the town of Bushehr.BtTSHBHR TOWN and Arabic. On the eastern shore o£ 'Abbasak towards the end nearest Bushehr town, are a hospital and the Bushehr quarantine station. Between 'Abbasak and Pudar is a small island called Muharraq or Shah Zangi , which is covered at the highest springs and whence mud is brought for house building in the eastern part of the town ; and west of this, facing Bushehr town across Khur Sultani, are mud and sand flats which are dry at low water springs. These flats end westward in a seaweed-covered spit called Alafdan which forms the northern side of the Khur Sultani entrance, the southern side being constituted by a sand bank, called Raq'at-as-Safli, JliUJI , that dries m patches and is a subaqueous prolongation of the Bushelir Peninsula, These marine surroundings of Bushehr are at once so indefi nite in their outline, so flat and so extensive, that the eye is of little aid m arriving at a comprehension of them, and even on the spot recourse must frequently be had to a map or chart. Site,hull dings and topography. —Bushehv is a compact town, and the closeness of the houses together, their height and the elevation of the rocky ground on which they stand—the last being in parts 40 feet above sea-level—impart to it an appearance somewhat more distinguished than is usual in towns of the Persian Gulf littoral. The lofty Badglrs which were once a distinctive feature of the place have, however, ceased to be conspicuous ; there are now only 3, of which 2 are old, and it is considered unlucky to build new ones. The houses are of stone and nearly all have an upper storey : none have 2 storeys and few have only aground floor. Altogether there are only about 1 ,400 houses, but the population is dense and out of proportion to the number of dwellings. The ordinary building material is a friable conglomerate of sand and shells from adjacent quarries in the peninsula; it is rapidly eroded by the action of the weather and the aspect of the older houses is consequently one of decay. The town contains no open spaces deserving of mention, and such courtyards as tlie larger mansions may possess are enclosed and l hidden from view. The winding lanes, which are the only streets^ though narrow, are not inconvenient in ordinary weather j but in rain the trench which runs down the centre of each becomes a mere sewer of mud. The town was formerly walled on the landward, that is on the south side; but the rampart, where not actually demolished, is now almost altogether concealed amid the recent extensions of the town in this direction, and only traces of it are here and there visible. The town is divided into four principal wards or Mahallehs styled Behbehani &gt;Dehiashti »•&gt;, Khashshabi and Kuti •342 BtTSHBHR TOWN Behbehani is the most northern, Dehdashti is on the east, Kuti is at the south-west corner and contains the British Residency from which it is named/and Khashshabi appears to be more or less central. Besides these there are two small quarters inhabited by Jews, the more import ant being at the north-west corner of the town and the other at the south-east corner near the Chaharburj. At the northern end of the town is a solitary open space, called Basidun , between which and the water's edge is situated a block of buildings containing the Persian Imperial Customs establishment and the Persian post office. The premises of the Imperial Bank of Persia are in the town, hut they front upon this welcome piece of unencumbered ground } from the latter diverge the two principal thoroughfares of Buehehr, one skirting the sea face on the west side of the town and the other following more or less closely the bank of the Khtir Sultani upon the opposite side. The esplanade upon the seaward side runs at some height abote the beach ; it is narrow and crumbling but can boast some of the handsomest edifices in Bushehr. Among them are—to proceed from the north uj Southwards—the Amiriyeh a large mansion built by the Darya Baigi when he was Governor of the Gulf Ports and at present inhabited by the principal Customs officials, two blocks of buildings occupied by the Bussian Steam Navigation and Trading Company, and finally the British Political Residency. The last is a large walled tenement consisting of two courtyards, one behind the other and each completely surrounded by buildings j the buildings face inwards and on two sides of each courtyard they rise to an upper storey. A little beyond the British Residency, on the sea face, is an Ab Ambar J oi ' water reservoir constructed for the public benefit, by the Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was Governor of Bushehr^ about 60 years ago • and beyond this again is the Turkish Vice-Consulate, where the town ceases and there is a native Cemetery on ground supported by a sea cliff about 15 feet in height. Tbe way round the opposite side of the town is more confined and obstructed, and the pedestrian may either pass from the Customs yard along the busy quays of Khor Sultani or plunge into the main bazaar to emerge finally at the Chaharburj or Persian Government offices, there rejoining the Khor Sultani at the extreme south-eastern corner . of the town, The Chaharburj is a large building with a flagstaff; and outside it, on the Maidan which extends towards Jabri, stand the time-guns which regulate the meals of the populace in the month of the Ramazan fast, are fired daily at dawii and sunset, and are used also for saluting purposes..t %* f I * % % IAI -SI i E r F i: I t copyright. The Sea Front, Bushehr Town. .BtrSHBHR TOWN 34S Climate and sanitation.—lUhe hottest month at Bushehr is August and the coldest months are January and February ; in summer the thermo meter has been known to rise to 115'5 0 in the shade, the moistness of the atmosphere rendering this temperature much more trying than m other places, and in winter to fall to 82° F. The period most dreaded is between the 20th of July and the 15th of September, when the temperature seldom rises much above 100° F. but the difEerence between the wet and dry bulb readings is sometimes only 3°. The normal rain fall is about 12inches per annum, but as little as 4 inches may be leceived. The most frequent winds are northerly, those from the north west apparently predominating, and after them those from the north-east and north. December, January and February are stormy and cold months; March and April are pleasant; May is hot and dry; during June and part of July the increasing heat is mitigated by the Shamal; then follows the period of extreme discomfort, already described ; after the middle of September the weather gradually becomes cooler. 'Ihe sanitary condition of Bushehr is bad, for the subsoil is riddled with cess- pools which are seldom cleaned out, and in the vicinity there are cemeteries where the dead are buried in shallow graves; yet the plaice is not unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease among the native population. Ophthalmia and other eye diseases are rife, caused by flies, glare, dust and the insanitary habits of the people. Fovulation. present population of Bushehr Town is estimated at 15,000 souls. As will appear from the table below, which is not exhaustive, it is composed of extremely heterogenous elements.; but it is predominantly Persian, and Persian is almost the only language heard, for though about J of the people know Arabic few of them speak it abitually. The following are the most important, numerically or other wise, of the classes represented at Bushehr :— Persians.

There are also a Kulah-i-Tarmah or soft hat, which goes with a white turban styled 'Amameh or Shal , and a Kulah-i-Safid made of white shirting; the latter is used by Mullas and merchants and is covered by a white turban of local pattern. The ordinary costume of well-to-do men at Bushehr now consists of a long coat, waistcoat, pantaloons, woollen socks and imported shoes ; but elderly and religious persons still affect the robe confined at the waist b y a Kashmir or Calcutta shawl, the loose drawers, the white Shiraz socks., and the broad-cloth cloak which were universal 20 years ago. The females of Bushehr wear a black mantilla and sometimes a black netted veil ; those of the lower classes have stockings of yellow leather called Chakmeh ; and those of the upper classes use, outside their houses, a kind of silken trouser which fits like a stocking over the foot and lower leg and is baggy above the knee. If it be permissible to include in one general description so mixed a body as the population of Bushehr, it may be said that they are physically well-developed and, mentally quick and intelligent; but that their naturally well-bred and agreeable manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and that they are inclined to be uncivil to foreign^ ers, though less so than formerly. Trade and — Bushehr, despite the natural disadvantages under which its harbour labours, is still the chief gateway of foreign trade in Southern Persia; and the volume of business depending on this circum stance is increased by the consumption of its own not inconsiderable population. The market of Shiraz is chiefly, and that of Isfahan to a great extent, supplied with imported goods through Bushehr. The imports of Bushehr were valued, between 1901 and 1903, at £701,000 per annum. The principal commodities imported from 1899 to 1906 were the following, of which the average annual values in lacs of rupees are given in brackets: cotton piece-goods (63^), sugar (18), tea (11§), grain and pulse (6), metals (5), dyeing and colouring materials (3J), provisions (3), woollen goods (2i), silk piece-goods (2), hardware and cutlery (2), yarn and twist (If), spices (1|), drugs and medicines (1^), glass and glassware (1), haberdashery (1), and silverware and jewellery (1). Of these principal imports, cotton piece- goods were chiefly from the United Kingdom, while the remainder—except346 BtrSHEHR TOWN &lt; . -f ' f sugar and silk piece-goods from France and glass and glassware from Germany—were mostly of Indian origin. The annual value of Busliehr exports during the period 1901-08 was estimated at £350,000, or half that of the imports. During the 7 years 1899—1906 the chief articles of export were, according to the same notation, as has been used for imports above: opium (351), gums of all sorts (8), carpets (6f), wheat (5^), almonds and kernels (Sf), hides and skins (2}), tobacco (2), raw cotton (li), cotton piece-goods (re-exported) (1J) and rosewater (1). In most of these commodities the principal customer was the United Kingdom but the destination of the opium was for the most part China, of the tobacco Turkey and Egypt, of the cotton piece-goods Turkey and Bahrain, and of the remainder India. The only manufacture at Bushehr is of copper coffee-pots which find a market at various places in the Persian Gulf. Local trade at Bushehr is conducted in the bazaars which are situated on the east side of the town adjoining the Khor Sultani; the principal of these is clean, lofty, roofed over, and some 200 yards in length ; it is somewhat winding and at its south-eastern end breaks up into several smaller bazaars chiefly occupied by dealers in food. In all, the bazaars contain about 600 shops, and the goods exposed for sale, consisting mainly of provisions, clothing materials, hardware and miscellaneous aitides, aie varied and of passable quality : Manchester prints, Shiraz tobacco, Java tea described as Chinese, Shiraz and Bandar ' Abbas carpets and Russian teapots, together with grains, spices, vegetables and fruit, are the commodities most in evidence. Standards of weight are a Bushehr Man of 7} lbs. English and a Hashim Man consisting of 16 Bushehr Mans and equal to 124 lbs. English. Shipping,—The shipping of Bushehr comprises 50 to 60 Mashuwahs of 10 to 15 tons and manned by 6 or 7 men each, which run only between the town and the harbour j about 50 Sambuks, Bums and large Mashu wahs of 30 to 40 tons, which make voyages to all the principal Gulf ports; 4 Baghlahs of 50 to 60 tons; and about 20 still larger vessels which visit Karachi, Bombay and Zanzibar. Besides these there are about 850 fishing boats. The port of Bushehr was visited in 1905-06 by 158 steamers with a tonnage of 198,278 ; of these all but 5 were British. Stipplies.

Here it is only necessary to refer to his headquarters establishment and that of the Persian Imperial Customs which is independent of his control. The force at the disposal oE the Governor in Bushehr consists nomi nally of one battalion of regular Persian infantry and 50 artillerymen, but in fact, in addition to a few mounted irregulars whom he maintains as a personal escort, he has only 200 infantry and 20 gunners under his orders. Six breech-loading mule guns belong properly to Bushehr, but one of them is now (1906) at Burazjan and another at Shushtar; * there are also about 25 muzzle-loading guns, but these are practically Useless. The regular garrison seldom receive pay and for the most part gain a livelihood by working as labourers, barbers, etc., in the town, an arrangement which is facilitated by their having no professional duties to perform: though dressed in ragged uniforms of blue cloth with red facings, their appearance is unmilitary and spiritless, promising little advantage to their employers in any kind of warfare. The Governor's power at sea is representeil by the ' Persepolis ' gunboat of 600 tons and 450 horse-power; she was launched at Bremerhaven in 1885, her extreme speed is now 6 knots, and she carries 6 guns (4j-inch B. L. Krupps) and 24 Snider rifles. The offices of the Gulf Ports administration are situated in the Chahar- burj building, already mentioned, which is also the private residence of the Governor unless he is accompanied by his family; in the latter case he hires a house in the town or near it. The Governor is supposed to attend to business at the Chaharburj every day except Friday from early morning until the middle of the afternoon ; and here the bastinado or Falak tJJi is still administered under his orders according to Persian custom. There are no regular tribunals. Civil disputes are ordinarily settled by the ecclesiastical authorities, nominally in accordance with the law of the Quran. Such criminal and other cases as come before the Governor are disposed of by executive order, according to his caprice, and without reference to any code of law. The Imperial Persian Customs, at present under Belgian management, have their principal office in the Persian Gulf at Bushehr. The customs wharf is at the northern extremity of the town, as already mentioned &gt; and the European officials are accommodated in the Amiriyeh mansion, once before alluded to.

The British Political Residency, Bushehr.BtTSHBHR TOWN and a white metal badge on the front of a black Persian cap are now met with at every corner in Bushehr; in appearance at least they are the least discreditable part of the administration. The Persian telegraph, like the Customs^ is exempt from the control of the G-overnor; it is subject to the Minister of Telegraphs at Tehran. The British Residency Surgeon is Port Health Officer, and the penal ties for infraction of quarantine regulations are enforced by the Customs authorities; the latter now hold charge of the local treasury also and pay all official salaries. The quarantine station is on the ; Abbasak island in Bushehr bay, Foreign representation and Great Britain is represented by a Consul-General, a member of the Indian Political Service, who is also British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To his staff belongs the Residency Surgeon, just mentioned in his capacity of Port Health Officer, a member of the Indian Medical Service; this officer usually enjoys a considerable private practice in the town and many natives have recourse to the charitable hospital in the Residency, of which he is in charge, for medical and surgical treatment. The Resident has also 2 Assistants of the Indian Political Service. A British Vice- Consul of the Levant Consular Service was posted to Bushehr for the first time in 1904 and arrived in November of that year ; he is subordinate to the Consul-General, and his special functions are to attend to com mercial matters and to protect the interests of British trade, especially during the frequent inevitable absences of the Consul-General from headquarters on political duty elsewhere. A British post office is main tained in the Residency, the mails being shipped and landed direct without passing through any Persian office ; and there was until recently a treasury of the Government of India in charge of the Resident but in 1905 it was abolished and the financial business of the Residency was transferred to the Imperial Bank of Persia. There are at Bushehr (including officials) 34 European British subjects 48 Muhammadan British subjects, and 25 British subjects of other races (Armenians, Goanese, etc.). Apart from the military guard and a few domestic servants there are no Hindus. European British firms represented at Bushehr are 8 in number, and there are 4 Muhammadan houses of business and 2 others which enjoy British protection. Russia is the only other Power represented by a Consul-General. The principal Russian interest, not purely political, in Bushehr is the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company which occupies a double block of buildings on the sea front. France, Germany, the350 BQSHEHR TOWN Netherlands and Turkey are each represented by a Vice-Consul. There ig a small French school for the teaching of the French language. BUZIYEH Hj! or BIZIYEH m or BtJZI The largest town in the Fallahiyeh District of Southern 'Arabistan, more populous than the capital town of Fallahiyell, from whidi it is distant 3 miles eastwards. Buziyeh is situated on both banks of Khor D5raq[ within a mile of its head, a miles south of the end of the Jarrahi River at Khazineh, and at a distance of about 35 miles via Khor Doraq from Khor Musa; but it is accessible to native sea-going craft of as much as 150 tons; at Buziyeh the creek is wide enough for two good-sized native vessels to pass one another at high tide, and is spanned by a narrow timber bridge, 60 feet in length, which connects the two parts of the town. At Buziyeh the water of Khor Doraq is drinkable, but only when the sea ebbs; its level varies with the state of the tide, of which the range is about 6 feet. The Khulfi and Buziyeh canals from the Jarrahi River separate from each other about 11 miles northwards of Buziyeh and a little above the head of Khor Doraq; after dividing they pass the town at a few hun dred yards distance on the east and west sides respectively and eventually both fall into Khor Doraq, the former from its left and the latter from its right bank, at some distance below the town. The nucleus of Buziyeh consists of a bazar of about 25 shops situated on the western bank of the Khor ; the remainder of the settlement is scattered amidst interminable date groves and intricate water-courses, making its size difficult to estimate ; but the total population is placed at about 8,000 souls- The inhabitants, except some Kuwait Arabs and some Persians who have settled here for trade, and a few Sabians who are chiefly goldsmiths, all belong to the Ka'ab Arab tribe ; the sections to which they belong, chiefly of the A1 Bu Ghubaish subdivision, are shown in the article on the Ka'ab. The chief occupation is date culture, but Buziyeh is also the only port and the chief centre of trade in the Fallahiyeh. District j to some extent it serves the Jarrahi District also. The principal exports are dates, rice, wheat, barley, matting, palm leaves, trunks for firewood, etc., melons and a little wool. With the rest of the district the town is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammareh who administers it through an agent, at present Shaikh Rizaij of the A1 Bu Ghubaish section of the Ka'ab tribe. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here, with premises at both ends of the bridge over Khor Doraq, but it is believed that the smuggling of arms and other goods, for which the place was once notorious, has not yet entirely0 OHAHBAR BAT 351 ceased; the local Mudlr of Customs is under the orders of the Director- General at Muhammareh Town. There is also a Persian post office. The thick date groves and steep-sided canal which surround Buziyeh are its only defences : by manipulation of the canals it could be rendered even more difficult of approach than it is in ordinary circumstances. Buziyeh may perhaps be identical with the Basiyan of the medijeval Arab geographers.* A considerable village in the Dashtistan district of the Persian CHAH Coast and the head-quarters of an Arab Shaikh who rules it, along with KIJTAH several adjoining villages, in subordination to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Chah Kutali is situated about 16 miles south by westof Burazjan and 18 miles east by north of Bushehr Town. It consists of about 150 houses of Dumukh Arabs, who are connected with the Dawasir of Bahrain and were until recently all Sunnis but are now many of them Shi'abs; there are also a few Persians of the tribe called Zanganeh. Wheat, barley, melons and dates are grown, and the people own 300 donkeys and some camels. There are two small mud and stone forts and about 70 of the fighting men of the place are said to be mounted. Theie are no shops, but a little trade is carried on in private houses. The other villages in the jurisdiction of the Chah Kutah Shaikh are Davirah, Husainaki, Kunarabadi, Muhammad Ahmadi, Tul Ashki and Abu Tavll. The best, and indeed the only, harbour on the coast of Persian Makran: CHAHBAR the part of it which can be used by large vessels is however entirely open to southwards. The bay is of horse-shoe form, slightly wider within BAY t than at the entrance, of which the eastern and western points, called Ras Chahbar and Ras Puzim, ^ respectively, are 8 miles apart ; Chahbar point is low and rooky with sandhills and a rocky spit, while Pazim is cliff, about 200 feet high, and has no reef off it; on Chahbar point there is a small square tomb. The maximum depth of the bay from the entrance northwards is a bout 11 miles, and the shore on both * Vide Le Strange 7 t A plan of this bay is given as an inset in Chart No. 2383-38, Matkat anaH m ri% Pt ;r !

Between Chahbar point and Chahbar Town, however, there is a sandy beach which increases in breadth from 10 yards at the point to 200 yards at the town; the town is 1 i miles within the point, on the eastern side of the bay. On the same side the land rises to a plateau which behind Chahbar Town attains a height of about 400 feet; but the rest of the perimeter of the bay is low and swampy. The soundings diminish from 8 fathoms at the entrance to 6 fathoms at the place where the shores cease to be rocky and become low; the whole inner part of the bay is very shallow. The bottom is sand of various degrees of fineness; nowhere does deep water approach the beach. The monsoon blows here as a fresh south-south-easterly breeze which dies away at night, and during its continuance a strong swell runs into the bay and breaks heavily all round its circuit except at the town of Chahbar. A Shamal causes inconvenience at Chahbar, but good shelter can then be found on the Puzim side of the bay : Shamals are fairly frequent in 'winter. Tidal streams are hardly felt in the bay ; the rise and fall of the tide is about 9 feet. On the east side of the bay are the town of Chahbar and the village of Tiz; at the head of it, a few miles inland, the village of Parag; and on the west side the village of Kunarak. North-north-east of the head of the bay, at 13 miles inland, is a peak of the maritime range ^,259 feet in height. CHAHBAR The name is said to be a corruption of the Persian Chah Bagh ^ ^ the derivation is donbtful: by Persians it is sometimes spelt Chaharbar TOWN Chahbar, the most central and at present the principal port of Persian Makran, is situated in a small cove in Chahbar Bay miles within the eastern point, and is distant 180 miles east by south from New Jashk and 55 miles west by north of Gwatar, the two other ports of the country ; the important town of Gwadar is 106 miles east by south of Chahbar. Chahbar belongs to the Gaih district. Site and surroundings. —-The town stands on low ground less than quarter of a mile from the beach, at half a mile from which native vessels find an anchorage in 2 fathoms of water: the anchorage for larger vessels is at double the distance off shore in 4 fathoms of water with a sandy bottom. Along half a mile of the shore opposite the town boats of 5 feet draught can approach to within 20 yards of the shore at low tide. To the north of the town, at a distance of less than 2 miles, rises the escarpment, nearly vertical n places^ of a table land over 700CHAHBAR TOWN 353 feet high ; while close to the southward are orchards and date plantations, reaching part of the way to Chahbar point. Climate. —Chahbar is regarded as a healthy place : the climate is more equable and considerably cooler than that of New Jashk, but in June and July it is somewhat trying. In 1903, the maximum cold weather temperature in the shade was 87° and in 1904 it was 90° : the hot weather maxima in 1903 and 1904 were 99° and 94°. The minima were not registered. The normal rainfall is 5 to 6 inches a year, but the amount fluctuates. The rainy season is from December to February. Inhabitants.—The population of Chahbar is about 2,300 souls, chiefly Maids and Buzdars. Hindus number 60 and Khojahs 140 souls, includ ing women and children. The language spoken is a Makrani dialect of Baluchi, but Hindustani is generally understood. Persian is rarely heard and is unintelligible to the majority of the people. The houses are chiefly mat huts, except the residences and shops of the British Indian traders which are of stone and mud. A mud fort, which was once a distinctive feature and stood in the centre of the town, is now a hopeless ruin. Resources and supplies—The drinking water of the place is sweet and abundant; it is obtained from numerous wells among the gardens. About 500 sheep and goats are kept by the inhabitants, but there are no cattle. It is believed that with a month's warning about 2,500 camels could be collected here for transport. Large quantities of fish are netted m the bay, but they are generally coarse and of poor quality. Grass is unobtainable, but camel grazing is abundant throughout the year, and fodder is procurable from the interior in large quantities. Fuel is scarce. Good stone for building and roadmaking can be quarried at a place half a mile west of the Telegraph Office. Trade and shipping.—Chahha.!- is the principal port of Persian Makran and the character of its business will be apparent from the para graph on trade in the article on Persian Makran. The value of the exports is about Rs. 150,000 and that of the imports about Rs. 100 000 annually; the exports are barley, wheat, jowari, raw cotton,'da], gbi fash, sharkfins, isinglass and hides and to a small extent dates; imports are cotton, silk and woollen goods, sugar, rice, flour, kerosine and cocoanut oil, and (in small quantities) spices, indigo, iron, copper, tobacco, alum, beads and teak planks. To the place belong 12 vessels of 20 to 100 tons burden carrying crews of 8 to 20 men; these ply to Karachi, Bombay, Masqat and Bahrain; they draw 7 to 9 feet of water; 2a354 OHAHBAR TOWN used as lighters they are capable on the average of carrying about 100 men each. Besides these there are 7 smaller boats. Trade is chiefly with India, and * Hindu and 1 Muhamraadan Indian merchants under British protection are engaged in general business here. Administrative and 'political matters— V kq local executive authority is a Wali, and the Persian Imperial Customs are represented by a Mudir and his subordinates ; the Wali was formerly nominated by the Chief of Gaih, but the present incumbent of the post received his appointment from the Persian Imperial Customs. The Indo-Furopean Telegraph Department have an office here on their land line between Gwadar and New Jashk, with both of which places telephone eommnnica* tion is mentioned; the telegraph building is a substantial one and is situated about half a mile south of the town. There are also stone barracks built by the Government of India in 1902 for the accom modation of a native officer, 50 men and a Hospital Assistant of the Indian Army. The head of the telegraph establishment is the local representative of the British Government, in subordination to the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs who has his head-quarters at Karachi, CHARAK 0ne of tlie Shibkuh ports on the Persian Coast; its portion is 34 miles east of Cbiru and 16 miles west-north-west of Mughu. About a mile to the east of the town the Gulshan valley reaches the sea forming a considerable creek, beyond which again is swampy land; the creek is 300 yards wide, and impassable at high tide and after heavy rain. The village has several towers and there are date-groves behind it, over which rises a fort, on a hillock inland of the town, nearly 100 feet high : this fort is reckoned the strongest in all the Shlbkuh P'rts and enables the Charal is to hold their own against the Marzuqi and Hamadi Shaikh*, their neighbours. The general appearance of the place is clean and attractive. Water is partly from tanks and partly from wells 15 feet deep. The anchorage is good in easterly wind* but some swell is experienced in a Shamal.*' The population consists of 170 houses of Al 'Ali, who are Sunnis, The people have some cultivation of dates ani other crops, but the majority are N akhudas, sailors and pearl- divers, and a few are merchants. They own about 8 trading vessels (Baghlahs, Ghunchahs and ^ambuks) which run as far as Basrah on the one side and Masqat on the other, occasionally even visiting India; and * A plan of the anchorage and coast adioining Charak forms an inset Admiralty Chart, No. 2373—2837-A., Persian Qulf.OHIRU 355 they have also about a dozen regular pearl-boats which cross the Gulf, and rather more than a dozen smaller craft which are used for fishing and for pearl-diving off the neighbouring island of Qais. The revenue of Charak, together with Tavuneh and the island of Qais, amounts to 1,600 Tumans per annum and is payable to the Governor of Bastak. The Shaikh of Charak and its dependencies, viz., Tavuneh; the villages of Gulshan, Bavirdun ; and part of the village of Duwan in the district of Ling eh, is Salih-bin-Muhammad Salih, a childless man who has associated a nephew with him in his government: he is noted for his greed, and his control over his subjects is insecure. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post at Charak. One oi the Shibkuh ports on the Persian Coast ; it is situated about CHIRU 43 miles s ath-east of # Shivuh and 34 miles west of CMrak, Chiru has a fort and a large date-grove, and lies facing the east in a small bay formed by a low sandy projection running southwards from the main line of the Persian coast; the village is a mile north of the point of the promontory. The bay is easy of access and forms a capital anchorage in a Shamal, but it is exposed to easterly and south-easterly winds * ; the shore is flat and sandy, the water is deep close to the beach, and little or no tidal stream is felt in the anchorage. A very small pearl bank is said to lie east of the village at about | a mile off shore. There are steep hills inland of the village, which is amply supplied with water from 5 reservoirs filled by their drainage. Chiru village consists of about 200 houses of the ^Obaidli Arab tribe, who are Sunnis. They possess some 5 trading vessels, which run all over the Gulf, to 'Oman, and occasionally to Basrah ; also 5 pearl boats which visit the western coast of the Gulf, and a dozen fishing Baqarahs and Shu'ais which are used for sea-fishing and in summer for pearling operations off the adjoin ing island of Hindarabi. The local authority is 'Abdullah-bin-Muham mad ^ Abdur Rasul, 'Obaidli, but he - ordinarily resides at Baikheh Armaki , a place 30 miles distant, leaving a brother in charge of Chiru. The revenue of the Chiru Shaikhdom, amounting to 1,600 Tumans a year, is payable to the Governor of Bastak. There is a post of the Imperial Persian Customs at Chiru. * A plan of the anchorage is given as an inset to Admiralty Chart No. 2373— 2837-A., Persian Gulf.

(See the Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1904.) 2 A 2356 CLARENCE STRAIT This is the English and only general name o£ the passage between Qishm Island and the coast of the mainland ; it is navigable for vessels, but a pilot is indispensable as it is very intricate besides being incom pletely surveyed. The Strait may be divided into 3 reaches. The first is from the eastern entrance between Qishm Town and Bandar 'Abbas to Laft point which is exactly midway between Qishm Town and Basidu ; it is 86 miles in length and it contracts from a width of 15 miles at the entrance to only 1 mil^ in the neighbourhood of Laft. The navigable chan nel, at its western end called Khur Masakeh hugs the Qishm coast and is for the greater part of the way very much narrower than the Strait. The second reach begins at Laft point and continues to a little beyond the village of Guran, a distance in a direct line of 17 miles; its direc tion is more southerly than that of the other two reaches. In this part the strait consists of two branches which separate at Laft point and reunite slightly below Guran; the western is Khur Masakeh the eastern Khur Guran o r ^aiyid Ahmad Khur iMasakeh has a minimum depth in the fair-way of 5 fathoms and does not narrow to much less than half a mile, but the banks, which are steep, are submerged and have nothing to mark their position and this branch is consequently seldom used by pilots. Khur Guran is in places only J of a mile wide and its course is winding, but the banks are well-defined for most of the way by mangroves and the minimum depth, like that of Khur Masakeb, is not less than 5 fathoms. The two Khurs are separated by a mangrove swamp intersected by creeks. Khur Masakeh gives access to the town of Khamir near its right bank and Khur Guran to Laft village on Qishm Island. The length of both Khurs is over 20 miles, that of Khur Guran being the greater by a few miles. The third and last reach of the strait, called Khur Ja'afari reaches from the junction of Khurs Masakeh and Guran to Basidu and is 19 miles in length. As Basidu is approached there is a mud flat extending along the shore of Qishm Island, and also a shoal in mid- channel by the northern side of which ships pass. There is an anchorage off Laft point which is thoroughly well protected from all winds and would form a good harbour for the largest ships; the bottom is fine sand and shell and appears to be good holding •Clarence Strait is beet shown in Chart No. ^375—753, Entrance of the Fenian Gulf.DAGHARAH 367 .^jjj ground* The tidal stream here runs about 2 knots an hour at springs. The land at Laft point slopes upwards to a height of 60 feet; on the mainland opposite the ground is low and quite flat for a distance inland of about 3 miles. An area surrounded on all sides by the larger tract known as Biyadh: DABAISI it is uncertain whether it should be regarded as forming part of the latter or not. The centre of Dabaisi is approximately at the Qarain wells mentioned below. Northwards the tract extends to the latitude of Qatif Town and southwards to a mile or two beyond that of Jabal Mudrah in Barr-adh -Dhahran ; its eastern border runs nearly parallel to the sea shore at a distance of about 7 miles from it^ and its western border is on the average 7 miles further to the west.

At its mouth it is aboiat 70 yards wide and of considerable depth, and it runs at first in an easterly or south-easterly direction for about 12. miles to a town o or group of villages called Dagharah which stands on its left bank. The tribes inhabiting this settlement are the A1 Sa'id, the Al Shibanah, the Al 'Umr, the Al Bu Nail, the Hamad, the Al Zaiyad, the Hilalat and the Mujawir, all of whom are included under the common designation of Aqra', also the Farahinah, Al Bu Rishah and Sindan. At the Dagharah villages the canal divides and subdivides into a number of branches and so creates a moist area producing wheat, barley and rice, inhabited by settled cultivators whose reed-hut villages are scattered here and there over the. waterlogged soil. A few miles further onits waters re- combine into a large reed-bearing marsh with an open space in the centre. From the lower end of this swamp issue small runlets, which^ rapidly uniting one with another, bring back the remaining water of OJ w the Dagharah into one channel called Mikhriyah near a collection of villages known as Maj distant about 16 miles in a straight line from the village of Dagharah and like it situated on the left bank of the stream. The inhabitants of 'Afaj belong to the Bahahithah, Makhadahah, Shaibah, Hamzah, Al Bu Nashi, ■'Ajarij and Al Bu Rashid tribes, and they are spoken of collectively as the'Afaj, as if thatalso were the name of a tribe. Below Maj the Dagharah curves round to the south* ward, and possibly rejoins the Euphrates a little above the westernmost mouth of the Shatt-al-Gharaf under the name of Shatt-al-Kar, . The celebrated ancient site of Nifar is 4 or 5 miles to the north of the principal, of the 'Afaj villages. The Dagharah tract is a Nahiyah in the Diwaniyah Qadha, as is also ghatt-al-Kar in that of Shatrat-al- Muntafik. Besides the tribes domiciled at Dagharah and ; Afaj, Al Budair also are found upon the course of the Dagharah canal and give their name to a. Nahiyah of the Dlwaniyah Qadha. A group of small villages upon the coast of the 'Oman Sultanate in the Eastern Hajar district; it is situated about four miles south east of Quryat on a maritime plain that' is bounded inland by steep and rugged hills of limestone and is divided down the centre by a chain of low, stony knolls, on one of which isu a small ruined tower.dah A nah S59 The drainage of W adi Tayin reaches the sea here by several channels passing between and round the villages.

Dates^ fruits, lucerne and cotton are cultivated, and fowls, vegetables and water are obtainable; livestock ate 50 donkeys, 30 cattle and 600 sheep and goats. Water, which is good and plentiful, is drawn from wells 15 to 20 feet deep. Twenty to 25 fishing-boats, but no coasting vessels, are owned here. A belt of sandy desert which runs north-west and south-east be- DAHANAB tween Central Arabia and the Arabian districts of the Persian Gulf and forms a clear and continuous line of demarcation between the two. The Bahanah is also known, particularly towards its southern end, by the less specific name of Nafud.* Its average breadth is about 50 miles, and it extends from about the 29th degree of north latitude to the tropic in the neighbourhood of Jabrin^ or somewhat further. It is flanked on the east throughout the greater part of its length by the non-sandy but almost equally inhospitable tract of Summan: south of Summan it has first Wadi Paruq and then probably the Jabrin oasis upon its eastern •We may note that conversely a small portion of the great Northern Nafud is distinguished by the name of Dahanah : see Najdj Konte No* III, ad fin.m dahAnah border. Where it is crossed by the route between Kuwait and Riyadh it has a breadth o£ two, ordinary marches and consists of seven great sand ridges (with smaller intermediate ones), separated from one another by plains; the ridges vary from a quarter of a mile to several miles in width and the plains from H to 7 miles. The sand of this part has a light-red or reddish-orange tint; the subsoil, where exposed, consists of light clay, pebbles and sandstone debris ; there is some vegetation, and the fauna include gazelle, hare, bustard, snakes, lizards and beetles. The southern Dahanah is also crossed in two average marches by the route between Riyadh and Hofuf ; it has a more confused configuration than the northern, cones and domes of many shapes taking the place of parallel ridges, and the sand is of an orange or deep-red colour. In crossing it here from the west, steep ascents are Hrst encountered, alternating with nearly perpendicular descents down which camels slide bodily j these are followed by an interval of firmer sand with scattered brushwood j near the centre of the tract patches of soil with dark-coloured stones begin to appear through the sand ; beyond the centre the sandhills pass from the form of eminences and hollows to that of long rollers and then to that of steps ; finally progress ceases to be heavy and the country is sprinkled with vegetation. In this part the Dahanah is separated from Summan by a well- defined valley. The nomads of Dahanah, as of Summan, are almost entirely Mutaif. daimani - Also called Saba 5 Jazair yl)?- A chain of islets and rocks, yat 12 miles in length, at a distance of nine miles from the Eatinah coast of the 'Oman Sultanate between Sib and Barkah and nearly parallel to it. The chain may be divided into three sections. The easternmost section consists of one islet ? of a mile long and SI5 feet high called Kharabah } and of several detached rocks which belong to it. A channel three miles wide divides the eastern from the central section which is four miles long, and comprises seven islets of different sizes m a row, 30 to 40 feet high, with low cliffs of a light brown colour ; of these seven islets the largest and westernmost is | of a mile long by i broad. The western section is divided by a channel 3^ miles wide from the central; it consists of one islet, Jazirat Jun and 3 rocks above water and extends 1 \ miles east and west in a straight line. The main islet of this section is | of a mile long &gt; very narrow and 107 feet high near its west end: it has a tolerable anchorage in eight fathoms on its south side. All the islets are barren and destitute of fresh water,DAITIR ggj but they are frequented by fisbermen who come over from the mainland in Badans and Shashahs, and pearl-diving is carried on round them on a small scale. A village on the north-west coast of Muharraq Island in Bahrain^ DAIR 2 miles north by east of Muharraq Town : it stands on comparatively high ground and is surrounded by date groves and lucerne fields. Irrigation is from several large wells in which the water stands at about 15 feet from the surface. There are some 800 houses of mud and mats, also three mosques. The people are Baharinah, all engaged in the pearl fisheries ; they own 1 Baqarah and 35 Shu'ais and Sambuks and employ 21 of these in pearling. There are 30 donkeys, 13 cattle and about 1,700 date palms. The full name of the place is said to be Dair-ar-Kahib y.o, or the Monk's Cloister, and ruins still exist of what the Arabs suppose to have been a Christian settlement. An island off the coast of the Abu Dhabi Principality in Trucial DAITINAH Oman near its western end, and about 29 miles north by east of Dalmah island. Daiyinah is low, flat and sandy, bearing scanty grass; the highest part is a black detached rock at the north end, rising about 9 feet above high water. The length of the island is 1^ miles from north- north west to south-south-east and the breadth about 600 yards. A fair anchorage in a Shamal exists close to the south end of Daiyinah. There are several pearl banks in the vicinity, of which the more important are:-Tubabat Daiyinah, 11 miles to the north; Hawad-bin-Mansur, 10 miles to the north-east; Dhahr Daiyinah, 3 miles to the north-east; Bain Daiyinah, 2 miles to the south-east; and Hawad-ar-Raddad, 4 miles to the south-west. Daiyinah belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. A considerable place on the coast of the Dashti district in Persia, 104- miles south-east of Biishehr Town and 9 miles west of Kan gun; it stands at the edge of the sea with a low range of sandstone hills behind DAIYIR362?' DAIYlft it, and on the east side is a large date-grove. One mile off-shore is an excellent anchorage in a Shamal, but a reef makes landing difficult; the inhabitants use as their boat harbour the Bardistan creek which comes down to the sea at 2 miles to the eastward. Daiyir consists partly of stone houses and partly of huts and is protected by a fort with towers. The population is about 5,500 souls, including some A1 Nasur, some Bah- rainis who discharge the functions of Mullas and 'Alims, and some Jews; but the bulk of the people say they are from the neighbouring village of Bardistan in Dashti and claim to have come originally from Kiifah. The inhabitants of Daiyir mostly live by agriculture; but they own, beddes a few fishing-boats, half a dozen sailing-vessels (Sambuks, etc.) which make voyages to Bahrain and other places. As a port Daiyir is the natural outlet of a considerable grain-growing tract, and horses from the Shiraz district were formerly (but are not now) embarked here to escape export duty. At times, wben its neighbour and rival Kangun has been tempo rarily destroyed, Daiyir has managed to secure a large amount of trade, but it has itself suffered vicissitudes of fortune and has twice been burned by the Nasuri Khan of Gabandi* In 1865 Daivir was ruled by a lady who appeared in public and was able to write : she was the mother of the present Khan of Dashti. It is now governed by a son of the Khan as his fatherV deputy and there is a post of the Imperial Persian Customs. A village in the Dashtistan district of the Persian Coast, and a stage on the Bushehr -Shiraz route; it is situated at an elevation of 400 feet about 13 miles north-north-east of Burazjan, being adjoined by hills on the north-east and surrounded on the other sides by date-planta tions. The heat, in summer is excessive. Daliki consists of about 35 houses. of bilingual Arabs, who are Shi'ahs and are said to be the descen dants of immigrants from Bahrain ; they cultivate dates, wheat and barley and own about 40 mules and 40 donkeys. A short distance to the south of the village is a green sulphurous stream. A bitumen pit exists in the plain about 4 miles from Daliki and 1 mile from Qarawal Khaneh, and a deep boring has been made for petroleum by European concession aires, but without success. ^ * Goldsmid's Telegraph and Travel deals with Daliki and its neighbourhood at pages 183—184. daliki*&amp;&gt; DAM 36^B An island off the coast of Abu Dhabi territory in Trucial 'Oman, a DALMAH little to the south of an imaginary line connecting Abu Dhabi Town with the entrance of Khor-al-'Odaid and rather more than twice the distance from the former that it is from the latter. T)almah is elliptical in shape, with its longer axis running north and south, and it has a narrow projec* tion at its southern end. Its length is 5 and its breadth 2i miles, and the surface, except for a. very low, narrow plain at the south end, is hilly, the highest point being 244 feet above sea level. Plenty of brackish water is obtainable from wells, and there are deposits of red oxide of iron which are not at present considered worth removal. A small settlement of about 15 families of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas tribe exists on the west side of the southern plain; the inhabitants wade for pearls in winter, besides diving for them in summer, and are keepers of goats. Dalmah is a place of some importance at the end of the pearl season, when a tempo* rary bazaar of some 10 shops springs up, and a number of persons engaged in the pearl trade meet there to settle their accounts. Among these are the majority of the Indian traders on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, who come here to recover debts and make purchases of pearls. Several pearl banks exist in the vicinity, among which are ;—Umm-as-Sulsul and Manyokh, 8 and 5 miles respectively to the north; Hawad Bin- Musammih, 9 miles to the south-east; Abu Dastur 4 miles to the south west; and, besides several others which are nearer, Halat Dalmah 27 miles to the north-west. Dalmah belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The administrative capital and principal town of the district of Widyan Dawasir in Southern Najd; it appears, to be situated about tnidway between the eastern and western ends of that part of the district which is known as W adi Dawasir. • Site and buildings. —The town is surrounded by a wall-in .which there are four .gateways: internally it is divided into two wards,, 'Ayaidhat oUiax and Shawaiq , to each of which a bazaar or Suq of the same, name is attached. 'Ayaidhat is apparently on the west side of the town and Shawaiq on the east, while Suq Shawaiq is almost in the centre. The two bazaars, which are open squares, are connected by a street that - Widens out between them to form the meat market, known as Maqsab • On tho east side of the town near one of the gateways is the combined fort and residence of the Amir, calledQasr-al-Hasaiyin DAM r ,J o r_ ILDAM rMm DIM which has several high towers. There are four large mosques, two in the ^Ayaidhat quarter and one at each end o£ the Suq-al-Shawaiq j but, as is usual in this part of Arabia, they are without decoration or architec tural features. The ordinary houses of the town are frequently of brick and mortar and rise to an upper storey; sometimes they are whitewashed, and sometimes the lower part of the walls is painted green or red. The fa9ades of the upper storeys are often ornamented with a balcony pro jecting considerably over the entrance door. Inhabitants. —The people are Dawasir of the Rijban division and number perhaps 5,000 souls. They are described as independent in politics, bold in war, and enterprising in trade ; they are reported to be well armed with rifles, and Dam merchants are said to make journeys to both India and Africa in the ordinary course of business. In religion the inhabitants of Dam are Wahhabis or Hanbali Sunnis; the mosques of the town are not many, apparently on account of a local preference for large over numerous congregations. There are about five much frequented schools, of which the Madrasat-bin-Dharman is the best known, and about 15 smaller ones. Female education is unknown here except in the family of the Amir and the houses of religious teachers. Agricultural and other resources, —The date groves are very extensive and contain an enormous number of palms. Other fruits are grown in abundance, and there is some cultivation also of wheat, barley, maize and lucerne, but almost entirely as secondary crops among the palms in the date gardens. Wells are numerous both within the town and outside it; the ordinary depth is about five fathoms, and the water as a rule is only fairly good; inside the walls however there are some excellent wells, notably those of Atainah, Hamaili, Jalib and Mathlah. A large number of camels are owned here and a considerable number of horses; but cattle are scarce and donkeys very few. Trade and industries, —Imported goods, except arms and ammuni tion which are brought from Qatar through Aflaj, are received by way of Yaman and Hijaz. Merchants from Yaman and Najran are said to visit Dam but maintain no permanent business agencies there. Among the crafts exercised in the town are those of goldsmith, blacksmith, tinsmith, carpenter, potter, tailor and oil-presser. The number of shops in the bazaar is said to be very large, but the statistics obtained are not reliable. Swords and daggers of fine temper are made, but the daggers are not equal to those of Hadhramaut. Dam appears to be a rifle-repair-_ DARAlYAH 365 ing and cartridge-loading centre for a large tract of country, including Wadi Sabai' as well as the whole of Widyan Dawasir. It is reported that an attempt was lately made by some mechanics, who had gained experience abroad, to start a rifle factory ; but it proved impossible to turn out weapons which could compete either in quality or in price with those imported from Europe. Administration. —Dam is the seat of an Amir whose power is absolute in the town and extends in a modified degree to all the villages of W adi Dawasir and Salaiyil. His political position is described in the article on Widyan Dawasir. The quarters of ''Ayaidhat and Shawaiq have each a Shaikh of their own \ both of these Shaikhs are of course in strict sub ordination to the Amir. y ijife A considerable village in the 'Aridh district of Southern Najd ; it is DAEA1YAH situated chiefly on the left bank of Wadi Hanifah about 9 miles above Riyadh. The country immediately to the north of Dara^Tyah consists of open downs. A quarter of Dara'iyah on the right bank of the Wadi is called Taraif those on the left are Saraihah and Ghasibah the bed of the valley between the two is known as Batin Each of the quarters is walled and defended by towers. The p'ace is surrounded by extensive date groves containing perhaps 20,000 palms, and by gardens which produce apricots, figs, grapes, pomegranates and citrons. There are also lucerne, vegetables and the usual cereals. The present population may be about 1,300 souls, viz,,110 houses of Bani Tamim, 50 of Dawasir and 100 of inferior tribes. There is some ordinary trade by resident merchants in coffee, piece-goods, etc., imported from Hasa, Kuwait and Hijaz. Dara'iyah, which was at the time the capital of Najd, was completely destroyed by the Egyptians in 1818, and remained practically uninhabited until 1865 or later. Since then it has regained part of its population and some of its former prosperity. The ruins of the old town are chiefly on the right bank of the Wadi. According to local tradition, when Dara iyah was at the height of ics prosperity a shop there used to let for $30 a month. By the older Arab geographers the name of the place is spelt Dhariyah , k 'A366 DARtP DARTJ' e;; 0 Singular Dara'i . A tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate belonging to the Ghafiri faction: originally they were all nomads of the Ruba'-al-Khali, but some are now settled at Tana'am and other places in Dhahirah. Estimates of their numbers differ very widely : those in Dhahirah may amount to 3^000 souls of whom about one-third are settled. There are also a few at Barkah in Batinah. The Bedouin portion now frequent the neighbourhood of Jabal Hamrah. They are a wild and predatory race and hardly a rising of the eastern tribes occur in which the Daru , are not involved. The Bedouin portion are said to belong to the Ibadhi, the settled portion to the Sunni sect. The Bedouin Daru' rear large numbers of camels which they graze on the confines of the^Great Desert. The following are the sections of the Daru/ : Badiwai Batun Faradis Hadi (Hal Bu) JU. i Janm Khamis (Hal) JU, Khamis (Y al) M ahabinah Maharidah 8^;^, Majali l5 j ^, Makhadir Maraziqah , Muhammad (Hal) 4*.^* JU, Mutawihah Nafafi f Ayal) JUr , Sallm ('Ayal) JUr, Shamatah Sultan (^Ayal) Jlxc, Thuwail cby and Zuwaiyah Their Tamimah is Saif-bin-Hamad of the Hal Muham mad section. DAS The northernmost of the islands in the great bay between Abu Dhabi and Qatar; it lies about 100 miles west-north-west of Abu Dhabi Town^ 67 miles north of the nearest part of the Abu Dhabi coast and rather further from Qatar. Das is only U miles long by f of a mile broad, with hills of regular outline that reach an elevation of 145 feet in the northern half ; the south of the island is low. The e is no water on Das and it possesses no anchorage of any value. It is considered to belong to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and therefore to be included in Trucial 'Oman. The following pearl banks are situated in the vicinity of Das :—Riqqat Das^ 2 miles to the south-east; Riqqat Mani , ; 9 miles to the south-east; U mm-al-Bunduq, 6 miles to the south-west; and Abul Qamaqim, Kharaiyis and Abul Hanainun at 7 and 5 miles and a very short distance, respectively, to the north-west. DASHTI A large and important district of the Persian Coast of the Persian Gulf, inland it begins at 'Arabi, 27 miles, east-south-east of Busll6hrDASHTI 367 Town/aud on the coast at. a point 40 miles south-south-east of the same place; its termination is at the mouth of the Bardistan valley, 105 miles south-east of Bushehr Town, Limits. —Dashti is bounded on the west by the sea, and on the east, approximately, by the seaward face of the main maritime range ; some places connected with it lie in valleys within that range, but none of them are important and they fall beyond the scope of a Persian Gulf Gazetteer. On the north Dashti meets the district of Tangistan, its extreme inland village on this side being ^rabi, as already mentioned, and the extreme coast village Qalat. On the south Dashti meets the district of Shlbkuh; in which the place nearest to Dashti is Kangun. Physical characteristics. —The physical features of Dashti are few and simple. r lhe principal one is, of course, the great maritime range which runs south-eastwards and forms an almost continuous background to the district. Six miles to the north-east of Khurmuj it rises in a grand peak 6,450 feet high which is generally known as Kuh-i-Khurmuj, but possesses also the more distinctive name of Kuh-i-Bairami probably a corruption of Bahrami . South of Khurmuj town for 16 or 20 miles the main range is fronted, towards Dashti, by an outwork of low sandstone hills called the Kuh-i-Kaki ^ , terminated at its south eastern end by a gap, 4 or 5 miles wide, through which the Mund river issues from the highlands of Fars. South of this gap the main range, at Hrst under the name of Kuh-i-Namak resumes its course; and finally it impinge^ on the coast, at Kangun, a few miles beyond the end of the district. Kuh-i-Bairami is a huge mass of limestone having a quaqua- versal dip and is sometimes crowned with snow for 2 or 3 davs in winter. Kuh-i-Namak, ^iOO' 1 feet high, is of sandstone below, and towards the summit consists largely of salt which is visible from afar as glistening streaks of white or grey. A minor but important feature is a sandstone coast range, reaching a height of over 2,500 feet, which bears the name of Kuh-i-Mund or Kuh- i-Kar / and is described in the article on the Tangistan district, to which it partly belongs. The trough contained between this subordi nate range and the main range is the Khurmuj plain or valley, extending from near Ahram to the Mund river, with a length of 30 and a breadth of several miles ; a string of palm-leaf villages extends along its western side and there are a few upon the east also; it drains by a longitudinal channel called Shur which is 10 yards broad and contains above 2 feet of brackish water in places, to the Mund river at Chaghapur.868 DASHTI Kuh-i-Namak is adjoined on its southern side by a range of which the highest point (3,270 feet) is Kuh-i-Darang Jj)*, not far from Kuh-i. Namak. This range runs first southwards for 16 miles and then eastwards for an equal distance : the result is the enclosing between it and the main range of a triangular valley called Bu Saif which has no open exit except at its south-eastern corner on the coast between Daiyir and Kangiin. Kuh-i-Darang is of sandstone and is connected with Kuh-i- Namak by mounds of sandstone and gypsum intersected by ravines containing brackish water. Dashti thus consists of two plains or valleys that both drain south- eastwards and are separated from one another by the plain or serpen tine valley of the Mtind river, of which the average direction is at right angles to theirs. Coast, —The coast of Dashti has not been thoroughly explored and part of it is unapproachable by vessels owins: to extensive shoals. Six miles off the mainland at ai&gt;out 27 miles south-south-east of Khor Ziyarat and approximately the same distance west of Daiyir is a low islet, 4 a mile in diameter, called Nakhilu : it appears to be a meeting-place of several hydrographical features and it marks the point where the direction of tbe coast changes from south-south-east to full east. From Nakhilu a grejit shoal, called Kas-al-Mutaf olkJI ^ runs for nearly 20 miles to the east-south-east with a deep channel inside which is open to the east but blind at the other end except for a boat passage round the north side of Naklalu j and between this shoal and the mainland again is a second thoal with yet another deep channel inside. The inner channel appears to be called Khor Umm-al-Karam r l, from the name of a small island at the head ».f it: the outer is called Khan : both Umm-al-Karam and Khan are excellent havens for native boats and are used as such by the people of the nearest mainland villages. On the north side of the Nakhilu boat passage, already mentioned, begins a narrow strip of sand called Jabrin which runs north-north-west for 6 miles and then joins, or almost joins, the mainland. From Nakhilu northwards to Khor Ziyarat the coast is a mass of swamps and small creeks of which little is known. Climate, —Theelimate of Dashti is accounted good ; both on the coast and inland it is cooler in summer than that of the Bushehr Peninsula. Population, —The population of the district, between the mountains and the sea, is probably not less than 20,000 eouls,DASHTI 369 The following 1 are the better known tribes of the Dashti district Name, nit;, 'Amranis h lei Bahraini8 Faqiha linotii ^ liiecfci; Hajiyan i i &gt; Jatut iloreliiif m w S ' ,;: Khajaha '¥1 ' islet, jn !etiiig]k ^ lUrs [AM ^ Froml p wi tfe 0- Mlrzaha U!U Euuseh jJ^Sadat t to» : obu ®' !i Salih Ahmadis Z Approximate number of souls. 600 A few. 1,000 2,500 1,000 560 Very few.

They are found also in Tangistan District. They are said to have immigrated from Behbehau about a century ago. See article Lurs. These also are said to have come from Behbehan. They are said to be descended from a family of brothers whose mother was a Saiyid, hence the name. Better educated than their neighbours, but depend on charity for their support. Have always been faithful to the present Khan and his father : the Khan conse quently appoints all his deputies from this tribe. Saiyids. The Khans of the dynasty preceding the present one belonged to this tribe. J* ; f t '' lbes are said t0 be of Arab descent ' but near, y all are ^ n0W bl11 ahs ln rell g lo n and speak Persian only. Besides the above there are a number of small and obscure tribes, including the Dabashiha t^bo, 11 ^hdarha Kabganis Khanasir , , Muhallis ^^(Qaidau c/WU, Shaikhanis ,Shaikhha Tangasir rP^r , U ™ ruha and at some villages, especially on the coast, are ound colonies of Arab immigrants from Shibkuh and elsewhere, who are 0m0 y bilingual and belong to the Sunni denomination. The largest place ^ 8■ 'H- 3T0 DASHTI in the district is Daiyir, and after it are Khurmuj and Kaki. The Dashtis differ from their northern neighbours, the Tangistanis, in being peace fully inclined, partially civilised, and comparatively amenable to manage ment. In the larger places their houses are often of stone and mud, but the ordinary villages consist of date-frond huts only ; most villages how ever are defended by one or more Burj Tufangchi or rifle towers of stone and mud. The great bulk of the people are agriculturists or, on the coast, sailors and fishermen ; a few live by trade. They have a number of Martini rifles, but on the whole the Dashtis are not so heavily armed as the residents of the other districts of the Persian Coast; the proportion is about 3 rifles to 5 houses on the coast, and 2 rifles to 3 houses inland. The Dashtis are a healthy, sturdy race, and many of the labourers aud boatmen at Bushehr Town are of their number. Agriculture and trade.—The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates; the date plantations are everywhere watered from wells. There is not the same quantity or variety of fruit as in Tangistan. The waterlift used is called Charkh-i-Chahab ■eWt ^ and is worked by a bullock which is made to walk down an inclined cutting in the ground. Cattle are fairly numerous, and sheep and goats are kept in great numbers. Trade on a small scale is general j but there is nowhere any large bazaar or mercantile centre, unless the towns of Khurmuj and Daiyir may be accounted such. The exports of the district are cattle, ghi, wheat, barley, dates, tobacco, onions, firewood, charcoal and earthenware, also some 'Abas of local manufacture. Imports are cotton piece-goods, rice, coffee, sugar and tea. External trade in both directions is with Bushehr Town, Bahrain, Lingeh and Bandar 'Abbas. The ordinary currency consists of Persian Qrans, but the Indian rupee circulates in some of the coast villages. The standards of weight are a local Man of 5 lbs. 13 oz. English and a Hashim Man of 16 local Mans or 93 lbs. English. The chief port is Daiyir. Communications and transport.—The only known routes in the district are a section of the Bushehr-Bandar 'Abbas route *, which passes through Khurmuj town and leaves Dashti by the gorge of the Mund river, and a route f which runs from Khurmuj town by Kaki to Daiyir on the coast: neither apparently presents any difficulties. * See Routes in Persia, I, No. 20. f Vide Colvill's report forwarded to the Government of India by the Politica Resident in the Gulf with his letter No. 46, dated 4th May 1866, siiM' 1 \0* Wf Listo ipfsiy Iptk liisalpc IriM Ifite lit of 5 1 a £ be: |ati 'agenl jif aac ^ i le foi ilk Id so k] h \«j H !f! ,DASHTI 371 ''''{li 's'tillipl «•« r* *®i|| The total transport of the district is estimated at about 250 horses, 250 mules, 1,250 camels and 3,500 donkeys. Administration, —The Dashti district belongs to Fars, but it is sometimes farmed from the Governor-General of Fars by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. It is administered by a hereditary Khan of reputed Arab descent, at present Jamal Khan, who has his residence at Khurmuj and became master of the district after numerous smaller Khans or Shaikhs had reduced themselves to impotence by their internecine feuds. The Khan pays 16,000 Tumans a year for the district of Dashti to the Governor of Fars or the Governor of the Gulf Ports^ as the case may be. There is no organised police force ; but the Khan^s personal retainers maintain order on the roads, and village affairs are regulated through the headmen. In the larger places there are some highly respected Mullas, whose decisions in civil disputes are accepted by the people. Land revenue is assessed at the rate of 50 Qrans per Gau (250 by 250 yards) of cultivation, and a tax of J a Qran to 2 Qrans is levied per date-palm according to value. There is also a poll tax of 5 to 20 Qrans; this tax is re covered (at the rate of 8 Qrans per annum) from Dashtis at Bushehr Town by agents whom the Khan sends for the purpose. The poll tax is unpopular and, in conjunction with general misgovernment resulting from the incompetence and age of the present Khan, has been responsible for much emigration from the district in recent years. The Khan formerly held in farm and administered several of the Shlbkiill ports to the southward which are outside the Dashti district, and for these he paid ^,000 Tumans a year. Topography.

A district of the Persian Coast in the vicinity of the Bushehr DASHT- Peninsula; the principal place in Dashtistan is Burazjan, situated exactly 1ST AN in the middle of the district and about 38 miles north-east of Bushehr Town. The districts of Mazara'i, Zira, Angali and Shabankareh arem dashtist A n considered to belong geographically to Dashtistan, and it is said that they once formed parts of it in the administrative sense also. Ijimits.'—The length of Dashtistan from Bibara in the north to Chah Kutah in the south is about 30 miles ; and its breadth, which is greatest towards the southern end, averages 10 to 15 miles. On the Bouth Dashtistan reaches to the coast opposite Bushehr Town ; on the west it is enclosed by the districts of Angali and Zira, and on the north-wesi by the district of Mazaral; on the north-east and east it is bounded by hills of which the Gisakan mountain is a part. Physical characteristics.— whole of Dashtistan is a plain, form ing a slight declivity between the mountains on the north-east and the sea coast on the south-west,— a circumstance determining the direction of the various streams and hollows by which the district is crossed. The principal stream is that which passes Daliki and, by uniting with the Eud Shirin, forms the Rud-Mllell River. Of secondary importance are the Ahmadi water-course, which rises in a part of the hills called Bairami passes the village of Ahmadi, and reaches the sea a couple of miles to the east of Shif j and the Chah Kutah gait stream which pursues a parallel and similar course a few miles further to the south-eastward. The part of the district adjoining the hills enjoys less of the sea breeze and suffers from scorching winds in summer between the end of May and the beginning of October ; otherwise the climate resembles that of Bushehr. Traces of sulphur, bitumen and petroleum occur at the north end of the district. Water nearly everywhere is from wells varying between 30 and 50 feet in depth ; these ordinarily contain 4 to 1 0 feet of water and they never dry up. Inhabitants. —The population of the district is exceedingly composite and amounts to about 15,000 souls; at most places they are described as Persians, and in many cases they are believed to be descendants of immi grants from neighbouring Persian districts, especially from Dashti and the direction of Shii az. Deserving of special mention are the Persian tribe of Bag ^ who inhabit the villages of Jimeh, Khushab and KhushaKan in the centre of the district; they were originally the masters of Btirazjan, but were expelled by the Paparis about two generations ago and have now sunk to the level of ordinary cultivators. The Papari and Qaidan tribes are noticed in the article on Burazjan. A few Zanganeh or Zanguis are found, especially at Chah Kutah ; this is a Persian tribe of uncertain origin, but reputed courageous. There are also a numberPASHTISTAN 381 of Arab settlements in the district, the most important being a group in the south-east corner of which Chah Kutah is the largest; this group is inhabited by Dumukh who are a section of the Dawasir tribe of Bahrain and until recently were all Sunnis ; now about | of them are Shi'ahs. Other Arabs, said to be of Bahrain origin but not belonging to any known tribe^ are found north of Burazjan; an'I Arabs calling themselves Bani Hajir , who are believed to have come from the Hindiyan district, occur at three or four scattered points. 'With the exception of the Dumukh and a few of the other Arabs the whole popula tion is Persian-speaking and Shfah. Further details of the population are given in the table of villages at the end of this article. Except in Burazjan the dwellings of the people are nearly all huts or mud houses of an unpretentious kind. Burazjan is the district capital. Agriculture. —The chief products of Dashtistan are wheat and barley, which are grown in winter by rainfall; in summer water melons, musk melons, cucumbers, maize, a little cotton, castor oil, beans, onions, garlic and sesame are cultivated by irrigation from wells. The soil is rich and suitable for the growing of opium; dates also flourish. Livestock is represented by an ordinary proportion of cattle, sheep and goats. The unit of land-measurement is the Gau or that area of land which requires 6 Hashim Mans of seed-grain and can be ploughed by one yoke of animals (whether cattle, horses, mules or donkeys) in about 25 days; it is represented by a square of which the side measures about 250 yards. In a good year the return to cultivation in Dashtistan is from 8 to 16- fold. Dashtistan agriculturally resembles Dashti^ but it is considered the superior district. The cultivators of Dashtistan are many of them embarrassed with debts originating in loans taken at exorbitant rates of interest for the purpose of buying seed-grain. Trade, —Burazjan is the commercial centre of Dashtistan, and the article on it may be consulted for an account of the trade of the district. The standard of weight is a local Man equal to 8 lbs. 11 oz. English, and the Hashim Man of the district ( = 16 local Mans) is equivalent to 139 lbs. English. Communications and transport, —The district contains no natural obstacles to movement; within it lie the first three stages on the ordinary route from Bushehr to Shiraz.'^ The transport resources of the district are estimated at 200 horses, some camels, 350 mules and 2,500 donkeys. Some * See Routes in Fersia, I, No. 23,382 DASHTISTAN quantity of wheat and barley is purchasable locally, but not as a rule until the prospects of the coming harvest are assured ; until this occurs the stocks in hand are hoarded. Administration. —The political organisation of Dashtistan is a patch work of extraordinary complexity. The bulk of the district is under the Governor-General of Fars ; but some of the southern villages, including a group for which the Shaikh of Chall Kutah is responsible, are subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The system of farming the revenues is responsible for further confusion, especially as an indefinite degree of executive power is conferred on the farmer along with the right to collect the taxes, and the more so in the present case that the farmer of the greater part of Dashtistan is the Governor of the Gulf Ports and that he holds it on lease from the Governor-General of Fars. Half or more of the villages to the north of Burazjan are held on a Tiyulor royal grant by the Salar-i-Mu'azzam, who is accountable for them to the Shah only. Burazjan and its dependent villages, forming the greater part of the district, are ruled by the Khan of Burazjan (at present Mirza Husain) who also collects the revenues, a drivilege for which he pays the sum of 5,000 Tumans annually; he is properly answerable to the Governor of Fars, to whose jurisdiction Burazjan has always nominally belonged, but, in consequence of the farm in favour of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, the relations of the Shaikh are at present, it would seem^ exclusively with the Bushehr Government. The Shaikh of Chah Kutah, who is in executive charge of that place and of several adjoining villages, is subject, both in theory and in practice, to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Governor-General of Fars is represented by a Deputy-Governor at Burazjan, where also there is a Persian telegraph staff. The lot of the subjects of the Khan of Burazjan is not a happy one; they are rack-rented and are obliged to yield their master military service whenever he may require it, supplying their own arms and ammuni tion. The subjects of; the Salar-i-Muazzam and of the Shaikh of Chah Kutah are probably little better off, and of late years there has been a ^ood deal of emigration from the district. The nominal land revenue averages 50 to 60 Qrans per Gau; but the Khan of Burazjan, at least, endea vours to extort more. There is no sort of criminal justice, and civil justice is synonymous with the good offices of Mullas in arranging private disputes. Quarrels between villages are either adjusted by Saiyids or else fought out to the bitter end.DASHTISTAN 583 Topograpfiy.--* T Vh.Q following are the villages of tlie Dashtistan district: the present political position of those not subject to the Khan of Burazjan is indicated in the column of remarks :— Name.

DAW AIRl J A division of the A mar ah Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish 'Iraq.(g) t)AWASlR DISTRICT 389 Position and boundaries. —The DawairJj Qadha comprises a good part of the plains to the north-east of 'Amarah Town between that place and the Persian hills. Dawairij is understood to be bounded by the 'AmaraL. Qadha on the west and by the Persian frontier on the north and east: on the south it is adjoined by the Qadha of Zubair. i opoyTtiphy duel luJtdiltwfi ts. There are no fixed villages in Dawairij; Tafrah , the administrative headquarters, is merely a mud fort; it is reported to be situated about 30 miles to the east and gomewhat to the north of ; Amarah Town. The district is traversed by a brackish stream of the same name (Dawairij) which comes down from the Persian hills and contributes to form the marshes betweea Arnarah and Hawizeh. Dawairij is the headquarters of the Baui Lam tribe and their principal Shaikh has his residence in the district. Population.—'V'he. entire fixed population is estimated at 50,000 souls Who, with the exception of a few Sunni officials, are all Shf'ah Arabs. Resowces, The Dairat-as-Saniyah has acquired some of the best land in the district, and there are now flourishing date plantations at Tafrah which owe their existence to that department: the arable land under its management is generally leased to tribesmen of the neighbourhood for cultivation. Rice, maize and wheat are grown; camels, cattle and sheep are abundant j and there are some buffaloes. The excellent grazing in the neighbourhood has in the past been a cause of dispute not only between different sections of the Bani Lam, but also between the Turkish and Persian Governments. Administration.—Uhe class of the Da-wairij Qadha has not been ascertained and there are no Nahiyahs. The Qaim-Maqata and his staff generally manage to live at 'Amarah Town instead of at Tafrah, leaving the Bani Lam to their own devices. A district extending for a considerable distance along the right bank DAWASIR of the Shatt-al -'Arab between Saihan and Dorah • its upper extremity is about 16 miles by river below the mouth of the Karun, while its DISTRICT lower is 15 miles by river above the Fao telegraph station ; its own and length between the two is nearly 19 miles. In the whole district there ISLANDS are about 50 hamlets of 6 to 15 huts each, inhabited by various tribes;590 DAWASIR DISTRICT the people are somewhat nomadic in their habits and many old deserted huts are to be seen. One place, known as Kut-al-Khalifah iiiWl oy , j is inhabited by Muntafik. Palms are comparatively scarce and the crop poor, but native sailing boats call to collect inferior dates for exportation. The island of Ziyadiyah lies between the Shatt-al-'Arab and Dawasir in the uppermost 6 miles of its extent; and, where it terminates, a chain of low and narrow islands called Dawasir begins on the opposite or Persian side of the river and continues for about 6 miles. Exclusive of the part, apparently uninhabited, opposite Ziyadiyak island, Dawasir consists of the following tracts in order as the river is descended :— j Name. Extent upon the river. Inhabitants. E emabes . Dawaib 3 miles. About 1,250 souls of mixed tribes. Resources are estimat* ed at 10,000 palms, 100 cattle, 350 sheep and goats and 6 camels. Saniyah ajkiwJI 4 to 5 miles. About 450 souls of various tribes- There are about 3,000 date palms. Animals are 50 sheep and goats and 12 horses. This tract owes its name to the circum stance that it is the property of the Sul tan of Turkey and is managed by the Dairat-as-Saniyah. Faddi^hijah m ui Ditto. 1,000 souls of Muhaisin of tbe Bait Kana'an sec tion. The date palms of this tract are estimated at 5,000, and the live stock at 100 cattle, 150 sheep and goats ar^d 100 horses. A creek which forms the upper boundary of this tract, divid ing it from Sauiyah, is known as the Faddaghiyah creek and has at times been notorious as a resort of river pirates.DAWASIR TEIBB 391 ^ ^ lrom table it would appear that the total fixed population of Dawasir is about 2,700, and that date palms number some 18,000. m , 11 Singular Dosiri An important Arab tribe of Southern Najd, DAWASIR 1 'fi having settlements also on the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Butrilution, The districts par excellen of the Dawasir are those TRIBE of Widyan Dawasir and Aflaj in Central Arabia : the Bedouins as Well as the settled inhabitants of those regions are chiefly of this tribe. The numerous villages of the Salaiyil and Wadi Dawasir divisions of the —, Widyan Dawasir district belong entirely to the settled Dawasir, whose fellow tribesmen in Aflaj are owners of Bad!', Haddar, Hamar, Kharfah, Lailah, Marwan, Rajaijiyah, Raudhah, Shutbah, Wasit and Wusailah. rant The P 0 P ulatioils o f Hautah town and Hilwah in the Hautah district and , Ig of Hariq town in the Hariq district are partly Dawasir, and the tribe • is represented in Kharj both by settled villagers at Dilam, Sulaimlyah and Yamamah and by Bedouins who encamp in the district. In 'Aridh, itiatf Wliere n0madlC Dawasir are seen, fixed Dawasir occur at Bir, Dqalah, jJb k Ha61 ' Hannah, Malham, Safurrah and Thadiq in Mahmai j at'Ammarlyah, Dara'iyah, and Manfuhah on Wadi Hanifah j and at Dhrumah town teu and Mizahmiyah in the Dhrumah tract: in Sadair they are found at *Ub 'Audah, Ghat, Hasun, Jalajil, Ma'ashibah, Raudhah, Ruwaidhah, and ?£ Zilfi ' a,ld in Was ham at Marat. The settlements of the Dawasir scarcely •j| eStend furtller north than Sadair, and in Qasim their presence is reportsd at Hatan, Huwailan, Quwai'ah and Shamasiyah only. On the south-west their limit appears to be in the Wadi Sabai' district, where some exist at «{[ Hazam ' Khurmah, Kaudhah, Rumadan and Suwaiyid. S Iu Ba hrain tile Dawasir are the most numerous Sunni tribe after the {ji and are the sec ond of all the Bahrain tribes in poHtical import- .lili ance, being inferior in this respect to the 'Utflb only. The Dawasir of fj Bahrain are said to have immigrated from Najd, whence they gradually gj ^ e a®twards and, after spending several years by the way on Zakhnuniyah island, finally arrived in Bahrain about 1845 under the leadership of the grandfather of their present Shaikh. They have now er ^ about 800 houses at Budaiya' and 200 at Zallaq, both places on the west side of Bahrain Island. About SO households of the tribe are392 DAWASIR TRIBE settled at Dohah in Qatar and perhaps the same number in the towii of Kuwait. Offshoots from the Bahrain community of Dawasir exist in the Persian coast district of Dashtistan at Chah Kutah and its dependent villages and at the village of Jazireh in Bushehr harbour. Divisions.* —'The principal divisions of the Dawasir tribe are said to be:— 1. Braik (Al) JI 2. Hasan (Al) Jf 3. Makbarib 4. Rijban 5. Kiyayithat 6. Suhabah and 7. Wida'in Some of these call for further remark or for minuter classification. 1, The Al Braik are possibly not a main division of the Dawasir; according to one account they are included in a larg'er unit known as the Misa'irah to which sections called Al Abul Hasan cr ^ljj) Jl, Al Bu Sabba J? and a group of sections known as Musarir Jjt-* also belong. Al Braik are found at Nuwaimah, Al Abul Hasan at Q-uwaiz^ and Al Bu Sabba' at Nazwah ; all places in Widyan Dawasir. Mu^addi-bin-Iqwaid^ at present the chief Shaikh of the Bedouin Dawasir of Central Arabia^ himself belongs to the Misa irah. The Hanabijah of Bilad-al-Hanabijah in Wadi Dawasir are Misa'irah; so also are the Intaifat oUuijl a t Haddar in Aflaj, the Al Rishdan Jl at Ruwaisah in WadiDawasir 3 the Sharafah at Sabhah and Thamamiyah in Wadi Dawasir, the 'Uwaidhat at Thama- miyah in Wadi Dawasir and the'Uwaimirj^* at Huwaizah in Wadi Dawasir. Some of the Dawasir in Zilfi also are Misa'irah. ^2. The Al Hasan division consists of two subdivisions, the ''Aniniar and the Farjan ) which in turn are composed of the sections given in the table below. Numerically small sections are distinguished A list by Col. E. C. Ross of Dawasir sections will be found in the Persian Galf Administratioa Beport for 1879-80,L DAWASIR TRIBB 39^ Salaiyil ; the A1 Hamid jT at Bilad A1 Hamid in Wadi Dawasir, the Al Hanaish jl at Dahlah in Salaiyil^ the Hij ji at Tamnah in Salaiyil and at Lailah in Aflaj, the Al 'Isa Jf at Thadiq in 'Aridh, the Jibarin of Al Jabirj.J^ jf at Lailah in Aflaj, and in Bahrain, the Khadhran who own Shutbah in Aflaj but do not reside there, the Khamasin at Mishrif in Wadi Dawasir, the Midbal or Midabilah ^bl^in Dhrumah, the Al Muhammad at Bilad Al Muhammad in Salaiyil, the Al Nahish J) at Fara'ah in Wadi Dawasir, the Al Suwailim at Thadiq in 'Aridh and Muqabil in Salaiyil, the 'Umur at Kabkabiyah and Tamrah in Salaiyil, and the Walamin at Nafjan in Wadi Dawasir. The Walamin have two subsections known as Mana^ and Sa ad. - Character and life. —Little is known, in consequence of the remote ness of their country and its inaccessibility to European travellers, of the main body of the Dawasir j but they appear to be of consequence as a settled rather than as a nomad tribe. A pafty of Dawasir from the far interior, who supplied at Kuwait in 1905 most of the information about tribal divisions given above, wore a somewhat distinctive dress in which different shades of red and brown were blended, and they carried silver-mounted swords. Their kerchiefs and shawls were red, of European manufacture; their mantles were brown, some light, some dark in colour; their swords, they said, were from India, Baghdad and Makkah. In their Bahrain settlements none of the tribe are pastoral; there they are chiefly engaged in pearl diving, in pearl dealing and in the culture of dates. The Dawasir of Central Arabia profess to be followers of Ibn Hanbal, but in reality they are Wahhabis in the modern acceptation of the term; in Bahrain they are Maliki Sunnis; and in Dashtistan about one- fourth are still Sunnis, while the remainder have recently been converted to Shi'ism. Political position. —The district of Widyan Dawasir forms a princi pality which k almost purely Dosiri in population, is ruled by a Dosiri chief with his capital at Dam, and is but slightly attached to the Wahhabi state; Aflaj, on the other hand, though all but exclusively a Dosin district, appears to be an integral part of the dominions of Ibn Sa'ud. The political organisation of Widyan Dawasir is noticed more Wly m the article on that district. In the other districts of Najd where Dawasir occur they are not of political importance in a tribal sense. The Dawasir of Bahrain are a practically independent^96 DAWASIB TRIBE comnmnity j tliGy p ^y no revGim© to tliG Sliaikli of BfthrS/iii on siccoiiiit eithor o£ thGir poarl boats or tlioir dato gardens, and under the weak regimG of thG prosont ruler they would certainly resist any attempt by him at interference in their affairs. DAWASIE Tlie most inacces ^ ble an(i tlie ^ east known ^ except Wadi iSabai^ of (WIDYAN) o: ^ Najd.* General. —Widyan Dawasir is described as a hollow district or system of depressions, sandy and monotonous, filling a great part of the space enclosed between Jabal Tuwaiq on the north-east, the Rnba'-al-Khali on the south-east, and Wadi Sabai' on the west. Its general slope is downwards from west to east, and Salaiyil, the lowest lying and most easterly of its subdivisions, affords a common outlet towards the Dah^nah desert for the drainage of its component valleys except Hamam. w Salaiyil suhdistrict Salaiyil subdistrict is situated among confused outliers of Jabal Tuwaiq, thrown off at the point where that range ceases to run southwards ; it lies about 5 days' journey, perhaps 80 or 100 miles, south and somewhat to the west of the populous part of the Aflaj district-t The south side of Salaiyil is formed by a detached mass of hills which a chain of eminences, not too continuous to prevent the escape of the Widyan Dawasir drainage east wards, connects with the corner of Jabal Tuwaiq^ some 15 or 20 miles to the north. The part of the hills of Salaiyil immediately west of the village of Tamrah is called Jabal Tamrah, and one of its spurs, over which a track runs westwards into the subdistrict of Wadi Dawasir, is styled Fird-al-Jubah ^ . Salaiyil is not a large tract and it contains only about a dozen villages situated, with their palm groves, at intervals of a few miles apart upon hollows coming down from the southern hills. The villages and other chief points of interest are said to be as follows — * It does not appear that Widyan Dawasir bas as yet been visited by any European traveller and the whole of our information concerning it is derived from native sources. t It is possible that, as apparently stated by another authority who has been followed in the map issued with this Gazetteer, the distance between the villages of Aflaj and Salaiyil is very much less than 80 or 100 miled.DAWASIR (WIDYAN) S97 Name.

From this table the whole fixed population of Salaiyil would appear to be less than 5^000 souls. In Salaiyil the soil is sandy and the water-supply is exclusively from wells. Wheat, barley and dates, however, are grown and are irriga ted by means of lifts worked by camels and bullocks. The houses are nearly all of mud and stone.

Although Hamam is counted a part of Widyan Dawasir^ its drainage has an inde pendent outfall to the eastern desert ; it neither combines with that of Salaiyil and the rest of the district to the south-west nor runs north-east wards to the Maqran depression^ which is regarded as the boundary between Aflaj and Widyan Dawasir upon that side. Wddi Bawdsit suhdistrict. —The principal subdistrict of Widyan Dawasir is Wadi Dawasir which drains down into Salaiyil from the west; the position of its head is uncertain, but the valley is said to be about 100 miles in length. According to one account it is entered at some point in its course by the drainage of Wadi Sabai', the western most district of Southern Najd.

Wadi Dawasir has no water except in wells, but it is full of palm groves j dates, wheat and barley are the chief products. Other sub districts. —A tract called Lughaf said to contain 3 hamlets, also belongs to Widyan Dawasir. It lies to the west of Jabal Tuwaiq^ but like most of the districts it drains to Salaiyil, sending down along with its own drainage that of Fara'ah a place still further to the west. Fara'ah is described as a settlement with extensive cultivation of dates, wheat a^d barley ; the waterlifts there are worked by camels. Daham ^ is the name of a tribe and their district ; the latter is sometimes reckoned to Widyan Dawasir and lies, it would seem, to the south of Salaiyil, presumably in the desert. -P ovulation. —The Arab inhabitants, both nomadic and non-nomadic, of Widyan Dawasir belong almost entirely to the Dawasir tribe, from whom the district has received its name ; but it is said that about one- fourth of the population is composed of negro slaves (included in the above statistics in the tribe of their masters). The total fixed population of the whole district probably does not exceed 27,000 souls and must be considerably less if, as is probable, the numbers of houses in the villages 2 D 2404 DAWXSIU (WIDYAN) have been greatly exaggerated. Tlie people are described as hospitable, but they are all Wahhabis. Adjoining villages are frequently at feud and nearly all villages are walled. Agriculture and, There is apparently nothing distinctive in the agriculture or trade of the Widyan Dawasir district. The staples of cultivation, as will be apparent from the tables of villages above, are dates, wheat, barley, maize and lucerne ; and the fruits include figs, peaches, pomegranates, grapes and almonds. Camels are very numerous, and everywhere there are cattle and some donkeys ; a few horses are found in nearly all the villages, and in some the number is considerable, such information as has been obtained about the trade of Widyan Dawa^r will be found in the article upon the town of DaiU. 'Political organisation—The. Amir of Dam is paramount chief of Widyan Dawasir, as well as absolute ruler of his own town. He represents the district in its dealings with external powers and receives tribute from all the villages. He does not interfere in the domestic affairs of the villages, but he settles cases which are referred to him and mediates in disputes ; cases which involve points of law are referred by him to the Qadhi of Dam, an official who is altogether under his influence. The Amir has a treasury and maintains a staff of several secretaries or clerks. It is reported that the Amir and his subjects regard themselves as independent of outside control and that a Turkish army advancing on Dam from the direction of Yaman was once repulsed by the Dawasir with great slaughter ; two guns taken on that occasion can still, it is added, be seen at Dam. It is not denied that Zakat was formerly paid to the house of Ibn Sa'ud and, though discontinued during the supremacy of Ibn RashTd in Najd, its renewal shortly in favour of the restored Wahhabi ruler is regarded as probable ; but the Wahhabis have never, it is alleged, meddled in the internal affairs of Widyan Dawasir, nor would they ever be permitted to do so. The present Amir is one Masri-bin-Wuthailah; he is described as tall, broad -should ered and muscular, with a long beard, and is said to be extremely popular among his subjects. DHA'AIN A village on the eastern coast of Qatar about 20 miles noith of Dohah. It is closely connected with the village of Suinaismali,DHABI (ABU) PRINCIPALITY 405 whicli is distant from it only about 1 mile westwards. Dha'ain consists o£ about 150 bouses^ mostly of A1 Bu Kuwarah with some of Hamaidat and a few of Madhahakah.

Drinking water is from ^Awainat Bin-Husain ; 6 miles inland. An Arab principality^ the most extensive and one of the two most important in Trucial 'Oman. Boundaries and divisions, —Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from Khor-al-Ghanadhah_, which divides it from the Shaikhdom of Dibai, on the east to Khor-al- 'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the bay of Umm-al-Hul near Wakrah in Qatar^ but his claim was not approved by the Government of India : Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his state in this direction^ but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al- Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be ieckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined : it is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi Oasis ; but without taking it in; and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al- Khali. The principal divisions of Abu Dhabi upon the mainland in order from west to east are 'Aqal^ Mijan^ Sabakhat Matti^ Dhafrah (includ ing Bainunah, Liwah and other minor tracts)^ possibly Khatam^ and finally what may be called the home district in which the capital^ Abu Dhabi Town, is situated: these tracts, except the last, all form the subjects of separate articles. The insular possessions of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi are the islands of Arzanah, Daiyinah, Dalmah, Das, Qarnain, Saiali, Yas and ZirkO; and, these also being described elsewhere under their own names, it only remains to deal here with the geography of the home division. Physical characteristics and topograp division. —This part of the principality apparently consists altogether of undulating sandy desert with scanty grazing and a poor water-supply.

The Bedouins of the principality are the remainder of the Bani Yas and nearly the whole of the Manasir tribe, or together about 3,300 persons. It is probable that the nomads of the Dhawahir, Bani Qitab and Na'im sometimes cross the indefinite eastern border into the Abu Dhabi Shaikhdom, but they can hardly be reckoned to belong to it. Resources and trade. —There is no cultivation except a little of dates. Camels abound ; but cattle, sheep and goats are few ; and pearl diving is the principal occupation even of the Bedouins. In the whole of the Shaikhdom there are about 410 pearl boats, of which the majority are owned at Abu Dhabi Town and 50 at Batin, the remainder being kept in creeks along the coast, or on islands ; they are as a rule of small size and work on banks adjoining the coast or islands. There are about 10 sea going vessels at Abu Dhabi Town, of which 2 are Sambuks and the rest large jollyboats merely ; these run to Bahrain, Basrah, Lingeh and Masqat, but not to India.are ' souls, rai, W DHABI (ABU) PRINCIPALITY 40» There is no trade worthy of mention outside the town of Abu Dhabi, in the article on which the subject is treated of. The villages of MuzaiiVah and Taraq in Liwah are small local centres for the distribu tion of goods. Communications, —The routes in the principality are described in the article on Trucial 'Oman. m Administration, —The present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi* Zaid-bin-Khalifah, ^ rules his principality absolutely within the limits to which his powers of coercion extend; and, though his control over the Bedouin portion of 75 his subjects is incomplete, as is the case more or less in all Arab Shaikh- 500 doms, his authority over them is unusually great.

Foreign relations and interests.—The ruler of Abu Dhabi is one of the Trucial Shaikhs, whose position is described in the article on TrucialDHABI (ABU) PRlWCIPALITy 410 'Oman. The only foreign interests in the principality are British, and these are described in the article on Abu DllSibi Town. DHABI (ABU) TOWN The capital o£ the Abu Dhabi Principality in Trucial 'Oman and the only settlement of importance which that principality contains. Abn Dhabi Town is situated on the coast of Trucial ^man about 88 miles south-west of Sharjah Town : it extends for about miles along the low sandy coast and consists chiefly of mat huts with a few stone buildings. At sea, 15 miles to the northward, is Hadd, the nearest of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. The largest edifice is the fort of the Shaikh at a little distance inland behind the town ; not far from it ; on the outskirts of the town proper, is the separate bazaar of the Indian tradem The anchorage* for large vessels is totally unsheltered and lies more than two miles ofi the shore. At the back of the town are some stunted date trees and water is obtained from wells : 35 years ago most of the drink ing water of the place used to be fetched from Dibai, but recently potable water has become obtainable in the vicinity of the town, especially at a place 3 or 4 miles from it; pits are dug in which the water collects at 4 to 5 feet below the ground level. Immediately to the south of the town is the large shallow lagoon of Khor-al-Batln, and to the east a creek connected with it, both of which are described in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality. The population of the town may be about 6,000 souls, about | Bam Yas and the rest other tribes. The Bani Yas sections are Al Bu Falah ; 40 persons; Qubaisat^ 380; Maharibah, 300 ; Al Bu Ealasah, ^00; Qumzan, 250; Al Bu Hamir, 300 ; Rumaithat, 500; Mazari^ 300; and Hawamil, 500.

To these must be added a Persian community of about 500 persons and 65 Hindus. The inhabitants of Abu Dhabi live almost entirely by pearl diving and fishing or in a few cases by petty trade: they have no ordinary * A plan of this anchorage is given in Chart Ko. 2373—2837-A.DHASlR 411 cultivation and very few dates. Partionlars of shipping are given in the article on Abu Dhabi Principality. About 750 camels belong to the place^ and there are 85 horses; but of the horses all except 5 belong to the Shaikh and his family. Trade with the interior is insignificant, being only with the Baraimi Oasis and with the Bani Yas and Manasir tribes. There are over 70 shops of all sorts in the Abu Dhabi bazaar; 40 are kept by Persians, 19 by Hindus and 10 by Arabs. Pearls are the sole export. The Hindus import cloth, rice, coffee and sugar besides dealing in pearls. Biitish inteiests are represented iiere by the Hindu trading commu- nitjj all from Tatta in Sind; the majority have their families with them, and most of them take leave to India at intervals of abont a year. In the pearl season the number of Hindus is about doubled. No Muhammadan Indians do business at this place. An important Bedouin tribe whose territory extends from the right DHAFIR* bank of the Euphrates about Samawah and Siiq-ash-Shuyukh west- wards to the Birak or Darb Zubaidah, a section of the pilgrim route ^ between Najaf and Makkah, and south-eastwards to Kuwait. They are sometimes found in the Nafud as far west as the route between Jauf-al-'Amir and Hail and they maintain occasional relations with the latter place. Their neighbours on the north-west are the 'Anizah ; on te west the Shammar of Jabal Shammar, with whom they are at eud J on the south the Mutair and 'Ajman ; and on the east the muntafik. They are said to visit pkces on the Euphrates occasionally or the purpose ofobtaining supplies, but to a great extent their dealings With Turkish 'Iraq are carried on indirectly through other tribes. The principal sections of the Dhafir who live in the direction of Kuwait are the Batun ^ Samid ^and Ma'alib : with them are found a small section, called Kathir, of the 'once celebrated Bani Khalid tribe.

Boundaries. —Dhafrah lies between the Persian Gulf on the north and the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert of Southern Arabia on the south ; on the west it is bounded by Sabakhat Matti and Jafurah, and on the east by Khatam. Divisions. —The huge area thus defined comprises at least 5 separate tracts which are distinguished by names, but the absence^of striking natural features makes it difficult to determine their relative positions and extent. Indeed there is reason to think that the internal boundaries of Dhafrah are somewhat vague, and that the names of the tracts are not employed by all Bedouins in strictly the same sense. The 5 tracts in question are Taff Dhafrah proper 3 Bainunah Qufa US and Liwah ^} } of which last name the correct form is said to be Al-J uwa j of these Liwah and Bainunah are the most important. All authorities agree that Liwah is the southernmost and furthest inland of the divisions of Dhafrah; that its length, which is eastwards and westwards, approaches, if it does not exceed, 175 miles ] that its breadth is insignificant in comparison with its length ; and that the village of Shah is situated in it almost exactly midwMy between its two extremities. To determine the position of Liwah it is therefore only necessary to determine the position of Shah, but here we are confronted by serious discrepancies of evidence; the most probable view, however, appears to * Authorities. —-Major P.

Charts of the coast are specified in the footnote to article Trucial 'Oman, especia y cancelled Chart No. 19-B.DHAFRAH 418 be that Shah is situated 50 to 55 miles inland from the coast upon a line drawn due south from Ras Miqaishit, the western point of the Salali group of islands, and that it is about 90 miles south-west by south of Abu Dhabi Town. If this opinion errs, it is probably by bringing Shah somewhat too near to the coast and too far to westwards. The position of Bainunah depends upon that of a well Da^afas, which undoubtedly belongs to this tract, though its position in the same is not, perhaps, so central as that of Shah in Liwah. According to the report which for several reasons appears most reliable, Da'afas is about 30 miles south-east of Jabal Dhannah (on the coast opposite Yas island) and about 20 miles inland from the nearest point on the sea. The alter native position attributed to Da'afas is very much more southerly and more easterly than that just described. It is not disputed that Bainunah is between Liwah and the sea, nor that it reaches to the westernmost extremity of Dhafrah, in other words to the border of Sabakhat Matti. Of the remaining tracts Qufa is undoubtedly interposed between Liwah and Bainunah and is long from east to west and narrow from north to south. Taff is, by general consent, a maritime strip extending the whole length of Dhafrah with an average depth inland of about 15 miles. Its westernmost section, that reaching for about 25 miles on either side of Jabal Dhannah, is possibly particularised as Taff Bainunah. The last tract requiring to be located is Dhafrah proper, and the name may be taken to signify so much of Dhafrah in the wider sense as is not included m any of the foregoing divisions. The position of Dhafrah proper with reference to Bainunah is doubtful ; but it is probably on the east while Bainunah is on the west and the distances of the two from the sea are similar. ^ The wells of Kafaifah, it may be added, seem to be near the point at which the tracts of Bainunah and Dhafrah proper meet one another and the tract of Taff. Following then the opinion which seems most worthy of acceptance we may provisionally arrange the divisions of Dhafrah as follows .— 1. Along the coast a strip 15 miles wide, which for nearly 100 miles on the east is called Taff, and for 50 miles on the west Tafd Bainunah. 2. Behind the coastal strip a belt 40 miles wide composed of Dhafrah proper, Bainunah and Qufa : of these Dhafrah proper (30 miles broad) adjoins Taff throughout its length, and Bainunah (20 miles broad) adjoins Taff Bainunah,' also414 DHAF&amp;AH throughout its length, while Qufa fills the space remaining' on the south of these two* 3. Inland of Qufa, and like Qufa roughly parallel to the sea, another belt measuring about 175 miles in length and perhaps 20 miles in breadth: this belt is Lawah. Physical characteristics,—^ maritime tracts of Taff and TafE Bainunah contain no features of interest except a few small hills, which are possibly volcanic. The shore is stony, and at a little distance inland swamps are said to exist, interspersed with stony mounds. Vegetation is chiefly Abal and Hams. Dhafrah proper and Bainunah are said to resemble one another in character : they form, apparently, a fairly level expanse of heavy red sand or reddish soil with occasional sand dunes of lighter colour and gravelly patches. Dhafrah proper, at least, is somewhat higher in level than Tail Neither tract possesses any trees; but in Dhafrah proper there is some vegetation of Arta and Hadh, and in Bainunah the Arta, Markh and Abal are found: both districts afford a considerable amount of grazing for camels. The wells of Dhafrah proper seem to vary in depth between 1 and 2 fathoms and those of Bainunah between 1J and 7 fathoms, the average in the case of the latter tract being 3 fathoms. Qufa is an inhospitable region of sandy ridges with no vegetation except a few shrubs of Arta and very little water ; but the few wells that occur are shallow, not exceeding 2 fathoms. Liwah is the most remarkable of all the tracts. It consists mainly of white undulating sand dunes, altogether without vegetation; but it contains over a score of small depressions, disposed in series or chains from east to west. These depressions are divided from one another by sandy wastes ; but at the bottom of each depression there is fertile soil, supporting the cultivation of a village which generally stands upon a sandy eminence near by. These low-lying oases contain plantations of date palms, which in a few cases are of considerable extent. The water level in Liwah, doubtless in the depressions, appears to be on the average at 2 fathoms beneath the surface ; and except at Tharwaniyah a depth of 4 j fathoms is not, it would seem, ever exceeded. Throughout Dhafrah, to speak generally, the water of the wells is of fairly good quality, and not very scarce. The wells themselves are either unlined or lined only with date sticks and leaves ; the only exceptions to the rule appear to be the Babah well in Bainunah, which is reported to be half lined with masonry, and a well called Saqar , also in Bainunah hut not precisely located., which is said to be entirely so lined. ThisDHAFRAH 415 peculiarity is no doubt due largely to the shallowness of the wells, but it also seems to indicate firmness in the soil. Inhabitants. —In the whole of Dhafrah only two tribes are found, the Bani Yas and the Manasir ; the former are settled rather than nomadic, while the latter are altogether Bedouins. Of Llwah they are jointly occupants, but the permanent villages, called Mahdhar all belong to the Bani Yas, the settlements of the Manasir being untenanted except in summer while the date harvest is in progress. Among the Manasir date plantations are joint tribal property, but with the Bani Yas they belong to individual owners. The Bani Yas of Dhafrah are semi- civilised; some of them trade with Abu DhaM and even Dibai and correspond with those places. The dwellings of both tribes are huts of date sticks and leaves: the Manasir, when their sojourn inLiwah is over for the year, close theirs up and stop the adjacent wells, it is said, with sand. Dhafrah proper is the principal grazing ground of the Manasir while Bainunah contains the favourite pastures of the Bani Yas ; but in winter the Manasir range as far west as Qatar and in summer their camels are left with those of the Bani Yas in Bainunah. The Bani Yas of Dhafrah take a share in the pearl fishery and own a number of boats which are kept at Bandar Eadaim, Khor Mughairah and Bandar Mivfah upon the coast. The number of the Bani Yas ordinarily in Dhafrah may be reckoned at 5,100 souls, while that of the Manasir is the entire strength of the tribe or 1,400 persons ; and besides these there are about 70 Bedouin families of the Marar tribe who are accustomed to wander in Liwah. The whole population of Dhafrah may therefore be estimated at 6,500 souls, but it is fluctuating.

'Political 'position^ —Dhafrah, as already remarked, is apart of Trucial 'Oman, and the whole of it falls within the political sphere of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to whose principality it may accordingly be consi dered to belong. The Bani Yas of Liwah count themselves subjects of the Shaikh, but the extent to which the Manasir are amenable to his in fluence is doubtful. Dhafrah has been at times the scene of prolonged contests between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the principal Shaikh of Qatar, the latter making raids into the Liwah tract, and the former retaliating by means of expeditions against Qatar, in the course of which he has been known to utilise Shwaihat upon the coast as an advanced base for his operations. Limits and extent, —A large district of the 'Oman Sultanate lying between the Western Hajar on the north-east and the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert on the south-west: it is divided from 'Oman Proper by Jabal-al-Kor at its south-eastern end and meets the district of Jau at its north-western extremity. Dhahirah thus forms an elongated parallelogram about 100 miles in length from north-west to south-east and about 50 in breadth from north-east to south-west. Physical characteristics.— consists of a plain of uneven surface sloping down from the hills of Hajar to the Euba'-al-Khali, in which the whole of its drainage is lost. It has two principal valleys^ ^'adi Dhank, which comes down from Hajar to the town of Dhank and * For the signification of the name see footnote under Batinah. For authorities and maps see article 'Oman Sultanate (first footnote). DHAHI- RAIP yfclls428 dh A hirah tiience runs to tlie Rnba'-al-Khali preserving throughout its course a general direction from east to west, and Wadi-al -Kabir which, descending from Hajar west-south-westwards towards 'Ibri, becomes in the neigh bourhood of that town Wadi Sanaisal and receives from the east Wadi Sharsah and Wadi-al -'Ain, the former joining it a little above, and the latter a little below 'Ibri. The hills Which diversify the surface of Bhahirah are outliers of Hajar ; chief among them are detached or semi detached eminences around 'Ibri which attain an elevation of 300 or 400 feet above the plain, an isolated group of low hills called Jabal Falaij Which lies some 26 miles to the north-west of 'Ibri, and some scattered hillocks between 'Ibri and Jabal Falaij on the side, towards the Great Desert. The north-western slopes of Jabal-al-Kor may be regarded as ib pertaining to Dhahirah along with a ridge called Jabal Haddah which runs west-north-west from the southern extremity of Jabal-al-Kor and forms an acute angle with it. The elevation of the district varies from 1,200 feet above sea-level at Ibri to 2,750 feet at Miskin. To the west of Dhank Town the plain is generally stony or shingly with a sparse growth of mimosa and acack that affords winter grazing for thousands of Bedouin goats. South of Dhank Town a more sandy and less stony region begins. The south-east corner of the district between Jabal-al-Kor and Jabal Haddah is a plain sprinkled with mimosa and debris from the hills. Scrub jungles cover the open plains through which Dhahirah merges along its entire length into the Ruba^al-Khali. Everywhere water is derived frdm springs; £particulars of the settled inhabitants of Dhahirah will be found in the articles on the Wadis mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in those on the towns which they contain^ and in the table of villages given at the end of this article. In this place it is sufficient to recall that Ibri is mainly a town of the Ya^aqib and Dhank of the Nairn, while considerable settlements of Bani &gt;A% Bani Zid and Bidah occur in Wadi Dhank; Bani Kalban are found in 'Wadi Dhank and Wadi-al -Kabir; 'Abriyin in Wadi Sanaisal; Bani Hina, Manadharah and Sawawifah in Wadi-al ^Ain; and Maqabil in Wadi Sharsah. Towards the north-western end of the district there are Communities of Bani Qitab, and Baluchis and other tribes are represented in various places m numbers not entitling them to special mention here. Regard ing the nomadic inhabitants of Dhahirah less is knowli; but they seem to be chiefly Nalui and ; Awamir in the north-west and Daru^ in theDHAHIRAH 429 south: there are also Bani Zafait. The Bedouin element is in Dhahirah highly important^ but its numerical strength is not ascertainable. The following is an estimate of the settled population of Dhahirah Wadi-al-'Ain Wadi Dhank Wadi-al-Kabir with its tributary Wadi Bilad Shahum • , 8,000 Wadi Sanaisal *••••••#, 6,400 Wadi Sharsah 2^00 Remainder of the district (see the table at the end of this article) 6,000 Total 31,100 souls Agriculture, industries and trade.—-Th products of Dhahirah include all the typical products, of the 'Oman Sultanate, and the wheat is reputed better than that of the other districts. The soil, where cultivable, is described as a rather heavy clay mixed with stones. 'Ibri is the centre of the richest cultivation; in its vicinity are produced wheat, millet, mdigo, sugar and lucerne, besides dates, mangoes, limes and other fruits. The chief industry is indigo-dyeing. Wheat and fruits are exported to the Sharqiyah and Sohar districts. Admimsteation.—Uhe hold of the Sultan of 'Oman on the Dhahirah district is slight; but he maintains a Wali, supported by a garrison of 20 men, at 'Araqi in Wadi Sanaisal. Topography.—The following is an alphabetical list of the principal places in Dhahirah exclusive of those, among which are the most important, that are described elsewhere in the articles on Wadis Kabir Sanaisal, Sharsah, 'Ain and Dhank Name.

Bahrain Island lies off the coast of Barr-adh-Dhahran at 15 to | ^j| 35 miles distance. Boundaries,—\]^on the coast Barr-al-Dhahran extends from Dammam on the north—that is from the southernmost outpost of the Qatif Oasis —to the entrance of Dohat Ruhum on the south; its length is thus rather less than 30 miles. Its depth inland is indeterminate, but does not exceed a few miles. Vhydcd features, —The only striking accident of surface in Barr-adh- Dhahran is Jabal-adh-Dhahran^ from which, it is said^ the name of the entire tract is derived. This is a range running parallel to the shore between Dammam and QaFat-al-Husain, which are 12 miles apart^ at a distance of only 2 or 3 miles from the sea. The principal summit, flat- topped and 500 feet high, is situated 5 miles inland from the coast and 17 miles approximately south-south-east of Qatif Town. About 3 miles nearer to Qatif Town and 6 miles south of Dammam is a conical peak, belonging to the same range, which is 446 feet in height and bears the name of Jabal Mudrah On the south side of Jabal-adh-Dhahran is an area called Madarah containing many wells. The land on the eastern side of Jabal Dhahran, which slopes down to the sea, is actually higher upon the average than that on the western side. Barr- adh-Dhahran contains numerous small clumps of date trees scattered about in all directions.

In the cold weather the Dhahuriyin of E-UUS-al-JibSl live by fishing; in spring they migrate bodily, leaving only caretakers behind. to Khor Fakkan, Dibah and Khasabj, where they attach themselves to ace ij some of the permanent residents and bivouac in the date plantations, the ieadij tm i - • - row lii The Dhahuriyin are practically a part of the Slliliull tribe, by whom ^ e 7 are surrounded and with whom they are closely identified, but they ates ^ claim connection with the Dhawahir of Baraimi; the Dhawahir, ^ however, it must be observed, are Mawalik and Hinawiyah, while the Dhahuriyin are mostly Hanabilah and Ghafiriyah, a circumstance which renders somewhat doubtful the validity of the claim. The Dhahdriym do not admit that they are in any way subordinate to the Shihtlh : they appear, except those of Maqaqah, Qanah, Sham and Sibi, who have perhaps closer relations with the Bani Hadiyah^ to be connected with the Bani Shatair section of that tribe. The Dhahuriyin of Film and Mansal are Shafi^is in religion; the rest of the tribe are Hanbalis. An isolated village in the heart of the great'Oman Promontory ; it DilAlD*' belongs to the principality of Sharjah and geographically and politically ^ i s a centre of some importance in Trucial 'Oman. Position, surroundings and climate. —Dhaid is about 30 miles east of Sharjah Town and 33 miles south by west of the town of Ras-al- Khaimah. It stands near the western side of a level plain, which is about 15 miles wide from west to east and the same in length from north to south; this plain is bordered on the west and north by sand dunes, on the east by the hills which form the backbone of the 'Oman Promontory, Authority :—Major P.

DHAID and on the south by the shingly plateau of Qallah Mahafidh. The main features of the Dhaid plain and some other localities adjoining it are described in the last paragraph of the present article. The plain of Dhaid is well wooded, containing many acacias, and after rain it produces in abundance a coarse tussocky kind of grass. In the summer months a dry hot wind blows constantly at Dhaid, detracting from the amenity of the place which otherwise would be considerable. Village and inhabitants. —The village of Dhaid consists of about 140 houses, nearly all date-leaf huts; of these about 70 belong to the Tanaij tribe, 40 to the Bani Qitab, and 30 to Na'im of the Khawatir section. The Tanaij and Na'im communities have each a fortified mud tower for the defence of their separate quarters; and on the east side of the village is a four-towered fort belonging to the Shaikh of Sharjah. Dhaid is the headquarters of the nomad portion of the Tanaij, but the Bedouins who frequent the plain surrounding it are chiefly, perhaps, Bani Qitab, Agricultural {resources. —The date groves of Dhaid form an oasis about 1 mile in diameter. They are irrigated by a fine Falaj which comes from Wadi Haqalah to the south-east and passes through the precincts of the Shaikh of Sharjalr's fort on its way to the oasis ; the stream before it is tapped for irrigation is about three feet wide and two feet deep, clear and transparent, and has a strong flow. The waters of the Falaj are carefully divided up among the lands of the oasis, and the local representative of the Shaikh of Sharjah is responsible for their correct distribution. In addition to dates a little wheat is grown at Dhaid, and the inhabitants have the usual complement of domestic animals. Administration. —The settlement is governed and kept in order by a Wali who is directly under the orders of the Shaikh of Sharjah. This official is, at the present time, a venerable old negro retainer of the Sharjah family, who resides in his master's fort and flies the flag of Trucial Oman upon its north-western tower. The annual revenue derived by the Shaikh of Sharjah from Dhaid is said to consist of 100 Jirabs of dates, paid as a royalty, and of in cash recovered as a water rate from users of the Falaj. The position of the Shaikh's fort is such as to dominate the Falaj; but it is questionable whether the possessors of the fort could seriously interfere with the flow or affect the course of so strong a stream.DHAID 485 Folitical and military position. —Although Dhaid is controlled by the Shaikh of Sharjah. he has not an exclusive interest in the place. His uncle Salim-bin-Sultan and the Shaikhs of 'Ajmail and Hamriyah all own date plantations at Dhaid, and the unpleasantness of the climate in the hot weather months is given as the only reason why they do not visit the place frequently. There is reason to think that ; in event of British or Indian troops being required in Trucial 'Oman, Dhaid would be the most suitable station for them in the interior^ at least during the cold weather. The water supply is excellent and ample; camel and other grazing is abundant; and the place is probably already accessible for wheeled transport from Ras-al -Khaimah Town by way of the Sir and Jiri plains, besides which there are camel routes through the hills connecting it with the ports of the Shamailiyah District on the other side of the 3 Oman promontory. The subject of communications with Dhaid is more fully discussed in the paragraph on routes in Trucial 'Oman.

The people are all pearl g j^jj) divers, following no other occupation except fishing and owning no flocks or herds. Fifteen pearl boats and two other sea-going boats of the Mashuwah type and 5 fishing boats are owned at Dhakhirah. Trans port animals are 10 camels. Drinking water is from Lubwairdah, 2 miles to the north-west. A village on the north-west coast of the Qatar Promontory, near DHALUI 1 its tip and 1 or 2 miles south-west of Ruwais. It is difficult of (ABO) approach from seaward being fronted by a reef 2^ miles broad which ji) is nearly dry at low water. The inhabitants are about 70 families of the Manana^ah tribe owning 20 pearl boats, 5 other sea-going vessels and 10 fishing boats. Their drinking water is from the well of Umm Dha/an, about 1| miles inland. Camels here number 30. Frequently pronounced Dhanch; the second largest town in the Dhahirah district of the 'Oman Sultanate, pleasantly situated at the mouth of a precipitous opening in the Western Hajar range which forms the exit of Wadi Dhank. Jabal Hafit is visible from Dhank ok a clear day. Dhank is divided into an ^Alayah or upper town of about 5, and a Sifalah or lower town of about 7 quarters, each quarter heing separately walled. The houses are mostly of sun-dried brick. Fine date plantations containing about 3,500 palms and orchards of limes and pomegranates surround the town, and on the outskirts is some cultivation of wheat, lucerne and indigo. H ater for irrigation is raised DHANK TOWN438 DHANK TOWN from wells by bullocks. Livestock comprises 14 horses, 80 camels 250 donkeys, &lt;350 cattle and 1,100 sheep and goats. The population of Dbank is about 5,500 souls, belonging to various sections of the Na'im and some other tribes : in the ''Alayah, which consists of 400 houses, the people are all Na'im; in the Sifalah, containing 300 houses, they are Na'im of the 'Ayal 'Aziz, 'Ayal Hiyah, Shawamis and Wahaishah sections and Shakur. DHANK Or Wadi Dhanch; also called Wadi Fida . One of the two (WADI) c^ief va ileys in the district of Dhahirah in the Sultanate of 'Oman; it begins in Western Hajar near Najd-al-Wuqbah, on the opposite side of which pass Wadi-al -^Ahin, going to Batinah, has its rise. From its head to about Yanqul the direction of Wadi Dhank is apparently from north to south, but below Yanqul it runs almost due westward; its final exit from the hills of Western Hajar is by a precipitous gorge Just above the town of Dhank. On the upper side of the gorge the Valley is half a mile broad^ with banks 100 feet high and a fine stream of water in the middle, flowing above ground ; at this spot was fought the battle of Dhank in 1870 between Saiyid 'Azzan and Saiyid Turki, of which the ultimate result was the ruin of 'AzzSn's cause and the accession of Turki to the Sultanate.

Dhank Town •ft•tt • • • • • t See article Dhank Town. A mile or two below Dhank Town, Wadi Dhank is joined on its right bank by Wadi Abu Kurbab j], which has a sandy bed and banks thickly clad with tamarisk. It also receives from the east* at some point below Dhank Town, a Wadi called Wadi-al-Jailah ^ , in the tipper course of which is situated a village Khadal composed of 100 houses of Jarawinah (Bani Kalban). Wadi Dhank then continues on its way towards the Ruba'-al-Khali in which it is lost. The total population of Wadi Dhank and its affluents is about 7,300 SOlllSi A considerable Arab tribe who have their headquarters in the T VffA WA- Baraimi Oasis and inhabit its neighbourhood; practically the whole HIE Baraimi Oasis except the villages of Su'arah and Baraimi belongs to them. They number perhaps 4,500 souls and are divided into 3 sections, the Daramikah who inhabit Hili, Ma'ataradh and Qatarah; the Jawabir who are confined to 'Aiu; and the Bani Sa'ad who own jimi. In politics the Dhawahir are Hinawlyah ; in religion Muwalik. In summer all of them inhabit villages; in winter the entire community become Bedouins. They own large flocks of sheep and many camels ; they are charcoal-burners and carry their charcoal for sale to the coast of Trucial 'Oman, and elsewhere, on their own camels. The Dhawahir have probably little cultivation elsewhere than in Baraimi, Unless, as some assert, the Bani Sa'ad of Ghunah and Mad-hah in^40 DHAWAHIR Siiamailiyah belong to this tribe. Politically tlie Dhawaliir of Baraimi are subservient to the Shaikh of Abn Dhabi; to whom they even pay tribute; and it is not nnlikely that^ if they were to avail them selves of their numerical superiority and of his assistance, they might be able to possess themselves of the whole oasis. A lafge village in the ^Aridh district of Najd ; memorable chiefly for the resistance which it offered to the Egyptian forces in 1818 and for the severity with which it was treated after being taken by them. Dhrumah appears to be situated about 35 miles to the south-east of Barrah and about the same distance to the west-south-west of Riyadh, It stands in a plain of some extent which receives the drainage of three valleys from the western slopes of Jabal Tuwaiq ; of these the northern most begins in J abal Kharshah, a portion of the Tuwaiq range adjoin ing Haisiyah ; the middle one is Bodhah and the southernmost is Saqtah . To, the south-east and north-east of Dhrumah are the Tuwaiq hills, to the south-west is a sandy desert, and to the north west is a plain across which lies the route to Shaqrah in Washam. The hollow in the Dhrumah plain down which passes the combined drainage of the valleys from Jabal Tuwaiq leaves the village of Dhrumah on its right bank; but the date groves of the village are watered from wells in its bed ; from Dhrumah it trends east-south-eastwards, traverses Jabal Tuwaiq, and enters Wadi Hanifah a short way below Hair but near enough to that place to irrigate a portion of its date gardens. Between Dhrumah and Hair, at several miles from Dhrumah, a village called Mizahmiyah is passed upon the right bank; and several miles further on another village, named Rodhah, also on the right bank^ ; the lands of both these places are partly watered from the hollow; which as it approaches Hair receives the name of Sail Hair . Before reaching Hair it is joined—apparently from the left—by another holloW; called Maghrifiyah 3 from Jabal Tuwaiq. The route from Dhrumah to Riyadh lies by Mizahmiyah and thence over the high portion of Jabal Tuwaiq known as Abaljid ; the whole journey occupies about 1^ hours; and the latter three-fourths of the way are hilly and diffi cult. The way direct from Dhrumah to Hair lies over a * Another authority transposes th 9 positions of these villages, and yet another reduces the distances and makes them suburbs of Dhrumah.DHRUMAH 441 more southern and less,elevated part of Jabal Tuwaiq called Maghrifiyah, and the journey is apparently a longer one than that to Riyadh. These are the routes used by travellers moving lightly or in fear of robbers ; but a strong caravan with laden camels would, it is said, go by Hair, follow ing the natural valley which leads from Dhrumah to that place.

Millet, lu cerne, melons and the ordinary fruits are also grown. The wells are 11 to 18 fathoms in depth. Livestock are numerous. The Amir or headman of the village is at present Muhammad-bin-'Ahdul * Aziz of the Nawasir section of the Bani Tamim. There are 6,000 date palms, a few fruit trees and the usual cereals and lucerne* The water level is the same as at Dhrnmah, or not quite so deep. Resembles Mizahmijah, except that date palms are estimated at 4,000 and that water is at 10 fathoms. This seems the most convenient place in which to refer to the torrent bed of Abaljilat olL^), which, though not directly connected with Dhrumah, adjoins it on the southward, being situated (apparently) in the hills of Jabal Tuwaiq between Dhrumah and the Hariq district. It is said to rise in the same neighbourhood as the Nisah tributary of Wadi442 DHRUMAH Hanifah ; but its direction must be different, for, after passing a village called Jau-as-Saibani it runs southwards to Kliaslini-adh- Dhib in the Hariq district, where it ends. Only in times of exceptional flood does its water reach to Khashm-adh-Dhib. The village of Jau-as-Saibani is a poor and scattered one ; it ordinarily consists of 40 houses of slaves only. Bani Tamim, however, from Dhrumah and Mizahmiyah, come here to cultivate in the cold weather. There are no date trees and no lucerne, but wheat, barley, millet and melons are grown. Water is at 4 fathoms from the ground level The term Dhufar is properly used to describe the maritime plain oh the south coast of Arabia which extends &gt; enclosed between the Samhan hills and the sea, from Ras Risut eastwards for 30 miles to Khor Eori. It is also used in a restricted sense to designate the villages of Hafah and Salalah; which together contain two-thirds of the entire settled popu lation of the same plain. In a wider sense, however, as the name of a district, Dhufar denotes the whole coastal tract, from and including the village of Eharifot on the west to Has Nus on the east^ which is in the possession of the Sultan of ^Oman and forms a separate district of the 'Oman Sultanate. It is in the last of these three meanings that the word is employed in the present article; Dhufar Proper is dealt with separately under that title. The eastern and western limits of the Dhnfar district as just defined approximately coincide with those of the Qar&lt;t tribe. -The district of Bhufar, as defined above, has a length west by south and east by north of 134 miles and a maximum breadth inland, in Dhufar Proper, of about 20 miles. Physical geography. —The greater part of the district does not meht &amp; detailed description ; it consists of barren hills at no great distance from the sea, interrupted here and there by short insignificant valleys. The Only valley of importance is Wadi Raikut which reaches the coast at Hasik and is ^aid to have its head in the far interior. The hills, though in places irregular in direction and discontinuous, really form one range * Fot Dhufar district, see map in Mfs.

For authorities on the district see article 'Oman Sultanate (first footnote). dhufar ^ QJ* district.DHUFAR DISTRICT 443 which is generally known by the name of Jabal Samhan. In two places ^ does the lange recede perceptibly from the coast; one of these is between Has Nus and Murbat, where a belt of low land 6 to 12 miles broad, rocky and desolate in the extreme, but containing some hares and ' gazelles besides a few date trees in a ravine towards Ras Nus, is left between the hills and the sea; the other is the plain of Dhufar Proper, mil 1 ^ ie ex ^ reme P 0 ^ s upon the coast have been already mentioned. WJ ( Climate. Situated as Dhufar is on the shore of the Arabian Sea, its seasons are regulated chiefly by the monsoons. The south-west monsoon, which brings rain, ordinarily arrives about the 11th of June and is sometimes preceded by 10 days by a severe gale from the south or south- (jiii! east - In December and January the air of Dhufar is pleasant and icStil salubrious. InhabitanU.—l^ two great tribes of the district are the Qaras, who % are found elliefl y in the Samhan hills, and the A1 Kathir, who inhabit m the plain of Dhufar Proper and the hills also. The Qaras have a ^ language of their own and the A1 Kathir are believed to speak an Arabic iijl dialect which differs considerably from that of the Persian Gulf. The at H villagers are indolent agriculturists and like most town Arabs are timorous it in. an ) d much addicted to tobacco. Other tribes known in Dhufar are the Uii Jaafar and the Bait-al-Qalam ^ of the former of whom there are llei 20 ' and 0 f the latter a few households at Murbat ; Saiyids or Sadat oI^U, ii(|l a ° d Mashaikh, both sacred classes, mostly settled at Murbat and Taqa • the Hasarit or Hasrit a Bedouin tribe who visit Murbat, but ordinarily inhabit a country said to lie three or four days' lojlf journey to the east of Dhufar; and the Harasis , a tribe of which jtliK stray members are seen now and again in Dhufar, having come, it is believed, from a long distance. A few Mahras and Hikman are found at Murbat in Dhufar, and the district is adjoined on the west by Mahra 0 territory. Formerly there were a few Indian traders in Dhufar, now 0 there are none. Itp.' The blood-feud flourishes in Dhufar and is at times so prevalent k# tW0 habitants can hardly pass one another without a Rabi' ^ jit or guarantor.

Settled inhabitants of the remainder of the district . Qara Bedouins Al Kathir Bedouins Other Bedouins (Hasarit, etc.) ..... T otal Communications and transport, —Communication between Dhufar and the outside world is hampered by various obstacles. The coast possesses no large harbour and landing is generally difficult on account of surf, though the bays of Murbat and Risut afford good anchorage for small vessels in the north-east and south-west monsoons respectively. Practi cally no sea-going boats are owned in Dhufar, but there are about 40 Horis and 10 Shashahs. The plain of Dhufar could be crossed with field guns, but the track along the coast which connects the plain with the Murbat anchorage would be difficult for artillery. The paths in the Samhan hills become altogether impassable in the rainy season. The Al Kathir and Qara tribes possess many camels : other transport animals are scarce. A land route connects Salalah in Dhufar with Adam in 'Oman Proper, but it is an arduous one and the journey occupies about a month; water in some parts is met with only at intervals of two marches. This route leaves Dhufar by Wadi Jarziz, traverses the district called Qatan behind Jabal Samhan, approaches the sea at Jazir and then bears direct for Adam, passing on the way through a locality called Dhalir ft* . There is no direct route between Dhufar and Central Arabia. Trade, shipping and resources, —There are no manufactures; By far the most valuable export is frankincense from the Samhan hills, which is mostly carried to Bombay in native boats. Other exports are hides, sheep skins, gums, bees' wax, bitter aloes, and at times ghi; these also are for the most part hill products. Imports are chiefly rice, sugar, jowari, dates and dyed cloth from Bombay; but small quantities of goods are brouglit also from Aden and Makalla K*, particularly tobacco from Makalla; and in summer a few traders in piece-goods visit Dhufar from Shilar returning to their homes in the cold weather. 3,000 1,500 4,250 2,000 250 . 11,000DHUFAR DISTRICT 445 One sea-going boat was formerly owned in Dhnfar; it was a Badan which made voyages between Murbat and Makalla, but it has now disappeared. Boats from Makalla, Stir, Bahrain and Kuwait frequently call at Dhufar to trade or to obtain provisions^ and business with Bombay is carried on chiefly by means of boats belonging to Stir. Dhufar merchants used occasionally to charter Indian Kutiyahs from Sind^ but this is no longer done and trade is said to be falling oif. Boats from the Persian Gulf generally visit or pass Dhufar in Novem ber and December; some return before the monsoon, but others better equipped linger till the Tadbirah or premonitory symptoms of the monsoon in June, or even till the first blast of the monsoon itself. These boats carry dates on their outward, and coffee on their return voyage. The smaller craft of the coast about Masirah fish in fleets along the shore towards Dhufar in winter and return home with the current in March or April. The inhabitants of Dhufar believe themselves independent of foreign- trade, and think that they could subsist by their own cultivation and flocks and heids if intercourse with the outer world were to be interrupted^ this is possibly true in regard to food, but a blockade would certainly reduce them to great straits for clothing. The products of the Dhufar district are described in the articles on Dhufar Proper and J abal Samhan. No minerals of commercial value are certainly known to exist, but an easily worked not very durable building stone is quarried near Salalah. Administration.—This remote district of the 'Oman Sultanate is ruled by a Wali who is appointed from 'Oman by the Sultan. The late Wali, Sulaiman-bin-Suwailim, had been almost continuously absent from Dhufar for 9 years before his death in 1907, and his duties were carried on by a resident deputy-governor. The revenue derived from sea-customs ( amounts to $5,000 a year, or more, and there are taxes on animals and a tax on agriculture ; the last, known as Zakat, is fixed at of the gross produce and is estimated to bring in about $15,000 a year. The taxes are mostly received in kind, and the late Wali was accustomed to send the goods thus collected to an agent whom he maintained at Bombay, where they were converted into cash. The revenue realised only sufiices to cover the expenses of government and no surplus is ever remitted to Masqat. The military force is fluctuating and consists of 50 to 200 'Askaris or armed levies who are paid from the local revenues; at present the number is about 60 distributed between446 DHUFAR DISTRICT Murbat, Salalah, Hafah and Bisut. These levies are now mostly local men^ not ; Omanis; in their number we have not included the personal retinue of the deputy-governor in the Hisn, The topography of the plain of Dhufar Proper and the Samhan hills is given in the articles under those names : the following is an alphabetically arranged table of the principal features and places in the remainder of the Dhufar district:— Name.

A ravine and village of 30 houses divided from Kakhyut to the east by the tract called ISailikot. The people are Qaras of the Shamasah and Bani 'Isa sections. A cape with a small anchorage on the east side of it formed by a concavity of the coast and sheltered from southerly and westerly winds. A small sandy bay, 2| miles wide at the entrance and 1^ miles deep; it is sheltered from the north and east but open to the south: the soundings are irregular from 8 to 26 fathoms. rbmaeks. There is a stream of running water and, at the mouth of the ravine, a date grove. The village is the westernmost in the Dhufar district. There are 100 sheep and goats; no boats. See article Murbat. 2 miles north of the point which forms the north end of the bay is the tomb of Salih- ibn-Hud There are date trees and a good spring, sufficient to supply 2 or 3 vessels in a day. The popula tion, consisting of 20 households of Jannabah, is poor and nearly naked; they inhabit low circular huts, built of stone, date branches and sea-weed, upon the cape. They have 60 sheep and goats, but no boats. A limestone hill called Jabal Qinqari with veins of chalk and gypsum overlooks the bay ; it is 1,300 feet high.DHOPAR DISTRICT 447 Name, Eakhyut Position, Eisut * On the coast miles west Eas Sajar. At the western extremity of Dhufar Pro per. Rori (Khor) At the eastern extremity of Dhufar Pro per, Nature. A village of 60 or 70 mud houses inhabit ed by Qaras of the Bait 'Ak'ak, Bait Hardan, Bait and Bait Shamasah sections; it stands at the mouth of ravine of the name and is sepa rated from Safqdt to the east by a mountainous ridge scarped on the side towards the sea a same A bay facing the east with a promontory of the same name on the south side of it. The bay is about 1 mile broad by half a mile deep. The beach is sandy and is divided from the plain of Dhufar Proper by some hundred yards of low sea cliff. The promontory is 200 feet high and 1 mile broad at its base ; it is covered with traces of human occupation, including a cemetery, I 3 acres in extent. Remarks, A remarkable lake or inlet of the sea run* ning a mile or more inland ; it is the es tuary of Wadi Dirbat from Jabal Samhan. The village stands on the west side of a creek, on the opposite side of which is a tower built by the 'OmSni Wali of Dhufar to keep off the attacks of hostile Mahras. Bakhyut has increased consi derably in the last 20 years in consequence of the expansion of the frankincense trade. Eakhyut is also called Qamar j+'i and occasionally Sa'duni from the name of a former chief. In the bay stands a mud-built bazaar of 15 or 20 shops, con structed by the Wsli of DhufSr and per manently occupied by Dhufar traders. In the trading season, between March and September, the num ber of shops in creases to 40 or 60. A guard of 10 or 15 'Askaris is always posted here. A tor rent bed reaches the bay through a small lagoon : l^ miles up this ravine is a fresh water spring. Boats from Stir and Masqat Town call here, but none belon^ to the place. There are 300 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. The inlet is divided from the sea by a sand bar over which the water flows at high tide. A pen insula, once fortified, adjoins the east side of the entrance. Re mains of ancient build ings surround the lake. * A Plaa of ^ Biaut anchorage will be found as a n inset in Admiralty chart No. 10 B.448 dhtjf A b district Name. Sad ah Position.

A small village on the sea at the mouth of a Wadi of the same name. There are 1 or 2 houses and about 20 caves, on both sides ot' the valley, inhabited by Qaras of the Ahl 'Umr section. A small village said to consist of 10 houses of Jannabah ; it is at the mouth of a deep ravine which here comes down to the sea. Sajar (Has) (Also pronounced Sagar and Sayir.) On the coast 32 miles west-south- west of Risut. The largest, but not the most striking cape on the south ern coast of Arabia. The sea around it is very deep. The sum mit is 3,380 feet above the sea, and the bluff extremity 2,770 feet, but the cape does not project much from the main land. The eastern side is not so high as the western, owing to the strata dipping to the east, but it is perpendi cularly scarped. The south-west side des cends in 3 or 4 grand steps to the sea. R kmaeks. The Wali of Dhufar formerly maintained a post of 15 'Askaris here, but it has been abolished : there are a few store-houses. The place depends on the frankincense trade. There are no boats except from other pluces. Cattle number 600 and goats and sheep 1,000. The people in habit caves in the sides of the valley. They do not recognise the authority of the Wali of Dhufar, but they give no trouble. Ras Sadar is a part of the Samban rnoun-' tains ; it consists of white and grey lime stone. Its sides, where not pevpendioular, are covered with trees, and the plains at the tcp with long grass. There are caverns inhabited by Jannabah on both sides, but chiefly on the eastern. The people are poor fisher men, about 20 in number, owning a few small, roughly made Boris. The Govern ment of India in 1879 fixed this cape as the boundary be tween the political jur isdictions of its officers at Masqat and Aden; the convenience of the arrangement is now open to question as the Waii of Dhufar hiis e.*&lt;tablished his control at Ral&lt;hjut 13 miles to the westward.DHUFAR PROPER 4,49 Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Sailik5t Between Bakhyut and Khaiitot. A stretch o£ coast. Here the highlands fall back somewhat from the sea and the ground descends to the coast in long shelves covered with grass and trees. Salah In the hills eastwards of Murbat, from which it is said to he distant two days' jour ney. A valley. This valley can only be reached on foot. It contains 12 huts of Qaras who own 150 cattle and 200 sheep and goats and import maize from Murbat. Salslah is the largest plaee in Dliufar : the second is Murbat which is the principal port of the district. -A low-lying maritime plain in the Dhufar District, DHUFAR* to which it gives its name; it is bounded by the sea on the south and the ... Samhan hills on the north, and extends from Rlsut on the west to Khor ^ ' Or j ^ Rori on the east. Its length is thus about 30 miles and its average PROPER depth less than 5 miles. Physical characteristies.—^he plain consists of miliolitic or freestone deposits covered by a rich alluvium; its elevation above the sea is trifling, and it is famed among Arabs as the most fertile and favoured district on the southern coast of Arabia. Numerous watercourses from the hills traverse the plain to the sea, and about a dozen of these, where they reach the shore, form creeks of which the water is partially fresh ; some are well-wooded and grassy inland, and some are densely grown with mangroves at the coast. Parts of the country are covered with a coarse grass which dries up in winter, and in places there is a jungle of acacia. Water is found everywhere at a few feet from the surface; the wells * The map and chart for Dhufar Proper are the same as for Dhufar District 2 G450 DHUFAB, PROPER are rrom 5 to 30 feet deep. At its west end the plain ends in a cul'desae 100 feet above sea level, behind a coast range of which the Ris^t promontory is a prolongation. At the east end it is connected with Murbat by a narrow maritime plateau which, from KhorRoritoa point four miles short of Murbat, is 100 feet above the sea except at breaches made by ravines. The coast from Taqa for 5 miles to the '4 westward consists of cliff about 100 feet high ; and from that point as f far as Dahariz it is low and is skirted by a mangrove swamp half a mile deep. There is generally a heavy surf upon the beach; and the landing which is effected in catamarans, is ordinarily difficult or at least unpleasant. Tabulation, —From the topographical table at the end of this article it may be deduced that the fixed population of Dhufar Proper numbers about 3,000 souls, and it will be seen that nearly all belong to the A1 Kathir tribe. The people, both nomads and non-nomads, wear their hair long and collect it by a fillet round their heads ; Saiyids, however, and the poorest classes have their heads shaved. The ordinary inhabitant of Dhufar has only one garment, a dark-blue sheet six cubits long by three broad, which forms a kilt by day and is his only bedding at night. Agriculture and animals, —The principal crops are bajri, maize, millet, cotton, and a little wheat and sugar-cane. There are no dates. Cocoanuts grow, but there is no surplus for export. Fruits are water and musk-melons, papai and a few plantains and mulberries. Some tobacco is produced, but the quantity is insufficient even for local consumption. Vegetables include bindis, and red pepper is grown; brinjals are seen, but only in the Wall's garden. Ploughs are not in usethe ground is tilled with spade or hoe. The people own camels, cattle, sheep and goats, but have no horses and few donkeys; the goats are of a peculiar and rather handsome variety known throughout 'OmaiL as Dhufar goats. Fish abound and acres of a small fish called 'Aid ^, resembling the sardine, may be seen drying near villages. Gazelle, hyaenas and,foxes are met with where there is cover. Administration, —Dhufar Proper is the only part of the Ihufar District which is effectively controlled by the Wali. The late Walihad his headquarters in the Hisn or fort upon the shore between Salalah and Hafah, a country residence and fort at Rizat, and a house and gardens at Hamran.DHUFAR PROPER 45] Topography. —The following are the principal plaees in Dhnfar Proper:— Name.

A village of about 75 occupied mud housea divided into two quarters with an in terval of half a mile between. The quar ter to the west is 'Auqad Bait Fadhil and has 60 houses ; the other is 'Auqad Bait Marhun which has now only 15 oc cupied houses. The quarters are named from the sections of the A1 Esthir tribe who inhabit them. Remabes. The inhabitants culti vate maize and bajri and collect frankin cense. The water- supply is from wells two or three fathoms deep. There are no boats. Cattle number about 600 and sheep and goats the same. Midway between Salalah and 'Auqad a stream beginning in a fresh water spring runs down with a zig zag course to the sea ; its banks are marshy and abound, in water fowl. Half a mile north of 'Auqad are the ruins of a fort. The ruins contain many sculptured remains, some M uhammadan, some possibly pre- Islamitio: among the former, near the north-east corner of the ruins, is the marble tombstone, admirably preserved and bearing the date 710 A. H., of Malik Ibrahim-bin-Mudhaf- far, who according to tradition was the first Arab ruler of Dhufar. Not far from Bilad is the shrine of'Abdul- lah-as-Samiri &lt; jUU | &amp;\ c a g a i n ^ from Malabar, whose inter cession is sought in the time of drought.

See article Salalah. The mountains here come down close to the sea and make a pleasing background. There are many anci ent remains, standing columns, stone sarco phagi, etc. A coast village of the Ras-al -Khaimah District in Trucial 'Oman^ situated 1 mile sontli of Bai'ah on the western shore of a sandy bay which is 6 miles in breadth and open from north-north-east to east; it is connected by a route^ which runs via the Qaliddi pass, with B,as-al- Khaimah Town on the other side of the 'Oman Promontory. Dibah is the frontier village, in this part, of Sharjah; Bai'ah, the next to the north, divided from Dibah merely by a small Wadi coming down to the sea, belongs to the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the 'Oman Sultanate. Bai'ah is ordinarily included under the name 'Dibah'; but it is really distinct from Hisn-ad-Dibah or Dibah proper and should not be confounded with it. Dibah is held as a fief by Rashid-bin-Ahmad, a first cousin of the Shaikh of Sharjah; he resides in the place and is described as Wali: the neighbouring village of Wamm is subject to his administration, and he receives the Zakat on dates from the village of Muhtarqah in Wadi- al -Qaliddi. The population of Dibah may be about 1,000 souls: there aie 100 houses of the peasant class called Bayadir, 50 of the 'Awanat tribe, 15 of Naqbiyin and 10 of Sharqiyin. To the south of the place aie extensive date plantations containing, it is estimated, about 10,000 palms. The water is good and the wells about 4 fathoms deep. Live stock are 20 camels, 50 donkeys and 700 sheep and goats* DIBAH454 DIBAI PRINCIPALITY DIBAI An independent Arab principality on the coast of Trucial 'Oman; its political position is explained in the article on that country, Dibai is PHflJTCT' situated between the Shaikhdoms o£ Sh&amp;rjall on the north and Abu PALITY* Dhabi on the south, meeting Sharjah on the coast at Abu Hail which lies partly on one side of the border and partly on the other, and Abu Dhabi at Khor Ghanadhah, a creek described in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, which runs inland for many miles and divides the principalities one from the other. Jabal-al-'Ali j the only hill on this coast, is in Dibai territory : it is 220 feet high, flat-topped, and lies 19 miles south-west of Dibai Town and 4 miles inland, being separated from the sea by a strip of low desert. It is often called Jabail Inland the extent of the influence of the Shaikh of Dibai is doubtful. The village of Hajarain, 50 miles south-east of Dibai Town in Wadi Hatta, at the present time recognises him as overlord; but the origin of the connection is exceptional, and the place must be regarded as an isolated dependency, for there are villages nearer to Dibai Town which do not acknowledge the Shaikh^s authority. Besides Dibai Town and the village of Hajarain, the latter being merely a distant protectorate, the only permanently inhabited place in the principality is Jumairah , a coast village about 3 miles south-west of Dibai Townj it consists of 45 date branch huts and is inhabited by Bani Yas, Manasir and mixed tribes who are all fishermen and own among them 5 camels, 60 donkeys, 45 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. None of the Bedouin tribes are expressly attached to Dibai, and the onlv recognised subjects of the Shaikh are accordingly the inhabitants of Dibai Town, of Jumairah and of H ajarain. The trade, shipping, etc., of the principality are simply those of the capital. The Shaikh maintains about 100 retainers armed with Martini rifles, and about 1,500 of his ordinary subjects are reported to be similarly armed. There are no customs at Dibai Town, but the revenues of the principality are said to amount to $51,400 a year, largely derived from the pearl fisheries. The Capital and only town of the principality of the same naine. it is situated on the coast of Trucial ^man, 7 miles south-west of ^ ie * For authorities, maps, charts, etc., see first footnote to article Trucial Otnai 1 ' f A representation of this hill will be found in Chart Ko» 23^3 2837-A. DIBAI TOWNDIBAI TOWN town of Sharjah and 79 miles north-east of the town of Abu Dhabi. At sea 20 miles to the west^south-west of Dibai town is ^Alaiwi^ the easternmost and nearest of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. Dibai stands on both sides of a creek,, with a shatllow and difficult entrance; which extends for some miles beyond the town in a south easterly direction; there is a small qnay for vessels able to go inside. The town consists of 3 main quarters : of these the principal is Dairah iji* ^ which stands on a tongue of land about 20 feet high on the north east side of the creek between it and the sea ; and has a date grove a mile in extent behind it. Dairah contains about 1;600 houses.—inhabited by Arabs ; Persians; Baluchis and others;—and the main bazaar of 350 shops. The other two quarters; Shandaghah and Dibai proper, lie on the south-west side of the creek; Shandaghah being the nearer to the sea. Shandaghah is the residence of the Shaikh of the Abu Dhabi Principality and contains some 250 houses all occupied by Arabs j Indians are not allowed to establish themselves here. Dibai proper contains about 200 houses and 50 shops; also the principal mosque and some ruins said to be those of a Portuguese fort; the Indians are all collected in this quarter. Ferry boats ply between Dairah and Dibai proper; and on Fridays the crossing is free to inhabitants of Dairah who go to worship in the J ami' mosque. There is good water at Dibai in wells from 5 to 80 feet deep. The town was once walled; but the wall is now in ruins ; on the landward side, however; are a number of towers of defence. The population of Dibai town; in all about 10;000 souls or rather more ; consists of the following elements : Bani Yas of the Al Bu Palasah and Sabais sections; 440 houses; Al Bu Mahaif; 400 houses j mixed tribes; chiefly Arabs and including Mazarr and natives of Bahrain and Kuwait; 400 houses; Persians; from various districts of Persia; 250 houses; Sudan^ 250 houses ; BaluchiS; 200 houses; natives of the Hasa Oasis; 50 houses ; Marar^ 30 houses ; and Shwaihiyin 10 houses. Nearly all of these are Sunnis of the Maliki sect. There are also 67 settled Hindus and 23 Khojahs^ British subjects; inclusive of women and children; and in the pearl season about 20 other Hindus visit the place. Date trees number about 4,000; but the yield is scanty : the only other cultivation is a little lucerne. Dibai town is reckoned to possess 1;650 camels; 45 horses; 380 donkeys; 430 cattle and 960 goats. About 335 pearl boats; 50 fishing boats and 20 seagoing vessels^ the last being chiefly Sambuks and BadanS; belong to the place; and 10 to 12 boats are built annually. The trade of Dibai is considerable and is rapidly expanding; chiefly in consequence of the enlightened policy of the late Shaikh; Maktum-bin-456 DIBAI TOWN Rasliar ; and the stringency of the Imperial Persian Customs on the opposite coast; Dibai is now in process of supplanting Lingeh as the chief entrepot of the foreign trade of Trucial ^Oniail. Dibai is now a port of call for the steamers of the British India and of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Companies, the vessels of the former calling regularly once a fortnight and those of the latter at intervals as opportunity offers. The only exports of local origin are pearls ; mother-of-pearl shells and dried fish. The imports are dates from Basrah^ Mlliab and Batinah; also rice, wheat, piece-goods, spices, metals, coir-rope and timber, chiefly from India. The town contains some 400 shops and 200 warehouses. A portion of the imports are destined for the interior, particularly for the Baraimi Oasis. Of the local merchants 23 are Hindus and 7 ate Khojahs under British protection. DIBDIBAH A large district in the Kuwait Principality, situated between Shaqq On the east, Shiqqaq on the north, the Batin on the north-west and Samman on the south-west; on the south it ends near Dhula ; -al- Mi'aijil. It extends little, if at all, further north than the latitude of Kuwait Town, and its northern end is about 25 miles west of Jahrah. Its total length is thus about 100 miles, and its breadth is perhaps 50. Dibdibah consists of featureless plains, with undulations so slight as to be almost imperceptible and yet sufficient to conceal camels at compara^ tively short distances ; it is almost destitute of landmarks. The district contains some pasture in the season; but it is a very poor country, there are no wells, and the nomads who frequent the northern part of it actually procure their drinking water from Jahrah. A certain number of gazelle are found in Dibdibah. Name. Position. Natura. E emabks, 'Auflarali (Umm- al-) sy+*Jj 10 miles west of Shaqq cn the same parallel of latitude as Biqa'i in the Batin.

Musannah is a ridge, but it is barely per ceptible and easily escapes notice. Nasi grass is produced here which the Bed ouins collect and sell at Kuwait Town. It is rather higher than the ridge to the east of Abul Hiran. i' L The principal village in the Shabankareh district of the Persian Coast, and the residence of the Khan who is its ruler. It is situated on a plain about 15 miles north-west of Burazjan, ^ a mile from the foot of the southernmost part of the coast range, at this point called Taviseh ; the defences consist of one or two insignificant forts built of stones and mud. The inhabitants are about 1,500 persons of the Haijab and Khajavan tribes, speaking Persian. Dih Kuhneh is the trade centre of the Shabankareh district, but depends chiefly on the cultivation of wheat, barley and dates. Water is from wells. There are about 20 horses and 400 donkeys besides some camels, and a regular caravan track exists between this place and Shif. DIH KUHNEH An Arab tribe located in Mesopotamia between Baghdad and Hit and DILAIM generally outside the limits of the present Gazetteer. They sometimes458 DILAIM encamp, however ; near tlie Baghdad-Karbala road about Mahmudiyah * They are closely connected with the Zubaid and would probably act with them in case of war. DILAM or DAILAM A small port situated on the coast of the Liravi District in Persia, but not forming part of it administratively ; it lies about 85 miles north- north-west of Bushehr Town and a similar distance east-north-east of the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab.t Dilam stands upon a low coast which extends north and south and consists of a strip of rocky land raised 10 to 15 feet above the sea-level, having swamps behind it that run inland for several miles. Half a mile to the south of the place is a little cultivation with some trees; and to the eastward is a? plain containing a few villages dependent on Dilam. A square fort stands in the middle of Dilam, and 1| miles to the north-eastwards is the fort of Tanub, again mentioned below, which protects the water-supply. Anchorage. —The anchorage for vessels, about 3|: miles off the shore^ is sheltered from the Shamal and partially from the Qaus ; the bottom is of soft mud and the depth of water 4 fathoms : native craft lie close to the beach in a creek in the mud-flats» Landing is difficult because of the mud, and cargoes are loaded and unloaded by means of donkeys. Inhabitants. —The population amounts to about 1,500 souls and is entirely Shi'ah; all the people are Persian-speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic also. Some are cultivators in the surrounding Liravi District, others sailors or fishermen, and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. Their houses are erections of sun-dried brick without an upper storey. The population seems to be decreasing as there are now about 100 unoccupied and ruinous houses. A number of recent emigrants from Dilam have settled at Fao in Turkish 'Iraq. Resources. —The resources of the place are inconsiderable. Drinking water is scarce and indifferent; it is brought from Tanub. About ^0 horses, 40 mules, 200 donkeys, 160 cattle and 500 sheep are owned by the inhabitants. There are 10 Bums, 10 Mashuwahs and 20 small fishing boats. * For information about the Dilaim, see Gazetteer of Baghdad (1890), pages 134-5 and 190. f It would seem natural to identify Dilam with the Mahruban of the medieeval Arab geographers ; but Mr. Le Strange^ the best authority, identifies it with Siniz. See his Lands of the Eastern Caliphate.

Oversea traffic is principally with Bushehr but also., to limited extent, with Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. The chief exports are wheat, barley, straw, insoluble gum, linseed, ghi and dried figs; imports include rice, coffee, sugar, tea, pepper, turmeric, dried limes of Masqat origin, and kerosine oil. The bazaar contains 90 shops. Ordinary Persian coin, mostly Qrans, is current. The standard of weight is a local Man of 14 lbs. 8| oz. English; there is also a Hashim Man of 16 ordinary local Mans or 2321 lbs. English. Communications,— route from Dilam to Zaidan (21 miles) and thence to Bebbehan Town (22 miles) has been recently described,^ and a coast route connects Dilam with Rig, 54 miles distant on the one side, and with Hindiyan Village at 27 miles on the other. Both of these routes are suitable for pack carriage and neither presents any serious difficulties.t Postal communication with Bushehr is by courier, and there is a post in each direction every week. Dilam is a station on the Persian Government's branch telegraph-line from Burazjan to Ahwaz ; it is. intermediate between the Rig and Behbehan Town stations. Administration. —Dilam is ruled by two local Khans (at present ; Abdul Husain and 'Abdur Eiza, brothers), who are under the authority of the Grovernor of the Gulf Ports; the Khans, who defer considerably to Saiyids and Mullas, dispose of criminal matters, and civil causes are settled by the Qazi and Mullas. J The general revenue of Dilam is inconsiderable, being farmed by the Khans from the Governor of the Gulf Ports for 1,250 Tumans a year, but, ; since the establishment of a post of the Imperial Persian Customs, the sea customs have yielded a substantial return. The Khans previously farmed the sea customs for 12,000 Qrans per annum; since direct management was instituted they have been receiving compensation at the rate of 500 Qrans annually, while the duties collected by the customs in 1905 amounted to 60,000 Qrans. The people of; Dilam are fairly well armed with Martini rifles and revolvers ; there is about one rifle to every house, * Vide a report by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, I.A., in the records of the Intelli gence Brancii, Simla. t See Routes in Persia, I, No. 21. A route from Bushehr to Dilam has recently been described by Col. Bailward, R.P.A. X Before the end of 1905 the Khans were removed by the Governor of the Gulf Ports who proceeded to appoint an outside nominee : it is impossible to say whether this innovation will become permanent.160 DlLAM Dependencies. —Two small places in the neighbourhood dependent on Dilam are the following Name, Position. Houses and inhabitants. R emarks. 'Amiri 6 miles north-east of Dilam on the route to BehbG* han. 60 mud huts of Lurs and 1 or 2 of Arab Saiyids. The village stands on slightly rising ground. Some grain is cultivated. There are a tew horses and about 200 sheep; also 2 wells of brackish water. Tanub miles north-east of Dilam. Half a dozen huts of cultivators who are dependents of a Saijidof Dilam. There is a little cultivation and a small fort built by a Sai vid, as an act of merit, to protect the water-supply of Diiam which is at this place and was formerly liable to be seized by enemies. DILAM The capita] and. administrative centre of the Kharj district of ^ Southern Najd, and itself sometimes loosely called a Kharj ^ ; it is situated about 50 miles south by east of Riyadh and perhaps 35 miles east-north-east of Hautah town. Dilam is walled and is said to consist of three wards styled respect ively Samhan ■ Suq pr* and Tuwalah . There is a fort within the walls occupied by Ibn Sa^ud^s representative, and some of the ordinary houses of the place have upper storeys; but the principal mosque is a mean construction in the poor Wahhabi style of architecture. There is one large school, the Madrasah Shaikh Makhdhub besides a number of small ones. The population of Dilam is about 1,500 souls; there are 100 houses of ^ Aid, 60 of Bani Tamim, 20 of Dawasir, 20 of Sabai 5 and 100 of inferior tribes. Reports agree in describing the date groves of Dilam as extensive and as containing between 10,000 and 15,000 palms. Wheat and maize are grown and even a little rice; there are also citrons, grapes, lemons, figs, pomegranates, melons and lucerne. Irrigation is from wells of good water, 6 to 8 fathoms in depth, and from the Farzan rivulet described in the article on Kharj. Livestock are estimated at 600 camels, 100 donkeys and 300 cattle; there are few horses or none. The bazaar contains about 30 shops, supplied with piece-goods and sundries from Hasa and with coffee from Yaman via Hautah.DIMNAH 461 Dilam is at present governed in the name of the Wahhabi Amir by one Hasan, a Yamani of the Qahtan tribe, specially appointed by Ibn Sa'ud. He is not a local man ; but he has with him at Dilam about ^0 households of his relations and personal dependents. In the Eastern Hajar of the 'Oman Sultanate : a valley which rises in a Saih or desert plain to the north of the Baldan-al-lVTasakirah division of Sharqiyah and^ running* northwards^ joins Wadi Tayin on the right bank at the village of Sidafi. The following are the villages of Wadi Dima in descending order from its head to Sidafi Dairah (70 houses)^ Samut (50 houses), Ghamsah ( 60 houses), Oaryah (150 houses)^ Hail (20 houses), Qutaifi (40 houses), Barkyat jj (60 houses), Ahla M (20 houses), Samhan (50 houses), Hisn (180 houses), Harrah (20 houses), Qabsah ^ (10 houses), 'Auf ^ (80 houses) and Hajir j+U (]00 houses). All the villages are on the left bank except Dairah, Harrah and 'Auf which are on the right bank and Hajir which is on both sides ; the inhabitants, some 4,500 souls, all belong to the Bani Shahaim except those of Hajir who are Bani Euwahah. Hajir is within sight of Sidafi. Livestock are estimated at 350 camels, 550 donkeys, 600 cattle and 2_,500 sheep and goats, distributed approxi mately in proportion to the size of the villages. Date palms number about 50,000, of which the majority are at Hisn (10,000), Qaryah (9,000) and Barkyat (8,000). DIMA (WADI) (./O •ON A small village in the Qra'ah district of the Kuwait Principality, situated on a low bank of sand about 200 yards from the sea and 6 miles east-south-east of Kuwait Town. The village belongs to the 'Awazim, contains 25 houses, and is inhabited in the cold weather only. In the hot weather the people find employment at the pearl fisheries or in the date gardens on the Shatt-al -'Arab. The inhabitants have only 1 or 2 Horis; they fish principally by means of Hadhrahs or tidal weirs upon the beach. A few donkeys and some poultry belong to the village. There area number of wells but only a few hold water, which is brackish and hardly more than sufficient for the requirements of the village. There is no recognised headman, and the Shaikh of Kuwait deals direct with the village through the first inhabitant whose presence he can secure. DIMNAH462 DIMNAH DIWANI YAH UJ QADHA Tlie houses o£ Dimnah are typical of tlie country about Kuwait and may therefore be described. They consist of a single room each with a floor-space of 30 feet by 10 feet. The walls are of mud,, 4 feet high, and support a gable roof, 7 feet high at the ridge, of light rafters and Basrah reeds covered with date-leaf matting. The door is low, and there is no window. A fireplace and a slightly raised stand for coffee pots, constructed of mud, occupy one end of the apartment. A division of the Sanjaq of the same name in the Wilayat of Baghdad, in Turkish ^Iraq. Position and 'boundaries. —The Qadha of Diwaniyah is situated upon the Euphrates between Hillah and Samawah, chiefly, if not entirely, upon the left or eastern bank. It is bounded on the east by the Qadlia of Hai in the Basrah Sanjaq of Muntafik; on the south by the Qadlia of Samawah ; on the west by that of Shamiyah ; on the north-west by that of Hillah ; and on the north by the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah in the Baghdad Sanjaq. Topography and tribes. —The only places of size in the Qadha are the town of Diwaniyah, described elsewhere under its own name, and the Dagharah and 'Afaj settlements of which mention is made in the article on the Dagharah canal ; to these may be added the village of Fuwwar referred to in the article on the Euphrates. The following (apart from the Dagharah tract, the article on which may be consulted) are the Muqata'ahs or tracts of which the Qadha is composed and the tribes that inhabit them :— Tracts.

Further information about tribes will be found in the article on the Dagharah canal, the whole of the tract watered by which is situated in this Qadha.DlWANlTAH TOWN Population. —The total fixed population of the district is estimated at 50,000 souls, of whom all are Muhammadans and all (except about 500 Sunnis at Diwaniyah Town) are Shi'ahs. Besources. —^Dates, wheat, barley and rice are cultivated, and the usual animals are owned. According- to the latest Turkish official statistics the date palms in the Qadha number 100,000. Administration. —Diwamyah being the Markaz Qadha in the Sanjaq of the same name has no Qaim-Maqam ; but is personally governed by the Mutasarrif resident at Diwaniyah Town, who is also in direct charge of the Markaz Nahiyah or subdivision likewise called Diwaniyah. There are 3 other Nahiyahs in the district, viz., 'Afaj (3rd class), Budair^^j (1st class) and Dagharah (1st class); the Mudirs of the first and last of these are stationed at the villages bearing the same names which are described in the article on the Dagharah. canal, and the Mudir of the second has his headquarters at a place called Budair. The town of Diwaniyah. is the chef-lieu of the whole Qadha. The chief town of the Sanjaq of the same name in Turkish 'Iraq ; it stands upon the Euphrates about 65 miles below Hillah Town and 75 miles above Samawah Town by the course of that river, and it consists of two portions upon opposite banks united by a boat-bridge of nine pontoons. Di wanly ah has now, in consequence of the drying up of the reach of the Euphrates on which it stands, nothing to recommend it as an administrative centre except its central position in the Sanjaq, Upstream as far as the boundary of the Hillah Qadha and downstream as far as Rumaithah, agriculture has ceased for want of water; and the villages, though many of them are still standing, are practically deserted. At the town itself the pontoons composing the boat-bridge may sometimes be seen reposing upon dry «and. The main quarter of Diwaniyah, about ^ of the whole, half •composed of brick-built houses and including the Sarai or govern ment offices and the barracks, is upon the left bank of the riverbed; the right bank quarter consists altogether of houses of sun-dried brick. The town is open and undefended except by a ruinous wall on the left bank: the open desert surrounds it on every side. The population does not exceed 4,000 and is decreasing. It consists almost entirely of Arabs, of whom all but 150 are Shi'ahs : there are also some 50 Turks, 45 Jews, 30 Persians, and half a dozen Christians. There are two public baths. DIWANI YAH TOWN464, DlWANlYAH TOWN The trade of the place, whieh has dealings with Najaf and Baghdad as well as with Basrah, is insignificant and is confined to the export of ordinary agricnltural and pastoral prodnce and to the import of a few common articles. Even this small degree of trade depends largely on the still flourishing settlements upon the Dagharah canal, some way to the north-east, and on properties of the Dairat-as-Sanlyah at some distance ofi. The town itself has only a few date trees, and for supplies it depends upon outlying' places connected with it. There are about 200 ordinary shops, besides eight cafes, fonr Khans or caravansarais and four 'Alwahs or grain stores. For eight months in the year the Euphrates river is dry and the inhabitants get their drinking water from wells, which are fortunately sweet. The Turkish Government had some difficulty in compelling the chief officials of the Diwaniyah. Sanjaq to remove from Hillah, where they had established themselves, to their proper headquarters here; indeed this measure was not successfully enforced until about 12 years ago. Among the civil officers is a Mamur of the Public Debt Department. The mili tary garrison of Diwaniyah consists nominally of one battalion of regular infantry and three guns ; but three of the four infantry companies are crenerally on duty in the district^ collecting revenue, etc., and the normal garrison is only about 80 men. Perhaps 100 Radifs can be called up at Diwaniyah, which is the headquarters of the 3rd battalion of the 86tli Radif regiment, Diwaniyah is connected with Hillah by a double line of telegraph and with Samawah by a single line. The town is constituted as a municipality. This river, coming down from the Persian frontier north-east of Baghdad City, lies outside the scope of the Gazetteer except at its mouth, which opens into the Tigris at a point 10 miles south-east of Baghdad in a direct line and over 20 miles distant from it by river. Just above the confluence the banks of the Diyalah are united by a boat- bridge of 16 pontoons divided into four sections, which are connected by planks; each boat is 32 feet long, 12 feet wide, 6 feet deep and flat bottomed. Except at the bridge, where the approaches though ramped are difficult for wheels, the banks (in this part of the Diyalah) are mostly precipitous and rise about 30 feet above the stream. For two miles from the bridge on the left bank the country is much cut up by water channels, and beyond this again the country is open desert—DIZ RIVBB 46 5 cultivable but uncultivated—in all directions. At the end of the bridge tofte^ on the right bank are about 80 huts and on the left bank 15: these 'PWtcial compose a small village called Diyalah which is inhabited by mixed 'slatjeljdi tribes, chiefly Zubaid of the A1 Bu Khattab section. From the begin- I somejuj. nin f of December to the middle of April the Diyalah is navigable by ■lijali a(,, native craft as far as the town of Ba'qubah, but during the rest of the i,ii(l f otslI | y ea ^ P ar % in consequence of the water drawn off by important canals, it 'Wnlontj , ' S a s ' w ^ ow stream of no consequence. The Diyalah apparently serves as isataisaiii &amp; boundary between the Baghdad and 'Aziziyah Qadhas, tte fei from si Pot The Diz river rises in the mountains of South-Western Persia in the DlUfi vicinity^of Burujird, enters 'Arabistan at a point about 15 miles north RIVER of Dizful Town, and joins the Karun exactly at Band i-Qir. ^ ^DIZ Course and general characteristics. — After passing the town of Dizful on its left bank, it being here a swift and not very deep river but partially obstructed by rocks, the Diz runs for about 12 miles to the south-west; in this reach its bed is broad and shingly, the stream flowing in several channels, and a number of small canals take off on either bank, especially on the left bank where there is a tract of heavily irrigated country. At about 11 miles below Dizful Town the Diz is joined on its right bank by the Balarud and near the same place it changes its direc- tion to south-south-east; 11 or 12 miles further on it passes the village of Abdush Shah upon its left bank, and 3 or 4 miles beyond 'Abdush Shah it receives the perennial 'Ajirub stream as a tributary upon that side. At a place about 30 miles south-south-eastwards in a direct line from Dizful Town the Diz leaves the village of Dih Nau upon its left; and several miles further on it reaches Kut Bandar virtually the upper limit of navigation^ at which point a rocky ridge not more than a hundred feet high, with a north-westerly and south-easterly direction, is pierced by the river in its course : this ridge is named Umm-al-'Ayai , A couple of miles before arriving at Kut Bandar a place Lim (or Ilm) Kathir ; which is only about 16 miles south-west of Shushtar Town, is passed on the left bank ; a left-bank tributary known as the Shureh y which may perhaps be identified with the Kaunak stream, enters the river immediately above Lim. Kathlr, and a small right-bank466 DIZ EIVER affluent called the Mukhaibat b£ whicH the source is not knownj falls into it just above Kut Bandar. From Kut Bandar the Diz continues its south-south-easterly course to within 10 miles or less of the right bank of the Karun above Wais, when it swerves to the north-east and enters the Karun at the confluence of its Shatait and Gargar branches 3 before turning north- eastward it is joined on its right bank by the Shaur river, the most important of its tributaries, in two channels which are described in the article under the name Shaur. For some distance above Kut Bandar, and below that place for the whole way to Band-i-Qir, the course of the Diz is serpentine in an extraordinary degree; thus Kut Bandar, which in a straight line is only about 25 miles from Band-i-Qir, is distant from that place by river no less than 85 miles. To speak generally, the Diz is swifter, shallower and (above Kut Bandar) more broken up by obstacles than the Karun. The average fall of the Diz appears to the eye to be more rapid than that of the Shatait or Gargar. It cuts its way through an alluvial plain between steep banks which rise 10 to 20 feet above flood level and outside of which there is no marked valley or river basin. The banks are frequently several hundred yards apart at bends, and there-entrant curves are occupied by low deposits of mud overgrown with scrub. From about 20 miles south of Dizful Town to within about the same distance of its junction with the Karun the course of the Diz lies in a belt of brushwood, not usually more than 2 or 8 miles wide and in places less, frequently broken by gaps through which glimpses are caught of limitless plains. Trees from 30 to 40 feet in height are scattered through this jungle, yet there is no wood fit for use except as firewood : the principal trees and shrubs are the Gharab or Euphrates poplar, the Sarim, the fcamarisk, the liquorice bush, and a sort of blackberry. Fuel for the steamers on the K&amp;run, for the towns of Shushtar and Nasiri; and to a certain extent £or Bizful Town is obtained from this tract. The climate of the Diz country is undoubtedly much more humid than that of 'Arabistan generally, and in spring there is abundant pasturage upon both sides of the river. Fuel and fodder are obtainable, and the Arabs of the neighbourhood own numbers of buffaloes, cattle, sheep and goats. On the left bank immediately above Kut Bandar there is much unirrigated cultivation of wheat and barley. Irrigation. —At all seasons of the year the Diz is of a darker colour than either the Gargar or Shatait; it assumes, when in flood, a deep red hue near Dizftil Town and one verging on chocolate at Band-i-QfrDIZ RIVER 467 M Tlie proportion of silt carried is about the same as in the Karun. In 'Arabistan the Diz is hardly utilised for irrigation except in the reach immediately below Dizful Town, where the level of the country on either side is not much higher than that of the stream. The following is a list of the principal canals which tap the Diz in the Dizful District, but their exact relative positions and the spelling of some of the names are uncertain :— Right Bank. Qanat Sin jar. Nahr QaFeh Tuq. Shuhan. Shakhak. Zawiyeh Bakhtiyari. „ Shaikh. „ Kalantarha. Bunwar Nazir. „ Khwajeh Husain. J ateh. Left Bank. Qanat Shahabad.

Kutiyan. Jibar. Sharafabad (watering a number of villages, among them ^Abbas, Asad Khan, Hajiabad, Jibar, Kuwigh and Sharafabad). Nahr-i-Kilmilak (with head at Dizful Town). Navigation, —In a favourable state of the river there is no obstacle, except a strong current, to navigation between Band4-Qir and Kut Bandar—a distance, as already remarked, of 85 miles by water. At Kut Bandar the channel is interrupted by a reef of rock ; the rock however is pierced by an opening, about 20 yards from the left bank, which in a good river carries from 4^ to 6 feet of water, but is somewhat difficult owing to the strength of the current. A little higher up there is a second reef, but the soundings in the passage through it are better. Above Kut Bandar, in consequence of a steeper inclination of the river bed, the current becomes more rapid; the depth also is less, and the 2 H 2468 DIZ EIVER gravelly and in places the stony nature of the bottom would make it dangerous to force a lightly built vessel should she show signs of grounding. Kut Bandar may therefore be taken as the practical limit of navigation for steamers of the type of the ' Shushan which last visited the place in March 1905. Villages and inhabited tracts.—The villages on both banks of the Diz below Dizful Town are described in the article on the Dizful District ; the last of these is Dih Nau, below which there is nothing adjacent to either bank that can be reckoned as a permanent village. There are^ however, both above and below Dih Nau, a number of habit able tracts distinguished by names, and these are described in descending order in the table below :— Name, Position.

The northern limit of Dizful is a line running eastwards from a spot on or near the Dawairij stream so as to include Pa-i-Pul ; the tract of Mazra'eh Salihabad and the villages of Sar Bisheh and Ab Bid; on the east the boundary is at first an imaginary line passing between the villages of Kaunak and Shalgahi in Dizful and those of Pahwindeh and Farajabad in tlie Shushtar District; and thereafter it may be taken to be the Diz river as far southwards as a point between Lim Kuthar and Kut Bandar; the line then turns to the west, leaving the 'Anafijeh in the Ahwaz District, and continues in the same direction, crossing the Shaur and Karkheh rivers on the way, until it joins the undemaicated Perso- Turkish frontier. That frontier itself constitutes the boundary of the Dizful District upon the west. Topography. —Below is a tabular statement of the principal places in the Dizful District, from which it will appear that the settled popu lation probably amounts to about 61,500 souls, inclusive of the inhabi tants (45,000) of Dizful Town.

Water is brought from the Diz river by canal.'&amp;Co) \ ^ \ DIZFtTL TOWN The town of DizfQl is situated on the left bank of the Diz about 20 miles below the point where that river leaves the hills. and huitdings. —The site of Dizful is elevated and somewhat uneven, falling away on the river face in conglomerate cliffs about 100 feet high, the foot of which is washed by the river when in flood ; on the left bank these cliffs do not extend beyond the town in either direction, but they are found again on the right bank a short distance up-stream. The length of Dizful upon the river is about miles, and its depth inland about three- fourths of a mile. The houses are closely packed, and most of them have an upper storey ; many are of brick and well built. The streets are narrow and crooked, and the central portions, which are neither paved nor cobbled and are used as common sewers, become in wet weather canals of black and putrid filth; raised side walks for foot passengers, however, about 18 inches wide, run along their sides. On the side next the Diz the houses are built on the face of the precipitous bank, the foundations of the lowest being on a level with the water's edge ; and several steep, narrow paths afford access from the town to the river. Dizful contains 38 mosques and no less than 24 shrines, some of which are Imamzadehs and some Qadamgahs. The shrines are said to be still used to some extent as places of Bast or sanctuary from the law : the most important are the Imamzadeh of Baba Yusuf &lt;-0^3 bb, in the south-east corner of the town, and that of Sultan Husain u/kU situated on the left bank of the river above the town in a suburb called Buband A canal called Qanat-i- Gavdul takes off from the left bank of the river between Buband and the main town. At the southern extremity of Dizful town the river is spanned by an 483 river DIZFUL TOWN ancient bridge, which, with the numerous water-mills above it, is the chief feature of the place. The bridge is about 430 yards in length and consists of 24 arches, all slightly, pointed but not uniform in shape or span. The piers are built of large blocks of cut stone; the superstructure is of brick, and different parts of it evidently belong to different periods. The roadway is about 16 feet wide and roughly cobbled : the parapets in some places have disappeared. The bridge generally is in bad repair; and an arch built of brick by the townspeople, to replace one which collapsed two years ago, is of inferior workmanship. Convenience of communication with the country to the west, and consequently, to some extent, the prosperity of Dizful town, depend on the existence' of this bridge. The mills, of which particulars are given below, are 39 in number, and stand upon rocks and artificial islands, mostly near the left bank ; some of them are connected with others by gangways, and all are 2 i 2 I ll II || ' ill I484 DIZFtTL TOWN liable to be submerged in the spring floods. A permanent canal, known as Nahr-i- K ilmilak , leaves the river on the east side below the bridge. The only edifice on the right bank of the river is the mansion of the Persian Governor of Northern •'Arabistan, a modern construction, known jis the Kushk ciUy. It consists of an enclosure, about 500 feet in length by 300 in breadth, and contains several buildings ; it is surrounded by an ordinary high brick wall, the only semblance of a fortification which exists at Dizful. People. —The population of Dizful is about 45,000 souls and is increaS' ing. It has absorbed many heterogeneous elements, and some of the groups of which it is composed still bear names or cherish traditions indicative of foreign origin: such are the Jama^at Giwehkashan ^ who claim to be of Lur extraction ; the Afshars , who call them selves descendants of Nadir Shah ; and the Khawanin some of whom I name Jenghiz Khan as their ancestor. Nevertheless, the people of j Dizful have been brought by a process of assimilation and fusion to resemble one another so closely that they now form a community homogeneous in language, customs, and details of dress, and by them selves may even be considered to constitute a Persian type. No Lnrs proper, Kurds^ or Arabs reside within the town. The most prominent sections of the populace are the Saiyids, who number 6,000 souls and are j divided into a multitude of subsections \ the Tujjar ;U J or merchants, who are 5CO households or less ; the Mashaikh who are reckoned at 250 houses ; and the Khawanin, who are estimated at 100 houses. [ The lower orders belong to a base type ; they are .dirty, discontented, unhealthy, and peculiarly ill-favoured, in appearance. The better classes, such as the Saiyids, are many of them, respectable and well mannered. ! The only religion is the Shfah faith in its standard form, and ' there are i no Babis, ^Ali Ilahis, or avowed infidels.' Although the people gen erally ar9 bigoted and fanatical in reg-ard to their particular form of I religion, no signs of hostility to foreigners are apparent at ordinary times. Politically the ordinary townsmen of Dizful are a negligeable quantity. Occupations, industries and trade.' —A considerable number of the inhabitants of Dizful exercise vocations connected with religion: shop keepers number about 2,000 : the remainder are employed in the local industries. The indigo of Dizful, though inferior to that imported fromDIZFtJL TOWN 485 India, enjoys local favour, and the average annual output is estimated at 3 ; 000 Dizfuli Mans : it is graded in three qualities and fetches from 30 to 60 Qrans per Dizfuli Man.* Agricultural implements, stirrups, bits, horse and mule-shoes, knives, and tools are manufactured at Dizful from imported iron and steel; rifles are repaired; copper is converted into cooking-pots; and brass and German silver are made into samovars and pipe-bowls and are used for inlaying iron. Floor-cloths, ^Abas and hats of felt, various cotton textiles both plain and striped for clothing, cotton webbing, ^Abas of woollen thread, riding and pack- saddles or Palans, earthenware and blue enamelled pottery, linseed oil, gunpowder and bullets, lacquered pen-cases and similar articles of papier- mache, also native soap for washing clothes, are among the other manu^ factures of the town. Some of the inhabitants are occupied in the stamping of designs on cloth with wooden blocks, in dyeing, lime-pound ing, rice-cleaning, cotton-ginning, in the making of cotton shoes and in the cleaning of hides for tanning. There are also builders, bricklayer millers, basket-makers^ bath-keepers, and butchers. The curious profes sion of the Sagpa b ^ deserves mention ; he keeps a large number of dogs which he hires out for the protection of flocks or cultivation. The 39 mills already mentioned grind flour and are actuated by wooden water-wheels. Only 12 of them can ply when the water is at its lowest in summer. The ordinary charge for grinding is 7 Siyah Pul and a handful of flour for every Dizfuli Man ground. The annual cash earnings of a mill vary from 20 to 50 Tumans, of which half goes to the owner and half to the Persian Government; the owners are people of the town, and some of them are exempt from the Government demand. All foreign goods and most goods from a distance are imported from Shushtar or ' Amarah by the large merchants, and as a rule are deposited by them in their private houses ; for—except Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and four of the principal local merchants— the business men of Dizful have no warehouses other than their ordinary residences. The smaller dealers and shopkeepers purchase from the larger merchants, and even they do not, as a rule, keep their more valuable goods at their shops. Small shops are found scattered in various streets, but there is also a large bazaar which consists of three or four lines of booths, each row of stalls standing back-to-back with the next; it is always crowded with purchasers from town and country. Caravans from 'Arabistan for Khurramabad start from DizfuL ♦ At the present time the indigo works are closed and the owners have removed their plant on account of the excessive in,posts placed by the Sardar-i-Mnkarram, the new Governor of Northern 'Arabistan, npon the industry (1906).486 PIZFtTL TOWN Supplies and transport.— is an unlimited supply o£ river water^ wtiicli is used for all domestic purposes * and is also taken off for irriga tion by Qanats or subterranean conduits on both banks above and at the town. A large supply of grain and meat is always available; and recently (1905) a Persian military force of over 2,000 men for some time drew its supplies from Dizful. Firewood is obtained from the banks of the 'Diz river below Kut Abdush Shah and from the Karkheh district; and, during floods, the supply is increased by a quantity of inferior drift-wood retrieved from the river. It is estimated that 300 camels and 1,000 mules accompanied by professional drivers could, in ordinarily favourable circumstances, be obtained at Dizful upon short notice. Administration and political influences, —The Persian administrative staff at Dizful, besides the Naib-ul-Hukumat or Deputy Governor— who is at present (1905) the Telegraph Master—consists of only 2 Mirzas or clerks and 4 Parrashes or orderlies. The real power, botk in the town and in the surrounding country, is held by the religions leaders of the community, the most important of whom are the Mujtahids. The civil authorities can only make themselves obeyed when they have bought or otherwise secured the countenance of the predominant religious faction of the day; and Lur or Arab chieftains of the neighbourhood, if they have reason to distrust the intentions of the Persian Governor towards them, will only obey his summons to appear when it is accompanied by a safe-conduct from the chief Mujtahid (Agha Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, Hujjat-ul-Islam). t The supreme power is in the hands of the chief Mujtahid, who is generally liked and respected, and has up to the present shown himself agreeable and polite rn his dealings with the representative of the British Government. The Mujtahids are the dispensers of public charity, and collect for the purpose the Zakat or alms prescribed in the Quran ; most of them how ever, having little private property, are supposed to act upon a familiar proverb to the prejudice of the destitute and distressed. There are 27 schools at Dizful in which reading, writing, and religious subjects are taught ] a few are kept by ordinary Mullas, but the rest are held in the houses of the Mujtahids, that of the chief Mujtahid being attended * In mediaeval times the water was raised from the river to the level of the town hy a mechanical contrivance worked by a water wheel. See Le Strange. t Since the above was written the position has been modified by the appointment c the Sardar-i-Mukarram to the Governorship of Arabistan under whom the Deputy Governorship has been abolished and respect for authority enforced ; but it isunceitam how long the moro vigorous regime whieh has been initiated Will last (1906).DOHAH 487 by 150 to 200 pupils. Notwithstanding their great local influence the Mujtahids of Dizful are of less importance politically than tho^e of Shushtar. There is also at Dizful an official called the Imam Jum^eh &lt;1*^. whose office is virtually hereditary and at present a sinecure; he is supposed to lead the Friday prayers in the principal mosque ; but this function has fallen into desuetude. The appointment was originally ecclesiastical^ but the recognition of the Persian Government has rendered it semi-secular. The present holder of the office (Saiyid Abus Salam) is possessed of considerable private property, receives a salary of 300 Tumans a year in quarterly instalments from the Imperial Customs treasury, is on good terms with the Mu]tahids ; and has some influence with the surrounding Arab tribes. A Persian telegraph office and post office exist at Dizful; and there is a custom house presided over by a director, under whom are a dozen guards. 1 Generally so styled at the present day, but Bedouins sometimes call it Dohat-al-Qatar ; and it seems to have been formerly better known as Bida^ [Anglice ' Bidder ') : it is the chief town of Qatar and is situated on the eastern side of that peninsula, about 63 miles south of its extremity at Ras Rakan and 45 miles north of Khor-al -^Odaid. Harbour. —Dohah stands on the south side of a deep bay^ at the south-western corner of a natural harbour ^ which is about 3 miles in extent and is protected on the north-east and south-east sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east betvfeen the points of the reefs; it is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular : the bottom is white mud or clay. Town site and quarters, —The south-eastern point of the bay is quite low j but the land on the western side is stony desert 40 or 50 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built up the slope of some rising ground between these two extremes and consists of 9 Fanqs or quarters, which are given below in their order from the east to the west # A plan of the harbour of Dohah is given in Chart No. 2374—2837-Bi DOHAH 1 1 i I488 DOHAH and north: tlie total frontage of the place upon the sea is nearly 2 miles.

There were formerly a few Eritish Indians at Dohah of whom 2 or 3 were permanent settlers; but their occupations, in consequence of the A1 Thani Shaikhs having entered personally on the business of pearl merchants, ceased to be profitable and all of them have now taken their departure. The people of Dohah are, as a general rule, unhealthy in appearance— a circumstance which is attributed to their assiduity in pearl diving, this being a form of employment which places a severe strain on the human constitution. Occupations, shipping and trade, Baharinah are blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and petty pearl dealers; the other tribes live by pearl diving, sea lishing and a small maritime carrying trade. About 350 pearl-boats, 60 sea-going boats running to ^Oman, the Persian coast and Basrah, and 90 lishing boats are owned at Dohah. Pearls are the only export; and the imports resemble those of the coast towns of Trucial Oman, foreign trade is chiefly with Bahrain and, in a lesserZCC} DORAQ 491 degree, with Liugeh. Dohah is naturally the chief market town of the Bedouins of the Qatar peninsula. Supplies, water and transjo Little can be obtained locally in the shape of supplies. Firewood is brought from the interior and from Clarence Strait. Dohah itself possesses only one well of brackish water ; named ''Ain Walad Sa'id sy*.** ^ which is ^ a mile to the south of the Dohah quarter j but there is a group of others called Mushairib with fairly good water, at 1 mile to the west of the Dohah quarter. Three miles further inland is Bir-al-Jadidah jxs } a large masonry well of indifferent water on which the town mainly depends for its supply. A mile beyond to the southwards are the wells of Na^aijah^ from which the Shaikhs of the A1 Thani, the other notables of Dohah town and the officers of the Turkish garrison obtain their drinking water. The best of the Na^aijah wells is called 'Asailah . The Turkish troops obtain most of their w r ater from Mushairib^ where there is a military outpost of 8 men in a tower to watch the wells. The soldiers have now a vegetable garden at this place; and scurvy &gt; which was for merly common among the garrison, has^disappeared* About 150 horses and 800 camels are kept at Dohah. Political post Hon, —Dohah may be regarded as inmost respects the capital of Qatar and its place in the political system will be apparent from the general article on Qatar. The Turkish garrison which bespeaks, though it cannot enforce, the Turkish claim to sovereignty over all Qatar is stationed here ; but Jasim-biu-Thani, the most influen tial Shaikh of the promontory, avoids residing in the place. The town is at present ruled by Jasinr's fourth son ; Abdullah, he being recognised as Shaikh of Dohah both by his father and by the Turks, The appoint ment of a Eais-al-Liman or Turkish harbour master is said to be contem plated (1907). This name is sometimes used to designate the town of Fallahiyeh. and £)OEAQ the country about it, inhabited by the Ka'ab tribe, or even the whole or of the FallaMyeh. District in Southern 'Arabistan.

The date-palms are said to number 25,000, and livestock comprises 20 horses, 200 donkeys, 120 cattle and 500 sheep and goats. The village is held in Tiyul by a relative of the Salar-i- Mu^azzam and is farmed by the Khan of Shabankareh to prevent its falling into the hands of any rival Khan. Eevenue is collected at the rate of 20 to 100 Qrans per Gau of cultivation. The defences of the place consist of 4 towers. A considerable village of over 200 stone and mortar houses on the coast of the Lingeh District in Persia, about 7 miles north-west of Bustaneh and 4 miles east of Mughu ; to the south-west of the village is a pearl bank, known as the Duvvan bank, close to the shore. The village is divided into two quarters; that on the west is called Kafarghan or Duvvan Qawasim, is inhabited by Qawilsim, and pays revenue to the Deputy-Governor of Lingeh ; that on the east is called Duvvan A1 ^Ali after the tribe inhabiting it and is under the Shaikh of Charak. The Al 'Ali, who are only about half as numerous as the QawSsim, have a large fort in which they reside for fear of their enemies, the Maraziq of Mughu. Except a few Wahhabis , all the people are Sunnis. The Al 'Ali have 12 pearling vessels (Sambuks) which work on the Arabian side of the Gulf and sometimes at Farur island ; they also possess about 2fi smaller craft (Baqarahs, 'Amilahs, Shu'ais and Varjis) which they use for fishing and pearling near Bustaneh and for fishing at Tariir island. The Qawasim own H Sambuks which run as far as Basrah on the one side and the Batinah coast of 'Oman on the other; also 2 'Amilahs and 3 Shu'ais. The Al 'All have about 70 rifles and are a warlike tribe : of the Qawasim only about 15 possess rifles. The people are sailors, fisher men, pearl-divers, agriculturists and date-growers ; some of them are Nakhudas in command of boats belonging to ports on either side of the Gulf which ply upon the Lingeh and SMbkuh coasts. Animals are 100 camels, 100 donkeys and 700 sheep and goats ; the camels are kept in the hills near Bustaneh. There are wells of sweet water and, in addition to these, each of the quarters possesses 2 reservoirs.m EUPHRATES EUPHRA TES or_ FURAT* o^AJ) The lengtH of tMs famous river between Fallujall— -the pbini where it enters our purview—and its junction with the Tigris at Qurnah is, by the winding course w r hich it follows, nearly 400 miles; its general direc tion between the extreme points mentioned is from north-west to south- east, but it runs in a curve of which the hollow is on the north-eastern or Mesopotamian side. To describe fully and with correctness this, the lower course of the Euphrates, is at present impossible. The survey made in 1836 of the river below Samawah. and the survey dated 1860-65 of the portion between Khan Maqdam and Samawah are now antiquated, and reliable detailed information about the changes that have taken place in recent years is not, when it relates to the more inaccessible reaches of the river, easy to procure. So far, however, as these difficulties permit we shall endeavour to describe the Euphrates,—first in its general and topogra phical aspects, and then with reference to navigation and irrigation. General course and character. principal points that, mark the line of the Euphrates in its lower course are the towns of Musaiyib, Hillah, Diwaniyali, Samawah, Nasiriyali and Suq-asli-Shuyukli, by which it passes. This part of the river may be divided into three sections; an upper section from Fallujah to Musaiyib^ a central section from Musaiyib to Samawah. and a lower section from Samawah to Qurnali.

From Imam Ibrahim- al-Khalil the land on both sides of the river is cultivated and there are many gardens, walled and unwalled, of dates, oranges, pomegranates and figs. At Musaiyib the river is 180 yards broad and is crossed by a bridge of 24 boats. In the low season the banks^ which here consist of alluvial sand of vary ing fineness with no cohesion, are 8 to 14 feet above the level of the stream, the496 EUPHRATES Name.

In the flood season the river rises 10 feet and the current increases to 4 miles an hour. There is a consider able island in the river about 1| miles above Musaiyib and a similar one ahout 1 mile below: both are suitable places for bridging operations and date timber in plenty is available near the former. In this seetioiij 68 miles in length, the Euphrates flows through a dry but arable country; its bed is broad and open, and the current is ordinarily slight. In the table above reference has not been made to some small canals which tako off on the left bank : they will be mentioned in the para graph on irrigation below. After passing through the town of Musaiyib the Euphrates runs for two miles and then throws off from its right bank the important Husai- niyah canal: just below this point a former loop of the river, called m the Shatt-aVAtiq ^ or Old Eiver, takes its departure on tbe opposite side; this branch is now altogether dry. Three miles below the head of the Husainiyah canal the river reaches a crucial point in its career, and its waters divide into two streams w hich separate at an acute angle; that to the west or right is the great Hindiyah canal ; the other—here known as the Shatt-al-Hillah —is the one which we shall follow, for it is the true Euphrates of the last thousand years, though its stream is now thin and sluggish. About a mile below the bifurcation of the Hindiyah canal and the Euphrates, the Shatt-al-'Atiq already mentioned rejoins the Euphrates from the left: most of the land enclosed between the Euphrates and the Shatt-al-^Atiq now belongs to the Dairat-as-Saniyab.! r (2 EUPHRATES Tte following diagram will help to explain what takes place :~ Scale 1 mile. 497 A=Mu8aiyib.

In the neighbourhood of Diwaniyah the average breadth of t he river bed is 90 to 95 yards, and the deepest part is almost in variably within 10 feet of the steep bank on the outside of a curve. On the lands enclosed by hollow curves of the river much tamarisk grows. The height of the banks] here above the bed, which is alto gether dry in summer, is 13 to 16 feet. The stretch from Diwaniyah to Imam Hamzah (II) is dry in summer, and in that season it is al most deserted by the inhabitants who migrate westwards towards the Hindi- yah canal to find water for their cattle.

Here, as in the immediately preced ing reaches, the river —except in winter- has virtually ceased to flow ; but 5 or 6 miles above Sama- wail its channel is joined by the 'Atshan comiDg from the Bahr-an- Najaf, which gives back to it, so far as not expended or absorbed, the water taken out by the Hindiyah canal above Hillah.

At Samawa.tl there is a boat bridge. Wii In this, as in the first section, some canals have been omitted which are dealt with further on in the paragraph on irrigation. Except in the first 5 ; and again in the last 5 miles of this saction the bed of the Euphrates is for practical purposes dry during a great part of the year; indeed for months in summer it is altogether empty, and even in winter it only carries one thirty-fifth part of the water of the river. The total length of the section, waterless at times with the exception of 10 miles, is about 150 miles. The place of the Euphrates in this part of the country is taken by the Shatt-al -Hindiyah, which opens into the river at both ends and draws off nearly all the water at the head of the reach to restore a portion of it again at the tail. The causes of the supersession of the river by the canal,—a process which does not appear to have been foreseen in 1836 and which may have begun but was not, apparently, far advanced in 1860-65;—are partly natural and partly artificial. The chief factor was probably a gradual rise in the level of the river bed about Hillah by a natural deposition of silt; and examination has shown that in the neighbourhood of Hillah the loss of depth amounts in places to as much as 12 feet. A second influence came into operation with the opening of the Hindiyah canal, by which the volume and velocity of the Euphrates stream were reduced and its scour was diminished. A barrage constructed by the Turkish Govern ment about 1890 at the head of the Hindiy all canal partially remedied the evil for a time; but in July 1903 this work gave way and the injury was aggravated, for the whole Euphrates now began to pour down the Hindiyah. channel. Since this event occurred the silting up of the old Euphrates bed below :the take-ofc of the Hindiyaii has602 EUPHRATES been accelerated by dams or Sukur which the Arabs build in it, especially below Hillall, for the purpose o£ flooding their lands and by the wasteful manner in which they withdraw water from the river, particular ly by means of the Dagharah canal, without returning the surplus. Sand also, carried by the wind from the adjoining desert, is now doing its part in choking up the ancient channel; and in places the accumulations due to this cause have attained a depth of feet. It is interesting to observe that these changes constitute a return to the conditions of 1,000 years ago, when the main stream of the Euphrates flowed—as it has again begun to do—by Kufah, and when the channel on which Hillah Town subsequently grew up was a canal known as the (Suran The move of the Euphrates into the Hillah channel appears to have taken place gradually between the 8th and the 12th centuries a.d.

Comet in her last attempt to ascend the river in recent years. In the swamps above Madinall the depth of water^ as already mentioned; is sometimes only 21 feet. Native Safinahs can ordinarily reach the mouth of the 'Atshan at any seas on, but between July and November they cannot go much further. In March and April, however, the two months of highest river, communication is sail open through Hillall to Musaiyib; but the channel, as we have seen above, is silting up, and unless energetic mea sures are taken it will soon be blocked altogether. Boats now generally reach Mnsaiyib vid the 'Atshan, Bahr-an-Najaf and Shatt-al-Hindiyall thus passing SMnafiyah, Kufah, Kifl and Tawairij on the way instead of Imam Hamzah (11)^ Diwaniyah. and Hillall. The result is thus a diversion rather than a closing of communication, and the loss other than agricultural which is caused by the change is more to a few old towns and some villages than to the country at largeit is obvious however that neither of the rival waterways is as satisfactory as it would be if the other did not exist, and the damage to vested interests by the transferences 606 EUPHRATES of business from one line to the other is in some cases very great. It Is believed that by efficient repairs to the Hindiyah. barrage, before it is too late, a minimum depth of 4 feet could even now be secured in the whole lower course of the Euphrates. The depth of the Euphrates is variable and appears to have decreased generally throughout its course, and not only in the section from Musaiyib to Samawah, since the survey of 1836; but above the head of the Shatt-al-Hindiyall there are still soundings of 30 feet in places where the stream is confined. Navigation depends largely on wind, and when both wind and current are adverse progress becomes almost impossible. In the absence of wind and with an average current a native boat can drop down stream at the rate of about 4 miles an hour: the current in the wide reaches above Musaiyib is only about 3 miles an hour even in time of flood, but there are places where it reaches a velocity of 8 or 9 miles. The influence of the sea tides is felt as far up as Durraji. Even if physical obstacles to navigation did nofc exist it is improbable that a steamer service on the Euphrates would be remunerative in the present circumstances of the country ; for Turkish 'Iraq, in its undeve loped condition^ cannot support more than one large centre of trade and one line of communication, and these it possesses already in Baghdad City and the Tigris river. Moreover, the imports which would follow the Euphrates line are neither so heavy nor so bulky as to demand steam carriage ; and the most considerable export is grain which must be picked up from point to point,—a task that steamers cannot profitably perform. Irrigation .—The Euphrates from Falluj ah to Diwaniyah is a river well calculated to serve as a source of perennial irrigation upon a large scale, and the fact is one which during long ages received a full and prac tical recognition. The canals to which Mesopotamia owed its prosperity and importance in ancient times mostly tapped the Euphrates on its left bank between the two places mentioned and after traversing Mesopotamia at this &gt; its narrowest part, flowed with open mouths into the Tigris; in this way, besides watering the fertile country through which they passed, they afforded a means of communication by boat between the two great rivers. The remains of these canals are still the dominant feature of the landscape^ and huge piles of silt-clearance, resembling railway embank' ments, cross the otherwise featureless desert in every direction and intersect at many angles. Some of the old canals are yet in operation on a greatly reduced scale and irrigate perhaps a hundredth part of the area which was formerly served.JSUPHRATES The maximum discharge of the Euphrates at Musaiyib is 2^500 to S^OOO cubic metres per second and the minimum discharge about 300. The mean velocity of the river at a typical place in the same neighbourhood was *85 metres per second on the 5th January 1905; giving by calculation a maximum flood velocity of 1*33 and a minimum low-water velocity of *66 metres per second. The average fall of the river is about 1 in 13,000, or much the same as that of the Nile, to which in the reaches between Fallujah and Mussaiyib it is said to bear a striking resemblance. In the latitude of Baghdad the average level of the Euphrates is about 20 feet above the average level of the Tigris, so that the Tigris at its highest is exactly on a level, its maximum rise being 6| metres, with the Euphrates at its lowest in the corresponding stage of its course. The Euphrates runs in a shallower and more open bed than the Tigris, and having a more constant stream it is the more suitable for irrigation. To the east of Baghdad the lowness of the left bank of the Euphrates is a serious but remediable defect; when it rises it lets loose destructive floods which sometimes sweep across Mesopotamia almost to the Tigris, and one of the first steps in the reclamation of Mesopotamia would be the prevention of such occurrences. Between Pallujah and Khan Maqdam attempts have already been made to confine tbe river by means of earth embank ments about 8 feet high and 30 feet wide which are revetted on the side towards the stream. The river is at its highest in April and at its lowest in September; the following diagram will explain the character of its ordinary rise and fall:— Height in metres above lowest level. 1 2 3 3| 3| 2| 2 1 0 | 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 4 3 2 1 V Xj / --- \| \ January.

November, | December.508 EUPHRATES The rise in spring is due to the melting o£ the winter snows in Armenia, and the sudden rise in November followed by a temporary decrease m December and January is attributable to the autumn rains, of which the elect is suddenly checked by winter frosts. The maximum annua] rise of the Euphrates, which does not last long enough to appear in our diagram, is about 5 metres. If the restoration of irrigation in Mesopotamia were to be seriously Undertaken the operations would probably be begun on the part of the Euphrates between Fallujah and Diwaniyali; some of the more important existing canals in this quarter consequently must be noticed here. The first of these is the Saqlawiyah which used to take out some 8 miles above Fallujah and, passing to the north of the ruins of ^Aqar Nimrud formed an extensive lake on the west side of Kadhimain Town and then entered the Tigris about 5 miles below Baghdad. In July 1838 the British surveying steamer Euphrates passed through this canal and met with no soundings of less than 6 feet; but since then the canal has been closed, on account of the floods which it assisted on their way towards Baghdad. The upper end is now blocked by wheat fields, while the lower is filled for a short distance by a back-flow from the Tigris, and forms a creek, known as the Khar j L j which is spanned by an iron bridge at a short distance from Baghdad on the route to Musaiyib. The following is a list of the existing canals from Fallujah to Hillah with their discharges as registered on the 3rd January 1905 when the Euphrates at Fallujah was H metres above its lowest level and was itself discharging 700 cubic metres per second;— Dischafge on Si'd Name and description of canal. inTuTic^tres per second. 1.

All the canals in the list above are on the left bank of the Euphrates and, with the exception of the Radhwamyah, the Mahawil and the Khatunlyah^ they are the property of the Dairat-as-Saniyah. The Abu Ghuraib has a good regulating-head of masonry^, consisting- of two spans each 2^ metres wide and probably identical with the bridge described above ; but the regulators of the remainder are indifferent. As will be seen, the aggregate discharge of these canals with a rather low fiver is510 EUPHRATES only 16 cubic metres a second; this might rise in time of flood to about 200 cubic metres per second, but the result would be flooding, owing to imperfect subsidiary arrangements, of the whole country ; and cultivators in the present state of affairs prefer not to irrigate their lands at all when the river is high. The silt in these small canals is heavy, and there are symptoms that clearance is not keeping pace with deposit and that the canals are gradually deteriorating. The large Husaimyall canal and Shatt-at -Hindiyah on the right bank, whose heads are 2 and 5 miles respectively below Musaiyib, form the subjects of special articles; and the small canals on both banks between Hillah. and the head of the Dagharah, being described in the article on the Hillah Qadha, do not call for notice here, except the Tajiyah which takes out just above Hillah and the Jarbu'iyah, an important asset of the Dairat-as-Saniyah, about half way from Hillah. to the head of the Dagharah. , both of which are on the right bank. The Dagharah itself, on the left bank, is separately dealt with elsewhere. It only remains to mention the Abul Fadhal a canal thrown off by the Euphrates from its left bank some 2 miles above Diwaniyah. and swallowed up in the marshes to the south-east- m wards which contain the village of Fawwar ))y distant about 30 miles from Diwaniyali. FADHUL A considerable Arab tribe of Southern Najd, not apparently found anywhere elsewhere.

Those of Majma , belong to sections called Fadhl and Kathir and those of Hautah town to sections styled Al Talib j5 and Kathran while the Fadhul of 'Amar and Raudhah are said to be of a Shaikhly section known as Mughairah . The Kathir and Kathra sections are probably identical. The origin of the Fadhul is forgotten, but a vague tradition connects them with the Bani Lam.FAID 511 A coast village in the 'Adan district of the Kuwait Principality, 21 miles south-south-east of Kuwait Town. It consists of about 50 houses and has 20 wells of good water about 18 feet deep. There are 200 well-grown date palms and some cultivation of wheat, barley and melons, irrigated from the wells. The inhabitants, who belong to various Arab tribes, own some flocks of sheep and goats. As mentioned in the article on 'Adail, Fahaihil is a resort at certain seasons for townsmen of Kuwait, FAHAIHIL or PAHAHIL An island seven miles north-west of Masqat Town and two miles from the nearest point on the 'Oman coast. It is 280 feet high and precipitous, with overhanging cliffs all round except at the south-west corner where the only landing place is. Fahal is one-third of a mile in length from north to south, is light-coloured, and has deep water all round. It was known to the Portuguese as ' the Isle of Victory ' on account of a naval success which they gained near it over the Turks. FAHAL* A large and scattered village in Jabal Shammar proper, about FAID 45 miles south-east by east of Hail on the route to Buraidah. It jjj stands on high ground to the west of a Wadi called Abal Krush ^ &gt; 2 miles to the south-west of the place is Jabal Qafail a hill 200 feet high. The soil is sand, 15 to 30 feet deep, with a stratum of 6 feet of very hard black basalt beneath. The quarters of Faid and their date groves are spread over a space 2 to 3 miles in extent: the quarters are, besides that specifically called Faid Ol which contains 40 houses,—^Ain , Ghazaiziyah &gt; Hamrah Hadhaifan , Marjum pe-j* , Najib , Qalaiyib &gt; Shajarah (Abu) , and Sinaiyan cW** . The population, who may number 1,000 souls, are partly Bani Tamim and partly Shammar. Cereals, vegetables and melons are grown. Water is at 6 to 9 fathoms, and the best well is in Marjum. In ancient times Faid was a large and famous • A view of Fahal from the sea l 56 found in Chart No. 2373—2837 - A.faid 512 place and a station on the pilgrim route from Kufah to Makkah. There are some ruins on a black lava hill called Kharash , 600 yards south of 'Ain. To British mariners formerly known as ' Pheleechi,' from the local pronunciation which is Failachah. An island^ 7 miles in length with a maximum breadth of 3 miles, lying on the north side of the entrance to Kuwait Bay : its western end, the nearest to Kuwait Town, is about 10 miles east-north-east of Ras-al-Ardh, while its northern end is about 7 miles south-east of the mouth of Khor-as -Sabiyah. Fhysical characteristics and surroundings. —The shape of Failakah is that of a badly-shaped wedge, having its point to the south-east and its base to the north-west. The island stands on an extensive flat of mud and sand with rocky patches, which is called Dharuh and stretches south-eastwards from the entrance of Khor-as- Sabiyah. Failakah is low, the highest point being a mound 30 feet high in the westernmost part; at high spring tides it is broken in upon by the sea, and, not being visible more than 6 or 8 miles, it is frequently not sighted in entering Kuwait Bay. Failakah has two out liers, 'Auhah titjs. } a small sandy islet about 3 miles from its south- eastern extremity at the place where the Dharub flat - comes to an end ; and Mashjan , a low sandy islet on the flat about 2 miles from Failakah in the direction of Khor-as -Sabiyah. Inhabit ants of the population of Failakah vary; but there appear to be about 200 men or, say, 500 souls altogether. There, is now only one village, Zor , on the north-west coast facing Mashjan; a Niqa ah or boat-harbour, difficult of entrance, is situated on the shore uhree-quarters of a mile to the north-east of the village. Landing at Zoi is easy. The place possesses some 70 or 80 ordinary boats, smaller on the average than the boats of Kuwait Town, and over 20 Wahriyahs or fishing-boats built oi Jar ids or date-branches. There are several deserted villages on the island. One of these, named Subaihiyah , situated Qn t}le western shore nearer to the southern than to the northernFAILAKAH ISLAND 513 end of the island. It is marked by a gronp of 90 snperannnated palms, perforated by insects. Close to Zor, beyond its boat-harbour, is the deserted site of Sa^idi ; about a mile further is a similar place called Dasht ; finally, in this direction, we reach Qraimyah where Jabir, the eldest son of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, has built himself a house : this is now, except Zor, the only inhabited place on the island. The people of Zor, mostly fishermen but a few of them pearl divers, are of mixed origin; the majority are said to have come from the island of Kharag^ but others are from Fao, the Hindiyan District and even ^Oman. They are civil and well-disposed, but superstitious and fanciful, and their condition generally is wretched. Indeed the aspect of the island from every point of view is one of melancholy but gentle decay. Water supply. —Water is found in most parts of the island at a depth of only 6 feet: it is said to be better than the water of Kuwait Town and to be less brackish near the sea than it is at some distance inland. In the hot weather it turns so salt in some places as to kill lucerne. Fisheries and agriculture. —The resources of Failakah are fisheries and agriculture on a modest scale. After deduction of Makalah aJ / U ® ^ or the food expenses of the crew, the catch of fish is divided into equal shares, of which one goes to the Shaikh of the island, one to the owner of the boat, one to the Captain, and one to each of the crew. Wheat and barley are grown with some success on clayey patches. About 6,000 lbs. of wheat are said to be sown annually in the whole island, and the total yield of grain is about 80 tons. The produce after deduction of taxes, when taxes are paid, is divided equally between the cultivators on the one hand and the suppliers of seed, plough-animals and food for the animals on the other : the crop is sown in October and reaped in April. Melons are grown, also lucerne and some of the ordinary vegetables such as onions, carrots and radishes. There are a few rose trees and some dates ; but the latter, which are chiefly towards the south end of the island, are not in a flourishing condition, and the agriculture of Failakah generally is inferior to that of Jahrah. The514 FAILAKAH ISLAND Sidar or ber and the tamarisk are the principal trees other than dates, but hardy as they are they do ixot grow without attention. Domestic and other auimals. —Failakah boasts a dozen camels, a nuniber of donkeys^ a few flocks and herds, and some poultry. Flamingos, pelicans, gulls and flocks of a bird resembling the curlew haunt the shore, and the island is said to be visited in the hot weather by large flocks of sand-grouse. There are a number of gazelles, descended from a pair which a member of the Shaikh of Kuwait's family turned loose some years ago only relations of the chief are permitted to shoot them. Administration. —Failakahis governed (1904) on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait, to whom it belongs, by one of his relations. This indivi dual, Sa'ud Qalatah, who is a man of about 35 with some negro blood and partially paralysed in his lower limbs, succeeded his father in the governorship. About one-third of the arable land on Pailakah is held Mu'af or revenue-free: the remainder pays Zakat to the Shaikh of Kuwait at the rate of one-tenth of gross produce, besides which the Shaikh takes for himself all the straw of the island, even on revenue^ free holdings, except a small quantity that the inhabitants are allowed to retain for their own necessities. The Shaikh has declined to allow rich merchants of Kuwait or foreigners to settle in Pailakah on the ground that they would probably oppress the original inhabitants. Sacred places. —Eailakah is remarkable chiefly for its tombs and shrines. First, there are the graves of the Auliya or Saints, who play a large part in the traditions of the island ; of these some 60 or 70 are scattered round the village of Zor. Then, about a mile to the south of Zor, there are the tombs of Sa'ad , Sa^id . and Sa^idah ; that of Sa'ad is to the east of the others, and the whole group stand up conspicuously as Failakah is approached in a boat from Kuwait. It is principally to visit these tombs, said to commemorate two brothers and a sister who were murdered here, that pilgrims from Yaman and India, and more frequently from Afghanistan and Baluchistan, visit Failakah. There is another tomb, also possessing virtue and visited by pilgrims; it is said to be that of a certain Muhammad-al-Badawi, whose only claim to distinction is that his finger after death resisted the removal of his signet ring. Lastly, there is the Muqam-al- Khidhaiy^l which overlooks the boat harbour of Zor, and is now a roofless tower threatened by the encroachments of the sea. Persians do not resort to itFAILlYEH 515 but it is frequented by Arab sailors tvIio come to perform their vows, made in sickness or in danger at sea, by sacrificing a sheep or a goat, by burning incense and by feeding the poor. The tutelary spirit is probably the same Khidhar who has a shrine on 'Abbadan island; in Failakah. however, his reputation is chiefly as a patron saint of mariners. The shrine of Khidhar is not so much visited by foreign pilgrims as those mentioned before it. traditions. —Qrainiyah is said to have been the seat of a tyrant who wore golden boots ; his city was destroyed by God because he cut a child in half to prove the temper of his sword. There is a local tradition, supported by traces of good stone houses in the middle of the island, that the Portuguese once occupied the place. They are said to have been driven, first from Dasht and then from the centre of the island to which they retired, by a plague of rats sent upon them by the Auliya. A village in the Mnhammareh. District of Southern 'Arabistan; it FAILIYEH is situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab, 3 miles above Muham- mar eh Town, between the Shatt-al-'Arab and the right bank of the Abu Jidi^ canal. It consists of about 800 brick, mud, and reed houses, with 12 or 15 general shops and two coffee shops : the inhabitants are Muhaisin and mixed Arabs, Baluchis, and negroes, Failiyeh is the head quarters of the Shaikh of Muhammarelr's administration; here are the offices of his Government, and here is quartered his -mercenary force of about 400 armed Arabs and Balucllis. A small quay of date logs occupies the angle between the river and the canal, and about a mile up the Abu Jidi' is a small dock in which the Shaikhs steamers are repaired. The Shaikh has at Failiyeh about 20 brass and iron muzzle-loading guns, and his saluting battery stands just below the entrance to the canal: below the battery is an orchard and young date grove. Failiyeh is connected with Muhammareh. Town by a private telephone belonging to the Shaikh. The principal buildings are two palaces which are still occupied by part of the household of the Shaikh, but Khaz^al Khan now resides in an impos- ing new mansion called Qasr Khaz^aliyeh, three-quarters of a mile further up the bank of the Shatt-'al-Arab ; his Persian wife, the Jamil-as- 2 L ?616 FAILlYEH Saltaneh, also has her abode there. Failiyeh was founded about 1860 by Haji Jabir, the first great Shaikh of the Muhaisin. FAKKAN* A coast village in the centre of the Shamailiyall tract in Trucial (KHOR) 'Oman, about 23 miles north of Khor Kalba and 20 miles south-soutli- east of Dibah. Khor Fakkan stands on the southern shore of a sandy bay two miles wide ; one mile deep and open to :the north-east: the bay has a perfectly sheltered boat harbour at its east end and just outside its eastern point is an island 240 feet high known as Sirat-al- Khor ;^I . The water supply of the village is good and the date plantations contain about 5,000 trees; fish, vegetables; cattle and poultry are procurable. There are about 150 houses of Naqbiyin and Arabi- cised Persians; and the population may amount to 800 souls. The people live by their dates; by cultivation of wheat and by pearl diving; they own four or five coasting vessels which run to Masqat Town and to places in the Persian Gulf. There are seven shops. The place is at present held in fief by Sa J id-bin-Ahmad, a first cousin once removed of the present Shaikh of Sharjah. One of the quarters or suburbs of Khor Fakkan is called Hiyawah. FALAIJ A valley in the Eastern Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate, (WADI) through which runs the main line of communication between the coast at Sur and the inland districts of Ja ? alan and Sharqiyah; its direction is south-south-west and north-north-east; and it reaches the sea slightly to the west of Su. Wadi Fisao jUi, the principal tributary of Wadi Falaij, rises on the eastern side of a pass in Jabal KhamiS about 20 miles south-south-east of Sur, and about 1 mile below the pass opens out into a stony plain called Ma'qal which is surrounded by hills and ravines and in which are some of the coal exposures referred to in the article on Jabal Khamis. Bedouin encampments are sometimes found in this vicinity. About eight miles below Ma'qal, Wadi Fisao joins Wadi Falaij, of which the upper portion has not been described by any European traveller, fiom the right bank. In the foot-hills of Jabal KhamiS, to the east or noith east of this junction; is a Masharifah village, of a bout 60 houses, ca lled^ • A plan of the Khor Fakkin Bay will be found iu Chart ^o, 2§7c 2837 -A.^ALAIJ (WADI) 617 Ghassah ; which is distinguished by a tower and is said to possess 20 camels, 20 donkeys, 30 cattle, 600 sheep and goats and 800 palms; and in the bed of the Wadi itself, below the junction, is the oasis of Falaij with date palms, oleanders and other trees, good and ample water, abundant camel-grazing and evidences of former cultivation extending for about a mile : Bedouins belonging to the Masharifah or to the Rawajih section of the Bani Bu Hasan frequently encamp here, but there are no permanent habitations. Four and-a-half miles below the oasis of Falaij, on the right bank of the Wadi, is the tower of Rafsah ; it is said to have been built by an Imam of 'Oman to resist the incursions of the Wahhabis, but it is now in the hands of the Masharifah tribe who oblige all caravans using this route to pass through a square gate-house 100 yards from the tower and pay toll, in considera tion of which they do not plunder them. The tower itself is a quaint erection 50 feet high by 80 feet in diameter and it completely commands the passage up the Wadi, which at this point is narrow. On the left bank of the Wadi, opposite the tower, are cave-dwellings containing some eight or ten families of Masharifah, who possess 3 camels, 40 donkeys^ 8 cattle and 200 goats. This is the frontier village of the tribe in the direction of Stir. About two miles below Rafsah, Wadi Ealaij is joined from the west by a ravine with conspicuous yellow sandstone cliffs, two or three miles up which lies the Masharifah village of Mislaq The people of Mislaq are wood cutters and carriers; they own 8 camels^ 16 donkeys, 12 cattle and 200 sheep and goats* One mile further on Wadi Falaij debouches from the hills and, leaving Suq Sur on its right bank, tends north-eastwards to the coast. The total fixed population of the valley and its affluents appears to be only about 500 souls. The valley of Wadi Falaij varies greatly in breadth : at Rafsah it is only a few hundred yards broad, while further up it exceeds two miles } the actual bed of the Wadi is generally 200 to 300 yards across and is enclosed between banks 20 or 30 feet high. From the oasis of Falaij downwards the Wadi contains a limpid, running stream, which has frequently to be crossed in ascending or descending the valley and is in places two feet deep. The road generally runs in the bed of the stream, but at Rafsah it ascends to the level of the Ma&amp;harifah tower by a steep z igzag path.518 JTALLAHlYEH DISTRICT PALL A- TIib most central of the districts of Southern 'Arabistanj having on HIYEH the south-west and west the district of Muhammarehj on the north the aIJu district of Ahwaz, on the north-east the Jarrahi District, on the sontk- DISTKICT east Ma'shur and the territory connected with it, and on the south Khor Musa and the open sea. Boiindaries.—~ r Th.Q hoxdiQY of the district apparently begins on the sea at the mouth of Khor Silaik and follows that creek, and subsequently the Khuwairin branch of Khor Qanaqah with which Khor Silaik is virtually connected, to the ruins of Qubban. Prom Qubban onwards the boundary seems to be the Salmanlyeh canal until some marshes near the bank of the Karun river are reached; these it skirts, running more to northwards than before, and passes in succession by Maqtu'' and ^Ataishi , at the latter of which there is a ruined tomb, to a locality named Khuwaiseh where there is some rising ground, Be yond Khuwaiseh the line turns eastwards and arrives by way of Qusaibeh where again there is some elevated land, at the right bank of the Jarrahi River immediately below the village of Qarqar. Crossing the river it continues at first in a south-easterly, and then in a southerly direc tion; passes by 'Aquleh, a spot 8 miles west of Ma'shur; and finally reaches the bank of Khov Musa at or near the point where that inlet breaks up into the two Khors of Doraq and Ma'shur. From this point back to the mouth of Khor Silaik the boundary is at first Khor Musa and then the Persian Gulf. Physical geography, climate and natural The Fallahijeh district consists of the country traversed by the Jarrahi River in the lower one-third of its course. From the point where it enters the dis trict, immediately below Qarqar, down to Khazineh, where its stream is finally broken up a little above Fallahiyeh Towjn, the Jarrahi is bordered on both banks by a belt of canal-irrigated cultivation. Outside this cultivated belt are, at the eastern end of the district, flat alluvial plains which stretch to the horizon and are waterless except after rain j and this dry and nearly desert portion of the district reaches, on the south side of the Jarralli, about as far west as Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan, near which it is terminated by an extension southwards, known as Shatut, of the irrigated tract connected with the river. On the north of the J arrahi, on the borders of the Ahwaz District, there are large swamps both to the west and to the east of Gharaibeh; of these the former is probably fed by the spill of the Malih and the latter by thecopyright. A Canal in the Faliahiyeh District.FALLAHlYEH DISTRICT 519 surplus waters of the Gupal, both streams of the Ahwaz District, as well as by the overflow of the Jarrahi which they adjoin. The Fallahiyeh-Marid canal ; a continuation of the Jarrahi River, traverses Hors or swamps which extend to an uncertain distance on either side of it. The large tract between Khor Qanaqeh and Khor Doraq is as yet unex plored ; but the north-eastern bank of Khor Doraq is known to be marshy throughout almost its entire length, and is practically unapproachable except at one point near Imamzadeh 'Abdul Hasan. In the damp parts of the district the heat of summer is almost intolerable, and mosquitoes abound to such an extent that even natives of the country take refuge inside nets immediately before sunset and eat their evening meal there. From June to September military operations would be practically impossible for climatic reasons. In the drier parts of the district tamarisk, dwarf tamarisk and camel- thorn are seen, especially on the banks of hollows. Other naturally growing plants are Qaqilah, ^Ausaj, Rimth and a kind of Salsola from which Shinan or herb-potash is obtained by burning. Inhabitants, —The population of th^ district is almost entirely of the Ka'ab tribe and therefore Shi''ah by religion; the people, though their houses are not solidly constructed, form fixed agricultural communities and should perhaps be regarded as settled. If this view be taken, the district has no considerable Bedouin population. The following is a rough estimate of the number of souls in the district : — Fallahiyeh Town 2,000 Buziyeh 8,000 Jarrahi settlements (see next paragraph) .... 28,000 Janjireh settlements 4,500 Shatut settlements ,..•••• 2,500 Total souls 45,000 In the two towns first mentioned Ka'ab are a majority of the population, but intermixed with them are some Persians, some Arabs from Kuwait, and some Sabians; in the Jarrahi settlements the people are all Ka'ab except 1,000 persons, or fewer, who are Saiyids or belong to various Arab tribes; the Janjireh and Shatut tracts are in the exclusive possession of the Ka'ab. Among the non -Ka^ab residents near the Jarrahi are some Bani Turuf, settled by the Shaikh of Muhammareh on the Ehaz'ali canal, and a few 'Anafijeh of the Simairat section on the Shabaisheh canal, to whom may be added the Bait Iblal (about 150 souls) at Khuwainis and Khamis and the Ma'awiyeh (some 70 persons) at Madinat-al-Mumin : both of the last named tribes are here dependent on520 FALLAHlYEH DISTRICT the Ka^ab. Even in this, their principal district, the black turban which used to be distinctive of the Ka'ab has been generally discarded for the Arab kerchief and fillet : headmen, however, still wear the old-fashioned head dress. Houses are sometimes of mud and sometimes of matting and reeds : they have g-enerally sloping thatched roofs. The mud brick is here of the same pattern as in the Jarrahi District. Canals, settlements and general topography. —Most of the villages of the district are settlements situated upon canals from the Jarrahi Eiver and known by the same names as the canals. The canal system conse quently furnishes the key to the topography of the district, and in the table below an attempt is made to explain it ; but two tracts or groups of dis tributaries which are of special importance have been reserved for separate description elsewhere under the names Janjireh. and Shatut. The remaining canals are given below in the order in which they occur descending the Jarrahi :— in Name of canal.

Rice, wheat and barley as well as dates are cultivated on a considerable scale^ not only on the canals but also beside sheets of standing 4 water which occur here and there. The gardens in the villages contain garlic and beans. Sheep and goats are plentiful^ and numerous herds of cattle are to be seen, besides buffaloes in the marshy tracts : some of the last are brought into the district, at particular seasons only, by migratory Ma'adan. Horses and donkeys are also owned, but in smaller numbers. The chief exports of the Fallahiyeh district are dates, rice, wheat, barley, wool, ghi, hides, palm leaves, matting for roofs, date wood for fuel, melons, garlic and other vegetables : to these may be added the skins and feathers of the Baiyudhi (probably an egret) and of other birds which are found in the marshes. The dates are chiefly disposed of to sailing vessels from the Gulf, but some go to Ram HZ ; Kuwait is the destination of most of the rice ; the greater part of the wheat and barley is purchased and fetched away by visitors from Kuwait, Bushehr, Bahrain and Masqat \ the remaining articles go to Muhaminareh. Imports are piece-goods, through Muhammareh, and spices, coffee, tea, sugar and metals from Kuwait. Buziyeh is the only port situated in the district and the greater part of the foreign trade is carried on there : but some, as we have seen, passes through Muhammareh Town. Light Abas for summer wear are the sole manufacture of Fallahiyeh district. The Fallahiyeh or Doraq Man is equal to about 248 lbs. avoirdupois English, and it is considered to be equivalent to ] 6 Shushtar Mans it is divided into 12 WaqTyahs of 20 lbs. each. Half a Fallahiyeh Man is called a Qusarah and 10 Fallahiyeh Mans make a Karat-ad- Doraq. There are two units of lineal measure, a Dhara' or Zar', which is equal to 9/10 of an English yard, and the ordinary Gaz-i-Shah.

The drier tracts can be traversed in any direction without impediment except such as may arise from scarcity of water, forage, and fuel. In the moister regione progress is more difficult; but even there, in places, there are winding paths practicable for laden animals. Of this last kind are some tracks which lead westward from Buziyeh and Fallahiyeh Town, between the marshes, to the left bank of the Karun. 2 m 2532 FALLAHlYEH DISTRICT No statistics of animal transport are available, and there is no more exact information concerning supplies than that contained in the para graph above upon agriculture. Canals being numerous, water is not ordinarily a difficulty in the inhabited parts of the district. It has been pointed out that the first step in a military occupation of Fallahiyeh would probably be to seize a position near Janjireli commanding the irrigation of the district; this would prevent the inhabitants from resorting to their traditional tactics of flooding the country to embarrass an enemy, and by manipulation of the water supply combined with a blockade they could probably be brought to submission. Water communications and transport. —The oversea communications of the district depend on the port of Buziyeh and the Khor Musa inlet, and information regarding them will be found in the articles under those names. The main artery of internal communication by water is the JarraM River, which boats of considerable size can navigate to the uppermost limit of the Fallahiyeh district, and even beyond it. The JarraM is not connected by a navigable channel with Khor Musa or any of its branches; but it is prolonged to the Karun, which it enters at the Marid creek, by the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal, locally called Shakheh aIU . This canal passes through the middle of Fallahiyeli Town, 4 miles below which it emerges from the date groves and enters the open grassy desert ; its direction is at first somewhat south-westerly, but the southing disappears as the Karun is approached. For a number of miles after the date groves of Fallahiyeh Town are left behind, the canal is only a ditch 6 to 8 feet wide with a depth of to 2 feet, and its small capacity in this part makes it impracticable for boats of over 5 tons; but it could probably be improved without much difficulty, and even in its present neglected condition it is the principal means of communication between the towns of FallaMyeli and Muhammareh. At 10 miles pt; from the Karun the Shakheh begins to feel the influence of the sea I it ll tides, and its channel becomes wider and deeper. The whole length of [ N| the canal from Khazineh, where the Jarrahi River ends, to Marid has | % been computed by a traveller at 37 miles ; but this appears to be an over- lil estimate, easily explicable by the slowness of the journey* Mosquitoes % are said to render the passage of the canal almost impossible at certain times of the year. • Rescript ions of this canal by Major E. B. Burton will be found in the GovernmeiJ of India's Proceedings in the Foreign Department for Jujie and July 190^FALLAHIYEH DISTRICT tez Very few boats are owned by the riverside villages on the Jarrahi, yet there is said to be no lack of small craft when occasion demands ; none of them however can carry more than 60 Fallahiyeh Mans or about 7 tons English. About 800 Ballams are said to have their headquarters at Fallahiyeh Town and to ply chiefly on the section of the river between that place and Gharaibeh which, being situated on a route to Shushtar, is a sort of river port. Between Gharaibeh and Fallahiyeh Town goods are carried entirely by water. The local boats work upon the upper reaches of the river as well ; and also in the opposite direction from Fallahiyell Town to Muhammareh ; and large numbers of small craft from Muhammareh visit Fallahiyeh Town and even ascend the Jarrahi for some distance, principally in the date season. There is a uniform rate of freight for all places on the Jarrahi irrespective of distance: it varies from 1 to 2 Qrans per Eallahiyeh Man, Goods are forwarded from Shushtar to Fallahiyeh Town by land and water at a through rate of 15 to 20 Tumans per 100 Shushtar Mans. Administration. —The district, which now forms part of the terrp tories of the Shaikh of Muhammareh, its revenues being held by him in farm, is administered by two Shaikhs of the Ka'ab tribe who are answerable to him and are jointly responsible with him to the Persian Government. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is represented personally by an agent at Fallahiyeh Town. Criminal cases in the district are tried by the ecclesiastical authorities, and their sentences are carried out under the orders of the senior of the two local chiefs. The principal taxes are those on agriculture. The date crop pays 33 Qrans per Kareh; and of rice half the produce in kind is invariably demanded. Lands cultivated with wheat or barley are subject to a fixed cash assessment of 12 Qrans per Paddan and a share of the crop is also taken: on the Jarrahi below the Safreh canal this share is J, and above that canal I*, of the total yield. There is also a shop tax at the rate of 3 Qrans a month on every shop. The revenue derived from these sources is assigned to the Shaikh of Muhammareh in compensa tion for the loss of the Muhammareh customs which he formerly hekh The annual value of the collections has been estimated at 4^500 TiimanB &gt; and one report places it at 6,000 Tumans. The only institutions in Fallahiyeh belonging to the central Persian Government are a customs house and post office at Buziyeh and a post office at Faliahiyeh.534 FALLAHlYBH TOWN FALLA- HIYEH w w TOWN The chief town of the district of the same name in Southern 'Arabistan and the capital of the Ka'ab tribe. It stands almost buried from view by date groves, on both banks of the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal about 3 miles below Khazineh^ the place where the Jarrahi River ends and the canal begins : by the time it has reached tlie lower end of Fallahiyeh town the canal has parted with most of its water, and a few miles further on the date groves cease. The part of the town on the left bank is surrounded on three sides by a dilapidated stone wall which encloses, as well as houses, a large area of marsh : in the circum^ stances it is not surprising that Fallahiyeh should be reckoned the most unhealthy town of ? Arabistan. Among the diseases prevalent are ulcers, caries bone, rheumatism and ophthalmia. About 250 mud houses and 130 shops compose the bulk of the town : there is only one important mosque. In one place, on the left bank of the canal, there are several brick houses of considerable size, the largest of which, now empty, formerly belonged to Ja'far, a Shaikh of the Ka'ab. The people are mostly Ka'ab of the Khanafireh division, and a reference to the article under that name will show some of the sections to which they belong ; in number they may be about 2,000 souls. Movement is chiefly by water, and the town possesses many Ballams : Mahailahs also come up from Muhammareh by the Fallahiyeh canal, and there is a good water way conducting from Fallahiyeh to Buziyeh via Khazineh and the Buziyeh canal. The town lands produce abundant dates and rice; but trade is slack, and the bazaar is generally closed at noon from lack of business. During the last 8 or 9 years the power of the Shaikh of Muhammareh has become absolute at Fallahiyeh, which he now administers through a member of the ruling family of the Ka'ab. In the matter of customs Fallahiyeh town is within the jurisdiction of the post at Buziyeh, bnt there is a separate post office. FALL IJ J AH A village in Turkish ^Iraq, on the left bank of the Euphrates, nearly 70 miles by water above the town of Musaiyib; it is surrounded by cultivation, but there are not many dates. The Abu Ghuraib canal still takes of from the Euphrates about 4 miles below Fallujah, and the Saqlawiyah used to take off about 8 miles above it: both are noticed in the article on the river. At Fallujah the Euphrates 1S spanned by a boat bridge, 227 yards long, carrying a roadway 10 feet in2gf; Flo 585 width; the bridge is divided into 2 parts by an island and consists alto gether of 25 boats ; each of which is 30 feet long ; 11 feet broad and 5 feet deep : this bridge is at present in poor repair and has practically no handrail. The inhabitants number about 600 souls : their houses are built of sun-dried bricks. An isolated house ; the property of Kazim Pasha^ brother-in-law of the present Sultan of Turkey and political detenu at Baghdad, stands on the right back of the Euphrates opposite to Eallujah, near the further end of the bridge. In Fallujah village proper are a mosque^ two or three Khans^ and a bazaar of about 30 shops. There is also a Sarai or Government buildings for Fallujah is the headquarters of a Nahiyah similarly named in the Qadha of Dilaim and is con sequently the seat of a Mudir. The place is on the Baghdad-Aleppo telegraph line &gt; being the station intermediate between the offices at Kadhimain Town and Rumadiyah: the connection is double in either direction. A coast village in the 'Adau district of the Kuwait Principality, FANTAS 16 miles south-south-east of Kuwait Town. It contains about 100 houses j the inhabitants belong to the mixed Arab tribes which are found in Kuwait Town. There are about 30 wells ; some are brackish, but others contain good water at a depth of 20 feet. The wells have openings 20 feet square, and three gangs of donkeys can work at one simultaneously. Cultivation consists of barley, lucerne, melons, radishes and onions, and is richer than at Jahrah, though the area cultivated is smaller. The village has 300 date palms and many Sidar or ber trees. As mentioned in the article on 'AdaB, it is to some extent aj country resort for townsmen of Kuwait* This name, which as used by Europeans refers only to the well-known FAO* telegraph station near the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arabj denotes properly 5 ^ the whole of a cultivated tract or estate extending along the right bank duf hoTiiy.- Mo^t of the infoTmation contained m this article is derived from an elaborate report by Mr. W.

Fao.5S6 FAO of the river from the sea upwards to a distance of 8 miles; the telegraph station is situated above the middle of this tract at about 5 miles from the sea. By the Turks the name lao is also applied to a whole Qadha in the Basrah Wilayat of which the administrative headquarters are at Eao. Boundaries of the Udo tract. —The Fao tract is enclosed on its north eastern side by the waters of the Shatt-al -'Arab and is bordered upon the south-west by the open desert; its breadth between the two varies from 5 of a mile to | of a mile and is generally greater in its lower thau in its upper reaches. At its upper end Fao is divided from Ma^amir, the next tract above it, by a creek known as Hadd or Musa, and its length thence to the sea is, as already stated^ about 8 miles. Character, topography and population of the Fao tract. —The tract consists of a narrow strp of clayey soil adjoining the bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab. Everywhere it is cut across at right angles by irrigation creeks from the river ; these creeks form a continuous series from one end of the tract to the other and are on the average less than \ of a mile apart; on each is situated a small hamlet bearing the same name as the creek.

A civil station^ containing the Fao telegraph office, is situated be tween the adjacent creeks of Haji ^Abdullah and Haji Eashid and a fort between the creeks Bu Saiyid and Mulla Isa : there are thus 22 creeks in Eao above the civil station, 21 between it and the fort, and 6 below the fort. From the above table it will be apparent that the fixed population of Fao, exclusive of the civil station and fort which are dealt with further 0H3 amounts to about 1,700 souls, and that it consists of very heterogeneous elements. Agriculture of the Mo Agriculture is almost confined to the growing of dates; the groves generally begin between 200 and 800 yards from the water's edge, but the clear space between is also being planted with palms and in places the trees already come down to the bank. The present number of palms in the whole tract is estimated at 10,000. The date palms of Fao have a luxuriant growth, but most of them yield the inferior qualities of fruit known as Sair whicn are exported in baskets to Asiatic countries ; some of the better sort however are now bought up by Basrah, dealers for export in boxes to Europe and America. A little wheat and barley is produced for local consumption; and a small quantity of vegetables is raised by the people, both in summer and winter, for their own use. The cultivators do not keep livestock on the same scale as the inhabitants of 'Abbadan island on the other side of the Shatt-al -'Arab, but they own some cattle and a very few sheep : fof these some lucerne is cultivated, but their pasture consists chiefly of the grass that grows everywhere on the banks of the Shatt-al- Arab. In recent years reclamation of land from the river and the sea has been undertaken by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait who is owner of all541 the land at Fao. By means of Sadds or embankments a quantity of arable land has been added below the fort both on the bank of the river and on the side towards the sea, but not in the direction of Khor 'Abdullah ; and at another place the Shaikh has endeavoured to check erosion of the river bank by causing large Ballams filled with earth to be sunk close in shore. Creek No. 49 is a new one and is called after the present land-agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait. Shaikh Mubarak is also preparing to cultivate a new strip of land on the side next the desert; it extends with a breadth of 600 yards from the civil station to the Hadd creek, a distance of 5 miles; at present this plot is saline and produces nothing. Climate. —The year at Fao may be divided into seasons as follows :— Winter—December, January and February. Spring—March, April and May. Summer—June, July, August and September. Autumn—October and November. This distribution of months being taken as a basis, the highest and lowest temperatures recorded (in degrees Fahrenheit) since observations began to be taken have been :—- Season. Highest Temperature. Lowest Temparftture. Winter of 1904-05 ......... 84 51 Spring of 1905 .... . 106 70 Summer of 1905 116 93 Autumn of 1905 105 78 Winter of 1905-06 . . . . 84 47 Spring of 1906 107 68 Summer of 1906 (to end of Julj) ..... 120 73 The winters of 1904-05 and 1905-06 are believed to have been colder, and the summers of 1905 and 1906 less hot, than those of ordinary years.542 January and February are the wettest months ; but rain may fall at any time between the middle of November and the middle of March^ and in 1905 some rain was received in May. The total cold weather rainfall in 1904-05 was 3*65 inches, and in 1905-06 it was 1*63 inches. There are occasional showers at all seasons. During July and the first half of March north-west winds ordinarily prevail, with dry heat ; and from the middle of July to the end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as liot. In September and October there are frequently fogs at nio-ht and in the early morning. The civil station of i^ro.—The station of Pao covers the riverward end of the spit between the Haji Kashid creek (No. 2a above) and the creek of Haji ^Abdullah (No. 23 above) immediately below, and its frontage upon the river is about 600 yards. The telegraph offices—for the sake of which, chiefly, the station exists — are situated On the southern bank of the Haji Rashid creek, the quarters of the Turkish signalling staff being exactly in the corner between that creek and the bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. These quarters are built of wood in two storeys, each storey containing four rooms ; the staff accommodated consists of a superintendent, a mechanician and six clerks. A little further from the river (and also from the Haji Rashid creek) is the instrument room, a single-storeyed wooden building divided in half by a partition; the end nearest to the river is occupied by the Turkish, and the other end by the British staff. At a slightly greater distance from the river (but again considerably nearer to the creek) are the quarters of the British telegraph staff, which consists of one clerk in charge and three other clerks of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, one Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Service, and seven menials, among the last being four boatmen, A garden, lawn tennis court and other appurtenances adjoin the,British quarters on the two land ward sides, and there are 7 tanks of 400 gallons capacity each for storing water. The average number of messages transferred monthly at Fao from the Turkish line to the Indo-European Company^s cable is about 800, and of those transferred in the opposite direction about 600. On the south side of the British compound, about equidistant from the two creeks and from the river, is the Sarai or Turkish Government building, which is a substantial single-storeyed brick structure of five rooms ; and beyond this again, on the northern bank of the Haji ^ Abdullah creek and at about the same distance from the Shatt-al-'Arab as theFAO 548 British telegraph quarters, is a village of huts with a population of about 150 souls consisting partly of minor Turkish officials, police, etc. The quarantine establishment and premises, the latter consisting of two mud rooms, are located in the corner between the Haji 'Abdullah creek and the Shatt-al-'Arab which corresponds to the position occupied by the Turkish telegraph quarters at the other end of the station : the Customs House is between the Sarai and the quarantine office and has an upper storey of one room. On the river front, nearer to the quarantine than to the telegraph station, are the quarters of the Turkish harbour master : they stand on a tongue of firm ground between two marshes presently to be mentioned. A marsh lies behind the entire station, reaching practically from creek to creek ; and upon the river also there are two marshes, of which the larger lies between the telegraph station, the Sarai and the harbour master's quarters, and the smaller between the quarantine offices and the same quarters. At the back of the inland marsh, at about 700 yards from the river, date groves begin ; they extend for some hundreds of yards to the desert beyond. On the southern bank of the Haji Eashid creek, on the verge of the desert and about 1,000 yards from the river are the ruins of an old mud fort, now used as a graveyard and planted with date palms. On the same bank of the same creek, but nearer the river and about the middle of the date plantations, is a mosque adjoined by one or two huts. The Fdo fort, —The Fao fort, of which the construction was com menced in 1886, stands about four miles below the station, between the creeks of Bu Sa'id (No. 43 above) and Mulla ; Isa (No. 44 above), of which the former runs along its north-western and the latter along its south-eastern side ; it is about 500 yards distant from the Shatt-al-^Arab proper, but at high tide the water of the river washes up to its walls. The plan of the fort is roughly rectangular and its main face is appar ently that on the Mull a ^Isa creek, which looks to the south-east and towards the mouth of the river ; this front, which is faced with light coloured stone and rises about 15 feet above the crest of the glacis, shows from the river as a white line against a dark background of date planta tions. The fort is already completely shut in by date groves upon its south-west side, and new plantations reaching to the Shatt-al-'Arab have been laid out upon its north-western and south-eastern sides j it appears, in fact, that in a few years the fort, except for a clear alley leading down to the nearest part of the river, will be completely suirounded by a forest of dates. The fort is still without any artillery544 FAO armament. The actual garrison consists of a Yuzbashi^ about 45 rank and file of regular infantry^ and a Medical Officer ; there is also a Bim- bashi who is called ' Bimbashi of the Fao Fort^ ' but he lives at Basrah. Political position. —Fao, as the key of the Shatt-al -^Arab and as the point where the cable of the Indo-European Telegraph Department meets the Turkish land line, is a place of international importance; it is at the same time the only Turkish station of any size below Basrah. The Shaikh of Kuwait has valuable interests at Fao inasmuch as the whole of the tract, after remaining for some years in litigation in the Turkish courts between him and some of his nephews who are Turkish subjects, passed in 190 4? to the Shaikh in virtue of an amicable agreement by which the family estates on the banks of the Shatt-al -^Arab were parti tioned among the various claimants. The agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait at Fao is one 'Abdul 'Aziz of Kangun in Persia, a circum stance which may account for the nationality of a number of the cultivators employed. TurJcish administrative arrangements. —Fao is the headquarters of a Turkish Qadha, and the Qaim-Maqam who governs it has his residence and office at the Sarai in the civil station ; this official is at present a civilian, but military officers have at times held the appointment. The duties of the Qaim-Maqam are political rather than executive. His staff consists of a Mai Mudir or general secretary, a Sanduq AmTn or treasurer, and a clerk. The civil police under his orders are two non-commissioned officers and ] 5 men of the Dhabitiyahs. The strength and location of the Turkish telegraph staff and military garrison at Fao have already been described above. The place is the headquarters of the 2nd battalion of the 85th Radif regiment. The Turkish Customs establishment consists of a Mudir or superin tendent and one clerk, besides menials ; and the quarantine establishment of 1 officer and 2 guards. The present harbour master is a Lieutenant in the Turkish Navy; his duties are to register all local craft belonging to Turkish subjects and to levy port dues on exports and imports leaving or arriving by water. The Fao Qadha consists of the districts on the rig^ht bank of the Shatt-al -'Arab from Fao up to Mutawa 3 inclusive, with the dependent islands, and its population is thus about 15,000 souls. Communications, —At high water landing is easy everywhere in the neighbourhood of Fao ; but, when the tide is low, banks of mud that extend from 50 to 100 yards into the river are uncovered between the station^5) FAEA' rWABI) 545 and the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab, and the shore here bei mes inconve nient (though not impossible) of approach. At the station the breadth of the mud flats is only about 20 yards and it gradually decreases to 10 yards at the head of the Fao tract. The difference between ordinary high and low tide is, at the station, about 10 feet. With a south-west wind blowing, the tide sometimes rises 20 feet and submerges the station along with the surrounding country. The course of the paths in the Fao tract is determined by the creeks, the arrangement of which and of the villages upon them is extremely regular and symmetrical. A path follows the bank of each creek from the edge of the Shatt-al -'Arab up to the beginning of the desert; and there is also a pathway leading from the river to the desert up the centre of every spit between two adjacent creeks. Longitudinal communication is supplied by 3 roads or paths, all of which are roughly parallel to the river : of these, the one nearest to the river runs between the date planta tions and the stream and is interrupted by every creek which it encounters ; the second, which is the most shady and frequented, con nects the village^ on each creek with the villages upon the creeks adjoin ing it on either side and its course is consequently not very straight, but upon this route every creek is bridged by a single date log thrown across it; the third route lies along the edge of the desert behind the date plantations and is not interrupted by the creeks. Of these longitudinal routes the second and third are said to be prolonged the whole wav to Basrah Town. 1 sup® JisU Also called Wadi Eustaq (3^: an important valley in the (^li Sultanate of Oman which has its head on the north side of the Naid rwimi feail al-Fara' in the Western Hajar hills, some fifteen miles to the north to, of Hamrat• al-'A1)riyIn in 'Oman Proper and a few miles east of Jabal t ^ J ^ iSham r U, the highest peak of Jabal Akhdhar: from the Najd lep'-'l Wacli Para ' 111118 ln a general north-north-east direction.

There is also a ruined village called Munaqi near Wushail, half of which belonged to the government of the 'Oman Sultanate and half to the inhabitants of Wushail &gt; it has about 12 wells^ one of which is very large and is still used for [irrigation. Another village now deserted was Hajar^U ; about a mile south of Jammah; it was held by the Bani Harras and Siyabiyin. The trade of Wadi Fara^ is with Masna'ah. The name Eustaqis of uncertain application; it is sometimes used to designate particularly the fortified village of QaFat Kasra. which is the capital of the valley, but more generally it refers to the whole aggregate of villages from Hazam inclusive upwards. All Rustaq, in the latter sense, is in the possession of Saiyid Sa^id bin-IbrahIm^bin-Qais-bin-''Az2an, who deceives an allowance of $200 a month from the Sultan of Masqat and has given him his sister in marriage. A place in Turkish J Iraq on the right bank of the Shatt-al-^Arab 4 I^ARANGI miles above Basrah ; by Europeans it is called ' Magil ^ but this name (KTJT-AL-) is not used by natives and its origin is uncertain.* Kut-al-Farangi was, until about 35 years ago, the site of the British Consulate at Basrah, and f ■—— — — — —: —_ * In Colonel Chesney's Chart of 1849 the name appeals as 'McGrill.' Colonel I Chesney also gives Ma'kil, i.e., (stronghold), as an alternative, but locaily this I explanation is repudiated. The Ma'qil oanal, however, which led to Ol ;l Basrahi must have separated from the Shatt-al -'Arat) somewhere in this neighbourhood.552 FABANGI (KtFT-AL-) derives its name (' European Fortfrom tlie fact: the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have docks and workshops at this place, where they have been established for many years. One of the river steamers of the E. and T. S. N. Co. was lately reconstructed here, but as a rule the Kut-al-Earangi yard is only used for small repairs, and the heavy work of the Company is carried out at their Baghdad premises. There are two cemeteries, one belonging to the Company and the other to the Anglican community of Basrah. ; and a native village and some brick kilns also exist. Some of the Arab inhabitants have recently emigrated to Persia to avoid conscription by the Turks for military service. On the south side of the place is an insignificant creek which does not run very far inland : on the north side is a channel by which water from Khamisiyah on the Euphrates is said to reach the Shatt-al- 'Arab. The frontage of Kut-al-Farangi on the Shatt-al -'Arab seems to have been reclaimed at no very distant time and it is now again threatened by the encroachments of the river. By Arabs called Far is A large and important division of Persia ranking as a Province or Ayalat oJbl and ruled by a Gov ernor-General or Farman-Farma The following districts of the Persian Gulf are in the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Fars Liravi, Shabankareh, Mazara% part of Dashtistan, Tangistan^ Dashti, the greater part of Shlbkuh and, though in name only, the maritime portion of Bastak about Khamir. The physical geography, the administration, and the currency, weights and measures of these districts of Fars are dealt with in the article on the Persian Coast. The modern European name of the whole country (Persia) is derived from the name of this province (Fars) through the Greek 'Persis.' An islet in the middle of the Persian Gulf, about 67 miles north-east of Musallamiyah bay on the coast of the Hasa Sanjaq and an equal distance to the south-west of the Baraki villages on the coast of the Tangistan district in Persia: Jazirat ^Arabi is about 15 miles south of it The island is a quarter of a mile across, 10 feet above sea level a adFARtFR 553 overgrown with coarse grass and brushwood j it is frequented by fishermen ; chiefly from Kharag, who come to catch turtle^ abundant here; for their oil and shell. There is no fresh water. The ownership of this island, like that of ^Arabi, appears to be undetermined. A valley apparently running north by west and south by east and FARTJQ divided from the Hasa Oasis^ to the east of it; by an interval of about ^ 30 miles. On the north Wadi Faruq meets Summan in the neighbour- hood of Jabal Hamrat Judah; on the west it is bounded by Suimnan throughout its length of; possibly; 100 miles ; on the south it ends at a hilly ridge called Jau-ad-Dukhan y-*- perhaps 30 or 40 miles short of Jabrin. Its average breadth is perhaps 10 or 15 miles. Wadi Faruq is said to consist of a labyrinth of sandhills; but it produces firewood which is brought in by Eedouins for sale at Hofuf. The valley is occupied in autumn by the ''Ajman, and at times it is infested by raiding parties of the Al Morrah and Manasir, To British navigators at one time known as ' PotiorAn island in FARUR the Persian Gulf almost 20 miles south of the Shlbkuh port of Mughu ; JJJ* in shape it is an ellipse with its greater diameter of miles running from north to south and a lesser diameter of 3 miles. Except for a reef with a few detached rocks on the west side, the island has deep water all round it; and the coast consists of rocky cliffs 30 or 40 feet high. The tides here are strong and there is one dangerous shoal between Farur and the mainland; apparently identical with the pearl bank known as Niveh Jazirat Farur ^ &gt; otherwise the island is easy of approach* Farur is covered with dark volcanic hills which in one conical but table-topped peak attain a height of 465 feet. Most of the island is bare rock and talus; but the ravines contain numerous trees and one on the east side has wells and some date-palms. There is little bird-life but there are a few gazelle. On the east side of the island is a small village of about 40 souls of Sudan and of miscellaneous Arabs from, the Persian side. They own a couple of fishing boats (Shu'ais); most of their * &gt; distant view of part of Farur Island is given in Chart No* 2373—'2837-A, Persian Gulf,FARtFR provisions are imported from Mughu. The people of Mughn send their cattle to Farur to graze and they obtain some firewood from the island. Farur is under the Marzuqi Shaikh of Mug'liu. The Persian Government have not up to the present time shown any interest in this island. In English formerly known by the extraordinary name of ' Nobfleure.^ An uninhabited islet lying in the Persian Gulf about 10 miles south- south-west of the southern extremity of Farur island. It has a reef one mile in extent on the north-west side and narrow reefs on the west and south sides^ otherwise it is surrounded by deep water. Nabiyu Farur is circular in shape with a diameter of half a mile^ and towards its east side is a dark-coloured, saddle-shaped hill 120 feet in height; the greater part of its surface is sandy and covered with salsola bushes. A few larks and chats (genus Saxicola) and a colony of ospreys are the only living creatures. No attention has as yet been paid by the Persian Government to this island. A large coral reef of irregular shape, with an average diameter of about 3 miles ; lying about 7 miles north-west of Bahrain Island. Near its eastern extremity is a remarkable Kaukab or spring of fresh water, which is 3 feet below the surface of the sea at low tide. As much as 700 gallons of excellent water have been obtained from it in a day. Pearl divers make use of the spring in the pearling season : during the rest of the year it is seldom visited by sailing boats. Faris Jl ; singular Farisi A general term used in the Persian Gulf to describe Arabs of the Persian littoral from Kangun to Bandar 'Abbas who do not belong to any well known Arab tribe j such, for instance, are the Abu Dastur who are found on Sirn island. The name is in use in the Sultanate of 'Oman also, but there it is applied to Arabicised Persian immigrants and their descendants ; in the dominionsFUWAIEAT 555 of the Sultan the Fawaris are Sunnis and number about 5,000 souls, being found at Sawaiharah, Sohar Town and Sallan in the Sohar sub-Wilayat of Batinah and at Sham and fenjah in Wadi Samail. A village of the Shamailiyall tract in Trucial 'Oniailj 15 miles FTJJAIRAH south of Khor Fakkan aud 27 miles north-north-east of Shinas; it is situated near the place where Wadi Ham reaches the coast and is about two miles from the sea. The landing place opposite Fujairah is called Grharaifah; but its port is GMllall; a little to the southward, from which it is distant four miles by land and whence goods are brought on camels. Fujairah possesses date plantations containing some SjGOO palms, amid which stands the village adjoined by a small but strong fort upon a hill. The village is completely surrounded by a strong wall, 9 feet high, to which have been added on the south and west sides an exterior ditch and breast-work. There is plenty of fresh water in wells 4 fathoms deep. The houses, in number about 150, are mostly of mud and stone, but a few are of gypsum cement. During the date harvest, when peace reigns, the inhabitants are accustomed to camp in mat huts among their plantations outside the village walls. The people of Fujairah, who are Sharqiym, mostly of the Hafaitat section, live by the cultivation of dates and by pearl diving; some tobacco, wheat and jowari are raised also* There are no manufactures and no shops. Fujairah is the stronghold of the Sharqi leader Hamad-bin- 'Abdullah, who since 1901 has been endeavouring to assert the indepen dence of a part of the Shamailiyall tract against the Shaikh of Sharjall. The following places in Shamailiyah are reported to be now in the possession of Hamad and accordingly to look to Fujairah as their capital: Bithnah, Grharaifah, Marbah, Qaraiyah, Qidfa' and Saqamqam. This tract in revolt under Hamad enjoys the countenance of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. A village on the east side of the Qatar promontory about 10 miles from FUWAIR- its northern extremity. Immediately to the north of it is a hill called Jabal-al-Fuwairat, separating ft from the site of the now deserted village of Ghariyah which is also on the coast; according te another666 FUWAIBAT account; however, the Jabal is merely a vertical cliff 30 feet high, against the foot of which the sea breaks. The village is surrounded by towers, but it is not continuously walled and there are no gates. The houses upon the circumference of the village are substantially built of stone and mud. The population of Fuwairat consists of about 100 houses of the A1 Bu Kuwarah tribe and 50 of Kibisah: these communities are divided from one another by a well-marked street and form a southern and a northern quarter respectively. The people live chiefly by pearl diving, but they also own some 20 horses^ 100 camels, 60 donkeys and 80 cattle. About 35 pearl boats, 9 other sea-going vessels, (and 12 fishing boats belong to the place. There are no shops. Indifferent water is obtained from the Zarka well, 1 mile west of the village, and good water from the wells of Eilihah, and 'Ain Sanan distant 2 and ^ miles respectively to the south-west. The ^Ain Sanan well is protected by a fort originally built by the Ma'adhidj but now occupied and kept in repair by the A1 Bu Kuwarah. GAB AND I A valley in the Shlbkuh district of Persia : it runs parallel to the coast at an average distance throughout its course of about 10 miles inland, finally reaching the sea in Naband bay : the length of the valley is about 45 miles, and its direction is from east-south-east to west-north west. The principal points in the Gabandi valley are the village of Chah Mubarak, at about 13 miles from its mouth, and Gabandi village about 16 miles above Chah Mubarak. The villages of Gabandi are divided into four political groups known as Harami , Maliki , Nasuri LS)y^'&gt; and Tamimi .

In all the divisions the people are of mixed origin, speaking both Persian and Arabic, and nearly all are Sunnis of the Shafi'i sect. The inhabi tants of the Nasuri group of villages call themselves Nasuris, but in reality only the family of their chief and a very few others belong to that tribe. In most of the places there is a sprinkling of negroes. Wheat, barley, maize, rice, flax and tobacco are grown in the Gabandi valley, chiefly by rainfall but in places by irrigation; date palms every where abound; and in some villages there are limes, pomegranates and vines. Most of the people are agriculturists, but some of them take part in the pearl fishery on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Shivuh and Tibin are the ports of Gabandi. An estimate of local resources can be formed from the data given in the village tables above. Until 1905 the whole valley was administered by the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandi village, Hasan-bin-Mazkur, under whom were also Shivuliand certain other places on the Shibkuh. coast and the villages of Darveh Asuh; for the places then subject to his control the Shaikh paid 12,000 Tumans a year to the Governor of Bastak. In 1906 a new arrangement was made, the Harami, Maliki and Tamimi villages being taken from Hasan-bin-Mazkur, whose annual revenue was at the same time reduced to 7,000 Tumans, and conferred on the Tamimi Shaikh, Saqar-bin-Mubarak, of Chah Mubarak, who thereupon became responsible to the Governor of Bastak for 5,000 Tumans a year on account of the Maliki and Tamimi groups and to the Imperial Persian Customs for 3,560 Tumans a year on account of the Harami villages in Gabandi and upon the coast of ShlbkuL Shaikh Saqar was however assassinated in March 1907, and it is not yet known how the local administrative arrangements will be affected by the event. Shaikh Hasan-bin-Mazkur is a Sunni; but his wife, a daughter of Tahir Khan of Galehdar, is a Shi'ah; consequently his eons are being brought up as Sunnis and his only daughter as a Shi ah.GARGAR 563 A group of 3 villages on the coast of the Persian district of Hayat GANAVEH Davud, 15 miles north-north-west of the town of Big ; the villages, in order from north to south, are distinguished as Shamali Miyani and Qausi ^5. The place is defended by half a dozen towers and comprises altogether about 150 houses : the inhabitants are Lurs. A short way to the south of the villages is a creek deep enough to admit native boats of 25 tons burden; but the anchorage for larger vessels is at some distance off-shore, there being only 3 fathoms at li miles, and the landing is bad at low water. Dates, wheat and barley are the chief products; there are about 40 horses, 30 mules and 200 donkeys, and the fowls are said to be remarkably fine, Ganaveh is governed at present by Murad Khan, son of Ka Murad, an uncle of the Khan of Hayat Dawud ; and he resides here. A Customs official is now stationed at this place partly in order to prevent the smuggling of rifles into the country, but as yet the trade has suffered little from his interference. Near Ganaveh are some extensive ruins, probably marking the site of the Jannabah of the mediaeval Arab and Persian geographers.* This channel, the uppermost part of which is artificial, issues from the Karun on its left bank just above Shuslltar Town and rejoins that river at Band-i-Qir. Its direction is thus almost exactly from north to south, and its length in a straight line about 30 miles, but between its extreme points it bends eastwards in a regular curve of which the maximum divergence from the direct line is about 8 miles. The Gargar forms the eastern boundary of the Miyanab island. Features of course.—hi its head are the remains of a massive barrage, apparently known at the present day as the Band-i-Mirza ^ ^ ; t it is built of hewn stone with six narrow openings, through which water passes leaving the crest dry except when the river is high and pours over it. The openings, however, are unbridged and are too wide to cross. Below this barrage the stream flows for half a mile through a channel, 100 feet deep, artificially excavated in the sandstone rock : it then reaches a second dam, called Pul-i-Bulaiti Jtyy. cb, which carries the routes from • * ® ee Ij0 Strail p' s Lands of the Eastern Caliphate. The Carmathian Abii Tahir is said to have been born at Jannabah, which was also celebrated in the middle a^es tor the manufacture of linen stuffs. 1' The names Band-i-Qaisar and Band-i-Shahzadeh are not now recognised as applying to this barrage. See also footnote to article Shatait. 2 o 2 GARGAR or AB 1- GARGAR //yJ564 GARGAR Shushtar Town to all places east of it. At the Pul-i-Bulaiti the water is forced into tunnels in the precipitous rock on both sides of the river and by these is conducted to the flour-mills of Shushtar and Bulaiti a little further down. Below the mills, at 200 yards or more from the dam rock yields to earth; but the banks continue to be nearly 100 feet in height till the end of Shushtar Town is reached. Half a mile below Pul-i-Bulaiti a natural ledge of rocks crosses the channel with an opening in it 20 yards wide but passable for native river boats. At a point 4 miles lower down the river bed is again nearly traversed by a natural barrier, carrying masonry remains, by which the course of the stream is considerably deflected to the east and made to form an acute angle j this place is called Mahibazan uljb or Bazaniyat meaning a place where fish play, from the numbers of fish which come there to spawn and are caught. On the right bank at 7 or 8 miles below Shushtar is the important landing place of Shalaili, above which there is not, for practical purposes, any navigation either native or European. From Mahibazan to a short distance above Band4-Qir the Gargar meanders through a stretch of low ground: this bottom varies in width from a mile to several hundred yards and is enclosed upon either side by steep clay banks from 40 to 50 feet high ; with which the river in its windings from time to time comes in contact. As Band-i -Qir is approached the high banks close in upon the river and show remains of brick buildings, vestiges of the ancient city of 'Askar Mukram • parts of these are sunk as much as 10 and even 20 feet below the present surface of the ground. At Band-i-Qir itself the banks do not ordinarily rise more than 18 feet above the river in its lowest season; and in the high season, during floods, they are frequently overflowed. The width of the Gargar stream varies from 50 to nearly 100 yards, and at Band-i-Qir it is about 60. The banks are now entirely denuded of wooding. Discharge, rise and fall, current and silt. —The flood discharge of the Gargar is estimated at about 7,000 cubic feet a second, but in March 1905 the discharge at Band-i-Qir was only about 2,000 cusecs. Owing to the height of the banks the river does not lend itself naturally to purposes of irrigation, but in some places there are small inundation canals watering low-lying lands. The times of the river^s rise and fall vary from year to year, and the difference between the summer and the winter level is also inconstant; but by the middle of June the water has ordinarily subsided to a low level and thereafter continues to decrease u:itil the first rains of winter fall at the end of October or beginningGARGAR 565 of November. Ordinarily the current varies from 5 to 2 knots and is strongest in the upper reaches towards Shushtar Town, but when the Haddam is in flood it is said to attain 8 knots below the confluence of that tributary. The silt of the Garg-ar at its maximum is about one-eightieth of the volume of water j most of it is of purely local origin and is very quickly dropped. The discoloration of the water in floods is a light buff,* Navigation. The navigation of the Gargar is difficult, chiefly on account of the sinuosity and the narrowness in places of the channel, of which the breadth varies from 20 to 40 yards \ with a low river obstacles in the shape of stones, sand spits and tree stumps are super added. Tree stumps and similar snags are especially common in the middle reaches of the Gargar; many of them are known and can be avoided, but new ones are frequently met with when the river falls. The average depth of the Gargar in the low season is from 6 to 4^ feet, but at par ticular points soundings of 3, 2 and even feet may be expected. The channels are subject to perpetual alteration in consequence chiefly of sand bars, which are thrown across the river by small tributaries during- the last freshets of spring; these the reduced river of the summer season is unable to scour away. Among the larger of the tributaries are the Malih 6 miles below Hilaleh; the Chai-an-Naft laiuJI coming in 2 miles below Kraidi, from the neighbourhood of some naphtha springs below the Bakhtiyari hills ) and the Haddam , 1 mile below Saiyid Hasan: these are all upon the left bank and contain water only after rain. About If miles above Band-i -Qir the river contains piles of old cut stones which make the passage dangerous in the low season and also afford a point d'appui for the formation of sand banks. The ' Shushan/' which runs from Ahwaz to Shalaili in ordinary states of the river, is a stern-wheeler 100 feet in length over all, with a beam of 23 feet, and draws 3 feet when carrying 30 tons of cargo ; f a longer vessel could not negotiate some of the turns, and an ordinary paddle-steamer would find many if not most of the channels too narrow* Since 1892 the ' Shushan ^ has plied regularly on the Gargar at most seasons, but when the river is low she frequently runs aground or strikes the banks and sometimes sustains injury. The only fuel is wood, which all comes from the banks of the Diz and of which about 15 tons are consumed * The waters of the Gargar, then known as the Mashruqan wer6 described as 'white' by an Arab traveller so long ago as the 10th century A.D.

The steaming hours between Ahwag and Shalaili are from 20 to 26 in ascending, of which 7 are occupied by the reaches of the Karun below Band-i-Qir ; the return journey to Ahwaz takes from 9 to 20 hours according to the state of the river. fill ages. —The following are the villages situated on both banks of the Gargar in order from Shushtar Town down to Band-i-Qir Name.

Its length north and south is 21 miles, . its breadth | of a mile; low in the north it rises to 600 feet in the southern part, and the shore at nearly all points is precipitous. Jazirat- al-Ghanam is totally barren and devoid of water; but the people of Kumzar, to whom it belongs, send goats here for grazing after rain. Also called the Sbatt-al-Hai ^■'l ■ but this name, though it is still [sHATTA L-) understood, seems to be passing out of general use. The Shatt-al-Gbaraf .... r ... is a great^ stream, almost a river, in Turkish 'Iraq : it leaves the right bank ^ of the Tigris opposite Kut-al-Amarah and, running on tie average about south-east by east, joins the Euphrates at two places, viz., at Hammar and at a point a little below Nasiriyah Town. The relations to one another of the various channels of the Gharaf are explained below. The length of its course from Kut to Nasiriyah is about 130 miles; in parts where the bed is single its average width is as much as 75 yards; and the banks, which are of sandy alluvium, rise in places as much as 18 feet above the level of the bed. In summer the Shatt-al- Gharaf is dry, but in winter the main stream is said to have an average depth of about 6 feet and could probably be navigated by a river steamer of light draught: it is believed however that the waterway is silting up. The difference of level between the upper end of the Shatt-al-Gharaf on the Tigris and its lower end at Uasirayah Town is inconsiderable, and it is said that floods in the Euphrates reverse for a time the current of the stream in its lower reaches, A branch of the Shatt-al-Gharaf formerly separated from the present bed immediately below Hai Town and rejoined it 3 or 3 miles below * Authorities. —Mr. H. W.

Qal'at Sikar ; this channel is now silted up and is called the Shatt-al- A^ma ^ or Blind River ; while it still flowed the alternative branch was known as Abu Juhairah and the island enclosed between the two as Jazirat Kinanah . At the same period the reach near Shatrat-al-Muntafik was styled the Shatt-as-Sabil but this name seems to have fallen into desuetude. The stream is said now to divide some, way above Shatrat-al-Muntafik Town into two branches, of which the eastern takes | of the water and is called the Shatt-al-Bada'ah , while the western carries the .remainder and is known as the Shatt-ash-Shatrah. The Shatt-al-Bada'ah runs through swamps to the Euphrates at Hammar; and the Shatt-ash-Shatrah, after passing the town from which it is named, bifurcates at a place Hamzah into two channels. Of the two sub-divisions of the Shatt- ash-Shatrah the larger, known as the 'Ajuzah , goes eastwards and joins the Shatt-al-Bada'ah while the other—which is probably the original bed of the Gharaf—enters the Euphrates about 4 miles below Nasiriyall. The lower part of the Shatt-al-Gharaf in both its present branches is environed by marshes over which the inhabitants move in canoes, except in the dry season j but communication between the towns of Nasiriyah. and Shatrat-al-Muntafik is ordinarily by land. The marshes on the Bada^ah branch vary in depth from 3 feet in summer to 6 or 7 feet in time of flood. The following are the chief points of interest on or near the western most (or original) bed of the Shatt-al-Gharaf, in order from its head downwards:— Name. Position. Nature. EE masks. Mhairijah On the right bank, about 10 miles from the Tigris. A small village, the head-quarters of a Nahiyah of the same name in the Qadha of Hai. There are about 50 houses and 5 or 6 shops.

Nasiriyah Town On the western side of the western most channel of the Shatt-al-Ghara near its junction with the Euphra tes, and about 30 miles below Sha- trat-al-Munta- fik. See article Wasiriyah Town, Cereals are extensively cultivated on both sides of the Shatt-al-Gharaf, and a kind of water lift is here in use for irrigation which resembles the balanced lever seen on the banks of the Nile and the dhenlh of the Pan jab in India. The chief crops are wheat; barley, maize, millet, and sesame. In the country of the Bani Rabl'all, which adjoins the Tigris, the Shatt-al-Gharaf divides the territory of the Maiyah section of that tribe on the west from that of the Sarai section on the east side ; the rest of its course lies through the country of the Muntafik. Some authorities consider that the Shatt-al-Gharaf was originaiiy an irrigation canal dug from the Tigris and that it has been enlarged to its580 GHARAF (SHATT-AL-) present dimensions by the rush down it of the surplus waters of that river in time of flood. The main stream of the Tigris apparently began to flow down the bed of the Shatt-al-Grharaf about 600 A.D. and returned to its original (and present) bed about 1550 A.D, The celebrated ancient town of Wsit-al-Hai was probably situated on the Shatt-al Gharaf not far from the present town of Hai; it was founded by the celebrated governor Hajjaj about 703 A.D. and was called Wasit or Central because it was regarded as approximately equidistant from Kufah, Basrah and Ahwaz. At the end of the 14th century it was held with a garrison by Taimur Lang (Tamerlane). GHAEJF A level tracts described as strewn with broken black shingle, between the sandy, flat country of the Trucial ''Oman coast and the hills in the interior : it lies on the route from Sharjah Town to the Baraimi Oasis, rather nearer to the former than to the latter, and is now inhabited by the Bani Qitab. It originally belonged to the Nairn of Baraimi who were expelled by the Bani Ka'ab about 1790. In 1840 the place was already in the occupation of the Rani Qitab and was then covered with thick thorn jungle and had several wells and a ruined fort; the last has now disappeared. The nearest well in Gharif to Sharjah Town is one called Thaqaibah &lt;*.uaj 2 and the furthest from it is that of 'Aiyoh, GHUBBAT Also called Malcolm Inlet.* An arm of the sea forming a remarkable GHAZIRAH indentation in the eastern coast line of the Rnus-al-jibal district of the ilc 'Oman Sultanate towards its northern extremity.

On the north side two large coves 3 miles deep, and on the south side two shorter ones, project inland at right angles to the main inlet. Ghubbat Ghazirah is surrounded on every side by precipitous hills ; but here and there are small sandy bays formed by ravines which come down from the mountains, and the coast-line of ♦Remarks on t bis inlet hy Admiral Atkinson-Willes, E.N., will be found in,the Government of India's Political Proceedings for June 1904GHUWAK 581 the inlet is so irregular as to attain a length of over 40 miles. The soundings are from 30 to 36 fathoms in the main inlet and from ^0 to 25 fathoms in the smaller coves. Ghubbat Ghazirah would shelter a large fleet, but it is not suitable for a fixed coaling station as it would not be easy to defend. Vessels could safely coal in it from colliers, and it would serve as a good temporary anchorage. The villages of Film, Habalain, Mansal and Maqaqah, belonging to the Dhahuriyin, are situated in Ghubbat Ghazirah.

The eastern boundary of Ghuwaris, however, prolonged far to the southward and reaches to a hill called Qusur Bin-''Ajlan ^ )}***&gt; which is probably about 50 miles north of Jabrin; south of the Hasa Oasis, Ghuwar is adjoined on the east by the tract known as Kharmah. The north-western corner of the Ghuwar tract is marked by the hill of Ghar-ash-Shuyukh, and thence the western boundary runs GHUWAR582 GHUWAR southwards to another hill named Qarat-al-^Othmaniyah s and gradually converges towards the eastern boundary which it meets at Qnsur Bm- ^Ajlan. The length of the Ghuwar tract according to these specifications is about 90 miles; and its maximum breadth^ which is opposite to the Hasa Oasis ; is 20 to 25. The western border of Ghuwar is parallel to tlie edge of Summan, but is separated from it by the tracts of Na'alah and Wadi Faruq, which are also long and narrow and follow the same direc tion as Summan; of the two, Na'alah is the one which is immediately in contact with Ghuwar. Nearly in the centre of that part of Ghuwar which has for its corners the hills of Qarat-ar-Rukban, Bu Ghanimah, Qarat-al-^Othmamyah and Ghar-ash-Shuyukh is a hill known as Jabal Ghuwar. Ghuwar is de scribed as a sandy district abounding in stony hillocks. Some authorities would carry Ghuwar as far north as the Gharaimil hill, thus absorbing in Ghuwar the greater part of the tract which we have dealt with elsewhere under the name of Badd-al -Asis.

A brackish stream which traverses the great plain common to the Ramuz and Ahwaz Districts o£ ^Arabistan forming a sometimes serious obstacle on the route between Nasiri and Hainuz Town. The Gupal consists at first merely of the surplus water of a canal which takes off from the right bank of the Ramuz river at a point about 5 miles east of Ramuz Town and waters the plain to the north-east of the town between it and the hills, At about 4 miles north of Ramuz Town the overflow water of the canal is augmented by a brackish tributary which has its rise in the Gypsum Hills bounding the Ramuz District on this side ; the increased stream continues to flow north-westwards, keeping within a mile of the hills and parallel to them ; until the mounds of Kut-ash-Shaikh are passed, lying 1| or 2 miles to southward. Three or four miles further on the Gupal changes direction to the south-west, and so passes about 6 miles to the north-west of the village of Mirbacheh. Near this it probably receives on the left bank two tributaries, viz., the fresh stream which has its course a mile eastward of Mirbacheh and the salt Muwailheh stream which is described in the article on Ramuz District. About 9 miles after passing Mirbacheh a salt stream from the north, called the Kihdak and having its source in the Gypsum Hills which enclose the plain on the north-east, falls into the Gupal on its right bank. Eventually, about 12 miles west of Mirbacheh, the Gupal intersects the usual route between Nasiri and Ramuz : there is some choice of crossing places. A barrage^ partly of masonry, was constructed here abouts in 1905 by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and a canal was cut from the same to irrigate the lands of Banneh which lie a few miles to the south. The barrage can be Used as a bridge by men, but not at present by animals; it is intended, however, to improve it. At this point in its course the water of the Gupal is salt, even after recent rain* The banks, which in most places are perpendicular and of clay, rise about 20 feet above the level of the bed, and the distance between them varies from 20 to 70 yards. In summer the Gupal is probably almost dry ; in winter it sometimes rises 15 or 20 feet and overflows the banks, and at that season it may be found either fordable or unfordable. When unfordable, yet without being much swollen, the actual stream is 10 to 15 yards in breadth and runs with a considerable volume and a decided current. Quicksands occur. About 300 yards below the barrage the stream bends to the west, and 8 miles further on it is drawn off in a southerly direction in numerous small canals, some of which, being a feet, deep are difficult to cross. TheGWADAR DISTRICT 585 Gupal now ceases to exists and the surplus water which is not absorbed by the cultivation spreads out to form the Shakheh marsh; it is said when in great excess, to travel far southward and flood miles of country to the north-east of Gharaibeh on the Jarrahi. In March 1906 from a point 4 miles north of Gharaibeh more than 90° of the horizon, chiefly between north and east, was seen to be flooded in this manner. Extent. —The Gwadar district includes not only the town and port GWADAR* of that name, but the whole of the country in Makran which is subject to the Sultan of 'Oman. It consists of the shores of East and ^ ^ West Gwadar Bays and of a sandy strip of flat country in which rise DISTRICT the hills of Jabal-i-Mahdi Koh-i-Dram ^&lt;5 ; and various low emi nences farther to the westward. At the foot of the Koh-i-Dram lies Gwadar-i-Nigwar j/i, the only cultivated locality, t The rest is known as Gwadar-i-Eaik ^ ix.^ Gwadar Sands. The whole district covers an area of some 307 square miles. Limits, —Great divergence of opinion exists regarding the boundaries on every side except the south. Those given by Captain Eoss, who was for several years Assistant Political Agent at Gwadar, are i north, Koh- i-Dram • east, Barambab or Barambabad Kaur ; W est, Cape Pishukan . These appear to be the limits generally recog nised by the townspeople of Gwadar. Some Baluchi subjects of the 'Oman Sultanate regard the watershed of the Talar j^ range, called Saiji in Dasht from the.Talar Pass to Kandasol as the northern boundary; a line drawn south from the Talar Pass to near Sarchib eventually terminating at the mouth of the Karwat torrent, as the eastern limit; and a line running south through Koh Tungi JX S y near Gabd ^ to Ispar Koh , a lullock east of Ganz y?, as the frontier on the west. Subjects of the Khan of Kalat o»y give the Dram hill as the northern, the Drabbailo stream as the eastern, and the Ankarau jjKj) stream as the western boundary ; the tract from the mouth of the Palairi to Pishukan is regarded by them as an isolated locality also belonging to the Sultanate of 'Oman. The bulk of local opinion seems to incline to * The greater part of the materials for this and following article has been supplied by the courtesy o f Mr. E. Hugbes-Buller, I.C.S., editor of the Imperial Gazetteer Ot -Baluchistan. The map for Gwadar district is sheet No. 16 N. E. of the North- Western Frontier series of the Survey of India : the Chart is No. 2383—38. The latter contains a view of the coast hills, t Nigwar is the cultivated skirt of a MIL586 GWADAR DISTRICT this view. At Pishukan again the boundary is disputed, the people of that place claiming up to Ispar Koh ; while those of Ganz and Jmwri consider their limit to be the western margin of Dagaro Tal about '2 miles west of Pishukan. The coast line, which extends some 40 miles in a direct line, is low and consists of sand-dunes. The most conspicuous headlands are Sur ^ or Jabal Sur, the north-east point of Gwadar East Bay; Gwadar Head^ a hammer-headed rocky promontory 7 miles in length east and West and about a mile wide; and Has Pishukan, a narrow rocky spit. Physical features. —The Dram or Dramb hills form part of the Makran coast range. Owing to their inaccessibility they have long formed an asylum for the people of southern Makran from Persian and other incursions. It was here also that the Kulanchis took refuge from Mir 'Abdullah Khan between 1715-16 and 1730-31. The highest peaks are Barn (3,152 feet). Dram (3,125) and Mukh ^ (3,200). The Dram range is much frequented by the nomads of Gwadari-i- Ni^war. Chish and Kahur trees are abundant and the water- supply is fairly plentiful. Jabal-i-M ahdi, so called from an original settle ment of the Mahdizais an offshoot of the Sangur tribe, on its skirts, is a mass of white clay hills of somewhat remarkable outline^ and with perpendicular cliffs on the south side; a gap 2 miles in width divides it from the Sur headland. The Koh-i«Batil forms part of the Gwadar Head: it is an irregular mass of cliffs of a dark brown colour and about 480 feet high overlooking Gwadar Town. Five miles east of Gwadar Town there is a small mud volcano * near the beach, and one of the features of the harbour itself is another, which after heavy Weather becomes active and emits poisonous gases, sometimes destroying thousands of fish. The area contains no rivers ; the Karwat, Barambab or Barambabad, Sur, and Ankarau are the most important of the hill torrents. All rise in the Dram hills with the exception of the Ankarau, which rises further north in the southern slopes of the Saiji ridge and falls into the sea through a large salt-water creek to the west of Gwadar Town. Climate and water supply, —The climate is hot throaghout the year, but the proximity of the coast and the consequent sea-breezes render the heat less oppressive than in the Kaich valley. The European Telegraph officials formerly stationed at Gwadar Town found the place ♦ See article Persian Makran, physical cbaracteristics, footnote. i is.aWADAH DISTRICT 687 go unhealthy that it had to be abandoned ; the stench arising from the sea ; apparently caused by mud-volcanoes ; is at times intolerable. More recently some improvement has taken place, but malaria is always prevalent and strangers are generally attacked i The water supply everywhere is brackish. In (Jwadar Town water is obtained from shallow wells and in Gwadar-i-Nigwar from deep ones; in the latter place it is not only brackish but fetid. The rainfall is very scanty and sometimes none occurs for several consecutive years : most is received in winter. Plants and animals. —There is nothing distinctive about the flo% which is scanty in the extreme. Tamarisk is found in the beds of the torrents and Chish, Chigird and Kahur in the plains^ except in Gwadar-i-Rail^ where there are no trees. Gwadar-i-Nigwar possesses a few date-groves. The hills contain mountain sheep and Sind ibex, which are celebrated for their size. The sea swarms with fish, and fishing is carried on not only in the Gwadar Bays and at Pishukan but also at Sur and off the mouth of the Barambab. Vovulation. —The total population of the Gwadar district, including Gwadar-i-Nigwar and Pishukan, was about 1,030 families or 5,150 persons in 1903. With the exception of the Gwadar Town, the head^ quarters of the administration, and Pishukan there are no- permanent villages. Of the few temporary hamlets in Gwadar-i-Nigwar, Khiya Qalat oUS alone is important, as the headquarters of the Nig war headman. The groups inhabiting Nigwar in 1903 were Kalmatis, 20 families ; Mahdizais, 30 families j Zainuzais ( a section of the Kulanch ^ Bands 10 families; Eaikanis or indigenous Baluchis, 50 families; and 10 families of servile origin. Gwadar Town contains about 870 families or 4,350 persons^ and Pishukan about 40 families or 300 persons. The majority of these are Maids who number some 3,700 persons : others are Koras Ij/ or sailors, 80 families; Hindus, 40 families ; Khojahs or Lutiyahs 3 50 families. The Arab Wali's following and escort of sepoys number about 30. The Nigwar Baluch are Zikris ; the Khojahs are followers of the Agha Khan; the Arabs are Ibadhiyah ; and the Maids and Koras are Sunni Muhammadans. The occupation of most of the population is fishing; the Saluchis are engaged in flock-owning, cultivation and transport, and the Khojahs and Hindus in trader588 GWADAR DISTRICT Agriculture.' —Cultivation is confined to Gwadar-i-Nigwar; its extent is insignificant and as a means of livelihood it is precarious. Large tracts of arable land are ; However; available for cultivation. The whole of the land is dry-crop and dependent on floods caught by embankments. The cultivators generally combine flock-owning with agriculture. The principal crops are jowari, cotton, and Mash. A little wheat; barley, Parmash; Arzun and some melons and dates are also grown. In Nigwar there are about 200 camels, 100 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats ; there are almost no donkeys. Manufactures. —Salt is manufactured in pans out of salt water drawn from wells on the shore. It was untaxed until 1903; when the Arab authorities proposed to take one-twentieth of the produce as revenue. The salt is used for local consumption and for flsh-curing. Communications. —The main route from Gwadar to Turbat traverses the south-east of the area. An alternative route leads northward to the Ankarau river and, crossing the Dram; joins the first route at the Talar Pass. Several tracks lead westward to Persian Makrail; the principal one following the telegraph line via Gabd and Drabol to Bahu and another going to the same place vi&amp; Suntsar and the Dasht. Transport animals are chiefly camels; but there are a few mules and donkeys. Administration. —The country is administered by an Arab deputy of the Sultan of 'Oman, known as the Wali; who lives in Gwadar Town and is supported by an Arab garrison of 20 footmen. A sub-governor, a Maid by origin; lives at Pishukan. Civil cases are referred to a local Qadhi, whose decision must be confirmed by the Wali. The interests of the British Subjects; i.e.y the Hindus and the Khojahs, are looked after by a resident Native Assistant to the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs; the Director deciding any civil or criminal cases which may occur among them. The Wali is helped by the Nigwar headman in all cases relating to the people bf that place; and by the Kauhdas or headmen of the Maids and the Koras in cases relating to the latter. In return for his services the Nigwar headman is given the Dahyak or tithes and the grazing-tax of Nigwar. The Kauhdas of the Maids and the Koras get four dollars per annum as an allowance. The only revenue realized by the Arab authorities is derived from customs duties, levied on goods entering or leaving the port, at the rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem; from octroi on goods imported into Gwadar Town ; and from a tithe on fresh fish*GWADAR TOWN 589 The customs revenue of Gwadar has undergone various vicissitudes since it ceased to be farmed and was brought under direct management in 1903; it is understood that the gross collections are now about $37,000 a year, while the net income is about $28,000. Capital of Gwadar District and the principal place on the Makran GWADAR* coast. f Gwadar is a town with an open roadstead, standing on a sandy ^ ^ isthmus to the northward of Gwadar Head about 310 miles east of TOWN Karachi. On either side of the isthmus are bays, both of which are shallow. Large steamers cannot approach near the shore and landing has to be effected in country boats. The population numbered about 4,350 persons in 1903 : the details of its comprsition are given in the article on Gwadar District. Most of the dwellings are mat-huts : but round a square fort with a high tower garrisoned by Arab ^Askaris of the Sultan of'Oman there are clustered a number of mud and stone houses, among which the Khojah mosque is conspicuous. There are a few date and banyan trees, and fair water is obtainable by digging about 12 feet. The climate of Gwadar town is unhealthy; and an inter mittent fever, attended by headache, want of appetite and violent retching, is prevalent, especially when the wind is in the south-west, t The value of the trade, which is carried on chiefly by Hindus and Kh5jahs, was estimated in 1903 at 5^ lakhs of rupees exports and 2 lakhs imports. Exports are ghi, wool, goats'' hair, hides, cotton, salt fish, fins, dates, Pish-leaves and mats; imports are cotton piece-goods, silk, sugar, rice, jowari, iron, and kerosine. Some coarse cloth is woven and Pish mats are made. Trade with the interior is carried on by Baluch caravans. There are 5 Hindu and 10 Muhammadan Indian houses of business under British protection. Dues are levied both on imports and exports, generally at 5 per cent, ad valorem, and a tithe is taken of all fresh fish landed in the port. The number of large native craft (1905) belonging to the place is 23; there are also 50 smaller fishing boats, 6 lighters and 400 fishing Horis. The sea-going vessels of this port run to Basrah, Masqat, Karachi, Bombay and the Malabar coast. The Gaz or cubit of Gwadar is very nearly equal to 2 feet. * Tho map and chart are the same as for Gwadar District q,v. The chart contains a view of Gwadar Head. t The climate of Gwadar is described in the Foreign Proceedings of the Gorernment of India for February 1880.590 GWADAR TOWN Formerly Gwadar was the cliief port of Makran and the trade from Persian as well as British Makran gravitated to it, but since the eonstrnction of the bridle-path from Pasni to Tnrbat and Panjgur nearly the whole trade of Makran has found its way to Pasiii ; which is fast increasing at the expense of Gwadar. Gwadar is a fortnightly port of call of the British India Steam Navigation Company^ steamers. There is a combined post and tele graph office, located in a building belonging to the Indo-European Telegraph Department at the north-east side of the town, near which is the British political bungalow. The authority of the Sultan of 'Oman is repressented by a Wali and 20 ^Askaris. Gwatar Bay is a great indentation in the Makran coast line at the point where Persian territory ends and Kalat territory begins : the bay is about equally divided between the Persian and British spheres of influence. At the entrance the width is 19 miles and within it is somewhat less; the depth inwards is about 11 miles and the whole area of the baj is entirely open to the south : the bottom is of mud, very flat and even. The soundings, which are 6 fathoms in the entrance; begin fco diminish at half way towards the foot of the bay, and thereafter they shoal regularly to the low swampy coast which forms its northern shore; the land on the east and west sides of the bay is rocky and hilly, and on the west side it rises to a tableland from 300 to 400 feet in height. With the eastern half of the bay, which lies in Baluchistan, we are not concerned : the chief feature of the remainder is the Dashtyari Chil , a river, which, coming down from Bahu, the capital of the Bahu district, and passing 4 miles to the east of Mir Bazar, the capital of the Dashtyari district, enters the bay at its north-western corner. On the west coast of the bay, 3 miles south of the estuary of this river, is the village of Gwatar ; it consists of about 200 mat huts. There are two mosques built of mud. The inhabitants, who belong to the Maid tribe, number about 1,000 souls and are nearly all fisher men. There are 10 Hindu traders, unaccompanied by their families, and * A plan of the bay is given as an inset in Chart No. 2383—38, Maskat to KarachhJIABL 591 28 Khojlias, both men and women ; these are all British subjects. Ship- ping comprises 4* seagoing boats, called Safri Bojis , of about 75 tons burden each and carrying crews of 8 to 20 men; also 22 fishermen's boats calledjGazdanis 'S of 10 to 20 tons burden, and 4 smaller boats called Yakdars jUXj . The trade of Gwatar, which is one of the three principal ports of Per sian Makran, formerly nearly equalled that of Chabbar ; but it is at present hampered by disturbances in the interior, and the value of the annual exports does not now exceed Es. 50,000, nor that of the annual imports Rs. 30,000. The Persian Imperial Customs Department is re presented here by a Mudir assisted by three Baluchi guards. Gwatar is in the district of the Bahu chief. In the ''Oman Sultanate two contiguous villages, known as ^Ain and HABIB 'Agar, situated in Wadi Bani Habib in Jabal Akhdhar, about 16 miles (BANI)* north-north-west of Tanuf. The elevation above the sea is about 6,200 feet. The place consists altogether of about 40 houses of the A1 Bu Shamis section of the NVim tribe. The dwellings are small and stand about half-way down one slope of the Wadi. Both sides of the valley are laid out in terraces and planted with pomegranates, figs, peaches, apricots, walnuts, and sweet limes. A little wheat and barley is grown, and the hills are covered with vines. There are about 15 camels, 15 donkeys, 20 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. # For a view of this plaoa see page 60. HABL An irregularly shaped and extensive tract of desert country in the Sanjaq of Hasa : its position may be approximately defined by saying that its centre lies about 7 0 miles inland, in a west-south-westerly direc tion, from the coast town of Qatlf, boundaries.—-Hahl is described as somewhat resembling in outline a smokers pipe, with the stem running from north-north-east to south-692 HABL *■— south-west and the bowl^ which is at the south end, turned to the west • still observing the terms of this metaphor we may say that stem and bowl combined are 80 miles in length, while the stem is about 15 miles in diameter and the bowl has a depth (from west to east) of 50 and a diameter (from north to south) of 30 miles. On the north the Habl tract may be regarded as bounded by Sanfan-al-Hannaj —which however some authorities would include in it;—and from Jabal Labtalah at the southern apex of Sanfan-al-Hannaj the boundary between Habl on the east and Wadi-al -Miyah. on the west runs direct to Jabal Qadam, At this last point the boundary of Habl turns west and runs along the southern end of Wadi-al -Miyah. to the Taff hills which it follows southwards to Naslatain-al-Farha ; one of the spurs of that system; it then goes eastwards, defining the extent of Habl to the south and separating it, between Naslatain-al-Farha and Jabal Mathluth, from the Taff plain tract, and, between Jabal Mathluth and Jabal Dam, from the tract of Jau-as -Sa'adan. At Jabal Dam the line takes a northerly direction and becomes the eastern border of Habl, the adjoining tract on this side being Biyadh until the southern end of Jau Shamin is reached; to exclude that district the line turns westwards for some miles and then resumes its northerly course which finally ends at the point of junction of the regions of Habl, Sanfan-al-Hanna, Radaif and Jau Shamin, that is at the well of Hajrah. It should be noted that some Bedouins would include the south-western part of Habl, which lies beyond Jabal Qadam, in Wadi-at -Miyah ; but this view does not appear to command general acceptance. Physical char act eristics and divisions.—lAakA is described as an expanse of dark-coloured sand in which mounds alternate with low valleys j the hollows are full of the tree called Markh and the shrub known as Ghadha, besides which they produce Arfaj and Rimth bushes and Nasi, Subat and Thamam grass. Wells however are few and far between, and they are much deeper than those of Jauf, a tract which Habl in other lespects resembles. In the extreme west of the tract, immediately before the Taff hills are reached, is a bare stretch of heavy sand styled Jau-al- Ghanam ^UJl ^ • and near the centre of the tract is a large salin depression commonly known as Khor ^ of which the position is more exactly fixed by the wells that it contains, viz., Umm -al-Qah and Himaiah. Two hills in the district are GhumTs ,10 miles north of Jabal Mathluth, and Qaburah which lies 17 miles westwards of the northern extremity of Jabal Dam.HABL 593 IVells. —The principal wells in Habl are these ;— Name, Abwab vW , , iilaimiyah 'stem j il nomtle Ariq ■fcii and h Haba-i jnseti Shi, W' Habaiyah ad Jakl conuml Hafairah id asi ^ La,.ah towli SjUo. nd Nasi bet#, liiotb p galMusallakh f 1 Qah (Khor Umm-al-) -UJ) J )y Position.

Singular Habsi A tribe of Yamani race, in politics Ilinawi and in religion Ibadhi; they inhabit the western part of tbe Sharqiyah district of the 'Oman Sultanate known as Baldan-al -Habus, possess the villages of Wafi and Mutaili' in Wadi 'Andaill) and are found at Manah in 'Oman Proper and in Wadi Mi'aidin. Their principal divisions are :— Section, Fighting strength. Habitat. Remaeks- 'Abdu ('Ay§l) 100 Manah. Nil. 'Asirah 100 Sharqiyah villages, especi ally Mudhaibi. Do.596 HABtTS The chief villages and towns inhabited by the Habus may be ascer tained by reference to the articles on the Sllcirciiy&lt;lll district and Wadi Samad. There is no reliable estimate of their number but it may be placed provisionally at 7_,000 souls. The Habus are a wild^ uncivilised tribe, less wealthy and important than their neighbours, the Hirth and Hajriyin : such influence as they possess depends on their numbers rather than on their character. They are principally engaged in date cultivation^ but are also camel-owners. They have now many rifles of various cheap kinds (1905) and maintain an offensive and defensive alliance with the HirtL The small'Warud tribe is tributary to the Habus. The principal Shaikhs of the Habus (1905) are Salim-bin-Hamaid, Ghananami ; and Mas'ad-bin-Rasbid, Jabiri. Mudhaibi is the political headquarters of the tribe, but Rodhali in Wadi Samad is their largest settlement. A village in the Sultanate of 'Oman, situated at the foot of Khor-al- Hajar, and about one mile inland in a south-westerly direction from Ras- al-Hadd, the low sandy point which marks the entrance of the Gulf of 'Oman and is almost the easternmost point in Arabia. Hadd is 16 miles east by south of Sur and may be reckoned as belonging to tbe coast of the Eastern Hajar District. The village stands in a sandy plain and consists of over 200 habita tions, some of which are of mud. but most of date branches; it boasts a stone fort, three or four round towers, and some date trees. The water- supply is fairly good but not very abundant. The inhabitants of Hadd belong to the Muwalikh tribe ; they live by fishing and possess 8 Badans and 15 small boats; about 30 sheep and goats constitute the whole of their livestock. The cod and other rock-fish here are of the largest size, sometimes almost gigantic. The authority of the Sultan of 'Oman at Hadd is marked by the presence of a detachment of 15 ''Askaris, commanded by a Jamadar under the orders of the Wali of Sur ; and for purposes of revenue and taxation Hadd is treated as subordinate to Sur. KABD (I) I HADD (II) ^ t( wn on the south-eastern point of Muharraq Island in Bahrain It covers the narrow promontory for a distance of about f of a mile, and at high tide is only comaeeted with Muharraq Island by a neck of landHAFAR 597 400 yards wide. There are a number of well-built masonry liouses ; perhaps £00 ; and a very much greater number of mud and stone houses and mat huts, perhaps 700 of each. The water supply is from wells in a date grove called Zimmah ^ a mile to the north. The people are Sunnis, chiefly Sadah (150 houses) and Al Bin -^Ali and Al Bu Falasah (Bani Yas) (200 houses); after each of whom a quarter is named : there are also 20 houses of Huwalah^ 10 of Al Bu Kuwarah, 10 of Sudan, 10 of Manana'ah and 1 or 2 of Al Musallam, and a fourth division of the town is called Fan(j-al-Musallam. The total population is estimated at 8,000 souls. Shops only number 5 or 6. Next to Muharraq Town this is the greatest pearl diving place in Bahrain, and to it belong 167 pearl boats; vessels of all sorts are 3 Batils/42 Baqarahs, 183 Shu'ais and Sambuks and 21 Mashuwahs and jollyboats. There are 2 horses, 110 donkeys and 35 cattle. No dates are grown, there being no space for plantations, but the grove at Zimmah belongs to Hadd. The islet and spring of Abu Shahm lie 1 mile south-east of Hadd. A small hamlet on the west coast of Qatar about 3 miles north of HADIYAH Zubarah. It consists of about four houses, merely, of the Kibisah tribe. ^ An important halting place and group of wells in the Batin section of HAFAE Wadi-ar -Rummah, near the point where it leaves Dah^nah and reaches Dibdibah. Hafar lies about 160 miles west-south-west of Kuwait Town, from which it is reached in from 3 to 5 stages. The wells of Hafar are about 40 in number, but at the present time only 11 are ' alive/'' that is to say, yield water. They are scattered in the bed of the Batin, which here forms a circular plain about 3 miles in diameter, at intervals of 100 yards to J of a mile apart ; each well is in the centre of a mound, about 10 feet high, which has been formed by the spoil removed from it. The wells are lined with rough stone masonry and are about 6 feet across at the top; their average depth is about 150 feet to water^ but if left undisturbed for a time the level rises by about 30 feefc. The water they contain is almost tepid, and in the chilly air of morning vapour can be seen rising from their mouths. South by east from the wells, between them and the right bank of the Bat in, is a Ions', low, sandy hill.598 HAFAR No firewood is available in the immediate vicinity and tlie only fuel at hand is camel dung. The Mutair, Dhafir and various tribes o£ Kuwait territory make some use or these wells ; and they would be more frequented if they were of a less inconvenient depth. Hafar is one of the recognised stages on the route to Qasim via the Batiu from Kuwait Town and Basrah, and the place marks approximately the frontier on this side between Kuwait and Jabal Shammar ; at times, in the course of the recent wars, it has been held by the Shaikh and at times by the Amir. At Hafar two hollows join the Bat ill; one apparently coming from due north and the other from due south; the former is called Falaij-asli- m Sham ally ah ^ and leads to a line of wells styled Atwal-adh- Dhafir ^iuaJ) running northwards, of which the first is w I Dalaimiyeh ; the other hollow, named Falaij-al-Janubiyah conducts similarly to a line of wells having a southerly direction and known as Atwal-al-Mutair of which the first is Safah in Summan: the wells of each of these series are said to lie from 2 to 3 days^ marcli apart. The true Haffar is a tract on the right bank of the Karun river begin- SAFFAIt n - n g 7 miles above Muhammareh Town and ending about 1 mile above the point of divergence of the Karun and Bahmanshir ; it contains the riverside villages of Ramsan, Askaleh, Bu Mahsin, Bu Charim, Muqamiseh and Umm-at-Talul. From this reach the name has been transferred, possibly by the native pilots of European vessels, to a lower one; and it is now commonly but erroneously applied by geographers to the last two or three miles of the course of the Karun, those namely between the point where the Bahmanshir leaves it and the place where it enters the Shatt-al -'Arab. Such an application of the term is in no way sanctioned by local usage; and it has been particularly ascertained that residents of Muhammareh Town, though they sometimes call the Karun where it flows past their walls the a Eahmanshir/'' thus giving rise to confusion on a different point, never speak of it as the ' Haffar ;; . The villages of the true Haffar are described in the article on MuhaiH- mareh District and those of the so-called Haffar in the articles on Muhaflmareh District and 'Abbadan island.(g) HAI TOWN 599 A division of the Muntafik Sanjaq of the Basrah Wilayat in Turkish HAI 'Iraq. ^ Position and boundaries,- —The Qadha of Hai is situated on both sides QADHA of the Shatt-al-Grharafj the river which connects the Tigris transversely with the Euphrates, in the upper half of its course. The district is apparently enclosed between the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah on the north, that of ^Amarali on the east^ that of Shatrat-al-Muntafik on the south and that of Diwaniyah. on the west. Topography and inhabitants. —Besides the town of Hal and the villages of Qal^at Sikar and Mhairijah^ the two first of which are the subjects of separate articles while the last is noticed in the article on the Shatt-al-Gharaf, there are no places of importance in the Qadha. The only conspicuous natural feature is the Shatt-al-Gharaf. The dominant tribes are the Muiltafik in the southern and the Bani Rabrah in the northern part of the district j and the tribe of Bani Hashim are found in the neighbourhood of Qal'at Sikar. Population. —The total fixed population is estimated at 44,000 souls^ of whom at least 4j2 ; 000 are Shi^ah Arabs, while about 1,500 are Sunnis, and there are perhaps 500 Jews. The last two classes are not found in any number outside the town of Hai. Resources, —The district is dry and healthy, and the crops and live stock are such as can flourish without a superfluity of moisture. The staples of production and trade are wheat ; barley, millet, maize, sesame, dates, ghi ; wool, skins and hides. Administration, —The Qadha of Hai is subdivided into 3 Nahiyahs, namely the Markaz Nahiyah of Hai, that of Qal'at Sikar, and that of Mhairijah ; the seats of the Mudirs of the last two are the villages similarly named. A town situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Gharaf about 30 miles HAI from its head opposite Kut-al-Amarah : it is the chief place in the Qadha ^ of the same name in Turkish 'Iraq. About two-thirds of the town TOWN consists of brick houses and the rest of huts. The'population is 4,000 or souls, of whom three-fourths are Shi'ahs : but there is a considerable K.TJT-AL- . • • • • TT AT Jewish community, which maintains a Jewish school, besides about 100 j households of Paili Kurds. The surrounding Arabs belong to the Sarai ^ ^ section of the Bani Rabi'ah tribe. The neighbourhood of Hai prodaces600 HAI TOWN wheats barley^ millet, maize ; sesame and some dates ; the export trade is chiefly in these and in pastoral produce such as ghi^ wool^ skins and hides. There is a bazaar of about 300 shops. Hai is the seat of a Qaim- Maqanij and possesses a branch of the Public Debt Office^ a customs housej telegraph and post offices and several Khans and public baths. A har bour master is common to this place and Shatrat-al-Muntafik Town. The telegraphic connection is with Kut-al-Amarah. The town is con stituted as a municipality. The garrison ordinarily consists of 1 squadron of cavalry and a battalion of infantry^ for whom there are barracks and a military hospital : a captain and five lieutenants of the Hadif also are posted here ; and about 100 reservists belong to this centre, which does not however appear in the general scheme of distribution of the Eadif. The climate of Hai is dry and healthy. HAIL Tlie cai)ital of tlie Shammar province of Central Arabia j it is JJU situated about 400 miles west-south-west of Basrah, 350 miles north west by west of Biyadh, 450 miles north-north-east of Makkah and 500 miles south-east of Jerusalem; its elevation above the sea is 3 ; 530 feet. * Site and surroundings* —Hail lies in the plain called Batn on the open Valley of W adi Da^aijan, and is overlooked by the cliffs of Jabal Aja, which rise 1,000 feet high about 3 miles to the westward. The town is enclosed on its north and east sides by Jabal Samra 1;^., a double hill of dark- coloured plutonic basalt; Umm Arkab the eastern eminence, with its summit 3,990 feet above the sea, is the higher of the two, and between it and its neighbour passes Wadi Da^aijan on its way beyond Hail to the open desert. A basaltic ridge, 300 feet high at the loftiest part, connects Jabal Aj a with J abal Samra, screening Hail from view from the northward; this ridge is crossed by a pass with an elevation of about 60 feet. Hail, though as a whole unwalled, is a town, not an oasis j but on the south and west date palms are so numerous as largely to conceal the houses. Quarters and streets. —-In shape the town is roughly a parallelogram with one of its longer sides upon Wadi Da^aijan, which passes it upon the As deduced by Lieut. P. Fraser Hunter from Huber's observations (see footnote to article Jabal Shammar).HAIL 601 north * The quarters of the town, roughly in order from west to east, are Samah Barzan Sabhan ^ Abid cyyc, Lubdah Maghithah , 'Atiq Jabarah Jarad ^1^, Qaraishi Rakhls u^h^)) Faraikh , Dhuba^an c / Ua ^ 5 Ziqidi ls ^ j , and Wasaitah ; and there are to the east two detached quarters or villages named Kharaimi an( ^ Suwaiflah , Barzan, Lubdah and Maghithah are the largest of the wards. Barzan contains the Qasr or fortified palace of the Amir of Jabal Shammar; Lubdah contains the principal bazaar. Wasaitah is a small quarter, with a large date plantation; it is situated opposite to the rest of the town, on the further side of Wadi Da^aijan and under the northern portion of Jabal Samra. For some time about 1878 Wasaitah remained uninhabited, having been depopulated by an epidemic of cholera, probably that of 1871: it is adjoined by the common cemetery of Hail. At Kharaimi is a large date plantation, watered by springs, which is the property of the Amir. Suwaiflah is about 2 miles north east from the main body of the town, and beyond Jabal Samra j it also was devastated by the epidemic which temporarily ruined Wasaitah and is still deserted. The main place of the town is the Mis-hab &gt; 250 yards long by 25 broad, on one side of which is the Amir's Qasr, while opposite is a row of rooms, called Makhazin where the guests of the Amir are lodged. At the south eud of the Makbazin is an enclosure set apart for female stall-keepers who deal in ornaments, perfumes, female attire, dates and vegetables ; and immediately beyond this enclosure is the head of the main bazaar, locally called Mabi^ which is a continuation of the Mis-hab 200 yards in length and contains about 140 shops. These shops are the property of the Amir and are rented from him. The chief mosque of Hail stands at the south end of the Mis-hab. Buildings. —The houses of Hail have often an upper storey and are built of small sun-dried bricks and date or Ithl timber; the coffee rooms and the guests^ quarters pertaining to them are usually in an adjoining quad rangle with a separate entrance. Rooms, which are ordinaiily few but large and commodious, are lighted only by the door^ways and by un- glazed openings in the walls just below the ceilings. The general view of the town is not imposing. The only large building is the Amir's Qasr ? built of clay and overlaid with white gypsum plaster; part of it rises to a height of 40 feet. Only the quarters containing the palace * A plan of Hail will be found in Palgrave (I. 139), a plan of part of the town adjoining the Qasr in Doughty (I. 587), and a plan of the environs in Doughty (I. 615). There is also an unBnUhed sketch plan at the end of Huber's Journal de Voyage.602 HAIL and the main bazaar are enclosed; and tlie walls surrounding tliem are o£ no great height. The gates of the walled quarters are kept closed at night. Population. —The size of Hail is small in proportion to its political importance; it seems clear that the population does not exceed 3,000 souls. It is composed of agriculturists, tradesmen, men-at-arms and household slaves ; the last are not numerous. The people are mainly Shammar, but among them are some natives of Qasim besides Gallas and a few Persians. The typical Hail townsman is of slender build. All classes and both sexes wear next their skins the Haqu, a plaited leather belt, and in this they resemble the Arabs of the desert. Pood is universally served on the floor and, contrary to the practice of Jauf-aVAmir and other northern places it is exposed for sale in open markets. The morals of Hail are reputed lax. There are four ordinary schools. Trade and industries. —The commerce of the town is small and its manufactures are few. The butchers' trade is considered degrading and the cook-shops in the bazaar are mostly kept by Persians. The shopkeepers are generally natives of Najaf, Qasim or Madinah. Cloth, calico, spices, metals and European goods are imported from Basrah, Najaf and Madinah; corn from Suq-ash-Shuyukh. Artisans are not many; they belong to the smiths' caste and their implements are few and clumsy j nevertheless copperware, spear-heads, and horse-shoes are manufactured, wooden bowls are turned, and camel-saddles are built. There are a few house builders and gypsum plasterers. Women embroiderers in silk and metal-thread do a small business. The largest trading capital in Hail probably does not exceed £300. BiijOjoties, —Ordinary supplies are obtainable. There are the ordinary livestock, also horses and riding camels, but home-grown dates are not very abundant and stocks are imported from Qasim. Wood and grass are mostly collected by Qasimi labourers, and the town has many wells of 10 to 15 fathoms^ depth; but, with the exception of one sweet well of 15 fathoms belonging to the Samah quarter, they are either bitter or saline. General. —The present town of Hail is probably of late foundation, A more ancient town is said to have existed to the east of modern Hall and to have included Suwaiflah. Hail has risen to importance chiefly as the permanent residence of the Amirs of Jabal Shammar. When the fortunes of Ibn Rashid were in the ascendant there was much going and coming of strangers and the Amir entertained about 180 guests a day at an annual expense of about £1 ,500. Hail in time past also derived much14 ki HAIYADH 603 profit from the transit o£ Persian pilgrim caravans on their way to and from Makkah^ but in recent years the route has been to a great extent in abeyance owing to the incessant wars and prevailing insecurity. ill A sandy locality with date plantations^ on the coast of Trucial ; 0man, on the boundary between the principalities of Sharjah and Dibai. It lies a short distance south-west of Khail; from which it is divided by the Khan creeks and is miles from Sharjah Town and 5 miles from the town of Dibai. In the date season it is occupied by people from both Khan and Dibai : at other times it is uninhabited. HAIL (ABU) A flourishing village of about 60 houses in the Sultanate of ^Oman HAIlrAli on the western side of Wadi Tayin at a place^ about 7 miles from the coast ; where it widens before leaving the hills. There is an unfailing supply of water brought by a Falaj from the hills. The inhabitants are Al Bu Sa'ld, Bani Battash and other tribes. There is extensive cultivation of dates and other crops ; and olives and mangoes flourish. Livestock are 20 donkeys, 25 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Hail-al-Ghaf was founded early in the 19th century by Saiyid Khalfan^ an Al Bu Sa^idi, who was a conspicuous Anglophile in his day. The land was purchased from the Bani Battash, who as late as 1884 still exercised a sort of protectorate over the place. GHAr A place in Wadi-al-Hilti in the Western Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate; it is situated upon the right bank about 3 miles above the exit of the valley from the hills. The village consists of only 30 houses of the J ahawar and Shabul tribes ; but it contains a fort which is in the possession of the Sultan of 'Oman and is the only point held by him in this part of Western Hajar : the garrison of the fort consists of 10 'Askaris. A few dates and a little grain are grown, and the livestock of the village comprises 6 camels, 10 donkeys, 5 cattle and 300 goats and sheep* HAIYAD uu H604 HA JAR HAJAR Also called, in plural form, Hujur A remarkable hilly tract or ran ge of the mountains in the Sultanate of 'Oman, extending from Shinas on the north-west to Sur on the south-east; it is nowhere far dis tant from the coast, and east of Masqat Town it closely adjoins the sea. Hajar in the aggregate forms one of the most extensive districts in the 'Oman Sultanate; for, while its breadth varies from 20 to 50 miles, its length exceeds that of any other two districts together. According to native ideas the Hajar is all one; but for convenience we may divide it at Wadi Sam ail (including that valley and its affluents in the eastern portion) and deal with it in two articles under the names of Eastern and Western Hajar« HAJAR These are ancient names which have not entirely died out but have become somewhat indefinite in their application The accepted view is and that Hajar originally referred to the oasis of Hasa and that Khatt Hajar KHATT designated the coastal tract from Has Tanurah. to Dohat Salwa and there- HAJAE £ ore deluded the Qatif Oasis, Barr-adh -Dhahran, Barr-al -'Oqair and Barr- lai. al -Qarah.- It is said that the whole of this littoral was once thickly popu lated: but now, except the Qatif Oasis, Khatt-al-Hajar is a desert. The name is sometimes given as Khatt Hajar-al-Bahrain ; and this corrobo rates a hypothesis, founded partly on other facts, that the name Bahrain was once applied to a part of the mainland as well as to the archipelago which now bears it. The article on the Hajar division of the 'Oman Sultanate contains a HAJAE. general definition of the whole tract so named; we now proceed to (EAST- describe in detail the eastern portion whicli 'we have arbitrarily separated ERNJ * from the rest. Limits and extent. —The Eastern Hajar of 'Oman extends about 120 miles from Wadi Samail and its tributaries on the north-west to the Jabal Kh a mis range on the south-east, both of which it includes. Its watershed, continuous with the watershed of Western Hajar to which it is linked by the Najd-al-Mughbariyah, is 50 miles distant from the coast at the head of Wadi Samail and thence runs at first almost due east to a point 40 miles south-south-west of Masqat Town : beyond this place its direction is from north-west to south-east and the distance between # For authorities, maps and charts see first footnote to article 'Oman Sultanate.HAJAR (EASTERN) 605 it and the coast dimmislies^ being- ultimately reduced at its termination near Sur to about 20 miles. The disposition of the valleys and ridges of Eastern Ha jar with reference to the main axis of the range is very imperfectly understood but it is probably less regular than in Western Hajar: Wadi Tayin^ for instance^ in its upper course runs parallel to the general direction of the range instead of at right angles to it^ an eccentricity which has no counterpart in Western Hajar. Between Daghmar and Sur the hills of Eastern Hajar fall directly into the sea ; and beyond the aspect which they present seawards nothing is known of them in this part: where they are crossed by the route from Sur to Ja^alan they have been partially surveyed. Little is known ; similarly, of the inland flank of Eastern Hajar except that it forms the boundary upon the north of the interior districts of Ja^alan and Sharqiyah. The uncertainty as to the position of the inland border of Eastern Hajar makes it impossible to estimate the whole breadth of the district with accuracy, but it probably varies from 30 to 40 miles. The hills of Eastern Hajar are fairly constant in elevation from the north-west end, where they reach 5,250 feet at the head of Wadi Tayxn and 6,300 feet inland of Quryat, to the south-east as far as Jabal Khadhar : beyond this point they fall away to 2,845 feet in the Jabal KhamiS range behind Sur. Configuration and features. —The principal feature of the north western and only explored part of Eastern Hajar is Wadi Tayin, which, running at first between two important ridges of the Hajar system, Jabal Baidha and Jabal Sauda, turns suddenly at right angles to burst through a remarkable canon and debouch on the coast at Daghmar. Immediately to the north-west of Wadi Tayin^ near the sea, is Wadi B«ni Battaslu In proceeding south-eastwards Wadi Tayin is followed, still on the seaward side of the hills, by a group of three valleys included under the common name of Wadi Bani Jabir (I) : they are Wadi Shab* Wadi Tiwi and Wadi Hilam^ which reach the sea at Ghail-ash-Shab 5 Tiwi and Kalhat respectively. The only remaining valley of impor tance on this side of the range is Wadi Falaij^ which has its mouth near Sur, and is enclosed between the parallel ranges of Khadhar and Khamis, the two easternmost members of the Hajar system and dispos ed at right angles to the main range. As already remarked, the inward slopes of Eastern Hajar are prac tically unknown, but they are probably less abrupt than the outward606 HAJAR (EASTERN) face; on this inner side three Wadis ; called Mahram, ? Andam and Samad, ran down^ the last by Samad town ; to the western end of the Sharqiyah district^ Wadi 'Andam (of which the other two are tribu taries), eventually joining Wadi Halfain; while Wadi Bani Khalid descends south-eastwards to the Ja'alan plain. The Eastern Hajar consists, so far as is known, of limestone; with reference to this point the geological Appendix may be consulted.

The following is an estimate of the settled population of the Eastern Hajar district:— Wadi-al-'Aqq ..... 1,500 Wadi Bani Battash .... # # 3,000 Wadi Dima # % 4,500 Wadi Falaij 500 Wadi Hilam (excluding Kalhat) 2,100 Wadi Bani Jabir (I) . . , . # # 9,000 Wadi Khabbah ..... 1,900 Jabal Khadhar # # 1,700 Wadi Bani Khalid . . , . • • 6,400 Wadi Mansah and its tributary Wadi Rak • • 3,900 Wadi Saijani 850 Wadi Samail and its tributary Wadi Dhaba'un # % 30,000 Wadi Shab (excluding Ghail-ash-Shab) # 250 Wadi Tayin (excluding Daghmar) # # 8,600 Wadi Tiwi (excluding Tiwi) . , # % 2,200 Places on the coast (see 1st table in paragraph on Copography above) ...... 20,900 Miscellaneous places (see 2nd table in paragraph on Topography above) • 1,100 Total • • 98,400 souls The Bedouins of the district are Bani Bu Hasan, Hishm and Aulad Kasib : their number is uncertain. Products and animals. —Our knowledge of Eastern Hajar as a whole is too incomplete to admit of a general account being given of its vegetable and animal products or agriculture. The facts that are known will be found in the articles on the particular valleys and places which have already been indicated. Administration, ■— Except at Quryat and Sur upon the coast, the Sultan of Oman has at present no representatives and very little influence in Eastern Hajar: the whole interior of the district is virtu ally independent.HAJAR (WESTERN) 609 An mlet on the coast of the 'Oman Sultanate, 2| miles west of Ras-al- HAJARI Hadd and about the same distance east of the entrance of Khor-al- (KHOR- Jaramah. The entrance to Khor-al-Hajar is i of a mile wide and lies AL-) between low cliffs; the inlet runs inland for | of a mile in a south-south- ^ easterly direction and then opens eastwards into a large shallow basin which extends for more than a mile to the east, almost reaching Hadd Town. The entrance is open to the north and its depth rapidly diminishes lali from 3^ to I2 fathoms, while the inner basin is altogether dry at low- water spring-tides. It follows that Khor-al-Hajar is of little value even isfen for the smallest vessels and is not used except by fishing-boats. Disputes similar to those affecting Khar-al -Jaramah occurred in regard to this inlet between 1877 and 1880. asi ERN) This is a division, arbitrarily formed to facilitate description, of the HAJARt Hajar region of the ; 0man Sultanate. (WEST- Boundaries and extent.— Western Hajar district reaches from Wadi- al -Qor on the north-west to Wadi Samail on the south-east, and has thus a length of 160 miles approximately Its watershed is roughly parallel to the Batinah coast and runs at an average distance of 40 miles inland; the distance however is greater than this towards the extremities and less towards the centre where the sea-coast curves inwards slightly towards the mountains. The boundary of Western Hajar on the seaward side is the line along which its hills subside into the Batinah plain at a distance, on the average, of some 15 miles from the sea. The boundary with Dhahirah on the inland side is somewhat indefinite, the decline being more gradual than on the seaward face : the valleys on this side up to their heads are generally reckoned in the district of Dhahirah j but the Hajar hills undoubtedly extend south-westward to the immediate neighbourhood of 'Ibri and Dhank Town. Including therefore, for the moment, in Hajar the t' 51 slopes which are ordinarily considered a part of Dhahirah, we may say that wli the Western Hajar has an average breadth of 40 to 50 miles. I Configuration and general characteristics. —The physical geography g ( of Western Hajar appears to be simple and regular. Its axis runs * Admiralty plan No. 2371—228 contains a delineation of this inlet on a large scale ; also a view of the adjoining coast. t For authorities, map and charts, wee first footnote to article 'Oman Sultanate. % K610 HAJAR (WESTERN) north-west and south-east and the valleys to which its slopes give birth run off at right angles on both sides, those on the north-east to Batinah and those on the south-west to Dhahirah and ; 0maix Proper. The highest portion of Western Hajar is a considerable block at the south -east end which is called Jabal Akhdhar; Jabal Akhdhar reaches an elevation of nearly 10^000 feet, but the remainder of the range to the north -west is considerably less and at the head of Wadi-al -Jizi, perhaps the lowest point, it is only 1,860 feet. The chief valleys which run down from Western Hajar across Batinah to the sea are^ in order from east to west, as follow: Wadi Tan; Wadi Lajal; Wadi Ma'awal; Wadi Bani Kharus (near the coast called Wadi-al-Qasim) with'its eastern affluent Wadi Mistal; W r adiBani 'Auf; Wadi Fara'' or Rustaq; Wadi Bani Ghafir (in Batinah styled Wadi. al-Hoqain) with its right bank tributary Wadi Sahtan; WadiMabrah; Wadi-al -Hawasinah with its tributary from the west, Wadi Bani 'Umr; Wadi Shafan j Wadi Sarrami; Wadi 'Ahin; Wadi-al -Hilti; Wadi-al -Jizi; Wadi Bani ; Umr-al-Gharbi; Wadi Hatta and Wadi-al- Qor. There is also a Wadi called Faidh in the neighbourhood of Shinas Town. Proceeding next from west to east along the inland slopes of Western Hajar, we find that the range sends down Wadis Dhank and Kabir to Dhahirah and Wadis Tanuf and Mi'aidin to ^Oman Proper. The Western Hajar is a limestone range and its geological character is noticed in the Appendix on geology. The Jabal Akhdhar portion is fully described under its own name: the remainder is generally very peaked and sharp ridged^ with some herbaceous but very little ligneous vegetation. Trees and plants include Samar^ acacia arabica, rhamnus^ screw-pine, oleander, calotropis^ euphorbia^ castor-oil plant, wild lavender, a kind of rush called Rasal J-w;, used for mat-making, and a plant named ib Marannahah bearing a fruit like a small bitter lime, of which the seeds, administered in food or drink, cause stupefaction. Birds are few in Western Hajar; ravine deer and foxes are among the commoner animals. Villages and population.—The articles on the Wadis of Western Hajar, a list of which is given in the preceding paragraph, contain full information regarding the tribes who inhabit Western Hajar, their Tillages and their mode of life. To complete the topography of612 HAJAR (WESTERN) There are some Bedouins also in Western Hajar belonging to tlie Biduwat, Hawasinah and Bani Kharus tribes. Administration, —The authority of the Sultan of 'Oman over Western Hajar is slight. The only places there held in his name are Nakhl, where he is represented by a Wali^ and 'Awabi, Hlbi and Haiyadh, at each of which, as also at Mizahit in Wadi Fara' and Burj-ash-Shikairi in Wadi-al-Jizi, there is a fort in his possession. HAJIR A nomadic Arab tribe of Eastern Arabia. By Bedouins the name is (BANI) generally pronounced Bani Hayir and Huwayir; the singular is rl ajiri or •• huwajir Distribution, —The Bani Hajir are mostly found in one part or another of the Hasa Sanjaq, but they have not exclusive possession of any- particular territory, excepting only a considerable portion of Qatar which is occupied by their Makhadhdhabah division ; they are accustomed to obtain Rafiqs from the ^Ajman, under whose auspices they wander dispersed in the country of that tribe. The Bani Hajir sometimes camp as far south as Khor-al-^Odaid, and in the opposite direction they pay occasional visits to the dominions of the Shaikh of Kuwait ; some also appear annually at 'Anik in the Qatlf Oasis. Settled Bani Hajir, now altogether unconnected with the tribe, are said to be found at Wusailah in the Aflaj District and at Haraimlah and Thadiq in the 'Aridh District of Southern Najd. Arabs claiming to be Bani Hajir are found on the Persian Coast, e.g., in the Rud-hilleli District, Religion, character and mode of life, —The Bani Hajir are Hanbali Sunnis. In character they are lawless, troublesome, mischievous and un civilised ; but in their favour it is stated that they are enterprising and of a humourous disposition, and they are said to show some respect for engagements and promises. Their women enjoy considerable liberty. Though they have no vessels of their own the Bani Hajir are addicted to piracy, which they carry on by means of boats temporarily seized from the coast villages of other tribes. Their principal occupations however are pastoral, and they live chiefly by their flocks and herds and by the breeding of horses and camels ; but they also own a number of small date groves in Barr-al-'Oqair and Barr-adh-Dhahran, and the palms atHAJBITlN 61 The total fighting strength of the Bani Hajir is thus about 1 ,500 men, of whom 650 belong to the Makhadhdhabah and 850 are of the A1 Muhammad section; and the number of the whole tribe probablj amounts to some 5^000 souls. Political condition* —The two great divisions of the Bani Hajii^ namely, the Mukhadhdhabah and the A1 Muhammad, are ordinarily at enmity with one another, and this is the case at the present time; there is consequently no paramount Shaikh of the whole tribe. It is understood that the leading men of the Bani Hajir, receiving as they do allowances from the Turkish Mutasarrif of Hasa and presents from the Shaikh of Kuwait and the A1 Thani Shaikhs of Qatar^ are inclined to regard themselves as independent of all authority ; but the payment by them of Zakat to the Wahhabi Amir is regarded as a not impossible contingency of the future. About 1865 the value of their annual con tribution to the Riyadh treasury was estimated at |3,000. Singular Hajari • A tribe of the ^man Sultanate^ Yamani HAJEIYIN by descent, Ibadhi in religion and Hinawi in politics. They inhabit the whole Badiyah division of the Sharqiyah district, are found also at Mudhaibi, and deal with the port of Sur. They have not a good name for honesty and are rapacious and turbulent j nevertheless they are one of the wealthiest and most enterprising communities in this part of the country. They are engaged in cultiva tion and trade and own a number of boats : some of them visit Bombay and Zanzibar. The Hajriyin, though possessing fixed villages, have retained to a considerable extent the tendencies and characteristics of Bedouins. The Hajriyin are now estimated at 7,500 souls and the sub divisions of the tribe are as follows :— Section, Fighting strength.* Villages in Badiyah. R emabks. Baharimali 200 Wasil, Haili and Hatuh, Nil. Baharinah Hababasah 80 Wasil, Dabik and Qa'. Po* • These are apparently somewhat under*estimated.616 HAJRIYIN Section.

Nil. * These are apparently somewhat uader -e ?timated. Wasil is the tribal capital; but the Hajriyin have at present no Tamimah. It was the Hajriym who in 1813 suddenly attacked Mutlaq, the Wahhabi leader^ slew him and expelled his force from the country; Sa^ad, the son of Mutlaq, in revenge completely broke their power, and they have never entirely recovered their former position. HALAIFAH coast village in the 'Adan district of the Kuwait Principality, (ABU) a bont 18 miles south-south-east of Kuwait Town; it consists of about 50 houses and is inhabited by Arabs of miscellaneous origin. There are about 1,000 flourishing date palms and 30 wells containing good water at about 20 feet j but of the latter only 7 yield water for irrigation* Barley, melons and a few vegetables are grown and some Sidar or ber trees are seen. This village, as mentioned in the article on 'Adail, is to some extent a country resort for townsmen of Kuwait. HALFAIN (WADI) ..UU-fiv A valley in 'Oman, probably the longest in that part of Arabia. Its head is di vided from the head of Wadi Samail by the Najd of Mughbariyah only, and it finally reaches the sea at Mahot: its general direction is thus south by east and its length about 185 miles in a straight line. Five miles below the Najd, of which the elevation is ^,400 feet above sea-level, Wadi Halfain passes Muti (2,300 feet) ; 7 miles further on it reaches the town of Izki (^,150 feet), which it divides into twoHALtFL 61V paints; about 10 miles below Izki it passes a group of small villages belonging to the ^Awamir tribe and called collectively Falaj-al-^Awamir some of which are described in the article on 'Oman Proper; below this point it is untenanted except by Bedouins, At Izki the right bank of the Wadi is 200 feet high; but below that town the bed opens out and becomes fiat ; sandy ; and hardly distinguishable from the surrounding desert. It is stated however that after heavy rain its flood water sometimes reaches the sea at Malmt. Wadi Mi'aidin from Jabal Akhdhar joins Wadi Halfain at no great distance below Izki: while further down ; below Duh near Adan^ Wadi Halfain receives Wadi Kalbu on the right bank from 'Oman Proper and, somewhere not far from Sanau, Wadi 'Andam from the Eastern Hajar upon the left. Wadi Halfain, it is said, everywhere contains sweet water near the surface and has pasturage at all seasons. It is the chief highway between the inhabited portion of 'Oman and the South-east Coast; and at one time it was customary to land cargoes of slaves at Mahot and march them by this route to their destination to avoid the risk of capture by British cruisers. An island in the Persian Gulf, about 61 miles east-north-east of HAIitTL Dohah in Qatar. It is about a mile in diameter and consists partly of Jj-^ hills, of which one peak rises to 180 feet; but a considerable portion of its surface is fairly level. There is no fresh water, nor is there grazing even after rain; but some of the fishing grounds in the vicinity are excellent, and the island itself is a favourite breeding place for terns and yields large quantities of their eggs in the season. Pearl boats call here, and fishing vessels take refuge under the lee of Halul in Shamals; the usual anchor age in such cases is on the south-east side, where a quiet berth can be found in 6 fathoms at half a mile from shore, and where there is a natural landing place and boat harbour formed by a gap in the cliffs of the coast- The island is surrounded by a fringe of pearl banks, and about 16 miles north by east of it is a detached pearl bank known as Najwat Bin-Hilal or Riqqat Halul. An intermittent spring of bitumen exists under the sea in the neighbourhood of Halul; but its exact position is uncertain* The political position of Halul appears to be indeterminate; the pearl- divers and fishermen both of Qatar and of Trucial 'Oman are in the habit of resorting to it; and, so far as can be learnt^ no exclusive or618 HALtTL preferential rights are claimed by any of the classes who use it ; or by any territorial chief. HAM ^ valley in Trucial 'Oman which apparently pierces the hills of the (WADI) 'Oman Promontory obliquely from north-west to sonth-east: it has its head in the neighbourhood of the village of Adhan in the Jiri plain^ and after traversing the whole mass of mountains it reaches the sea on the east coast near Fujairah. Its total lengthy windings being followed, seems to be about 85 miles. The lower part of the valley is in Shamailiyah and the upper in Kas-al -Khaimah; both districts of the Sharjah Principality* The following are ; in alphabetical order, the principal villages in 'Wadi Ham or connected with it:— Name.

The route from Fujairah to Dhaid follows Wadi Ham for about | of the way to its head. HAMAD A great desert plain in Northern Arabia to the north-east of 'Wadi Sirhan and to the north of Jauf-al-'Amir ; northwards it reaches as far as the Baghdad -Damascus line, and a small branch of it intervenes between Jauf and the Nafud. The elevation of the last mentioned part above the sea is about 2^220 feet; it is absolutely level and bare of vegetation, a flat black expanse of gravelly soil covered with small round pebbles. The Hamad, where it abuts on Wadi Sirhan near Kaf, in an immense stony plateau, with white calcareous protuberances of remarkable shape; about 45 miles south-east of Kaf a chain of hills called Jabal Misma runs into it north-eastwards from the edge of Wadi Sirhan. HAM AID A. considerable nomad Arab tribe of Southern ^Arabistan ; their range is from the Gargar (in its lower course) and from the Karun (about Naddafiyeh) eastwards as far as Eaghaiweh, and their tribal focus is on or near the Haddam affluent of the Gargar. They are politically allied to the Bawiyeh. The Hamaid own a few camels besides considerable numbers of cattle and large flocks of sheep and goats, but they subsist chiefly by the cultivation of wheat and barley. Their fighting menHAMAID 621 number about 1^700 of wliom some 550 are mounted and nearly 500 are armed with rifles. Some of the Hamaid go to the Shatt-al-'Arab in summer to work in the date plantations there.

Animals are 200 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats. This section have 40 camels, 400 cattle and 10,000 sheep and goats. Possess about 500 cattle and 6,000 sheep and goats. They have 40 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. Their livestock amount to 100 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. The total number of the tribe may be estimated at 6,000 souls. Of the above sections the Kharamizeh alone pay revenue to the Bakhtiyari Chief, the Samsam-as-Saltaneh; the others render tribute, to the amount of about 600 Tumans a year, through Mulla Thani of Naddafiyeh to the Shaikh of Muhammareh. All sections inhabit tents exclusively. The 'Abadat section of the 'Anafijell have now been living with the Hamaid for some years.622 HAMAIDAT HAMAI- Singular Hamaidi A branch of the A1 Subaih section of DAT the Bani Khalld tribe; they are found chiefly at Lusail in Qatar s where they have 50 houses; there are some also at the village of Dha'aiu. The Hamaidat are Maliki Sunnis and live by pearl diving and fishing. In winter they camp in the interior of the peninsula of Qatar with thei? sheep and goats. HAM DAN A town in Turkish ^Iraq on the south side of the Shatt-al^ Arab, about 2 of the way from Basrah to Muhammareh Town ; it is situated miles up a creek of the same name^ of which the entrance is 6£ miles by river below the British Consulate at Basrah and opposite to Yamin on 'Ajairawiyah island. The town stands on both sides of the creek, the portion on the north western bank being however i a mile distant from it. The population of Hamdan is about 11,000 souls, of whom the majority are Muhaisin of the Bait Kana^an section. There are 30 to 40 houses well built of bricks and mud, but the rest of the dwellings are huts. Grazing is good and cattle numerous. Date palms are estimated at 150,000 trees, and livestock at 2,500 cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats, 40 horses and 200 donkeys. Within the Hamdan creek, and so not visible from the Shatt-al-'' Arab, are a tomb visited by Shi^ahs and a shrine respected by Sunnis; the former appears to be a cenotaph, as it is admitted that the Imam Hamzah whom it commemorates neither lived nor died at Hamdan. HAMIDAH A tribe settled in the Ras-ar-Rumman suburb of Manamah town in Bahrain —also known for this reason as Farlq-al-Hamidah—where they have 120 houses. They are an offshoot of the Manaiia^ah but have been converted to Shfism, and they are classed at the present day as Baharinah- Their occupations are sea-fishing and pearl-diving. HAMRA Also called JazTrat-az-Za'ab J ^ n i s ^ an( ^ an ^ village (JAZIRAT- * n principality of Sharjah in Trucial 'Oman, 12 miles west -south- AL-) west of Ras-al -Khahnah Town. It is included in the district of Ras- al -Khaimah. The island,—about 2 miles long, parallel to the coast andHANIFAH (WADI) 623 yery narrow;—is low and sandy, and its south-west end at low-water is nearly connected with the mainland; the creek between the island and the coast is shallow and can be forded in all states of the tide. On the mainland opposite are some red sand hills. The village, which is in the middle of the island, consists of about 500 houses of the Za'ab tribe and is divided into a small quarter called Umm ^Awaimir on the north and a large one called Manakh to the south. The inhabit ants possess about 100 camels, 100 donkeys, 150 cattle and 500 sheep, but have no dates except at Khatt in the Jiri plain. They own about 25 pearl boats and some 10 small boats in which they bring firewood for sale to the towns of Sharjah and Dibai. They depend for their livelihood chiefly on pearl-diving. A village on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, 8 miles south-west of Umm- HAMEI- al-Qaiwain town and 6 miles north-east of the town of ; Ajman, It YAH stands on the north side of a small creek, consists of about 300 houses, and is defended by a fort on the shore and by several ^ towers. There are 6 shops. The inhabitants, including the Shaikh, are Na'im of the Darawishah section, with a few Tanaij : they own about 17 pearl boats besides some 3 horses, 40 camels, 50 donkeys, 60 cattle and 150 sheep. There are now 1,000 date palms. The Na^imi Shaikh of Hamriyah, at present ^Abdur Rahman-bin-Saif, is not recognised as an independent chief; he has no separate treaty with the British Govern ment, he is entitled to no salute, he used to accompany the Shaikh of Sharj ah at interviews with British officers, and he must still be regarded as a dependent of Sharjah. Now, however, he denies his subordination to the Shaikh of Sharj ah and looks for protection to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwaln. There are no customs at Hamriyah, but the Shaikh derives about $4,520 a year from taxation of pearl boats. He also owns a date plantation at Dhaid. Next to Jabal Tuwaiq, in which it has its origin, this valley is the 'RANIFAH most important physical feature of Southern Najd, or at least of the (WADI) 'Aridh district,624. HANIFAH (WADI) General course. Hanifah emerges from tlie main range of Jabal Tuwaiq at a point marked by a conspicuous bluff to the west of Sidus ; it appears to be formed by the union of four valleys of Jabal Tuwaiq which are, in order from north to south, Khumar y+L the w eastern Haisiyah , Ghurur and Bodhah ; of these Haisiyah, which is thickly grown with acacia and other trees, is the best known as containing the road between ^Ayainah and Barrali, a eection of one of the principal routes across Arabia. From the head of Haisiyah down to Riyadh, a distance of about 50 miles, the general direction of the Hanifah valley is east. At Malqa about 15 miles above Riyadh it apparently forks,*' enclosing a small island; and near ^Ilb, some 4 miles further on, the same thing occurs again. Between 'Ayainah and Riyadh^ Wadi Hanifah receives three tributaries, all on its right bank ; these are Wahairish , which comes in immediately above Taraf, Ubaitah , midway between Jabailah and Malqa, and ^Ammariyah or Mazaira'ah ^, which contains the village of ^Ammariyah and joins immediately below Malqa. At Riyadh, or just beyond it, Wadi Hanifah turns to the south-south-east; and, after passing Hair at less than 20 miles from Riyadh, it is joined by a valley from Dhrumah and acquires the alternative name of Wadi Hair ; beyond this point it receives, apparently on the borders of Kharj, a tributary named Nisah , which begins in the same part of the Tuwaiq hills as the Abaljilat valley going to Hariq. Wadi Hanifah is finally lost in the desolate Sahabah tract at a distance of perhaps 30 miles from Hair ; its drainage is said to reach the Dah^nah beyond, where it disappears. Some natives of the country hold that the fresh water springs of Hasa are fed subterraneously by the drainage of Wadi Hanifah,—a theory which is at least plausible. General characteristics, —Above 'Ayainah low hills separate the Wadi on its right bank from the higher summits of Jabal Tuwaiq, while on the left bank there is a raised plateau. At 'Ayainah the bed of the valley is gravelly, and thence to Dara'iyah sandy. From ' Ayainah down as far as Malqa the general character of the Wadi is fairly uniform ; it has an average width of a few hundred yards and on either side of it there are fiat-topped cliffs, alternating with low slopes, while the immediately adjacent hill crests never rise more than 200 feet above the level of its bed. From Daralyah to Riyadh the Wadi appears t o be of a * The point is obscure both in Palgrave and Pelly. Fresh inquiry tends to show that the loop formed is unimportant, and that the island enclosed is short and liable to submersion in heavy floods.HANlFAH (WADI) 625 different character and to become, in places at leasi;, a scarp-sided and contracted ravine rather than an open valley. Floods in W adi Hanifah are said to rise 7 to 8 feet and to occur on the average four or five times in the year. After exceptionally good winter rains flowing water in the river bed may be expected to last ; in the neigh* bourhood of Riyadh, throughout the succeeding spring and even summer. The lower part of the valley is celebrated for its luxuriant date groves; in the upper and less frequented portion gazelle and partridges are met with, Wadi FJanifah has always been the seat of political power in Southern Najd and the successive capitals of ''Ayainah^ Dara'iyah and Riyadll have all been situated upon it.

There are no date palms, but tamarisks abound. Wheat, bar* ley and millet are grown. The water supply is from springs and from numerous wells 12 fathoms deep; one of the springs, called r Ayainat Bin-Mu'am- mar ^ is sup posed to be depen dent on a reservoir on the Ghallah tor rent in the direc tion of Sidus. By some 'Ayainah is said to have been the birth-place* of the founder of the Wah- habi sect and at one time the capital of the country. Detach ed heaps of ruins and extensive retaining walls built to confine the flood of Wadi Hanifah seem tc prove that it once was, in fact, a con siderable place. * It seems more probable, however, that Muhammad-bin-'Abdal Wahhab was fcoru Hautah, % S626 HANIFAH (WAI)J) Name.

The permanent in habitants are only 4 houses of inferior tribes; in winter, however, there is an influx of about 50 households of culti vators, chiefly from Malham but a few from Salbukh. About 30 houses, viz., 15 of Fadlml, 4 of Qahtan, and 10 of inferior tribes. No permanent in habitants, but visited in the agricultural season by about 10 cultivating families from other places, viz., Padhul from Dara'iyah and Malham and inferior tribes from 'lib. There was formerly a large village here. Crops are wheat, 'barley, lucerne, marsh melons and watei melons, but dates are very few. The vil lage lands are on both sides of the Wadi. Numerous wells 12 fathoms deep yield fresh water, but the level of the Wadi bed is too low to admit of irrigation from theru. The name is due to tl\e separation of Wadi Hanifah at this point into two brandies which reunite fur ther down. Wheat, barley, millet, lucerne and melons are culti vated ; there are date palms in abun dance but no other fruit trees. The date plantations are the property of the ruler of Riyadh.

Dates, wheat and barley are the present staples, the paliiis (which are irrigated from wells) being estimated at over 30,000; in 1819 cotton, maize, musk melons, water melons, peaches and figs were grown, and brinjals, spinach and clover were obtainable, but the fruits were not of good quality. The wells vary in depth from 4 to 12 fathoms according to their distance from the Wadi. The Wahhabi ruler keeps some 30 horses at this place. To the village belong some 30 camels, 50 donkeys and 150 cattle. The village lands lie ou both sides of the Wadi. Water is near the surface. There are the ordinary fruit trees and cereals and perhaps 10,000 date palms. The groves of M asani' are conti nuous with those of iVlanfubah. The date plantations are on both sides of the Wadi and are estimated to contain 10,000 palms. There are a few fruit trees, and cereals, lucerne and vegetables are grown, but the culti* vation is poor.

Hanjam has been not inaptly called the ' Perim of the Persian Gulf and it would form a good base of naval observation^ the Gulf being here so narrow that the Arabian coast is ordinarily visible ; it would not however be a suitable site for a defended naval establishment. Configuration, —Hanjam island is of a nondescript but compact shape ; it measures 5^ miles in length from north-north-east to south-south-west and about 3 miles in breadth. The island consists of an agglomeration of rugged hills decreasing in elevation from north to south : the highest summit is Table Hill^ one mile from the north end, which reaches 350 feet* The dismal aspect of Hanjam from the sea, whence it appears as a mass of barren, broken and almost black rocks, streaked here and there with white and red, does not belie its real character. Geology, —Geologically the island is as rich in interest and variety as botanically it is poverty-stricken. The prevailing rock is a miliolitic limestone; but patches of maroon coloured stone and soil are numerous and are generally indicative of the presence of rock salt. In the northern part of the island are several salt caves, notably one t towards the centre of the island which is entered by a long, low, narrow passage in the face of a hill; it contains a grotto of rare beauty adorned with stalactites and tracery of the purest white salt. The mouths of some of the caves are adjoined by piles of stones and metallic substances of various colours which have excited the admiration of more than one visitor ; among them appear * For naval considerations relating to Hanjam, Commanders T. W. Kemp and H. B. T. Somerville's report of 20th June 1903 may be consulted; see the Political Proceedings of the Government of India for June 1904. Some remarks by Sir L. Dane and Admiral Atkinson-Willes are given in the same. A tracing of the Hanjam anchorage with additional soundings taken in June 1903 is contained in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for June 1904, and remarks on Hanjam Opal®!; 1 Admiral Willes will also be found there.

A valley near the western coast, about 301) yards north-west of the foot of Table Hill, presents another geological curiosity in the form of clay pillars which stand erect and bear a singularly close resemblance to the trunks of fossilised date trees. In 1904 two of these pillars, on being broken open, were found to hold a core or second pillar of flint of the same length as the first; and one of the clay pillars contained in addition a fossilised bivalve shell. The outer clay case was extremely hard, but peeled off in layers under the blows of a hammer * Climate. —The climate of Hanjam in summer is barely tolerable; tke heat is terrific and is aggravated during the months of June, July and August by the moisture with which the atmosphere is laden, by the assaults of sand-flies and other insects, and, ia the neighbourhood of the coast, by the stench of decomposing sea-weed. The rainy season begins in October and ends in March. In the winter of 1903-19 04 the fall was considerable and filled the reservoirs, but for 4 or 5 years previously there had been very little rain. sfora and fauna. —The only self-sown trees are the ber anl acacia; and grass, even in spring, is only sufficient to tinge one or two of the main valleys with a slight shade of green. In the hills are some wild goats, in reality domestic goats which have escaped from the villages and their descendants, and the island is now overrun by hares which were introduced here and on Tuab island about 1 882 by Mr. Ffinch, then Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, There are no wild carnivora. Birds are not uncommon, especially towards the open ground at the south-west of the island j among them are the kite, hawk, stone-plover, lark, dove and blue-rock pigeon, the latter inhabiting the caves and sometimes the deep wells of the island. The edible oyster is plentiful along the shores, and pearl-oysters also abound. Sand-flies and other insects exist in myriads and are troublesome at certain seasons. Telegraph MionA—OvAy three points on Hanjam are at present inhabited. Of these the first is the British telegraph station, which was re-established at the north end of the island in April 1904 after having Mi. B. W. Lobo of the I .E. T. D., on whose excellent account of Hanjam the ^i^atei par o us article is founded, has seen similar freaks of natare at Ormarah on the coast or Makran. t A plan of the Siatioa and discussion of its boundaries will be found in the Government of India's Political Proceedings for September 1905,HANJAM 631 been in abeyance for 13 years. The buildings are situated on a cliff J of a mile inland from the north coast of the island, and are only few yards to the northward of the plinth which marks the site of the original station. The staff consists of an Assistant Superintendent and two clerks. On the south side of the station is a valley of considerable extent and about 550 yards across; it runs across the island from west to east and containB two or three wells, the best of which is affected to the use of the telegraph establishment. Ihe water is about 18 feet from the surface and varies from sweet to brackish ; advantage has been taken of it to lay out a small garden and plant some trees.* The northern side of the valley consists of high cliffs, the lower strata of which are composed oftShur or gal in e matter. A village called Masheh, consisting of a few huts, stands 300 yards east of the telegraph station and is occupied by native employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department who were brought here from Jashk but were originally natives of Basidu. Ho/fij(iwi villcbyc*—The most populous place on the island is the village of Hanjam, situated on a stretch of flat open country by the coast on the south-east side of the island. The plain adjoining it is all under cultiva tion. Han jam is a typical Arab village, comparatively clean and well-built, and consists of about 200 houses. It possesses 8 or 9 gardens well stocked with fruit trees and irrigated from wells 20 to 25 feet deep which arc worked by bullocks ; there are about 1,400 date-palms, and the other principal crops are wheat, barley, onions and pumpkins. Ihe Arabs of Hanjam belong to the Bani Yas tribe of the Arabian coast, whence they are said to have immigrated about *5 generations ago ; their intercourse is still chiefly with that coast and particularly with the town of DibaL They are manly, independent, intelligent, industrious and extremely hospitable. They own 36 pearl boats which constitute their principal means of livelihood ; the bulk of the male population is absent on the Arabian pearl-banks every year from June to October, not returning to the island until they have disposed of their takings to Indian merchants in Trucial 'Oman or at the pearl mart of Lingeh. The women during the same season e-eek employment at MLinab and other places as date pickers and return to the settlement about the same time as their male relatives. In summer, consequently, Hanjam village is practically deserted except by aged caretakers. In winter the men of Hanjam, who are said to be very dexterous in the use of the harpoon, mostly devote themselves to ♦The valley and wells have been minutely describ®d by Mr. Lobo ; v%dt the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for December 19.04.632 HANJAM shark-fishing, fcut some remain on shore to tend the cold weather crops For shore-fishing the people of Hanjam use a torpedo-shaped fish trap o£ wickerwork with one inch meshes and a cone-shaped entrance pro jecting inwards from one end ; this is sunk at a moderate depth in a passage between two rocks and is taken out at the end of the day with such fish as having wandered in have been unable to find their way out again. To Hanjam village and that of Ghail, mentioned below, belong 7 camels, 40 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 goats, all of which are allowed to roam at large over the island. About a mile south of Hanjam village, in the first series of hills from the coast, are some masonry remains which the Arabs attribute to the Portuguese. Ghail village.—HhQ third settlement is Ghail lU , an offshoot of Hanjam village situated on the west coast about 3 miles south west of the telegraph station and 3 miles north-west of Hanjam village. It contains about 30 houses and depends like Hanjam chieflj on pearl- diving. Here there is a well of excellent water within a few feet of the sea beach. Four or five walled gardens have sprung up about 100 yards east of the village; in these there are fruit trees, onions aiid a few pumpkins and beans. In the gardens are some eight shallow wells, and between them and the village an artificial lake for storing lain water has been created by damming up a hollow which passes the village. Ihe supply of water at Ghail is almost inexhaustible, and native vessels anchoring between Hanjam and Qishm Island procure their supply from this place by boat when the tanks at the north end of the island are empty. Besides the telegraph station and the villages of Hanjam and Ghail there are now no other settlements on the island ; but traces of former hamlets exist in more than one place, and in the valley south of the old telegraph station are the remains of walled plots of cultivation. Anchorage, etc. —Some idea of the resources and trade of Hanjam has been given in describing the island and villages. The salt-caves and pits, it ma}' be observed, have not been worked in recent years. It remains to add that there is a valuable anchorage, called Masheh bay, between Han jam and Qishm ; it is visited by most native vessels proceeding up the Gulf in oider to take water on board, or, in some cases, to obtain shelter from the Shamal which here blows from the west-south-west. This place Was formerly a rendezvous of pirates and is still occasionally used by slaveis. 'Ihe anchorage is a double one^ lying on both sides of a sandy spit at the northernmost point of the island, on which a beacon and high-water mark have recently been erected by the cable ship of thehanjAm 688 Indo-European Telegraph Department. The amount of the anchorage sheltered from the prevailing winds is very limited^ and the bottom is hard and a ship is liable to drag her anchor, especially in consequence of the tides which run strongly during ebb and are said to attain about 3 knots at springs. Vessels drawing about 10 feet can be beached on the spit. The western part of the anchorage is the better, but it is partially exposed to the Shamal, to avoid which vessels must change their position to the other side of the cape. The depth in the anchorage is about 9 fathoms. Masheh bay is the place where vessels load salt from the Namakdan mines on Qishm Island for the Calcutta and other markets; there being no safe anchorage off Namakdan the salt is brought here in lighters, a distance of over 20 miles, and transhipped. Political The principal authority on the island is the Shaikh of the village of Hanjam, who has hitherto endeavoured, with some success, to avoid relations with the Persian authorities. No revenue or tribute is paid by the islanders, and a Persian Customs post and two Persian flag-staffs at the north end of the island are as yet the only evidences of Persian sovereignty. Huim. —No account of Hanjam would be complete which failed to mention the ruins on the north coast. The principal are two mosques 275 yards apart, of which the eastern seems to have been a Persian construc tion and the western stands on a cliff overhanging the sea. On the northern side of the former, along the beach, extend traces of a settlement which appears to have consisted of 200 or 300 houses: among the remains here some copper coins, dating from 113 to 164 years back, have been dis covered. Immediately to the south of these ruins is a hollow 250 yards square containing graves and headstones, and in the vicinity of the mosque are 9 reservoirs hewn out of the solid limestone rock and lined with an imperishable hydraulic cement locally called Saruch. The largest of these reservoirs is 60 feet long, 12 feet wide and 12 feet deep and has a cylindrically vaulted roof of common Gach and stones. The western mosque appears to have been built with the ordinary maroon- coloured cement of the island; it is also adjoined by reservoirs, 3 cv 4 in number, and by a graveyard which, with the remains of houses on the hill behind, indicate that it may have been the nucleus of a distinct settlement. About a mile from the village of Ghail are three blocks of granite, the largest weighing several tons, of which the presence is not in any way accounted for except by a superstitious tale.634 HARB HAKB Singular Harbi , A great Arab tribe, mostly nomadic, found Vj-*- in the Hijaz province and on the western confines of Najd. Disiribution. —Part reside between Makkah and Madinah within the basin of the Red Sea, others to the south of Khaibar about the head of Wadi-ar-Rummah and that of Wadi-al-Hamdh which goes down to Madinah ; the remainder, with whom we are chiefly concerned, inhabit the country upon the upper course of Wadi-ar-Rummah and the tract called Hazam-ar-Raji ^1^1 ^ to the south of it, sometimes pushing as far east as Dilainriyah, Ab-ad-Dud and Subaih in Qasim and as 'Aqlah, Balaziyah, Fuwarah and 'Odhaim in Jabal Shammar. Harb Bedouins are occasionally seen in 'Aridh. Settled Harb are found at Barrudin Wadi as Sirr, at Zilfi in Sadair, and at Rghabah in 'Aridh; and some of the inhabitants of permanent villages in Qasim claim to be of Harb descent, especially at Basr, Bukairiyah, ; Aiti Ibn-Fahaid, Oamar, Hilaliyah, Jau'i, Qaryah, Quwai'ah, Muraid Saiyid, Nabhaniyah, Shaihiyah, Shiqqah, Subaih and Ummahat-az- Ziyabah. The Bedouins who adjoin the Harb in Najd are the Hataim upon the north, the Mutair upon the east and the 'Ataibah upon the south-east and south, Divisions and number. —The Harb tribe consists of two main divisions, the Masruh and the Bani Salim . The subdivisions of the Masruh are three, the Bani ; Ali ^ , the Bani 'Amr y* and the Bani-as-Safar ^ ; these again are composed of the sections given below.* Bani 3 Ali subdivision of the Masruh, 'Ahidah Karashif Dahaim Kitimah Dawairah 6j£]y&gt; and Kalakhah Turafah The Bani ^Ali appear to lie the furthest to the north and east of the whole tribe.

Some of the Bani ; Ali pitch their tents in a circle and keep their animals in the middle, an unusual form of camp among the Bedouins of Central Arabia.

The settled Harb of Zilfi are said to belong to a section called Bani m Hammad ^ . The numbers of the Harb are difficult to estimate, but those in Najd may be placed at about 3,500 souls. Livelihood and character. —The Harb are camel and sheep-owners; their camels are nearly all swarthy or black, and some of their sheep are black also. A number of the tribe are professional robbers and highwaymen, and others act as escorts to pilgrim caravans passing through their country. In complexion the Harb are extremely dark, but they have the features of true Arabs. In religion they are Hanbali Sunnis ; in character and disposition they seem to vary considerably from section to section; many of the poorer Harb live among the Hataim, but they abstain from intermarriage with them. The Harb are not as yet a well-armed tribe ; their weapons are still for the most part muzzle-loading guns, flint-locks and spears; such rifles as they possess have been imported through Yanbo 1 on the Red Sea. Political position. —As the greater part of their territory and nearly all their immovable property are in Hijaz, where they have a number of fixed villages, the political relations of the Harb with the Turks are necessarily close. The Bani Salim division and the Bani 'Amr sub division are subsidised by the Turkish Government in consideration of their keeping open the various pilgrim routes through the Harb Dirah ; but the subsidy is really paid by the pilgrims in the form of tolls collected at Makkah by the Turkish authorities on behalf of the Harb. The Damascus Hajj is severely taxed for this purpose, that from Hail less so, the Qasim Hajj escapes still more cheaply, and that from Riyadh is altogether exempt. The Harb who live in Najd beyond effective Turkish jurisdiction were in the beginning tributaries of the Wahhabi; but in 1864 they allied themselves to the ; Ataibah, then hostile to Ibn Sa ; ud. In 1878 they were subject to taxation by Ibn Rashid and used to be periodically collected by his order at Samirah for military and revenue purposes. They have lately returned to their original allegiance and render annual tribute to the Wahhabi Amir at the rate of one sheep or goat in every 50 and one dollar in cash on every oHARDIN 637 camels: the total value of their present annual contribution has not been ascertained. A considerable Arab tribe located chiefly upon the boundary, to the HARDAK west of the K a run, between Northern and Southern ^Arabistan; a few are found to the east of the Gargar. Shartagh a few miles to the east of Kut Nahr Hashim appears to be their principal centre. The Hardan cultivate wheat and barley: they also own 300 camels, cattle in considerable numbers, and large flocks of sheep and goats. The fighting men of the tribe are reckoned at nearly 700, of whom over 200 are mounted on horses and 100 or 200 have rifles, and the total number of souls may be estimated at ^,500. The Hardan pay revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammareli. The following are the divisions of the tribe with some particulars concerning them Name. Location, Fighting strength. Eemakks.

Generally pronounced Harij or Harig ; a valley in Southern Najd forming a district of the Wahhabi dominions. Boundaries and physical features, —On the north Hariq is divided from the district of 'Aridh by Jabal 'Alaiyah ; and on the south it appears to be bounded by a range, called Hilaiyah &lt;4^, whichX HARlQ 639 interposed between it and part of the Hautah district. The fall of the Hariq valley appears to be from west to east, and its drainage is reported to join that of Hautah upon its waj to Khar j. Jabal 'Alaiyah, already mentioned, is an important physical feature connected with this district and with Hantah; it is uncertain whether it pertains to the Tuwaiq system or is an isolated range. It is described as enclosing a basin of which the drainage escapes by a fissure called Sha^ib 'Alaiyah in the eastern side of the mountain ; in the north-western part of the basin is a locality named Ma wan where there are wells 4 fathoms deep and date groves at which Bedouins assemble in the season to gather the fruit. Jabal 'Alaiyah is reported high and difficult and is said to contain a number of strongholds, which are called Qaranivah iM uu j or Quruniyah and are occupied by robber bands composed of the oif-scourings of many df the tribes of Arabia. A part of Jabal 3 Alaiyah apparently projects southwards into the Hariq valley, for it is crossed immediately after leaving Flarlq town on the way from that place to Dilam in Kharj.* Communications.—-Jioutes radiate from Hariq town to Dilam in Kharj, to Hair on Wadi Hanifah, and to the village of Jau-as-Saibani which is described in the article on Dhrumah. The route to Dilam goes east with a slight southerly inclination ; the journey occupies a caravan 10 or 11 hours and the distance may be about 30 miles. The first 3 hours are spent in ascending and then descending a portion of Jabal Alaiyah ; thereafter the route runs through a plain where neither villages nor torrent beds are encountered. It is also possible to go from Hariq to Dilam by descending the Hariq valley to its junction with the valley of Hautah and thence following the Hautah valley to Dilam : on this route also no villages are passed. The route from Hariq to Hair is identical with the first route to Dilam until the crossing of part of Jabal 'Alaiyah has been effected and the south-eastern corner of the mountain is reached; it then diverges northwards, 'Alaiyah for some time remaining on the left hand. A waterless stage which is reckoned half way to Hair is reached in 10 caravan hours; it is named Ausat ^ from a hill that adjoins it on the west. Unless however the road is very winding, it does not appear that the journey can amount to so much as 60 miles. * Hariq has not, so far as is known, been visited by any European traveller. It is bard, bowever, to understand bow Palgrave reacbei Kharfah in Aflaj without apparently passing through either Harig or Hantah640 HARlQ Tlie route from Hariq to Jau-as-Saibani runs for 8 hours through hilly ground, Jabal ^Alaiyah being on the right hand side of the traveller, to the hill of Faraishah ; thence the way continues westwards for 5 hours over a level plain to J au-as-Saibani. The times being those taken by a caravan, the total distance is probably between 30 and 40 miles. At 3 hours short of Jau-as-Saib^ni on the south side of the route is Khashm-adh-Dhib which is regarded as the north-westernmost corner of the hills of Hariq and is the furthest point reached by the torrent of Abaljilat from ' Aridh. Topography, 'population and resources, —The following is a table of the principal places in the Hariq district with some particulars con cerning them Name. Position, Houses and inhabitants. EE MASKS. Hariq town About 30 miles west by north of Dilamin Kharj. Population is about 3,000 souls, but a number of the people live scattered in the date gardens. There are 100 houses of Euwalah 'Anizah of the Hazaziuah sec tion ; 40 of Sail til; 20 of Sabai* of the Khathlan section ; 15 of Dawasir; 10 of Fadiitil and 175 of Baui Khadhir. The Sabai' are set tled in the date groves to the south east. One of the Qasrs in the middle of the settlement is called Mishraq The date groves are very extensive and contain a large num ber of trees. The usual fruits of South ern IN ajd, including peaches, are found; also the usual cereals. Water is at 16 to 20 fathoms and the well- lifts are worked by camels. Livestock are estimated at 50 horses, 50 donkeys, 500 camels and 300 cattle. There is a bazaar of about 40 shops, supplied from Hasa with piece- goods and 'Abas, from Hasa and Qatar with arms and ammunition, and from Yam an with coffee. The place contains a number of upper-store jed houses; timber for building is obtained locally and not im ported. Mufaijir A-bout 8 miles east of Na'am. 45 bouses, viz., 15 of Hazazinah of the Ruwalah section of the 'Anizah, 10 of Salmi and 20 of inferior tribes. The water supply and crops are the same as at Pariq town, but the date planta tions are neglected and the place is going to decay.HABlQ Name. Position. House and i nhabitants. remabk.s.

Cultivators from Hariq town culti vate wheat here in the cold weather. It will be observed that among' the genuine Arab villagers of the Hariq district 'Anizah of the Rnwalah section predominate, but the infenor tribea who are grouped together under the designation of Bani Khadhir are probably more numerous than they. The whole settled population of the Hariq district probably does not exceed 4,000 souls. It is believed that HarTq was once more thickly peopled than it is new • local opinion attributes the decline to the Egyptian invasions. The valley is noted for the excellence of its fruits. The revenue which Haiiq present yields to the Wahhabi Amir is estimated at $ 5 000 a year, % T642 HABQtTS HAEQUS A mere sandbank in the Persian Gulf, situated about 80 miles west and slightly south of Farsi island ; it is about 300 yards in length and is hardly above the level of high water. There are a few birds. The ownership of Harqus is undetermined, never having come into question, HAREAS (BANI) Singular is Harrasi A Ghafiri tribe in the Western Hajar district^of the Sultanate of 'Oman, lhadhis in religion: they are found at Hillat Bani Harras (100 houses) in Wadi Samail ; at Nakhl (66 houses) and Hibra (40 houses) in Wadi Ma'awal; at 'Awabi, in Wadi Bani Kharus ; at Buwairid (26 houses), Mansur (40 houses) and Jammah (600 houses), in Wadi Fara '; and atFiq^ m Wadi Mistal. They also occur at Taimsa (40 houses), in ' Oman Proper. The Bani Harras number about 4,000 souls. The ruling family is called Aulad Thinaiyan ; the present chief is Kbalfan-bin- Thinaiyan, and the tribal capital is Jammah. HASA LwwsOl or AHSA OASIS* This and the Qatif Oasis are the only fertile and well watered tracts in the Sanjaq of Hasa; and of the two the Hasa Oasis, now under con- sideration, is by far the more valuable and important. Boundaries, extent and position.— Hasa Oasis has its north western corner at Jabal Qarat-ar^nkban and its south-western corner at Jabal Bu Ghanimah, while its southern boundary runs from Jabal Bu Ghammah to Jabal Arba' and thence for several miles further to the east; on the remaining sides the borders of the district are not precisely defined by conspicuous features. With these limits its extent is about 35 miles from north to south, and its breadth may be taken at 20 miles. The Hasa Oasis is enclosed by the desert tracts of Ghuwar on the west, Kharmah on the south, and Biyadh. on the east and north, at Jabal Qarat-ar-Bukban it touches Badd-al-AsiSj and at its oppo site or south-eastern extremity it meets Jafurah. The town of Hofu , of which the position is well ascertained, is situated in the district near its south-western corner : and {he eastern border of the oasis approaches within about ^0 miles of the Persian Gulf coast at the port of 'Oqair. x 'fiysical features and climate, —It should be clearly understood that although the whole is spoken of as Hasa, only a portion of the district just defined is cultivated or permanently inhabited. The greatei par * The principal authorities, maps, etc., relating to this tract are included among thos iraentioned in the first tootnote to the title of the article on the Hasa Sanjaq.HASA OASIS 643 it is in fact merely desert except, perhaps, between Qaran and 'Ayun, where it is marshy. The chief block of cultivation is in the south, to the east of the towns of Mubarraz and Hofuf ; it does not extend much further north than the first of these, and southwards it hardly reaches beyond the second and does not cross to the south of the Hofuf- Jishshah road until near Bab-al-Jafar; its extreme length from west to east does not exceed 12 miles. Besides this block there are 2 or 3 detached areas of cultivation, but in comparison with it they are insignificant ; and, when in the following paragraphs mention is made of limits of cultivation, the phrase is to be taken as referring to the limits of the main block. Of the cultivated areas the nearest to the main block is one which adjoins the west side of Sha'abah; it is separated from the cultivated country to the south of it by a narrow belt of stony, waste land, across which water for irrigation is brought in deeply-dug channels. This patch is about 2 miles north of Mubarraz ; and 2 miles further, in the same direction, a somewhat larger one occurs which contains the villages of Matairafi, Jalaijilah, Qaran and Qarain and ^possesses springs of its own. The lands of ^Ayun village compose the largest and most isolated of the minor cultivated areas, for they cover a space of perhaps 4 square miles and the nearest part of them is about 15 miles north of Mubarraz ; in connection with these may be mentioned a small patch of cultivation at Qattar. which is 6 miles further to the northward but belongs to the same owners as ^Ayun. The hills of Qarat-ar-Rukban, Bu Ghammah and Arba', inasmuch as they lie on the borders of the oasis and are common to it and other districts, are described in the general article on the Has a Sanjaq. Emi nences actually included within the district are few and unimportant. The nearest to Hofuf is a mound called Abul Kubari about 1^ miles north-east of the town; and the largest is Jabal Qarah, which lies 6 miles east-north-east of Hofuf, covers a considerable area, and has at its base upon different sides the villages of Qarah, Dalwah / Taimiyah and Tuwaithir; J abal Qarah consists, partly at least, of sand stone rocks weathered into fantastic shapes, and it contains roomy caves which are used as dwellings in the hot weather. The only hill of im portance besides Jabal Qarah is Jabal Buraijah also called Jabal Sha'abah ; it is a high ridge running eastwards for perhaps a mile from the village of Sha^abah which is situated at the foot of it. Mention may also be made of some hillocks a mile to the south-east of Jishshah which are know r n as Talul-ad-Duwwar. The aqueous features of the oasis, such as springs, streams and lakes are noticed in the paragraph below on irrigation.644 ha.sa oasis The elevation of Hasa above the sea has not been observed; but it is certainly not great. The general slope of the oasis, to judge from the flow of the springs, is downwards from west to east; but in the northern portion, to the south of 'Ayun, there appears to be a descent northwards as well as eastwards. The soil is light and inclines to sandiness; but, though barren saline patches occur arbitrarily here and there, it is generally fertile. A multitude of springs exist, all of which are more or less warm and some of which are extremely hot; they prob- ablv represent, along with those of Qatlf and Bahrain^ the drainage of Najd eastwards which disappears on reaching the DaMnah desert. Running waters fed by the springs abound, especially on the east side of Hofuf; in places the roads run upon embankments through deep, saturated country; and in some localities there are marshes and large stagnant ponds, the most notable being Birkat-al-Asfar. Natural grass is plentiful in spring; reeds and rushes grow in the swamps j and among wild trees the tamarisk and the Sidai 01 her are the most common. The climate of the Hasa Oasis is not favourable to physical activity or to health, but it is colder, drier and less relaxing than that of Qatlf or Bahrain. PopuUtion. —The people of the Hasa Oasis are partly nomads and partly settled townsmen and villagers. The Bedouins are dealt with elsewhere in the article on the Hasa Sanjaq, and here we have only to do with the fixed inhabitants, who are called in Arabic Hasawiyah . Among the Hasawiyah little stress is laid on tribal divisions, and the principal distinction observed is that of religion, between Shi'ahs and Sunnis. The total sedentary population of the oasis, the towns of Hofuf and Mubarraz being included, may be placed at 67,000 souls, of whom 25,000 (three-fourths Sunnis) inhabit the town of Hofuf and 8,500 (four- fifths Sunnis) that of Mubarraz. Of the 33,500 persons living in the 35 other towns and villages of the oasis, it appears that almost exactly | are Shi'ahs and J Sunnis j but the Sunnis generally preponderate in the larger of these country places. Both sects have schools at Hofuf, and the Sunnis have small schools in some of the larger villages as well, but the Shi'ahs have none outside of the capital. It may be mentioned, notwithstanding the unimportance in Hasa of differences other than those of religion, that most of the Shfahs probablyHASA OASIS 645 belong to the race known as Baharinah, being so regarded by the people of Qatif and Bahrain though not, perhaps, so styled by themselves; and that among the Sunnis there are iacluded a few of the cla c s called Huwalah. The Baharinah, notwithstanding the name and their undoubted racial identity with the original inhabitants of Bahrain^ as proved by the existence among them of some of the same family divisions, appear to be indigenous to Hasa and not to be immigrants even of old standing. There are a few Jews in the oasis who have come from Turkish ^Iraq since the Turkish occupation of Hasa; and it is said that a Sabian community once existed, but if so it has now disappeared. Negro slaves are fairly numerous and for statistical purposes have not been distinguished from their owners, whose form of religion—whether Shfah or Sunni—they usually follow. It is reported that in the villages of the oasis nearly every male adult possesses a rifle.
