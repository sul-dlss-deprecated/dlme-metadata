August, 1936./ c FOREWORD l his report covers the countries in Arabia previously known as the Hejaz, Nejd, and Asir, and now included, with some outlying districts of the peninsula, in Ibn Saud’s dominions under the title of Sa’udi Arabia.11 CHAPTER I HISTORY The recent history of Central Arabia is the story of the dis appearance, from the Arabian scene, of Turkish claims and suzerainty, and the rise to dominant power of one, Arab, ruling family, the Al Saud, and the defeat by them of their rivals. The chief means used to gain his end, by the head of the Al Saud, Abdul Aziz ibn Abdurrahman Al Faisal, known as Ibn Saud and now H.M. the King of Sa’udi Arabia, was a religious revival. This story is briefly related below. 1. Summary of Recent History Turkish Occupation In the second half of the last century and up until the Great War, 1914-1918, the Turks claimed sovereignty over all Arabia, except certain coastal strips under British influence or control, and attempted some show of occupation. They managed to maintain garrisons here and there on the outskirts of the country and at Mecca, a Wali or Governor. The exact position of the latter varied with the changing political situation in the Turkish capital, and with the acumen, or otherwise, of the Arab Prince of Mecca. The Wali’s position was at times akin to that of a British Political Agent at the Court of an independent Indian Rajah, although he had a scattered garrison of approximately 15,000 men at his call and was in theory a governor. Rival Princes The rival princelings with whom the Turks found that they had to deal were— (A) The Hashimite Prince, or Sharif of Mecca, known to Europeans as the Grand Sharif, usually nominated by the Sultan from a member of the Hashimite family believed to be pro-Turk. The Hashimite family claimed descent from Hashim, an ancestor of the Prophet Muhammed, and as such was greatly revered in the Moslem world. Their spiritual influence went far afield, while their temporal power was confined to Western Arabia, roughly the Hejaz only. (B) The Ibn Rashid Prince of Hail, in Jabal Shammar in Northern Nejd. The Ibn Rashid family had great prestige among the Bedouins, being overlords of the Shammar Bedouin confederation, who ranged from Hail far up into ’Iraq, but had, for a time, early in the 19th century, been subject to the Al Saud. (C) The Idrisi, spiritual overlord of Asir, on the Red Sea littoral, whose history as a ruling family in Asir had begun only in the 19th century a.d.(D) The Al Saud family, members of the Masalikh section of the Wuld Ali division of the Anaiza tribe, who, ruling as petty chieftains at Daraya in Nejd, had, in the 18th century, sprung into prominence through adopting the puritanical doctrine of one, Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab and whose cause had thereafter ominously prospered, in spite of Turkish efforts at suppression ; efforts including the inspiration of an Egyptian expedition which destroyed Daraya, and the support of the Ibn Rashid prince in his warring with the Al Saud family. The fervour of those who had embraced the creed which had become to be known as Wahhabism, was the prop of the Al Saud rulers against the dangers which beset them. Nejd In 1891, however, the house of Ibn Saud was at last given what appeared to be its death blow. The survivors, completely defeated, fled to shelter at the Court of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and the victorious Amir Muhammad Ibn Rashid ruled their territorv under Turkish aegis. In 1897, the conqueror died, and three years later Abdul Aziz, son of the deposed Amir Ibn Saud, then a young man of twenty, with the connivance of the Shaikh of Kuwait, led a surprise attack on their late capital, Riyadh, and captured it. The recovery of his father s territory involved the young Ibn Saud m intermittent hostilities with the Turks and with several of the Arab leaders in Nejd. In 1904, the lurks despatched an expedition against him in response to appeals from Ibn Rashid. This expedition succeeded in reaching Qasim, and forced Ibn Saud to retire, but, in a jew months, had almost entirely disappeared, gradually destroyed y the effects of the climate, inadequacy of supplies, and enemy action. A temporary agreement including Turkish recognition of n baud was arrived at, but, by 1906, Ibn Rashid was again fighting hun. Ibn Saud completely defeated the Ibn Rashid forces and occupied Qasim. Ihe Turks made no further effort to establish themselves in Nejd. In the following years, Ibn Saud devoted himself to strengthening his position Between 1901 and 1910, the Al Saud family had already been eompeHed to subdue as rebels the shaikhly families of al Hazani A ■,,!?' o Ask f, r of Ma i maa &gt; Ash Shaqrani of Al Hauta, Ibn Aqayil of Ar Rus, Aba Al Khail of Buraida, rulers of Qasim, and many others, whose members now live under varying degrees of surveillanee at Riyadh, or, in some cases, have been taken fnto the Ring s service or deserted the country. these rulers, Ibn Saud replaced by non-hereditaryAmirs, servants reli^ oiisT Ch00S, ! lg , In 1910 - he brou g ht into being a militant hoTwlrNTTN ’Tr 1 , as Ikhwan - The Ikhwan or brother hood, were to be united by devotion to the Wahhabi creed, and wereto settle together in new colonies, abandoning tribal ties. It was a politico-religious experiment which succeeded brilliantly, giving Ibn Saud, himself a staunch Wahhabi, a fanatical fighting force devoted to his cause. By the end of 1913 he felt himself strong enough to attempt the recovery of Hasa, which had been held by the Turks since 1875. In May, 1914, Ibn Saud had recovered the whole province with its coastline of 250 miles between Kuwait and Qatar in the Persian Gulf. Members of the former ruling Arab family of Hasa, the Amirs of the Bani Khalid tribe, were, and are to the present time, detained in Riyadh at Ibn Saud’s order and expense. This expansion of his dominions brought him into direct contact with British interests, and, with the entry of Turkey into the Great War on the side of Germany and the subsequent campaigns in Mesopotamia and Palestine, he was already a ruler of authority, whom Britain could not ignore. The Hejaz and Asir On the western side of the Peninsula in the Hejaz, the situation had been developing along somewhat similar lines. Theie, wheie they had been more firmly established than in Nejd, the Turks had also been losing ground. In 1908, the Turks had nominated as Hashimite ruler of Mecca, one, Hussain bin Ali, in the belief that he was devoted to their cause. In 1910 he did support them in a campaign against the Idrisi in Asir, but in doing so ne had been allowed to raise a Bedouin levy, which he did not afterwards entirely disband, but used to further his own designs and increase his authority. Treaty of Qatif, 1915 With the outbreak of the war in 1914, the Turks found themselves expelled from Nejd and with only a precarious hold in the Hejaz, where Sharif Hussain awaited the opportunity for insurrection. Anxious now for the co-operation of the powerful Amirs oi Central Arabia, they endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to reconcile Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid. The British Government, equally desirous of securing the co-operation of the increasingly powerful Amir of Nejd, opened negotiations with Ibn Saud, and, after considerable delay, a treat\ was signed at Qatif on 26th December, 1915, by Sir P. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Ibn Saud. By this instrument, Ibn Saud was recognised as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa, Qatif, and Jubail, and he agreed to have no relations with any other foreign power. So far, neither the Sharif nor Ibn Saud were committed to support the British, although negotiations had been can ied on with both.14 i The Turks Proclaim “ Jihad ” (Religious War)—Battle of Jarab, 1915 The Turks, hoping to gain the assistance of the tribes, proclaimed a “ Jihad ” and brought increasing pressure to bear upon Hussain to declare in their favour. The Sharif, uncertain which course was most likely to suit his own ends, hesitated to bring himself in conflict with his neighbour, Ibn Saud. In the meantime, a renewal of the conflict began between Ibn Saud and his enemy Ibn Rashid. Ibn Rashid, at the head of a pro-Turkish confederation of tribes met Ibn Saud’s forces at Jarab on 24th January, 1915, and both sides suffered heavily. The action was indecisive, but it had repercussions in Mesopotamia, where it gave a setback to Turkish attempts to rally the tribes in their favour. Captain Shakespear, British Political Agent at Kuwait, who was on a mission to Ibn Saud, was killed, and our relations with Ibn Saud were interrupted. Ambitions of Sharif Hussain—The Hejaz Revolt, 1916 In the meantime, negotiations continued with the Sharif Hussain for the purpose of enlisting his support against the Turks. At last, m June, 1916, the Sharif, who already had visions of an Arab confederation with himself as King, rose against the Turks and proclaimed the independence of the Hejaz. Ibn Saud, at this time, was unaware of the British agreement with the Sharif. He became alarmed at the success of the Hejaz Revolt, and informed Sir P. Cox that he and his tribesmen could not tolerate control by the Sharif. The British Government found itself supporting rivals. Matters were not improved when, on 5th November, 1916, the Sharif caused himself to be proclaimed “ King of the Arabs.” Ibn Saud was reassured by Sir P. Cox that the Sharif claimed no jurisdiction over t le independent Arab Rulers, but it was clear that henceforth no co-operation between Ibn Saud and the Sharif was practicable, mg Hussain endeavoured to win over the support of tribes outside ^ lth g ° ld ’ Whll5t Ibn Saud dlrected the spiritual appeal of Wahhabism amongst the Hejazis, a movement which was eventually to spread and destroy Sharifian authority. Battle of Turaba, 1919—Further Expansion of Ibn Saud’s Dominions qu 19 1 8, the T 1 Urks had been driven fr om the Hejaz, and the Sharifian force under the Amir Faisal, son of King Hussain, was Armv?n ° n the deSert flank of the British y m Palestine.

For the next two years, he was constrained to satisfy the ambitions of his aggressive Ikhwan elsewhere. In the south, he annexed Abha, the inland portion of Asir, and in the north, carried out further operations in the Jabal Shammar against Ibn Rashid of Hail, who since the Turkish collapse had been seeking and receiving the support of King Hussain. In November, 1921, Hail was captured and the territory of Ibn Rashid and the Jabal Shammar annexed to Nejd. The only survivors, all then children, of the Ibn Rashid family were (with one exception now in Baghdad) detained and still are, in Riyadh living on the King’s bounty. There was nothing to prevent Ton Saud’s further expansion northwards, and, in 1922, he captured and annexed Jauf, displacing the great Ruwalla division of the Anaiza of Syria from free use of their winter grazing in the Wadi Sirhan. This expansion left him with his frontiers marching with those of the British in Transjordan. Similarly, the annexation of the territory of Ibn Rashid brought Ibn Saud to the southern frontier of 'Iraq, where Faisal, son of King Hussain, was now King of a new state under British Mandate. Treaty of Muhammarah and Uqair Protocol, 1922 By the Treaty of Muhammarah and the Uqair Protocol, which were signed between Nejd and ’Iraq in 1922, delimitation of the frontier was agreed upon and provision made for the use of grazing grounds and wells, and the restraint and punishment of tribal aggression. Ibn Saud attacks Hejaz Ibn Saud’s position was secure on the north and east. In the west, there remained the Hejaz, and in 1924 he turned in that direction. The subsidy, which for many years he had been receiving from the British Government, ceased early in 1924, and left him under no further obligation. A few months earlier, the elderly King Hussain, with whom Britain had vainly endeavoured to make a Treaty, had also ceased to draw a British subsidy. By June, Ibn Saud issued a proclamation to the Islamic world rejecting the Hashimite Caliphate which King Hussain had assumed earlier in the year, and, in August, 1924, the Wahhabi armies entered the Hejaz. The spread of Wahhabism which had been fostered amongst the Hejaz tribes, and past mis-government, made Ibn Saud’s task an easy one. During the campaign, Wahhabi forces sacked Tail’, the summer seat of the Hejaz Government, massacring the inhabitants, and, on the 13th October, entered Mecca without meeting resistance. Abdication of King Hussain and Conquest of the Hejaz, 1924r-25 On the third of October, King Hussain abdicated. Medina fell after a protracted siege, and Ah, Hussain’s eldest son, who had succeeded the King, retreated to Jedda, but was, in turn, forced to surrender. By the end of 1925, the Wahhabi conquest of theHejaz was complete. In January, 1926, Ibn Saud was proclaimed King of the Hejaz and became ruler of three-fourths of the Arabia peninsula. During this conflict, Ma’an and Akaba, the ownership of which had not been hitherto precisely defined, were occupied by British forces. The Mandatory Governments of both Transjordan and ’Iraq had, by now, commenced a form of desert administration. Both were hampered by the border tribes of the ill-defined frontier, raiding and then evading pursuit by retreat into the opposite territory. Balira and Hadda Agreements, 1925 An improvement in this state of affairs could only be hoped for if the frontiers were defined and therefore negotiations to this end were entered into with Ibn Saud and resulted in the Bahra Agree ment concerning Nejd and ’Iraq questions, and the Hadda Agreement, dealing with Nejd, the Hejaz, and Transjordan affairs. Treaty of Jedda, 192/’ In May, 1927, Sir G. Clayton conducted further negotiations with Ibn Saud (who now proclaimed himself King of Nejd), for a treaty to replace the war-time treaty of 1916. The new treaty was signed at Jedda, on 20th May, 1927. Ibn Saud was recognised as King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its Dependencies, and, as in the original treaty, he agreed to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories on the Persian Gulf having special relations with Great Britain. The Ikhwan Revolt, 1926-1930 Frequent and successful campaigns and the prospect of loot, had kept the Ikhwan occupied and contented, but, after the conclusion of the campaign m the Hejaz, Ibn Saud found himself confronted with increasing unrest and discontent at home, which, during the next three years, was to test his hold over the Ikhwan. The instru ment was becoming stronger than its creator. The Ikhwan leaders, haisal al Dawish, paramount Shaikh of the Mutair, Sultan bin Humaid, Shaikh of the Ataiba, and Dhaidan al Hithlain, paramount Shaikh of the Ajman, three powerful Shaikhs of tribes of the north west, having defied Ibn Saud’s authority, agreed on mutual support in the event of Ibn Saud taking punitive action against them. The immediate cause of the revolt can be ascribed to Ibn Saud’s lailure to obtain, by negotiations with the British and ’Iraqi Governments the demolition of the ’Iraqi frontier post at Busaiya, which the Ikhwan looked upon as a threat to their freedom of access to certain favoured watering places. The failure of Ibn Saud to secure what they considered their right, coupled with Wahhabi fanaticism impelled the Ikhwan to take the law into their own oeace’on^h e f P e repeated 01 ' ders of Ibn Saud to maintain L hpq * t S e fro nber a campaign of murderous attacks on ’Iraq inhabitants\TR^ terntor y was be g un , the unarmed abitants of Busaiya being massacred while it was yet unfinished.In 1928, the Ikhwan became more and more threatening, raiding across the ’Iraq and Kuwait frontiers. The Royal Air Force, sup ported by the Navy at Kuwait, were engaged in active defensive measures. Ibn Saud managed to secure a temporary respite by promising to negotiate with the British and ’Iraq Governments for the abolition of the posts to which the Ikhwan objected. The Governments not agreeing, raiding again broke out in March, 1929, and Ibn Saud was forced to march against the rebels or lose all hope of controlling them in future. Meeting the Ataiba and Mutair rebels at Sibilla on the 22nd of March, 1929, he severely defeated them, the Shaikh of the Ataiba, Ibn Humaid, being captured and the Shaikh of the Mutair, Faisal al Dawish, being wounded. The rebellion had, however, become t 0 ° widespread to be ended by a single battle. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1929, Ibn Saud was engaged in breaking up the tribal combination, and by November Faisal al Dawish was contemplating surrender and his men were moving into the safety of Kuwait territory. At the end of December they were offered, and rejected, terms of surrender, and were subsequently shepherded towards the frontier of Kuwait by the Royal Air Force. By the end of the first week in January, the leaders were deserting their men and surrendering to the Royal Air Force, by whom they were subsequently handed over to Ibn Saud, the Ikhwan revolt thus coming to an end by the first week in February, 1930. Transjordan-Nejd Situation The situation between Transjordan and Nejd was not so satis factory, raiding from both sides of the frontier continuing with varying intensity throughout 1930. Attempts were made to improve the situation by a liquidation of claims in respect of past raids and an investigation was carried out by Mr. N. S. MacDonnell, as the result of which, further measures were taken to restrain the frontier tribes. Yemen and Asir, 1930 Ibn Saud now turned in the direction of Asir where since 1926, when the Idrisi had placed himself under the suzerainty of Ibn Saud, he had been gradually strengthening his position. In the spring of 1930, tribal unrest in Asir which Ibn Saud suspected had been inspired by the Imam Yahya of the Yemen, resulted in a Saudi commission being sent to Asir to study and report on the adminis tration of the country. 1 his ended in the annexation of Asir by Ibn Saud, although the Idrisi was allowed to remain as nominal head of the Government. 1931-32 During 1931, Ibn Saud was chiefly concerned with the internal affairs of Hejaz-Nejd, where owing to the falling off of the overseas pilgrimages from 80,000 in 1930 to some 40,000 in 1931, the financial situation had become extremely precarious. Nevertheless, the King maintained his grip on the country and was able to deal with a rebellion in the Northern Hejaz which started in May, 1931.18 Ibn Rilada Revolt, 1931 The leader of the incursion was an exile Shaikh, Ibn Rifada, who with a party of Billi tribesmen, had passed through Aqaba from Sinai and invaded the Hejaz. The number of rebels was only about 1,000 and they were inadequately armed and mounted' The expedition appears to have had the secret approval and encourage ment of the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. Measures were taken by the authorities in Transjordan, Palestine and Egypt to prevent su PPii es reaching the rebels by land and sea with the result that thev suffered from shortage of food. The Saudi Government took immediate military measures to deal with the situation and ordered out a levy from the village settlements in the nearer parts of Nejd to the number of 5,000 or 6,000 and sent reinforcements to strengthen the garrisons in the north. The rebels, who made slow progress down the coast, were encountered by the Saudi forces at Tabal Shar inland from the road between Dhaba and Muwaila, and were com- p etely defeated, Ibn Rifada being killed. It appeared afterwards that this adventure in the north should have synchronised with a rising m Asir, but it was November before Hassan al Idrisi, who had accepted the annexation of his country by Ibn Saud in 1931, put himself at the head of the new rebellion. The rebels took Jizan the seat of the Sa udi Governorate on 6th November, 1932, and interned the Amir and other officials, but, on the arrival of Saudi reinforce ments, Jizan was retaken and, by December, the authority of the Government had been restored.

Rome searched for Araby the Blest, the land of origin of frankincense and, as she thought, of other luxuries of the East coming to her through Arab traders. The Roman General kept his men together through a long march from the Northern Hejaz, down the great trade highway through the Yemen, and only turned back, disillusioned for ever about Araby the Blest, when within two days of the frankincense land of Hadhramaut; the motive for the expedition largely gone when he discovered the nature of the interior and the “ middleman ” nature of Arab trading. Hippalus’ discovery of the secret of the monsoon storm, gave to Rome the road to India, and she attempted no further invasion of inner Arabia. (b) The second great expedition was that sent from Egypt at the direction of the Sultan of Turkey to avenge the attacks on Damascus, Karbala, and Najaf, and the taking of Mecca and Medina by the Wahhabis, an expedition therefore entirely punitive. The Egyptian force, under Ibrahim Pasha, advanced on the Wahhabi capital, Daraya, and destroyed it, a long march into the heart of Arabia, for which Ibrahim Pasha craftily prepared by suborning tribe after tribe with gold, before advancing into their country. The troops employed were largely mamelukes, i.e., Christian slaves, many of whom would be Aryans. They were aided by French artillery officers.CHAPTER II SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 1. General Description Sa’udi Arabia is in theory one kingdom, having a constitution in the Hejaz but not in Nejd or the parts of Asir administered from Neid. The Hejaz constitution is of an elementary type. All authority is vested in the King, who is bound by the religious law. Certain powers, extensive on paper, are delegated to the Viceroy in the Hejaz, while provision is made for various councils and other administrative machinery, including an advisory legislative council and municipal bodies. In Nejd the tribal Shaikhs and heads of settlements retain much influence, although the King has representatives in some places who may be regarded more as officials in the European sense. All such officials and those in the Hejaz are liable to instant dismissa. by the King and, on the other hand, resignation is forbidden. 2. Central Government Nejd is governed like a Shaikhdom or congeries of Shaikhdoms, and the Government of Sa’udi Arabia is, in short, an autocracy, having, in the Hejaz, a constitutional flavour. H.M. The King. The Royal Diwan, or Secretariat. The functioning of the Government machine is so imprecise according to Western ideals that a tabular layout could not convey the system in use. The King appoints a number of Ministers who are separately responsible to him direct, in the case of affairs within the province of their function in Nejd, but only indirectly, through the Council of Ministers and via the Viceroy, in the Hejaz. The King spends about seven months in a yeai at Riyadh, the capital of Nejd, and, while there, his second son is Viceroy of the Hejaz. On arrival in the Hejaz, the Viceroyalty goes temporarily into abeyance, while the Heir Apparent usually fulfils the function of a Viceroy in Nejd until the King returns there. (a) Nejd In Nejd, the King deals direct with the Governors of the four largest provinces, and very often direct with the Governois of the lesser provinces, which, in theory, are under the control of tie22 Governors of the Greater Provinces. Similarly, he deals direct with the more important Shaikhs who, again more in theory than practice, are supposed to be under one or the other of the Provincial Governors! The Government of Nejd is, in fact, entirely autocratic except that the King abides, as in the Hejaz, by the decision of the Sharia or Koranic law judges. (The provincial divisions of Nejd will be found in paragraph 3 below.) 1 (b) The Hejaz (i) The Hejaz administrative machine is as follows H H. the \ iceioy . Ex-officio President of the Council of Ministers, as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs for the whole kingdom. The Viceregal Diwan or Secretariat.

Judicature [a) The Judicial Code The basis of the law of Sa’udi Arabia is the Koran, and, therefore, it is a code both religious and lay combined, which is administered by the Arabian doctors of the law. In other more progressive Muhammadan countries, civil law courts have been established or extensive additions to the original Koranic law have been made in order that the law may keep pace with changing human conditions. In Sa’udi Arabia, primitive conditions and puritanism have combined to preserve unmodified, the code in use in the 7th century. Ibn Sa’ud’s pronouncement to the Indian doctors of the law after the 1925 Pilgrimage, gives the Wahhabi standpoint. He said :— “ My belief and my confession of faith are those of the pious ancestors ; my rite is their rite. Whenever there is an explicit Koranic verse, or an authentic saying of the Prophet, or a prescription dating back to the first four Caliphs, confirmed by the unanimous conduct of the companions of the Prophet ; when agreement between the four Imams, founders of the juridicial rites, can be established, or agreement among their successors, the ’Ulama, without departing from the Koran and the Tradi tions, in all these cases I adopt no other beliefs, but profess what our pious predecessors professed.”(b) The Lawgivers The law, lay and religious, being one, the lawgivers are necessarily theologians as well as judges within the European sense of the word. The lawgivers (Arabic = ’Ulama, lit. learned men of the Muhammadan Code, the Shari'a) are :— (i) The leading ’Ulama (singular, Alim), who, consorting together, may issue “ fatwa,” religious pronouncements of sanction or prohibition, and these possess, in a negative way, considerable political power, being able, if so disposed, should the Koran support them, and its obscure ness often lends itself to opposite constructions, to forbid action contemplated by the authorities. (ii) The ’Ulama also appoint, from among their number, judges (singular, Qadhi) to administer the law in the public courts, and (hi) Vicars (Arabic = Mutawwa’, which is nearly “ one who brings into obedience ”), who are overseers of the law and every day conduct, and who act both as missionaries of the Wahhabi faith and chaplains to the Wahhabi forces. In addition, there is among the tribes, where resort to the Shari’a is often impracticable, an unofficial system. Disputants by mutual consent choose a referee, either a Shaikh or a “ Qadhi al Fana’a ” (judge of customary laws), to settle their case in accordance with tribal and Muhammadan traditions. The latter is merely a member of the tiibe who, by general consent, is accepted as a worthy and expert referee, being wise and well versed in their traditions. The gainer in the dispute usually pays him, in kind. (c) Merchants Assembly At Jedda, there is an exceptional body, the Guild of Merchants Assembly (the Mejlis at-Tujjar ”), which has magisterial powers to deal with disputes, primarily those arising out of trading disagi cements, for which the Koranic law does not cater. 5. System of Taxation and Finance {a) Absence of Statistics Neither the Hejaz nor Nejd has any public budget. No accurate idea can be formed of the revenue from customs, the pilgrimage and o her sources ; or of the expenditure on administration, military enterprise and equipment or the important item of doles to the tribes. All central finance is in the hands of one man, the Minister of mance. e lives from hand to mouth, collecting what he can and meeting or evading liabilities as best he can.27 (b) Revenue The chief sources of revenue are pilgrims and customs receipts. The pilgrimage varies in popularity, affected by political, religious and economic considerations in any given year. In 1927, the numbers exceeded 220,000, of which 130,000 are known to have come by sea. This is the greatest number recorded since the Great War and was thought by some to have constituted a record for any time. In 1928, about 101,000 came overseas, and in 1933 only 20,705 came by sea, while in 1935 some 50,000 came. No figures are available to indicate customs receipts, but they are, in any case, heavily mortgaged by the system of drafts which the Sa’udi Arab Government have adopted to an increasing extent in recent years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. The holders may import goods free of customs until the amount due to them is paid off. A third source of income is the tax sanctioned by religion, the “ Zakat ' or alms (collected from the tribes in the form of a poll tax in the spring). The Zakat from the tribes of Nejd goes into the Royal Treasury direct. That collected from the townsmen goes into the “ Public Treasury ” controlled by the Minister of Finance. (See appendix to this chapter for details of Zakat.) (c) Expenditure An important item of expenditure is military equipment and enterprise. There is an even bigger sum annually going into the Private Royal Treasury at Riyadh, but from this must be allowed the subsidies paid to the tribes by the King, and expenses of members of the Royal family. While the country, especially the Hejaz, appears always to be on the verge of bankruptcy and the Minister of Finance often avows his inability to pay Government debts, the Royal treasury at Riyadh never fails to provide considerable sums at short notice whenever really needed. It seems probable that the King inclines to regard the Hejaz, from a financial point of view, as a captured heretical country, from which there is Koranic sanction for wringing especially high sums. In any case, there is reason to believe that the budget could be balanced and debts paid off in a few years, if accountancy were improved and the drain to the private Royal coffers at Riyadh somewhat diminished. A. foreigner in Jedda, w r ho had opportunity of rough assessment of the position in 1926, stated that he believed the floating debt to amount to only about £500,000, the revenue to £3,400,000, and the expenditure to £3,300,000. Out of the latter, an item was £1,919,141 for the use of the King, a term which probably included his subsidies to the tribes. These figures, however, cannot be guaranteed.29 CHAPTER III POPULATION 1. Races The population of Saudi Arabia is, generally speaking, exclusively Semite Arab. From a scientific point of view, there are traces of other elements, remnants perhaps of invading races be f te £ indigenous populations, but they have now so merged with the Arab that the physical difference is not sufficiently marked to warrant attention in this report. . Such foreigners as have settled in the Hejaz are mentioned m the paragraph following this. (a) Distribution With the exception of the Ruba’ al Khali, the Empty Quartei, m the south-east, the population of this country is, generally speaking, equally distributed. The only considerable town is Mecca. (b) Numbers Estimate—no census has been taken. Area. Nomads. Settled.

An estimate of the non-Arab elements, of whom the majority are in the Hejaz, is as follows :— Africans, mostly Abyssinians and Takhrunis (Nigerians). Negro slaves .. • • • • • • . ’' Yellow races, mostly Javanese and Chinese Slavs, Turks, and Afghans .. Freed slaves .. Others 200,000 20,000 25.000 20.000 150,000 20,000 There are no Jews.{c) Characteristics While the Sa’udi Arabian settled in villages may have modified characteristics, it is with the Bedouin Arab that the general type is to be found. The Bedouin Arab character is paradoxical. Poverty-ridden and for ever in the closest contact with the bitter harshness of the desert, he appears at first an ignorant and superstitious savage. Nothing is more false. In spite of his rough appearance he can, after contact, never be mistaken for a barbarian. His language is rich and expressive, and he has a receptive intelligence. Nature has made of him a philosopher, but at the same time he is a strong individualist, consequently lacking the devotion to the general good. The depressing climate of the desert has aggravated this tendency, forcing him to live in isolation with his family and to wrangle with his neighbours over the scanty water supply and meagre pastures essential to the camel herds and flocks on which their and his life depends. On the other hand, in spite of this and his poverty, he will kill his last sheep in order to offer a fitting hospitality to a stranger guest. Clad in rags, he will boast of his ancestry, compose stirring ballads, and display the ease of bearing of a “ grand seigneur.” Figure of romance to the Western world, he is in fact hard, practical and often grasping. Puritanical, he is not prudish.’ Hysterical sometimes, he is never sentimental. Disliking bloodshed, he will yet maintain a blood feud to his fourth generation. A master of ruse, he can be chivalrous. His most indisputable characteristic is his tenacity, fruit of his ong struggle against implacable nature. I his tenacity has given him a temperament of steel, at once supple and resisting, and accounts for his defects of individualism, his sudden rages and the fervour of his lust or puritanism. It saves him, above all, from being commonplace. {d) Physique and value for Warfare in varying countries and climates 1 he extreme severity of life in the deserts, combined with an a most complete absence of medical knowledge, other than the use certain herbs, has ensured that only the very fittest of the Arabs ave survived Thus the Sa’udi Arabian is perhaps one of the fittest races in the world. A nomad Arab, with only a morsel of food and a sip of water or arunde^ hf 11 '- WiU Wa h tWenty or thirty m ‘ les a ^y, barefoot and under a blazing sun, with no apparent ill-effect. Nevertheless 'TucTw 10115 f n0t COm P let ely accustomed the body to such treatment, and the desert Arab dies young, usually some- 40 years 0f age ' An old man is often no more latL Llp a g H h U i 6y l? 5, C ° Unt him 101 ' Used t0 drinking and eating little and only at long intervals, and burnt up in a fierce sun,the Sa’udi Arab is small. His average height is near 5 ft. 5 in., his waist slender, no more than 20 in., his wrists, ankles and all the bones, diminutive. Oculists aver that the eye of a pure bred Bedouin Arab is the finest in the world and incapable of contracting eye diseases. He wears often the same clothes, no more than a ragged shift and a headkerchief, in winter and summer, and is accustomed to with standing great heat and great cold equally. Dying younger than European men, he also grows up quickly. Boys of 13 take the field, and at 16 have led forces with distinction. Between the ages of about 14 and 25 the average Arab is capable of withstanding almost any climate. It is his general characteristics and volatility rather than his physique that make the Sa’udi Arabian unadaptable to modern warfare. The ruse, the raid, “ reculer pour mieux sauter ” and nank attacks in open warfare, are the type of manoeuvre which he favours and in which he excels. Arms. See Chapter IX. 2. Attitude of Races towards each other and to Europeans (a) General All the inhabitants of Sa’udi Arabia are Arabs, but it is convenient for the purpose of this section to consider the people by their territorial divisions. (b) The Hejazi In the Hejaz, long contact with the outer world through the Hejaz ports and through the pilgrims who come from all over the Moslem world, has tended to make the Hejazi a better educated, if softer, creature than the Nejdi. Less inclined to warfare and several times victim of Nejdi fanaticism, the Hejazi, despises, while fearing, his Nejdi fellow subjects. He would be tolerant to Europeans if it were not for this fear of the Nejdi and for his own financial interest, which depend upon his keeping up the inviolability of the Hejaz as a Holy land foi pilgi ims, his chief source of income. (c) The Nejdi The Nejdi, on the other hand, is, generally speaking, uncom promisingly anti-European and anti everyone except a Nejdi. He holds in contempt the Hejazi and other Arabs as decadent and inclined to heresy in religion. Europeans can travel in Nejd only with the King’s protection, in Nejdi dress, wearing a beard, and otherwise conforming to their prejudices.32 {d) The Asiri The Asiri is less politically conscious than either the Nejdi or Hejazi. His contact with the outer world has latterly been less frequent than even that of the Nejdi. Villagers, absorbed in the tasks imposed by their agricultural life, their attitude is less well defined. They showed little enthusiasm for Nejdi occupation of their country, but did not strongly oppose it. They abhor Europeans, but perhaps less as a matter of religious principle or from conviction than from innate conservatism and fear of the unusual, common to all uneducated peasants. 3. Settled non-Tribal Peoples The settled non-tribal peoples of Sa’udi Arabia divide themselves into two, the “ Hadhr,” the long-settled villagers and townspeople, and the “ Ikhwan,” the people of the religious settlements, instituted only from 1912. {a) The Ikhwan {Al Ikhwan = The Brothers) (i) Historical Note .—Up to 1912, Wahhabism was made little of, by Ibn Saud. He, himself, had been brought up as a strict Wahhabi! but contact with the outside world had served to temper his faith with a measure of broadmindedness. The introduction of the Ikhwan movement is almost certainly to be traced to policy rather than to any sudden access of fanaticism. When he came to consider the problem of the future government of his volatile and unruly subjects, he turned to religion as the only possible effective binding force. The Bedouin could be roused to action by a call to arms in tl name of their faith ; but, so long as they retained their nomad an pastoral character, they could not be relied on for any permaner ettort m the peace which would invariably succeed the initi; necessary war At the same time, the internecine struggles of tl past decade had wrecked the economic prosperity of Nejd : and thei was work to do if hands could be found to do it. There was or a Jl t01 °t TT^ d societ y whlch wa s, and had been throughout tt ges, absolutely constant—an inherent tendency to desert th S ? nd ho P elessness of pastoral occupation for the superic Z “ la , nd COuld be found to settle Hither. on the nZ had b ? n ex P l0lted at the expense of the settled land Tran LZ nor f th - easte ™ borders of the Arabian deser tWs q tend d eneT la f , HeI ? cef orth. Arabia was entitled to benefit fror within her borH den ™ ns &gt; if could tempt them to remai po icv ^th a H m a “ 0rdlngly ’ Ibn Saud envisaged an agraria pTTZ the bent e f ° b i eCtlVe ’ namel y. the retention of hi! mar ZtribaTorLnZ Z State ' and the breakin g U P of it^ noma, and tribal organisation in the interests of the whole communityThe necessary spadework was done by the priests and preachers, x forth by him and his father to warn the tribes of the dangers by which they were menaced by the Turks and other infidels, and to summon them to joint action in defence of the faith. a t ft rs t, the response was very small. The majority of his rnnverts to the new idea were men of the Mutair tribe. They assumed the designation of Ikhwan to emphasise the link that bound them together and would extend, without distinction of class or tribe, to all who professed the same principles. The desert wells of Artawiya, in the Mutair country, were selected for the honour of being the first “ refuge ” of the faithful who were readv to leave their all—little enough in fact—to follow the banner of religion. The outward and visible nucleus of the new colony was a little mosque, built out of a subsidy from Ibn Saud. Round this, the settlers built their mud huts, marked out their patches of ground tor cultivation of grain for their immediate needs and planted young ■nalms for the years to come. But perhaps the most attractive feature of the colony in the eyes of most of its inhabitants was the free issue of arms and ammunition, proportionate to the numbers ot able-bodied citizens on the register of the mosque, which was also the local school not only for the children, but primarily for the grown-ups, determined to make amends for their misspent years by learning to read the sacred book, the Koran. Slowly the settlement grew until it became a town of 10,000 souls, surrounded by a great circuit wall, nucleus and cathedral city, as it were, of the Ikhwan movement. The diocese, if such it may be called, now comprises some two hundred other settlements scattered through Nejd, of which Artawiya is the model. (ii) Military Aspect. —The man-power of these colonies, each of which is in effect the cantonment of a permanent territorial force, constitutes the bulk of what may be considered Ibn Saud s standing army. They represent an effective weakening of the tribes f r( ? m which their population is derived, on the other hand a definite increase in the agricultural prosperity of the country ; and, above all, they keep alive the flame of religious zeal which in Arabia is equiva lent to, and at present the only substitute for, a national spirit and solidarity. [But see Appendix IV, page 130.) (iii) Distinguishing Dress. —The Ikhwan are recognisable from the twisted head band of stuff which they wear in place of the rope like “Agal ” of the Bedouin and most other Arabs. (iv) Pursuits and livelihood—To what extent self-supporting Seasons of crops, etc., and Vulnerability of settlements. See paragraph (p) under “ Hadhr.” (C 23593) c(C 23593) c 3 37 They incline to be much less fanatical although often equally observant of religious forms. Mecca is said, in Hashimite times, to have been one of the most immoral cities of the world. The inhabitants compose much the same elements to-day, and these, once released from Wahhabi Arab tutelage, would perhaps revert to a life of greater licence. It should be said that Jedda, Mecca, and Medina have very mixed populations, pilgrims from all parts of the world having stayed on to become citizens, while there are villages, here and there, in the Hejaz, almost exclusively populated by negroes, slaves or descendants of slaves. (ii) Attitude to Government. —Their attitude to government is not remarkable. They supply levies when ordered to do so with, apparently, commendable obedience and are, as far as is known, regular in their payment of taxes. Only in Asir is there a somewhat recalcitrant spirit among the villagers towards government, due to Asir having only recently come under Sa’udi governance and to religious differences. It is not strongly marked. (iii) Pursuits and more important means of livelihood. —Primitive agriculturalists, the inhabitants of the villages and oases live mostly by cultivating date palms. The dates are sold to the Bedouins, the palm wood is used for cooking, and the fibre for making ropes. They also have small flocks of goats and sheep, whose flesh they trade. Wheat, barley, and lucerne in small quantities, usually only enough for immediate local use, is grown. Cloaks and rugs are woven from camel, goat, or sheep hair. (iv) To what extent self-supporting. —They could exist for some time without exterior supply, but they have been so long accustomed to such commodities as sugar, tea, coffee, and cotton goods, which only reach them from outside their country, that they would now find their absence irksome at first and, in time, intolerable. (v) Seasons when crops are sown, cut, and stowed. — Ihe date harvest is in August, the fertilization, by hand, of the date-palm taking place in the early spring. Crops are wheat, barley, maize, and millet ; in the Hejaz there are two crops a year (Shitwi) or winter, and (Rabi a) spring to summer crop, the first depending upon the rain and the second upon irrigation and the lateness or otherwise of the Shitwi, itself varying with the rainfall in any year. (vi) Constructional vulnerability of houses to air bombardment and ground attack. —In the smaller villages the houses are built of clay, usually with an upper floor and often spacious. I he flooring is of beaten earth, the rafters of tamarisk or palm-beams. The roofs are flat. The village houses are easily destructible. In the towns of Nejd the houses are of similar construction, as are the forts of the Shaikhs and Amirs. In the coastal towns of the Hejaz, however,38 coral rock is used for building and the houses aie sometimes of three or four stories, and much better built. Woods from Java are used for rafters, flooring, and for elaborate carving of window frames and shutters. Nevertheless, Hejazi builders and the usually sandy foundation combine to give the houses a short life, and their destruction offers no great difficulty. 4. Tribal Element Nomadic Tribes. [See map facing page 40.) [a) Periods and Causes of Migration The Bedouins of Nejd are stationary on permanent wells from about the 15th June until the first plentiful winter rain, usually almost the last week in October. Where the permanent wells belonging to a tribe provide sufficient water, gardens and scanty crops are attempted and the Shaikhs will build forts. These they are obliged to leave, or leave only sparsely populated, to search for grazing for their camels, their chief source of wealth and livelihood, providing them as they do with wool, milk, meat, and when sold, cash. The grazing grounds for each tribe are, generally speaking, unvariable, and a similar circuit is made every year, varied only slightly, according to the whereabouts of the best rainfall in any given year. By June, casual water and the seepage in the wadis has failed them, and the grazing is no longer succulent enough to make absence from permanent wells possible. [b) Relations with Settled Tribes There is a tendency for the hardy nomads to regard the softer townspeople with some scorn, but as they are usually dependent upon them for their purchases, and very often require credit from them, this tendency is concealed. Their attitude to tribes settled in the oases is, in general, unremarkable. There must be remarked, however, the attitude of the Ikhwan to non-Wahhabis, and the massacre at Taif may be recalled to illustrate the possible attitude of the settled Ikhwan of Nejd to non-Wahhabi townsmen. during the Ikhwan advance into the Hejaz, they fe upon Tad, looted and destroyed it and killed the majority of tt inhabitants. Such was their religious zeal and lack of feeling fc townsmen of their own race. Historical parallels, cf. the sack c ^ ™ a f acre of 5,000 non-Wahhabi townsmen there i , of the inhabitants of the Qasim town of Anaiza an many o ers, i lustrate the permanency of this murderous intolerant y which the A1 Saud have hitherto profited.c 4 (C 23593) 39 (c) Vulnerability while on Migration The nomads are most vulnerable in the summer when compelled to stay near their permanent wells. While on the move they tend to break up into small parties, each following a minor Shaikh in search of grazing. Moreover, any attack by air alone serves to break them up even more. The best effect is obtainable by a combined air and armoured car operation, the cars shepherding them and preventing them scattering. Very early morning, before the sun is an hour above the horizon, is a profitable moment to attack an encampment as many of the herds would probably still be by the camp. (Herds sometimes remain away from the tents, under their camelherds for several days, according to grazing, and thus an encampment may sometimes be found to have no camels within sight and hardly anybody except old men, women, and babies left in it. The herds on such occasions are said to be “ Mu'azib.”) (For note on the nomad’s method of warfare see Chapter IX.) (d) Leading Tribes of Sa’udi Arabia The leading tribes (for details see Chapter IX) are as follows :— (i) Nejd. Mutair. Harb. Ataiba. Subaih. Dawasir. Ajman. Awazim. Suhul. A1 Murra. Qahtan. (ii) The Hejaz. Part of Huwaitat and Shararat. Bani Atiya. Billi. Juhaina. The Anaiza clans of al Aida, A1 Fajir, and Wuld Sulaiman. Part of the Harb and Ataiba. Thaqaif. Ashraf clans. Juhadila. Bani Husan. (hi) ’Asir. Rabia’ tribes. Rijal al Ma’. Zahran. Shahran.5. Religion (a) General . The state religion of Saudi Arabia is Islam (Muhammadanism), of the Wahhabi code. An exact estimate of the number of the population following this code is not possible, more especially as a number of the tiibesmen in Nejd, and large numbers of the tribesmen and townsmen of the Hejaz, followers of the Abu Hanifa school of the Sunni, are now obligatorily tinged with Wahhabism in their practices. In paragraph [d) below, an estimate is made of the minority sects. Probably under a third of the total population are willing Wahhabis. (b) Brief note on Wahhabism The Encyclopaedia Islamica or Encyclopaedia Britannica may be consulted for a description of the sects mentioned in this section of the report, but a brief note on Wahhabism is here given for convenience. Properly speaking, the Wahhabi belief is not sectarian, but represents the purity of Muhammadanism, as revealed by the Prophet of orthodox Islam. Outside Wahhabism, in all the great Muhammadan centres, Islam has adapted itself to changing human conditions. Various sects favoured various means to this end. Innovations by general consent, and the reading into “ the traditions ” of the Prophet’s sayings (many of doubtful authenticity), of instructions which could be applied to cases arising out of con ditions non-existent in the Prophet’s day, enabled Islam to adapt itself to a progressing world. Zealots were not wanting who slowed up this process. The most singular of these was one Ibn Taimiyya, a Syrian logician and an indefatigable detector of heresies who lived, mostly in prison for his opinions, in the 14th century. He was an adherent of the Hanbalite school, and demanded the most drastic punishments for any departure from the purity of revealed Muhammadanism. His polemical pamphlets bore suggestive titles, such as the Unsheathed Sword,” and his intemperate zeal, nourished by an incontestable erudition, led to disturbances wherever he went. It was a follower of the tenets of this martyr (for Ibn Taimiyya died in prison in Damascus), one Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab of Awaina (or Uyaina) in Nejd, who was to put new life into this extreme Islamic puritanism, in the 18th century. Himself the son of a Hanbali “Alim,” Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab studied in Medina, and there was fired with enthusiasm for the works of Ibn Taimiyya. His criticism of existing customs at Medina led to his being expelled, and, removed to Basra, he was again expelled for the same reason.41 Returned to his own country, he found a convert of some importance in Muhammad ibn Saud, Amir of Daraya in Nejd, who became his stepson. Aided by the Amir, he imposed on Nejd, partly by persuasion, partly by force, his creed, which became the state religion of Nejd. The innovator took up all the themes of his master, Ibn Taimiyya. In order to restore Islam to the golden age of his Prophet and his Companions, he preached the return to the two sources of revelation, the Koran and the early Sunna (collected “ customs ”). He pro scribed all speculative glosses and the traditions. He condemned all innovations whereby Islam has attempted to adapt itself to changing conditions. He preached this, fortunately for him, in the only place where life was, and still is, hardly changed from what it was in the 7th century, and where it was possible to practice what he preached. From polemics, the Wahhabis, as they came to be called, soon passed to action, pillaging the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, in 'Iraq. Masters of Central Arabia, they seized Mecca and Medina in 1803 and 1804. They massacred and plundered the Hejazi “ infidels,” as they called their more enlightened brothers in Islam, until they were subdued by an Egyptian expedition. Force of arms, then and more recently, alone has kept these iconoclasts of Nejd within bounds. To them, in theory at least, everything for which sanction cannot be found in the two sources, is best destroyed or avoided, among them in material things: domes, tobacco, wine, silk, coffee. Music, gambling, swearing except by God, portrayal of the human form, are also anathema. The five daily prayers are most strictly insisted upon. The gates of their settlements are shut at the time of their prayers. Everyone must go to the mosque, and proctors, armed with rods, stalk the streets to drive in the laggards. To the Wahhabi, the heretical followers of other codes within Islam are even more blameworthy than the Christian or the Jew, who, fortunately for them, do happen to be mentioned as existing, in the Koran. (c) The Pilgrimage The great annual pilgrimage, or ' Hajj,” from all parts of the Moslem world to Mecca, and in lesser degree to Medina, has important bearings on politics, economy, and popular character in Arabia. The pilgrimage is held as prescribed by Chapter 96 of the Koran and is enjoined as ensuring merit. The pilgrimage must be performed on the tenth day of the last month (Dhi al Hijja) of the Moslem lunar year. Like all other Moslem months, this moves round the solar year, and in 1935 corresponded nearly with March. The state of security thought to exist, world economic conditions and religious aspects, all affect the number arriving. Whenever the tenth day of Dhi al Hijja falls on a Friday (Hajj al Akbar) there comes a much larger number than at other times.Pilgrims arrive by various routes, but the majority come by sea and land at Jedda, proceeding to Mecca by camel-litter or motor-car. A small proportion come by various routes across Arabia or land at other ports in the Red Sea. Attempts are being made to improve these overland communications, and it is likely that they will be more used in the future. The only cross-desert car tracks yet officially approved for pilgrims are— [a) that from Najaf, in 'Iraq, via Hail to Medina. {b) the tracks from Najaf and from Kuwait via Riyadh to Mecca. The pilgrimage numbers vary widely, but an average annual influx by sea might be put at 40,000 persons. All go to Mecca, but only about a third go on to Medina. Not all, however, arrive at once for the season of the Great Pilgrimage (Hajj). Besides the possibility of making a minor pilgrimage (’umra) at any time of the year, many pilgrims are induced to arrive early, more than two months before the Great Feast (Td al Adha or Td al Kabir), which marks the pilgrimage proper, and perform “ ‘umra ” daily, thus accomplishing “ Tammatti ” (possession) and enhancing their merit. The Hejazis have developed a regular organization for main taining and increasing the supply of pilgrims, as well as for exploiting them on arrival. In the early months of the year, their agents are busy in all parts of the Moslem world, preaching the necessity of pilgrimage and offering (on commission) to arrange the journey, provide for lodging in Hejaz, and see the pilgrims through the obligatory ceremonies. When the time comes, some of these agents personally conduct parties or rich individuals to Hejaz, while at the ports or places of arrival, ciceroni (metawwafin) await unaccompanied pilgrims, or such parties as are too large for their conductors. These ciceroni are organized under Shaikhs, represent different Islamic countries, and wear a special dress of bright colours and a straw cap. Since they speak various languages, and many of them are travelled men, they offer, with the consular and customs agents, the main obstacle which non-Moslems in disguise, or foreign Moslems desirous to conceal their identity, have to face if they wish to perform the Hajj. They are all prepared to place the pilgrim, according to his nationality, in lodgings belonging either to themselves or others, ilecca in particular containing houses and apartments much in excess of the needs of its permanent inhabitants. Medina, owing to its more exclusive population and its smaller number of visitors, o ei s greater risks than Mecca, and its metawwafin are more difficult to evade. who before entering the haram (sacred vicinity of lecca), must have discarded the razor and his head and foot gear and assumed the ihram (a primitive dress consisting of two towel-like cotton cloths fastened round the body without the aid of knots or pms), spends the first seven days in circumambulating the Ka’bah seven times (fawaf), walking and running seven times between twohills, Safah and Merwah, each side of Mecca (sai), praying, attending sermons, visiting various traditional and holy sites near the city, etc. On the eighth, clad again in the ihram, he begins the most obligatory of all the ceremonies, the true “ Pilgrimage.” It consists in the visit to Arafat, a hillock in a plain, on the la if road, under Jabal Qura. This trip, which used to be by no means without danger, both on the road and in camp, despite the strong escorts provided, is obligatory not only on all visitors, but also, year by year, on all able-bodied citizens of Mecca, from the King downwards ; and in the opinion of most authorities it is the duty which, rather than any performed in Mecca itself, confers the coveted title of hajji. The total number of those who march to ’Arafat and back, amounts normally to little under half a million. The enormous crowd bivouacs in and around village of Munah the first night, and, with daybreak on the ninth day, proceeds another nine miles to ’Arafat to perform the “ Stand ” on the hill, praying, ejaculating “ Labbeika,” and hearing addresses until sundown. Returning to Munah for the night, the pilgrim performs there another “ Stand ” on the morning of the tenth day, throws a fixed number of selected stones at certain devil-pillars, and offers a blood-sacrifice, usually a sheep or a goat, which he is at liberty to eat or give away. Then he must make post-haste for Mecca in the midst of indescribable confusion. In the city on that afternoon, he should perform tawaf and sai, and kiss again the Holy Stone of the Ka’bah ; and then, shaved and in secular dress, get back before dark to Munah for the day of the great feast. This he may celebrate partly at Munah, where many, especially those performing the pilgrimage for the first time, stay on for the three “ Days of ‘ Drying Flesh ’ ” (Ayyam at-Tashriq), partly at Mecca. The pilgrims leaving by sea on their return, pass through one of the Quarantine Stations, the chief of which are as follows ;— Tor, Sinai, maintained by the International Quarantine Board of Egypt. Kamaran Isles, maintained by agreement between the Dutch East Indies Government and the Government of India. Suakin, maintained by the Government of the Sudan. [d) Minority Sects and other Religions (i) Islam. — {a) Shiahs .—There is in Sa’udi Arabia a total of about 75,000 Shi’ahs, distributed as follows :— Al Hasa and certain sections of the Bani 25,000 Khalid tribe. Al Qatif (descendants of the Carmathians, 40,000 who in the 10th century, invaded Mecca and removed the black stone from the Ka’aba). Others on islands along the Hasa coast, on Tarout, Darin, Jinna, Abu 'Ali, and others. The Hejaz .—Mostly in the cities of Mecca 10,000 and Medina.44 (b) Shafai .—The main block of the Asir tribes and some in the Hejaz plains belong to the Shafai Sect of the Sunni School. (The followers of this sect are antipathetic to Shi'ahism, and Zaidism in particular, but sympathetic to Wahhabism.) Probable number about 100,000. (c) Zaidis .—On the Yemen frontier in the mountains of Asir there are a number of tribes belonging to the Zaidi sect. The approximate number may be 40,000. (d) Miscellaneous .—In Mecca and to a lesser extent in Medina are representatives of many different sects and schools of Islam, mostly non-Sa’udi Arabians, come on the pilgrimage and, for one reason or another, having stayed on. (ii) Non-Muslim .—There are no Jews in Sa’udi Arabia. The only Christians are members of the foreign colonies in Jedda. 6. Languages The language used everywhere in Sa’udi Arabia is Arabic. There is a variation in vocabulary between the various tribes and between the tribes and towns, in their spoken language. The nomads’ vocabulary, containing, as it necessarily does, a large number of words having reference to their camel herds, grazing and desert life, is very often incomprehensible to the townsmen of the Hejaz. Generally speaking, the dialects of the tribes are much purer than that of the townsmen. They all agree in pronouncing each letter with much precision, expressing its exact force, which, with respect to the letters ^ , is hardly ever the case among the inhabitants of the towns. They likewise refuse to make use of the slang and corrupt phrases in use among the settled Arab peoples outside Arabia proper. They always speak with grammatical accuracy, and, in general, the best Arabic spoken anywhere is that spoken in the deserts of Sa udi Arabia, its purity having probably been preserved, in spite of an absence of books or writing, by the Bedouin practice of learning by heart and reciting poetry. 7. Interpreters Interpreters are rarely to be found. In Jedda and Mecca there are a number of Indians speaking indifferently well both languages, who could be used for translating in the towns. The Sa udi Arab Government employs a small number of Syrians as officials who are educated and speak two or three languages, usually including French or English, or both.English is the only foreign language included in the curriculum of the few schools existing in the Hejaz, and it is possible that a larger number of English-speaking Sa’udi-Arabs will be available in the future. 8. Education Little information is available on the subject of Education. In the Hejaz, the Government appear to have preserved to a large extent the old Turkish system of primary and secondary schools, and there are in Mecca, Jedda, and Medina a certain number of private schools with which the Government do not interfere unduly, although they are inspected. The educational system is dominated by the importance attached to religious studies, but, at least in the provinces of the Hejaz and Hasa, purely Wahabi teaching is not insisted on in all cases, and a certain amount of secular instruction is imparted. There is no evidence of an organized educational system in Nejd, where the chief means of instruction is that afforded by mullahs teaching in the mosques. In past years a few students have been sent abroad, under Government or private auspices, but the impoverishment of the Treasury and of private benefactors has reduced the number to a very low ebb. There is no provision for female education in schools, girls being left to get what they can from private tuition in their homes, or from mistresses teaching the Koran, some Arabic and needlework, in their own houses. In 1933, a Board of Education composed of the Acting Director of Education and four other persons, was created by Royal decree. The Sa’udi Minister in London held the post of Director of Education and continued to do so in 1935. The Sa’udi Arab Government maintain schools at Mecca catering for some 1,300 students. These include a teachers’ training college, a secondary school, and a religious training centre. Private schools in Mecca have approximately 2,000 students with 100 teachers. At Jedda, the Government maintain a secondary and a primary school for not more than 200 pupils. The principal educational establishment is the Madrassat al Falah, part of the foundation of the same name at Mecca, with some 700 pupils and 24 teachers. At Medina, the Government secondary and primary schools have an attendance of about 600 pupils, but the most important educa tional establishment is the Madrassat al ‘Ulum ash Shariya, which is supported by Indian benevolence. This gives secular, as well as religious, education, and has industrial classes. It caters for about 250 students. There is also an orphanage accommodating about 100 boys, privately maintained, which provides religious, secular and industrial training.9. Normal Diet (a) Bedouin Staple Diet. Camel milk. Flour and camel’s milk mess. Dates. Coffee (in theory, forbidden to the Wahhabis, but now used). On the Indian or eastern side of Arabia rice is more consumed than flour ; on the western (Egyptian and Syrian) side, flour more than rice. Variations. Date juice. Curds. Messes of rice and camel’s milk or wheat mess dried then boiled with butter. “ Wild ” bread made from seeds of desert plant “ samh.” Luxuries. Rice and mutton or rice and camel. Bustard. Truffles. Certain small animals such as the so-called “ desert rats.” Locusts. Gazelle. Hare. Liquids other than water. Coffee. Tea. Camel milk, fresh or curdled. {h) Townsmen Same as [a), but with meat and rice almost daily, and fruit such as pomegranates, apricots, and sweet lemons daily when in season. Herbs and spices are often used in cooking and also added to coffee and tea as a luxury. Arak, a spirit made from dates, is sometimes drunk by the less religious on the Hejaz coast. 10. Labour None organized. For labour in Jedda see Chapter IV.11. Sectual Distribution Broadly estimated, the numerical Sa’udi Arabia is as follows :— distribution of sects in Nejd. Wahhabi Shafai Hanafi Shi'ah Hejaz. Shafai Hanafi Shi'ah A sir. Shafai Hanafi Zaidi .. 70 per cent. 20 8 2 &gt; f f) Area of Predomination. Central Nejd. N. and W. Nejd. S. Nejd and towns. Hasa. .. 64 „ Tribes. .. 35 „ Towns. 1 „ Suburbs of Medina (date cultivators). 80 15 5 yy yy yy S. Border. The Shafai, therefore, predominate in the country as a whole, the Wahhabi and Hanafi being about equal in numbers and coming next, with the Shi'ahs and Zaidis in small minorities, while Sufism is completely in abeyance, at Wahhabi orders, and impossible to estimate. Political dominance is in the hands of the Wahhabis, which tends to obscure their numerical inferiority, especially as many people bow to the prevailing religious wind and appear more Wahhabi than they really are.49 CHAPTER IV POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY 1. General Description and Area of Country (a) Area Sa’udi Arabia occupies two-thirds of the Arabian Peninsula, an area of roughly 700,000 square miles or about the same as that of India. {b) Imperial Communications It is passed on one side by the main Imperial sea route and on the other by the main Imperial air route. Neither route has places of call in Sa’udi Arabia. Its inhabitants, as outlined in Chapters II and III of this report, have shown themselves to be extremely conservative, and the Sa’udi Arab Government is slow to welcome foreign commercial exploitations or offer landing facilities to air liners. The shortest line of flight between Cairo and Bahrain would pass over Hail, the northern city of Sa’udi Arabia, formerly seat of the Ibn Rashid dynasty and independent, where there is, in the immediate vicinity of the city, an area naturally suitable for landing of aircraft. Under Sa’udi Arabian rule, the city is not accessible to Europeans. The present Imperial air route passes through Kuwait, Bahrain, and Sharjah, all close to the Sa udi Arab frontier, the first and last being on Arab soil and having frontiers open to Sa’udi Arabia, while Bahrain Island, off the coast, has inhabitants mainly Arab, many being in close family and trade relations with the people ot Sa’udi Arabia. (c) Unsettled Southern Frontiers In the south-east, little is known, either to Europeans or to the Sa’udi Arab authorities, of the country and people. The frontiei would run through the sparsely populated sand country, beyond which, and between Sa’udi Arabia and Muscat, there rules an almost unknown political quantity, the Imam Khalili, who is inimica to the Sultan of Muscat, as well as other little known independent minor shaikhs. In the south, the Imam Yahya of the Yemen has shown in the recent past (see Chapter I, page 18) a desire to penetiate Sa udi Ara la and was only restrained by force of arms.{d) Settled Northern Frontiers The whole northern frontier, that with 'Iraq and Transjordan has been the subject of settlement in treaties {see Chapter iv’ pages 51, 52, for details), and on the Iraq and Transjordan side aii administration controls up to the frontiers. {e) Coastline The whole Arabian sea coast, on both east and west, has since the earliest times been infamous to sailors for its inaccessibility owing to shallowness and reefs and its foul coral anchorages, conditions which apart from any other factors, help to maintain the isolation of Saudi Arabia. (For further detail of Coastline see Chapter V, page 79) Sloops of the Royal Navy patrol both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and call at their ports periodically. (/) Special Conditions on East Coast Six independent Shaikhs of the eastern coast of Arabia whose territories, if not abutting, are open towards an undefined’ Saudi Arabian frontier, are in special treaty relations with Great Britain. They are— Abu Dhabi. Dibai. Sharjah. Ajman. Umm al Oawain. Ras al Khaima. These are Shaikhs of what was formerly known as the Pirate coast and is now referred to as Trucial Oman, which extends from Khor al Odaid, m the south-east of the Qatar peninsula to the south border oi Kas al Jibal, the northern promontory of Oman. The more important land communications of Trucial Oman converge upon the Biraimi oasis, which is connected by various routes Arabiari ^ 11 fu a Khaima ' Diba h Sohar, and the Sa udi Arabian province of Hasa.

Near the coast in the eastern half of the country, too, is the capital Riyadh and the strongest military province, Aridh. The great annual pilgrimage to Mecca, in the Hejaz, necessarily, however, causes consular and political interests to be roused and centred in the port for Mecca, Jedda, in the Red Sea, where are stationed in consequence and by tradition the various consular offices. Since the Great War, diplomatic representatives have also become established in Jedda. 2. Description of Frontiers (a) ’Iraq-Nejd (Sa’udi Arabia) Frontier The frontier between ’Iraq and Nejd (Sa’udi Arabia) is laid down by the Uqair Protocol (to the Mohammerah Agreement) of 2.12.1922 and is as follows :— “ {a) The frontier from the East begins at the junction of the Wadi al ’Aujah (W. el Audja) with al Batin and from this point the Nejd frontier passes in a straight line to the well called Al Wuqubah (El Ukabba) leaving Al Dulaimiyah (Dulaimiya) and Al Wuqubah (El Ukabba) north of the line and from Al Wuqubah (El Ukabba) it continues N.W. to Bir Ansab (Bir Unsab). (b) Starting from the point mentioned above, i.e., from the point of the junction of the Wadi al ’Aujah (W. el Audja) with Al Batin (El Batin) the ’Iraq boundary continues in a straight line N.W. to Al Amghar (El Amghar) leaving this place to the south of the line and from thence proceeds S.W. in a straight line until it joins the Nejd frontier at Bir Ansab (Bir Unsab). (c) The area delimited by the points enumerated above which includes all these points will remain neutral and common to the two Governments of ’Iraq and Nejd who will enjoy equal rights in it for all purposes. (d) From Bir Ansab (Bir Unsab) the boundary between the two states proceeds N.W. to Birkat al Jumaimah (Birkat el Djumeuma) and from thence northwards to Bir al ’Uqbah (Bir al Akaba) and Qasr Uthaimin (Kasr Athmin) from there westwards in a straight line passing through the centre of Jal al Batn (Djal el Batn) to Bir Lifiyah (Bii Lifa) and then to Bir al Mana’iyah (Bir el Maniya) and from there to Jadidat ’Ar’ar (Dja-daidat el Arar) from there to Mukur and from Mukur to the Jabal ’Anazan (Anaza) situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection oi latitude 32° N. with longitude 39° E. where the Iraq-Nejd boundary terminates.”52 (b) Kuwait-Nejd (Sa’udi Arabia) Border The Kuwait-Nejd boundary convention, signed at Uqair on 2nd December, 1922, fixes the border between these two states. It commences in the west from the junction of the Shaib al Auja with the Batin, leaving the water holes of Al Riqai to Nejd, and proceeds in a straight line to the point where Ash Shaqq crosses 29° North latitude. Thenceforward it continues in a semi-circle and terminates on the coast just south of Ras al Qali’ah. A neutral area in which both Governments will enjoy equal rights is defined by the treaty as being bordered on the north by the frontier already described, on the west by As Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a line passing from west to east from Ash Shaqq to Ain al Abd and thence to the coast north of Ras al Misha’ab. (c) Hejaz-Nejd-Transjordan Frontier (i) The Eastern Frontier of Transjordan with Nejd (Sa’udi Arabia). —This is laid down by the Hadda Agreement of 2.11.25, and is as follows :— ' The frontier between Nejd and Transjordan starts in the north-east from the point of intersection of meridian 39° E. and parallel 32° N., which marks the termination of the frontier ^ between Nejd and ’Iraq, and proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 37° E. to the point of its inter section with parallel 31° 25’ N. From this point, it proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 38° E. and parallel 30° N., leaving all projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan in Nejd territory ; and thence proceeds along meridian 38° E. to the point of its intersection with parallel 29° 35' N. The map reierred to in this agreement is that known as the ‘ International ’ Asia Map, 1 : 1,000,000.” (n) The Southern Frontier of Transjordan with the Hejaz (Sa’udi Jf a * 'T - ^? aS ^ ) r e ® n finally settled. During the negotiations for e nglo-Hedjaz-Nejd Treaty in May, 1927, the situation was discussed and an exchange of letters resulted : Sir G. Clayton to I bn Saud His Majesty’s Government regard the frontier between Hedjaz and Transjordan as being defined as follows ' The frontier between the Hedjaz and Transjordan starts irom the intersection of meridian 38° E. and parallel 29° 35' N. and proceeds in a straight line to a point on the Hedjaz ai way miles south of Mudawara, thence in a straight line Akaba &gt; ’' lt ^ ^ GUlf ° f Akaba ’ 2 miles south of the town of53 Ibn Saud to Sir G. Clayton Notes His Majesty’s Government’s decision, but finds it impossible to effect a final settlement. Expresses his willingness to maintain the status quo in the Maan-Akaba district and promises not to interfere in its administration until favourable circumstances permit a final settlement of this question. (d) Oman, Hadhramaut Sa’udi Arab Frontier Reserved for discussion between the authorities concerned. (e) Qatar Sa’udi Arab Frontier Reserved for discussion. (/) Yemen-Sa’udi Arab Frontier Article 4 of the Treaty of Taif (1934) described this frontier, referring, in language the sense of which is sometimes obscure, to many topographical features and minor tribal sections which are unknown to us. In so far as the coastal end of this frontier is concerned, verbal enquiries from official Sa udi Arab sources have established that the frontier line is considered to begin at a point 12 miles north of Medi, runs east-north-east through the country of the Bani Muhammad, through A’afl and Wa’alan, thence it swings north-north-west leaving Tabal Razih to the Yemen and the Harruth tribal area two-thirds to Sa’udi Arabia and one-third to the Y emen, thence passing thiough Jabal Faifa leaving Nathir to the Yemen and the Bam Malik to Sa’udi Arabia, turning northwards again it passes through Hars and Wadia. In the words of the treaty :— “ The frontier line begins at the post on the Red Sea between Medi and al Musim and thence to the Jebel Tihama in the east, then it returns northwards until it reaches the north-west frontier which is between Bani Jamaa and what is opposite to its frontier direction of the west and north, then it goes o® to the east until it reaches the frontier Naqa’a and Wa ar, which both belong to the tribe of Waila, and between the frontier of the Yam, then it goes off until it reaches Marwan Pass and Aqaba cliff, then it goes to the east until it reaches the marches betw een ’Adaiam and Hamdan bin Zaid the Waili and others, and between the Yam and everything on the right side of the afore mentioned line up from the aforementioned Post which is on the sea coast, until the frontier is reached, in direction of the hills mentioned, is to the Yemeni Government and everything on the left of the line mentioned is to the Sa udi Arab Government.54 The treaty then details at great length the names of persons and tribal sections describing which Government they come under. To the Yemen. Medi Harrudh. Some of the Harruth tribe. (The difference in spelling of the two preceding words is faithfully translated from the original Sa’udi Arab Green Book.) A1 Mir. Jabal adh Dhahir. Some of the villages and country of Razih. All hills and country of the Bani Jama’a. Naqaa. Waar. 3. Administrative Divisions [See Maps of Tribal and Administrative Divisions.) (a) Hejaz The situation, within their country, of that great source of income, Mecca, a less nomadic life by reason of the physical difference of the Hejaz, and the lingering characteristics due to their non-Semite Arab origin, give the majority of the people of the Hejaz a political outlook somewhat at variance with, and more self-centred than, that of the Central Arabian people, whose normal ranges are much greater. That great barrier (the Hejaz, properly speaking) of tortuous valleys and hills, some 8,000 ft. high, between them and Nejd, further tends to divide them. The Nafud sands also restrict com munication between the northern Hejaz and Nejd. A separate administration under a Viceroy is the necessary result of this. It should be noted, however, that through the opening afforded by the Wadi Hamdh, pure-blooded Arabs like the Harb have remained with their western wing upon the Red Sea coast and that in the north, Anaiza nomads from Syria come down to round about Jauf to their traditional grazing grounds, in most years. Their chief, who does not come down with them, is Ibn Sha’alan, who has his summer headquarters in Damascus. (b) Jabal Shammar The former independent Amirate of Hail (see Chapter I) had long enjoyed a reputation of being more liberally minded and better maintaining the standards of Arabian culture than the more southern Nejdis, and this in spite of a murderous ruling family. . Th e Amirate was the focal point of the great Shammar confedera tion which ranges from near Medina as far north as Mosul and the Jabal Sinjar in ’Iraq.55 The official frontier between ’Iraq and Sa’udi Arabia has not cut off the Shammar from one another. Sections in Sa’udi Arabia may be found duplicated in ’Iraq and ’Iraq Shammaris frequently cross the frontier between the two states. (The sole survivor of the Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail outside Sa’udi Arabia, the Amir Muhammed Ibn Abdur Rahman al Rashid, lives in Baghdad, and is much visited by travelling Shammaris. The heir, Abdulla Ibn Mitaab, and 40 households of the Bani Rashid live in Riyadh, political detenues, on the bounty of Ibn Saud.) At the same time, the great Nafud sands are a barrier to easy communication between Hail, the capital of Jabal Shammar, and the north and north-west (Transjordan), and therefore Hail remains somewhat isolated, if with special interests to the north-east in the direction of and in Iraq. (c) Qasim Qasim is rich in oases, and here flourishes urban Arabian life in greater degree than anywhere else in Sa’udi Arabia, with the exception of the capital, Riyadh. The merchants of Qasim have connections far afield, and many have visited and correspond with India and other countries interested in the purchase of her products, chiefly dates, horses, camel hair and wool, and returning to her her needs in imports. More than one family of the merchant princes of Qasim traces its pedigree far or can point to mention in Arab histories when Arabian dynasties, now old, were still unheard of. Little spoken of in the militarily-minded ruling circles of Arabia, Qasim is nevertheless important as a revenue-bearing area of excep tional richness in Arabia. The Qasim province has therefore an outlook of its own and tends to affinity with the outside world more than the nomad com munities on whom, however, it is necessarily dependent on its trading operations. {d) Aridh Aridh has long been an area in which Arabian dynasties have grown from strength to strength until they met their match. Old capitals are numerous. Among these are Daraya (Al Saud, first Wahhabi phase), ruined. ’Awaina (Ibn Muammar), ruined. Hariq (Ibn Huzaini), and Hauta (Ash Shaqrani). There are many others less well known. That Aridh and the neighbourhood of the present capital of Sa’udi Arabia, Riyadh, should be the area in which exceptional dynasties have risen to power is accounted for by the combination of various factors, a combination non-existent or less full elsew ere in Sa’udi Arabia.56 They are— (1) The central Arabian plateau affords rich grazing for an immense number of camels and nomad life, being here at its best, affords a well-spring of Arabian manhood from which rank and file may come. (2) The distance from either coast spells isolation, in which young dynasties have flourished without external inter ferences and sometimes, in the past, without being known until well established. (3) Isolation in the deserts tends to create a narrow-minded man and, in the case of the Moslem Arab, this fervour tends to take a military religious line and gives him an incentive not otherwise {e.g., on national grounds) common in the Sa'udi Arabian. (4) Economic advantages are derived from— (a) the agricultural prosperity arising out of the rainfall caused by the Jabal Tuwaiq ; and (b) the junction of the main lateral track across Arabia, Persian Gulf to Red Sea, with tracks north to Qasim and south to the Wadi Dawasir and Ranya oasis area. Somewhere therefore in the area about Riyadh there must necessarily be a city, the ruler of which will be rich and have a virile nomad population to draw upon for supporters. Politically, Aridh is the most important province of Sa’udi Arabia, the main spring of the whole country. {e) Hasa The province of Hasa has long had, through Persian Gulf trade, connections in its coastal districts with Persia and India. Some foreign blood is mixed with that of the coastal “Arabs.” The result manifests itself in the hold which Shi’ahism has taken. In the south, the people are wilder than anywhere else in Sa’udi Arabia, people of the Al Murra, and other tribal units, who penetrate into the Empty Quarter, the Great Sand Desert, still only partly explored, and on whom any Government control is necessarily of the lightest kind. From Hofuf (Hasa) and to the north, there are still numerous remnants of tribes of former greatness. Among them are the Bani Khalid, whom Bertram Thomas has suggested can be identified with the Chaldeans. 1 heir Amirs ruled Hofuf and Hasa until the advent of the Al Saud, and their descendants are still living in Riyadh. Also the Mutair, famous in Arab history, a section of which, marching in the Arab van at their conquests of the Western Mediterranean seaboards, remains in Tunisia, in North Africa, to this day-for an here at 3d from i which il inter- l known led man tends to icentive i in the USE ONLY in Saudi Arabia \ rainfall Arabia, .sim and :ea.

Hofuf is the main oasis, walled, defended by outlying forts and with a strong citadel, the Kut, which dominates the town. Chief export, Khalas dates. W/T. (vi) Jedda. — [a) General Position — Importance. —Headquarters of a Kaimakamate. The chief port of Sa udi Arabia, Jedda lies almost exactly half-way down the western (Red Sea) coast of Sa’udi Arabia. Forty-five miles inland from it is Mecca, for which it is the port for the disembarkation not only of supplies, but for the majority of the pilgrims coming for the annual Hajj. It had, during the second half of the last century, some importance as an entrepot for the Sudan and as a coaling station for vessels unable to make the whole length of the Red Sea without refuelling. Increased security in the Sudan, the construction of a port at Port Sudan, and greater capacity of steamers ha,s reduced the importance of Jedda from an international point of view. The harbour is well sheltered but, owing to lines of coral reefs, steamers cannot approach the shore nearer than a mile and a ha . (See paragraph (ii), page 68, for details of landings.) (b) General type of houses and suitability for billetting. (i) Houses and billetting.—The houses are largely built of corrahne. Wood is used for floors, exterior decoration, and the construction ot projecting window bays to catch the breezes. The windows are not provided with glass, but there are wooden grids. There are numerous houses with three and some with four floors. Faulty building and unstable foundations lead to early sinking and collapse. 1 abulation of buildings suitable for billetting is therefore not of advantage. Billets for approximately 100 men could be found in good houses within the neighbourhood of the British Legation with hardly any movement of population, i.e., in houses temporarily emp y or m quarters belonging to European firms which could temporarily be Tnarip llPI rJ 1P In addition,' a force of approximately 300 men could be accom modated in suitable buildings for Europeans in the neighbourhood of the Legation, if inhabitants were removed. (ii) The general appearance of the town is ruinous. The walls (2 ft. thick, 18 ft. high, of mud) have recently been repaired (at the time of the war with the Yemen in 1933). There are four gates . The Water Gate (Quarantine and Customs). Mecca, Medina, and Sharif Gates—none of them militarily formidable.62 The only quarter of the town in tolerably good order and repair is the north-west quarter, where are situated the Bntish and other Legations and the foreign Consulates, with the exception of the Iranian. {See plan of Jedda.) (iii) The large Nigerian camp, made of petrol tins and palm branches, is situated on the south side of the town adjoining the Sharif Gate. Each tribe is represented by a Shaikh. The majority of the population are British subjects. The local appellation for all is Takharana (singular, Takhruni). The population of the camp is 10,000. (iv) Arab notables and officials avoid the town of Jedda owing to its evil climate, and few pure bred Arabs are seen in its streets. (c) Internal Communication. —Two main lanes, leading from the Customs Quay and from near the British Legation, meet a third leading to the Mecca Gate. Cars can negotiate them, but it is at present forbidden for cars to use the lane leading through the Mecca Gate. Cars make a detour outside the town walls to reach the Mecca road. This prohibition is apparently intended to avoid congestion at the time of the pilgrimage, when large numbers of camel-litters leave the town by the Mecca Gate, and not from any religious scruples. [d) External Communications. Road. (i) To Mecca, unmetalled car and camel tracks. (ii) To Medina, via Rabigh, unmetalled car and camel tracks. T elegraphic.

(b) Netherlands Trading Society (Dutch Bank), housed in ordinary large local house. Handles most banking business. (ix) Post and Telegraph Offices, Location (see Plan). Post Office is approximately 500 yards from British Legation, near Customs Quay. (x) Bakeries. Very limited, local bakeries often run short during pilgrimage. (xi) Abattoir. A small pier running out 50 yards into the sea, 1 mile south of town, is used as a slaughter place. (xii) Ice Plant. Small ice plant of German manufacture, unreliable and old. Cold storage, nil. Facilities for transporting, nil. (h) Transport Vehicles. Mechanical, number very variable. (See under Chapter VIII, page 101, for whole country, including Jedda.) (i) Electrical Power Supply. There is no public supply. There are 16 private sets as follows :— British Colony .. 4 Turkish Colony .. 1 1 2 1 Dutch Colony French Colony Italian Colony Egyptian Colony American Colony Mr. Philby The King’s (Jedda) Palace There is one 5 kilowatt set at British Legation. The average is 3£ kW. ; all on D.C.(j) Water Supply. (i) Sources of Supply. (a) Wazariya .—At Wazariya, 11 kilometres E.S.E. of Jedda, in the foothills beyond the coastal plain, is a water bearing area. The water is tapped by a system of old underground water-ways (Karaiz) which lead into two wells, named East Well and West Well, both 120 ft. deep. Thence by gravity, the water flows down an aqueduct [see paragraph (m) (i) below for further description of aqueduct) into Jedda. Above the East Well, there is a wind pump which boosts the water into the aqueduct, increasing its natural flow to 48 gallons per minute. The supply is constant throughout the year. Water is drunk by inhabitants, but is salty in taste and unfit for Europeans. (b) Condenser.—Sea water condenser. Mirrilees, Watson distiller (150 ton capacity). Full capacity, 250 tons per day. Owing to un hygienic methods of distribution, Europeans do not regularly use for drinking, but have done so with impunity on occasions. (ii) Method of Distribution. (a) Wazariya .—Collected by householders direct from aqueduct head in town. No charge. (b) Condenser.— Distributed by water-carriers, using donkeys or small carts carrying 4-gallon tins or small barre s. The water-carriers . circulate throughout the day, announcing themselves by crying “ Moya Codessa. Price, 2 piastres per petrol tin. (c) Wells, outside walls, used for watering animals, salty, and in cnmmpr often much fouled. (hi) Filtration. —Nil. (iv) Seasonal Shortage. Constant supply (trifling difference in flow from Wazariya at end of summer). (v) Drinking Water for Europeans. Nile water brought by steamers from Egypt. [k) Health and Sanitation. (i) Sanitation in Vogue. [a) Streets swept daily. (C23593) D(&amp;) Drainage .—Each house has central sump, into which sewage descends by ducts within the walls. When sump becomes full (about which there is no doubt) sweepers are hired to empty. Sewage is removed by cart or donkey and dumped in the lagoon which skirts the northern wall of the town. Sweepers are Somalis or Negroes (Arabs will not accept this work). (c) Public urinals or lavatories do not exist, but the public streets are much used by the poorer classes, adding to the insanitary conditions. (ii) Pasteur Institute. —Nil. (iii) Public Baths, Laundries, Disinfecting Stations. [а) Nil (other than the washing cisterns attached to mosques). (б) Laundries, nil. (c) Disinfecting stations, Jazirat Abu Sa’ad, and Jazirat al Wasta. (d) Emergency Disinfecting Quarantine Stations. Jazirat Abu Sa’ad .—An island, 150 yards in diameter, situated 3| miles S.S.W. of the towm. There are pilgrims’ quarters consisting of four, stone, flat roofed buildings, 30 yards long by 15 ft. wide, each in separate compounds surrounded by high wire netting fences, and a hospital consisting of three wards, 15 ft. wide, and totalling 40 ft. in length, with dispensary, drug store, medical officers’ room, etc., engine room (for condenser), and six tanks providing storage for 70 tons of water. Jazirat al Wasta .—An island If miles S.S.E. of Jazirat Abu Sa ad, 250 yards by 200 yards in extent. Eight pilgrims’ quarters, each 25 yards long by 15 ft. wide, and two enclosures for tents. Water storage : one tank, 5 ft. cube. Both islands are said to possess a slightly drier and healthier climate than Jedda. They are normally uninhabited, and have not been used for quarantine purposes for several years. On neither island is there any fresh water supply. (1) Supplies. {Note. Commodities are usually sold by the Hugga, 24 lb. {See Appendix I.)) {a) Meat. Mutton. Supplies ordinarily only barely sufficient for inhabitants, but numerous flocks, owned by natives of coastal plain, could be drawn upon, given one week’s notice, and assuming inhabitants to be friendly. In this case it is probable that about 1,000 lb. of mutton could be secured daily. Current price per pound is 9 Sa’udi piastres. Poultry.—Chickens are obtainable at 25 Sa’udi piastres each.* TP 67 Fish.—Supply could be increased to meet moderate demands. Price per fish, say 3 lb. weight—17 Sa udi piastres. Flour.—Very limited imported stocks. Local supply meagre and not to be relied upon. (b) Vegetables. —Limited supply, not always sufficient for inhabitants. Potatoes .. per lb.

(i) Wazariya Aqueduct.— - , i Q • Wazariya Aqueduct (a stone enclosed channel m. square and cement floored and lined) reaches the surface and continues to Jedda, only covered by a foot of earth, its line marked by cement pillars at intervals of a few hundred yards. M This water supply could therefore easily be cut along its last 6 kilometres. (ii) Condenser [see paragraphs (J) {i) ip) preceding). s situated on the water front (see plan). In)Sites suitable for Aerodromes. -Existing land^g g r0 ™ d ' 1 mile north of town, is best and only site close to Jedda ( s “ P'afJ and Dace 69) A number of alternative sites at distance from Jedda “uld b: selected and, with trifling labour, would be suitable for landing, especially along the Jedda-Medina road, where at mile 8 there is a suitable area. (o) Jedda considered as a possible base. General.—A natural harbour among coral reefs. (i) The anchorage, and channels between anchorages a the shore, are described in the Red Sea Pilot, 19 (Admiralty). The three lines of reefs and the intricate channels cannot be usefully described in summary, and the Pilot should be consulted. (C23593) d 268 (ii) Extent of anchorage and soundings, entrance width, navigation lights. Outer Anchorage. —Between 2nd and 3rd lines of reefs, in depths from 6 to 19 fathoms ; here ships are sheltered, but the bottom is foul ground and coral, and several anchors have been lost in this vicinity. Channel. —Passage is 180 yards wide. There are beacons and heading marks on either side. Inner Anchorage. —3 to 4 fathoms, but with numerous shoal patches and tongues of coral. Boat passage to shore. —The passage is between reefs so shallow that boats often ground when water level is low. It is marked by stone beacons. The usual landing is the Quarantine Pier. (iii) Quays and Jetties. —There is a water frontage of concrete quay 35 yards long between Customs Sheds and the Quarantine Jetty. Depth of water, 3 ft. Jetties—nil, unless a concrete projection at the Quarantine Quay, not more than 25 ft. by 18 ft., be so termed. Depth of water, 3 ft. Pylons below concrete are iron. (iv) Garage.—Nil. (v) Warehouses.—Details not available. (vi) Railway.—Nil. (vii) Fuel.—Nil, for bunkering. (viii) Shipping.—Lighters, tugs. The facilities for loading and unloading cargo are limited to about 300 dhows (sambuq), only half of which can be manned at a time. Each dhow can carry about 12 tons of cargo at normal water level, but, in summer, depths in the boat channel limit draught to 2f ft. (ix) Repairing.—Nil. Dhow makers’ yards are at the south end of water front. (x) Control. Arab controller appointed by Sa’udi Central Government. (xi) Development planned.—Nil. (xii) Sites for store depots, camps, etc. Camp site. —The most promising site in an area which has little to recommend it, is Ras Gahaz, i.e., north of Jedda, about 1 mile [see sketch of Jedda attached). Here the north breezes are caught, the ground is flat and open for 1,000 by 700 yards, and traces of an old pier indicate comparatively deep water.)R OFFICIAL USE ONLY accompany Field Notes on Sa'udi Arabia.H^ar Office. 1936 JEDDA FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY To accompany Field Notes on Sa'udi Arabia . &amp; Air Force Eve's Tomb To Landing Ground &amp; Govt.Pier / British Legation. 2 Chancery, British Legation 3 StatF Residence, British Legation. 4 /ZetherlandsLegation. 5 Jtaiian Legation 6 Ministry, Foreign AFFairs.Jedda OFFce. 7 Turkish Consa/ate S The Amir ofJedda 9 Ca/itornia-Arabian Standard OiiCQ 10 French Legation // Prison !2 Navy Bouse, Saudi Arabian Govt. /3 Egyptian Legation !4 Iraqi Legation IS Soviet Legation J6 Iranian Legation 17 Customs OFFice IS Passport Control Scale-very approximate,I inch-100yds. yds 100 SO 0 100 200yds.

Care should be taken to avoid camping on the slight depression coming in from the north, which is occasionally flooded, i.e., after a prolonged southerly wind. Defensive aspect of camp site .—There is a lagoon on the southern side, on the west is the sea, and on the north and east is a low line of mounds. Water. —There is no water on the site, but there are wells at Ruhiz, 1 mile east, which, under supervision, could be adopted for washing water. (vii) Mecca. — {a) Position. —Headquarters of the Viceroy of the Hejaz, Mecca lies 45 miles inland from Jedda, on the Red Sea, that is beyond the coastal plain, the Tihama, and well into the hills and tortuous valleys of the Hejaz proper, the “ barrier ” country between the plain and the central Arabian plateau. Situated in the bottom of one of these valleys, it is well known for its airlessness and heat. (b) Importance. —Mecca is of supreme importance to some three hundred millions of people, the Muslims of the world, being the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad and the site of ' God’s House ” pilgrimage, the which is enjoined upon every Muslim able to do so, in the Third Chapter, verse 96, of the Koran {see Chapter III, page 41, for description of pilgrimage). For this reason its sacredness is recognised and preserved, and Meccan politics observed, by all the Powers having Moslem subjects. To vSa’udi Arabia, Mecca is of first importance in providing, through the pilgrims, the greater part of the State income. It is now the seat of the Viceroy of the Hejaz and the centre of the provincial Government. By reason of its sacredness, the City is forbidden, on pain of death, to any but Moslems. Christian Europeans who have entered it or even approached it are in consequence limited to about a dozen. (c) Population .—The total population of Mecca is about 70,000, but may, for periods, fall lower. At the time of the Great Pilgrimage there is an influx of anything between thirty and one hundred and thirty thousand, usually rather nearer the latter than the former, which is the figure for a year of crisis or insecurity. The population is extremely mixed in blood, and apart from the non-existence of a census, would be difficult to estimate by races as many persons spend some years in the city only to leave it again for their own land.An estimate of the population by races, in 1935, is as follows per r s e ons ra of S mixed or non-Arab blood, but of families 15.000 person in Mecca and no w Saudi Arab subjects. 10.000 Indians. 4.100 Javanese. 3.100 Negroes. 1,800 Somalis. 2,000 North Africans. |,C clfnele,'.Japanese, Russians, and others. The inhabitants are exclusively Muhammedans. Pllg In m the minority are the Government servants and soldiers of the garrison. (if “ Servants ” of the ' Haram ' of Mecca.—kn important class in the first category mentioned above are the servants of the great M ° The Naibd Haram, or deputy for the js ap^inted by the King (the Governor of Mecca is nominally Chief or Shaikh n^The keeper, 6 or openerTof God’s House, a position always filled bY ^NalbafH^apprints three or four lieutenants under whom come some hundreds of preachers, teachers and sweepem Jamp cleaners doorkeepers and water drawers, fifty mueddhi . callers t^ prayer, and fifty eunuchs called Aghas or Tawashis, slaves of God who act as police and caretakers within the Haram. The latter are all African negroes whose chief takes precedence after the keeper of the Haram. . . • r The singular nature of their duties and the ancient ongin of their corps well provided for by numerous religious bequests and y CahphTbu P Ja’afar al Mansur in 150 A.H., gives them a position of importance. Many are men of considerable private property. (e) Public Order and Relations .—In Hashimite times, tha t is before 1924, Mecca, perhaps partly due to its very mixed population and partly to Hashimite misgovernment, bore a ^°V S a r ^ rice tion The Meccans’ immorality was only exceeded by their avarice, which latter the pilgrims had cause to know. , ,, w The Sa’udi Arabian Government has much improved the the pilgrims and less is heard of Meccan vice.r'' L FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY To accompany Field Notes on Sa'udi Arabia srs.

Ltd., from “The Holy Cities of Arabia'by Eldon Rutter .(/) Types of Buildings. —The houses are all stone built, many of them three and four storeys high, with terraced roofs and large projecting windows, and are solidly constructed. The streets are fairly wide and clean. The city is unwalled. (g) Communications. —(i) Internal. —The main street, A1 Mas’aah, runs from south-east to north-west, its alignment broken by the wall of the Haram or Great Mosque, containing the Ka’aba. (ii) External. —W/T station, 6 kilowatt. Telephone—overhead line, old German installation to Jed da and Taif. Roads for mechanical transport to Jedda (for Medina) and Riyadh (for Taif also). Car postal service daily to and from Jedda. For other services to Riyadh, Medina, etc., see Chapter VII, page 98. (li) Water Supply. —From springs at Jabal Arafa by conduit to Mecca, when it runs underground through the city, tapped by wells. The only other source is the well Zemzem, in the court of the Mosque, used for religious purposes. The city is liable to be flooded by spates, when water for a short period remains plentiful. These may occur at any time, but are rare in June, July and August. They usually follow the thunderstorms prevalent in the surrounding mountains. (viii) Medina. —District headquarters. Height above sea level, 2,300 ft. Population, 30,000. Holy City forbidden to Christians, a place of pilgrimage, contains tomb of Prophet Muhammad, walled. Terminus of the former Hejaz railway. Port for Medina is at Yenbu’, 100 miles west of it. Lives on pilgrims and cultivation of dates. Water from Kuba, 2 miles to the south, by conduits. W/T. (ix) Riyadh. —Capital city of Sa’udi Arabia, seat of the Monarch for about seven months in every year, and headquarters of the Aridh province. Garrison town. (a) General Importance. —Riyadh owes its importance to plentiful water in the Wadi Hanifa and to its position at the crossing of the routes from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea with those running north and south between the northern oases of Qasim and oases of southern Aridh and those of Ranya and Bisha. It has been the capital of the Al Saud since the destruction of their former capital 12 miles west of Riyadh, Dar’aya (Deraya or Dar’iya), by the Egyptians in 1818. (p) Type of Buildings. —The houses are made of pise de terre and palm and tamarisk w r ood. Use is also increasingly made of limestone blocks, with or without mortar. I he houses have no outside windows, are separated into guest rooms and “ haram (women s quarters) in the traditional Moslem form. Interiors of the better class houses are decorated by patterns in lime. D 4 (C23593)72 (c) Communications. —A telephone system connects the King’s Palace at Badiya, 9 kilometres south-west of the city, with that in the city and the principal offices and private houses of officials of the Court and certain members of the Royal family. A wireless station and a mobile W/T set, which accompanies the King on his journeys, are in use {see Chapter VII). A car mail service connects Riyadh with Mecca, its journeys being approximately fortnightly, leaving Mecca every other Saturday, the same two vehicles returning. The main thoroughfare through the city runs from the north-western (Shamsiya) gate, past the Royal Palace, to the north-eastern (Dhumairi) gate. To the Shamsiya Gate comes traffic from Jedda, Mecca, and the Oasim oases. To the Dhumairi Gate comes traffic from Hasa and Kuwait. {d) Population. —About 9,000, much increased by an influx of Bedouins at certain times, for the autumn trading and for the annual marshalling of the chiefs of tribes with their retinues before the King, usually in the summer about the beginning of July. The population is exclusively Moslem and, apart from a few officials, doctors, chauffeurs, servants, and mechanics, exclusively Arab. The above exceptions are Indian, Somali, Sudanese, and Javanese, and number about 200. This excludes slaves of African origin. The livelihood of the population apart from officials and merchants is from the cultivation of the date palms, which are irrigated by means of water wheels drawing from wells. Wahhabism is the religious code. There has been recently some relaxation of the severity practised in the early 19th century and again in the third decade of the 20th century. Cigarettes and tobacco may now be bought, at a price, in Riyadh. Radios, ostensibly for the news broadcast only, are permitted. {e) Mechanical Transport. —A variable number of vehicles, the majority of which are 2-ton Ford lorries (8-cylinder) and touring cars, of which American makes predominate, are maintained for Government uses. [See Chapter VIII for survey of mechanical transport in whole country.) A workshop is maintained by the Government which can under take all simple repairs. (/) Electric Power. —There is an electric power plant in the Royal Palace. The current is poor and the number of points limited. (g) Supplies. Sheep, butter, dates, grapes, and various stone fruits as well. Meat (mutton or camel) sufficient for local needs. [h) Animal Transport. —1,000 baggage camels are available. Riding camels in large numbers could be obtained.ONLY War Office, 1936' essrs. Putnern £ Co.

A summer residence for inhabitants of Mecca and the Vice-regal Hejaz Government. Plentiful and clear water supply and numerous gardens, chiefly fruit trees and vines. Fruits grown mostly are apricots, pomegranates and olives. Palms do not thrive. Roses are much grown for pressing into otto at Mecca, whence it is distributed to the Moslem world. Vegetables are exported to Mecca. Tropical rains fall heavily in the early autumn. W/T and telephone. (xi) Taima .—A walled village of some 200 houses, in an oasis. Population, approximately 1,500. Height, 3,400 ft. above sea level. Qasr Zallum, a fort in the centre of the village has walls of dry masonry 5 ft. thick, 15 ft. high, and 60 yards long, and contains two guns and six machine guns (makes unknown). The oasis is controlled by Ibn Rumman, hereditary ruler, who also commands some 40 armed Bedouins, the garrison of the fort. A further 300-350 Bedouins could be called upon to defend the town. A magazine, on the first floor of the fort, contains a large quantity of ammunition and a considerable number of German and French rifles. A well, inside the walls, is used by the inhabitants of the town and another, 2 miles to the north, is used only by tribes loyal to Ibn Rumman. Water is brackish in each case. Some tobacco is grown as well as fruit ; plums, dates, pomegranates, figs, citrons, and grapes, corn and dates, are exported to the Bedouins. The gates of the town are open from dawn to sunset. On the whole unusually prosperous, Taima remains autonomous, and the officials of Sa’udi Arabia do not enter it. 6 . Ports suitable for Bases {a) Red Sea Coast (i) Jedda. — [See Chapter IV above.) (ii) Rabigh .—From an air point of view, Rabigh is reported to be suitable. See the following extract from a reconnaissance report on Rabigh, by Major E. J. Bannatyne, R.F.C., dated 5th September, 1916 :— ' There is a suitable site for a landing ground on the beach at Rabigh, though it is said to become soft in winter. A further site which could be used at any time was selected on rising ground about a mile from the shore, and the R.E. officer states that a causeway of coral could be made across the soft aerodrome to enable motor transport to reach the higher level. “ Conditions at Ras A1 Abyad are similar to those at Rabigh : a natural aerodrome on the peninsula which is liable to become soft in winter, and one at higher level, usable in all weathers.'*74 From a sea point of view it also has certain advantages over other Red Sea anchorages (see Red Sea Pilot-Admiralty). Lying as it does between Jedda and Yenbu, it has the advantage of being a possible port for either Medina or Mecca. (iii) Yenbu ’.—The outstanding facility of Venbu' is the near approach possible to the shore, the vessels of the Khedmal Mail Line habitually coming to an anchor within two hundred yards of the shore {see Red Sea Pilot). (iv) Minor anchorages, the shore conditions of which are little known {see Admiralty Red Sea Pilot), are . Wejh. Umm Lajj. Jizan. Lith. Qunfidha. {b) Persian Gulf Coast (i) Uqair, port for Hasa, and having 3 fathoms of water alongside its stone-built quay (see Persian Gulf Pilot, Routes in Arabia Simla), and Route Report-, 1935, by Captain de Gamy (Air Ministry) ). (ii) Qatif-—{See Admiralty Persian Gulf Pilot.) (iii) Jubail.—{See Admiralty Persian Gulf Pilot.) (iv) Ras Tanoura.—{See Admiralty Persian Gulf Pilot.) Of these three, little is known of shore conditions. 7. Medical Services of Sa’udi Arabia {a) Allotment of Official Doctors Jedda .. .. Quarantine Hospital ..

A dispensary is maintained in Mecca during the pilgrimage season in spite of obstacles put in the way by the Director- General of Health. Soviet .—Dispensarv closed and doctor returned to Soviet^ 1935. Italy. —One Levantine doctor. Egyptian. —Established at Mecca during pilgrimage only. One doctor attached to Egyptian Consulate permanently ; no dispensary, instruments or medicines. Afghan .—One doctor during pilgrimage.76 It should here be added that the conditions under which the medicines of these foreign medical missions may be imported are no longer easy. Custom duties are sought by the Sa udi Arab Govern ment, who seek to maintain that their own arrangements are adequate. (/) Sanitation Sanitation in the towns of Saudi Arabia is almost if not entirely non-existent, Jedda, particularly, being an example of a town with the most primitive sanitary arrangements with innumerable garbage and excreta heaps where flies thrive. Even the bui dings of the Royal family in Riyadh are without adequate or clean closets. Sometimes, in a wave of enthusiasm, quantities of carbolic are sprinkled about the streets.CHAPTER V PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 1. General Arabia consists of a tableland which generally slopes from over 5,000 ft. in the west to 500 ft. in the east. Some of the Western Peaks reach 10,000 ft. The fall towards the Persian Gulf is long and gentle ; that towards the Red Sea is short and steep. More than one-half of the peninsula is over 2,000 ft. above sea level. From west to east generally, the successive types of country are:—- (i) Coral rock coast line. (ii) A coastal plain, with sandy patches sometimes soft and salty (Sabkha), known as the “ Tihama.” (hi) Precipitous barren hills, rising in places to 10,000 ft., known as the “ Hejaz ” (or barrier). (iv) Basaltic rock areas, known as “ Harra,” a litter of black volcanic rocks, on the (v) Highland, where are often groves of trees and well-wooded depressions, the end of the granite of the west and beginning of the limestone of the centre and east. (vi) Middle Highlands, a “desert,” but not sandy and having areas thickly covered in bushes and small trees, traversed by narrow strips, or sometimes supplanted by (vii) Sand. In the first case, strips, known as “Arq” (s.) “Arouq ” (pi.), the sand areas in general being known as Nafud. (viii) Central mountain range with oases in its valleys. Hard eastern deserts traversed by sand strips or sometimes supplanted by sand areas. (ix) Low sandy coastline. 2. Wadis There are no perennial rivers flowing from source to mouth in Sa’udi Arabia. There are four great “ Wadis.” The Rummah whose course is from near Medina through Qasim to the Shatt-al-Arab.78 The Wadi Hanifa, which runs from the westward flank of Jabal Tuwaiq through a gap in the hills towards the east. The Wadi Dawasir, which runs from the eastern flank of the Asir mountains through a gap in the southern end of Jabal Tuwaiq. The Wadi Hamdh, which runs from above Medina, past it to thp sea, south of Wejh. ’ Ihese Wadis, while dry except immediately after heavy rain, are important because they contain water which can be reached by wells beneath their beds. In the north, the great Wadi Sirhan depression similarly contains water beneath its bed. All these, in parts at least, are shallow and a European traveller could in places cross them without noticing them. The Wadis on the Red Sea coast have shorter courses and are deeply eroded, forming an obstacle to easy communications from north to south. 3. Sands The great sands of Sa udi Arabia are two ; the northern area between Jauf and Hail and the vast southern area between the Yemen and Oman running up to near Qatar on its eastern side. The former is known as An Nafud and the latter as Ar Rimmal (the Sands) or Ar Rub al Khali (the empty quarter). These two areas are joined by belts of sands running on either side of the central mountain chain, the Jabal Tuwaiq. These long connecting arms between the two sand areas run in strips, known as Arouq (or veins'). Between the strips, the desert steppe appears again. rr Thus there is a ring of sand round the heart of Sa’udi Arabia. 4. Oases W it bin, there lies a discontinuous fertile area, making a gentle crescent of oases through the middle of the country. These oases, due to the water being available from the central mountain chains, are grouped from north to south as follows Jabal Shammar. Qasim. Nejd. Wadi Dawasir (and Ranya). o 'eas has many settlements, and forms a chain of one anith dl 'nru al lnkS ° f Whlch ^ se P arated . but never far from the wTv'i, 0t Y ; ra P ortant groups are Hofuf and Jabrin, and Son: InltT' th6 f ° rmer due t0 sul P hurous sP™gs welling up inWar Office, 1936.

Mountains Q nan h l WeSt ![ n edge ° f the Arabian P^teau, rising in places to over 8,000 ft., is the mam mountainous area of Sa’udi Arabia. In the north, near the Gulf of Akaba, close to the Red Sea it is 10 000 ft high. Before reaching Wejh, the mountains have become receded to let through the Wadi Hamdh. lower, and Remarshalling again, they run on at an interval well maintained of about 30 miles from the sea. Nearer Mecca, minor ranges become apparent, and the main range becomes higher (Jabal Jura, 8,000ft.). The formation continues, with increasingly confused minor ranges to the south, becoming the southern Red Sea province of Asir. This formation, in its entirety, properly speaking, is the “ Heiaz ” (or barrier). J The second mountain formation is that through the heart of the country, a break in the central plateau, consisting of the Jabal Shammar and the Jabal Tuwaiq, the watershed of which provides the water for the chain of central oases. 6. The Coastline [a) Red Sea Coast The Red Sea coast of Arabia has from the earliest times been infamous to sailors {see, for example, the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea by a merchant of the First Century a.d.). It remains to-day, to modern ships, as difficult and dangerous. Coral reefs form tortuous and shallow channels through which it is always difficult, and in some places impossible, for anything but a native canoe (houri) to approach the shore. For the whole length of the Red Sea coast the hills of the Hejaz form a background and place of concealment close to the coast line, sometimes, as in the north, actually upon it, from which the inhabitants may sally out to harass a landing party and retire into the shadows of its deep valleys. Even aircraft might find difficulty in detecting and dealing with the small parties, fighting in guerilla fashion, which a landing party in certain circumstances might encounter. Water near the coast is fairly widely distributed, but generally scanty and brackish near the shore. . For the greater part of its length, the actual shore is a low coral cliff averaging 10 ft. high, behind which lies a “ Sabkha ” (soft salty pans) dotted sandy plain, backed by the barren hills of the Hejaz, rising in successive ridges through which easy passes are few and dominated, and the tortuous valleys of which form innumerable natural ambush sites.80 Communications laterally are almost non-existent, although cars have, by being man-handled, reached most of the coastal villages. The first well-used lateral communication (animal transport) is the “ Pilgrim Route ” from Egypt which follows approximately the line of the railway (inoperative 1936) as far south as Medina, thence via Rabigh to Jedda. There are only three steamer-used ports: Jedda, Wejh, and \ enbu . (b) Persian Gulf Coastline The Persian Gulf shore of Sa’udi Arabia is low and sandy, spits of which run out, sometimes in strange shape, far into the shallow sea. The many shallow lagoons, formed by such headlands and peninsulas twisting out, make the coastline irregular, hard to search by sea, and difficult for any but a native seaman to navigate. Great areas of the coastline are unapproachable by anything but the shallowest native craft. The shore is generally very sandy, but is backed at some distance by the harder Summan desert, which in most places is only reached after crossing a belt of sand dune, averaging some 10 miles broad, and beginning close to the shore, itself sandyish. There is only one port regularly used by dhows, Uqair , steameis do not call there. 7. Terrain in relation to Flying (a) General (i) As has been explained above, Arabia consists of a table-land which slopes from over 5,000 ft. in the west to 500 ft. in the east. The fall towards the Persian Gulf is long and gentle; the drop to the Red Sea is short and steep. More than one-half of the Peninsula is over 2,000 ft. above sea level. (ii) With the exception of the oases in the coastal plain and in the interior, Arabia consists of sand and volcanic rock areas, steppe and mountains, entirely barren in the ordinary European sense of the word. By far the most suitable area for air operations is the northern desert abutting on ’Iraq, already familiar to pilots of the Royal Air Force. As a general rule for Northern Arabia, geographical conditions are best from the flying point of view in the east, and deteriorate towards the west. There are three main varieties of sandy areas. Their surlace' characteristics are— (b) Dahana A hard gravelly plain traversed at intervals by sand ridges. Good landing grounds for aircraft can sometimes be found on the hard tracts.81 (c) Nafud A continuous area of deep sand, driven into high billows by the wind. Suitable places for landing grounds will be rarely found owing to the softness and unevenness of the surface. The succulent Nussi grass in this area makes it attractive to the nomad grazers, who would be difficult of approach by land forces owing to the soft terrain. (d) Ahqaf Very soft, sandy country with steep billows at narrow trough- intervals. 1 his is a soft variety of Nafud. It is very bad going owing to the softness of the surface ; it would be impossible to find landing grounds in this type of country. {e) Volcanic Rock Areas (Harra) Rough country with a broken and boulder-strewn surface of corrugated and fissured lavas or scoriae. The surface is much broken up and these areas are sometimes characterised by numerous flat-topped hills with almost vertical sides. In true harra country, landing is impossible. (/) Steppe The steppe areas are tracts of hard, gravelly or dusty, undulating plain with stunted shrub and thorn in hollows. Viewed from the air the steppe varies in colour from light brown to dark purplish black. For forced landings, the flat gravel is safer than shrub-studded ground, and usually the darker the colour the better the surface, but care should be taken in the air not to mistake dark basalt boulders for the black of a flint-strewn area. Landing grounds may be found more often in this country than in the other types of Arabian country. (g) Oases (i) Central Oases .—In the string of oases {see page 78) roughly forming a crescent from round Jabal Shammar in the north, through Qasim and Wadi Hanifa and down to the Wadi Dawasir and Nejran in the south, suitable landing grounds will sometimes be difficult to find, since these oases exist in or near the wadis bringing down water from the Jabal Shammar, the Jabal Tuwaiq and the Asir highlands. They are necessarily situated in rough country, generally at the mouth of ravines. (ii) Outer Oases .—The other fertile tracts of the Peninsula are on sea coasts or near thereto, particularly in Hasa on the east and Asir on the west, and possible landing grounds are more likely to be found than in the central oases chain. *82 (iii) Mountain Regions .—The western edge of the central plateau ends in a series of barren and jagged ranges, and are areas in which it is impossible to find landing grounds. The suitability for landing of the various surfaces described does not vary greatly throughout the year. Rains, when they occur, often cause floods and wash-outs, in valleys and wadis, but the hardness of the surface, except in the wadis and mud flats, is not greatly affected by rain, and it may be taken that landing grounds will generally be serviceable all the year round. 8. Hejaz The word “ Hejaz ” means “ Barrier, ,, and is, properly speaking, the ragged and precipitous mountain country at the upraised western edge of the Arabian shelf, d his short and steep fall westward to the Red Sea, however, is interrupted by a second ridge, which lies a short way back from the shore, and in the northern part (Midian) attains a greater elevation (peaks over 10,000 ft.) than the main ridge itself. The Hejaz considered as a country, and not confining the use of the word to its topographical meaning, comprises :— (1) A low, sandy coastal strip (Tihama) fringed with coral reefs and narrowest in Midian. (2) A mountainous belt, decreasing in elevation, from 10,000 ft. in the north to about 2,000 ft. high between Jedda and Mecca. (3) The main ridge itself having a mean elevation of over 4,000 ft. behind Mecca. (4) The western edge of the central Arabian plateau. A few big drainage channels, originating on the main ridge, traverse the third zone, and break through the second to the sea, all being without permanent surface flow. In the north (Midian), where the elevation is great and there is some precipitation from the East Mediterranean area, these deep wadis follow one another in rapid succession. They cut up the country into a series of detached blocks, and force even animal transport from north to south to keep either close along the shore (Egyptian pilgrim route) or well inland (Syrian pilgrim route and Hejaz railway). Owing to their exceed ingly steep gradients, they do not favour communication from west to east, or create fertility. The principal superficial characteristic of the Hejaz is its general barrenness, relieved only in the first and third zones by rare oases. The littoral zone, except at wadi-mouths, is rock and dusty sand ; the hills of the second zone are of dusty surface where not naked lime stone ; the third zone is steppe verging on “ nafud ” desert ; the fourth is rocky in the northern part and frequently ‘ ‘ harra ’ ’ desert ; the fifth is stony steppe, softening in the north to ' nafud.”9. Nejd Physically Nejd falls into three parts— (i) A northern steppe and nafud ” area. (ii) A central oasis region dependent on a chalky, broken-up plateau, which trends from north to south and its escarp ment facing west and having long slopes falling eastward. The mean elevation of the plateau ridge is 500 ft. above the general level of the plains to the west of it. Areas of steppe and Dahana in the east, and steppe, Nafud and Harra, west. (iii) A southern region, dependent, in the main, on the same western ridge of the Tuwaiq plateau after its deflection to south-westward. The whole region is only intermittently fertile, and all its settle ments have an oasis character ; but, internally, it contains no formidable desert, though much steppe. “Ahqaf ” and “ harra ” do not occur in it at all.CHAPTER VI CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY 1. Effect of Climate on Facility of Movement (a) The heat at midday in the summer is often so great as to cause all human beings and animals to seek shelter, even if it be only under desert bushes. When, in addition, the “ Simum ” hot wind is blowing, movement may be considered impracticable. The parching nature of the wind causes men and animals to be constantly thirsty while it lasts, which is usually from mid-morning to early afternoon. (The Arabic word used for siesta or midday halt is “ Gail.”) (b) From October to May, sudden rain storms may cause spates to descend valley beds that are ordinarily dry. In the narrow valleys of the Hejaz, such sudden spates not infrequently cause loss of life. Mecca itself is, once in every few years, subject to flooded streets from this cause. These flood streams usually do not run for more than 24 hours after rain, and are only impassable for the first two or three hours. 2. Meteorological The following paragraphs cover the meteorology of the whole area of Arabia bounded by the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. Sa’udi Arabia forms by far the greater portion of this peninsula, and the characteristics of its climate differ little from the States which border it on the west, the south, and south-east. (a) Seasons The climate of Arabia is of an arid type, the rainfall being scanty and irregular in distribution. Broadly speaking, the year may be divided into two seasons—summer and winter—separated by transition periods. The actual lengths of the seasons vary according to locality. South of latitude 20° N. the summer period coincides with the south west monsoon, which lasts from May to September, and the winter period with the north-east monsoon, which lasts from October to April. The transition period in September-October is more abrupt than the spring period in April-May. North of latitude 20° N. along the Red Sea coast, the transition periods tend to extend somewhat. Along the border of the Persian Gulf, the winter season occurs from December to February and the summer season fiom June to August. September-November and March-May are transition periods.During the summer, the heat is everywhere oppressive except in certain mountainous regions on the borders of Nejd and of Yemen In the interior, very high day temperatures are experienced, but there is a larger diurnal range of temperature than exists in the coastal districts, the nights being relatively cool. In fact, after the intense heat of the day, the fall in temperature appears to be sudden and the nights often feel colder than they actually are. In winter temperatures are moderate in the coastal belts although, on the southern coast, especially in the Gulf of Aden, relatively high temperatures are experienced even at this season. On the exposed steppes of the interior of the Hejaz and of Hadhramaut, cold nights are experienced in the winter months, the temperature falling below zero in the more northern districts. In the Tihama plain, prior to the change of wind from S.S.E. to N.N.W. in May {see (e) (i) below), the weather is very hot and oppressive. The change of wind to N.N.W. produces welcome relief. Winter is the season of western depressions, which is the name given to disturbances, similar in character to the depressions of temperate latitudes, which travel at irregular intervals from west to east across Arabia. The wind circulates counter-clockwise round the disturbance, so that southerly winds are experinced in advance of an oncoming depression and northerly winds in its rear. These depres sions, which attain their most southerly course in February, are responsible for most of the scanty rainfall of Arabia, but owing to their irregularity and the fact that the bulk of the moisture is deposited on the i ihama and on the mountain slopes along the western border, the rainfall is extremely irregular, and in certain districts, particularly the Nafud, in the north, and the Rub’ al Khali desei t of Southern Arabia, it is not uncommon for periods of complete drought to extend over three or more years. On the other hand, in certain parts of the Hejaz, there are occasionally exceptionally rainy years. • T 11 , 6 re gi° n °f Arabia which experiences a regular seasonal rainfall is the coastal chain of Hadhramaut and Dhufar Province, w ich comes under the influence of the south-west monsoon. Regular rains fall during the summer months along these mountain slopes. In parts of the northern desert, showers or light rains occur at the change of seasons in April and May, and less frequently, and usually further south, in August and September. Cloud amounts are small in all parts of Arabia. The cloudiest months are December, January, and February, while on the south coas lere is a secondary maximum during the south-west monsoon m J UI ^ e &gt; J u Y&gt; an d August. During these months, the southern coastal chain is sometimes enveloped in cloud.The high peaks of the Hejaz and Yemen are similarly cloud covered occasionally during the winter months, while in the northern section there is a slight increase in cloudiness in April and May. On the border of the Persian Gulf, January is the cloudiest month, 25 per cent, of days being overcast. The summer months in this area are almost entirely cloudless. (b) Temperature Data covering a period of years, occur only in the case of certain coastal stations. The following tables gives the mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures and the highest and lowest temperatures recorded at Jedda, Aden, Bahrein, and Muscat. Temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit. January. April. July. October. Mean Daily Extreme Mean Daily Extreme Mean Daily Extreme Mean Daily Extreme Max. Min. Max.' Min. Max. Min. Max. Min. Max. Min.

For example, temperatures along the Red Sea coast tend to increase slightly from north to south. The highest temperature recorded is 115° F. at Jedda in June. No temperature data covering a period of years exist for the interior, but from scattered observations it is clear that in the desert plains, high day temperatures are experienced in June, July, and August, the shade temperature reaching at least 110° F. While in the coastal plain the nights are often oppressive with little difference from the day temperatures, parts of the interior are subject to a large diurnal variation, the nights being relatively cool. On the high ground of Hadhramaut and Dhufar Province, low temperatures are experienced at night in winter, the thermometer falling to 40° F. or lower. In the north-west, the high land is very cold at this season, temperatures often falling at night to below freezing point. Even in the early summer, the nights are still fresh and a cool breeze tempers the heat of the day. In winter, during the passage of western depressions, the tem perature is likely to change suddenly, a hot, close spell being succeeded by a cold burst of northerly winds. Such changes are sometimes experienced as far south as latitude 20° N. in the Rub’ al Khali. No data are available regarding the vertical change of temperature, but it is clear that over the whole of Arabia a very rapid decrease with height must take place during the day in the first few thousand feet, while at night, over the desert plains, an inversion would be88 experienced at no great height. In south-east Arabia, during the monsoon months, there is some evidence of a sharp temperature inversion at a relatively low altitude. (c) Phenomena (i) Sand Storms .—The majority of sand storms are due to the raising of sand by wind, and occur without any previous indication. They are experienced most frequently during the hot months, and usually commence about 0900 hours when, as a result of convection, a strong wind is experienced at ground level. They may continue until convection ceases towards sunset, but, in the southern desert, they have been known to commence in the afternoon and continue into the evening. The strong wind frequently lifts the sand to 6,000 or even 10,000 ft., the air is very bumpy and the storm is frequently accompanied by a squall. Severe sandstorms may occur during the passage of a depression in winter or early spring. In such cases, they are accompanied by a severe squall and frequently by thunder and lightning. Very bad bumps are experienced during the storm. Before the storm occurs, the sky is cloudy and the atmosphere oppressive with the wind blowing from a southerly point. During the passage of the storm, the wind veers towards north, there is a sharp drop of temperature, and the air afterwards clears. Sandstorms are not confined to the interior of Arabia, but drift over the coastal regions. They occur over the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, Oman, and the Persian Gulf. (ii) Sand Devils .—These disturbances are localised and do not usually extend over a few hundred feet although on occasions they have been observed to extend to 5,000 ft. They occur in light winds during the hot weather. Their effects are only local, and they can be easily seen and avoided by aircraft. (iii) Thunderstorms .—Thunderstorms occur most frequently during the winter season and are associated mainly, in the interior, with the passage of the western depressions, to which reference has already been made. Not infrequently they are accompanied by squalls with an abrupt charge of wind and also by sandstorms. Thunderstorms of this type are experienced occasionally as far south as the Rub’ al Khali and in the hilly district west of Muscat. In the Tihama, the low lying plain between the mountains of the Hejaz and the Red Sea, severe thunderstorms are sometimes experienced in August and September, giving torrential rains which flood the valley of Mecca, and flow down the hollow valleys forming temporary rivers. Whole encampments with their flocks and herds have been known to have been swept away in these torrents. The area affected is one of light winds between the northerly current of the northern Red Sea and the southerly current of the southern part. This belt, like the Doldrums, shifts north and south, and the severe thunderstorms of the area are caused by incursions of the cold air of the one current into the warmer air of the second wind current.89 In northern districts, thunderstorms are sometimes experienced in April at the change of seasons. The same applies to the southern area although, at Aden and along the southern coast, thunderstorms are also experienced during the summer monsoon months. (iv) Waterspouts .—Waterspouts occur not infrequently over the Red Sea in association with the thunderstorms of the belt of variable winds. Often several may be seen at one time or in succession. When they cross the coast from sea to land, they may be observed to change into sand devils and vice versa. Waterspouts also occur in the Gulf of Aden. (v) Gales .—Along the Red Sea coast, gales occur most frequently during the north-east monsoon from November to February, and blow from the north-west or north along the northern coast and from south-east or south along the southern coast. In the extreme north, the northerly gales are most frequent in the summer months. The frequency of gales in the periods stated rarely exceeds one per year in each month although they occur rather more frequently along the southern half of the Red Sea coast. Along the southern coast, gales are frequent during the south west monsoon, especially in July and August. During this period, rough seas are experienced, and even in the quietest weather a ground swell runs along the shelving beaches of this coast. Along the Persian Gulf coast, gales are most frequent in June and July, an average of 12 being experienced in June and 13 in July at Bahrain. These gales occur most frequently with northerly or north-westerly winds. In Oman and on the south-east coast, gales are less frequent and occur usually in December and January, being associated with the passage of depressions. Rough seas are experienced on these occasions in the Gulf of Oman. In the interior, gales are most prevalent in the winter months during the bursts of cold northerly winds behind the western depressions. (vi) Arabian Sea Cyclones .—The destructive cyclones of the Arabian Sea rarely affect Arabia, but they have been known to penetrate the Oman and Aden regions. Only three have been known to enter the Gulf of Aden in the last fifty years, but a frequency of 8 has been recorded in the same period near the coasts of Oman. The storms give winds of hurricane force and are of destructive violence. {d) Atmospheric Disturbances—Bumpiness The main atmospheric disturbances which give rise to severe bumpiness may be divided into three categories according to the causes operative : (i) the strong surface heating of the desert plains in the day, particularly in summer, giving rise to convection currents ; (ii) the broken character of the high country along the western and southern seaboards ; (iii) in association with squalls and thunderstorms.90 The bumpiness, due to the strong surface heating of the desert plains by day, is usually pronounced, especially in the hot season, and makes flying unpleasant after about 0900 hours. I he black volcanic rock surface of the eastern Hejaz towards Nejd, would be subject to exceptional heating, and would give rise to severe bumpiness during the day. The wind, blowing over the mountains and along the valleys of the broken hilly country of the Hejaz and along the southern mountain chain, gives rise to dangerous air currents, especially during the day, when winds are normally strongest. Bumpiness is also frequent in the Oman region, where the prevailing westerly and easterly winds blow at right angles to the line of hills running north and south. The bumpiness in both the cases mentioned can be avoided to some extent by flying high. The convection over the desert plains frequently extends, however, to a height of 12,000 ft., while over the mountains the upward and downward currents extend frequently to several times the height of the obstruction. Flying low over broken mountainous country on days of strong winds is very dangerous. Strong vertical currents are experienced in the neighbourhood of thunderstorms and, unlike the two previous cases cited, cannot be avoided by flying high. Strong upward currents usually occur in front of the storm, downward currents occurring behind it. Apart from thunderstorms associated with the passage of depressions, flying over the sea is less bumpy than over land. In fact, unless a strong gusty wind is blowing, smooth flying is almost invariably experienced. (e) Winds (i) Surface Winds .—North of a line extending across Arabia from south of Mecca to south of Bahrain, winds from between north and north-west prevail throughout the year. The north-westerly wind current is most pronounced along the coasts of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and is less determinate in the interior, especially in winter. During this season, the passage of western depressions causes an occasional interruption of the northerly wind current on both coasts by winds from a southerly direction, and these alterations of southerly and northerly winds are the most characteristic feature of the circulation in the interior, although westerly winds also occur when the depression passes to the north of a particular area and easterly winds if the depression passes to the south. Westerly winds are relatively more frequent in winter in the southern half of the interior and easterly winds in the northern sector. Along the shores of the Persian Gulf, unless a depression is passing, winds are calm or light in the early morning and late evening. Along the southern half of the Red Sea coast the prevailing wind direction is SSE. in winter with occasional interruptions from a northerly direction. In the intermediate section about latitude91 n u 20° N., calms and light airs prevail. This area oscillates in position in winter, moving gradually southwards in May and causing a transition from SSE. to NNW. winds as it passes. Along the south coast of Arabia from south of Oman to Aden, north-east winds predominate in the winter months, becoming easterly in south-east Arabia. From June to August, the north to north-west winds extend southwards throughout the entire length of the Red Sea coast. During these months winds • from the same direction become definitely established along the shores of the Persian Gulf to the west of Oman, the winds being stronger than in any other month. A general light north-westerly current occurs during this period of the year over the greater part of the interior. Along the south coast, the south-west monsoon becomes estab lished early in June and south to south-west winds, which are often strong, are experienced throughout June, July and August. In south-east Arabia, the wind direction during this period is from between south and east. During the transition periods between the summer and winter conditions, from March to May and from September to November, winds are light along the shores of the Persian Gulf, along the south coast of Arabia and in the interior, although in the northern districts of the interior occasional bursts of northerly winds are experienced. (ii) Upper Winds .—In the winter months, December to February, winds are westerly over the northern half of Arabia up to 6,000 ft., becoming north to north-west towards the Persian Gulf and north west to west over Oman. At 10,000 ft., the average wind speed increases and the direction becomes predominantly westerly from northern Arabia to Oman, with a proportion of winds from south west and north-west. Along the southern coast, the wind is between east and north-east up to 10,000 ft., becoming south to south-east over the southern half of the Red Sea. Over the interior, winds are mainly light, particularly in the first 3,000 ft. In the transition months, March to May, the wind distribution becomes more variable. Over the north-eastern half of the country, towards the Persian Gulf, the wind is still between north and west, becoming predominatingly westerly at 10,000 ft. The easterly current persists near the south-east coast, reaching a maximum frequency at 6,000 ft., but elsewhere, in the lower layers the wind is less definite. The southerly wind over the southern Red Sea tends to become more easterly at high levels. In the summer months, June to August, a north-westerly to northerly wind current extends over the greater part of the country at all heights up to 10,000 ft. Near Aden, however, the wind rarely reaches north of west, and at 10,000 ft. it becomes variable, the frequencies of westerly, northerly, and easterly winds being about the same. Near Oman, although northerly winds predominate at 10,000 ft., north-easterly winds are also frequent.92 From September to November, winds are between north and north-west up to 10,000 ft. near the Persian Gulf. Towards Oman they are rather more westerly up to 3,000 ft., while above this level they become north-west to north-east at 6,000 ft. and north to north-east at 10,000 ft. The north-easterly current persists from 6,000 to 10,000 ft. as far as Aden, but here, below 6,000 ft., the wind is mainly easterly. Over the southern half of the Red Sea, winds are between south and south-east to 6,000 ft. and between south-east and north-east at 10,000 ft. (hi) Local Winds.—Land and Sea Breezes .—Land and sea breezes are well developed on the shores of the Red Sea, especially in the south during the south-west monsoon season. They reach their greatest development in the area of light variable winds about latitude 20° N. Along the shores of the Persian Gulf, the land and sea breeze effect is noticeable at all times of year except during the passage of depressions in the winter. It is most marked from September to November when surface winds are light. Simnm .—The Simum is the name given to hot southerly winds which occur over the desert, usually in advance of an approaching depression in winter. The simum springs up suddenly, a hot, suffocating wind blowing from the south, filling the atmosphere with dust and sand. These winds are particularly prevalent in the northern desert and sometimes blow for several days in succession. They cause considerable discomfort to travellers, while camels have been known to die for want of breath in the hot wind. (/) Visibility, Light, etc. The main causes of bad visibility are the sandstorms which have already been described ; these may reduce the visual range to 30 or 40 yards. In hot weather, the air is usually hazy during the day owing to sand being lifted by the wind. The best time for good visibility is, normally, the early morning, when, from the air, it is often possible to see distances of 80 miles. Dust haze is frequent in the Persian Gulf, the north-westerly winds bringing dust from Iraq over the Gulf. Mist or fog is occasionally experienced near the coasts, but usually disperses early in the forenoon. Regular morning mists are prevalent over the high ground of Yemen in the winter months, the mist gathering in heavy banks in the valleys in the early morning ; they usually disperse, however, during the forenoon. Mirage is a frequent cause of impaired visibility when the line of sight is near the horizontal. 3. Magnetic Variation As far as is known, there is no obstacle to the use of a compass in all parts of Sa udi Arabia. A chart showing the degree of variation in different parts of the country is attached.4. Prevalent Diseases (a) Endemic In order of incidence— 1. Malaria 2. Dysentery 3. Smallpox 4. Syphilis 5. Tuberculosis 6. Trachoma 7. Typhoid 8. Stone 9. Measles Sakhuna. Zuhur. Jidri. Frangi. Mardn as Sadr. Habub al Jifl. Hajar al Musara. Hasba. Reliable figures for the whole country are not available. One hundred and forty-six persons were reported by the local medical authority as having died of smallpox in Mecca in 12 months in the year 1933/34. In the same period, 49 died of dysentery, 13 of typhoid, 32 of “ fevers,” 12 of measles, and 76 of tuberculosis. The diseases prevalent being well known, few remarks are necessary regarding precautions to be taken against them. Trachoma is unusual among Europeans, but frequent use of eye- lotions is advisable. The very great glare and dust cause acute conjunctivitis to Europeans. Eye-lotion and dark glasses ^orwhen the latter are not available, the use on the eyelid of powder of antimony (Kohl), which is readily obtainable in any town) is recommended. The latter has a shading effected on the whole eye and a more natural one than glasses give. In the Hejaz, Europeans incline to suffer from prickly heat. The use of special soaps (Asepso or Afridol) and the lightest possible of cotton clothes make best preventatives. (Khaki drill is unsuitably heavy, as are woollen socks or leather boots.) (6) Epidemic Cholera has not occurred since 1912, other than an occasional isolated case. (c) Animal Diseases Prevalent animal diseases are— Horses 1. Gripes 2. Farcy 3. Poll-evil 4. Navel disease 5. Warbels 6. Surfeit 7. Jaundice 8. Strangles Mughas. Saraj a. Harouq. Uqr as Sura. Uqr as Safha. Mahmour. Musfour. Saqawa.94 9. Mange Jarb. 10. Stag-evil Khatzir. 11. Headache .. Naura. 12. Mange under the tail Hatub. 13. Water upon the stomach .. Bash. Camels I. Stiffness of the neck, followed by Mata’iur. death. 2. Violent diarrhoea, followed by death Mahmour. 3. Colic, ending in death Maja’oum. 4. Smallpox Jidri. 5. Swollen legs Adhbat. 6. Stiffness in the fetlocks Iqawa. 7. Splaying out legs when walking .. Akhrad. 5. Suitable Clothing for various Seasons (i) General In Nejd and the higher districts of Asir and the Hejaz, tropical clothing is only required between May and October. In the coastal plain of the Hejaz and along the shore of the Persian Gulf it is required all the year round. (ii) Nejd Europeans everywhere, except in Jedda, in the Hejaz, are obliged, by local prejudice and the King’s command, to wear Arab clothes, of which it is possible to wear a lighter or heavier variety approximating to “ winter ” or “ tropical ” European dress. Sheepskin cloaks (farwa) are very desirable for wear in the Nejd highlands during the winter months, November to February, when the wind can be bitingly cold. (hi) Coastal Plains Between May and October on the coastal plains, only the thinnest cotton clothes should be worn (khaki drill clothing is unsuitable, heavy, and becomes clammy), care being taken to avoid a thickness or any overlapping of clothes round the waist, otherwise prickly heat is contracted. I he temperature does not drop much at night and the same clothes are worn as in the daytime. “ Cholera ” belts are not required ; on the contrary, to avoid prickly heat it is best to leave off even underclothes of any kind. During this period Europeans at Jedda usually wear the following only :— Cotton shirt or vest. Cotton trousers or shorts. Helmet or hat. Sandals or canvas shoes with rope soles. (Leather shoes and rubber soles are insupportably hot and harmful to the feet.)Mosquito nets are required at night, less in this period than during the intervening “ winter ” months, but should always be at hand for use during a still night. In a particularly cold year, flannel clothes can sometimes be worn round about December and January for short periods. 6. Insect Pests In the coastal plains and in some of the oases of Nejd, mosquitoes are a pest {see paragraph (iii) above). Among the Bedouin, lice (Gomal or Binet ad Drouz) are common. Locusts (Jarad) visit the country occasionally in immense swarms and do considerable damage to vegetation.CHAPTER VII COMMUNICATIONS 1. Waterways There are no waterways in Sa'udi Arabia. 2. Railways The only railway in Arabia is that known as the Hejaz Railway, which is a continuation of line from Damascus, through Transjordan, and southwards to Medina. The line crosses the Transjordan frontier and enters the Hejaz at Mudawara, thence through Tebuk, A1 'Ula to Medina. The line is single track with gauge of 1 • 05 metres, and has been out of action since 1925. The railway was originally built out of funds raised by Moslem subscription and the institution of a special stamp tax. It is claimed, therefore, that the whole railway is owned by the Moslems and is a religious property or “ Waqf.” The British and French Governments maintain that the ownership of the railway passed from the Ottoman Empire to that of the States in whose territories it now lies, and a conference was held at Haifa in August, 1928, to consider the work required to put the line in repair, and, amongst other questions, the allocation to the Hejaz of a certain amount of rolling stock. Owing to the insistence of Ibn Sa’ud’s delegates that the owner ship of the line should be discussed, that the railway was Waqi, and that the sections in Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan should be handed over to Ibn Sa’ud, the conference was unable to make any progress and nothing further has been accomplished. The project has been reviewed again (October, 1935). 3. Roads Car roads [see Map of Communications in Sa’udi Arabia, attached) throughout this country are unmetalled or prepared with the exception of 35 kilometres of the road between Jedda and Mecca. Car routes have taken the easiest line across the natural surface of the country and, in consequence, considerable diversions are found, while many areas are still unapproachable by cars. Garages, refilling stations, and traffic control in the European sense of the words are all unknown. (C 23593) E98 Dumps of petrol, contained in 12-gallon drums, are maintained by Government order at certain points on the main routes. Cars are not allowed to travel singly across certain waterless and sandy areas and where possible are wireless-signalled in and out. 4. Air Communications There are no internal air communications in the country (for military aviation see Chapter 9). Imperial Airways route to India and the East passes through the Persian Gulf along the Hasa coast from Basra to Bahrain, and this is the nearest point of connection with an external air route. No foreign air transport companies use landing grounds in Sa’udi Arabia. (See Chapter IV, paragraph 1, page 49, for note on Imperial Communications.) 5. Telegraph, Telephone, Postal and Radio (a) Postal Arrangements The only postal services are as follows :— Mecca to Medina Weekly ; ex Mecca on Mondays. Two days en route; same two vans return. Fortnightly; ex Mecca every other Saturday. Four days en route; same two vans return. Daily ; ex Mecca at dusk. Daily, at dusk. The services (one van each) usually pass at Bahra. No other regular civil posts exist in Sa’udi Arabia. Passengers may travel on the post van at a charge of £1 (g), Mecca to Riyadh, or £2 (g) Mecca to Medina. Of this latter sum, £1 “ Koshan ” or Holy Areas Tax. Telegrams are received for transmission by wireless or cable at— Mecca to Riyadh Jedda to Mecca Mecca to Jedda Internal (W/T) Foreign (cable) 8 Sa’udi piastres per word. 4 (Government-owned (b) (i) Telephone Systems Jedda to Mecca and on to Taif. German installation, overhead line.) One Soviet automatic set in Palace at Taif (Government use). One Soviet automatic set in Riyadh (Government use). Wireless telephony between Mecca and Riyadh has been tried.99 (ii) Submarine Cables The only cable communicating with Sa'udi Arabia, that between Jedda and Port Sudan, formerly the property of the Government of the Ottoman Empire, is now the joint property of the Sudan and Sa’udi Arabian Governments. The working of the cable and its maintenance are entrusted by the owners to the Eastern Telegraph Company. The cable terminal in Jedda is worked by the Posts and Telegraphs administration of the Sa’udi Arab Government. The E.T.C. pay the Sa’udi Arab Government in respect of the salaries of two employees to undertake the working of the terminal, and have, in conjunction with Cable and Wireless Limited, what is tantamount to an agreement to their monopoly of both wireless and telegraphic communication of Sa’udi Arabia with the outside world. The agreement to this end is in force for 25 years from 1st June, 1935, subject to notification by the parties concerned of their desire to cancel or modify the agreement once in every five years. The cable was laid in 1882 from Jedda to Suakim, and was diverted in 1923 from Suakim to Port Sudan. During the Wahhabi-Hashimite war in 1924/25, it was cut or broken near the Jedda end (2 miles north of town), and was subse quently worked from a hut erected on reefs in the sea. In 1927, an extension was laid from the hut to Jedda town, the cable coming ashore at the Admiralty Police Post and being carried across lagoons overhead. The total length of the cable is 193-4 N/M., and of the original cable 124-5 N/M. remains. The core of the original cable consists of copper weighing 107 lb. per N/M. insulated by gutta-percha weighing 140 lb. per N/M. The armouring “ sheathing ” consists of 15 strands of N.R.13 galvanized iron wire (N.R.13 B.W.G.). The present method of working is single-current Morse, hand sending speed. (c) Wireless Two networks of wireless stations work respectively Nejd and Hejaz, including Asir. They are connected by the stations Mecca and Riyadh as a central link. All W/T stations in the country are owned by the Government. Details are set out in the attached list.

Crops In the Hejaz valleys, where water exists, a little millet and maize with occasional patches of rice are the usual crops. In Nejd, lucerne is often grown under the date palms in the oases. Wheat and barley are sometimes grown in patches of the open deserts of the north and north-west in the winter by means of rain water. Most of the Ikhwan settlements have date palm gardens. In Asir, millet, sesame, maize, and rice are the usual crops. The supply is barely sufficient for the inhabitants, and there are no exports of grain or fruit from Sa’udi Arabia. 2. Cattle and Sheep The majority of the inhabitants of Nejd are pastoral nomads. A number of sheep, impossible to estimate, find their way to the towns and markets of the surrounding countries for slaughter, but sheep are kept mainly for their wool. There are probably about 7,000,000 camels in the country, the majority being milch and riding camels rather than baggage animals. 3. Motor Transport All mechanical transport is in the control of the Government sponsored “Arab Transport Company,” the officials of which are appointed by the Government. It is divided into a Government and Civilian branch. The retail of spares is also controlled by Govern ment through the Company, the headquarters of which is in Mecca. Wear and tear is exceptionally heavy, and cars last on an average only three years, after which they are stripped and abandoned. The chief use of Government cars is for transport of troops and munitions, and that of the civilian branch cars for transport of pilgrims between Jedda, Mecca, and Medina during the short pilgrim season. The control by Government enables it to interchange the cars of the two branches of the Company for these or other purposes. The estimated total number of cars in 1935 was— Motor buses, 9 to 18-passenger capacity 500 Lorries .. .. .. .. •. 200 Passenger cars (tourers) .. .. .. 1,000 Imports of motor vehicles for the period 1932-34, inclusive, were— Passenger cars .. .. 198, of which 190 were of American or Canadian make. Commercial vehicles .. 156, mostly American. E 3 (C 23593)102 4. Minerals (1) Oilfield of the Standard Oil Company (Arabia Californian) at Jabal Dhahran, 8 kilometres west of A1 Khobar on the Persian Gulf shore opposite Manama (Bahrain). Quay at A1 Khobar. A pre liminary survey had been carried out by the end of 1934, and preparations for drilling were in hand. (2) Gold mine at 41° E., 23° 30' N., between Mecca and Medina. Quay at Jedda. To be exploited by the Sa’udi Arabian Mining Syndicate, Ltd., a concern with a considerable proportion of British capital. 5. Petrol No large reserve stocks are retained in seaports. Stocks held by civil companies at Jedda are sometimes, in cases of emergency, reduced to nil by seizure or purchase by the Government. No stock can be relied upon. 6. Timber In the Hejaz mountains, large wooded areas exist, mostly acacia, which are drawn upon by the inhabitants and sold for fuel and building purposes to the people of the towns of the coastal area. Round about Jedda and Mecca, the Juhadila tribe engage in this trade. 7. Fuel Charcoal exists in the neighbourhood of Wejh, and is exported, usually coastwise, from there. The range and quantity available is not known, but Khedivial Mail steamers are sometimes required to carry as many as 200 large bags. 8. Commerce See Chapter II for what little is known of this subject. No accurate figures are available. 9. Shipping (а) Persian Gulf No steamers call at any Sa’udi Arab port of the Persian Gulf. (Steamers of British India Steamship Company call at Bahrain.) (б) Red Sea Steamers of the Khedivial Mail Line (the capital of which is predominantly Egyptian and in the hands of Abood Pasha) call at Wejh, Yenbu’, and Jedda weekly. Steamers of Strick, Ellerman Line call at Jedda according to cargo, usually about every six weeks, and steamers of an Italian Line call there fortnightly.103 CHAPTER IX ARMED FORCES 1. General 1 he military forces cannot, at present, well be divided into Regular or Irregular Forces without giving a misleading impression, for the standing force or “ Regular Army ” of the Hejaz Province is hardly more than a small, untried, garrison police force, and the only standing forces of the Nejd Provinces are the personal retainers of the King and leading personages. In times of emergency a call is made on various sections of the manhood of the country, all of them trained to and carrying arms from childhood. 2. Total Man-power Of a total population of approximately 5,000,000 souls, it is assumed that there are some 2,000,000 males ; the armed strength of the kingdom, it is considered, is little more than 50,000 men. Boys, however, usually take the field, having before now led contingents in the field, as witness the Amir Faisal, who captured Medina at the age of thirteen, and these might bring the total up to almost 75,000. A detailed estimate of the total armed forces available is given in Table I at the end of this chapter. 3. Types of Forces The forces which can be called upon are— (i) The Hejaz ' Regular Army.” (ii) The personal retainers of the King and leading persons, who take the field with their masters. (iii) Levy from villages and towns. (iv) The men of the religious settlements, the Ikhwan. (v) The tribesmen. (vi) The Air Force (three serviceable aircraft, 1936).Table II at the end of this chapter, gives the Saudi Arab state ment of armed forces submitted to the League of Nations in 1932. For accuracy it cannot be relied upon, although it may have a basis of fact. (i) The Hejaz Regular Army This is known as the Jaish al Hejaz. “ Gendarmery ” would better describe it, and the infantry of the force are, in fact, known as Police. The force is almost untried in the field, having hitherto been used only as base troops in war and garrisons in the Hejaz towns in peace. p ay —The men are nominally paid a regular wage, but this is often behind or issued in the form of bills which the soldiers sell to merchants for less than their face value, in order to obtain ready money. (b\ Uniform. —The uniform varies, but geneially, when issued, which is not always to all men, consists of jodpores and tunic in khaki, a collar tab denoting by its colour whether the man belongs to a machine-gun, field-gun, or infantry (police) platoon. Mai clung boots are of the type issued to the ai mies of Eui ope, resembling closely the British Army pattern. With this, an Arab head-dress, either red and white, black and white, or khaki, is worn. Colour Tab Machine-gunner . • • • • Red- Field-gunner .. .. • • • • Black. Infantry (Police) .. • • • • Green. (c) Recruiting and Manpower. —Vacancies for recruits are adver tised in the newspapers. Period of service not less than three years. Recruits present themselves at the Jarwal Barracks, Mecca, any day between 9 a.m. and 12 to the Directorate of Military Affairs. Applicants must be Sa’udi subjects, between 18 and 22 years of age, and free from disease. No other standard except that of good character is specified. Military Education and Training {d) Officers .—A military school exists in Mecca. Applicants for training apply to the Director of Military Affairs at Jarwal Barracks. The course of study is for three years. Students who pass all three courses and the examination for each course are appointed as Second Lieutenants.Arab state- ins in 1932. lave a basis ery ’ ’ would fact, known :o been used ms in peace. 2 , but this is diers sell to btain ready vhen issued, md tunic in man belongs ..

The standards required are the same as for recruits. In so far as the rank and file is concerned, the majority is trained to arms from childhood. No system of progressive individual training or collective training is in force. (e) Arms .—Rifles : Short Mauser (German). Long PFK. Warzawa (Polish) (-303). (Note .—Usually marked “Abdul Aziz, his property. God curse who sells without his permission.”) Machine-guns—(1) Skoda (bought 1932). (2) German (taken with booty of Medina, 1925). (3) Turkish (taken with booty of Medina, 1925). (4) British (taken with booty of Medina, 1925). (5) Italian (given, 1936). bield-guns—old, of various patterns and calibres; mostly Turkish. (There are four old armoured cars no longer serviceable at Jedda, which are only here mentioned as they figure in former descriptions of Sa’udi Arab forces.) (/) Reserves of Munitions.—In June, 1935, there were, on reliable authority, the following reserves of arms :— 12,000 rifles in Royal Store at Riyadh. 85 guns (one-third useless, one-third out of repair, and one-third serviceable), at Riyadh. 16 machine-guns bought in May, 1935, from Skoda (at Mecca). It is estimated that there is, at any one time, a reserve of not less than 250,000 rounds of rifle ammunition of various calibre (mostly -303) at Mecca, Taif and Medina, and 500,000 rounds in the Royal Armoury at Riyadh. In addition, there must be approximately 3,000,000 rounds, mostly *303, in the possession of individual Shaikhs and provincial and district Amirs.2,765 [other ranksFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ipany Field Notes on Sa‘udi Arabia and GARRISONS ntier states 1 n Q h i a/ ■' ■’V'oQ 3 ^ (Q ara| y a ) \ ^ '\EI Jadaidat‘Ara?b\. \ Q. i ^ \ N^- (Winter and Spring ^ ^ • \ ■ Rain \ 'V s ' during tax gathering only) \ j \ ) 13 0 Sakaka \m a i Y°Jauf IMudawara ■ Y oAlaqanj^ummShaihthiya ’’DhatAI Haj Medina Map Section A.M.

War Office 1936.109 (ii) The Personal Retainers of the King and Leading Persons These bodyguards of young unmarried freemen (“ hurr ” or free, as opposed to the negroes, slaves or descendants of slaves) known as the Zaqurt, vary in number with the importance of their lord. The King has a corps of 300. His elder sons and such leading persons as Ibn Jaluwi, the Governor of Hasa, and Ibn Musa’ad, the Governor of J abal Shammar, have an average of 100. The paramount Shaikhs of the great tribes of Nejd have an average of 50 each. They contribute a small but reliable standing force, provided as they are with food, equipment, clothes, arms, and usually (for the sake of their position) well received and provided for by their hosts, whenever they travel on their lord’s business. They are never massed, but take the field as a bodyguard to their chief. They would often be supported, in that case, by the personal “ slaves ” and negro servants of the chief. The total under this head is estimated at 1,250, but could, and would, be augmented in times of crisis to about double its ordinary strength. (hi) Levies from Villages and Towns (exclusive of religious settlements) These are known as the Hadhr, and are only called up in case of emergency, through the Provincial Amir, by order to the headmen of towns and villages. Their arms, provided by themselves, are very various. Food and other supplies in the first instance, on taking the field, are also provided by themselves, as well as their mounts, camel or mare. A system of buying off from this feudal duty is in force. A rich merchant will pay as much as 100 riyals to be excused, if the intended campaign is far afield, or 40 if near by. The total number available as Hadhr is not known, but is estimated at 12,000. (iv) Men from the Religious Settlements These were the famous Ikhwan or brothers in religion, the backbone of Ibn Saud’s forces during the establishment of his kingdom (see Chapters I and III). Animated by religious zeal and for the most part virile tribesmen only recently settled, they formed a formidable force. The King has seen to it that they were, when needed, well aimed. They are not to be found outside Nejd. Their fanatical spirit is much reduced from what it was in the third decade of this century (see Appendix IV). A list of Ikhwan settlements is included in Chapter III of this report; many have, however, been partly or totally abandoned since the defeat of the Ikhwan revolt (1930). The total of the Ikhwan for fighting purposes is estimated at 4,000.110 (v) The Tribesmen From a military point of view, the tribes may be considered as so- many territorial, camel and mare-mounted regiments, but certain units of which, by reason of distance from the scene of action, temporary political or religious differences, or the recalcitrance of their chiefs, may from time to time be ruled out as available to take the field. . . Each unit, its strength and outstanding characteristics is described below. For locations see tribal map. (A) The Hejaz (1) Huwaitat. (Part of, remainder being in Iransjordan and Egypt.) Warlike, but inclined to be divided among themselves. Leading families : Abu 1 aqaiqa and al Asabi. Total armed men : 1,500. (2) Shararat.

Historically, supporters of the Al Sa’ud and Wahhabism, but, in their religious fervour, flung off the control of Ibn Sa’ud in 1928, being finally broken in 1930. Their remnants remain at heart disaffected. (See page 111 for Hejazi sections and North African connection.) Leading family : Al Dawish. Fighting strength : 750. (v) Ajman. —Formerly a strong fighting tribe, who, leaning to extreme Wahhabism, were in full revolt against Ibn Sa’ud in 1929. Unlike the Mutair, the Ajman are historically hostile to the Al Sa'ud. In the suppression of the revolt in 1930, they suffered more than any other tribe. Through them extreme Wahhabism was dealt a severe blow. Leading family : Ibn Hathlain. Fighting strength : 300. (vi) Bani Khalid. —An ancient tribe identified by some Orientalists as descended from the Chaldeans. The Amirs of the Bani Khalid, formerly overlords of Hasa, although displaced as leaders, will not marry their daughters to any but those of the purest descent. A section of the tribe under Al Dandal are in Syria. Leading family : Al Khalid. Fighting strength (Nejd) : 500. (vii) Bani Hajir.—A small tribe with a somewhat evil reputation. Leading family : * Fighting strength : 450. (viii) Al Murra.—A tribe with great range, wild nomads of the heart of Arabia. Virtually pagans. Leading family : Nil. Fighting strength : 2,000. fix) Manasir. —A border tribe, some of whose sections penetrate into territory claimed by the Al Sa’ud. According to even the Deputy Foreign Minister of Sa’udi Arabia, they are little known. Leading family : Nil. Fighting strength : 200. (x) Qahtan.—'lhe most ancient tribe of Arabia. Stout fighters. Leading family : * Fighting strength : 750. (xi) Subai (and Suhul).-Branches, now autonomous, of the Qahtan. Leading family : * Fighting strength : 1,500. Information not available.114 (xii) Dhafir —A tribe recently induced by Ibn Sa’ud and political circumstances to emigrate to Nejd from 'Iraq, where two-thirds of the tribe still remain. Allied to the Shammar, whose feud with Anaiza they share. Leading family : Ibn Suwait. Fighting strength : 600. (xiii) Ad Dawasir .—A tribe now almost entirely settled. Their numbers are considered under the section “ Hadhr,” or settled peoples. (C) A sir It is not practicable to give a lay-out of the tribes of Asir, as has been shown above in the case of the tribes of the Hejaz and Nejd. While known as tribes and being to a certain extent nomadic, the population is so broken up by the configuration of the country, and their units are so many (over 400 tribes are known), that their fighting strength and value is best considered as a whole. The most powerful tribes are as follows :— Az Zahran. A1 Har. A1 Ghamid. Bani Marwan. Ash Shamran. Bil Harrath. A1 Masarihah. A1 Munjiha. An Naju. Bani Hilal. Bani Yam. Bil Aryan. Bil Qarn. Bani Shahir. Ahl Barak. A1 Arish. A1 Musa. Bil Asmar. Bil Ahmar. Rijal al Ma’ Ya’ala. Bani Thuwwab. Greatly dispersed and therefore not shown on tribal location map. Bani Mughaid. Ja’afira. Bani Malik. juwada. Ahl Duraib. It is not known exactly what number of men might be raised in Asir, but it is probably true that 20,000 men could be put in the field, which is the number Douin (see his Histoire du regime du Khedive Ismail, Chapter XI) gives as to what Asir put in the field against the Egyptians and Turks in 1865. It is doubtful, however, that this number could be easily doubled, as Douin says. 4. Mobilization (a) Regular Forces No reserve to the regular force exists and mobilization means no more than ordering the troops to the front, usually by lorry. Up to date the regular force has followed, and not been in advance of, the main army consisting of the levies, tribal and Ikhwan elements.115 (b) Levies, Tribal and Ikhwan Orders are usually issued in the form of a letter despatched by camel rider, or by wireless signal through a provincial Amir, from the King in person to the heads of communities, to muster at a given time and place. The number of men required is usually specified, the number that any community being likely to supply in any given circumstance being estimated in the Royal circle from previous knowledge. Lists of men taking the field are usually made by leaders of contingents. Note .—In the Hejaz vice-Regal province there has always been a tendency in some Amirates in an emergency to make an open appeal to individuals to come to join the force about to take the field. Uniform is not necessarily issued, but a regular rate of pay is promised. With the transfer of the Jauf Amirate to the Hejaz administration, this system has to some extent been adopted in that Amirate. The Royal Appeal to the communities to furnish contingents having been issued, a rendezvous is given to each group, either direct or through the administrative Amir, according to the standing of the Amir, and the heads of the contingents. In the case of village levies, for example, an order is issued through the Amir. In the case of one of the great tribes, a letter of appeal is addressed direct from the capital, under Royal seal, to. the paramount Shaikh. In the case of the Ikhwan, the chaplains acting on instructions from the “ ’Ulama” (or religious heads) make their spiritual appeal for preparation for war, and the Amir of the province indicates to the heads of the settlements, the Royal directions for assembling their men. This “ mobilization ” cannot be kept secret, but nearly always, by spreading a rumour and ordering a rendezvous in the opposite direction to their objective, the enemy is mystified. Traditionally, every owner of a mare is required to appear and, in case of a general levy, every owner of a riding camel is required to come. In the orders from the capital to the heads of contingents and provinces, the requirements as to this will normally be stated. For example, in summer, numerous mares, necessitating fiequent watering, would be a handicap. In the case of a punitive expedition, partaking of the natiue of a large-scale raid, many camel riders would take a man pillion to return with the captured animals. In other cases it is not unusual for men on foot to attach themselves to a camel rider, who lets them down to fight and is responsible for taking them up again later. (Pillion = Murdouf.) When forces take the field for more than about a month, it is usual for the men, before leaving their own people, to arrange for theii relief after a certain period. In the case of large contingents, a116 leader may take upon himself to arrange this by groups from his various reliefs or tribal sections. This sometimes leads to miscon ception by those not acquainted with the arrangement, who mistake it for abscondment in the face of the enemy and of indicating lack of morale. 5. Commands and Staff (a) Regular Forces There is no staff in the usual sense of the word. Officers have been found in a haphazard way. They have among their numbers, for example, Syrian political refugees, old Turks, Egyptians formerly with the Hashimite war-time army, and a Javanese. The new Cadet School, opened in 1935, is intended to train Sa’udi Arab subjects, and is under the command of an Egyptian ex-ofhcer. Ranks in the Regular Army are as follows :— Mulazim Thani .. .. 2nd Lieutenant. Mulazim Awal .. .. Lieutenant. Rais Captain. Qaid Major. Kaimakam .. .. Colonel. There are no higher ranks. (b) Levies, Tribal and Ikhwan The heads of communities, or their deputies, often their relatives nominated by them, form the equivalent of the command and staff. 6. Military Traditions and Tactics (a) Composition and Concentration of the Force The force is usually divided into— Khubra .. A section of 7 to 12 men. (Each section between them makes one camp fire, the traces of which are sometimes therefore useful in estimating the size of a force.) Sariya .. A company of between 30 and 100 men. Bairaq .. A contingent consisting of several companies under one authorised to lead a contingent by the King. In front of it, works the advance guard (sabr), sometimes as much as two days in advance of the main body.117 1 he scouts of both the advance guard and the main body are called “ aiun ” (lit., eyes), but this term is more usually applied only to the skirmishing scouts in front of the main body. The “ sabr ' or advance guard is often ordered to take up, as temporary prisoners, persons encountered, lest they ride ahead to warn the enemy of the approach of the force. The route taken by the force must necessarily follow a line of water-holes unless recent rain has left sufficient standing water in the desert. In the first case, it soon becomes apparent to what lines the force is committed. After winter rain, surprises are much more easily arranged by the commander of the force ; for an example, there is the operation directed against the Huwaitat in 1930, when rain pools in the Southern Hamad downs enabled the approaching force to avoid Jauf, and secure a surprise. The commander of a force is traditionally the most acceptable military commander to the majority, and is not necessarily the tribal Shaikh. As, however, Shaikhs, contrary to general opinion, do not succeed by primogeniture, but are adopted only by popular consent from among the members of the Shaikhly houses of a tribe or village, it frequently happens that the Shaikh is acceptable as a leader in the field, his strength of character and general wisdom, if not military ability, having already been the subject of tribal scrutiny. This leader in the field, whoever he may be, is known as an 'Aqid. He is supported, if a Shaikh, by his own personal retainers, the Zaqurt [see page 109). A second force on which the Aqid greatly relies is a temporarily created body of stout hearts selected from among the various contingents, but usually includes some of the Zaqurt and, as well, negro retainers of the leader. This is known as the Manqiya. It is used as a striking force, and as a rallying point if the contingent become shaken in action. An office of importance is that of the Colour bearer of the force, known as Hamil al Bairaq (or A1 Alam), who is usually supported by a negro bodyguard. A great tribal contingent, if in full force with its paramount Shaikh, brings its own standard (Maksar) consisting of a light structure decorated with ostrich feathers and mounted on a camel, although this custom is becoming rarer. (In the case of the Ruwala Anaiza, a Syrian tribe, the units of which sometimes cross into Sa’udi Arabia, the standard is elaborated and receives a measure of veneration not customary in other tribes. It is known as the Otfi.) (6) Supplies All contingents (except the Zaqurt standing force) provide their own arms, ammunition and food on taking the field, but if retained far from their homelands, would be supplied by the arrangements and at the expense of the command.118 (c) Order of Battle , , Having established, through the Sabr or advance guard the locatio^ of the enemy and assuming that on approach they s and to figh (Nawwakh wa Aqul), the commander issues h.s orders for- it The distribution of the contingents from right to left, (i The station of the Manqiya and colour bearer of the force, which latter is usually in the centre of the line, a little advanced. , , (iiil For the dismounting of pillion riders and their advance as infantry in front of the line. There is usually no special signal for commencement of the attack' but the Aqid beginning with his bodyguards to move forward, every man, lest he be thought a coward, urges his camel on and hurries to distinguish himself in action for the sake of family and tribal honour. (ivl Assembly after the action, in the event of a retirement. (iv) Usually three rendezvous are given, all wells. Here straeelers may rejoin the main force. The first rendezvous is usually close at hand, the next some hours away, and the third as much as a day s or two days’ camel ride. ^ Traditionally, booty taken from heretics, non-Wahhabi Moslems, is distributed as follows : l/5th for Ibn Saud. 4/5ths for the troops. This latter being distributed in the proportion of— Owner of a mare • • • • ^ shares. Camel rider “ ” Footman 1 share ' 7. The Sa’udi Arab Air Force ^ Force is so simple a one at present that it hardly deserves There are three serviceable Wapitis (1936). ^ 11 1 jJ^f doubtful if the third could fly, but in December after P™&gt;hase some spare parts, it appeared in the an at Jedda a the other two at Taif. f The aircraft were originally acquired in 1929 by purcha England, when British pilots were originally employe . of For various reasons this system was 1 dl f c ® ntl ! 1 ( U ^f h -Z. RuS sians’’ 1930, and in June, 1934, two Russian pilots (ex r d i n the then resident in Egypt who had previously been employe Hejaz under the Hashimite regime) took their place.119 Maintenance is a hand to mouth affair. Flying is very rare, about twice a month for two hours each time, and then usually without any particular purpose. There is no attempt at regular training. The chief pilot, it may be added, to complete a picture of an air force which must be almost unique, is a bearded and bent Russian, aged perhaps fifty, who habitually walks with a stick. (b) Equipment Wapitis, three serviceable, at Taif. Broken parts of seven other aircraft, i.e., one Wapiti and six D.H.9 (Puma), latter acquired by capture from the Hashimites in 1925 : some at Jedda and some at Taif. Maintenance has been almost completely neglected. Fabric is rotting and dope cracking, fittings badly rusted or corroded, and controls worn. None is fitted with pilot’s gun, but all have scarff rings and light series bomb racks. One Lewis gun and seven German parabellum guns. Ten Siddeley Puma spare engines in fair condition.

[h) Landing Grounds Details of the following landing grounds are given at the end of this chapter:— Darin. Jedda. Riyadh. Taif. Wejh. Yenbu’. Note.- Where information is not available under certain headings these have been left blank.120 Other sites on which aircraft could land are— Rabigh .. See p. 73 for reconnaissance report by Major E. J. Bannatyne, R.F.C., dated 5th September, 1916. Jinna Island .. A landing ground was constructed here in December, 1930, by the British personnel of the Sa’udi Air Force. In February, 1932, it was reported on reliable authority to be marked and fit for use, with a customs clerk in attendance. Jubaila Muwaih Duwadmi Constructed in February, 1930, by the British personnel of the Sa'udi Air Force, this landing ground was in use, in March, 1934, by an aircraft of the Californian Arabian Oil Company. Suitable site only. Landing ground not yet defined. Liable to be unusable in wet weather (see panorama and sketch plan of Muwaih, page 152). Fort and water. Is on the possible transcontinental air route. Suitable site only. Landing ground not yet defined. W/T. Was mentioned as likely site on transcontinental air route to Wing-Cmdr. Stent by Ibn Sa’ud, 1929. Fort and water. The information given should be treated with reserve, and prior confirmation that the landing grounds are in existence should be obtained before using them. No stocks of aviation spirit are maintained at any of the landing grounds, and advance arrangements must be made with Gellatley Hankey (Sudan), Ltd., in the case of the landing grounds on the Red Sea coast, and with the Sa’udi Arab Government in all other cases, for fuel supplies to be made available. It should be noted that no aircraft is allowed to fly over any part of Sa’udi Arabia without permission of the Government of that country. Local time is reckoned by two different methods in the Hejaz. For the Arab population, the day ends at sundown, and watches are then set to 12 o’clock. The European population set their watches to 6 o’clock at sundown. LANDING GROUND 1. Name : DARIN (Tarut Island). 2.

Since February, 1931, while the pound gold remains the basis of the Sa'udi currency, the riyal has stood at a fluctuating value determined by market conditions. The nickel coinage consists of the piastre Sa’udi, which is fixed at the rate of 22 piastres Sa’udi equals one riyal. Official government payments and charges are made in piastres miri, for which no coin exists, but which is calculated either at 110 piastres to the pound gold and known as the piastre miri gold, or, more usually, at one piastre miri equals two piastres Sa'udi. In the Hejaz, Egyptian currency, English bank notes, and Indian rupees are also accepted for all purposes in the principal towns, while in Nejd the Maria Theresa dollar is still current, although not legal. The rough average value of the Sa’udi riyal for the years 1933-34 was Is. 5d. sterling, but the rate invariably rises in the month of Ramadhan on the arrival of pilgrims from abroad, and may reach Is. &amp;d. (Riyals 12 = ^El.) In the eastern provinces there has been an increasing tendency to employ rupees, a practice receiving recent official sanction and encouragement. The “ tawila ” token coin, formerly in wide use in Hasa, is now very rarely seen. It is a hook-shaped article in iron, of very small value.329 f 2 (C23593) APPENDIX III Calendar and Time The Islamic, and hence Sa’udi Arabian year differing from the Christian year, the following note of explanation is here included. ^ e . I s ^ am i c e ra commences from the new moon of 15th July, a.d. 622. The Islamic year being lunar, is shorter than the Christian year (solar) by ten days, twenty-one hours, fourteen and two-fifths seconds. As the Christian m0n ^ S • 1 ^ nore moon and the Islamic exactly follow it, the coincidence of one Christian to one Islamic month is an accident rarely produced. Similarly, New year s day of the Islamic year and the great Islamic festivals may occur in summer or winter, while always falling in the same day in the same Islamic month. 2. Months (the Sa’udi Arabian) in order are— Ashur (Muharram). Safar. Rabia. Rabia al Akhr. Jamad. Jamad al Akhr. Qasair (Sha'ban)} Shurh al Baidl &gt;- Ramadhan. Al Futr (Shawwal). Dhi al Qadah. Adh Dhahiya (Dhi al Hijja). The year is also divided by seasons into— Thalatha Qaidh Thalatha Asfariyat .. Thalatha Kuwanin .. Thalatha Khamsawat Midsummer. Autumn. Winter. Spring. 3. A convenient approximate method of converting a Moslem to a Christian year is to divide it by 33, subtract quotient from dividend, and add 622. To convert from Christian to Moslem, subtract 622, divide remainder by 33, and add quotient to dividend. The 26th December, 1936, was, in the Arabic calendar, the 1st of Shawwal, 1354. 4. Time in Sa’udi Arabia is reckoned by the daylight being divided into twelve hours, and the night the same. One o’clock at night is one hour after dusk. One o’clock of the day is one hour after dawn. Hence daylight hours in the summer are longer than in the winter, and the night hours also vary according to the season.APPENDIX IV NOTE ON THE STATE OF WAHHABISM VIEWED FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT, 1935 Militant and fanatical Wahhabism is dead, and Wahhabism, being nothing if not militant and fanatical, may therefore be accounted dead. Reasons for its decease The reason for its decease can only be appreciated if the reason for its second rise, the peak of which may be put between 1910 and 1930, is remembered. Philby (page 223 of his book, “Arabia ’’) ascribes its second revival to policy on Ibn Sa’ud’s part and not his religious zeal. The pre-war Admiralty Handbook of Arabia, while describing Wahhabism as already the moral basis of Ibn Sa’ud’s power, states that he is accounted lax and plays a gramophone in camp. It is clear that, instituted as a matter of policy, it came as a panacea for ills to the ever miserable Bedouin, and was taken up so fervently as to carry Ibn Sa’ud further than he meant to go. By 1929, it was quite out of hand and, trying conclusions with the outside world, had to be suppressed by the Royal Air Force and Ibn Sa’ud, with heavy losses to the Wahhabis. The survivors realised that they had been misguided. The most fanatical and militarily potent Wahhabis had been those to suffer most. The Mutair, large numbers of the Harb, Ataiba tribesmen and villagers in those “ diras ’’ were killed and their cattle lost to them. A Mutairi Shaikh, once one of the fiercest of Wahhabis, asked, this July, why he had changed so much since 1929, replied by touching his head. “ Then,” he said, “ we were possessed by jinns,” and after a pause added, “And who put them there ? Why, Ibn Sa’ud.” This, or something like it, is a constantly reiterated thought and “ morale ” is now strikingly absent among them. Ibn Sa’ud is regarded as a master rather than a leader. He has the whip hand of them but not the tongue to persuade them. The losses in men, cattle and material are ever present in the minds of those who were hitherto the fiercest of the Wahhabis, those who suffered most in 1929/30, and they will no longer hurry to war against the heretic, Moslem or Christian, at his appeal to them as Imam of the Wahhabis, although they may obey him as Keeper of the Money-bags of Arabia and as a man of temporal power. The Signs of decay This outlook has gradually made such inroads on Wahhabism that its decay is now inescapably noticeable to the traveller through Sa udi ra la. Cigarette smoking, even in Riyadh, is widely indulged in; gramophones play all day and half the night in the Hejaz towns ; radios may play music in Riyadh without much comment; the King’s sons and relatives send into Kuwait for tobacco (the young Amir Muhammad had commissioned one of my party, in this Tuly, to bring him a consignment “ as usual ) ; Christians, in aircraft, may land by Ikhwan settlements without warning and are unharmed ; silk may be bought in the bazaars of Riyadh , laggar s o pra\ ers escape punishment, and the Committees of Virtue havedisnAegratedorare with difficulty, kept alive by the more conservative. Soldiers (Wahhabi or otherwise) sell supplies from the Government whenever they can, to get money, which they seldom receive otherwise. f 3 (C23593)131 Mv nartv in July, which included Wahhabis, on arrival at Kuwait, sold lie to^hwetic' Moslems) arms, ammunition, spares, and everything they u ^ anH that under the noses oi a Saudi Arab delegation could lay hands °X e ?he r f aSthe Sa’udi Arab agent in Kuwait. Con- firmationomu laxity was forthcoming from two distinguished Arab leaders. In September this year, the Amir 'Abdullah said to me of Wahhabism “ Mat/’Te , dead. The Shaikh of Kuwait, while in Syria, and without prompting from me, said the same thing. Effects of the decay of Wahhabism This decay of Wahhabism makes, of course, no difference to the essential characteristics of the Arabs. Security now is so well maintained in the countries surrounding Sa’udi Arabia that it is possible to overlook what was the state of affairs in non- Wahhabi Arab countries before 1918. \mong the nomads, foreigners were never safe without either a large escort or a “ rafiq ” from the tribe through which they were moving. If Wahhabism represents extreme intolerance, its or the Mowing of another Moslem code, does not mean the opposite and that extreme tolerance will be adopted. The nomad Sa’udi Arab remains, even without extreme Wahhabism as difficult a fellow as in the last century, if less likely in the future to overrun his frontier than he has been in recent years. In so far as the outer world is concerned, Sa’udi Arabia is still a piece among the nations. In so far as Ibn Sa’ud is concerned, ^eft of the binding force of his kingdom, he is faced with an embarrassing problem for the future. Effect on Ibn Sa’ud’s Military Policy of the decay of Wahhabism In a country the size of Sa’udi Arabia, and with modernized states sur rounding it, rapid communications were essential, and the early introduc ion of wireless and cars for Royal use were not necessarily a herald of any lurtner modernization. There, “ progress ” might have stayed for long. That private taxi companies are forbidden and all car owners have only recently been ordered to pool their cars in a state monopoly transport compan&gt; or abandon their use for hiring out, shows which way the wind blows. Modernization, if any, is to be the King’s prerogative. Militarily, it is of course greatly advantageous that he should be able to order out quickly the whole fleet of public vehicles in the country, and even more advantageous perhaps that, now, no one else can arrange to hire em for some coup. The directors and officials in the state monopoly company are all state-paid by Ibn Sa’ud. Where are the troops to fill these transport columns in case of need ? Apart from the Royal Retainers, a numerous corps, there are, if strong Ikhwan W T ahhabi contingents are now ruled out— (а) Tribal detachments. (б) Townsmen levies. \c) The Army or/and Police. The first two have been found unstable and disinclined to prolonged campaign ing for economic reasons, and the last is small, untried, and ill-discip me In this quandary it is not surprising to learn that larger and wider distribution of subsidies is being made to the tribes on the one nan , on the other, that an effort is being made to modernize the Army and ioun Air Force.f 4 (C23593) 132 The first, a palliative (increased and wider spread subsidies), is a heavy drain not to be tolerated for long; the last (the Air Force) is still in th? planning stage, and is hardly likely to take useful shape for two years. There remains the Army The very active Minister of Finance has this year been made also Assistant Minister of Defence, evidently with a view to putting life into the feeble gendarmery corps of the Hejaz which is called the “Army ’’ He has already established, confining his activities to the Hejaz (а) A recruiting system. (б) A cadet college for officers. , M . It ifinterestingto note in his regulations on the latter, that students failing the first year s examination become immediately private soldiers, those failing in the second year become warrant or non-commissioned officers, and only those passing the final year examination become 2nd Lieutenants. The rules and regulations for recruiting and the cadet college are available and are less than elementary, further, the officers to organise either are entirely lacking except in name. A Javanese, a Turk employed by King Hussain and never an efficient officer, and other similar and completely uninstructed persons are all that is available. The Ministry of Defence, further, has endeavoured to disband the camel corps (1,200 men) and reform it into two cavalry regiments (400 each, to be stationed at JMecca and Medina) and an armed car regiment. They were to be put in uniform. This ended in mutiny and desertion. Numbers of the men had come voluntarily to Riyadh in this July (1935) to complain to the King. Some others had shown signs of going back to duty, but the reorganization up to mid-July was a failure. This is enough to show the tendency to modernization of the Army, which has been forced upon Ibn Sa’ud by the failure of the morale of his Wahhabis and which, on the contrary, would not have been tolerated by them had their morale remained. Religious fervour is to be replaced by a disciplined army. The start of this change is, so far, unpropitious. It looks as if a couple of years of poorly attended pilgrimage with con sequently low coffers, would be enough to bring on a marked decline in the Sa’udi Arab state, but fortunately, as the King's Secretary pointed out to me, there is a bright spot in the financial sky, and that is the Standard Oil Company (Arabia-Californian) which, it is reported, has already reached oil in one boring in Hasa. Conclusion 1. Mining royalties, and subsidies received from concession hunters, may enable Ibn Sa’ud to pay his soldiers regularly and achieve the formation of a “ disciplined ’’ force from among his fickle, but gold-loving, subjects. If not, he will need all the astuteness that is his to keep together his widespread kingdom when he is next put to the test, since extreme Wahhabism, military and fanatical, a binding, driving force, is out of the picture. Prejudice, ignorance, and puritanism remain alive, but are no longer organized. 2. Thus we now have the spectacle of Ibn Sa'ud at the end of his Wahhabi phase and the beginning of the ' modern ” phase of his reign, although general religious consideration, Ibn Sa’ud’s innate political caution, slender resources, lingering Nejd puritanism, a genuine fear of European penetration and the fickleness of his subjects will all tend to slow up the process and induce Ibn Sa’ud and his advisers to conceal the true state of affairs and withstand a rapid opening up of the country. “ Modernization ” is to be strictly controlled to the advantage of the King and not for that of outsiders more than can be helped.—a 133 APPENDIX V NOTE ON ZAKAT {See Chapter II.) In its primitive sense, the word “zakat” means purification. Whence, it is also used to express a portion of property bestowed in alms, as a sanctifica tion of the remainder to the proprietor. It is an institution of Islam and founded upon an express command in the Koran {vide Surah ii.77), being one of the five foundations of practical religion. It is a religious duty incumbent upon any person who is free, sane, adult, and a Moslem, provided he be possessed in full property of such estate or effects as are termed in the language of the law “ nisab,” and that he has been in possession of the same for the space of one complete year. The “ nisab,' or fixed amount of property upon which zakat is due, varies with reference to the different kinds of property in possession, as will be seen in the present note. The one complete year, in which the property is held in possession, is termed “ haulu ’1-haul.” Zakat is not incumbent upon a man against whom there are debts equal to or exceeding the amount of his whole property, nor is it due upon the necessaries of life, such as dwelling-houses, or articles of clothing, or household furniture, or cattle kept for immediate use, or slaves employed as actual servants, or armour and weapons designed for present use, or upon books of science and theology used by scholars, or upon tools used by craftsmen. (1) The zakat of camels. Zakat is not due upon less than five camels, and upon five camels it is one goat or sheep, provided that they subsist upon pasture, throughout the year, because zakat is only due upon such camels as live on pasture, and not upon those which are fed in the home with forage. One goat is due upon any number of camels from five to nine ; two goats for any number of camels from ten to fourteen ; three goats for any number from twenty to twenty-four. Upon any number of camels from twenty-five to thirty-five the zakat is a ” bint mikhaz,” or a yearling female camel; from thirty-six to forty-five, a “ bintu labun,” or a two-year-old female camel; from forty-six to sixty, a “ hiqqah,” or a three-year-old female camel; from sixty-one to seventy-five, a ” jaz’ah,” or four-year-old female camel; from seventy-five to ninety, two camels’ female two-year-old colts; and from ninety-one to one hundred and twenty, two camels’ female three-year-old colts. When the number of camels exceeds one hundred and twenty, the zakat is calculated by the aforesaid rule. (2) The zakat of bulls, cows, and buffaloes. No zakat is due upon fewer than thirty cattle, and upon thirty cattle which feed on pasture for the greater part of the year, there is due at the end of the year a “ tabi’ah,” or one-year-old calf ; and upon forty is due a “ musim,” or a calf of two years old ; and where the number exceeds forty, the zakat is to be calculated according to this rule. For example, upon sixty, the zakat is two yearling calves ; upon seventy, one tabi’ah and one musim ; upon eighty, two musims ; upon ninety, three tabi’ahs ; upon one hundred, two tabi’ahs and one musim ; and thus upon every ten head of cattle a musim and a tabi’ah alternately. Thus, upon one hundred and ten kine, the zakat is two musims and one tabi’ah ; and134 t. J A fwpn+v four tabi’ahs. The usual method, however, of cSattagThe zakat upon terge herds of cattle is by dividing them into S'rties and forties, imposing upon every thirty, one tab. ah. or upon every forty, one musim. (3) Zakat upon sheep and goals. No zakat is due upon less than forty »hich have fed the greater part of the year upon pasture upon which is due one goat until the number reaches one hundred and twenty ; for one hundred and twenty-one to two hundred, it is two goats or sheep ; and above this, one for everv hundred. The same rules apply to both sheep and goats, because in^he Traditions, the original word “ ghanam applies to both species. &lt;41 Zakat upon horses. When horses and mares are kept indiscriminately 4 - feeding for the greater part of the year on pasture, it is the option ofC moprietor to give? zakat of one dinar per head for the whole, or to appreciate the whole and give 5 per cent, upon the total value. No zakat whatever is due upon droves of horses consisting entirely of males, or entirely of mares There is no zakat due upon horses or mules, unless they are articles of merchandise, nor is it due upon war horses, or upon beasts of burden, or upon cattle kept for drawing ploughs, and so forth. (5) Zakat upon silver. It is not due upon silver of less value than two hundred dirhams, but if one be possessed of this sum for a whole year, the zakat due upon it is five dirhams. No zakat is due upon an excess above the two hundred dirhams till such excess amount to forty, upon which the zakat is one dirham, and for every succeeding forty, one dirham. Those dirhams in which silver predominates are to be accounted silver, and the laws respecting silver apply to them, although they should contain some alloy , and the same rule holds with regard to all articles falling under the denomination of plate, such as cups and goblets. iq) Zakat upon gold. No zakat is due upon gold under the value of twenty mithqals, and the zakat due upon twenty mithqals is half a naithqal. Whe/the quantity of gold exceeds twenty mithqals, on every four mithqals above twenty are due two qirats, and so on in proportion. Zakat is due upon gold and silver bullion, and upon all gold and silver ornaments and utensils. (7) Zakat upon articles of merchandise. Articles of merchandise should be appraised, and a zakat of 2J per cent, paid upon the value, if it exceeds two hundred dirhams in value. (8) Zakat upon mines, or buried treasures. Mines of gold, silver, iron, lead, or copper are subject to a zakat of one-fifth (khums) ; but if the m discovered within the precincts of a person’s own home, nothing is ^ ue - ; . if a person find a deposit of buried treasure, a fifth is due upon it. No zaKat due upon precious stones. (9) Zakat upon the fruits of the earth. Upon everything produced from the ground there is a tenth (’ashir or ’ushr), whether the soil be watere y overflow of rivers or by periodical rains, excepting the articles o - bamboo, and grass, which are not subject to the tithe Land wa .- th y means of buckets, or machinery, or watering camels, is subject to a tw Honey and fruits collected in the wilderness are subject to tithe. The zakat is received by a collector, duly appointed for the P ur P° se ^ although it is lawful for the possessor to distribute his alms ™ se , he person comes to the collector, and make a declaration on oatn a amount of his property upon which zakat is due, his statemen i credited.There are seven descriptions of persons upon whom zakat may be bestowed :— (1) Faqirs, or persons possessed of property the whole of which, however, does not amount to a nisab. (2) Miskins, or persons who have no property whatever. (3) The collector of zakat. (4) Slaves. (5) Debtors. (6) Fi Sabili llah, i.e., in the service of God, or religious warfare. (7) Travellers. The above laws with reference to zakat are those according to the Hanafiya sect, but the differences amongst the Imams of the Sunnis on this subject are but small. Ihey may be seen upon reference to Hamilton’s Translation of the Hidayah, vol. I, p. 1.&gt; * GLOSSARY A ’Aba (pi. A’bia) : cloak. Abiar, plural of Bir : well. 'Abid, plural of 'Abd : slave, negro.

Date : —November, 1935. Map References :—Million Sheet G.39, G.38. Note .—The following report is based on notes taken during the journey of Sir Andrew Ryan from Bahrain to Riyadh, between the 20th and 23rd November, 1935. The figures for times and distances have been checked with those furnished by the American Mission Community at Bahrain and by Mr. Lenahan, of the Arabia Californian Standard Oil Company, Jedda, for the journey of Mr. Hamilton, of the same Company.142 Route Report No. 1 Part I ’UQAIR to AL HASA (by car) (Previous Route Report No. 31A and B—' Routes in Arabia,” General Staff, India, Publication, 1914.) General Two caravan routes lead westwards from the small port of Uqair to A1 Hasa. One is the shortest route which neglects water points ; the other, more suitable in the summer months, passes such water points as are conveniently situated. The car route follows nearly the latter caravan route. General direction Distance Time Surface Water Fuel Supplies Epitome South-south-west. 77 kilometres. 2 hours 20 minutes. Loose sand for greater part of distance, latter part over stony (lime-stone) plain, then through lanes among extensive palm gardens on nearing A1 Hasa. Plentiful at village of Jisha. Abundant at Jisha and eastward, scanty westward. Limited quantities of petrol, sugar, rice, ghi, grain, fruits, and meat at A1 Hasa. Very limited supplies of fruit and vegetables at Jisha. Detail ’Ujair (written Arabic ’Uqair), anciently Gerrha or Carrhae, seat of an Amir (administrative official). Lat. 25° 28' 30', Long. 50° 13' 33'. Popula tion, 500. The headland of Ras al Hadd protects the harbour and ships at the quay ; gravel 25 yards by 35 yards ; depth of water at quayside reputed to be 15 ft.; boat passage, commencement of which is marked by a stick off the headland, is confined and difficult, requiring a pilot. The Customs sheds stand on the side of the quay ; floor space approxi mately 175 ft. by 100 ft. 150 yards from the quayside stands the only other building of note in ’Uqair: the Turkish-built fort which contains the office of the Amir, the Customs Officer (Mudir al Qumruk), and numerous store rooms. It is about 150 yards long and 80 yards broad, of baked brick and rubble, the latter apparently represents later repairs. The Customs Office is above the main gate in the eastern face, the Amir’s office in the southern wall. There are a few ill-provided shops in the face of the fort. Customs dues are usually paid in rupees. An estimate of normal annual receipts from the ’Uqair Customs is Rs..9 Lacs. Goods come mostly from India, often via Bahrain. Custom duty 8 per cent, ad valorem, as fixed in the Koran. From ’Uqair, caravan routes into the interior and two car routes, one to Al Hasa and the second to Al Khobar (oil field port) and on to Al Qatif, diverge. Tribes in the neighbourhood are—southward, the Al Murra and Manasir , northward, the Ajman and Awazim ; and westward, the Bani Hajir.143 Route Report No. 1 Baggage animals : camels, and the famous white ass of Hasa, known as Hasawi far and wide, and perhaps the descendant of the wild asses of Arabia mentioned by early geographers. Asses are purchasable at about 75 dollars (Maria Theresa) and baggage camels at about 3 gold pounds. \ illage of wattle huts, 150 yards north of Fort, marks the site of well from which inhabitants draw their water. Car Route Westward across salty plain (Sabkha) to edge of sand dunes. Kilometres 2. Across sand dunes, an area of the great dunes of South Arabia. Extremely difficult going for cars even with balloon tyres. Cars frequently stick. 16. Umm-Adh-Dharr, a group of mounds, forms a well-known landmark. Sweet water can be secured at 3 ft. or 4 ft. by scratching away the sand. Some Asharr (Calotropis procera) bushes. 44. Shatar. Three small wells of brackish water, on north of car route, 2 miles. 64. Jisha, a walled, semi-fortified village of 300 houses, whose inhabitants (population 3,000) cultivate dates: stony (limestone) plain, extending to 4 kilometres east of village, marks end of sandy going. Very limited supplies : water from wells. Market day on Mondays, when dates, oranges, lemons, lucerne, various vegetables and palm fibre are for sale. Jisha is beginning of Hasa oasis. 68 . Immediately south of track, walled, semi-fortified village of Jafar (population 1,500). Numerous settlements and gardens and the A1 Hasa oasis onwards to town of A1 Hasa. Among the gardens is that of Mardhiyya, Crown property formerly belonging to the Sultan of Turkey. 77. A l Hasa (sometimes, but less and less often, known as Hofuf), seat of the Amir of the A1 Hasa provinces, the greater part of the eastern side of the Sa’udi Arab Kingdom. The Amirate is at present in the hands of the Ibn Jaluwi family, descendants of Jaluwi, brother of the King Abdul Aziz’s grandfather. Present Amir (1935), Saud Ibn 'Abdullah al Jaluwi. Lat. 25° 22' 53', Long. 49° 29' 39'. Height in feet, 457. Population of whole oasis about 30,000. The Al Hasa oases exist on the water, tepid and sulphurous, which springs from numerous faults in the limestone plain and resemble the oases existing in similar formation on the western flank of the Mesopotamian Plain. Several of the pools are very deep, and the water, clear and green in spite of its underground origin, contains some small fish. The streams conducted from these pools are all used up in cultivation. The city is walled, its buildings being made of white sandstone blocks faced with sandstone mortar, and the better class houses having interior decoration in limestone and painted doors. The military buildings, the Kut or Citadel, the walls of the city, the Mubarriz, Khizam and Kuhairis forts outside the city as well as the fortification of some of the oasis villages, date from the Turkish occupation.144 Route Report No. 1 The Amir’s private residence, quarters for his guests, apartments for Government business, barracks and stores, are all inside the Kut or Citadel. It is surrounded by a bastioned high wall of mud bricks, with round towers at intervals and the remains of a dry moat. The garrison numbers about 200. Market day is on Thursdays, and is held in the Great Market below the walls of the Kut Dates, rice, oranges from mid-November onwards, lemons, palm fibre mats and other by-products of the date-palm, meat and vegetables, are the most noticeable articles for sale. Part II AL HASA to AR RIYADH (by car) (Previous Route Report No. 30, Alternative B, Lieut-Colonel Pelly, “ Routes in Arabia,” General Staff, India, 1914.) General To avoid the difficult going for cars by or near the more usual caravan route to Ar Riyadh westward from A1 Hasa, the car route takes a north- westerly direction to near the Jabal Juda, then westwards across the Dahana sand belt to near the Wells of Ar Ramah and Ar Rumaihiya, and subsequently southwards into Ar Riyadh. Water is scanty except at A1 ’ Uraira, and after Ar Ramah and Ar Rumaihiya. The going is extremely bad, the track little used, and, in sand areas, often ill-defined although clearer than the route Kuwait-Riyadh and having more water points. Between these two routes from the eastern shore of the Persian Gulf to Riyadh there is little to choose. The Kuwait route is rather better going, less frequented, has no con siderable settlements, and is entirely waterless from Ar Ramah to Janyat al Ilya (see Route Report for detail). General direction . . Distance Time Surface Water Fuel.. Supplies Epitome Westwards, through a curve north-west, west, south-south-west. 520 kilometres. Driving hours, minimum 14 hours 15 minutes, fast tourer. Average time taken for whole journey for party of cars, tourers, and baggage lorries mixed, is two nights and greater part of three days. A lengthy train of baggage lorries would require four nights and four days. Average running speed of a tourer is 30 kilometres per hour from Al Hasa to Ar Ramah, and 40 kilo metres an hour from Ar Ramah to Ar Riyadh. This is on the high side and indicates a certain disregard of jolts and discomfort for passengers. Extremely indifferent. Frequent loose sand and rough surface. At certain points it is quicker and more comfortable for passengers to get out and walk. The crossing of the Dahana sand belt is no worse than the crossing of numerous sandy wadis and depressions further east. Best water points : Ain Najim, Al Uraira, Ar Ramah. . Abundant except in the Summan Plain. detail in report below.

Authority :—Captain G. de Gaury, M.C., Air Ministry. Date : —December, 1935. Map References :—Million Sheet G.38, F.38, F.37. Note—The following report is based on notes taken during the journey of Sir Andrew Ryan between the 29th November and 3rd December, 1935. It should be mentioned that the road, or rather track, was then at its best, the sands damped and compact after rain. The figures for times and distance have been checked with figures furmshe by Mr. C Gusman, Pro Consul to the British Legation, who took not^ on way up to meet the Minister in Riyadh, and those furnished by Mr. Lenahan of the Arabia Californian Standard Oil Company, Jedda, for the journey of Mr. Hamilton, of that Company, early this year.149 Route Report No. 2 Part I From Riyadh (the Badia Palace in the Wadi Hanifa, summer residence of H.M. King Abdul Aziz) to Wadi Fatima (near Jedda) by car. (Previous Report Route No. 40, Authy. C. M. Doughty, 1878, “ Routes in Arabia,” General Staff, India, 1914.) General The route is concerned to avoid on the one hand long waterless stages, and on the other, certain areas of ‘‘ Harra, or volcanic debris which, in its most westerly half, border it on the north. Furthermore, it is not everywhere easy to pass through the mountain range of the Jabal Tuwaiq. For these reasons the track leaves Riyadh in north-north-west direction, goes west for a long distance, and finally turns south-west to Jedda, but making, for political reasons, a detour sometimes already called Darb An Nasara, or the Christians’ route. (Note .—The latter is described here in particular detail as it does not appear on any maps, while as far as Sharaya I have been con cerned only to give an outline, supplementary to my own journal between the 28th June and 1st July describing the same road and to the maps (“ Routes in Arabia ”) of Mr. Philby.) Epitome General direction .. West (first north-north-west, then west, then south west, finally west). Distance .. .. 1,077 kilometres. Time .. .. 5 days. Surface .. .. Hard limestone desert and mountain, with sandy areas as far as a point 11 kilometres east of Duwadmi, when it changes to granite with sandy areas, on to which, especially in the neighbour hood of Qaiiya, there encroaches basalt from the fields of basalt rock bordering the track at various points from here westward along its northern side. Subsequently, dangerous descents through the torturous valleys of the Hejaz Mountains, i.e., from Ashaira to Sharaya (Shariya on Philby’s “ Routes in Arabia ”) ; thence low, stony hills and irrigated areas in the Wadi Fatima ; finally the soft coastal plain (Tihama) into Jedda. Sudden spates in the Hejaz valleys and heavy rains elsewhere are liable to interrupt communications.150 Route Report No. 2 Epitome— continued Water Fuel Supplies Plentiful at—Jubaila, Marat, Duwadmi, Afif, Muwaih, Ashaira, Zaima, Sharaya, Jara’ana, Wadi Fatima, Wazariya, Jedda.

Consists in reality of two palaces—the Old Palace used formerly as a guest-house and_summer palace for the King, the New Palace, completed 22nd November, 1935, used as a guest-house. Both two-storied buildings, 50 yards apart (the New Palace to the north of the Old on the west (right) bank of the Wadi Hanifa). The buildings are of pise de terre, with few exterior windows, except in New Palace. Interior decoration on walls and the facing of the pillars and balustrades in courtyards are in lime. Gardens, irrigated from wells (60 ft.) by rope and bucket over derrick pulled by donkeys, contain date palms, pomegranates, apricots, and lucerne. Goats graze in and round the gardens. On the east bank, a little south of the Palace, is a village of 15 houses and, a little north, a garden with lodge. The road to Riyadh passes between the latter two and is accompanied by the telephone line to the city. The wadi is about 50 yards broad ; a white, shingly bottom; dry except after heavy rain. Distance. Kilometres 9. The track passes over a stony, quite barren plain round the west and north-west of Riyadh until near the wells west of the house of Nura, wife of Saud A1 Arafa and sister of the King, which stands in gardens outside the city wall. Here it joins tracks from the Dhumairi and Shamsiya gates, and, leaving the Kuwait and Hasa road at a slight angle on its north, after a few hundred yards (there are numerous alternative tracks about here) takes its own way north-westward across a plain of calcareous limestone. 11 11. On the north is the curious hole in one of the hillocks overlooking Riyadh, known as al Makhrouq, a summer resting place and view point for members of the Royal family. On the south, at some distance, is a' line of dark palms marking the bottom of the Wadi Hanifa, which, however, is soon lost to sight behind the undulations of the plain.151 Route Report No. 2 Kilometres 23 6S i rm the north of a track to Banban, a A avoiding Riyadh. 9^ A possible good landing ground. .

Authority :—Air Ministry (on information published by the Governments of ’Iraq and Sa’udi Arabia). Date : —January, 1936. Map references :—Million Sheet H.38, G.38 and G.39. Epitome 1. General The route is of ancient origin. It commences at Najaf (H.38 a.v.) (for description of route within ’Iraq’s borders see Routes in ’Iraq), and, except for occasional divergencies, follows the Darb Zubaida, a road which was cleared for the passage of pilgrims in the 8th century a.d. by order of the Empress Zubaida, consort of Haroun al Rashid. Distances between wells were too great to be traversed on foot without undue hardship, and in order to provide water for the pilgrims, storage tanks of dressed stone (Ar. Birka’ ; plural, Burak or Burach) were therefore constructed along its northern section at intervals of 10-15 miles. Thus, by the nomads who frequent the area, the route is often called Darb al Burach. In collaboration with the Government of Sa’udi Arabia, the Iraq authorities decided, in 1934, to inspect the route and take any steps necessary to improve it with a view to facilitating the passage of pilgrim traffic from 'Iraq to Mecca and Medina. Throughout its length it is a desert route, and most of the area through which it passes is inhabited only by nomad Bedouin. Six tiny hamlets and the town of Hail, administrative headquarters of the Jabal Shammar district, with a population of perhaps 5,000, are the only permanently established centres through which the track leads. Few of the amenities of civilization are therefore to be met with en route; supplies, etc., must be carried, also fuel, though, in places, scrub is fairly plentiful. The route can by no means be said to be passable for all arrns. For 175 kilometres from the ’Iraq border the surface of the des ^. ls f ^ with occasional rocks. This presents no difficulty or mec ai , sand but for the next 200 kilometres strips or “ veins of more or less hea^sand are encountered (Irq = vein). Between these “ veins, the widest of whmh is some 63 kilometres across, run strips of rocky loam or gravel, varying width from 2 to 50 kilometres.

The normal time taken to cover the route at present is five days, but after improvements have been made it is expected that cars will complete the journey in three days. 2. Water Details of the masonry tanks along the route northwards from Jumaima to Najaf are to be found in the handbook of the Southern Desert of ’Iraq. At present they are all in a state of complete dilapidation, but were originally carefully sited to collect rainwater from the surrounding country, and, if the proposed improvements are carried out by the ’Iraq Government, would hold very considerable quantities of water. As an example, the tank at Jumaima was estimated by Leachman to contain water for 12,000 men for several days, in the winter of 1910. A list of watering points between Jumaima and Medina is given hereunder— Distance from Jumaima. Name of watering point. Description. Kilometres. — Jumaima. .

None of the water obtainable en route is drinkable by Europeans without previous purification. Drinking troughs for animals form part of the construction of most of the reservoirs. 3. Supplies Apart from small quantities of poor quality fuel [see para. 4), supplies are only obtainable at the towns of Hail and Medina, and then only in limited amount. At each of these towns, mutton and dates (both plentiful), soft fruit and vegetables in season, may be obtained. No estimate of the quantities likely to be available is possible. All other foodstuffs are imported by the inhabitants and are sufficient only for their own use. 4. Fuel Scrub abounds in patches along the route. At Hail and Medina, palm logs and fronds, a poor form of fuel, are plentiful, and may also be obtained in small quantities at the villages of Buq’a, Ghazala, Hahfa and Hanakiya^ the sandy stretches there is little scrub but considerable quantities of “ Ghadha ” (tamarisk), a very satisfactory fuel. 5 Grazi n g Dependent entirely on rainfall. From December to March (inclusive) grazing for camels is unlimited especially in the sandy areas where the tall succulent grasses (nussi) afford excellent fodder. For horses, limited at all times of the year and in summer and autumn, ni. 6. Obstacles Apart from the long stretches of sand mentioned in para. 1, there are no obstacles. 7. Camping and landing grounds Space is unlimited throughout and sites are dictated only by proximity to water.162 Route Report No. 3 8. Tactical 9. Inhabitants Within the confines of ’Iraq the route traverses the winter and spring pastures of the semi-nomad tribes of ’Iraq, the Bani Huchaim confederation, the Bani Salama, Chabsha, Shibl and Ghazalat. They are well armed, though for lack of means of transport they have not the mobility of the Bedouin. With the approach of summer these shepherds withdraw to the riverain districts, leaving the desert area almost totally devoid of inhabitants. Their attitude depends to a large extent on the measure of control exercised over them in their summer grazing grounds. Across the frontier, as far as and beyond Hail, roam the Sinjara and Abda, nomad divisions of the great Shammar tribe. Many settled, or semi-settled, members of this tribe are to be found in the villages of Jabal Shammar through which the route passes. In general, their attitude is friendly towards the British. Beyond Hail, the few scattered villages touched by the route are inhabited by herdsmen and agriculturalists of the Shammar, Anaiza, Hutaim and Bani Tamim tribes, whilst nearer Medina the route enters the tribal area of the southern Harb. Firm control is at present exercised by Ibn Sa’ud and his Government throughout his dominion. It is impossible to define the attitude of the tribes were this control removed. 10. Additional Work Improvements are being undertaken by the Sa’udi Arab Government (1936) at essential points. The provision of a track passable for all arms across the sandy stretches would be a work of some magnitude. If the reservoirs along the early stages of the route are to be relied upon they would require to be excavated and repaired. 11. Transpon The estimated total number of cars in the whole country (Sa’udi Arabia) in 1935 was— Motor buses (9-18-passenger capacity) .. .. 500 Lorries .. .. .. .. .. .. ., 200 Passenger cars (tourers) .. .. .. .. 1,000 Of these a small proportion would be available at Hail and Medina. Elsewhere on the route no transport is available other than camels, and these it would be necessary to commandeer as the Bedouin is generally averse to hiring out his baggage camels. Numbers to be obtained would depend on the proximity or otherwise of Bedouin camps, i.e., on the grazing available in the vicinity of the route. 12. Rains and Floods Rainy season, November to March. No part of the route is liable to flood. 13. Alternative Routes Until the sand is encountered, detours may be made at almost any point, if desired, but beyond Hail and Jabal Shammar, less frequently. 14. Climate Climatic conditions are those of a sub-tropical area and are of a semi-arid type. The diurnal range of temperature is very great and the intense dryness mitigates the heat by day whilst ensuring cool nights. In winter, Hail, at an altitude of 4,000 ft., experiences sharp frosts. The rainfall of Jabal Shammar is somewhat below that of the Egyptian delta.163 ROUTE RECONNAISSANCE REPORT No. 4 RIYADH to KUWAIT 1 otal distance : —390 miles (approximately). Authority : —Captain G. de Gaury. Date : —July, 1935. Map references .—Million Sheet G.38 and H.38. Epitome 1. General I he route is a desert track and touches no habitation throughout its length with the exception of the tiny hamlet of Jaryat al Ilya. It leaves Riyadh by the 1 hamairi Gate in a northerly direction over a hard gravel surface, passing among low broken hills. Going is rough at first, but improves somewhat when approaching the Arma plateau. Foot of the Arma Plateau. —A very steep ascent of some 500 ft. begins. The road has here been partly improved by cutting into the side of the hill and piling up the stones removed, on the outer edge of the road. The track curls up and over a col, which makes the only possible ascent for a car, within sight. The last few yards of the ascent to the shelf of the plateau is very steep—possibly 1 in 3 for 10 yards. Thamama. —Numerous, deep, unlined water holes which tend to dry up in late summer. In spring, the water is plentiful and sv/eet. After leaving Thamama, going is rough and the track is indistinct. Rumaihiya. —Nine stone-lined wells, about 50 ft. deep. Ramah. —Six stone-lined wells, some 400 yards south of the track. Dahana Sands. —A short distance beyond Ramah, the edge of the Dahana sands is reached, and going is very rough, through soft sand. The latter occurs in strips or “ veins ” several miles in width between which are patches of more or less hard ground. The track disappears and a guide is necessary for the crossing of the Dahana sands, which takes approximately 3|- hours by car. Beyond the Dahana is the Summan, hard rolling desert, on which the track becomes evident again. Wabra. —Before reaching Jaryat al Ilya, the wells of Wabra are passed some 10 miles to the west of the route. Ihese consist of a clustei of shallow water holes 6-12 ft. deep. The water is said to be drinkable though very bitter. Jaryat al Ilya.—A small village standing in a sandy bottom, m contrast to the hard rolling desert of the Summan. Its mud walls are -0 it. high and the village some 500 ft. across. Inhabitants are of the Mutair tribe, Ilwa section. Aircraft of the Standard Oil Company (Arabia-Californian) have landed some 2 miles from the village on G** (C 23593)164 Route Report No. 4 the north side, though the ground roundabout is rough and inter sected by petty rain courses running down between hummocks into the Jarya valley. Sparse cultivation surrounds the village. Water is obtained from many shallow wells, 6-15 ft. deep. Al Qara’ —About 5 miles beyond Jarya, the route enters A1 Qara li.e., “ bald ”), a tract of hard, flat and featureless country which extends as far as the Kuwait frontier. 1 aking a north-easterly direction the route passes the pools of Khabari Wadth-ha (dry in summer), and joins the Shaq depression some 8 miles west of Minaqish hill. Thence it follows the Shaq for some distance, passes to the west of Dhallat adh Dhaba and reaches Kuwait via the wells of Chidadiya. It is calculated by Arab drivers to be 5£ to 6 hours running time from Jarya to Kuwait. 2 ft ter The only permanent water along the route is at J ary at al Ilya, Ramah and Rumaihiya In winter and spring, after satisfactory rains, water is usually to be found at Chidadiya, Thamilat Turki (near Minaqish), Khabari Wadth-ha, and at many places in the vicinity of Riyadh. 3. Supplies Nil. 4. Fuel Fair quantities of scrub are available in patches, though long stretches of the route are almost totally devoid of vegetation. 5. Grazing See para. 4 above. Grazing is dependent on rainfall; if this has been good, grazingffor camels only, is usually satisfactory during the winter months. 6. Camping and Landing Grounds (a) Camping sites are unlimited at all stages and are only dictated by considerations of water and fuel. (b) Landing grounds would be difficult to site in the country between Riyadh and the Arma plateau owing to the broken nature of the country. In the Dahana also it is extremely improbable that a landing ground could be selected. The Summan is hard, rolling desert, but is perhaps too rolling for landing grounds to be found with ease. Landings may be made almost anywhere in the Qara’ tract though parts of its surface are apt to be somewhat soft. The area between the Sa’udi Arabian frontier and Kuwait also includes numerous sandy patches, but landing grounds might be selected here without difficulty. 7. Inhabitants The nomad tribes who frequent the vicinity of the track are the Subai and Suhul, between Riyadh and Rumaihiya, where their territory fringes that of the Ajman. Northwards of the Dahana the route lies through the Mutair grazing grounds, whilst the Fidawiya and Araibdar of Kuwait occupy the area within the Kuwait border. The latter own allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait The attitude of the Subai, Suhul and Mutair depends entirely on the amount of influence and control exercised by the ruler of Sa’udi Arabia. 8. Rains and Floods No part of the route is liable to be flooded, nor do rains, which may be expected between December and March, render it anywhere impassable. Heavy rains have the eftect of hardening the sand and thus facilitating some what the passage of the Dahana.INDEX Note .—Arabic proper names are sometimes preceded by the definite article A1 (also transliterated Ad, An, As, etc.).

Distance Date of Reconnaissance Map Reference— Sheets Basra and Jauf Sketch map (at end of this report) 1,015 miles. January, 1939. Scale 1.100,000. „ 1.400.000. GENERAL REPORT The Route 1. The route is merely a wheel track across the deserts made by the lorries of the garrisons of the six Sa’udi frontier forts along the northern frontier of Sa'udi Arabia. It is the lateral road of communication for the frontier posts. Divergence from the track can be made at any point, as far as is likely to be desired, anywhere along its whole length, except at two points :— (a) The steep ascent out of the Skaka valley 25 miles west- north-west of Skaka; and {b) The descent 2 miles east of Kaf into the Kaf valley. The whole length of the route is suitable for the heaviest kind of transport except at {a) above where the roughly levelled surface of stones would give way on the outer side of the track. The surface of the desert from Umm Rudhuma to the Trans-Jordan frontier is almost uniformly stony, making, the more it is used, a fine natural surface. At the crossing of the Wadi az Zatri and between the Wadi al Kharr and Wadi Abu Rowath the stones become large, averaging 3 inches high, and give a very rough ride to small cars. Elsewhere small stones make a fine gravelly surface, noticeably between Skaka and Kaf along the featureless Hamd downs, where for long distances speeding is unlimited. The only steep gradient is for 100 yards, at the point (a) already mentioned above, where for 10 yards it is 1 in 3.Route Report No. 5 166 .lu 4- r,T7 Knttm-ns of the wadis spates following immedi- f min'^Tbetween October and April, would not interfere ately after rain, i.e., ix while the wa( n is actually with traffic for more u &lt; occurrence ’ By no means every wadi running at full spate a 0 d h rain being usually light and runs every year, or to th l™™* e V™ moTe than 6 inches per year patchy, and averaging pr ) y mo re than 3 feet deep (Kuwait average rainfall is 4 mcties). ^p would be unusual.

(a) East of Jahra village, in close vicinity to it, are patches of “ sabkha ” salty mud flat, which in winter, after rain, is avoided by taking a plainly discernible track on a slightly more southerly course, round the mudflats. The Jal az Zor ridge dominates the anchorage of Ras Kadhama and makes an interesting tactical feature. An A.2 track runs from Ras Kadhama to Jahra, where it joins the track under report, its course being the shore beneath the Zor ridge. (b) As the track rises to surmount the Jal az Zor ridge there are occasional sand filled, small watercourses which require change of gear if approached at low speed. (c) Heavy lorry traffic used the track for several months in all weathers in 1938, going from Kuwait to the Oil Company’s Camp then at Ghalola, without difficulty; a sufficient proof of its practicability as an A.l route. (d) Brushwood everywhere plentiful. No water. \e) Slow-landing aircraft might make a safe landing in many places, but very small water courses and small hummocky bushes are frequent in this desert country. No plainly suitable sites for landing grounds except at Jahra, immediately south-east of fort on east side of village. f 23 57 63 43 A.l 100 A.l 163 A.l An excellent hard surface—two small stony water courses at Riqai present no difficulty even when in spate.
