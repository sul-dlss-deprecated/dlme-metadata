I am directed to inform you that a number of cases have occurred recently in which officer*^ have incurred new exnendi- ture or expenditure in excess of sane* ed grants without obtaining the previous sanction of the ^ovet^gnent of India, although there was no urgency in the matter. It is particularly desirable at the present tim^ of finan cial stringency that no new expenditure or expenditure inVxcess of sanctioned grants should be incurred unless proner authority is obtained beforehand exceot in cases of extreme urgency. I sun therefore to request that the necessity for obtaining sanction before expenditure is incurred may be impressed on all officers. Ho. Cj P.A. Mascat. P.A. Bahrain. P.A. Kuwait.

The Political Resident desires to invite the earnest attention of all Political Officers serving under him to the g-eat need of economizing in the matter of telegraph' expenditure which he is inclined to think is rather heavier than is necessary. And he appeals to all office to consider very carefully in every case before a telegri is sent whether it is absolutely essential that the com munication should be telegraphed rather than sent by cost. In particular, he has noticed one or two cases recently of telegrams sent iX Government expense when not only would a letter have done equally well, but the interests of private Individuals or trading concerns rather than of Government were served. (A case in point _ support wherever possible; but the cost of telegrams despatched in those interests ought certainly, in Colonel Knox*s opinion, to be defrayed by the individual or fim concerned; and if in urgent cases the cost is borne in the first place by Government, it should be recovered and credited to Government as soon as possible.

Commencing with the budget estimates for 1922. S3, the combined grant will be shown in the ushire Residency Budget. As under this arrangement the responsibility for watching that the expenditure is keot within the sanctioned- grant will rest with you, all correspondence relating to expenditure for this grant will be addressed to you in future. It is nresuned that you will communicate to each o-’floe the limit up to which he may incur exnenditure on this account and take necessary steps to keep yburself informed of the progress of expenditure incurred under this head in each post from time to tine.

The Secretary is, ex-officio, in general charge, and the Treasury Officer, Bushire, is in immediate executive charge of the Treasury. Thus, there is no question of delegation of power by the Political Resident to either officer. 3. The position at Bahrain is not analogous, the Political Agent being in sole charge of the Treasury. The solution to the difficulties pointed out in Worth’s letter appears to lie in the application of the provisions of Article 260, Civil Account Code Vol.ligand Article 19 (1) and (2) Resource Manual, (Copies attached for ready refer ence).

OFFICE OF THE CONTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. The Treasury, 9th Calcutta, the &lt; 7 ^ January, 1935. To All TREASURY and SUB-TREASURY OEEICERS and AGENTS or the IMPERIAL BANK of INDIA. Sir, I have tlie honour to state that the Reserve Bank of India will commence to function with effect from the 1st April 1935, and will, as from that date, take over the management of the Government Account from the Imperial Bank of India. The Reserve Bank will have five offices of the Banking Department, namely, at Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Rangoon, w r hich will take over the conduct of Government treasury business at those places ff ora Imperial Bank of India. At other places where branches of the Imperial of India do the Government treasury business at present, the Reserve Bank will employ the Imperial Bank of India as its agent for the conduct of such business. 2. In addition to the five places mentioned above, the Reserve Bank will also maintain agencies of its Banking Department at the Currency Offices at Cawnpore, Lahore and Karachi. It should be noted that these agencies will deal only with the limited classes of transactions referred to in paragraphs 4 (h), 4(iii) and 4(iv) below. The ordinary work connected with the receipts and dis bursements on Government Account will continue to be dealt with by the branches of the Imperial Bank of India at these three places. 3. In places where there is no branch of the Imperial Bank of India, Govern ment treasuries will continue to do the work in the same manner as at present, subject to the minor modifications. indicated in subsequent paragraphs of this letter. Is should be noted that the duties of Treasury Officers will be practi cally the same as at present and that matters, such as the management of the currency chest transactions, issue and payment of remittance transfer receipts, supply bills and currency telegraphic transfers, handling of currency remittances, indents for replenishing currency chests, etc., in fact all matters connected with resource and remittance, will be carried out in exactly the same way as at present, the only difference being that as the posts of the Deputy Controllers of the Currency wdll be abolished from the 1st April 1935 and as the Currency Offices in the various circles wall have come under the control of the Reserve Bank from that date, all communications, statements, returns, etc., w r hich are ordinarily sent to the Deputy Controller of the Currency w ill in future be addressed to the Currency Officer of the Circle wdthin which the treasury is situated. In other words, so far as the treasuries and branches of the Imperial Bank of India doing Govern ment business are concerned, the Currency Officer who will be an officer of the Reserve Bank, will take the place of the Deputy Controller of the Currency for all purposes not specifically mentioned in this letter. It should also be noted that orders hitherto issued by the Deputy Controller of the Currency will m future be issued bv the Currency Officer concerned except to the extent mentioned m the following paragraphs, and that all sanctions given or orders issued by a Deputy Controller of the Currency up to the 31st March 1935 and in force on that date will continue to be in force until cancelled or modified by further instructions received from the Currency Officer, or from any other superior authority of the Reserve Bank. 4 Subject to the above general remarks, the following detailed instructions should be carefully noted by all Treasury Officers and Agents of the Imperial Bank of India :— (i) Government Account .—Government will maintain one account with the Reserve Bank for the whole of India, but each office of the Reserve Bank willmake payments on behalf of Government to any extent required irrespective of receipts. Government will keep no balance with the Imperial Bank of India but that Bank will carry on the Government treasury work in places where it now does so through its branches, except in the five places, namely, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Rangoon, where there will be offices of the Bank ing Department of the Reserve Bank. There will be no change in the detailed arrangements for receipts and disbursements of money on Government account. The existing account head ‘ Imperial Bank Deposits ’ appearing in the Trea sury accounts should be replaced w r herever it occurs by the head “ Reserve Bank Deposits.” The present method of dealing with the account will continue un changed. At the close of business on each day each branch of the Imperial Bank will send to its Central Accounts Office a statement showing its total receipts and total disbursements on account of Government on that day. Separate instructions regarding this arrangement and the method of adjustment between the Reserve Bank of India and the Imperial Bank of India will be sent to branches of the Imperial Bank of India by the Central Office of the Bank. (ii) Currency chests. —The existing currency chests at treasuries and sub treasuries will continue to be maintained as at present but will be under the control of the Reserve Bank of India, and all orders in connection with chest transactions w r ill, as indicated above, be issued in future by the Currency Officer of the circle within wdiich the chest is situated. Chest slips will be prepared as at present but the Treasury Officer should send only one copy of each chest slip to the Currency Officer. Sub-Treasury Officers should submit chest slips in duplicate to the Treasury Officer who will retain one copy and transmit the other to the Currency Officer. Opposite payments in respect of transfers to and from currency chests at treasuries and sub-treasuries in the United Provinces, the Punjab, the North West Frontier Province, Sind and British Baluchistan, which are at present effected by the Currency Officers at Cawnpore, Lahore and Karachi through the local branches of the Imperial Bank of India, will, as from the Isfc April 1935, be arranged for by the Currency Officers concerned, through the agencies of the Banking Department of the Reserve Bank maintained at those places. (iii) Remittance Transfer Receipts and/Hupply Bills.—There wilLbe no ciianw in the existing procednre for the issiu/and encashment of remittance transfer receipts and supply bills at treasuries and sub-treasuries exempt that in cases where the previous sanction of a Deputy Controller of the Outrency for the issue and encashment of a remittancp/transfeyfectfpt or supply/bill is required under the existing rules, the sanction of the 'Currency Office/within whose iurisdic- tion the treasury or sub-tre^fury is situatedWl be required. Remittance transfer receipts and supply billsdkued on IbWy, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Ran goon, will however, be ittued on the Weserve Ba4 of India in those places instead of on the Bank &lt;*&gt; India. Remittance transfer receipts and r supply bdls issue^n C/vnpore, Ag^ore and Km a chi will also be issued on the Reserve Bank a^wdUeVayab/eat the resp^tive Currency Offices where agen- l cies of the Banking Dffmrttnetfr of the Reser^ re 8 . _ D purpose. {Similarly, j/emitt and sub-treasuries Delhi, Madras and pore, L^fore and Karachi. v °f the Rescue Bank will be maintained for*this ice transfer receipts and supply bills on treasuries SU !TK by . 1 t ^ ReSerVe Bank at B °mbay, Calcutta, and by tM Currency Officers in the case of Cawn- r* r-”V'T‘ R should' be noted that in the case of supply bills issued at Cawnpye, Lahore, Karachi and Delhi, intervention of the Treasury Officer will not be 7 necessary. Cd '* ur ) r (iv) Currency telegraphic transfers.-There will also be no change in the existing procedure for the issue and encashment of telegraphic transfers at treasuries and sub-treasuries except that in cases where the previous sanction of a Deputy Controller of the Currency for their issue and encashment Ts re- quired under the existing rules the sanction of the Currency Officer withfn whose jurisdiction the treasury or sub-treasury is situated, will be reouired In the case of Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Rangoon telegranhic' transfers will be issued on the Reserve Bank at those places and in the case of Cawnpore, Lahore and Karachi direct on the Currency Officers q;°Ti telegraphic transfers at those places will be issued by the Reserve Bank or the Currency Office, as the case may be. K 0 tiie (v) Half rupees.—Under the provision of the Reserve Bank Act half cannot be kept in the Currency Reserve on or after the 1 st April 1935 . The entire3 balance of the coin held in the Currency Reserve on the morning of the 25th March should be transferred on th at date to the treasury or hank balance, as the case may be, in exchange for an equivalent amount in legal tender currency. If the treasury or bank balance does not permit this, the transfer should be reported to the Deputy Controller of the Currency or the Currency Officer or the Local Head Office or Link Branch of the Imperial Bank of India, as the case may be in order to enable that officer or the Head Office or Link Branch of the Imperial Bank of India to make the necessary opposite payment. From the 1st April 1935 onwards half rupees should be treated as small coin, and at places where there is a small coin depot, the amounts in excess of immediate requirements may be deposited in the depot in the same way as other small coin. (vi) Uncurrent coin. — “ Victoria Queen ” and “ Victoria Empress ” rupees other than those paid for at less than their face value under Article 66 of the Resource Manual should be kept in the currency chest. All other uncurrent rupees and all uncurrent small coins should continue to be kept as part of the treasury or bank balance, as the case may be. Uncurrent “ Victoria Queen ” and “ Victoria Empress ” whole rupees held as part of the currency chest balance when remitted to the Mint should be sent as a currency remittance, whereas other uncurrent coins should be remitted to the Mint as a treasury remittance, as at present, under instruc tions from the Currency Officer. (vii) Small coin depots. —There will be no change in the location or manage ment of small coin depot balances, and the branches of the Imperial Bank of India and treasuries will hold them in their custody on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank will be responsible for keeping the depots supplied wdth small coin of all denominations and indents for new supplies should be sub mitted to the Currency Officer in whose jurisdiction the depot requiring the supplies is situated. Depot transactions will continue to be accounted for as at present. (viii) The returns of silver coins, cut or broken, which are at present submitted quarterly to the Deputy Controllers of the Currency should in future be sent annually to the Controller of the Currency by all Treasury Officers in India on the 20th April each year. (ix) Minimum weights. —All work in connection with the supply of minimum weights for treasuries will in future be done by the Mint Masters, and all corres pondence in this connection should therefore be addressed to them direct. (x) Normal balance for district treasuries will be fixed by the Controller of the Currency and will be communicated by him to Treasury Officers. 5. All charges incurred in connection with the remittance of treasure will be borne by the Reserve Bank. Treasury Officers will incur the expenditure as at present and debit the amount in the treasury account with full details supported by vouchers. Separate instructions will follow indicating the head of account to which these charges should be taken in the Treasury accounts. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. W.

To All TREASURY and SUB-TREASURY OFFICERS. Sir, In continuation of my circular letter No. B. &amp; R.-44—61-34, aated the 21st January, 1935, communicating certain changes in treasury procedure which will be necessary on the inauguration of the Reserve Bank of India on the 1st April, 1935, I have the honour to advise the following additions and alterations to that letter which should be carefully noted and observed in practice. 2. The following may be substituted for paragraph 4(m) of that letter. “ (m) Remittance Transfer Receipts and Supply Bills. There will be no change in the existing procedure for issue and encashment of remittance transfer receipts and supply bills at treasuries and sub-treasuries except that {a) in cases where the previous sanction of the Deputy Controller of the Currency for the issue or encashment of a remittance transfer receipt or supply bill is required under the existing rules, the sanction of the Currency Officer within whose jurisdiction the treasury or sub-treasury is situated will be required ; (6) remittance transfer receipts and supply bills issued on Bombay, Calcutta,'Delhi, Madras and Rangoon should be issued on the Reserve Bank in those places instead of on the Imperial Bank of India, and remittance transfer receipts and supply bills on treasuries and sub-treasuries will be issued by the Reserve Bank at 'those places instead of by the Imperial Bank of India; (c) supply bills issued on Cawnpore, Lahore and Karachi should be issued on the Reserve Bank and will be payable at the currency offices where agencies of the Banking Department of the Reserve Bank will be maintained for this purpose and Supply Bills on treasuries and sub-treasuries will be issued by the Currency Offices at Cawnpore, Lahore and Karachi. This does not apply to remittance transfer receipts which will be issued by or made payable at the Imperial Bank of India, Cawnpore, Lahore or Karachi, as the case may be, as at present. It should be noted that in the case of supply bills issued from Cawnpore, Lahore, Karachi and Delhi, the intervention of the Treasury Officer will not be necessary. ' 3. The following further instructions should also be carefully noted. («) The abbreviated telegraphic addresses of the several offices of the Reserve Bank of India will be as follows :— Central Office of the Reserve Bank of India at Calcutta . . • • • • Reservbank. Offices of the Reserve Bank of India at Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Rangoon ... ... Reservist.2 Currency Offices at Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Bangoon, Lahore, Cawnpore and Karachi ♦ . . • • Currency. In telegraphic communications with any office of the Reserve Bank, the Cypher Code of the Currency Department only should be used unless and unti that Bank directs otherwise. (b) Until new forms are supplied, the existing supply bill and remittance transfer receipt forms can be used for the issue of supply bills or remittance transfer receipts on the Reserve Bank, when necessary, the name of the “ Imperial Bank of India ” on the form being altered in manuscript to “ Reserve Bank of India.” , f (c) Premia on supply bills, remittance transfer receipts and currency tele graphic transfers hitherto credited tp/Gcyprnment undgr the head “ XX\II - Currency ”, will, as from the 1st April 19&lt;*i5, be receivable by the Reserve Bank. JJM* or( ^ er l'h a f' tl 16 Bank may kHmv ^^e^miount/wllected at treasuries on the a above account, a monthly sta^in^nlfjjaowing the receipts on account of premia . on bills, etc., should be sejzr by Xhe treasuries in the Madras Presidency and /w ll J. Burma to the offices of tlie Banket Madras and Rangoon respectively, if by the treasuries in the Bobfydy Presyifency and the Central Provinces to the P office of the Reservi/Bank S Bombay and by the treasuries in other provinces to the Central Office of the Bank ax Calcutta. Renewal, etc., fees on Government Promissory notes, which are now received at treasuries and sub-treasuries on behalf of the Imperial Bank of India will be credited in future to the Reserve Bank which will take over the administration of the Public Debt from the Imperial Bank of India with effect from the 1st April 1935. The coupons on account of receipts of renewal, etc., fees should continue to be attached to the Government Promissory Notes forwarded to the Public Debt Office concerned. These receipts should be credited in your cash account under a new Central Ledger head “ Account with the Reserve Bank, Premia on bills, etc.,” under “ P—^Deposits and Advances—Part II—Deposits and Advances not bearing interest.” (d) The securities now held by me on behalf of Government Officers will be handed over to the Reserve Bank on the 1st April 1935, and consequently the work of distributing interest thereon to the parties concerned will, in future, devolve on that Bank. It has, therefore, been decided that Reserve Bank will issue on treasuries and sub-treasuries their own ‘ Security Deposit Interest Pay ment Orders ’ instead of the c Central Trust Interest Payments Orders ’ now issued by me. These Security Deposit Interest Payment Orders should be paid by you on behalf of the Reserve Bank and the debits should be shown in your list of payments under “ P—Deposits and Advances - Part II—Deposits and Advances not bearing interest—Account with the Reserve Bank—Security Deposit Interest Payments.” In case the new forms are not ready in time, the “ Central Trust Interest Payment Order ” forms will continue to be used by the Reserve Bank at the start with suitable alterations in manuscript or by rubber stamp. (e) Charges incurred in connection with the remittance of treasure will be borne by the Reserve Bank with effect from the 1st x\pril 1935. As stated in paragraph 5 of the circular letter quoted above, the Treasury and Sub treasury Officers should continue to incur all expenditure on the above account, such as cart and cooly hire, cost of boxes, pay and travelling allowance of potdars accompanying remittances, etc. As regards railway and steamer frieght, credit notes may be issued as at present.

Instructions for the prevention of frauds and defalcations of public money. I am directed to forward a copy of certain instructions for the prevention of frauds and delalcat- issued ions of public money/with the approval of the ^ocal Government by the Accountant-General, Burma, to all Disbursing Officers. Paragraph 8ia) (2) deals with the procedure for remitting money, realised from monthly pay bills under a Prohibitory Order of a Court, by book transfer through costal Accounts. 3. In the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the procedure prescribed in paragraph 8^a)(2j of the Accountant-General's instructions will prevent defalcations of public money and there appears to be no objection to it on principle. It is not, however, permissible under the existing rules in Civil account Code. The Postmaster General, Burma is agreeable to steps being taken to regularise this procedure and suggests that article 198(c), civil account ^ode, /ol. I and Article 33IB, Civil Account Code, Yol. II might be suitably expanded so as to allow Treasury officers to i gpmpf' Dertificates of Oredity instead of ••Cash' when making remittances by money order for any purpose. I am to reguest, therfore, that if there is no objection necessary provision may kindly be made in the Civil Account Code in order that the procedure laid down in paragraph 8 (a)( 2 ) of the Accountant-General's instruct ions may be re-introduced at an early date.@/r Extract paragraph 8(a) of the Instructions issued hy the Accountant-G-eneral, Burma to all disbursing officers outside .Rangoon in order to assist them in keeping of their accounts and to help them to rxssxxa realise ways in which money is most likely to go astray 8.(a) Bemittance of amount recovered from hills under orders of a Court.

The amounts will be deducted from the pay bills and credited in the Treasury accounts by transfer to the head “Civil Court Deposits*' in case of orders of the District Judge, Moulmein, and Judge of the District Court and Court of Small Causes, handalay (vide paragraph 549, Burma Treasury manual, Vol. l) and to the head “xievenue Deposits“ in case of other Courts kvide paragraph345 Burma Treasury Manual, Vol.l) One copy of the chalan duly signed by the Treasury Officer will be forwarded to the Court, the duplicate to the C-azetted officer concerned and the triplicate will be retained in the treasury. The payment of the amounts due to the parties concerned will be under the procedure for repayment of deposits. iii) In the case of attachments of the pay of non-gazetted officers the drawing officer will obtain before the end of the month chalans in triplicate signed by the Bailiff of the Court and attach them to the pay bills, the amounts of the chalan&amp; being shown as deductions in the pay bills.

' \ / I am directed to invite a reference to t-iyie ^ / correspondence enaing with your letter Ho. P.4237/23, dated the 9th August 1928, in which uhe sanction of the Secretary of State in Council was conveyed to certain amendments to Buies appended to the Central ^udit resolution in connection with the subject noted above. Under the liu^es appended to the Central Audit resolution as then amended, the sanction of the Secretary of otate is required to any addition to the office allowances and other contract grants of any Agency or Consulate in Iran except temporary overdrafts not exceeding Bs. 250/- at any Agency or Consulate; but in some cases in the past, the Government of India have failed to obtain such sanction, as the view held by audit authorities in India was that the sanction of the Secretary of State would be necessary only if the total of all the contract grants ; or office allowances in Iran was exceeded. moreover the resident enjoys powers of re-appropriation from one grant to another, and it is doubtful whether in exercis ing these powers he has always taken care to notice whether the fixed sanctioned amount was also exceeded. The usual practice of the Government of India has been to examine the total expenditure after the close of the year and to report any excesses, then brought to light, to the Secretary of State for ex post facto sanction. 2. Cn reconsideration of the position, the Government hP.Aia,2 . ^-•ndia considBr that under I^ule 1\9) of the ^vle appended to the Central Audit -resolution issued the finance Department Resolution xxxKadxucxt&amp;xx&amp;K v,i th •i-J 0 R. 33-1-(a,-Dx. 1/32, dated the 18th mehruary 1132, the previous sanction of the secretary of htate is necessary to any individual excesses in the Office Allowances or Jon tract 1-rants over and above the iixed grants, except in the case of temporary overdrafts not exceed ing Rs. 250/- in any year. fhe O-overn lent of India propose to impress on the Resident that it is essential for each Consular officer to watch and control the lexpenditure under the Contract grants, not only against the appropriations for any year, out also against the sanctioned grants. fhere is no objection to the continuance of the present powers of the resident to re-appropriatBXH from one Agency or Consulate to another, but the sanction of higher authority must be sought, as soon as it becomes apparent that a grant 'fixed 'by the secretary of jtate for any Agency is likely to be exceeded beyond the perrnissiole limit of overdraft. In actual practice it may not always be oracticaole for the G-overn.ient of India to obtain the - prior sanction of the Secretary of 3tate, and they woulc therefore, recommend that they should obtain ex pos t iact ; sanction in such cases. 3. In this connection I am to observe that Rules 1 18; and 119} of the Rules appended to the Central Audit Resolution refer to expenditure on 'Diplomatic H and Consular Cervices in Persia .She term 'Persia' has all along been considered by the C-ovemment of India to include also the xersian C-ulf. Che proposals in this letter are intended to apply to the Office Allowance and Contract d-rants of all Agencies and Consulates in Iran and the -ersian 0-ulf where the expenditure is divisible between the Povernment of India and his fRajesty's Government. In the case of the -ahrain andi uscat Agencies end also tn.e ^ialiidan Trade Agency, ha ?ver, the e: pend itnre fro: i the office allowance and contract grants is home entirely 'by India anc the G-oveminent of India, therefore, see no reason why ordinary additions to the office allowances and contract grants of these agencies should not oe sanctioned by the govern: ent of j-ndia. ..inhout reiarence toth e 3ecra t ary of 31a t e. 4. If the foregoing proposals are accep ts ole to his ^ r j asty* s Jecretary of 3tate for India, suits ole a end] erts to the rules appended to the Central -rudit r,esoluti n, where necessary, will oe drafted and suor dt ted separately for formal sanction.( 5 ®. 3 ? 4 Res.

In the accounts of the Government of India j^^unds of revenue ha\ ; e always been accounted for in reduction of receipts ami the correctness of this procedure has never been questioned* But in the Demands for Grants and in the Appropriation Accounts they have been treated us expenditure G The Auditor-General has stated that this latter practice is 5 in his ppinion, not constitutionally correct and is certainly not in accordance with the BriJjLsh practice* ffe considers that these disbursements cannot be regarded as ^expenditure” 0 He therefore reccmmends that the practice of including them in the Demands.for Grants and Appropriation Accounts should be disccntinuedr A fcraier Public Accounts Committee were also inclined to this view 0 W/e have also on several occasions observed the difficulty in estimating and controlling these more or less inevitable disbursements.

I have the Honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Under Secretary to the Government of India. Sir, I am directed to enclose a copy of the the introduction of coloured forms all chalans, bills, vouchers, etc. should be marked © or ©Copy of Auditor-General’s u.o.Note Fo, 110-Pefoi^is/29-37, dated the 26th January 1937,to the Finance Department. Will the Government of India kindly refer to paragraph 11 of their letter No. D-946S/7,dated the 1st November 1935, regarding Banking and Accounting arrangements consequential to the introduction of Provincial Autonomy containing the stipulation i nter-ali a that in order t enable the Branches of the Imperial Bank undertaking Government work at District and Sub-divisional headquarters to maintain a separate account of Central transactions apart from the transactions of the Provincial Governments, the Treasury Officers should see that all bills and chalcns, in addition tc the classifies- tionsalrcadyma.dc on 'them, indie ate clearly whether the tran saction appertains to the Central Government or not., The necessary provision enforcing this stipulation has been incorporated in clause (iii) of Rule 16 of the model Treasury Rules of Provincial Governments and similar provision will be included in the corresponding Treasury Rules of the Centre. The position has been clearly explained in sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph 6 of the Auditor-General's Nemorandum on this subject. The Reserve Bank apprehend that these instructions are likely txc result in the’ main differentiation between Central and Provincial being mixed up with the detailed account classification and that if this has to bo read through on each bill and chalan while preparing the daily list,the work involved will be enormous. This is what the Bank wish particularly to guard against. It has therefore been suggested that there should be a simple distinguishing mark on the vouchers,etc. to help the Branches of tlx Bank to classify them quickly as Central or Provincial. To achieve this end,the adoption of either of the following two courses has been proposeds- (i) All officers concerned authorised to pay or draw money should bo instructed to mark aid chalans, bills(ii) 2 , bills ,vouchers,cheques ; etc .prcminontly at the uox: right hand corner J or j P~] so that they will be readily recognisable by the Treasuries and Branches of the Bank, central and. Provincial transactions may be recorded on di f f e ro nt • coloure d c ha].ans , vouche rs ,bills, e tc : Provincial can always be white and Central blue. In the Auditor^General f s opinion the second alternative Aculd be more nelpful in the- sorting of vouchers as Centra]! and Provincial. The procedure suggested above for differentiation between. Central and Provincial transactions will have to be followed in the case of cheques drawn direct on the Bank by authorised drawing officers and in respect of transactions connected with the is sue and payment of Ho mitt rue e Transfer Hoceipts and Supply Bil'r,Deposits,etc. It may be impossible to ...n produce a big - change like his at once and the first alternative paragraph 1 aoeve might bo adopted pending the introduction of the arrangement in tnc second alternative. 3 ' . A£ ^ inperial* Bank is anxious to issue detailed instructions to ius branches regarding the working arrangements under the new regime as early a s pcssiole^the -Auditor-General will be glad if the Government of India take up this matter with the Provincial Governments.in orrer that the decisions may be communicated to the Bank as expeditiouely as possible.

To All Treasury and Disbursing Officers** Subject:- Financial and Accounting arrangements in transactions of the Crown Representative f s Department. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith extracts from the Auditor General's recent Memorandum on the above subject and to state that it has been decided by the Auditor General that the Crown Representative's Departmental Account should be separately compiled in future. In order therefore to ensure the accuracy in classification you are requested to see that all chalans, bills, vouchers relating to the Crown Representative's Department &amp;re prominently marked or stamped 'CROWN'. 2. In this connection it may be mentioned that the DepartmentcML Accounts of the Crown Representative will be a two sided account of receipts and expenditure. All receipts and expenditure relenting to tiiG Crown Representative's Department should, therefore, oe separately listed and shown in separate schedules to be attached to ohe Cash Accounts and lists of payments. Receipts under Section 146 of the new Government of India Act should also be shown in these schedules, though they will ultimately be transferred to Central (Federal) by deduction in the books of this office • I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, S .A «H • 1^ • 6.3V • -r y -&lt;:■ A ACCOUNTANT GENERAL CENTRAL REVENUES. \ v '•V &gt; 'Memorandum on the Financial Accounting and xiudit arrangements in respect of the transactions of the Departments under the control of His Majesty's Representative for the exercise of the functions f the Crown in its relations with Indir.n States. 5. Treatment of receipts under Sect i on 146 oi the -^-ct a - In dealing with the form of accounts of the Crown Representative it is necessary to describe the nature of the items Ox receipts c.nd due from or by any Indian State, referred to in Section 146 ox the Government of India Act, 1935, which may be received by His Majesty the disposal of the Governor General in Council or of the Federation Federation or Central Government. They will enter the accounts ox the Crown Representative only formally the entries on the receipt side of his account being offset by a deduct entry to represent the amount placed at the disposal of the Central Government® The receipts which will be finally accounted for in the accounts of the Crown Representative will accordingly consist of such items as accrue to the Grown Representative in the discharge oi the functions to be performed by him in his relations with the Indian States. The nature of these receipts can therefore be better determined with reference to the scope of the Crown Demand under Section 145 of the Government of India Act, 1935 « 6» Sc ope of Crown Demand ® No doubt exists an connection wibn some of the items in the Crown Representative’s demand. Cne of such items is the sum required for ranking any payments in respect of any c. 'tomary allowances to members of the family or servants oi any former Ruler of any territories in India. These payments known as 'Political Pensions' were heretofore charged to the Central Government under the x X X X X X X X X X X X X after t ,he coming into force of Part VII of the Act shall be placed at- 2 - hec^d '44:'-Territoric.l and Political Pensions'. Separate instructions have already been issued by the Government of India with particulars of pensions of this category that have to be charged in the accounts of the Crown Representative with effect from 1st April, 1937. The expenses of the Secretariat of the Crown Representative (the Political Department and the Crown Finance) and of the Political agencies in so far as they relate to political relations with Indian States will be included in the Crown Demand. The Crown Demand may also include certain Education expenditure connected with Chiefs’ Colleges etc* which the Crown Representative may legitimately incur in exercise of his functions. Loans to Indian States may appear in the demand under Section 145. The Federation or the Central Government will not of course be precluded from making any loan direct to an Indian State on their own account even before the State concerned has Federated. The scope of the demand under Section 145 cannot however at this stage be finally determined. Some of the tentative conclusions so fc.r reached are summarised belows- (a) The fact that a payment is to be made to an Indian State or that any expenditure has to be incurred in an un-administered Indian State does not necessarily determine that the payment or the expenditure will form the subject of the Crown Demand. It has accordingly been settled for the time being that any payments heretofore nx.de to an Indian State by the Governor General in Council under any agreement, which f&lt;..ll within the purview of Section 148 of the Act, should continue to be included in the appropriate subject demands of the Central Government. (b) As regards leased, assigned or ceded areas known as 'administered areas' it is generally accepted that according to the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935 the Crown Representative would bo constitutionally responsible for the administration and exorcise of jurisdiction in those areas and that all expenditure on the ordinary administration of an 'administered area', whatever the purpose of the lease or cession, justiiies a demand on the part of txie Cro^n Representative under Section 145. It has however been conceded that the Federal or Central departments of Income Tax, Posts and Telegraphs, Defence and also Railways should continue to function in these areas-3- r.s hitherto and no item of receipts or expenditure pertaining to these departments should enter the budget or the accounts of the Crown Representative. It has further been recognised that there might bo other typos of Governmental activity not falling into the class o± ordinary administration o »g • commercial activities which v.'ould not justify a demand under Section 145. Any border line cases will have to be decided on their merits* (c) It has been accepted tentatively that provision for an itc ~ of expenditure need not necessarily be included in the demand under Section 145 though properly falling within that demand where the Contrt.l (or Federal) Government are prepared to grant the supply under &lt;~n ordinary demand* fhis arrangement is without prejudice to the Crown Representative's powers to demand under Section 145 if provision is not made otherwise, and has been adopted to secure, as long as possible, simplicity in financial and accounting arrangements* X X X x X x X X X X X X X 8. Content of the account * The account of the Crown Representative vdll be a two sided account of receipts and expenditure, ns explained in paragraph 5 of the memorandum all receipts under Section 146 of the Act will be placed at the disposal of the Federation or of the Governor General in Council by a deduct entry on the receipt side of the Crown accounts- The receipt entry will be 'Receipts from Indian States under Section 146 other than on account of Loans' and the deduct entry 'Receipts transferred to Centra], (Federal) Government”* The receipts of the Crown Representative which will be finally accounted for in his accounts will consist of such receipts as accrue in connection with the functions ho exercises in 'administered areas' and of any miscellaneous receipts and recoveries whj-ch accrue in Political Agonpies in connection with the exercise o± his oIner functions. For each main head on the expenditure side of account mentioned in paragraph 7 above there would be a corresponding receipt head. The receipts falling under these heads may oe recorded in such detail © ——detail as the local authorities subordinate to the Crown Representative in consultation with the Accountant General concerned may determine. The sub-heads and detailed heads subordinate to the six main neado of expenditure mentioned in paragraph 7 will be at present those given in Appendix II to Demands for Grants of the Central Government for the year 1937-38. It may however be explained in this connection that when the Budget of the Crown Representative for the year ^37-38 was under preparation certain important issues connected with it wore still v.ndociaea and it has been arranged that this Budget will bo jointly reviewed m the course of 1937 by the Government of India and the auditor General in order that any misclassifications and inaccuracies as may be discovered m the light of the decisions subsequently taken may be rectified. 9, Administered Area Accounts. The accounts of receipts and expenditure connected with the administration of 'administered areas' will be kept in the form of separate area accounts similar to that hitherto adoptee for such areas 9 the transactions in those separate accounts being classified under major and minor heads corresponding to those adopted in the i.roa Demands and Accounts of the Federal or Central Government. It is important to note however two peculiarities. These area accounts will be two sided accounts of receipts and expenditure working to the net figure m the Demand. The other peculiarity is that the major and minor heads of these area accounts are not part of the Federal major or minor . - c -ds hut individual to the Crown Representative's account only. X X X X X X X X 13 . Federal or Central Accounts. The formal accounting arrangements a re summa r i s e d b clows - TV,r sums roauirod by the Crown Roprosontc-tivo for his ordin; expenses yill bo recorded in the c.ocounts of the Contrcl Government under hcr.d ' 33 -Peymonts to Groan Represent! tivo'. The minor heeds subordinate-5- to this major head will be as follov/s;- Crown Representative’s Secretariat. Political Agencies* Education - other than in areas. Civil Works. Political Pensions. Superannuation Allowances and Pensions. Rajputana, Central India. Hyderabado Western India States Agency* Bangalore• Charges in England. Loss or gain by Exchange. The figures under each of these minor heads will be the anoun^s oi net expenditure working up to a net total under the major head as a wholey i.e. the receipts pertaining to each minor head, which will, of course, appear on the Receipt side of the accounts of the Crown Representative, will be tclcen as deductions from expenditure under that head in the accounts of the Central Government. Payments made by the Central Government for making loans to States will bo recorded in the accounts of that Government under '^HLoans and Advances by the Central Government-Advances to the Crown Representative for loans to Indian States', ’without any details. Any amounts received from Indian States under Section 146 of the Act and placed at the disposal of the Federation will also, as in the Cc.se of the Crown Demand under Section 145 consist of (1) Repayments in respect of loans mr.de to Indian States and (2) Cash contributions and other payments duo from or by Indian States. The receipts in respect of repayment of loans vail be taken to the receipt side of the head 'Q-Loens and lidvances by the Central Government - Advances to Crown Representative for loans to Indian States. Other payments by Indian States would bo recorded under head 'XLII - Payments from Indian States', receipts from each principal Indian State being shown separately.

Subjects- Procedure for the sanction of pensions Sir, I am directed to state that it has been brought to the notice of the Government of India that the procedure generally followed at present in sanctioning pensions is that applications for . pensions of both gazetted and. non-gazetted officers are sent through official superiors to the Audit Officer in the first instance and the latter, after making the necessary verification of services, etc-, submits the application to the Local Government or other authority empowered to sanction the pension, with a report upon the claim for pension and the rules applicable to the case. The pension is then sanctioned by the competent authority and on receipt of the sanctioning order the Audit Officer issues the necessary Pension Payment Order. This procedure conforms to Articles 913 and 914 of the Civil Service Regulations but it causes, inevitably,considerable delay in the payment of pension. 2. In this connection I am to invite attention to Note 2 below Article 918 of the Civil Service Regulations, which prescribes an alternative procedure which is intended to cut out a certain amount of this delay but which, it is understood, is not being followed generally. The Government of India consider that the procedure prescribed in the note referred to above can be followed with advantage in the case of all non-gazetted and gazetted oilicers whose pension is sanctioned by an authority lower than the Local Government. In practice the procedure will he as follows 6 .- The last Lofficiel superior* (not being the Local Government) through whom the application is submitted to the Audit Officer (vide Articles 910 and 913(a) of the Civil Service Regulations) will,- 2 - if that ’official superior* is also the authority competent to sanction the pension in question, record on the application or the letter forwarding the application for pension his provisional recommendation stating whether the pension claimed should he admitted or not, the recommendation, of course, being made after cldPconsideration of the facts of each case. The -*‘-¥ Audit Officer will, then, on finding the claim in order, forth- with issue the necessary pension payment order, as prescribed in Note 2 below Article 918 Civil Service Regulations. 3. I ai t! requett that the attention of all authorities competent to sanction pension under Article 918(b) or Note (l) below Article 918 Civil Service Regulations nay be drawn to the provisions of Note 2 under that Article and they may be asked to adopt the procedure described herein as generally as possible.

Gupta, Esq., T.C.b., Under Secretary to the Government of India. To All Minor Local Governments. Subjects- Procedure for the payment of pensions. Sir, The Government of India have had under consideration the question of introducing pensioners’ photographs as an additional means of identification for the purpose of payment of pension. This experiment has been tried for one year in the North T est Frontier Province, and has proved to be a success. It affords the disbursing officer a comparatively easy means oi identiiication, and also saves tne pej-is-i-ont^i o some delay which might have been caused by the need for comparing the tnumb and finger impressions before ma^irg. payment, 'j The Government of India have, therefore, decided that in the case of pensioners whose pensions are to be paid from Centrally administered treasuries, the heads of offices should, at the time of completing pension application forms and transmitting the pension papers to one Account Gffxcex concerned, forward therewith one certified copy of each 'oensioner's photograph in passport size. The -account Gfj.icer v/ill have the photograph pasted on the disbursing Officer’s half of the pension payment order, and the Treasury Of.L.icer v? ill then be in a position to make payment on the strength of the resemblance between the pensioner and his photograph wending the final re-conciliation of any question which nay arise about identification marks. This means of identification of pensioners will be in addition to the existing system of recording the thumb and finger impressions, which will remain a permanent and reliablei - 2 - record of pensioner’s identity. Pensioners will bear the cost of their photographs. These orders will also apply to Central Government pensioners drawing pensions from treasuries in Provinces which have adopted this system of identification of their oensioners. These orders will not, however, apply to European ladies, purdah ladies, persons who have been gazetted officers, persons who hold Government titles, and persons who have been specially exempted by Government.

K o K o Chettur 9 Esquire 9 M.A . 5 Under Secretary to the Government of India All Chief Commissioners 0 Subjecto 0 - Exercise of the power to sanction expenditure 9 delegated by the Governor-General in Council to Chief Commissioners and other authorities•subordinate to him. oir 9 I am directed to say that a case has recently come to notice in which an authority subordinate to 'the Governor-General in Council sanctioned certain expenditure which though within that authority's financial powers could not be met from the budget allotment at its disposal. In this connection I am to invite a reference to rule 3 in Fart II of the Book of Financial Powers which lays down that sanction to any given expenditure does not become operative until funds have been appropriated to meet it. As there is no point in issuing a sanction which will not be operative, it follows that sanctions to expenditure should not be given when no funds are available to meet the charge. In other words, if a subordinate authority has not funds from which to meet a charge it cannot issue an operative sanction and must, therefore, apply to the Central Government for funds to cover such expenditure. In practice, therefore, the powers of various authorities to sanction expenditure are limited to the extent of the funds which they are authorised to appropriate or re-appropriate and all proposals for expenditure which cannot be so met should be referred to the Central Government before they are actually sanctioned. 2. I am to add further that want of budget provision operates as a restraint on the powers of a subordinate authority to incur expenditure and that the Central Government is not bound to provide funds as a matter of course for all fresh items of expenditure which a subordinate authority may deem fit to sanction under the powers granted to it under the Book of Financial Powers. The position is that while it is open wo a subordinate authority to exercise its financial powers within the limitsvi Under Secretary to.- the Government of India - 2 - limits of its budget provision whether by appropriation or valid re—erp^ropriation any proposal for Y'/liich f'onds cannot be made available or ^nich involve further outlay in a future financial year and to meet which no permanent recurring savings are available 5 must first receive the sanction of the Central Government before any expenditure is incurred. In the latter class of cases such items are to be shown as a fresh charge when the estimates are forwarded to the Central Government for inclusion in their budget. 3 . I am to reouest that the position as explained aboxkjShould be kept in view when dealing with proposals for expenditure. I have the honour to be 9 Sir ? Your most obedient servant ?

The bize of any note should conform exactly to that of a genuine note of that denomination. The standard sizes of the genuine notes of the current designs are as follows:- R eserve Bank no tos* Government of India ~urrencv notes . Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. 100'A 10;ooo^- 6| ; ' 6i ,J 8* 8 ' x X -rr x 2.7/8' 3,1/8' 4t' • 4|' 5 ?1 o”- 5 51 5i” 8^ 8” 1 hV°‘ x X X n o n o” 2.' The thickness of the paper of genuine notes is at present between 24 and 3 thousandths of an inch, for the higher denomi nations, viz. Rs. 100/- , Rs.1,000/- and Rs.10.000/- while for Rs.5/-, Rs.10/- and Rs. 50, it is between and 4 thousandths of an inch. 3 Th e ^u^^r of a g'-nuine note will be found to have a distinct crachle . due to its method of manufacture, a feature which is non-existent in forged rotes. The colour of the clean paper of a genuine note is slightly bluish white, i.e., not creamy. 4. The paper of the Rs, 5/- Government of India currency note has a relief watermark appearing in the unprinted space on the left side of the front of the note depicting the star of India, and that of the Rs.lQ/- and higher denominations has a relief watermark depicting the portrait of His late Majesty. All Reserve Bank of India notes have the portrait oi His Majesty King George VI. In genuine notes these watermarks are clear and distinct and are composed of shaded areas graded from opaque white to semi-tran:parency. The production of the proper water- i®.rk by forgers is extremely difficult and this is the first feature to look at if in doubt as to the genuineness of a note. In forgeries imitation of the watermark is often attempted by printing the portrait in oil, wax or grease so as to give trans parency to the paper, but comparison with a genuine watermark will at once show the difference. The genuine watermark is moulded in the paper at the time of making and io cannot be faithfully reproduced in any other way. Another method of imitating the watermark is by rubbing or scraping the paper to reproduce the transparent parts and by printing in white ink to represent the opaque parts, a careful examination will again shov; up the difference as compared with a genuine watermark. 5. The printed matter on genuine notes is bright and clear.- 2 - A great deal of it consists of very fine line work which on inspection will be found to be clean, unbroken and free from any kind of blurring or smearing. In forgeries the fine line work is never without a considerable number of defects due either to the inaccuracy of the reproduction in making the plate, or to the smearing of the ink when printing. Inspection of the fine lines in the work will frequently show up forgery quickly - and clearly. Genuine notes are printed by offset lithography which causes no impression of the paper, Forgeries on the othei hand are generally printed from raised blocks, and the pressure in printing causes indenting of the paper which can often be seen on the reverse side. Only the numbering of genuine notes is printed in this manner and a slight indentation of the paper can often be seen behind the numbers on the genuine notes, 6, Genuine notes are at present stapled together in bundles before issue and two stapling holes half an inch apart appear in the left hand borders of genuine notes of recent issue, 7. Forgeries are frequently soiled and crumpled purposely to hide defects. The best aid to detection is always comparison with a clean note of the same denomination.

Subject:-Procedure for the settlement of transactions involving inter-Governmental adjustments Originating in the accounts for March. I have the honour to invite a reference to paragraph 36 of the Auditor-General’s Memorandum on the Banking and Accounting arrangements consequential to the introduction of provincial autonomy and to state that large amounts to be debited against the Government of Bombay are generally passed on through the March (final) accounts of the Accounting Officers of Posts and Telegraphs, Railwayrand Defence Departments. In many cases these transactions are included in the March (final) accounts because of the delay in the acceptance by the respective heads of Offices or Departments under the Government of Bombay of the bills sent to than for supplies, etc., made in March by the Officers who render accounts to those Accounting Officers. With a view to carrying out the necessary adjustments before the 15th April each year, it was proposed to the Auditor-General that the Officers who make supplies or render services should, in respect of transactions originating in the month of March, raise debits therefor- in anticipation of their acceptance by the Officers concerned. The Auditor-General has no objection to this proposal provided the Government of Bombay concur in it. I would, therefore, enquire whether the Government of Bombay agree to this proposal and if so, would issue necessary instructions in the matter to the Officers under their control. 2. In this connection, it may aL so be observed that it would facilitate matters if a similar arrangement is' • . : T. arrived at with the Central Government and other Provincial Governments in respect of supplies- made or services rendered to them by the Officers of the Government of Bombay.

RULES REGULATING THE COMPASSIONATE FUND OF THE GOVERN MENT OF INDIA. 1 . The Compassionate Fund is intended for the relief of the families of Gov ernment servants paid monthly from Central revenues, whether their rates of pay are fixed on a daily or a monthly basis, if they are left in indigent circumstances on account of the premature death of the person upon whom they depended for support. Its scope is limited to the dependants of those who served in or under :— (a) Civil Departments, including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance, and the Railway Department, but excluding the Posts and Telegraphs Department, (b) the Army and Marine Departments if they were subject to the Civil Service Regulations, or (c) Minor Local Governments and Administrations : Provided that no application will be considered from dependants of Gov ernment servants who were subscribers to a contributory provident fund (in cluding the State Railway Provident Fund) or come within the scope of the State Railway Gratuity Rules : Provided further that no application will be considered which is not sub mitted to the department of the Government of India concerned within one year of the death of the Government servant, unless the delay in submission is suffi ciently explained. It is most desirable that applications should be submitted as promptly as possible after the death of a Government servant. The Fund is formed by an annual grant of Rs. 40,000, which is cumulative, the unexpended balance of each year’s grant being carried forward for expendi ture in succeeding years. The maximum limit of expenditure in any single year is Rs. 45,000. 2. The conditions which regulate a grant from the Fund are :— (1) Grants from the Fund are restricted to cases of an exceptional character. (2) The deceased officer must have been a meritorious public servant. Unusually meritorious service gives special claim for consideration. (3) Death due to special devotion to duty establishes a strong claim for consideration. (4) In more ordinary cases preference should be given to the dependants of officers who have completed many years service and have just failed to draw their pension. (5) Other things being equal, preference should be given to those who have been on low rates of pay. (6) Asa general rule a grant should not be given if the salary of the deceased officer exceeded Rs. 750 a month. (7) Assistance should seldom be given to families of gazetted officers ex cept so far as it may be necessary to assist them to obtain a passage home. (8) Care should be taken that too many grants are not made to families of officers who have been serving at the headquarters of the Govern ment of India. 3. The rules for sanctioning grants are :— (1) No pension is granted from the Fund, but in some cases yearly grants are made for a limited period to defray the expenses of the education of children. (2) The maximum gratuity payable in any individual case is Rs. 5,000. The precise amount in all cases is fixed according to the number in the family and the necessities of the case, the equivalent of a year’s pay of the deceased being considered a suitable maximum in cases in which the circumstances are such as to require liberal treatment, but m most ordinary cases, six months’ pay is regarded as sufficient!2 4. The Fund will be administered by a Committee appointed by the Govern ment of India. The administrative Department will forward to the Finance De partment, applications for the grant of a gratuity with other relevant documents and on their receipt, the facts will be summarised and put up without comment. The Committee’s decision will be taken once every three months and will be com municated by the Finance Department direct to the applicant, the Department concerned and the Accountant General concerned. A list of the awards sanctioned will also be furnished to the Accountant General, Central Revenues. If pay ment is to be made to a person resident in England, the Finajnce Department will address the High Commissioner for India for the payment to be made. 5. Cases relating to grants from the Compassionate Fund will not be sub mitted to His Excellency the Viceroy. +APPENDIX. The following particulars should be furnished in each case of recommendation for the grant of an award from the Compassionate Fund :— (1) Name of the deceased, last appointment held ; pay at time of death and the date of death. (2) Total service (whether pensionable or non-pensionable). (3) (a) Dependants (with their respective ages). (6) Their pecuniary* circumstances. (c) Names of immediate relatives with their occupation, status, and income. {d) Whether relatives are (t) able, (ii) unable, (in) able but unwilling to give any assistance. (4) Remarks of superior officer on deceased’s work. (5) Was death due to, or accelerated by, devotion to duty 1 (6) Recommendation of Department, etc., regarding amount of grant. (7) (a) Name of the treasury at which payment is desired. (h) Full address of the payee.

( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (10) An independent report on the financial condition of the applicant from the Collector or District Magistrate or Political Officer of the place where the applicant resides. *If the deceased was a subscriber to the General Provident Fund andlor was insured, the amount of his deposits in the Fund and|or the amount for Avhich he was insured should be mentioned. If he was neither a subscriber to the General Provident Fund nor insured, the fact should be stated.

Basis of charge. —Previously the basis of assessment in respect of any amount chargeable under “ salaries 55 was the actual amount paid, bat this has now been changed and the present basis is the salary paid to a person or due to him, whether paid or not. An advance by way of loan or otherwise ol income chargeable under the head “ salaries ” is deemed to be salary due on the date when the advance is received. 3. Super tax also to be deducted by employer.— The responsibility for deducting tax at the time of payment of salary has been extended to cover super-tax as well as income-tax. 4 Rates oS tax for persons resident in British India. —In the case of an employee, who is resident in British India, income-tax and super-tax must be deducted at a rate representing the average of the rates applicable to his estimated total income under the head “ salaries ”. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the system of rates for income-tax has been changed and now follows that which has always been in force for super-tax. The rates of income-tax for the year commencing on 1st April 1939 (which are applicable to all deductions to be made on or after that date) are (except for companies and lor cases to which the maximum rate of tax applies) - Rate.

Instructions in regard to the consequential arrangements to be made for deducting tax on such leave salaries and leave allowances in the case of Government servants are being issued. Other employers are required to deduct tax in accordance with paragraphs 4, o and b above. 8. Failure to deduct tax or to pay over the tax deducted.— Any person responsible for paying “ salaries ” who does not deduct tax or after deducting fails to pay the tax as required will without prejudice to any other conse quences which he may incur, be deemed to be in default personally in respect of the tax. 9.

From To Sir TiSiFillay, Esquire, Deputy Secretary to the G-overnment of India All Provincial Governments and Administrations. Income-tax - Deduction of, from salary, etc. ? - Memo randum of instructions for In continuation of my letter C.No. 35(3)'-I.T/39, dated the 15th August 1939, I am directed to say that a question has been raised whether the average rate of income-tax worked out at Mie beginning of the year should be revised ana adjustments of income-tax made if a person receives an honorarium or ennanced pay for some period during the year o&amp; account of officiating promotion or reduced pay due to reversion or leave on half average pay etc, and whether such revisions of the average rate uf income-tax instead of being effected on each ana every occasion of a change.in emoluments may not be carried out at fixed intervals, say half yearly or quarterly. The Government of India nave no objection to disbursing officers making adjustments in respect of deductions at source at periodical intervals. In fact, the proviso to section 18(E) bf the Indian Income-tax iict, 19E2., actually gives them the power to do so. Sucn adjustments should not however come into the account of two years; that is, adjustments should not be t made from payments on or after the 1st April of any year in respect of any excessive or deficient deduction made prior to that date. In this connection I am to enclose an extract of letter No.T.1065 -Admn .1/19-39, dated tne 5th September 1939, from the auditor General of India to the accounts Officers and to requ est that tne procedure stated therein may be brought to tne notice of all disbursing officers for their information ana guidance.

The months selected for tne periodica.! half-yearly adjust ments would normally be September and March, but if it is likely to ee difficult in practice to examine the cases of all assesseea in a single month, the examination ma.y be spread over two or more months at the discretion of the accountant GenereJL./ • ^0. 1644 -60/3* British.

Enelosurej-Cne. Sir, •• I have the honour to state that it has comedo notice that two different methods are followed in different offices in calculating toe one- eleventh period of duty in respect of Government servants subject tothe special leave rules for toe purpose of determining toe ^ximum amount of leave on average pay admissible under Fundamental Rule 81(b)(i). According to* one 'method* 1 on eVery occasion on which a Gover^entservantsubjectto the special leave rules, proceeds on leave the calculation ^ 'fde by taking one-eleventh of toe total of the different periods apent on duty from 1st January 1922 to date. According to the other method, toe l/llth is oal- culated separately for each separate period of duty. This second method of calculation 3 is the correct method. To make the point clear a separate statement is attached illustrating the two different a a concrete case. It will be seen therefrom that ord . dav or two in the amount of leave on average pay at credit nay arise cc ■ ^ L the first or toe second method is applied. The Auditor General of The credit already given in the leave accounts up to 31st August 1939 unfler the first method la to be left undisturbed. 2 It will be seen that the second method of calculation, which takes each period of duty separately, suggests the maintemnce of a contx- ,! rrJTaf toe calculations made from time to time. It has further been 3 decided toerefore that where subsidiar^ccounts of leave on average nnv on the correct lines are not already being maintained such accounts _ Pn+nT»«=i with n view to save l&amp;bour, howovor, tho U Auditor Gtoeral has di^cted’toat toe accounts should be opened as and when the occarion arises next in each individual case in accordance with the procedure indicated below.

The Committee have therefore decided that the following : steps should te taken to reduce the id elay in the sanc- ftlon' of the awards as far as' Possible — (1) All departments of the Government of India and the Heads of Departments and heads of offices subordinate to them shouldtreat all references and proposals in regard to grants, from the Compassionate Fund as rt very urgent”. This will, minimise ‘one time at present taken by their proposals to reach the Secretary to the Committee. (2) In all cases.(except those few which present unusual featured and in which the specific approval of the Honourable Members constituting the Comrittee is required) in which awards are sanctioned, payment should issue at once - (i) for the full amount awarded, if the amount is Rs.150/- or less; and (ii) for a moiety of the amount proposed to be awarded, if the amount exceeds Rs. 150/-. (3) The balance of the awards referred to in.(2)(ii) above and the awards in which specific approval of the Honourable Members constituting the Conmittee is required will be paid?at the end of each ouarter, after the financial position of the Fund has been reviewed, as usual^ • 2.

I shall he grateful if you would kindly let me have a descriptive roll of the applicant (in duplicate in the form enclosed) along with an independent report, after getting the necessary enquiries made, about the appli cant, containing information on the following points.'— (1) Dependents with their respective ages; (2) their pecuniary circumstances; -- (3) names -of immediate relatives with their occupation, status, and income!

I may add that such applications for grants have to be submitted for orders of the Committee administer ing the Compassionate Fund of the Government of India through the Department of the Government of India con cerned and the issue of final orders therefore, even with all the expedition possible, necessarily takes some time. Since awards from this fund are intended to help the dependents of deceased Government servants to tide over difficulties which may face them inmediate- ly after the death of the earning member, delay in sanctioning any grant detracts greatly from the useful ness of the grant.

The Hon’ble the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, BUS HIKE. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith an application from the Arabic section of the Bahrain Agency staff who accord ing to the existing rules cannot draw travelling allowance when proceeding on or returning from leave. Travelling expenses in the Gul' can at present only be drawn by a Government servant who is of Indian or European domicile who lias been recruited from outside the Gulf area, (see S.R.294-A). It is a matter of considerable hardship in the Gulf where we are dependent on so expensive a concern as the British India Steam Navigation Company for Arabs and Persians posted at great distances from their home towns to proceed on leave with their wives and amilies at their own expense, and I feel that they should receive some assistance. It is of course true that in the case of Indian clerks, many of them live at great distances from the port of disembarkation or fixed point in India and for overland travel they receive no travelling allowance but the fact that they are granted two passages for each journey compensates for this loss at any rate in the case of a abachelor. 2. Conditions of service for Arab and Pe7 j sian inter preters in Government employ within the Gulf should in my view compare favourably with those offered by Oil Companies to men of similar status amployed by them and if they do not the risk is run of the oil companies obtaining the best men. I am certain thht for instance a Kuwaiti recruited in Kuwait2 Kuwait for work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company would be given a free passage for himself and his wife when proceeding on leave and in the same way the Bahrain Government pays for tbe passages of all clerks proceeding on leave recruited from and domiciled in places outside Bahrain. 3 . I therefore forward this application for favourable consideration with the recommendation that these persons may be allowed to draw a single passage in such cases.

Sir, I have the honour to state that an annual return under Section 21 of the Income Tax Act, 1922, is required to be prepared and submitted to the Income Tax Officer by •- (a) All Civil Audit Officers for all Gazetted Officers and others who dhaw their pay from audit offices on separate bills; and also lor all pensioners who draw their pensions from audit o ff i ces . (b) Treasury Officers for all Gazetted Offibefe fchd others who dtew their pay from treasuries on separate bills without counter signature; ahd also for all pens ioheVs tobo draw their pensions from treasuries . (c) Heads Of offices for all hon-*gnNetted Officers whose pay is drawn on establishment bills or on bills countersigned by the herd of officei (d) ^orest disbursing officers and Public Y/orks Depairtment disburs- ' ing Officers in case wherei din ct payment from treasuries is not made, for themselves and their establishments. Government servants who remain under the payment of one and the same disbursing throughout the year. But some difficulty is felt in the pr* paration of the returns for those who cemo under the payment of last Treasury and Disbursing Officer on transfer from another office, or on return from leave after drawing lef.vc sr.L-.ry out of Ineia or in mother province or circle of audit for ixx want of full details in the last pay certificate or pay slips and authorities for pay ment. In order to overcome these difficulties the following procedure may be adopted by all concerned, if not already donoj- or the Disbursing Officers issuing the last pay certificates should note in the last fay certificates all deductions made by them from April to the date of issue of the Inst pay certificate to enable the receiving disbursing officer to ccmpletc the return. (ii) The Treasury or the Disbursing Officer while receiving the last pay certificate should examine whether the information regarding thv deductions of income tax for the entire period from April to the date of last payment has been given in the last pay certificate and if so, should note the details in the prescribed 2. No difficulty is experienced in preparing the return of those (i) In the case of ti’ansfer of an officer the Treasury Officers form-2- form or rcgistct* mnintnincd for the purpose before: it is sent to the Audit Office along v;ith the bill. In ense-s where the information is not complete or not given it should be obtained separately from the treasury issuing the last pay certificate and the form or register completed on receipt of the information. The last pay certificate should not, however, be returned but an indication of the action taken should be noted thereon for the information of Audit Office e.g. ’’information incomplete - the Treasury Officer asked to supply the omissions”. (iii) When a pay slip or letter of authority is issued by this office to an officer who returns to duty after drawing leave salary out of India or in another province or circle of audit full details of pay etc., drawn and income tax paid from the 1st April of the year will be furnished therewith. r (iv) In cases in which pay slip or letter of authority is issued to an officer coming on transfer from another province or audit circle it will contain an instruction to the officer to attach his copy of the last pay certificate to the first bill presented for 4 payment fhotn which the Treasury Officer will get the information of income tax etc. (v) In cases in which a fresh pay slip or letter of authority is issued to an officer on leave in India who wishes to change the treasury of payment in the same audit circle, the last pay certificate received by this office will be returned to the officer along with t^e fresh pay slip or letter of authority with instructions to attach the same to the first bill presented for payment. (vi) A fresh pay slip is issued to an officer transferred from one district to another on promotion etc. In these cases the last pay certificate obtained by the officer from the old treasury and attached to the first bill presented for payment at the new treasury will furnish the necessary information.

Metcalfe ending with his demi-official letter l-Io»708-l/2 dated 18th December 1940 regarding his request for a permanent advance of Rs.500/- for this office and for touring expenses et cetera# 2 # I attach a statement showing the amounts, totalling Rs.1791-11-0 in one year, spent by the Residency Agent out of his own pocket on Government charges. He is allowed to set off against these the amounts ; also shown in the statement, which he recovers from the sale of stamps for passports; the amounts remaining after the set off are recovered by him by presentation of a monthly bill to Bahrain. This, as you will see amounts to about Rs.ICC/- average per month. 3. I think you will agree that it is hardly fair and certainly entirely wrong in principle that any Government official should have to pay Government charges in advance in this way. It also extremely inconvenient that there is no fund 4ft whatsoever from which we can pay for even the smallest touring expenses such as mending camp furniture and the like. I would therefore urge most strongly that a permanent contingent advance of Rs.500/- be made for such expenses of this office. I hope there is sufficient material in this letter to justify the proposal. It would have had to have been introduced before had the Residency Agent not been a man of sufficient means to make what, in effect, amounts to an advance of Rs.100/- per month to Government. Further, the posting of the Political Officer here and his touring have increased these expenses and the fact that Metcalfe brought up the question is, I think,a satisfactory rebuttal in advance of the inevitable query from the guardians of our expenditure as to why there was no need for this before.r No•233-4/23 Political Agency, Bahrain. ?th Frbruary, 1942 To The Political Officei*,Trucial Coast, 3ha r f 1 ah • ^ Memorandum * Reference your demi-official No.825-1/6 / ¥ % dated the 6th December, 1941, to Major Alban, on the subject of a permanent advance of fe.500/- for your office and touring expenses. 2 * 1 forward, herewith, a sura of Rs.500/- (Five hundred only) for this purpose. 2• It is requested that a receipt in duplicate may be sent to this office for record. also required on the 1st April each year, under Article 93 of the Civil Account Code Vol. I % and on the transfer of the incumbent of the post.

(Referred to in Article 33-C) INSTRUCTIONS FOR HANDLING CASH, The following rules should be observed by all Government servants (except the Treasury and other officials for whose guid ance separate detailed rules already exit) who are required to receive and handle cashx- (1) Each officer receiving money on behalf of Government should maintain a Cash Book in C. A. C» form 18 • (2) All cash transactions should be entered in the Cash Book as soon as they occur, and attested in token of check* (3) The Cash Book should be closed regularly and completely checked. At the end of each month the officer-in-charge of the Cash Book should personally verify the cash balance in the Cash Book and record a signed and dated certificate to that effect® (4) When money is received by a Government servant, a receipt should be granted in form C. A* C. 18-a (S-119) to the payer. This receipt should be signed only by a responsible officer who should satisfy himself at the time of signing the receipt that the amount has been entered in the Cash Book. Note. Receipt Books in form S-119 are obtainable from Central Forms Stores, Calcutta, and should be kept in the personal custody of the officer using them. (5) The employment of peons to fetch or carry money should be discouraged. When it is absolutely necessary to employ an inferior servant for this purpose, men of some length of service and proved trustworthiness should only be selected and, in all cases, when the amount to be handled is large, more than one messenger should be employed* (6) A Government servant who handles Government money should not, except with the special sanction of the head of the office, be allowed to handle also in official capacity money which does not belong to Government. Where under any special sanction, a Government servant deals with both Government and non-Gov eminent money in his official capacity, the Government money should be kept in a cash box separate from the non-Government money and the transactions relating to the latter should be accounted for in a separate set of books and kept entirely out of Government account. (7) In the case of payments into treasuries the disbursing officer should compare the Treasury Officer's receipt on the chalan with the entry in the Cash Book before attesting it, and when such payments are appreciable, he should obtain from the Treasury a monthly list of payments which should be compared with the postings in the Cash Book. (8) public money not in the custody of a Treasury should be kept in strong treasure chests and secured by tiro locks of different patterns. All keys of the same lock should be kept in the same person's custody and as a general rule the keys of one lock should be kept apart from the keys of the other lock and in a different person's custody when practicable. When there is a police guard, the officer-in-charge of such guard should be entrusted with the custody of the keys of one lock. The chest should never be opened without both the custodians of the keys being present. The officer-in-charge of the police guard (where such guard is provided) should always be present when the treasure chest is opened and until it is again locked* ooOooTHE POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHREIN. ,, /9V2~. d.f.a.

It should also be clearly laid down in a Stand ing Order who is entitled to sign vouchers. 3 . I was informed that according to a local rule the accountant is not supposed to have with him more than Rs.3000/- in cash, but it appears that he often has up to Rs. 6000/- and possibly at times even more. The provisions of paragraph 8 of Annexure 8 to Chapter X of the Civil Account Code volume X are not beint, observed, tfunds are usually obtained from the rost Office, and sometimes When there is not a sufficient balance with the Post Office, from the Bank. So security ie furnished by the accountant. It is for consideration whether arrangements should not be made for the Agency funds to be kept with the Bank, the amount to be held by the accountant being limited to Rs.500/- or perhaps RS.7&amp;0/-. Alternatively an attempt should, i think, be made to observe the provisions of paragraph 8 of Annexure B to Chapter I of the Civil Account Code Volume I and the accountant should furnish a security for Rs.5000/- Id.

As regards A.P.A . Please see pages 1 and 7(a) of file 4/23. Colonel Loch discussed the matter with the Political Resident; but I cannot say for what reason the question was shelved. (See particularly paragraph 3 of the d.o. letter at p. 7(e)). ? : ' a u As regards I.A . I presume the d.o. letter at p. 7(a) is also applicable in this case. The chief objection which Bushire m^y have tsxtios is that the Vernacular Section has alwyys been kept quite separate, both as regards personnel end work, from the English section. The I.A. is the senior icskxr member of the Vernacular section. To overcome the difficulty and to afford the P # A. some relief as regards Treasury work, after discussion between Captain Cole (A.P.A.) and the P.A. (Colonel Loch), Colonel Loch applied for the reorganisation of the English Office (please see correspondence at pages 101 and 114 of file 1/16 — f eji JL' , especiXlMjr para. 6 p. 104 and para*4 on page 115). 25-6-38. A a JZ (J'lyCu. trvJx. tv*' CUyhA iT/.t, ?S- hr &lt;*7 Below application from Vernacular Section for the jzrant of Travelling allowance on leave etc. *. k. Submittedo Supplementary Rule 145 refers for the drawing of travelling allowance when proceeding on or returning from leave, which provides that a Government servant on joining time under Fundamental Rule 105(d) may draw Travelling Allowanceas for the journey as for a journey on transfer* g A _Fundamental Rule I05( ri) Under this Rule Joining time is allowed to a Government servant (i) 10 proceed from a specified station to join a post in a place in a remote locality which ia not easy of access Jem * * (ii) To proceed on relinquishing charge of a post in a place in a remote locality which is not easy of access to a specified station* 3* The Governor General in Council under Fundamental Rule 105 ( d) has specified certain stations which are to he treated 0 as a fixed i^lnt and they are in Supplementary Rule 294-A, which clerly states that the joining time is only admissible to a Governmmmt Servant who is of gennine INDIAN OR EURBPEAN domicile and has been specially recruited outside the remote locality concerned for service there etc. Our vernacular establishment having been therefore recruited locally cannot claim to be of Indian or European domiciley are not entitled to any joining time in which case the question of travelling allowance is automatically extinguished It is alse submitted that even in India the Government servants while proceeding on or returning from leave are not entitled to any joining time or travelling allowance. The concession of drawing travelling allowance granted td Indian establishment serving in the Persian Gulf or Persia is only based on the principle that they have to travel from a fixed point i.e. Karachi or Quetta as the case may be to a station in the remote locality as mentioned in Fundamental Rule 105(d) andr ;I K ■1 2 « and therefore they draw Travelling allowance. In the circumstances the claim of the vernacular establish ment appear to be irrelevant. 22-12-1940. The note ebove explains thoroughly as to why locally recruited establishment cannot draw travelling allowance on leave. They can draw only frxx on transfer. This is very easily explained by the fact that an Indian or European proceeding on leave from (Karachi to Calcutta Karachi to Madras Madras to Calcutta Kashmir to Madras or such remote localities which are exx within India are not entitled to travelling allowance while on leave. I have given the above example merely to show that distances to be travelled by an Indian within India are not less than those referred to in the petition i.e. Kuwait to Muscat. The rule is made for all Government servants hy the Government of India and any alteration or amendment will recuire reference to them by P.R. In my humble opinion no useful purpose will be served by a reference to G. of India as the only reply that could be expected would v e that an Indian clerk going on leave from the Gulf has to pay from his own pocket even if he has to go to Calcutta or Madras. Government pays him upto Karachi only. The distance and expenditure in this case is not less than what a locally recruited hand in the Gulf has to travel and undergo. /iv-c -a- : L' a —i rwf~ t /vtH* hr^A'P.A./A.P.A&gt;/T. O.

Ourb being only a Sub-Treasury, most of the provieione of Chapter 2 of Resource Manual are inapplicable to us, especially those relating to Currency Chest etc. Art.7, however, and Art.9 to some extent, are of general application. With regard to Art.7. The duties oi the Treasurer (as well as of Accountant) are, as you are aware, performed by the Second Clerk (an Upper Division post). The Government money in his charge is normally in the neighbourhood of three thousand rupees, necessary replenishments being obtained from* time to time from the Sub-Postmaster here or by sale of Bank Draft to the local Bank, The nosit ion of the Treasurer here is not quite the same as that of Treasurers (or Shroffs) in India, who are normally^unior officials and often very low-paid and are specially recruited for the work of Treasurer and remain so for long periods. The Treasurer 3 here is an Upper Division icstratxRgXBmaijamxnfcs Clerk ^ , (permanent pensionable) and in entrusting the above amount^ no serious risk seems to be involyed. If necessary, •?rl the balance could perhaps be reduced to a smaller figure. at A^ regards the safety of the place of storage of Government money, the Treasurer’s room does require some attending to. The glass and plywood panes of the shutters make the room unsafe. This could be remedied by fixing an iron-barred shutter in addition to the glass ones, as is the case with the Record Room door. Sanction is requested to have this done as soon as possible Funds are available under the C.C.G. fit rff 1 ^ /?
