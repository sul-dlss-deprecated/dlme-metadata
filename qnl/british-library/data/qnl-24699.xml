In conversation I understood you to say that you were not anxious to enter into a formal written treaty on the subject, but that should application be made to you, you would reply to the ' applicant that you had an agreement with ns which precluded your sanctioning the establishment of a foreign post-office off hand and you would at once refer the question to the British Government.

Cj Q2&gt; l j r L 6f(( I ' D ox V From in the Foreign Department, To political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Dated Fort William, the 15th March 1911. With reference to your letter lo, 2678, dated the 8th WfJ October 1910, on the subject of the means employed by the Turlcish authorities for the exchange of their mails between Gjair and Basrah, I am directed to enquire whether the Vali of Basrah has taken any steps towards resuming the negotiations, initiated by his predecessor, with a view to placing the matter on a more definite looting. The action to be taken by the Government of India would appear to depend to some extent on whether it is possible to retain the postal arrangements in Bahrain exclusively in British hands, as at present. An enquiry into the circumstances, which led to the establishment of an Indian lost Office at Bahrain, shows that in 1875 an arrangement was made with the Native Agent oi the British India Steam Navigation Company at Bahrain, to deliver and collect all ordinary letters for and from British traders at that place. In the course of time this arrangonent proved inadequate, and petitions on the subject were received from the leading merchants of the place. In 1881, the matter was taken up by Colonel Ross, at that time Resident in the Persian Gulf, and it appears that he received a petition irom the Indian merchants and other Indian subjects, residing at Bahrain for the establishment of a regular post O-tice a place. The petition was favourably endorsed oy the Cniei .ar post Office at that ofof Bahrain, and eventually in 1884 a post Office was opened. i;o formal agreement was, however, made with the Shaikh in regard to postal arrangements either at that time or since, and the question now arises whether it would be possible to obtain from the Shaikh an undertaking, such as was given by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1904, not to allow the establishment in his territory of a Post Office by any other Government than the British. 2. I am directed to request that you will telegraph whether jin your opinion ? it is probable that such an agreement could be obtained from the Shaikh without difficulty, should it be decided to ask for it.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram No. 311 of the 9th instant I have the honour to report that from information received from His Majesty’s Consux, Busreh, it would appear that the present Yali has taken no steps tov/ards resuming the negotiations for establishing a mail service between Ojair and Busreh. I hav e, et c., (3d.) P.Z. Cox, Lieut: Colonel, political Resident in the Persian Gulf,CONFIDENTIAL. No. 2678 , dated Bushire, the 8th (received 17 th) October 1910 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Depart ment letter No. 1907-E.B., dated the 30th May 1907, on the subject of the means employed by the Turkish authorities for the exchange of their mails between Ojair and Basrah. 2. Until now, there has been no fresh development needing report to Govern ment and the practice of sending the mail-bags more or less surreptitiously to an agent in Bahrain in boxes by passengers travelling by the British mail steamers has apparently been maintained, the agent being one Yusuf bin Abdur Rahman, a mullah in charge of a mosque in Manama. 3. It appears, however, that the late Vali of Basrah, Suleiman Nazif Bey, seeking to place the matter on a more definite footing, recently approached the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company with a view to their con tracting to carry to and from Bahrain by their fortnightly steamers a Turkish Courier with mail-bags for Ojair. On the point being referred to them, the Indian Postal Authorities point out that such an arrangement would infringe the terms of the company's existing mail contract with the Secretary of State for India, but suggest that the Turkish mails for Ojair might be transmitted between Basrah and Bahrain with the English mails by arrangement with the Indian Post Office, on payment to the latter of the transit rates allowed by the Universal Postal Union. The Postmaster-General, Bombay, having enquired from the Resi dent at Baghdad, whether there was any political objection to such an arrange ment, the latter passed the reference on to His Majesty's Consul at Basrah who having again ascertained the Ambassador's views, sends the papers on to me. His Majesty's Ambassador sees no objection to the Post Office proposal, but Yali Suleiman Nazif Bey having been recalled in the meanwhile, the matter is now in abeyance pending resumption of the negotiations by his successor. 4. If it was realized, it was not brought out in the correspondence of 1905-06, that the Ottoman Post Office is entitled if it wishes to use any British contract packet for the conveyance of its mails under the conditions laid down in the Postal Union Convention ; but apart from that, the offer now made by the Indian Post Office is precisely the same as that made in pursuance of Foreign Department letter No. 4476, dated the 7th December 1905, to my address. At that time the Turkish authorities made no response to the offer, doubtless because what they desired, and probably desire now, is some arrangement independent of our Post Office ; and Mr. Crow thought it best, having once made the offer, not to refer to the subject, for the reasons stated in his letter enclosed with my report No. 65 of 23rd February 1906. It seems hardly likely that they will behave differently now, but in case they have changed their views and do accept our sugges tion, it will be as well to consider one or two points which suggest themselves in connection with the arrangement proposed. 5. Firstly, the question of the mail agent for Ojair. No mention is made in the papers now sent me by Mr. Crow, as to how the Turkish authorities propose to handle the mail-bags after their arrival in the British Post Office at Bahrain. Unless Messrs. Gray, Paul act as agents, as was formely suggested (an arrange ment unlikely to be acceptable to the Turkish authorities), it is obviously necessary that there should be some responsible person to receive the incoming mail-bags from the British Postmaster and deliver outgoing ones, and unless the man can come up each time from Ojair, the official recognition by us of a Turkish Mail Agent at Bahrain will presumably be necessary. In this connection, it will be seen that in expressing my views to the Govern ment of India on 30th July 1905,1 did not favour the location of the official at Bahrain, but suggested that he should reside at Ojair and come upas necessary for the mails. Subsequently, however, when it was found that Mulla Yusuf bin C 1009 FD2 2 Abdar Rahman was acting as a Turkish Postal Agent and was not giving any trouble, the Government of India agreed that although the appointment of a salaried postal official at Bahrain without reference to the Shaikh or ourselves was a proceeding to which exception might well be taken, it would not be politic under the circumstances, to take any objection to or cognizance of his presence as long as the man confined himself to his duties and did not attempt to usurn anv diplomatic status in regard to the Shaikh. ^ If, however, the present proposals take shape, we can no longer shut our eyes to the appointment, and I therefore venture to suggest that if His Majesty's Gov ernment see no objection, and if it transpires that the Vali does desire to keep a postal officm! at Bahrain and not at Ojair, the Porte should be informed that we shall be glad to advise the Shaikh to concur on the understanding that the agent will confine himself strictly to his mail-forwarding duties and will under no circum stances make any delivery of letters in Bahrain. Some stipulation in the latter sense seems a necessary corollary to our official recognition of the agent, otherwise there would appear to be nothing to prevent the iurkish mail-bags being used for the despatch of postal articles between Basrah and Bahrain to the prejudice of our own Post Office on the ground that now that they have an official arrangement for the transmission of letters to Bahrain it is not fair that the Turkish Post Office should be deprived of income which should properly help to defray the transit charges of the service and the cost of entertaining a Mail Agent at Bahrain. Having regard to the successful invasion in recent years by the Persian Government of the privileges enioved bv us in the British Post Office at Persian Ports, one cannot but be somewhat apprehensive similar enterprise on the part of the Ottoman postal authorities. T U n ^ SU , bE 1 idia r y P 0 ' 1 ?*’ but one which is sure to be raised later on, and on which 1 shall be glad to have the views of Government, is as to the extent to which the Turkish Mail Agent at Bahrain if recognized, will be entitled to fly the Ottoman Hag. shaikh Esa would strongly object I am sure to his doing more than use it that^tittude 7 takm8 mallS t0 ^ 110111 steamers&gt; andI trust can be supported in The flying of the Turkish flag by a soi-disant agent at Lingah has been a constant source of vexation and correspondence, owing to the persistent endea vours of the individual concerned to attempt to force his protection upon subjects of Kuwait, Bahrain and the Trucial Coast, and to other anti-British vagaries and I should greatly deprecate a repetition of the evil in Bahrain.

We have the honour to inform you that the Vali of Basrah is arranging for a regular post between Basrah and Ojair and has approached the company with regard to carriage of same from Basrah and Bahrain via Bushire.

His Majesty s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. No. 52. Sir, August 27th, 1910. I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of correspondence forwarded to me by the British Resident at Baghdad, relative to the proposal to utilise the British India steamers for the Turkish postal service to Ojair via Bahrain and to enquire whether Your Excellency sees any objection to the proposed arrangement This question was raised in 1905 and formed the subject of my despatches to Mr. Crow, 36 , June is, 1906 . the Embassy as marginally noted. In Sir 6i, August io, 1906. Mackenzie s letter of September 13,1905, 60, September 16,1905. to the Foreign Office enclosed in the 7 7 2 ,' ^nua^lim 5 ' Embassy despatch to me of October 5, 1905, _ . . . , . . it was thought practicable to send the lurkish post bag with our own to Bahrain and for the British India Agents there to receive the Ojair bag from and deliver it to the British Post Office at Bahrain, provided the Turkish authorities agreed to bear the expense of dhow transport between Bahrain and Ojair. 1 The British Resident at Bushire, as reported in my despatch No. 7 of January 26, 1906, to the Embassy, informed me that the Government of India approved the proposal that the Turkish mails for Ojair should be sent with our own to Bahrain, where they could be taken over by a Turkish official who would make his own arrangements as regards Ojair. The Postmaster-General at Bombay now enquires whether there is any objec tion to the Indian Post Office allowing mails for and from Ojair being conveyed between Basrah and Bahrain by the British India steamers. I see no local objection and I think we can but gain by such an arrangement, as it would secure fixed communication with Hasa and would obviate any incon venience, which might arise from an attempt by the Turks to establish a direct ser vice of their own and possibly the presence of Turkish vessels in Bahrain waters. Before, however, expressing any opinion on the subject, I have the honour torefer the matter for Your Excellency’s consideration. As the British India Company are precluded by their mail contract from complying with the Vali’s proposal on the lines suggested by him, perhaps the Minister of Tosts will authorize the Vali to enter into a formal arrangement with the Indian Post Office for the purpose. I have, etc., (Sd.) F. E. CROW. His Majesty s Consul, Basrah, to the Postmaster-General, Bombay. No. 27. August 27,1910.

The question formed the subject of correspondence between this Consulate, the Government of India and His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople in 1905, and I am now referring your letter and enclosures to His Majesty’s Ambassador for consideration. I think it will be necessary to consult the Minister of Posts at Constantinople before any formal arrangement can be made for the purpose with the Indian Post Office. On receipt of His Majesty’s Ambassador’s reply I will communicate my obser vations through the British Resident in the Persian Gulf who is also interested in the matter. I have, etc., • (Sd.) F. E.

The continued despatch of Turkish mail-bags by British mail-steamers, more or less surreptitiously, as passengers’ private baggage, and the location of a salaried postal official at Bahrein without reference to ourselves or the ruling Sheikh whom we protect, can hardly be considered compatible with the canons of the Postal Union, to which Turkey belongs, or with the principles of inter national usage ; but as it would appear that from a political point of view the arrangement in question is to be preferred to the possible alternative discussed two years ago, namely, the inauguration of Turkish Steamship Company for the Arab Coast Service, it hardly seems necessary for us to take any action in the matter, especially as the procedure followed by the Basra authorities does not appear to exercise the British India Steam Navigation Company in any way.

Bags from Katif on the one side and from Basra on the other are brought to him periodically either by respectable native gentlemen who may be travelling as passengers on their own business and can be trusted by the Turkish Autho rities, or, when such persons are not forthcoming, by paid servants, travelling as ordinary deck passengers. These bags are sent on by Abdur Rahim to their . _ tr .. . respective destinations by steameror sail- ror only. *«i ing boat* in a similar manner with the least possible delay. 3. For the service between Hafuf and Bahrein, a special sailing-boat has been purchased for about Rs. 800 which has a permanent crew and plies regular ly between Manama and Ojair each week. Passengers and cargo are also carried in this vessel in the ordinary course. 4.

No. 289, dated the 28th May 1906. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you in compliance with your request for a report on the subject of the Turkish Government’s arrangements for the conveyance of their mails between Busrah and the “ Sanjak of Nejd” (Hasa and Katif). 2. I am informed that the system of sending the mails by British Mail Steamer between Busrah and Bahrein and by sailing boat between Bahrein and the two ports of the Sanjak was instituted at an early period after the conquest of the Province in 1871, and that the selection of the forwarding Agent in Bahrein to deal witli the mails has been generally left to the Governor (Mutessarif) of the Sanjak. The Kaimmakam of Katif is the Mutessarif’s subordinate ; there is not therefore much official correspondence between Katif and Busrah ; in fact only one department in Busrah, that of the Ottoman Public Debt (Dyun Umumiya), is believed to have direct relations with Katif. 3. When Seyed Talib was Mutessarif, the official Postal Agent in Bahrein was Haji Mujbil al Dhakair. Subsequently, the Agent was a Mulla of a Mosque in Manama, named Yusuf bin Abdul Rahman. The persons to whom the Bahrein Agent addressed and from whom he received mails—sent under special precautions in sailing boats, which were also allowed to carry passengers—were ordinarily the Mudir of Ojair for Hasa mails, and the Mudir of the “ Dyun Umumiya” in Katif. 4. Some 18 months ago the Postmaster of the British Indian Sub-Post Office in Bahrein discovered that the Turkish Agent, with a view to reducing expenses, had commenced to despatch the mails (both official and private) in packages by Parcel Post, and it was also suspected that he was even collect ing letters in Bahrein for inclusion in the same packages. It was pointed out to the same Agent that these practices were contraventions of the Postal Rules and he then attempted to book a package as cargo with the Mail Steamer Agents, but was refused shipment on the contents becoming known. 5. It is believed, after this, that for some weeks the Postal Agent sent and received mails under the guise of personal baggage of travellers, who were specially paid for the service, but this procedure did not remain long in force, and for about the last 9 months, or more, no articles for Busrah from Hasa and vice versd have been known to have travelled by the Bahrein route, though official letters between Katif and Busrah are still registered and dealt with. It seems probable that the plan of sending mails overland between Koweit and Hasa was calculated to be cheaper and attended with less division of respon sibility than the Bahrein-Ojair arrangement, and that the new system was brought into effect chiefly inconsequence of these considerations. 6. It is possible also that other considerations exist, in the notorious in security of the Ojair-Hasa route and in the policy of bringing gradually all the country between Koweit and Hasa under Turkish influence. co2 7. For the last-named reason, I think it would be advantageous if the Turkish Government could be induced officially to renew their patronage of the Bahrein route, and I do not see much difficulty in the way, if they would consent to establish regular post offices in Ojair, Hasa and Katif, and to make a P ermanent arrangement for the conveyance of the mails between the Sanjak brts and Bahrein, just as we have a contract for the carriage of mails between Bahrein and Busrah, etc. 8. The only stipulation we should make would be that articles intended for Hasa and Katif should be posted in the existing Indian Offices such as those at Busrah and Baghdad. The revenue, then, on mails carried from the latter ports to the Sanjak would come to our Postal Department, while the revenue from articles posted in the Sanjak Post Offices would accrue to the Turkish Government. We could not, of course, permit the establishment of a Turkish Post office in Bahrein, and all mails intended for and coming from the Sanjak Offices would be exchanged in sealed mail bags between those offices and our post office in this Island.

From the Political Agent’s report the position would appear to be that the Turkish postal authorities, through the medium of the Koweit shop-keeper Muhammad bin Bashayyar Hassawai, are availing themselves of the hereditary runners who ply between Koweit and A1 Hassa as a private enterprise, for getting their mail bag through to A1 Hassa. As a postal service this is a some what crude arrangement, but it appears to have satisfied the Wali of Basrah for the present, and Mr. Crow thinks it best to let things stand as they are until the latter moves in the matter again. 3.

I do not quite understand from the correspondence on record whether the fact is that the Turkish runner passes through the hinterland at some distance from Koweit but within Sheikh Mubarak’s sphere, and that Sheikh Mubarak guarantees his immunity through that sphere, or whether the courier actually passes through Koweit, and is forwarded on by some Agent of tlu&gt; Turkish post.

I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence between us ending with your endorsement of 11th November last giving cover to your telegram No. 57 and letter No. 72 to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, regard- g the Basrah-A1 Hassa mail. I had hoped to bring the papers over to Basrah in order to be able to scuss them with you at the meeting which we contemplated a ew ays a 0 o, it having been disappointed of that, I now address you on the su jec . Writing under date 7 th December, the Foreign Secretary to the Govern- ent of India, after informing me that the British India Steam aviga ion impany had intimated their inability to establish a service wi jeir on 6148 f. u. -i /6 2 s v. their present subsidy or under other existing conditions, reverts to the alter native proposal originally made by you in which I concurred. This was, you will remember, that the Turkish mails for Ojeir should be made over to the British Post Office at Basrah, and be conveyed along with our own mails by fast steamer to Bushire and thence by fortnightly steamer to Bahrein where they would be taken over by an Ottoman official who would make his own arrangements for forwarding them to Ojeir. I am desired to inform you that this arrangement commends itself to the Government of India, and that so far as they are concerned, there is no objec tion to its being introduced as soon as may be found convenient by the Turkish authorities. I note in this connection that the British India Steam Navigation Company have suggested that their Agent in Bahrein could arrange for the regular despatch and receipt of the Turkish bag to and from Ojeir. In pursuance of the above, I request that you will he good enough to communicate with me in due course, for the information of the Government of India, the ultimate decision of the Turkish authorities both in regard to this A1 Ilassa mail question, and also with reference to the contemplated Turkish steamer service, the establishment of which was mooted in connection therewith. • No. 36 , dated the 7 th February 1906 (Confidential), From— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to reply to your letter No. 129, dated the 21st January 1906, on the subject of the Turkish post between Basrah and A1 Hassa. 2. I have learnt that there lives in Zubair a Turkish postal agent, an Arab of the family of Ash-Shabeybi. The family is, I am told, also represented in A1 Hassa. It appears that the ordinary Turkish post runs between Basrah and Zubair and that the Government bags for A1 Hassa are handed over to the Shabeybi agent. He entrusts them to Ahmed and Othman, sons of the family of A1 Mazyad and natives of Koweit. These men have been what I may call the hereditary postal carriers between Koweit and Basrah and they bring the post to Koweit, handing it over to Muhammad-bin- Bashayyar who is a Hassawi shop-keeper who has been living in Koweit for the past 30 years. Private letters destined for A1 Hassa, as well as the Turkish Government mails, are also deposited in his house. There is no question of stamps, post marks or other formalities. Muhammad bin Bashayyar in his turn hands over the^ letters to the Hassa runners, one of whom is Abdul Hadi-ul-Gassas, an ordinary Bedouin of the Umtair tribe and two are of the Ajman tribe ; they take the letters on to A1 Hassa. Thus the already existing arrangements are primitive and what appears to have happened is that the Turkish Postmaster at Basrah has taken advantage of them to forward the Turkish mail bags. Since the arrival of the British India mail is so uncertain, I am thinking of making a similar arrangement for my own weekly mail bags, when the steamer does not call here. 3. Muhammad bin Bashayyar has come before me and explained his position without reserve or hesitation. He says he is a sub-agent of Shabeybi and looks to him for pay and that he was only concerned with the Govern ment mail bags and letters for Hassa. With private letters between Basrah and Koweit he had nothing to do and I must refer to the sons of A1 Mazyad. If I may believe him, this informal postal arrangement dates from the time the Turks took A1 Hassa, but he mentioned that the Wali was dissatisfied with the existing arrangements, and was inclined to prefer a sea route, in which case his occupation would be gone. 4. I could ask Sheikh Mubarak what his precise connection is with regard to these mails, but I can already anticipate his answer, viz., that the postal contractor asked him whether it would be safe to send the mails in this way, and that Sheikh Mubarak replied that he would guarantee their safety in his3 territory. If there is any more precise connection or promise, which I doubt, Sheikh Mubarak will probably not inform me of it. No. 2, dated the 26 th January 1906 . From—F. E. Crow, Egq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Basrah, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your letter No. 130 of the 21st instant, I have the honour to inform you that up to the pr'eserTf I have received no reply from Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company regarding the cost of buggalow hire between Bahrein and Ojeir. I do not think the Vali is anxious to adopt my proposal to avail himself of the services of the British Post Office in the matter. The Hassa Post, as previously explained, has lately been conveyed by way of Koweit. Captain Knox informs me that the camel post between Koweit and Hassa has been established for many years. I was unaware of this. But, as it is so, the linking up of the connection with Basrah and the establishment of a regular service overland would have its attractions for the Turks. The Vali is very reserved on the subject, and I do not desire to take the initiative unless I am instructed to do so. From Sir G. Mackenzie's letter to Mr. Villiers of September 13th last, it appears that his firm at Bahrein would make arrangements for conveying the post to Ojeir, if required to do so and to obviate any objection to the presence of an Ottoman official at Bahrein. From your letter, now under reply, I gather that the Government of India has no such objection, and the good offices of the firm at Bahrein, therefore, would not appear to be required. I learn lately the Hassa Post was conveyed by a Zaptieh, who left on the mail steamer for Maskat, intending to tranship there for Bahrein and make his own arrangements between Bahrein and Ojeir. I am informed he received five Turkish liras for the trip. The Vali has already been offered the services of the British Post Office, and, unless he re-opens the question, I think it is as well to let matters stand as they are. Any question relating to foreign post offices in Turkey brings us on to delicate ground as the Turks are inclined to resent their establishment and to limit their operations as much as possible. I have heard nothing more about the proposed Turkish steamer service in the Gulf, and I do not think the Turks have any money at their disposal to carry out the project. The Vali, I believe, applied for permission to send the “ Baghdadi, ” one of the Hamidieh river steamers, to Katif, but it does not appear to have been given as the vessel is still on the Baghdad-Basrah run.Register No. F M v* ^ Minute Paper. siln^. secret Department.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 098 of the 10th ultimo, I have the honour to report that the new arrangements relative to the conveyance of the llassa mail via Koweit appear to be in force. His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah reports that the post arrived at that place on the 2nd instant, having been carried for the first time via Koweit, and that the journey from Hassa to Bussorah occupied fourteen days. It is reported that the journey was only a tentative one, and that the postmanl was engaged by the Mutessarif of llassa—the Sheikh of Koweit having, according to| the Contractor’s statement, guaranteed the safety of the post across the desert. Mr. Crow is proposing to the Turkish authorities the adoption of the alternative route proposed by Sir George Mackenzie, and mentioned in your Lordship’s despatch No. 319 of the 26th September, but it appears doubtful whether it would be preferred to the present arrangement.

I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit herewith, for the information of* the Secretary of State for India, copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople relative to a proposed Turkish steamship line to ports in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. I am to request that Lord Lansdowne may be favoured with Mr. Brodrick’s observations on the suggestions made by His Majesty’s Consul at Basra as to changes which might, in consequence, be made in the British India Steamship Company’s mail service.

Having had my attention drawn to paragraphs which have appeared in the local press during the past six weeks to the effect that the Yali of Basra was trying to obtain the sanction of the Porte for the creation of a line of steamers for service to the ports of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, I requested Mr. Consul Crow to make enquiries locally and report to me what he knew of the matter. Mr. Crow has replied by telegraph that the Steamship Company which the Yali has asked the authority of the Grand Yizier to create is intended to work between Basra, Jeddah and Constantinople, and to carry the Turkish mails for the province of Hassa. Apart indeed from the commercial advantages involved, the main object of the scheme is believed by Mr. Crow to be to facilitate Turkish communications with that part of the Persian Gulf through Ojeir and thence via Hofuf with the Nejd. Mr. Crow suggests that it would perhaps be expedient in the circumstances if the mail service to Ojeir were undertaken by the British India Steamship Company, or if that port is too far from the route of their steamers, that the carriage of the mails for the mainland were arranged for by them as far as Bahrein where they now call, and suggests that he might discuss the question with the Company’s Agents at Basra. Although I do not myself expect that much will result from the scheme put forward by the Yali of Basra, I see no objections to offer to Mr. Crow’s suggestion that the British India Steamship Company’s vessels should call at Ojeir, where their appearance would have a good effect politically, but I hesitate to instruct him to approach the Company on the subject,'until I can learn the views of your Lordship and of the India Office.I lia\ o requested jVTr.

The Yah states that the commercial advantages to be derived from the scheme are great, and such as will induce merchants here to subscribe to it. It is proposed to begin with one steamer and to acquire a second at the end of six months, and to increase the number it the undertaking prospers. . T1,e 1 present postal arrangements between Basra and Hassa are irregular and unsatisfactory. I am informed that the Turks farm out the mail contract to an individual here and pay him about £T18 a month. The Turkish bag is sometimes handed ‘to the British India pilot tor delivery at Bahrein, and sometimes committed to the care of Native passengers proceeding to Hassa. There is no established mail service between Basra and Oieir on the Hassa coast. J I think it would be expedient if the British India Company con tracted with the Turkish Government for the carriage of the'Hassa mail. I understand that the Yali of Basra is prepared to discuss the subject, and that some arrangement could he made. According to present arrangements the British India Company send a slow boat fortnightly from Bushire to Bahrein and vice versd. Mails from Basra to Bahrein can he sent by fast mail weeklv to Bushire, and thence fortnightly by the slow boat referred to above to Bahrein. If the Turks will avail themselves of this service, it will not pre- sumably entail much extra expense or trouble on the Company apart from the care of and the responsibility for the carriage and delivery of the lurkish bags. If the connection at Bushire were missed, as often occurs, the bags would he consigned to the care of the British Post Office there, which would retain them until an opportunity for forwarding them occurred. The Company would not, I think, accept S. 31. Bthe responsibility of lioldin' over the has^s at Bushire themselves pending the arrival of the boat for Bahrein. In short, the Turkish hags would receive the same treatment as our own. At Bahrein the hags would presumably be treated in the same way as the English mail, i.c., delivered to the British Post Office. There may be objections to this system, as it would necessitate the presence of an Ottoman official at Bahrein who would undertake the carriage of the bags to Ojeir. To obviate this inconvenience I would suggest, as an alternative, that the British India Company should undertake the carriage of the Turkish mads to Ojeir, and that their slow boat should call there after leaving Bahrein. The navigation in these waters is. I believe, difficult, and it seems doubtful whether the boat could proceed to Ojeir in the night time. It might involve two days’ deflection from the present course, and, as the Persian Gulf Service is run so fine, it might entail the necessity for an additional boat. These arc questions which the British India Company must themselves decide. The Vali has requested me to make enquiries. The sum at the disposal of the Ottoman Government for the purpose is not large, hut if they come to terms with the British India Company in the matter, I think we cannot but gain by it, and a suitable arrangement would obviate any inconvenience which might arise from the 'establishment of a direct Turkish service to Ojeir and the presence of Turkish vessels in Bahrein waters.

The Postmaster-General duly received your letter of the 21st ultimo enclosing a copy of a report from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople relative to a scheme proposed to the Porte by the Yali of Basra for the institution of a steamship service between Basra, Jeddah, and Constantinople, which, it is believed, would be used for conveying the Turkish mails for the Province of Hassa and for facilitating communication with Ojeir, Hofuf, and the INejd. In reply, I am to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs, that under present arrangements any correspondence for Ojeir would he despatched hence in the mails for the Ottoman Post Office at Constantinople, but that, as a matter of fact, there is no recollection of the receipt in this Office of anv correspondence addressed either to Ojeir or to Hofuf and the Nejd. In these circumstances, it does not seem likely that, from the point of view of this Department, any advantages would accrue to the postal service if the British India Steam Navigation Company made Ojeir one of the ports of call of their ships ; but it is, of course,'possible that the Indian Government, which controls the Company’s packet service to the Persian Gulf, may view the question in a different light. It is observed that the India Office is being consulted on the matter, and the Postmaster-General would be interested to learn the views entertained in that quarter.

In the course of conversation with the Yali yesterday I touched on the question of the llassa mail service, and expressed my willingness to put forward any proposal his Excellency had to make lor the consideration of the British India Company. The Yali said that what he wanted was a regular service irom Basra to Oieir on the Hassa coast and vice versa. I suggested that he should avail himself of the present fortnightly service, Bushire-Bahrem, and arrange with the British India Company for the extension ot this service to Ojeir for the purpose. The Vali asked me to submit this proposal, and to enquire what the cost would be to the Irakis i G °According to the latest Confidential Chart prepared by the “Investigator” in 1901-02, the coast has been surveyed to within 81 miles °in a due north line from Ojeir.

At present the Turks pay 2,000 piastres a month to a native, and the service is very irregular and unsatisfactory. They would be willing to pay more to ensure its regularity.

I have the honour to inform the Marquess of Lansdowne that the subject of landing the Turkish mail hag from Busreh at Ojeir is having the attention of my firm at Busreh, who have already made the required representation to the Managing Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company in India, and his Lordship may rest assured that every effort will he made to further the expressed wishes of His Majesty’s Consul and the Turkish authorities. I fear, however, it will not he possible for mail steamers to proceed to Ojeir, for I observe from the Admiralty Chart that the approach to Ojeir has not been surveyed, and is known to he obstructed fiy many reefs rendering navigation in those waters more or less dangerous. I would suggest that the Turkish post hag should accompany the Consular mails to Bahrein, and to obviate any objection to the presence of an Ottoman official at Bahrein to receive and despatch the mails, my firm there will, if required to do so, he pleased to receive the Ojeir hag from, and deliver to, the British Post Office at Bahrein free of charge, provided the Turkish authorities will bear all costs and expenses of transport by dhow between Bahrein and Ojeir.

According to the latest Confidential Chart pre pared by the •Investigator' in 1901-1902 the coast has been surveyed to within miles in a due North line from Ojeir.

I have the honour to report that the creation of a Turkish Steamship Company on the Persian Gulf is being considered by the Ottoroan Government. .The proposals put forward by the Vali of Basra and sub mitted by him to the Grand Vizier are:- (1) to establish a direct line between Basra, Jeddah and Constantinople for facilitating Government business and promoting trade and (2) to organise a direct postal service be tween Basra and Hassa, which would be undertaken by the new line. The Vali states that the comnercial advantages to be derived from the scheme are great and such as will induce merchants here to subscribe to it. It is proposed to begin with one steamer and to acquire a second at the end of 6 months and to increase the number Secretary to the Foreign Department, «•—. Government of India. /number if the undertaking prospers. The present postal arrangements between Basra and Hassa are irregular and unsatisfactory. I am informed that the Turks farm out the mall contract to an Individual here and pay him about £T18 a month. The Turkish bag is sometimes handed to the British India pilot for delivery at Bahrein and sometimes / committed to the care of native passengers proceeding to Hassa. There is no established mail service between Basra and Ojeir on the Hassa coast. I think it would he expedient if the British India Company contracted with the Turkish Government for the carriage of the Hassa mail. I understand that the Vali of Basra is prepared to discuss the subject and that some arrangement could be made. According to present arrangements the British India Company send a slow boat fortnightly from Bushire to Bahrein and vice versa. Mails from Basra to Bahrein can be sent by fast mail weekly to Bushire and thence fortnightly by the slow boat re ferred r\ vireferred to above to Bahrein. If the Turks will avail themselves of this ser vice it will not presumably entail much extra ex- ■r pense or trouble on the Company apart from the care of and the responsibility for the carriage and deliv ery of the Turkish bags. If the connection at Bush- ire were missed, as often occurs, the bags would be consigned to the care of the British Post Office there, which would retain them until an opportunity for forwarding them occurred. The Company would not, I think, accept the responsibility of holding over the bags at Bushire themselves pending the arrival of the boat for Bahrein. In short, the Turkish bags '— T would receive the same treatment as our own. At Bahrein the hags would presumably he treated in the same way as the English mall i.e. delivered to the British Post Office. There may he objections to this system, as it would necessitate the presence of an Ottoman official at Bahrein who would under- take the carriage of the hags to Ojeir. To obviate this inconvenience I would suggest. shouldafter leaving Bahrein. The navigation in these waters is, I believe, difficult and it seems doubtful whether the boat could proceed to Ojeir in the night time. It might involve two days deflection from the present course and, as the Persian Gulf service is run so fine, it might entail the necessity for an additional boat. These are questions which the British India Company must themselves decide. The Vali has requested me to make enquiries. The sum at the disposal of the Ottoman Government for the purpose is not large, but if they come to terms with the British India Company in the matter, I think we cannot but gain by it, and a suitable ar rangement would obviate any inconvenience which might]!KJh i si) i) G ^ The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith &gt;p*f of the nnder-mentioned paper relative to jy&amp;Ar X Ajr . /’r »af f!*^*^*^* *’ * .

In reply I am to acquaint you, for the informa tion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that under present arrangements any correspondence for Ojeir would be despatched hence in the mails for the Ottoman Post Office at Constantinople, but that, as a matter of fact, there is no recollection of the receipt in this Office of any correspondence address ed ie Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.addressed either to Ojelr or to Hoxuf and the Nejd. In these circumstances it does not seem likely that, from the point of view of this Department, any advantages would accrue to the postal service if the British India Steam Navigation Company made Ojeir one of the ports of call of their ships; hut it is of course possible that the Indian Government, which controls the Company's Packet service to the Persian Gulf, may view the question in a different light. It is observed that the India Office is being con sulted on the matter, and the Postmaster General would be interested to learn the views entertained in that quarter. I am &amp;c.. (S i gned) H.

A T H E R A P I A, •Tune 12 th, 1905. % Lord:- Having had my attention drawn to para graphs which have appeared in the local press during the past six weeks to the effect that the Vali of Basra was trying to obtain the sanction of the Porte for the creation of a line of steamers for service to the ports of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, I requested Mr. Consul Crow to make enquiries local ly and report to me what he knew of the matter. Mr. Crow has replied by telegraph that the Steam ship Company which the Vali has asked the authority of the Grand Vizier to create is intended to work between Basra, Jeddah and Constantinople and to carry the Turkish mails for the province of Hassa. Apart indeed from the commercial advan tages involved, the main object of the scheme is be lieved by Mr. Crow to be to facilitate Turkish com munications with that part of the Persian Gulf through Ojeir The Marquess of Lansdcwne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,Ojeir and thence via Hofuf with the Nejd. Mr. Crow suggests that it v/ould perhaps he ex pedient in the circumstances if the mail service to Ojeir were undertaken hy the British India Steamship Company, or if that port is too far from the route of their steamers, that the carriage of the mails for the mainland were arranged for hy them as far as Bahrein where they now call,and suggests that he might discuss the question with the Company's Agents at Basra. Although I do not myself expect that much will result from the scheme put forward hy the Vali of Basra, I see no objections to offer to Mr, Crow's suggestion that the British India Steamship Com pany's vessels should call at Ojeir, where their ap pearance would have a good effect politically,hut I hesitate to instruct him to approach the Company on the subject, until I can learn the views of Your Lordship and of the India Office. I have requested Mr.Crow to report to the Gov ernment of India on the question. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) N.R.
