IN reply to your telegram No. 344 of the 20th instant on the subject of the demolition last year of buildings at Bagdad the property of British subjects, I have the honour to report as follows :— l r ou, Sir, will remember that Nazim Pasha, after a somewhat brief occupancy of the post of Vali of. Bagdad, was withdrawn, and an enquiry was instituted which has just terminated, but the result of which is not yet definitely known, as to whether the accusations against him were founded or not- I repeatedly urged Rifaat Pasha to settle the question of our claims for the demolition of the property of British subjects, and he several times assured me that the new Governor had been instructed to examine the matter and report. I concluded that this implied a joint examination with His Majesty’s consul-general, and 1 informed that officer that the new vali had been so instructed, but, on the latter’s arrival at Bagdad, he informed Mr. Lorimer that he had no such instructions. Rifaat Pasha having then left, I enquired of the Grand Vizier what instructions had been given to the vali, and his Highness said that his intention had not been that a joint enquiry should take place, but that the vali should, after examination of the question, report to him, and his Highness added that he then hoped he would be able to find a solution. A few days ago I again enquired of his Highness whether this report had come, and I observed that a one-sided examination could hardly produce a satisfactory result, and I reminded his Highness that under instructions from you last year I had pointed out that, after what had occurred, little reliance could be placed on the justice of the local administration, and also that no lawyer could be found to undertake a case against the local government. The new Governor has been but a short time in Bagdad, and the municipality has evidently no funds at its disposal. It would seem, therefore, advisable to await the result of the Governor’s enquiries and possibty some proposal for payment from the Sublime Porte. The difficulty in which the latter find themselves is that, if the municipality pays the British subjects the compensation due to them, the Ottoman subjects who likewise suffered and who are far more numerous will naturally claim on the municipality, a contingency the Grand Vizier seems to wish to avoid by settling the matter here. His Highness recently observed that Nazim Pasha had been of opinion that the property left to the British subjects who had suffered would now rise so much in value as to leave them with bat little loss. This, I said, might or might not be the case. The fact remained that the authorities had acted arbitrarily and in contravention of the expropriation laws, and the sufferers must be compensated. His Highness also added that he had given categorical instructions to the new vali to entertain the most friendly relations with the British consul-general and to avoid the raising of questions. The claim of the ice merchant for 228Z. has also occupied my attention on several occasions, but has not yet been settled, no doubt owing to the same reason, an entire absence of funds in the municipality coffers. Recently renewed attempts were made to arbitrarily reduce the cost of ice sold by the merchant in question on fe the ground that ice w r as a necessity, and an endeavour was also made to compel him to take out a licence, but this does not appear under the law to be a necessity, and, on my representations, the Grand Vizier sent satisfactory instructions on both these points. The important question of the recognition of British certificates of registration has engaged the constant attention of the embassy since Dr. Scott first reported it at the end of June. Both the administrative and judicial authorities of Bagdad have now been instructed to admit these certificates without any Turkish legalisation, unless the circumstances are such as to justify a real doubt as to the nationality. The wording of the qualification is not entirely satisfactory, but I trust that the instructions will [2180 ee—1]suffice to obviate any serious difficulty in the case of British subjects generally. The details of the particular cases complained of by Mr. Lorimer have only just reached me, and I am now considering what action can usefully be taken on behalf of the individual British Indians concerned. Mr. Lorimer appears to -write under the impression that the illegalities an(V vexatious proceedings are specially directed against British subjects. This is not, 1 believe, the case. All my colleagues have similar complaints to make, and they are, I think, in a great measure the result of a strong nationalist feeling to whicli often incapable Government officials have to pander in order to be able to maintain their posts in the provinces, and also due to the fact that for the past two years no strong Government has existed at Constantinople. The “ gang of irresponsible political adventurers,” as Mr. Lorimer calls them, have no doubt caused an immense amount of harm to the new regime in this country, but the well-wishers of Turkey are inclined to the belief that their influence is on the wane, and that, with their disappearance or with a modification of their views, a saner policy and one by which the interests of British subjects in Mesopotamia will suffer less will obtain. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.4 lit]/' 0 !u(^jD From Viceroy, 12th October 1911. f Foieign Secret Situation at Bagdad. Please see Lord Minto’s telegram a August 19 and Lori mer’s letters 595 of 17th July last, and 694 of *-• Sent ^ nc ^ a Foreign Secretary’s weekly letters o 7th August and 7tli September ultimo. Apparently no progress has been made m settlement of Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.’s claim and obstructive attitude of local iurkish officials continues. The new Mali has retained JNazirn 1 asha s municipal engineer, and has announced his intention of makuig a great street through centre of town. Lorimer has reason to believe Vaii intends proceeding with his predecessor’s programme of municipal improvements, and that this will involve further surrender of Lynch’s area and it is rumoured that British Residency premises will also be divided by road. Ambassador informed Lorimer that newYali had received instructions to report on British claims for compensation, but Vali denies this. Other instances of the Turkish unfriendly attitude are cited in Lorimer’s letters above mentioned, and I am inclined to share his views that these various attacks upon our interests are deliberate and pre-arranged with approval of lurkish Grovernment. The demand which Sir G. Lowther was instructed in Apnl last to make for compensation to natives of Bahrein illegally detained by \ ah of Basrah has also apparently not been met. 1 venture strongly to urge on His Majesty’s Government the great desirability of bringing pressure to bear on Turkish Government with a view to settlement of out standing cases, and the restoration of British prestige. Failing this and a satisfactory conclusion of the larger pending negotiations with the Porte, I foresee necessity of vindicating our position in the Persian Gulf during ensuing cold weather. &amp;* m To J.

I have the honour to be, oir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- J. G. Lorimer, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and H.B.M's Consul General, Baghdad.British Beaidanoj &amp; Consulate General, ■ Baghdad,14th August 1911. Your Excellency, I have the honour to bring to notice two cases, affecting British subjects in the Baghdad Wilayat, in which an important question of principle has been raised, - that of the effect of tho registration of British subjects as such by British Con sular authority. v. £..I A 3 .T CASE. One *Abbas,son of Ghulam Husain, a registered British subject, was arrested at Tawairij by the Turkish authorities on or about the 26th March, apparently on e charge of theft, and brought to Karbala. His father, Ghulam Husain, was accepted as a British sub ject by the British Consular Agent at Karbala in 1895, and ’Abbas was then included in his father’s registration and shown as a child 4 years of ago. After Ghulam Husain’s death, which occurred some years ago, the name of ’Abbas, who was still a minor, was entered in the certificate of his olderc£&gt; brother *&lt;{uhammad 'All, until the ?lst February 1911, irhen, having come of age, he was granted a personal certificate of registration by the British 77 ice-Consul at Karbala. ihe British Vice-Consul on becoming aware of 'Abbas's arrest, at once sent to the Examining Magistrate of Karbala to know Js.«w the cause, end the charge against him. The reply was that the Court of ^osting Charges at Baghdad had ordered the arrest, from which it would appear that there had been previous proceedings in the case, and that the Vice-Consul haa been kept in ignorance of them. The reasons given for not informing the Vice-Consulate of the arrest, etc., were that 'Abbas could not be recognised as a foreign subject until he had proved himself one, and that his registration certificate was worthless as it had not been attested by the Turkish authorities at Constantinople. According to 'Abbas's own statement he was snatched from his shop at Tawairij, beaten. tied by the arms, and dngged behind a horse to K&amp;rbfla. The Vice-Consul next wrote officially to the Mutasarrif complaining of the facts and requesting ♦ Abbas’s release. The Mutasarrif replied giving various reasons for the course persued by the authorities, of which the principal was that a person must prove himself to be a foreign subject before he could be tried as such.' “ — lr ' s % % By the end of May f Abbas had twice or thrice appeared before the Criminal ^jidayat Court of Karbala on the footing of an Ottoman subject, the intervention of the British Tr ice- Consul being still disallowed. It is understood that he produced his certificate of British nationality before the Court, but that the Assistant Procurator General objected to its being received in evidence. Also that the Census Office was called on for information and reported that f Abbas was not registered as a Turkish subject. Also that the Police Office made a similar report and recommended that f Abbas should be treated as a British subject. Nevertheless the Court, influenced by the Assistant Procurator General, decided to proceed with the trial of *Abbas as an ordinary Turkish * subject. Everything that could be done by this Consulate-General to obtain an entrance into the case was done, but without success. A memorandum was presented by the First Dragoman J nclosure •' . 5 to the Procurator-General of the Istinaf, Baghdad, on the 5th April. On the 16th of April I went to the Sarai in person and presented a second memoranduia to the Acting Wali f nclosurfi p , { in which a means of settlement was suggested, but could obtain no definite answer from him. On the ath of .tey Captain Scott,1.1.3, my substitute during my absence at Constantinople, sent the First Dragoman to the Sarai to oil CW-Wxobtain an answer; but the -ftilayat replied that my xsxsHaa memorandum had been lost and asked that an official letter be written then. Captain Scott accordingly sent another of the memorandum on the 16th lay with an official letter, tb© 31bt May Captain ^cott lollowed his letter up by a re minder, to which the Acting Wali merely replied, on the 4th June, that ’he hai received no reply from the dutasarrif of might copy On of Karbala, but had now reminded him”. On the 8th July, shortly after my return to Baghdad, I interviewed the Wali and Assistant A&amp;li at the Sarai and arranged that a ^oint enquiry should be made into the case by the British Vice-Consul at Karbala and the Procurator-General of the Istinaf, who was then on tour in the direction of Karbala. But on the 10th July, in consequence of a fresh nationality case at Baghdad, with which I may have to deal in a future despatch, I thought it better to ask the Acting di to cancel the arrangement,— a course to which he only too readily assented. Meanwhile Captain 3cott had had the honour of telegraph ing to Your xcellency (''0.53) with reference to this case on the 23th of June, and further telegrams were sent by myself on the 7th and 10th of July (Yos.56 and 57). At length on the 22nd of July f Abbas was discharged as innocentinnocent by the Turkish tribunal and released from the prison in which ha had bean confined for very nearly 5 months. His British nationality remained unreoognissd to the end, rnd there was some difficulty in recovering his certificate of registra- tion from the Court, to which he had submitted it. There is of course no security against his re-arrest, later on, on in appeal by the prosecuting authorities to some higher court. % n the l^th of dlaroh a burglary occurred at Karbala, in which a registered British subject, Saiyid Hasan^on of 3aigid uhamnuid ' li, cowplained that he had lost £.?.16. His complaint was not entertained by the Turkish authorities because he claimed the intervention of the British Vice-Consul, which was refused. The ground of refusal was that Saiyid Hasan must himself satisfy the Turkish authorities of his British nationality before the intervention of the Vice-Consul could be admitted. His British certifi cate of registration was treated as waste paper, in the same manner as ♦ Abbas's, and consideration of his claim has been up to the present denied. My proceedings and those of Captain Scott in this case were practically the same as in the case of '^bbcs, and they have been equally ineffectual. It only remains to state that I have satisfied myself off V of the correctness of the registration of the oonmlaim each cf the a )ovq cases v3 t British subject. One of Ghulaa Husain's elder sons, a brother of 'Abbas, was actually born in India and speaks fanjaoi. The father of Saiyid Hasan, who was hinself first registered at Karbala in 1095, has appeared before 06 at B&amp;ghd&amp;d* and conversed in my presence in Kashmiri with another Kashmiri. I was at first inclined to discuss the grounds of regis^fttion with the Turkish authorities in the two present cases; but on the occurrence of a third case, it having become evident that their policy was one of obstruction merely f I thought it better to withdraw the proposals which I had made in that sense. I have never presumed to deny the right of the Turkish authorities to call our registrations in question, and I am always ready to justify them by evidence when properly challenged. 'That I do protest against is the arbitrary action of the Turkish authorities in refusing to stay pro ceedings until the question of nationality has been settled. and in ignoring the British Consular authorities in the discuss ion of that question. The present procedure of the local authorities will evidently have the result, if consistently991 1 applied, of depriving British subjects here of the advantages of British protection. In the case of f Abbas I would respectfully suggest that Your Excellency shoul i claim £.?.1C as compensation for his illegal detention during 5 monthvS. Until the Turkish authorities here shall have been compelled in some public manner, as by payment of compensation, to acknowledge the incorrectness of their action, I have no hope that their present policy of attacking British rights, first by one means and then by another, will be discontinued. In this connect ion I would refer to the penultimate paragraph of my despatch ho.594/27 of the 17th July 1911. I have the honour to be, Uith the utmost respect, Your Excellency f s lost obedient humble Servant, 3d/- J. G. Lorimer, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia &amp; Consul General, Baghdad.

Oo ^ Momorandiam submittsd by the First Bra^on&amp;n to the ^rocurator-General of the Istinaf, Baghdad, on 5th April 1911. Pax^ers which will be exhibited by the First Dragoman of this Consulate General show that the Turkish authorities at Karbala are making difficulties about the recognition as a Eiitish subject of one 3eiyid Hasan son of Auhammad f Ali whose status is vouched for by the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. Property belonging to Saiyid Hasan was stolen nearly one month ago, but it appears that the proceedings are stopped because the authorities do not accept the Vice-Consul f s statement that the man is a British subject. Another case has occurred at Karbala, in which one Jlobss son of Gnulam Husain has been arrested and imprisoned without reference to the British Vice-Consulate, though he has been claimed by the British Vice-Consul as a British subject. It would be well that the Karbala authorities should be communicated with by telegram on the subject of these two cases. mb ft’Abbas sen of Ghalam Husain, residing at Tawairi^. was recf iitly arrested and brought to Karbolf by the 'urkish authorities* r -' 3 ?/as already registered as a British subject in the British Vice-Consulate Xarbala, and the British Vice- Consul therefore protested against his arrest without ref erence to the British Vice-Consulate. The British Vice-Consul’s intervention seems to have been rejected, however, on the ground that it was uncertain whether ’Abbas was a British subject.

Rifaat Pasha replied that he would gladly see this group of claims settled, but that in the face of the assertions of Nazim Pasha, who is now, as you are aware, in Constantinople, that all the proceedings of the municipal authorities had been in strict accordance with the law, it was impossible for the Government to meet our wishes, and that no action could be taken until the arrival in Bagdad of the new vali, Jemal Bey, who had been instructed to report in detail on the case. I pointed out to his Excellency that Nazim Pasha had all along denied by telegraph and in writing that any illegality had been committed, and that in spite of those denials the Porte had, in a general way, admitted that compensation was due. It was not to be expected that Nazim Pasha would now recede from his former statements, and I could not see why the Porte should change their attitude. But I was unable to induce his Excellency to agree to any immediate payment. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING.

Should this delay continue, it will be necessary to make special arrange ments for the accommodation of our office staff during the whole summer, and this will greatly increase our claim on the Turkish Government.

I have also urged upon Bifaat Pasha that it would be only fair that a provisional payment should be made to the sufferers to enable them to begin rebuilding, but beyond receiving an assurance that the suggestion would receive consideration 1 have not been able to obtain anything from his Excellency.

Our claim for compensation in respect of this expropriation was examined and approved by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad, and forwarded by him to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. We await settlement of this claim by the Turkish Government in order to enable us to commence rebuilding our premises. Our agents write to us that the proper period to commence building operations is in the spring; also that it is almost essential to them to have the work well advanced before wool pressing begins in May, when they will require the full use of the premises. Moreover, they represent that if they cannot soon reoccupy the premises they will be obliged to rent for the hot summer months better temporary premises than those they are at ptesent occupying, thus incurring further expense. We have consulted eminent counsel, Mr. Hamilton, K.C., and he informs us that all this loss and expense must be defrayed by the Turkish Government. We enclose a copy of his opinion on this point. Under these circumstances, if the Porte be not prepared to deal with this question immediately, and to pay at once the whole amount of our claim, w r e would suggest that a certain sum, say 1,000L, should be paid to us now to enable us to commence rebuilding, leaving the definite settlement of the claim to be dealt with as soon as opportunity serves. We hope that it may be possible to have this matter brought forward in Con stantinople at an early date, as our agents lay great stress on the importance of begiuning to rebuild at once. We observe that, in writing to us on the subject of refund of duty on the steam ship “ Julnar,” you informed us that the Turkish Government took the view that precedents established under the old regime could not validly be followed under the new regime, presumably because the new regime bases itself on the practice of constitutional countries. While entirely dissenting from this view as regards the past, we would point out that in this premises question the Turkish Government are seeking to establish a new r precedent which is entirely at variance with the procedure of constitutional countries. We attach a memorandum on this aspect of the subject by Mr. Hamilton, K.C.

In countries having a federal form of Government a provision to this effect is usually inserted in the law of the constitution, so that even if a law were passed by the Legislature with the consent of the president, purporting to grant the right to the executive of expropriating without paying compensation, such law would be ultra vires and void.

The general rule as to damages is that such damages are recoverable as are the necessary^or probable result of the wrong done. Assuming that the action of the municipal council in the matter has been illegal, the damages would be the sum necessary to reinstate the premises in their former condition, together with the amount paid for rent of temporary offices until Messrs.

If the premises cannot be reinstated because the municipal council are in possession of the land required for widening the road, then the rent would be recoverable until the matter was decided, provided that, in obtaining such decision, Messrs.

G. LOEIMEK. The 6th September 1910. Report of Mr. 'Abdur Rabb. I examined the bridge belonging to Sajjad ’Ali Khan’s house at Kazimain yesterday. This bridge is built north-south and has three rooms on it which form the Diwankhana of the house. The length of the bridge (Taq) is about 23 feet and the width at the foundation about 7| and at the top 7f feet. Height at the northern entrance is 7f feet, in the middle 6J feet, and at the southern entrance 6 feet only. The difference of height at three different points is due to the unevenness of the street. The Taq (bridge) is in thorough good condition except in one place where 3 or 4 bricks seem to slightly tremble when touched, rather tapped, with a stick and this is due to the removal of the cement. In two other places too, 3 or 4 inches of cement plaster has fallen off but the bricks are in perfect order and not in the least shaky. The 3 or 4 bricks mentioned above will become firm by the application of a very small quantity of cement or the mortar which they generally use. With this exception the Taq is, otherwise, quite safe. After the examination of the Taq I went to the Municipality. I opened the subject with the President. At the very outset he showed me a letter No. 105, dated the 14th Aghastoos, from the Wali, in which he says that the Chief Engi neer of the Yilayat who had been sent on purpose to examine the Kazimam town recommends the demolition of the following :—here names the places : and therefore these may be demolished as soon as possible. The Taq of Sajjad Ali Khan was included in the list. The President said he is ready to oblige me in everything, but as it was the order of the Wali he was powerless. However he would delay the demolition for a week. Upon this I told him that the verbal notice is nothing and the regular thing was to have given a written notice to the owner. The President replied that he knew nothing of the law. The Wall’s order was a sufficient authority for him. But as I and Sajjad Ali Khan were his friends he would do anything to please us. “ Only come with me ”, he said, “ to the Qaim-Maqam and we shall settle the matter there.” We went to the Qaim-Maqam. The subject was opened by me. I talked to him, as I had done to the President, in the light of your note. He also in formed me that it was the order of the Wali based on the report of the Chief Engineer, and that he would delay the demolition for a week or 10 days till the matter is discussed. But if I talked of law and legality of things, I should refer to the Walayat and not to him, because he was not authorised to have direct dealings with Foreign Consulates. As he seemed a little flushed I turned the matter into a joke, threw down on the table the Wali’s letter I had in my hand and said, “ Here goes the law ! Will you not delay taking action till the matter is settled ? ” The Qaim-Maqam was all smiles in a moment, he laughed and promised to wait for a week or two. Upon this we took leave and came away. For information. ABDUR RABB. The 7th September 1910. Report by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant, on a verbal order from the Resident. I have seen the arch of Sajjad ’Ali Khan’s house at Kazimain. The dimensions given in the above note as regards height and breadth of the arch appear to be correct. The arch and supporting walls are built of bricks and juse, but owing to neglect the pointing of the walls has worn away and the juse between the bricksV &lt; i 28 of the walls has corroded to a depth of an inch or more giving the walls an appearance of unusual decay. The arch itself is perfect having no crack indicating a subsidence or movement in the supporting walls. In my opinion the walls and arch are perfectly _ safe for another five or six years even if no attention is paid to them, hut if generally done up and repointed they will last many years yet. The road thereabouts is merely a lane and not a thoroughfare through which a general traffic passes. Judging from its locality I should think that seldom any loaded animals or horsemen, excepting donkeys carrying water skins pciss imd.6r tlic tircli. ^ ^ Q- STCTN~ The 9th September 1910- Dated Baghdad, the 9th September 1910. From-J. G. Lorimek, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, T 0 __Monsieue, A. Beam Bey, Political Secretary, M ilayat of Baghdad and its Dependencies. Saiiad ’AM Khan, one of the principal British Indian subjects at Baghdad, has been verbally informed by the Kazimam Municipality that three rooms of his which are built over a street there, are in a dangerous condition and must he removed. As he represented that they were not dangerous, I sent first a native employe of this Consulate-General, and then Mr. Gaskin, to see them ; and both officers report that they are not dangerous. Would you kindly look into this question without delay in order that the Municipality may not take hasty and perhaps illegal action, as, according to our view, the Baghdad Municipality did m the case of Messrs. Lynch. It would be very unfortunate if a fresh case had to he referred to Constantinople. (No reply to this letter was received.) No. 146, dated the 15th September 1910. Prom—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad, To—His Excellency the Wall of Baghdad. I have the honour to inform you that, according to information which I have received, an arch and upper storey belonging to Sajjad ‘ Ah h^ an &gt; a British Indian subject, have been condemned as insecure and ordered to be destroyed. I have caused the building to be examined by two representatives of this Consulate-General separately. Both of these have given it as their opinion that it is in no way insecure. Will Your Excellency in these circumstances consider the propriety of causing this order of the Kadhimain Municipality to be cancelled, or at least direct 'the Municipality to allow the owner an opportnuity ^ o± doing the replastering and other superficial repairs which are possibly required, in case the Municipality persist in their intention, it is possible that a claim for damages may arise. Your Excellency is probably aware that demolitions of house property are in progress at Karbala and that the properties of British Indian subjects are in some cases likely to be affected. I have the honour to request that Your Excellency will kindly take steps to insure that the Turkish Laws of Buildings and Expropriation are observed by the Karbala Municipality, as I am informed that there appears to be a tendency on the part of that body to disregard them.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad, To—His Excellency the Wali of Baghdad. In conformity with an indication contained in Your Excellency’s letter No. 117 of the 17th September 1910, the British Indian owner of the house at Kadhimain will present a petition on the subject of the threatened demolition of his property to the President of the Kadhimain municipality. A copy of his petition is enclosed for Your Excellency’s information. As Your Excellency declines to discuss the merits of the case with me and even the question whether an order to execute repairs might not be substituted for the order to demolish, I can do no more. Your Excellency must not therefore blame me, if the matter reapears later in another form. Pray accept Your Excellency, the expression of my highest esteem and consideration. Petition, dated the 20th September 1910. From— Sajjad Ali Khan, To—The President of the Kadhimain Municipality. I have received a verbal notice from the Kadhimain Municipality ordering me to demolish an arch and upper storey belonging to my house there, on an allegation that they are dangerous. With reference to this notice I beg to point out that the building in ques tion is not dangerous, as an impartial inspection will prove ; and that, at the most, some surface plastering and pointing are required. I therefore request that you will kindly arrange for the order of demolition to be withdrawn, in which case I will proceed to make any repairs that may appear desirable.No. 861, dated Baghdad, the 27th September 1910 (Confidential).

I have the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch No. 830-47 of the 21st September, that the demolition of Sajjad ‘Ali Khan s arch and upper storev at Kadhimain has been commenced and will no doubt be completed. The Wall’s Political Secretary called on me to-day and conversed with me on the sub ect ; and I understood him to say that the policy of condemnm| build ill's as dam-erous, and demolishing them without compensation instead of Sroprfatin^e ownhs, had been deliberately adopted by the M.layat as the most inexpensive method of carrying out necessary municipal improvements He stated P so far as I could follow him, that £ T. 20,000 had aWy been s^ d bv resorting to this expedient m the case of buildings^ owned by luikish subjects ; and he said that the object of the Wilayat in negotiating wit Messrs Stephen Lynch &amp; Co., as they are now doing with reference to a law-suit threatened by that firm, was to avoid, if possible, the establishment of a precedent which might encourage Turkish subjects to claim compensation under the expropriation laws. I understand, however that Messrs. Lynch are most unlikely to agree to any settlement which does not include pecuniary compensation. ” I told the Political Secretary that many ^sem which the owner, being a British subject, was willing to settle direct with the Wilayat I should have no objection at all; but that, where he was not willing and sou o, lit my assistance, I could not but support bis just claims. u i , think, be admitted that it is impossible to allow British subjects to be robbed o their property by artifice merely m order to facilitate the spoliation of Ottoma subiects by their own Government. . _ , , An , w Prom M. Eram Bey’s remarks on this occasion I can only conclude tnat sooner or later it will be necessary to decide, in all the cases mentioned m my despatch No. 776-42 of the 5th September 1910, bow the claims to compensa- tion of the British subjects effected are to be enforced. There is not the slightest use in my continuing to press the matter here ; and I therefore sobcit the favour of Your Excellency’s taking such action at Constantinople as may seem to Your Excellency to be proper and sufficient I may add that the question of a new mam street and three cross stieets in Baghdad town, which has been mentioned more than once m my montmy Summaries of Events, is expected to enter on the practical stage short y the conclusion of the Ramadhan. The Municipal Engineer (M. C^anis, a Erench subject! informs me that the mam street, 20 metres wide, will be ma bv cutting through the solid town for distance of three kilometres ; an 480 houses none of them fortunately belonging to British subjects, will e - troved in whole or in part. Erom another source I learn that the align mm of this projected street has been altered lately so as to carry it through t poorer quarters where the proprietors are less able to offer opposition, money-saving principle indicated by M. Eram Bey is adopted m the case of this street to any great extent, 1 anticipate that notwithstanding the poverty of the owners, the Wilayat may encounter some difficulties. I would beg Your Excellency to regard my conversations with the I olit Secretary and the Municipal Engineer as confidential.No. 891, dated Baghdad the 7th October 1910 (Confidential). From—J. G.

In continuation of my despatch No. 860-50 of the 27th September 1910, I have the honour to submit a copy of a report given me by Mr. Parry, the local representative of Messrs. Stephen Lynch &amp; Co. in connection with the progress—if it can be called progress—of negotiations between him self and the Wilayat with regard to the recent demolition, in the name of the Baghdad Municipality, of certain buildings at Baghdad belonging to his firm. The papers enclosed do not appear to call for any comment upon my part. Notes for Mr. Lorimer regarding Negotiations with the Local Government, in connection with the demolition of walls and shops on our premises and the ground required for road widening purpose. 1. On the 25th ultimo, I met Djavad Bey and Eram Bey at my office with the object of endeavouring to come to some amicable settlement of the difficulties. 2. I informed them that I was acting as Agents of the proprietors of the property and any negotiations must be considered unofficial, but that I was willing to submit any reasonable proposal to London. 3. A plan was produced by Djavad Bey shewing the section of the main road from the Bazaar to a point 200 yards south of the south wall of the offices, in which the houses are shewn on each side of the road with a red line cut ting off I metres on each side, representing the widened road 11,40 metres wide. 4. I was told that the frontage of the houses immediately in front of our premises would be pulled down immediately after the Bairam holidays (say 6th instant). 5. In answer to my enquiry I was told that permission would be given to us to build on the property along the line where the shops and wall have been demolished, only if we accepted a line 4 metres within the line of the demo lished walls. 6. On pointing out that, if we built a wall along that line on one portion of the property, the main building (offices) would just out into the widened road 4 metres, I was told that they would take the main building at some later date; and the law, which does not permit the reconstruction or repair to frontages on the road required for widening purposes without putting the waU back, would be put in force. 7. After much discussion, in which the desirability of a large firm like Lynch assisting the Local Government in carrying out improvements in the town and the advantages which would accrue if we set the example to the natives by giving our property without compensation was emphasised, I requested them to make me an offer which I could submit to my Principals. An offer was made to the effect that, as a concession to us, they would take only three instead of four metres from our property.32 This offer being absurd, I told the meeting that I could not send it to London ; but, after 'persuasion, 1 consented to submit the offer, and telegraphed to London, on the 28th ultimo. On the 30th ultimo I received a telegraphic reply which reads as follows : — “Proposition pas raisonnable. Impossible accepter sans dedommage- ment equitable. Lynch”. 8. With the telegram referred to above I received a separate telegram, intimating that acceptance of any settlement must be based on compensation being paid for rebuilding premises and value of site in full. 9. It is my intention to show the first telegram to His Excellency the Vali as soon as I can obtain an interview. The 1st October 1910. E. W. PAEBY.Telegram P v dated the 12th (received 18th) November ^S^O. From—The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of Im in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have sent the following telegram to H is Britanm Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. Begins. My telegram of 8th November and Yonr Excellency’s telegram of the 10th. Part of two-story building No. 6 was demolished yesterday and to-day with circumstances of insult and injury. I fear that the Minister of the Interior is misleading Your Excellency, for I observe that the violence of the local Government is increasing daily. The next thing will be expro priations, which if conducted on same lines as demolitions will cause enormous losses to British subjects not hitherto foreseen. The Yali now seems to he making the question a personal matter. Our reputation here has fallen to a low ebb and alarm is being felt by British subjects whose rights have never before been so trampled on at Baghdad. Eor four months now, they have suffered from illegal oppression and have seen no tangible indication of redress to come. Two or three Indians have lately renounced British nationality for Turkish and even Abdul Ali the prosperous merchant has spoken of doing the same. I fear that I have failed to convey to Your Excellency a sufficiently serious impression of the situation, hut I did not wish to be thought an alarmist. If Your Excellency could obtain compensation at once in even one case, the panic would be allayed to some extent. The case of the ice manufacturer is clear, and immediate payment to him would serve this purpose. I do not think Baghdad municipal loan should be entrusted to present local Government, as it will certainly be mis-spent and the city will be saddled with heavy debt to no purpose for a generation. In any case the loan should not be given till the amount of compensation to be paid to British subjects for demolitions and prospect of expropriations has been properly discussed and approved by Embassy. The Vali who is incompetent is in the hands of ignorant and unscrupulous subordinates and with regret I have come to the conclusion that his removal is necessary in favour of a more intelligent man. Ends. Telegram P., dated the 14th (received 15th) November 1910. From—The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have sent following telegram to Ambassador, Constantinople. In con tinuation of my telegram dated 12th November, Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.’s Manager has received notice of expropriation of three and a half metres from front of Lynch’s office and warehouse to take effect in fifteen days. The compensation fixed is 424 Turkish liras only, whereas the Manager’s estimate of cost of re building on new alignment is 1,184 Turkish liras and the estimate by the Resi dency enclosed in my despatch of September 5th was 1,250 liras. This evinces34 / ,■ . . the unscrupulous character of proceedings. Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.s’ total claim is 2 396 liras viz., 1,228 liras on account of buildings now to be expropriated and 568 liras o’n account of shops and wall wrongfully demohshed; but items other than cost of re-building are perhaps open to discussion. If authorities destroy Lynch’s office and warehouse before proper compensation has been fixed, I appre hend a blow to British prestige from which it will not quickly recover. I expect shortly to hear that the block of high houses owned by Indian Nawabs and not mentioned in my despatch of September 5th has also been expropriated on pre- posterously inequitable terms. The opinion if gaining ground here that the British Government is powerless to protect its subjects in Turkey. It is essen tial that vilayt’s proceedings should be stayed.No. 1014, dated Baghdad, the 17th November (received 6 th December) 1910 (confidential). From—J. G.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Goyernment of India, a copy of my despatch No. dated 17th November 1910, which I have addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. 2. The last reference to this subject is my letter No. 891, dated the 7th October 1910. No. 1013—62, dated Baghdad, the 17th November 1910 (confidential). From—I. G.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with my despatch No. 890—53 of the 7 th October 1910, I have the honour to report that the front of Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop f and part of the front of the late Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan’s house X have now been destroyed as dangerous,—though they the wall § and shops belonging to Messrs. house,! the demolition t Item No. 5 in my despatch No. 776—42 of the 6th September 1910. t Item No. 6 in the same. § Item No. 1 in the same. II Item No. 4 in the same. were not dangerous,—in addition to Stephen Lynch &amp; Co., and part of the Iqbal-ud-Daulah of which had already been reported by me. I have had the honour of informing Youir Excellency by telegram, from time to time, of the progress of these events, and of soliciting Your Excellency’s assistance but it was impossible for me to report by wire the entire circum stances of the two latest demolitions. Some particulars of them will be found in Annexure No. 1 to this despatch, illustrating the perverse spirit in which the Wilayat have acted with regard to them.wmm 37 Annexures Nos. 2 and 3 to the present despatch are memoranda by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, the Commercial Assistant in this Residency,—who is an expert in building questions at Baghdad — containing estimates of the com pensation to which Mr. G. Thaddeus and Swfiyah Khanum, the widow of the late Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan, ajypear to be justly entitled. Mr. Gaskin finds that the cost of restoring the front part of Mr. Thaddeus’s shop will be £ T. 29 Gsp. 2, and that the value of the ground belonging to it appropriated for the public street is £ T. 177 Gsp. 74, total £ T. 206 Gsp. 76. In the case of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan’s house the cost of rebuilding is estimated by Mr. Gaskin at £ T. 786 Gsp. 105^, and the value of the area taken for the street at £ T. 100 Gsp. 70, total £^ T. 887 Gsp. 67J. Both buildings are situated on the present main artery of longitudinal com munication in Baghdad, where frontage is naturally very valuable. Since my despatch No. 776—42 of the 5th September 1910 was written, I have had frequent occasion to refer to the text of the Turkish Expropriation and Building Laws; and I am now inclined to think that articles 8 and 13 of the latter do not bar a claim for compensation on .account of ground taken, unless the ground is unbuilt upon. In both the present cases the ground taken was altogether built over, and in that of Mr. Thaddeus’s shop it amounted to more than one-fourth of the whole property; hut this latter fact, in my altered view, has no bearing on the question of compensation. The principal loss to Mr. Thaddeus is that of a very valuable plot of land; and I am of opinion that ground compensation should be demanded on behalf of both pro prietors. The chicanery by which the Wilayat l ave sought to substitute demo lition proceedings for legal expropriation is an additional strong reason for not waiving any part of the compensation which is properly exigible. In a telegram to Your Excellency dated 12th November 1910,—which I repeated to the Government of India as Indian subjects of His Britannic Majesty were principally affected—I remarked on the alarm to British subjects and the injury to British prestige which the successful execution by the Local Government of their unscrupulous designs, notwithstanding my persistent protests, had occasioned. Until the rights of our subjects and the credit of our Government have been vindicated by visible means, such as the recovery of compensation, our national position at Baghdad will continue to be very un satisfactory and may be exposed to fresh attacks; and I therefore respectfully beg that Your Excellency will take the observations contained in my telegram into very careful consideration. ANNEXURE No. 1. Memorandum of circumstances connected with the partial demolion of Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop arid the house of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan. Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop. On the 26th of October Eram Bey, the Wall’s Political Secretary, called and informed me that His Excellency had decided to refer the state of the shop * See Monthly Summary of Events for September h) a 11'Cnch architect (not engineer!, 1910 , x. 3. ^ ^ M. Godard,* who has lately been taken into the Turkish service. This gentleman, he assured me, might be relied on to deliver a candid and unbiassed opinion, independent of one already given by Colonel Javad Bey, the Wall’s engineer. By my advice Mr. M. Thaddeus, a son of the proprietor of the shop, at once called on Eram Bey to ask that he might be sent for, as his father’s representative, when the shop was inspected by M. Godard; but Eram Bey told him, considerably to his surprise, that the . inspection had already taken place. On Mr. Thaddeus’ enquiring the result, however, he was told that it was “ rather favourable ” to his father. Notwithstanding this semi-assurance, it became apparent, on the 3rd of November, that the front of the shop was about to be demolished after all. I accordingly wrote to Eram Bey for an explanation ; and the next morning he came and informed me verbally that M. Godard had placed him in a very difficult position by a change of opinion. Meanwhile Mr. Thaddeus (junior),'•jgJJ—Sgy** 88 by my advice, had personally visited M. Godard and discussed matters with him. M. Godard seems to have evaded a direct question hy Mr. Thaddeus as to whether he considered the shop dangerous, and to have limited himself to saying that it was “ not strong.” At the same time he admitted, according to £ Mr. Thaddeus, that nearly every building in Badhdad would fall within his “ not strong ” category. On the 7th of November the shop was partially dismantled by municipal agency. It had been my contention all along that the shop was a timber- frame structure, and that its strength did not depend on the brick filling between the beams, which filling, though nearly perpendicular, was not absolutely so. The correctness of my assertion was now demonstrated by the fact that, after all the bricks in the front had been removed, the frame stood as firmly as before, supporting the roof, in which condition it was allowed by the Municipality to remain for some days. I ascertained these facts by a personal inspection on th 8th of November. On the 10th of November Eram Bey told me that M. Godard had discovered that the foundations (fundement ) of the shop were of wood, and that the wood was rotten. I took an opportunity of visiting the shop the same day, the front minus the bricks being then still standing, and found that, as I thought, the statement was untrue. The foundations were of brick and contained no wood ; and the wood work which rested on the foundations was perfectly sound. House op the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan. On the evening of the 7th of November, the day of the dismantling of Mr. Thaddeus’s shop, the family of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan were informed that a portion of their house in question, which had been pronounced dangerous—though not really so—would be demolished. The next morning (the 8th) Eram Bey visited me and requested me verbally to send a dragoman to see to the removal of furniture, etc., from the rooms affected. After visiting the house, to satisfy myself of its condition, I replied in writing that I could not take any steps to facilitate the proceedings, which I regarded as totally unjustifiable. I also observed that only part of the house was old or open to criticism, and that that part was repairable. Eram Bey replied taking general exception to my attitude, but mentioning for the first time that only the old part was to be demolished. On the 9th November I received an official letter from the Wilayat repeat ing the request already made through Eram Hey and fixing the demolition for the next day at 8 o’clock (Turkish). I answered that if an assurance were given that, should the land cleared by the demolition be taken for the street, the Municipality would pay the cost of reconstructing the front and interior of the house upon the new alignment, I should be happy to comply with His Excellency’s wishes ; but that otherwise I must abstain from an act which might be construed as indicating acquiescence, and the Municipality must proceed in the matter on their own responsibility and at their own risk. On the 11th and 12th of November the old part and some of the new part of the house were demolished by municipal labourers. The ostentatious .violence with which this was done has been remarked on, in conversation with me, by various persons ; but the details are mostly unimportant. Old carved windows, etc., were hurled in the street instead of being carefully removed; and even the broken fragments which remained disappeared during the night. i J. G. LORIMER. ANNEXURE NO. 2. Memorandum. An estimate of cost of restoring the frontage of Mr. G., Thaddeus’s shop and of the value of the ground appropriated by the Municipality for widening the road is attached.The average breadth of the ground taken by the Municipality is 7 feet 5 inches=2‘26 metres and the length is 33 feet=10 - 05 metres, thus the area is 22-71 square metres. The price of the ground has been valued at Gsp. 540 per square Dhra’ Ma’mari or Gsp. 845 the square metre. The original area of the shop was about 79 square metres and now it is reduced to 56 - 29 square metres, less than three-quarters of the plot, and consequently the purposes for which it can now be used are limited and naturally the price is adversely affected.

Hough plans of the house of the late Nawab Ahmad *Ali Khan and estimates of cost of restoring the front and interior in the same style as before its demolition by the Municipality and the value of the land appropriated by the latter are attached. Owing to a rise in the prices of building materials the rates per cubic metre have been readjusted accordingly.40 Before the house was demolished I held the opinion, that it was not dangerous and that it would hold out a few more years, and with some repairs could be made solid. I saw the alleged dangerous part of the house while it was being pulled down and consequently saw the internal condition of the walls and I found no reason to modify my previous views. Further, the entrance hall and rooms above it ^ were found to be solidly built and strong and there was not the slightest justification for the destruction of that part of the house. It is very evident that the alleged dangerous condition of the house was put forward merely as a pretext for pulling it down with the object of justifying the acquirement of a portion of the ground for the purpose of adding to the width of the road without having to pay tor it. In pullin^ down the front wall no care was taken to save the wood work of the two Shahnishins, the ceilings and the side of the large upper room, and it has been unnecessarily and ruthlessly destroyed. A large portion of the beams and posts have been removed by the orders of the Municipality to be sold for the purpose of defraying the expense of demolition. The amount shown in the estimate is not the true loss. The courtyard of the house is only 7-87 long by 7'21 metres broad and if the front part of the house is taken 2^ metres backwards, the courtyard will be 7 87 mug and 4'71 metres broad—a narrow alley—detracting much from the value of the site of the house generally. The sum that may be paid eventually for the appropriated ground will not recompense the owners for the shrinkage in the value. J. C.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of my despatch No. dated 19th December 1910, which I have addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. Also copies of two despatches from His Excellency. 2. The last reference to this subject is my letter No. 1014, dated 17th November 1910. Constantinople, October 23rd, 1910. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 776—42 of September 5th last and to previous correspondence on the subject of the demolition by the local authori ties of house properties belonging to British subjects at Baghdad, I have to request that you will draw up, in consultation with the agents of the several firms concerned, a detailed valuation of the damage recently inflicted upon British subjects at Baghdad, Karbala, Kazimia and any other places within your district, as soon as you are able definitely to ascertain what amount of demolition of property and expropriation of lands will be effected by the Bagh dad authorities. As I informed you in my telegram of October 8th, I have already put in a claim to the Sublime Porte for the losses incurred by British subjects in this connection, amounting at a rough estimate to some £T. 4,800 ; and on receipt of your detailed and final valuation I shall not fail to press the Central Gov ernment for full compensation. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, GEKABJ) LOWTHER. J. G. Lorimer, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. Constantinople, November 8th, 1910. Sir, I have received your despatch No. 888—52 of the 7th ultimo, respecting the municipal demolitions at Karbala, and I approve the action taken by you in this matter. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, GERARD LOWTHER. J.

Incidental losses Your Excellency’s despatch of the October 1910, I have the honour to enclose (a) detailed estimates of the losses lately (b) suffered by British sub jects owning house and shop property at Baghdad, Kadhimain and Karbala, in consequence of the action of the local Turkish authorities. The complexity of the enclosures, which contain references to former correspondence, is regretted : but it is unavoidable. be demanded has been assessed as £. T. S,117-28* 1,115-27 632-56 Total &amp;. T. 4,865T1* I venture to hope that the value of the land taken, whether exigible or not under the Turkish law, will be demanded of the Turkish Government, for the claim is clearly equitable. In one instance the site was a more important asset than the building (see Enclosure I—D). It also appears to me that the claim on account of incidental losses is worthy of acceptance. At Kadhimain the compensation proposed is £ T. 89 , 36 and it is entirely on account of a building destroyed. As the building formed a bridge across a street at some distance' above the ground there is no question, in this case, of loss of site; and no claim has been made on account of incidental losses. At Karbala the compensation due is estimated by the British Vice-Consul, a copy of my correspondence with whom is enclosed, at £.T. 369^. The Vice- Consul’s report is not so clear as could be wished; but it seems better, as the amounts at stake at Karbala are comparatively small, not to delay the whole case for a second reference to him. The Vice-Consul’s valuation seems to me to be an under-estimate inasmuch as it does not, except in the case of Haji Mirza Ahmad’s shop, include anything on account of loss of ground. If Your Excellency, as I respectfully recommend, presses for compensation on account of land as well as on account of buildings, the sum of £.T. 76 02 might be claimed under that head and the head of incidental losses at Karbala, which* W'ould not be excessive and would make up the total amount of the Karbala claim •it will be seen that the Vice-Consul has omitted the cost of re-building of one shop, for which also provision has to be made. to £.T. 445-52^.

Eram Bey, the Wali’s Political Secretary, was himself living in it when it was condemned. It was the first house of a British subject to be destroyed, and unprepared as I was then for unscrupul ous action on the part of the local authorities, I did not take the precaution of inspecting it personally.4 Estimate of compensation due to British sabjects at Baghdad, etc., contd.

Mr. Thaddeus at present obtains a rent of £. T. 20 a year (and had been offered not long ago one of £. T. 35) for this shop which would make its capital value on the prin ciple described £.

From—The Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul- General at Baghdad, To—The British Vice-Consul at Karbala. Under orders received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople , I have the honour to request that you will immediately prepare a detailedestimate of tlie losses suffered by British subjects, owners of immoveable pro perty at Karbala, through the recent proceedings of the local authorities. The estimate should be prepared in the form of a statement showing the particulars of each building demolished or expropriated separately. The prin- p* cipal particulars are measurements and value of the building removed; measure ments and value of the site taken ; and whether demolition was complete or partial. In each case it should be noted whether the building was dealt with under the law of buildings or that of expropriation, and whether the legal for malities were observed. If any of the buildings were demolished on the ground of their being in a dangerous condition, it should be stated whether they were really dangerous or not. At Baghdad it is an understood principle that the capital value of an immoveable property is 33^- times its annual rent ; and if any similar rule is recognised at Karbala, you should apply it to your calculations of the value of building and site together, as a check upon their correctness. The estimates should be drawn up in consultation with the owners of their agents, and with any other persons from whom you can obtain useful assistance. They should represent the true market values of the properties, or of the portions of them taken, without over or under valuation. The following are the owners whose cases you have so far brought to my notice ; but there may now be others having cases:— Haji Mirza Ahmad (Akhbari), two cases. Haji Zain-ul-’Abidin (Akhbari), one case. Muhammad ’Ali Agha (Davi), one case. As you will remember, I instructed you on the 18th of October, “ to take very careful account of the value of British subjects’ buildings before they are destroyed, so that we may be in a position to prove the actual loss to British subjects if it should be decided eventually to claim compensation from the municipality.” I hope therefore that you have all the necessary materials ready to hand and will be able to send the report now required by return of post, without undue haste. No. 233, dated 9th December 1910. From—M. H. Mohsin, Esq., British Vice-Consul, Karbala, To—J. Gi. Lommeu, [Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1075, dated 2nd instant, ordering that I should send you a detailed estimate of the losses suffered by British subjects, owners of immoveable property at Karbala, through the recent proceedings of the local authorities. 2. In my former reports I stated that the authorities did not act accord ing to any law, nor did they observe the legal formalities except in two cases of British subjects (namely Ali Hashim and Zein-ul-Abidin) in which notices were given to them to demolish and rebuild at their own expense, and in spite of their urging reasonable expenses they compelled them to carry out their order. The compulsion was done by threats and underhand dealings which forced the owners to either comply or undergo the consequences which were, perhaps, heavier than the cost of rebuilding their property. Two things, which evidently took the place of legal formalities, however, preceded their operation, viz ., a verbal warning to vacate the property during the day, and the demolition of the roofing of the bazaar at night which rendered the places unfit for occupation. 3. British subjects’ losses are of two kinds : the first a loss suffered on account of rebuilding the frontage of their property at their own expense, and the second, which is heavier, includes the first together with the value of the ground taken in excess of a quarter and in one or two cases the whole of the property. 4. Sufferers of the first kind, whose property were partially demolished, are eight persons wilh 26J shops for the rebuilding of which they have spent a sum of about 267^ Lirahs. Of these three persons with seven shops and 91 Lirahs may be excepted as having waived their rights by giving me9 \ t l i ■ r y a statement to that effect, and the rest are such as they still wish to recover their expenses if possible. The accompanying schedule, marked A, shows the names and other details of the persons who come under this heading. 5. Sufferers of the second kind are first Haji Mirza Ahmad Akhbari who owns one half of a shop which was 16 feet long by 4 feet and 9 inches wide. Of this the authorities expropriated seven inches more than a quarter of the whole, which according to its rent of 5 Lirahs per annum is worth 100 Lirahs. The value of the seven inches is therefore about 4 Lirahs cf which one half belongs to Mirza Ahmad. The shop was demolished partially. The other case of Mirza Ahmad is the bazaar piece of the ground in front of his Kaisarivah which is wanted to be given to him on his satisfying the owner of an opposite shop who had lost 50 Lirahs worth of property. The piece of ground in question is 9 feet 3 inches long by two feet two inches wide on one side and one foot 5 inches on the other. Its market value for any buyer besides the Akhbari who may convert it into a shop by blocking up the door of the Kaisairiyah is 50 Lirahs but for the Akhbari himself it is worth nothing. The case is still pending. 6. Secondly Saiyid Muhammad Kashmeri who had two shops, each one side of a wall, facing in different directions. The smaller, which was lately demolished, without compensation, was 7 feet 4 inches long by 2 feet 3 inches deep on one side and 2 feet 7 inches on the other and it fetched a rent of 3 Lirahs per annum. The market value, together with the two columns of wall which stood on both sides of it, was 60 Lirahs. The bigger was only partially demolished and the over expropriation from this shop, which I reported in my letter dated 15th October 1910, was given up, so that his actual loss of site was less than a quarter. 7. Thirdly Agha Lavee whose property was completely demolished. It was a large building 20 metres long by 3J metres wide, on the top of an arch under which people used to frequent. He owned only one quarter of it; the other three quarters belonged to a Turkish subject. He bought the place for 80 Lirahs, according to his title-deed, because it was mortgaged with him and the original owner refused to pay him the amount. Its market value, at the time of its demolition, was only 40 Lirahs and its rent 2 Lirahs per annum. The Government demolised the whole of this building in order to remove the arch and widen the road. The enclosed schedule marked B refers to the losses suffered by the foregoing persons. 8. In estimating the measurement, rents, values and the lesses mentioned in this letter and the accompanying papers I have, besides my personal know ledge, consulted with the owners of the property and two other experts who had also sufficient information of the Indians’ cases. In Karbala the value of an immoveable property is generally estimated at 20 times its annnal rent, but in some cases this changes a little according to special conditions of the property. 9. Out of all cases mentioned in the enclosed papers not a single one wa s demolished, whether partially or completely, on the ground of its being old and dangerous. They were in fact very strong, and the demolition was made only to improve and widen the road. 10. The statements contain only those cases which have happened up to date; there are of course any other shop, houses, etc., which may come here after.No. 107, dated Baghdad, the 4th (received 20 th) February 1911. From— J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Goyerument of India, a copy of my despatch No ^ 6 , dated 4th February, which I hare addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. 2. The last reference to this subject is my letter No. 1125, dated the 19th December 1910. British Besidency and Consulate General, Baghdad, 4th February 1911. No. 106 4 ' Tour Excellency, I have the honour, in continuation of my despatch No. of the 19th December 1910, to address you further on the subject of the aggressions committed by the local Turkish authorities at Baghdad on British subjects owning immoycable property. All the demolitions that were contemplated in my despatch have now been carried out according to programme; and the whole sum of £T. 5,400, which I estimated to be the proper amount of compensation, is therefore claimable at once. 69, C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant, the Political Resident, * Copies of the following documents are attached for reference :• (1) Letter from Messrs. Lynch to the Political Resident, No. dated 28th December 1910. (2) Report and plan by Mr. J. dated 2nd January 1911. (3) Unofficial letter from Mr. Parry to dated 30th January 1911. (4) Further report by Mr. Gaskin, dated 31st January 1911. (5) Political Resident’s semi-official protest to Governor-General, Baghdad, dated 30th January 1911. (6) Governor-General’s reply to the Political Resident’s protest, No. 200, dated 31st January 1911. (7) Messrs. Lynch’s letter to the Political Resident, No. 7, dated 1st February 1911. I have now to report * on a fresh and very insolent attempt at aggression—by the same authorities—in regard to which I have already had the honour of corresponding with Your Excellency by telegraph. On the 28th of December 1910, I was informed that the authorities had changed their plans in regard to the course of the street the widening of which has been the cause of most of the trouble at Baghdad. It appeared that they now meant to carry it through the middle of the property of Messrs. Stephen Lynch &amp; Co., dividing the land owned by that firm into two unequal and irregularly shaped parts. The new alignment proposed was unquestionably a better one'from the public point of view than that at first selected ; but its adoption rendered superfluous the demolition of the front of the Iqubal-ud-Daulah house and of part of the wall of Messrs. Lynch’s premises, both of which had already been destroyed on a false pretext; and it was clearly the intention of the authorities to carry out the fresh expropriation on terms most unjust to Messrs. Lynch. As the Wilayat have consistently refused to admit my intervention in cases of the kind, I was f See Mr. Gaskin’s report No. 4 in the margin above. obliged, after Satisfying j lUV” self of the fraudulent nature of the proceedings as regarded the amount of compensation, to apply by telegram for Your Excellency’s assistance. In my telegram, sent on the 3rd January 1911, I was careful to inform Your Excellency that there was no objection to the new alignment proposed perse; but I added that the compensation claimable by Messrs. Lynch would be heavy; and I recom mended, in view of previous experience, that the local authorities should not be allowed to take possession of the land until the sum due had been properly assessed and actually paid. Your Excellency was good enough to reply, on ther gth. of January, that the Ottoman Minister for Poreign Affairs had assured you that orders had been sent to the Governor-General of Baghdad not to under take any fresh expropriations until the cases already pending had been settled. A few days later Eram Bey, the Political Secretary of the Wilayat, informed me verbally that the p]an of carrying the street through the middle of Messrs. Lynch’s property had been abandoned. The matter thus appeared to he at an end. On the 30th January, however, a notice of expropriation of the land in question was served on Mr. Parry, Messrs. Lynch’s representative at Baghdad. The compensation named in the notice was exactly half of the insufficient sum which the authorities had originally decided to offer. I immediately lodged a strong semi-official protest with the Wilayat, hut in it I made no reference to the breach of faith which had been committed, for I was uncertain whether the Governor-General would regard as binding on himself the verbal assurance which had been given me by his Secretray. At the same time I demanded a personal interview with Nazim Pasha, and telegraphed informing Your Excel lency of what had occurred. The result of these proceedings was so far satisfactory that the Political Secretary came to the Residency on the same day in a state of considerable agitation, declaring that the issue of the notice to Mr. Parry was a mistake ; and the notice itself was withdrawn the next day, with an apology, by the Acting President of the Baghdad Municipality ; but in the Wilayat’s official reply to my protest, while the occurrence of a mistake was admitted or rather asserted, the interview for which I had asked was refused on a technical ground, and an ineffectual attack was made on the position which I bad^ taken up. Strong pressure was also brought to bear on me privately to admit that I believed the issue of the notice to be accidental, but I declined to do so and wrote privately to the Political Secretary in the following terms * “ I can only repeat what I told you yesterday, viz., that I do not accept the assurance that the communication to Messrs. Lynch was a mistake. In a delicate international case of this sort no subor dinate would dare to take action without the approval of the Wali, and in any case the Wali must be held responsible for the acts of his subordinates,” The fact that the case had already been under discussion at Constan tinople and was very notorious in Baghdad practically negatives the possibility of anv accident ; and the circumstance that the final (reduced) valuation of the land was made about the 20th January, i.6., aftcv a cessation of the proceed ings had been ordered by the Porte, renders the Local Government s excuse altogether incredible. There is a great resemblance between the present affair and that which occurred in August last, when all Baghdad was led to believe that a street * + *r &lt;790 would he driven through the grounds of August 1910 , seq.) the British Residency itselt. In both cases the object was undoubtedly to discredit the British Government. In both the Turkish authorities went just as far as they dared, and would evidently have gone further if there had been the slightest negligence or sign of yielding on the part of this Residency. In both cases, as soon as it was seen that success was unattainable, the existence of the scheme was denied, and private endea vours were made to obtain from the British Resident an admission that he regarded the matter as a misunderstanding. As an additional illustration of the venomous spirit by which some of the officials, at least, of this Wilayat are animated towards British subjects, I sub join a copy f of a letter which I was compelled to write to the Governor- General’s Political Secretary on the subject of the annoyances experienced by Mr. G. Thaddeus when, at the desire of the municipal authorities themselves, he proceeded to reconstruct his demolished shop. Needless to say, this letter was unproductive of satisfactory results. f Letter to January 1911. Mr. Eram Bey, dated the 7th \I desire to express to Your Excellency, very earnestly, my conviction that only by the prompt recovery of full compensation for our injured subjects can the credit of the British name he re-established at Baghdad; and I respectfully submit for Your Excellency’s consideration whether some expression of regret might not also be obtained from the Ottoman Government at the manner m which British subjects here have been persecuted in their name. I have also the honour to solicit the approval of His Britannic Majesty s Government, and that of Your Excellency, to my proceedings. I have the honour to inform you that it has been decided by the local authorities to take the main road running from the bazaar towards the south gate diagonally through property belonging to Messrs. Lynch from the south wall of their offices in a direct line to the street at the comer of the house now occupied by Mr. Mercurian, Manager of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. This •1 47 ^-P -Plirv wao/I Txrill mi! T.hi»mio , n I have been privately informed that the total area of land to be taken from my principals’ property measures slightly under 400 square metres and that the valuation assessed to-day by the commission appointed by the Municipality is put at under T. £300. This valuation works out about four Meiidies per square metre, while the lowest value of the land exclusive of compensation for disturbance is Mejidies 7 per square metre, or say T. £520. • As I have the intention of refusing to accept the valuation if the assess ment as reported to me is correct, I beg you will have a valuation made for the purpose of placing the matter before His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador to enable him to embody this additional claim with the claim my principals already have against the Turkish Government for demolition of shops and expropriation of property for road widening purposes. I am informed that the Patchachi family, a member of which was formerly the President of the Municipality at Baghdad, who own houses on the west side of the main road, have been instrumental in influencing the decision of the Municipal Authorities to change the direction of the road in order to prevent the demolition of the frontage of their houses which were under notice for expropriation. I have the honour to he, Your Excellency’s most obedient, humble Servant, J. G. LOBIMEB, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Sis Britannic Majesty s Consul-General, Baghdad. To His Excellency the Bight Hon’ble Sir Gerard Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. Note.—N ot sent to Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 1. No. 69, dated Baghdad, the 28th December 1910. From—J. W. Parry, Esq., To—J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty^s Consul-General, Baghdad. new section of the road will cut through their extension premises and the British Club* Garden and Tennis Court in a direct line.4 ■■■■(■■■■i w - Altliough I have to admit that the new section of the road takes a more direct course in joining the north and south sections of the widened road I heg to point out that it is open to doubt whether the trace of the widened road would have been diverted had not a portion of the property it is now intended to take belonged to my principals and had the influence referred to above not Ipeen used with self-interested motives. Further I desire to point out that a road cut diagonally through an almost square portion of land divides it into two sections which by reason of their awkward shape greatly reduce their sale value, while they become practically useless for the purposes of the business carried on by my principals, and I beg of you to take this into consideration in assessing the value they are entitled to receive for compensation. Enclosure No. 2. Memorandum by Mr. Gaskin. be I attach a rough plan showing the line of the new street proposed to cut diagonally through Messrs. Lynch’s yard and the British Club grounds. The line of the new street is based upon private information; as it is not yet pegged out, some slight modification may be made later on by the Municipality Authorities; the actual area of the land to be taken cannot therefore he definitely stated. The plan however serves to show the manner in which Messrs. Lynch’s property will be cut up into unequal parts rendering it unfit for the purposes of the firm’s growing business. I am informed that the total area of the original site of the yard was 3,002 square Dhra’s Ma’mari, and the Tapu deeds give the price of this area at G. S. P. 250,000. The square Dhra’ Ma’mari equals of a square metre ; the 3,002 square Dhra’s are therefore equal to 1,921J square metres. G. S. P. 250,000-^1,921J square metres^G. S. P. 130 per square metre. The Municipality propose taking about 400 square metres, which at S. P. 130=T. Liras 481-2-. The Municipality assess the 400 square metres at about £L. 300, which means a loss of T.L. 181J to Messrs. Lynch on the price given in the Tapu papers. About nine months ago Eliahou Danoos, the proprietor of the British Club premises and other properties to the south of Messrs. Lynch’s yard, refused an offer of £T. 2 per square Dhra’ Ma’mari for the plot on which he has recently built a large house to the south of the house belonging to the estate of the late Iqbal-ud-Dowla shown on the plan. I heard of the offer at the time. Also our Accountant, Mr. M. G. Thaddeus, has knoivledge of it. I have tried to obtain a statement in writing from Eliahou Danoos and the person through whom the offer was made ; but both of them are so terrified of the machinations of the satellites of His Excellency the Wali that they refuse to subscribe to a written statement, though they were told that the matter would he treated as secret. The position of the property of Messrs. Lynch, as will he seen from the plan, is certainly not inferior to that belonging to Eliahou Danoos and is worth equally as much. On the basis of the square Dhra’ Ma’mari being worth £T. 2, the square metre works out at G. S. P. 339; the 400 square metres would therefore he worth G. S. P. 135,000 or £f. 1,255J. I would quote another instance. The land in the neighbourhood of the Bussian Consulate was formerly worth about 20 per cent, less than that in proximity of Messrs. Lynch’s premises. About two years ago the plot of land adjoining the Belgian Consulate was sold by one of the Pachachie family to Mrs. Bazouk Andria at the rate of G. S. P. 162 per square Dra’ of 6,084 square centimetres (this Dra’ is not the Dhra’ Ma’mari). At this rate the square metre works out at G. S. P. 266. If the difference in value of position is added, we get G. S. P. 332 as the price of the square metre. % AUnder these circumstances I think that it will be conceded that Messrs. Lynch are entitled to a rate of G.S.P. 324 per metre for any part of their land not already built upon that may be taken by the Municipality. It is a matter of doubt whether Messrs. Lynch can claim compensation for the reason that the property will be divided into awkward shaped sections. To assess such damage would be most difficult to carry out, and I do not feel competent to do so. I am however of an opinion that if Messrs. Lynch receive the full value of land taken by the Municipality the question of compensation may be set aside. Baghdad; The 2nd January 1911. J.

We have just received eight days’ notice of expropriation of 399^ square metres of land for the new section of the road against payment of £T. 155 - 75. This valuation is a second valuation, reducing the first, which was unsatis factory to the Wali, by half. It works out at exactly G.S.P. 40 per square metre, while the lowest value we put on the land is G.S.P. 140 per square metre. I shall be writing you officially on the subject, hut to-day being mail day I am merely advising you of receipt of the notice in the hope that you will communicate the gross attempt at robbery to His Majesty’s Ambassador which the official notice from the Local Authorities discloses. The commission of valuation consisted of— Mr. Serop Skender, a servant of the Wali and Director of the Adara Nahrieh. Mr. Naaman Pachachie, owner of properties on the west side of the main road which will be saved by the diversion. Colonel Djvad Beg. Mudir of Wakf. Obviously all biassed in favour of the Municipality and completely under the thumb of the Wali. Enclosure No. 4. Memorandum by Mr. J. C. Gaskix, Commercial Assistant, British Consulate-Geneial, Baghdal, dated the 31st January 1911. I have seen Mr. Parry regarding the property through which the Muni cipality propose cutting a new street. He informed me that at the time of the transaction relative to the purchase of the property the bargain was made on the basis of area and no consideration for the presence of the shops on the property was allowed for. (a) The land was purchased at the rate of Gsp. 70 the square Dra’ Ma mari. The square Dra’ Ma’Mari is 80 centimetres square='64 of a square metre. Gsp. 70-r-'64=Gsp; 109 4 per square metre. (b) The actual cost of the land, including all fees, was £ stg. 1,855-7-9= £T. 2,031 = Gsp. 219,348. The total area of the land was 3,002 square Dra’s Ma’mari. 3,002 S. Dra s X'64=1,921 square metres. Gsp. 219,348 -f- 1,921 square metres = Gsp. 114 the square metre. (c) In the title deeds no mention is made of the shops. The title deeds only show the sale of 3,002 Dra’s Ma’mari for Gsp. 250,000. Gsp. 250,000 = 1,921 square metres=Gsp. 130 per square metre. The date of Lynch’s title deeds issued by the Tapu Department is 25th December 1906. Eliahu Huskiel Dannus, the vendor of the above ground, corroborates the above statements. He tells me also that a plot of 600 sqaure Dra’s Ma’mari was sold by him at the rate of Gsp. 100 the square Dra’ Ma’mari to Selim Zebeq on 28th Shabat 1326 (10th March 1908). The price of this plot is given in the title deeds at £T. 600. Gsp. 100 = ‘64=Gsp. 156J per square metre. The above plot was part of the same property of which Lynch’s plot formed a part and was sold one year and nine months later than Lynch’s. 2668 F. D.—■——- 8 A member of tbe Pacbacbi family was one of the Commissioners who valued Lynch’s property at Grsp. 40 the square metre. Another member of the same family has a stable opposite the house occupied by the Wali’s Assistant. This stable is not worth more than Lynch’s land. It would be interesting to see whether the same member of the Com mission would value the stable at Gsp. 40 per square metre, or whether the owner would sell it at double that plus the cost of the superstructure.

As Your Excellency does not admit my official intervention in land cases, and as Your Excellency at the same time complains of my taking action without your knowledge through the British Embassy at Constantinople, I am making this semi-official reference to you as regards the proposed new street through Messrs. Lynch’s property. I am informed that Messrs. Lynch have received a notice of expropriation square metres of ground at a valuation of 40 G. S. P. per square metre. Your Excellency must be aware that this is an absurd undervaluation of the land, yet it has been arrived at by a Commission which, I am told, Your Excellency has appointed from among your own officers with the addition of a personally interested party. I learn also that there was a former valuation, which, though unsatisfactory, was higher than the present one. I protest in the most absolute manner against the intended unjust expropriation, and I request that Your Excellency will appoint a time for me to interview you on the subject. Meanwhile I am reporting the matter to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. I would remind Your Excellency that professions of good will and friendship are valueless when they are accompanied by such acts as that now contemplated. Enclosure No. 6. Copy. Bagdad.

Lorimer, Consul General de Sa Majestd Britannique, Bagdad. Enclosure No. 7. No. 7, dated Baghdad, the 1st February 1911. From—F. W. Parry, Esq., To—J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. In continuation of my letter No. 1 of the 7th ultimo and in confirmation of my unofficial letter of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to submit for your information and official record the history of the extraordinary procedure of the municipal authorities in connection with the expropriation of property belonging to my principals for road improvements. 1. In my letter No. 69 of the 28th December last, I advised you that the Local Government had decided to divert the ^ main road diagonally through a portion of the property, and that a Commission appointed by the Municipality had assessed the amount payable for compensation at under T. £ 300 for 400 square metres of land. This Commission, the principal members of which were— Haji Yassein, Khedery, Mr. Mougel, Engineer to the Municipality, The Mudir of Wakaf Property, A member of the Municipal Council, valued the property on the 27th of December; and I understand from private information, given me by one of its members, that the value had been fixed at Gsp. 80 per square metre but, as that valuation did not satisfy His Excellency the Vali, a second Commission was appointed consisting of— Serop Skender, Director of the Idara Nahrieh, Naaman Patchachi, a member of a family owning several houses on the west side of the main road who had received notice of expropriation under the original widening scheme, and whose property would be saved by diverting the road, Colonel Djavad Bey, Military Engineer on the Vali’s staff, in charge of the road improvements. They valued the land on or about the 20th ultimo and, in accordance with the Notice of Expropriation dated 29th January and received by me onyi i 10 the following day, the original value has been reduced to Gsp. 40 per square metre. Copy of translation of Notice (No. 1) is attached. 2. The prompt action taken by you in response to my letter of the 30th ultimo, has had the effect of withdrawing the Notice of Expropriation. Copy of letter of withdrawal numbered (2) 'is attached. 3 The statement made in the letter that the Notice of Expropriation had been issued by mistake is obviously a subterfuge and illustrated the improper attitude taken up by the Local Government. If it was a mistake, it is impossible to reconcile the statement made in the letter to the effect that the Yilayat had long ago abandoned the idea of making the new section of the road with the fact that the second valuation was made as recently as 11 days ago. Moreover, on the 29th of December I personally called on Colonel Djavad Bey and he shewed me a plan of the new road and square and informed me that the Local Government had decided to carry it out. 4. Having in view the action'of the Municipality in demolishing shops and wall on the same property on the pretext that they were dangerous, the under valuation of the Khan and Office buildings expropriated, and this new attempt to divert the road and form a square, I look with distrust on the letter annulling the Notice of Expropriation and fear further encroachment may be attempted on some later occasion. 5. In order to illustrate the absurdity of the valuation as given in the notice I give the following facts connected with the purchase of the property and the value of the land and the value of the land sold in the immediate neighbourhood, to enabfe you to resist further attempts at unfair valuation by a packed Commission biassed in favour of the Municipality. The portion of the property through which it was contemplated taking the new section of the road is an extension to the business premises and offices occupied by Messrs. Stephen Lynch &amp; Co. It was purchased in September 1906 at a cost of Gsp. 70 per Masons’ Dra of 80 centimeters square. Its actual area is 3,002 Masons’ Sq. Dra, but the purchase was calculated on 3,000 Masons’ Sq. Dra. The sale transfer was registered in the Land Court on the 15th September 1906 (2nd Ilool 1322) under serial number 393, Property No. 183, Muni cipal Circle II, and the area stated is 3,000 Masons’ Dras valued at Gsp. 250,000. Including legal expenses the actual amount paid in Turkish money amounted to G. S. P. 206,189*50. Improvements to the value of Gsp. 11,900 have been made since the pur chase, including a boundary wall which would be destroyed if the road crosses the property. In addition to the fand, five small shops and a store valued at Gsp. 36,225 were included in the purchase. (These shops have been demolished by the Municipal authorities on the pretext that they were dangerous without payment of compensation.) Land next the property on the south side was sold two years ago at Gsp. 108 per Masons’ Dra, and land in the immediate neighbourhood belonging to the family of Mr. Naaman Patchachi, a member of the second Commission of valua tion, at Gsp. 162 per Masons Dra* about 15 months ago. One square metre is equivalent to 1,562 Masons’ square Dra, the value of square metre calculated at the sale value of the land as given above would be Gsp. 168*70 and Gsp. 253*06 respectively. Even presuming the sum paid for these lands was much in excess of ordinary value, a comparison with the value assessed by the Commission, viz., Gsp. 40 per square metre, proves whithout doubt, that the Local Government intended to secure the land against payment of a totally inadequate compensa tion, and it emphasises the fact that the amount they have paid into the Imperial Ottoman Bank as compensation for the expropriation of the Khan '' I—- 11 and Office Buildings, viz., T.£ 508, has been arrived at in the same unfair manner. , . , It is common knowledge that the land in the neighbourhood m which the property is situated has enhanced in value during the last five years at least 60 upr^eent and there would be no difficulty in obtaining Gsp. 140 per square metre to-day under a forced sale, at the same time I could not recommend my Principals to accept such a low figure did they desire to dispose of the property in the ordinary course of business. # ^ , , 1 I have already submitted a claim for fair compensation for the land and huildimrs esnronriated, and I venture to hope that this recent act, which can only be S called an attempt at robbery, will be represented to the proper ciuar ers as an illustration of the impossibility of any attempt to obtain rediess eith through legal channels or by friendly representation at BagMaU. io. 1.

Baghdad, Dear Mr. Eram Bey, 191L I should be obliged if you could speak to Nazim Pasha—if not, I must do so myself—about the annoyance which Mr. Thaddeus is being subjected to in connection with his shop. J First he was told that 2 metres were required from the front, and when he gave this up and prepared to rebuild, he was stopped and told that 21, metres were required. 2 Then he was told that 2 feet and 2 inches were wanted in a side street which he gave up by my advice. When he had done this and begun to build up again, the work was pulled down and it was said that some 6 inches more were required. „ . A ou 1 , laye to ! d me repeatedly that there is no intention of persecutin'* British subjects, but there is clearly malice here on the part of some one towards Mr. Thaddeus. I hope that His Excellency will take measures to stop these childish annoyances and to punish the author. While such troubles continue there can be no confidence between us. Monsieur A. Eram Bey, Political Secretary, Baghdad. Yours truly, J. G. LOBIMEB. S. Q. P. I.—.2668 ?.

A ' &gt; Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 6.) (No. 77.) Sir, Constantinoyle, February 1, 1911. THE detailed valuation of damages inflicted on British subjects at Bagdad, Karbala, and Kadhimain through demolition and expropriations, which His Majesty’s consul-general was requested to furnish, in accordance with the instruction conveyed in your despatch No. 314 of the 18th October last, was received at this embassy on the 16th ultimo. But at the same time, Mr. Lorimer telegraphed to ask that these claims should not be pressed for the moment, so as not to prejudice the negotiations which Sir J. Jackson is pursuing with the vali respecting the contract for irrigation works. The claim was accordingly held up temporarily, but now that Sir J. Jackson has secured his contract, as I had the honour to inform you in my despatch No. 18, Commercial, of the 25th ultimo, I have telegraphed to Mr. Lorimer to say that I propose to put in the claim forthwith. I enclose a copy of Mr. Lorimer’s despatch transmitting his detailed estimates of losses suffered by British subjects. The total amounts to 5,400L, but it may be possible to diminish this amount by some £ T. 780, the value of one building and part of another which, Mr. Lorimer telegraphs, are still standing, though the periodical notice for their demolition has expired. I trust that no further arbitrary acts of this nature will occur at Bagdad until the present claims have been decided, for the Turkish Government have apparently sent categorical instructions to the vali to hold his hand, since the latter has now cancelled the notice of expropriation of Messrs. Lynch’s property, as I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 23 of to-day. I cannot, however, entertain any hope that the Sublime Porte will accept the figures given by Mr. Lorimer without demur, and they will probably insist on a mixed commission examining the claims locally, and, even should an agreement be reached as to the amount equitably due to British subjects, the question of payment will be a further difficulty, as the Central Government at present show no disposition to meet it here, and at Bagdad there are no available funds, until the municipal loan has received parliamentary sanction. Even should it be eventually decided to compensate the victims out of the municipal loan the local authorities will find themselves in a great difficulty in satisfying British claims and ignoring those of Ottoman subjects. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 68.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, December 19, 1910. UNDER the instructions conveyed in your Excellency’s despatch of the 23rd October, 1910, I have the honour to enclose detailed estimates of the losses lately suffered by British subjects owning house and shop property at Bagdad, Kadhimain, and Karbala, in consequence of the action of the local Turkish authorities. The complexity of the enclosures, which contain references to former correspondence, is regretted, but it is unavoidable. At Bagdad the compensation to be demanded has been assessed as follows :— Cost of reconstruction .. .. .. .. .. 3 117*28^ Value of land .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,115*27 Incidental losses .. .. .. .. .. .. 632*56A** I venture to hope that the value of the laud taken, whether exigible or not under the Turkish law, will be demanded of the Turkish Government, for the claim is clearly equitable. In one instance the site was a more important asset than the building (see Enclosure 2 ). It also appears to me that the claim on account of incident' 1 losses is worthy of acceptance. At Kadhimain the compensation proposed is £ T. 89*36, and it is entirely on account of a building destroyed. As the building formed a bridge across a street at some distance above the ground there is no question in this case of loss of site, and no claim has been made on account of incidental losses. At Karbala the compensation due is estimated by the British vice-consul, a copy of my correspondence with whom is enclosed, at £ T. 369;§-. The vice-consul’s report is not so clear as could be wished, but it seems better, as the amounts at stake at Karbala are comparatively small, not to delay the whole case for a second reference to him. The vice-consul’s valuation seems to me to be an under-estimate, inasmuch as it does not, except in the case of Haji Mirza Ahmad’s shop, include anything on account of loss of ground. If your Excellency, as I respectfully recommend, presses for compensation on account of land as well as on account of buildings, the sum of £T. 76*02 might be claimed under that head and the head of incidental losses at Karbala, which would not be excessive, and would make up the total amount of the Karbala claim to £ T. 445*52J. The three persons described by the vice-consul as having waived their rights only did so because they did not think that they could get satisfaction locally, and they should not therefore be now excluded from the list of persons entitled to compensation. The whole bill, if my proposals are approved, will be as follows :— Bagdad .. Kadhimain Karbala .. £ T. .. .. 4,865-111 . .. .. 89-36 .. .. 445-521 Total .. .. 5.400-00 I have, &amp;c. J. G.

Gaskin, who took measure ments of the remains of the demolished portion of the house. In my despatch No. 42 of the 5th September, 1910,1 spoke of this house as “ old and possibly insecure,” but Mr. Gaskin, who knew it well, informs me that it was capable of standing for some years more. Eram Bey, the Vali’s political secretary, was himself living in it when it was condemned. It was the first house of a British subject to be destroyed, and, unpre pared as I was then for un scrupulous action on the part of the local authorities, I did not take the precaution of inspecting it personally. . detailed estimate was sub mitted with my despatch No. 62 of the 17th November, 1910. In case the amount shown for ground taken should appear high, I may explain that at Bagdad, as a rule, the annual rent of premises is taken to be 3 per cent, of their capital value. Mr. Thaddeus at present ob tains a rent of £ T. 20 a-year (and had been offered not long ago one of £7*35) for this shop, which would make its capital value on the prin ciple described £ T. 666 , and the capital value of the por tion lost (f of the whole) £ T. 199. This figure agrees very closely with that given in the detailed estimate, detailed estimate for a part (amounting to £ T. 887*67^) was submitted with my des patch No. 62 of the 17th November, 1910; a supple mentary detailed estimate for the remainder (amounting to £ T. 280*60) is attached.

Consul-General Lorimer to Vice-Consul Mohsin. (No. 1075.) gi r? Bagdad, December 2, 1910. UNDER orders received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, I have the honour to request that you will immediately prepare a detailed estimate of the losses suffered by British subjects, owners of immovable property at Karbala, through the recent proceedings of the local authorities. The estimate should be prepared in the form of a statement showing the particulars of each building demolished or expropriated separately. The principal [1894 /—l] P&gt;10 particulars are measurements and value of the building removed, measurements and value of the site taken, and whether demolition was complete or partial. In each case, it should be noted whether the building was dealt with under the law of buildings or that of expropriation, and whether the legal formalities were observed. If any of tlf' buildings were demolished on the ground of their being in a dangerous condition, it should be stated whether they were really dangerous or not. At Bagdad, it is an understood principle that the capital value of an immovable property is 33J times its annual rent, and if any similar rule is recognised at Karbala you should apply it to your calculations of the value of building and site together as a check upon their correctness. The estimates should be drawn up in consultation with the owners or their agents and with any other persons from whom you can obtain useful assistance. They should represent the true market values of the properties, or of the portions of them taken, without over or under valuation. The following are the owners whose cases you have so far brought to my notice, but there may now be others having cases :— Haji Mirza Ahmad (Akhbari), two cases. Haji Zein-ul-Abidin (Akhbari), one case Muhammad Ali Agha (Dayi), one case. As you will remember, I instructed you on the 18th October “ to take very careful account of the value of British subjects’ buildings before they are destroyed, so that we may be in a position to prove the actual loss to British subjects if it should be decided eventually to claim compensation from the municipality.” I hope, therefore, that you have all the necessary materials ready to hand, and will be able to send the report now required by return of post without undue haste. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Mohsin to Consul-General Larimer. (No. 233.) Si r &gt; Karbala, December 9, 1910. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1075, dated the 2nd instant, ordering that I should send you a detailed estimate of the losses suffered by British subjects, owners of immovable property at Karbala, through the recent proceedings of the local authorities. 2. In my former reports I stated that the authorities did not act according to any law, nor did they observe the legal formalities except in two cases of British subjects (namely, Ali Hashim and Zein-ul-Abidin), in which notices were given to them to demolish and rebuild at their own expense, and in spite of their urging reasonable excuses they compelled them to carry out their order. The compulsion was done by threats and underhand dealings which forced the owners to either comply or undergo the consequences, which were, perhaps, heavier than the cost of rebuilding their property. Two things, which evidently took the place of legal formalities, however, preceded their operation, viz., a verbal warning to vacate the property during the day and the demolition of the roofing of the bazaar at night, which rendered the places unfit for occupation. 3. British subjects’ losses are of two kinds : the first, a loss suffered on account of rebuilding the frontage of their property at their own expense ; and the second, which is heavier, includes the first, together with the value of the ground taken in excess of a-quarter, and, in one or two cases, the whole of the property. 4. Sufferers of the first kind, whose properties were partially demolished, are eight persons with 26|- shops, for the rebuilding of which they have spent a sum of about 267|- liras.^ Of these, three persons with seven shops and 91 liras may be excepted as having waived their rights by giving me a statement to that effect, and the rest are such as they still wish to recover their expenses if possible. The accompanying schedule, marked (A), shows the names and other details of the persons who come under this heading. 5. Sufferers of the second kind are, first, Haji Mirza Ahmad (Akhbari), who owns one-half of a^shop, which was 16 feet long by 4 ft. 9 in. wide. Of this the authorities expropriated 7 inches more than a-quarter of the whole, which, according to its rent of11 l ts and ^ case, ln gs or Kit jovable Karbala ^as a agents slionld taken, 'areful o tkt 'efore, d the R. 910. ,ed tk uffered recent to any objects &gt;' lem to sonable one by ndergo y tbeir owever, die day places jpted as restare lanyi^ io come 20 o# f pities rented 5 liras per annum, is worth 100 liras. The value of the 7 inches is therefore about 4 liras, of which one-half belongs to Mirza Ahmad. The shop was demolished partially. . ^ ie °^ er case of Mirza Ahmad is the bazaar piece of the ground in front of his t.aisariyeh which is wanted to he given to him on his satisfying the owner of an opposite shop who had lost 50 liras’ worth of property. The piece of ground in question is 9 ft. 3 in. long by 2 ft. 2 in. wide on one side and 1 ft. 5 in. on the other. Its market value for any buyer besides the Akhbari, who may convert it into a shop by blocking up the door of the kaisariyeh, is 50 liras, but for the Akhbari himself it is worth nothing. The case is still pending. 6. Secondly, Seyyid Muhammad Kashmeri, who had two shops, each on one side of a wall, facing in different directions. The smaller, which was lately demolished without compensation, was 7 ft. 4 in. long by 2 ft. 2 in. deep on one side and 2 ft. 7 in. on the other, and it fetched a rent of 3 liras per annum. The market value, together with the two columns of wall which stood on both sides of it, was 60 liras. The bigger was only partially demolished, and the over expropriation from this shop,, which I reported in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910, was given up, so that his actual loss of site was less than a quarter. 7. Thirdly, Agha Davee, whose property was completely demolished. It was a large building 20 metres long by 3J- metres wide on the top of an arch, under which people used to frequent. He owned only one-quarter of it; the other three-quarters belonged to a Turkish subject. He bought the place for 80 liras according to his title-deed, because it was mortgaged with him and the original owner refused to pay him the amount. Its market value at the time of its demolition was only 40 liras, and its rent 2 liras per annum. The Government demolished the whole of this building in order to remove the arch and widen the road. The enclosed schedule, marked (B), refers to the losses suffered by the foregoing persons. 8. In estimating the measurements, rents, values, and the losses mentioned in this letter and the accompanying papers, I have, besides my personal knowledge, consulted with the owners of the property and two other experts who had also sufficient informa tion of the Indians’ cases. In Karbala the value of an immovable property is generally estimated at twenty times its annual rent, but in some cases this changes a little according to special conditions of the property. 9. Out of all cases mentioned in the enclosed papers not a single one was demolished, whether partially or completely, on the ground of its being old and dangerous. They were, in fact, very strong, and the demolition was made only to improve and widen the road. 10. The statements contain only those cases which have happened up to date; there are of course many other shops, houses, &amp;c., which may come hereafter. I have, &amp;c. M. H.

(No. 24.) n inn gi r Pera, January 11 , lyii. ’ WHEN I called on Rifaat Pasha on the 28th ultimo, his Excellency told me that he had just received a series of reports from the Vali of Bagdad, which would enable him to send me a reply to the various written communications of the embassy relative to the demolitions and expropriations of the properties of certain British subjects at Bagdad; but, although, as on previous interviews, his Excellency^ professed himseli anxious to settle these questions to our satisfaction in accordance with law and equity, I thought that I detected in his efforts to explain how difficult it was for the Central Government to exercise any control over Nazim Pasha the consciousness that the reply would be unsatisfactory. I must confess, however, that I was not prepared to receive the note, copy enclosed, which reached me on the 5th instant, and which is m enect, as you will see, a statement that, according to Nazim Pasha, everything in the matter, both of the expropriation and demolition, was carried out according to l aw - . ne statement in particular, viz., that the municipality knows nothing of the demolition of the house of Ahmed Ali, is specially disingenuous. A part of the house m question was actually pulled down on the 11th and 12th November, but, as Ahmed All is dead, the municipality is pleased to profess ignorance of the matter. A copy of my reply to this note is also enclosed. I at once wrote to Rifaat Pasha to ask for an early appointment, and when I saw his Excellency on the 6 th instant I told him that I was frankly indignant at receiving such a communication. The Minister of the Interior had promised, and he himself had confirmed the promise, that proper compensation would be paid ; yet, in spite of those assurances, he had addressed to me a note which merely showed that the Government were ready to swallow the misrepresentations and falsehoods of a recalcitrant municipality, and that they expected me to do the same. Both he and the Minister of the Interior knew perfectly well that the demolitions had been arbitrary and unjustifiable on the alleged pretext of the insecurity of the buildings, and that, as for the expropriations, there could be no possible doubt that articles 3 and 14 (and perhaps others) of the law had not been fulfilled. His Excellency said that, if this was so, Messrs. Lynch could have recourse to the law, as Turkey was now a constitutional country ; to which I retorted that the future of the constitutional regime seemed rather black when the authorities, who should set the example of respect for the law, were the first to violate it, and I requested his Excellency to telegraph to Bagdad to^ enquire whether the provisions of the two articles I had specified had been complied with. On returning to the embassy, I found the telegram from Mr. Lorimer (of the substance of which I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 3 of the 7th instant), stating that, out of fear of the yali, Messrs. Lynch were unable to find a lawyer willing to act for them. On the 8 th I again called on the Minister, and informed him that Messrs. Lynch’s agents were unable to have recourse to legal proceedings, as all the better class of lawyers in Bagdad declined to take up the case for fear of offending the local authorities. ^ At this his Excellencly exclaimed, “ What, does his tyranny go so far as that ? ” to which I replied that his Excellency possibly now realised what the state of affairs at Bagdad was. I then asked if he had received a reply from Bagdad as to the fulfilment of articles 3 and 14 of the Expropriation Law. Rifaat Pasha answered that, before putting the question to the vali, he had wished to consult the Turkish text of the law, as it seemed strange that the onus of appealing to the law courts should be laid on the authorities. I said that I had assured myself that the French translation which I had quoted to him was accurate, and that, moreover, the practice in Con stantinople was, I was informed, in accordance with it, which his Excellency seemed inclined to doubt. I then asked his Excellency if he had, as I had requested him to do two days before, telegraphed instructions to the Vali of Bagdad not to proceed with the further [1851 ? —2] !les thermites. Le proprietaire avait ete, d’ailleurs, avise et le consulat informe de cette decision. . j j 4.

Sublime Porte, le 4 janvier, 1911. , Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Note verbede communicated to Sublime Porte by Mr. Marling. HIS Britannic Majesty’s Embassy have had the honour to receive the Sublime Porte’s note verbale of the 4 th instant, relative to the expropriation of part of the premises of Messrs. Lynch and to the demolition of other properties belonging to that firm and to other British subjects. _ . . In the above-mentioned note the Sublime Porte states that the expropriation ol the property belonging to Messrs. Stephen Lynch was canied out according to the Law of Expropriation. According to the information received by the embassy on the subject, this is not the case, inasmuch as the expropriation was not made in viitue of a decision of the competent tribunal, as provided by articles 3 and 14 of the said law. ^ As regards the demolitions, as His Majesty s Embassy has already pointed out m previous communications, they were effected by force and without the consent of the proprietors, who took steps to prove to the local authorities that the buildings m question did not threaten collapse. In view of the protestations of the owners, the municipal authorities should have, m accordance with the established usage, had an examination of the buildings carried out by experts appointed by both paities, and, in the event of the failure of these joint experts to agree, article 63 of the Code of Civil Procedure should have been applied. _ As regards the statement in the Sublime Porte’s note verbale ol the 4th January, to the effect that the Bagdad municipality had no knowledge of the demolition of the property of Ahmed All Khan, this property was, according to the official information which has reached His Majesty’s Embassy, demolished on the 11th and 12th November. ^ His Majesty’s Embassy is confident that, in the light of these facts, the Sublime Porte will admit that there has been substantial violation of the law to the serious prejudice of British subjects, and will not fail to take the necessary steps to indemnify them for their losses in accordance with the law.

Foreign Office to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. % \ Gentlemen, Foreign Office, January 7, 1911. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the* 21 st ultimo and of the ^nd instant regarding the demolition of part of your premises at Bagdad by the Turkish local authorities. With regard to the statement in the former of your letters above referred to that, “ in accordance with the interview which Mr. H. F. B. Lynch had at the Foreign Office on the 7th December, our ageuts will take no legal steps at Bagdad unless we hear from you that you desire us to do so, ,, I am to explain that two different categories of action have been taken by the local authorities at Bagdad in regard to your premises. In the first case, alleging that the wall enclosing your grounds was unsafe, they caused it to be destroyed in virtue of municipal regulations. In this instance, the case having been represented to the central Government at Constantinople, it was arranged that legal proceedings should not be taken. The later demolitions, however, purported to be carried out in virtue of the Expropriation Law, a translation of which will be found in Young’s “ Corps de Droit ottoman,” vol. vi, pp. 127 to 131. In regard to these proceedings there was no intention of recommending to you that legal proceedings would be inadvisable. If your property at Bagdad has been illegally expropriated, and the provisions of the law have not been complied with, it appears to Sir E. Grey, after further consultation with His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Constantinople, that your firm’s remedy is to institute proceedings against the competent Turkish authority (1) for wrongful expropriation which has been already effected, and ( 2 ) to restrain any further wrongful expropriation which may be threatened, and that you should lose no time in taking such steps as your own legal advisers may recommend with a view to the commencement of the suggested proceedings. * I am, &amp;c.

WITH further reference to the subject of the demolition of our premises and factory at Bagdad by the local Turkish Government, we have the honour to report that we have just received a telegram from our agents in Bagdad to the effect that the local Government have decided upon a fresh and very serious encroachment upon our property. Not satisfied with demolishing that portion of our enclosure and buildings which faces the main road, they now propose to take this road diagonally through our property in order to avoid the cost of compensating the owners of other buildings aligning the road. Our agents are forwarding to us by post a plan showing the nature of this fresh expropriation, which they report involves the cession of a further 400 square metres of land. In the absence of all hope of obtaining justice locally, we would invite the serious attention of His Majesty’s Government to the extraordinary state of affairs prevailing in Bagdad, and appeal to them for protection. Our agents telegraph that the work of demolishing our premises facing the present road was almost completed on the 23rd ultimo. The advice of His Majesty’s consul-general in Bagdad containing the valuation approved by himself as compensation for the expropriations which we have previously reported to you must have reached the[embassy at Constantinople by this time. We would request that a telegram may be sent to His Majesty’s charge d’affaires in Constantinople instructing him to demand immediate payment of this sum by the Central Government, in order to* supply us with funds for commencing the work of reconstruction, and also to insist that no fresh scheme such as that of running the road diagonally through our property shall be executed until the full amount of the assess ment of compensation for the previous expropriations had been paid to us by the Central Government, and until ample time has been given us for the consideration of the effect upon our property of the new proposal.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 815 of the 8 th ultimo, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad, reporting on two cases of demolition by the local authorities of the properties of British subjects. As soon as I receive a complete list of these cases, I shall not fail to put in a claim at the Sublime Porte for the losses which have thus been caused to British subjects. I n q Tro /frc* ’ CHARLES M. MARLING. (if) Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 62. Confidential.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, November 17, 1910. IN continuation of the correspondence ending with my despatch No. 53 of the 7th October, IvtlO, I have the honour to report that the front of Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop‘ :i: ' and part of the front of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan’s house! have now been destroyed as dangerous—though they were not dangerous—in addition to the wallj and shops belonging to Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co., and part of the Ikbal-ul-Daulah house,§ the demolition of which had already been reported by me. I have had the honour of informing your Excellency by telegram, from time to time, of the progress of these events, and of soliciting your Excellency’s assistance, but it was impossible for me to report by wire the entire circumstances of the two latest demolitions. Some particulars of them will be found in Enclosure 2 to this despatch, illustrating the perverse spirit in which the vilayet have acted with regard to them. Enclosures 3 and 5 to the present despatch are memoranda by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, the commercial assistant in this residency, who is an expert in building questions at Bagdad, containing estimates of the compensation to which Mr. G. Thaddeus and Sufiyah Khanum, the widow of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan, appear to justly entitled. Mr. Gaskin finds that the cost of restoring the front part of Mr. Thaddeus’s shop will be £ T. 29 2 g.s.p, and that the value of the ground belonging to it, appropriated for the public street, is £ T. 177 74 g.s.p.; total, £ T. 206 76 g.s.p. In the case of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan’s house, the cost of rebuilding is estimated by Mr. Gaskin at £ T. 786 105J- g.s.p., and the value of the area taken for the street at £ T. 100 70 g.s.p ; total, £ T. 887 67|- g.s.p. Both buildings are situated on the present main artery of longitudinal communication in Bagdad, where frontage is naturally very valuable. / . Since my despatch No. 42 of the 5th September, 1910, was written, I have had ( frequent occasion to refer to the text of the Turkish Expropriation and Building Laws, and I am now inclined to think that articles 8 and 13 of the latter do not bar a claim for compensation on account of ground taken, unless the ground is unbuilt upon. In both the present cases the ground taken was altogether built over, and in that of Mr. Thaddeus’s shop it amounted to more than one-fourth of the whole property ; but this latter fact, in my altered view, has no bearing on the question of compensation. The princpal loss to Mr. Thaddeus is that of a very valuable plot of land, and I am * Item No. 5 in my despatch No. 42 of the 5th September, 1910. f Item No. 6 in the same, j Item No. 1 in the same. § Item No. 4 in the same. [1814 ee-4] Bo£ opinion that ground compensation should he demanded on behalf of both proprietors. The chicanery by which the vilayet have sought to substitute demolition proceedings for legal expropriation is an additional strong reason for not waiving any part of the COmP irf‘telegram todated the 12th November, 1910, which if repeated to the Government of India, as Indian subjects of Hrs Bntanmc Majesty were principally affected, I remarked on the alarm to British subjects and the injury to British prestige which the successful execution by the local Government ol their unscrupulous designs, notwithstanding my persistent protests, had occasioned. U nt il the rights of Sur subjects and the credit of our Government have been vindicated by visible means, such as the recovery of compensation, our national position IWdad will continue to be very unsatisfactory, and may be exposed to fresh attacks, and f rerefore r P ectfully beg that your Excellency will take the observes contained in my telegram into very careful consideration. ^ &amp;c J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum of Circumstances connected with the Partial ^emohtwnofMr. G. Thaddeus’s Shop and the House of the late Nawab Ahmad Ah Khan. Mr. G. Thaddeus's Shop. ON the 26th October Eram Bey, the vali’s political secretary, called and informed me that his Excellency bad decided to refer the state of the shop to a French architect (not engineer), M. Godard,* who has lately been taken into the Turkish service gentleman, he assured me, might be relied on to deliver a candid and unbiassed opinion, independent of one already given by Colonel Javad Bey, the vah s engm r. Bv my advice, Mr. M. Thaddeus, a son of the proprietor of the shop, at once called on Eram Bey to ask that he might be sent for, as his father s representative, when the shop was inspected by M. Godard ; but Eram Bey told him, considerably to his surprise, that the inspection had already taken place. On Mr. Thaddeus s enquiring the result, however, he was told that it was “ rather favourable to his lather. Notwithstanding this semi-assurance, it became apparent, on the 3rd November, that the front of the shop was about to be demolished after all. I accordingly wrote to Eram Bey for an explanation, and the next morning he came and informed me verbally that M. Godard had placed him in a very difficult position by a change of opinion. Meanwhile, Mr. Thaddeus (junior), by my advice, had personally visited M. Godard and discussed matters with him. M. Godard seems to have evaded a direct question by Mr. Thaddeus as to whether he considered the shop dangerous, an to have limited himself to saying that it was “ not strong ’’ At the same time he admitted, according to Mr. Thaddeus, that nearly every building m Bagdad would fall On the 7th November the shop was partially dismantled by municipal agency. It had been my contention all along that the shop was a timber-lrame structure, and that its strength did not depend on the brick-fillmg between the beams, w ic filling, though nearly perpendicular, was not absolutely so. The correctness of my assertion was now demonstrated by the fact that, after all the bricks m the front a been removed, the frame stood as firmly as before, supporting the roof, m whic condition it was allowed by the municipality to remain for some days. I ascertained these facts by a personal inspection on the 8 th November On the 10th November Eram Bey told me that M. Godard had discovered that the foundations (“ fondement ”) of the shop were of wood, and that the wood was rotten. I took an opportunity of visiting the shop the same day, the front minus t e bricks being then still standing, and found that, as I thought, the statement was untrue. The foundations were of brick, and contained no wood, and the wood-work which rested on the foundations was perfectly sound. * See Monthly Summary of Events, September 1910.House of the late Nawab Ahmad 'Ali Khan. ^ On the evening of the 7th November, the day of the dismantling of Mr. Thaddens’s sSKp, the family of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan were informed that a portion of their house in question, which had been pronounced dangerous though not really so would he demolished. The next morning (the 8 th) Eram Bey visited me, and requested me verbally to send a dragoman to see to the removal of furniture, &amp;c., from the rooms aftected. After visiting the house, to satisfy myself of its condition, I replied, m writing, t a I could not take any steps to facilitate the proceedings, which I regarded as totally uniustifiable. I also observed that only part of the house was old or open to criticism, and that that part was repairable. Eram Bey replied, taking general exception o my attitude, but mentioning for the first time that only the old part was to be demolisliecl. On the 9th November I received an official letter from the vilayet, repeating tne request already made through Eram Bey, and fixing the demolition for the next day at 8 o’clock (Turkish). I answered that if an assurance were given that, should the land cleared by the demolition be taken for the street, the municipality would pay the cost of reconstructing the front and interior of the house upon the new alignment, i should be happy to comply with his Excellency’s wishes, but that otherwise I must abstain from an act which might be construed as indicating acquiescence, and the municipality must proceed in the matter on their own responsibility and at their own risk. On the 11th and 12th November the old part and some of the new part o± the house were demolished by municipal labourers. The ostentatious violence with wffiich this was done has been remarked on, in conversation with me, by various persons ; but the details are mostly unimportant. Old carved windows, &lt;kc., were hurled in the street instead of being carefully removed, and even the broken fragments which remained disappeared during the night. 1 have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMEB.

ROUGH plans of the house of the late Nawab Ahmed ’Ali Khan, and estimates of cost of restoring the front and interior in the same style as before its demolition by the municipality, and the value of the land appropriated by the latter are attached. Owing to a rise in the prices of building materials the rates per cubic metre have been readjusted accordingly. Before the house was demolished I held the opinion that it was not dangerous and that it would hold out a few more years, and with some repairs could be made solid. I saw the alleged dangerous part of the house while it was being pulled down, and consequently saw the internal condition of the walls, and I found no reason to modify my previous views. Further, the entrance hall and rooms above it were found to be solidly built and strong, and there was not the slightest justification for the destruction of that part of the house. It is very evident that the alleged dangerous condition of the house was put forward merely as a pretext for pulling it down, with the object of justifying the acquirement of a portion of the ground for the purpose of adding to the width of the road without having to pay for it. In pulling down the front wall no care was taken to save the woodwork of the two shahnishins, the ceilings, and the side of the large upper room ; and it has been unnecessarily and ruthlessly destroyed. A large portion of the beams and posts have been removed by the orders of the municipality to be sold for the purpose of defraying the expense of demolition. The amount shown in the estimate is not the true loss. The courtyard of the house is only 7'87 metres long by 7*21 metres broad, and if the front part of the house is taken 2|- metres backwards the courtyard will be 7’87 metres long and 4*71 metres broad—a narrow alley—detracting much from the value of the site of the house generally. The sum that may be paid eventually for the appropriated ground will not recompense the owners for the shrinkage in the value. J. C. G ASKIN, Commercial Assistant.

[46229] No. 1 . n r r Messrs. Lynch Brothers to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 22.) 3, Salters' Roll Court, Cannon Street, E.C., Sir, December 21, 1910. WE have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant on the subject of the demolition of our premises in Bagdad. We are telegraphing to our agents in Bagdad enquiring upon what law the Turkish authorities are relying for the legality of their action in demolishing these premises ; but our agents have already informed us that the constitution of the com mission which has acted in this matter is apparently not in accordance with law. The facts, moreover, that a considerable part of our premises was taken and the walls demolished on the ground that it menaced public safety, which was demonstrably untrue, and that the sums hitherto offered for compensation are so small as to be frivolous, make it clear that we cannot hope for any justice to be meted out to us in Bagdad, where the new Governor-General, Nazim Pasha, has been acting in a wholly arbitrary and high-handed way. Our agents have received instructions to present a formal protest in writing to the local Turkish Government, but, in accordance with the interview which Mr. H. F. B. Lynch had at the Foreign Office on the 7th December, our agents will take no legal steps in Bagdad unless we hear from you that you desire us to do so. We have pointed out to you in previous despatches that any lawyer whom we might be able to persuade to take up the case, would, under present circum stances, be greatly influenced by fear of the Governor-General. We also urged upon you the point that to commence proceedings in Bagdad would probably have the effect of weakening the case of the embassy, and that this is a matter which must be settled with the central Government. However, we will, of course, defer to your wishes, should you consider that it would help our case, to initiate proceedings locally. We should be obliged if you could kindly procure from the British Embassy in Constantinople a copy of the law of expropriation upon which the Turkish Govern ment rely. We have, &amp;c. LYNCH BROTHERS. []814 y—3]'U&amp;mm [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] regards its source :— , The proceedings of Nazim Pasha since his arrival in Bagdad, and especially j latterly, would seem to indicate some mental derangement. Nazim Pasha is well known to Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, who passed much of his time in his society during the dramatic events in Constantinople in April-May 1909. At that time he was a sensible, grave old man, who inspired confidence and did not lose his head in spite of the exciting occurrences in which he was a leading actor. It is difficult to reconcile his present proceedings with the impression which he produced in the spring of 1909. Not only is he acting in a manner which for arbitrariness has not, so far as we are aware, been matched by any of his predecessors at Bagdad, but his conduct would seem to show a lack of mental balance. Writing on the 29th October, our Bagdad agent informed us that, since the arrival of Nazim Pasha, two presidents of the municipality have resigned their office. The last resignation is said to have been due to the refusal of the president to comply with an order given by a member of the Governor-General’s staff to certify a building belonging to a British-Indian subject as in a dangerous condition, and also to the fact that the Governor-General attempted to force money out of the president for municipal works. The first president, who was appointed by Nazim Pasha himself, was removed from office because he refused to give his daughter in marriage to him. On the 16th November our agent reports further that the director of the Turkish Government steamers has^ received notice to give up his post, the reason being believed to be the refusal of this official to permit his daughter to marry the Governor-General’s private secretary. In view of the large British interests m Bagdad the present deplorable state of things there cannot fail to be of concern to His Majesty s Government. ^siatic turkey and Arabia.

Sir, Constantinople, November 29, 1910. THE surmise that I ventured to make in my despatch No. 843 of the 22nd instant, that it was the intention of the “ committee ” to bring about the recall and disgrace of Nazim Pasha, appears to receive confirmation from a recent telegram I have received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad, reporting the rumours current as to the mission of Ismail Hakki Bey Babanzadeh. Mr. Lorimer says that the supposed object of his visit was to report on (1) Muntefik affairs ; (2) British designs on Bussorah ; and (3) Mazim Pasha’s conduct of affairs generally, and that one result of the reports sent by the deputy in a secret cypher to the Grand Vizier and Minister of War is that Nazim has been instructed to proceed to the Muntefik country, an order which the vali is very reluctant to obey. Ismail Hakki has also been instructed to report whether, in his opinion, Nazim Pasha should be entrusted with the expenditure of the loan which the municipality of Bagdad is contracting with the National Bank. Sir H. Babington Smith informs me that that operation, which was being discussed in the Council of Ministers, has now been referred back to the Council of State merely to give time for Ismail Hakki’s report to reach Constantinople, and it seems to be a legitimate inference .that the Council of Ministers expect a report adverse to the vali. In my above-mentioned despatch I reported that Ismail Hakki had also been deputed to examine the complaints, both foreign and native, as to the recent arbitrary demolitions of house property, &amp;c. The “ Tanin,” of the 25th, gives some extracts— translation of which I have the honour to transmit to you—of his reports, which in substance amount to a damaging criticism of the proceedings carried out in the vali’s name. It is taken for granted that compensation will be paid to those who have suffered by the projected street improvements, and it is suggested that 10 per. cent., or even 20 per cent., more than the sums now being offered would be well spent if the public excitement can thereby be calmed. Rifaat Pasha, to whom I spoke on this question yesterday, informed me that compensation would certainly be paid, but he would not commit himself to promising that the sums claimed would be paid in full. I told him that Mr. Lorimer had been called on to furnish a list, carefully revised by himself, of British claims, and that I should present it as soon as it reached me, with a request for a settlement in full. I n vp cyc * CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “ Tanin ” of November 25, 1910. (Translation.) The Possibility of Prosperity for Bagdad. NAZIM PASHA desires to widen the streets of the town, particularly those suitable for electric tramways. Probably about 90,000£. of the Bagdad loan will be devoted to constructing a road 22 metres wide as nearly as possible parallel to the river. This is a very necessary project, but it has given rise to a great deal of talk. Some suggest making the road farther from the river, where it would contribute to the prosperity of the outlying parts, while costing only one-third as much as the projected road ; but the road is needed in the commercial part of the town, and would be useless in open ground. Some do not wish to be compelled to leave houses in which their families have lived for generations, while others are doubtful whether they will get compensation if their houses are demolished. Everyone is in a state of anxiety ; but this feeling of fear and apprehension can be dispelled by repeated notices, by influential [1814 e—S] /4,cv?.£V.,..advice, and by active steps. Statesmanship and political necessity require that for a project to succeed it must be treated, not meanly and narrowly, but in a broad and lofty spirit; and it would be better to add 10 per cent, to the compensation money paid on expropriation if the minds of the people could be calmed and quieted thereby. This^- 10 per cent, would not really be excessive, for it may cost 10 or even 20 per cent, to move and to build or buy a new house. The Government did not disregard the rights of even the leaders of the despotic regime; and, of course, the Bagdad municipality will not and ought not to “ eat ” the value of poor people’s property. The anxiety of the people is not altogether without foundation. As a matter of fact the municipality, acting according to the Municipalities’ Regulations, and, as a matter of urgency, recently widened certain streets and bazaars which were so narrow and crowded as to be unable to accommodate the people. In the course of the work some walls were pulled down on the ground that they “ were in danger of falling into ruin,” and not a farthing of compensation was paid ; the engineers, seeing that the walls were bulging a little, considered them in danger of collapsing, and demolished them without compensation. In spite of this, many people, seeing that after the demolition of the walls the value of, say, their shops had increased, were grateful. But some have rightly said that their rights have been disregarded. It is true that in an architecturally perfect town which is kept in good repair, walls which “ threaten collapse ” ought to be demolished ; but to apply this to Bagdad would mean razing the city to the ground; for even the newest walls are convex, the minarets are crooked, and the upper part of the building of Imam Ali’s tomb itself is leaning. If this is the case in Bagdad, to say it “ threatens to collapse ” of places outside the city would mean not leaving one stone upon another—a state of affairs obviously incompatible with justice and equity. These considerations have shown the municipality that its empty coffers cannot be made to gleam by applying the “threatens collapse” rule. Now, more than ever, municipalities ought to respect the theory that he who pays the piper calls the tune. To promote the prosperity of towns is a necessity; but it is a still more urgent necessity to respect the law. Nevertheless, the number of those who think that they have cause for complaint against the municipality is small, and it is this small number which is responsible for the cry of “threatens collapse ” which is on every tongue. In order to put an end to this cry of “threatens collapse” and to trouble in the two streets which are to be opened up, the vali has formed a real property estimation commission composed of notables. Let us see what form the trouble will take now.[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ^ ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [37546] No. 1. Sir G. LovXher to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 17.) (No. 727.) Sir, Constantinople, October 12, 1910. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, reporting certain false allegations made by Hikmet Pasha, the commodore, regarding British action in the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [October 17.] X ^0 \c Section 7. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 54.) Sir, Bussorah, September 16, 1910. I LEARN privately that Hikmet Pasha, the commodore, recently sent a report to the Minister of Marine to the effect that if he was not supplied with another gun-boat and a transport-ship the English were likely to take Bussorah. About two weeks ago the vali received an urgent telegram on the subject, asking him to report the facts. The vali replied that he noticed no indications of such an intention on the part of the English, and that the report was unfounded, but, in any case, a gun-boat and a transport-ship would not prevent them. Hikmet Pasha seems to have won the confidence of Nazim Pasha, the Vali of Bagdad, and is undoubtedly intriguing against Suleiman Nazif Bey, the Vali of Bussorah, with whom he is not at present on speaking terms. I understand their differences are partly due to questions relating to the provisioning of the naval barracks and the crew of the “Marmaris,” and partly to an unjustifiable claim put forward by Hikmet Pasha for a sumptuary allowance of 15 liras a-month for the entertainment of foreigners, which sum he asked to be paid out of the vilayet revenue. The vali said he did not entertain, and was not entitled to the allowance. The arrangements for paying the “ fleet ” seem somewhat imperfect, and the quarrel may have been embittered by the reported action of the captain of the gun-boat stationed near Ghermet Ali, above Bussorah, who is alleged to have invited the local mal mudiri to pay him an official visit on the national fete day and to have arrested him on board during the visit because he had not paid the captains salary. The mal mudiri is said to have paid up, but complained to the vali that the captain had spoilt his fete day. Hikmet Pasha seems to have decided anti-English proclivities, and is no doubt nettled by our unwillingness to assist him in his schemes for the improvement of the bar, reported in my despatches Nos. 37, 40, and 44, of the 22nd June and the 1st and 12th July respectively. His mendacious reports respecting British action in regard to Bussorah may be due to spite or to a desire to attract public attention. He seems ill qualified to occupy a position of importance.

Lynch’s head offices at a price little more than a third of that estimated by their local manager, that it is rumoured locally that the temporary permission to tow barges given in 1899 is about to be withdrawn, and that the general effect produced on British subjects was so deplorable that some of them—presumably Indian Moslems—were actually becoming Ottoman subjects mainly owing to the apparent inability of the British authorities to afford them proper protection. Mr. Lorimer also expresses the opinion that the Bagdad municipal loan should not be entrusted to the present local Government, or in any case should not be given until the question of compensation to British subjects has been settled.

The Minister of the Interior has, moreover, declared that the Government has decided to pay such indemnities “ should it be proved that the regulations on the subject have been contravened.” In reply to the remark that after the buildings were removed it was difficult to prove that they were not in a dangerous state before demolition, he replied that there had also been numerous strong complaints from natives whose property had been similarly treated, that the matter might come up in Parliament, that one of the Bagdad committee deputies had received secret instructions to investigate the whole affair, that his conclusions seemed most damaging to the vali, that both native and foreign subjects would have to be indemnifled, and that all his (the Minister’s) colleagues were in favour of recalling Nazim Pasha. General Nazim Pasha has the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian, and is rather the type of a blunt soldier who is ignorant, as his recent methods at Bagdad have shown, of the niceties of civil administration. As you are aware, he has been an opponent of the committee, and early in 1909 was suddenly appointed Minister of War by Kiamil Pasha, with the idea of compelling the officers to cease dabbling in politics. This excited the fierce anger of the committee, who promptly brought about the violent and unconstitutional fab of the Grand Vizier and his new War Minister. Again, after the mutiny of the 13th April, 1909, Nazim Pasha incurred the displeasure of the committee by accepting the post of commander of the _ mutinous Constantinople army corps, which he reduced to order, and advocated punishing without the interven tion of the Macedonian forces. Being popular with the rank and file his presence in the capital was irksome to the committee, who apparently resolved to send him to the distant post of Bagdad, with the ulterior object of ruining his reputation and dismissing him as a failure. It is not impossible that Nazim Pasha’s arbitrary methods of improving Bagdad were indirectly suggested to him by some member of the committee with a view to compassing his downfall, and it seems undoubted that they would like to be able to say that his recall was due to the English, to whom Nazim was reputed to be friendly. It is on this account that in our written and verbal complaints about the recent high-handed proceedings at Bagdad this embassy has been careful to omit any mention of his name, and to refer always to “the local authorities” or “the Bagdad il [2988 ee — 1] 9 10 .i n municipality.” XliGrc seems little douht now tliat x^azim Pasha s tenure ot office at Bagdad will not last long. With reference to M_r. Lorimer s suggestion that steps might be taken to defer the conclusion of the Bagdad municipal loan, I do not see how, in view of recent events, the embassy could approach the National Bank with that object. ^ As regards the expropriation of Messrs. Lynchs head offices, I have caused the Minister of the Interior to telegraph to the vali to see that the provisions of the Expropriation Law are not departed from, and informed Mr. Lorimer that, unless the authorities offer a reasonable price, Messrs. Lynch s agent should, if necessary, bring an action within fifteen days, as prescribed. I have further had the Minister of the Interior’s attention drawn to the threatened withdrawal of Messrs. Lynch’s permission to tow barges, and to the fact that the existing accumulation of cargo at Bussorah makes it very inopportune to raise the question at the present moment. In view of the present frame of mind of the Turkish authorities, they would not now be likely to entertain the suggestion in Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 21st October and that of the 10th November, 1910, enclosed in your despatches Nos. 335 and 346 of the 31st October and the 15th November respectively, that they should be allowed to use a fourth steamer to help to work off the congestion at Bussorah. In the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s letter of the 10th November it is stated that Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery has been granted a permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that this gentleman is understood to be in close touch with the agents of the German Hamburg-Amerika line. At first sight it is difficult to see why Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Bagdad should not be in as close if not closer touch with Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery. The communication from the Porte complaining that Messrs. Lynch s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad and Bussorah seemed to contest the right of the original two steamers to carry the British flag. I at once caused energetic representations to be made on the subject, with the result that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs now declares that probably the local authorities confounded the two original steamers wfith the third steamer, for which permission was granted in January 1907, with the proviso that it should fly the Ottoman flag, and that their complaints refer only to alleged “ irregularities ” ot the third steamer. As regards the decision prohibiting the registration of Sheikn Kazal s lands at Failieh, the Porte has hinted that representations on the subject would more properly come from the Persian Embassy here, but has promised to re-examine the matter. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to try and arrange that the sheikh’s agent should move the new vali at Bussorah to again refer the matter to Constantinople for reconsideration. In a telegram of the 14th November, His Majesty s consul at Bussorah reported fromBushire that the ;t Bedbreast ” had visited Wakra and Odeid and found no sign of Turkish mudirs at those places, while, as reported in my telegram No. 248 of the 14th instant, His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire has since reported the desertion of the Turkish post at Zakhnuniyeh. I would venture to suggest, for your consideration, the advisability of sending the “Redbreast” to Zakhnuniyeh to ascertain whether any Turkish gendarmes are still there, and whether, as previously reported, the Turkish flag is still at the bottom of the mast. The visit of a British ship is certain to be reported, and its importance magnified by the local Arabs up to Bussorah and Bagdad, and its effect may counteract to a certain extent the deplorable impression among British subjects at Bagdad caused by the high-handed action of the Turkish local authorities. The fact that this despatch is a report on some of the questions forming the subject of your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October must be my excuse for including in it more than one subject-matter. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G, Lowther, (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 12, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 8th instant and to your Excellency s telegram of the 10th instant, I regret to report that British reputation at Bagdad has fallen to avery low ebb, and I find that British subjects are seriously alarmed, seeing that their rights have never hitherto been so trampled upon here. For four months past they have been suffering from illegal oppression, from which there is no sign of any redress to come visible. A prosperous merchant, Abdul Ali, has talked of renouncing his -^British nationality for Turkish, and several British Indians have actually done so. If I nave so far failed to show your Excellency the serious nature of the situation, it has been only because I was unwilling to appear alarmist. The vali is incompetent, and under the influence of unscrupulous and ignorant underlings, and it is with regret that I am reduced to the conviction that he must be removed and replaced by a more intelligent man. Yesterday they demolished part of the two storied building, No. 6, with circum stances of injury and insult, and have continued doing so to-day. The violence of the local authorities increases daily, and I can only conclude the Minister of the Interior is misleading your Excellency. The vali appears to treat the question as a personal one, and the next thing will be expropriations, which will cause great and as yet unforeseen losses to British subjects if carried out on the same lines as the demolitions. Could your Excellency not obtain compensation in even one case ? It would to some extent allay the panic. Immediate payment to the ice manufacturer, whose case is clear, would effect this purpose. The Bagdad municipality loan should not, I think, be entrusted to the present local Government, or, at any rate, not given till the amount of compensation payable to British subjects for the demolitions and prospective expropriations has been discussed and approved by His Majesty’s Embassy. The loan will certainly be misspent, and the eity will thus be saddled to no purpose with a heavy debt for a generation. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 14, 1910. REFEBRING to my telegram of the 12th November last, I anticipate that I shall soon learn that a block of lofty houses owned by some Indian nawabs, to which I did not refer in my despatch of the 5th September last, will have been expropriated on scandalously unfair conditions. Meanwhile, notice has been sent to Lynch’s manager of the expropriation of 3|- metres from the front of his office and warehouse, the expropriation to take effect in fifteen days, and compensation being fixed at 424 Turkish liras only. The unscrupulous character of the proceedings is shown by the fact that Lynch’s manager estimates the cost of rebuilding on a new alignment would amount to some 1,184 liras, while the estimate made in my despatch of the 5th September came to 1,250 liras. The total claim made by Lynch amounts to 2,396 liras, i.e., for buildings which will now be expropriated 1,828 liras, for wall and shops wrongfully demolished 568 liras, though there is perhaps room for discussion regarding the items of the cost of recon struction. I fear that a grave blow would be struck at British prestige, from which it will not easily recover, if Lynch’s olfice and warehouse are destroyed and no proper compensation first fixed. It is absolutely necessary that the vilayet’s proceedings should be checked, and the view is gaining ground here that the British Government cannot protect its subjects in Turkey.fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARAB IA.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 860 of the 27th September, 1910, I have the honour to submit a copy of a report given me by Mr. Parry, the local representative of Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co., in connection with the progress—if it can be called progress—of negotiations between himself and the vilayet with regard to the recent demolition, in the name of the Bagdad municipality, of certain buildings at Bagdad belonging to his firm. The papers enclosed do not appear to call for any comment upon my part. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Notes for Mr. Lorimer regarding Negotiations with the Local Government in connection with the demolition of Walls and Shops on our Premises and the Ground required for Load widening purposes. ON the 25th ultimo 1 met Djaved Bey and Eram Bey at my office with the object of endeavouring to come to some amicable settlement of the difficulties. 2. I informed them that I was acting as agents of the proprietors of the property, and any negotiations must be considered unofficial, but that 1 was willing to submit any reasonable proposal to London. 3. A plan was produced by Djaved Bey showing the section of the mam road from the bazaar to a point 200 yards south of the south wall of the offices, in which the houses are shown on each side of the road with a red line cutting off 4 nieties on each side, representing the widened road 11‘40 metres wide. ’ 4 . I was told that the frontage of the houses immediately in front of our premises would be pulled down immediately after the Bairam holiday (say, 6 th instant). 5 j n answer to my inquiry, 1 was told that permission would be given to us to build on the property along the line where the shops and wall have been demolished only if we accepted a line 4 metres within the line of the demolished walls. ' g_ On pointing out that, if we built a wall along that line on one portion of the property, the main building (offices) would jut out into the widened road 4 metres, I was told’ that they would take the main building at some later date; and the law, which does not permit the reconstruction or repair to frontages on the road required for widening purposes without putting the wall back, would be put m foice. 7. After much discussion, in which the desirability of a large firm like Lynch assisting the local government in carrying out improvements in the town and the advantages which would accrue if we set the example to the natives by giving our property without compensation was emphasised, I requested them to make me an [2988 o-2] &gt; c' •[ \c&gt; :y* ? offer which I could submit to my principals. An offer was made to the effect that, as a concession to us, they would take only 3 instead of 4 metres from our property. This offer being absurd, I told the meeting that I could not send it to London, but, after persuasion, I consented to submit the offer, and telegraphed to London on the 28th ultimo. On the 30th ultimo I received a telegraphic reply, which read asj follows :— “ Proposition pas raisonnable. Impossible accepter sans dedommagement equitable. —Lynch.” 8 . With the telegram referred to above I received a separate telegram, intimating that acceptance of any settlement must be based on conpensation being paid for rebuilding premises and value of site in full. 9. It is my intention to show the first telegram to his Excellency the vali as soon as I can obtain an interview. B. W. PARRY. October 1, 1910.

Consul-Genera 1 Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 888/52.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, October 7, 1910. 1 HAVE the honour to enclose, at present for your information only, copies of correspondence relating to municipal demolitions at Karbala. It will be more convenient, for various reasons, to keep the question of these separate from that of municipal demolitions at Bagdad and Kadhimain. Copies of the Karbala vice-consul’s letters to me are not sent, as they are prolix and voluminous; but his report of the 7 th October sums up the present situation. M. Eram Bey has vouchsafed no reply to the letter which I sent him on the 5th September. I am in hopes that the cases which have as yet arisen at Karbala may be susceptible of local arrangement, as the amount of the loss inflicted on British subjects seems likely to be small ; but in only one instance has it yet been possible to form a precise estimate of the loss, the intentions of the municipality in the remainder being still undeclared. Moreover, I understand that the opening of new streets at Karbala is contemplated, which may involve the destruction of houses of high value belonging to British subjects. So far there has not been at Karbala any interference except with shops, &amp;c., of comparatively trifling value. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, I. C. S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to British Vice-Consul, Karbala. (Confidential.) Dear Muhammad Hasan, Bagdad, August 5, 1910. PLEASE take steps to have separate valuations made at once of shops and houses belonging to British subjects at Karbala, which may be in danger of demolition in connection with municipal improvements. You should, if necessary, bring the requirements of the Turkish law to the notice of the mutessarif, and insist upon their being observed. The most important of these are— 1 . That what is intended to be done must first be announced and explained to the owners by means of a plan; 2 . That a period must be allowed them for lodging objections after notice has been given ; 3. That the land required for widening a street must be taken on both sides of the same equally, and not on one side only ; [2988 o—l] B COi' ! I C i i - 1' ^ J2S fcf/o4. That, if one-fourth or less of the depth of the property is taken, the muni cipality must rebuild the front wall at its own expense, or pay the owner in order that he may do so ; 5. That, if more than one-fourth of depth is taken, full compensation must he paid ; 6. That the property must not he taken until the compensation due has beenf) paid. The laws in question are that of the 21st Jamadi-ul-Awwal, 1296 a.h., and that of 18th Muharram, 1309 a.h. If the municipal or other authorities violate these laws in any way they will be liable to suits for damages. Please report to me on the subject without delay. There is so much of this kind of work going on at Bagdad at present, besides interference with trade, that I see no chance of getting away to Karbala; also I have not yet received the orders of the (Government of India about the Oudh Bequest. J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorinier to British V ice-Gonsul, Karbala. Dear Muhammad Hasan, Bagdad, August 11, 1910. I HAVE received your letter of the 9 th August about demolition and expropria tion of immovable property belonging to British subjects at Karbala. You have taken the right line in arguing _ with the mutessarif by saying that, in cases of immovable property, even if the Turkish law is violated to the disadvantage of our subjects, we are entitled to intervene officially. I am maintaining the same principle here in my discussions with the vilayet, and shall continue to do so ; and you should do likewise. Of course, if the Turks use force, we can do nothing except report the matter to the embassy at Constantinople ; so, if the law is violated at Karbala, you must lose no time in informing me of the facts by special letter. You should at once make a valuation of Ali Hashim s shop, if you have not already done so, for future use. I would advise you to go and look at it yourself. I did this myself at Bagdad in the case of Messrs. Lynch’s and Abdul Ali’s premises, and I am told that the fact of my having gone to the spot made the lurkish authorities hesitate. They have now knocked down a wall belonging to Messrs. Lynch, but Abdul Ali’s shop still stands. You should support your valuation by calculations, examples of transactions in the neighbourhood, and deposition of the owner, &amp;c. I think vou will know how to be polite and firm at the same time. J J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Consul-General Lonmer to British Vice-Consul, Karbala. Bagdad, September 5, 1910. (Confidential.) Dear Muhammad Hasan, I HAVE received your letter of the 29th August. In the case of British subjects whose immovable property is threatened you must continue, as a rule, to insist on the strict observance by the Turkish authorities of the Turkish laws, viz., the expropriation law of the 21st Jamadi-ul-Awwal, a.h. 1296, and the building law of the 18th Muharram, a.h. 1309. If, in any particular instance, a British subject wishes to waive his legal rights and to forego consular protection, you must obtain from him a declaration in proper form, signed and sealed by him, to this effect. We are having great trouble over this very question at Bagdad, and a wall and six small shops belonging to Messrs. Lynch have been unlawfully destroyed; but the question has gone up to Constantinople, and I do not think that any more illegal demolitions will take place here. You will remember that, even when the portion of the property taken is less thanone-fourth, the municipality is bound to pay the cost of rebuilding the front and interior. I shall write to the vilayet unofficially and try and get them to restrain the mutessarif from illegal action against the property of British subjects at Karbala. 4 J. G. LOB1MEK. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to M. Eram Bey. (Private.) Dear M. Eram Bey, Bagdad, September 5, 1910. YOU spoke to me the other day about a disagreement between the mutessarif of Karbala and the British vice-consul there, and I was able to inform you that the cause was threatened interference by the municipality with some houses and shops of British Indian subjects. . i xr u i I have now received a long report on the subject from the vice-consul at Karbala, but perhaps, if his Excellency would remind the mutessarif of the necessity of observing the Turkish law strictly, this would stop the trouble in the beginning. I refer particu larly to the Expropriation Law of the 15th May, 1879, and the Building Law of the 22 nd August, 1891. The most important provisions of these are :— 1 . That more than one-quarter of a property cannot be taken until after compen sation has been legally fixed and paid ; and 2 . That, where the part taken is one-quarter or less, the facade and interior must be reconstructed at the expense of the expropriating authority. I venture to make this suggestion in the interest of smooth relations between the vilayet and this consulate-general, and to prevent the extension to Karbala, if it is not already too late, of the trouble which has arisen at Bagdad over shops and houses. J J, G. LORIMEB. Enclosure (3 in No. 1. Report by the British Vice-Consul, Karbala. ABOUT three months ago, under the orders of the vali, the mutessarif of Karbala undertook the renovation of the town of Karbala, As there was no money to meet the necessary expenses, in the way of compensation to the proprietors, wages of labourers, &amp;c., no regard whatsover was paid to law and justice. The local authorities and the municipality were obliged to carry out the improvements at the expense of the people ; and consequently, civil rights were infringed. Not only this, but by threats and under hand proceedings they forced the people into submission. To start with, no regular notice was given to the owners or the shopkeepers to vacate the shops. The crier of the municipality informed the shopkeepers of the demolition of the bazaar during the day, and on the night following the roofing o t le bazaar was demolished. Next morning the people were obliged to remove then- property from their shops. The next step of the authorities m this direction was to order the people to demolish their shops, &amp;c., and to rebuild them at their own ^ As there were British subjects who were proprietors, I, seeing these arbitrary and high-handed proceedings, in order to safeguard their interests, held several discussions with the mutessarif, and insisted on the strict observance of the lurkish law regulat ing property. The mutessarif on each occasion invariably promised to act according to the law ; but, when it came to practice, he did not keep his promises. . To illustrate the oppression practised by the authorities, it would be sumcient to state that, notwithstanding the offer of help I made to British subjects m connection with their property, the majority demolished and rebuilt them at their own expense without a murmur. From this the condition of the Arab and Persian proprietors can very well be judged. [2988 o—l] B 2gUMUff Among the British subjects, however, who stood up for their rights are the following :— (a.) Haji Mirza Ahmad (Akhbari); ( 6 .) Seyyid Muhammad (Kashmiri) ; and (c.) Haji Zain-ul-’Abidin (Akhbari). 1. A shop situated in the Hazrat Abbas bazaar, half of which belongs to the Akhbari, who is a British subject, and the rest to two Turkish subjects, came under expropriation ; but the amount taken from it exceeded one quarter of the whole by - 1 ^ ) - of a metre. The Akhbari’s share in this excess w T as t 1 -^, for which the Government promised to pay him afterwards. The shop was, however, rebuilt by the partner; but since then the Akhbari’s efforts to realise the value, which is nearly 4 lirahs, have proved fruitless, and there are no signs of the authorities paying the money. 2. In the same bazaar the road on both sides was so curved at one end that the Government, with a view to straightening it, had to cut more off the shops on the one side and to give a small portion of the bazaar to the shops on the other. According to law the disposable portion ought to have been sold formally by public auction, and the proceeds given to the owners on the side who lost more of their property than was specified by law. The head of the municipality took a different step from this ; he gave the piece in front of each shop to that shop without public sale or formal proceedings.. At night (so it is said) he went round and squeezed as much money from the owners as he could, so secretly that none besides him and the payers knew it. Close to the shops in question is situated a large “ kaizarieh ” or private bazaar, belonging to the Akhbari, the owner of a half shop mentioned above. The door of this place, including the mafeonry on each side of it, measures 9 ft. 3 in. across. The spare ground in front of the door is therefore of that length, and it is 2 ft. 2 in. broad. The municipality wants to sell it to the Akhbari, and threatening messages have been sent him, requiring iiim to meet the wishes of the municipality, otherwise it will block up the door of the “ kaizarieh ” leaving him only a side entrance six-tenths of a metre wide. This is rather cruel dealing, when others have been dealt with so generously and against the law, that the Akhbari should be pressed to pay a high price which has not been fixed by auction or impartial experts. A Persian shop in front of the “ kaizarieh ” is going to lose the major portion of it, and it is desired to compensate the owner out of this little front piece, and therefore people are being put up to offer exorbitant prices for it. The last pressure they brought upon the Akhbari was to satisfy the owner of the front shop and take possession of the space. On the night of the 28th September a foundation to build a shop upon was begun at the foot of the “ kaizari^h,” and, if this really goes up, the “ kaizarieh ” will lose half its splendour. A petition which was recently given to the acting mutessarif in this connection was torn up by him with fury. I have been told that the late mutessarif specially asked the kadhi and the president of the municipality to deal rather roughly with the Indians. 3. Another British subject named Seyyid Muhammad has two shops, situated contiguous to each other on two sides of a corner of a wall, and each facing a different quarter of the bazaar. The large one has given to the road more than a quarter, and the small one is now in danger of losing about three-fourths without compensation. The authorities claim that both the shops are one ; but in saying so they forget that, whether they are one or two, the total they want from them exceeds one-fourth of the whole. Seyyid Muhammad’s Sharkah deed, attested and registered by a late kadhi, speaks of the place as “ a shop and the e kanarah ’ (butcher’s shop) behind it.” A wall now demolished stood between the two and separated them from each other. Each was let separately ; the small one fetched 3 lirahs per mensem, and its value is between 50 and 70 lirahs. I cannot now say how much will be taken from it, as experience has shown that the municipality’s plans change every minute according to its wishes. The case is still pending, and, unless immediate orders are sent to prevent them, the municipality will take action. 4. The case of a shop belonging to Haji Zain-ul-’Abidin (Akhbari) and situated in the Persian draper’s bazaar is still pending. The shop was demolished by the municipality, and for several days it was left in a ruined state, to be rebuilt by the owner. When I insisted on its being made up by the municipality, and the mutessarif ordered the same, the president of the municipality induced a neighbour of the shop to claim that the whole of the wall between them belonged to him. Outsiders also supported the claim of the Akhbari. The dispute, however, went on between them for two days, and on the third evening Zain-ul-’Abidin, in the presence of the mutessarif.the president of the municipality, and others, pressed for digging up of the foundations, by which means the facts could be ascertained. This was a good and professional idea, but the mutessarif refused, and ordered that each of the parties should appoint an architect, who would decide upon the case and whose decision should be followed. ■# This was agreed upon, but on the same night the president of the municipality ordered the^ neighbour—one Haji Husain, a Persian—to build up the wall and take possession of it.^ In the morning Zain-ul-’Abidin complained to the mutessarif, who, instead of questioning the president of the municipality or restoring the wall to him, sent him to the municipality. Thence he was sent back to the mutessarif, and this was repeatedly done until he got tired and applied to me. When I sent him with my dragoman, the mutessarif referred him to the Shara’ court, where the result after a week’s running about, was no better than before. A friend of the Akhbari, however, learned from the kadhi that the latter had been ordered to treat the matter in a dilatory fashion. This was the first and only shop that was rebuilt by the municipality, and, owing to this it lost a wall, besides which some 6 bashlik’s worth of wood which was stolen from it. It is still incomplete and unfit for letting, because the upper walls and the roofing of, the bazaar—which last, by the municipality’s order, is to be of iron—have not been put up. It has reached the level of the top of the doorway. October 7, 1910. M. H. MOHSIN.— I ^^7 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Goyemment.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND CONFIDENTIAL.

I HAVE the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch No. 850 of the 21st September, that the demolition of Seyyid Ali Khan’s arch and upper storey at Kadhinain has been commenced, and will no doubt be completed. # The vali’s political secretary called on me to-day and conversed with me on the subject, and I understood him to say that the policy of condemning buildings as dangerous and demoJishing them without compensation instead of expropriating the owners had been deliberately adopted by the vilayet as the most inexpensive method of carrying out necessary municipal improvements. He stated, so far as I could follow him, that £ T. 20,000 had already been saved by resorting to this expedient in the case of buildings owned by Turkish subjects, and he said that the object of the vilayet in negotiating with Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co., as they are now doing, with reference to a law-suit threatened by that firm was to avoid, if possible, the establish ment of a precedent which might encourage Turkish subjects to claim compensation under the expropriation laws. I understand, however, that Messrs. Lynch are most unlikely to agree to any settlement which does not include pecuniary compensation. I told the political secretary that in any case in which the owner, being a British subject, was willing to settle direct with the vilayet I should have no objection at all, but that, where he was not willing, and sought my assistance, I could not but support his just claims. It will, I think, be admitted that it is impossible to allow British subjects to be robbed of their property by artifice merely in order to facilitate the spoliation of Ottoman subjects by their own Government. From M. Eram Bey’s remarks on this occasion I can only conclude that, sooner or later, it will be necessary to decide, in all the cases mentioned in my despatch No. 776 of the 5th September, 1910, how the claims to compensation of the British subjects affected are to be enforced. There is not the slightest use in my continuing to press the matter here, and I therefore solicit the favour of your Excellency’s taking- such action at Constantinople as may seem to your Excellenc}^ to be proper and sufficient. I may add that the question of a new main street and three cross streets in Bagdad town, which has been mentioned more than once in my monthly summaries of events, is expected to enter on the practical stage shortly after the conclusion of the Ramadhan. The municipal engineer (M. Chavanis, a French subject) informs me that the main street, 20 metres wide, will be made by cutting through the solid town for a distance of 3 kilom., and that 480 houses, none of them fortunately belonging to British subjects, will be destroyed in whole or in part. From another source I learn that the alignment of this projected street has been altered lately so as to carry it through the poorer quarters, where the proprietors are less able to offer opposition. If the money-saving principle indicated by M. Eram Bey is adopted in the case of this [2988 g —5]2 * i If !}&lt; N ^ n street to any great extent, I anticipate that, notwithstanding the poverty of the owners, the vilavet may encounter some difficulties. v+* i I would beg your Excellency to regard my conversations with the political secretary and the municipal engineer as confidential. 1 have, &amp;c.

HIS Britannic Majesty’s Embassy has the honour to draw the attention of the Sublime Porte to the following case, which has already formed the subject of conversations between His Majesty’s Ambassador and his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs. About the middle of July last an order was issued by the municipal authorities of Bagdad decreeing that ice was to be sold at a rate not exceeding 10 paras per kilogramme. Considering that previous to this date ice had fetched as much as 40 paras, and in summer even 50 and 60 paras per kilogramme, the price fixed by this new order was entirely arbitrary, and, moreover, it does not appear that ice comes under the category of necessary articles of food for which the municipality has any right to fix a price under the Law of Provincial Municipalities. As the Sublime Porte are no doubt aware, there are at Bagdad two ice factories owned by the British Indian subjects, Messrs. Abdul Ali. The Bagdad authorities proceeded to try and force these merchants to sell their ice at the price now fixed. Failing in this attempt they approached His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad to co-operate with them in forcing Messrs. Abdul Ali to close their factories altogether as contravening the terms of the law of 1864, which is, however, concerned with steam- engines and boilers only, whereas the ice factories in question are run by smokeless and non-dangerous oil-engines. His Majesty’s consul-general was compelled to protest against any such action, based on a complete misinterpretation of the law, and referred the authorities to Constantinople, where, it is understood, orders have been issued for the suspension of proceedings against Abdul Ali pending further consideration of the case. In the meanwhile, the losses suffered by the owners of the factories have been considerable. Calculated at the lowest estimate (i.e., 20 paras per kilogramme) at which they could have sold their ice during the summer months, the losses sustained by Messrs. Abdul Ali as a result of the interference with their trade from the 22nd July to the 14th August, during which period they were compelled to sell 98,781 kilog. at 10 paras each, amount to a sum of £ T. 228, which sum does not of course cover any subsequent losses that may be incurred. His Majesty’s Embassy is convinced that the Sublime Porte will admit the injustice of the proceedings of the local authorities at Bagdad, and it has the honour to request that instructions will be sent to the Bagdad vilayet to desist from all further attempts to close the ice factories in question and to indemnify Messrs. Abdul Ali for the losses sustained by them owing to the arbitrary and illegal action of the authorities. Pera, October 19, 1910.

I am to state that, as has already , been pointed out verbally to one of your directors, His Majesty’s Ambassador at !

In reply we would venture to express our great surprise at the nature of this communication. In the course of recent personal interviews at the Foreign Office we were clearly given to understand that it had been decided that His Majesty’s Embassy in Constantinople should hold the central Government responsible for losses incurred by British subjects in Bagdad owing to the arbitrary action of the vali and the local authorities, and that His Majesty’s consul- general in Bagdad would shortly receive instructions to make a valuation of all properties affected, and to submit this valuation to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople. We accordingly telegraphed this information to our agents at Bagdad, instructing them to give the consul-general every assistance in making the valuation, and to associate themselves with his action. We earnestly trust that no departure may be made by His Majesty’s Government from this course of procedure, upon which we have already taken action. It is only by holding the central Government responsible and obtaining settlement in Constantinople of the matter at issue that there is any likelihood of getting justice done. In reply to the last paragraph of your letter, v r e have not contemplated bringing an action for damages against the Turkish authorities. To place this matter before the local courts at Bagdad would be to invite disaster. The state of affairs at Bagdad at the present time is such that it is improbable that any lawyer could be found to oppose the projects of the vali. It is certain that justice would not be done to us were we to follow such a course. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [October 29.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [39388] No. 1. Messrs.

I TOOK another opportunity to-day of urging upon Rifaat Pasha the necessity of settling without further delay some of the cases of obvious illegality of which British subjects had recently been victims, and which I had over and over again brought to his notice. These, and questions in the Persian Gulf which were clear attempts to infringe the status quo, had cumulatively produced a very bad impression, not only on the British public, but on His Majesty’s Government, and his Excellency’s promises of a settlement of them were very tardy in their realisation. Rifaat Pasha declared that all the matters that I had brought to his notice were being dealt with, and in most of them satisfaction had been given. There seemed, his Excellency said, to have arisen an idea in our minds that Great Britain and her subjects had been specially singled out for the irregularities of the nature complained of. This was far from being the case, and he hoped I would be convinced that it was the earnest desire of the Ottoman Government to remain on the best of terms with His Majesty’s Government. If foreigners had suffered, they had suffered equally. This must be accounted for by the fact that internal matters had too fully occupied the attention of the Government, that the country was passing in many respects through an experimental stage since the new regime, and that, from the point of view of experience and discipline, the officials who had been recently appointed in the provinces had not in all cases proved to be a success. His Excellency went on to say that it was with great regret that they saw that the “ Times ” had recently adopted a less sympathetic attitude than formerly towards “ Young Turkey. ” The views of the “ Times ” correspondent at Athens were invariably adopted, and the point of view of Turkey in the Greek question was ignored. Further, in the recent matter of the loan the “ Times ” had declared that the conditions imposed by France were fair and acceptable, whereas it was clear that the foreign control which they implied could never be accepted by any Government here, and public opinion in England seemed now to resent the fact that Turkey had applied to Germany for a loan, wdiere no alternative was open to her. I said that this embassy had felt very acutely the difficulty in the settlement of cases concerning their subjects where they were obviously in the right, as we^ were even more careful than others to investigate very thoroughly every case before it was represented to the Sublime Porte, and were always ready to help m finding a sdution that would be agreeable to both parties, while not insisting in too uncoinpiomismg a manner on our strict rights. This his Excellency admitted to be the case. 1 then referred again to the cases of illegal demolition of British property at Bagdad, which I said demanded a prompt settlement. His Excellency replied that he had quite recently again seht instructions to Bagdad to the vah to be careful m dealing with British subjects and interests, and to endeavour to settle the matter I am confidentially informed that Tewfik Pasha, Ottoman Ambassador in London, has recently telegraphed reporting that the failure to conclude the loan with the French has produced an unfavourable echo in England, and urging, if possible, seeking an opportunity of reopening negotiations with Paris. Tewfik also urges prudence anc. moderation in handling the Persian question, and the necessity of not irritating France and England at the present juncture. The pasha is further reported to have especially counselled putting an end to the attacks and threats against England made by the Young Egyptians and extremists, who demand the evacuation of Egypt, and giving special instructions in this sense to the Ottoman commissioner m gyPj; The not very satisfactory internal situation and the threatened Ministerial ciisis reported in my despatch No. 800 of to-day, taken together with the rupture of he loan negotiations with the French, have not increased the prestige or internal popularity of [2988 g —3] \2 the Young Turks, who are, for the moment, suffering from the sense of partial failure, a state of mind which may explain to a certain extent the reason for and the nature of Rifaat Pasha’s above-quoted statements. The Young Turks are not wont to admit their shortcomings, and invariably look round for scapegoats. At present they are inclined to attribute the wane of their influence in the countries of the Triple Entente, not to the bad impression produced by their policy and acts of last year, but to the incompetence of their representatives in London, Paris, and St. Petersburgh, and there are evident signs of their intention to replace them by younger and more “ energetic ” men. It seems highly problematical whether by such changes they will enhance Turkey’s prestige abroad. I have, &amp;c.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 6 th September, 1910, I have the honour to enclose papers relating to a case in which it is proposed wrongfully to demolish some immovable property owned by Seyyid Ali Khan, a British Indian subject, at Kazimain. Except that in this case some superficial repairs appear to be required, the circumstances are exactly similar to those of the wall and shops belonging to Messrs. Lynch Brothers at Bagdad, which have already been unjustifiably destroyed. In both these cases, as also in that of Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop at Bagdad, it is worth remarking that the alternative of repairing their properties was not ofiered to the owners; and this, although, in Messrs. Lynch’s and Mr. Thaddeus’s cases, the buildings were in so good a state as not even to need repairs. The explanation, of course, is that their removal is desired not in the interests of the public safety, but for an ulterior purpose. In the case of the building at Kazimain, I am not yet aware what that purpose is. The vilayet having rejected my intervention, as the enclosed correspondence shows, I had the honour of telegraphing to your Excellency yesterday about Seyyid Ali Khan’s case. I then suggested that your Excellency, to avert an act of grave injustice to a British subject, might be able to arrange for an order to repair being substituted for the order to demolish, or at least for obtaining a respite of execution until this present despatch should have reached your Excellency. I may add that before addressing the vilayet I carefully examined the Turkish law on the subject of overhead buildings, and that I failed to find there any provision which could legalise the removal of Seyyid Ali Khan’s arch and upper storey. This point (viz., of the building being an overhead one) may, however, be subsequently raised by the vilayet. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Order by the Resident to Mr. Abdur Robb. PLEASE accompany Seyyid Ali Khan to Kazimain and see his property which is threatened with demolition. I should like to have an exact description of it, particularly the height of the bridge above the level of the street, and whether it is in good condition. You should go with Seyyid Ali Khan to the- municipal offices and enquire under [2930 hh —1] “ B /f ftjfc?2 what law and article it is proposed to take action. Is it the law of the ISth^Muharram, 1309 ? If so, unless the bridge is in bad condition, the destruction of it does not appear to be regular. You might also remark on no written notice having been given to the proprietor. You should ask the municipality to delay action until the matter has been properl) discussed and settled. If they do not agree to this, I shall have to refer to the vali, and you may tell them so. J J. G. LORIMER September 6 , 1910. Enclosure 3 in No. 1 . Heport of Mr. Abdur Robb. I EXAMINED the bridge belonging to Seyyid Ali Khans house at Kazimain yesterday. This bridge is built north-south and has three rooms on it, which form the &lt;c diwankhama ” of the house. The length of the bridge (“ tak ”) is about 23 feet, and the width at the foundation about feet and at the top 7J feet. Height at the northern entrance is 7f feet, in the middle 6J feet, and at the southern entrance 6 feet only. The difference of height at three different points is due to the unevenness of the street. The “ tak ” (bridge) is in thorough good condition, except in one place where three or four bricks seem to slightly tremble when touched, rather tapped, with a stick, and this is due to the removal of the cement. In two other places, too, 3 or 4 inches of cement plaster has fallen off, but the bricks are in perfect order and not in the least shaky. The three or four bricks mentioned above will become firm by the application of a very small quantity of cement or the mortar which they generally use. With this exception the “ tak ” is otherwise quite safe. After the examination of the “ tak ” I went to the municipality. I opened the subject with the president. At the very outset he showed me a letter, dated the 14th Aghastoos, from the vali, in which he says that the chief engineer of the vilayet, who had been sent on purpose to examine the Kazimain town, recommends the demolition of the following (here names the places), and therefore these may he demolished as soon as possible. The “ tak ” of Seyyid Ali Khan was included in the list. The president said he is ready to oblige me in everything, but as it was the order of the vali he was powerless. However, he would delay the demolition for a week. Upon this I told him that the verbal notice is nothing and the regular thing was to have given a written notice to the owner. The president replied that he knew nothing of the law. The vali’s order was a sufficient authority for him. But as I and Seyyid Ali Khan were his friends he would do anything to please us. “ Only come with me/ he said, “ to the kaimakam and we shall settle the matter there.” We went to the ka'imakam. The subject was opened by me. I talked to him as I had done to the president, in the light of your note. He also informed me that it was the order of the vali, based on the report of the chief engineer, and that he would delay the demolition for a week or ten days till the matter is discussed. But if I talked of law and legality of things, I should refer to the vilayet, and not to him, because he was not authorised to have direct dealings with foreign consulates. As he seemed a little flushed, I turned the matter into a joke, threw down on the table the vali’s letter I had in my hand, and said, here goes the law ! Will you not delay taking action till the matter is settled ? The kaimakam was all smiles in a moment ; he laughed, and promised to wait a week or two. Upon this we took leave and came away. For information. ABDUR RABB. September 7, 1910. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Report by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant, on a Verbal Order from the Resident. I HAVE seen the arch of Seyyid Ali Khan’s house at Kazimain. The dimensions given in the above note, as regards height and breadth of the arch, appear to be correct.The arch and supporting walls are built of bricks and juss, but, owing to neglect, the pointing oi the walls has worn away, and the juss between the bricks of the walls has conoded to a depth of an inch or more, giving the walls an appearance of unusual » decay, the arch itself is perfect, having no crack indicating a subsidence or movement n the supporting walls. In my opinion the walls and arch are perfectly safe for another five or six years, even if no attention is paid to them, but if generally done up and repointed they will last for many years yet. The road thereabouts is merely a lane, and not a thoroughfare, through which a general traffic passes. Judging from its locality, I should think that seldom any loaded animals or horsemen, excepting donkeys carrying w T ater-skins pass under the arch. J. C. GASKIN. September 9, 1910. Enclosure 5 in No. 1 . Consul-General Lorimer to M. A. Eram Bey. Dear M. Eram Bey, Bagdad, September 6 , 1910. SEYYID ALI KHAN, one of the principal British Indian subjects at Bagdad, has been verbally informed by the Kazimain municipality that three rooms of his, which are built over a street there, are in a dangerous condition, and must be removed. As he represented that they were not dangerous, I sent first a native employe of this consulate-general, and then Mr. Gaskin, to see them, and both officers report that they are not dangerous. Would you kindly look into this question without delay, in order that the municipality may not take hasty and, perhaps, illegal action, as, according to our view, the Bagdad municipality did in the case of Messrs. Lynch. It would be very unfortunate if a fresh case had to be referred to Constantinople. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LOBIMEB. [No reply to this letter w^as received.] Enclosure 6 in No. 1 . Consul-General Lorimer to the Vali of Bagdad. Your Excellency, Bagdad, September 15, 1910. I HAVE the honour to inform you that, according to information which I have received, an arch and upper storey belonging to Seyyid Ali Khan, a British Indian subject, have been condemned as insecure and ordered to be destroyed. I have caused the building to be examined by two representatives of this consulate-general separately. Both of these have given it as their opinion that it is in no way insecure. Will your Excellency in these circumstances consider the propriety of causing this order of the Kazimain municipality to be cancelled, or at least direct the municipality to allow the owner an opportunity of doing the replastering and other superficial repairs which are possibly required. In case the municipality persist in their intention it is possible that a claim for damages may arise. Your Excellency is probably aware that demolitions of house property are in progress at Kerbala, and that the properties of British Indian subjects are in some cases likely to be affected. I have the honour to request that your Excellency will kindly take steps to ensure that the Turkish laws of buildings and expropriation are observed by the Kerbala municipality, as I am informed that there appears to be a tendency on the part of that body to disregard them.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 24.) (No. 751.) Sir, Constantinople, October 18, 1910. IN my despatch No. 725 of the 12 th instant, I had the honour to forward to you a detailed report from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad regarding the attempts of the local authorities to close two ice factories there belonging to a British Indian subject, Abdul Ali. In that despatch Mr. Lorimer gave such a full and clear account of the incident that it is unnecessary for me to give any further explanation, but it still remains for me to inform you of the steps I have taken here to check the vali’s arbitrary action in the matter. ' I y f , ;; &gt; * On receiving the first intimation from Mr. Lorimer on the 26th August last that the vali was threatening to enforce the closure of Abdul All’s two factories, after failing to prevail upon him to reduce the price of the ice, I caused representations to be made at the Sublime Porte, and received a promise from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would telegraph to the Vali of Bagdad for an explanation of the threatened interference. On the 28th August I received a further telegram from Mr. Lorimer, informing me that the vali adhered to his intention of closing the factories, no longer on the ground that they had been established without permission, but that their establishment was not authorised by the law of 1864. The latter contention, as will be seen from the enclosed memorandum from Mr. Weakley, is entirely unfounded, and the Turkish text of the law bears it out even less than the French. _ I again made urgent written and verbal representations at the Porte, and as a consequence instructions were sent to the vali to suspend the closing o t e factories, and to report the matter to Constantinople for discussion of the question lere. These latter instructions appear to have had some effect, for the \ali too no further steps in the matter, and Mr. Lorimer, telegraphing on the 9th instant, m reply to an enquiry on my part, stated that he had had no further trouble regarding the ice factories In the meanwhile, however, the owner of the ice factories had suffered considerable losses to his trade owing to the vali’s arbitrary action and the question remains as to how this claim for these losses can best be pressed. Under the new regime the proper course would, of course, be for him to sue the municipality fo$ damages, ^ ut m the present case Nazim Pasha and the municipality have identic interests m ruining the business of the ice factories and so acquiring a monopoly. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that Abdul Ali should not have much confidence m the impartiality ^Moreover, as Mr. Lorimer has with the vali taken the line that Yhe question is one of difference in interpretation of the law of 1864 and shouid be settled here ^ of opinion that the best course will be to send m a note verb ale to the Sublime Fort claiming compensation on behalf of Abdul Ali for the losses inflicted up to the present, and forlny eventual losses which he may suffer from any further arbitrary act.on on the the that I have to encounter here/h this case as in the question of the demohtion of property (see my despatch No. 718 of the 10th October and previous correspondence) from which it seems likely that Abdul All’s premises may also suffer corresponaence;, non evidently hesitate to attempt to force the local authorities^o^bide 1 by^the laws, and shelter themselves behind the fiction that Turkey autnonues TO auiue uy ’ , &gt;&gt; with onlv the same legal remedies that exist has become a ‘ Written application to the Minister for Foreign AffZ rTqueS h mToCtruft the Bagdad loTal authorities to indemnify Abdul Ah his losses.

Memorandum by Air. Weakley [Letter from Vali of Bagdad to His Majesty’s Consul-General, Bagdad, dated August 15 (28), 1910, re Abdul All’s Ice Factories.] IN this as well as the second letter of the 31st August, Nazim Pasha bases his decision for closing Abdul All’s ice factories on the ground that Abdul Ali has not complied with the stipulations of the regulations concerning “ Usines et Machines a Yapeur ” of the 15th May, 1864, from which Nazim Pasha giyes extracts in support of his decision. The main points of his contention are, that Abdul Ali has obtained no authorisation to erect and work factories, that the regulations invoked stipulate the necessity of obtaining such authorisation, and therefore these factories must be closed. The French text of the regulations from which Nazim Pasha draws his quotations is found in Young’s “Corps de Droit ottoman,” vol. 2 , p. 310, and is Aristarchi’s translation, which, when compared with the official Turkish text, is certainly defective and most misleading. The title of the regulations is not “Usines et Machines a Vapeur,” but “Law concerning Stationary Steam Engines,” and, curiously, does not deal with engines at all, but simply defines the conditions under which the boilers, called in the Turkish text steam generators, will be permitted to be used. The law is divided into four chapters or sections :— 1 . Conditions for the erection of steam generators. 2 . Concerning safety valves to be used with steam generators. 3. Concerning the use of smoke-consuming apparatus in chimneys. Article 12 in this chapter (quoted by Nazim Pasha) states that in future persons who intend using steam generators, that is, stationary engine boilers, or those persons who already have erected boilers without authorisation must apply for such authorisation from the Ministry of Public Works. In their request for permits, they must state :— 1 . The highest working pressure of the steam generator. 2 . The shape of such steam generator and boiler tubes, if there be any. 3. The locality where it is to be erected. 4. The kind of fuel which is to be used. 5. The nature of the work the boiler is to be used for. 6 . A plan of*the factory and its immediate neighbourhood, drawn up on a scale of 1 in 200 . Article 13 states that permits granted for using steam generators will be issued subject to the payment of 10 gold medjidffi pieces for each steam generator. Chapter 4 defines the penalties to which persons will be liable in case of non- observance of the stipulations of the law. It is perfectly clear that this law has no reference to the conditions for the establishment of factories nor does it regulate the use of engines, but simply has in view the control of stationary steam boilers in order to ensure their safe working. By no manner of means can Nazim Pasha invoke any of the clauses of this law in justification of his action in threatening to close Abdul Ali’s factories. Oil engines cannot come under this law either, as no boilers are used; there are many of them at present in use all over the country, and no authorisation has ever been considered necessary, nor has anything like a permit been insisted upon.

I spoke generally in the sense of your telegram No. 304 of the 6 th instant. Ttifaat Pasha ^ said that the sufferers should bring actions against the municipality. I said that it was impossible that, under present circumstance, justice would be obtained in an action brought by a foreigner against the municipality, which to all intents and purposes was identical with the vilayet authorities. Moreover, as the buildings had been demolished on the ground that they were unsafe, it would be quite impossible for a court of law to establish at the present time whether or not the plea of insecurity were proved. I told Itifaat Pasha that the estimated damage up to the present time amounted to over 4,000Z., but I had not mentioned any sum in my note as the demolitions were continuing and as the projected street extended over 3 kilom., the total amount promised to be considerable.

IN its pro-memOrid, in Turkish, of the 15th, and in its note verbale No. 81 of the 16th August, His Majesty’s Embassy had the honour of addressing the Sublime Porte on the subject of the arbitrary demolition by the municipal authorities at Bagdad of property belonging to British subjects under the pretext that they were in a dangerous condition. In one case it was a question of six shops which had been built only four years ago and which were in a perfectly sound condition. The owners of this property —as also of other properties of British subjects which have been similarly demolished at Bagdad, Kazimia, and Kerbela—protested against the pretext being given that the houses w T ere in dangerous condition, but these protests, contrary to the regulations governing such matters, were rejected, and their properties arbitrarily demolished by force, while the authorities refused also to apply the expropriation law. His Majesty’s Embassy is convinced that the Imperial Ottoman Government cannot approve 'these illegal proceedings of its local authorities at Bagdad, and in accordance with instructions received from His Britannic Majesty’s Government, has the honour to request that orders may be sent to the Bagdad vilayet to indemnify the British subjects for the losses incurred by them owing to the arbitrary destruction of their property under certain pretexts which really amount to acts of veiled spoliation.

WITH reference to the memorandum communicated to this department on the 12 th instant by Colonel Picot, regarding the destruction of part of your premises at Bagdad, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that on the 8 th instant His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople in a note to the Turkish Government requested that orders might be sent to the local authorities at Bagdad to indemnify the British subjects for the losses incurred by them owing to the arbitrary destruction of their property. In reports received from Sir G. Lowther it is stated that your firm contemplated bringing an action for damages against the Turkish authorities.

Note respecting Bagdad Premises.—{Communicated by Colonel Picot, October 12 , 1910.) . BASING themselves on the allegation that the wall and shops on onr property lacing the road were unsound, the local authorities at Bagdad suddenly and without notice pulled down this wall and the shops. The consul-general had previously satisfied himself that they were perfectly sound. Inasmuch as our main business office, with all its accessories of machinery, sheds, stores, &amp;c., occupies a considerable portion oi the same site, and immediately adjoins the road, it is obvious that in order to widen the road they must take a slice of these main offices, thus destroying the utility of the buildings of which they form part, and necessitating the rebuilding of them. The idea is evidently to do this without paying compensation. The sum involved will be about 2 , 000 /. So fai as we have been able to ascertain there is no law m Turkey permitting a municipality to expropriate, without compensation of the owner, a property adjoining a road, m order to widen the road. According to article 8 of the “ Corps de Droit ottoman” (Young’s translation, Clarendon Press, 1906), if the municipality decide that a street shall in the future be enlarged, any new buildings which may in the future be constructed by the adjoining owners must be put back to the approved width. Recognising this, the municipal authorities pulled down the portion of our premises at present in question on the ground that it was unsound and involved danger to the passers by. They then counted upon article 8 of the law compelling us to erect a new wall and shops farther back from the road at our own expense. It is this purely arbitrary action on their part that we are combating. If it be not successfully resisted, their next step will be to allege that the frontage of our main premises is unsound. In this way they will get all they want without compensation. The questions which confront the Foreign Office in connection with this case are extremely serious and must come directly home to them. These questions are: . 1- Are they prepared to allow the Turkish Government to take a slice of 4 feet off, for instance, the British Embassy building in Constantinople or any other buildino- in Turkey, the property of the British Government, without paying compensation ? It is obvious that in the case of the embassy, and it is probable in the case of the other buildings in other parts of Turkey, that such embassy or other buildings would have to be entirely rebuilt. 2. If the Foreign Office would not be prepared to sanction such action, and would be obliged to resist it on the ground that it was opposed to all civilised practice, is it not clear that in not resisting procedure of this kind in our case they are establishing a precedent which will debar them from resisting it in their own case ? It seems clear from all the despatches which we have received that the consul- general, who has only recently arrived at his post, is looking for instructions and he has hitherto refused to take any official action at all. The course we advocated at the first, and which the Foreign Office approved, was that we should erect a temporary fence upon the portion of the property which has been arbitrarily taken away, and maintain it there until the whole question has been settled. It would seem that the consul-general is loath to sanction this course. We hope, therefore, that instructions may be sent from 'Constantinople authorising its adoption in accordance with the despatch from the Foreign Office dated the 20th August, informing us that Sir G. Lowther had made a vigorous protest to the Turkish Government and had supported the demand for the restoration of the land seized and for the erection of a temporary fence on the site of the former wall.

IN continuation of my letter No. 711 of the 13th August, 1910, I have the honour to submit copies of further telegraphic correspondence (purports only) on the subject of an apprehended aggression by the Turkish local Government on the British political residency at Bagdad. I also enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from the vali, showing that the danger has now been removed. hies' r 2. A fact not mentioned in any of the telegrams, because it did not immediately come to my knowledge, is that Eram Bey, the vali’s political secretary, himself enquired of a member of my staff during the period of suspense whether there would be any objection to the new street being carried across the residency grounds, and what the results of such an arrangement would be. To this question the officer interrogated not inaptly replied that the amenity of the residency would be destroyed, and that an increase of the residency guard would be necessitated, as two compounds would require more sentries to watch them than one. 3. The point chiefly urged by the political secretary in his conversation with me, referred to in my telegram of the 22nd August, was that I should have addressed myself to him if I thought that the residency was in danger, and not to the Turkish engineer of works. This seems at first sight a plausible objection ; but, as explained in my last letter, the object of the local Government was probably to force me to begin on humiliating terms a discussion with them of the immunities and privileges of this residency—a discussion which might have acquired a wider scope as it proceeded. For this reason, instead of referring to the political secretary, I gave the engineer of works, with whom I am personally acquainted, a sufficient opportunity of contradicting, either directly or through the vali’s political office, the sinister rumours, which, if he did not himself set them afloat, he at least knew to be current and to be generally believed. It will be seen that my note to the engineer was worded in such a way as neither to give offence to Turkish susceptibilities nor to admit any anxiety on my part on account of the residency. 3. I trust that my action throughout this matter, which now appears closed, mav be approved by the Government of India and by His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, [2901 cc—2] / * Annexures received from India Office, October 17, 1910y 1 i f r M Annexure No. 1. Purport of a Telegram from the Political Resident, Bagdad, to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated August 16, 1910. The Yali of Bagdad is believed to have the intention of continuing, through the compound of the British residency, a public street which is now in process of con struction. The buildings of this residency would thereby be separated from one another, and the subdivision of the property would much diminish its market value; and it would, besides, be an act of wantonness on the vali’s part, xklready there exists a road which could be widened. This apprehended action of the local Government would be manifestly malicious in intention, and carried through with a political purpose. The consul-general wired to the Ambassador, whose reply was that he would see to the matter in Constantinople, and deprecate the alleged intention to interfere with the residency grounds. The consul-general is strongly of opinion that our credit in Bagdad depends upon our offering uncompromising resistance to any such project, and requests that, if the Government of India are of that opinion, they will immediately communicate with the British Government, as otherwise it may be too late to do anything. Annexure No. 2. Purport of a Telegram from His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Bagdad, to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador, Constantinople, dated August 17, 1910. Refers to the Ambassador’s wire of the 16th August, and states that the intention of the local authorities in the matter of the threatened encroachment on the grounds of the British residency is purely political and malicious. By taking steps to interfere with the residency the local Government would show to what extent foreigners and foreign interests are in their power. It is not a question of surrendering a portion of the grounds to enable the municipality to carry out projected improvements, but of yielding to the early-avowed policy of the vali of forcibly reducing the status of the British consulate-general; also, by permitting subdivision of the grounds, a valuable Government property would be much depreciated in value. To deprecate interference might only embolden the Turks to carry out a project over which they were hesitating, and the consul-general is therefore of opinion that the case is one for absolute prohibition. Mr. Lorimer has wired to the Government of India explaining to them the position of affairs, because they are jointly interested with His Majesty’s Government in the Bagdad residency. He would repeat once more that there is no reason at all for continuing the new street farther than the place where it will reach the wall of the residency garden. Annexure No. 3. Purport of a Telegram from His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople, to His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Bagdad, dated August 17, 1910. The Acting Grand Vizier, who is also the Minister of Justice, has assured the Ambassador that he will permit no arbitrary encroachment on the grounds of the British consulate-general at Bagdad. He is communicating by telegram with the vali on the subject. Annexure No. 4. Purport of a Telegram, from the British Political Resident, Bagdad, to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated August 19, 1910. The Resident, Bagdad, refers to his telegram to the Foreign Office, Simla, dated the 16th August, and states that the British Ambassador has received assurances that encroachment will not be permitted. It has been noticed here that a Turkish flag, itfiiipuphitigaw 1 meamam — 3 which for some days past had flown over a wall close to the enclosing wall of the British residency, has since been removed. Annexure No. 5. Purport of a Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bagdad, dated August 19, 1910. His Excellency refers to the consul-general’s telegram dated the 17th August, and enquires whether, during the last two days, the attitude of the local authorities has undergone any alteration. It is possible that the political attitude of the vali is not entirely the outcome of his own persona] conviction, but that his entourage may have had something to do in inspiring it. Annexure No. 6 . Purport of a Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bagdad, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, dated August 20, 1910. States in reply to the Ambassador’s telegram of the preceding day that a Turkish flag which had been erected near the wall of the residency to mark the direction of the new street was quietly taken away on the 17th August, but that the consul-general may not be able to answer his Excellency’s question about the attitude of the local authorities for a few days. His personal relations with the Governor-General, however, are still perfectly friendly. Annexure No. 7.

Purport of a Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bagdad, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, dated August 22, 1910. Mentions, in continuation of the consul-general’s telegram of the 20th August, that the Turkish Governor-General has now written to him officially repudiating all knowledge of the supposed scheme of encroaching on the residency. The political secretary has also called on the consul-general bearing a message to the same effect, but more strongly expressed. In despatches which have been sent by post the Ambassador will find the consul-general’s reasons for questioning the truthfulness and sincerity of these belated assurances. The consul-general, however, has not challenged their truth, but in receiving them he remarked that the circumstances which led him to take action were certainly calculated to inspire doubt. The consul-general has promised the vali’s political secretary that though the question of the residency wall [2901 rc—2] B 2was still exciting the town, and though only last Saturday a crowd collected to look at it in expectation of its being pulled down, he would observe a discreet silence on the subject of what had passed. It cannot be questioned that the Turkish officials knew perfectly well what was expected by the populace, and did nothing to dispel the idea. The recent unceremonious treatment of the German community, and the fact tha the Turkish engineer of works, with whom he w r as personally acquainted, neither replied to his letter himself nor caused a reply to be sent to it through the proper office, are the principal grounds on which the consul-general entertained suspicions. In the consul-general’s opinion, his Excellency the Ambassador’s action at Constantinople has had a most salutary effect in maintaining British prestige at Bagdad, and it may even assist the solution of certain other difficulties outstanding locally. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, September 3, 1910. I HAVE the honour to submit, in continuation of my letter of the 22nd August, 1910, a copy of a communication which I made to the political secretary of the Bagdad vilayet on the 24th August, 1910, in regard to a threatened encroachment by the Turkish local authorities upon the precincts of this residency. The occasion of this letter was a private request made to me on the evening of the 23rd August, on a steamer excursion organised by his Excellency the Vali, that I should report to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the whole question of interference with the residency had arisen in consequence of a “ misunderstanding,” presumably on my part. As the Government of India will observe, I have been careful to rebut this suggestion, which to me seems to argue a guilty consciousness on the part of the Turkish authorities. Everyone in Bagdad, whether European or native, believes that some sort of coup de main against this residency had been prepared ; and, in view of the remarks which have been and continue to be made to me by various foreigners and persons in a position to know the real intentions of the Turks, I can only congratulate myself on having brought the matter to notice in time to avert a very disagreeable incident.

Your Excellency, Bagdad, September 3, 1910. I HAVE the honour to enclose, for your information, copies of papers relating to the case of Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers, British Indian manufacturers of ice at Bagdad. I have telegraphed more than once to your Excellency about this case ; but the present despatch and its enclosures explain the position more fully than it was possible to do by telegram. The papers submitted are in one or two instances extracts only, matters relating to other cases having been intentionally omitted from them An ice machine owned by the Bagdad municipality has existed here for a number of years ; but its output, I understand, is not very considerable. It is, at any rate, quite incommensurate with the requirements of Bagdad, which three existing ice machines do not fully meet. The only local manufacturers of ice besides the municipality are Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers, who own two factories, who are the commercial pioneers of the industry, in developing which they have shown much enterprise, and who have sunk a considerable capital in it. Messrs. Abdul All’s first and smaller machine, upon this side of the river, is now completing its third season ; the larger, on the further side, was erected last spring and commenced working shortly' 1 ' after the arrival of Nazim Pasha, the present vali, at Bagdad. There w T as some difficulty about the establishment of the earlier machine, in which connection I would refer your Excellency to my predecessor’s marginally noted despatches but it was overcome, and the machine has since then been allowed to work without objection. I have no reason to think that the account of the erection of the second machine given by Messrs. Abdul Ali in one of the enclosures to this despatch is in any way incorrect. I abstained from intervention in that matter. Messrs. Abdul Ali are also the owners of an ice machine at Karbala, where there is only one other, owned by a Russian subject. Soon after the middle of July last, the vali, through the medium of the Bagdad municipality, issued an order that ice was not to be sold at a rate exceeding 10 paras a kilogramme. This was an arbitrary and a very low rate, as shown by the fact that, according to Messrs. Abdul All’s books, they have sometimes been able, in the summer season, to obtain as much as 50 or 60 paras a kilogramme for their ice. These prices were voluntarily paid by their customer s, and are an index of the market value of the commodity. Before the establishment of Messrs. Abdul All’s first factory, the municipality used to sell their ice at 40 paras per kilogramme wholesale, and it was sometimes retailed at double that figure. The competition of Messrs. Abdul Ali thus greatly reduced the price to consumers and benefited the whole population of Bagdad. Nazim Pasha had before this taken upon himself to regulate authoritatively the * Not before, as was erroneously reported in my telegram of August 26; but this point is not material. f No. 673/89 of July 31, 1907, and No. 489/51 of June 4, 1908. [2930 r—2] Bprice of grain and flour at Bagdad, as I reported at the time (see Summary foi June 1910 Y, 10). On enquiring into the matter, I found that m the case of ice the vah relied upon article 3 of the Law of Provincial Municipalities,* which contains a list of matters with which such municipalities are empowered to deal. It will be observed that while this article confers the power of regulating the price of bread, which is a necessity of life, it says nothing of ice, which is a luxury and ought to be paid for as such by those who can afford it. So far as I can ascertain, the vah s idea m limiting the - price of ice was to gain a little cheap popularity at the expense of the manufacturers ; and the class whom he had chiefly in his mind seems to have been that of the young Turkish officers, not belonging to Bagdad, who have lately made their appearance here in large numbers, and who are not too well paid. I bad various conversations with the vali’s political secretary on the subject of the regulation of the price of ice, in which I maintained that action of the kind proposed was not warranted by the law, and eventually, though direct attempts to intimidate Messrs. Abdul Ali into compliance with the order did not cease, this side of the question was dropped by the secretary in his discussions with me. At one of our meetings the secretary hinted that, if the vali’s order were not obeyed, the vilayat would proceed to “play it low upon us' (“ aller faire des miseres”) by closing the Indian factories on the technical ground that they had been erected without municipal authorisation. Ihis remark was no doubt intended as a threat, but it was made in confidence, and it cannot therefore be quoted in any discussion at Constantinople. „ Ultimately, as the enclosures to this despatch show, the vali took the line fore shadowed by the secretary, and called on me to co-operate in closing the factories On my enquiring once more under what legal warrant this was proposed to be done, I was referred to the law of the 15th May, 1864, which lays down the conditions under which steam engines may be established. As the _ enclosed correspondence shows, 1 ha\e protested in vain against this perverse misapplication of a very clear law. the lurkisn text, as pointed out in my latest letter to the vali, is even more distinctly m favour of my contention than Young’s French translation of the law,t upon which the vilayat have apparently founded their arguments. So far as I can discover, there is no means under Turkish law of imposing conditions upon the use of machinery actuated by oil engines without recourse to new legislation, and such legislation would call for very careful discussion with foreign Powers before its introduction. The position now is that the two Indian factories are threatened with forcible closure under an irrelevant law, and I have the honour to request your Excellency s assistance in this matter, which vitally affects the security of all British owners of machinery here, such as Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co., Messrs. Blockey, Cree, and Co., and Messrs. Blaney and Solomon. I am told by the vali s ^ political secretary that Nazim Pasha, who is swayed largely by personal likes and dislikes, and who regards the slightest opposition to his measures (even if ^ illegal) as high treason, has place Messrs. Abdul Ali in his bad books, and is determined to ruin them if possible. Ibis !S a point which, of course, in view of the political secretary’s delicate position, and the freedom of his conversations with me, it is impossible to bring forward, even unofficially, but it deserves to be borne in mind by those who are responsible for the protection o Messrs. Abdul All’s commercial interests. It is for your Excellency’s orders what steps should be taken in regard to the loss of G.S.P. 24,693^ or upwards which has alrea y been sustained by Messrs.

Will the Porte agree to award them compensation by an executive order, or will it be necessary for t e rm to bring a suit against the Bagdad municipality ? Your Excellency will observe that the line which I have finally adopted is that, as no agreement on the legal question can be reached here, the matter ought f° be re erre for an authoritative decision by the Sublime Porte, in consultation with your Exce e ^ c 7’ at Constantinople ; and that, in the meantime, the status quo should be re ®P ec e This seems to me a reasonable suggestion, inasmuch as there is no urgency wha ever in the matter; and I have endeavoured to make it acceptable to the vali by oflermg o confer with any officer whom his Excellency may appoint, on the subject of defects a may exist in the factories. I understand, however, that it is not^ alleged that ey constitute in any respect a danger to the public ; and I do not anticipate that it can e shown that they are in any way a nuisance.

In conclusion, I would remark that Abdul Ali and his brothers are most meritorious ritish Indian subjects. They were originally working tin-smiths, but they have raised themselves by thrift and industry to a respectable and even prominent position among the foreign merchants at Bagdad. Their general shop is one of the best here. They state the amount of the capital sunk in their two factories at Bagdad to be about £ T. 3,095 ; and the loss to them through the closure of these factories at the present season would probably be £ T. 20 or more a-day. The loss per diem which they would sustain if they were compelled to part with their ice at Bagdad at 10 paras a kilogramme would apparently be £ T. 10 or upwards. Their factory at Karbala , on which they have expended, they say, £. T. 1,240, is liable to be interfered with, no doubt, in the same manner as their business at Bagdad has been. As Abdul Ali and his brothers are Bohrahs, and, therefore, members of an important commercial caste at Bombay, I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to the Government of India for information. Abdul Ali is the accredited agent in this country of the “ Faiz-i-Husaini,” a great Bohrah association for the facilitation of pilgrimages. Even at the present season scores of pilgrims are passing monthly through his hands ; and, as the weather grows cooler, the number will rise to hundreds. It is only to be expected that on their return to India these pilgrims will talk freely of the state of matters prevailing at Bagdad, and that their views will reflect those of Abdul Ali and his agents. I trust that your Excellency may be pleased to approve of my action up to the present in this somewhat difficult case. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMEB, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Statement of Khair Muhammad, a British Subject in the Service of Messrs. Abdid Ali Brothers, and in charge of the latter s Ice Shop in the Suk-el-Meydan AT about noon of the 20th July, 1910, a servant of the Baladieh named Selman came to the ice shop and asked the price of the ice, and I told him that the price was 20 paras per kilogramme. He said : “I shall report you, and you will be fined 2 liras.” He then left the shop and went to Yuzbashi Ali Riza Beg, who was at the time superintending the levelling of the roads in the neighbourhood. Yuzbashi Ali Biza Beg sent after me, and I went to him. He asked me : “ Why do you sell ice at 20 paras per kilogramme ? A notice has been issued by the vali that ice shall be sold at 10 paras per kilogramme.” I told him that I had received no orders from the vali to sell ice at 10 paras. He replied : “ As the vali’s orders had not reached you, I order you to sell at 10 paras.” This conversation took place in the bazaar. I returned to the shop, and the servant of the Baladieh came there and asked me for ice at 10 paras the kilogramme. I refused to give at that price, and said that I wanted a written order first. The servant went and informed Yuzbashi Ali Riza Beg, who came to the shop and ordered the man on the scales to give the servant 5 kilog. of ice at 1 0 paras per kilogramme, raising at the same time a whip, and threatening to strike the weigher. The latter being afraid of a thrashing at once weighed out 5 okes of ice and gave it to the servant. I asked him to give me a written order showing that I was forcibly ordered to sell ice at 10 paras per kilogramme. He agreed, and gave me a written paper in Turkish. I closed the shop and went to inform Abdul Ali, and handed over to him the paper that Yuzbashi Ali Riza Beg gave to me. At the time I had twelve blocks of ice, weighing 600 kilog., in the shop. I returned to the shop, but I did not sell any more ice that day. On the following morning I went to the shop and sold what remained of it, about 180 to 200 kilog., at 10 paras per kilogramme. After this incident 1 did not sell any more ice in the shop. About three or four days later a zabtieh came to me to the shop and told me that Jawad Beg wanted me at the Sarai. I told him that I had no ice and it was no use my going. The zahtieh said that someone had reported me to Jawad Beg to the effect that I had ice in the shop and was selling it at 20 paras the kilogramme. I then4 went with the zabtieh to Jawad Beg. The latter said to me: “Your Eflendi has written to the vali that it does not pay you to sell ice at 10 paras the kilogramme; if it is so you must close the factory.” I told him that I had not brought ice to the shop, nor had sold ice for the last few days. Why had he sent for me ? He then said that^ whoever wanted to sell ice must sell it at 10 paras the kilogramme. A couple of retailers who were standing by at the time addressed Jawad Beg, saying that if they were to sell ice at 10 paras the kilogramme they would lose. Jawad Beg told them that he would direct the municipality to sell them ice at 8 paras the kilogramme, and they could dispose of it at 10 paras. 1 then left the Sarai, and since that day, fearing interference, I have sold no ice.

Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to M. Eram Bey. Dear M. Eram Bey, Bagdad, July 22, 1910. ABDUL ALI, the British Indian merchant, has come to me this morning to report that ice is being demanded from him by a military officer at 1 piastre per hukkah, whereas he usually sells it at 2 piastres. I should like to discuss with you some time the question whether under Turkish law a trader can be compelled to sell his goods at a fixed price ; I am not personally aware of any law which authorises it. This at least seems to me clear, that he cannot be compelled to manufacture goods in order to sell them at a rate which he does not accept. I have therefore told Abdul Ali that if he does not consider the price of 1 piastre per hukkah satisfactory he is at liberty to cease the manufacture of ice ior the present. I have thought it better to inform you of this and to send Abdul Ali to you with one of my dragomans, in case he should decide on closing his ice factory until the reduced rate is withdrawn, and inconvenience should thereby be caused to the public during the next few days. Yours very truly, J. G. LORIMER. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Messrs. Abdid Ali Brothers to Consul-General Lorimer. Sir, Bagdad, July 30, 1910. WE beg to bring to your notice that we have so far obeyed the order of his Excellency the Vali, and are selling the ice at the rate of 10 paras per kilogramme, but we find ourselves unable to carry out any further the orders of his Excellency the Vali. This arbitrary rate of 10 paras per kilogramme of ice does not cover even our manufacturing expenses, not to speak of the profit on the investment. We beg to bring to your notice that comparatively much higher rates for ice^ prevail in Europe from whence these mechanics, &amp;c., come, and where the cost of working these machines is much cheaper owing to the facilities of transport, plentifulness of expert workers, and the climate which comparatively allows a very small percentage of wastage of the ice. We are informed that even in Constantinople the rate per kilogramme is double what we have been selling at before his Excellency the Valis order, i.e., 20 paras per kilogramme.Prior to our bringing in these machines the municipality rate at Bagdad was 40 paras per kilogramme, as is the case at the present moment at Bussorah and Amarah.* It is we that by increasing the number of ice machines had reduced the rate to 20 paras. The municipality possessed only one machine which turned out a very insignificant ^amount of ice which was not sufficient even for a single quarter of Bagdad, and ice could not be had at any price after a certain fixed time. At the repeated requests of Colonel J. Ramsay and the leading men of Bagdad we established ice factories at Bagdad, and have been supplying ice not only to Bagdad public at a reduced rate, but also to Kazimain and Karbala people as well. These services for the last four years should have given us a claim to the particular consideration of the local authorities, but we are sorry to find that unjustifiable obstructions are put in our way, in order, we believe, to secure the monopoly for the municipality. Turkish officials make no secret of their feelings towards foreign traders, and some of them have openly told us to our face that we had no right to benefit ourselves at the cost of Turkish people, as if we employed unfair means to do so. We believe every person is free to earn his livelihood, by fair means of course, in Turkish dominions. We have always conformed to the laws and regulations of the country, and have always obeyed the rules regulating trade in Turkey. We therefore cannot understand why unlawful difficulties are put in our honest business. We know that in other civilised countries there is no law regulating rates for articles of trade, and our enquiring from the advocates lead us to believe that there is no such law even in Turkey, and that this order of his Excellency the Yali is arbitrary and contrary to the law. To-day a rate is prescribed for ice, and to-morrow a rate will be fixed for other articles we deal in. It means that we should altogether close our business and depart. If from the beginning they have fixed a rate for the ice, we have not undergone such a heavy expense and loss. We therefore beg to request that you will kindly represent the matter to his Excellency the Yali and submit our grievances to his Excellency the Ambassador^ at Constantinople telegraphically, as we are suffering a great loss. Moreover, we are losing the season, the earnings of which enables us alone to maintain the establishment of the factories for the whole year. We beg, &amp;c. (Abdui Ali Brothers), A. ALLI ADAMJI Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Purport of Telegram from Consul-General Lonmer to Sir' G. Lowther. Bagdad, July 31, 1910. MANUFACTURERS of ice have been ordered not to take a higher price than 10 paras per kilogramme for their ice. By this order a British Indian subject, who could formerly ask 20 paras per oke, has been hard hit, as he is the laigest manufactuiei of ice here. The new price will not, he says, allow him to sell at a profit, and he is of opinion that the order has been given so as to edge him out of the business, and allow the municipal ice factory to step in and have a monopoly. Certain oil engines within municipal limits, which until the present have been working there, have been ordered to cease work by the vali s directions. Two flour mills owned by European British subjects come under the prohibition. It may be that this is designed to cause the owners to purchase new sites outside the town from the municipal authorities, or perhaps it is a blow aimed at their business. Both these orders seriously, and possibly intentionally, interfere with British trade, and they do not appear to have any legal justification. Your Excellency might be so kind as to take what steps are required to protect these interests. The hot season, during which the demand for ice is great, is passing on fast, so that until some decision is arrived at things might be permitted to continue as heretofore. 9 [2930 r—2] CEnclosure 6 in No. 1.

Constantinople, August 2, 1910. f* REFERS to our wire of the 31st July, and states that the price of necessities like bread can be fixed by the municipality under article 3 of the municipal laws. To interpret the article as giving power to regulate the price of luxuries would appear somewhat arbitrary, though it is conceivable that this could be done. There appears to he no legal justification for the stoppage of a mill by the vali. He is at liberty to expropriate if he desires to improve the town. His Excellency the Ambassador has spoken of both matters at the Porte, but considers that such matters might better be settled locally with the vali. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to M. Eram Bey. Dear M. Eram Bey, Bagdad, August 3, 1910. WILL you please refer to my letters to you of the 26th and 28th July ? I have now studied the question of the power of 1 urkish municipalities to regulate prices, and I find that they are only entitled to fix the price of bread. The law on the subject is that of 1877, “ Provincial Municipalities, article 3. I propose therefore to inform Abdul Ali Brothers that they are at liberty to sell their ice at whatever price they please, but I think his Excellency might prefer that the municipality should itself inform the firm in question that the restrictive order is withdrawn; and I shall therefore await your answer before communicating my opinion to Abdul Ali. I would ask you to reply at your early convenience, as a British trader is suffering considerable loss from an order which now appears to be illegal. As to oil engines, there seems to be no law under which they can be prohibited from working within the municipal limits. I am told that the prohibition has been withdrawn, but I should be glad to know this from you, as the information I have received may be incorrect. Believe me, yours very truly, J. Cl. LORIMER. Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Note by Consul-General Lorimer. ON the 5th July Eram Bey called. 2 . On the 6 th July Abdul Ali came, and I told him that in my opinion he was free to charge what he liked for his ice. I added that Eram Bey said, if he charged over rate fixed, his factory would be closed as being defective. I said I would contest closure on ground of his having manufactured for four years and sunk capital in business without objection. J. G. L. Bagdad, Jidy 7, 1910. Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Statement by Abdul Ali, ABDUL ALI states :— I have now been selling my ice at 1 piastre a kilogramme under compulsion f^ om tj\ e Turkish authorities'^ for about a month. I first received the order through Musa Ghalabi, acting president of the municipality. Since then I have always sold the ice at the same * I can ascer tain the exact date.—J. Gr. L.reduced price. On the first day, before I had informed my branches, Ali Biza Beg Yuzbashi went to my Midan branch and threatened my agent with a stick, and obliged him to sell the stock, some 300 or 400 okes, to a crowd of people at a reduced price. The loss was thus about 300 or 400 piastres. After this I began to sell at J piastre. About five or six days later, the Sar-Mufattish and two Mamurs of the Baladieh came to my shop and entered my private room, and said that I was selling my ice in various places through my agents at 3 and 4 piastres an oke. I replied that I was selling at 1 piastre, but that Turkish subjects who bought it from me retailed it on their own account, possibly, at higher prices. They declined to believe this explanation, and ordered me to stop working my machine. I declined to attend to the order, and said they should deal with me through the consulate. An hour later, Musa Chalabi and the Sar-Mufattish came to me, and said that the vali had sent for me to order me to stop my machine. Musa admitted that, when he was going to the vali, he had stopped a man carrying ice from my shop, and asked at what price it had been sold, to which the man had replied, “ 1 piastre” ; and he had told the vali this, and the vali had said nothing. This settled the thing for the time being. It was about fifteen days ago. On Monday last (the 10 th August) an Effendi (name not known) came to my small machine house, and said, “ Why don’t you sell the ice to the people who are waiting outside ? ” The door was closed : they forced it. He made my employe sell the ice there at 1 piastre ; and about half of it disappeared without being paid for at all. On Tuesday a man complained against my employe on the further bank that he had taken 65 piastres, and given him less than 50 kilog. of ice. Five or six police and municipal officials came to the factory there. There was some delay in opening the door, and they severely beat the coolie (a Turkish subject) who came to open it. The ice was weighed after this and found to be 60 kilog. Some of it may have melted. At any rate, it was sold in a lump and not by weight. My little ice machine on this side has been working for nearly four years. After the beginning no difficulty was made. My larger machine on the further side was established last April. I got permis sion in writing to erect the premises. It is not the custom here to get any special permission for a factor} 7 . J. G. LOBIMEB. Bagdad, August 11, 1910. Enclosure 10 in No. 1. Consul-General Larimer to the Vali of Bagdad. Your Excellency, Bagdad, August 11, 1910. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the British firm of Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers have complained to me of interference with their trade on the part of the Bagdad municipality, which has been attempting during the past month to oblige them to sell their ice to the public at an arbitrary rate. As Turkish provincial municipalities have no power to regulate the price of ice, I have informed Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers that they are at liberty to fix and alter the price of their ice as they please; and I have instructed them to refer to me in case of any further illegal interference with their operations. I beg that your Excellency will give this matter your early attention, as Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers have suffered considerable loss by the unlawful action of the municipality, and the treatment which they have received is calculated to alarm and to discourage all the British merchants at Bagdad. Pray accept, &amp;c. J. G. LOBIMEB.Enclosure 11 in No. 1. Statement by Abdul Ali. (Memorandum.) . . ABDUL ALI came to the consulate-general this morning and made the toiiowmg report :— w) Yesterday afternoon, at about a little before 4 o’clock, Abdul Rahman Pasha, president of the municipality, sent for him at his private house, and there were Jawad Beg, Abdul Kader Khedeiri, and others present. He (Abdul Ali) was accompanied by his brother, Tayibali. ^ ^ ^ , ,, Speaking for Jawad Beg, Abdul Rahman Pasha told him that, as they were not obeying the orders of the vali, and were not selling ice at 10 paras the kilogramme, and as he had not, obtained permission to erect his factory, they would stop his factory working, and he must not think that it would be permitted to sell ice at Bagdad at a higher rate than 10 paras the kilogramme. ' Abdul Ali asked them whether the permit referred to the small or large factory, and they replied that it referred to both. _ Abdul Ali told them that, as regards the small factory, the municipality opposed its erection at first, but after a prolonged correspondence between the British consulate-geneial and the vilayat, the consul- general told him that he may erect and work the factory, and when he worked his ice machine, the municipality interfered no longer with him ; but as regards the big factory, he reported to the municipality his desire to build it, and on numerous occasions officers, a doctor, an engineer, and a couple of councillors were sent to inspect the place and machinery, and finally the municipality issued to him a written permit, for which he was charged a fee, while other factories were not charged any fees at all. Jawad Beg replied, through Abdul Rahman, that he knew that Abdul Ali had no permits, and that the next day (the 17th August) he would close both factories. Abdul Ali said that he would not himself stop the factories, and that, if they wished to do anything, they had better correspond with the consulate-general regarding the question. Before leaving, Jawad Beg directed Abdul Rahman Pasha to write to the vali about closing the factories. p J. G. G. August 17, 1910. Enclosure 12 in No. 1. Note by Mr. Gaskin. Resident, I SUBMIT a letter from Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers, enclosing an account of their sales of ice at 10 paras the kilogramme from the 22nd July, 1910, to the 14th August, 1910. The account shows that 98,771 kilog. of ice were sold for G.S.P. 24,693j. It is experienced that between the 14th July and the 13th August the most oppressive heat of the season prevails, and Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers declare that their books will prove that during that period in previous years they usually obtained from 30 to 60 paras the oke for their ice ; it cannot therefore be considered as romantic if they were to claim that they could have sold their ice at 20 paras the kilogramme during the period they were forced to dispose of their ice at 10 paras the kilogramme If Messrs. Abdul Ali are in the right, then they have a lawful claim against^ the local authorities for G.S.P. 24,693^, the difference in the price they would have obtained for their ice. J. C. G. August 25, 1910. Enclosure 18 in No. 1. Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers to Consul-General Lommer. Sfip Bagdad, August 19, 1910. WE most respectfully beg to state that, according to the order issued by his Excellency the Governor-General of Bagdad, we sold our ice at the rate of 10 paras instead of 20 paras, the statement of which is herewith sent for your kind perusal.I have examined the law of the i 5th May, 1864,relating to steam factories and engines, and to my mind it is clear that the said law has no bearing at all upon oil engines. Moreover, as your Excellency has yourself pointed out, oil engines did not exist at the time of the passing of the law; and this fact alone seems sufficient to prove that the ^law in question cannot be held to regulate the case of oil engines, which are quite different in their nature from steam engines. An oil engine has no boiler (“ chaudiere ”), and there is therefore no fear of a boiler explosion—the danger against which the law cited is designed to provide. The motive force of an oil engine is derived from the combustion, at each revolution, of a, small quantity of vaporised oil. There is therefore no reason why the same authorisation should be required for an oil engine as for a steam engine ; and I think it is clear, besides, that the existing law does not require any authorisation. Your Excellency also refers to the words “nature of fuel” (“nature du com bustible”) ; but from the context it is evident that the reference is to the fuel used in steam boilers, that is to say, coal or wood. In these circumstances, l regret that I am unable to accept your Excellency s view of the law, or to make any communication on the subject to the owner of the factories, or to depute any representative from this consulate-general to take part in closing the factories. Pray accept, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER Enclosure 19 in No. 1. Purport of Telegram from Consul-General Larimer to Sir G. Lowther. Bagdad, August 30, 1910. REFERS to Ambassador’s telegram of 27th August, and informs him that on the 28th August Nazim Pasha informed Mr. Lorimer by official letter that, as the factories of the Indian manufacturer, Abdul Ali, were not legally authorised (by the law of 1864), he intended to have them closed. The answer to this contention in the first place, and to Mr. Lorimer’s mind a sufficient one, is that itys evident from every clause of the above law of 1864 that the reference is to steam engines and boilers. As legards oil engines, there is no law for such, nor is any required, as an oil engine is smokeless and is not a source of danger. Mr. Lorimer has replied to the vali that he does not assent to the order to close the factories, nor will he send a representative to participate in any closure. The consul-general has not thought it necessary to point out to the vali that, until the present time, the factories had continued to work without objection, and that only when his Excellency attempted unsuccessfully to regulate the price of ice had any objection to the working of the factories been raised. This morning the large factory was visited by police and gendarmerie, and it was threatened with demolition. On a former occasion the employes in the shop were threatened with violence. From j 22nd July until 14th August the estimated loss of revenue to Abdul Ali is about ; £T. 250. The above described incidents are most prejudicial to our national credit ; here, and the impression they might convey in India might be unfortunate. Mr. Lorimer refers to another case on which he is at present occupied, which concerns a British subject who appears to have been beaten, and 20L taken from him by the ^ lurkish police. Until Constantinople applies effective check here the situation will not improve. Mr. Lorimer asks his Excellency the Ambassador if he is satisfied that the Minister has taken action as promised. Enclosure 20 in No. 1. Statement of Faiz Muhammad-ibn-Noor Muhammad, British Subject, in the Service of Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers, Bagdad. AT about 10 a.m. on Satuday morning (the 28th August) a Turkish soldier named Kathem came to the ice factory and wanted ice at 10 paras a kilogramme, but I refused him, and told him I was directed to sell ice only at 20 paras. The soldier took 9 kilog. of ice, and paid me G.S.P. 4l, and went away. ^ n r , 1 i . „ x . At about 4 p.m. the same day a Turkish officer named Zakki Bey came to the12 factory and asked the price of ice, and I told him that the price was 20 paras. Zakki Bey went away without saying anything further. About half-an-hour later another Turkish officer came to the factory and entered it. He asked for ice, and I told him the price was 20 paras a kilogramme. He said that he would take it by force from me. I told him that he could not take it fromi me, as the matter was not in my hands; he had better go to the owner ot the goods. He said he would pluck my eyes out and take it, and abused me grossly. I told him that he had no right to abuse me, as the factory belongs to a foreign subject, and if he wanted the ice at 10 paras the kilogramme he should go and buy it from the municipality factory. He replied that so long as the factory was in this country he would take the ice at the same price as that charged at the municipality factory, and, if we did not agree, would remove the factory. I told him that my employers would charge me the full price, and that I was a poor man. Why should he cause me loss ? There was a block and a-half of ice on the counter. The soldier, Kathem, who was with him, weighed the ice, which proved to be :.0 kilog. The officer threw a quarter of a mejidie on to the counter and Kathem took up the ice. I told the officer that I would not take the quarter mejidie. He refused to pay me anything moie, and I asked him to give me a note to the effect that he has taken 20 kilog. of ice at 10 paias, so that my employers should not charge the difference to me. The officer gave me the attached paper, and I sent it immediately to my masters. When Mulla Ahmed Ali Khan came to the factory in the evening to record the sales of ice, he told me that since I had allowed the 20 kilog. to go at 10 paras, I would have to pay the difference.

J’avais pourtant fait ces citations dans fintention bien determinee de vous convaincre que la loi precitee etait parfaitement applicable a votre ressortissant. Aussi, pour eviter tout malentendu, je viens vous prier de bien vouloir me repondre aux deux questions suivantes :— 1 . Abdul Ali exploite-t-il une usine ? 2 . Abdul Ali possede-t-il une autorisation pour exploiter son usine ? Si vous voulez bien reconnaltre qu’Abdul Ali exploite actuellement une usine a glace et qu’il ne possede pas d’autorisation pour lexploitation de cette usine, Abdul Ali tombe sous le coup de la loi du 15 mai, 1864, parce que cette loi n’a pas 6t6 crdee uniquement pour la reglementation des usines a machines it vapeur, mais pour des usines et machines a vapeur, ainsi que son titre I’indique.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st August, 191 0, relating to the ice factories of the British subject, Abdul Ali, at Bagdad, and to say that, after full consideration, I still adhere to my former view, that the law of the 15th May, 1864, does not and cannot apply to his case. The title of the hrw in the original Turkish is very clear; it is the French translation which is ambiguous. In Turkish the law is called “ Regulations regarding Stationary Steam-engines,” and the word “ factories” does not so much as occur in its title. I would also draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that every operative article of the law, viz., articles Nos. 1 to 15 inclusive, contains the word “ boiler ” or “ boilers,” except articles 10 and 11, which refer to the capital only. Now, oil-engines have no boilers. This argument seems to me conclusive in favour of my interpretation. As no agreement has been reached here on the subject of the applicability of this law, I have the honour to suggest that your Excellency should refer the question to the Sublime Porte, as I have already done to the British Embassy at Constantinople. International courtesy, I think, requires that the status quo of the factories should remain undisturbed until the doubtful point has been settled by the superior authorities. Nevertheless, if your Excellency considers that either of Abdul Ali’s factories is defective in any respect, I shall willingly confer on this subject with any represen tative whom your Excellency may be pleased to appoint, in order that the defects, if serious, may be remedied.

Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 776/42. Confidential.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, September 5, 1910. I HAVE the honour to refer in the present despatch to a subject upon which I have been obliged to address your Excellency several times by telegram—that, namely, of the recent proceedings of the Yali of Bagdad in relation to immovable property owned by British subjects here. Your Excellency is aware of some of the projects which Nazim Pasha has formed since his arrival for the improvement of the city of Bagdad. These have been mentioned in my monthly summaries of events (see specially Summary for July 1910, III, 1, and VIII, 1, 2), and in their conception they are, perhaps, not altogether amiss; but the manner in which the vali has so far endeavoured to give effect to them is irregular and oppressive. The contemplated improvements consist chiefly in the laying out of new streets and the widening of old ones—processes which involve the partial or entire destruction of many existing houses and shops. The laws of the Ottoman Empire governing such operations are the Expropriation Law of the 15th May, 1879, and the Building Law of the 22nd August, 1891.* The only provisions of these laws to which at the present stage it is necessary to refer are articles 3, 4, 8, 14, and 17 of the former and 1 and 2 of the latter. By these it is required, briefly, that a plan of the immovable property to be taken shall be prepared and exhibited ; that the amount of the valuation shall be publicly notified in various ways ; that the proprietor shall be allowed fifteen days to lodge objections ; that if he does not accept the official valuation he shall be sued at law ; and, finally, that until either he has accepted the official valuation or a decree has been obtained against him in a competent court he shall not be deprived of his property. All these indispensable formalities and conditions seem to have been disregarded in the attempted execution of Nazim Pasha’s schemes ; and a number of houses and shops, of which the debris now render some of the main streets impassable, have already been partially or wholly destroyed without warrant of law. No one seems to be aware of the existence of any plan, though the engineers have possibly taken measurements ; and the vali’s political secretary in fact admitted to me that no plan had been prepared,! in consequence of there being no proper drawing-office, and that the work was simply being carried on by eye. In the cases of wdiich I have personally any cognisance, no regular notice has been given to the proprietors; no compensation has been tendered to them; the period prescribed by law has not been allowed them for lodging objections; and they have not been summoned before any court. The truth is, that the Bagdad muni cipality has not at the present moment funds to pay for expropriations, and that the vali is too impatient to wait until the money has been obtained, whether by raising a loan or otherwise. The uncertainty as to the exact course of Nazim Pasha’s devastating improvements and the rapidity with which his orders are carried out by Lieutenant-Colonel Javad Bey, a military engineer whom he has made director in municipal affairs, have greatly alarmed the house and shop proprietors of Bagdad. J No one feels sure that a new road through his house or shop may not be begun at an instant’s notice ; and I am assured that, as a consequence of the feeling of insecurity which has been created, neither purchasers nor mortgagees of immovable property are now forthcoming, upon any terms, at Bagdad. The Unceremonious demolition of the German club’s garden, § and the preparations for making a street across the middle of the British residency com pound, as an approach to a public park which was to be laid out beyond, || were proceedings connected with the vali’s improvements. So long as the demolitions did not affect British interests I remained a spectator of the above high-handed proceedings—nominally of the municipality, really of the vali. The arbitrary demolitions were the work of Nazim Pasha and Javad Bey, who refused, so I have been confidentially informed by the late acting president of the municipality * Young’s “ Corps de Droit ottoman.” VI, 127-151 and 137-148. f Since this was written the vali s political secretary has informed me (on the 5th September) that a plan has been prepared. I have asked to be allowed to inspect it. The plan has probably been prepared now in consequence of the discussions which have arisen.—J. Gr. L. | See also the enclosures to my despatch No. 768/38, dated September 3, 1910. See my telegram to your Excellency of August , 1910. See my despatch No. 773/40 of September 3, 1910, and the earlier ones of the same series.6 s attention to the restraining advice of the municipal com- ■RrV k r r 1 P^® seil ^y became apparent that the following properties of British or ment; 8 * ri&lt;: lan 811 l] ec ts were in imminent danger of arbitrary destruction or encroach- 1.

I immediately opened a correspondence with the vilayat on the subject of this menace to the rights of our people; and the copies of the letters exchanged, which are annexed to this despatch, speak for themselves. (The passages in the enclosures relating to expropriation without compensation, in certain circumstances, may be omitted, in reading, at this stage.) It will be seen that, on the 2nd August, the vali flatly refused to discuss the matter of the threatened properties with me, on the ground that the intervention of foreign consular officers in questions of immovable property was irregular. As a matter of fact, it was not the application of the Turkish law, but its violation, against which I was preparing to protest; and this the vilayat understood perfectly well. Seeing, however, that there was no chance of my arguments receiving consideration at Bagdad, I thought it better to desist from useless and irritating local discussions, and to proceed, thereafter, entirely by means of telegraphic references to your Excellency. I need not enter on further details of what occurred, these having been regularly reported to your Excellency by telegram. Suffice it to say that ultimately, on the 7th^ and 8th August, Messrs. Lynch’s wall and shops (No. 1 in the list above) were forcibly dismantled by municipal employes ; and that the part of the Ikbal-ed-Dowleh house (No. 4 in the list) nearest to the street was demolished in the same manner at about the same time. Both of these buildings had been condemned as dangerous, it was said, by the municipality ; but no proper notice was given to the manager in the one case or to the trustees in the other, and no opportunity was allowed them of raising legal objections or of undertaking repairs, supposing the latter to be really required. The Ikbal-ed-Dowleh house was old and possibly somewhat insecure ; but Messrs. Lynch’s wall and shops were in perfectly good condition, as personally ascertained by myself and Mr. Gaskin, the commercial assistant in this residency, who has had much experience of house building, and who himself constructed the large British political agency house at Manarah in Bahrain. The object in both these cases was the same, viz., to obtain land for widening a street without payment, by first demolishing a facade and then filching not only the land on which the facade had stood, but also a valuable strip of building ground lying behind. (I have never in my exptrience, I may say, encountered a more flagrant example than this of abuse of the law by those whose duty it is to protect and enforce it.) Mr. Thaddeus’ shop (No. 5 in the list) has also, 1 understand, been condemned as dangerous, and lies under sentence of destruction ; but I am in hope tha.t the measures which have been taken by your Excellency at Constantinople may avail to save it. It is like Messrs. Lynch’s wall and shops, is in perfectly good condition ; and I have taken the precaution of securing certificates to this effect from the native master builders, who were not informed of the purpose for which their opinions were required. Besides those I have obtained a detailed report on the subject from Mr. Gaskin, which is among the enclosures to this despatch. The other threatened buildings mentioned above (Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7) are still standing; but a police station which was next door to Nawab Muhammad Taki’s house has been levelled with the ground, nnd a small incision has been made in the wall of the house itself, which is naturally a cause of anxiety to the owner. It is impossible, in the absence of precise information regarding the intentions of the street- makers, who, as already remarked, have not explained them by means of a published plan as the law requires,* and whose own ideas I have reason to think are somewhat * See, however, the marginal note above about a plan having now been prepared.-—J. G. L.J 1G changeable, to form any close estimate of the damage likely to be caused to British subiects if all the demolitions at present apprehended are carried out. rough estimate by Mr. Gaskin is appended, in which the probable loss is estimated at £ T. 4,335; but this may prove to be either an under-estimate or an over-estimate^ according to the action eventually taken by the Turks. . , T . r, i , I should add that the Mutessarif of Karbala is busily copying Nazim Pashas methods in the town at which he has his seat (see Summary foi July 1910, II, 2), that the same irregular proceedings have been commenced there; and that there also British Indian subjects are likely to be sufferers. It Is necessary to refer to a point of Turk.sh aw which will inevitably arise in connection even with expropriations legally undertaken, viz., the meaning of article 8 of the Buildino- Law of the 22nd August, 1891. At Buseorah, in connection with the partial demolition last winter of a building belonging to the Faiz-i-Husaim a wealthy pilgrimage association of Indian Bohrahs, it was, I am informed, contended by the vali that under the snd article a portion not exceeding one-fourth in depth ot an immovable property, even a house, could be taken without payment of any compensation properly'so called, only the expense ot reconstructing the front, interior, &amp;c„ upon the new line of street being deb,table to the expropriating authority. I understand, however, that this view is not accepted by all lawyers and it seems to me that the article Is not applicable unless there is a question of the proprietor s constructing new buildings or undertaking fundamental repairs to an existing mi ding which is not the case in regard to the buildings now threatened or already demolished at Bagdad. The meaning of the French translation given in Young seems to me, however, far from plain* ; and I hive not been able, with the assistance of two very competent dragomans, to understand quite clearly the sense even ot “ r * s original. I gather that the legal advisers of Messrs. Lynch are inclined to think that the” article referred to applies only to lands not built upon ; but to myseif I confess this interpretation seems to err in the opposite direction troin that adopted by t e Turkish authorities at Bussorah, and indeed to be untenable. _ r r If it is a fact that the existing Turkish law authorises the seizure of one-fourth ot an individual’s property without payment of any compensation whatever m other words, its confiscation—I submit with the utmost deference that there are strong grounds for protesting against the existence, or at least the enforcement, of sue a barbarous regulation. It is easy to imagine cases in which its application would involve the most cruel hardship. ' A building might be already of the smallest possible depth, when, if one-fourth were taken from it, the remainder would lose all its value, moreover, tbe building might be the owner’s whole property. I venture to draw your Excellency’s attention in this connection to tbe detailed description ol Nawab Muhammad Taki’s house at Bagdad, which forms an enclosure to this despatch Another absurdity of the present Turkish building law are the provisions that ™ land required for widening a street shall be taken equally from both sides,T and that all streets shall be of a certain fixed breadth throughout4 The bad consequences o these provisions are obvious, and one of the streets now undeigomg en aigemen a Bagdad will, if the law is observed, afford an example of them on a large scale. In the case of this street, it will apparently be necessary to knock down the fronts of a series of high buildings (including Messrs. Lynch’s main offices and khan, the principa o e at Bagdad, &amp;c.) on both sides for a distance of perhaps a quarter of a-mi e lese ac s do not seem to have been taken into* consideration by the local authoiities v ien ie} demolished the Ikbal-ed-Dowleh house and Messrs. Lynch’s wall and shops forming part of the street in question. Why should land be taken from t lose pioper ies only, when the law requires that half the land shall be taken from t ie proper ies opposite them, and that the other premises situated in the street must be dealt wit similarly in order to give the street a uniform breadth from end to end . . For the reasons explained above, I suggest very respectfully that your xce ency should endeavour to obtain a suitable modification of the present luikisi ui &lt; mg aw, which is unworthy of a civilised country; and that your Excellency s on e Porte to prohibit in the meantime the application ot the existing iu es, w nc i ai j working widespread ruin in Bagdad.

I ArUcle LI do not wish to add to the contents of an already overburdened despatch ; but I cannot refrain from remarking here that the manner in which the local Government of Bagdad have abused their freedom in matters of immovable property is a valuable ^commentary on the desire of the Porte to obtain a relaxation of the Capitulations hearing upon the personal rights of foreigners. I shall have more to say on the subject of the Capitulations in a later despatch, in which I shall be obliged to trouble your Excellency with an account of what appears to be a serious outrage lately committed upon a British Indian subject at Bagdad by the Turkish police. As British Indian subjects are affected, I am submitting a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to the Government of India. I do not think, however, that the Government of India will wish to see the purports of my telegraphic correspondence with your Excellency, mainly on the subject of Messrs. Lynch’s premises ; and I have therefore omitted them from the enclosures. I trust that I may be fortunate enough to secure your Excellency s approval of my conduct of this case so far as it has yet proceeded. I have, &amp;c. J. G.

He disputes the allegation that the structures are in a dangerous state. n u n r In these circumstances, as Messrs.

I should be glad to know at the same time the official estimate which has been placed on the property of each with a view to compensa tion, and to be referred to the particular law under which expropriation will take place In this manner, everything can be satisfactorily arranged m advance between the vilayat and this consulate-general.

With reference to our conversation this morning, may I recapitulate the chiet points of what I then tried to say to you ? ’ . . I do not wish to support British subjects in any unreasonable claims, but, m a case in which it appeared to me that one of them was not being treated in accordance with the principles of natural justice, I should consider it my duty to take action. It would not be enough for me, in order to abstain, that the municipal or other authorities were proceedino- Snder the Turkish law ; it would also be necessary that the law m question should be^ in harmony with natural justice and with the usage of the most advanced nations Thus, if it should be proposed to destroy or acquire the property of a British subject without paying full compensation, I should feel myself obliged to move m the ixi er My first step would naturally be to approach his Excellency on the subject; but, if his Excellency thought my intervention improper, or if, while allowing my interven tion he found himself unable to grant relief, I should see no alternative to referring the matter to the British Embassy at Constantinople. Of course, I should do so in a spirit and terms perfectly amicable to the Bagdad Local Government, with whom I hope alwavs to preserve the best relations, official as well as private. For myself, I cannot think that the enlightened Ottoman Government of to-day would wish to enforce a law, passed in other times, which apparently authorises the confiscation of immovable property up to a limit of one-fourth without any compensation. , „ , The value of property so taken might amount to hundreds or thousands ot pounds, and cases are imaginable in which the loss of it might ruin the owner. It seems to me very desirable, if it is possible, that provisional arrangements should be made at Bagdad, pending new legislation, to meet in some way the case of the present expropriations. . . , You may rely on mv doing my best to accommodate matters m any way in which I can without exposing “'British subjects to what, from my point of view, appears to be inequitable treatment.

Petition dated August 3, 1910, from the Trustees of the Estate of the Deceased ▼ Nawab Ikbal-ed-Dowleh to the Vali of Bagdad. Your Excellency, r* ^ h ° are J the 1 tri,stees of the estate of the deceased Nawab Ikbal-ed-Dowleh, a British subject, and who are ourselves British subjects, beg to approach your Excellency With reference to a house belonging to the said estate, situated in the same street as the Bagdad municipality offices but on the opposite side of it, adjoining a house which is the property of Khojah Danus. The front wall belonging to this house was demolished a short time ago at the instance of the municipality, whose engineer had condemned it as dangerous. It was, m. truth, an old wall, and we do not wish to make any retrospective objection with reference to its demolition. v we wish to bring to your Excellency s notice is that the municipality, since the demolition of the wall, have demanded of us the land upon which the wall formerly stood, and also some land which Jay behind it, apparently for the purpose of widening the street. ^ When land is required in such circumstances as these, there are. as your Excellency is awaie, certain formalities prescribed m the Law regarding the Construction and Alignment of Streets of the 22nd August, 1891, which the municipality are bound to observe, and which in the present case they have neglected. Thus, under article 8 of the law quoted, the land required for widening a street must not be taken on one side only, but equally from both sides ; whereas, in the present case, the whole of the land needed is apparently being taken from us and none of it from the proprietors on the opposite side of the street. Again, under ^ article 12 of the same law, we should be given an opportunity of studying the engine, ring plans for the widening of the street, and thirty-one days ought to be allowed us in which to present our objections. Up to the present we have not been shown any plan, and our objections have not been invited or considered. In the third place, under article 18 of the same law, if the municipality require us to construct the front of our buildings on an alignment behind that at which it previously existed, they are bound to carry out the reconstruction of the front at their own expense or to pay us the estimated cost of reconstruction, so that we may carry it out ourselves. These conditions the Bagdad municipality have apparently, in the present case, no intention of fulfilling. \Ve therefore respectfully pray your Excellency to issue such orders to the municipality as will prevent their encroaching on the land of the estate in question without the necessary legal formalities, and such as will ensuie their reconstructing the front of our building—if it should be decided, after the proper legal formalities, to take the land—or paying to us the cost of reconstruction. And your Excellency’s petitioners will ever pray, &amp;c. AGHA MUHAMAD HASAN KHAN. AGHA K HID AH, Enclosure 35 in No. 1. The Vali of Bagdad to Consul-General Lorimer. M. le Consul general, Bagdad, le 20 aout, 1910. J’AI Fhonneur d’accuser reception de vos lettres des 18 et 20 juillet, par lesquelles vous venez m’entretenir d’une demande d assistance qui vous est adressee par un de vos ressortissants au sujet d’une question immobiliere. Yous me demandez en outre de vous remettre une liste de tons les immeubles, appartenant a des sujets britanniques, susceptibles de demolition on d’expropriation, avec la valeur assignee a chaque immeuble par nos experts municipaux. Vous me prier en outre de faire ajourner la demolition eventuelle d’immeubles appartenant a des sujets britanniques jusqu’a ce que votre consulat general ait eu le temps de faire une enquete. Toute penible que la chose me soit, je suis au regret de devoir vous repondre par un refus a tout ce que vous demandez, et cela en vertu des lois en vigueur, qui n’admettent aucune sorte d’intervention dtrangbre dans nos affaires immobilieres. [2930 r —2] ^ GThe widening of (he road will in no way add to the value of the property. Whatever is appropriated from the shop for the road will not be made good to the proprietor by any increase in the value of the remaining portion, because the shop is already small, and, if the area is reduced, its usefulness will be further limited, and ^consequently the value will fall in proportion ; hence, whatever is taken for the road should be rated at a figure which will compensate the proprietor for a fall in the value of his property, and not at the rate given above, which is the value of the property under the existing conditions. Two years ago the shop was rented to Messrs. Abdul Ali Brothers for a term of five years, at £ T. 20 a-year. The rent of the shop is to-day greater. Rent which represents 3 per cent, interest on the cost of the property is considered good here. On this basis the value of the shop is £ T. 666 at the lowest estimation. I understand that the ground now occupied by the shop was originally owned by three persons, and that these were bought out by Mr. Thaddeus at different times at a cost, including law expenses, of about £ T. 290; and Mr. Thaddeus has spent about £ T. 50 on converting the premises into a shop. He values the shop at £ T. l,000 v because he has now been offered a rent of £ T. 35 a-year for it. The condition of the wall on the road is very good, and it will stand many years without needing repairs. There is no question of its being in a condition dangerous to the public. It has no superstructure. F J. CALCOTT GASKIN, Commercial Assistant. Bagdad, August 19, 1910. Enclosure 37 in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Gaskin. I HAVE inspected the house owned by Nawab Muhammad Taki. I found that it has a frontage of about 15f metres and a depth of 6f metres. It is stated that the foundations go down about 5 metres and a^ about U metres thick. The lower 3 metres are built of bricks and mud, costing about G.S.R 5a the cubic metre. ie upper 2 metres are of bricks, ashes, and lime, costing about G.S.P. 70 the cubic metre The wall above the foundation to the first floor is about metres high and 1 metre thick on the average. The lower l^-metres are built of bricks, ashes, and lime costing about G.S.P. 70 per cubic metre; the rest of the wall is of solid bricks and gypsum mortar, costing about G.S.P. 105 the cubic metre. The walls of three sides of the first floor are about 4 metres high and f metre thick, and are built of solid brick and gypsum, also costing about G.S.P. 108 the cu 1G ^ e ^ frr0UT1( p floor at the north end there are a kitchen and a store room; at the south end there is a sardab (residential cellar) with marble floor. , ' On the first floor over the kitchen, &amp;c., there are a room with a snahmshm (proiecting window) and a small room with a kafishkan over it. Over the sardab there is a large room having one side entirely of woodwork and glass, and a shahmshin overloolang Ae^i°ade . g over lfi0 square dhra’s ma’mari, and is worth about 2 Turkish liras the square dhra. ^ T i The house is quite new, having been built only about six or seven years ago. It has been built well and solidly throughout; apparently no expense has been spared; and it would probably last for generations without repairs except to the woodwork.

His Excellency’s action in writing to me at all, even after long delay, on a subject in regard to which he denied the right of a consular officer to intervene, seems inconsistent with his letter to me of the 2nd August, of which a copy has already been forwarded to your Excellency.

The occasion of this letter was a private request made to me on the evening of the 23rd August on a steamer excursion organized by his Excellency the vali, that I should report to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the whole question of interference with the residency had arisen in consequence of a misunderstanding, presumably on my part. As the Government of India will observe, I have been careful to rebut this suggestion, which to me seems to argue a guilty consciousness on the part of the Turkish authorities. Everyone in Bagdad, whether European or native, believes that some sort of coup de main against this residency had been prepared ; and in view of the remarks which have been—and continue to be—made to me by various foreigners and persons in a position to know the real intentions of the Turks, I can only congratulate myself on having brought the matter to notice in time to avert a very disagreeable incident.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 312.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 17, 1910. I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 603 of the 22nd August and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and, further, draw my attention to the number of incidents of political aggression, all tending to a disturbance of the status quo, which have recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf. It will be convenient to deal first with the injustice to which British commercial interests have been subjected. In July the representative of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Bagdad was informed that certain property of his firm would, under a municipal regulation, be demolished as insecure and dangerous. The British Consul-General found that the property, which he took an early opportunity of inspecting, was perfectly safe. A few days later a notification was made to Messrs. Abdul Ali, a British-Indian firm, respecting the projected demolition, on similar grounds, of their principal shop and the arbitrary expropriation of the site, which is a valuable one. This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be in excellent condition and in no wise dangerous. The British Consul-General hereupon visited the President of the Municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public. The conclusion drawn by His Majesty’s Consul-General was that, in the absence of funds to meet the cost of legal expropriation, the procedure complained of had been adopted. Notwithstanding that your Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior, an extensive demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s property, including their chief office, was begun on the 7th August, and more recently His Majesty’s Consul-General has reported that the property of British subjects already demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ T. 5,000; while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at great loss to many British subjects resident in Bagdad. On the 29th September your Excellency reported that British-Indian property at Kazimia and Kerbela had likewise been demolished, and that the Vali had declined any indemnification on grounds which are wholly unconvincing. His Majesty’s Government must emphatically protest against this procedure; they must further, in view of tbe fact that it has originated with the Vali, hold the Ottoman Government themselves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a report as to its precise extent from His Majesty’s Consul-General, your Excellency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropriations, I think it necessary to advert to the rumoured intention of the Vali of Bagdad to cause a new road to be constructed through the middle of the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulate-General, whereas by making a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road : it is true that after your Excellency had made representations to the Sublime Porte, the Vali asserted to His Majesty’s Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: 1 feel constrained to observe that the local evidence to the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable interference with British interests have also recently occurred at Bagdad In the first of these cases Messrs. Abdul Ali, the British-Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual charge: I understand that owing to non-compliance with this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to British Indian subjects. [2930 r—4] H■^■&amp;aBc r satw- In the second case two British firms, Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blaney and Solomon, were informed that they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town, on the pretext of a regulation 46 years old concerning steam- engines and boilers, whereas, as your Excellency has pointed out to me, the factories in question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are in no respect dangerous.^*- There is clearly, therefore, no ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, and its enforcement would be wholly unreasonable and very \ burdensome to the owners. Your Excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accorded to all these British subjects and afford to them the full and effectual protection of His Majesty’s Government, who cannot admit a continuance of the oppression to which they are being subjected. l r ou should add that His Majesty’s Government cannot be expected to acquiesce in the helplessness expressed by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the illegal proceedings of the Bagdad authorities, and that such helplessness on the part of the central authorities amounts to an abdication of Government. I have already furnished your Excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of Public Works in the dispute which has arisen between the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company and the Societe des Quais: it is matter for grave concern to His Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Company should be compelled to complain that “for the past two years'the attitude of the Ministry of Commerce and Public YYorks has been increasingly overbearing and harassing,” and that they should have claimed the active protection oi Ris Majesty’s Government “not only on account of the important material interests involved in the present case, but also in view of the systematic and continuous attempts which are now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and privileges as laid down in its Conventions with the Imperial Ottoman Government.” I pass now to the incidents of political aggression. On the 30th May, 1909, I informed your Excellency that the Turks had some time previously occupied the island of Zakhnuniyeh, which lies some 10 miles south-east of Ujair; that they had hoisted the Turkish flag on a fort, and had arranged to keep a guard there ; that the Sheikh of Bahrein had protested to His Majesty’s Government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he used to keep a garrison, fifty years ago ; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly visited for purposes of fishing, by natives of Bahrein. I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trueial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government: I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. Moreover, as your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. But apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. In these circumstances your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo ; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south-east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction. Although the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed your Excellency that the garrison had been withdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced : and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem set upon disregarding your Excellency’s repeated representations on the subject. I have accordingly to instruct your Excellency to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison. The next point upon which I desire to address your Excellency is the treatmentto which the Sheikh of Koweit has 'been subjected by Suleiman Nazi! Bey, the late Vali of Bussorah, with regard to the property which he purchased, in the course of last year, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of £ T. dS,000 which was duly paid down. When, however, Sheikh Mubarek took steps to register the transfer at the ffurkish Land Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish Subject: such a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made. Your Excellency should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government regard the conduct of the late Vali in this matter as an attempt to modify the status quo with regard to Koweit, which is the basis of the understanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government in this important question. It appears, moreover, from reliable and circumstantial reports, that the late Vali tried by tortuous methods to instigate the vendor of the Fedaghia property to impugn Sheikh Mubarek’s title. The vendor remonstrated with the Vali, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in the face of the title-deeds held by the Sheikh, which, besides the signature of the vendor, bore those of all the Bussorah notables as well as that of the British consul. His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the registration of this property ; they have no wish to raise difficulties with regard to the past conduct of an official who has since been recalled ; but I must add that the incident is vexatious, and serves to deepen the impression entertained by His Majesty’s Government of ill-will on the part of the Turkish officials. In his recent dealings with the Sheikh of Mohammerah the conduct of the late Vali of Bussorah has been in the highest degree violent, vindictive, and unjust. It is known to His Majesty’s Government from reports received from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah that there were no disturbances of importance on the Shat-el-Arab during last winter, that the Sheikh recently exercised his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between the Vali and an important Arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Sheikh has, in fact, carried his conciliatory attitude towards Nazif Bey so far as to acquiesce without complaint in the destruction of houses belonging to him at Bussorah. It is further known through His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh Khazal has endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Such was the situation at the end of March last when the Sheikh and the Vali appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the Vali brought against the Sheikh certain accusations into the nature of which it is unnecessary to enter in detail, since your Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. No serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Sheikh to disprove -the charges brought, against him, which he was perfectly able and willing to do. On the contrary, the Vali totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the Sheikh, expressing the intention of proceeding to Bussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Sheikh’s arrival there on the 18th April, most unjustifiably and discourteously refused to receive him at all. The Sheikh had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah. On the 24th April the £ all issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the Sheikh, and on the 25th April, during the latter’s absence at Ahwaz, the Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris,” acting on the orders of Nazif Bey, shelled the village of Zain belonging to the Sheikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. In the course of this attack the house of the Sheikh s mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment. On the 26th April the Vali, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Consul at Bussorah, went so far as to threaten action against Mohammerah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demands. In spite of the injury and provocation which he had received, Sheikh Khazal continued to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restraining his agents and supporters from any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording &amp; of his communications with the Vali. The latter, on the contrary, displayed strong- resentment at the attempts made by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, under instructions from His Majesty s Government, to promote an understanding between him and the Sheikh.4 Nazif Bey, it is true, finally accepted Sheikh Khazal’s explanations and agreed to consider the incident closed, hut he unconditionally refused to express regret for the death of the Sheikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother’s house, or to pay any compensation for the losses suffered by the Sheikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zam. Furthei, at the very moment when he wat^ considering the Sheikh’s explanations with which he owned himself satisfied, his agents were occupied in subjecting the Sheikh to further petty annoyances in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the 'V ali s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the third time since the dispute between the Sheikh and the ali began, of the former’s house property on the Ashar Creek and of the raid on Mirza Hamza’s house and the seizure of his property, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. there can be little doubt that .Nazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious proceedings. # A further injustice to the Sheikh has now r been committed by the decree recently issued bv the Sublime Porte forbidding the registration of land in tlm vilayet of Bussorah in the name of the Sheikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. m i ^ Your Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the iurkish Government, and inform them that His Majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in the event of a dispute with a foreign Powmr, that they have most carefully considered the circumstances of his recent dispute with the Yali of Bussorah, and can see no justification whatever for the harsh and aggressive action of the latter, especially m the matter of the attack on Zain, nor for the recent decree of the Porte regarding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah. You should add that, in view of their obligations towards the Sheikh, they cannot allow' the status quo on the Shat-el-Arab to be alteied to his detriment, and you should express the hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at with the Sheikh, who has displayed anxiety to live on good terms with his neighbours, and has shown, throughout recent events, great self-restraint and patience, in marked contrast—as His Majesty’s Government observe with regret with the attitude of the Turkish authorities. . These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities, an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. ^ I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint: in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course aiise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.

I also enclose a a copy of a letter which I have received from the Wali, showing that the danger has now been removed. £. A fact not mentioned in any of the telegrams because it did not immediately come to my knowledge, is that Sram Bey, the Wall's political Secretary, himself enquired of a member of my staff, during the period of suspense, whetherwhether there would oe any objection to the new street being carried across the Residency grounds, and what the results of such an arrangement would be. Do this question the officer interrogated not inaptly replied that the amenity of the Residency would be destroyed, and that an increase of the Residency Guard would be necessitated as two compounds would require more sentries to watch them than one, 3. The point chiefly urged by the Political Secretary in his conversation with me, referred to in my telegram of the See Annexure lo. 8. ] 22nd August, was that I should have addressed myself to him, if I thought that the Residency was in danger, and not to the Turkish Engineer of Works, This seems at first sight a plausible objection; but, as explained in my last letter, the object of the local Government was probably to force me to begin, on humiliating terms, a discussion with them of the immunities and privileges of this Residency, - a discussion which might have acquired a wider scope as it proceeded. For this reason, instead of referring to the Political Secretary, I gave the Engineer of Works, with whom I am personally acquainted, a sufficient opportunity of contradicting, either directly or through the Wall's Political Office/, the sinister rumours which, if he did not himself set them afloat, he at least knew to be current and to* to be generally believed. It will be seen that my note to the Engineer was worded in such a way as neither to give offence to Turkish susceptibilities nor to admit any anxiety on my part on account of the Residency. I trust that my action throughout this matter, which now appears closed, may be approved by the Government of India and by His majesty’s Government. I have, etc., Sd/** J. G.

Purport of a telegram from the Political Resident, Baghdad, to the Sovernmeat of India in the Foreign Beaprt- ment, dated 16th August, 1910. The Wali of Baghdad is believed to have the intention of continuing, through the compound of the British Residency, a public street which is now In process of construction. The buildings of this Residency would thereby be separated from one another, and the subdivision of the prorjerty would much diminish its market value; and it would* besides, be an act of wantonness on the Wali f s part. Already there exists a road which could be widened. This apprehended action of the Local Government would be manifestly malicious in intention, and carried through with a political purpose. The Consul General wired to the Ambassador, whose reply was that he would see to the matter in Constantinople and deprecate the alleged intention to interfere with the Residency grounds. The Consul General is strongly of opinion that our credit in Baghdad depends upon our offering uncompromising resistance to any such project and requests that, if the Government of India are of that opinion, they will immediately communicate with the British Government, as otherwiseotherwise it my be too late to do anything. I Annexure Uo. 2. : urport of a telegram from H. B. 1 s Consul General, Baghdad, to H* 3* k’s Amhassador, Constantinople, dated 17th August 1910. Kefers to the Ambassador’s wire of August 16th and states that the intention of the local authorities in the / matter of the threatened encroachment on the grounds of the British Residency is purely political and malicious. By taking steps to interfere with the Resio ency the Local Government would show to what extent foreigners and foreign interests are in their power. It is not a (question of surrendering a portion of the grounds to enable the Municipality to carry out projected improvements, but of yielding to the early avowed policy of the Wall of forcibly reducing the status of the British Consulate General: also, by permitting subdivision of the grounds, a valuable government property would be much depreciated in value To deprecate interference might only embolden the Turks to carry out a project over which they were hesitating, and the Consul General is therefore of opinion that the case isis one for absolute prohibition, Mr. Loriiner has wired to the Government of India explaining to them the position of affairs, because they are jointly interested with His Majesty’s Government in the Baghdad Besidency. He would repeat once more, that there is no reason at all for continuing the new street further than the place where it will reach the wall of the Besidency garden. Annexure Ho. 3 .

Jestrongly expressed. In despatches which have been sent hy post the Ambassador will find the Consul Generali * reasons for questioning the truthfulness sincerity of these belated assurances. The Consul General, however, has not challenged their truth, but in receiving them he remarked that the circumstances which led him to take action were certainly calculated to inspire doubt. The Consul General has promised the Wall 1 s political Secretary, that though the question of the residency wall was still exciting the town, and though only last Saturday a crowd collected to look at it in expectation of its being pulled down, he would observe a discreet silence on the subject of what had passed. It cannot be questioned that the Turkish officials knew perfectly well what was expected by the populace and did nothing to dispel the idea. The recent unceremonioitf treatment of the reman comiiru nity and the fact that the Turkish Engineer of T ?orks, with whom he was personally acquainted, neither replied to nis letter himself nor caused a reply to be sent to it through the proper office, are the principal grounds on which the Consul General entertained suspicions. In the Consul Generali opinion H. 3. the Ambassador^ action at Constantinople has had a most salutarysalutary effect in maintaining British prestige at Baghdad, and it may even assist the solution of certain other difficulties outstanding locally.oS&gt; Confidential . | Sent to Embassy Constantinople . k lo. 772 of 1910.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 736/37.) Your Excellency, _ Bagdad, August 22, 1910. I HAVE the honour to enclose free translations of a pamphlet and a placard, which have made their appearance at Bagdad during the last few days, and which illustrate the bitter hostility with which the rule of Nazim Pasha, the present Governor- General, is regarded in some quarters here. The pamphlet was undoubtedly written at Bagdad and printed at Cairo. It arrived at Bagdad by the last overland mail, and it has been widely circulated. Attempts are being made by the police to trace all the persons to whom copies were addressed. The authorship is, of course, a matter of conjecture. It is strongly suspected that ’Abdul Hasih Antaki Bey, an Egyptian journalist recently expelled by Nazim Pasha, was concerned in its production (see monthly Summary for June 1910, XII, 1), and such may be the case, but from internal evidence it appears to be, in all essential respects, the work of local malcontents. Unfortunately, it contains more than a substratum of truth, especially in the sections which relate to arbitrary municipal improvements at Bagdad. Some of the personal touches are ludicrously life-like. The scurrilous placard which forms the second enclosure of this letter was posted up during the night of the 17th-18th August on the walls of the city near the north gate, and in the Hidan quarter. Some fifteen or sixteen copies are said to have existed, but they were quickly taken possession of by the police. None were found in the sheikh quarter, where the influence of the Nakib is supreme. Arrests have already been made in connection with the incident, and Nazim Pasha, with characteristic courage, would have caused the placard to be reprinted verbatim in all the newspapers had he not been dissuaded by cooler-headed advisers. So far as I am aware, the allegations made in the placard are altogether malicious and unfounded. Nazim Pasha has not yet been four months in power at Bagdad, and it is impos sible to regard without concern the undoubtedly serious opposition to his rule which has already been called into existence. There can be no doubt, I think that the prime instigators of resistance are the local representatives of the Committee of Union and Progress, and the vali evidently regards one of these—the late Maktubji Murad Bey, a half-brother of Mahmud Shaukat Pasha, Minister of War—as his most dangerous enemy at Bagdad (see monthly Summary for June 1910, Y, 12). The difficulty by which observers of the situation are confronted is the same as they experienced in connection with the “ aflaire Lynch ” last December, that, namely, of knowing to what extent the agitation is genuine and what proportion of the population is involved in or sympathises with it. There has been much to find fault with in Nazim Pasha’s municipal government and in his treatment of foreign subjects, and British interests have suffered along with the rest; but his errors have been largely due, I believe, to inexperience of civil administration and to a mistaken belief, of which he must soon be cured, that there is no obstacle which cannot be removed by force. His military and tribal policies, as I have already had the honour of reporting to your Excellency (see monthly Summary [2901 cc—1] B2 for June 1910, V, 11), appear at least to promise well. If Nazim Pasha should be displaced without a fair trial, in consequence of the machinations of his enemies, this very fact will go far, it is to be feared, towards postponing the establishment of a stable administration m this country \ for his successoi s position will lie moie difficult e\en than his own was in the beginning, and the door will be permanently opened to all sorts of party intrigues and abuses. nn My principal object in writing this is to inform your Excellency that, though as British consul-general I have had grave cause to complain of more than one of Nazim Pasha’s official acts, I by no means consider the downfall of his administration desirable or expect that it would be succeeded by a better one. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LOBIMER, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Annexure (A). Irak. A memorandum presented to His Majesty Sultan Mohammed Bash ad Khan V (may he long live); to the Bight Honourable Hakki Pasha, the Prime Minister ; to all the members of his Cabinet; to the Senate and Parliament; and to all Ottomans. To the whole Arabic press in Egypt, Syria, Tunis, America, and Constantinople; to all those who pronounce the letter “dhad” correctly (i.e., to all Arabs) ; and particularly to his Excellency Mahmud Shaukat Pasha, the victor of Constantinople, who is a native of Irak. To His Majesty the Khalif, the aristocracy, and all our brethren according to the Constitution. Men of tender sympathy and intelligence, is there any help for the people of Irak now that matters have reached a climax ? A Nazim'' (“ reformer ”) has come to us who, by his efforts, is not likely to improve our condition, but rather to make us to shrink or revolt. It need hardly be said that Irak is a country to which the attention of all Ottomans is directed, owing to the fertility of the land and the numerous rivers that run in it, and which, if properly looked after, could be made like the Garden of Eden where God created Adam. In the time of the Ahbasite dynasty Irak attained to the highest pitch of civilisation, education, and industry, and had no equal in any respect. This is a fact well known to all those who have a knowledge of history. But when the Abhasite dynasty w x as abolished, the schools were closed, the arts were neglected, and everything deteriorated. At last Irak was reduced to such a pitiful condition that it occasioned grief to all its well-wishers and joy to all its enemies; and it continued in that state until the time when the constitution was proclaimed, the reactionary Sultan was dethroned, and all his subordinates were degraded. Then we praised Almighty God and looked to the Committee of Union and Progress, w T hich had taken the reins of administration into their hands. When the events mentioned above took place, we all expected that Irak would attain its former prosperous condition, especially when the services of Sir William Willcocks, the renowned English engineer, were secured. All the world was eagerly watching to see the progress which Irak would make, and how it would be turned into a land more fertile than Egypt. Lynch Company Amalgamation. We were all lost in these dreams when his Excellency Hilmi Pasha, the late Prime Minister, made an agreement to give over the Hamidieh steamers, which ply between Bussorah and Bagdad, to Lynch and Co., giving the monopoly of navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates from Bussorah to Maskanah, near Aleppo, to the said company. Hilmi Pasha’s action was due to ignorance of a danger which this amalgamation would have created—one which perhaps might prove an even severer calamity to the nation than the concession for a German railway to Bagdad. One of these two calamities, if not both, we may perhaps suffer sooner or later. As we, the inhabitants of Irak, were proud of our Ottoman citizenship and jealous * The narae Nazim happens to mean “ one who sets in order.” «A ?! 1 4 °V f° f the 2 tt l 0man ^ m P ire 5 bem ^ assured that it is through the existence of the latter that our Mahommedan religion is maintained and flourishes, some of us, mhabitants of Bagdad, immediately raised our voices and began to communicate with Constantinople by telegram, bringing to the notice of the authorities there the political and moral drawbacks of the amalgamation ; so much so that Hilmi Pasha resigned, and f we were informed that the amalgamation had been cancelled. This was in order to calm the people until Nazim Pasha could be sent out to bring us all under his sway by depriving us of oui freedom, and then notify us of the amalgamation. Who is Nazim Pasha f It was then that Nazim Pasha was appointed vah of our vilayet, commander-in chief of the Vlth Army Corps, and “ reformer ” of Irak, including the vilayets of Musal, Bagdad, and Bussorah. We were pleased at this appointment, more especially as the word reform sounded pleasant in our ears, and made us forget the last post which Nazim Pasha held when Abdul Hamid, in conjunction with Kamil Pasha, tried on the 31st March to overthrow the constitution and the Committee of Union and Progress. No better man could be found for the appointment than our “ reformer,” the supporter of the constitution, &amp;e. He was made Minister of War without the sanction of Parliament, and there followed the overthrow of Kamil Pasha’s Cabinet and of the arch-autocrat Abdul Hamid, the circumstances of which are already known and require no repetition. Yes; the people of Irak forgot—or, rather, feigned to forget—Nazim Pasha as an autocrat. They looked at the brighter side of things, and as he came as a “ reformer” they expected some good of him, and they awaited his arrival as anxiously as a good Mahommedan keeping the fast awaits the appearance of the new moon. At last his Excellency arrived with a large staff of officers, &amp;c., and a magnificent reception was given to him. The people received and treated the Pasha with great respect, not because they were cowards and dreaded him, but because they did not want to interfere with his work of reform. They felt that if they interfered he would oppress the people as a preparation for justifying his shortcomings before Parliament when the time came for him to give an account of all his dealings in Irak to the nation—which time, we hope, is not far off. The new Nazim (“reformer”) arrived in Bagdad grave and self-confident. He began to make the reforms, of which mention is made hereafter, without consulting anyone. On the day of his arrival, when he entered Bagdad, in order to show his strength and influence, he refused to receive any of the notables who came to visit him. The first time that he presided over the Administrative Council he asked the clerk to read all the papers to him, and all the time he kept nodding his head as if he knew all the conditions of the vilayet by divine prescience. All the members were treated like pieces of wood, he never consulted them ; and when any members ventured to object he cried out, “ It is settled.” A further proof of his self-confidence is the fact that, after according Suleiman Nazif Bey (the Yali of Bussorah) an enthusiastic reception on his arrival at Bagdad, he did not listen to him or ever agree to his suggestions, although Suleiman Nazif Bey was in Irak before Nazim Pasha and had more experience in its affairs. Finally they could not agree, and Suleiman Nazif Bey returned to Bussorah. This disagreement gradually assumed a bitter form, and it has turned into an enmity which exposes the two vilayets to grave danger. We do not wish to enter into more details about the autocratic disposition of Nazim Pasha, but we give below some of his reforms which may serve as a sufficient proof of his having been born an autocrat. Reforms of Nazim Pasha. 1. Suppression of the Arabic Language. The first reforming order which Nazim Pasha issued was that no petition or document should be submitted to Government at Bagdad or its dependencies in Arabic, and that if such documents were submitted, they should not be taken into consideration. He issued this order in the official newspaper “ Zaurah. Ihe people of Bagdad were thunderstruck at this order, for they knew that most of them did not understandTurkish, and that, if they obeyed the order, their business would be delayed and their rights violated. When it was proposed in the Constantinople press that the language of the Kuran should be made official like the Turkish language, the press at Bagdad kept silent about Nazim Pasha’s arbitrary order for fear of him. It was only the “ Itakib,” of which the editor^ (Abdul Latif Thinaiyan) is well known for his liberal ideas, that dared to criticise this Nazim’s {“ reformer’s ”) reform which was contrary to common sense. He did so in a couple 01 well-chosen lines which caused Nazim Pasha to send him this message : “ If you mean to criticise me personally, I will excuse you ; but if you intend to criticise the action of the Government, I will break your neck.’ The editor was greatly alarmed by Nazims fuiy and the official message. He became sensible that there was no freedom of the press, as provided hr the constitution ; and henceforward he began to burn the incense of false eulogies before the said vali. By this action Nazim Pasha gave the first blow to the constitution in Irak. It is one of the principal articles of the constitution that the press should be free. The press being the mouth-piece of the people, it is through the press that the Government hears of the grievances, &amp;c., of its subjects and is enabled to take steps for remedying them and for improving the condition of the people. Freedom of the press, which has wrought wonders m other countries, Y»as confenecl by a law passed in both Houses of Parliament after the establishment of the constitution by the sword;, and it therefore cannot be violated by any person, however exalted his position. The same inviolable law also permits any person to criticise the acuion of any administrative official or officials, on condition of his criticism being impersonal and well founded consequently Abdul Latif Effendi Thinaiyan was right in his criticism and ought not to have been interfered with by Nazim Pasha. Now may not Thinaiyan call Nazim Pasha despotic ? The pasha has an adminis trative council, but he does not consult them. He prevents the submission of any document in Arabic. He gives orders, accompanied by threats, to paint the shops. He opiens a wide street by pulling down houses, shops, &amp;c., by force, without paying compensation for the ground ; and he thus causes great loss to the people. All of tliese facts he, Thinaiyan, may criticise freely ; but he may not say that Nazim Pasha drinks at night, even if he does drink ; and he may not say that Nazim Pasha omits to pray three times a-day, even if the pasha never prays. These are personal matters, and do not concern the public. cannot suppose that Nazim Pasha, in issuing his orders to Thinaiyan, ignored the constitution; we can only think that he is an enemy of the constitution. We may frankly state that all the newspapers at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Musal are now conducted under the supervision of the local Government; that the editors cry with wide-open mouths that they are not free; and that Nazim Pasha and his subordinates threaten them with punishment in case they should dare to write against him. 2. Painting of Shops. Nazim Pasha next ordered the outside of the shops and bazaars in Bagdad to be painted ; and he threatened the people with heavy punishment unless they conformed with this beneficial order. The editor of the “ Bakib ” wrote in one of its issues an article cancelling one that had appeared before it. This was the purport: “The city of Mansur and Harun-ar-Bashid has put on its gala clothes, according to the orders of Nazim Pasha. The labourers being mostly outlaw’s, vagabonds, and pickpockets, the city is relieved of them.” Is this not ridiculous? Are you not ashamed ol it, Abdul Latif Effendi'? We are not aware whether our friend Abdul Latif Effendi Thinaiyan wrote his article with sarcastic intent, or whether he honestly meant what he said ? We only know that he wmote it at the time when we enjoy constitutional government, and^ that he published it under the auspices of Nazim. We are divided into two parties in opinion. Some of us think that Nazim has ordered the “ Nakib ” to make fun of the people of Irak. Others say that Abdul Latif Effendi wrote this article in order to put the wisdom of the people to the test, and to show them that there is no freedom of the press in Bagdad, and that Nazim Pasha only likes those who praise him whether he is right or wrong. # . Painting such as that in question is only an external decoration, and it is quite uncalled for, more especially as it is not lasting, and the shops’ fronts will soon be reduced to their former state. When the painting of Bagdad is all over where will the bad characters be employed? It would be a good plan if Nazim Pasha were to order—^-rr^r?—: 'tr ■ . —'--^^SSS 5 the painting and whitewashing of the insides of houses, which might thus in the end escape being demolished, and would create more work for the bad characters, so getting them out of the way and completing the reform of Irak. 3. Making Wide Streets in Bagdad. The reforms mentioned above are nothing in comparison with another great improvement which the wise Nazim (“ reformer”) has ordered. He saw that the streets were very narrow and old-fashioned, and not sufficiently wide for his carriage to pass. He has directed the opening out of wide streets, 20 metres broad, and he has asked for sanction to spend XT. 100,000 on the work, whereas, if he intended to treat the houseowners fairly, he ought to have applied for £T. 2,000,000. In spite of the complaints of the people he has begun to put his plans into execution. A member of the committee informed Nazim Pasha that the inhabitants of Bagdad were all grumbling at having their houses pulled down, and suggested that a site should be chosen outside the town where a new town could be built according to the latest system, as at Aleppo and Damascus. What do you think his Excellency said? He said in a sarcastic tone, “ If you go against my will, you had better not attend a committee meeting again.” Is this not ridiculous ? As an example of the hypocrisy of some of us ; a few notables, whose names we do not think it right to mention, went to the vali, Nazim Pasha, and volunteered to forego compensation for their houses which were to be taken for the streets. They aimed by their action at securing the goodwill of the vali. Thank God, there are still some amongst us who consider the favour of the vali as the grace of God. This is due to their ignorance of constitutional principles, under which valis and judges are merely automata in the hands of the law. Those who have offered their houses free and voluntarily contributed to the vali’s plan lose nothing, for they are well-off; but they cause a large number of poor people to lose their residences and houses in the abyss which Nazim has opened. The rich lose nothing, because their houses are large enough to spare a portion for this road, together with a likelihood of getting double price for the rest; but the poor will be crushed. No one can properly appreciate the calamity which has befallen the poor people of Bagdad through the unwise policy of Nazim except those who have visited it and have seen the poverty of the inhabitants. Whoever visits Bagdad now will find all its inhabitants plunged in mourning and grief on account of the actions of this Nazim (“reformer”), which are quite unprecedented. Midhat Pasha, the hero of the constitution, did about thirty-six years ago make a plan for a road to be cut through the middle of the town ; but, when he saw that he would cause great loss to the inhabitants by it, he did not feel justified in carrying it out and ultimately abandoned it. About ten valis succeeded him, among whom there were wise and ignorant, good, and bad men ; but none of them dreamt of such an injustice, except Nazim Pasha who was sent here as a reformer. We have thought over the question carefully, but we cannot see that it is of any benefit to the inhabitants in general. If by opening a main street it is intended to make the city look better externally, we say that it would be better to improve the personal condition of the inhabitants first. If it is with the view of allowing plenty of room for carriage traffic, we reply that the people of Bagdad are too poor to afford carriages now, and that, when they grow rich, thanks to Nazim Pasha’s reforms, it will be time enough to take measures to widen the streets. Besides all this, the expenses of making the street will be a burden on the municipality of Bagdad ; and the municipality will spend all its income in merely paying the interest on the money, and will not be able to spare anything for improvement of the town. Lord Cromer, the great reformer of Egypt, has said “ It is not right on the part of a Govern ment to spend borrowed money upon enterprises which bring in no revenue. Govern ments should devote the proceeds of loans to productive works so that by means of the profits they can pay off both capital and interest. Will not Naznn (the reformer) take into consideration and respect this important principle of economy ? It is not necessary to point out to Nazim Pasha that the whitewashing of shops and bazaars and the widening of streets are not any part of the reforms that he was sent here to carry out; they are external improvements which can be made afterwards. He ought first to give his attention to agriculture ; and the £ T. 200,000 which he is going to borrow in the name of the municipality had much better be spent on the improvement of arts, agriculture, and industry. As we have said above, it is hardly worth pointing this out to him, as he is despotic in his views. 04. The Arab Questions. His fourth reform has been to obtain “ fatwas ” from eminent doctors of the sacred law declaring that, according to the law, it is necessary to punish the Arabs who fight with each other, and plunder one another’s property, and disturb the public security in the country. He summoned some of the chiefs and sheikhs of the Arabs to his presence and threatened them, and then sent them back to their homes. Indeed, a military man of limited brains like Nazim Pasha could not do otherwise. If he had been a wise man he would have questioned the chiefs as to the cause of the fighting, and would have thought of some means of preventing it, like a good physician who first questions the patient, examines him, finds out about his case, and then gives medicine. Nazim asked the Sunni and Sai’ah doctors to give the “fatwa” in question condemning the wars of the Arabs, and it is said that valid “ fatwas ” have been given. Was there not any doctor of them all, with Arab blood in his veins, who could dare to say to Nazim: “We give you these ‘fatwas’ against fighting on the understanding that you yourself will keep the fear of God before your eyes in your dealing with the Arabs ? ” Nazim Pasha has also asked the Arab chiefs to pay the Government taxes. He did not ask them whether these taxes were levied justly or not ; he did not ask them about their cultivation and their harvests. Is this how reformers act ? Nazim Pasha does not know everything. He is a military man, and has given his orders to the Arabs to keep quiet. That is all he could do, and now he is watching to see that his instructions are carried out. If he remains as vali in this vilayet and continues to carry out his (?) thorough-going ideas, he will, no doubt, resort to armed force in order to collect money from the poor people, and the vilayet will again assume the aspect which it wore under the old regime. There will be fighting, and Mahommedan blood will be shed, the public safety will be disturbed, and the little which we have will be destroyed. Nazim has also ordered the Arabs to collect their rifles and hand them over to him. This order is quite impossible of execution, for Nazim did not explain to the Arabs the reasons for the order, and did not guarantee to protect them if they handed over their arms and were afterwards attacked by .other Arabs, &amp;c. He does not enquire from the Arabs the reasons of their mutual fighting and plundering, so that he may endeavour to remove the causes of disturbance and so diffuse peace and security among the tribes. If he did so he would be within his rights in ordering the collection of arms; and the Arabs would hand them over, because they would no longer need them. The Arab is intelligent enough to understand the cunning of Nazim ; and, moreover, the Arab requires weapons to defend himself against tribal aggressions and to fight with Nazim Pasha’s men who come to collect taxes. We are not prophets, but we judge of things by common sense. Governments which do not look after the prosperity of their people and allow for differences in religion and race cannot expect large revenues. A cow must be fed well in order to give good milk. In the time of Abdul Hamid the former valis, when fighting with these poor Arabs, used to lead Abdul Hamid and his advisers to believe that the Arabs intended to recover the Khalifate for Arabia, and that they were fighting them for this reason. Now, if Nazim Pasha does not change his policy, but fights with the Arabs, he will tell Constantinople just the same thing as his predecessors did. As a matter of fact the Arabs have no such ideas as those ascribed to them. They are sure that the Khalifate is in safe hands with the Turks, notwithstanding that the Turks treat the Arabs with suspicion. 5. Removal of Arab Officers, The fifth of Nazim Pasha’s reforms consists in the removal from the YIth Army Corps of all Arab officers—some by placing them on the retired list and others by sending them to remote places—and their replacement by Turkish officers. Wise men amongst us took this as a sign of his bad intentions, or at least as a hint to the Arabs that he was their enemy ; notwithstanding that the Arabs, since the establishment of the constitution, have considered themselves the equals of their brethren the Turks in all civil rights, among which is employment in Government service. By Nazim’s action bitter feeling has been renewed in the breasts of the Arabs, also hatred of the Turks, in spite of the allegiance which they show to the Government. What our xkrab officers have done in order to meet with this sad fate we cannot understand. Nazim has notSSS S k .SZI‘, h ” A “ k *- ” lr; h * &gt; ■ ' *'» , . opmion varies as to the cause of the removal of the Arab officers. Some think that the Government intends to make Irak, subdued by Turkish soldiers, into ^ Turkey ; others believe that Nazim Pasha wishes to show the power of the Government Sm Irak before announcing to its people that the Hamidieh line has been handed over to Lynch ; others hold that, he being a military man, the idea has struck him of crushing the Arabs by military force. We ourselves refrain from expressing an opinion • but we offer the above conjectures to his Excellency so that he may take the best of them and adopt it as his justification We only say that we, the people of Irak, are most loyal to our Government and Khahfate, and that we cannot understand why our brethren the Turks should suspect us. If our combined demonstration against the Lynch Company amalgamation frightened them and made them change their opinion, we would explain that 0111 action was not taken for personal causes, but with a view to protectum the dominions of the Turkish Government. We should like them to explain the real cause to us ? in 01 dci t licit m 6 may immediately abstain from offering 1 any opposition to their views. We advise our Government at Constantinople not to wink at arbitrary actions which maj, lead to bad results, but to treat us as their equals according to the constitution, so chat we can co-operate with them in upholding the glory of Islam and of the Ottoman Khalifate. Nazim s oppressions cannot crush or kill us, whatever he and his subordinates may think, but they will cause our rich land and our strong men to be lost to the Govern ment. We do not think that the Government will lose sight of the selfishness of foreigners or how they seek a good opportunity to swallow us ; nor do we think them oblivious of the fact that not all the Turkish element are faithful to the Ottoman throne. 6. Sir William Willcocks and his Staff. Nazim’s sixth reform was that he wrote to Constantinople to recall Sir William Y\ illcocks ano. his staff from Iiak. Apparently he wishes to impede irrigation work. By acting as he recommends the Government would lose £ T. 30,000, °the amount already spent by the engineers on surveys, &amp;c., and the nation would he bereft of one of its best hopes. Perhaps Nazim wall say that Willcocks is not capable of carrying out the work and that is why he dismisses him. If this is the real cause, why does the vali not make it known, and why does he not say how he will arrange for the irrigation projects for which our constitutional Government sent out Willcocks? Why does he not call a meeting and take the opinion of the wise people of Bagdad before dispensing with Willcocks’s services ? One of the principal articles of the constitution is that a governor should not act on his own account but in harmony with his council, even if he is as wise as Solomon and Lokman, as strong as Alexander the Great, as eloquent as Subhan, as brave as Antar, as sagacious as Ayas, and as shrewd as Mu’awiyan and Ibn-al-As. If the Imperial Government have sent Nazim Pasha to introduce reforms, thev have made a mistake ; but, if they have sent him to exercise oppression, that is quite a different matter, one which is inadmissible, and one which neither our constitutional form of Government nor our Arab descent, not Ottoman unity, will tolerate. Conclusion. We meant at first to seek the assistance of the Bagdad press in presenting this our complaint to the heads of the State, but Nazim permits no freedom, and ao-ain we reflected that, if we telegraphed it to Constantinople, he would intercept it, We therefore, the doctors and wise men of Bagdad, held a meeting, secretly composed this pamphlet, and sent it to Egypt to be printed and distributed. Be it known to all Ottomans that we do not wish to be anything but Ottomans, or anything but constitutionalists. We say this in order that alarmists may not accuse us of being reactionaries. In confirmation whereof we hereby curse all reactionaries, saying : “ Damned be all who advocate the re-establishment of the era of Abdul Hamid ; the curse of God and his Prophets be upon all despots, past, present, and future ; the curse of God and his angels rest on those who make distinctions between the races comprising the Ottoman Umpire ! ” In conclusion, be it known to all Ministers, members of Parliament and notables, and to the press, that we are most loyal supporters of Ottoman unity, and that we8 pray for the long continuance of the Ottoman dynasty. ^ But, if justice is not done and our complaint is not heard, we will, with the assistance of the Committee of Union and Progress who overthrew the throne of Abdul Hamid, the arch-autocraf overthrow the throne of Nazim Pasha; for we all hate despotism, and have sworn to fight it. We do not think that there are any left amongst us who would consent to undergo further oppression after the thirty-five years’ cruel reign of Abdul Hamid. \Y e deem it a duty to mention here the name of our brethren at Musal, who are sharers with us in subjection to Nazim’s tyranny, on account of the manner in which they have co-operated with us m upholding the Constitution. ' As for our brethren at Bussorah, they are discontented like ourselves; but they have centred their hopes in their vali, and they expect that he will combat Nazims despotism. We wish them success; but, supposing their vali is able to_ stop Nazim’s interference in the civil administration of Bussorah, how can he stop his interference as Commander-in-chief of the forces? We invite them, however, to unite with us in protecting the life of Irak and the rights of its people, in order that it may exist forever as a worthy member of the Ottoman Empire and minister to the glory of Islam. We request our Arab contemporaries in Egypt, Syria, America, Tunis, and Constantinople to reproduce this pamphlet in their valuable columns, and thus to assist us in bringing the facts to the notice of our statesmen at Constantinople, &amp;c.

To this question the officer interrogated not inaptly replied that the amenity of the residency would be destroyed, and that an increase of the residency guard would be necessitated, as two compounds would require more sentries to watch them than one. 1 3. The point chiefly urged by the political secretary in his conversation with me referred to m my telegram of the 22nd August,]: was that I should have addressed myseit to him it 1 thought that the residency was in danger, and not to the Turkish engineer of works. This seems at first sight a plausible objection ; but, as explained m my last letter, the object of the Local Government was probably to force me to begin on humiliating terms a discussion with them of the immunities and privileo’es of tins residency a discussion which might have acquired a wider scope as it proceeded lor this reason, instead of referring to the political secretary, I gave the engineer of works, with whom I am personally acquainted, a sufficient opportunity of contradictino- T\f ie;r Erectly or through the vali’s political office, the sinister rumours, which, if he did not himself set them afloat, he at least knew to be current and to be generally believed. It will be seen that my note to the engineer was worded in such a way as neither to give offence to Turkish susceptibilities nor to admit any anxiety on my Dart on account of the residency. . 3. I trust that my action throughout this matter, which now appears closed may be approved by the Government of India and by His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c. J. G.

I have renewed my protest at the Porte to-day, and fresh instructions have been sent, but I expect that they will be as unavailing as those that have preceded them. —~~~- - - CONFIDENTIAL. \\ 14 \ * 4 Q Summary of Events in Turkish ’Iraq during the month of June 1910. I.— Musal Wilayat. (1) It is reported that at the beginning of May the village of Meriz in the Qadha of ’Aqrah was attacked and burned * See last Summary, 1.1. adherents of the Shaikh* of Baraizan in retaliation for the desertion of the Shaikh’s cause by Ismail Agha, the owner. This man, who recently went over to the enemies of the Shaikh, is said to have been killed in the afiair along with some of his family. Towards the end of May, Lieutenant-Colonel Sufat Bey, a military officer, arrived at Musal from Baghdad and proceeded at once to Aqrah apparently on a political mission from Nazim Pasha, the new Wall of Baghdad, to the Baraizan Shaikh Towards the middle of June it began to be rumoured at Musal that the Shaikh would be pardoned by the Turkish Government, and even that he would be placed in official charge of Zibar, the district in which his possessions are situated. It is asserted in a letter received by the last post from Musal that the Shaikh’s followers have already given up their arms. On the 12th of May 80 mules and horses, and on the 30th of May 150 mules, were sent by the military authorities from Musal to ’Aqrah It would not be surprising if this should prove to have been a step towards the withdrawal of the F ® garrisons of Aqrah, Bin Kaprah, and t See present Summary, V, ion. Baraizan; for Nazimf Pasha's policy in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilavats so far has been to recall troops to headquarters, write off the Government claims against tribal offenders, and start again with a clean slate.

(3) Subsequently to the affairs§ of the 25th and 30th April, probably about T . the middle of May, a fresh outrage was com- § See last Summary, I, 2. by ^ in the Kirkuk- Sulaimaniyah district, where they captured a caravan, killing 4 gendarmes, capturing 14 others with their arms and ammunition and taking prisoner Saiyid Abdullah, the ex-Mustantiq of Sulaimaniyah. The Mutasarrif of Kirkuk, a very active official, immediately levied 300 men of the better-disposed tribes in his Sanjaq, whom he clothed in gendarmerie uniform and supplied with Government rifles and ammunition. These levies were placed under some of their own tribal chiefs, iiz., Muhmmad Karim Agha and 'Aziz Jasim Agha of the Zanganah, with the rank of captain and lieutenant respectively; Muhi-ud-Din Agha of the Sadat, with the rank of cap tain - Abbas Agha of the Pishdar, with the rank of captain; and Saiyid Muhammad Agha of the Jabbari, with the rank of lieutenant. Nazim Pasha, as civil Governor-General and Commandant of the 6th Army Corps, also acted with his usual energy. The Wali Commandant of Musal was ordered to despatch as many troops to Kirkuk as possible to keep ccnmunica- tions open; Yusuf Pasha and Muhi-ud-Din Pasha, who had just returned from the Muntafik campaign, were sent to Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah to resume their former commands; and martial law was proclaimed at Sulaimaniyah. Early in June, 280 men of the 20th (Cavalry) Kegiment had left Musal for Kirkuk mounted on mules. Before this, 40 local gendarmerie mounted on mules and 100 local infantry had been sent to Baziyan (also called Baziran) apparently in pursuit of the raiders. Nevertheless, about the 5th or 6th of June, some villages and crops were destroyed by the Hamawand; and a few days later news reached Musal that Chamchamal was practically blockaded by them. C 584 ET&gt;2 On the 9th of June Nazim Pasha himself informed me that sufficient measures had been taken to ensure tranquillity for the future ; but it is known that on the next day some Sulaimaniyah merchants telegraphed to their correspondents at Baghdad not to send them any goods by caravan as the Hama wand were threaten ing the roads. On the 10th of June, Lieutenant-Colonel Faizi Bey, President of the Court-martial established at Sulaimaniyah, notified Nazim Pasha by tele gram of the execution of Nadir, son of Qadir, alias “ Tallai Pak/’ a Hama wand chief, by hanging. It is said that the Hama wand prisoners at Sulaimaniyah will be transferred to Baghdad. (4) Some crops near Tall ’Afar were • See Summary for February 1910, I, 3. damped ™ ^ J»ne by Arab raiders under the Shammar* Shaikhs ’A si and Shallal. (5) On the 12th of June, at the British Vice-Consulate at Musal, the' Wali, under orders from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed his regret for the violationf of Mr. Bassam’s house, t See last Summary, , 3. which to the last, however, he continued' to protest had been accidental. Mr. Greig sent for Mr. Rassam and informed him in the Wall’s presence of what had been said ; and the matter, accordingly, appears to be at an end. &gt; v \ (6) Two Nestorian representatives specially sent to Musal for the purpose, who at the beginning of June had been there since about two months, had up to that time been unsucqessful, on account of difficulties raised by the local Turkish authorities, in obtaining separate registration of the converts from Chaldean t See Summary for February 1910 , 1, 4.

During my stay at Musal (8th to 16th May) Mar Yau Allaha, the Nestorian Bishop of the Amadiyah diocese, suddenly arrived at Musal and most inexpe diently quartered himself upon Mr. Rassam, the honorary Dragoman of the British Vice-Consulate: means were found, however, of inducing him to remove to another abode. The object of his visit to Musal was to defend on appeal a decree ^ of the Amadiyah Civil Court, whereby possession of the church of Mar Odish in the village of Dauri was adjudged to the Nestorians as against the Chal dean Catholics. This he did with success, and by the 3rd June he had left Musal. (7) Muhammad Fazil Pasha, late[| Wali of Musal, has apparently been per il See last Summary, I. 6. t0 r .f^ n b ° th hi ?

The Tabur-Aghasi of Karbala, who was sent to investigate by the Mutasarrif, arrested nine men of the Mas’ud and Zumailat tribes on suspicion. This was not an ordinary robbery ; no property was taken. The motive is suspected to have been enmity against the coachman or against one of the owners of the vehicle.(3) The Mutasarrif of Karbala, carried away by the rumours of intended municipal improvements at Baghdad, has embarked on a general widening of .existing lanes and opening up of new streets at his headquarters. In the Arab bazaar the changes are being carried out with a high hand; but in a Persian quarter, where like proceedings were attempted, they have been brought to a standstill by signs of influential opposition. In one place the house of a British Indian subject is threatened. The improvements appear to have been commenced without any provision for the compensation which will have to be paid; and in some cases the owners of houses and shops are being obliged to pay the wages of the workmen employed to destroy their property. The Mutasarrif asserts that the proprietors as yet aflected had all agreed to forego compensation. His ideas on the subject of compensation seem to be vague in the extreme; and he evidently hopes to settle the question, in part at least, by compelling those whose property is benefited by the demolitions to compensate those whose property is injured. (4) This same Mutasarrif, Jalal Bey, a well-meaning man of liberal ideas lately struck with a knotted club ” an individual whom he supposed to be a tax- collector accused of having recovered money illegally. Unfortunately there was a mistake as to identity. The innocent victim is reported to be lying in a some what precarious condition. (5) On the 20th of June orders were received at Karbala from Baghdad to substitute, as a means of determining the share due to Government, actual divi sion of the grain on the threshing floors for estimation by measurement of the growing crops, In Indian phraseology “ Kankut ” is to be replaced by “ Batai.” This is regarded as a reform likely to benefit both the cultivators and the Govern ment.

Over 200 houses which it will be necessary to destroy, in whole or in part, in t See last Summary, III, 2. making the new mainf street through ’the city ( Nazim Pasha Jaddahsi ) have been valued by a committee of ten members, which was appointed some time ago for the purpose. The result of its proceedings is a disagreeable surprise to the Wali, for the compensation estimated as payable has worked out at a much higher figure than he had expected. He seems to have appealed to the Committee to reconsider their estimates, and to have received in reply a refusal and references to an oath which the members took on appointment that they would discharge their duties conscientiously. It is alleged that some of the members of the com mittee are interested, through relatives, in the compensation to be paid for some of the houses ; also that their action is intended to block the whole project of the street, which many dislike, by rendering it financially impossible. Nazim Pasha, however, seems determined to proceed according to his original plan ; and I am informed that the intended breadth of the street has even been increased from 20 metres to 22 metres. It is said that he means to devote part of the annualf sum of x „ , ■. , ,£T. 40,000 promised him for improve- t See translations of his harmanot appoint- V. • , • • , T 5 ment enclosed with last Summary. ment of communications m Iraq to this work. The Turkish regulations governing the acquisition of land for municipal purposes have been printed and placed on sale in order that the public may not afterwards plead ignorance. (3) A concession having been granted for the construction of an electric § See XI, infra. tramway to run along “ Nazim Pasha • Street” and carry passengers beyond the city walls to the suburb of Mu’adhdham on the north and that of Qararah on the south, the first sod was turned for the new work by the Governor-General on4 Sunday, the 20th June. The ceremony, which took place between 9-30 and 11 a m was made the occasion of a considerable display, at which the foreign Con suls’ as well as the chief notabilities of Baghdad were present by invitation Sheep were sacrificed before the commencement of the operations, and a anall review of troops was held after it; but the crowd of ordinary spectators did not exceed 4,000 persons. The place chosen was outside the North Bate, near the cavalry barracks. , _ . The Naqib of Baghdad and other religious dignitaries joined, after Nazim Pasha had struck the first blow, in digging up a piece of ground with pick-axes; and their feebleness and want of skill in this unaccustomed exercise appeared to excite some amusement among the bystanders. The tramway, if completed according to plan, will have a total length of 15 kilometres; and it seems to be expected, even by the best informed of the V ah s staff, that the journey between the termini will be made in half an hour. No allow ance is made for constant halts to take up and «it down passengers, or for the impossibility of running at high speeds in a crowded Oriental town. (4} As mentioned* further on, orders have already been placed with a British ' ' firm for three large motor-vessels to work * See XI, infra. as ferry-boats on the Tigris at Baghdad t See last Summary, HI, 2. an( j su fi ur fi s&gt; These take the place of the projectedt “ steamboat service” mentioned last month.

X See last Summary, in, 2. himself was a member, had recommended § See last Summary, v, 2. ^ re pi acemell t 0 f the present single bridge of wooden pontoons at Baghdad by an iron suspension bridge and two iron pontoon bridges. He said that the Wali had accepted the recommendations of the committee. (6&gt; The prisoners in the Baghdad jail are being employed, under strong gendarmerie guards, in filling up a number of insanitary hollows which exist on the desert side of the left bank portion of the town. One of the prisoners who ran awav was recaptured and shot, the body being afterwards exhibited to his compan ions'. Since this incident there have been no further attempts at escape among the prisoners. # , , T (7) The Wali appears to be as much interested in what may be called moral, as in material, improvements. He once spoke with sympathy m my presence of the total lack of healthy recreation for the townspeople, and I have heard him insist on the desirability of bringing different religions and races together by means of common amusements. The Turkish military bands here have been qujcWy brought to an unusually high standard of excellence, and they play constantly in DU blic places. I understand that His Excellency recognizes the impossibility of creating open spaces in the existing city ; but he has had plans prepared for the probable extension of the town southwards beyond the British Residency, an these a group of gardens at the back of the Residency has been marked down for acquisition as a public park. # ^ , (81 The first public entertainment organized by Nazim Pasha took place o the night of the 30th June in a huge garden on the southern outskirts of the town. Its obfect was to collect a sum of money for distribution among all schools at Baghdad, irrespective of their denommation; and it took the form of a garde fete with illuminations and fireworks, military music, three variety theatres, a raffle and a restaurant. Some of the amusements were repeated on the next day for the tenefit of school children. The net proceeds of the first night s entertain ment were about £ T. 1,000. The arrangements, judged by European standards were far from perfect; but they bore witness to the existence of great ing ability somewhere, and much attention had evidently been grven to detail. Whe the grounds were at the fullest they probably contamed 2,000 people. (91 There has deen a remarkable increase of security at Baghdad, ® S P® C1 ^ 7 during the hours of darkness, since Nazim Pasha’s arrival. I am mformed that m thP hot weather last year, the town swarmed with robbers, and the river and ship ptag resounded wRh rifle and revolver shots all night long, bullets frequently dropping near the R.I.M.S. Comet. Now the only shots heard are those of the police patrols. In the small hours of the morning of the 21 st of June a thief-hunt took place round the Kesidency, accompanied by a good deal of firing, and the promptitude with which the neighbouring posts turned out and a police-boat came dropping down the river was highly creditable. It is now an order that persons going out by night after 4 o'clock Turkish (about 11-15 p.m. at the present season) must carry lanterns ; if they do not, they are liable to be fired on by the police. * Vagabonds are a standing difficulty here. Indigenous and foreign vagabonds* in ^See* Summary, December-January, 1909-10, Baghdad are being collected and sent away to their native districts and countries. The Jews have already dispensed with the private night-watchman, as a rule Afghans, whom they formerly entertained. ( 10 ) The proceedings of the Wali have not, however, been always judicious or successful. v At the beginning of June he undertook to regulate the price of wheat and bread, which he fixed at 20 to 22 Raij piastres per 6 kilogrammes for the former, and at 12 to 14 Raij piastres per 4 kilogrammes for the latter, these being lower than the market rates at the time prevailing. Troops seem to have been used in connec tion with this business, perhaps only to restrain the mob in case of their imagining themselves at liberty to attack the grain-dealers and bakers. This attempt to regulate artificially the prices of grain and bread has not yet been abandoned by the Local Government; but they have withdrawn from another to fix the fares pay able on public vehicles running to Hillah, Musaiyib and Karbala, and on the tramway to Kadhimain. In this case the carriage and tramway proprietors appa rently asserted their right to charge any fares they liked without interference by the Wali. His Excellency has now ordered the adoption forthwith, of the kilogramme and metre as the basis of all commercial transactions. It is quite certain that Nazim Pasha is not guilty of all the extravagances attributed to him by the public, in accordance with the precedents established by Harun-ar-Rashid. At one time it was believed that he had visited in disguise, in the course of a morning, all the grain-dealers' shops in two quarters of the town; at another, that he had personally gone by night and let off a revolver behind the British cemetery in order to see how long the police would take to arrive on the spot. ( 11 ) Some 21 years ago the shrine of Nabi Yashu' (Joshua), which the Jews of Baghdad were in the habit of visiting at Pentecost, was taken from them by ' Asim Pasha, a former Wali of Baghdad, and the shrine was then closed by Muham madans. It is situated in the part of the town on the right bank of the Tigris. Under Nazim Pasha's orders the shrine has now been reopened and the key placed in charge of the Jewish Chief Rabbi. On the 5th and 6 th of June thousands of Jew* went on pilgrimage to the place; and as they crossed the bridge-of-boats, their bands played and they gave cheers in honour -of the Wali, whose Sarai windows look out on the river a little above the bridge. i IV.—Baseah Wilayat. (d Onthe20tht of May Yusuf Pasha and Muhi-ud-Din Pasha, who have been recalled to Baghdad and sent J to Kur- | ( ^^ le * distan, seem to have carried out some successful operations against Arab rebels in the neighbourhood of Shatrah. A Turkish force which had been landed at an A1 Bu 'Alyan village from the steamers Fvrat and Rasafah was suddenly attacked there by a concealed enemy : but the Turks repulsed the attack with vigour and plundered and destroyed the village. They then advanced to an A1 Eu Nujaim village, which was similarly disposed of after the Arabs belonging to it had been dispe sed. The latter, after being joined by contingents of the A1 Bu 'Abudah, Vani Zaid, A1 Bu Sa'ad, etc., renewed the fight; but after an hour's fighting, during which the Turkish column was reinforced from the steamers, they finally gave away and fled. The victorious troops brought much spoil with them into the town of Shatrah. C 584 FD6 The next day the Shaikhs of the Bani Zaid came in to Ynsnf Pasha and were persuaded by him to co-operate with the friendly A1 Bu Shamkhah against their own late allies. A number of Arab hamlets were burned in consequence, and the fighting was at one time so close that daggers were used; also the fort of ’ Alaiwi- al-Khafur, a leading rebel, was destroyed by two battalions of troops. The losses of the Arabs are said to be considerable; those of the Turks are not stated. About the time of these occurrences the followers of Sa'idun Pasha, Muntafik, who is acting with the Turks, captured 25 boxes of ammunition and 250 baskets of dates belonging to the rebels, which they handed over to the officer commanding at Nasiriyah. (2) The Turkish field force in the Muntafik country was withdrawn, soon after this, except one Nishanji battalion. The debacle of the local Turkish administration that ensued has been described by His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah in a despatch dated 25th June, on which day the Wali of Basrah was about to leave for the Muntafik Sanjaq to nego tiate there with the local Shaikhs. Mr. Crow considered the task of restoring order to be hopeless without liberal concessions to the tribes in the matter of outstanding revenue, counterpoised by the despatch of a fresh military force to the scene. Samawahis the only place about which anything subsequent to the military evacuation of the Lower Euphrates country is known at Baghdad; and there, it is stated, swarms of Arabs armed with Martini rifles immediately entered the town, to the'dismay of the Qaim-Maqam, who had been left with only six Dhabitiyahs to protect his life and enforce his orders. The Arabs will do well not to forget, during this interregnum, that sooner or later the Turks will certainly come back. (3) New arrangements for the collection of the revenues &lt;?f the Muntafik Sanjaq have been announced by the acting Mutasarrif to the tribesmen through his subordinate Qaim-Maqams and Mudirs. The essence of these is that the Khums or “ fifth ” recoverable on grain will not be collected direct from the tribes in future, but will be taken at Qurnah and Hai from the merchants by whom the grain of the tribes is bought up and exported. Vessels carrying grain will be required to furnish proof, on demand, that the Khums leviable on their cargoes has been duly paid. (4) The difficulties* between the Wali of Basrah and the Shaikh of Muham- ^ ^ 0 T , 7 0 march have now been adjusted. Four or ee as ummary, , . more bad characters have been handed over by Shaikh Khaz'al to the Turkish authorities at Basrah. (5) There is a rumour at Baghdad that the Wali of Basrah is about to be transferred to Aleppo, and that the Wali of Aleppo at present, I think, Fakhri Pasha—will be sent to Basrah. This report seems to corroborate the idea that there was somef disagreement between t See last Summary, v, 6. Nazim Pasha and Sulaiman Nazif Bey during the latter's visit to Baghdad in May. y. Turkish Affairs. (1) The most important military measure, so far, of the new Governor- , v General has been the evacuation^ ot the t See iv, 2 , supra. Muntafik country, the recall of moi t of the troops quartered there or among the Bani Lam, and the immediate disbandment of Badif battalions on their arrival at Baghdad. Of the Radif, the battalions dis tinguished by the names of Marjan, Mu'adhdham, Kadhimain, Dilaim, Karbala, Khurasan, Daltawah, and Samarrah are known to have been disbanded at Baghdad during June. Almost every week of the past month two or three steamers with barges, bringing troops back from the south, have passed the river front of this Residency; the troops were generally Radif Infantry, but on two occasions field- guns and limbers were distinguishable on board. In passing the R.I.M.S. Comet the Turkish troops have invariably been fallen in and have presented arms to a fanfare of trumpets—an unusual compliment which Captain Finnis has beenprompt to return to the best of his ability. The release to their homes of a couple of thousand reservists, a proportion of whom have been exposed during 2 or even 21 years to the perils and hardships of active service, knowing all the time that no progress was being made in the settlement of the country, must have caused many to bless the name of Nazim Pasha. Some afiecting scenes were witnessed at Bagh dad on the arrival of the steamers. (2) The idea of massing the disposable military resources of the Baghdad Division at head-quarters in future, instead of scattering them over the country, is being freely discussed by the Wali and his staff; and there are some indications which point to early action. A standing camp is being arranged outside the towm, about a mile from the South Gate; it consists at present of about 400 tents, for which mat huts will be substituted by and by. The materials for the huts are being supplied largely by voluntary contribution; and an oil-engine and pump valued at £ T.190 has been furnished for the camp by Yusuf ’Isai, a local engineering firm, at a reduction of £ T.30. The transfer of the Baghdad garrison from their present quarters in the Qishlah to this detached position in the open country will be an advantage from both the disciplinary and the sanitary points of view ; but a more important consideration is that the camp is being laid out on a scale in excess of the requirements of the present Baghdad garrison, which does not exceed 950 men. A regular artillery park is being arranged outside the North Gate, where there are already some barracks, particularly those of the cavalry, outside the walls. (3) On the 4th and 5th of June details amounting to 350 men from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 31st and 32nd Regiments of the 4th Army Corps arrived at Musal. These are perhaps the first of the drafts from the Erzingan Ordu * Sefe translation of the Farman enclosed with to which reference was made* in Nazim last Summary. Pasha’s Farman of appointment. (4) Various changes in military training, organization and equipment are announced. The most important of these depends bn an order of the Ministry of War, received at Baghdad on the 30th of May, under which Radifs are to be drilled twice a week in future at the depots to which they belong. In this province, owing to the badness of communications, etc., it is to be feared that the complete application of this order will not be possible. On the 26th of June it was ordered by the Mushir of the 6th Army Corps that all the mules at present in the possession of infantry battalions in his command for use by mounted infantry should be transferred to the 35th and 36th Cavalry Regiments. The latter regiments will hereafter be described as Astarsuwars (mounted infantry) and not as Sawari (cavalry). The 1st Battalion of the 81st Regiment of Infantry, which is recruited in Bagh dad and has hitherto been quartered there, has been sent to serve at Basrah. Out of some 80 Turkish private soldiers whom Nazim Pasha brought with him from Europe, about 50 are now being instructed in telegraphy in the Baghdad Telegraph Office. Five hundred Mauser carbines for cavalry were received at Musal from Bagh dad, in two instalments, between the 12th and the 14th of May. (5) Some 30 Christians and Jews liable to servicef in the Ihtiyat arrived at Musal early in May from the country towns of Dahuk, Zakho and 'Aqrah and went into the same classes were sent to Kirkuk from Arbil and 'Ainqahwah. The Turkoman recruits for the army seizedj by the late Wali of Musal at Tall 'Afar were let go on the 5th of May under orders from Constantinople. (6) Colonel Nuri Bey, President§ of the Gendarmerie Board of Reorganiza tion, has been promoted to Lieutenant- General (of the 2nd class) and placed in command of the Baghdad Cavalry Division, retaining, but only in name, his connection with the Gendarmerie. It is thought that this has been arranged by Nazim Pasha, who does not like Nuri Bey, in order that he may meet him less frequently on business. t See last Summary, V, 14. barracks, and about 40 recruits of X See last Summary, I, 5. § See Summary for December-January, 1909- 10, V, 7.8 Nazim Pasha seems also to have requested Muhammad 'Ah Pasha (Darwish Qadiri) a German-speaking veteran who now commands the Baghdad Infantry Division, to consider himself as placed on half-pay; and it was apparently his inten tion to confer the appointment on Hasan Riza Bey m addition to that which he already holds at Chief of the Staff. Muhammad 'Ali Pasha, however, has received a telegram from the War Office at Constantinople authorizing him to retain his command, on the strength of which he continues to perform his duties as Divisional Commandant. I mention these items of military gossip for the information of the British Military Attache at Constantinople, as I understand that there has already been^m European Turkey, some abuse of Nazim Pasha and his Pancaldi cadets. (7) The position of Eram Bey,* ostensibly Political Secretary to the new v y r Governor-General, is still doubtful; and it * See last Summary, v, 2. appears that the Daftardar (Accountant- General) has refused to pay Eram Bey's salary at the rate of £ T.30 a month, as requested by Nazim Pasha, on the ground that the sanctioned pay of his appoint ment is only £ T.10. The rank claimed on behalf of Eram Bey, as a Directeur des Affaires Politiques ' of the first class, is equivalent to that of Consul-General. As most of the business of the foreign Consulates at Baghdad is now transacted through Eram Bey, and as he is undoubtedly responsible for the whole of the Wall s political correspondence, which the latter merely signs, I have made some enqmry into his antecedents with the following results. Eram Bey who comes of a Catholic Armenian family, was born at Baghdad 40 years ago. His father was brother of one Rubain Effendi, who was Dragoman of the Baghdad Wilayat about a generation since. Eram Bey left Baghdad at an early age; and by education he is, to all intents and purposes, a European. He has the florid manners of a certain class of Frenchman, and French is his principal language; but he also knows English quite well. His Turkish is described as not sufficient ' for his position ; and of Arabic he only knows a few words m the Egyp tian dialect, but he has set about studying the language here. He knows no Persian. Eram Bey told me once that he had spent three years m the Congo, and had emit ted a theory ' in print on the subject of the formation of the great African lakes. I found he had been in Uganda also, but not in the part of it which I had seen. At Baghdad he has taken up his residence with the widow of his uncle Rubam, who enjoys a small pension from the Turkish Government. Among his other near rela tions here are four brothers named Apigian, who are the sons of his maternal uncle. The Apigians, who are merchants, had losses in business two years ago which obliged them to sell the family house. Eram Bey possesses no property or private means. His health is not strong, and he finds the work of his appointment very heavy. I have no complaint to make, so far, of Eram Bey. He does not inspire con fidence ; but his advent has greatly facilitated the despatch of business with the Wilayat, and his attitude up to the present has been reasonable and conciliatory. (8) Nazim Pasha appears to be fond of Armenians, and has brought two other Armenian dependents besides Eram Bey with him from Constantinople 5 these others are Gregorians not Catholics. Among the favourites with whom the as a has surrounded himself here is Sirop Effendi, an Armenian merchant of BaghdaU, whom he has placed in charge of the Turkish Nahriyah steamers. This appoint ment is open to misconstruction as Sirop is the owner of the riverside liouf 6 which the Wali has taken up his residence. M. Sirop visited me on the Ibth ot June and appeared anxims to cultivate friendly relations. He represented the affairs of the Nahriyah line as in a most unprosperous state. From enquiries since made about him I learn that he failed in business about 15 years ago tor ti. 16,000. He afterwards paid a composition of ten shillings in the poun an obtained, out of court, a paper from his creditors, discharging him and cer i ymg that he was an honourable man. . (9) A number of the civil officials dismissed by the late Reorganiza ion Commission are now being reinstated by t See last Summary, V, 5. new+ Comm i ssl0 n. Per contra some fresh dismissals have taken place : among them that of Suraiyah ey,Ctadurji, Qaim-Maqam of. Va'qubah ^ tribal chiefs who have visited Nazim Pasha since the beginning of June are Wall Agha head of the Vajilan section of the Kurds in the Khanaqin neigh bourhood and his nephew ’ Abdul Wahhab Agha; also Amin Agha of the Jabur Arabs. Others of greater importance are still expected. The burden of the Wall’s remarks to ms tribal visitors has invariably been that the use of military force by the Government to recover tribal revenue is degrading to the chiefs, besides being productive of all sorts of evil, and that the chiefs should, therefore, endeavour in future to recover the revenues from their tribesmen themselves and remit it to the Government. All have, of course, promised to comply with his wishes. Shaikh ’Atiyah, a noted outlaw and robber of the Najaf district, a townsman by birth but now practically a Beaouin in his habits, has been informed under Nazim Pasha s orders that all Government claims against him are remitted, and that he can come in pn phe understanding that private individuals may sue him in the courts for injuries which they have suffered at his hands. (11) The energy of Nazim Pasha and his staff since their arrival here has been remarkable, and it now seems that they have perserverance and settled purpose as well. The evolution of their policy in regard to military arrangements and tribal management, two closely related problems, will be most interesting to watch. It? main lines are already clear. It is evidently intended that in future the greater part of the military force shall be kept concentrated at Baghdad and trained to a high degree of efficiency, and that the maintenance of order in the districts shall ordinarily depend on an Improved force of gendarmerie. The present pacific and liberal policy towards the tribes is partly dictated, no doubt, by a desire to gain time for the necessary improvements in the army and gendarmerie. The evident determination of the Local Government to put an end to the Hamawand trouble, which is probably more serious than the Muntafik on account of its frontier char acter, shows that they do not merely mean to let all differences slide. At the same time they have realised, which their predecessors never did, that to try and cope with all the present troubles at once is merely to prolong a position of stale-mate everywhere. If the tribes perceive the drift of affairs and set thems elves to take advantage of it, the waiting game on which the Government have decided may require strong nerves and much self-control to carry through. On behalf of Nazim Pasha’s policy it may be said that it is above board, manly and business like, and that it is the only one which promises any exit from the present impasse. (12) The dismissals* which have recently taken place seem to settle the J * C WT • T'V -I « _ tial members of the local committee, will proceed to Constantinople to intrigue against him there. If Vafiq obtains the leave for which he has applied, I should expect to find him acting with his friends. Another leading extremi st of the of the Committee of Union and Progress, at which the Wali was pre:ent. All the foreign Consuls received invitations ; and all of them, I believe, went except the Italian and American Consuls and myself. I excused myself, following the example of my predecessor Colonel Ramsay, on the ground of work—a perfectly genuine excuse. It is believed here—with how much truth I cannot say—that there is enmity between Nazim Pasha and Muhammad Shaukat Pasha, Minister of War, and that the interests of the latter and of the Committee of Union and Progress are very closely bound up together. Intelligent out iders seem to think that with the C 584 FD the formation of a sort of conspiracy again t Nazim Pasha; and it is understood that j$lurad Bey, Suraiyah Bey, Rauf Chadurji, and ’Abdullah Effendi, all infiuen- * Fee above V, 9, also last Summary, V, 5. f See ,ast Summary, V, 15. que tion of Nazim Pasha’s attitudef towards the Committee of Union and Progress. A natural result of the dismissals has been X See XL, infra.

It seems certain that its tone is strongly anti-foreign, and 1 think that the admirably engineered agitation at Baghdad last winter against the proposed Lynch concession may safely be attributed to it. Nazim Pasha is believed to stand for a more liberal and philanthropic order of ideas than the committee does. (13) The difficulties* between the Governor-General and Sir William Willcocks’ chief representative at Baghdad culminat- * See last Summary, V/ 8. s00n after the beginning of June, in a complete deadlock, the Wali practically refusing to give further counte nance to the irrigation works or to assist the engineers in any way. On the 10th of June I received a visit from Eram Bey, the Wali s Political Secretary, who represented to me m very moderate terms the causes of the Local Government's unwillingness, under existing arrangements, to be a consenting party to any more expenditure of money on the works. I at once informed His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople by telegram of this inter- view. On the 22 nd of June Eram Bey called again, this time chiefly to complain of the tone of Mr. Medlicott's correspondence with the Wali. He also enlarged on the growing hostility of the local Arabs towards the irrigation engineers, of which I have since received independent evidence; and he remarked that the placing of all orders by Sir William Willcocks with a British firm in Baghdad had given great offence to native merchants. After this I spoke privately to Mr. Medlicott, and his secretary, Lieutenant Loch, about their relations with the Wali; and the result, I am glad to say, has been the complete removal cf all personal friction and difficulties. The operations at Rumadi have been stopped meanwhile, which is not perhaps to be regretted; and the engineers have concentrated their attention for the present on the new Hindiyah Barrage works, for which the V, ali now promises to keep them supplied with sufficient funds. The Government of India are aware of some suggestions which I have ven tured to make to His Excellency the British Ambassador at Constantinople for setting the relations of the irrigation engineers and the Turkish authorities upon a proper basis once for all. (14) His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Musal reports that Husni Beyf returned to that place on the 21 st of May. •f See last Summary, V, 10. The engineer seemed to be of opinion that part of the flat«e country near Kirkuk could be irrigated from the Lesser Zab by means of a canal which might be constructed for £ T, 20 , 000 . The scheme for the irrigation of the Arbil plain from the Greater Zab he apparently regarded as likely to be difficult and expensive, reasons indicated in my last report it would obviously be unwise to attach weight to Husni Bey's opinions. (15) The higher trainingJ of the Baghdad Gendarmerie still continues l See Summary for December-January, 1909- Major (nQW Colonel) Cicognaffi left for 10 , v, 7, Europe in May and has not been replaced, At the middle of June, 100 gendarmes were despatched from Baghdad to Kirkuk, and orders were sent for 100 gendarmes to come from Kirkuk in relief. The result apparently was that the Kirkuk draft laid down their arms and denied their liability to serve at Baghdad. In the end 60 agreed to go to Baghdad, while the other 40 became Bashibazuqs and 40 new men were enlisted instead of them, who will be sent to Baghdad by and by, (16) One or two financial changes deserve to be mentioned briefly. The expected consignment§ of Turkish coined silver arrived at Baghdad by the Constantinople post shortly after § See last Summary, V, 8. the middle of June. The Wali has ordained that only one piastre shall be used in future at Baghdad, and he has fixed its value at 102 -6 to the Limh or pound Turkish, which is the (gold) standard of the currency. The Wali has arbitrarily For any butvalued the Majidi, which contained 20 G. S. P., at 19 new piastres; and the British rupee has fallen from over 31to29B. P. (4 B. P.=l G. S. P.), and the Persian Qran from 9 to 8. The result is consequently a loss in converting Lirahs into Turkish change and a depreciation of 5 or 6 per cent, in the value of foreign silver. It remains to be seen whether market prices will adapt themselves to the new piastre, or whether the new piastre will cause a permanent rise in retail prices. The change hits the recipients of fixed salaries in gold or foreign silver very hard, especially the poorer among them whose small purchases are all made in silver. If it proves permanent it may become necessary to consider the question of com pensation to the subordinate staff of this Residency, the sepoy guard, the crew of the Comet, the Qawasses, and the menials. The report* in the last Summary of the abolition of the Ihtisab tax at Baghdad was apparently premature ; but on the See last Summary, in, 3 . 22nd June a telegram was received from Sasun (Deputy for Baghdad) and Mehdi (Deputy for Karbala) at Constantinople, announcing that the abolition of the Ihtisab at Baghdad and Karbala, and of the abnormal Shahriyaht tax at Karbala, had been decreed. Official orders for their f See Pers. G. Gaz., Vo 1 . II, pages 859- cessation have not as yet reached the 860. Wilayat.

(1) It is now denied that any of the money subscribed at Karbala for the T7T 0 National Loan Fund has been returned] | to II See last Summary, , . the donors. I shall try to discover the truth on my next visit to Karbala. (2) On the 9th of June, Saiyid Mirza Abul Qasim, Imam Jum’eh (Tehrani), and the Naib-us-Sadar (Zinjani), two Persian reactionary refugees who came to Najaf about four months ago, were suddenly arrested by the Qaim-Maqam under direct orders from the .ali of Baghdad. When I was last at Kufah the Imam Jum’eh was living there m a tent, which he had pitched on an island in the Euphra tes. The Imam Jum’eh succeeded in escaping in disguise to the Arabs, but he was promptly recaptured : and both men are now under surveillance at Kadhimain, and security has been taken from them that they will not endeavour to escape. It is stated that their arrest was applied for by the Persian Government on information supplied by ’Abdur Rahim of Baku, a Russian subject, who is an in fluential member of the Anjuman-i-Haiat-i-’Ilmiyah, a society of Persian Constitu tionalists at Najaf. According to another account the proceedings are due to a complaint made by the Persian Anjuman-i-Sa’adat at Constantinople, that the men were intriguing at Najaf against constitutional Government in Persia. Mulla Kazim Khurasani, the notorious Najaf Mujtahid, has protested against their arrest to the Persian Government and the Turkish A ali of Baghdad : by the MU r he seems to have been curtly informed that the matter does not concern him. It is said that Mulla Kazim has also requested the Russian Consul at Baghdad to use bis influence for the release of the prisoners. The appearance of Mulla Kazim as a champion of Persian reactionaries has occasioned some surprise and doubt ; and the failure of his intervention has shaken his influence to some extent. The Persian liberals of Najaf are divided into two camps; the Moderates (I’tidaliyin)12 and the Revolutionaries (Inqilabiyin), in the former of which Mulla Kazim is leader, These two parties are always quarrelling about what is beneficial to the Constitution, and the present incident has greatly accentuated their differences. The arrest is said to have been directed by the Turkish Minister of the Interior at Constantinople; and it is believed that it was originally intended to hand the two men over to the Persian authorities at the frontier, but that this action was Suspended by a later order. It is asserted that both men owe money in Persia; and, if j this is the case, their surrender as absconding debtors may possibly be requested. The Turkish Mutasarrif of Karbala, who appears not to like Nazim Pasha and who has f. ruffled in the present case by the orders for the arrest being sent to the Qaim-Maqam of Najaf direct, is more or less openly condemning the action of his Government as a breach of hospitality and unworthy of a constitutional country. (3) In the second week of June a curious fracas took place at Najaf among some Persians who had formed themselves into a debating society to discuss the politics of their country. The debates were led on the constitutional side by a per son who Stood for Mulla Muhammad Kazim (Khurasani), and on the reactionary side by a man who represented his enemy Saiyid Kazim (Yazdi), both of the indivi duals thus personated being leading Mujtahids of Najaf. For one or two nights the debates were peacably conducted; but they finally resulted in a disturbance, in which the disputants fought and spat in each other’s faces, and which led to the arrest of them all by the Turkish police. They were eventually discharged, except the two mock Mujtahids, who were kept in jail. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala, himself a modernised Persian, has remarked in reporting this incident: “ I do not think that the real Persian constitu tionalists are wiser than these. ” (4) The members of the Persian* Anjuman-FAkhuwwat at Kadhimain have * See Summary for December-January, 1909- been informed by the Wali of Baghdad that, 10 ’ vl &gt; 4 - as foreigners, they cannot be permitted to hold meetings for the discussion of political subjects. They have promised to discontinue their meetings, and it is probable that a school which they had opened will also be closed. It would be a good thing if His Excellency were to suppress all the troublesome Persian societies which flourish, though they are quite out of place here, in this country. (5) Domestic differences, due to Abul Qasim, son of Saiyid Muhammad Baqir ’ (Behbehani) of Karbala, a Mujtahid allowance-holder under the Oudh Bequest, having married as his second wife a woman distantly connected with the royal family of Persia, have involved the Behbehani family, who are Persian subjects, in various tribulations. There was first a case in the Persian Consulate at Karbala, which caused the Behbehani considerable annoyance; and afterwards, the husband of the Qajar lady having insulted the Persian Consul, the latter appealed to the Turkish authorities, by whom Abul Qasim and one of his supporters were put in prison. The reputation of the Behbehani Mujtahid and his family have been greatly impaired by these proceedings. (6) The post of Persian Consul-General at Baghdad has now remained un- f See Summary for March 1910, vi, 5. occupied for more than threef months, and t See Summary for December-January, 1909- it is not knoWn here When it will be filled. io, vi, 3. j • • Musa Khan whose appointment was at one time expected, J is said to have been given a post in the Foreign Office at Tehran. (7) On the 22nd May 1910 the Acting Persian Consul-General at Baghdad— a Munshibashi wrote to the Wali of Baghdad with reference to an old claim by a Persian Saiyid for the price of provisions supplied by him to Ottoman troops at Hindiyah, and in doing so he imprudently reflected on the previous conduct of the lurkish Muhasabah (Accounts Department) in the case. The letter which was in poor Turkish, was not intended to be impertinent; but it was taken as such by Nazim Pasha, who replied to the Acting Consul-General on the 25th of May, order ing him to apologise verbally or in writing within 24 hours on pain of the WalFs breaking off correspondence with him and telegraphing to Constantinople to pressfor his removal. The Persian did not apologise, and official relations were accord ingly broken off and have not as yet been resumed; but ordinary Persian business in the law courts, etc., is going on as usual. I have obtained copies of the- correspondence, but it seems unnecessary to sub mit them. The dispute will probably die a natural death. (8) The Qaim-Maqam of the frontier Qadha of Badrah, op the borders of which there was lately friction* between the subjects of Turkey and Persia, has forwarded to the Wali of Baghdad a f * See Summary for December-January, 1909- p a p er purporting to be an engagement 10, l ' signed and sealed by Ghulam Biza Khan, Sarim-us-Saltaneh, Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, on the 28th April 1910. The paper con tains an undertaking by the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh to prevent the Persian tribes from molesting the Turkish tribes ; to recover and return, on proof being given, all property of Turkish tribes carried off by Persian tribes; and to surrender to tie Turkish authorities, without any delay, Turkish military deserters and escaped criminals. (9) On receiving printed copies of Sir Gerard Lowther^s despatches of the 14th and 25th April last to the Foreign Office on the subject of Turkishf encroach- , X7T c c'' ments on Persia, I wired to His Excellency t See ast ummary, , . ^ ^he 30th June pointing out that “ Nagir- de ” was probably the place called Naghadah by the Turks, where they had a gendarmerie post at the beginning of May, and that \ arandouz, where cus toms duties were being collected by them, might be Rowanduz which is well within the Turkish frontier. (10) Rumours lately reached Karbala and Najaf of reactionary movements in Persia, and in connection with these the names of Saiyid 'Abdullah (Behbe- hani) and Naib Husain (Kashani) are mentioned. The calmness with which the news was received by some of the Mujtahids—especially Mulla Kazim (Khurasam) —has disposed many, particularly in view l See VI, 2, above. ^ effortst on behalf of the Imam Jum’eh, to ask whether the Mulla is not himself a reactionary at heart. It is now recalled that a flying visit was paid to Mulla Kazim at Najaf by the Shams-ul- Muhaqqiqin, a supposed emissary of Saiyid 'Abdullah (Behbehani) who arrived there post-haste from Tehran ; and a certain Mulla Wa'iz, who is still at Najai, is thought to be also a messenger from the Behbehani. On the 8th of June one Mirza 'Ali, suspected of being a Persian reactionary agent, was arrested at Kadhimain by the Persian Consular authorities and put in stocks at the Consulate. His paper 0 also were seized, and it is said that they were found to contain much compromising information about reactionary organizations in Persia. (11) It is stated here that &lt;£ Nawab Ashraf Wala Muhammad Hasan Mirza' has been recognized as heir apparent to the Persian throne. YXI.—Najd Affairs. (1) The young Shammar Amir of Hail, Sa'ud Ibn Rashid, continues to be at v ' ^ » war ^ wl j } ] 1 ^ Amzah tribe; and 1 recently § See Summary for March, vii, i. saw a telegram, signed by him, to Jar Ullah- ad-Dakhil, his agent at Baghdad, in which he informed the latter that the Sham- mar had again chastised the’Anizah-this time xn the neighbourhood of the “ ^ilrVat-al-Hiiaz G Hijaz Railway)—and had returned to their homes. Jauf, however, still remains in the possession of Shaikhs Nuri and Nawwaf of the Ruwala divisions of the ’Anizah, who seized it some months ago. (21 The position of Ibn Rashid has been greatly improved by his recent victories over the ’Anizah; and it is now confidently anticipated that he will soon recover Jauf, and that thereafter he will renew the ancient struggle of his house with Ibn Sa’ud the Wahhabi Amir of Riyadh, for the supremacy in Najd. The test of supremacy is possession of the debatable province of Qasim which lies between Hail andRiyadh, and which has now for several years been in the hands of the 41 Sa’ud Numbe-s of Bedouin tribes are said to be coming over to Ibn Rashid, whose prospects are already considered to be brighter than those of his father (’’Abdul ’Aziz) ever were.

The Jews have done more Jcommunity in this country to diffuse the English language and provide English education. Trade relations, and other relations which have grown out of trade between Baghdad and Manchester and London are the explanation generally offered of this phenomenon. IX. —British Official Matters. * See last Summary, IX, 6. (1) The question* of direct dealings between this Consulate-General and the Turkish Judicial Deparment was at length officially raised in a letter from the Mali, dated 14th June 1910, to my address. Hearing that instructions from the Embassy had reached other British Consulates in Turkey, I thought it better, instead of giving the answer proposed in last Summary, to reply that as a pro- visional|arrangement pending the receipt of orders from His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador I was willing to correspond direct with the Turkish Judicial authorities. I have since referred the matter to Constantinople. (2) A good arrangement has been made, through the Mali's Political Secre tary, in regard to the production of Turkish subjects whose evidence is required in the British Consular Court. I have been told by the Secretary that there is no objection to the Consul-General’s sending for such witnesses himself, and that, if they decline or fail to obey his summons, the Turkish authorities, upon receiving sufficient notice, will take steps to compel their attendance before him. ( 3 ) The Mali’s Pobtical Secretary called on the 30th of June to discuss with . „ . j c, ttttt o me the questiont of the British doctors t See test Summary, VIII, 2. practisin | at Baghdad without Constanti- nople diplomas, and of their unlicensed dispensaries. It was agreed that the Mali should write me a letter on the subject. Before Eram Bey left I told him that I should be glad to do what I could , 0 , , 0 TV _ to meet the wishes of the Turkish Govern- + i ee as nummary, , . ment in regard to a change]! in the uni form of the Qawasses of this Residency. I did not mention, of course, instruc tions to this effect which I had received from the Embassy. He said that he thought a few superficial alterations, which could be settled between us later on, would be sufficient, for it was only necessary to make the Qawasses easily dis tinguishable from Turkish soldiers. ( 4 ) On the 3 rd of June the MAH of Baghdad received a tel- gram from the Rrime Minister directing him to make it generally known that there was no truth in a rumour that Great Britain had assumed an attitude hostile to Turkey over the Cretan question. I am not aware of the steps, if any, taken by the \\ ali under these orders. ( 5 ) On the 9 th of June I dined with Nazim Pasha at his private residence, asi did also the Italian, American, Austrian, and Russian Consuls. The ladies of our families were also invited and went. The Mali was supported on this occasion by all the principal members of his staff. On the 11 th of June he gave a second dinner to the remaining members of the Consular body. On the 12 th of June Colonel Hasan Riza Bey, Chief of the Staff, Commodore Hikmat Bey, Naval Commandant, and Eram Bey, Political Secretary, dined at the Residency along with two or three European guests. On the 17th of June I called on Nazim Pasha at his private house and found him quite alone ; he received me in a most friendly manner. We had an agree able conversation, lasting half an hour without even a servant present—an experience which I have never had before in this country in visiting a Turkish official. ( 6 ) On the 18th of June I visited an interesting Armenian subject and pensioner of the British Government at his house in the native city: this was Mr. James Thaddeus, formerly Dragoman of the Residency. His brother, Mr. Gabriel Thaddeus, who was once Residency Accountant, was also present. The father of the pair was broker to the Honourable East India Company’s establishmentI 16 at Basrah until 1832, when he migrated to India. From India James and Gabriel came again to ’Iraq in 1845 to serve at Baghdad under Colonel Rawlinson, who knew their family; and here they have ever since remained The former is now 84, and the latter 78 years of age ; but both are in nil possession of their faculties. A son of James is now a clerk m the English office of the Residency, and a son of Gabriel occupies his father s place as Accountant. X. Foeeign Inteeests and Official Matters. m On the 24 of June the Turkish Mutasarrif of Karbala informed the Bri tish Vice-Consul there that he had been ordered by the Minister of the Interior to renort in regard to the establishment of a Russian Consular * post at Najaf, t0 p g ^ of which the Russian Government were * See last Summary, X, 4- desirous. He asked the Vice-Consul whether he thought that the location of a foreign Consular officer with a flagstaff in Naiaf would excite any religious fanaticism, to which Mr. Muhammad Hasan replied that he did not think so, provided the person appointed were a local Muhammadan. The Mutsarnf then remarked that the obiects of the intended Consular post must be political, not commercial, otherwise it would have been placed at Karbala and not at Najat. On receiving the above information I telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the previous rumour of Russian negotiations at Constantinople for a consular establishment at Najaf was confirmed. I added that there did not auDear to be any objection to the creation of the post, provided the incumbent were an Asiatic and his rank in the service not superior to that of the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. The first incumbent is likely to be Abul Qa^im (Shirwani), a resident of Najaf; he is a young man and formerly bore a bad reputation, but he has been acting for some time as an unofficial Russian agent. (2) After the return of the expeditionf against the Dilaim and Shammar v ' to Musal, the claims of certain Catholic t See last Summary, l, O. villagers, Turkish subjects to some of the sheep captured by the expedition were pressed on the notice of the Daftardar by M. Henriet, lately Acting French Vice-Consul at Musal. Ihe Daftardar declined to recognize that M. Henriet had any locus _ standi m fhp matter* and in rejecting his fintervention the Daftardar possibly made use of some words such as 4 £ the time is past for the interference of hat- wearers ” The rebuff suffered by the French Vice-Consul was perhaps not un merited for he bad evidently no more right to act as protector of the claimants than a British Vice-Consul would have if, in similar circumstances, they should happen to be native Protestants. By the beginning of May M. Henriet had been ^permanently transferred away from Musal; but his place has since been taken by an acting successor, M. Barthe de Sandfort, previously employed in the French Consulate at Salonika, who arrived at Musal on the 29th of May. (3) The German Vice-Consul at Musal went on leave about the time that M. Henriet left, and he is not expected to return to Musal. (4) The afiair J of the Honorary Dragoman of the American Consulate at 0 v _ Baghdad appears to be still under dis- j See last ummary, ^ , cussion. I understand that some flaw has been discovered in M. Kouyoumdjian’s appointment, which can only be considered as a piece of good fortune for the Turks who certainly were not aware of it at the time of his illtreatment. Before the incident M. Kouyoumdjian was universally regarded as a Dragoman. XI. —Commercial Matters. \ Since his arrival at Baghdad Nazim Pasha has shown a strong interest in financial and commercial enterprises and organization, and at the present moment there is a feverish rush here for concessions of all sorts, due mainly to tne new W all's encouragement and to the opportunities he has created.t 2 . Among the financial questions which have arisen, that of the raising of a loan by the Baghdad Municipality is per- ’ * ® ee Summary for April 1910, XI, 1. ^ hapg the most im p 0rtant . A loan* was talked of before, but it is only since Nazim Pasha came that the project has assumed a definite shape. The W ali’s idea is that the municipality should be able to raise a loan of £ T. 250,000 at 5 per cent, interest on the security of its present revenues. Negotiations with the foreign financiers, of whom some are British, are in progress. One competitor for the loan is M. H. Viollet, an apparently well-to-do young Frenchman wdio has already bought up, for himself or for others, some £ T. 24,000 worth of land and house property in and near Baghdad. M. Viollet, who has b'ought his wife with him from Europe as on a former occasion, has considerable knowledge of the country. He is working through the Ottoman Bank at Baghdad in the matter of the loan. The present revenues of the Baghdad Municipality are probably capable of expansion without detriment to trade or the increase of wealth. It seems absurd that a rich city of 150,000 inhabitants should have an income of less than £ T. 15,000 a year, which is the case here. House property appears to be at present practically untaxed, and the receipts of the municipality consist largely in mis cellaneous items difficult of collection. 3 . A number of Baghdad merchants, seemingly oblivious of the fact that the grant of a monopolyf for steam naviga tion of the Tigris and Euphrates is still under consideration of the Porte, are endeavouring to obtain concessions for f Viz., that proposed in favour of an Ottoman Company to be formed by the amalgamation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Turkish Nahriyah line. putting steamers on the rivers. One of the applicants is Haji Salih (Astrabadi), a naturalised Turkish subject of Persian origin, who has been running a small steame: between Kadhimain and Samarrah du ing the last 1 J years, and who now apparently wishes to extend his operations. The existing service seems to have been begun without regular permission from the Turkish Government; and that it has been a remu nerative speculation is proved by the owner’s refusing an offer of £ T. 500^ a year by ’Ali Muhammad (Shushtari), a British subject, who was willing to hire the vessel on these terms and run it on his own account. In reply to his request for a general navigation concession, however, the Astrabadi seems merely to have been told that he must obtain proper sanction for his existing steamer, and that he must be prepared in future to hand over 10 per cent, of his net profits to the Baghdad Municipality. Meanwhile the Qaim-Maqam of Samarrah has reported that the present steamer is unsuitable and in a dangerous condition, and it is in fact not in very good order. X See the Memorandum on the “ Affaire Lynch ” at Baghdad, forwarded by me to the Government of India and His Britannic Ma jesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople under date 31st January 1910. Another aspirant in the field of steam navigation is ’Abdul Qadir (Khadhairi) who took a prominent part in the agita- tionj against the proposed Lynch conces sion in December 1909, and whose own application for leave to run steamers on the rivers of Mesopotamia seems to have been lodged before the arrival of Nazim Pasha. The condition about handing over 10 per cent, of the net profits to the Baghdad Municipality is being urged on the Khadhairi also who is trying, as such an arrangement would probably involve municipal interference with his operations and examination of his accounts, to get the annual payment of a lump sum substituted. The Wali lately informed the First Dragoman of this Consulate-General that he had forwarded Abdul Qadir’s proposals to Constantinople but had not recommended their acceptance. Nazim Pasha is believed to be much influenced in his official dealings by personal considerations, and it is said that he has conceived a dislike for the Khadairi. Possibly the strongest combination now interesting itself in navigation pros pects is one which includes Saiyid Hasun, a local money-changer, and Shaikh Muhammad Kazim and Saiyid Abul Hasan, two Khadims of the Kadhimain Shrine. Shaikh Muhammad Kazim, who has § See Summary for Apnl-May 1910, XII, 3. been mentioned§ before in my reports, is no C 584 FD18 doubt a wealthy man. The syndicate also includes three British subjects, viz. Haji ’Ali Muhammad (Shushtari), Haji Muhammad Nabi, and Abdul Karim (Kanguui). These capitalists desire permission to run steamers between Basrah and Baghdad and Basrah and Kufah, and to obtain a partial monopoly —viz to the extent to which they are able to provide steamers—for navigation on the upper Tigris between Baghdad and Musal. (4) Tenders for the establishment of electric tramways and the installation of electric lighting at Baghdad were invited in the local official journal “ Zaura ” * See xi i suvra. of the 22nd Ma ^ ( a M * Viollet, already mentioned above,* is believed to have tendered for both schemes, and Haji Ibrahim, Jajjo, a Baghdadi Turkish subject who has lived long at Paris, for the lighting arrangements only. A group headed by Mahmud Shahbandar have also made offers for both works, and in some quarters it is believed that the terms of this group have already been accepted : it seems, however, that there is still some question about a payment of £T. 4,000 a year which the Local Government would have them make to the Baghdad Municipality. Their draft concession (or concession) is for 75 years ; and under it they would receive 5 per cent, annually on their capital outlay, after which any additional profits remaining would be divided between themselves and the Baghdad Municipality in the proportion of 3 to 1. The tramway should be completed by them within two years on condition that the opening up of the new street through the city is finished within six months. D / (5) Hamdi Bey, Babanzadah, the member of the Committee of Union and + gee V, 12 , supra. Progress already mentioned,f is reported to have obtained a contract of the convey ance of the Turkish mails weekly by motor-car between Baghdad and Damascus, and Damascus and Baghdad. The term of the contract is five years, and the subsidy to be paid is £ T. 550 a month. Hamdi Bey is to make a reconnaissance of the intervening desert within 1J months, after which he will be allowed to resign the contract if he considers the service impracticable. (6) There are other projects in the air of starting tram or motor services between Baghdad and Ba’qubah, Baghdad and Khaniqin, Karbala and TaWarij, &amp;e. None of these are sufficiently definite or strongly supported to merit detailed mention at present. They are encouraging, however, as indications that some opening up of the country is likely to take place by degrees. (7) On the 29th of June about 80 merchants and others assembled at the Sarai on the invitation of the Wali, who proceeded to expound to them a plan of his own for the formation of a General Development Company, Turkish of course, with a capital of £T. 100,000 divided into 100 shares of £T. 1,000 each. He explained how the existence of such a company would enable Turkish subjects to exploit the country themselves by means of steamers, tramways, etc., and he added that, if his suggestions were not acted upon, the Government would be justified in continuing to give contracts, concessions, etc., to foreigners at their discretion. The Wali’s proposals seem to have fallen flat; and the meeting at the Sarai was at length adjourned in order that the prospectus of the proposed company, which had been prepared in Turkish only, might be translated into Arabic and printed. Native merchans themselves state that they have not enough confidence in one another to embark together on so large an undertaking as that suggested. Before this His Expellency had been proclaiming, more or less publicly, that in future no concessions would be given to foreigners, but that Ottoman concession- naires would be allow'ed to take foreign capitalists into partnership. (8) On the 17th of June Nazim Pasha informed me privately that he had placed an order for three large motor-boats with an English firm and that it had been accepted. These are the vessels already i See m ’ L s “P ra ’ mentioned! above ; and it seems that they will have a length of 50 feet and a speed of 12 knots, and will carry 60 passengers each. I understand from Commodore Hikmat Bey that the firm employed are Messrs. Thornycroft of London. On the 24th of June Nazim Pasha told Mr. Nersessian, my First Dragoman, that he had ordered two more similar motor-boats which he meant to run on the Euphrates between Basrah and Maskanah.^ SU( ^ (ien out bnrst of commercial activity described -bove r a XfX 8 Xrf erp e t f lty ’ espe r ally as 1 feel c »^emble doubt of itglLine- A number of tL to n°h the P romoters generally to carry it to a successful issue, umber of the would-be native concessionnaires have no experience of the hind iThadlati if 7 ^ t0 g6 there ' Sald to be a d r T f 5 7 ; 7 nd Hamdl Be 7 18 neurotic and has recently had a dis- oteratfn 11 *’ 1 understand &gt; wlth a British Consul in Syria.

I enclosed a list of articles m regard to which I could supply information. a J- n ^ 0 ^ nat i°d 1 anc f instructions received by telegram from His Britannic Maiesty’s Ambassador relieved me of responsibility in the matter of the Baghdad Municipal i In regard to steam navigation, I mformed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Con stantinople by wire of the official tendency to overlook the pending Lynch conces sion project which was being manifested here. Finding that the Saiyid Hasun group had been approached by an agent of the Russian Consulate with a view to securing an order for steamers for Russian builders, I advised Haji ’Ali Muham- madfbhushtan), one of the British partners, to obtain quotations from British buglers also; and I understand that he has since approached Messrs. Lynch’s Baghdad agent with a specification. In the matter of the electric schemes, I telegraphed to the Brilish Embassy at Constantinople about the presence there of Mahmud Shahbandar, and about the probability, unless he were interviewed on behalf of British electrical manu facturers, of his placing any orders he might have to give in Belgium. With regard to the Damascus motor service, I ascertained that Hamdi Bey though he would most probably buy his automobiles in Paris, was also in treaty with the Argyle and another British Motor Company. This desert mail service by motor-car has been undertaken, I should say, without sufficient enquiry or thought ; and, if it ends in failure, the blame will probably be laid upon the maker of the cars with which the experiment is made. With regard to the motor vessels ordered by Nazim Pasha from England, I have carefully and repeatedly impressed upon His Excellency the necessity of insisting that the makers should send out a European engineer with the boats to put them together and instruct native mechanics in their management; and I have also telegraphed to the Embassy in the same sense. Experience with the Residency motor-launch, itself by Messrs. Thornycroft, has shown that motor- vessels cannot be satisfar torily run by the present race of Baghdad mechanics. 'The Residency launch is as often laid up as working. (10) Mr. Prince,* the representative of Messrs. Cooper, Allen and Company * See last Salary, xi, l.

Before his depar ture Mr. Prince was promised another order for 1,000 saddles from his firm, as soon as the money should be available ; and after he was gone Nazim Pasha spoke of him to me as an excellent man of business, and said that he was also “ tres sympathique.” Mr. Prince, on his part, was so well pleased with prospects here that he seriously proposed to return to Baghdad for six months next winter to study and cultivate the market. He conducted his business with the Turks entirely without consular assistance.

The pfficers of the Turkish staff now here are of a different type from those to whom the residents of Baghdad have been accustomed; they^are much more agreeable and seem to prefer European to native society. (3) Through a native merchant the Wali of Baghdad has received a sum of Rs. 11 702 apparently subscribed in the island of Bahrain, as a contribution towards the improvement of the Turkish fleet. A copy of the list of subscribers is being sent to the Government of India, to the Political Resident m the Persian Gull, and to the Political Agent in Bahrain. (4) On the 21st of June I received a visit from M. Papo, the Jewish Grand Rabbi at Baghdad. His object appeared to be to' introduce to me his son, who has iust obtained a teacher’s certificate at a normal school m Pans and is about to be appointed to the staff of the school of the Alliance Israelite Umverselle at Baghdad; also to request my cooperation in obtaining an English burgeon as Superintendent of the Jewish hospital at Baghdad. The last proposal had already been mooted to the Residency Surgeon; but the terms offered are so exceedingly poor—100 francs for 10 days’ work per mensem—that nothing seems likely to come of it. I promised, however, to look into the subject if the Committee, ot which the Grand Rabbi is President, would write to me officially about it.

Meanwhile a protest against any kind of amnesty to the Shaikh is being organized by a local notability named ’Ala-ud-Din. This man is connected with Shaikh Bamani of Amadiyah, who is a personal enemy of the Shaikh of Baraizan. f.See Summary for April-May 1910, 1-1. Muhi-ud-Din Pashaf (I) left Musal for Constantinople on the 12th of June. (2) At the end of May a Kurdish Chief sounded His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Kirmanshah as to the possibility of British countenance and protection being extended to a friend of his, a Turkish subject named Shaikh Mahmud, Rais- as-Sadat of Sulaimaniyah, who was in danger. Enquiry made on this side, at Mr. McDouall's instance, showed that the person in question was the eldest sur- + See last Summary, 1-2. ving son of the ShaikhJ Sa’id who was killed at Musal in January 1909 ; that the riot in which his father had perished was provoked by an act for which one of the young man's immediate associates was responsible; that he had probably taken an active share himself in exciting the present rebellion of the Hama wand Kurds, among whom he is supposed to be now living, against the Turkish Government; and that, though quite a youth, he bears a generally bad character. This result was duly communicated to the Consulate at Kirmanshah. (3) Depredations by the Hamawand§ apparently continue.

(4) On the night of the 9th June some inhabitants of the Christian village of Tall Kaif, to the north of Musal, drove off a party of Hadidi Arab thieves, who were attempting to steal their crops, and killed one of them. (5) On the 13th of June the authorities of the Musal Wilayat were directed, n See last Summary, 1-6. in a telegram from the Ministry of Justice, to give effect to the separate^} registra tion of local converts to Nestorianism, which had already been ordered. At the beginning of July, however, the instructions of the Ministry of Justice were still unexecuted; and the Musal authorities appeared to be resisting them on the ground of an alleged regulation under which Turkish subjects were in future to be registered as Muhammadans, Jews or Christians only, and no classification of Christians by sects was to be attempted. Denominational distinctions have hitherto been recognized in registering Christians at Musal; and they are still, it is believed, so recognized in the Wan and Diyarbakr Wilayats. The chief hardship to which the non-registrafion of the Nestorian converts in the Musal Wilayat exposes them is that they cbntinue in the meantime to be represented in their dealings with the local Government by the leaders of the Catholic majority, who are their bitterest enemies. The aggressive character of the Nestorian movement in this part of the country will, however, be borne in mind.

It appears that Nazim Pasha, who is not wanting in magnanimity, wishes it to be called after the reformer Midhat Pasha, who was v\ ali of Baghdad about 40 years ago, and not after himself. The Governor-General, having failed to persuade the commission of valuation as originally constituted to reduce their estimates, as reported last month, changed three of the members and so succeeded in obtaining a reduction of about 20 per cent, in the compensation recommended. Ultimately 506 houses were assessed for destruction at £ T. 98,080 ; but it was suggested that 5 per cent.^ should be further deducted from this sum ‘ ‘ as a favour to the Government I am informed that according to the new proposals Muhammad Fazil Pasha, ex-Wali of Musal, will receive only £ T. 700 for his private residence which cost £ T. 2,000 to build, and whr h will be virtually destroyed. It t See last Summary, XI- 2 . -g s ^ a ^ e( j that M. Yiollet,| the French architect and speculator, has offered £ T. 30,000 for the remnants of houses and shops which will be left on the hands of the municipality after the expro priations have taken place 5 but I can hardly believe that, in the present nebulous state of the project, he has made any such definite offer. If he has, he must have formed a very high idea of the value which small sites upon the new street are likely to possess. Two or three large new cross-streets are intended to be laid out between the river bank and the new main street, running at right angles to both and connecting them. A series of narrow and crooked streets which leads from the sarai to the south gate, and which may be described as yt present the main artery of communi cation in Baghdad, is being widened piece-meal here and there. I have not heard of any compensation being paid to Turkish subjects in connection with this undertaking ; and I shall have more + See VIII -1 b 4ow. ^ ga y on ^ g-^pject 0 f it in the section^ on British interests. The European view at Baghdad is that the ''Tali would be better advised to leave the greater part of old Baghdad as it is, and to devote his energy and the funds of the municipality to the improvement of the more modern portion within the south gate and to the creation§ of a § See paragraph 7 of this section below, new an( j we |] l a id-OUt Suburb beyond it. (2) Municipal arrangements generally are in a state of flux and uncertainty at Baghdad. On the 9 th of July, the municipality having been divided into three separate municipalities under a scheme which had been previously discussed, elections were held for three Committees. The “ first ” municipality consisted of the southern part of the left bank portion of the town, the “ second ” of the northern part on the same side, and the “ third ” of the right bank portion, known as Karkh. ’Abdur Rahman Pasha (Haidarizadah) w. s returned as President of both the first and second municipalities, and Rashid Effendi (Tikritizadah) as President of the third. After the elections the local newspapers began to condemn the splitting up of the municipality, which obviously will be attended by many practical disadvan tages, and the Wall then proceeded to cancel all the elections on the ground of the Haidarizadah’s having canvassed for his appointment. It is inferred that Nazim Pasha is prepared to reconsider the question of the subdivision of the municipality. On the 28th July I had an interveiw with Musa Baig (Pachachizadah), the acting President of the municipality, at which he gave me a woeful account ^ of the position of that body under the new regime. According to him the munici-J See last Summary, III-8. § See last Summary, III-7. pality is being used as a milch-cow, and is not consulted or even informed as to the manner in which its funds are applied by the v ali. Colonel Jawad Bey, an engineer, one of the Wall’s military staff, has been invested with a sort of dictator ship in municipal affairs and pays no regard to the Committee. This officer, if my informant is to be believed, tried to persuade the Wali that £ T. 20,000 would be a sufficient amount for compensation to the owners of immoveable property affected by the new main street whereas the committee gave it as their opinion that, if justice were to be done and the law observed, a sum of at least £ T. 90,000, and possibly of as much as £ T. 150,000, would be required. Musa Baig complained particularly of the Wall’s action in the matter of the municipal motor- * See last Summary, Hi-4 launches ordered from Messrs. Thornycroft, of which he said the committee knew nothing. The committee, however, had been called on to find a sum of £ T. 5,000, which the firm required in advance; and as the municipality had not the money, Musa Baig,, after trying m vain to raise it in his capacity as Acting President, had found himself obliged to borrow it on his personal account He added that he had resigned office, and that the \\ ah had nominally accepted his resignation, but had obliged him to continue discharging the duties as before. „ . .. . 1T (3) The fillmgt up of insanitary hollows t See last Summary, IH-6. on the north-east side of the town still continues. (41 The date garden of ’Abdul Qadir (Khadhairi)—that in which the enter- v ' tainmentj of the 30th June was given—is understood to have been leased by the municipality from the owner as a public§ park. The municipal committee will pay rent to the owner and keep up the park, and all the revenue derived from it will be theirs. (5) The net proceeds of the entertainment]| of the 30th June were found in the end to amount to about £ T. C30, and this II See last Summary, HI-7. gum - g ^ging distributed among all the schools recognized by the Turkish Government at Baghdad. The bulk goes, of course, to various Government schools ; but among the other recipients are the schools of the Alliance Israelite Universelle (£ T. 20), the Roman Catholic School for the Blind (£ T. 25), the Chaldsean Schools (£ T. 16), the Committee of Union andProgress School (£ T. 10), the Armenian School (£ Tl0)and the Church Missionary Society’s School (£ T. 10). (6) Another entertainment,—a river fete.—was organized by the Wali in aid of hospitals, and took place on the _ 25th July. The Nahriya steamer Baghdad carried about 250 European subscribers a few miles down the river in the evening and returned towards midnight. Another steamer took a large number of ordinary Baghdadis at lower rates. The British Resident and the Commander of the R.I.M.S. Comet were the only two foreign officials invited to dine at the Wall s table on board. The European community at Baghdad are growing somewhat restive under this system of compulsory “benevolences”. The tickets for the Baghdad weie sold at half a Lirah each; those for the garden entertainment of the 30th June at one Lirah (18 shillings). (7) On the 2nd of July proclamation was made through public criers that the lands outside the south gate, belonging partly to Government and partly to private individuals, would be sold to the public for occupation at the low rate oi halt a Maiidi per square metre. It was stated that the private owners concerned had agreed. The object is to found a new suburb and relieve overcrowding in the city. i (8) All houses and shops in municipal limits are being numbered. As the ^ streets in Baghdad have no names, the numbers for the most part run serially b| j wards. (9) An effort is being made by the Wali to get rid of the thousands of ownerless does which infest the streets of Baghdad, and, if he could destroy them as they are collected, the result would no doubt be beneficial. Many of them are unsigh y objects suffering from loathsome diseases. Public opinion, however, is so strong yagainst the actual destruction of the dogs that he has been obliged to keep them alive in a disused powder-mill outside the city. When I visited this novel Dogs' Home on the 30th of July it already contained 500 animals; and I hear that the pumber has since risen to 1,150. The sexes are rigorously segregated in the home, and it is hoped that, by persevering in these methods, the canine race at Baghdad will eventually become extinct. Dogs' dung is one of the exports* of Baghdad, whence it goes to America and Euxope for use in the preparation of the finest kinds of leather ; and an enterprising contractor was not long in offering to pay £ T. 500 down for the privilege of feeding the dogs collected and disposing of their produce. Another speculator then tendered £ T. 400 a year to the municipality for a permanent contract, and the city fathers have signified their willingness to grant it if the amount offered is increased to £ T. 600 per annum. '■ * This trade in which, among others, the late Spanish Consul, M. Asfar, was engaged, is a perpetual source of levity at Baghdad. It is said that a Jewish exporter of dogs’ dung, on being required to pay the usual I per cent, ex port duty, recently asked the Customs to ac cept it in kind—a request which under Turkish law ^key could not refuse. (10) An administrative order by which the owners of oil-engines were required to cease working them within municipal limits is noticed more fully, though f See VIII-3. ^ applied to Turkish subjects as well as ' foreigners in the sectionf on British in terests below. (11) In the first week of June the Wali was consulted in a telegram from Con stantinople as to the best site for an improved} Customs House at Baghdad. He $ See Summary for February 1910, v,7. replied, it is understood, recommending a site outside the south gate which is favoured by all the British merchants here. (12) The earai has been connected by telegraph with the new§ military stand- § See last Summary,V-2. ing camp, and with the WalCs present river side house, which latter is on the right bank below the town. There are telephones at the Sarai, but they only connect the various rooms. There are no telephones as yet at Baghdad between one place or building and another. (13) On the night of the 12th July several boxes of small arm ammunition were carried off by robbers from the artillery lines in the QaTah (citadel). Some troops turned out and there was a good deal of firing. Two men, one an Arab and the other a Kurd, were wounded and taken prisoners; they asserted that they had no connection with the robbery. Ten days later it tr. nspired that the loss of cartridges amounted to about 15,000 rounds. Eventually a native of Musal was arrested and gave evidence that one Bajab, a soldier, was concerned. The soldier’s house was searched and 250 cartridges were found, on which he confess ed to having sold the rest to a Jewish hawker. Further information showed that cartridges had been brought to the house of Mulla Dawud, formerly Mukhtar (head man) of the Haidarkhana quarter. A few days later 250 more of the missing car tridges were found in the river. Rajab, the Jew, and Dawud are now in custody.. (14) The annual Farmans for recruitment for the army in the Haidarkhana,, Marjan, Diyalah, Mu’adhdham and Karkh quarters of Baghdad have arrived; and the Haidarkhana Farman was publicly read on the 6th July. Diyalah, though treated as a quarter, is at some miles distance from Baghdad, being situated be yond Qararah. Mu’adhdham is 2 or 3 miles from the city in the opposite direction. IV.— Basbah Wilayat. » (1) The Wali of Basrah, who leftfl by river for the Muntafik country on the 25th II See last Summary, IV-2. Jun^ returned to his headquarters on the 3rd of July. In the brief interval be tween these dates he had meetings with various Arab Shaikhs at Suq-ash- Shuyukh Nasiriyah and Shatrah; and on the 2nd of July he reported by telegram to the Governor-General that the tribesmen were coming in and making their submission, and that some of them were restoring rifles which had been taken ip action from the Turkish troops. At Nasiriyah Sulaiman Nazif Bey placed three C 746 FD*-■-?■**' telesraph officials under arrest on a charge of having supplied mfomataon about the intentions and movements of the Government to the tribes. His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah clearly, regards the Muntafik settlement as a hollow one and not likely to last. A new Mutasarrif has now been appomted to Muntafik in the person of Musa Kadhim Effendi. Apparently soon after the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the country, Durrajak, a place on the Euphrates between Samawah and Basmyah, was entered by armed Arabs. They are said to have demolished the telegraph office and cut down the lines in the vicinity. A rumour has lately reached Karbala of a serious affair at Nasiriyah itself, where it is stated that Saiyld Zaidan, a rich notable of the ptee, has been mur dered in his house along with some Turkish civil and military officers, the assailants are said to have been Arabs who entered the house in disguise and shot the party down. This report is as yet unconfirmed. Trouble is reported in the neighbourhood of Qumah; mid the Qaim-Maqam of •See Summary lor December-January 1909.10. that place, Sultan Bey, Has been brought to iv b 2 m y Baghdad m order, it is said, that certain charges against him may be investigated. (2) A quarrel which caused some general excitement is said to have taken place between Nashat Bey, Commandant of the troops and Acting Commandant of Gem dfrlerl at Basrah and one Sulaiman Faizi Efiendi, editor of the Aiqadh newspaper. According to Baghdad accounts popular feeling was strongly on the side of the editor; and telegrams complaining of the behaviour of Nashat Bey have been received by the Governor-General. Nashat Bey seems to be one of the mili tary officers who came to this country with Nazim Pasha ; his rank at the time of his arrival was that of Adjutant-Major. (S\ ’Oraibi Pasha and his son Muhammad Bey, two leading Shaikhs of the ' Amarah neighbourhood, arrived at Baghdad on the 2nd July to interview Nazim Pasha ' (4) The present state of relations between the Wall of Basrah and the Shaikh of Muhammarah, the friction between the Basrah Wilayat, and the Shaikh of Sve“e rkids in the neighbourhood of Zubair a scheme by Commodore Hikmat Bey for the buoying, lighting and dredging of the bar of the Shatt-al A ah aiid the erection of a lighthouse at Fao by the Turkish Goverument and the reoccu pation of Zakhnuniyah Island near Bahram by the^ks haveno doubt been fully reported on to the Government ol India and His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople by the local officers serving under their orders. V &gt;r —T urkis5 Affairs. fl) The Turkish National Fete, which fell on the 23rd July, was made the occasion of a military review at Baghdad; it was held on the plain near e new standing camp an hour before sunset. There were a tent and special enclosure for European and other guests whom the Wall invited to be present. The troops on parade numbered about 3,000, of whom some 2,400, including gendarmerie, were infantry. The movements, considering that the men ad been only about two months under proper training, were very creditably executed. Instantaneous photographs of the march past have been sent to the Unel ^ the General Stag’s Division (M. 0.-3), Simla, and to the British Military Attache at Constantinople; but the appearance of the troops on parade was considerably better than might be judged from the photographs. The infantry, on w om t German “ Parade Schritt ” is evidently being inculcated with the usual ludicr s results, passed first; they were followed by two field batteries, a battery of Q. , F. guns, a machine gun section, and a cavalry regiment, m the order nam Everything had been done to simplify and facilitate the m0 ^ eI “ ents : . 11 Nob ®‘Jl passed the saluting base on a front of more than 15 men; and the ”ti e r y I cavalry did not move out of a walk. The composition of the parade ^ fi ct the two field batteries of 6 guns passing as three of 4 guns each, and t y “regiment,” nominally the 31st, consisting partly of drafts from the 35th and 36th,I The infantry were professedly the 41st, 42nd and 43rd of the line, and the Markae (or headquarters) battalion of gendarmerie; but here too, I suspect, there was 1 considerable juggling with units. If the infantry were really what they purported to be—three regiments and a battalion, besides details such as Ihtiyat, Gendar merie Training School, etc.,—they must have been further below strength than is usual even here. The Baghdad Army Corps have evidently taken the Native Army of British India as their model in matters of uniform and equipment. All the troops were clad in khaki, generally drill; and most of them wore puttis. Their ammunition boots were in some cases of the familiar British Indian pattern. Indeed but for the head-dress—an Arab kerchief dyed khaki,—the parade might have been, as regards uniform, one bf Indian troops; and the staff are evidently dissatisfied with the local Kafiyah, as they have since obtained from me the services of a sepoy to show them how the Indian pagri is tied and worn. The officers of some units wore white kerchiefs, which would be a most unpractical and dangerous distinction on active service. The troops reviewed were mostly, I fancy, mongrel townsnlen and Arab pea sants. Their appearance was hard and sturdy, but rather coarse-bred. They gave me the impression of resembling the Khedive's Fallah troops, though of shorter stature, and I should expect them to prove bbedient, possessed of physical strength and endurance, and possibly capable of a smart drill. It would not surprise me f if they were found to be deficient in combativeness. Some of the men were evi dently much distressed, but they had been kept under arms in the sun for a Jong time before the parade began; and the temperature in the shade on this afternoon was at one time over 115° Fahrenheit. The proceedings were watched by a crowd of some thousand Baghdadis, who had mostly walked two or three miles in blazing heat to be present. Carriages were being hired at a lirah for the occasion. The sight of the troops seemed to evoke much enthusiasm, and some of them were loudly and spontaneously applauded as they swung past. One could feel that here at last was something in which Turk and ’Iraqi might take a common pride; and an indistinct vision of Turkey unified by military patriotism at times flitted before the mind. On the whole the display was highly creditable to the new military adminis tration, bearing witness as it did to the establishment at least of authority and discipline. (2) It was observed at this review that a number of mud barracks, similar to the lines of native troops in India, had already been constructed to replace the * s™ last Summary, V-2. tent8 of which* the standing camp at pre- sent consists. These erections were still unroofed, but quantities of poles and rafters are now being obtained by public con tribution. The Wali, it appears, has made'an assessment of all well-to-do Turkish aubjects for the purpose ; and the father of the honorary dragoman of the American Consulate, M. Kouyoumdjian, who had been put down in Nazim Pasha's list for £ T. 6 and offered £ T. 4 only, found himself in the end obliged to pay £ T. 10 in order to avoid disagreeable consequences. (3) Non-Muhammadan recruits are still being caked up in the Musal Wila- yat. About the end of June Dawudiyah, ’Aqrah and Dahuk supplied a few Christian, and Zakho, ’Aqrah and Amadiyah about a score of Jewish recruits, Muhammadan recruit's also continue to be received from abroad for the regiments of the 4th Army Corps now serving in the 6th Ordu. On the 18th of June 60 such recruits for the 31st and 32nd Regiments arrived at Musal from Diyarbakr. (4) The Christian and Jewish Ihtiyat of Baghdad were dismissed to their homes after the review of the 23rd July. It appears to be intended that the re gular garrisons at out-stations which are centres fpr calling up the Ihtiyat shall be replaced in future by the Ihtiyat themselves. These reservists will be summoned in batches for a period of 45 days’ training per annum each, thus supplying a permanent Ihtiyat garrison at eaph Ihtiyat centre. The regular troops set free t See last Summary, V-ll. . wil1 be added to the StriHngf force in pro- cess of organization at Baghdad.8 - r (5) In the Kirkuk military district the 3rd battalion of the 31st Kegiment,' except two companies, and an entire battery of mountain artillery were withi drawn, after the middle of June, from ’Aqrah to Musal. All the embodied Radii battalions serving in the Musal Wilayat have how been disbanded in the same manner as those in the Baghdad Wilayat. These measures confirm, the idea that a settlement* with the Shaikh of Baraizan • See I-i above. ^ impending; but it is possible that a mili tary post may be retained at the village of Baraizan. (6) A number of new military appointments are announced. Lieutenant- Colonel Fahim Bey has been placed in command of the 21st (Baghdad) Infantry Brigade, and the following have obtained command of the regiments noted against their names:— Lieutenant-Colonel Rasib Bey Major Hasan Bey Major Ramzi Bey Lieutenant-Colonel Yusuf Bey Lieutenant-Colonel Raif Bey - 'i ■ Lieutenant-Colonel Fuad Bey 31st Cavalry Regiment. 32nd ,, &gt;&gt; 34th „ „ 42nd Infantry Regiment. 43rd „ „ 44th All the above, with the exception of Major Hasan Bey who is an ex-President of the Committee of Union and Progress at Baghdad, are officers whom Nazim Pasha brought with him from Europe. Shamil Pasha, who was till lately Commandant of the troops at Basrah, has been placed in charge of the whole Radif of the 21st (Baghdad) Division ; and the 41st Brigade of Radif, comprising half the Radif of the said division, has gone to Colonel ’Abdul Jabbar Bey.

His son Daud Bey, a cavalry officer and aide-de-camp to the present and to the late Wali has also been permitted to resign on the ground of being an only son and his father's sole assistant in the management of his property, one of the principal items of which is a valuable stud of mares. Father and son have now retired from their town house at Baghdad, which is threatened by the new street, to their estate of Dawar down the Tigris. I have now ascertained that Muhammad Pasha is an actual nephew of the famous Shamil of Caucasian celebrity. A number of the older military officers of the 6th Ordu are being reduced to despair by the present changes; but few of them can afford to forfeit their pensions by resigning before the completion of their qualifying service. (7) On the 16th of July 39 pupils of the Udadiyah ’Askari (Military School) at Baghdad left for Constantinople to join the college for cadets there. Their average age was 17 to 18 years. (8) It appears that Nuri§ Bey’s practical connection with the gendarmerie v r has not ceased, and Nazim Pasha still § See last Summary, V-6. seems to treat him with disfavour.

Kamal Bey, and MajorSaibf Bey; to whom may perhaps be added Sirop Efieadi. Ihese appear to be his real confidential advisers upon all matters; in private life his relations are almost exclusively with them; and the'four first-named attend him everywhere. EramJ Bey, the political Secretary of the Wilayat, does not appear to be mclud- t See last Summary, V-7. ed in this coterie. With reference to him I now learn that his father, Artin Effendi, was at one time employed in the Telegraph Department, and afterwards became Dragoman of the W ilayat, that Artm s brother, Rubain Effendi, was Dragoman of the Wilayat in the time of Midhat Pasha ; and that a sEter of Rubain Effendi’s wife married Captain Felix Jones of the Indian Navy, who commanded the British slaticnnaire at Baghdad 50 or 60 years ago and afterwards became Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. Mrs. Felix Jones was the daughter of an Armenian contractor from Constantinople, Anton Stambuli, who settled at Baghdad. These details are interesting but of no practical importance. (10) On the 26th of July ’Ali§ Kamal Bey, Saib Bey, and ’Ali Najib Bey left § See the annexure to Summary quoted above Baghdad for Karbala, Kufah and Najaf in margin. on a tour G f i nS p ec ti 0 n. On the morning of the 29th of July ’Ali Kamal Bey and Saib Bey returned from Najaf to Karbala; and after only an hour’s rest they set out again for Tawairij, whence they returned to Karbala in the evening. This extraordinary display of energy at a most unfavourable time of the year has caused much speculation in the old- world places through which their route lay. (11) A mixed-military and civil commission has been formed to recommend changes in the territorial organhation of the Radif by battalion centres, and, concurrently, to report on the suitability of the existing civil administrative divisions (Qadhas and Nahiyahs) of the Baghdad Wilayat. The military mem- || See annexure already quoted in the margin bers are Lieutenant-Colonel || Rasim Bey abo T e ' . and Major Yasim Efiendi of the staff, and Sahm Effendi, a captain of infantry.

In the early morning there were sports for the cavalry and an inspection of the Gendarmerie Training School, both near the North Gate. The cavalry events included a nine-mile race by selected half troops on the road from Ba’qubah, also swimming competition^ in the river Tigris for mounted and unmounted men! At the gendarmerie inspection recruits were sworn in the presence of the Wali, and demonstrations of practical wor£ (surrounding and capturing armed robbers etc.) were given. I noticed that a few Christian and Jewish recruits were sworn in by their own priests on their own scriptures, and that their part of the ceremony was introduced in the middle of the proceedings, apparently in order that they might not come either before or after the Muhammadans. The American Consul (Mr. Simpich) and myself were the only two European spectators of these early functions. The Wali’s official reception at the sarai was held between 11 o’clock and 12 noon by European time. The consular body were at fEst informed that plain clothes would be the order of the day; but at the last moment it was announced that, under instructions from Constantinople, full uniform must be worn.

(14) Further information about the Baghdad branch of the Committee of Union and Progess is now available. An election held soon af.ter the beginning of July resulted in the elevation of ’Abdul Qadir (Khadhairi) to the Presidentship of the First Club. The Second Club” is not at Baghdad but at Kadhimain. The other principal officials of the First Club are:— Vice-President. —Ya’qub Pasha Tsai, brother of Yusuf Tsai. Secretary.— Effendi, a Christian lawyer, brother-in-law of Mr. Rosario, Head Clerk of this Residency. Treasurer. —A. Apigian, an Armenian merchant, related to Eram Bey, the Political Secre tary of the Wilayat. Librarian .—Sikandar ’Aziz, a Christian, at one time Dragoman of the^ilayat and lately Dragoman to Mr. Medlicott, the representative of Sir William W illcocks.

Member of Committee. —Haji Judi, ChalabL ^ The First Club have lately transferred their place of meeting fromtheLaw Schools to what was, in the time of the old British Residency, the Residency Sureeon’s house. This building was until lately occupied as a club by the Naquib of Baghdad, a Jamilzadha, and various other reputed reactionaries. News of the “ plot ” against the present Government of Turkey recently “fdiscovered ” at Constantinople was first communicated to me by Bram Bey, Political Secretary, on the 26th of July. He said that his information was deriv ed Rom Fournier^ telegrams, which theWali now daily receives from Constan tinople Eram Bey said that the prime mover m the plot was Sharif Pasha, an opponent of the Committee of Union and Progress, who edits a monthly new - paper called the Mecheroutiette a,t Paris. I may note that two copies of this journal were recently delivered to me here through the Turkish Post Office from which it would appear that the Postal Department, at any rate, is not ent y under the control of the committee, for no precautions had been taken to cone the title of the paper. According to Eram Bey there is no real difference be tween Sharif Pasha’s party and that of the committee m principle, hut each wishes tobe in power and to exclude the other, and their personal interests are thus irreconcileabie. (151 Complaintshaving been made at Constantinople regarding the appomt- (10) Bompiai g menti' of Sirop Effendi to the Director- tSee last Summary, y-8. ^ of tlie ^kish line of river steamers fNflhrivah) on the ground of bis former bankruptcy, Nazim Pasha reported to the Ministerof Finance 8 that the receipts of the li£e during 19 days that the Effend. had been in charge exceeded by £ T. 800, its receipts during the corresponding period of last year. On the 5th of July, accordingly, the Minister sent a telegram confirming Sirop Effendi in the appointment and ordering his predecessor, I Pasha, to transfer all records, etc., to his charge. H6) The irrigation works on the Euphrates appear to be proceeding as we as scanty financial provision and the uncertain future of both staff and works willallow, repairs to the Old Hindiyah Barrage, excavations for the New Hindiyah Barrage, brickmaking, etc., are being carried on at an expenditure of about £ T 1,000 a week, chiefly on labour; and about £ T. 500 a month is being laid out in procuring stone, lime, etc., from Hit. A bridge for a light railway to carry materials over the Hillah branch to the site of the New Barrage is also in hand. The repairs to the Old Barrage were undertaken at the urgent instance of the Wali, who is very anxious to get water to Hillah somehow; but Mr. Medlicott has warned him that the closing of the present breaches may merely cause the decrepit structure to give way in other places. Should the operation succeed, a sum of about £ T. 10,000 will next be required to deepen the channel of the Hillah branch of the Euphrates. Since £ T. 23,000 was received in May,* no further remittances on account o f T7n the irrigation works have arrived from * See Summary for April-May 1910, V-9. Constantinople, and anxiety for the future is again beginning to be felt. I think I can conjecture the cause of the stoppage. The Wali is reported to have telegraphed to Constantinople for more funds. Some £ T. 9,000 due to Messrs. Blcckey, Cree &amp; Co., of Baghdad, for materials and plant has now been paid up, also about £ T. 2,000 due to a British firm at Basrah for forwarding stores by the Euphrates to the Hindiyah Barrage. Out standing obligations to European firms still amount to approximately, £T. 11,000, but no fresh ones have been incurred by Mr. Medlicott since a good understanding was arrived at between him and the Wali. The agency for local services at Baghdad has been transferred from Messrs* . Blockey, Cree and Co. to Messrs. Apigian, Brothers, relations of the Wali’s Politica 1 Secretary. The whole situation is most unsatisfactory except in one respect, viz., that the Wali now seems inclined to treat the Chief Engineer with some degree of confidence, and even to accept hiss opinions to a limited extent. His Excellency has requested Mr. Medlicott, who is now travelling down the Euphrates to report to him on the navigability of that river and the best means of improving it; but this of course is a matter outside the domain of irrigation. The position of the British engineers on the works is most unenviable. They are attacked in the newspapers; they are exposed to taunts of approaching dismissal and disgrace ; and their assailants in some cases are their former, perhaps even their present, non- British colleagues. M. Cugnin, a French engineer, whose work did not, I believe, give satisfaction, and Santo Semo, a Turkish or Jewish enginner who was actually dismissed from Sir William Willcocks’ staff for professional inefficiency, are be lieved to be both at Constantinople at the present time, actively engaged in under mining the position of their former chief. In the case of one false and malicious libel relating to lime contracts, in a local newspaper, the Wali has signified his readiness to approve of a prosecutioii, provided that a lawyer is first consulted and considers that there is a chance of success. (17) The law whch prohibits the practice of medicine in Turkey by persons not possessing a diploma of the Constantinople faculty has suddenly been appplied at Karbala in all its rigour. The agent of this revolutionary change is the Matasarrif, but he appears to have taken action most reluctantly at the instance of one Rafi Effendi, a Sanitary Inspector lately sent by Nazim Pasha from Bagh dad. The population of Karbala is about 60,000 souls and the number of per sons needing medical attendance every day is estimated at 300. In cor sequence of the enforcement of the law the whole town has suddenly become dependent for medical aid upon a single licensed practitioner—the Sanitary Inspector himself— and a number of native physicians, chiefly Persians and Indians, by whom the sick were hitherto for the most part attended, have lost their means of livelihood. The Inspector is of course placed in a position to charge any fee that he pleases 5 and his usual honorarium is reported to be much higher than that of th e hakims, his predecessors, and equally beyond the means of the generality of th e inhabitants of Karbala. In order, it is supposed, to ensure the enforcement of th e law, the headmen of wards have been ordered to report all cases of sickness to thek A authorities ; and burials without a death certificate from the Inspector have been prohibited. There is much dissatisfaction in the town; some think that to insist on the medical examination of the female dead may in the end lead to riots. Telegrams on the subjects were sent to the Wali of Baghdad by Saiyid Muhammad (Kashi), Saiyid Isma’il (Sadr), and Saiyid Muhammad Baqir (Tabata- bayi), of whom the first and the last receive allowances as Mujtahids nndcr the Oudh bequest, Saiyid Muham mad Kashi seems to have hinted at the possibility of disturbances ; and Nazim. Pasha, who first ordered him to be informed that the law of the country could net be changed, has now, after furtner enquiry, directed him to be prosecuted on the charge of disseminating a false and alarming rep 31 1. The question of unlicensed practitioners seems likely* to come up in a serious TV „ shape at Baghdad before long ; and I have * See Summary for June 1910 , accordingly reported on the subject in anticipation to Hi? Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and sent a copy of my despatch to the Government of India. (18) On the 5th of July the v ' ali informed the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce that in future all mercantile tran actions must be carried on in terms of the newf piastre; it seems that the change in pecu- t See last Summary, V-16. niary notation actually came into effect from the 21st of June. On the 17th of July, in reply to an official enquiry on my part, His Excellency wrote that, under orders which he had issued, foreign silver had ceased to be legal tender at Baghdad. This platonic resolution has so far been ignored by the trading classes, and fortunately so, for, if the Qran and other Persian silver coins should cease to circulate, the shortage of change here would at once become a most momentous question. The reduction of the number of piastres in the lirah from 108 to 102-6 is by itself a sufficiently inconvenient change. At the end of July I was obliged to purchase, at a loss to Government, the change required to make up the broken amounts due to the sepoys of the Residency Guard on account of their pay for the past month; the alternative was to throw the expense of breaking up the lump sum, paid from the Treasury in gold, upon the native officer commanding the detachment or upon the men themselves. (19) A daily{ letter post in both directions between Baghdad and Karbala has now been instituted ; but registered letters X See Summary for April, May 1910, V-2. can on jy sen £ once a W eek, as before. (20) The Ihtisab, Baitiyah and Tamgha taxes§ were actually abolished at Karbala with effect from the 14,th of July. § See Summary Vt 16. From the same date the following taxes were suddenly done away with in the Baghdad Municipality, (i) The Chadar or Tent Tax, (li) The Qayiq or Boat Tax, ( ii) The Dallaliyah or Brokerage Tax, ( v) The Dayirman or Mill Tax, (v) The Ihraqiyah or Fuel Tax, and (vi) The Kuyumjiyah or Goldsmiths’ Tax, None of these brought in much revenue ; but their summary abolition, appa rently under Act of Parliament, may serve as a warning to financiers who are inclined to lend money to Turkish municipalities upon the security of particular revenues. The abolition of the Turabiyah tax has been carried out at Karbala and Najaf, but only in favour of Turkish subjects; and the position of foreigners in respect of interment fees is now worse than ever. Hitherto burial in the “ v adi ” or sacred cemetery outside either place was free to all, whether Turkish subjects or aliens; but now, if the deceased is a foreign subject, a fee of 40 G.S. piastres (about 7 shiiiingi) must be paid for the privilege of interment in the “ ' adi. ” This new exaction is a bitter one for the poverty-stricken Persians and Indians who are numerous at the Holy Cities. (21) Tazkirat Marur, the travelling passports hitherto required for the purpose pf journeying from one Turkish province into another, have been abolished in ’Iraqfrom the 14th of July. This is a really useful reform; for these internal passports served no useful purpose. (22) Arabic petitions are again being accepted at the sarai, and official corre spondence with the tribes conducted, as previously, in Arabic. The substitution* of Turkish was found impossible in practice. ♦See Summary for April-May 1910, V-13. VI.—PERSIAN AFFAIRS. (1) Already before the commencement of July, considerable unrest appeared to prevail in the provinces of Persia adjoining ’Iraq. Towards the end of May war was said to have been declared between the Dawud Khan, chief of the Kalhur Kurd, and the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the Persian Governor of Kirmanshah. Early in June hostilities took place between them with, it was said, some loss on both sides; and downward caravans from Persia were for a time detained at Kirman shah, and upward caravans from Baghdad at Kirind. Later there were rumours of the withholding of Government taxes by the population of Hamadan and of armed disturbances in that district. At the beginning of July Turkish military reinforcements were said to be in course of despatch to the frontier at Khanaqin, and I addressed a telegraphic request for information about passing events to the British Consulate at Kirmanshah. (2) The latter part of June was the time selected by Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) and Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazandarani), the well-known Mujtahids of Najaf, to issue an unexpected political manifesto. The Khurasani was smarting at the time under . „ . 4 „ VT 0 the indignity of his representationsf on behalf of two reactionary Persian refugees at Najaf being rejected by the Turkish authorities and ignored by the Persian Gov ernment. The joint manifesto took the form of a telegram, dated 22nd June 1910, and addressed through the Nasir-ul-Mulk at Tehran to the Regent, the Ministers of the Interior and of \\ ar, and the President of the National Assembly; it was also printed as a broad-sheet at Najaf and widely distributed in this country. It recapitulated the objects of constitutional reform in Persia; con demned the existing Government as a body of wasteful^ greedy and irreligious place-seekers, untrue to the principles of the constitution; complained of the intolerable taxes imposed by them “ on everything from white salt to black charcoal ” and accused them of fomenting discord in the nation, of suppressing the decreesof the Mujtahids, and of stirring up rebellions with no other purpose than that of preventing the withdrawal of the troops of foreign powers from Persia. It denounced the party in power as lovers of Parisian liberty, and advised them “ to take the road to their beloved ” ere a worse thing happened to them, threatening them in the alternative with destruction. It demanded various immediate reforms, in particular the reorganization of the army, the codification of the laws of the realm under ecclesiastical superintendence, and the censorship of the press by a committee of “ men well-versed in theology and politics. ” Like all Persian public documents it is a turgid and confused pro duction; but it clearly aims at the overthrow of the Government and the establish ment of religious control over secular affairs ; and in the latter respect at least it may fairly be described as reactionary. I forwarded a copy of this manifesto, as soon as an opportunity occurred, to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, having previously apprised him of its contents by telegram. (3) On the 9th of July His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed me of the flight of the Taqizadah, apparently a leader of the party denounced by the Mujtahids, from Tehran in consequence of their fulminations, and enquired whether he and any other members of the Persian Parliament had been excommunicated by the Najaf leaders. I replied, according to the best information available, that the Taqizadah, also Mirza Ahmad, member for Tabriz, and Mirza Yahya (Daulatabadi), probably representing Kifman, had been frequently denounced by the political Muj tahids of Najaf and their expulsion from Persia demanded; but that, so far as was known, they had not been religiously excommunicated. I was subsequently inform ed that they had been secretly excommunicated two months previously and the bulls of excommunication sent to Persia, but I doubt the truth of this statement. A certain Mas’ud-ul V, azarah is now said to have been excommunicated also.(4) The next event in chronological order in Persia was the assassination w ine cv &amp; Saiyid Abdullah (Behbeham), at Tehran on the mg Moderate party to whch the Khurasani and the apparently the head of m this C0UIltr y is beHeVed Mazandaram of Najafat profess to beloj and wn ^ At £ arba]a and to include Satar Khan, Baqir Kh P o{ the Radica]s to the Najaf the murder of *jj^tahids of Najaf. I note, however, that it manifes to o i 1 formation of a new and apparently Radical cabinet at Tetiif^rh for all that is known here, it may have been connected rather with that event. (51 Saivid 'Abdullah’s death was shortly preceded by the deportation of the O) saiyia auuu Jmam* Jum eh Abul Qasim, the Persian ♦See last Summary, VI-2. reactionary, from this country by the Turkish authorities, who on the 14th of July despatched him by carriage to Ikpjo under a gendarmerie guard. This man is said to enjoy Russian protec- tioh in Persia. T . .. . The supposed Persian reactionary agent Mirza 'Ah (Isfahan!), who was arrest- , .n 11 , T„ n „ 1,,., since been publ c y examined at the Persian Con- ed t at Kadhimain in June, has since at Baghdad and the papers t See last Summary, Vi-io. ^ possession scrutinised; and it appears. that there is really no evidence against him. He has now been released on bail at the instance of Mulla Kazim. „ r + v, o (61 The murder of Saiyid 'Abdullah (Behbeham) at Tehran seems to have 0) ; 1Mlt H,e snirit of his ally, the Khurasani, at Najaf. Before that ' U entlat Mm^lud was aheady hard pressed by the Radical Haiat’Ilmiyah association of Najaf; his supporters were daily going over to his chief rival, Saivid Kazim (Tabatabayi, Yazdi), who has until now abstained from politics, and his reactionary manifesto had caused him to be regarded by many as a fickle and untrust worthy man. Since the assassination he believes that his own life is hi danger having in fact received more than one warning by telegram ; he has given up lecturingV night; and he never leaves his house, even in the day time, without! considerable escort of students. Two Persian pilgrims were lately arrested by the Persian Consulate at Najaf at his instance, on suspicion of being Babis sJnt to murder him. The streets of Najaf have more than once been found littered in the morning with Shabnamehs or “night letters” attaching the Khurasam; and pasquinades upon his followers appear written upon walls His principal supporter, Mirza Husain Nazim, has disappeared and is supposed to have gone lllt0 Mulk^Kazim is said lately to have received from the Shaikh-ul-Islam at Con stantinople a telegram of remonstrance on his conduct, which was described as harm- ful to the interests of the Muhammadan world in genera . _ The news of Saiyid 'Abdullah's death was received almost with mdifTerence at the holy cities; besides agitating Mulla Kazim and his associate Shaihh ’Abdullah it only caused' a little confusion among young students, who for the moment pressed that all the Mujtahids of Karbala and Najaf must combine and think of some plan to prevent Mulla assassination and insult m Persia. _ (71 During the last week in July reports were current hereof disturbances in differ ent parts of Persia, and of the assassination, or attempted assassination, of various ecclesiastical reactionaries, including Saiyid Muhammad Imam Ju^h, of Tehran, brother of the Saiyid Abul Qasim lately ^f^ountry some $ See Summary for March 1910, VI-4. months ago, is also said to have perished along with his son. „ n r» h (81 Details of the composition of the new Persian cabinet did-not reach Bagh dad until the 2nd of August; not a single one of the new ministers appears o e known to the Persians in this country except by name ; unless it be Nawab Hussain Quli Khan, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is credited here with pro- British sentiments. (91 At the middle of July it was announced that the Iftikhar-ul-Mulk had been appointed to the Persian Consulate-General at Baghdad : but it is thought that, in consequence of the change of Government, he may not now come. He sa: tit foi in at d* St;said to have been formerly Persian Consul-General at Constantinople with the title of Iftikhar-ul-Hukama. The Baghdad appointment has stood vacant now for nearly five months—an unaccountable piece of negligence on the part of Persia in a country where she claims to have 50,000 subjects. The Persian Consul-General at Baghdad is frequently spoken of as the Ailchi or Envoy,—a proud title probably dating back to the time when Baghdad was a Pashaliq almost independent of Con stantinople. (10) The Yamin-ul-Mulk,* the last Persian Consul-General at Baghdad, is said to have obtained Russian nationality and to be now residing in Syria (Lebanon). See Summary for March 1910, VI-5. (11) The breachf between the Wali of Baghdad and the Acting Persian Consul- tSee last Summary, vi-7. General has been healed. The first step towards a reconciliation was taken by Nazim Pasha, who under peremptory orders from Constantinople, or so it is con jectured, sent an aide-de-camp on the 8th of July to enquire for the Acting Ailchi’s health. The latter was present afterwards at the Wall's official reception on the day of the Turkish National Fete. Meanwhile,’probably with reference to the cause of the original dispute, the Wali has been instructed to pay all bills of army contractors having reference to a period from the beginning of July 1324 A. H. to the end of that year. (12) The Turkish authorities are deliberating on the possibility of obliging the Mujtahids of Karbala and Najaf to close their ecclesiastical courts, and that of compelling all litigants to resort to the Government tribunals. At Karbala there are four Mujtahids who sit regularly in judgment and several who do so occasion ally. About 80 per cent, of the law-suits at Karbala are settled in the Mujtahids’ Courts where Shi’ah law is dispensed ; and most of the inhabitants of the town, being Shi'ahs, do not regard the decision of the Turkish Shara court, which is Sunni, as religiously binding. (13) I have been privately informed by Lieutenant-General Nuri Bey, com manding the Baghdad Cavalry Division, t See last Summary, VI-9. that the place Naghadad,J probably the same as Nagirde, near the disputed Turko-Persian frontier, undoubtedly belongs to Persia. As Nuri Bey was employed for some time in the disputed tract in a military capacity, and as he is a- staunch advocate of the extreme Turkish claim generally, this admission on his part is important. VII.— Najd Affairs. (1) It is reported here that Ibn Rashid lately made a very successful raid upon , ^ x a TTTT , some Arab tribes in the vicinity of Madain § See last Summary, VIM. ^ ^ ig probably the same ag that mentioned§ last month. (2) News comes from Karbala of a rapprochement between Ibn Rashid, Ibn Sa’ud, and the Shaikh of Kuwait, apparently in view of apprehended encroach ments of the Turks upon all three. A disposition on the part of the chiefs men tioned to seek the support of the British Government is also asserted to exist. I cannot say whether these rumours are deserving of credence. (3) It is supposed that about the beginning of July the Governor-Gemral of Baghdad wrote to Ibn Rashid, asking him to expedite the despatch of two mem bers of his own family to Baghdad, If this is corre t, it may be that the Amir is „ „ , TTTT „ temporisingll with demands by the Wali, See last Summary, VII-3. ., , r . V 1 . , i i • that suspicion has been awakened m the Amir's mind, and that there is some foundation for the reports of negotiations between Hail, Riyadh and Kuwait. I am informed by the British Political Agent at Kuwait that the Wali of Basrah seems to be occupying himself with the status of Kuwait. VIII.— British Interests. (1) In connection with the widening of an existing street at Baghdad, some difficult questions have arisen between this Consulate-General and the Wilayat.16 On the 18th of July Mr. Parry, the European manager of Messrs. S'. Lynch &amp; Co at Baghdad, was informed that a wall and six shops, the property of his firm would be demolishd under a municipal regulation as insecure and dangerous ; and on the same day I wrote officially to the Wall requesting that the proposed demolition might be postponed in order to allow of its being duly considered. On (I think) the 25th of July I personally inspected the wall and shops and found that they were perfectly safe. On ' he 27th c f July Messrs ’Abdul ’Ali, Brothers, a British Indian firm, receiv ed a notice similar to Mr. Parry’s with reference to their principal shop, which is the property of a British Armenian subject, Mr. G. Thaddeus, the Accountant (retired on pension) of this Residency. The same day Mr. M. Thaddeus, the son of the owner went by my advice to the President of the Municipality and requested a postponement on the ground that the general question of expropriations was 1 1 under discussion* between the Consul- * See paragraph 2 below. General and the Wall. He did not, how ever, obtain any satisfaction. On the 28th of July I visited the threatened shop, which from its situation alone is a valuable property, in company with Mr. Thaddeus, junior. It also was found to be in good condition and not in any way dangerous. I then paid a private visit to the President of the Municipalitysand protested vigorously to him against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public. The President, in confidence, agreed with me That the pretext was really false ; but he regretted that he had no power to stay the operations, which he said were being carried through with a high hand by Jawad Bey, one of the Wali’s military staff 6 On my return to the Residency I forwarded officially to the Wali peti tions from Messrs. ‘Parry and Thaddeus, senior, in which they protested against the incorrectness of the reason assigned for the demolition of the properties, and prayed that the municipality might be restrained from unjustifiable action. In forwarding the petitions I remarked that I had visited the premises in question, and had satisfied myself by personal inspection that neither was in a dangerous condition. On the 29th of July I informed His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Con stantinople, by telegram, of the position of affairs. Up to the end of July the Wali had not replied to either of my official com munications. He is exceedingly anxious to proceed with his schemes of munici pal improvement; and, the municipality having no funds at present to meet the cost of legal expropriations, he has perhaps adopted the present procedure as a substitute in the two above cases. (2) As regular expropriations affecting British subjects are likely to take place as soon as money is available, I have been careful to open the question of these with the Wilayat in good time. With this object I wrote officially to the Wali on the 22nd of July requesting that I might be informed whether any land or buildings owned by British subjects would be required in connection with approaching public improvements at Bagh dad, also of the official estimate that had been formed of the value of each pro perty, and of the particular law under which each expropriation would take place. Gn the 26th of July the Wali’s Political Scretary came to see me and we dis cussed the whole matter at length with reference to the Turkish laws of immove able property owned by foreigners (16th June 1867), Expropriation (15th May 1879). and Buildings (22nd August 1891). I contended that my consular inter vention was admissible under article 2 (1) of the first named law, which while ex cluding it in the case of enjoyment, inheritance, alienation and mortgage made no mention, though the definition was evidently meant to be exhaustive, of the case of expropriation. I also took the opportunity to 1 criticise the present Turkish law of expropriation, under which the quarter of a man’s immoveable property may be taken from him without any compensation. Eram Bey did not of course admit the force of anything that I said ; and fur ther private correspondence with him, between the 26th and 28th July, was barren.C 746 FD Neither private nor official relations have been disturbed by these discussions, though I was obliged in the end to intimate that I should probably be compelled to refer to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. (3) Two cases of unwarrantable interference with British merchants have also occurred. In the first of these cases, Messrs ’Abdul ’Ali, Brothers, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual charge. The same orders were given to the lessee of the municipal ice machine. In thtysecpnd case all owners, of oil engines in municipal limits were suddenly informed, on the 27th of July, that they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town. This edict affected two British firms, viz., Messrs, Blockey, Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blaney and Solomon, who own flour-mills driven by oil-engines in the town. I lost no time in protesting demi-officially against both these acts of interfer ence as illegal under Turkish law; and, having failed to obtain any satis factory reply, I telegraphed to the Embassy on the 31st July. I subsequently learned that the orders about oil-engines had been withdrawn on the evening of the 30th, and it is said to have been afterwards repudiated by the Wali; but Messrs. ’Abdul ’Ali are still being obliged to sell their ice at a greatly reduced rate. (4) On the 13th of July the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany’s new steamer Julnar arrived at Baghdad with the British mails from Basrah. She is a novelty on the Tigris, having twin screws instead of the hitherto universal paddles ; her speed appears to be greater than that of any of the Turkish boats ; and her cargo-carrying capacity is estimated by the Director of the Nahriyah line at 500 tons, or double that of his own largest steamer the Baghdad. She has some defects which are prqbably remediable, in particular an extremely high temperature in the stokehole. The J ulnar replaces the Blosse Lynch, which I understand the Wall of Basrah has officially intimated wifi not be allowed by the Turkish Government, in any circumstances, to navigate either the Tigris or the Euphrates again. In this way the company are prevented from possessing a reserve steamer for use above Qurnah. (5) Early in July the native papers here contained unfavourable articles on the supposed intention of some British capitalists to seek, through the British Government, a concession for a railway between Baghdad and Basrah. (6) On the 7th of July the watchmen over the British cemetery at Baghdad reported that the precincts had been entered that morning shortly before sunrise by two individuals, apparently Turkish soldiers, who, before they could be pre vented, partly defaced the gravestones of a Captain and Mrs. Clements. The matter was reported to the Turkish authorities. These showed a laudable anxiety to assist in tracing the offenders, and even offered to parade all the sol diers in the standing camp adjacent for inspection. As there was some reasop for distrusting the story of the watchmen, however, the Resident did not avail himself of the offer, which might have resulted in a false identificatiQn. The principal cause of the outrage, whoever the offenders,. re a y ;have been, was . undoubtedly the open* state of the cemetery * See Summary for Apnl-May 1010, V I -9. - ^ ^ *, but the enclosure Wall is now* at length being rebuilt and will vety soon be finished. IX.— British Official Matters. (1) I see no prospect of being able to leave Baghdad on tour as long as the new Local Government maintain their present energy and inventiveness. Every day brings forth something new; and foreigners here, whether officials or non-officials, cannot but feel uneasy as to the nature of each successive develop ment. When I appeal against the municipality to the Wali, I am told that it is independent of his control; and, when I criticise His Excellency’s own actions by the law, I am given unofficially to understand that he is above it. , ■£ j ' -f-l.i...- ■ . &gt;j . l a i a.c :) t ''' - (2) On the 12th of July 1910 the Governor-General addressed the representa tive of the Euphrates arid Tigris Steam Navigation Company at Baghdad direct,requiring him, for reasons of police, to alter the hour of departure of the down mail steamer, in order that it should take place by daylight. Mr. Parry, I think wrongly, complied without reference to this Residency ; accordingly, to prevent the case from becoming a precedent, I wrote to the Wall's Political Secretary pointing out that His Britannic Majesty's mails were liable to be affected by changes in the company’s time-table and requesting that such matters might be arranged through me in future. The tone of the reply was propitiatory but evasive, and I am not sure that further direct interference with the company's arrangements may not be attempted* (3) Early in July I was privately requested by the Wali to obtain for him from India 100 kilogrammes of dynamite, with submarine firing apparatus, which he required for removing rocks and other obstacles to navigation in the Tigris and Euphrates. His Excellency undertook to pay all the charges incurred. On receiving the information by telegram the Government of India have kindly directed the required articles to be consigned to me from Bombay by the Ord nance Department. (4) On the 22nd of July I visited the Turkish jail at Baghdad which is situated in the Qal’ah (citade 1 ), for the purpose of an interview with two prisoners, Asiatic British subjects, who have long been under trial for murder. It had been wrongly understood that I only wanted to see one of the men; and he had been sent to the lock-up in the Sarai before my arrival at the jail, probably in the hope of averting my visit to the latter, though facilities for this had been promised. By persisting in my claim to see the second prisoner, however, I at length obtained admittance to the jail entrance, to which he was brought for my inspection. I found him in good condition and without complaint, except on the subject of his case. (5) At the beginning of July one Jawwad-bin-Muhammad, who produced evidence of being a British subject and of having been sent to purchase mules for the Government of India, reported himself at this Consulate-General, Hav ing enquired of the Political Secretary to the Wilayat, and been informed by him privately that there was&gt; “no prohibition ” on the exportation of mules, I allowed Jawwad to proceed on his journey. After his departure I received, to my surprise, an official letter from the Secretary, in which he stated for the first time that mules proposed, to be exported must be shown to a military committee, and that this committee had power to take them over itself, on payment, for the Turkish Army. Against this apparent after-thought, if Jawwad returns via Baghdad, it may be necessary to protest: but I understood from him that he would most probably make his purchases in Persia and ship his animals from a Persian port. My knowledge that the Turks were finding difficulty in provid ing their 6th Army Corps with remounts and transport was the cause of my reference to the Political Secretary, and it seems probable that the latter is to blame for the mistake which has occurred. (6) Ahmad Faizi Bey, who has been Nadhir or principal officer of customs in this province during the last three years, has been summoned to Constantinople. He left Baghdad on the 14th of July. He expects to meet the British customs adviser to the Porte at Constantinople, and he therefore begged me to give him a certificate, which, after consulting the chief British firms here, I was able to do, and to state that he had given entire satisfaction during his term of office at Baghdad. At Constantinople he should at least be able to explain the local con ditions at Baghdad to the British customs adviser. (7) Garden parties were given by the Resident in the Residency grounds on the 9th and 30th of July. On either occasion about 80 guests, including the Wali and his staff, were present. On the evening of the 21st July the Y ali and his Political Secretary dined at the Residency with the French Consul and other European guests. (8) A non-commissioned officer of the Residency Guard, having shown signs of mental disturbance, was sent away from Baghdad on the 20th of June in charge of another non-commissioned officer and two privates, who accompanied him as far as Bushire. The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf kindly arranged for his onward j ourney, under supervision, from Bushire to Bombay. TheC 746 FD party sent with the Sian from Baghdad returned on the 13th of July. In the present state of Turkish official feeling on the subject, the slightest misbehaviour on the part of a sepoy of the Residency guard might, if it came to the knowledge oi the authorities, be made the subject of a serious complaint. (9) Two-thirds of the Residency guard, who are Muhammadans, have recently made the pilgrimage to Karbala and Najaf, They went in two parties each m charge of a non-commissioned officer and accompanied by a Qawwas • and the first party returned before the second started. They travelled, of course in plain clothes and as ordinary pilgrims. One of the attractions of service’ at Baghdad is the opportunity that it affords of making these pilgrimages, which are considered beneficial even by Sunnis, as the military detachment and crew of the Comet invariably are ; but still more important to them are the shrines of Abdul Qadir at Baghdad itself and Salman Pak at Otesiphon. During the ten day s absence of a party at Karbala and Najaf the remainder of the guard willingly undertake the hegvy extta night duty, .knowing that their comrades have done, or will do, the same in their turn. (10) I have recently reported to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of the grants of the British Vice-Consulate at Musal. Having inspected the Vice-Consulate last May, I consider these grants to be insufficient, if the services M the British officer there are to be turned to the best account. Meanwhile Mr. Gftig has, I understand, received permission to travel in his district at his own expense, and has gone to Sheranis in the hills a few miles to the north of Zakho, which last place is about 70 miles north- Uorth-west of MusaL (ll) At the middle of July I received an application for assistance from a Sudanese woman, named Hajiyah Madinah* who states that she was carried off from her home in the Sudan by slave-dealers a short time after the Anglo-Egyptian occupation of Khartum. Since then she has passed from one hand to another and has been carried as far as Rasht in Persia. I have written to the Sudan Government to ask that her story may be verified, and to enquire whether she should be treated as of British nationality, and whether she can be repatriated at the expense of the Sudan Government as she desires. Meanwhile, as her Owners are probably on her track,, I have requested the Turkish authorities to take precautions against her disappearance. X.—Foreign interests and cases (other than Persian and British). (1) Early in July the Wali endeavoured to induce the consular body at Baghdad to join him in subscribing to Fournier’s agency for a daily news telegram from Constantinople to Baghdad. I declined on the ground of already receiving Reuter’s telegrams, which come to me weekly by steamer from Fao. One or two of the foreign Consuls did subscribe, but eventually their money was returned to them. Nazim Pasha, however, is now receiving a daily Fournier, of which he kindly communicates a copy to me ; and I in return send him copies of Reuter’s weekly as they are received. (2) The case of the American honorary* Dragoman is ' still unsettled * See last Summary, X-4. ?“&lt;•&gt;* does &gt;iot apperr that any defect m his appointment is admitted by the American Consul. Mr. Simpich had applied to me for the services of Mr. Nersessian. the First Dragoman of this Residency, to watch Mr. Kouyoumdjian’s interests in the Turkish courts, and I had referred his requests to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassadar at Constantinople, when matters suddenly took a new turn. This was the result, I understand, of its having been discovered that, under a treaty made between the United States and Turkey in 1830, the Dragcman cannot be tried by the Turks at all, but only by Mr. Simpich himself, the Turks prosecut ing in the American court. In consequence of this development the question seems to have been now transferred to Constantinople, and the Wali is reduced to pretending that this was done at his suggestion, which it was hot, and to refusing to deal with Mr. Simpich through Mr. Kouyoumdjian t asAong as thecase remains undecided. The American Consul has been instructed hy his Embassy to maintain the best terms that he can with,the Wah in view of nego T tiations which are in progress at Constantinople for an American railway in Asia Minor. (3) There is a dispute between the representatives of * the American Liquorice Company (Messrs, MacAndrews, horbes &amp; Co.) and Abdul Qadir * See V-14 above. Pasha* (Khadhairi), regarding the root f See Summary for February 1910 , V-i, and produced by some lands near Salman Pak- that for March i9io ? V-2. This dispute arises out of the difficulty^ between the Mutawallis of the shrine mentipned and the Turkish Treasury, the company apparently having obtained a lease of the lands from the former, and the Khadairi from the latter. On the 10th of July Messrs. , Mills and Moynihan, who had gone to the spot, were successful for some time in prevent ing the K-hadairPs agent and workmen from loading two boats with liquorice from the disputed land; but, after Mr. Miljs’ departure in the afternoon to report at Baghdad, Mr. Moynihan had a personal encounter with the Khadairi's agent, whom he struck with a stick ; and he was jostled and obliged to leave the spot by a Turkish Thabitiyah guard which the local Mudir had sent to be present. At first there appeared a probability of legal action being taken against t i - ^ * Mr. Moynihan, but a considerable time has * t ugust. nowf passed without any notice of pro ceedings. (4) Mr. J. S. Levack, a young Englishman in the employment of the British firm of Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company at BagMckd, has been appointed Honorary Vice-Consul for America. No official reception was held by the Ame rican Consul on the 4th of July, Independence Day. The R. I. M. S. Comet dressed ship as usual. (5) On the 12th of July M. Joseph Asfar, Honorary Consul for Spain, died at Baghdad somewhat suddenly from a qomphcation .• of diseases. i: His estate is said to be insolvent. He was a native of Baghdad and a Turkish subject; but he belonged to the Latin Church and had resided for some time— or at least travelled—in France and Spain. The Spanish Consulate at Baghdad is supposed to have been established at his suggestion, and in that case will prob ably disappear now, as there are no local Spanish interests. , M Asfar was more honoured by the Turkish authorities in death than in life § ' ■ v ' the Wali, who had taken a fancy to him on § See Summary for April-May 1910, X-6. acC ount of his cheerful and vivacious manners, was represented at the funeral by some Turkish military officers; and the cortege was accompanied by a guard of 100, regular Turkish infantry. The employment of Turkish troops at a Christian funeral is adversely commented upon, I am told, in Muhammadan circles, (6) On the 19th of July a scurrilous and misleading article appeared in the Baaib a local newspaper, with reference to M. Asfar’s death. It proceeded: “ He had nothing but kidney disease. The doctors who treated him were the British and the German doctors. They gave digitalis,” and so on. M. Asfar s own physician was Dr. Bahosy, a graduate of Bairut; but, as the case b ecame more serious Dr. Harle (a private German practitioner), Captain McPherson, I. M. b. (the British’Residency Surgeon), and Dr. Johnson (the head of the Church Missionary Society’s Baghdad Mission), were successively called m as consultants, they continued to act,as such until the day before M. Asfar’s death, when a Turkish military doctor, Lieutenant-Colonel Isma’il Bey, was sent by the Wall to offer his services. This practitioner accepted the diagnosis of his predecessors, who received him as a colleague, but he disagreed with their treatment; and the patien was in the end left entirely in his hands. Cantain McPherson and the Resident alike considering that the best way to treat the Raqtfs article was to ignore it altogether; this course has been adopted by them. The Residency Surgeon’s reputation is too estabhs ^ by more than two years’ successful work in Baghdad to be affected by a newspape article. * . - ^ „ ...The German Consulate, however, took up Dr. Harle’s case warmly; and Dr. Hesse even went so far as to insist on a personal interview with the Governor- General, from whom he demanded that action should be taken against the Raqib by the Turkish executive authorities. But the Wali merely replied, as his Political Secretary had done before to the same request, that if Dr. JIarle con sidered that the editor of the Raqib had injured him, he could prosecute or sue him in the courts. The Wali seems to have promised at the same time that the case, if brought, would be expedited as much as possible; but Nazim Pasha has reasons of his own for disliking the editor of the Raqib. Dr. Hnrle appears determined to seek his legal remedy. (7) At the beginning of the month a project for a French railway from Homs to Baghdad was mentioned and unfavourably criticised in the Baghdad newspapers. (8) No official reception was held by the French Consul on the 14th of July, the French National Fete; but in the evening he gave a roof party to French subjects and some other friends. The Comet was dressed all day in honour of the occasion. (9) M. Viollet* is still in this country. He is himself an architect; and financial ly he is said to represent a millionaire named * See last Summary, Xl-2. [y M. Watel of Paris, his maternal uncle. M. Viollet appears to be interested in antiquities, especially Persian, and has sent an agent to ’Afaj to report on the prospect of successful excavations in that district. Meanwhile he has himself twice visited Samarrah with his wife. On the second occasion they employed about 60 workmen for the better part of a month among the ruins of Samarrah of the Caliphatic period ; but I gather that the results were insignificant. (10) According to the editor of the Persian newspaperf Vhhuwwat, who re cently called upon one of the Residency t Sec Summary for Apnl-May 1910 , vi-7. staff, there is some hitch in regard to the X See last Summary,. -1. establishmentJ of a Russian Consulate at Najaf. The editor showed the gentleman whom he visited the draft of an article that he had written on the subject, entitled “ Najaf and Najh—the Keys of the Hijaz ; ” but he admitted that the Russians had probably no object in view at present beyond getting in touch with the Persian Mujtahids in this country, and acquiring some influence over them. (11) The same editor, whose name is Haji Muhammad Taqi (Yazdi), complains that some time ago, having applied to the Russian Consul for information about the Russian troops in Persia, he received in reply a letter bearing M. Orloff’s signature in a hand which was not M. Orloffis and sealed with a cheap clumsy seal of a kind sold here for about a penny halfpenny. In this letter it was stated that the bulk of the Russian troops had, according to official information, already been withdrawn from Persia. I have seen the document, and the facts are as stated by the editor • but I am not sure what construction is to be placed on the facts, even supposing the statement about the withdrawal of the troops not to have been true when it was made, viz., about the end of May. According to the editor it is not the first time that a doubtful statement in such peculiar guise has issued from the Russian Consulate at Baghdad. XI.— Commercial Matters. m The Wall’s scheme for a Turkish § General Development Company with a { ) capital of £T. 100,000 at Baghdad has § See last Summary, xi-7. proved still-born. At the adjourned meeting at the Sarai, which was held on the 13th of July, only about a dozen mer- chants appeared, and these merely announced their unwillingness to enter into the scheme His Excellency was much annoyed, and after telling the merchants that they were too ignorant to understand business, left the room. The meeting was thus dissolved. The backwardness of the merchants is perfectly intelligible in view of Nazim Pasha’s general attitude and procedure. They no doubt foresee that, if the company were formed, its funds, like those of the Baghdad municipality, would be treated by the Wall as entirely at his own disposal(2) On the 19th of July I was visited by the British subject, Haji ’ Ali Muham- ' * See last Summary, Xl-3, 0. ma&lt; ? (Shushtari), who is the member of a native syndicate’ 1 * that aims at a naviga tion concession. He informed me that it was believed that the Baghdad munici pality (in other words, Nazim Pasha) would now put one steamer on the Baghdad- Samarrah run and two steamers on the Baghdad-Basrah run. As the merchant pressed me for advice, I told him that I thought he would do well to wait and see what happened in the matter of the proposed amalgamation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Idarah Nahriyah. (3) The Shushtari also told me that he had sold 2,400 okes of leather to the Turkish military authorities at Baghdad for £ T. 517. They are now in treaty with him for 5,000 additional okes, which he has in stock and is able to supply. They have asked him to undertake a permanent contract for supplying them with leather, but he i as declined to do more than fulfil particular orders. His leather is procured from Muhammad Khalil (Shirazi) of Madras City, India. ! (4) Mr. Princef of Messrs. Cooper, Allen &amp; Co., alias “ The Army Equipment Fac- t See last Summary, X-io. ‘ or y&gt; Cawnpore,” is returning to Baghdad immediately; he was to sail from Bombay on the 4th of August. He is bringing with him transport carts and other samples of Indian military manufactures. He writes: “ I am sure we can equip the whole of the Baghdad Army with everything they require better and cheaper than any other firm in or out of India. The only drawback is that they,” i.e., the Turks, “ are in such a dreadful hurry.” (5) Action was taken by the Government of India on my telegramj reporting + c Q f ™ , that the Chief of the Staff might wish to t bee Summary for Apnl-May 1910, XI-l. . i i i • i -n -n f T t obtain khaki drill uniforms from India, with the result that on the 14th of July Messrs. Spinner &amp; Co., of Bombay, des patched sample uniforms, accompanied by quotations , to my address. The sam ples arrived after the end of the month and were approved in every respect, includ- ing price, by the Chief of the Staff ; but that officer stated that the summer season being nearly over, the matter would now have to stand over until next year. (6) The Turkish authorities seem to be also experimenting in direct orders to Indian firms. Before the middle of July the Wali telegraphed to the Turkish Consul at Bombay to procure at once some ins ruments said to have been des cribed in the telegram as “combs,” for clearing the beds of rivers. Possibly some kind of dredging apparatus was meant. (7) Negotiations in regard to the § See last Summary, XI-2. accepted.

Thornycroffc II See last Summary, xi-8. for the supply of three motor-boats|| by the latter to the former. It is dated 17th June, the day on which His Excellency mentioned the matter to me. The boats are to be 63 feet long, 9| feet in beam, and not more than 3 feet in draft. They are to be capable of carrying a load of 3J tons each; but thev are intended for passenger service, and are to be seated for 30 first-class passengers forward and 20 second-class passengers aft. The engines in each case will be a double set of Thornycroft 4-cylinder motors, working on 'petroleum, and the speed is not to be less than 11 knots an hour. The price of each boat, delivered at Basrah, is fixed at £ 2,100 sterling. I trust that it may not be shown by experience that steam-boats would have been more suitable for the service required, as well as cheaper in respect of initial cost. The Wali seems io have committed himself to the purchase without advice, except from Turkish officers. (9) A Committee appointed by the Wali seems to have reported some time ago in favour of replacing the present bridge of wooden boats at Baghdad by an iron suspension bridge and two bridges of iron pontoons. I communicated this infor mation by telegram to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople on the 6th of July, with a view to its being conveyed to British firms. I now learn that designs and specifications for an iron bridge, to be supplied by Messrs. Blockey,N, ffiimici. emwiti ;r 8' His iia, ient Fat- wisito r season ixt year, orders to imreroi 23 (&gt;ee a nd Ccmpmy of Baghdad, have been for a considerable time in the possession of the Wilayat. It is stated here that the Minister of Public Works at Constan tinople is in communication, on the subject of the Baghdad bridges with firms in Belgium The names of the supposed firms, however, cannotV ascertained here ; and I am informed by His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador that the news is not confirmed at Constantinople. The Tigris at Baghdadis about 300 to 350 yards in breadth, and I doubt whether the financial means will be forthcoming to provide anything better than an iron pontoon bridge or bridges. (10) For some time past Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company, who are the representatives here of the American Standard Oil Company, have desired to possess a private kerosine store, the depots provided by the Baghdad municipality being most undesirable places of storage. They have apparently the right, under the Turkish Municipal Regulations, to obtain leave to construct such a store on suitable conditions. The premises must be acquired in the name of an individual; and it was at first doubtful whether the titular owner should be some one connected with the Standard Oil Company,_ in which case the necessary steps would have been taken through the American Consul,^someone put ^forward by Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company. An application to the Wali in the same of Mr. A. B. Taylor, a partner in the letter firm, was at length sent in by them on the 1st August 1910, through the medium of this Consulate-General. (11) The absence of telephones at Baghdad, where they would be extremely * See V -12 above. useful, has already been mentioned.* There appears to be an excellent opening here for an enterprising company; but discussion and agreement with the Turkish local and municipal authorities would be an essential preliminary to action. I am surprised that none of the British firms on the spot have as yet taken the matter up. (12) I am informed on doubtful authority that the Wali, before making an t See X-i above. arrangement f with Fournier, endeavoured to obtain telegrams from Reuter, but that he found the latter to be precluded by an agreement with Fournier from enter- taining his proposals. If the supposed agreement does not exist, or if it exists but can be cancelled, it might be worth the while of Reuter to take the-/-question of establishing an agency here into consideration. I have suggested unofec ially that the matter might be brought to the notice of Reuter’s principal representative in India. A good local agent could easily be found at Baghdad in the person of some British merchant; and, in view of the daily increasing importance of Mesopotamia, the news obtained by him would no doubt be acceptable to the European and Indian press. The existence of a Reuter’s agency at Baghdad would also serve as a wholesome check upon the misdeeds of Turkish officials in this province. XII.— General and Miscellaneous. ae. $ The Jews here are as prone to overcrowding as they are in European cities. I am sure that there are more than 5 “ to a house ” here ; but perhaps the Rabbi meant “ to a room.” It is quite possible. I should say, that there are 70,000 in Baghdad. (1) The Rev. D. Papo, the Jewish Chief Rabbi here, informs me that therej are 60,000 Baghdad Jews in the town and that they inhabit 12,000 houses. He says that there are 10,000 Persian Jews also, between whom and the Baghdad Jews proper there is little real difierence. His believe, further tells me that the order of importance, as Jewish centres, of the places mentioned below is as follows:— 1. Salonika, 2. Constantinople, 3. Baghdad, 4. Adrianople, 5. Smyrna.BBSS ^ i... in. iTTk BBI 24 (2) On the 22nd o£ July I visited the two principal hostels forpilgrin s connect ed with the Sunni shrine of Shaikh ’Abdul Qadir. I was conducted round the smaller one, which is for married couples, lies at some distance from the shrine and is known as the “ Takiyah Shaikh Rafi ”, by an offft.a known as the Shaikh-al- Hadhrah; and round the larger, which is known as the ‘ Kafi and is s tuated n the courtyard of what may be called the shrine itself, by Saiyid Mahmud Effendi, a son of the present Naqib. The persons accommodated and fed in the hostels are mostly Indians ; but in the “ Kafi ” there are considerable numbers of Afghans and Africans, to each of which nations a separate block of cubicles is allotted. The Afghans are partly natives of British India and partly from Afghanistan; and the Africans include Sudanese and inhabitants of the Mediterranean provinces. I have lately made the acquaintance, on neutral ground, of the present Naqib of Baghdad, Saiyid ’Abdur Rahman ; and, though neither of us can see his way to call n|on the other first, we are on excellent terms. His house is separated from the Residency by a narrow lane only; and one of his little boys has long been accustomed to make a playground of the Residency garden At our first meeting I quoted to the Naqib, considerably to his amusement, the Arabic rhyming distich:— “ Good-day, neighbour T’ “ Thou in thy house and I in mine.’ * “ . . . Salam, ya jaril “ Anta fi darak wa ana fi dari.” The Naqib has lately pressed Captain Finnis of the Comet to make free use of one of his private Sardabs (hot weather cellars) whenever it is too hot on board ship.

We now enclose a further telegram from our Bagdad agents, from which you will gather that our request that the confiscated portion of our property should he restored, pending discussion of the question at issue, has been disregarded by the local authorities, who are proceeding to deal with the property in dispute as though it already belonged to them. In a previous communication you informed us that His Majesty’s Ambassador in Constantinople had been desired to support our request. But we understand from the telegram that no formal demand for the temporary restoration of the property has yet been made by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad. We fear it may now be too late to take this course. THE political agent in Turkish Arabia and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople are in communication with each other, and, consequently, formal demand for the restoration of the property has been delayed. The Vali of Bagdad’s secretary informed the political agent in Turkish Arabia that it would be impossible to comply with such a demand. The opinion prevails here that the Vali of Bagdad cannot withdraw from position without loss of prestige, because many natives will demand same treatment. We do not expect to be able to arrange the matter amicably, or even legally, at Bagdad without sacrificing our interests.

E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia ana li.B.M's. Consul General, Baghdad, The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. British Residency and Consulate General, Baghdad, 15th August 1910. Sir, I have the honour to submit^for the information of the Annexure ho.l. ] Government of India the purport of a cypher telegram, which I despatched on the 14th of August to H.B.LTs Ambassador at Constantinople, together with the substance of three earlier Annexures hos.2,o, &amp; 4 jtelegrams connectea with it. The facts affecting this Residency ore, I think, so clear as not to require additional explanations. a. In ordinary circumstances it would be inconceivable that the Turkish authorities should contemplate violent encroachment on the precincts of a British Residency ana consulate General; and I have held, as long as I prudently might, to the view that no such action could possibly be intended by them. But the ques-cion has now been on foot for about a month; and the rumours of contemplated encroachment, instead of dying away, have steadily become more positive. The attitude and language of the Turkish authorities is, as will be seen from my telegram to the Ambassador, disquieting; and groups of people have latterly been collectingI , ;W collecting oeiore the Hesiiency wall, iiscueaing among them selves the exact point where it will he cut ana the probable wilth of the breach* It was after very careful consiaeration, and most reluctantly, that I decided at last to bring the matter to the notice of the British Embassy at Constantinople; and I trust that my action in doing so may be approved both by the Government of India and by His Majesty^ Government* 3. It is probable that the Turkisli/Govemment, being now forestalled, will profess surprise at my having believed them capable of such irregular action as that in question* But it is clear to me that* whether they have ever really intended to violate the Residency precincts or not, they have at least encouraged a belief of their meaning to do so, - and that with great success, - among the inhabitants of Baghdad. The object of the authorities was perhaps to drive me into undignified action, as, for example, by asking the wali officially whether he meant to make a street through the ! British Residency; but apart from the reference to uolonei annexure Ho.5. | Jawad Bey, a copy of my letter to whom is enclosed, i have been careful to show no outward signs of concern. 1 consiaerea it necessary to make one reference to a Turkish official, lest the Turks skoula say afterwaras that I had given them no opportunity of contraaicting the current rumours. 4. My summary of events for the month of July 1910.forwarded by this mail, contains numerous examples of the arbitrary action of the present Wall, who appears to have very little respect either for foreign treaties or for Turkish law; and my Summary for august will probably contain others. Peculiar as it may appear, however, my personal relations with Uazim Pasha ana his staff continue to be not merely friendly butcoriial; ani I think I may promise that, if they shouli cease to he so, the fault will not he on my siie.

Purport of Cypher Telegram from the British Political Resident at Baghdad to His Britannic Majesty's jtfnhassador at Constantinople, 14th August 1910* (232 groups)# The following is urgent and should he read in continua tion of my telegrams of the 8th and 9th August. Messrs lynch have directed their representative at Baghdad to demand through this Consulate-General the instant return to them of their land illegally taken possession of hy the Baghdad Municipality, and to aet up a temporary fence along the line of the wall which has been demolished, I venture to think that the action intended is correct, if Messrs, lynch are going to lodge a claim in court, as I understandjthey are#. Instructions are solicited whether a representative of the Residency should he present at the proceedings. A new street, which has been opened up hy destroying buildings, etc., is now approaching the wader wall of this Residency in a menacing fashion and will strike^ it at right angles. It is generally thought that the Turkish authorities mean to continue this street through the Residency, which it would divide approximately, both buildings and garden, into half. There is no justification at all for such a proceeding. The street can easily be deflected a little and follow a road whichwhich already exists. Even the Engineer employed by the Municipality, a Frenchman, seems to be imbued with the idea that forcible X n croachment is intended* To the best of my belief this Residency is the property of His Britannic Majesty. I understand that it ife entered in the Turkish records in the name of the British Embassy at Constantinople, and that the Government of India hold the title deeds. I wrote to the Turkish Engineer directing the work on the 12th of August in order to ascertain his views, but he has failed to send me any written reply. He and another Turkish officer have reassured me verbally; but; the manner of both struck me as, embarrassed, and they seemed to me anxious to avoid discussion. In an ordinary case it would be highly ridiculous to suspect the Wali of intending to take forcible steps of the kind suggested, especially without any warning; but Nazim Pasha is at the present time behaving so di^tatorially that it is impossible to foresee what rash act he may not commit. The walls of the German Club garden have been levelled, and some of the trees cut down, without any notice which the members could understand having been given them, though the native proprietor of the ground was nono doubt informed. In part at least the Wall's actions are probably intended to lower the respect felt here for foreign countries. Immoveable property at Baghdad has lost for the time being its entire sale and mortgage value, the cause being Nazim Pasha's arbitrary conduct during the past month. If any attempt is made to enter the Residency grounds by force, I shall act according to my own judgment, with due regard to the circumstances. If there were to be any delay in communicating with the Porte at Constantinople, the results might be serious.Confidential.

A / / resume of what preceded follows. It was on July 18th that Hr. parry heard of the contemplated demolition. The Consul General was informed, and sent an official letter to the Tali on the sane day, requestingmammm requesting postponement until the matter could he considered. On July 28th a petition from; Ur. parry praying that the order for the demolition should he withdrawn was forwarded hy the Consul general to the Wall with an official letter, in which it was explained that, after personally inspecting the buildings condemned hy the Kunicipality as dangerous and therefore to he demolished, the Consul-General was satisfied that the statement was incorrect,-viz. that the buildings were not dangerous. A reply from the Wali reached the Consul-General on August 2nd, to the effect that the question v r as one of immovable property and that therefore no consular interference v/as admissible. After receipt of Ambassador’s wire of August 3rd Lr. Lorimer considered that for the moment the situation had become safe. On August 6th, however, yr. Parry received a verbal intimation that nexjr day the w-all would be demolished. This intimation, as being irregularly made, he refused to accept; but on the 7th August another intimation was given, andjaemolition was commenced that evening. This -procedure on the part of the Wali is no doubt due to the fact that the Municipality has no funds with which to pay for expropriations. The latest information received by Hr. parry is to the effecteffect that, without further notice 'being’ ^iven, the denoli- tions will he extended so as to carry away the iLain front of the office buildings of Lynch &amp; Go. This is a lofty structure, and nothing had been said previously about possible interference with it. Annexure ho. 4. Substance of telegram from British Political Besident,Baghdad, to K. B. A's Ambassador, Constantinople, dated 9th August 1910. The members of the various foreign communities at Baghdad are much disturbed by the behaviour of the present Governor General, whose proceedings are sometimes contrary to treaty, or even to Turkish law. They are also taken so suddenly in some cases, as not to allow time for reference by Consuls to their respective Ambassadors. It has been proposed to the British Consul General that he should join with some of his foreign colleagues in a collective remonstrance to the Pali; but, recognising the futility of such a measure, he has declined. It may be of importance for H. E* the Ambassador, however, to know how matters stand, ir^case of a general con sultation upon Baghdad affairs taking x^lace among the Embassies at Constantinople. There are matters of dispute outstanding2 - [This Docunrent is the Property of His Bri CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. 30433] No 1 . (No. 579.) Sir, Sir G.

Lynch and an Armenian British subject and pensioned employe that, in connection with other municipal improvements in Bagdad, part of the premises owned by them would be c emohshed dan gerous. His Majesty’s consul-general, after inspecting the premises and hnding that the pretext was unfounded, wrote the same day to the vali and requested him to postpone any action pending consideration of the matter. On the + 1 8 4 - ^ j -*p orimer / 2 rwar( ^ e ^ to officially a petition from the manager praying that the order of demolition might be withdrawn, and informed him at the same time that he has satisfied himself that the structures to be demolished were not dangerous I he vah, however, declined to admit Mr. Lorimer’s intervention in the question, which he said was one of non-movable property. In the meantime I made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior who telegraphed for explanations. But the vali has not allowed these enquiries to deter him from his purpose. On the 6 th August Lynch’s manager received notice verbally that the wall, &amp;c., would be demolished on the 7th, and though the manager refused to accept suclp irregular notice, it was repeated next day, and the demolition began the same evening; while the manager was further informed that the demolition was to include, without further notice, the main front of his chief office, a lofty building which had not hitherto been mentioned. Lynch’s agent has now sent m through Mr. Lorimer a claim for the immediate restoration of the land illegally seized and a request to be allowed to erect tents on the site of the former wall; and his firm contemplate fighting the matter out in the law courts. The demolitions are apparently being carried out in this arbitrary manner by the municipality, who have no funds for expropriation purposes, in order to obtain without payment ground for carrying through the property affected a road which now threatens the wall of the British residency itself at right angles ; and it is locally believed that the municipality intend to carry this road through, instead of diverting it slightly round the residency grounds, and so divide them into two nearly equal parts. The walls of a garden used as a club by the German community at Bagdad but owned by a native, have already been demolished and palms cut down without any proper notice ; and the ; value of all non-movable property at Bagdad has gone down greatly of late in conse quence of the vali’s high-handed action. His Excellency describes the Lynch case as one of non-movable property; but it appears to be one purely of contiscation on false grounds. Mr. Lorimer learns that when the municipality obtains any funds, they I intend to proceed with much expropriation ; great loss would thus be inflicted on many British subjects resident at Bagdad. In continuation of the original representations which I made at the Porte at various times, I have now sent in a pro-memorid, copy of which I have the honour to enclose herewith, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who have promised to telegraph to the vali for explanations of his action. I am also supporting Messrs. Lynch’s demand for the restoration of the lands seized, and am strongly deprecating the alleged intention of interfering with the grounds of the residency in a note verbale to the Sublime Porte, copy of which is enclosed herewith. The action of the vali in this present case is by no means an isolated instance of his hasty and drastic policy with regard to foreign subjects and property at Bagdad. There have been, Mr. Lorimer informs me, repeated instances of similar actions on his part in regard to subjects of other Powers. The high-handed nature of the proceeding is interpreted by Mr. Lorimer as intended to lower the prestige of foreigners, a policy which mainly affects British interests. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to our letter of the 13th instant, we have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter from our agent in Bagdad to His Majesty’s consul-general in Bagdad, dated the 18th July last, on the subject of the action of the municipal authorities in regard to our premises there. We have, &amp;c. LYNCH BROTHERS. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Parry to Cansul-General Lorimer. Sir, Bagdad, July 18, 1910. WE have the honour to inform you that a notice has been presented to us to-day by the municipal authorities, stating that the wall and shops abutting on the main road and running from our offices to the south boundary of our property are to be demolished on the plea that they are in a dangerous condition. 2. We maintain the walls are not in a dangerous condition. The low building is not over 12 feet high, and of sound construction. 3. On the notice being presented to us, we interviewed the chief municipal officer, and he informed us that he had received his orders from the vilayat, and that he would not be able to abstain from carrying them out at once. 4. The notice has only been shown to us and not served in the ordinary manner. 5. It would appear that the allegation of the walls being in a dangerous condition has been made with the object of destroying them in order to widen the road without paying compensation. 6 . The dangers of accepting a notice of this sort without vigorous protest are manifest for the following reasons :— (a.) We have no proof that the destruction of the shops and walls cannot be used in connection with the large and permanent building on our premises. (b.) We have no objection to giving a portion of our frontage for the purpose of widening the road, provided, of course, that we are justly recompensed foi the loss we have to suffer, but we strongly object to the arbitrary manner in which the work is to Ido carried out (c.) As the permanent building on our property extends for some distance along the road, we consider it is due to us to know the intention of the authorities with regard to the whole road-widening scheme, at any rate, as far as regaids the poition m which we are interested. Moreover, we expect to have a leasonable period of notice to enable us to make the necessary arrangements to provide other quarters for the tenants who occupy the shops and for the construction of other offices if the whole of the buildings are to be cut through. . 7. We solicit your assistance to support us in resisting this arbitrary order, not with a spirit of obstruction, but m the hope that some consideiation will be taken of the difficulties we have to contend, and as a protest against the attempt to use the pietext that the walls are dangerous with other objects.[ 12 ] In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 30968/10. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, ^ London.

Our Agent at Busreh, in a letter dated previous to this incident, comments on the method of the local autho rities at Busreh as follows:- 'The efforts of the Local Administration have 'relaxed during the past few months as their zeal 'for improvement quickly depleted their funds. The 'houses they demolished to widen the road have not 'been rebuilt and the debris of the ruins has made 'the road worse than it v/as before. We understand 'that no compensation has been paid to the unfor- 'tunate householders and as the brick makers took 'advantage of the position to double the price of 'their The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S.W.'their bricks, the landlords sat tight and their 'houses remain untenanted and in rains. These well 'meant efforts to improve existing thoroughfares 'create dissatisfaction and are a check to the 'enterprising builder who would otherwise build 'houses to meet the demand that undoubtedly exists. 'There appears to be no method in the work of the 'reformed Turk and all they have so far undertaken 'to do is done without consideration for the inter- 'ests of the parties whose property is destroyed'. This report is impartial, as we do not ov/n property in Busreh, and the premises we lease are not menaced.

We reqnest that strong instructions may he telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad to procure the restoration of the property from which we have been arbitrarily evicted pending investigation of the matter. The telegram from our agent is the only intimation we have received of any question having arisen, and we feel that such arbitrary action will, if acquiesced in by our Government, render trading in Turkey extremely difficult, if not impossible, for British subjects. (Translation.) MUNICIPALITY, under orders of the Vali of Bagdad, has demolished the wall and shops extending along the road and forming part of our property, alleging that they are dangerous, but in reality to widen road. The British political agent in Turkish Arabia has pronounced buildings safe. Believing municipality’s action illegal, we are entering protest through Turkish court, claiming compensation. The external dimensions of the demolished wall are 140 feet. There is every probability that the i municipality will shortly lay hands upon our offices to effect public improvements, i Our loss will be very heavy and must be compensated. YOU must claim through consul-general immediate restoration of our property, on which you should erect a temporary fence where wall demolished. We are representing matter to the Foreign Office and regard it as very serious. Point out to the vali if necessary we do not desire to oppose improvements, but in all civilised countries property can only be acquired compulsorily for improvements under special power from central Government and after payment full compensation. Amounts claimed for compensation must be submitted our approval with facts in full before being put forward locally. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [August 15.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [29692] No. 1.

( 1 ) On a recent tour in the Musal V ilayat I made enquiries at various places about the causes and progress of * See last Summary, 1-2. the Turkish operations against the Shaikh* of Baraizan It seems clear that the first act of serious aggression was committed by the Shaikh, who about April 1909 attacked the town of ’Aqrah, then ungarrisoned except by police. After this incident troops were sent to the spot; forced the Pirish pass, north of ’Aqrah, on the way to the Zab ; occupied Biri Kaprah, near the right bank of the river ; captured and destroyed the Shaikh’s village of Baraizan, near the left bank ; and advanced into the Shirin hills immediately behind (i.e., north of) Baraizan in pursuit of the Shaikh. It was in the Shirin hills that the Turks met with the disaster described in my Summary for Decem- ber-January, 1909-10 ; their losses on that occasion appear to have been less than at first reported, but were considerable. The Shaikh of Baraizan appears to be a youth and illiterate ; and the general opinion is that he acted at first very much under the advice of his \\ azir, who has since been killed in action with the Turks. The Shaikh is living at present at Babsaifah, a place behind the Shirin hills, and there is little prospect of the Turks being able to capture him ; on the other hand, it is unlikely that he will venture seriously to attack them while they remain stationary in the places which they have occupied. There is now a battalion of Nidham infantry £ t the^base of operations (’Aqrah); and the Zibar Nahiyah, which includes all the Shaikh’s more valuable possessions, is held by two Nidham battalions at Baraizan itself, a battalion of Radif at Biri Kaprah, and a battalion of Radif at Sirki,—the last being a place on the right bank of the Zab below Biri Kaprah. These are the infantry, and there are six mountain guns at Baraizan ; but regular cavalry and mounted gendarmerie are wanting, the ground being un suitable for horses. The present position is one not uncommon in Indian frontier warfare. The tribesmen have been driven into the higher hills, where it is not worth while to follow them with regular troops, and it does not appear that any thing more can or need be done by the Turks until the fugitives tire of living in exile. The locking-up of four battalions in a corner of the country is regrettable, however, especially at a time when more troops are urgently needed in other quarters. I do not think that it can be safely affirmed, on the evidence before us, that the action of the Turkish Government against the Shaikh has been unjustifiable. Muhi-un-Dint Pasha (I) is still at Musal and appears to be unemployed. It j - See Summary for December-January 1909- is Said that he will be COUrt-martialled On io, i-i. a charge of accepting presents from the Shaikh of Baraizan at the time when he was in command of the forces sent against the latter. The reportj of a success gained by the Shaikh in March last was exaggerated, . .. , T 0 The post surprised by him was a tribal one • JSee Summary for March 1910, 1-2. ^ ^ of Q ^ yah tw0 day g. journey from ’Aqrah, and the only persons killed were the commandant and his servant; but about 18 rifles of a Russian pattern were captured. The name of the Kurdish tribe of which the Shaikh is chief is Diwanah, not Diwaniyah. (2) The trouble§ with the Hamawand § See last Summary, T-4. tribe is growing more acute. On the 1 2 th of April about 30 of the Hamawand who had come in at Musal were suddenly placed under restraint; and a week later they were despatched under a military escort toKirkuk, with a view to their being tried at Sulaimaniyah for complicity in the disturbances. This apparent change of policy seems to havebeen due to complaints made at Musal and Constantinople by inhabitants of the W ilayat that the tribe were being treated too leniently. It is not clear that the assurances given to the persons now in custody, which were apparently to the effect that those Hamawand who submitted and gave proof of their innocence would not be punished, have as yet been broken ; but there is at least an unfoi- tunate element of the unexpected in the turn that things have taken. I happened to be at Kirkuk when the prisoners passed through that place between the 23rd and 26th April. Among them were some women ; but the release of three children, who would otherwise have accompanied them, had considerately been obtained at Musal by the British Vice-Consul there, by means of unofficial representations. Just at this moment, possibly because the £ 1^0 Turks of those who had submitted appeared to them treacher ous, there was a sudden outbreak of activity on the part of the rest of the tribe, all of whom are now settled in Persia, beyond the reach of the Turks. On the 24th April the Mutasarrif of Kirkuk, whose guest I was at the time, informed me that two gangs of Hamawand had entered Turkish territory ; and, later the same day, news reached Kirkuk that 40 donkeys had been carried off on the road to Sulaimaniyah. The next day a considerable caravan, though accompanied by an escort, was captured by a body of Hamawand raiders at Darband upon the same road; and that evening a force of about 75 mounted infantry (Nidham) set out from Kirkuk to the scene of the occurrence. Twelve soldiers captured, four travellers killed and four wounded, and over 100 mules carried off is now reported to have been the total of the damage done in the affair of the 25th. In deference to the wishes of the Mutasarrif, who naturally felt responsibility in the matter, I gave up my intention of travelling to Sulaimaniyah, though I believe that I could have done so without danger. On the 26th, when I left for Altun Kupri, my caravan was accompanied by a body of 30 mounted gendarmes until it was clear of the Kirkuk hills. , On the 30th April a large caravan from Baghdad, bound for Persia, was attacked and plundered between Qizilrobat and Khanaqin ; this outrage also is generally attributed to the Hamawand. It has become necessary to send large mounted escorts with the Baghdad-Musal and Musal-Baghdad weekly mails on the part of of the road between Salahiyah (Kifri) and Kirkuk. The difficulty with the Hamawand seems to me graver than that with the Shaikh of Baraizan. The tribe are evidently expert raiders ; they have settled down in Persian territory, from which it is improbable that they will be expelled by the Persian authorities ; and the other tribes round Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah know very well that any offences which they themselves now secretly commit, are likely to be put down to the Hamawand. (3) On the 10th of May, accompanied by Mr. Greig, I had a public interview T with the Wali of Musal on the subject of ee as ummary ’ ’ of the violation* of Mr.| Bassam’s domi cile. Muhammad Pasha, somewhat to my surprise, allowed me to cross- examine the senior gendarmerie officer concerned in his presence ; and the result was to place it beyond doubt that two gendarmerie officers and some men did improperly enter the house with the knowledge that their action was irregular. I suggested to the Wali that these two officers should be directed to apologise offi cially at the Vice-Consulate in the presence of respectable witnesses selected by me ; and I promised that, if he agreed, I would submit the proposed settlement to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople for approval; but the Wali did not see fit to close with this offer. The object of the Turkish authorities in acting as they did was no doubt to capture Mar Aliya, not to show disrespect for the British Government ; but in view of a growing tendency to disregard consular privileges, of which there have been one or two illustrations lately at Baghdad, it seems desirable that subs tantial satisfaction should be required in the present case. I informed Sir Gerard Lowther by telegram of my proceedings in the matter. (4) During my stay at Musal I was presented by Nestorian agents with two petitions in which they requested my good tSee Summary for February 1910 , 1 - 4 . offices in the difficulties f between theilcommunity and the Turkish administrafon. After referring to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador by wire, I returned the peti ions to the writers through the Dragoman of the Musal Vice-Consulate with a message to the effect that aftei careful consideration, I found that I could not take any steps in the matter. . T his action must, I think, have made it clear to those concerned that the attitude of the British Government in the matter is one of strict neutrality and non-interference. J . Translations of the Nestorian petitions were submitted in due course for the information of His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador. (5) After his operations* against the Dilaim, Muhammad Pasha returned to hia * See last Summary, ii -1 headquarters via the Shammar country, arriving at Musal on the 24th of April. The Shammar appear to have retired northwards before him, thus avoiding a collision. At Tall Afar the Pasha seized 40 of, the Turkman inhabitants of that village, whom he brought with him to Musal as the first local recruits for the Turkish army ; for the people of Tall ’Afar had hitherto successfully evaded the legal obligation to render military service. Altogether the' Wall appears to have captured some 20 camels and SO 0 sheep from the Dilaim, and to have brought bnaikh ibn Qu ud of that tribe back with him as a guest, rather than a prisoner. From the Shimnar he apparently recovered nothing. On all hands the cam paign is regarded, and not without justice, as a complete failure. Corrupt motives are ascribed to the Wali, both at Musal and at Baghdad, for not having acted more energetically against the tribes : it is said that large numbers of his own sheep are pastured by them. ( 6 ) It is interesting to know that this Muhammad Fazil Pasha, Wali of Musal is a near relative of the celebrated Shamil, who held out against the Russians in the Caucasus for many years. Muhammad Pasha was brought up at the Russian Court, but he transferred his allegiance to Turkey at the time of the last Russo- lurkish war. He had the honour of being presented in London, while still in the household of the Tsar, to his late Majesty Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, before whom he performed feats of horsemanship. The Wali is now an old man, worn m!t with service and quite unfit, for that and for other reasons, to cope with the difficulties by which he is surrounded at Musal. He informed me that he had sent in his resignation, but that it had not yet been accepted ; and I was told that he rose from his bed, to which he was confined by indisposition, to receive my farewell visit. Personally there could not be a more pleasant or courteous gentle man. &amp; II.— Baghdad Wilayat. ( 1 ) On the 9th April hostilities took place in the neighbourhood of Ja’arah, near Kufah, between the A1 Shibil and Ghazailat tribes ; and the inhabitants of Ja arah sided with the former. A number of men were killed and wounded on both sides. The fighting, of which the cause is not known, was stopped by the Commandant of the embodied Radif battalion at Ja'arah. ( 2 ) In the raid on the Baghdad-Khanaqin highroad, mentioned at 1-2 above, about 150 animals with their loads are said to have been carried off. Some of the goods, which the robbers could not remove without unduly retarding their retirement, remained behind and were recovered. A party of gendarmerie was sent out from Khanaqin, but did not, it is believed, succeed in coming up with the robters. 6 r a ? e i f ° re k 1 ^ id 1 dle of May some fighting took place nearFallujah between Arabs of the A1 Bu Alwan section of the Dilaim tribe, against which the v' ali t See Section 1-5 above. 0 r f Musalf was recently acting, and a force of Turkish gendarmerie. The Arabs had, it would appear, refused to pay the usual “ tithes ” to Government. Five or six men are said to have been killed on either side. On the 14th of May a small force, consisting of 40 artillery with two guns, 90 infantry and 60 gendarmes was despatched from Baghdad in the direction of Fallujah ; and it was followed on the 17th May by a detachment of more than 60 men.

It was witnessed by Mr. J. Van ss, an American Presbyterian missionary from Basrah. The immediate cans fiahting was an attempt by Yusuf Pasha, the military officer co mmandmg m the Muntalik country, to transfer a piece of land near Shatrah town from t holder to a new lessee whom he believed to be better disposed towards the Turkish Government Onthe morning of the 13th March, 200 cavalry, 2 guns and 2 battalions nf infantry left Shatrah under his orders to expel the Arabs m possession 0 land, who belonged to the Sanajir section of the ’Abudah ; but, during an uwhich the Turks spent in preparing the way by musketry and artillery fire, the Sanajir were reinforced by some 5, 000 other Arabs. When the Turks finally assaulted the supposed Arab position they found it empty; and they were imme diately attacked on both flanks and surrounded. Some Arab allies, the A 1 Bu Shamkhi tribe, who were acting with them, fled; and the Turks had then to retreat on Shatrah, suffering heavily as they retired. At nightfall the Arabs entered the town. On the 14th of March the Arabs were in possession of the town until the evening, the Turkish troops remaining shut up in the fort and barracks. Shops and houses were indiscriminately plundered by the Arabs, including the A1 Bu Shamkhi friendlies ; and the damage done is estimated at over £ T. 60,000. On the 15th March a three days’ truce was arranged; and on the next day Mr. Van Ess succeeded, not without difficulty, in escaping from the place. At the time of the disaster there were four battalions of infantry, 200 mounted infantry and five guns at Shatrah, one battalion of infantry at Hai, and nine batta lions of infantry at Nasiriyah or in its neighbourhood ; but communication between these two places was soon closed. Within a fortnight reinforcements consisting ©f a single battalion each had left Baghdad, ’Amarah and Basrah for the front; and on the 8 th April two field-guns with 34 men of the artillery were despatched from Baghdad. On the 14th April four wounded officers and 70 wounded men arrived at Baghdad, and on the 25th of May the Turkish steamer Furat brought some 30 more. It seems to have been found necessary, on account of the attitude of a number of the Arab tribes to the south and east of Shatrah, to send the rein forcements from Basrah round by the Tigris and Shatt-al-Gharraf. It is improbable that the Turks will be able to effect much in the Muntafik districts until autumn, when the floods which effect that part of the country subside. The original reason of sending troops into this quarter, now almost forgotten, appears to have been a general withholding of taxes by the tribes during twr&gt; or three years. (2) The good understanding which in February appeared to exist between the Wali of Basrah and the Shaikh of Muhammareh was soon afterwards impaired by a series of incidents ; and at the end of April relations between them were strained almost to breaking point. At length in the earlier part of May, not without unofficial intervention on the part of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, some steps towards a reconciliation were taken. The facts have no doubt been reported in detail to the Government of India by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Muhammareh, and to the British Ambassa dor at Constantinople by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, and it is therefore unnecessary to report them here. ( 3 ) It is difficult at Baghdad to follow the course of events in the Euphrates valley below Kufah ; but that part of the country is evidently in a very disturbed condition. It is stated that about the middle of April the Hacham tribe attacked the town of Suq-ash-Shuyukh ; and that, notwithstanding tbe immediate des patch of a column from the Muntafik field force, communication between that place and Hammar ceased to be possible. About the same time a quarrel over grazing rights occurred between the inhabitants of Samawah and tbe neighbour ing Ziyad tribe ; and by the 25tb of April some bloodshed had taken place, and the town had been surrounded and was cut off from Bumaithah. It seems not improbable that these incidents, together with the Ja’arah* affair, * See II- 1 above. may be due indirectly to a diminution t See IV -1 above. of respect for Turkish authority result ing from the disaster at Shatrah. Y.—Turkish Affairs. ( 1 ) The chief features of the period now under report are the arrival of Hus ain Nazim Pasha, Governor-General of Baghdad and Commandant of the 6th C 440 F.D.6 Turkish Army Corps, which had been long and anxiously awaited, and the ear liest acts of his administration. Nazim Pasha arrived at Dair-az-Zor on the 23rd April; on the 1st of May he was at ’Anah ; and on the 5th May he reached Baghdad. An official deputa tion from Baghdad met him at Fallujah. It was considered a significant fact that at Fallujah he refused to profit by some arrangements made for his comfort by ’Isa Effendi, Jamilzaclah, who is one of an important clan at Baghdad. He also caused Ihe Provincial Government and the Municipal Committee of Baghdad to be warned, before his arrival, against making any expensive arrangements for the accommodation of himself or his staff. (2) Nazim Pasha’s Parman of appointment, of which a copy and transla tion are attached, is, though badly drafted, a remarkable and significant document. It is in fact a programme of reforms, chiefly military. That a substantial grant . has at last been made tor the improvement * See Summary for March 1910, V-7. of communications, which* is one of the most crying needs of the country, and that it is intended to be repeated year by year is an encouraging symptom The provisions defining the future position of the Wali of Baghdad with reference to the Walis of Musal and Basrah are perhaps the least satisfactory part of the Farman, for they seem ambiguous and not unlikely to give rise to friction ; but precautions may have been taken, which do not appear in this public document, against the usual results of divided authority and responsibility. The Farman was read at the Sarai on the 11th of May in the hearing of a large concourse of officials and a crowd of townspeople. (3) A list of the superior staff officers attached to Nazim Pasha will be found at the end of this Summary; it contains some particulars of their individual appointments and duties. The principal members of the staff whom I have met so far are Hasan Riza Bey, Chief of the Military Staff, and Muhammad Hikmat, Naval Commodore. The Chief of the Staff, who speaks German and French, seems to be an able and ener getic officer. He is the son of one Namik Pasha, who was Wali of Baghdad about eight years ago, and whose administration was very popular here. The Naval Commodore, who speaks English perfectly well and has evidently asso ciated a good deal with English people, is a man of modest and even retiring manners ; but he indicates that he has the prospect of succeeding before long to a high naval appointment at Constantinople. He has been stationed at Basra for some months past, but Nazim Pasha on arrival summoned him to Bagh dad. His wife, an Austrian lady, is in Europe. Political correspondence between the Wilayat and this Residency now passes through the hands of a (Catholic) Armenian employe named Eram Bey, who describes himself on his card as ‘ ‘ Directeur des Affaires Politiques du Vilayet de Bagdad,’’and in regard to whose actual status some doubts exist on the part of myself^and my colleagues. I have consulted His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador as to the position which I ought to assume in my dealings with him. Some of the duties of this official were formerly discharged by an ordinary dragoman. (4) On the military side, in the work of which Na,zim Pasha is said to take a stronger personal interest than in civil affairs and on which more stress is certainly laid in his Farman, great activity, even feverish haste, prevails. Raghib Bey, the former head of the 2nd section of the General Staff, has been dismissed. (5) On the civil side, the operations of the Reorganisationf Commission were t see Summary for March 1910, v-6. suddenly stopped under telegraphic orders sent by Nazim Pasha from Hit; and, on Ins reaching Baghdad, a new Committee was appointed by the Governor-General to revise the proceedings of the Commission. Several civil officials were dismissed within a week of the Wali’s arrival at Baghdad, the most important among them being the Maktubji or Secretary of the Wikiyat, the First Mustantiq or Procureur General, the Chief of Police, and the President of the Municipal Committee. The Maktubji was a half brother of thewell-known Muhammad Shaukat Pasha, but it is understood that the latter was not on good terms with him and will not resent his removal. (6) One of the first acts of Nazim Pasha was to send for and consult a number of his chief administrative subordinates. Among those so honoured were the Wali of Basrah, who arrived at Baghdad on the 11th May and remained until the 30th May ; the Mutasarrif of Karbala ; and the Mutasarrif of 'Amarah. An impression is current here that the relations of the two Walis were con siderably less friendly at the time of their parting than of their first meeting: and this is attributed to differences of opinion between them in regard to the policy to be pursued in the Basrah Wilayat. If I am not mistaken, Sulaiman Nazif Bey is somewhat hot-headed, and in that case the policy of conciliation which Nazim Pasha evidently intends to follow in the first instance with the Arab tribes must necessarily be repugnant to him. All Mutasarrifs, Qaim-Maqams and even Mudirs in the Baghdad Wilayat have been ordered to report daily by telegraph the state of their districts. This arrange ment can hardly be intended to be permanent. (7) The question of tribal management is being vigorously grappled with by the new administration. A number of Arab chiefs who were detained at the Baghdad fearai have been released on merely giving their word of honour to be obedient in future to the Turkish Government. Local Shaikhs are being summoned to Baghdad from every side, to pay their respects to the Wali and receive injunctions from him re lative to the maintenance of order. A novel departure on the part of Nazim Pasha has been the reference by him to the principal religious authorities in the country of the two following theological questions :— (a] ) Whether the murders and robberies of travellers and others frequently committed by the tribes can be considered “ Ghazu ” or “ Holy War, ”— a ground on which it has sometimes been sought to excuse them; and (b) Whether the Turkish Government may justifiably punish the tribes for such acts and for rebellion. The decision under Sunni law has been delivered by a committee of scholars presided over by the Naqib and Mufti of Baghdad ; and it is hardly necessary to say that it is emphatically in the negative on the first question, and in the affirma tive on the second. Among the Shi’ah doctors consulted, Saiyid Muhammad IsmaTl (Sadr), the principal Muitahid of Karbala, Saiyid Muhammad Baqir (Tabatabayi) and Shaikh Muhammad (Mazandarani), also of Karbala, have replied that murder and robbery are not “ Ghazu, ” and that whoever can prevent such acts is bound to do so. Muhammad (Qazvinizadah) has answered that, in case of one Arab tribe com- m it tine aeeressions on another, they should be dealt with first by remonstrance, then by threats, and only in the last resort by force. The Fatwa of Mulla Muham mad Kazim (Khurasani) and Shaikh 'Abdullah (Mazandarani) is to the effect that murder and robbery are not “ Ghazu,' and that the slaying of Muhammadans by Muhammadans is a heinous crime. Other Mujtahids were probably consulted; w t hev did not reply, or their answers were not considered useful for publication by^ the Turks. ' The decisions quoted above have been communi- cated to all tribal authorities in the W ilayat, accompanied by letters of exhorta tion and advice from the W ali. Proceedings such as these have sometimes been suggested in India with the . There also described as/ Ohaza “ by those object of putting a stop to fanatical out- who commit them. rages*agamst Europeans on the North-W est Frontier * but they ha-vc never been put into effect, so far as I am aware, probably from a feeling on the part of our officers that they would be both futile and undig nified It has possibly escaped Nazim Pasha that the Shiah Fatwas to which he has given publicity are somewhat evasive in their terms, particularly that from8 Najaf, which might be interpreted^© mean that the killing of Arabs by Turkish soldiers is a heinous crime. I learn that the Arab tribes near Karbala, so far from being impressed by the V ali’s action, have drawn from it the hasty con clusion that he is a pious imbecile and the reverse of formidable. (8) Soon after, or even before, his arrival at Baghdad, Nazim Pasha seems to have reported on the general circulation of foreign silver coins in this province, and to have made some suggestions to Constantinople. A very large proportion of the change used in ’Iraq is, in fact, of Persian mintage. On the 18th of May the Minister of Finance appears to have informed the Wall by telegram that silver coins of five denominations, having an aggregate value of 300,000 G. S. Piastres or less than £ T. 3,000, had been despatched to Baghdad. Such a consignment will not, I think, suffice to replace more than a small proportion of the foreign silver in circulation. (9) At the beginning of April the financial difficulties under which the engi neers responsible for the Euphrates irrigation works laboured were temporarily removed by the receipt of a sum of £ T. 20,000. At the middle of May, however, no further funds having arrived, the same difficulties recurred; and in the third week of the month an unavoidable suspension of the operations appeared to be imminent. This was fortunately averted by the payment of £ T. 20,000 on the 28th or 29th of May to the Engineer-in-Chief, who was informed at the same time that an additional remittance of £ T. 43,000 was on its way from Cons tantinople. The attitude of the new local administration towards Sir William Willcocks’ management of the irrigation works is not favourable. On the 24th of May Mr. Manahim S. Daniel, a leading Jewish landowner of the V\ ilayat, who for personal reasons is deeply interested in the success of the works, informed me in confidence that Nazim Pasha had constituted a Committee under his own presidentship to report on Sir William’s proceedings up to the present time, and to make recom mendations, The members of this Committee were the Daftardar of the V' ilayat, the Naqib of Baghdad, and my informant himself. The first meeting of the Com mittee was held on the 22nd of May, and it appeared to Mr. Daniel from the pro ceedings that the V ali intended eventually dictating a deliverance to the effect that the works should be placed under the control of the authorities of the Wilayat. My informant, who appeared much disturbed, enquired whether I could not inter vene to prevent mischief. I replied that I had no locus standi in the matter, but that, if the Wali were to consult me, I should willingly give him my opinion, (When I saw Mr. Daniel again, on or about the 3rd June, he informed me that no further meetings of the Committee had as yet been held.) The Roumanianf engineer employed on tiie irrigation works has, I understand, ^ 0 T7 e been summoned to Hillah on a charge of t ee as ummary, . being responsible for the death of one Arab labourer and injuries to another, which occ urr ed through the falling of a mass of earth at the Hindiyah excavations. So far as my information goes, it is only a question so far of a sort of legal inquest; and, knowing how fond Turkish authorities are of such proceedings, I do not think that their action in this case need, for the present at least, be taken as an indication of political animus, (10) Meanwhile an indigenous Turkish scheme for the irrigation of the country about Arbil from the Upper Zab, and that about Kirkuk from the Lower Zab, is under consideration, I met Husni Bey, the Engineer of the Musal Wilayat, who had been ordered to report on the project, at Kirkuk on the 25th April. Husm Bey’s previous practical experience as an engineer seemed to have been limited to railway construction in Syria and Hijaz, and his inspection of the Zab country was made without taking any levels.. I noticed that in a sketch which he drew for the purpose of explaining his ideas to me he showed the Lower Zab as running north-east, instead of south-west. From what I saw afterwards of the country adjoining the two Zabs I doubt whether a useful scheme for either river could be undertaken except at very heavy expense. (11) The Administrative Council of Baghdad have recommended to the Gov ernment at Constantinople that a daily letter post should be instituted between Baghdad and Karbala, Hillah, and Najaf, and that the unit rate of postage withinthe ^ ilayat should be reduced to 10 paras. These improvements are much to be desired. At present the posts in question are weekly, and the postage is 40 paras for every 15 grammes. (12) At the beginning of May it was stated that one or two cases of plague had occurred at Basrah, and that the sanitary authorities at Baghdad had received orders to establish an inspection post at Qararah on the Tigris, a few miles below Baghdad, to deal with steamers from Basrah. Inspections at Qararah were ins tituted, but only continued for two or three days. Dr. Lansoni, the principal representative of the Sanitary Board at Baghdad, has lately proceeded on several months' leave to Europe, and his place is now filled by Dr. Bamy from Khanaqin. Dr. Lanzoni is an Italian, Dr. Ramy a Syrian. (13) It has been notified in the official newspaper of the Baghdad Wilayat* since Nazim Pasha s arrival here, that in future all official documents must be written in the Turkish language, and that petitions not written in Turkish will be refused at the Sarai. This order has caused some grumbling in Baghdad, where Arabic is the current language ; and indignant references are made to the practice of the Bairut Wilayat, where, it is alleged, even trials in the law-courts are con ducted in Arabic. (14) In view of the persistent refusal of the Jewish* military recruits at ♦ Q o r utoia xr, Baghdad to eat rations cooked by their * bee Summary for March 1910. V-4, r • i x y f non-Jewish comrades, a concession has now been authorised by the Minister of M ar under which the Jews in the ranks will receive the value of their rations in cash and will be allowed to make their own arrangements for cooking. On the 4th of May, 66 Musal Christians liable to service in the Ihtiyat were formally enrolled, this being about half the number of the Christian residents of the town so liable. No steps have been taken as yet in regard to the other half, nor have the Christians liable to service in the Nidham or the Radif been called up. The considerable Jewish community of Musal has not so far been required to furnish recruits of any of the three classes. At this centre the military authori ties appear reluctant, for some reason, to carry out the enlistment of non-Muham madans. (15) I have caused some enquiries to be made about the Baghdad branch of the “ Committee of Union and Progress, ” a political organisation of which the importance is perhaps not less in 'Iraq than in other parts of the Ottoman Empire at the present day. The branch here has about 750 members ; and within it there is a secret council, supposed to consist of Murad Bey, the Maktubji recently dismissed by Nazim Pasha ; of Suraiyah Bey, Sanitary Inspector of the W ilayat; of Hamdi Bey, Babanzadah ; and of about four military officers. This secret council is said to correspond regularly with the central council of the Committee at Salonika, and occasionally with the councils at Constantinople and Adrianople. The subscriptions of the members of the Baghdad branch amount to £ T. 300 to 350 per annum. Sub-branches at Kazimain, Hillah, Karbala, Najaf, and other places in the \\ ilayat are affiliated to the Baghdad branch. The president of the Kazimain sub-branch is Saiyid Ja’far, who is also president of the Kazimain Municipal Committee. A school for boys, in which political principles are no doubt taught along with other subjects, has been established by the Committee at Baghdad ; there is one at Musal also ; and it is intended to open one at Kazimain. The headmaster of the Baghdad school is an Armenian. The members of the Baghdad branch have a social club opposite the military barracks. No one here seems to know as yet in what light, friendly or hostile, Nazim Pasha and the Committee of Union and Progress mutually regard one another. It is not the policy of the Committee apparently to deal with local Governments ; and the Baghdad branch seems to confine itself to reporting facts and opinions to headquarters, and appears to rely for the attainment of its objects on the influence of the Committee in Europe. Nazim Pasha has not so far taken any visible steps to propitiate the good-will of the local branch ; and, according to one report, he even acts as if he were indifferent to its existence.

At the end of May a paper was circulating “ purported to be the copy of a XnSdem Luthern Persia Isma’il, Qashqai; tion, signed ^MuHz^-W-SuKaneh, Sardar Arfa’; Saulat-ud-Dauleh. TSngS^festi if it ever existed, would seem to have been datedi i V 11 March 1910, and to have been despatched from Shiraz to Tehran. In the copy there are six articles, of which the first three mention the defence of Persia, the maintenance of the Persian constitution, and the establishment of internal peace and order in Persia as the principal aims of the signatories. The fourth article announces the foundation of a “ Haiat Ittihadiyah ” or “Union Society,” membership of which is to be open to all Persian chiefs having the above objects at heart. The fifth article lays down that the members of the society shall afford each other mutual support. The sixth article urges the members of the Persian Majlis to do their duty without fear or favour. (4) It would appear that the influence of the Mujtahids of Iraq in the affairs of Persia has been exerted, during the last two months, in a not unsalutary man ner. It is naturally impossible at Baghdad to judge whether these Mujtahids possess any real influence in Persia. My impression is that, instead of guiding public opinion, they have now begun to study it. (5) During a recent tour in Kurdistan I was able to procure at Rawanduz some information about the occupation by the Turks of the tract on the frontier of the Musal Wilayat which is in dispute between Turkey and Persia. The Turkish garrisons in that (the southern) part of the disputed territory are as follows :— At Banah — The 3rd Battalion of the 45th Regiment, The 1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment. Two mountain guns. At Sardasht *— The 2nd Battalion of the 45th Regiment. Two mountain guns. At Paswah — The 3rd Battalion of the 47 th Regiment. Two mountain guns. At Shno —■ A military detachment : composition not ascertainable. The troops at Shno are from the an Division; those at the other posts from the Kirkuk Division. The guns belong to the same battery, but the number of it was not known to my informants. At Naghadah, formerly a military outpost under Paswah, there are now gendarmes only. The average strength of a battalion being taken at 250 men the Turkish force of occupation would consist of about 1,000 rifles. The Shinawah pass on the road from Rowanduz to Paswah and the Chailashin pass on the road from Rowanduz to Shno are blocked by snow in winter, some times for as long as three months ; but natives of the country can always cross the former on a sort of snow shoes. Communication with the new Turkish posts is difficult at any season on account of the rugged nature of the country; and the distance of even the nearest of them from any strong military base is considerable. It may well be doubted whether Turkey has not here thrust herself into dis advantageous military positions. The local officials at Rowanduz did not seem in the least enthusiastic about the annexations, considering apparently that Rowanduz itself was sufficiently remote from civilization. A vague impression seemed to prevail that the Turkish occupation was now maintained by way of a counter-move to the introduction of Russian troops into Persia ; and I was somewhat surprised to find that those who spoke to me on the subject did not profess to regard the occupation as more than provisional. (6) At the beginning of May an Akhundzada called Agha Shaikh Hasan Fazil (Herati) visited the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. He is said to havet 12 been formerly an influential preacher at Meshed in Khurasan. I have received the following account of his movements, for the accuracy of which, however, I cannot vouch. During recent disturbances in Persia, after an attempt upon his life instigated by Mirza Abul Qasim, Mu'in-ul-Ghuraba, who was his enemy, and who is now at Najaf, he left Meshed and proceeded by wayof Seistan and Nushki to India. In India, in consequence of recommendations which he brought with him, he was given a free pass on the railway, Arriving at Naj f, which he visited before coming to Karbala, he obtained a letter of recommendation from the Muj- tahid Mulla Kazim ; and, relying on the protection of this document, he now proposes to return to Persia. I was led to expect that the Akhundzada would visit me at Baghdad to solicit pecuniary assistance, but he has not as yet made his appearance. (7) A Persian weekly newspaper entitled Ukhuwwat (or “ Fraternity”) has lately been started at Baghdad, and a copy of it sent to this Residency. It is intended to be the organ of the Persian ccmmunity in this country, especially at Baghdad and Kazimain. vii.—najd. ; (1) On the 16th March 1910 a serious collision took place, somewhere in the Arabian desert to the west of the Basrah Wilayat, between the forces of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Amir of Riyadh on the one side and those of Sa'idum Pasha, of the Muntafik tribe, upon the other. The facts have no doubt been reported by the Political Agent at Kuwait and His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah to the Government of India and the British Ambassador at Constantinople. Captain * „ . ^ 0 „ TTT „ Leachman * passed over the ground of the fight soon after it; and, to the best of my recollection, he told me that he personally counted the remains of over 100 bodies upon the field, and that the sky was black with vultures for as far as he could see. From this it would appear that the engagement must have been an exception in the annals of “the bio dless Arabian warfare.” VIII. —British Interest and Cases. fl 1 (1) On the 7th of April 1910, Mr. Parry, the principal representative of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who are the local agents of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, called on me, under instructions from London, to request that I would use my influence at Baghdad to promote the views of the Company! t See Summary for February 1910. VHI-1. in . r ?g ard to the Nahriyeh steamera on the Tigris, and that I would do my best to remove any misconceptions regarding those views which I might find prevailing in native circles. He also asked me to move |the Wali to prevent attacks upon Messrs. Lynch by the local newspapers. I replied that I could not possibly comply with his first request without authority from the British Embassy at Constantinople, to whom I suggested that his employers might apply ; and, with reference to the second, I pointed out that the Wali was himself often lam pooned in the local press and could not therefore be expected to protect foreigners against it. Mr. Parry said that he quite understood my position. I believe that Mr. Parry has since been engaged in trying to work up native opinion at Baghdad and Musal in favour of the proposed amalgamation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Nahriyeh, in connection with which there appears to be a scheme for extending steam navi gation above Baghdad to Musal. I should not be surprised to learn that at Musal his efforts had met with success, for on a recent visit to the place I found the inhabi tants extremely anxious to be brought into communication with the outer world and apparently quite indifferent to the nature of the agency by which this might be effected. (2) At the beginning of April I received two letters from the Acting Wali of Baghdad in which he brought it to my notice that the Residency Surgeon Captain MfcPherson, Drs. Johnson and Stanley of the Church Mission Society, Dr. Wenyon { of the London School of Tro- t See Summary for March 1910 , IX-4. pical Medicine, and Mr. Rosair, a medicalmammm * I should add that Dr. Wenyon was not practia- ing for profit, but only to place himself in touch with the people, and that he readily ac ceded to my suggestion. 13 subordinate on board the R. I. M. S. Comet, were practising medicine in Baghdad. The Wali requested that, if these gentlemen possessed diplomas certified at Con stantinople, they should present them for registration,and that if not, “ they shoukl go to Constantinople and have them certified.'” Reference was also made ^ to their assistants—in the case of Dr. Wenyon, a Mr. Stremes, and in the other cases native Turkish subjects. Complaint was also made of the existence of unlicensed hospitals and dispensaries under the management of the gentlemen named. I ; confined myself to suggesting to Dr. Wenyon that he should not practise,* as the purpose of his mission to Baghdad was solely to study the Baghdad boil, and to asking the Wali to refer me to the provisions of the Turkish law on the sub ject of diplomas, etc. The Acting Wali complied with my request during my absence and was informed by the Assistant Resident that I hoped the matter would be held over until my return. The new Local Government have not as yet referred to the question, which they have possibly overlooked. It was first raised at the instance of Suraiyah Bey (see V-15 above), who is personally interested in the matter as a medical practi tioner, and who is also a member of the “ Committee of Union and Progress/’ (3) Lieutenant Fowlef and Mr. Fraser J were attacked by Arab robbers, t Seo Summary for March 1910, vili-4. while travelling together from Tadmor t See Summary for March 1910 , vill-5. to Damascus, apparently about the end of March. The facts have doubtless been reported to His Britanfiic Majesty’s Ambassador at Co .stantinople, and steps taken by Ris Britain-ic Majesty’s Consul at Damascus ; and I need not therefore quote from a letter on the subject which I have received from Mr. Fraser. Mr. Fowle was struck with a stick and shot at, and a servant was wounded with stones. It is believed that one or two of the Arab assailants were hit by revolver bullets. (4) Mr. (now Captain) Leachman§ returned to Baghdad from his journey in „ , 0 __ TTT ,, Central Arabia about the 20th April. | See last Summary, VIII-2. He ^ ^ ^ ^ o£ and Diwaniyah. He did not after all succeed in getting within less than three days’journey of Hail, the reason apparently being that Ibn Rashid’s officials, corrupted by the profuseness of former European travellers, wished to obtain large presents-from him which he was not in a position to give. He was well treated however, in the Arab camps. Great Britain was the only foreign power in which the people of Najd appeared to take a^r interest. With regard to Mr. Leachman’s movements the Baghdad newspaper Emh- an-Nahrain contained the following remarks, under the heading “ Detention of a British Officer,” in its issue of the 19th April:— “ The hospitality of the Arab tribes is universally admitted, but we could wish that such hospitality were not misunderstood and abused in such a way as go become the cause of excitement and detention. We invite the attention of our Government to the matter.” Captain Leachman h is now left for Musal and Armenia via Kirkuk. To the best of my belief his journeys have no other motive than love of travel and adventure. He has sent maps embodying the results of his observations in Central Arabia to the Royal Geographical Society. (5) Mr. R. Money jj and his Turkish companion proceeded from Basrah to Kuwait by sea and thence returned to Basrah overland via Safwan and Zubair. See last Summary, VIII-6. They then travelled by Zubair to Nasriyah, passing through the military camp of Sa’idun Pasha, Muntafik, on their way. They visited Shatrah, then besieged by Arabs, entering and leaving it through the rebel lines ; followed the Shatt-al-Gharraf (Hai) to Kut-al-’Amarah ; and so returned to Baghdad. They finally left for Constantinople in May. (6) Mr. G. M. Routh of the Royal Artillery, Ordnance Department, arrived at Baghdad from India in April, during my absence on tour. His object was to C-440 F.D. H14 study Arabic and to do some survey work m Mesopotamia with a view to the improvement of existing maps. I would willingly have assisted Mr Eouth in his second purpose, and sent some suggestions from camp to Captain McPherson ; but the Acting Walimade difficulties, and nothing could be arranged. Mr. Routh left again for India in May, having remained at Baghdad about a month. 171 Mr C!row His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, has obtained* the v ^ * ’ SU m of 8,000 piastres from the Turkish * See Summary for February i9io, vii -4. authorities for payment tothe “ Faiz-i- Husaini ” Association of Indian Borahs, whose premises at Basrah were partly demolished last winter for the purpose of widening the Ashar road. He has recovered 4,000 piastres on behalf of the Khojah community in similar circum- stances. (S') About 3 a. m. on the morning of the 25th April a carriage bound for Karbala was suddenly attacked, at only a quarter of an hour s distance from the walls of Baghdad, by 8 or 10 armed robbers. It contained an Indian shawl mer- Thant with his wife, infant, and sister.-mdaw ; another Indian with his wife and two Children • an Indian Wasiqah-holder, or hereditary stipendiary of the Indian Government two Arab men and an Arab woman. The Indians who are all British subjects, were on pilgrimage. Some shots were fired at the carriage, whfh was brought to a standstill by one of the mules being killed; and the robbers then stripped the passengers of all their property, which in the case of the Indians was valued at about £70. The case was in the beginning taken up with some vigour by the local author ities Seven Arabs were arrested, one of whom was unhesitatingly identified by two of the Indian adults. The investigations are still going on, and there is some hope of a satisfactory result. (9) In consequence of floods in 1906 and 1907 part of the wall of the British cemetery at Baghdad fell down ; and it was afterwards proposed that advantage Should be taken of the accident to enlarge the cemetery so as to admit of native Protestant Christians being buried in it as we 1 as British subjects-a privilege Wh°ch they were anxious to obtain. A farrmn for the extension of the cemetery dated the y i9th September 1909, was accordingly obtained from the Sultan of Turkey by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantmop.e; and the terms on which the native Protestant community at Baghdad are to be allowed m future to use a portion of the ground have since been satisfactorily adjusted between e Wrbish Resident and the Church Missionary Society’s principal representative, S on tha f a of the native Protestants. The rebuilding of the cemetery wail in a manner to include the added plot, will now be proceeded with. M O') I had lately an opportunity of seeing the work of the Church Missionary ^nrietv at Musal I regret to say that I found the hospital closed for want of a are certain} a _ dwindled to very small proportions. Miss Marlin is a native mem ber of the Musal missionary staff and is. practically now the sole European e to be advisable that the society should StK else transfer it to some other body, able to cope with the responsibilities. nil My first visit to Nazim Pasha was paid at the sarai on the 25th of May. The interview was of the formal character ordinary on such occasions. XX. British Official Matters. *»■“' “'“‘'I! to b J' ■“ British subjects.15 The Resident happened to be at Musal; and there he received the condolences oftheWali and of the Chaldaean Patriarch, both of whom had had the honour of being presented to His late Majesty. At Baghdad it devolved on Captain McPherson, the Assistant Resident, to ^ receive the visits and letters of condolence; and the attitude of all classes, includ ing Turkish officials, was sympathetic and considerate. A brief report by Captain McPherson on the subject of the proceedings at Baghdad is attached to this sum mary. At Karbala, I regret to say, the Persian Consul at first demurred to half-mast ing his flag; and the Turkish Mutasarrif, though he paid a visit of condolence to the British Vice-Consulate, altogether declined to do so on the ground that there was no such custom except at' ports and marine stations. (2) A short account by Captain McPherson of the proceedings at the reading of the Declaration and Proclamation of His Majesty King George V., which took place in the Residency garden at 5 p.m. on the 12th May, is appended to this sum mary. I consider that Captain McPherson acted rightly in parading the military guard and crew of the R. I. M.' S. Comet upon this occasion, and that he could not with propriety have abstained from doing so ; but it was an unfortunate coin cidence, in view of the jealousy with which the presence of the British establishments at Baghad is regarded by the Turks, that the new Wali should have chosen to visit the Residency immediately before the hour of the ceremonial, and so become a spectator of the preparations for the modest display. (3) Below is the time table of a tour which I made during April and May in the Baghdad and Musal Wilayats of this province after obtaining the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. I was accompanied (except between the 5th and the 7th of May) by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, the Commercial Assis tant attached to this Residency. 12th April.

Of this dis tance about 35 miles was performed in a carriage, 465 miles on horseback and on foot, and 300 miles by raft. A large quantity of information was collected, which it will take much time to collate and arrange. (4) At Musal I delivered to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul the Govern- • See Summary for November 1909, V-4, revolvers and ammunition, intended fqr him, which had been lying at Baghdad for some months past on account of the obstacles thrown by the Turkish authorities in the way of their removal to Musal. (5) The first paper to be put in my hands signed by Nazim Pasha, after my return to Baghdad, was an official letter in which he asked me to do away with the present uniform of the Residency Qawasses and to substitute another of a pattern in use at certain British Consulates in Western Turkey. The chief reason given for requesting a change was the resemblance of the present uniform to that of a Turkish soldier, which mig'ht, it was feared, accidentally give rise to some dis agreeable incident. I thought it unnecessary to mention—what the Wali prob ably knew quite well—that the matter had recently been under discussion at Constantinople; so I merely replied that the present uniform had been in use for some years, that no disagreeable incident had as yet occurred, and that, as a change would be expensive, I trusted His Excellency would not press the matter. (6) During my absence from Baghdad informal enquiries were made by the Turkish authorities as to whether citations for British subjects would be accepted at the Residency, if sent there direct by the summoning courts or authorities instead of through the Wali. If the question is repeated I shall say that, until I am authorised to do so by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, I cannot deal officially with any other authority in the Wilayat than the Wali, nor make any innovation in the established practice in regard to citations. (7) About 10 days after his arrival at Baghdad, Nazim Pasha reported secretly to the Turkish Government on the subject of the British Residency. He complained of the extent of the grounds and of the size ’of the buildings, which he said almost formed a town-quarter, and he regretted that the British Govern ment should ever have been allowed to acquire the site in freehold. He went on to recommend that steps should be taken to obtain the abolition of the British Post Office at Baghdad, and the removal to India of the Residency Guard and of the R.I.M.S. Comet. I am sorry to say that this information comes from a good source, and that I believe it to be substantially correct. X.— Foreign Interests and Cases (other than Persian and British). (1) M. Benzengre,f formerly Russian Vice-Consul at Musal, did not return to his post, as it was expected that he would, t See last Summary, x-2. when he left Baghdad last Ja nuary. On tour in Kurdistan, in April, I was told that he had passed through Sal hiyeh (K fri) and Kirkuk about three months before, and had last been heard of at the Turkish military station of Banah on the disputed frontier of Turkey and Persia. It seems probable that he had been recalled to Russia and went via Persia. (2) A fracas seems to have taken place, before reaching Jeddah, on board the , „ . , q 0 „ T Y 9 Russian steamer on which M. Maschkow,}; f See last Summary, X-2, ^ Russian Consul . General at Baghdad, was a home ward-bound passenger. One or more persons are said to have been killed; and it is stated that, in consequence of telegraphic representations made by M. Maschkow to his Embassy, some Turkish officers who were travelling onC-440 F.D. the ship were obliged to disembark at Jeddah. Sensational versions of the affair are current at Baghdad and have appeared in the local papers. (3) M. Orloff, the successor of M. Maschkow, announced to his colleagues by letter on his arrival that he had come to carry on the duties of Russian Consul- General at Baghdad. It is observed that on his visiting card, which has “ Baghdad ” in one corner and must therefore have been printed for use here, he describes himself as Consul only. He has made some enquiries from me as to the manner in which certain expenses of the Residency are apportioned between Government and myself ; and, from these and other indications, I am inclined to think that a modification of the Russian Consular establishment here is under consideration. (4) It was reported to me on fairly good authority, about the beginning of April, that M. Orloff had addressed letters to Saiyid Muhammad Kazim (Tabata- bayi), Mulla Kazim (Khurasani), and Shaikh ’ Abdullah (Mazandarani), the lead* ing Mujtahids of Najaf, stating that he had heard them praised, even before his arrival at Baghdad, in a manner which inclined him to be their friend; that he therefore informed them that a Russian Consul would presently be sent to Najaf to protect Russian pilgrims at that place; and that this Consul would always be ready to render the Mujtahids such services as were in his power. The Tabata- bayi, it is said, merely acknowledged the receipt of this letter, while the Khura* sani and Mazandarani replied, in somewhat effusive terms, which they now regret. On my asking M. Orloff, some time after this, whether he was aware of any intention on the part of his Government to establish a Consular post at Najaf, he replied that he had no knowledge of any such intention. He added that if any existed, he thought it would certainly have been mentioned to him at St. Peters burg or Constantinople, both of which he had lately visited. About the middle of April Mehdi Quli, the Russian Consular Agent at Kazi- main, arrived at Karbala; and the next day he left for Najaf. At Najaf he took a house, and a week later he was followed there by his family, whom he had brought with him to Karbala. He remained at Najaf a month or six weeks and then returned to Kazimain. The explanation given by him of his journey was that the air of Najaf had been recommended for one of his daughters who was ill. In view of the communications constantly going on between the Mujtahids of Najaf and political leaders in Persia, as described in Section VI above, the value to Russia at the present time of an agency at Najaf is apparent. Nevertheless, according to the latest information, it is possible that M. OrlofCs letters were merely formal and said nothing about a Najaf agency, and that the Kazimain Agent's journey was connected with his daughter's illness. (5) M. Rouet, the French Consul at Baghdad, left overland for Europe on the 22nd May. He has been succeeded by M. Wiet from Bairut, whose father-in-law is Mr. Catoni, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Alexandretta. M. Route who met with a serious carriage accident last autumn, was in a somewhat feeble state of health when he left Baghdad; and it is a satisfaction to his friends to know that he is not unaccompanied on the journey. (6) M. Asfar, the Spanish Consul at Baghdad, lately had a quarrel with the Commandant of Gendarmerie in consequence of the failure of some Dhabitiyahs at one of the city police posts to salute him as he passed. It is understood that M. Asfar was informed by the Turkish local authorities that no Consul is entitled to salutes, as of right, except when in uniform. M. Asfar, who is a native of Baghdad and a Turkish subject, after this wrote to a local Arabic newspaper, complaining of the attitude of the Commandant and indicating that Turkish officials ought to be more polite if they wished ever to see the capitulations abolished. His letter only tvoted a chorus of ridicule in the Baghdad press. Meanwhile the question of salutes had been referred to Constantinople; and the result is understood to be an order from the Minister of V ar, to the effect that, in future, Consuls are to be saluted when in uniform and are not to be saluted when in plain clothes.18 (7) The first Consul at Baghdad to have serious business with Nazim Pasha’s Government was Mr. Simpich, who represents the United States. M. Kouyoum- diian, the Honorary Dragoman of the American Consulate, owns land at Fallujah, and he happened to be visiting his estate during the recent small * expedition by the Turks against the Bilaim. ’Askari Bey, * See II-3 ; above. commanded the expedition, sent for M. Kouyoumdjian and, when the latter complied with the summons, arrested him on a charge of having informed the Arabs of the approach of the troops. His house was searched; his books and papers were seized; and a telegram which the Dragoman addressed to his Consul was intercepted, or at least never reached its destination. On the 28th of May, M. Kouyoumdjian having in the meantime been conveyed to Baghdad in custody and lodged in the Gendermerie offices, Mr. Simpich pr - ceeded to the sarai and sought an interview with the Mali. This was refused, ^ T7 o u and Mr. Simpich found himself obliged to fSee - a ove. w ith Eram Bey f instead. The result, however, was that M. Kouyoumdjian was released and allowed to go away with Mr. Simpich. The only sort of explanation vouchsafed by Eram Bey was a state ment, in Mr. Simpich’s opinion certainly untrue, that the Turkish authorities had acted in ignorance of M. Kouyoumdjian’s status as a dragoman. The afiair in this respect resembles the British case at present pending % at Musal. I understand that the view of the x See 1-3 above. ~L 0 c&amp;\ Government now is that, in releasing the dragoman at Mr. Simpich’s request, they have d&lt; ne all that can be expected of them. The American Consul, however, does not see the matter m the same light. (8) M. Zunini, my Italian colleague, informs me that lately one of his Qaw- wases, though wearing uniform, was taken into custody and detained for about an hour without previous reference to himself. I do not know what steps, if any, M. Zunini has taken in the matter. (9) M. Orloff (Russia) and Dr. Hesse (Germany) carry the most weight, I should say, of my foreign colleagues here. Both of them seem to be clear-headed and self-reliant men. Mr. Simpich (America) is quick and intelligent, but he was Journalist until last year, and he has not yet entirely thrown off the habits of his rormer profession. (10) The question of the acceptance § direct from the Turkish judicial author- ities of summons for service on its subjects § ee i a ove * j ias bggjj lately broached to more than one Consulate besides the British. I am informed that the Russian and Italian Con suls have agreed, and that the American Consul has demurred to the desired change of procedure. (11) At the beginning of April an Austrian botanist, Prof. Dr. Fr. Nabelek, who was here about Chritsmas time, again appeared at Baghdad. He left not long after for Musal via Kirkuk. Two other Austrian scientists passed through Bagh dad about the middle of April and reached Musal, I believe, on the 16th of May : these were Dr. Phil H. Freiherr Y. Handel-Mazzetti, Assistant in the Botanical Institute and Garden at Vienna University, and Dr. V. Pietschmann, Assistant in the Court Museum of National History at Vienna. The latter gentleman was a zoologist. Before leaving Baghdad this pair made a flying visit to the Hilla neighbourhood, to assist them in which the Assistant Resident provided them with a letter of introduction to the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. (12) On our return journey from Musal, Mr. Gaskin and I visited the German archeeological station at Sharqat on the right bank of the Tigris. We met with a very hearty reception from Dr. Andre and his four European colleagues. The principal work of the excavators at present seems to consist in disentang ling foundations of different dates, and so tracing the succession of the temples which from the second millennium B. C. down to the Muhammadan U )1 | ( l u ® s ’ seem continuously to have crowned the great mound of Sharqat. Detache objects of interest or value are not plentiful, if the complaints of the workers are to19 be believed; but, here as at Babylon, great reticence is maintained as to results; and one of the store-rooms shown us was built up almost to the roof with strongly made boxes containing inscribed bricks, etc., for despatch to Europe. Nothing of importance, so I have been informed by the members of the staff at both places, will be published until the excavations are finally closed ; and at neither is the end yet in sight. The money for the excavations, or a large part of it, is provided by the Prussian (not the German) Parliament; and the excava tions are directed by a Committee connected with the Berlin Museum. XI.— Commercial matters. (1) The activity of the Wali and his staff promises to create new openings for trade in various directions. t The construction of an iron bridge over the Tigris at Baghdad is said to have been resolved upon, and encjuiries will perhaps soon be made about small steamers for ferry and passenger work. Mr. Prince, representing Messrs. Cooper, Allen and Co. of Cawnpore, India, arrived at Baghdad on the 19th May, to deliver 1,000 military saddles for which his firm had received an order from Constantinople. The Chief of Staff told me afterwards that the saddles were most satisfactory; and to some one else he said that they were even better than the original samples. Mr. Prince is still at Bagh- tnm irom maia are imuer eAammai/iun m - — On the Chief of Staff informing me that it was intended to put the troops of the 6th Army Corps into a uniform of khaki drill, and on his further asking me to help him in the matter, I showed him as samples some articles belonging to the ■Residency guard, which met with his approval, and wired to the Government of India to ascertain the terms, etc., on which a trial order for 5,000 uniforms could be placed with Indian manufacturers. I am not sure that the Chief of Staff really means business ; but the possibility, even remote, of contracts for the clothing of a whole Army Corps being secured for India seemed to me to ]nsti fv the reference.20 them sunk, part of their crews scrambling on board the Comet ; and the British vessel began to drag her anchor and disappeared into the darkness. Captain Finnis, B. I. M., and Mr. Gain, the gunner, who were on shore at the time, put oft in a rowing boat with Mr. Szulczewski, an officer of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company j the river was running very high at the time, and the crew of the boat, consisting of Chaldaeans in the Company’s employment, refused to accompany them and at first tried to keep possession of the boat. Meanwhile the lascars of the Comet, under the orders of a native tindal, got another anchor out and succeeded in bringing her up before she had gone many hundred yards. The officers, however, were carried past the Comet, which then lowered a boat to their assistance. In the end everyone reached a place of safety, the officers coming ashore on the left bank of the river some distance downstream. The sepoys of the Residency guard behaved well and with their help the Re sidency motor launch was saved from being dashed on shore. Next morning the Comet was got under steam and returned to her usual station. Much damage was done by the storm in Baghdad city and its neighbourhood, and some lives were lost, chiefly on the river. I had never seen such a duststorm, even in India; and the like has not been known at Baghdad for some thirty years. (3) A remarkable display was given on the night of the 25th May at the school of the Alliance Israelite Universelle at Baghdad. It consisted chiefly of recitations and theatrical representations by pupils of the school. His Excellency Nazim Pasha, under whose patronage the proceedings were held, was present throughout them with a number of his staff. The last piece was a short play entitled Abtal- al-Hurriyah or “ the Heroes of Freedom,” which had Niazi Bey, Anwar Bey and Mustafa Effendi for the principal characters, and the neighbourhood of Salonica immediately before the grant of the Constitution for the scene of action. This play was written by an Egyptian Christian named Antun-al-Jamayil. Noth with standing, or perhaps because of, the patriotic sentimentalism with which it abounded, some of the principal officials present seemed ill at ease during its performance. My place was next the Governor-General; and the Wali of Basrah, perhaps because he was out of his own Wilavat. insisted on sitting somewhat behind me.■■MB ?tain JtoS %is Itle i XII.— General and Miscellaneous. (1) About five months ago the Acting Wall o Baghdad was supposed to have received orders from Constantinople to facilitate tae business of foreign Consulates and to treat the Consulates with consideration. I am ^formed that, between the reached the Walls of Baghdad and Basrah from the capital. It was explained m these communications, which came from the Ministry of the Interior, that impor tant matters were under consideration at Constantinople, making it necessary humour the Powers; possibly the reference was to Cretan questions.Fret translation of the Farman of appointment of Nazim Pasha, Civil and Military Governor of Baghdad. To Nazim Pasha, General of Division of the. First Class, and Member of the Military Council of State, who has been invested with the Governorship of the Baghdad Wilayat and the Command of the VIth Army Corps. Whereas it is our desire not only to ameliorate the Wilayat of Baghdad and to increase and develop its wealth and trade, but also to reorganize and improve our Vlth Army Corps. We have deemed it advisable to amalgamate the two appointments and to entrust the duties of the same to an experienced and vigilant man. And whereas you, the said Nizim Pasha, are known to be zealous and trust worthy, and possess a thorough knowledge of civil and military affairs, and are one of our most distinguished Military commanders, we have, upon a request, issued our Imperial Iradah, appointing you to be Governor and Commander-in- Chief of the aforesaid ilayat, and at the same time authorising you to retain your Membership of the aforesaid Military Council of State. On your arrival at your destination you will investigate the condition of the staff of the Army Corps ; that of the military officers generally, both senior and junior and that of the Civil Officials. Should you find some among them who are incapable, you will dismiss them at once and substitute others ; and you will see to it that the technical requirements in connection with these measures are fulfilled without delay by the various departments concerned. Inasmuch as the Basrah and Musal Wilayats are comprised in the territorial limits of the Vlth Army Corps, it will be well that the Governors of these Wilayats should correspond and act in harmony with you so far as the public safety and good government are concered ; nevertheless each of them will be responsible for the security and administration of the districts within his province. The Sub lime Porte has issued instructions in the above sense to the said Walis. You may, until your command shall have been properly reorganized, retain with the Vlth Army Corps, the four battalions belonging to the Vlth Army Corps which are now at Musal. You may also obtain from the Vlth Army Corps a suffi cient number of military recruits for the purpose of inuring them to the climate of Mesopotamia. Instructions have been sent to the Minister of War for the purchase of four armoured motor-launches from Europe, which will be delivered at Basrah as soon as possible and will be stationed on the Shatt-al-’ Arab (or, when necessary, on the Euphrates and Tigris), for the purpose of conveying troops, etc. The Minister of War has been instructed to consult with you in regard to the supply of clothing and equipment to the troops under your command, in regard to the provision of modern scientific military appliances which may be wanting, and in regard to the despatch of the articles in question. Orders have been given to the Minister of Marine to send three gunboats and another vessel to the Persian Gulf for use as transports. These vessels will be under your orders. Inasmuch as the present revenues of the Wilayat will not suffice to meet the expenditure, orders have been given to the Minister of Finance to liquidate the monthly deficits through a bank and to dispose of all treasury questions. The Minister of Public Works has been directed to allot a sum of not less than £ T. 40,000 a year for the improvement and constructions of roads, etc., within the Wilayat after the necessary papers have been sent in due form to his department. All the measures required for the prompt improvement and amelioration of both military and civil conditions in your Government have been adopted, and we trust that you, whose ability and zeal are well known, will do your utmost to perform your duties to our satisfaction, and to ensure that our subjects benefit by the reign of liberty, justice and equality established by the fundamental 3aw of the Constitution. We expect you to give your particular attention to this most important point.

Proceedings at the British Political Residency, Baghdad, in connection with the decease of His late Majesty King Edward VII. On the morning of Sunday, 8th May 1910, telegrams from Foreign Office, Simla, and from British Embassy, Constantinople, were received at this Consulate- General, and conveyed the news of the death of His Gracious Majesty King Edward. His Excellency the Wali of Baghdad and all the Consuls were notified by letters, on receipt of which the flags of the various national representatives were put at half-mast. Our own flags at the Besidency and on the Comet had already been flown at half-mast. The Residency Surgeon remained in the Consulate between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. to receive visits of condolence. The first to arrive were the Austrian, German and American Consuls, who appeared in the order named. They all adverted sympathetically to the great loss sustained by the British nation in the death of such a Sovereign. In the evening came Eram Bey, the Dragoman of His Excellency the Wali, charged with the mission of conveying His Excellency’s sorrow and sympathy. He was accompanied by Colonel Hassan Reza, Chief of the Staff of the 6th Army Corps. Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Kamal Siri, head of the 11th Division, arrived later. The Consul-General of Russia called personally to expre^his regret. Cards were sent by Dr. Lanzoni, Director of Quarantine, Cav. Carlo, Colonel of Imperial Ottoman Gendermarie, and Archbishop Drure. The Italian Consul sent a letter of condolence. On Monday 9th Nawab Ahmed Agha called. Letters were received from Mr. Asfar, Spanish Consul, and Dr. Johnson of the Protestant mission. Dr. Stanley sent a card. On Tuesday 10th Ahmed Ali Khan, son of Nawab Ahmed Agha, accom panied by the son and grandson of the chief of the Kurdish tribe of Jaaf, called to express sympathy. In the afternoon five representatives of the Jewish community called together and expressed to the Residency Surgeon the deep regret felt by their people on the death of our King who, they said, had so interested himself in elevating the status of the Jews. They remarked that not only their community here, but Jews in other parts of the world, would be profoundly affected by his loss. The gentlemen who called were the Chief Rabbi, Menahem Saleh Daniel, H. Yahouda, H. Isaac and Joseph H. Schemtob. h i*1 23 l ^ e ^ nes( ^f , y llth at 3 Turkish.

Proceedings at the British Political Residency, Baghdad, in connection with the read ing of the Declaration and Proclamation of His Majesty King George F. I have the honour to report that on the receipt here of the telegram announc ing the contents of the Gazette Extraordinary 1107, dated May 9th, which was immediately to be published, steps were at once taken to acquaint the British and British Indian residents of Baghdad with the contents of that Gazette. It was further stated that a parade would take place at the Consulate-General at 5 p. m, on May 12th, at which the Proclamation and Declaration would be publicly read. ^ British and British Indian residents were invited to be present on the occasion. The Residency Guard, consisting of a native officer and 36 sepoys, the whole ship’s company of the gunboat R. I. M. S. Comet, and the Qawasses of this Consulate-General were drawn up so as to occupy two adjoining sides of the lawn of the Consulate which faces towards the entrance to that building. The remain ing two sides were occupied by visitors. On the lawn was erected a flagstaff, from which the flag flew at half-mast during the first part of the ceremony. Captain Finnis, R. I. M., took command of the troops and lascars. In the absence on tour of Mr. Lorimer, the Resident and Consul-General, the Proclama tion and Declaration were read by the Residency Surgeon, who took his posi tion to the right of the flagstaff. Following the English version, an Urdu trans lation was recited for the benefit of the Indian subjects of His Majesty. On the completion of the reading, and at the word of command, the troops and lascars delivered the Royal salute, the appropriate bugle call followed, and the flag was run up to full mast. The Residency Surgeon then called for three cheers for His Majesty, King George V., a call to which a most hearty response was made. After the Proclamation Parade, the British residents and many of the British Indians adjourned to the further lawn where refreshments had been provided. The toast of King George’s health was drunk with acclamation. The parade was well attended, all the British residents together with some visitors being present, while representatives from the principal Indian families in Baghdad and Kadhimain were also in attendance.
