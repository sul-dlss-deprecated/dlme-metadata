Among these was a proposal made by the Russian Government to us regarding a r-ndo-e of territory lying between the Russian and, Afghan frontiers. Directly thia was published we communicated with India as to the'desirability of.the Viceroy writing to the Amir of Afghanistan to warn him and explain the purport of the negotiation before he received it from butside channels.

Political agreements concluded between Allies during war must remain intact and are not subject revision. They include agreement with France England on Constantinople the Straits Syria Asia Minor also London treaty with Italy, All suggestions for future delimination of Central Europe are at present premature but in general one must bear in mind we prepared allow France England complete freedom drawing up Western Frontiers Germany in expectation that Allies on their part would allow us equal freedom drawing up our frontiers with Gefmany and Austria. Tis particularly necessary insist on exclusion or Polish question from subjects of international discussion and elimination of all attempts to place future of Poland under guarantee and control of Powers. With regard to Scandinavian States tis necessary endeavour keep back Sweden from any action hostile to us and al same time examine betimes measures fnv * on _ for impossible Norway on our side in case it should prove —- — - with Sweden. Rumania has already been offered all war advantages which could^ induce her take up arms would be perfectly futile search for new baits attractin to proven. — r - . , . , political advantages which could^ induce her take up arms and therefore would be perfectly futile search for new baits in this respect. Question pushing out Germans from Chinese market is of very great importance, but solutions impossible without participat Japan.

This does not exclude desirability of preliminary exchange views on subject between Russ: and England by diplomatic means. (Signed) Sazonoff. Draper.IHDU OFFICE •flaTIJIAUi 8th ix»cpmb&lt;»r 1V17.

I have to say that we have given instructions which will prevent this being cabled or being published in our Press if it should be submitted to our censors;- but as the Foreign Office have withdrawn all Censorship in so far as it relates to Foreign affairs it is possible that some paper may publish the objectionable matter without submission.

W'e see no early prospect of desiring to take advantage of either of these/e-n^»haiif*ftl4-\y either in regard to concessions in Tibet or sending British Agent to Lhasa. We understand Anglo-Tibetau declaration by which Convention was made binding on England and Tibet has not been communicated to Russian Government, and we see no reason why it should now be communicated. All that need be said is that tripartite Convention remains unsigned by China, and that we* therefore can give no quid pro quo on chance of it being signed. The only other matters in regard to which Russia could take exception are, lirst, our having direct communications with Tibet Government, and, second, revision of trade regulations. As regards former, attitude of China has rendered these inevitable, and there would appear to be no reason to say anything to Russia on the subject unless she raises question. As regards these latter, if publication is considered necessary they might be notified under Article I., Anglo-Chinese Convention, 1906, as heretofore. This does not conflict with Anglo-Russian Convention. We shall reply to your paragraph 2 on receipt of papers.

Apart from this, if Amir maintains his present attitude in lace of strong counter influences, we shall be under con siderable obligations to [?him] at end of war, as also will Russia. Any Anglo-Russian declaration immediately after war regarding Northern Afghanistan could only result in arousing liveliest suspicions in Afghanistan where public opinion is already considerably exercised by our alliance with Russia. Such declaration, however harmless, would be regarded as act of per tidy and menace to integrity of Afghanistan and inevitably estrange Amir, further, as a matter of actual fact, it must lit* obvious to Russia that we have no intention or prospect of doing anything in Northern Afghanistan in regard to irrigation, railways, &amp;e., when we cannot even in Southern Afghanistan construct the railways or telegraphs which we desire to. At the same time we are quite prepared after the conclusion of war, to attempt to induce the Amir, if necessary, by means of a mission to remove such commercial and other inconveniences as Russia has reason to complain at present, and generally to improve Russo-Afghan relations on the northern frontier. As regards Oxus irrigation scheme we must adhere to views expressed in our telegram of 22nd duly 19TI that Russian Government should fully explain necessity for choosing Afghan territory for construction of proposed works before subject can be again considered.

Grey to transmit to you herewith to be laid before the Secre tary of State for India, a copy of a memorandum cornmuni cated to this Department by the Hussion Ambassador, in the last paragraph of which the desire is expressed that the questions relating to Northern Afghanistan, raised in the course of the Tibetan negotiations of last summer, should be settled in accordance with the wishes then formulated by the Russian Government. The Afghan question was only reopened last summer, at the instance of the Russian Government, and in response to their desire for a M quid pro quo in return for the concessions they were prepared to make in connection with the draft Tripartite Agreement between Tbe Under Secretary of State India Office.(34054/15) between Great Britain Tibet and. China. The Tibetan situation has since been modified so profoundly by the continued refusal of the Chinese Government to sign the Convention that the acceptance by the Russian Government of its provisions in the limited form proposed last summer would no longer seem to possess the same value as an offset to a revision in their favour, of the existing arrangement with respect to Northern Afghanistan, as it did when the negotiations were suspended. It appears probable however, that Monsieur Sazonoff will recur to this question and Sir E. Grey would be glad to be informed of the views of the Secretary of State for India with respect to it.

YOUR despatch No. 180 of 11th June : Thibet. /'The Chinese Government have refused to accept the boundaries laid down in the initialled convention, and insisted on claiming a line in the north and east of Thibet which was not jnstitied by the evidence presented to the conference, and which it would have been hopeless to expect the Thibetan Government to accept. £sThe Chinese Government were so informed and pressed to sign the convention as initialled, a hint being given that His Majesty’s Government might, if they consented to do so, urge the Thibetan Government to concede to China one tract on the northern boundary. i&gt;vThe Chinese Government refused to give way on the boundary question, and merely offered to give their adhesion to the major articles of the convention. /r A final meeting of the conference was held on 3rd July, at which the British and Thibetan delegates initialled fresh copies of the convention, so as to include the two new articles 10 and 11 (providing respectively that the English text shall be authoritative, and that the convention shall come into force from the date of signature), and omitting article 10 as originally drafted, to which the Russian Government had objected. 57They also executed final copies of the Trade Regulations. ^British delegate stated in full conference that convention as initialled represents settled views of His Majesty’s Government as to the status and boundaries of Thibet. -7 Your Excellency should inform Russian Government, and should explain to them that His Majesty’s Government have exhausted every effort to secure tripartite signature ; that the Chinese Government have accepted the whole convention, with the exception of the boundary clause, without difficulty; and that His Majesty s Government still hope that they may, after reflection, agree to signature. Meanwhile His Majesty’s Government will not act upon any provisions of the^ convention as initialled which are contrary to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 190&lt; without first consulting the Russian Government. Following is for your confidential information only : British and Thibetan delegates recorded at the same time a declaration to the effect that they acknowledged the convention as initialled to be binding on their respective Governments, and that they held China to be debaired from hei pnw eges under the convention as long as she withheld signature. , The Thibetan delegate has been given a private assurance that His Majesty s Government will afford facilities for the supply of arms and ammunition fiom India m the event of Chinese aggression.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 15.) St. Petersburgh, June 11, 1914 I HA\E the honour to enclose copy of a private letter which, on the receipt’of 4 1 /-V s-n-wn -w* AT O A /-V 4 - Vv ^ T _ ,1 1 J j i A your telegram No. 249 of the 6th June, I addressed to the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, embodying the terms of the arrangement which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept with regard to the Thibetan Convention, and of the reply which M. Sazonof handed to me in the course of a conversation which I had yesterday with his Excellency. As already reported in my telegram No. 131 of yesterday, M. Sazonof insisted on the line of demarcation of Northern Afghanistan being drawn to the south of the Heri- Eud so as to include Herat, on the grounds that the waters of that river were essential for the irrigation of the Transcaspian province, and he declared that the negotiations would break down were His Majesty’s Government to refuse to entertain this proposal. On my reminding him that the note defining the area of Northern Afghanistan was to be kept secret, so that the Russian public would not know whether the Heri-Rud was comprised in it or not, his Excellency contended that the term “ Northern Afghanistan,” which he had himself suggested, would be liable to different interpretations in England and in Russia and that there would consequently ensue a polemical discussion in the press of the two countries as so its exact meaning. After a prolonged conversation in which I told his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government could never give an engagement that might lend itself to the interpretation that they had disinterested themselves completely with regard to Herat, I said that, though they could not extend the area of Northern Afghanistan beyond the limits which they had laid down, His Majesty’s Government might undertake not to support demands for irrigation works, wherever situated, for which the water -was supplied by the Heri-Rud. Though this suggestion by no means satisfied his Excellency, he did not absolutely reject it. He dwelt at length on the importance of the irrigation question to Russia and remarked that the Afghans must be made to understand that they will not be allowed to sterilise the Transcaspian province by diverting the waters necessary for its irrigation. His Excellency also again referred to the impossibility of keeping secret the area comprised in the arrangement which it is proposed to make about Northern Afghanistan. Finally he said that, as he would not be able to discuss the matter with me again for another ten days, he would instruct M. Argyropoulo, who would be in charge of the Ministry during his absence, and the head of the Eastern Department, to endeavour to find some formula that would reconcile the views of the two Governments, and he suggested that I should continue the negotiations with these gentlemen in the event of my receiving further instructions from you. From my conversation with his Excellency I carried away the impression that, whether or not we come to an arrangement with Russia with regard to Northern Afghanistan, the Russian Government will before long take the law into their own hands if the Afghans persist in diverting the Tvaters of the Heri-Rud, and other rivers to the prejudice of Transcaspia. As his Excellency declined altogether to commit himself, it is difficult for me to say how far he is prepared to go to meet our wishes. He has, he told me, no objection to reaffirming his adhesion to the principle that Afghanistan is outside Russia’s sphere of political interest, but he still wishes to include Herat and both banks of the Heri-Rud within the area assigned to Northern Afghanistan. As, however, he ostensibly bases this claim on the sole ground that the Heri-Rud plays a very important part in the irrigation of Transcaspia he ought to be satisfied with the further undertaking which, as I gather from your telegram No. 249, of the 6th instant, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give with regard to that river. M. Sazonof will, however, probably insist on the publication of am arrangement M hich we may arrive at in its entirety, and I am not aware whether such a course would be agreeable to His Majesty’s Government.

It might perhaps facilitate matters were we to separate the question of irrigation works from that of railways in the engagement which we are asked to give about Afghanistan.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has no objection to reaffirming that Afghanistan is outside Russian sphere of political influence. ISir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received June 10, 10’45 p.m.) St. Petersburgh, June 10, 1914 (No. 131.) (June 10, 8 p.m.) ON receipt of your telegram No. 249 , I addressed private letter to Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs recapitulating terms of arrangement which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept, and I to-day discussed it with Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency said he could not possibly accept our proposed definition of Northern Afghanistan, as it left out the Hari Rud, most important river for irrigation purposes in Transcaspian province. Line of demarcation, he said, must follow mountain chain of Sefid mm! Ko^h to the south of the Hari Rud to point where that river commences to form frontier between Afghanistan and Persia. On my stating that I was precluded by my instructions from extending the area of Northern Afghanistan beyond the limits fixed in my letter, Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the negotiations would, in that case, break down, as this question of irrigation was a vital one for Russia. He had virtually allowed us to tear up the Thibetan Convention, and he must have something in return. * I replied that his Excellency had given me to understand that he only wanted to persuade Russian public that he had obtained quid pro quo, and in the notes which were to be pub lished limits of Northern Afghanistan were left undefined, so that public would not know whether the Hari Rud was comprised in it or not. Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that term “Northern Afghanistan” was too vague and would be interpreted in different sense by the “ Times ” and “ Novoe Vremya.” I replied that this • ' term had been chosen by his Excellency himself. We did not want to divert waters of these rivers, but it was a different thing to ask us to give an engagement which might later on be interpreted in the sense that we had disinterested ourselves complete!} 7 with regard to Herat. His Excellency remarked that Russia would no doubt be accused by British Radicals of having designs on Afghanistan, as she was already accused of wishing to annex north of Persia, but he did not care, as the water question was all- important. I then said that if he attached so much importance to the Hari Rud His Majesty’s Government might perhaps undertake not to support demands for irrigation works from any portion of that river, but they could not extend proposed area. This, however, did not satisfy his Excellency, who still insisted on his own line. Subsequently he said that if w r e gave such an undertaking it would have to be published. I replied that I could not promise this, but that if the engagement we were asked to give were restricted to irrigation works there could not be so much objection. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that question of railways was also very important, and contended that, if we did not publish exact area of Northern Afghanistan, there would be disputes about it in Parliament and in press of both countries. He was leaving to-night and would not be able to discuss question with me for another ten days, but he would give instructions to head of the department concerned to try and find some formula which would meet the circumstances of the case, and he proposed that I should communicate to the official in question any suggestions which I had to make on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. As I was leaving, his Excellency gave me written reply to my private letter, embodying what he had told me as to limits of Northern Afghanistan. It also expresses the wish that a clause may be added to the projected arrangement granting to Russian Buddhist pilgrims the right to proceed to Lhassa as they have done on several occasions by way of India, in the same manner as British Buddhist pilgrims, as access from the north is very difficult.2 There is, I think, some force in what his Excellency says as to the difficulty of keepin 0, secret area comprised in the term Noithern Afghanistan, and he will probably insist on publication whatever arrangement we may come to. It is possible that he might accept formula combining what you propose to insert in both the secret''' note and the note for publication with a categorical statement that we would suppoi. no demands for irrigation works for which the water was supplied by the Hari Rud. It would be well in any case that I should receive instructions that will enable me to continue negotiations with the head of the depaitment concerned during his Excellency’s absence.[This Document is the Property; of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] lengm me conversations wmcn i nave had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Thibet, and it is therefere unnecessary for me to do more than summarise their principal points in a despatch. In the first of these conversations M. Sazonof, while professing his anxiety to give us the substance of what we asked for, if only the lact that he was doing so could be kept secret, adopted nevertheless a very uncompromising attitude and insisted on obtaining some quid pro quo which would serve to satisfy llussian public opinion that he was not being made the dupe of England, as he had, alter the Potsdam interview, been accused of having been duped by Germany. He maintained, in spite of all my arguments to the contrary, that article 10 conferred on us the virtual protectorate over Thibet, and that his consent to article 8 must be conditional on Russia being accorded a similar right to send an agent to Lhassa. He scoffed at the idea of our agent being given the character of a commercial agent and said that he perfectly understood the political importance I which we attached to his visits. Though he subsequently made the suggestion that / we should omit all mention of them in the convention, and that Russia should give us a secret assurance not to raise objections to such visits when the occasion for them arose, he afterwards qualified this proposal by making it conditional on our taking a similar engagement with regard to Russia’s claim to send a native agent to Herat. I told him plainly that His Majesty’s Government could not possibly entertain any proposal of this kind, and that he was entirely mistaken in thinking that we were aiming at establishing a protectorate over Thibet. The measures which we wished to take to safeguard our interests there were the consequence of the changed status in Thibet that had resulted from Russia’s attitude in Mongolia. Our whole object was to prevent a situation arising that might force us to send another expedition to Lhassa as, if we did so, w r e should not retire as we had done in 1904 without settling the Thibetan question once and for all. His Excellency had said that he would not in the least mind our doing so, as he no doubt thought that, if we were to establish ourselves firmly at Lhassa,'he would be able to extract from us a very big quid pro quo. I on the contrary feared that Russia might in such cas3 ask for some thing which it would be impossible for us to give her, and that the Anglo-Russian understanding would, in consequence, break down altogether. I had hoped that he would have approached the question in a more generous spirit and not have haggled for his pound of flesh. It was not a very friendly proceeding on his Excellency’s part to meet our modest proposals, which did but slightly modify the letter of the 1907 agreement, with drastic counter-proposals, when Russia was violating the spirit of that agreement by her military occupation of North Persia. In my second conversation M. Sazonof adopted a much more friendly attitude. He greeted me by saying that we had placed him in a most difficult position, but that he was most anxious to do all he could to help us. All that he asked was that we should give him something in return which would, in the eyes of the public, cover the sacrifice which Russia would have to make of her treaty rights. He at first contended that the 1907 agreement could not be modified without the conclusion of a fresh convention, and said that he would in any case have to consult his colleagues a nd take the orders of the Emperor. He reverted once more to the question of Afghanistan, and said that nothing could be done by conversations between the water supply and to obtain an assurance that no railways prejudicial to her interests Would be eventually built in the north without her consent. I begged him not to press this question. The native agent might get into trouble with the authorities or [2142 y — lj THIBET AND MONGOLIA. [May 22.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [22809] No. 1.2 T)e assassinated, and Russia would next claim the ri'ht to despatch a punitive expedition. We also had many difficulties to put up with in our dealings with the Afghans. We had done all that we could to help Russia in the question of the water supply, but his Excellency must remember that, by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, we could only exercise our influence in Afghanistan in a pacific sensed Though his Excellency dropped the question of Afghanistan for the moment, it is one* which His Majesty’s Government must he prepared to see reopened at any moment Russia’s standpoint with regard to it is very similar to that of the European Powers as regards the application of the Monroe doctrine. If they may not themselves take measures to safeguard their threatened interests, they expect the United States to do so for them ; and if we are not able to procure satisfaction for Russia with regard to the irrigation and other kindred questions, she will one day insist on takin» the matter into her own hands. M. Sazonof next proceeded to discuss the various articles of the draft convention. I had, he said, made no mention in my note of what he termed the protectorate article (No. 10); and he would not listen to the arguments with which I endeavoured to explain its real bearing. With regard to articles 6 and 8 he claimed the insertion of clauses, which would secure to Russia rights similar to those which they conferred on us. After explaining the reasons which would render it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to accede to such a request, I said that, though I was precluded by my instructions from consenting to any modification in the wording of the convention, I was prepared to discuss these articles with him, on the distinct understanding that any suggestions which I might make were to be considered as purely personal on ray part and as in no way committing His Majesty’s Government. I then asked whether, if His Majesty’s Government were to consent to replace article 10 by an article declaring the English text of the convention authoritative, he would on his part withdraw his objections to articles 6 and 8. His Excellency replied that such a change would be very agreeable to him. We then proceeded once more to discuss articles 6 and 8, and after considering various possible ways of eliminating the appearance of any differential treatment of Russia, his Excellency said that he might perhaps allow them to stand on the following conditions, namely, that His Majesty s Government should, by an exchange of notes, engage not to put article 8 into force without a previous agreement with Russia; while, as regarded article 6, both Governments should undertake not to ask for concessions for their respective subjects without a previous mutual understanding. These notes would have to be published simultaneously with the convention. If this were done he might, he thought, be prepared to give us a secret written engagement not to oppose the visits of our agent to Lhassa, nor to raise objections to requests for concessions made by Rutish subjects. He might even engage not to support such requests if put forward by Russian subjects. M. Sazonof, however, said that he must have a little time to think it over before committing himself definitely; and he would, therefore, ask me o come and see him again this afternoon. I was equally careful to explain that I had no authority to commit His Majesty’s Government. As Mr. Nugent, who has been of great assistance to me throughout these negotiations, is leaving for London this evening, I shall he unable to record the resu t of my conversation with M. Sazonof in this despatch. Whether, however, his Excellency adheres or not to what he said yesterday, I fear that it will be impossible o induce mm to accord us better terms. If they, therefore, do not commend emseives to His Majesty’s Government, the onlv alternative left to us is to offer his excellency some counter concession outside Thibet. M. Sazonof’s tenure of office is at ® ec . ure ’ and there are again rumours of the approaching appointment of M. Knvoshein a confirmed Nationalist—to the post of President of the Council. I have no confirmation of this report at present; but should it prove to be correct it t\ou ien er i still more difficult for M. Sazonof to make concessions to us ; if, indeed, as some peop c e icve, it does not eventually lead to his resignation. * in tlie course of our discussions on article 6 I pointed out that, while we had no in en ion 0 exercising our veto in a manner prejudicial to Russian interests, Russia, ) le posi ion w ich she had now secured at Urga, was able to exercise a very effective ye f ° fl 0V 1 er v ° Ur a&lt; ^ ( l ullin o those commercial rights and privileges to which we were entitled by our treaty with China. On his Excellency declaring that Russia possessed no right of veto of tins kind, I observed that though his statement was technically eorreet, the result was very much the same, as I had had to appeal to him to help us to secure the maintenance of the open door in Outer Mongolia. I had not, I added,yet received a reply from his Excellency to the representations which I had addressed to him on the subject. M. Sazonof replied that he had told me that we could send our goods, as the Germans did, over the Russo-Mongolian frontier and thus avoid the payment of all dues. I said that I had not regarded this suggestion as On official reply to my representations, and that I had pointed out at the'time that we could not consent to our goods, which entered Mongolia over the Chinese fron ier being subjected to h-km or other internal dues from which Russian goods were exempted M Sazonof replied that no duty of any kind could be levied on Russian goods, and that he could not prevent the Mongols levying li-kin dues on goods which were imported by way of China. 8 Should, as I gather the official reply which his Excellency has promised to send me, be to the above effect, I fear that nothing that I may say will induce him to alter it. As, however, he admits that Kussia cannot exercise a right of veto in commercial questions, there is nothing to prevent our endeavouring to secure better terms bv direct negotiations with the Mongols.

You should at the same time show Minister for Foreign Affairs the following draft note:— (R.) “ His Majesty’s Government have the honour to communicate to the Imperial Russian Government a copy of a convention which has been signed between Great Britain, China, and Thibet. His Majesty’s Government recognise that articles 6 and 8 of this convention confer certain powers on Great Britain, the exercise of which, in a measure, conflict with the provisions of the Anglo-Russian Convention regarding Thibet of 1907. His Majesty’s Government therefore engage that they will not exercise the powers conferred by the above-mentioned articles until they have come to an under standing with the Imperial Russian Government on the subject.” (End of R.) You should explain to Minister for Foreign Affairs that this draft note will be signed and presented by you as soon as the Tripartite Convention is signed; and that, should this latter instrument be published, the Minister for Foreign Affairs can, should he think it desirable, also make public the note, and we shall be prepared to do this also. It is possible that the deletion of article 10, which will have to be brought to the knowledge of the Chinese and Thibetan delegates at the Conference in India, may lead to some delay in the signature of the convention, as the Chinese Government may very likely take the opportunity of endeavouring to revise one or other article of the convention. In the meantime discussions can proceed between His Majesty s Govern ment and the Russian Government in respect to the Russian proposal concerning concessions in Northern Afghanistan, and further instructions will be sent to you on these points very shortly. . Even if an arrangement between His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government is not reached before the signature of the tripartite Convention, the official note formally recording the assurances of His Majesty s Government as respects articles 6 and 8 will safeguard and cover all Russian interests pending a definite understanding between the two Governments.

He said if it was impossible to postpone signature he would not make difficulties, but that he must insist on its text being kept secret until a final agreement had been come to.

VICEROY’S telegram, Secret, of 21st May Minister for Foreign Affairs’ objections to article 10 are, I fear, insuperable and we have now, by commumcatron which I made to him yesterday respecting P provisional arrangement, virtually agreed to delete it. ^ ^ ^ piovisional As regards condition 3, I gathered Minister for Foreign Affairs perfectly under- stands that agent will m reality perform political duties, but that he wishes that this fact should be veiled from public by agent ostensibly having purely commercial mission. to hJl t V rnp0 M- lb - e . t0 ^ rra £g e f or proposed note respecting Northern Afghanistan to be kept seciet, as Minister for horeign Affairs wants to represent it to Russian public as a counter-concession to what he is giving us in Thibet. It might perhaps be possible to find formula which would render it less liable to misconception on the part of the Ameer. Note might, for example, commence with a reference to interests which Russia as a limitrophe State, has in such questions as that of irriga tion and to fact that she has by the agreement of 1907 recognised Afghanistan as outside sphere of her influence, and then proceed to state that His Majesty’s overnment engage not to support demand of British subjects for irrigation works, &amp;c. it might be worth while to try whether Minister for Foreign Affairs would accept some such formula. r Viceroys suggestion that Ameer would-be precluded by engagement which we are asked to take from giving a concession 'to a British subject would, if acted on expose us to charge of breach of faith. As Minister for Foreign Affairs expressly said that projected note about Northern .Persia is not conditional to his assent to Thibetan arrangement, I do not think that it need influence our decision with regard to latter. He has for more than a year been c aiming more elbow-room for Russia in Northern Persia, and has constantly protested against repiesentations which I have so often been obliged to make about the improper conduct of Russian consuls. The note will perhaps force us to have a serious conver sation with the Russian Government about Northern Persia and the neutral zone, but I do not see how such a conversation is to be staved off for long.

(No. 224.) Foreign Office, May 22, 1914, 6*30 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 117 of 19tli May. 1 have, in conjunction with the Secretary of State for India, carefully considered the points raised by Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs in your conversation with him. I should wish you to convey to Minister for Foreign Affairs my best thanks for the friendly and conciliatory spirit in which he has dealt with the question. It will, of course, be necessary to ascertain the views of the Government of India, and it will therefore be materially impossible for us to give the Minister for Foreign Affairs a reply by Sunday or Monday. On the other hand, it may be impossible to defer signature of the Tripartite Convention for several weeks without running the risk of fresh outbreak of trouble between Thibet and China—a most serious consideration. In these circumstances I w^ould propose to Minister for Foreign Affairs the following procedure : His Majesty’s Government agree to deletion of article 10, to be replaced by article declaring English text authoritative. As to articles 6 and 8, His Majesty’s Government would be ready to address an official note to the Russian Government stating that they will not act on the provisions of these articles until they have come to an understanding with the Russian Government. His Majesty’s Government would, if the Tripartite Convention be published, be ready to make public at the same time the above official note. Pending the conclusion of an understanding with the Russian Government on the points above mentioned, His Majesty’s Government would not require any secret engagements as proposed by Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and they would, in fact, treat the 1907 Convention as in full force and as binding on them. On the above conditions I trust that Minister for Foreign Affairs will raise no objection to His Majesty’s Government proceeding to the signature of the Tripartite Convention, as the rights of the Russian Government will be fully preserved, and no parts of the Tripartite Convention will be put into operation by His Majesty’s Government which in any way conflict with the 1907 Convention until a complete understanding has been arrived at between the two Governments. The position, in fact, is this : His Majesty’s Government would, by the^l ripartite Convention, obtain the consent of Thibet and China to seek concessions in Thibet and to send the British trade agent from Gyantse to Lhassa, but they recognise that, owing to the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907, the consent of Russia also is required foi these things, and they would undertake not to do them till that consent has been obtained.

Foreign Secret. Tibet. Please refer to your Lordship’s telegram of 20th May. Condition No. 1. McMahon lays great stress upon undesirability of deleting Clause X., in which Russia appears to have no direct interest. Although this Article is not of great intrinsic importance to us any change in initialled text would, in his opinion, open door to a renewal of discussions which C hina would welcome, and, in view of information which has reached him to-day from confidential Chinese sources, he believes that consent of China to signature of Agreement could scarcely be hoped for should such a loophole be offered. YVe share his view, and consider that any opening for further discussion of the text would lie likely to wreck Agreement. Condition No. 2. We agree to exchange of notes and proposed Russian secret note. Condition No. 3. We agree to exchange of notes and secret note, but we understand that although the designation of our Agent is to be com mercial he will not be debarred from carrying out duties as defined by Article VI11. Proposed note to Russian Government regarding Northern Afghanistan presents no serious objection, since it does not prevent Amir from giving a concession to a British subject should he wish to do so. But when published it would be liable to be misunderstood by Amir and to arouse general comment. If it is impossible to arrange that note should be secret, we trust that we may be allowed time to communicate it to Amir with suitable explanation before publication. As regards proposed note relating to Persia we consider that matter has nothing to do with Tibetan arrangement and should be treated independently and separately. I do not gather that our immediate views are desired upon the proposed note, but while deprecating any strengthening of the Russian position in Northern Persia as tending to the disruption of Persia, we could not agree to such a/change in the North without similar recognition of British interests in South.In any further communica- lion on this subject, please quote M2* No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. 1 he Under-Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for of State, transmits herewith cop ^ of the under-mentioned paper.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 162 of the 4th instant, I have the honour to enclose copy of the note, which, as reported in my telegram No. 110 of yesterday’s date I have addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Thibet. Owing to the fact that M. Sazonof is not expected to return to St. Petershurgh for another week, I thought that the best course to pursue was to submit a full statement of our case in writing, and to request the Assistant Minister for Foreign Aflairs to have it at once examined by the competent department of the Ministry so that, on his return from Livadia, M. Sazonof might he in a position to discuss the whole question with me and to give me his reply without any further delay. I therefore called on M. Neratof yesterday and, after reading the note to him, crave him at his request, a few supplementary explanations regarding the respective status of Inner and Outer Thibet, and the maps showing the area assigned to each, as well as the lines of frontier now drawn between Thibet and China and Thibet anc India. These questions, I added, had really no practical interest for Russia, nor indeed, had the commercial regulations, as Russia had no trade wRh Thibet; anc i was onlv because they desired to maintain the closest relations with the Ira P u Government that His Majesty’s Government were communicating to them all tlie results of the tripartite negotiations.

We were constantly accusing Russia of contemplating annexation, and this was resented. Our various railway schemes, on the other han&lt;h had created the impression that we were aiming at acquiring possession of the whole neutral zone. I replied that we had done nothing to warrant such a presumption, whereas, whilst I placed implicit confidence in the assurances which he had so often given me, action of Russian authorities in Azerbaijan might create situation which, if that action was persisted in, would one day inevitably lead to annexation. He then said that he had been disagreeably surprised to hear that His Majesty’s Minister, without consulting his Russian colleague, had consented to proposal of Persian Government that the gendarmerie should be placed under the Minister of War. This he could not consider a friendly act, as it was equivalent to giving the gendarmerie the character of military force, wffiereas Russian Government could never consent to its being treated as anything but a police force. 517-235]CONFIDENTIAL.

(May J9, 9 p.m.) MY telegram No. 115 Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he was prepared to submit to the Emperor proposal sanctioning Tripartite Convention provided that:— 1. Article 10 be deleted and replaced by article declaring English text authoritative. 2. Article 6. His Majesty’s Government and Russian Government to engage by an exchange of notes, to be published simultaneously with the convention, that they will not ask for concessions for their respective subjects without previous mutual understanding. Russian Government will engage, in a secret note, not to ask for concessions for Russian subjects, nor oppose any request for concessions in favour of British subjects that may be addressed to them by His Majesty’s Government. 3. Article 8. His Majesty’s Government to engage by an exchange of notes, to be published, that they will not put this article into force without previous agreement with the Imperial Government. Russian Government will engage, in a secret note, not to oppose our sending commercial agent at Gyantse to Lhassa, whenever we think it necessary. It must be clearly understood that agent must retain character of commercial, and not of a political, agent. Minister for Foreign Affairs added that, as it was necessary to have something that would bear appearance of counter-concession on our part, he must ask us to address note to the Russian Government to the following effect:— “ His Majesty’s Govermnent engage not to support any demand on the part of British subjects for irrigation works, railways, or any preferential rights for com mercial or industrial enterprises in Northern Afghanistan.” i y c , 4 ^ His Excellency said that we were virtually tearing up Thibetan Agreement of 1907 and were giving Russia nothing in ? return, and the above proposals were his last word. 5 I fear that it is impossible for me to obtain better terms, and it they are unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government the only alternative is to find some counter concession to offer to Russia outside Thibet. It is most important that I should know their decision with the least possible delay, as Minister for Foreign Affairs is leaving St. Petersburgh for several weeks next Sunday or Monday, and he cannot telegraph proposed arrangement to the Emperor until he knows whether His Majesty’s Government will accept it. If arrangement is agreed to, notes to be exchanged can be signed by Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it is no use my discussing any debatable points with him, as he will never assume responsibility for any decision. , Minister for Foreign Affairs subsequently said that he must warn me that he would have to address note asking us to recognise more fully Russia’s predominant interests in Northern Persia so that we should not in future be always bringing complaints about the doings of Russian consuls there. I said that we had always recognised Russia’s predominant interests, but that we were bound to comp am i Russian consuls acted in a manner contrary to principle of Ang o- ussian un ei standing, namely, maintenance of Persian independence and integrity. as ec whether this was a new condition that he-was submitting before consenting to om [517 - 246 :proposals about Thibet, as, if so, he had better submit terms of note to me at once. His Excellency replied in the negative, saying that it was sequence, but not part^ of new arrangement about Thibet, but that both questions were comprised in 1907 agreement. Note would be to the effect that Russian Government expect that action of British agents in Persia should conform to principle of recognition of predominance of Russian interests in the Russian zone. I said that their conduct did conform to recognition of Russia’s legitimate interests there. His Excellency replied that this was not always the case, and that our legation had recently put difficulties in the way of a concession for waterworks near Ispahan. Proposed note might be kept secret if we liked. His Excellency did not apparently insist on our returning an answer to this note.Sh' G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Mary 19, 8 a.m.) /v n Petersburgh, May 18, 1914. ' 0 'MY telegram No. 113 of 17th May. ^ ^ ^ A ' M ' ) Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day approached question in a more friendly spirit. He was, he said, in a very difficult position. He was most anxious to help us, and if only convention could be kept secret he woidd willingly give us all its substance It was a great mistake that we had ever included Thibet in the 1907 agreement, but as it formed part of that agreement there would be outcry here if he sacrificed Russia’s treaty rights without return. He contended that modifications now proposed entailed necessity for new convention between us. I disputed this, and he then said he could not in any case consent to them without consulting his colleagues and taking the Emperor’s orders. All he wanted was something to cover concession which Russia was asked to make. He repeated proposal about sending native agent to Herat, saying that nothing could be done by negotiations between the frontier authorities and that Russia’s economic interests were too important to allow of indefinite prolongation of the present situation. I told him that we had done what we could to help him, but that we were precluded by 1907 agreement from exercising our influence in Afghanistan in any but a pacific sense. We had also had troubles to put up with on this account. I begged him not to press this request, as it was one which His Majesty’s Government could not entertain. As his Excellency next proceeded to discuss draft convention, I told him that in submitting our reduced proposals you had confidently hoped that his Excellency would out of regard for friendly relations between the two Governments consent to them unconditionally. I had no authority to propose any amendment, so that he must regard anything which I might say as entirely personal suggestions. Minister for Foreign Affairs then remarked that I had said nothing in my note about article 10, which virtually gave us protectorate over Thibet. I tried, but in vain, to refute this contention. With regard to articles G and 8, he wanted to have clauses inserted which would secure to Russia, more especially as regarded latter article, rights similar to those which we were to acquire. Article 6, he said, excluded Russia entirely from acquiring concessions. I explained that we did not wish to use our veto for such a purpose, and added that we might perhaps make this clear by an exchange of notes. I reminded his Excellency that by position which Russia had acquired at Urga she virtually exercises veto over our commercial relations with Outer Mongolia. As regarded article 8, I said that his Excellency was always complaining of anti-Russian sentiments of Anglo-Indian officials. Such feelings, if they still existed, owed their origin to intrigues of Russian agents in the past, which had been one of the direct causes of the troubles which led to our intervention in 1903. Russia had no interests in Ihibet, and if she now insisted on right of sending agent to Lhassa her motives might be misinterpreted in India and suspicions which it was so important to allay might be revived. It would, I added, be very difficult for us in any case to insert clauses affecting Russia’s rights in the convention. . I then said that if he would consent to articles 6 and 8 I would suggest that article 10 should be replaced by an article declaring English text of convention authoritative. Minister for Foreign Affairs at once said that such a substitution would be very agreeable to him. . . , After some discussion, he made suggestion that if Russia s right to send an agent to Lhassa were inserted in article 8 he would give us seciet assurance that he vould never send one there. I told him that we might have difficulties in getting China and ,nl7 - 2361o Thibet to consent to this, and that I could not recommend it. Finally, he said that he might consent to leave article 8 as it stood were we to undertake, by an exchange of notes which could be published, not to put this article into force without a previous^^ agreement with Russia. He might then give us a secret assurance that he would^* not withhold his consent from visits of our agent to Lhassa when the time came for his giving it. As regarded article 6, he was inclined to favour an exchange of notes to the effect that the two Powers signatories of 1907 agreement engaged not to ask for concessions for their respective subjects without a previous mutual understanding. He seemed ' also almost prepared to give us a secret assurance that he would not support, or at all events encourage, requests for such concessions by Russian subjects, and that he would not oppose those which we might put forward. In conclusion he said he must think over these various suggestions before definitely committing himself. I also repeated that I could not answer in the least for the view which His Majesty’s Government would take of them, and that I had been speaking without instructions. I am to see him again to-morrow.i517 - 2151 X 9 CONFIDENTIAL. ■a Q 1 J 19 7 j ^ &gt; Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey—(Received May 17, 10'30 p.m.) St. Petersburgh, May 17, 1914. (No. Ho.) (May 17, 5'4 p.m.^ MY despatch No. 11 4. J ’ Minister for b oreigiTTtlfairs returned yesterday morning, and I saw him in the afternoon. He had not had time to study all the papers, but contended that our proposals constituted the abrogation of the Thibetan Agreement and established British protectorate. He based this contention mainly on articles 8 and 10, laying special stress on the latter. He said that he personally did not care what we did with Thibet, but that, if he did not obtain a quid yro quo that would satisfy public opinion, he would be accused more especially by his Nationalist colleagues of being the dupe of England, just as he had been accused of having been duped by Germany at Potsdam. After repeating what I had said to Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, I remarked that there might perhaps have been grounds for such a contention had we put forward the proposals originally contemplated, but that to argue that articles 8 and 10 gave us protectorate was absurd. Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that article 10 made us the arbiter of Thibet’s destinies, and that, as regarded article 8, Russia was entitled to claim similar right, though she would not use it. I explained that, as we had always acted as mediator between China and Thibet, the role of arbitrator naturally devolved on us, and that we had special interests to safeguard, which Russia had not, so that she had not the same reason that we had for sending a commercial agent to Lhassa. I told him later on that, if he had such strong objections to article 10, we might find another formula to meet his wishes. I thought it better, however, not to put forward your alternative proposal at this stage of the discussion. Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that Russia had economic interests of a far more important kind in Afghanistan than we had in Thibet, and that if he consented to our proposals we must allow her to send agents into Afghanistan, though not to Cabul, to discuss with the authorities questions which concerned her closely, such as irrigation, &amp;c. He had repeatedly appealed to our good offices in the hope of getting these questions settled, but without success. 1 replied that His Majesty’s Government could not possibly enteitain such a proposal. What we were asking for in Thibet did not justify a demand that would entail prolonged negotiations and indefinitely postpone signature of comention. His Excellency thereupon complained that we had kept back our proposals to the last minute. He had been waiting for weeks for me to submit them, and now I expected him to answer me within twenty-four hours. I again explame reasons or delay and for necessity of prompt answer. He replied that, if we objected to counter- concessions in Afghanistan, we must suggest others. I replied that none 'were warranted by the circumstances. 4 ieie ^ere no u eiior motives behind our proposals, nor was it, as his Excellency had sugges e , ie m i oi uc ion of the thin edge of the wedge. The measures we were taking were the direct consequence of the change effected in the situation by Russia s action m i ongo m. ia evei e might say, Russia had established a protectorate there. She coni rolled the a ministra tion, and without her consent Mongolia could not conclude treaties ^ i i oreign conn nes nor even accord us commercial [? privilege] we were entitle to j our ^ • The first consequence had been treaty by which Ihibet an - ®ng ^ between other support, liberty of trade, &amp;c. The closest relations had them, and Russian rifles were being imported into Ihi )e ^ in Thfbet mmht Excellency must remember our peculiar position, and how troubles m h e g t2 involve Nepal, &amp;c., and consequently compel us to send an expedition. His Excellency said that he would not in the least object to our doing so. I replied that perhaps he might not, but that we should. Minister for Foreign Affairs then said he would consent to all our proposals if we would keep the convention secret. He next suggested that we should not mention them in the convention, and that Russia would give us a secret understanding to raise no objections when the occasion arose. He subsequently qualified this by saying that we could give a similar undertaking, allowing Russia to send occasionally a native agent to Herat. I told him that I was greatly disappointed by his unconciliatory attitude. In my anxiety to smooth over difficulties I had more than once supported Russia’s views when I considered them well founded, but I could not do so in the present case. It would have been a natural and friendly act for him to consent to such slight modifica tions as we had suggested in the 1907 agreement, but he had preferred to make them a matter of hard bargaining. He apparently attached more importance to the letter than to the spirit of that agreement, though it did not, I believe, confer on Russia the right to keep some 12,000 troops in North Persia or gradually convert Azerbaijan into a Russian possession by a process of land-purchase. His Excellency contended that Russia had only about 6,000 troops there and that she did not interfere with the central administration. I replied that indefinite military occupation violated the principle of Persian integrity, which was the basis of our understanding, while any slight modifications which we wished introduced into it were met by counter proposals that would cause us the greatest embarrassment. I finally urged him to reconsider his attitude, and he said he would discuss the question again with me to-morrow. Minister foi Foreign Affairs is evidently so afraid of the criticisms of his colleagues that he wants to save his face by getting something which he can represent as a counter-concession. lam not aware whether there is anything which we can otter that will convey the impression desired without costing us too much. In the u °m 0Ur raa 1 kln ^ s ? me counter-concession, it might be well to consider whether it should not be made conditional on our being allowed to have a resident representative at Lhassa, as his Excellency seems to draw no distinction between our maximum and minimum demands. ortiol'J 6 ?? n , get °y r i 1 * 8 objections to article 10 by substituting proposed alternative artide.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has to wait at Livadia for the Turkish Mission and is not expected back till the end of next week. I therefore thought it best to state our case fully in a note embodying those/ — . , portions of your despatch No. 162 that have reference to the two points which concern Russia and to divide Thibet into two zones, and explaining the reasons which render slight modifications of the Kiukiagg arrangements imperative as well as the necessity 7^*-^ for a prompt reply. I read it to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day, and begged him to have it at once examined by competent department, so that Minister for Foreign Affairs may be in a position to give me an answer as soon as he returns. I explained that the document which I had given him about the Indo-Thibetan frontier, the two Thibetan zones, and the Trade Regulations had no practical interest for Russia^, but that the friendly relations existing between the two Governments maae us amxious to keep them informed of all that had taken place during the tripartite negotiations. I further said that, when I had first broached the subject to M. Sazonof, his Excellency had been under the impression that we were going to put forward far- reaching demands with regard to Thibet, and had told me that he would have to ask for counter-concessions. We had in consequence reduced our demands to a minimum which would render j^iii^request for counter-concessions unnecessary, and I had therefore every confidence that the Imperial Government would give an unconditional consent to our proposals, which in no way affected any Russian interest. His Excellency replied that he could say nothing until the Minister for Foreign Affairs returned, except that he could assure me that he would do everything to expedite answer and that our proposals would be examined in the most friendly spirit. isr''* 9 MAYISU -, &amp; [517—111]In any further communication on this subject, please quote *0- 19135/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. r jx\ Foreign Office May 2nd, 1914.

[May 4.] Section 1, Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (No. 162.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 4, 1914. WITH reference to my despatch No. 197, Confidential, of the 23rd May, 1913, relative to the conference in India between representatives of His Majesty’s, the Chinese, and the Thibetan Governments, with a view to a settlement of the Thibetan question, I have to inform your Excellency that the negotiations have now reached a stage at which it has become necessary for His Majesty’s Government to acquaint the Russian Government with what has passed, in accordance with the undertaking given to them by your Excellency on the 27th May, 1913, and to lay before them the draft of the convention which was initialled by the plenipotentiaries of the three Governments. I should be glad, therefore, if your Excellency would communicate to M. Sazonof a copy of the enclosed draft convention, together with its accompanying maps, and also copies of the Trade Regulations and of an Indo-Thibet Boundary Agreement which have been separately negotiated and initialled by the British and Thibetan plenipotentiaries. * In communicating these agreements to M. Sazonof, your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Government have hitherto refrained from acquainting the Russian Government with the earlier stages of the negotiations as, owing to the attitude adopted by both the Chinese and Thibetan plenipotentiaries, it appeared useless to do so until it was seen what arrangement would be accepted by both of them. With regard to the convention itself, your Excellency should inform M. Sazonof that His Majesty’s Government have endeavoured throughout to come to an arrangement which, while interfering as little as possible with existing agreements (and above all with the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907), should at the same time, by offering a reasonable compromise between the extravagant claims put forward by the Chinese and Thibetan Governments, provide adequate guarantees of a permanent settlement. It appears to me, subject to your Excellency’s opinion, that in presenting the convention it would be well only to offer comments on the following two points, which alone directly affect the engagements towards Russia entered into by His Majesty’s Government in 1907 :— 1. The decision with respect to industrial and financial concessions in article 6. 2. The arrangement for the British trade agent to pay occasional visits to Lhassa in article 8, and to add an explanation of the reasons which have led to the adoption of a division of Thibet into spheres or zones (article 9). In the same way it might be well to reserve any explanation of other points until it becomes necessary to reply to any criticisms or objections which may be made by the Russian Government. With regard to point (1), your Excellency should inform M. Sazonof that, as the Russian Government are aware, the question of financial and industrial concessions is at present regulated by article 3 of the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906, and as regards Great Britain and Russia by the self-denying undertakings embodied in article 4 of the Anglo-Bussian Convention of 1907. These articles confer a monopoly of such concessions upon China, a monopoly which has hitherto been little, if at all, exercised. It has become obvious, however, that the Thibetan Government will not rest contented with the practical sterilisation which the present system enforces upon their country, and that they intend in the near future to embark upon a development of its natural resources. * 1. Tripartite Agreement; 2. Indo-Thibetan Boundary Agreement; maps accompanying 1 and 2. [2142 d—1] 3. Trade Regulations; 9 MAY 19142 They are also naturally unwilling, after the events of the last three years, to he dependent upon China alone for the assistance necessary in carrying out any projects of development, while it would be obviousty undesirable in the interests of their newly acquired autonomy that they should do so, even if it were probable that sufficient assistance of a suitable nature could be supplied from Chinese sources. In order to meet this difficulty article 6 has been inserted in the new conventioi^\^ * by which article 3 of the Anglo-Chinese Convention has been cancelled, thus depriving China of her monopoly, and at the same time a provision has been added declaring that China is not included in the term “ foreign Power,” as used in article 9 (d) of the Anglo-Thibetan Convention of 1904-, thus permitting her to benefit by any concessions which the Thibetan Government may choose to give to Chinese subjects. His Majesty’s Government also propose that article 4 of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 should be cancelled, as, with the abolition of article 3 of the Anglo-Chinese Convention and the consequent revival of article 9 (d) of the Anglo- Thibetan Convention, the self-denying undertakings contained in the above-mentioned article 4 would leave Great Britain and Russia at a disadvantage with other Powers in respect of concessions in Thibet. His Majesty’s Government are aware that if this proposal is carried into effect they would still, under the Anglo-Thibetan Convention of 1904, possess a veto over concessions granted to the subjects of any Power except China, but, as it is not their intention, nor would it be practicable, to use this veto to sterilise Thibet, they trust that the Russian Government will not raise objections to the cancellation of article 4 of the Anglo-Russian Convention, which appears to them to be a necessary step in the removal of conditions which might prove, in the future, to be a cause of serious difficulty and a grave detriment to the steady and peaceful development of the Government, industry, and commerce of Thibet, which they, in common with the Russian Government, believe to offer the only hope of a permanent and satisfactory settlement of the Thibetan question. \\ ith regard to the second point, your Excellency should explain that the British trade agent at Gyantse will only visit Lhassa when absolutely necessary, and that permission for him to do so is only sought on grounds of convenience, as it has been tound in practice that the right of direct communication on commercial matters with the Thibetan authorities given to His Majesty’s Government bj- article 2 of the Anglo-Russian Convention can only be carried out successfully if matters are from time to time discussed in person with higher officials than those at Gyantse. His Excellency will no doubt recollect that it was this very difficulty of communication which was one of the principal causes of the events which necessitated the British expedition to Lhassa in 1904. \\ ith regard to the division of Thibet into two spheres, with different systems and degrees ol Chinese and Thibetan control respectively, your Excellency should explain that after a careful consideration of the statements of the boundaries and territories claimed by the Chinese and Thibetan Governments respectively, and a comparison with the evidence in their own possession, His Majesty’s Government came to the conclusion that the only hope of reconciling the wholly divergent and exaggerated pretensions of the two parties lay in adopting the proposal now embodied in articles 2 and 9 and in the third and fourth notes attached to the convention, but they were satisfied that the Thibetans have established their claim to full autonomy in the territory described as the outer zone. It further seems possible that the Russian Government may offer criticisms or objections on the following three points :— 1. Article 10 of the convention. 2. The Indo-Thibetan Boundary Agreement. 3. The Trade Regulations. / If they do so your Excellency should explain, with regard to the first point, that past experience has shown that some dispute as to the exact meaning of the terms of any arrangement of this nature is always possible, and that it is consequently desirable that some arbitrator should be named in the convention itself to determine such disputes, and that it seemed most convenient that His Majesty’s Government, who have throughout acted as mediators in this matter between the extreme views held by the Chinese and Thibetan Governments, should undertake this task if it becomes necessary.raise verv ftln ow ® yer &gt; for y our Excellency s information, that, should M.

It, however, the Russian Government raise any objection to them, your Excellency can explain that the new regulations are merely a necessary adjustment of the Regulations of 1908, which they were empowered to negotiate with the Thibetan government by article 2 of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, to the altered circumstances occasioned by the new Tripartite Convention. c!^ n c “ nic ^ n g ^ ie convention and the accompanying documents to ^.1. Sazonof, youi Excellency should point out to him that, as he will readily perceive, the events of the last few years have so radically altered the circumstances and so profoundly modified the relations between the various parties concerned that certain changes have become inevitable, if the ultimate goal of both British and Russian policy is to be attained and a peaceful and prosperous future secured to Thibet. rtuy therefore hope that the Russian Government will approach these proposals, which they believe to contain the minimum disturbance of existing arrangements which is possible in the circumstances if a permanent settlement is to be obtained, with the same consideration, and in the same amicable spirit, which have characterised the mutual relations of the two Governments on this question during the past eight years. In conclusion, I must inform your Excellency that it is of the greatest importance that the assent of the Russian Government to these proposals should be received as soon as possible, as it will be necessary that the Chinese and Thibetan delegates should remain in India until signature can take place, and, apart from the injury to his health which is feared by the Thibetan plenipotentiary as a result of a prolonged sojourn in India during the hot weather, it is most desirable to avoid a long delay between initialling and signature which will enable the Chinese Government to raise objections and difficulties which may prove fatal to the successful conclusion of these lengthy negotiations. You should therefore use every endeavour to obtain a prompt reply to this communication, and may, if you see fit, explain to M. Sazonof the practical difficulties which will arise in the event of any considerable delay in proceeding to signature. I desire, however, to leave to your Excellency full discretion as to the best means of securing the acceptance of these proposals. I am, &amp;c. E.

This correspondence documents Buchanan's efforts to secure not only the assent of the Russian Government to proposals made in the draft convention, but also certain revisions to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, including the abrogation of the self-denying engagements taken by the two governments in relation to Thibet, as recorded in article 4 of the Convention.Part 1 of the volume also contains correspondence between the Government of India, the India Office, and the Foreign Office, which discusses Russia's terms for agreeing to the Tripartite Convention (one of which being the deletion of article 10, on the grounds that, in the opinion of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, it would make Britain 'the arbiter of Thibet's destinies').Other matters discussed in the correspondence include the following:the drafting of a joint declaration, described as a potential pendant to the Tripartite Convention, whereby Russia would reaffirm its adherence to the principle that Afghanistan is outside the sphere of Russian political influence and Britain would agree not to support 'any applications by British subjects for irrigation works, railways, or preferential rights for commercial or industrial enterprises in Northern Afghanistan';the Chinese Government's refusal to sign the Tripartite Convention;the British Government's response to the Bolshevik Party's publication in November 1917 of secret diplomatic documents, some of which reveal the secret negotiations between Britain and Russia regarding Northern Afghanistan.The principal correspondents are the following: the Ambassador to St Petersburgh [Saint Petersburg] (Sir George William Buchanan); the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey, succeeded by Arthur James Balfour); officials of the Foreign Office; the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, India Office (Thomas William Holderness); the Secretary of State for India [Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, succeeded by Joseph Austen Chamberlain]; the Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge, succeeded by Frederic John Napier Thesiger]; the Secretary to the India Office's Political and Secret Department (Sir Frederic Arthur Hirtzel, succeeded by John Evelyn Shuckburgh); the Press Bureau.In addition to correspondence, part 1 includes a copy of the proposed Tripartite Convention, dated 27 April 1914. The French material in this part of the volume consists of several items of diplomatic correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Home Office, Official Press Bureau</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100034285662.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
