MILITARY REPORT (Area No. 13). (Compiled by Air Headquarters, Iraq.) SIMLA GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PRESS 1924MILITARY REPORT ON ’ARABISTAN. CHAPTER I. History. 4 The province of ’Arabistan, which forms a part of what was once the great Elamite empire, has played such an important role in the history of the world that it would be idle to attempt to relate the whole in the space available in this report. In order, therefore, to give a condensed account of the history of ’Arabistan from the earliest days, the dates and more important events, as recorded by Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.B., C.M.G., in his history of Persia, are detailed below in chronological order. Elam, or Elamtu, the classical Elymais, which signifies 4 mountains ’ was so named because the Assvrians first came into contact with its mountain sections,—its plains as will be shown later being far less extensive than they are to-day—and included the modem provinces of ’Arabistan, Luristan, Pusht-i Kuh and Bakhtiari countries. To ’Arabistan, however, lies the greatest claim to fame with its capital Susa, the modern Shush, situated 68 miles N. of Ahwaz and 22 miles below Dizful. Persia is not renowned for its rivers, but the two great rivers, the Karun and Karkhah, which exist to-day, were the makers of Elam ; and it was in the valleys of these rivers that the earliest civilization of Persia was found and the kingdom of Elam estab lished. As regards the exact position of the sea coast in very early days w r e are indebted to Nearchus, admiral of Alexander the Great, who in 325 B.C. conducted a fleet of river built ships from Karachi across the Arabian sea up the Persian Gulf to Susa. The accurate observations of Nearchus give two important factors ;— 1. That the bridge of boats leading from Persepolis to Susa is reached 150 stadia or 17 miles from the mouth of the Karim. MC164CGS2 2. That this point was 600 stadia or 68 miles from Susa, which is the exact distance from Susa to the modern Ahwaz. The bridge of boats can therefore be placed at Ahwaz, where the famous natural barraga-facilitates a crossing and which lies on the direct Susa-Behbehan-Persepolis route, while 17 miles downstream of Ahwaz lies Kut-al ’Umairah, wdiich in the 4th century B.C. was situated at the mouth of the Karun river. During the course of history ’Arabistan has been known by different names. In its earliest days when the eyes of the whole world were turned towards its capital Susa the province was called Susiana then distinguishing it from the hill country of Elam. Under the Persians the province was known as Puvaja and finally in mediaeval days the name Khuzistan was given to it, or possibly at first Huzistan from the word Huz, common in Southern 'Arabistan in the sense of a cultivated area or estate. It is also believed that Ahwaz, the singular of Huz, was so named for the same reason. The name, ’Arabistan, by which it is now known, explains itself. It must not, however, be forgotten that before Susa came into prominence the province was not known by any distinct name of its own, but merely formed part of the Elamite empire. Of its people of ancient times Dieulafoy and de Morgan both agree that that the Susian plain was once occupied b}^ Negritis, who, so far as is known, were the original inhabitants. These people never occupied the hill districts of Elam. Amongst its most important districts was Anzan or Anshan which probably in course of time included Susa and the neigh bouring hills. ’Anshan is especially celebrated as being the princi pality of Cyrus the Great. The earliest known language in Elam is Anzanite, sometimes described as Turanian, the Turanians, who were descendants of Shem, being recorded as some of its earliest inhabitants. Of the Elamite religion very little is known, though the chief deity, whose name was secret and sacred and who was referred to as ‘ Shushinak ’ or the c Susian ’, dwelt in a forest sanctuary, to which only the priests and King were admitted. It is how ever related that, as in Babylonia, the priesthood was both powerful and wealthy, but little is known of the religion and* ritual of Elam owing to the lack of trustworthy arch ecological evidence* As regards the capital itself an account is given in Chapter II, but it might not be amiss to point out here that Susa may claim to be the oldest known site in the world, and de Morgan claims that fragments of pottery found at Susa date back to 8000 B.O., though this reckoning is regarded by King as unsafe. The following table gives the dates of the principal events in Ancien the history of the province now known as ’Arabistan :— 2900-2800. ^ ^ B C Manishtu, one of the warrior kings of Kish, conducted a cam paign against Anshan and records his success ; the people were subdued and forced to pay tribute. Again, on a vase found at Nippur, an inscription states that the vase was booty from Elam, and was dedicated by another warrior king, Urumush, cv when he had conquered Elam.” In 2800 B.C. Sargon of the Empire of Akkad conquered Elam devastating the country and destroying its crops, but there is no proof that the country was annexed by Akkad. The Gutian invasion, however, at the close of the Akkad dynasty led to the subjugation of both North and South Babylonia, and there is little doubt that Elam acknowledged the suzerainty of these invaders. Elam for the first time comes under the permanent adminis- 2450 . tration of Sumer, and Susa was in all probability the local capital of Dungi, the second monarch of the dynasty of Ur who rebuilt the temple of Shushinak, the national god. The fall of the dynasty of Ur however was shortly after caused by an Elamite invasion, of which few details are known, but it is reasonable to suppose that Elam recovered its liberty and finally turned on its oppressor. Connected with the downfall of Ur is the sack of Erech by 2280 . an Eiamite king. The dynasty of Nisin, which reigned for about 225 y ears after 2329-2115. the downfall of the House of Ur. The empire probably included both Sumer and Akkad and possibly Elam, though the Elamite King of Larsa overthrew the dynasty of Nisin in 2115. From this date Sumerian power and prestige, which were already shaken, never recovered. About this time the Elamite empire began to decay. As Sir Percy Sykes says, ' Elam, although an indpendent and mighty4 ♦ B. C. 2225-1926. 1925-1185. 1190. kingdom, never seriously aspired to the empire of the known world, as did her rivals, for it appears that, albeit formidable in war, she lacked the capacity to administer her conquests, and that each country was allowed to retain its organisation and ancient rulers, subject to the payment of a heavy tribute. The whole period is still very obscure, but so far as can be gathered, first of all Syria was lost, and gradually, one by one, the neigh bouring states recovered their liberty. Then the dynasty of Nisin, in its turn, conquered Elam.’ The first dynasty of Babylon. The greatest monarch of this dynasty was Hammurabi, the law giver and conqueror, who reigned from 2123-2081 B.C. The most important military event of his reign w^as the defeat of Rimsin, the Elamite king of Larsa, and the capture of his city in 2093 B.C. / During this time little can be gleaned of the internal condi tion of Elam, but there are traces of an independent kingdom with a predominant Anzanite element. Chief of these sovereigns are Khumban-Niimena and his son, the former working for the consolidation of Elam and the latter for the re-organization of the country and the repair of its ruined sanctuaries. The Kassite Dynasty. During the rule of the Kassite dynasty Assyria appeared as a rising power in the middle reaches of the Tigris. During this period little is known of Elam, but towards the end of the dynasty war was waged by Khurbatila, King of Elam, against Kurigalzu, King of Babylon. The former, who was invading Babylonia, was defeated and taken prisoner. Susa, too, was apparently captured. Some generations later Elam, under Kidin-Khutrutash, devastated and conquered Babylonia and carried away many of its inhabitants. Among the famous warrior kings of this period of Elam wsl&amp; Shutruk-Nakhunta, who not only conquered Babylonia, but removed to Susa the choicest works of art from the cities he laid w r aste. At this time when the Kassite power w T aned Elam possessed the greatest influence, and the dynasty at its close acknowledged the overlordship of Elam. Shutruk-Nakhunta w-as succeeded by Shilkhak-in-Shushinak, a great administrator and builder. This was the golden age in art and literature of Elam.■■■ The Pashe Dynasty. During this dynasty, so called after one B. c. of the quarters of Babylon, a victory was gained over the Elamites by Nebuchadnezzar I, though it is probable that during the whole period Elam was the overlord. The Sea-Land and Bazi Dynasties. During these two decades 1052-1032. Elam enaeayoured to take advantage of the unsettled state of Babylonia, out she affected no permanent control over the country and only managed to place one ruler on the throne The Ghaldaeans. Babylon, spoiled by Elam and coveted by 970-732 Assyria, was now overrun by the Chaldaeans of Semitic origin, whose appearance marks the beginning of a new epoch. During this period Assyria was rapidly regaininsr the upper 900-745 hand and between 747 and 732 B.C. Babylon was falling under '47-732: the domination of the new Assyrian empire. Lnder Sargon II Assyria for the first time met Elam in 722-705. pitched battle. An alliance was made between Elam and Babylon, but Sargon attacked before the two powers had time to meet. The Elamites however proved a formidable foe and in the first engagement at Durilu the Assyrians were compelled to retiie and the battle constituted a defeat, though not a crush ing one, for the Assyrian army. The succcessor of Sargon was Sennacherib, his0 35. C» 674, 670, 669- 665, 659 ? 653s 674 B. C. Khumdan-Khaldash II of Elam suddenly raided Babylonia, pushing forward as far as Sippar, while the Assyrians were engaged elsewhere, and returned in triumph to Susa, where he died^a few days later. Urtaku, his brother, who succeeded to the throne, restored the gods which had been carried off from Sippar and in return received aid from Esarhaddon when Elam was suffering from famine. The conquest of Egypt by Esarhaddon. The power of Assyria culminated after this campaign, which brought the whole of the civilised world except Elam under its sway ; and the fall of Elam was soon to follow. Upon the death of Esarhaddon, Assurbanipal succeeded to the empire and his brother Shamashshum-ukin to the kingdom of Babylon. In 665 B. C. whilst the Assyrians were still taken up with the suppression of the Egyptian revolt, the Elamites under Urtaku crossed the Tigris and devastated the land far and wide. Babylon was too strong to be captured and so the Elamites following their usual practice returned to Susa laden with booty. Urtaku, however, and other leaders of Elam died at this time and left Elam a prey to anarchy. Urtaku was succeeded by his brother Teumman, whose attempts to murder his nephews caused sixty royal princes, with a considerable following, to flee to the court of Assurbanipal. There they were received with honour, as it was hoped thus to weaken Elam by means of civil war. The policy was successful, for these family feuds were the ultimate cause of the downfall of Elam. The battle of Tulliz. A decisive victory for the Assyrians over the Elamites at Tulliz, a place near Susa. Teumman was killed and his head cut off and sent to Nineveh. The news of the d'saster brought about a revolution in Susa. The delight of Assurbanipal, the Assyrian commander, was unbounded, for, though Elam had never beaten Assy ia in any campaign, it had defied Esarhaddon, had repeatedly ravaged Babylonia and was the only power which had hitherto remained free and a standing menace to Assyria. But in spite of its success the Assyrian army did not press on and capture Susa. The second campaign against Elam. Assyria again reaped the benefits of internal dissensions in the Elamite royal family. Tammaritu, the leader of the Elam forces, was compelled to flee through internal rebellion, was made prisoner ard sent to7 Nineveh, where he was treated kindly by the Assyrians and as a b. c result withdrew his forces from the field. The capture of Babylon by Assurbanipal, and the third 648 . ; campaign against Elam. In this campaign Tammaritu, aided by the Assyrians, re-entered Susa and was proclaimed king. He foolishly attempted to massacre his allies but, the plot being discovered, he was thrown into prison. The Assyrians, however, not feeling strong enough to maintain their position unsup ported, retired to Nineveh, laying the whole country waste. Capture and sack of Susa. On this occasion the Assyrian 645. army completely pillaged the city, violated the sanctuaries and massacred her people. In the words of Ezekiel, as quoted by Sir Percy Sykes, There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword Elam, as a Kingdom had disappeared. Elam in her earliest da}^s was a predatory power, and so she remained throughout. At the same time, writes Sir Percy Sykes, she developed, her own system oi writing, her own art and to a certain extent her own civilization. But she raided rather than subdued, and made little serious attempt at empire ; and when she tried to organise her empire, she signally failed. Brought face to face with Assyria, when the intervening buffer states ha-d been subdued, Elam fought heroically against superior organisation, forces and equipment. Even so, thanks to her inaccessibility and valour, she might well have survived Assyria but for her civil dissensions, which again and again paralysed her arms at the most critical juncture. From this date Elam plays a very small part in the history of gqq. Persia. About 600 B. C. Teispes, the son of Achaemenes, the founder of t oe Persian monarchy, taking advantage of the de fenceless position of Elam, occupied the district of Anshan and rxssumed the title of ‘‘Great King, King of Anshan”. From himstarted the double line of Achaemenian monarchs, the Anshan and Persian, but in 546 B. C. Cyrus I, who three years previous 54 ^ had been termed King of Anshan, was referred to as King of Persia, Elam and Persia thus being moulded in to one country under the rule of the King of Persia. On the accession of Darius we again hear of the revolt of 52 i. Elam, but its rebel leader, Atrina, was not supported and being taken prisoner was sent to Darius, who slew him w ith his own .*****%B. 0. 518 . 485 - 466 . 331. 316. 245. A. D. 226. 8 hand. A second pretender, Martiya, rose in Elam but Darius had already shown his power in the empire and rebellions ceased. On peace being established throughout the empire Darius divided the country into a number of satrapies, of which Elam (Susiana), now for the first time called Uvaja, was one. Another act of Darius, which touches on this province w as the construc tion of the Royal Road from Susa to Sardes, a distance of about 1500 miles. In 485 E. C. Darius died and was succeeded by Xerxes, whose only connection with Uvaja was that he went from Sardes to Susa, where he was lost to view for several years. The next reference of any importance to the province of Uvaja is the capture of Susa by Alexander immediately after the battle of Arbela, in which he gained such a decisive victory. At Susa he celebrated his triumph with great splendour, and then marched against Persepolis crossing the Karun at Ahwaz. It was at Susa again six years later after his conquests in Persia and India that Alexander celebrated the termination of the greatest expedition recorded in history with rejoicings and weddings between the noblest Macedonians and Persians. In 323 Alexander the Great died. Susa once again becomes the object of an expedition, and in 316 falls to the combined forces of Antigonus of Phrygia and Seleucus, formerly a favourite of Alexander and the founder of the Seleucid dynasty. Susa was pillaged and all its treasures taken to Babylon by Antigonus, but not without great loss to his forces, which were attacked as they were attempting to cross the Karun by Eumenes, the late King’s secretarv. The third Syrian v/ar. From an inscribed stone it is learnt that Ptolemy III at this date subjugated Mesopotamia, Susiana, Persia, Media and all the districts as far as Bactria. But this was rather a raid than a conquest, since affairs in Egypt compelled Ptolemy to return there. No more is heard of Susiana until the downfall of the Parthian Empire in 226 A.I)., when Artaxerxes, known as Ardeshir, the Vassal King of Persia, rebelled and utterly defeated^Vrtabanus on the plain of Hormuz, some thirty miles east of Ahwaz. This battle is recorded as the decisive battle, which caused the down fall of the Parthian Empire.

The dates of the few events which have given cause m the past few centuries or ■Zhton to be mentioned in Persian history, are tabulated below. • The Turkish Invasion. During these three years Turkey annexed the western provinces of Persia, including muc o Luristan and Khuzistan. For a long time previous to this date ’Arahistan, which had held a semi independent position, was a subject of dispute Seen Teheran and Constantinople, as to whether the southern movince should or should not form part of the dominions of the Shah. Persian influence had usually been predomman , hut the nonulation had become almost entirely Arab. To wards the 1 end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17 th century, theArab element was further strengthened by the immigration of the great tribe of the Cha’b, who were originally subject to attoman rule As between Turkish and Persian domination the Cha’b had no preference, for both were equally distasteful to them but wheii they spread eastwards they found themse ves oblSed to yield tribute to the Shah. Nominally subject to PeLia, they were virtually independent and they appear now as the allies of Persia, now as the allies oi lurkey. British relations with the tribes and shaikhs of ’Arabistan go back over 250 years to the time when, in 1765, the Agents of the Honourable East India Company attempted naval operations aSinst the pirates of the Cha’b. These efforts met with little success Thev were repeated in June 1766 on a large scale, but again failed to he altogether satisfactory. Our attack on the fort ot Mansur, in the Khor Buzieh, 36 miles east ox Muham- marah was repulsed, our losses including one British officer Sid one European gunner killed and four men wounded. In August, however, we succeeded in capturing and 6nrmng several boats. In alliance with the Turks the fort of Qubban was next attacked, but disastrously; the Turks railed to suppor, the Company’s troops and 3 officers, a European sergeant and 13 men were killed and 32 wounded. We also lost a field piece and 32 chests of ammunition.11 Bor tlie next hundred years we confined our action on the A. D. bhafct-al- Arab and in its vicinity to naval precautions, such as patrolling to prevent piracy. From 1776 to 1779 Basrah was under Persian rule but this 1776-79. brief inter-regnum left little or no mark on ’Arabistan or its people. ginning of the 19th century a rival to the Cha’b in igoo approx. ,, e * uhaisin appeared.

Article 8. —Suppression of brigandage on the frontiers. The treaty of Erzerum was signed on 31st May 1847 for the settlement of the Turkish-Persian boundary. Subsequent meetings of the Commission were held in 1849, 1850 and 1851 at Baghdad and Muhammarah. This boundary has remained unsettled down to the present time, and disputes frequently arose between the Turkish and Persian Governments regarding their respective claims, but not actually on that part of the frontier resting between ’Arabistan and ’Iraq. In 1856 the British declared war against Persia, which cul minated in the fighting at Borasjun, the capture of Muhammarah and a subsequent expedition to Ahwaz. Major General Sir James Outram K.C.B. was placed in command of the force. After the Persians had been defeated at Borasjun the British troops re-embarked and the fleet arrived at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab on the 8th March, The village of Ma’amir, (Qasbat-al-Aassar) was occupied by the enemy, but no acts of hostility were committed on either side. On the 23rd March the fleet moved up the river to a point 3 miles below the mouth of the Karim. The troops were now transhipped together with the guns and horses into small steamers and vessels of lighter draft, the enemy making no attempt to interfere. At nightfall on the 25th some engineer officers, after reconnoitering in a small boat to within 300 yards of the enemies’ forts, established a mortar battery on a raft behind the low swampy island, which lies in midstream opposite Muhammarah, and was to be known henceforward by Arabs, from this circumstance, as Umm- al- Rassas—Mother of lead or bullets. At daybreak on the 26th the mortars from this raft opened fire with deadly effect. At the first shot our fleet consisting of 7 vessels, of which two were sloops, weighed anchor, and steaming up river, poured shell on the enemy’s batteries, which were situated one on each side of the mouth of the Karun. The sloops passed unhurt within one hundred yards of the battery and the transport ships, whose decks were crowded with men, similarly passed unscathed. The Persians stood to their guns for about 3 hours, after which their pownr slackened. Troops were then landed just beyond the western battery (he., above the Customs, at Hauz-al-Malakeh) and v r ere only feebly opposed. The Persian army fled precipitately,4 13 leaving their tents standing, whilst arms, ammunition, accoutre- A - D « ments and food lay about in profusion. Not less than 300 of their number were killed, and in addition large numbers were killed by Arabs. ^ The Persian General was the Governor-General of ' Arabistan, Thtisam-ud-Daulah, uncle of the Shah, and his troops seem to have been all Persians ; the Arabs gave a friendly reception to the British. On the 29th March two steamers, each towing a second vessel, left Muhammarah for Ahwaz. Sabeh was passed the follow ing afternoon and Ismai’lieh reached by nightfall. The follow ing evening Tvut-al-’Amaireh was reached, and on the 1st April* the force ay rived at Ahwaz. The enemy was found in strength on the right bank, only a small force of 500 men being in the town as a guard for stores, the capture of which was the object of the expedition. Troops were landed and the town was captured without resistance, the Shaikh having surr ndered, and the Per sian garrison and the mam body having fled. On the 6th April expedition returned to Muhammarah. Peace with Persia had been concluded at Paris on the 4th March previously. On the 15th May the expedition left Muham rnarah for India, the town having been handed over on the pre vious day to Shaikh Jabir. 4 During this period the position changed but little. British 1856-1890. enterprise had not penetrated into the interior of Persia or ’Arabistan. Shaikh Jabir was succeeded by his son, Miza’l, who was less 1881. well disposed to us. In this year a British consulate was established at Muham- 1890. max ah, simultaneous with the opening of the Karun to foreign shipping and the advent of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Thence- forwaid the affairs of ’Arabistan began to assume more than academic importance to British diplomatic and political autho rities. Shaikh Miza 1 was assassinated and his brother appointed his 1897 , successor. At the same time Khazan became by tribal elec- tiontheShmkh of the Muhaisin and, by direct appointment by me Shah, Persian Governor of Southern ’Arabistan, a position, which he still holds, j MC164CGS14 A. D. 1898 , 1903 . The Cha’b Shaikhdom was now broken up and finally extin guished in 1898, and the Muhaisin inherited the Cha’b possessions from the Karun to Hindian, but Shaikh KhazaTs right to these territories was not definitely established till 1903, when he was given by firman a secure title to all Southern ’ Arabistan, with the exception of the Jarrahi estates, which w ere owned by Persian landlords. From his father and brother he held large estates in Turkish territory, to which he himself added until he became the largest landowner in Basrah. To the north-west the Shaikh’s authority to the Bani Turuf brought the Hawizah district under his control. The development of the Karun trade gave Mu ham- mar all a steadily increasing importance as the Port of Central Persia, and Shaikh Khaza’l’s personality and friendship with the British Government did not tend to allay the distrust, which was aroused alike in Turkey and Persia by his growing influence. 1914-1918. During the w^ar the Shaikh continued his friendly relations with the British Government and in 1915 when certain unruly tribes under his jurisdiction, incited by the preaching of a 4 jihad 5 by Turkish emissaries, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks to attack our troops at Ahwaz and cut the pipe line of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, he did much to facilitate the rapid restitution of order as soon as the Turks w r ere driven across the Karkheh by the operations of the 12th Division. In Northern ’Arabistan, which during the war was in an even more chaotic state tflan the southern province, law and order was eventually restored by British officers, who were sent to the fanatical towns of Dizful and Shushtar. 1919-1923. Since the Armistice law and order have been restored in ’Arabistan and British troops have been withdrawn from the province. Attitvd 1 Tie Shaikh of Muhammarah still remains the firm friend of the Biitish, but though his influence over his tid es is still great, his oppression of them has led them to hate as w ell as fear him. His position with the Governor-General of ’Arabistan, w ho resides either at Dizful or Shushtar, is not always enviable due to either one or the other encroaching on the preserves of the other, whilst his relations with the Persian Government are far from satisfactory. With the Bakhtiari chiefs he has an agreement to keep the peace, but a long-standing hatred exists between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiari Khans, which can never be entirely wfiped out. Shaikh Khaza’l, however, is powerful, a fact which15 is realised by the Persian Government and the Bakhtiaris, and so long as he lives the province of ’Arabistan may hope for peace and prosperity, but the day of his death will be a bad day for ’Arabistan and possibly the British, who will never be able to rely with the same confidence on the support of his successor, whoever he may be.16 [CHAPTER II. Geography. Boundaries: Northern. 5 Arabistan is divided into Northern and Southern ’Arabistan. Northern ’Arabistan is contiguous on the south with Southern ’Arabistan. The eastern boundary runs from 5 miles north of Band-i-Qir on the right bank of Ab-i-Gargar to Bulaiti, and thence crossing to the left bank, extends to a point some seven miles to the east of Shush tar. The northern boundary runs along the foot of the mountains, including within it the plains of Aqili and Ab-i-Bid across the Ab-i-Diz to Mazraeh-i-Salih- abad, 10 miles north-west to Bizful, and thence through Pa-i- Pul on the Karkheh to an undefined place near the Bawarij stream, on the Iraq-Persian boundary, as defined by the Turkish Boundary Commission. This frontier bounds Northern ’Arabis tan on the West. On the north Southern Arabistan adjoins the northern province. On the west the Traq-Persian frontier continues a boundary on that side to a point on the left bank of the Shatt-ah Arab, about 1 mile above the village of Hadd and opposite the island of Tawilah. Prom this point to the Persian Gulf, the boundary, fixed by the treaty of Erzerum in 1847, is the Shatt- al- Arab. The southern boundary is the coast of the Persian Gulf from the estuary of the Shatt-al-’Arab eastward to a point between Shah A hub Shah and Bilam. The eastern boundary is undefined, but may be taken to be an imaginary line running from the last named place to the intersection of Lat. 31 North with Long. 50 East; another imaginary line from this inter section to a point a few miles from and immediately north of Band-i-Qir completes the perimeter of the province. The area of ’Arabistan is estimated at 16,000 square miles.17 facing the last from the point just below the Shur-i-Labahri to within 2 miles of Shushtar. A short, rocky ridge, crosses the Ab-i-Diz obliquely at Kut Bandar. The only permanent rivers are the Ab-i-Gargar and Shatait, branches of the Karun ; the Ab-i-Diz with its tributaries; and the Karkheh. The whole of the country is a flat surface, being broken in one place only by a range of hills running west-north-westerly and east-south-easterly, which the Karun river pierces at right angles at Ahwaz. These hills are of red sandstone and rise to 200 feet, the entire length of the range being about 30 miles. The level, open plains are mostly barren and thinly sprinkled with desert scrub, though some portions of it are grassy and in spring bear patches of wheat and barley. On the east the Fallahiyah and Ma’shur districts in winter become considerable salt swamps, while on the west the neighbourhood of Hawizah is altogether a marsh. Date trees line the banks of the Shatt- al-’Arab, of the Upper Bahmanshir, and the Karun to 20 miles above Muhammarah; elsewhere there are no trees but only belts of willows, tamarisk and other bushes fringing the banks of the rivers. The only navigable river is the Karun. The Jarrahi river enters the Persian Gulf at its extreme northerly point by the Hor Vasta. About 20 miles lower down the coast the Hindian river with a south-south-westerly course flows into the Gulf also. The Karun and Jarrahi run ordinarily between steep banks of some height. The altitude of ’Arabistan ranges from sea level on the coast of the Persian Gulf to the Kuh-i-Fadalak sandstone range of 1,200 feet. There are no mountains in ’ Arabistan, the highest range of hills being the Kuh-i-Fadalak, which lies to the north-north east of Shushtar and is pierced by the Karun river. It forms the outer range of limestone and sandstone hills running parallel to the Marri ranges north-east of it. (1). Kdr an, (a) General Description .—This is the largest and only navi gable river in Arabistan. It rises from the western spurs of the Kuh-i-Rang or Jaihun in the heart of the Bakhtiari country, about 100 miles due west of Isfahan. Before ’Arabistan is reached the river has already run a course of some 350 miles, when it runs into the plains of this province north of Shushtar MC164CGS n 2 . Souther®. Altitude. Mountains. Itivers.Not far below its exit from the hills at Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, an ancient fort in Persia on its left bank, it passes the village of 'Gutwand on its right bank. Here there is on that side a fertile alluvial plain, sloping down slightly from the west, and opposite to the fertile plain of ’Aqili, round which the river flows in a remarkable curve. Completing this curve in a north-east direc tion, the river buckles round the elbow of a range of hills on the rig]it bank and them makes an acute bend almost due south It shortly after receives the brackish waters of the Shur-Labahrl one of its largest tributaries, which flows into it from the left along the foot of the ridge known as the Kuh-i-Fadalak This range on the left and the lower hills on the right bank 'form a defile through which the river passes, until it Lerges into“he plain about 3 miles above Shushtar. Some 2i miles beyond this barrier and about 600 yards above Shushtar'it divides into two streams, the left branch being called the Ab-i-Gargar The branch to the right retains its name as the Karun and on the north side of the town forms a broad sheet of water, and then urning to the south and passing an ancient dam and bridge once known as the Band-i-Kaisar, but now called the Pul i- Dizful (400 feet) changes its name to the Ab-i-Shatait. (For a description of the Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait see below.) , ftl a P 0mt , 3 + ? miles f outh in a direct line from Shushtar, or at 453 miles of the river s course (reckoning by the Ab-i-Gargar) the two branches re-unite with the village of Band-i-Qir situLd at the angle of their confluence. At the point of junction the Abu-Diz from the west also adds its waters to the Karun. There is a bridge constructed across the Ab-i-Gargar about 200 vards on to Wat ontto left bank (465 miles) the river is almost straight with a due southerly course From Wais to Ahwaz (496 miles) on the left bank its general direction is south-west bv south the river making a number of bends and nearly doubling the distances between these places, as compared to that by the land route which is only 16 miles. ' 0 ute I Immediately above Ahwaz, where it is now about 600 vard s angles, and m so doing forms a ser.Vc r.f -V m, 1 ri 8 ht obstruct sonte U miles the rioefs coumeTdUnX 2X19 lower end of another small island called Umm-as-Saba. Just below them the settlement of Bandar Nasiri, or Nasiriyah, has sprung up. From Nasiri the general direction of the river is south by south-west. It makes a series of extraordinary bends as far as the tomb of ’Ah bin Hussain, which is some 40 miles in a straight line from Nasiri, though approximately at 575 miles of the river’s course. From this point onwards its bends become less frequent and pronounced, eventually reaching the Shatt-al- ’Arab at a point situated 25 to 30 miles in a direct line to the south-west of ’Ali bin Hussain. At 593 miles it throws off the Salmanieh or Salmaneh canal, now almost dry, from its left bank; and at 3 miles further down, opposite the island of Hair, there is another outlet from the left bank, called the Marid-al- A ma, which runs inland for about a mile and forms the mouth of the Fallahiyah-Maiid canal, which is supplied with water by the Jarrahi river. On the south-west bank of this creek at J of a mile from the entrance, are some heaps marking the site of the old village of Marid. A dry hollow, containing bushes at the end towards the Karim, connects the Marid-al-A’ma with the Qanaqeh branch of Hor Musa; at one time, no doubt, the * Kanin discharged a part of its waters by this route to the sea. On the right bank, opposite to the Marid' creek, is the site of the old Cha’b settlement of Sableh. At 607 miles the Bahmanshir channel leaves the Karim on the left bank and follows an independent course to the Persian Gulf; this channel vas once the main course of the hLarun. Its present) debouchment into the Shatt-al- Arab, 2 miles further down at 610 miles, is called the Halfar, or canal. It was originally a small canal cut for irrigation purposes, but the river, finding this course more appropriate, wore down the dam which regulated its out-take of water and eventually burst through in full force, thus forming a new and more important channel for its final exit into the estuary. (b) and (c). Floods and Navigation.—For remarks under these two headings, vide Chapter VIII, Biver Routes. [d). Bridges. At the present time, 1923, there is only one bridge across the Karim at Band-i-Qir. During the war a flying bridge was constructed at Ahwaz but this has since been re moved. This bridge was situated 2 miles upstream of Ahwaz.£0 The A. P. 0. C. have also built a pontoon bridge across the Ah- i-Gargar branch of the Karun, vide ; Ab-i-Gargar, Band-i-Qir brid'/e.—This bridge is built on piles, constructed from old pipe lines of 8' diameter, having timber girders and super structure with a central lifting space of 41 feet' for river traffic The central lifting span, under which there is from 6 to 7 ft of water, is worked by a hand winch on the left bank. There is not more than 3 6 to 4 ft. of water for 30 yards about this span, but in these parts the river bed is hard. Silt is only to be found 1 in 6 or 7 ft. of water. The bridge has a roadway of 14 ft. and is capable of bearing loaded Peerless lorries. It is however in a poor state oi repair and would require a thorough inspection and possibly considerable work before being used for heavier traffic. The bridge is situated about 200 yards above Band-i-QIr village and is an important, though not essentia) link on the road communication between Ahwaz-Shushtar and Ahwaz Darakhazmah. Built at the cost of 48,000 rupees to replace a previous barrel bridge, the property of the Shaikh of Muhamma- rah. it was sold to the Shaikh at the conclusion of the war. (2) Ab-i-Shataii. (a). General I)escription.-~This river forms the right branch of the Karun after its bifurcation above Shushtar, and until it re-umtes at Band-i-Qir with that portion of its waters which runs through the alternative channel of the Ab-i-Gargar. The course ot the Shatait is much more crooked than that of the Gargar arid the stream is much wider, attaining a maximum breadth of 250 yards at a point about 16 miles above Band-i- Qir, rv.lore a rocky spur comes down to the stream on its left side. The steep banks are covered with scrub. At its function with the Gargar and Diz the Shatait is 150 yards wide. Its colour when in flood is a greyish green and it is slower to show discolouration than either the Gargar or the Diz. It carries less silt than the Gargar, the Diz or the Lower Karun. At Shushtar the Shatait is crossed by a gigantic dam sun porting a bridge which is known as the Pul bShahi or DiV.fid The bridge, however, is broken down, vide Shushtar town, and the arches still standing are divided bv a breach about 170 feet ong through which the main stream of the river passes, the weir21 at this point having given way as well as the bridge. The ma terials and construction of the weir are superior to those of the bridge. The stream in the spring floods has a current running up to 6 ft. a second, and is dangerous to animals which have to eross it. At Shushtar the river is crossed by Jcattaks, but in low water season it is possible for a man to ford it some two hundred yards below the bridge. The Shatait is not applied to irrigation except on a petty scale near villages, though if the weir was repaired it would be possible to make use of the Shatait for extensive irrigation. The principal tribe in the neighbourhood of the Shatait are the ‘Anafijah, who live upon its lower reaches. (6). Nai igation .—When steam navigation was introduced on the Karun, the Shushan, still in use, a stern wheeler 100 feet long with a beam of 23 and an ordinary draft of 3 feet, ran for more than a year on the Shatait, instead of upon the Gargar as at present, it being at that time believed that in the low season the channel of the Gargar might become impassable. It was however found that the river could not be navigated with safetv by a vessel of the Shusharis dimensions above Chehar Dingeh, a point 10 miles distant by land from Shushtar, on account of the intricacy and number of the channels and of the shingly nature of the bed, which prevented the use of anchors from getting oh when aground. Below Chehar Dingeh the only serious obstacle was a double reef of rocks with a narrow channel, through which the water raced violently; the difficulty of the reef was at times increased by the formation of sand- ^ banks below it. It was found that owing to want of water, the passage of the reef was uncertain in August and September, dangerous in October and impossible in November, but the level of the river did not vary regularly with the season. Native craft prefer the Gargar to the Shatait. (3). Ab-i Gargar. (a). General Description .—This channel, the uppermost part of which is artificial, issues from the left bank of the Karun just above Shushtar, and rejoins the river at Band-i-Qir. Its direction is thus almost exactly from north to south and its length in a straight line about 30 miles, but between its extreme points it forms a regular curve to eastwards of which the maxi mum divergence from the direct line is about 8 miles. The Gargar forms the eastern boundary of the MTan-Ab island. MC164CGS« 22 At its head are the remains of a massive barrage, formerly called the Band-i-Kaisarl, and later the Band-i-Shahzadeh, and now known as the Band i-Nurgan, built of hewn stone, with six narrow openings through which the water passes, leaving the crest dry and traversable except when the river is high and pours over it. Below this barrage the stream flows for a mile through a channel of 100 feet depth, artificially excavated in the sandstone rock; it then reaches a dam called the Pul-i-Bulaiti. Here the water is forced into tunnels in the precipitous rock, which conduct it through a number of flour mills built in the honeycombed rock side of the channel a little farther down. Below this dam the rock of the banks yields to earth, but the sides continue to be nearly 100 feet in height till the end of Shushtar town is reached. On the right bank 7 or 8 miles below Shushtar is the important landing place of Shalaili, above which there is not for practical purposes, any navigation either European or native. From here to a short distance above Band-i-Qir the Gargar meanders through low ground several hundred yards broad, enclosed upon either side by steep cW banks from 40 to 50 feet high, with which the river in its wind ings from time to time comes into contact. As Band-i-Qir is approached the high banks close in upon the river and show remains of brick buildings, vestiges of the ancient city of ’Askar Mukaram ; parts of these are sunk as much as GO and even 20 feet below the present surface of the ground. At Band-i-Qir the banks do not ordinarily rise more than 18 feet above the river in its lowest season ; and in the high season, during floods, they are frequently overflowed. The width of the Gargar varies from 50 to nearly 100 yards, and at Band-i-Qir it is about 60. (b) and (c) Navigation and Floods ,—For remarks under these tv T o headings, vide Chapter VIII, River routes. {d) Bridges .—There are two bridges across the Gargar, one at the junction of the Shatait, Gargar and Biz at Band-i-Qir, which forms once more the Karim river, vide River Karim, (d). The other is a barrel pontoon bridge at Barakhazinah, con structed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for their own use and capable of carrying loads up to 2 tons. This bridge is necessary if the Ahwaz-Band-i-Qir-Barakhazinah road is used. There is however an alternative road from Ahwaz to Barakha zinah along the pipe line, vide Chapter VIII, which abandons the use of either of these two bridges, but the road is much23 {Hi \y intersected with nullahs and more liable to surprise from raid- ins. tribes. There are innumerable rivers and canals in ’Arabistan, but other riy#rs. with the exception of the Bahmanshir, which in its lower reaches nearest the Gulf is navigable for boats of certain low drafts, none are navigable and therefore of little or no military impor tance. Of the more important of these rivers a short account is given in this report; for fuller details vide Gazetteer of Persia, Volume HI. (1) Karicheh. — (a) General Description. The Karkheh, though not navigable, in one of the most important rivers of Western Persia. From the junction of the Ab-i-Zal with the Gamasil, Kara Su and Saimarreh at a point some 30 miles north-north-west of Dizful the river formed by these streams is first known as the Karkheh. At 40 miles of its course it enters the plains of ’Arabistan, about 15 miles to the west of the Ab-i-Diz. Near its exit from the hills the river passes the Pa-i-Pul, where it was formerly spanned by a bridge and about 4 miles south-west of Pa-i-Pul, to the right of the river and half a mile away from it are the Sassanian ruins of Aivan-i-Kasrah or Asiran-i-Karkheh. Here the river flows in several arms divid ed by low islands. Being little below the level of the adjacent countrv it is immediately available ror irrigation, and a number of canals diverge from its left bank and water the lands of the Sagwand Lurs. Leaving Shush at 56 miles and some distance from its left bank, the Karkheh pursues its course with number less windings in a general south-south-east or south by east direction to a place at 120 miles and about 25 miles west of Band-i-Qir, where it winds suddenly to the south-west and so runs for about 20 miles, passing in this stage between the hills which form the north-eastern boundary of the Hawizah district and the low range which forms their prolongation and crosses the Karun river at Ahwaz. At the end of this reach, approxi mately 150 miles, the Karkheh reaches Nahr Hashim in the Hawizah district, the site formerly of a massive dam by which the whole irrigation of the district was regulated. When this dam was in existence the farther course of the river lay first southwards and then through Hawizah towm; but since the dam gave way in 1837, the main stream of the river has taken24 &amp; north-westerly course from Nahr Hashirn, and its wafers, dis sipated in streams and marshes, have submerged and ruine4 the district. At the western extremity of the district the river gradually reassembles its waters, and, finally under the name of the Shuaib and augmented by the overflow of some of the Tigris marshes, it enters the Shatt-al-Arab about 4 miles below Qurnah. The waters of the Upper Karkheh are celebrated for their purity, but lower down the stream is contaminated bv the stag nant fluid of the marshes. Some of the villages of ' the Dizfui district are irrigated from the Karkheh, whilst in the whole of its course its waters are used for irrigation to a large extent; m places it dissolves into a network of canals. Its banks are wooded with tamarisk jungle and small trees. A belt of scrub. milelh f Jan f al - 1 K Gh ^ a ^, extends for a distance of about 50 mfles between the Karkheh and Shaur rivers, and has an average breadth of 5 miles.

Guide. —A guide can be obtained from Shaikh Mackenzie (Mush at tat). 4. MASAI LAH.— Situation. The ford is situated about 4| miles from Shush and just above an old arm of the river, which should be crossed 200 yards from its junction with the river on account of quick sands. The only obstacle on the road between Shush and the ford is the river Shaur ; otherwise the going is good with the exception of one or two water cuts that require ramping. The bearing from Shush Castle is approximately 310 degrees.Approaches. —The ford is situated exactly opposite the highest trees on the further bank. The entrance is easy; the exit is over sand to the main river bank, which is steep. Jungle con tinues from the main right bank as far as Cha’b ridge which runs in a semi-circle with a radius of 800 yards from the ford and commands the crossing. Description of Ford. —To cross the ford it is necessary to proceed slightly downstream across the main stream to a spit forming the crest of a small rapid. The greatest depth in this portion is 2Jr feet. A mounted man at a walk takes 2 and a dismounted man 3 minutes. When at the crest of this rapid the average depth is 1 . The remainder of the crossing which is simple takes a further minute. The total breadth of water crossed is 150 yards. The strength of the stream is gentle ; the bed pebbly. 5. SHUZAfF.

Approaches .—Entrance to and exit from the ford easy Tamarisk jungle grows on both banks up to the dry bed which extends for 300 yards on either bank to the stream itself. Description .—Within the space of two years a considerable change was noticed in this ford. It is therefore advisable to give two separate descriptions. 1st year, (probably 1916). The ford runs direct across the stream for 50 yards to a pebbly spit, which is under water. This first part of the stream is the main stream and the greatest depth is 3' 3'. It then continues diagonally upstream along the strip for 300 yards to a sandy strip. Of the strip the last 70 yards is the deepest, 2 7 7' being the greatest depth, and the stream is strong. The bed of the ford is firm and pebbly. A mounted man takes 5 minutes to cross at a walk. The ford is passable for pack transport but loaded carts would have difficulty in crossing the last 70 yards owing to the strength of the stream. Cavalry can cross in sections. 2nd year .—The depth of the ford in the first position is found to vary between 18' and 3 7 , while the spit over which the water flowed in the previous year, is above water. In the last position the depth of the ford varied from 9 7/ to 32 Instead of entering the ford direct it was possible in this year to approach diagonally to the spit from a shingle point on the near bank. Breadth of the whole crossing is 150 yards.31 bed of the river broad and shingly, and the stream flows in several arms. About 600 yards below the Dizful bridge it is possible for men and animals to ford the river in low water season. At 191 miles the Eala Rud from the north joins the Ab-i-Diz, and soon afterwards the river turns south-south-east. At 198 miles the river becomes more united above Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah, and at 201 miles the ruins of Susa are passed standing some 6 miles west of the right bank. Opposite this point the left bank of the river is heavily irrigated. The direction of the river continues gen erally to the south-south-east to a point within 8 miles of the bank of the river Karim below Wais ; but the course of this section is extraordinarily serpentine and at 11m Kathir or Khaneh -i-Farhan, about 2 miles bv land above Kut Bandar, it is onlv about 16 miles from Shush tar. The Ab-i-Diz after leaving Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah is joined from the north at some 246 miles by the ’Auruh stream. At about 260 miles the Kahunak or Shureh river also flows into the Ab-i-Diz from the left; at 269 miles where Ilm Kathir is passed, the Sabz Ab adds its quota to the river, and at Kut Bandar after a course of some 275 miles the Mukhaibat also joins the river. At this point a rocky ridge, not more than 100 feet high, is pierced by the river in its course ; this ridge is named Umm-al-’Ayai. As the river approaches the Karun, its banks contain some forest, and 13 miles from. Band-i-Qir the Shavur river joins it from the north-west. Finally the Ab-i-Diz empties itself into the Karun at Band-i-Qir and loses its identity as a separate river after a total course of some 360 miles. , (b) Navigation. Though at the present time the Diz is never used for naviga tion, it is not impossible though difficult and Kut Bandar must be considered the practical limit for vessels of the type of the Shushan, which is a stern wheeler of 100 feet length over all, 23 feet beam and 3 feet ordinary draught. It is stated though that during the spring rises of the river, navigation is possible for a large light-draught steamer as far as Deh-i-Nau about 100 miles by river and 20 miles by land from Dizful, but there is no surveyed route on record between these points. For further details, vide Persian Gazetteer.32 (c) Fords. I. HUSSANIYAH. Situation .—The ford is situated near Shaikh Kharaibat’s summer camp about 9^ miles south of east of Shush.

There is cultivation on either bank. Description of ford .—The entrance to the ford is down a cut ting to the water’s edge but before crossing the water it is neces sary to move downstream for 80 yards, when a direct crossing is made over the right branch of the river to an island. Width of water crossed. —80 yards. Breadth of ford. —50 yards. Depth. —1J feet, greatest depth. (In September 1916, 3 ft.). Bottom. —Pebbly. Stream. —Very slow. Exit. —Easy. The island must then be crossed in an easterly direction along its northern edge for 600 yards, when a wet muddy inlet is Reached; the northern edge of this must be followed along a spit formed by it and the left branch of the river for a further 600 yards. The left branch, which is the main stream, is then crossed by moving diagonally, downstream. Width of water. —120 yards. Length of ford. —200 yards. Greatest depth. —1J feet. BiOttam. —Shingle. Velocity. —If mile per hour. Passable by wheeled transport except motors. Entrance and exit, easy. The left branch of the river can be crossed near the junction but the water is much deeper. The island is under water after winter rains, when the ford is impassable, i.e., December t« May. MC164CGS • i.c 34 Communication .—Signalling communication with Shush ©an be opened from Mill tower or conical hill on the west bank. Guide.—A guide can be obtained from the headman of the village Saki. (3) SHAVUR (OR SHAuR), ORIGINALLY SHAPtjR. A river of ’Arabistan, which rises from springs in the plain between the rivers Karkheh and Diz at Aivan-i-Kasra or Asiran- i-Karkheh. Some twelve miles below its source, flowing nearly south and parallel to the Karkheh, from which it is never many miles dis tant, it washes the western foot of the ruins of Shush or Susa. At this point it is 1J miles east of the river Karkheli and miles west of the Ab-i-Diz. Continuing southward Kut-al-Mihdi is passed at 20 miles. Here the Shavur bends south-south-east towards the Diz river, passing Khairabad at 55 miles and Deh- i-Sayid Musa at 60 miles, both on the right bank. Thence for ward the river curves more and more to the east towards the river Diz, and begins to leave the Karkheh which soon after wards bends south-west towards Hawizah. Passing within 2 miles of Deh-i-Pur Muhammad on the right bank at about 64 miles, the Shavur joins the river Diz by two branches above Band-i-Qir after a course of about 75 miles by water, or of 60 miles neglecting bends. These two branches separate at Hawizah and enter the larger river at 38 and 26 miles respectively by water above Band-i-Qlr. The former of these branches is named the Sharish, and the latter the Kharur ; both contain water at all seasons of the year but the Kharur is more import ant. Originally the Shavur flowed into the river Karun, from the north west a little below Wais and, at a later period, near Ahwaz. After deserting this bed it adopted a more southerly channel, joining the main river near Ahwaz. Later again it struck northwards and in 1842 was found entering the Ab-i-Diz at a point 12 miles above Band-i-QTr. This channel appears to have been more or less maintained till the present day. The Shavur is of canal-like appearance, its course is wind ing, and its width of 25 to 30 yards is fairly uniformly maintain ed. At least in some of the upper reaches, the banks are high (6 to 12 feet above the water) and the river is in some places unford- abie ; but taking it throughout its length, the stream is sluggish, its banks and bed soft and of alluvial soil, and it can be fordedat frequent intervals, the fords being generally girth deep. The banks are lined almost throughout with low tamarisk jungle and 4 in its higher reaches, with thorn trees, and abound with wild boar, hyaenas and small game. The lands upon the Shavur, especially those of the ’Ajairib tract, are fertile, and the banks are clothed in spring with luxuriant herbage. Throughout its course a number of canals diverge from the river, some of ancient and some of modern construction, and the river is largely drawn on for irrigation, at the low season its waters being practically exhausted for this purpose. The prin cipal canals which leave the Shavur on its left bank are, in des cending order, the followingKhairabad, Taraih, Qumat, Ishareh and the Hawasiyeh ; of these the Taraifi and Hawaslyeh benefit the ’Anahjeh tribe and the remainder water the lands of Bait Sa’ad. In some places if forms marshes, which are tenanted by pastoral Arabs and cultivated with rice. There are several Arab settlements upon it, of which the most important are the Qumat and Khairabad, the former probably being the present Kut-al-Mahdh (b) Navigation .—There is no navigation on this river, nor is it possible. (c) Fords .—As mentioned above the river is fordable almost anywhere especially in the low^er reaches. There is however one important ford, where during the war a bridge was constructed but has since beep, washed away, on the Ahwaz-Bizful road (vide Chapter VIII). t (4) BALA-RfjD, B1LA RuT&gt; or BALAD RuD, A stream which rises near Qllab in the foothills of the Pusht- i-Kuh in Southern Luristan, and, passing 5 miles west of Dizful and 1 mile east of Bunvar, joins the river Diz on the left bank 11 miles below Bizful. Its bed is coarse shingle. In mid-sum mer it is dry except for pools ; in autumn it becomes a flowing stream supplying many Sagwand camps ; after heavy rain it is apt to become impassable for one or two days, the river coming down in a torrent of tremenlous force. Navigation is impossible. There is one easy and important ford on the Ahwaz-Dizful road mentioned in Chapter VIII36 (5) BAHMANSHIR, or BAHR-I-MASHIR* This is the channel, which leaves the left bank of the Karun y 2 miles above Muhammarah, and forms the eastern boundary of ’Abadan island from that point to the sea. It should however be mentioned that the name Bahmansbir is locally applied to the last reach of the Karun, called, and perhaps wrongly by Europeans “ Haffar.” The Bahmanshlr has among the natives no general name, but is described by various local terms, such as Shatt Shaikh and Shatt Tara, taken from the villages on its banks. The total length of the Bahmanshir, as accepted by us, is 54 miles by its winding course and 40 miles in a straight line ; its mouth in the Persian Gulf is about 10 miles east of the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. There are two remarkable bends rather below the middle of its course. The breadth of the river varies from 300 yards in the upper reaches to 600 yards, and even 4 mile as it approaches the sea. The rise and fall of the tide which is felt throughout the whole length of the Bahmanshir is about 9 feet. The channel between the mouth of the river and the open sea is called the Har Bahmanshir. From the Karun the banks are lined with villages and date plantations to within 10 miles of the sea; low grassy plains follow, the banks for some distance remaining firm and steep ; finally the stream enters a region of shelving mud-flats, covered, above the water line, with coarse grass and weeds. Islands are easily formed in the Bahmanshir by staking the stream and so causing a deposit of silt, and this is frequently done. The new island is at first used for pasturage and ultimately brought under Cultivation. (b) Navigation. —Towards the middle of the nineteenth century it carried about two-fifths of the water of the Karun, and its depth at low water was nowhere less than 9 ft. ; but by 1890 tne uppermost 15 miles of its course had become obstructed by banks which in places dried almost across the channel at low water, and the R. I. M. S. 4 Comet ’, drawing only 3 ft., grounded twice in making the passage the 30 miles of river nearest the sea, however, then continued navigable for vessels of not more than 7 ft. draft. Native sea boats cannot now pass the shoals of the Upper Bahmanshir without assistance from the tide. (6) JARRAHI. (a) General description .—This river is formed within the bounds of Ramuz district by the junction of the Ramuz river37 with the Martin. Passing a place called Cham Mani, 4 miles below the confluence, the river breaks through a belt of low hills and emerges near Oham-us-Sabi into the Jarrahi district. Thence it runs via Khalafabad to the village of Maqtti, 11 miles north of Ma’shtir, where it changes direction and runs for about 10 miles west-north-west to Qarqar, where it leaves the Jarrahi district and enters that of Fallahiyah. It then flows practically west for 14 miles, and then turns south-west and runs for 5 miles to Khazlnah, 2 miles north of Buzieh town, where it mostly is dissipated into canals. The remaining stream now becomes the Fallahiyah-Marid canal. Above Cham-us-Sabi the river is broad and rapid with a breadth of about 80 yards, and the banks, which are of no great height, are covered with tamarisk. For some miles below Cham-us-Sabi the same characteristics are preserved and the stream is divided by islands. Below Khalafabad the Jarrahi runs with a slow current and is 60 to 70 yards broad. From this point onwards its breadth gradually diminishes to 40 yards. (b) Navigation.—Boats 40 ft. long, with a beam of 6 to 8 ft. and drawing 2 to 3 ft. of water, can ascend the river as far as Khalafabad at all seasons. A bellam, which can be used as a ferry boat, is kept at Maksar, and there is another at Haddameh. (See Marid canal.) (c) Fords. -The river is fordable in summer at numerous places, and some fords near Khalafabad are fordable for laden animals during the greater part of the year, except after recent rain. There is a ford, difficult in Winter, one mile below Cham- us-Sabi, and another unfordable in winter at Rahaneh, 8 miles above Maksar. (d) Canals .—More than 90% of the canals in Southern ’Arab- istan branch off from the Jarrahi river, all of which irrigate thousands of date palms and numerous acres of rice. Amongst these belong the great Janjireh group of 21 canals, whilst in addition there are 43 branching off from the right bank and 21 from the left bank of the Jarrahi river. Owing to the Ch’ab tribe having settled for the most part on the banks of certain MC164CGS38 canals, tlie-e are the best known and have become the m&amp;sfc important, viz: From right bank. From left bank. Ghaiyazi. Buzieh. Gharaibah. Qatrani. Jafal. Sa’adi. Jafari. Khazali. Maksar. Subahiyah. Tupebiyah. Umm al Sakhr. Subaichiyah. Aushar. Though not a direct branch of the J arrahi river the Aushar canal for the same reasons as those mentioned above is important and should be recorded here. It is a canal in the Fallahiyah district, irrigating land cultivated chiefly by the Asachirah section of the Ch ab tribe. Some distance below Buzieh, on the west side of which it passes at half a mile distance, the Aushar forms two branches known as the Hor and the Nahr Musa. Mar id.—Mar id Canal, which connects the Jarrahi river wit! the Karun, is a canal south of Ahwaz. It runs from Sid-i oulaiman to Qubban. When Qubban got ruined and Fallahiya! began to prosper, the Salmanieh canal was dug. A branch wa also dug from the Marid canal to Fallahiyah. The Marid cana Th m- “ ounds I f the oId d y ke are generally called ‘ Sabla. Ihe Marid canal has water at high tide as far as Fallahiyah Tor a number or miles in the neighbourhood of Fallahiyah thi canal is only a ditch 6 to 8 feet wide with a depth of 1A to 2 tons bm U 18 tkerefo f ^F-aeticable to boats of more than i A ®’ &gt;l :. Ir couId probably be widened without much difficulty and deeper.' ^ * 6 the Canal beginS t0 become wid « (7) MARIJN. Kurdistan o^Behbph 14 ^* 31 - 11 ^ ra r * dstan some times called th ivurctistan or Behbehan river. It unites with the river RfilaWa m the Ramuz district, 10 or 11 miles below RSnm towm and th« two together then form the Jarrahi river. Snl«„abad™d“a ? I^39 in the Ramuz district lie respecti vely 13 and 28 miles up from its junction with the Bulawas. The valley of the Marun in the Ramuz district is 1 to 2 miles wide, flat and enclosed by cliffs, 50 to 100 feet high. The stream is 50 to 100 yards broad, 3 to 6 feet deep and has a strong current. The banks are bordered with thick willow jungle. About 5 miles above Sultanabad the Marin receives on its right bank a tributary of fresh water called Mamuhieh, 10 yards wide and three feet deep, fringed with willows and oleanders. On the north side of the river in places are grassy plains with thorn trees. The river has also been called the Rud-i-Marun or Rumarun. (8) GfjPAL. A brackish stream which traverses the great plain common to the Ramuz and Ahwaz districts, forming a somewhat serious obstacle on the Nasiri-Ramuz road. The Gupal consists of merely the surplus water of a canal which takes off from the right bank of the Ramuz river at a point about 5 miles north of Ramuz town. At about 4 miles north of the town the river is augmented by a brackish tributary, which has its rise in the gypsum hills; the increased stream continues to flow north-westwards, keeping within a mile of the hills and parallel to them, until the mounds of Kut-ush-Shaikh are reached, lying about 2 miles to the south ward. After three or four miles the Gupal changes direction to the south-west, and so passes about 6 miles north of the village of Mirbacheh. Near this it receives on the left bank two tribu taries, the fresh stream which has its course about a mile eastward of Mirbacheh, and the salt Muwailah stream. About 9 miles after passing Mirbacheh a salt stream from the north called Kundak falls into the Gupal on its right bank. Eventually, about 12 miles west of Mirbacheh the Gupal intersects the usual route between Nasiri and Ramuz; there is some choice of crossing places. At this point in its course the water of the Gupal is salt even after rain. The banks, which are in most parts perpendicular and of clay, rise about 20 feet above the level of the bed, and the distance between them varies from 20 to 70 yards. In summer the Gupal is almost dry : in winter it sometimes rises 20 or 30 feet and overflows its banks and at that season it may be found either fordable or unfordable. Quicksands occur. About 300 yards below that point the river bends to the west, and 8 miles further down it is drawn off in a southerly direction40 in numerous small canals, some of which being 3 ft. deep, are difficult to cross. The Gupal now ceases to exist, and the surplus water which is not used for cultivation spreads out to the Shakheh marsh. (9) HINDI AN, or ZAIDAN or AB ZUHREH. The river is formed by the junction in the plain of Zaidan at a point 22 miles north by west from Bandar Dllam on the coast of two streams, the Khairabad or Ab-bShmn and the Shulistan or Ab Shur, both from the eastward. The water of the former is sweet and of the latter bitter. The water of the Hindian is slightly tainted by that of the Shuliatan even after its junction with the Khairabad, yet not in such a degree as to make it undrinkable. The upper course of the river formed by their union is general ly known by the name of Zaidan not of Hindian, and may be taken to extend from Haidar Karar, a small Imamzadeh situated on the tongue of land between the Khairabad and the Shulistan, to the border of the Hindian district, where it issues from the hills. The lower or Hindian course, where the river first meets the province of ’Arabistan, begins between the village of Ghuleh and Shirabad. From here it runs first for five miles west- north-west to Suvaireh ; it then turns, and its average direction from Savaireh to Hindian village, a distance of 22 miles in a straight line, is due southwards. Passing Kut and Deh Mulla, 4 miles below which are a village and a small boat-ferry, the river continues southwards until Hindian town, which stands on both banks of the river, is reached. At Hindian town the river is unfordable, the breadth in February being about 8 yards, ft can, though, be forded about 9 miles above the town. From here its course becomes winding and, after all but reaching the sea at a place 10 miles south-south-west of Hindian village, it meanders due westwards for another 9 miles, keeping within 2 or mi es o the coast the whole way, and eventually attains the Persian Gulf at a point 16 miles south-west-west of Hindian vil lage as the crow flies, but double that distance from it by water. anrMt em ^^diure the Hindian cuts its way through mud flats, and i ts mouth is difficult to discover from sea-wards owing to the Hatness of the coast. 6The average width of the river from Deh Mull a to its mouth is from 50 to 70 yards ; but at Kut it is said to be less than 35; the height of its banks diminishes from 25 ft. at Kut to 20 at Deh Mulla, 14 at Hindian town, and 8 at Ga ’AIL Above Suvaireh the Hindian is broken up into more than one channel, but from Suvaireh do wn wards, it flows in a single bed, having high banks and a nearly constant width of about 60 yards. The bottom from the beginning of the district till 6 miles below Suvaireh is shingly, and thence to the sea it is of hard mud. The water of the Hind Ian is drinkable, though im pregnated with a salt or alkali brought down by the Shulistan^ which gives it a bitter taste but does not prevent the lathering of soap. It has, however, been reported as sweet and clear in September. In winter the river flows with a strong current throughout its course. The country on both sides of the river consists of featureless? plains which the stream, except near the north end of the district, has not been utilised to irrigate. Here and there are patches of musk and water-melons in the actual bed but the banks bear nothing but an occasional tamarisk until a fine grove of tall date-trees, called Nakhl Bagush, belonging to Tuwaisheh, is reached near the mouth of the river. The banks for the last 2 or 3 miles before reaching the sea are covered with bulrushes. 4 j From Gargar to 6 miles below Suvaireh there is irrigation by means of 4 jubs 5 or water cuts, taking off from various natural branches of the river. (5) Navigation .—Little is known of the navigation of the river, but it is navigable for native sea going boats up to Hindian village, and no farther. * (1) DIZFUL.— Lat. 32-21. Long. 48*21. Elev. 660L ^ ($) General description .—The city of Dizful in K or them Arabistan is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, about 20 miles below where that river emerges into the plain after turning the corner round Kaleh Shahid. The site is elevated and some what uneven, falling away on the river face in conglomerated cliffs about 100 ft. high, the foot of which is washed by the river when in flood. On the left bank these cliffs do not extend beyond the town but they are found again on the right bank a short distance upstream. Arriving from the east, the town has an extended MC164CGS42 appearance, being drawn out along the river bank to a length of about 1^ miles, with a depth inland of about f of a. mile. The houses are closely packed, mostly of two storeys, with flat roofs and many of them are provided with sardabs, z.e., underground cellars. Many are of brick and well built. The streets are narrow and crooked, with gutters neither paved nor cobbled running down the centre of them; raised sidepaths, about 18 inches wide, for foot passengers run along the edges. The town has a reputation, and rightly too, as being the filthiest in the universe. In many places on the west side of the town the houses are built on the face of the precipitous cliff, the foundations of the lowest being on a level with the water’s edge, or are built in tiers up from the river bed. Several steep paths lead down from the streets to the river. In the outskirts of the town the houses are mostly in ruins. There are 45 mosques and 24 shrines, some of which are 6 Imamzadehs’ (tombs of saints) and some ‘ Kadam- gahs 5 (sanctuaries). The shrines are said to be still used as places of c Bast ’ £*.e., places of safety from their enemies. A canal, called Qanat-i-Gavdul, takes off from the left bank of the river between a suburb called Ruband, on the left bank of the river above the town, where is situated the most important Imam- zadeh of Sultan Hussain, and the main town. Towards the southern extremity of the town the river is spanned by an ancient bridge of the Sassanian period, 430 yards in length, and built on 24 pointed arches resting on piers. The latter are of large blocks of cut stone ; the superstructure being of brick, with a road for the most part about 16 feet wide and roughly cobbled. Several of the arches have been swept away but during the war the Persian Government with the assistance of a loan from the British Government repaired the bridge and built a suspension bridge in that part where the arches were broken. The bridge should be capable of bearing all arms, though unless a previous examination were made, it would be advisable to keep as little traffic as possible on the bridge at one time. About 400 yards above the bridge a line of mills, 39 in number, run into the river at right angles from the left bank. They are built upon rocks assisted by artificial dams and are connected with each other in some instances by gangways and are all liable t be submerged in the spring floods, though in the low water season only 20 of them are able to be used. Under the bridge itself are a further 15 mills which used to be close to theright bank. These were destroyed in 1916, when the bridge was repaired, but more mills have since been built under the bridge and by the left bank. Below the bridge 40 more mills are to be found. A permanent canal, known as the Nahr-i-Kilmilak leaves the river on the east batik below the bridge. (Outside the town are 40 brick kilns, the price of bricks today being 40 krans per thousand.) The only edifice on the right bank of the river is the palace of Kushk of the Persian Governor-General of ’Arabistan. It is of modem construction and consists of a rectangular enclosure 500 feet by 300 feet, in which are several buildings. The high enclosing wall is of brick and has no pretensions as a citadel. The ground about here affords the best camping-ground, of an area practically unlimited. The aerodrome is situated here wde Chapter VIII. At the present time the palace is inhabited by Sagwand suwars, a bodyguard of the Governor-General ■ the number of these suwars is at present 70. (b) Inhabitants.—The population of Dizful is estimated at between 50,000 and 60,000. It has absorbed many heteroge neous elements and some of the groups into which the inhabitants are formed, bear names' indicative of foreign origin JXev the]ess, they have now become fused in one common communitv and homogeneity of language, customs and dress and mav he said to constitute a type of their own. No Lurs, Kurds or Arnhc reside within the town. The most prominent sections of the in habitants are the Sayids, numbering some 15,000 : the merchant who are 500 households; the Mashaikh, or under priests the wear white turbans in contrast to the Sayids, who wear black and number some 250 houses ; and the Khavanin, or notables of whom there are some 100 families. The lower orders belomT/o » poor type; they are dirty, discontented, unhealthy and ill favoured m appearance ; many of the better classes are resnect- able and well mannered. The only religion is the Shi’eh fm'+h m its standard form, and there are no Babis or ’Ali Uah7« or- avowed infidels. Although bigotted and fanatical in reeard to their particular form of religion, they show no signs of hostilitv towaras strangers—in somewhat marked contradistinction to the attitude of the inhabitants of Shushtar. Though Dizful ic directly under the rule of the Governor-General of ’ Arabistan nr his deputy Governor, when the former resides in Shushtar th* real control of the town is in the hands of the Sayids of whom th«44 5 - ■ two most important of the present day (1923) are Shaikh Haji Muhammad ar Ridha and Shaikh Muhammad Baqir. (Chapter VII). (c) Municipality .—Dizful town is divided into two large mahallas and these again are sub-divided. The two mahallas are Haidari under Imad-i-Daftar constituting the north part of the town and Na’amati under Quteb-i-Sadat the south part of the town. The municipality is under a Rais Baladiyah, ’Agha Hussain, son of Imam-i-Daftar, but owing to lack of funds the municipality has at present ceased to work. {d) Water .—The water supply is un-limited, and is used not only for domestic purposes, but is also taken off by qanats or subterranean conduits on both banks of the town. There are no pipes in the town nor any system of purifying the water, but the water if taken from the right bank or from mid-stream along side the mills is drinkable. Regarding further supplies, vide .Chapter IV. f'(e) Administration .—Dizful town is the headquarters of the /district of the same name. A deputy-Govemor, directly res ponsible to the Governor-General of ’Arabistan, lives in the town itself. There is a judicial department recognised by the Persian Government and a small police force for the preservation of law and order in the town itself. The control however of the town, as mentioned above, is almost entirely in the hands of the priests. (2) SHUSHTAR,— Lat. 23*3. Long. 48-53. Elev. 400. / * (a^Omeral description .—The official capital of 5 Arabistan is situated at the northern extremity of the Mianab in the angle formed by the division of the Karun into its branches of the Shatait and Gargar. The city stands on somewhat elevated ground, in part the ordinary alluvial soil of the country and in part the ruins and rubbish heaps of ages. Except for that part of the ground which runs up to a sandstone cliff 100 feet high and on which stands the citadel, the left bank of the Shatait near the town is low and usually has a long, shelving beach of shingle. There were formerly three exits from the town. The first to the west over the Pul-i-Dizful is interrupted owing to the bridge being broken down in the middle, and its place has been taken by a kallak ferry: the second is by the Pul-i-Lashkar into theMianab : the third over the dam by the Pul-i-Bulaiti to the east and connecting with a village of the same name, which is virtually a suburb of the city. The houses of Shushtar, though of some height and architec tural pretensions, are mostly old and in bad repair, while some parts of the town are in ruins and deserted. The majority of the houses are provided with sub-terranean chambers. There is no sanitation in the town. In the bazaar, which was greatly im proved in 1920, there are 440 shops. There are also 380 shops scattered over the town. The permanent shops are mostly located in the street leading through the centre of the town on the Pul-i-Bulaiti. Two caravan serais have lately been built containing 21 shops and 21 rooms for merchants. This brings the number of caravanserais up to 6. There are 12 baths and 6 coffee shops. There is one bank, the Imperial Bank of Persia under a British Manager. The bank is used to a very large extent by the merchants. There are some 50 4 Imamzadehs 5 and 30 4 kadamgahs’). (6) Camping grounds .—A camping ground of some 6 acres is available when not under cultivation on the south side of the arsenal. The recognised camping ground, however, is just below the Pul-i-Qaisari and close to the aerodrome. For any other camping grounds it would be necessary to cross to the right bank of the Shatait, where there is ample room for any numbers. (c) Inhabitants .—-The present population of Shushtar is about 20,000. The great bulk of the inhabitants are of an indi genous type, commonly supposed to be Assyrian, but of a mixed origin and are generally called Shushtaris. They speak a Persian patois resembling but distinguishable from that of the Dizfulis. They are Shi’ahs : their most prominent sections are the Sayids, Mashaikh, Khawanin and merchants. The town itself contains no Arabs but a few Bakhtriatis. A very great number of Shushtaris are employed by the A. P. O. C. in the Maidan-i- Naftun oil fields. In recent years the temperament, and indeed whole policy of Shushtar, has been governed by the hated Kalantar family, who though so generally disliked are powerful enough to influence the population. The Kalantar outbreak, as it is known, occurred in November 1917, when Haji Sayid Abdullah, Imam Jumah of Shushtar, was murdered, as the result of a plot on the part of the MC164CGSKalantar family. This however was not the first disturbance caused by this family. Five times in the past 40 years they had risen in defiance of the Persian Government and four times the Shaikh of Muhammarah had punished them but they retained their rich estates and rebuilt and fortified their houses. But on this outbreak in 1917 British cavalry were despatched from Shush and though the ringleaders remained at large several captures were made and the following men were deported; — Qazim Daoud, the murderer of Shaikh Murteza, his brother Hasan Daoud, Abdak Dizfuli and Mukaram Dizfuli, both noted desperados and murderers. Of other members of the family, the most influential is Sayid Amir Khan, who at the time of the outbreak was at Teheran and not implicated : Muhammad Haji Gholami or Abdul Muhammad Baqqal, who was the originator of the plot and fled to Ahwaz and thence to Ram Hormuz: Baqir Khan and his brother Sayid Azizullah, who were then prisoners of war in India: and Muhammad Shah, who is the head of the Kalantar family at Shushtar and raised his quarter of the town to rebel and endeavoured to raise others to attack the consulate. The family owned extensive property in Shushtar district and it was recognised by the British Government that the only remedy to their opposition to peaceful administration was to confiscate their property and sever their connection with Arabis- tan. This request was therefore made to the Persian Govern ment and their property was confiscated in October 1920. The Kalantar property may be placed under three headings. (1) Daimchah estate. (2) Small estates in Mianab and near the town. (3) House property in Shushtar. Of these Daimchah estate and a block of 9 houses were handed back by Muayyid al Dowlah, the late Governor-General of ’Arabistan, who had he remained in power might have caused the return of all Kalantars to Shushtar. Fortunately in October 1922 he was superseded by another Governor-General, who is averse to the return of the family. The question remains unsettled, but there is no doubt that the return of the Kalantar family to Shushtar means the end of law' and order; they are hated but they are feared. (d) Municipality .—The condition of the municipality is at present better than that of Dizful, a particular effort being nowmade to clean the town. The town itself is divided into 14 mahallah, each of which is under a Rais. These mahallas used continually to be fighting, but since the departure of the Kalantar family there has been complete peace between them. A police force of 1 officer, 6 inspectors and 30 men is kept for the preser vation of law and order in the town, whilst in addition there is an Aminiyah , or safety department, consisting of 50 sowars ; these howe /er are chiefly used as escorts for caravans proceeding R) Dizful, Shush, Ranci-i-Qir and other places. There is a revenue department, which collects land revenue in kind and cash and other taxes, also a telegraph and post office, both of which are now flourishing. The Customs department has little or no work, all goods being declared at Ahwaz. There are two schools in the town, in which more interest is being taken than in previous years, and particularly in the Madrasa-i-Ahmadiyah or Govern ment school, which is subsidised by the Government and under the supervision of the departments of Muarif and ’Auqaf: there are about 150 children in this school. The second school or Madrasa-i-Ilmiyah, which belongs to the priests and is subsidised by the merchants and landowners is merely used for teaching religion, Arabic and Persian. An opium department has been formed, which levies a tax on the sale of opium, in order to check the excess use of opium. There is now very little sale of opium owing to the prohibitive price but a considerable amount of smuggling irom Khurramabad is still being carried on. (e) Watef. The water supply is naturally unlimited, all water being drawn direct from the river. The water is good but should be boiled or chlorinated, especially if drawn from the town side of the river. (/) h&amp;hgious influence. As in Bizful religion has a great hold on the towns people. Sayids and priests interfere particularly m civil cases ; their power in secular affairs has grown consider ably since the departure of the Political and Civil courts, though the minor priests through their inability to assist without accept- mg bribes are beginning to lose their influence. The most im- portant religious heads in the town are; 1. Haji Sayid Muhammad al Abdullah Bannu. A sounc man, who neither interferes in matters not concerning him, noi tabes bribes. He is regarded by the Shushtaris as a saint.48 2. Haji Shaikh Muhammad Kazim ibn Shaikh Muhammad ’Ali and grandson of Shaikh Jaffar, a priest famous throughout the whole of Persia. He is the Head priest, an influential man and one who can be considered sound in comparison with others. 3. Haji Sayid Mahdi ibn Haji Abdul Samad. The greatest landowner in Shushtar. His father was influential until banished from Shushtar by the Kalantar family. He returned however in 1919. (g) Administration.—The town is administered by a deputy Governor, directly responsible to the Governor-General, who generally resides in Shushtar. He is also responsible for the district. As however pointed out above the administration of the town is generally either in the hands of the Kalantar family of the Sayids. Regarding the administration of the district vide Chapter IX. (3) BANDAR NASIRI, or NlSIRlYAH. {a) General description.—A much grown town in recent years owing chiefly to its position on the Karun and at the termina tion of the Isfahan caravan route. The colony of A. P. 0. C which of late years has settled in the town, has undoubtedly done much towards its growth. The town is situated on the left bank of the Karun immediately below the Ahwaz rapids and about 1 mile from Ahwaz town. It stands upon a slight elevation overlooking the river, and contains (1923) 1,200 houses caa 8 ^ 116 ’ brl ^ arid “ lld ’, 5 caravanserais, 6 baths, 5 mosques, 600 shops and two coffee shops. There are in addition 3 places 2 of which belong to the fehaikn of Muhammarah and 1 to his son Abdul Hamid, Governor of NasirJ. There is an English and Persian post and telegraph office. During the war there was a flying bridge at Ahwaz ; this has since been removed and the only ferry across the river consists of 4 bellams at Nasiri There are 4 mills 1 mile north of Ahwaz. In the town itself are two bazaars, one belonging to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and the other to Mu m al Tujjar, who also owns one of the flve oCed by HajVRais. ^ ^ ““ *» being (b) Inhabitants. -The population of Nasiri is estimated at 7,000 ; it is mixed and consists of Shushtaris, Isfahani , Dizfulis Bushins, Arabs and Lurs. The town being immediately undS the power of the Shaikh differs from Dizful and Shushtar in ?hat49 the religious heads have no control over the people. The most important of these is Sayid Ja’far ibn Haji Sayid Abdul Samad r who has good influence and is a friend of the British and the Shaikh but any power that he might wield is kept in check through fear of the Shaikh. (c) Camping grounds .—There is ample camping ground on the right bank opposite the bazaar for any number of troops. Troops were encamped here during the war and a few temporary buildings are still standing. On the left bank camping grounds can be found either in the desert outside Nasirt or better on the river bank upstream of Ahwaz, 2b to 3 miles from Nasirl. (d) Water .—Water must be taken from the Karun. The water is sweet. (e) Transport .—In addition to the A. P. O. C. river steamers running between Ahwaz and Muhammarah Messrs. Lynch &amp; Coy., run one steamer, S. S. Malamir, when occasion demands and Muin al Tujjar the S. S. Aasrat. There are also 10 local motor boats. The A. P. 0. 0. run boats between Ahwaz and Darakhazinah, 50 miles north of Ahwaz. Regarding land transport besides the cars of the A. P. O. C. local cars ply between Nasiri and Muhammarah, Dizful, Shushtar, Ram Hormuz. Of these there are nine in all. The Nasirl-Ahwaz tramway line is used for the purpose of conveying cargo past the rapids, which lie between Ahwaz and Nasiri, vide Karun River. This line which was originally constructed for a horse tram way is now also used for a light steam railway by the A. P. O. C. It has a total length of about 2,500 yards with a gauge of 3 ft. For further details vide Persian Gazetteer. (/) Administration .—The Shaikh of Muhammarah’s second son, Shaikh Abdul Hamid,* controls the town. The Shaikh himself has in recent years spent a great deal of his time at Nasiri. The population is quiet and easily ruled. (4) AHWAZ. Ahwaz itself is no more than a large village of some 1,000 souls, situated immediately upstream of Bandar Nasiri. Ahwaz is the older of the two towns and the district is named after it, but owing to its position above the rapids it has lost its former importance and the larger and still growing town of Nasiri has taken its place. Nasiri however is nearly always referred to by the British as Ahwaz, but the Arab invariably calls the two MC164CGS tt50 towns by their correct names. In the town there are some 250 houses of mud. (b) Inhabitants .—-The population is about LOGO; most of them are Arabs of mixed tribes, but there are some Persians. The majority are engaged in agriculture, but about 150 mules are owned by them. (c) Transport —To Ahw r az belong 60 boats of 10 to 15 tons burden. Messrs. Lynch brothers also own 2 steamers and 4 barges, which ply between Ahwaz and Darakhazinah or Shilaiii, 7 or 8 miles below Shushtar. A steamer from Ahwaz to Shilaiii takes two to three days and downstream 1 day. The native boats, which can be, and are., towed up the rapids when necessary, drop down the river without the help of sails from Shilaiii on the Gargar to Ahwaz in 3 days, and from Ahwaz to Muhammarah in from 4 to 6 days. For other details of Ahwaz, vide Bundar Nasiri. (5) HAWIZAH. General description. A once prosperous town in Southern Arabistan, situated about 40 miles west by north of Nasiri an in the centre of the Hawizah, district of which it is the capi al. Formerly a large town, it was ruined in 1837 by the bursting of the dam at Nahr Hashim on the Karkheh river which upset the whole irrigation system of the district caused and^dr t ^ t0 ^ ' m ° re northe ^ course reduced he town, which stood on the left bank of its former bed to comparative insignificance. At the present time the own has a river front of only 300 to 400 yards in lengthThough rapidhTfalW Tto ' ° r 8 °T di8tance - The whol e town °i S ulihabited FvtnT 118 and a -mber of existing houses are unmnaDited. liven during the past twenty five ve ,™ it i« XrLfrsf ^ ha ? though there ere stffl'eomeYoS^nTelTaTr 6 wScJIs in the district being the market toA rtoSs'' ,m!&gt;0rtan0,J »o l iiV*X'jh OP th 1 ‘ i ° n »t about 700 Sabians. The chief man ‘f th. 8 ,''^^ ° a Cew °&lt; cmet man of the town is Shaikh Molah. He hasno claim for comment except that his knowledge of smuggling krans and rifles into ’Iraq possibly exceeds that of most other chiefs. # (c) Water .—The water of Hawdzah is both bad and scanty. Itjs however reported that water can always be obtained by digging wells in the old bed of the Karkheh, both at Hawizah and en route from Aminiyah, opposite Bandar Nasirl, and Hawizeh. (d) Camping grounds .—There is ample camping ground south to south west of Hawizah close to the Aminiyah-Hawizah road before the town is reached. There is no other camping ground. (e) Administration .—Though Hawizah is under the direct control of Shaikh Molah, he is himself responsible to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. ( 6 ) RAMUZ, on RAM HORMUZ.— Lat. 31*10. Long. 49 * 48 (a) General description —Also called Suq Ram Hormuz, is the chief town in the district of the same name. It stands 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of the Ramuz river about 12 miles above its junction with the Kurdistan river, and is situated about 48 miles due east of, and 60 miles by road from Ahwaz. The hills of the Bakhnarl country begin from 2 to 3 miles north of the town. Ramuz is a thriving place, its position, at a point where several rivers meet and at the foot of a gorge leading through the mountains to Shiraz, making it naturally a place of importance. It consists of about 800 houses, most of these are of mud, but a few are of brick and plaster. There are about 250 shops, partly collected in a vaulted bazaar, 100 yards in length partly scattered through the town, and partly in a new bazaar built about 7 years ago. In addition to the usual sup plies available in the native bazaars saddlery is sold to a great extent, whilst Messrs. Lynch &amp; Bros, agent, at present Sultan Muhammad, sells iron and sugar. There is a Persian Govern ment Telegraph office to Nasiri on the one side and to Behbehan on the other, the price of a telegram being J kran per word. There is no post office, all letters being sent with caravans. There used to be no Customs house, but in April 1922 an official was sent by the Persian Government. At first the people re fused to recognise him, but he is recognised now (1923) There is also one school ^52 (b) Inhabitants.— The population is estimated at 10,000 souls, and consists of a class of mixed origin chiefly Bakhtiaris, Behbehanis, Arabs and Persians, who are described as Ahl-al- Hamuz. The chief man of the town is Az zullah Khan, a Bakhtiari khan, who is deputy governor and agent for Sardar Iqbal, Munazim al Mulk and his brothers, sons of the late Siphadar, who bought the town from the Persian Government for 10,000 tumans. Azizullah Khan is liked by the people. Owing to Ramuz being little visited by British people it might be well to mention here other important people in the town, who would assist if necessary. (1) Haji Muhammad, the biggest merchant in the town and the most honest man. ‘ 2 ) Haji Say id Namatallah, agent of Messrs. Strict Scott &amp; Co. (3) Sultan Muhammad, agent of Messrs. Lynch Bros. ( 4 ) His brother. Other persons of importance are Mirza Gull Muhammad Khan, Masih Khan and Madtsty Hasan, who are in charge of the surrounding suburbs. (c) Camping grounds .—Owing to extensive cultivation in the vicinity there is little space available for a camp within a radius of 3 miles ; the most suitable ground is between the hills and the north side of the town close to the Imamzadeh known as Pai Gach. (d) Water .—All water comes from the Rud-i-Zard. In winter there is excess ; in summer the inhabitants fight for it and water has to be measured out to each village. This river water, however, which is fresh and sweet though muddy owing to irrigation shortly after it leaves the hills, is used by the inhabi tants almost solely for cultivation, chiefly rice. In the town itself there are wells, about 60 feet deep, in almost every house of any size. This water is fresh. There are no wells outside. If a camping ground is selected east of the Imamzadeh men tioned in the preceding paragraph water though muddy is avail able close by from the Rud-i-Zard.(e) Adminisiration. —The town being now the property of the Bakhtiari khans is entirely controlled by them or their agents. Three years ago a certain amount of revenue was paid to ’Arabistan but the town and district is gradually cutting itself more and more away from ’Arabistan and ruled by the Bakhtiari, who own much property in the neighbourhood as well as the town itself. The present chief, Azizullah Khan, is strict but does not tyrannise the people. No alcoholic drinking nor prostitutes are allowed and only 1 opium smoking den. As however in most native villages there is no attempt at sanita tion. (7) MUHAMMARAH. —Lat. 30*25*40. Long. 48*11*13. ’ . i {a) General Description .—The capital and most important town of bouthern Arabistan, and it may be described as the sole seaport and entrepot of foreign trade in all ’Arabistan. Mnhammarah stands on the right or north bank of the Haffar canal, a continuation of the Karun river. The native houses begin some 1J miles above the confluence of the Haffar and the Shatt-al-’Arab, and the frontage of the town extends upwards from that point, between which and the Shatt-al- ’Arab are the new offices and bungalows of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The town stands on alluvial soil, and the bank of the canal, which would be otherwise subject to erosion, is protected within the limits of the town by revetments of date logs laid horizontally, and forming quays and wharves. Muhammarah is shut in upon its upper side by the date plantations of Nahr biyab; on its lower side by those of H zan. These groves however are only J mile deep, and behind the town is an open’ treeless desert stretching away into the interior, no high ground being within sight of Muhammarah. This country is bounded on the east by the river Karun, on the west by the Shatt-al- Arab, and the south by the Haffar canal. The town, which is constantly increasing in size consists at present of about I 500 houses. Upon the river are some fine modern buddings ; among the most conspicuous are the offices and residential houses of the Anglo-Persia;!! Ofi Company, and the palatial mansion of aji luhammad Ah, Rais-ut-Tujjar. There are 8 mosques, d public baths and 4 main bazaars, the Shaikh Khaza’l bazaar which was widened and improved in 1921, the Suq-al-Shatt! Suq-al-Bedah (i.e„ piece goods), and the Suq-al-Khadarah (meat ba MCl64CGS e t0Wn ltSelf 18 divided into 4 quarters, Seef54 quarter, consisting of brick houses, Subba of mud huts and serifash, the Town, one-third of which are mud and two-thirds brick houses and Sabakh, in w'hich all houses are of mud. Two- thirds of the town belongs to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and one-third to Haji Rais. The state of the town in spite of its modem improvements is still highly insanitary, the only kind of drain being a channel cut down the centre of each street. In the town towards its eastern end are the residence of the Persian ‘Karguzar’ and the Telegraph office. Outlying appurtances of Muhammarah are the Customs jjqjiqq originally built as a Governor s palace at the mouth of the Karun upon its right bank, the quarantine station and the doctor’s quarters, which are a little further from its mouth on the left bank, and were constructed in the first place for artillery and infantry barracks respectively. The British Consulate stands on the right bank of the Haffar, and the British cemetry is some distance inland from the Con sulate, at the place where the date groves of Hizan give place to open country. The village of Kut-ush-Shaikh on ’Abadan island, opposite to the town is practically a suburb. (b) Water .—The water at Muhammarah is, of course, plentiful and good from the rivers, but is not to be obtained from wells, as the water found in them is salt and brackish. Water is also to be obtained from the various cuts and nallahs, but doubts are entertained as to its wholesomeness, owing to its flowing through the gate groves, where vegetable matter grows thick ly on the banks. The water from the Bahmanshir or Haffar should always be procured, if possible, for drinking, being supposed to be much more wholesome for drinking than that of the Shatt-al-’Arab ; while the creek or irrigation water should be avoided, being impregnated with the foul vegetable matter, through which it passes. (c) Inhabitants—The inhabitants of Muhammarah are chiefly local Arabs belonging to the Hilalat, Bait Chenan and Mutui divisions of the Muhaisin 5 but there are also numerous Arabs descended from Bahraini refugees, some natives of Dizful and Shushtar, a few merchants from other parts of Persia, about 100 families of Sabians and 300 families of Jews and Christians. Accommodation for travellers is afforded by 9 ‘ Husainiehs.’ These are buildings primarily set apart for the readings and55 lamentations, which are obligatory on Shi’ahs during the month of Muharram, and as refugees for destitute strangers and pil grims, but also serving as inns. There are numerous khans in Muhammarah, but these instead of being hostelries, as in Iraq, are merely places of business, or warehouses, where mer chants store their goods. Of the various ingredients that form the population of Muhammarah, the Bahrainis are mostly small shop-keepers and mechanics ; the Sabians are silversmiths; the Jews deal in Manchester goods ; and the Christians are clerks or lightermen. There are also 6 gunsmiths, who repair rifles and revolvers, the most prominent of these being Haji ’Abbas and rlaji Kadhin. (d) Foreign Trade .—Details of foreign trade with Muham marah are mentioned in Chapter IV, but owing to its functions as a port its connec tion with foreign trade must not be omitted here. Of the foreign trade nominally belonging to Muham marah, by far the greater part really depends on places upon the Karim and up-country. The town is accessible to ocean going steamers, but owing to the narrowness of the Karim and the consequent difficulty of swinging, they discharge their cargoes opposite the village of Ma’muri without leaving the Shatt-al-’Arab. Cargoes, etc., are transhipped at Muhammarah to the river steamers and conveyed thus to Nasiri. Muham marah is the port of supply for the whole province of’Arabistan and to a very large extent the province of Isfahan and the Bakhtiari country as regards imported goods ; it is also the port of shipment of goods from the interior of Persia. (e) Administration .—The town is nominally governed by a deputy of the Shaikh, called the Naib-al-Hukumeh, though that position is at present vacant owing to the incapability of the last two deputy governors, who were removed by the Shaikh, and the government is in the hands of the Rais-al-Tuj jar. The Shaikh has a hoshiyah, or personal guard, of 120 ghulam, whilst for the preservation of law and order in the town there exists a police force of four officers and ninety men under ’Azi Deen. (/) Camping grounds .—There is ample space for camping grounds in the desert behind and close to the town.56 (8) HINDlAN— Lat. 30* 14*24. Long. 49*43’ 5. General Description.—A town on both banks of the Hindian river, at a point 16 miles north-west of its mouth. The town is mostly in ruins, and the population numbers about 1,000. Hindian is one of the two depots, the other being Dilam, for the Behbehan line of trade. Baghalahs come here from Bushire, Bahrain, Lingeh and Kuwait. Grain, live sheep and wool are exported, also oak bark, sesame and ghi. ( 6 ) Inhabitants .—The inhabitants consist of Qanawatis, sections of Bani Tamim, which migrated here from the Karim district and Cha’b. The people are cultivators of grain, boat men and traders and possess a considerable number of sheep and cattle and a few horses. (c) Water .—It is said that the water of the river is scarcely drinkable in February, being tainted in passing through the low hills south of Zaidan. In September it is reported sweet and clear. (d) Administration. —The town is under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, whose representative, now Haji Rashid ibn Haji Rais-al-Tujjar, is resident there. The town contains a post of the Persian Imperial Customs; there is no telegraph, but communication is maintained with Behbehan and Bushire by the Persian Post Office. (9) FALLAHIYAH.—Lat. 30-40-N. Long. 48-41-E. {a) General Description .—The chief town of the district of the same name, the capital of the Cha’b tribe and the most unhealthy town in ^Arabistan. It is almost buried from view in date groves, and is situated on both banks of the Fallahiyah- . and canal about 3 miles below Khazinah, where the Jarrahi river ends and the canal begins. The part of the town on the left bank is surrounded by a dilapidated stone wall, which encloses as well as houses a large amount of marsh. About o0 mud houses and 130 shops compose the town. (&amp;) (&amp;) Inhabitants.-Mmtly Cha’b of the Khanafirah division and number about 2 , 000 . omsion (c) A dm inisfrat ion. —The town is governed by ’Abud ibn uwaiyi , c ief 0 f the Khanafirah division of the Cha’b and recognised chief of the Cha’b tribe He acts ilC ! f. d of the Shaikh of Muhammarah. ' h re F resentatlve57 (d) Produce. —The town land produces abundant d^tes and rice, but trade is slack. (e) Movement. —Movement is chiefly by water and the town possesses many bellams. Mahilahs also come up from Muham- marah by the canal, and there is a good water way leading to Buzieh. (10) BANDAR MA’SHUR. Lat. 30° 34' 28'. Long. 49° 11 ' 28'. General description. —The village of Ma’shur, generally called Bandar, is situated about a mile north of the inland termina tion of the Hor Ma’shur branch of the Hor Musa. Accord ing to local tradition, the original village of Ma’shur, was situat ed at a place called Tall Kafiran, which seems to be on the south east bank of the Hor Ma’shur, about 3 miles from its head. Ma’shur village stands upon a mound, which has the appear ance of being artificial but in all probability consists merely of the debris of a long inhabited site. A ruined c burj ’ domi nates the place; and there are three mosques, of which the best was built in the present generation by one Haji Nasir, a mer chant of the place. The houses are of the type usual in this part of Persia ; they are of mud with mud roofs and each of them encloses its own courtyard. Around the village outside are scattered the roofless mud walls of diminutive huts, which are occupied during the wheat harvest when the grain is heaped up outside the village. Sanitation is disregarded. ( 6 ) Water. —Drinking water is largely drawn from a stag nant pool, the same as that in which clothes are washed. Rain water is collected on the east side of the town by an embank- • ment faced with brick, built about 20 years ago by Haji Nasir ; on the open tank thus formed the inhabitants depend for 8 months of the year for all purposes; during the remaining 4 months they drink from wells, of which there are many small ones in the town. There is also to the west of the town an underground cistern, which holds excellent water : the entrance is kept locked during the winter. The fact that the live-stock of Ma’shur is not sent elsewhere in the hot weather points to the fact that the water supply is in no way deficient, but the well- water at least is brackish and unhealthy. (c) Inhabitants. —The population of Ma’shur village is about 1,500 souls ; as a whole the people are healthy and well-favoured , MC164CGS * a58 in appearance. Half of them are Bandaris or Bandarieh, whose origin is unknown even to themselves, though it is possible that they are connected with the Bandariyah section of the Cha’b tribe, and the remainder are Qanawatis from Behbehan. The entire community is bi-lingual speaking both Arabic and Persian. (d) Administration .—The town is controlled by the Shaikh of Muhammarah, whose influence at Ma shur is supreiaae. and undisputed, through his agent Haji Rashid ibn Haji Rais-al- Tujjar, who also controls Hindian. There is no telegraph office, but a post office exists which is managed by the Customs and maintains a weekly service to Muhammarah, Hindian and Bushire. Villages. General .—The above are the principal towns of the districts in ’Arabistan. A few of the more important villages are record ed below, but the remainder which are so numerous that there is no space for them in this report are to be found in the Gaze- teer of Persia. These villages are merely the habitats of the sections and parts of sections of the tribes, as detailed in Chap ter VI, and are of little or no military importance. It may however be worthy of mention here that all villages, no matter how small, in Northern ’Arabistan are guarded by a fort built in their midst. (1) BAND-I-QIR. Lat. 31° 39'. Long. 44° 55'. Elev. 300'? . A small village situated at the southern apex of the Mianab between the Gargar and the Shatait branches of the Karun, just above their junction. The river .Diz also joins the Karun here. It contains some 40 mud houses and its inhabitants are ’Ana- fijah, who cultivate wheat and barley and own a few mules and donkeys. Immediately below the village stand the barracks used by British troops during the war, whilst a few hundred yards upstream of the village exists the bridge (mentioned earlier in this chapter under the heading bridges). The banks here which stand about 18 feet above the Gargar at low water, are overflowed in floods. The name Band-i-Qir is derived from a dyke, whose stones were fastened together by &lt; qir , 5 i.e., bitumen. This dyke is59 said to have been made by Darius. It raises the water of tha Gargar, here 50 yards and very deep for irrigating the country. South of Batid-i-Qir, as far as Wais, napthah is found in the neighbourhood. (2) BAR AIM. Lat. 30° 20' SO'-N. Long. 48° 16'-E. A small village on the west coast of ’Abadan island and unimportant except for the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company built their refinery here, thus increasing the size of the pi ce and population. About 200 huts of the Thawamir section of the Mu ha i sin tribe are found at Baraim. There is naturally now a large colony of British and other nationalities. (3) BUNVARJ Lat. 32° 25'-N. Long. 48° 22'-E. A group of villages in the Dizful district, beginning about 6 miles west of Dizful town on the road to Pa-i-Pul and ’Amarah. The villages stand on level ground on the right bank of the Bala Rud, and each is surrounded by trees ; the principal are Ban- war Nasir, Dubandar Mian Chughan, Kaleh-i-Haji ’AH and Kaleh Nau. The population is mixed, part being Dizfulis, part Arabs, part Sagwand Lurs and part a Kurdish section called ’Amaleh Karim Khan ; their numbers are estimated at about 3,000, but owing to these miscellaneous ingredients having not yet become properly fused they cannot be reckoned as a force of any combination or strength. All are engaged in pastoral or agricultural occupations. They own large flocks of sheep and herds of buffaloes and cattle, and dispose of the produce in Dizful town ; they grow wheat, rice, millet and mash, besides fruits, including apricots, pomegranates, grapes, oranges limes and dates ; they also supply Dizful town with firewood from the Karkheh. Water is abundant and is brought from the Diz by a small canal, which takes off on the right bank at the Dizful bridge ; the Bala Rud, when in flood, adds its quota to the irrigation of the village lands, and a large canal from the Karkheh, called the Harmushi, brings water close up to the settlement. Food and forage are plentiful, and about 300 to 400 mules are owned here. The inhabitants, though they shelter themselves behind the name of the Wali of Pusht-i- Kuh, suffer much from depredations of the Sagwand Lurs as well as of the Khazraj and Chenanah sections of the Bani Lam.60 (4) BUZIEH or BIZIYEH or BUZL The largest town in the Fallahiyah district, moie populous than the capital Fallahiyah, from which it is distant 3 miles westwards. It is situated on both banks of the Hor Dauraq within a mile of its head, 2 miles south of the end of the Jarrahi river at Khazineh, and at a distance of about 30 miles via Hor Dauraq from Hor Musa, but it is accessible to sea-going craft up to 150 tons. At Buzieh the creek is wide enough for two fair sized craft to pass one another at high tide, and it is spanned by a narrow wnoden bridge, 60 feet in length, wnich connects the two parts of the town. At Buzieh the water of the Hor Dauraq is drinkable, but only when the sea ebbs. The Khuli and Buzieh canals from the Jarrahi river pass the town at a distance of a few hundred yards on the east and west side respectively. The actual village is small, consisting of about 30 shops on the west bank of the creek; the remainder of the settlement is scattered among interminable date groves and water courses. The population is estimated at about 8,000, almost all of whom are Cha’b Arabs from the Albu Ghubaish section, their chief Da’ikh ibn Buchai having his headquarters at Buzieh. Buzieh is the only port and the chief centre of trade of the Fallahiyah district. Cargo brought to the port by native boats is discharged at Buzieh and transferred to small bellams on a canal 200 yards away, whence there is direct communication by water all the year round with Khalfabad * direct communica tion wdth Fallahiyah by water, and between Fallahiyah and Khalfabad by water is only possible during spring and early summer, when there is sufficient water for boats to surmount the dam at Khazinah. The principal exports of Buzieh are dates, rice, wheat, barley, matting, palm leaves, melions and a little wool. The town is subject to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. The Imperial Customs have a post here and there is also a Persian Post Office. (5) CHAM-US-SABI. Lat. 30° 58'-N. Long. 49° ST'-E. A village situated on the right bank of the river Jarrahi, but separated from it by a few hundred yards of low lying groen , a little below the point where the river emerges from a ow range of hhls. The village is 24J miles from Ramuz town on the route to Bandar Ma’shur. An old disused canal of con siderable size takes off from the right bank of the river about61 1 mile above the village, and after passing a large flat-topped mound, which seems to be an ancient site, cuts through a low ridge, and can be traced beyond this for many miles running nearly parallel to the river. At Cham-us-Sabi there are about 15 permanent habitations, mud houses, and in winter a large encampment of about 200 tents of Arabs of the Bani Khalid section of the Bawieh. The low land is habitually cultivated. The village is the property of the Mzam-us-Sultaneh but is farmed out to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. ( 6 ) DEH MULLA.— Lat. 30 o 30' N. Long. 49°42' E. A village in the Hindian district and the most important place in the district after Hindian town. It stands on the right bank of the Hindian river, about 17 miles north of Hindian town. The inhabitants are half Cha’b and half Qanawati from Behbehan and number about 700 souls. L Heli Mulla is the centre of a wool raising tract, which is said to yield 10,000 tumans—shearings per annum; a royalty is collected by an agent, whom the Shaikh of Muhammarah main tains here. There are some old guns at Heh Mulla and some ruins on the opposite bank of the river, J mile further up, which are perhaps remains of Portugese occupation. (7) EAILIEH. —Lat. 30°28' N. Long. 48 0 3' E. A village situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, 3 miles above Muhammarah, between the Shatt-al-Arab and the Abu Jidi canal. Eailieh owes its importance to its being the headquarters of the Shaikh of Muhammarah’s administration, wTiere are the offices of his government and where is quartered his mercenary force of some 400 armed Arabs and Baluchis. The village has a small quay of date logs in the angle between the rivers, and about a mile up the Abu Jidi canal is a small dock in which the Shaikh’s steamers are repaired. The village itself consists of about 300 brick, reed and mud huts, with some 20 shops and 2 coffee shops. The inhabitants are Muhaisin and mixed Arabs. Baluchis and Negroes. The principal buildings, however, are two palaces, which are still occupied by part of the household of the Shaikh, though he himself now r resides in an imposing wmmmansion called Qasr-i-Khaz’alieh, three quarters of a mue farther up the same bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab. Faiheh was loured about 1860 by Haji Jabir, father of the Shaikh and the first great shaikh of the Muhaisin. The Shaikh keeps at Failieh 9 guns in a specially made gun- room with 2 machine guns outside the gun-room and 8 more machine guns in the castle. In the river lie 2 river steamers, previously hospital ships used by the British during the war and now used by the Shaikh on his tours to Basrah, and one sea- fprino* shin, the ‘ Ivv,’ on which he makes his periodical visits to Kuwait. (8) Gutwand.—A village in Northern Arabistan on the right bank of the river Karim, about 12 miles west by north of Shush- tar, and 5 miles from the village of Ab-i-Bid. With the sur rounding country, on both sides of the Karun, it is owned by the Bakhtiari Khans. Gutwand marks the limit of the depreda tions of the Dirakwand Lurs who plundered it about 1902 ; in the following year the Bakhtiaris retaliated by a raid on Qir Ab, in which they succeeded in killing and capturing a number of Dirakwands. Gutwand is a village of some 400 mud houses, chiefly built in large mud compounds, the inhabitants of which are Haft Lang Bakhtiaris. There are said to be some 1,500 rifles stored in the village. The present headmen of the village are ’Amanillah Qalai ’Asad, Haji Zohrab and Haji Tsa. The village lies on the motor road between Dizful and Shushtar, vide Chapter VI, Route 14. (9) JANJIREH—Lvr. 30 o 42 / N. Long. 48 0 52' E. A large village or group of settlements in the Fallahiyah dis trict, situated at some distance from the left bank of the Jar- rahi river below the head of the Janjireh canal and above that of the Kulfi. It is thus a little to the south of Umm-us-Sakhar, and only a mile or two from the place where the Jarrahi river is finally broken up into canals. Winding paths connect it with Buzieh, between the same two canals, and with Fallahiyah town, which is about 9 miles to the west. The heads of the prin cipal canal in the district are commanded at Janjireh, and it has been poin ed out that the place is one of which occupation would be obligatory in case of military operations in the district. Janjireh has some date groves, but stands in otherwise open« 63 country. The inhabitants are of the Dris and Albu Ghubaish divisions of the Cha’b al Gubban tribe. ( 10) KAUNAK OR KAHUNAK— Lat. 32 0 W N. Long. 48°39 / Elev. 600. A village in the Dizful district, situated on the main caravan route from Dizful to Shushtar, about 16 miles s^uth east of Dizful and 22 miles north west of Shushtar. It is the ordinary halting place for travellers between these two places. Kaunak stands on the left bank of the stream of the same name, which is^an affluent of the Ab-i-Diz. The bed of tin Ab-i-Kaunak, at the village, is usually a dry or nearly a dry stretch of shingle about 1 mile across and presents a complete obstacle to motor transport, which are compelled to take the longer route via Gutwand, and a serious obstacle to all wheeled traffic, vide Chapter VI, Route 14. After moderate rains, however, there is a good flow of water in several distinct channels and heavy rains render it impassable for a short period. The village consists of about 100 mud houses, which are not surrounded by a wall as most villages in the Dizful district. A caravanserai stands about 200 yards north of the village ; it is a mud walled-in enclosure, but some of the interior buildings are of brick and there are a few small lodgings for better class tra vellers in a balakhaneh. The only defence of the village is a small mud tower with a timber roof, just outside it on the Dizful side, and a couple of two storeyed buildings in the town, which shew a few loopholes. The inhabitants are Bakhtiaris and a few Dizfulis, who are very poorly armed. Kaunak belongs to the Bakhtiari Khans and Agha ’Ali Mustaufi of Dizful. Rice, kunjid, mash, wheat, barley, beans and cotton are cultivated on the village lands, which are irrigated from the Ab-i-Kaunak. A canal runs out of the stream a few hundred yards above the village and reached a group of hamlets called Gumar, There is a fair supply of water at all seasons of the year but it is rather brackish, vide Chapter VI, Route 14. No transport is available at Kaunak except about 30 donkeys. Cattle number about 150 sheep and goats about 50. V- .. I . . , . ’ ’ . . • l There are four shrines close to the village, which are visited by the surr ounding Arabs as well as by Dizfulis and Shushtaris*64 ( 11 ) KHALFABAD.— Lat. 30 o 53'N. Long. 49°24'E rm. •„„; rv .,i village of the Jarrahi district, and the seat, alternately with Ma’shur, of the agent of the Shaikh of Muham- marah bv whom the district is governed. It stands on the left bank 0 f the Jarrahi towards the upper end of the district and 7 S below Cham-us-Sabi. The village consists of only about To mud huts; the inhabitants are mixed Arabs and Persians engaged in agriculture. Some fords cross the river near here and are practicable for laden animals durmg the greater part of the year. o -n. (12) MAMUHIYAH. —L at. 312 o 0 / N. Long. 49 32 E. A village in the Ramuz district on the left bank of the Gupal stream and 1 mile from the foot of the Gypsum hills 7 miles from Ramuz town on a bearing of 308 degrees from the west end of the same. There is a direct track from Mamuhiyah to Ramuz. The village consists of a few reed huts of Ahl-i-Ramuz and is surrounded by cultivation. A dilapidated shrine, adjoin ed by an enclosure containing 60 or 70 date palms and one or two kunar trees, stands J mile from Mamuhiyah on the side towards Ramuz town, and the trees form a good landmark. On the west side are encampments of the Zubaid section of A1 Khamis. Immediately below the Gypsum hills lies a rest house, belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, where provisions etc. could be stored, if necessary. The rest house lies on the motor road from Dar-i-Khazinah to Ramuz and about 1 mile from Mamuhiyah village. Water is plentiful. Camping ground is limited owing to cultivation, the most suitable site being at the foot of the hills and close to the rest house. (13) MIRBACHEH.— Lat. 38°15' N. Long. 49 0 28 / E. A village in the Ramuz district about 11 miles west by south of Ramuz town, on the main track from Nasiri to Ramuz. Mirbacheh stands on a mound about 80 feet high, ascended by steep narrow paths and crowned at the summit by a fort-like enclosure. On the north-east, east and south-east sides the village spreads downwards to the plain, and on the north, west and south it is surrounded by plantations of young date palms, while to the south-west there is a detached date-grove, and on that side a garden extends to a distance of about half a mile from the mound. In winter the surrounding plains are grassy. The salt Muwailheh stream passes about 2 miles to the west of the village, and at about a mile on the east side of Mirbacheh65 a stream of fresh water, 2 yards wide and 2 to 3 feet deep, is encountered, besides other smaller channels flowing to the north westwards. The ground on this side is boggy and treacherous The place consists of about 100 houses, the inhabitants pos sessing about 70 rifles. 8 po8 (14) SHAH ABUL SHAH.— Lat. (of tomb) 30 o 10'27'.

(2&gt; Kaleh-i-Dukhtar. —An ancient fort in Persia on the left bank of the Karun, at the point where it emerges from the moun tains into the plain of Aqili. It consists of a lofty detached rock, which rises abruptly from the river, and has been sur rounded and fortified to its very summit by great masses of stone, taken from the torrent and united with the most tenacious cement. (3) Shush. —The site and ruins of the ancient Susa in Northern ’Arabistan, vide Chapter I. It is situated on the left bank of the Shaur, 15 miles south-west of Dizful, The or ginal city covered the whole between the Shaur and Karkheh rivers, some 1| miles and beyond the latter. The mounds on the left bank of the Shaur cover a space of over 6 miles in circumference, and are in three concentric tiers. The uppermost tier or citadel, still known as the Kaleh Shush, is 120 feet high with a perimeter of 1,100 yards at the base and 850 yards at the summit. The second tier, representing the old palace, is some 70 feet high with a perimeter of some 2J miles. In 1916 during the war Shush played an important part chiefly as a defensive position with the power to hold in check the rebellious tribes of the surrounding district. From a military point of view Shush is an isolated hill surmounted by a fort, which could held out indefinitely against local levies unprovidedI 71 with lartillary. It is only three marches from Aminiyah (Ahwaz) with no river of any size intervening, vide Chapter VIII, whilst nearly all supplies could be obtained locally. At least a double company of infantry with all details could be garrisoned in the fort, and possibly a battalion, if sufficient supplies could be provided. POLITICAL DIVISIONS— Arabistan is divided into ten districts, the boundaries of which are given below. Other details concerning these districts will be found in the various chapters according to the nature of the information required. 5 (1) Dizful. With Shushtar forms the northern province of ’Arabistan. The northern boundary of this district will be found in the earlier pages of this chapter under the boundaries of Northern Province of Arabistan. The eastern boundary which is the division between Shushtar and Dizful districts is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kahunak in the north | through a point east of Kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south. The western boundary is the Traq-Persian Frontier, whilst the southern is the same as recorded for the northern boundary of thetAhwaz district. (2) Shushtar. For the northern boundary, vide boundary of Northern Arabistan. For the western boundary, vide Dizful. For the southern boundary, vide Ahwaz. For the eastern boundary, vide Pamuz. (3) Ramuz .—The Ramuz district is bounded along its north eastern side, beginning at some napthah springs, known as Naft-i-Safid, at its northern corner by the Kuh-i-Gach range, which reaches to the Ramuz river; its south-eastern corner is on the Marun river, above Jaizan, which is included in the districtj From Jaizan the boundary ruins at a short distance from the left bank of the Marun to a point Cham. Mani’ on the Jarrahi, 3 miles below the confluence of the Ramuz and Marun rivers. From Cham Mani 5 thence it is continued to the low, mud and rock hills through which the Jarrahi breaks above Cham Sabi, crosses the river and, following the same hills, arrives at a point on the Ramuz-Nasiri route on the eastern verge of the Buairish plain, and about 9 miles east of the village of Mirbacheh. The re mainder of the boundary is a line connecting Bu’airish with the napthah springs mentioned above; this line crosses the Gupal streams about 4 miles above the barrage on the same.72 tA (4) Bandar Mashur.-A village constituting with some snuare miles of the surrounding country, a small administrative district in Southern ’Arabistan. The limits of this tract sur rounding the village are not clearly defined but they may be taken to include the south-eastern bank of the Khur Ma shur, SO far as it consists of terra firma, and the north-western bank down, probably, to the month of the Khur Dauraq. . On the side towards Buzieh the limit of the Ma’shur territory is said to be at a spot called ’Aquleh, about 8 miles from the village. (5) Jarrahi .—The north-eastern most corner of the district is at the tomb of Shah Nabi, at the foot of some hills to the east of the river Jarrahi; thence the boundary runs west through the southern extremity of Cham Mani in the Ramuz district to a mound named Rumais. From Rumais it runs south to Qarqar village on the right bank of the Jarrahi river, crosses that river at Dub-al-Mir on the left bank and continues south for 5 miles; it then runs south-east to ’Acjuleh, about 8 miles west of Bandar Ma’shur, where it turns to the north-east: finally it passes through a large mound, named Radhwan, 8 miles east of Khal- fabad, and so returns, following a range of low hills to the point from which it started. (6) Fallahiyah .—The border of the district begins on the sea at the mouth of Khur Silaik and follows the creek to Qubban. Then the boundary is the Sulmanieh canal until some marshes are reached near the Karun ; it then runs more to the north than before and passes in succession by Maqtu’ and ’Ataishi to a locality named Khuwaiseh where there is some rising ground. The line then turns eastwards and goes by way of Qusaibeh, at the right bank of the Jarrahi river just below the village of Qarqar. Crossing the river it continues in a south-easterly and 'then in a southerly direction. It passes by ’Aquleh, a spot 8 miles west of Ma’shur, and finally reaches the Khur Musa near the point where that inlet breaks up into the two Khurs of Dauraq and Ma’shur. 7 (7) Hindian .—The Hindian district is enclosed on the south by the Persian Gulf, on the west by a 4 khait ’, or strip of slightly elevated land, which runs more or less parralel to the Hindian river about midway between it and Bandar Ma’shur ; on th@ north by a line traversing part of the Shah ? Nabi plain east wards to some hills, along which it continues to a point near73 Gargari, a distance in all of about 15 miles : on the east by a line which cuts obliquely across the maritime range from Gargari to a point on the coast between Shah Abul Shah and Bandar Dilam. (8) Muhammardh .—The Muhammarah district is bounded on the west by the frontier of ’Iraq: on the south by the Persian Gulf: on the east by the Pallahiyah district: and on the north by the Ahwaz district and farther west by the Hawizah district. (9) Ahwaz .—Ahwaz district reaches on the west almost to. the Karkheh river, meeting there the district of Hawizah. Om the south it is bounded by the districts of Muhammarah and Fallahiyah, on the south east by the district of Jarrahi, on the east by the district of Ramuz, on the north east by the Bakh- tiari country and on the north by the districts of Shushtar and Dizful. (10) Hawizah .—The westernmost, district of ’Arabistan. On its northern side it is bordered by two parallel ranges, called Miniur and Misdakh. On its western side it is bounded by the ’Iraq-Persian boundary. The limits of the district are otherwise indefinite, though on its eastern side it is bounded by the Ahwaz and Muhammarah districts. . x74 General, CHAPTER HI. Climate; j : The climate 0 f ’Arabistan is on the whole healthy and can be compared favourably with that of ’Iraq. Naturally a consider- ^difference is found in ^ temperatur s he ™ dis- tricts owing to their positions either close o he sea or along the foothills of a mountain range, or again in the open desert. Of In X'trir.t, nossiblv Ahwaz is the most salubrious, having a moderately dry climate with cool nights throughout almost the whole summer. During the war casualties from sickness amongst troops stationed at Ahwaz were very slight, and this place may be considered from a health as well as from a strategical point of view the most suitable station for troops m Arabistan. Of other districts Fallahiyah may easily claim the most un healthy climate, for it is reported that m the damp parts of that district the heat of the summer is almost intolerable, that mosquitoes abound to such an extent that even natives take retime inside nets immediately before sunrise and ea.- their evening meal there, and that military operations are practically impossible between June and September. The Hindian district is not unhealthy; hot and dry winds prevail in summer and m some years the climate ceases to be unpleasant as early as Sep tember. The Ramuz district, which runs along the foot of the hills, is dry but intolerably hot in summer due to the proximity of the hills, and it is said that natives never travel in the district except by night. The atmosphere in the Ma’shur district is extremely damp in summer and the heat oppressive. Muham- marah is too close to the Persian Gulf to have a dry atmosphere, but the district is not unhealthy; in September damp heavy mgs are experienced along the banks of the. Shatt-al- Arab, the Hawizah district has a varying cl mate, the marsh area, which lies between Hawizah town and ’Amarah, being damp and infested with mosquitoes, whilst the desert lands between the town and Ahwaz can claim a moderately dry climate. Ct the two Northern districts, Dizful and Shushtar, the atmosphere is dry in summer but inclined to he hot er than Ahwa , j rot ally due to their proximity to the hills which is also the cause of more frequent and heavier rains in winter, ^ The winter, which may be reckoned from the beginning ot November to the end of February, is idea 5 . Pvain ialls in D( cein ter and continues intermittently until the end of March, but■with usually a brea c in February which divides the rainy season into first rains and second rains as far as the agriculturist is concerned The first rains falling as they do in December, and at time &gt; in November, soften the ground for ploughing and the fina rains in M rch ive the necessary finishing touch to the crops. Daring the hot weather the rays of the sun are extremely Temperature, fierce and the whole land become ^ p rched The hottest months of the year are Jun • J ly and Aug ist the temperature generally reach! ig its highes point in July, and hat rarely being much abo ve 123 d3^re^s while at night it will drop as low as 80 degrees. A temperature below 90 degrees at night is very tolerable. A Meteorological record for the year 1922 at Maidan-i-Naftun (Oil Fields), and Abadan is included at the end of the chapter. It should be recollected that the summer of 1922 was an average summer, and inclined to be cooler than most. The prevailing wind during the greater part of the year comes from the North West. In August and September and some times as late as October 15th South East damp winds are pre valent. The strong north-west winds are moderately cool till June, after which they become hot by day but keep down the temperature by night. In places where it comes off a sandy desert, as is the case along the Karim after roughly the first 50 miles from Muhammarah, the dust carried by it is very irritating to th 3 exposed parts of the body. The damp south-east wind is the most trying to endure and the most unhealthy bringing with it mosquitoes from the marshes, and as a result malaria. Mosquitoe nets at this period are essential. The average rainfall is from 12 to 15 inches, though in 1922 the highest recorded is 8*29 inches. There is a large decrease running from North to South in the amount of rain that falls in Arabistan, and this must be accounted for by the proximity of the Northern districts to the hills, the proportion of rain that falls in Dizful, Shushtar and Ahwaz being approximately 8:6: 4. The amount of rain that fell during 1922 in Maidan-i-Naftun and Abadan is recorded at the end of the chapter. Mirage is experienced at all times of the year but to a less Mirage degree in the summer. It is most intensive in March and April, when visibility is sometimes restricted to half a mile.General Medi- As has been mnnticmed abo v e^the in the AhwL cal and Sani- i n ’Arabistan has been g ’ n ,r r t jj e jrallahiyah, Muham- hy ' m ‘ tal ^ p - valent.

V enereal diseases are common in all their forms, though rarely found amongst the tribes. Eye diseases of every description and isolated cases ol plague and typhoid fever are to be found.

In the winter OfSSttoM. months mud makes the passage of motor transport difficult for three days after rain. All rivers and streams are in flood during February, March and April, and it is worthy of note that during these months the motor road on the left bank of the Karun from Haflar, 4 miles upstream of Muhammarah, to Dorquaim ia flooded and impassable. The water from the Karun is sweet, but should be boiled or sterilised, and particularly in the vicinity of towns and villages. Sharks are not uncommon at Ahwaz. Evacuation of sick and wounded is a simple matter in th« district, roads suitable for ambulance cars existing in all parts of the province. In the event of operations in the Fallahiyah district it would be necessary to evacuate sick by means of bellams along the Fallahiyah-Marid canal; these could be obtain ed with no difficulty in sufficient quantities at Muhammarah and Fallahiyah. In dry season it is possible to evacuate sick by road within a few hours from Ahwaz and Muhammarah to Basrah, but this would naturally depend on the tribal situation. In the event of the road being impassable sick would be evacuated by steamer on the Karun to Muhammarah and if necessary thence to Basrah. MC164-CGS0 79 CHAPTER IV. Economic Resources. ’Arabistan is essentially an agricultural country and with Gea ® tai * unlimited acres of good soil, almost unlimited water and fuel, is a paradise for engineers and agriculturists. The native, however, as in ’Iraq, has no ideas regarding the improvement of his country provided that he himself has sufficient for his personal needs, and so the best in ’Arabistan is still far from being realised With the exception of the manufacture of a few ordinary neces sities of life such as agricultural implements and saddlery there are no manufacturing industries on a large scale. Regard ing minerals, which are scarce, mention must be made of oil, though actually the oil fields are on the fringe of the Bakhtiarl country and outside the limits of ’Arabistan. Oil, however, has done much for the province, running as it does throughout its whole length until it reaches the refinery at Abadan and thus not only providing employment for thousands of men and additional financial interest for the Shaikhs whose duty it is to protect the pipe line but also introducing into the country machinery and other European methods, which in time the’ Arab cultivator may see fit to use for irrigation and better produce of his land. It is hoped too to find oil at both Dehluran, north of ’Arabistan, and at Mamutain, about 10 miles from Ram Hormuz, and by bringing new pipe lines through new districts further employment and interests will be found for the people of ’Arabistan. As in most agricultural countries labour for any but agri- Labour, cultural purposes is difficult to obtain locally. Again ’Arabistan is fortunate in its connection with the Anglo-Persian Oil Com- pany, which has drawn its employees from the tribes, particularly the Lurs, and from the towns, of which Shushtar provides by far the greatest number, and given work to men who would in all probability have otherwise remained idle. Labour, therefore, becoming tnus general ceases to be considered 1 coolie work ’ and as such beneath the dignity of those superior to that class. The chief sources of labour, as would be required for military works, are the towns of Shushtar and Dizful, Ram Hormuz and Isfahan, and the Bakhtiari from the district of Chehar Mahal; a few labourers could be found in Nasiri and Muhammarah. Taking Nasiri as a base it should be possible to procure 1,000 coolies within ten days, unless the crops are MC164CGSr kJ . (• i 011 80 Agriculture. particularly ^ood, when a month would be necessary for the same number. The present rate of pay for labour is Man.—4 krans per day. Boy.—2h krans per da^y. (1) Products. —(i'/) Wheat, barley, rice, maize, linseed., gram, lentils, cotton, millet, sesame, poppies, opium, tobacco, indigo The chief winter crops, which are sown in December and reaped in April, are wheat, barley, poppies, and the summer crops rice, with which is sown maize, linseed, gram, millet and cotton. Indigo is a product solely of the Dizful district, where it is said that both soil and climate are exceedingly favourable for its production and the produce might be considerably increased for export purposes, if the people only understood the preparation better. It is sown in the middle of March ancl cut 120 days later, when about 5 feet high, and 40 days later it is again cut: the best sort of indigo is clear blue, but much of the crops is yellow. Cotton is grov/n somewhat extensively but the crop is often destroyed by locusts, whilst opium is grown largely in the *Shushtar district, where its cultivation is yearly increasing and superseding, in value at least, that of cereals. (b) Beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, radish, brinjals, Ladies’ fingers and potatoes. Vegetables, which are both winter and summer^crops and are chiefly grown in the vicinity of the towns, are not an Eastern product, the majority such as tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, onions and beans being a European introduction and cultivated by the native for purely commercial reason . Potatoes, which are also included above, are not a product of this province but are grown in the hills close to Ram Hormuz, from where they are at most times easily obtainable. sfc’-l (c) Dates, limes, sweet limes, oranges, pomegranates, apri cots, grapes, melons and in addition from Ram Hormuz only— plums, apples, figs, quince, citrons, pears and almonds; All fruits are grown in the gardens situated close to the to a ns. Muhammarah and lallahiyah alone produce dates. The best and largest quantity of fruit is to be found at Ram Hormuz in the gardens owned by the Bakhtiari Khans round the outskirts of the town.82 „„ running nrpense. are entailed.

Sheep, however, are numerous and particularly good in the Northern Province. Fallahiyah district produces the best cows and Hawizah buffa loes. Donkeys are imported from Zubair. Dizful is famous for its mules, though the best are to be obtained from the Sagwand tribe in the Dizful district. Mules and camels are to be found at Nasiri but hardly sufficient to meet the demand for transport up country and neither are bred locally. For details of ap proximate numbers available for purchase, vide Table at the end of this chapter. Minerals. In mineral products ’Arabistan is not rich, though the extensive oil-fields of Maidan-i-Naftun lie not more than 30 miles live-stock.83 from its northern boundary and more oil is expected even'™ at Mamatam, which is situated less than l(f miles rer Hormuz town.

The two most important Customs houses are at Muham- Custeaia, marah, situated at the mouth of the Karan on its right bank, and at Nasiri on the left bank of the river immediately alongside the wharves. Nasiri with its rapidly increasing trade owns probably the most important Customs house, which examines goods arriving from all quarters. There are also Customs houses at both Dizful and Shushtar, but, and particularly in %he case of Shushtar, little or no work is done by these departments owing to all goods being declared at Nasiri. In April 1922 an official was appointed by the Persian Government at Ram Hormuz ; for some months the inhabitants refused to recognise him, but his position is now established. The Customs Department, as in the whole of Persia, is under the control of Belgian officials with Persian sub ordinates. For the present Customs tariff, vide Appendix at the end of report. Smuggling is not uncommon in ’Arabistan, the chief articles which are smuggled, being rifles, ammunition and krans. Pos sibly Hawizah is better acquainted with this art than any other place in the province, though a certain amount of rifle smuggling is carried on from the smaller ports on the Persian Gulf. The banking business of ’Arabistan is chiefly carried on Bankiag. through the branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Muhammarah, Ahwaz and Shushtar. There is also a small amount of banking done through native bankers or Saraffs. The inhabitants of ’Arabistan are not usually in favour of depositing sums of money with European Banks in Current Deposit Account or with the native Saraffs. This is probably due to the inherent instinct of Asiatics for hoarding and also to a large extent to the continually unsettled political state of this part of the world. The Foreign Exchange business in cover of Foreign Trade is practically all done through the Imperial Bank of Persia as also86 Reraue. the Inland Exchange resulting chiefly from trade with Isfahan and Teheran. Although there is a small amount of gold currency in cireu- lation, the currency of Persia may be taken to be entirely on the silver basis, the kran being practically pure silver. The note issue of the Imperial Bank of Persia is also favourably received in all parts of Persia. A large number of rupee notes is m circu- lation in the Persian Gulf Ports and a limited cjuantity of silver rupees. The local head of the Persian Revenue Department, who is appointed from Teheran and is known by the title of Pishkar , has his headquarters at Nasiri, with subordinate offices at Dizful and Shushtar. The whole revenue of ’Arabistan is paid to the Persian Government through this official. As regards the revenue of Northern ’Arabistan, which com prises the towns of Dizful and Shushtar and the contiguous estates, direct revenue is paid on estates at a sum fixed on each estate by the former “ Mustaufis,” which has never been altered, and indirect revenue consisting of taxes on industries, shops, mills, indigo works, ferries, etc., most of which are farmed out annually to the highest bidders, is collected by the local revenue heads of Shushtar and Dizful. The total sum collected from 'both direct and indirect revenues amounts to about 50,000 tomans annually. As regards the revenue of Southern ’Arabistan, which in cludes all the Arab tribes whether resident in the northern or southern province, the whole is collected by the Shaikh of Muhammarah through his agents and paid by him to the “ Pishkar ” at Nasiri. According to revenue books, vide follow ing list, this sum should amount to approximately 75,000 tomans but in practice the Shaikh pays from 30,000 to 40,000 tomans, the difference being due to pensions and deductions on account of expenditure incurred by the Shaikh in maintaining law and order in Southern ’Arabistan. The revenue paid from this district was assessed at a fixed sum per district or tribe many years ago, which has never been altered. * Jx 6 s y stem of revenue collection in ’Arabistan is*out of date and it is not unlikely that the American Financial Advi- visers now in Teheran will shortly take steps towards improving87 The following table shows the annual revenue payable to ike Persian Government by the Shaikh of Muhammarah.

It is useful to note that these figures were taken during the war, when our troops were drawing from the resources of the province. Description of goods. Weights. - 1914-15. 1915-16. 1916-17, Tons.

Nomculs, t.e., cattle owners, who live intents and wander to where the best pasture for their cattle can be found. e chief nomadic tribes are the Lurs. 2. Semi-Nomads, i. e., part cattle owners, part cultivators. The best examples of these are the Bani Tamim and Bam Lam. 3. The settled cultivators, i.e., those who reside permanently either on the river banks or in an irrigated area and are engaged in purely agricultural pursuits. Of these the most prominent are the Ch’ab of the Fallahiah district, and the Muhaisin. 4. The town-duellers, i.e., those enaged in commercial or industrial pursuits and Government officials. Races. (1) Arabs.—hi 640 A. D. we hear of Hormuzan, satrap of Khuzistan, being defeated at Ram Hormuz and Akwaz being handed over to the Arabs. This appears to be the first date of pure bred Arabs settling in the province. Almost all the tribes now settled in Arabistan originated from Central Arabia migrat ing either directly to ’ Arabistan or to ’ Iraq from where they haveV, 93 since come in search of land or employment. There is practically no intermarriage between the Persians and Arabs except in the south eastern districts of Hindian and Zeidan where a certain number of mixed marriage are to be found. (2) Persians .—Though ’Arabistanfis administered by the Persian Government, the number of Persians in the country is extremely small. Intermarriage, trade and Government posts have drawn a few into the province. (3) Lurs. —Lurs, amongst whom must be included the Bakhtiari, are to be found encamped during the winter months in the Dizful and Shushtar districts, whilst a certain number are always to be found about the Tarrahi; in addition in recent years the number of Bakhtiari in the Pam Hormuz district has been rapidly increasing chiefly due to the fact that the Pam Hormuz town has been bought by the Bakhtiari khans. Their origin is somewhat doubtful; they appear to be of the same ethnical group as the Kurds, their neighbours of the North, though they consider it an insult to be confounded with them. Most writers however agree that they are of aboriginal, old Aryan or Iranian stock, who preceded Arabs, Turks or Tartars in the land. They do not mam 7 with the Arab, with whom they are not generally on the best terms. 1 he religion of Arabistan is that which is common in most Religions, parts of Persia, viz., Shi’ah Muhammadanism. As is the case with Shi’ahs in all Muhammadan countries, religion plays an im portant part in their every day life and frequently creates fanati cism. . This is particularly noticeable in the towns of Shushtar and Dizful. During the war too the influence of the Mujtahids extended to such an extent to the tribes on the east of the Karun that not only was it impossible for either the British or the Shaikh of Muhammarah to rely upon them for support but they proved themselves a danger which could not be lightly over looked. Of the Sunni creed of Muhammadanism there are few, . xn, are to be found in the Hindian district and they are afraid to profess their faith openly. A small percentage of Christians and Jews are to be found in the towns of Nasiri and Muhammarah only and Sabaeans in Hawizah as well; all are employed in their own art or trade. No further reftrence need fee made to either Christians or Jews,94 but the Sabaeans are deserving of comment if only because they had their origin on the borders of ’Arabistan. For the past fifteen hundred years the Sabaeans have lived in the vicinity of ’Arabistan. For many years they were settled in Persia but were driven out by the Sun and Fire worshippers of that country and settled in Chehar Riz, which lies between Band-i-Bazurgan on the left bank of the Teeb and the Pusht i-Kuh Here the Persians again molested them and they fled, some to Hawizah and some to the Euphrates marshes in the district of Suq-al-Shuyukh. The Persians endeavoured to obliterate all traces of their religion and burnt all holy books, which they found at Chehar Riz. About 500 years later one of these books was discovered there and from this their present books all trace their origin. The number of Sabaeans have greatly declined in recent years, and are still dwindling. The exact nature of their religion and its affinities with Star-worship, Judaism, Christianity and Muhammadanism have not been ascertained accurately. The modern Sabaeans possess scriptures of their own and a book of ritual; baptism is one of their principal rites, and water enters into all their important ceremonies; they respect Yahia, or John the Baptist, as a prophet, regarding him as a re-incarnation of Seth, but they consider both Christ and Moses to have been false teachers; their paradise is in the North Star. They are an uncircumcised race and not monogamous. In dress they are indistinguishable from the Arabs, though all Sabaeans wear a red ‘ chefiyah,’ whilst in appearance it is im possible to mistake a Sabaean, all of whom are remarkable for their handsome features. The whole race display a special aptitude for working in gold and silver, and in ’Iraq many of them are canoe builders and carpenters. The head of their religion is Shaikh Dakhil, who lives at Suq-al-Shuyukh, having left ’Amarah on account of a quarrel with his family, who still remain there. The Sabaeans *of ’Amarah claim that their headquarters is at ’Amarah, where their local chief is Shaikh Jodah. languages. The language of the Northern province is formed from the various dialects of Arabic and Luri besides the patois of Dizful95 and Shushtar, whilst further south Arabic is spoken with a cer tain proportion of Persian words. With the exception of the Lur tribes and the towns of Dizful and Shushtar, where very little Arabic is known and where a Luri or Persian interpreter, if possible acquainted with the district would be necessary, Arabic is understood everywhere and in most parts Persian too.96 CHAPTER VI. Tribes. General. ’Arabistan is a country to which tribes have migrated from Central Arabia, ’Iraq and Luristan in search of land on wmch they will be able to cultivate or graze their cattle. With the exception perhaps of the Lurs all recognise the Shaikh of Muham- marah as their immediate overlord, but this does not necessa rily imply that these tribes, as a collective body, would create at any time a combined fighting force prepared to follow the Shaikh. In actual fact it is far otherwise, the Shaikh’s control over them in peace time being due to his power to grant or seize land, his strong method of administration, by which he breaks the influence of any shaikh, who with his tribe may become a menace to himself, and the support given to him by the British Government. With this power behind him the tribes are al most bound to submit to his authority, but this submission is made with no good grace, and certain tribes, more especially in the districts north of Hawizah between the Karkhe h and the ’Iraq boundary, are ever ready to turn their backs on the Shaikh, if by so doing they themselves will be benefited. As regards the Lurs they are more liable to stand in the way of rather than assist in any attempt on the part of the Shaikh to create co hesion among the tribes. The tribes of the province are of three varieties nomadic, semi-nomadic and sedentary. The sedentary as the nama implies dwelling in the more fertile valleys and on the river banks live in villages and practice agricultural and pastoral farming. The semi-nomadic groups inhabit villages and tents, part cultivating and part owning large flocks of sheep and goats. The nomads, all of whom are Lurs, dwell in tents all the year round, own large flocks of sheep, goats and horses but no land. They move into the plains of ’Arabistan in the autumn and return to the hills in early summer. Armed forces. The question of armed forces must be considered under two separate headings, viz., Arabs and Kurs. Arabs .—Numbers are at all times difficult to estimate, whea dealing with tribes of Arabia, Persia and other eastern countries, where the system of a census is unknown and a native is even unable to reckon his own age. The number of male Arabs ia : nn97 ’Ara ista i, however, ia estimated from various sources at be- tween fifty and sixty thousand. Of these it is doubtful, whether ™ 1 °r e . 60 % could ever te Put into and maintained in the held Taking therefore 40,000, as the outside limit of the tMiaikn of Muiiammarah/s forces and taking into consideration he fact that the Bani Lam about 7,000 have never fought under the Shaikh s banner and probably never will; that the Bani iuruf about 10,000 would m all probability side with the Bani Lam, and that owing to petty jealousies, feuds and other tribal discords a further 20% would not follow the Shaikh, the maxi- forc ® on f which the Shaikh could rely would not exceed ui., , force wou!d be an iH-trained and ill-disciplined rabble, who would probably be a source of weakness rather than s rengt to the Shaikh, and it is doubtful if an invading army would meet with any serious opposition. . Regarding arms and ammunition the total estimate of arms in Arabistan amongst the Arab tribes works out at approxi- mately 30,000, of which the Bani Turuf and Bani Lam can claim some 1 l, 000. Ike matter of arms and ammunition, however would be no great source of trouble to the Shaikh, who within a very short time could supply the force under his command with arms and ammunition sufficient for every man from Kuwait ShSkh hP haS a long ' Standing and firm frie ndship with the According to present calculations it may be safely assumed that the tribes west of the Karun are better armed than those on the east not only in the number of arms which they possess but also in the type of rifle. Ammunition is probably not too plentiful, though undoubt edly arms and ammunition are extensively smuggled into Arabistan from the Persian Gulf chiefly through the ports on the south east coast, and in the event of war ammunition would be brought openly and extensively from Kuwait in the same ways as rifles. The number of Lurs, which includes Bakhtiaris that migrate into ’Arabistan during the winter can be esti mated at from 40,000 to 50,000 ; these could muster from 8,000 to 10,000 fighting men, all of whom would be armed with a poor type of rifle and home made ammunition, suitable only for work at ranges of 500 to 600 yards. M C164 C G S98 'Tribe* In rela tion to possible centres of disturbance. (1) LURS. In this paragraph reference is made to the Anilah -Luis, previously at Shush, and the Sagwand, who reside in the vici nity of Pizful, and not to the Bakhtiari sections, who migrate annually to the Shushtar and Ram Hormuz plains. Shush and its surrounding country is the property of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who for many years leased it to the ’Amlah Lurs. In 1922 Khallaf ibn Shinawir, agent of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, had been pressing the Shaikh to evict the ’Amlah Lurs from Shush. In January 1923 the Shaikh requested the chiefs, Ghularn Reza Khan and Saifullah Khan to leave Shush, and on their refusal he sent a force against them and attacked them, the result of which was that both chiefs fled to the Chenanah section of the Bani Lam. Ghulam Reza Khan is a relation and close friend of the Wah of Pusht-i-Kuh, and one day if the Shaikh’s or his successor’s power diminishes may see the return of Ghulam Reza Khan supported by the Wall. The Sagwand tribe has always been a thorn in the side of the Dizful district, and more especially as regards robbing of caravans and acts of brigandage than any open hostility. For this rea son the t ibe is more liable to draw the wrath of other tribes upon itself, and notably the Chenanah and Khazraj sections of the Bani Lam, than to take the initiative in an attack on any of the Shaikh’s forces. Petty fighting might at any time break out between the Sagwand and ’Amla tribes, who entertain no amicable feelings towards each other. As regards the support that these Lur tribes would receive from the Lurs, who annually invade the plains of Northern ’Arabistan, it is difficult even to hazard, a guess, for all tribes and sections are split with internal factions. It is doubtful if any support would be given by the Arab tribes of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who one and all dislike the Lurs. (2) BAKHTIARIS. On the surface it would appear that nothing but friend ship should exist between the Bakhtiari and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. Both have a common cause in their protection of the Oil Fields and the benefit both financially and otherwise that ihey derive from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and both99 have a common cause in their keen anxiety to prevent any inter ference on the part of the Persian Government in their terri tories. An alliance exists between the two parties and both pro fess friendship outwardly for the other, but a feeling of jealousy lies latent, probably the result of a long standing enmity. For many years previous to the war the districts of Dizful and Shushtar were no more than the lands on which the Shaikh of Muhammarah and the Pakhtiaris used to settle their differences} and it will be recollected that in the spring of 1917 Sardar Muhta- sham the Il-Khani resigned office, one of the reasons given being that the Pritish had built up a position in ’Arabistan, which put a complete check on the rapacity and oppression of the Bakhtiaris in Dizful and Shush tar. So long as the British Government continues its support to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, there is little fear of danger from this quarter, but an outbreak between the two parties is a possi- bility, w hich may at any time have to be reckoned with. Against a common foe, how ever, and particularly against any intrusion on the part of the Persian Government the Shaikh of Muham marah and the Bakhtiaris would stand together and sink all other differences. (3) BAJNJT TUB UP and BAK1 LAM. These two tribes have never been entirely under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, and in the Bani Lam is found a leader. Shaikh Ghadhban, a bitter enemy of the Shaikh of . uhammarah, who would, if he c uld see the opportunity, stir up these tribes to rebel against the Shaikh. Since a number of the tribes of Northern ’Arabistan are offshoots of the Bani Lam, the Shaikh would have to jely almost entirely on his southern tribes for support. The outcome of a di turbance from this quarter would be serious, but the possibility is very i emote, and again for die same reason as with the Bakhtiari, namely the support of the British Government. In other parts of Arabistan the tribes are too much under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah for any serious oppo* sition against him to be taken by them. The majority wo uld follow 7 him, but not without first carefully considering the benefit to be gained from supporting either one side or the other.Political attitude. - The political attitude of the area is determined by the oY-w- ing forces:— (1) British Government. (2) The Shaikh of Muhammarah. (3) Persian Government. (4) Religion. (1) British Influence .—Previous to the war the power of Great Britain was little more than a name to the natives of ’Arabistan. During the war, however, British troops were compelled to invade the country to eject the Turks, who were endeavouring to create disorder amongst the tribes. The troops, though frequently only in small numbers, made their power felt, partly by their organisation and discipline, partly by the fact that they were British troops, and partly by the knowledge that unlimited reserves could be called upon both of troops and arms. Such an invasion of modern arms into an uncivilised coun try is bound to make an impression on the uneducated minds of the tribesmen, and an impression which will not be quickly forgotten. At the present time the Shaikh of Muhammarah receives the support of the British Government, and it is for the presence or absence of that support to which every eye in 5 Arabi stan is turned. It would not be fair to the Shaikh, whom no one will deny is a man and a ruler, to suppose that if British support w 7 ere taken away, his power would be broken, but it is not incor rect to say that his task would be a hundred-fold more difficult, and that those looking for revenge would realise that at last they could enter upon a task with some hope of success. (2) The Shaikh of Muhammarah .—To a very large extent the attitude of the tribes is affected in the same way by the Shaikh of Muhammarah as by the British Government, since so long as the Shaikh has the support of the British the two are the same in the eyes of the tribesmen. The Shaikh, however, has other forces at work, which call for him to be considered by his people for other reasons than the mere tool of a foreign Government. Chief of these are his never failing purpose in disencouraging the pretensions of tribal Shaikhs by creating representatives of his own selection to control his tribes, and his wealth with which he buys over to his side any wavering chiefs of importance. Such carries weight to a considerable extent and with the back ing of the British Government is sufficient to hold the tribes in *101 •heck, but the oppression of the tribes by the Shaikh will always create for him powerful enemies ready to seize an opportunity to break his power; this oppression influences very strongly the minds of the tribesmen. (3) Persian Government —Though the Persian is actually the Government, to which the tribes of ’Arabistan are subject, it might as well not exist for all the importance that is attached to it by the tribesmen. To the Shaikh of Muhammarah, however, and to the Governor-General it holds an importance, which cannot be Overlooked. ’Arabistan is virtually independent of the Persian Government, though it is governed in name by a Gover nor General and its revenue is paid into the Persian Treasury. Threats of troops being despatched to assist the Shaikh in the control of his tribes and the collection of his revenue bring home most forcibly to him that the day of their arrival commences the downfall of his automony. Again the Shaikh realises that the Persian Government views with suspicion his relations with the British Government and would be very ready to break up an alliance, which checks the Persian Government from dealing as it would with the Shaikh and his inaccessible province of ’Arabistan. Never failing tact, therefore, is always being called for from the Shaikh and his ministers in their dealings with the Persian Government. (4) Religion .—The power of religion, generally latent among the tribes, if not in the fanatical towns of Dizful and Shushtar, made itself felt during the war, when the Shaikh of Muhammarah for all his influence found himself unable to rely on many of his tribes, and notably the Cha’b and Bawieh, who were listening with a very ready ear to a jihad organised by the Turks in order to spread discontent in the province. Peace or war, so long as Christian dominates Muhammadan, either directly or indirectly, Mussulman mujtahids will be found working against the interests of the Christian Power, and behind them a large following. The Military value of the Persian Arab, fighting under his Military con- own leaders in his own country, is undoubtedly less than that of ^derations, his neighbours in ’Iraq, and the tribes more closely connected with ’Iraq are better fighters than those more distant. They are mobile, whether on horse or foot, to a remarkable degree, and are little hampered by questions of supply. They are fairly well armed, though not by any means correspondingly good shots, owing to lack of practice.102 Tribal action. Punitive measures.

Owing to the absolute lack of cohesion amongst the tribes a general rising in the form of a single force operating nn^r o^e control is not within the bounds of possibility. The worst that could he feared would be the rising of several independent parties, whose activities would be confined to looting villages anc ravaging crops. From the Hawizah district alone could be ex pected anything in the form of a combined rising, and even that would break up with factions and feuds, and finally com- nrisA no more than an undisciplined rabble of raiding parties. Punitive measures must vary slightly according to the dis tricts in which action must be taken. One or^two effective measures are suggested. (1) Dizful .—Hold the stronghold of Shush and cut off Dizfu town from the tribes. Dizful is the market town and supplv centre for the district. (2) Fallahiyah .—Close down canals, which can be quickly and effectivelv dammed at their heads with earth and brush- wood. Generally speaking the most suitable course to adopt w r ould be:—- (1) Preliminary occupation of the principal towns, thus cut ting off the main source of supply. (2) Military and aerial action against tribes offering resistance in accessible country. (3) The subsequent destruction of villages. (1) The tribes are comprised of Lurs and Arabs, neither of whom are friendly to one another^and amongst neither of wTiom is there any real cohesion (2) The Lurs are an undisciplined and uncontrolled crowd of brigands and robbers.« 103 (3) The Arabs are undisciplined but controlled to a certain extent by thd Shaikh of Muhammarah and the knowledge that he has the support of the British Government. (4) All tribesmen are poor fighters, faint-hearted and bad marksmen. (5) Internal dissensions would prevent the Shaikh of Muham marah from ever creating a combined fighting force out of his tribes, and for the same reasons a general rising among the tribes against the Shaikh of Muhammarah is a possibility that need scarcely be entertained. Tribal List. Minor Tribe, Section or Sub-section. Main Tribe or Confedera tion. N. B .—-The numerous small tribes in the Hindian, Zaitan Bandar Ma’shur and Jarrahi districts belonging to no main tribe or Confederation have been recorded in these lists under the heading of their districts. A *Abad ’Abbad, Albu ’Abbadi, Albu Abbas, Bait Abbas, Bait A1 ’Abdi Nebi, Albu Abdu Wais Abdul Khan Abdul Latif ’Abdul, Saiyid Bait ’Abdullah, A1 Abdullah Bait Hindian A1 Khamis Cha’b al Gubbam Bani Lam Bani Lam Bani Turuf Bani Lam Bani Turuf Bani Turuf Bani Turuf Salamat Bani Hardan120 occupied by the ‘Amlah tribe, and in January 1923, he succeeded in persuading the Shaikh of Muhammerah to write to Ghulam Eeza Khan explaining that his lease had expired and that he must remove his tribe. Ghulam Eeza Khan re use , an m March troops were sent against him by the Shaikh under the command of Abdul Hamid, his second son and Deputy Governor of Ahwaz. The attack was successful, Ghulam Reza Khan being defeated and harassed on his retreat by the Sagwand tribe, which fact provides a further instance of the lack of cohesion amongst the Lur tribes. Ghulam Reza Khan and Saifullah Khan are now living with the Chenanah section of the Rani Lam, and though safe conduct and a promise of settlement on other lands has been offered by the Shaikh of Muhammerah, it is more probable that the two chiefs will return to the territory of the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, to whom they are related. The tribesmen still reside on their own lands and are more or less controlled by the Shaikh s agent Khallaf. ! » i122 ’ANAFIJAH— An Arab tribe, said to be related to A1 Kathir, once powerful and of primary importance in Southern ’Arabistan, but now greatly diminished in numbers, and associated with the Bait Sa’ad of A1 Kathir. The former boundary of the ’Anafijah tribe ran along the right bank of the Shatait river from its confluence with the river Diz to a little above Chahar Dingeh ; thence it crossed to Kut Bandar on to the river Diz, and, passing by Khairabad on the Shaur to the left bank of the river Karkheh, followed the Karkheh to a point some ten miles above Nahr Hashim; from this point it ran to Khar Ishtireh opposite Ahwaz, and then kept along the right bank of the Karun to the mouth of the river Diz. The ’Anafijah are now almost confined to the right bank of the Karun between Band-i-Qir and Wais with a few scattered in the Mianab. The tribe is politically allied to the Hamaid, who would follow them in war. It is controlled by the Shaikh of Muham- marah through his agent Khalaf ibn Shinaiyir.126 BALA GIRIEH— &gt; ' • The Lur tribes, which encamp on the plains of Northern^ ’Arabistan during the winter months, are all of this confederation, which numerically is the strongest of the four principal divisions of the Lurs. Their general policy, however, is not of a very advanced type, and its striking features are a more or less un remitting feud on the part of some of its branches with the Persian Government, general acts of hostility against each other, and strained relations with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. An example of the lack of cohesion between these tribes was given during the war, when the Sagwand were successfully raided by British troops in 1916 and finally driven out of the Dizful neighbourhood by the Bahrawand. With the exception of the Sagwand tribe, which is recorded separately, the Arabs of ’Arabistan rarely come into contact with the Lurs ; this is fortunate, as their life is a constant repeti tion of forays and raids, thieving and broken bonds. No better description of a Lur can be given than that he is an adroit and incurable thief. The little that is known about these tribes is mentioned in the tribal lists against each tribe separately; the tribesmen are poor lighters, but adept raiders. Serious and combined opposition need not be ever expected from this quarter.130 BAWIEH— A once powerful tribe of the southern province of ’Arabistan that has been broken by the Shaikh of Muhammarah and is now completely under his control. Owing to their proximity to Ahwaz the tribe recognises the Shaikh’s representative, Shaikh Abdul Hamid, at that place as their chief and revenue is paid direct to him by the minor Shaikhs of the tribe. During the war in 1915 the Bawieh were affected by the jihad preached at the instigation of the Turks and seriously impeded our advance against the Turks by cutting the pipe line and thus causing us to retain more troops on the Kanin than would otherwise have been necessary^ At this time in conjunc tion with the Cha’b the Bawieh intended to attack N siri; the Cha’b, however, failed to come up to the scratch, and the Bawieh, who came in contact with the Shaikh’s troops at Nasiri, were compelled to retire. The result of this reverse was that the Bawieh made their submission to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and arrangements were immediately set on foot for the payment of allowances to the tribe for the protection of the pipe line through their territory. In September of 1915 a subsidy of £1,000 was sanctioned for the Bawieh, who for this sum agreed to guard their length of the pipe line. In the same month British troops were sent to garrison Band-i-Qir, when nearly all the Bawieh Chiefs turned out to welcome the column and accompany it to its destination. Owing to lack of water in 1921 the tribe was reduced t® poverty and compelled to sell rifles and animals in order to live. The Bawieh claims descent from the Arab hero, Muhalhal, and consider their ancestry superior to that of the Cha’b.134 HA’B (AL GUBBAM)— A numerous cind once owerful tribe, which immigiuted Southern ’Arabistan at the end of the 16th or beginning of the 1 71 h|centuryAt the time of their arrivaJ ’Arabistan was a subject of dispute between Tel eran and Constantinople, as to whether the southern province should or should not form part of the dominions of the Shah. The Cha’b had previously been subject to Ottoman rule ; they had, however, no preference for either, but when they spread eastwards they found themselves obliged to pay tribute to the Shah. For the next two centuries the Cha’b committed acts of piracy with impunity, though naval operations were repeatedly attempted against them by the East India Company, but without success. In the beginning of the 19th century a rival to the Cha’b in the Muhaisin appeared, who determined to throw off the yoke of the Cha’b, to whom it was subject, but it was not till 1898 that the Cha’b shaikhdom was finally extinguished and the Muhaisin inherited their pos sessions from the Karan to Hindian. In the early days of the war in 1915, the Cha’b were affected by the jihad preached at the instigation of the Turks. They took no active part against our troops, but their attitude wm decidedly rebellious and they actually made an agreement to join the Bawleh in an attack on Kasiri; in this, however, they failed the Bawieh at the last moment. Of the four main tribes that were hostile to the British, namely, the Cha’b, Bawieh, Bani Tamim and Bani Turuf, the Cha’b held out longest and for that reason the Shaikh of Muhammarah sent a force of 3,000 Muhaisin to attack them ; the Cha’b w r ere defeated and caused no further trouble during the war. The action took place on the 5th June 1915, at the village of Umm-as-Sakhar, where the Cha’b were collected in force and defeated within four hours. In the event of possible future expeditions against the Cha’b it is w r orthy of note that the canal system furnishes the key to the topography of the Fallahiyah district, and that canals which it is desired to close are quickly and effectively dammed at their heads with earth and brushwood. In addition the Jarrahi river forms the main artery of inland communication by water, and boats of considerable size can navigate to the uppermost limits of the Fallahiyah district, and even beyond, from the Persian Gulf by the port of Buzieh and the Khor Musa, though the Jarrahi is not connected by a navigable waterway to either. The135 Jarrahi, however, is the principal means of communication bet ween Muhammarah and Fallahiyah, being joined to the Karun at Marid by the Fallahiyah-Marid canal. About 300 ballams are said to have their headquarters at Fallahiyah town. The tribe is divided into three main divisions Dris or ‘Asach- rah, Albu Ghubaish and Khanafarah. Though Dris and Albu Ghubaish are under two separate chiefs, they invariably fight under one flag. The tribesmen cannot be described as altogether settled, nor are they wholly nomadic. Where they own arable lands, they cultivate wheat, barley and rice ; they also own buffaloes, cattle, sheep and even donkeys; there are numerous date groves along the banks of the canals, which they cultivate, whilst in the marshes they move about in canoes fishing and shooting wild fowl. The tribe is under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who colects revenue through their chief Shaikh, ’Abud iba144 DAGHAGHLEK Previously an Arab nomadic tribe living in tents on the Karkheh and tributory to Hawizah. Later it was known as a section of the Anafijah till a short time back, when the Shaikh of Muhammarah ordered the tribe to settle at Mubatihah, and sever their connection with the ’Anafijah. ^The tribe, which is actually under the Shaikh’s agent Khalaf ibn Shinaiyir, would follow the Anafijah in&gt;ar, whilst that tribe m its turn would support the A1 Kathir.146 HAMAID. A tribe, partly nomadic, partly settled, which is] allied to the Bawieh. With this exception the tribe can claim no importance149 ; f BAN I HARD AN. A small tribe that has settled on the right bank of the Karim above ’Aminiyah. The tribe has fallen on hard times and is of little or no importance. It is controlled by the Shaikh of Muhammarah. ^150 m m H o &amp; M to Q W S Ph *&lt;1 •WOR •QSJOJi •sosnojj jo ^ s^uox ‘soi [itn^ si ^3 Q o ’■d c6 a o r-—&lt; tS fe 5 2^ CD 5 8 • r-i a ao CD a 4J i—&lt; to S'g 5^ ^ a a § ^ ^ a (D ,Q c3 CQ « ^ j '13 _i rrt F 3i ^ H ” y e8 &lt;D 3 o 3 f-&lt; _Cj r ' 3 r-3 ^ o __, 'd •4-» ^ ^ 10 c! *-* c3 rP c3 cd Ph Tj u; rP O 0 Q 02 O 43 3 o rO c8 CQ a * o d) .O • r—&lt; ?-&lt; 43 c D OQ ,0 rj °&lt;J o p cc o *'rP r—H O 2o a« O ® _ O &lt;D O ^ CM 0 - O PhT5 Ci o rP lO 00 I-H -90IAJ0S ^ n q PIO 150 © •njopopf CO © •IB^OI 1-0 L'* O lO o iO o QC © &gt;Q © iO lO © © © © lO © © © © © o © © a &amp; 43 _, r , d ‘P cc! rP k&gt;^ m hP c3 W o « 5 . tJ ^ o 2 2 H O rC ® S ^3 is O S 4^1 .rH • ^ P P P C^ b, “ l ^4 o ^ 43 C . c3 drP i_i t4-j P a 'XJ W c6 'P rP £ Pr^ U)g^ P O PS (D -d P eg SI ce © „ ^ P rP ferP CDP^ro4J2*i-j«J 43 eg ^ rj r—i P r3 P jp Pj pgl^ o,PH3&gt;4.2r20o2a2 Pi eg d c £C p p^ ?

H INDIAN OF ZAITAN, BANDAR MA’SHUR DISTRICTS. AND JARRAHI With the exception of half the Jarrahi district, which is in habited by part of the vast Cha’b tribe, these four districts are comprised of sections of tribes, Lurs, Persians and Arabs, who for various reasons have wandered from their own lands, and settled in these south-eastern districts of ’Arabistan. Seeing that they have long deserted their main tribes or confederations, and attached themselves to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, to whose authority they submit and to whom they pay their reve nue, they are included in this report as tribes of the districts, in which they reside, and indexed as such, the district taking the place in the index of the main tribe or confederation. Such details as are known of their origin are mentioned in the remarks column of the tribal lists against each tribe separately. Each district is under the control of one of the Shaikh of Muhammarah’s agents, who is responsible generally for law and order and the collection of revenue. At the present time (1923), the Shaikh is represented as follows :— Hindian. Zaitan. Bandar Ma’shur. Jarrahi. By ’Agha ’Abdi al Samur. By Mir Abdullah. By Ahmad ibn Sulaiyah. By Mir Cholan. Lives at Hindian Town. Lives at Suwaireh. Lives at Ma’shur. Lives at Khalafabad. Zaitan is in reality no more than a plain dividing Hindian from Behbehan and forming part of Hindian district. It is however sometimes considered a separate district and is now ruled by Mir Abdullah, who was previously the Shaikh’s agent for Hindian, but was removed by the Shaikh for failing to col lect sufficient revenue. It is understood that in actual fact ’Agha ’Abdi is the Shaikh’s representative of both Hindian and Zaitan but that Mir Abdullah still continues to control the tribes from Deh Mullah to Zaitan, whilst ’Agha ’Abdi holds himself responsible for those between Deh Mullah and the sea. MC164CGS153 Fighting in these parts is not a common occurrence, but about 25 years ago, when Mir Fadhl, a powerful Chief of the Shuraifat, was to all intents and purposes Chief of the Hindian dstrict, he incurred the jealousy of Shaikh Khaz al, who bribed the Bakhtiari to attack him, the result of which was that Mir Fadhl was killed. Mir Abdullah was appointed by the Shaikh to succeed him, but some 10 years ago he was attacked and driven out by Mir 5 Ali and Mir J abir, the sons of Mir Fadhl. Mir Abdullah fled to Bandar Dilam and for the next two years the district was ruled by Mir Fadhl’s sons. Shaikh Khaz al, how ever, then despatched Mullah ’Abdul Saiyid from Ahwaz with troops and guns to attack Mir ’Ali and Mir Jabir, who were com pelled to flee to the Jarrahi district. Mir Abdullah was reinstated by the Shaikh. Mir Jabir now controls the Qanawati sections in the Jarrahi district, whilst his brother lives in retirement in the same district. Of other hostilities entered upon by these tribes it is recorded that all to a man joined the Shaikh in his attack on the Bani Turuf about 3 years before the war. It is said that they have an undying hatred for the Bani Turuf and would at all times sup port the Shaikh against the Bani Turuf, if called upon to do so. The tribes are moderately contented and are particularly satisfied with the appointment of ’Agha ’Abdi, preferring him to Mir Abdullah. They are not overtaxed, though they claim that higher revenue is demanded from them annually.162 AL KATHIR (CHATHIR)—. An important Arab tribe of Northern ’Arabistan, which inhabits the country between the Shatait branch of the Karun and the Karkheh, Owing to the fact that in addition to these rivers the Gargar, the I)h and the Shaur run through their lands, cultivation is good and cattle and buffaloes plentiful. The tribe was originally divided into two Baits, Bait Sa’ad under Shaikh Farhan al ’Asad and Bait Karim under Shaik Haidar ibn ’Ali. These two Baits were frequently considered as separate tribes. Whether this was or was not the case, the two Shaikhs undoubtedly controlled the policy of Northern ’ Arabistan. Since their exile the two Baits have been brought under the power of the Shaikh of Muhammarah and are ruled as one tribe by his agent, Khalaf ibn Shinaiyir. Most of the sections of this tribe are offshoots of the Bani Lam, a factor worthy of comment, lest there should ever occur fighting in which the Bani Lam supported one side and the Shaikh of Muhammarah the other. There has always been a long continued antagonism between Shaikhs Farhan and Haidar ; this reached a climax in 1904, when Haidar was defeated and plundered. On this occasion Farhan received the support of the Sagwand, but Haidar made relations with that tribe by marriage and w^as able to count on them for assistance. In 1908 Haidar with the aid of the Sagwand and the moral support of the Shaikh of Muhammarah thoroughly defeated Farhan and regained the support of his Bait, which had largely deserted his cause. . In September, 1915, during the war Haidar was not only suspected of secretly instigating raids against Farhan but also of being responsible for cutting the pipe line. Farhan on the other hand appeared to have cast in his lot with the British. In August, 1916, Haidar was attacked by our troops and his camp burnt; he himself, however, managed to escape to the Pusht-i- Kuh, since which date he has never returned to the Bait Karim. Khuraibit ibn Ali al Ghafil was appointed Shaikh of the tribe in August, 1917, but was subsequently removed and fled in 1922 joining Haidar in the territory of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Farhan remained with Bait Sa’ad till 1922, when he too was compelled to flee and took refuge with the Bakhtiari at Ab Bid. he two Baits, therefore, have both come under the complete control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah. tv- 6 Sa’ad were responsible for the insecurity ^ e i z; M-Shushtar road. Bait Sa’ad is frequently known as Al Kathir of Shushtar.\ 1(16 AL KHAMLS— A1 Khamis, i.e., sons of five, is an Arab tribe of little import ance inhabiting the districts of Ramuz and Fallahiyah. The tribe is under the rule of the Bakhtiari, to whom they puy revenue. About 1840 they migrated to the country between Hawizah and the Karun, but they have since returned to their own lands. /.BANI LAM. A powerful tribe, which is best known in the ’Amarah Liwa of ’Iraq. The tribe claims close relationship with the Lam Turuf in that both are descended from Hatim , ai of the Hedjaz, famous as the most hospitable man of the age. xhe connection is reached as follows: Hatim. Naw war. Turuf. * Lam. If this assumption is correct, the two tribes, which lie side by side and have never been under the complete control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, are unlikely to be really hostile to one another, and such a powerful combination must not be over looked, though owing to tribal jealousies, tends and greed on behalf of the tribes and sections for extension of lands, the two tribes need never be considered seriously as one powerful and combined force. They would, however, in ail probability join together, if the occasion arose, in opposition to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. In addition to the sections as recorded in the subsequent lists a large number of the present tribes of Arabistan are of Bani Lam origin, notably Cha’b al Bubals, Cha b al Sitatlah and other sections of Al Kathir, Marawunah, Albu Ruwayah and other small tribes, which outwardly have no connection with the Bani Lam. Of the sections mentioned in the lists as Bani Lam the majority are gradually drifting away and being treated as separate tribes. The Chenanah and Khazraj alone retain their close connection with the Bani Lam, and will always create dis content between their Shaikh Ghadhoan and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. It is very unlikely that any of these tribes and sections of Bani Lam origin would ever take up arms against their own tribe. The Bani Lam, therefore, with its sections spread over Northern ’Arabistan and the Bani Turuf could form a combined opposition to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, which160 it would be difficult for him to break ; the possibility however is improbable. Of the Chiefs, Shaikh Ghadhban al Bunaiyan alone out- stands as a leader and a danger to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and his tribe. At present, however. Shaikh Ghadhban’s control over the Bani Lam in ’Arabistan is very doubtful, though during the war he undoubtedly influenced the Chenanah and Khazraj sections in spite of his assertion in 1915 that he had no authority over them. Until quite recently he was deposed from his tribe but he was reinstated in 1922 and given land in the Amarah district. His sole object, which he openly admits, is to regain his lost section, the Chenanah and Kha/.raj. The- Shaikh of Muhammarah, however, is working against him and presents of money and clothes to the Chiefs are helping towards their throwing in their lot with him. But, as is the case with all tribes, in times of peace they follow the man, who can give them most, whilst in war if their own tribe is engaged tbev follow their tribe. f177 marawuneh. An unimportant tribe, now settled on the Karun, which claims to be an offshoot of the Bani Lam. The tribe is now under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, to whom their revenue is paid.MUHAISIN. A settled tribe of Southern ’Arabistan, whose Chief is the Shaikh of Muhammarah. Part live in Persian territory and part in ’Iraq on the banks of the Shatt al ’Arab, where they are occupied in the cultivation of dates. The whole tribe would undoubtedly follow the Shaikh of Muhammarah, though their peaceful mode of living is gradually depriving them of the wild, restless spirit so characteristic of the Arab tribe and it is doubt ful if their support would be of great assistance to the Shaikh, if opposed to tribes who live by the sword or to an organised European force. The tribe is said to be descended from a certain man, Muhaisin, and his son-in-law Kasib. These individuals, according to tradition, belong to a tribe of the Muhammarah district which was compelled to emigrate by the encroachments of the Cha’b and settled on the Tigris under the name of Al Hussain Pasha. Kasib and Muhaisin with some followers, having purchased some land in the neighbourhood of the modern Muhamnfarah from the Cha’b, eventually returned to settle near the original seat of the tribe, and the headship of the tribe which they founded remained in the family of Kasib. Haji Yusuf ibn Mardau, a descendant of Kasib, ultimately became Governor of Muhammarah on behalf of the Cha’b Shaikh and his son. Haji Jabir was Shaikh of Muhammarah when it was occupied by British troops in 1857. After the peace between Britain and Persia, Haji Jabir was made inde pendent of the Cha’b Shaikh by a Persian Prince, the Ihtisham- ud-Dauleh, who governed the province; and after the Cha’b Shaikh had been captured and sent to Teheran, the Fallahiyah district was added to Haji Jabir’s dominions. Constant fighting ensued between the Muhaisin and the Cha’b, in which the Dris section of the Cha’b inhabiting the island of ’Abadan sided with the Muhaisin. In 1860 Zia-ul-Mulk, the Persian Governor of ’Arabistan, countenanced the Cha’b party, and the result was the seizure and temporary removal of Haji Jabir to Teheran ; two years later, however, having been released, he was reinstated with the title of JSTusrat-al-Mulk by Prince Farshad Mirza, the new Persian Governor. From this time onwards the Cha’b Shaikhs have never been entirely free of Muhaisin control. Haji Jabir180 died in 188 i ; his successes were largely due to the fighting qualities of his son Visa, who pre-deceased him. Haji Jahir was succeeded by his son Miza’l who, by playing off one pretender to the Shaikhship of Fallahiyah against the other, and putting in first one rival and then another as Shaikh, succeeded in becoming paramount Shaikh of the Muhaisin and Cha’b tribes. The hereditary Wali of Hawizah, who formerly ruled the whole country between the Karun and Tigris, also fell under the power of Miza’l. Miza’l received from the Persian Government the title of Mu’izz-ul-Saltaneh. He fell a victim in 1897 to a conspiracy organised by his cousin Salman ibn Mansur, to which most of the tribal Shaikhs were privy. Khaz’al, the youngest and only surviving son of Haji Jabir, succeeded his brother. The title of Mu’izz-ul-Saltaneh was continued in his favour, and to it was added the military title of Sardar-i-Aqdas. By this time the Cha’b Shaikhdom was broken up and finally extinguished in 1898, when the Muhaisin inherited the Cha’b possessions from the Karun to Hindian. During the war the Muhaisin may be considered the only tribe in ’Arabistan that was consistently loyal to the British and the Shaikh of Muhammarah, whose interests were one. In 1915 when a jihad was being preached at the instigation of the Turks and all tribes of ’Arabistan were in a state of rebellion, the Muhaisin on two occasions went out to fight for the cause of the British and the Shaikh, first against the Bawieh, who had cut the pipe line and secondly against the Cha’b, who, though they had made no active opposition, had adopted an attitude su re bellious that the Shaikh considered it unwise to allow them to remain unpunished. It is possible that he feared lest the old rivalry between the Cha’b and Muhaisin would recur and that if the Cha’b received assistance from the Bawieh, whose atti tude at that time was doubtful, they would regain their former supermacy and entirely wipe out the Muhaisin. Though the Shaikh knew that he had the support of the British, he also realised that the British needed all their forces to attack the Turks, and therefore his wisest policy was to strike first. In the action against the Cna’b in June, 1915, the Muhaisin gained a decisive victory. As regards their numbers on this occasion it was estimated that the Muhaisin put a force of 3,000 in the field. This is lesa\ 181 than half the number of able bodied men, as recorded in the subsequent lists, but it must be remembered that no tribe would ever put all its men into the field and possibly not more than two-thirds, that possibly not more than that number were armed and that the Muhaisin are a settled tribe of cultivators, a large number of whom live quietly on the banks of the Shatt al ’Arab between Basrah and Fao, and for that reason would be unlikely to go to war with as large a percentage of their men as tribes of the nature of the Bani Turuf or Bani Lam. All credit, however, is due to Shaikh Khaza’l and the Muhaisin for their loyalty to the British during the war. Shaikh Khaza’l’s heir is his eldest son, Shaikh Chasib, who is unpopular with the tribesmen, but whoever their Chief it is doubtful if the Muhaisin would ever desert the British, if only for the sake of retaining their lands on the Shatt al ’Arab* \ 186 ALBU RUWAIYAH. A small tribe that lias settled on the right bank of the Karun and is controlled by the Shaikh of Muhammarah. The tribe, like its neighbour, the Marawuhneh, claims to have come from the ’A mar ah district in ’Iraq and to have been originally a section of the Bani Lam. *188 SAGWAND. One of the principal tribes of the Bala Gir?eh Confederation^ who in autumn pour into the plains of Bizful, advancing as far south as Shush. Certain sections of the tribe are found in the Dizful district at all times of the year. During the war a vast amount of ruffianism and extortion was experienced at the hands of the Lurs, and partly owing to their proximity to Shush and therefore their accessibility to our troops and partly owing to their extortion of 1,300 tomans from a British caravan and a theft of eleven mules the Sagwand were successfully punished in Aprd, 1916. In 1917 an attempt was made to redeem the tribe from an irresponsible rabble into a bodv of men under some measure of discipline and a force of mounted police, known as the Sagwand Levy was formed to maintain order in the neighbourhood of Dizful and the roads leading in and out of it. Organised on Persian lines this force of 45 mounted men, drawn from the Sagwands, was trained by a British officer. A shadow of this force is still in existence in the form of sowars provided for the use of the Deputy Governor of Dizful. The tribe, however, still retains its raiding characteristics and in 1920 much trouble was experienced in this respect with the Khazraj and Chenanah sections of the Bani Lam. In 1921 Sadiq Khan, Chief of the sections in the Dizful area, was dismissed by Muayyid ad Dowlah, the Governor-General of ’Arabistan, who appointed Mir ’Ah Khan and lleza Khan in his place. The immediate result of this action was that Mir ’Ali Khan was killed and at least 3,000 Sagwand left with Sadiq Khan. In the spring of 1922 the Lur tribes were fighting amongst one another over Sadiq Khan ; he has, however, since returned.191 SALAMAT. A small unimportant tribe in the Ahwaz district, which ic politically allied to the Bawieh and would follow that tribe in war.■5 193 BANI SALIH. A considerable tribe of partly marshmen and partly cultiva tors of wheat and barley, which is to be found /the HawS distnet. Owing however to its proximity to the Bani Tmuf it is alined to be overshadowed by that tribe, which it w2 m aU probability follow in war. It is allied to the smallerlribe Shurafah, which is dependent of the Bani Salih. It is said that a great niimber of tribesmen from the ’Aniarah illTsS y m ' 8 10 ‘ he Ha ™ h distlict «“&gt; w-S .k Th k ^ P ^V. tS ” V ™ l,e to the Shaikh of Sfuhammarah through his agent Shaikh Sahar umaran MC164CGS196 SHURAFAH/! f/H ^r ; v I &lt;* m A small tribe which has settled in the Hawizah district and allied itself to the Bani Salih. The tribe claims to have migrated originally from the Hedjaz, and it is asserted that it wasj part of the Bani Hussain section of Al Dhafir, a nomadic tribe^ on the borders of the Muntafiq.199 BANI TAMIM oe BANI MALIK. A numerous tribe that claims to be descended from the G azaiwi family of Damascus, from where they came and settled in the Shatrah district of the Muntaiiq. Prom here they are said to have been driven out by Shaikh ’Ajil al Sa’dun and moved to Hawizah, where they encountered the Bmd Tumf who drove them on further to the lands between Hawizah and the Karan. In this territory the tribe has since remained with tne exception of a few sections, who settled in the Hindian district. Up to a few years back the Bani Turuf and Bani Tamim were constantly at war with each other, but their differences are said be now settled. Long-standing feuds, however, are not lightly forgotten, and it is doubtful if the two tribes would unite in a common cause unless against an invading force, from which the lands ox both were in danger. The tribe is more settled than the Bani Turuf or the Bani Lam, tor though the majority of the tribesmen are nomadic and wander with their sheep and camels to the most suitable grazing lands m their area, a great many of the tribe encamp on the left bank of the*Shatt al ’Arab in the date season between Nashwah and La aiji, where they own date plantations. In the early days of the war, when the tribes of ’Arabistan were affected by the jihad, the Bani Tamim threw in their lot against the British and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. They did not appear to have taken any active part in the ILhtin^ against our troops, as the Bani Turuf, but they acted with treachery, which caused them to be treated as our enemies.215 A small and unimportant tribe of Southern ’Arabistan that is politically allied to the Bawieh. Qasim ’Ali was their Chief during the war; he was, however, considered one of the mainsprings of unrest in the summer of 1916, his dependants having committed a raid on the Shushtar-Abgah road in June, and was arrested in September of the same year. His arrest had no adverse effect on the attitude of his tribe.217 CHAPTER VII W ; Personalities I he object of this chapter is to introduce persons, who may General, be of importance from a military, political or commercial point of view, thus rendering assistance not only to officers in com- mand of troops but also to others, who may be required to act as Intelligence officers, Local Purchase Officers, etc., in the districts. Though in many instances the present or past political attitude of individuals is recorded, the fact must not be over looked that but for very exceptional cases a native of the pro vince can be, either, bought over, or, controlled through the medium of Shaikh Khaz’al, Shaikh of Muhammarah. Bearing this in mind, then, past or present actions of such persons may be of no greater use than to support the almost invariably correct theory that an Eastern will follow where he expects to find most gain for himself. Owing to the vast extent of the area and the likelihood of useful individuals being overlooked in the time of need, an index is appended to this chapter, in which is shown against the name of each person the district to which he belongs. In both the chapter and the index names are tabulated in alphabetical order. Abd-al-Saiyid, Mullah-. —Governor of Ahwaz in 1914. Personalities.

In 1901 he returned to Persia and obtained the post of Director of imperial Customs at Shushtar, which he held till 1907. At the end of that year he moved to Ahwaz, where he has since remained as Interpreter to the Imperial Bank of Persia. He is very intelligent and well educated, speaking and writing English fairly well. Of a jovial and sociable temperament, and seeks the acquaintance and friend ship of Europeans.

Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, a verbal undertaking to seize and hand over any German agents attempting to come to the town. He was responsible for the looting of the Shushtar bazaar in the autumn of 1916. On the appointment of a political officer to Shushtar in December 1916 he made his usual protestations of loyalty, but was soon found intriguing and deported to Basrah in February 1917, and thence to India as an officer prisoner of war. On his return from India he was sent to Kermatishah ’ and is now living in Teheran. He is a large landowner and belonged to the pro- Bakhtiari party in Shushtar. A plausible and pleasant manner conceals the monster that he really is. One of his brothers, Agha Saiyid, was sentenced to death and shot in November220 Chasib Khan ibn Khaz’al Khan, Sardar Jr/a’a.—Shaikh Khaz’al’s eldest son and heir, and was born in 1891. In Mll- 13 he was Governor of Ahwaz but was said to be neglectful an d puerile. In 1919 he was appointed Governor of Muham- marah but was removed by his father in 1921, when he was suspected of plotting against the life of the Shaikh, who since that date has kept a careful watch on his movements, in 1915, during the war, he led a successful expedition against the rebellious Cha’b, for which he gained a certain amount of kudos. Unpopular and a man easily influenced by stronger minds, but has a pleasant gentlemanly manner. Speaks English. He is now (1923) in Paris undergoing medical treat- ment. Dirchal, Shaikh ,—Previously chief of the Abdul Khan section of Bani Lam, when he lived on the Ahwaz-Dizful road some 22 miles south of Shush. During the war he rendered great assistance to the British troops and made much money from hiring out transport, etc. He is not a strong man,, and has always been disliked by the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who deposed and exiled him. He is not on good terms with Shaikh Ghadhban, with whom he had a blood feud. He is now living under the protection of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Fakhr-ul-Muhaqiain. —A saiyid from Teheran, who has lately taken up his residence at Shushtar. , He was sent there to take away from the priests the property dedicated for reli gious purposes, to manage the properties ana to spend the money on education. About 12 years ago he was an Islamic missionary at Bombay, but his offices were closed owing to, it is believed, his mixing in politics. Farhan A! \Asad.— Born about 1850. From an early age he was head of the Brit Sa’ad Arabs, also known as A1 Kathir of Shushtar. His Headquarters were at Qaleh Muchaisir on the left bank of the Diz below Deh Nam Originally power ful and independent, but after many vicissitudes in complete subjection to the Shaikh of Muhammarah to whom he paid his revenue. His tribe together with the Bakhtiaris were responsible for the insecurity of the Shushtar-Dizful road. In 1922 he was compelled to flee from his tribe and has since taken up his residence with the Bakhtiaris. In November of the same year he was encamped at Ab Bid, the property of the Bakhtiari, between Shushtar and Dizful. He is a broken,221 pathetic old man, sodden with opium, and appears to have lost all control over the mixed tribal elements under him, even before his flight. Falhi, Bait. —Dizfulis. Important merchants at Ahwaz, Feraiyah ihn Faisul. —Chief of Cha’b al Sitatlah section of A1 Kathir. Always in league with Haidar ibn Talayal, whom he assisted against Farhan al 4 Asad in August 1917, and then induced Haidar ibn ’Ali to make common cause against us. Both Feraiyah and Haidar ibn Talayal have since made their peace with the Shaikh of Muhammarah and returned to their tribes. Ghadhban ibn Bunaiyan , Shaikh .—Bani Lam. Vide Mili tary Report, Area No. 7. Shaikh Ghadhban, the most power ful shaikh of the ’ Amarah Liwa, is nominally the head of the Bani Lam in ’ Arabistan. Owing to his incessant intri guing during the war he could be trusted by neither the Turks nor ourselves, though he was able to command a large follow ing. Ultimately at the end of the war he tvas outlawed from the ’ Amarah division, living first under the protection of the Shaikh of Muhammarah and later in Baghdad till in 1922 he was permitted to return to ’ Amarah and was given the centre portion of the Bait Madhkur lands on the left bank of the Tigris, the object in this being to keep him as far as possible from the Chenanah and Khazraj sections of the Bani Lam in ’Arabistan, lest by his intriguing he should created trouble between the Shaikh of Muhammarah with his tribes and the Bani Lam in the ’ Amarah district. The scheme cannot be said to have met with complete success, for Shaikh Ghadhban openly admits that he is endeavouring to regain the confidence and support of the Chenanah and Khazraj. Shaikh Ghadhban and the Shaikh of Muhammarah are never on good terms. Both are clever men and fully capable of controlling tribes under them , but the Shaikh of Muhammarah has the great advantage over Ghadhban in the support of the British Government and his vast wealth, which he uses freely to draw anv doubtful tribes to hit side. The two men are «/ rivals and always will be, though, so long as the British remain in ’Iraq, Shaikh Ghadhban’s hands are tied. Though known to be unreliable and. an inveterate intriguer, Shaikh Ghadhban is notoriously brave and generous, and popular with his tribes men, who have welcomed his return to ’ Amarah. MCI 64CGS222 Ghulam Reza Khan .—Chief of the ’ Amla Lurs and lives at Shush, on the Dizful side, Saifullah Khan, his cousin and also a chief of the tribe, living on the other side of the fort. Relationship between the two men is sometimes strained. The Shaikh of Muhammarah, whose lands they lease, would be pleased to be rid of them, and there are rumours at the present time (1923) that the Shaikh has written to Ghulam Reza Khan asking him to remove his tribe ; the latter, however, is not expected to acquiesce. Ghulam Reza Khan is said to have been one of the main causes of the trouble in 1921 with Sadiq Khan, chief of the Sagwand. Untrustworthy. Habib, Saiyid .—An influential saiyid of Ahwaz. Though a friend of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, he is afraid of him and fails to make use of the power that is his. Haquli, Rabbi .—A Jew Merchant of Muhammarah, who is most popular and trustworthy. Age about 55. Haidar ibn ’AK—Shaikh of A1 Kathir tribe, and in parti cular of the Bait Karim division. His headquarters used to be in the Husainabad tract in the neighbourhood of Shush. A long continued antagonism has existed between him and Shaikh Farhan al ’Asad of the Bait Sa’ad division, which reached a climax in 1904, when Haidar was defeated and plun dered by the latter. On this occasion the Sagwand completed the work commenced by Farhan, but Haidar made relations with the Sagwand by marriage and was therefore able to count on them for a certain amount of assistance. After a chequered period of misfortune, during which he had to reckon among his enemies the Sardar-i-Mukarram and the Shaikh of Muhammarah, he re-established his fortunes in 1908. In that year with the aid of the Sagwand and the moral support of the Shaikh of Muhammarah he thoroughly defeated Shaikh Farhan, and. regained the support of his own tribe, which had largely deserted his cause. During the war there is no doubt that the attitude of Haidar and Farhan influenced that of all tribes of Northern ’Arabistan. In the early part of 1915 Haidar joined Shaikh Ghadhban against the Shaikh of Muhammarah. In June 1916 he made friendly overtures to the Shaikh, but was not met half way, and in August he was attacked by our troops and his camp burnt; he himself, however, managed to escape to the Pusht-i- Kuh. On July 31st, 1917 he returned at the invitation of the223 Political Department to arrange about his future with the Shaikh of Muhammarah. For several years after this he lived in retirement at Ahwaz, but at the end of 1922 he left secretly and attached himself to the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, with whose influence he hopes to become once more Shaikh of Bait Karim, or the Bizful branch of the A1 Kathir. Shaikh Haidar bears a good reputation among Arabs for his personal qualities. He is lackirg, however, in force of character, energy and initiative. He has eight sons. The eldest, Hasan, is of no particular merit, but the second, Abbas, is a friend of the Ahwaz Consulate, and has on occasions given proof of his friend liness. Haidar Ibn Talayal. —A minor chief of A1 Kathir, who was always in league with Feraiyah ibn Faisul. In August 1916 they were defeated at Husainabad and fled to Amir Quli Khan, (Bakhtiari). From there they fled across Northern ’Arabistan, crossed the Karkheh and eventually went to live with Shaikh Ghadhban. In July 1917 they were encamped with a section of the Bani Lam at Madera. In August 1917 they assisted Haidar ibn ’Ali against Farhan al 5 Asad and induced the former to make common cause against us. They have since made their peace with the Shaikh of Muhammarah and returned to their tribes. Hsa, jSaiyid. —The Bam Hormuz revolutionary. Was handed over to the Shaikh of Muhammarah’s people in 1916. He is said to be now living at Kuwait. Ja'far ibn Haji Saiyid 'Abdul Samad, Saiyid. —The most important priest at Ahwaz. He has good influence and is friend ly with the Shaikh and the British. Jawad Khan, Mirza, Wahid-as - 8u ilan eh .—The present Karguzar of Muhammarah. A man of pleasant manners, who seems interested in his work. Karim, Agha. —Son of Haji Qurban ’Ali, a big Shiraz! merchant at Muhammarah, who for many years acted as Collector of Revenue of Muhammarah town. Haji Qurban is now a very old man and for the past three 3 7 ears Agha Karun has held the appointment of Collector of Revenue in place of his father. A favourite of the Shaikh. Khalaf ibn Shinayir. —Agent for the Shaikh of Muhammarah in the Mianab. Very powerful.224 Kharibat, Shaikh. —^Appointed in Shaikh Haidar’s place aa Shaikh of A1 Kathir in August 1917, but was subsequently removed. Remained in retirement for some time but fled with Haidar in 1922 and is at present enjoying the protection of the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh. Khaz'al Khan, Sardar-i-Aqdas, G.C.LE., A.Ch&amp;/.—Shaikh of Muhammarah. The history of the Shaikh is too well known to need repetition in this report, and it can be found in any book on the Personalities of ’Iraq or Persia. He was bom in 1861 and succeeded his brother, Miz’al, to the shaikhdom in 1897. He is to all intents and purposes independent of the Persian Government, though he pays revenue. He has always been con sistently friendly towards the British and, now in his old age, depends on British advice to a far greater extent than before. He is a capable and sensible man, though the brain that governs ’Arabistan is to be found chiefly in his right hand man, Haji Muhammad ’Ali Behbehani, Rais ut Tujjar. His influence reaches as far as Dizful, where even the Lurs fear him. He owns much territory in Traq. He is not popular with his tribes, but his support by the British, his wealth and his suppression of them allow him to retain his power over them. In his dealings with his tribes his purpose appears to be to break the power of any Shaikh or tribe that is becoming powerful and may later be a danger to his own power, and to replace the Shaikh by an agent of his own selection, who governs the tribe and collects revenue from it. These agents belong to no tribe and are really administrative officials o wing allegiance to no one but the Shaikh, although generally connected by marriage with prominent tribal Shaikhs. In spite of his power he undoubt edly lives in fear of his life. Mackenzie ibn Mushattat .—Shaikh of the Sarkhah section of Bani Lam, and lives in the area west of Shush between the Shaur and Karkheh. Friendly towards the British.

He was eventually transferred to the Judicial Department, Basrah, and later to Kerbala, as Assistant Poli tical Officer, and from there to Hillah as President of the Law Courts. At his own request he was sent back to Basrah, when he resigned. He is now oriental secretary to Sir Arnold Wilson, Managing Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and local managing agent for the properties in ’Iraq of the Shaikh of Muhammarah and in Basrah of the Daniel family. Of indepen dent opinion and very outspoken. Imbued with a strong sense of justice which he does not conceal. Strongly pro-British.

A native of Behbeban, but has resided at Muhammarah for over twenty years. Was the right hand man of the late Shaikh Miz ? ai and is said to have been implicated in the plot resulting in his murder. He now conducts the whole of the Shaikh of Muhammarah’s affairs and possesses great influence over him ; he is also agent for the Muin-ut-Tujjar. In 1902 he travelled to Teheran to settle the Shaikh’s difficulties over the establish ment of the Belgian Customs at Muhammarah. He has toured over the greater part of India, including the Native States of Central India. In 1914 he was decorated with the C. I. E. In addition to his political work with the Shaikh he is an important merchant. His influence in South West Persia is very considerable, though he is much disliked and distrusted by the Arabs. He is especially pleasant to Europeans. Though he is a little past his day now, the fact cannot be overlooked that the unbroken relations between the British and the Shaikh of Muhammarah are largely due to him. Muhammad Baqir ibn Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, Shaikh. ■—An extremely fine type of Muslim divine, who shares all the good qualities of his father. Previous to the war he acted as agent for the British at Dizful; he is now the principal member of his family and probably the most influential man in Dizful after Haji Shaikh Muhammad Ridha, Hujjat al Islam.

He refuses to interfere in law suits and civil disputes, as other priests. Has adopted a friendly attitude towards the British. Muhammad Bidha, Shaikh, Hujjat-al-Islam .—Bom about 1852. The religious leader in Dizful and a man of scholastic attainments. He commands considerable influence and respect among the people. He keeps from entanglement with the local cliques, and devotes his efforts rather towards promoting the general welfare of the people. A cousin of Shaikh Muhammad Baqir. Muhammad Teaman Khan .—The principal notable of the pro- Muhammarah faction in Shushtar; possessed of no property, he lived as head of a quarter and its gang of roughs, by extor tion and violence.

Mushar-ed-Dowlah .—Appointed Governor-General of ’Ara- bistan in October 1922 in succession to Muayyid-ad-Dowlah« He came from Bushire with a good reputation, which he continues to deserve. He is head and shoulders above previous Governors- General of Arabistan in character, education and ability. Mushar at Taj jar, Haji. Eldest son of Haji ’Ali Behbe- hani, Rais-at-Tujjar. In 1903 he travelled rid India to Mecca, He has been to Europe and speaks English, and like his father is very pleasant and friendly to the British. He accompanies his father on his tours, now that his father is getting on in years and takes a great deal of his work off his shoulders. He has a younger brother, Muhammad Agha, aged about 19, who assists his father with his commercial correspondence. Age about 40,228 Na’amatallah, Haji Saitjid.—Agent lor the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Ram Hormuz, where he was sent during t e war. Pappi, Mullah.—A salaried post letter writer at Shush during the war to the troops. An intelligent and somewhat travelled Lur, who spent much of his youth in Baghdad. He is much respected locally and has been of considerable assistance to both the Military and Political in many ways, not the least in that he is a listener and gathers much information. - He previously lived with Saifullah’s section but was continually falling out with him, and in July 1917 with the consent of Saifullah he transferred to Ghulam Reza Khan’s section. Parvis Khan.—Of Gundazlu tribe. Chief guard of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Dar-i-Khazinah. Quit Khan —A Shushtar ndtable of the usual type. Illi terate, penniless and a drunkard.

In 1916 he was concerned with Baqir Khan in looting the bazaar. In Februarj^ 1917 he displayed considerable courage in arrest ing with his own hands a notorious desperado concerned with his own son in the murder of a brother notable. He was exiled to Ahwaz from 1918 to 1921. Sadiq Khan .—Chief of the Sagwand tribe, v/hich spends the winter months in the Dizful district on the right bank of the Ab-i-Diz opposite Dizful town. In 1913-14 he sided with the British over the railway survey. In February 1916 he with Chiragh ’Ali were the chief ringleaders in the blackmailing of Captain Noel’s party ; they were raided by Sartip Khan and later taken in by Mezban Khan. The late Governor- General of ’Arahistan, Muayyid-ad-Dowlah, dismissed Sadiq Khan in 1921 and put in his place Mir ’Ali Khan and Reza Khan. Mir ’Ali Khan was shortly killed and Najaf Khuli Khan appointed in his place. The immediate result of Sadiq Khan’s dismissal was that at least 3,000 Sagwand left with him and the tribe, being split up, lost its importance. In the spring of 1922 the Lur tribes were fighting with each other over Sadiq Khan; he has returned to his tribe since the resignation of Muayyid-ad- Dowlah. •^ — 229 He i3 feared by all the Sag wand and is an enemy of Ohulam Reza Khan, one of the two chiefs of the ’Amla.

Considering the population of ’Arabistan, which comprises Gsnera • merely gricultural and pastoral tribes having no use for any method of communication except tracks suitable for camel and donkey caravans and canals that are deep enough iO£ mahailahs, communication i exceptionally good and for this the country if indebted first to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a d secondly to British occupation during the war. As regards roads, motor traffic can be driven in the dry season to all the more important places of the province with the excep tion of the south-east districts, where hov/ever military trans port is less likely to be required. After rain roads are always impassable for motor traffic for three or four days and sometimes for a longer period. River communication is disappointing with the number of large rivers in the province, the Karim being the only navigable river and that being so blocked at Ahwaz that t is necessary to tranship here. Of telegraphic and telephonic communication the Persian Government runs telegn ph wires to the more important places, whilst the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have telephones at all their stations, which exist between Muhammarah and' Dar-i- Xhazinah via Ahwaz with many smaller intermediate stations to the oil fields, betwe n uhammarah and Abadan and between Ahwaz and Kandaq on the roan to Ram Hormuz. II oil is discovered at Dehluran additional telephonic communication will be made from there (o Ahwaz, probably pas ing through Dizful. With these lines in existence it would be no difficult matter for the Military authorities., if the occasion arose, to construct other lines. o; The recognised route from the Persian Gulf to 5 Arabist an is ccnimimlcation along the Shatt-al-’Arab as far as Muhammarah, where large with the sea. steamers anchor in mid-stream and discharge cargo into lighters or barges. Half a dozen of these are generally available at Muhammarah, and more could be brought down from Basrah, if required. Only ships drawing 20 ft.-or less o n ordinarily cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab and enter the river. The British India Steam Company’s Beats can carry MCJ64CGS234 about 1,000 men and 200 horses, though the actual numbers vary with each boat. The Bahmanshir, a tidal stream parallel to the Shatt-al- 5 Arab is passable at all times by native craft. It may also be mentioned here that the ports of BIndian and Dilam ahoi^l a quick route from the sea lo Behbehan, but other considerations prevent these ports from being of much military importance for the actual landing of troops ; for supplying troops at Behbehan, however, these two ports, especially the latter, would be invaluable. In order to land cargo at Hindian, ocean going steamers would have to anchor at least 4 miles from the coast. The ports af Buzieh and Ma’shur are similarly of little value for landing tr ops, but useful for supplying troops at Ramuz, if for any other reason the Muhammarah-Kasiri-Ramuz line is not available. Inland water. The Karun offers the only reliable line of communication, vide, River Routes, and a force of 5,000 men could be rapidly transported from Muhammarah to Ka si ri and t hence to Shush- tar. The rapids at Ahwaz cause transhipment necessary and at this point it might be well to mention that steamers and barges can only be towed across the rapids during three months of the year, from March to May inclusive. The type of boat which would be used on the Karun between Muhammarah and x4hwaz is capable of carrying from four to eight hundred men and from 350 to 650 tons according to the size of the boat; in this estimate is included the carrying capa city of the two barges towed on either side. Sleeping accom modation, however, for that number of men could not be pro vided, but as the river could only he navigated by day, the troops could sleep on shore, a step in itself desirable as a tactical pre caution. A small force of cavalr}^, if the situation demanded, could escort the steamer on both banks. By utilising the ship, however, to carry all the baggage and sending the troops by land, a force of at least 1,000 men could march up the river drawing supplies every evening from the ship, which would tie up at previously arranged places. Ahwaz could thus be reached in 4 days, and a similar system could be utilised between Ahwaz and Shilaili, 8 miles south of Shushtar.235 In the reach between Kut Abdullah and Ahwaz, when the water is low, it is sometimes impossible for any steamer to pro ceed, in which case arrangements would have to be made for the transport of troops and stores by land, vide Chapter VIII, River routes. Between Ahwaz and Shushtar generally not more than one barge is towed ; two, however, are possible, though in certain parts it would be necessary to detach one from the steamer owing to the narrowness of the channel. Navigation on the Diz is possible, though difficult, as far as Reh-i-Nau, 20 miles from Dizful, vide Chapter II, Ab-i-Diz. The same type of vessel would be used on this river as on that between Ahwaz and Shushtar. # Details are given below of the largest steamers, which it would be advisable to ply on the Karim, [a) between Muhammarah and Ahwaz, and {b) between Ahwaz and Shilaili. (a) Paddle Ambulance .—Length 226 feet. Breadth 52 * 9 feet. Draught 4 * 8 feet. Barges. (A class).—Length 180 feet. Breadth 24 feet. Draught 3 feet. Carrying capacity of barge 200 tons. (b) Stern Wheeler .— Length 110 feet. Breadth 22 feet. Draught 3 * 2 feet (3 * 6 in high water). The above dimensions are not of the boats in daily use but of the largest, which could be used on the Karun. With only one barge a steamer on the upper Karun could not carry more than 80 tons. Regarding native craft plying on the Karun, vide River routes, No. I. A very short summary concludes the water ways of 'Ara- bistan, 11 of which are of minor importance. Between Muiiammarah and Khalfabad small boats can be used for baggage, the boat 3 being manhandled for 5 or 6 yards over the dam at Khazinah.236 Methods oi travelling. Jtftihmy* Telegraphs telephones. Deh Mulla can be reached by bellam from Hindian. Buzieh has communication by water with Khalfabad, whence it is only two short stages to Ramuz. Bellams drawing not more than 2 ft. draught sail regularly between Muhammarah and Fallahiyah via the Marid-Fallahiyah canal, covering the distance in about 12 hours. Although motor transport is a common sight on the road running alongside the Karun, it is very seldom that the native uses it; a few taxis, however, are in use between Ahwaz and Muhammarah or Shushtar. Launches plying between Ahwaz and Muhammarah and Ahwaz and Slmshtar are used to a great extent by the merchants. In December 1922 an unsuccessful attempt was made to run a launch between Ahw az and DizfuL For the tribesmen the horse and donkey are still the chief method of travelling by road, and the mahailah or bellam by water. No railways exist in ’Arabistan, though previous to the war it was proposed to construct a railway from Muhammarah to Burujird by way of DizfuL Survey work was attempted before the outbreak of the war but the tribesmen threw many obstacles in the way of surveyors, who were therefore unable to make much progress. • A light railway, owned by the Angio-Persian Oil Company, Exists at Ahwaz for conveying cargo from Nasiri to Ahvaz and runs on the tramway line, which is the property of Muin-at- Tujjar. This railway affects the transhipment necessary on account of the rapids at Ahwaz. Apart from the telegraph and telephone lines of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, which follow the pipe line, the telegraph system of ’Arabistan is entirely under Persian management. An Engineer of the Indo-European telegraphic depaitment is usually responsible for the maintenance and repair of the line itself, his headquarters being either at Ahwaz or Bushire. He is not allowed to interfere with the actual administration. Messages can be transmitted in Eng'ish characters to all telegraph offices in ’Arabistan with the exception of those on the Bandar-Nasiri-Bandar-Rig line. The Persian telegraph line commencing at Muhammarah on the right bank of the Karim crosses to the left bank at Marc!237 and proceeds thence to Ahwaz, Band-i-Qir, Arab Hasan, Shush- tar, Dizful and Shush with stations at these places. From Ahwaz a branch line runs to Eamuz, Bandar Rig, Rehbehan and Bushire, The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have telegraph stations at Abadan, Muhammarah, Dercjuaim, Kut-Abdullah, Ahwaz, Mulla Than!, Darikhazinah, Tembih and Maidan-i-Naftun. * In addition the Compan}^ has telephonic communication between Muhammarah and Abadan, and Muhammarah and Ahwaz with intermediate stations at Bahmanshir, Marid, Dor- quaim, Makkam Hazbeh, Arab Marid, Swaiyah and Kut Abdullah. Beyond Ahwaz to Maidan-i-Naftun. Telephone stations are found at Zirqan, Wais, Mullah Than!, Haddam, Ab-Gunjik Ruhidar, Tembih and Maidan-i-Naftun. A branch line runs from Haddam to Kandak with an intermediate station at Mutailif. From Darikhazinah a telephone line runs only to Abgah, Tembih and Maidan-i-Naftun. The names of all the above places are shown on the map at the end of the book. The postal service is under the Persian Government with Postal, offices at Muhammarah, Ahwaz, Dizful and Shush tar. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have their own private postal service. Aerodromes prepared and used during the war exist at the Aei ’ 0,lr0m63fl following places but since the evacuation of the British have been neglected. (1) Muhammarah — [а) Situation.

C. motor road to Mamutain and immediately alongside it and about 1,000 yards W.-N.-W. of Pai-Gaeh mosque. The bearing from this piece of ground on Ramuz is 135. The size of the aerodrome would be approximately 300 X 200. It is, however, possible that this landing ground would be too close to the hills, which are only 300 yards distant. There is no other available landing ground closer than Mirbacheh, w T here there are low sand hills. There are no wireless stations in ’Arabistan. A station, how ever exists at Maidan-i-Naftah in the Oil Field area. Mirage, which is experienced at all times of the year, is most intensive in March and April, when visibility is sometimes res tricted to half a mile. At Ahwaz !ow r hills are found, from wflich communication by helio to the surrounding district and notably to Wais mounds, though not to Band-i-Qir, could be used to advantage. Shush fort is another advantageous position for241 hello work. In the event of operations extending to the imme diate vicinity of the Oil Fields helio communication could pro bably be obtained from Tulbuzoon hill, 5 miles from|the Oil Fields along a road fit for motor lorries, with Kandak^at the foot of the hills on the Ramuz plain, with Tulkhayiat, a hill S.-W. of Tulbuzoon, behind which lies Darakhazinah, and with Osmali, a saddle shaped hill at the foot of which is the Gurgir plain ; Malamir lies behind the hills on the left of Osmali. Principal Routes. A. By land. | (1) Basrah to Muhammarah. —22 miles. 1 stage. General. —This route which is a mere motor track strikes out from Tanumah camp in an easterly direction across the desert running the whole distance to Muhammarah within 1J miles of the date gardens fringing the Shatt-al-Arab. The road cannot be used during the rains and owing to some very heavy going will take longer to be fit for traffic than the usual desert road. The road is not important from a military point of view, as troops and military equipment can be transported by river with very little difference in time. Water. —Ail. Supplies .—ML Fuel. —ML Grazing, —Nil. Inhabitants. —Muhaisin, who are settled on the bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. Camping grounds. —Ample room immediately outside the town of Muhammarah and at Tanumah camp. (2) Basrah to Ahwaz (Aniniyak ),—75 miles, (approx.L General. —This road also leads out of Tanumah camp and a back bearing of 208 degrees from the outside bund of the camp on the flag pole of the Consulate gives the direction of the road which is a desert motor track, as 28 degrees. The track is clearly defined and marked along the wffiole rout^ by mounds about 600 yards apart, though in the vicinity of Safhah, where the route runs close to the river on account of cultivation, the track has become indistinct (Dec. 1922) and the mounds are further apart than on the remainder of the route. It is possible, how ever, to obtain a guide from the village of Safhah. MO104CGS .242 This route, though it can only be used by motor transport, m possibly the most important route in ’Arabistan. Armoured cars, military equipment and other stores, which can be carried by motor transport, can arrive at Ahwaz in less than five hours instead of at least three days by river. Sick and wounded may also be evacuated to Basrah in comparative comfort by motor ambulance owing to the excellent surface of the road. The road, however, like all other desert roads, is impassable during the rainy season. It is advisable for spare cars to be run with the convoy and sufficient food and water for at least two days. Water. —Nil, until Safhah is reached, which lies about 1,000 yards from the route on the Karun, and Umm-al-Tumair. Supplies. —Nil, with the same exception as for water, though only a few dates, eggs and chickens would be available. Nil. Camping grounds .—Along the whole route. Communications. —Nil. Inhabitants. —Muhaisin and Bavieh along the banks of the Karun. Along the route till Safhah is reached, no inhabi tants are encountered. Stages .—The road cannot be divided into stages, though it is worthy of note that Safhah is reached approximately 53 miles from Tanumah and Umm-al-Tumair 67 miles. At this point the Basrah-Ahwaz route crosses the U mm-al-Tumair-Hawizah track leaving the village about 600 yards to the right of it. From here it is possible either to follow the track, which meets the Ahwaz-Umm-al -Tumair road along the river bank some 800 yards further or to turn into Umm-al-Tumair and from there proceed to Ahwaz. This alternative, however, is more useful when proceeding from Ahwaz to Basrah, as the turning off the Umm-al-Tumair road between Khoraishan ruins and Umm-at- Tumair might be passed unnoticed ; the old bed of the Kar- kheh in this section makes no formidable obstacle to motor transport. (3) Muhammarah to Abadan. 10J miles. 1 stage. General .—This road starts on the right bank of the Karan opposite the offices of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and con tinues along the river bank till a point is reached opposite the243 bazaar, when it winds for two miles through the date gardens. The road then emerges into the desert and runs direct for Abadan refinery. (4) Muhammarah to Ahwaz (Nasiri ).—71 miles. 4 stages. (via left bank of Karim.) General .—The route, which starts at Haffar, a village of some few huts about 4 miles upstream of Muhammarah and at the extreme end of the date gardens, merely consists of a track across uncultivated ground, passing as a rule, within a mile or so of the left bank of the Karun. The use of this track is chiefly confined to motor traffic of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and messengers moving between Ahwaz and Muhammarah. There is little caravan traffic on the route, as most of the traffic is car ried by boat. After the rains the whole of the country passed over becomes sodden and heavy making the going difficult, and. between Muhammarah and ’Ah ibn Hussain impracticable. The soil on both banks is the same, but the ground on the left bank is more liable to inundation. The route in dry weather is suitable for transport of any description. The only physical obstacle is the passage of the Marid, 8 miles abov e Haffar, where a bridge has been constructed by the A.-P. O. C. for light motor traffic. It lies about 200 yards from the river bank and has a roadway of 10 feet; it could probably be strengthened for guns. When the water is low (i. e., between May and October), the stream is fordable though- the bottom is always muddy ; after the rains have begun the river is often unfordable. There is, however, no reason why troops sent from Muhammarah to Ahwaz should not be ferried to a point upstream of Marid instead of to Haffar. There is also a small crossing at Sal- maneh, but a strong bridge could be thrown across without difficulty. Water .—From the Karun. Supplies .—Supplies may be considered as being non-existent. The few villages along the route lie within 16 miles of Ahwaz, but they could produce nothing more than a few chickens and eggs. Arab encampments during the winter might, if met with, produce some cattle and sheep. »&gt; * Obstacle .—Except at Marid there is no physical obstacle, but from Marid to Salmaneh the road is ge nerally impassable in April and May owing to floods244 Inhabitants. —Arabs of the Muhaisin and Bavieh tribes* The most important shaikhs are Yusef ibn Shawi at Droquaim, Shaikh Marid at Braichah and Jabir ibn Nasir at Mudhafari. Transport.— Vide Chapter IV. (Table on transport.) Fuel. —Scrub plentiful. Grazing. —Scarce. Bridges. —At Marid and Salmaneh. See above. Camping grounds. —Ample on any part of the road. Communications.- —Telegraph from Muhammarah to Ahwaz with intermediate stations at Dorquaim and Kut Abdullah. A.-P. 0. C. private telephone from Muhammarah to Ahwaz with intermediate stations at Marid, Dorquaim, Makkam Hazbeh^ Arab Marid, Swaiyah and Kut Abdullah. From Marid a track goes to Fallahiyah along the canah Rain and Floods. —As mentioned above. Stages. —There is nothing to require the stages being of any particular length, or of their terminating at any particular spots. For the purpose of water some point on the river bank would have to be selected. At about 4 miles after leaving ’Ali ibn Hussain, the road breaks away from the vicinity of the river and runs for 33 miles over waterless country ; this could be avoided by following the river more closely, thus lengthening the journey by 10 to 15 miles. By crossing do the right bank at Umm-al- Tumair the last stage could be very much shortened. The fol lowing stages are suggested. 1 . SALMANEH. 15. 15. General direction N.-E. The track runs between the river and the pipe line the whole distance meeting the pipe line at Marid 8 miles from Haffar. Except the crossing at Marid, already mentioned, no comment need be made on this stage. The most suitable camping ground would be in the first bend above Salmaneh Island. Salmaneh, rather than Marid, is chosen as the first stage owing to the distance of the second stage. 2 . DORQUAIM. 11. 26. General direction N.-N.-E. Dor quaim is situated about 1 mile beyond ’Ali ibn Hussain, the only distinguishing feature of which is three solitary palm trees. Dorquaim is a pumping station in communication with Muhammarah and Ahwaz. s245 3. KXJT ABDULLAH. 37. 63. General direction JNT.-N.-E* . Both the road and the pipe line leave the river here meeting it once more at Knt Abdullah, This route would be impracticable unless the troops could com plete the march of 32 miles, away from the river, in one stage, as there is no water en route. For small bodies of troops arrange ments might be made for water to be sent by lorry to one of the A-P. O. C. intermediate stations at 10 , 10, 29 miles respectively, from Borquaim ; the names, of these stations in order are Makkarq Hasbah, Arab Marid, and Swaizah. 4. AHX^ AZ. 8 . 71. General direction H.-FF.-E. From Kut Abdullah the route follows the river bank closely as tar as Ahwaz, passing two villages and the town of Nasiri. (5) Muhammarak to AJiwaz--S2 miles. 6 stages. (via right bank of Karun). General—A route of little importance in peace time as all traffic goes by river but was used by British troops during the war, since when if has ceased to exist. Ihe report, as given below, was brought up-to-date on July 31st, 1915. The route is liable to become entirely impassable in flood, and usually difficult except from August to November when it is practicable for all arms. Supplies ,—None worth considering. Grazing, Good for camels ; for other animals scarce. Fuel, Obtainable in places, chiefly tamarisk bushes. Alternative routes.—From Muhammarah to Behvali the route on the left bank is generally followed, the Karun being crossed to the right bank at Behvali in Stage 2 . Stages— 1. DAIB ISLAND. 10 . 10. General direction North by East. The road leaves the tov/n of Muhammarah skirting the northern wall, at first in an easterly direction. I he soil is clay and in many places sw 7 ampy ; date plantations occur here and there. At mile 1 the road becomes a meie track across the mud fiat. The country is barren to the nortii, but a belt of cultivation fringes the Karun. At mile 2 ^ the route lies over country which becomes a vast swamp in the MC164CGR\ 246 spring rains. At mile 4| a small village and date plantation are seen about 1 mile to the right. The going after rain is heavy and swampy. At mile 7 Qisbeh a small village of reecis and straw huts is passed, situated on the left bank of a muddy creek, about 50 yards wide and 3 ft. deep, which frequently presents consi derable difficulty in fording. There is usually a site for a camp “three miles further on, opposite Dair Island but the actual site depends on the state of inundation and the state of the river with reference to a suitable place for bringing barges alongside. Grazing for camels is available but for no other animals. The inhabitants are all Muhaisin. Generally speaking this route is rendered impassible during hood seasons, but wffien the Karun river alone is in hood and not the Shatt-ahArab as well it is sometimes possible to fold a land route by making a wdde circuit inland, starting in a nor therly direction, passing two miles east of Manduwan village and then proceeding east and joining the river upstream of the Qisbeh creek. This adds over 4 miles to the distance of the stage. This detour, however, is not passable for wheeled traffic owing to the narrowness of the roadway of two bridges over small canals between Muhammarah and Manduwan. 2. ADHRAT ISLAND. 16. 26. General direction N. to mile 10, then north-east. From here the route is passable for all arms and a motor could do the march at slow speed. The going is soft with treacherous boggy spots. There is a good site far a camp opposite Adhrat Island with a convenient place on the Karun for barges to come along side. Camel grazing is good but grazing for horses scanty, If miles west of the camp. 3 . SAB’EH. 16. 42. General direction North. At about mile 3 in the ’Aon there is good water for horses but too muddy for troops. The ’Aon and other water cuts met with are quite minor obstacles. Short ly after passing the ’Aon the tomb of Sayid ’Abud comes in sight and forms a conspicuous landmark. There is a convenient site on the Karun at Sab’eh for barges to come alongside Water .—From the river. Fue 1 .—Ample from tamarisk bushes. Fcdde :\—A limited quantity of khasil available in season. There is fam grazing for horse 3 and good grazing for camels.1 247 4. FARSIAT. 12 . 54. General direction North. Poles of broken down telegraph lines mark the route. The country is flat and the going fit for all arms and A. T. carts but is rough in places. There is a good site for a camping ground at the bend of the river 3 miles below Farsiat, where barges can come alongside. Wafer .—From the river. Fuel .—Tamarisk bushes. Fodder .—Good grazing for camels and a certain amount for horses. 5. BRAIKEH. 8 . 62. General direction N.-E. Tele graph poles mark the route. The country is flat and free from obstacles with crops at intervals. The going is good and hard but apt to become slippery in wet weather. A good site for a camping ground is found 24 miles north of the village on the river bank with good landings. 6 . AMIN! YAH (AHWlZ). 20. 82. General direction N.-E. Good desert going fit for all arms over flat country. Umm-al-Tumair is passed at mile 7 and the old bed of the Kharkeh which here presents no obstacle shortly after. This stage is impassable for motor transport in wet weather and passable for A. T. carts with difficulty. At Umm-al-Tumair there is a vegetable garden producing in season sufficient for a regiment only. It would be possible within a day to procure a few hundred sheep from the Bani Tamim tribe, who live on the Umm-al-Tumair-Hawizah road ; but this would depend on the attitude of the tribe, who are not so likely to be friendly as the Muhaisin, whose territory was passed in the earlier stages. Aminiyah is situated below the Ahwaz rapids and opposite to Bandar Nasiri. The remains of the camp used during the war still stands. A ferry of four bellams exists between Ami niyah and Bandar Nasiri. (6) AHWAZ to HAWIZAH— (a) 36 miles. 2 stages. (b) 40 miles. 3 stages.248 Arnold Wilson as being regularly used; he further states that a halt is usually made at Kut Hawashim by caravans, which diverge a mile or two from the main track for the purpose, out horsemen generally go straight through via the deserted Deh Savid Musa. The route here described touches the Karkheh at Hawaishim.and is I to 2 miles longer than the direct route on which however there is no water. Stages — 1 . KUT HAWAISHIM. 18. 18. General direction W.- TCT W U rm 1a. ca where it diverges westwards at a clump of rocks. Thence over level ground to the deserted village of Saiyid Musa on the east bank of the old bed of the Karkheh, along either bank of which (preferably the western) a track runs to Kut Kaw T aisliim^ on the Karkheh. The direct route to Hawizah continues to Hawizah from Deh Saiyid Musa over flat dry ground, reaching the village at 35 miles. 2. HAWIZAH. 18. 36. General direction W. The mounds known as A! Hamareh are passed at 8 miles and the old bed of the Karkheh crossed at 15 miles, just at the point where the ’Attabiyah canal enters it from the north. (b) General .—This road, via Umm-al-Tumair is longer by 4 miles but appears now to be used by caravans passing between Ahwaz and TFa.wHah and has the additional advantage oi being anitahle for of all descriptions. The track is iSU-iUcumt; jlv/j. - x flat along the whole route and would make easy marching for • JL JL at Umm-al-Tumair and a few eggs and chickens. Sheep in any numbers from the Bani Tamim provided that the tribe is friend ly. At Hawizah the following supplies are available : — Rice. Plentiful. Fish. Plentiful. Wheat and barley.. Very scant Sheep. Plentiful.These supplies however would have to be obtained from the Ban! Saleh tribe around Hawizah. It is doubtful if any supplies could be obtained in the town without notice. Water .—Reported that water can be found in the old bed of the Kharkheh, which runs along the whole route, at any place, if wells of 3 or 4 feet depth are dug. Good drinking water at Hawizah is very scarce. Lack of water has been the cause of the downfall of Hawizah, which was once a flourishing town. Obstacles. —Nil. The old bed of the Karkheh, which has to be crossed before IT mm - a! - Turn air is reached, presents no great difficulty even to motor transport. The approach into Hawizah is difficult but can be made with Ford touring cars. Inhabitants .—Bavieh from Ahwaz to Umm-al-Tumair. On the road to Hawizah Bani Tamim and round Hawizah town Bard Saleh. Shaikh Molah is the chief man of Hawizah town. Fuel .—Scrub plentiful. Grazing. —Scarce, except for camels. Camping grounds .—Ample room for any numbers at all stages of the road. The camping ground at Hawizah lies south to south-west of the town close to the Ahwaz-Hawizah road and about 1 mile before the town is reached. Communications. —N il. Military considerations .—The old bed of the Karkheh, which runs along the entire route from Umm-al-Tumair but is often as far away as half a mile, would afford excellent cover to an enemy wishing to effect a surprise. Stages .—With the exception of the first stage to Umm-al- Tumair of 8 miles no definite stages can be laid down. The remaining 32 miles must be divided into stages by the Officer Commanding according to his own discretion, preferably at a point where the Karkheh lies close to the road. (7) AHWAZ to BISAITIN. 52 miles. 4 stages. General .—The route skirts the south-west foothills of the Maniyur range as far as Illah on the Karkheh river, crosses the river there and continues parallel to its right bank to Bisaitin, to the west of which place the Karkheh loses itself in the marshes. The route is comparative^ good and suitable lor all arms*. MC164CGS250 This route forms the first stages of the Ahwaz-’Amarah route, an account of which is to be found in Karun Front File, Oommns., dated from 1st February 1915 to 9th June 1918. Water. Water is good and plentiful at Illah, Khafajiyah and Fisaitin. There is also water at Umm-al-Khaiyil from wells and possibly at Ghadir from pools. At Raml-i-Shamak 9 miles from Ahwaz, water lies in pools till the end of March, sometimes later, and is obtained from shallow wells dug by Arabs each year in the sand. Water is also found at Tai-i- Zibid and Deh Diz, 2 miles south of Rami Shumakhneh, where there are wells similar to those at Umm ~al -Haiyil Supplies .—Kut Saiyid ’ Ali. Sheep. 5,000. Cattle. 500. Grain. Nil. Transport animals. Nil. Khafajiyah— Sheep. 500. Cattle. 300. Buffaloes. 1,000. Unhusked rice and rice straw available. Mashufs. 100. Bisaitin— Rice. Plentiful. Fish. Plentiful. Cattle. 300. Sheep. 200. Fuel .—Firewood is stored in large quantities at Kut Sayid 3 Ali, estimated at (50 tons all the year). This is due to the fact that the village is the closest to Sinn-al-Abbas, where is a natural wood supply. Brushwood is plentiful along most of the route. Grazing. —Poor. Commit nications. —Nil. Inhabitants .—Bani Turuf. A strong tribe, liable to be hostile. Stages .—251 1. GHADIR. 10. 10. General direction N.-W. A good track over open desert, fit for all arms and motor transport. The track follows the southern foot of the Manyur range and passes the wells of Umm-al-Haiyil at mile 4 J. Ghadir is situated J mile from the foot of the Manyur range 1| miles to the north of the Raml-i-Shumakhneh sand hills, which are 60 feet high and afford abundant cover to cavalry and infantry. These hills can be traversed by troops^ though with difficulty by cavalry. They form a good artillery position. Water from the pond brackish but drinkable and its supply is not to be relied on in the dry season. 2. ILLAH. 9. 19. General direction N.-W. The Kar* kheh, which has to be crossed at this point, is a very considerable river and presents a formid able obstacle. „ It is unfordable and no bridging materials exist locally; a few boats are available. In May 1915 the width of the river was found to be 300 yards and the current very strong There is no village at IlJah. 3. KHAFAJIYAH. 15. 34 General direction N.-W. The route skirts the foot hills of the Manyur range, where the desert is firm and hard and always passable for all arms close to the river bank the country is intersected by irrigation canals— Khafajiyah, which is a straggling village of 400 to 500 mat huts, is situated chiefly on the left bank of the Karkheh. There is good camping ground on rising sandy soil one mile from the river. Unhusked rice and rice straw are usually available, but no other grain. Water from the Hor. 4 . BIS AIT IN. 18. 52. General direction N.-W. The track continues parallel to the river but at a distance of about 3 miles from it and is good going at all seasons. At mile 5 the village of Khanizeh is passed on the left; this village is unapproachable from the north. Bisaitin is a Bani Turuf village of some 450 huts scattered over a large area on the left bank of the Karkheh. There is good camping ground one mile north of the village with plenty of brushwood in the vicinity. Grazing is poor. Water from the Hor. ( 8 ) AHWAZ TO BIZFUL. 90 miles. 4 stages. General ,—The route, via Shush, which is the most used lie^ w r etween the Karkheh and Shaur rivers until within 4 miles of252 Shush, where it is necessary to ford the Shaur at a point about 30 yards above the site of the old bridge which was washed away. The river is fordable in the dry season and motors can be driven across, though a bridge would have to be constructed again here, if this road was required permanently for all arms. From Shush to Dizful the road is passable for Ford cars but is often difficult and passes through a swampy track across numerous streams and water cuts, spanned by flimsy wooden bridges. These and other bridges across the irrigation nalas in stages 2 and 3 would have to be widened and strengthened before they could be brought into permanent use for traffic heavier than Ford cars. The road during the whole distance is good. Welter .—-Plentiful at each stage. No difficulty for animals* Supplies .—-Very difficult to obtain, as no villages of any size are passed. Fuel .—Plentiful from the Ivarkheh. Grazing.—-On stage 1 nil in summer and scanty in spring ; on stages 2 and 3 good grass grazing in spring ; on stage 4 poor owing to pebbly nature of the country. Camel grazing good in first three stages. Obstacles.—Stage 1. —Nil, except heavy sand hillocks at two points on the road. These however can be avoided, if neces sary, by making a short detour. Stage 2 .—Irrigation cuts, all of which are now bridged but are only just possible for ford cars. Stage 3 .—The going is sandy in parts which presents difficul ties for lorries, they need not, however, keep to the beaten tack. Stage 4 .—The pebbly bed of the Bala Bud, which has to be forded, presents difficulties to motor transport. The road also is heavy in parts and wheeled transport is liable to stick. Bridges over irrigation cuts are weak. Motor lorries should go in pairs, if possible, so as to help each other, when necessary, and should cany rope, showels, etc. At least I week should be allowed to lapse before the road is again used by motor transport after rains. Inhabitants.—As far as Shush Arabs of the Bani Lam and from Shush and beyond Lurs. Amla and Sagw r and, vide Chapter VI.253 TacUcal .—Shush castle stands on a mound some 150 ft. high, thus presenting a strong defensive position with an excel lent command of the surrounding country. On the east and north-east of the castle lie low mounds, the ruins of the ancient Susa. The castle, wdiich was constructed partly with the idea of defence against local tribesmen, can accommodate roughly 1 battalion of infantry with its full complement of details. Mention may also be made of the rising ground stretching from mile 4 to mile 13 on stage 3 with its eastern slope resting on the Shaur river, and western on the Karkheli. Communications .—Ahwaz is connected to Bizful and Bizful to Shush by telegraph. Shush castle affords a good position for communication by heliograph. Stages. 1 . 1 ST BEND OF KARKHEH. 24. 24. General direction N. N. W. This stage is very good for all transport, w hich could move on a broad front throughout. For the first 14 miles the road runs on a flat bare plain with a hard smooth surface. At this point the track passes for mile over cultivated land, after which the going is again good till mile 18, when for tv/o miles ground prepared for cultivation is crossed. At the end of mile 22 an old canal is reached, along the bed of which the track runs till it reaches the Karkheh. This stage would be difficult to divide into two parts owing to lack of water. 2. 2 ND BAND OF KARKHEH. 24.. 48. General direction N.W. For the first tv/o miles the road continues good but is bumpy. From this point for about 12 miles the road is good but is crossed by numerous irrigation cuts, which though bridged are not strong enough to carry any great weight; in their present condition they carry Ford cars. From mile 19 to mile 24, where the camping ground is reached the going is good over a flat plain and there are no obstacles. The camping ground lies J mile south of the main route and on the river bank, where after a sharp bend, the river flows south. This stage is a good one for motor lorries, though not as easy as the previous one. A. T. carts can march on a broad front most of the way but lorries cannot. The stage, if required, can be divided at any place en route, preferably at about mile 15.254 3 SHltSH. 23. 73. General direction N. The mam track half a mile from the camp, leaves the Karkheh, the bank bending back west. At the end °f e the route commences to ascend a grassy, undulating * The top is reached after an easy and gradual climb oi 2 and at the end of mile 4J the track commences to drop to a lo ^ level. The going is heavy in parts and heavy motor transp should not follow the beaten track. At mile 13 the rising is e ~ From here to Shush the country is covered throughout wit scrub and camel-thorn, and is intersected with numerous sma irrigation canals. It is impassable for motor lorries a er 1 a At mile 13| the Ghanipat canal is crossed and between miles 15 and 16 about 200 yards of ground have to be crossed inter sected by four old canals which present difficulties to motor lorries even in dry weather. At mile 17 the Shaur river is crossed. The trestle bridge built during the war has been washed away, but the river can be forded about 30 yards a ove the site of the old bridge. Owing to deep water downstream of the ford, it is advisable when fording the river to bear s ig 7 upstream rather than to ford straight across. After crossing the Shaur further irrigation canals have to be crossed, before Shush is reached. This stage is more difficult than the hist but possible for all transport in the dry season. The last miles are geuerallv impassable for motor lorries after rains. 4. DIZFUL. 19. 92 General direction N. E. Passable for Ford cars and A. T. carts, lorries being able to run only to within 10 miles of Dizful in favourable weather. The going is good up to mile 5|, when a deep water cut is crossed by a wooden bridge, 5 by 3| yards, which can carry Ford cars and loaded A. T. carts. At mile 6 Harmushi canal is crossed by a narrow brick culvert in good condition. At mile a very steep descent is reached which is negotiable by loaded A. T. carts with care, after which the Sabzab rivulet has to be crossed ; its entrance and exit are passable by carts and Ford cars, but muddy and steep, its bottom is firm. At mile 10 the stony bed of the Bala Rud is reached, which is hea\v going for cars and carts in all weathers but passable except after heavy rains, when the river comes down in spate, usually falling in a few hours. The track continues good till it passes close on the right of Shonan, a large walled enclosure with a few huts in it; at this point the track becomes difficult to follow* From mile 13 to Dizful the road becomes gradually more and255 more pebbly, until at Dizful the road is no more than a pebbly beach. At Dizful the most suitable camping ground is on the right bank of the Ab-i-Diz in the vicinity of the fort marked on the map as Khushk, close to which is the aerodrome. The Ab-i-Diz is crossed by an old bridge, which has been recently repaired. The whole of this stage is badly defined and guides, though not essential, would be advisable. Alternative routes. d) via K hair abaci. ( 2 ) via west bank of river Diz and Shush. (3) via right bank of Karan river, Chinaibeh ford, through .Ah-i-Diz and Deh-i-Nau. (9) AH WAS TO DAR-I-KHAZINAH. 50 miles in 3 stages or 54 miles. 3 stages. General .—Two roads are possible on this route, though the branch is not made till Mulla Thani is reached, at 24 miles. The first road of 50 miles runs along the left bank of the Karan till Band-i-Qir is reached, where the river is crossed by a bridge, wide Chapter 2 , thence proceeding to Arab Hasan on the east bank of the Shabait from these following the line of an old canal to Bar-i-khazinah, where the river is again crossed by a bridge, which is the property of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The road throughout is good and used daily by the Company for cars and lorries. The general direction of the route is ISLE, as far as Wais, thence to Band-i-Qlr ISL, and from there to Dar-i- khazinah N.N.E. The road is passable for all arms, though the Band-i-Qir bridge is in poor repair and before being used for constant heavy traffic should be thoroughly examined. In wet weather motor transport would find great difficulty, especial ly if heavily loaded and fiver transport should be used. Water .—From the river. Supplies .—Very limited. Arrangements could possibly be made for sheep, sufficient for any number, to be sent to Wak and Band-i-QTr. Such arrangements would however depend on the attitude of the tribes. Wais is the first stopping place of caravans on the Lynch road hence a certain amount of supplies are always available, though it is impossible to depend on any quantity.256 Communications. —Band-i-Qir is in telegrapiiic conimunica- tion with Aliwaz ; this is under the Persian Government. The A. P. O. C. have also telegraph stations at Ahwaz, Mulla Thani, and Dar-i-khazinah, and telephone stations at Ahwaz, Zirqan, Wais, Mulla Thani and Dar-i-khazinah, though the last named connect only with the Oil Fields and places cn route. Communi cation by heliograph can be obtained between Ahwaz and Wais, but not between Ahwaz and Band-i-Qir. F ue l t —Scarce before Band-i-QTr is reached. Grazing.—S q&amp;tcq before Band-i-Qir is reached. Camping ground. —There are ample camping grounds at all itages. 1 Bridges.—{a) Band-i-Qir, vide Chapter 2. This bridge, after examination, would be fit for all arms. ( 6 ). Dar-i-khazinah, vide Chapter 2. This bridge, which .is a uteel pontoon flying bridge, will carry all arms, and two Ford cars at a time. It will not carry tractors. Inhabitants. —Bavieh. A once strong tribe, but now. of little consequence. They were influenced by the jihad during the war and caused trouble to our troops. At present friendly. The inhabitants of Dar-i-khazinah, who are mostly employed by the A. P. O. C., are Gunduzlus. Stages. —Except to give a division of the stages with the exact distances, as worked out by the A. P. O. C., there is no need for further comment. 1 . WAIS. 16. 16. General direction N. E. The road passes Zirgan, where there is a tele phone, at mile 6 . 2. BAND-I-QJR. 12. 28. General direction N. The road passes Mulla Thani at 8 miles, where there is a telegraph and telephone station. 3. DAR-I-KHAZINAH. 22 . 50. General direction N. to Arab Hasan, thence E. following the line of an old canal. The road crosses to the right bank at Band-i-QIr, and again to the left at Dar-i-khazinah. Alternative route. —The alternative route mentioned above breaks off at Mullah Thani, proceeding thence via Haddam,V 1*4 10 miles, and Ab-Gungi, 12 miles with the last s&amp;age to Bati knazinah of B miles. This ronto is also fit for all arms, but is more exposed to attack. TFater.—-At Pladdam water must be obtained from Hasan ■Sayid on the Abd-G&amp;rgar, 2 miles east of Haddam.

The road follows the telephone line. Sayid Hasan can fee seen from Haddam. The dry river bed, which is crossed immediately before Haddam is reached, forms the northern limit to the Shaikh of Muhammarah’s boundary. 3 . BAR-I-KHAZINAH. 20 . 54 . General direction H. N. E. to Ab-Gungi, which lies at the foot of the hnls, and W. KT. W. from there to Bar-i-khazinah. The road from Haddam to Ab-Gungi follows the pipe line through the Kharam lands, the property of some Shushtar Sayids. For 3 miles the road runs through steep banks on either side, which appear alternatively high and low after the nature of a switch- back. In the vicinity of Haddam, about 1 mile from the A. P. O. C,, telephone hut the country is much broken and would afiord easy cover to an enemy wishing to lay an ambush for troops on the road. The route would be difficult to protect on its flanks. From Ab-Gungi to Bar-i-khazinah the road passes through 6 large ravines. Special precautions would have to be taken to guard from surprise from these ravines. (For route to the Oil Fields, vide Route No. 16) s MC164CGS258 (10) AHWAZ TO RAM HORMUZ. 50 miles. 3 stages. or 84 miles. 6 stages. General .—The two routes are given, as motor transport can only proceed along the second route. The road, however, is good and kept in repair by the A, P. 0. C., who use it frequen y between Dar-i-khazinah and Mamuram, where the Company is boring for oil. (a) First route .—The first stage is passable for all transport including motor cars. There is a telegraph line which would guide single horsemen or men on foot, but owing to crops an nullahs the road does not follow the telegraph line. jp a £ er&gt; _At Shakheh and Mirbacheh, brackish but drinkable. Supplies.—At Shakheh supplies are scanty. At Mirhaeheh wheat and barley is extensively grown. The annual yield m grain including rice is estimated at 5,000 maunds. About 4 0 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats could be procured. T *ere are also 6,000 date palms, average 20 years old. At Kamuz supplies are plentiful, vide table at end of Chapter . ere are 20 flour mills in the Ramuz district. Communications— A telegraph line runs from Ahwaz to Ram Hormuz.

Fuel. —Scrub, which is scarce till the third stage is reached, when it becomes plentiful. Stages. 1. SHAKHEH. 27. 27. General direction 100 degrees. This stage is passable for motor cars. Guides should be taken as there are no landmarks. The route runs across the trackless plain of Ramuz and follows for many miles the base of the sandstone hills which trend away south east. Leaving the river the road runs east through corn fields about 1 mile north of a sharp sand-stone ridge about 200 feet high and known as the Utbej-i-aris. Mile 7 is swampy m rains.

There is water at Kugn- aiwah, which is a stopping place for caravans on f^ch roac. Wells are found on the south of the road at Salmieh and also at Kandak village, but water here is scarce. The water m Khm ak creek is brackish. At Mamuhiyah water is drawn from webs and the Tul-siah spring, near Mamuhiyah village, aboutH i miles ^rom the road. From here to Ramuz water is plentiful. Supplies. —A few at.Rughaiweh always available owing to its importance as a halting place for caravans. No supp ws however could be counted upon along the whole of this route. Communication. —Telephone from Haddam to Kandak with an intermediate station at Mutailif. This is a private concern of the A. P. 0. C. Camping grounds.—Ample ground at all halting places, with the exception of Mamuhiyah, where the only place for a camp is on the strip of ground about 100 yards wide between the road and the hills ; there is possibly sufficient room for 1 battalion but the camp must of necessity be straggling. The best camping ground for this stage would be about 6 miles before Mamuhiyaii was reached, if the force consisted of large numbers. Grazing is good but there y/ould be difficulty about water.261 \ Grazing .—Good in spring along most of the route between Mutailif and Mamuhiyah. Mil between Mamuhiyah and Ramuz. Fuel *—Very scarce.

C. from Dar-i- khazinah to Kandak and Mamutain. This branch road meet&amp; the main road after about two miles. The road is easily dis tinguishable but the joining of the two roads is further marked by 3 little towers on the north side of the main road at the point where they meet. The road follows the telephone line from Haddam to Mutailif. There is, good grazing along this stage.. Mutailif,. or Mantilla, consists of a small village of about 50 huts.. The A. P.

The passes through a deep but dry nullah as it leaves Mutailif and follows* the telephone line, which for the next two miles continually crosses the road. The country is under cultivation. At mile 2 Rughaiwah is passed about 1 J miles to the right of the road, a few supplies and water can be obtained here.. At mife 5 the old road vm Naft-i-Saiid, which is no longer used, branches off. At mile 6 a few deserted huts lying in mounds are passed on the right of the road and at mile 8 Salmieh village is passed on the left with deserted mud ruins and wells on the right of the road; The rbad is now passing through good grazing country. At mile 10 further ruins and a mound are passed on the right of the road. The country becomes undulating here and continues so to Kandak.. Kandak village is reached at mile 13 on the left of the road,. There are wells in the village but water is scarce. 5,. MAMUHlYE 1 L 18. 65, General direction S. E. The- road almost immediately cross es Kandak creek, in which the water is brackish. It then eon- lies over still undulating country, with good grazing, but, gradually becomes hatter. At mile 6 a small stone ruin with., two peaks, known as Imam Pirga Safi, is passed on. the right, of,% the road. The country here is cultivated but grazing land still remains. At mi^e 18 the rest house at Mamuhiyah is reached lying close to the foot of the hills and about 1 mile from the village of Mamuhiyah, which is surrounded by cultivation much irrigated from the Gupal stream. A dilapidated shrine adjoin ed by an enclosure containing 60 or 70 date palms and one or two 1 unar trees, stands } mile from Mamuhiyah on the side towards TV muz town, the trees forming a good landmark. On the west side are the encampments of the Zuhaid section of A! Kb a mis. The road along this stage is good and the best on the route frcm Haddam. 6 . RAM HORMUZ. 6 . 71. General direction S.E. The road runs along the foot of the hills for 3 miles, when the branch road to Ramuz bears off to the right, the main A. P. 0. C. road continuing to Mamutain, a distance of 13 miles from the meeting of the two roads. The road on this stage is at the present date in very bad repair. Ramuz is much surrounded by cultivation thus m aking it scarce ly possible to find a suitable site for a camping ground in the vicinity of the town. The best camping ground lies about 1,000 yards before Imamzadeh Pai Gach is reached on the right of the road ; this of course would necessitate the branch road to Ramuz being ignored and the Mamutain road being taken but only for the distance of from 1 to 2 miles. Either this or a site 3 miles further on could be selected, where the road meets the Rud-i- Zard and water therefore very plentiful. The site near Pai Gach has previously been used as a camping ground but is sug gested in this report as being a suitable site for an aerodrome, if this was required. » ( 11 ) AHWAZ TO MAKS AH. 60 miles. 4 stages. General .—In the summer the road is practicable for all arms and vehicles but a very slight fall of rain would make itjmpas- sable for wheeled traffic. Between Mudainah and Uwaifi the road passes for a distance of about 6 miles over ground which is probably under water for several months of the year and which in July is covered with small hard tussocks of grass, which make progress in cars slow and difficult. Water .—A few small wells of good but slightly brackish water at the villages en route. These in the summer contain only sufficient for the use of the inhabitants.263 Supplies ,—A limited amount of wheat and bhoo«a and a few hnndrfed sheep at the villages mentioned en route.

General direction S. by E. The road is no more than a caravan track. At about mile 9 the direction changes to S.E. and another track branches off at a S. by W. direction. At mile 12 Nahr Malih is reached. It has low sloping banks and a dry bed in summer covered with grass ; this is very rough and broken but being of mud could be made smooth with very little difficulty. Patches of cultivation cross the track at intervals. 2 . MEDAIXAH. 14. 30. General direction S.S.E.

The track is only visible for about one mile on each side of the village. The going is good except for deviations round patches of cultivation and between the fifth and tenth mile, where the route passes over small hard tussocks of grass— probably the dry bed of a marsh. 4. MAKSAR. 18. 60. General direction S. by E. The going is very good for about 9 miles over dead level plain covered with short grass. The track is met wdth about 4 miles before reaching Maksar. The country on both banks of the Jarrahi is under close wheat cultivation. The river at Maksar is about 60 to 70 yards wide with banks 35 ft. high. The bed in July was about 2/3 full of w^ater and from 2 to 3 ft. deep. {12) BAN D-I-QlR TO SHU STAR. 27 miles. 2 stages via left bank of Ab-i-Shatait. General .—This road, which as far as Arab Hasan, is the same as the Ahw'az Darrakhazinah route, ride Route No. 9, is only passable in dry ’weather for heavy lorries to Arab Hasan, the latter part of the second stage being difficult for either motor transport or A.

At Shushtar there are 21 mills in work ing order and capable of turning out 42 tons of flour daily. Supplies at Shushtar are unlimited. Communications.—wing to the narrowness of the streets at Shushtar great difficulty would be found in taking any but a small quantity of wheeled transport into the town. The follow ing are the exits from the town ; (a) To the west by kellek ferry. (b) By the Pul-i-Lashkar, Fit for pack. (,c) Over the dam by the Pul-bBuiaiti to the East.

During thVms last 8 miles t!ie track runs parallel with the Ab-i-Gargar througft well cultivated land cut by irrigation ditches. In wet weather these form considerable difficulties to wheeled traffic and even to pack At mil© 15, I ,©00 yards south of Shishtar, a stream is crossed ; it is dry for most of the year but impassable in March and April The ford for wheels is close to an Imamzadeh, being in spring 2 ft, deep and 50 yards wide ; the banks require ramping for A,- T. carts and cars. The stream can be crossed by the Pul-hLaskar—J mile west of the ford, but this m not passable for motor transport or A. T, carta, although it could be made pass able by work on the approaches. The surface is cobbled^ breadth 9 feet, and the composition stone and brick. (13) DAMRAKHAZINAR TO SHtJSHTAR, 14 miles, 1 stage.

(14) SEUSETAE TO DIZFUL. 1 {a) 37 miles. ) \b) 57 miles. 2 stage 0 . 4 stages. (a) Oeneral .—This is the direct route from Shushtar to Dizful, the other route only being necessary, if motor transport were required, which is unable to cross the wide stony bed of the Kaunak stream. With the exception • of this obstacle the re mainder of the route is good throughout and passable for all arms. Water ,—From wells at—- (a) Tang-i-Finishtar, 3 miles from Shushtar, on the right of the road. (b) Daimclieh. (c) Pehvandeh (d) Kaunak. From the canal at Siah Mansur. Supplies .—At Kaunak, rice, barley, wheat, beans, sheep and goats, though these could not be expected at short notice. Ample supplies at Slitishfcar and Dizful. Transport —-Kelleks and donkeys at Kaunak, but in small numbers. Mules and horses up to almost any numLer could be obtained at Dizful with a few days notice. Fuel. —Scarce, but plentiful at Dizful. Obstacles .—River Ab-i-Shatait, which must be crossed by a kellek ferry. Tang-i-Shushtar, the defile 2 miles from Shushtar which is didicult for cars and unsuitable for motors, but not impassable for either. Camping grounds ,—Good sites along the route.267 Stages. 1 . KAUNAK. 20 . 20. General direction N.W. Passable for all transport as far as Kaunak stream, across which only A. T. carts can pass. On leaving Shushtar the Ab-i-Shatait must be crossed by a kellek ferry below Pul-i-Dizful (broken). In November 1917 a mixed force with ambulance tongas crossed the Ab-i-Shatait in 10 kelleks consisting of 54 skins each, and by ford 500 yards south of the bridge. The ford is 3' 2' deep and the current rapid in places. Tongas were put on kelleks, whilst all transport usrd the ford and infantry were taken across on cavalry chargers. After crossing the river the route follows a well defined track towards low hills. At mile 2 the Tang-i-Shushtar is reached and a low rocky defile is traversed, in the centre of which is a spring well of good and plentiful water, which however, is diffi cult to draw. The track is stony and particularly rough until it emerges on to a broad alluvial plain, free from obstacles. At mile 8 it passes the ruins of an old c ‘Ghaparkhana” (Posting house), where good water in unreliable cpiantities is obtainable from wells. At mile 15 Pehvandeh is passed, a small village and suitable halting place, where water can be obtained. At mile 20 Kaunak is reached ; Kaunak consists of about 100 mud houses with a caravanserai about 200 yards north of the village« 2. DIZFUL. 17. 37. General direction N.W. Passable for A. T. carts. At mile two the track crosses the bed of the Kaunak stream, which is 1 mile wide with a stony bottom. It is dry in summer only but is always fordable except after heav } 1 rains. The passage is diffi cult for A. T. carts and impossible for motor transport, though if essential it could be bunded up for transport in the summer months. After mile 5 the village of Shahabad is passed, whence the track traverses stony and undulating ground, passable for carts. The village of Siah Mansur is passed after mile 20. Two males from Dizful a large nullah is crossed passabe for carts with out difficulty. (h) SHUSHTAR TO DIZFUL, Motor road. 57 miles. General .—According to Degree Sheet No. 9 D, the distance of the route is approximately 44 miles, but the opinion of the few officers who have travelled on the road is that the distance is approximately 60 miles and this agrees with Map No. 82, Dizful- Shushtar-Shush, designed by Lieut-Colonel Pearce of the E, F, D.268 and dated 18th June 1017. Distances are important, but sine© it is fully believed that No. 82 is correct, the distances on that map are followed in this report. The road is good throughout and passable for all transport, the only obstacles encountered, being a rough piece of road in the Tang-i-Shushtar or Tang-i-Ashgaft defile and the crossing of the Ab-i-Kaunak at Pa-i-Pillah. Owing to the depth and strength of the stream at this point the river is impassable for motor transport in the rain season. In the dry season the river bed is dry and passable for light cars ; it would however be necessary to bund it for heavy transport. The total width of the bed is from 200 to 300 yards. Shortly after the Kaunak is crossed two other pebbly nullahs, in which cars are liable to stick, are reached ; these however are no more than 20 yards in width. Water.—At Tang-i-Ashgaft from a well on the right of the road. From wells in the centre of the road shortly after Daimchah is passed. From Gutwand, Ah-i-Bid, Sar-i-Bisheh, and Fa-i-Pilleh in the late autumn and early spring. From wells on the Dizful road about 6 miles before Dizful is reached. Supplies .—Very limited amount from Gutwand, Ab Bid and Sar Bisheh. Plentiful for any numbers at both Shushtar and Dizful. Fuel. —Scarce. Grazing .—Good in spring along most of the route. Inhabitants .—‘Bakhtiari as far as Pa-Pilleh, which is bound ary line between Bakhtiari country and the Dizful district. Taetiml .—‘The Tang-i-Ashgaft would form a useful outpost position for the defence of Shushtar. A difficult position to take and an easy position to effect a surprise on marching columns. # The low hills on the left of the road between Ab Bid and Sar Bisheh would also afford a good position to an enemy intending to surprise a column. They lie about 000 yards from the road.269 i filTTWAND. 31. 31. General direction 317 degrees until the road breaks oft' from the Shushtar-Kaunak-Dizful route at mile 8 , thence 10 degrees to Oar Ali Roshari and over the crest of the Gardan-i-Aismi-Gir, from where the road continues in a northerly direction to Gut* wand. At mile 3 from Shushtar the road passes through the defile of Tang-i-Ashgaft, where it makes a few detours to the left but on coming out rejoins the telegraph line, which runs direct from Shushtar to Dizful. At mile 8 at a point between Diamchah and Chapar Khaneh the route leaves the direct Shushtar-Dizful road, and bearing North passes the village of Oar Ali Roshan and crosses over the crest of Gardan-i-Rish-i-Uir an easy ascent but a strong position strategically. The road now passes through undulating country with good S razl ^S an later through wheat and barley cultivation to Gut wand.

The road leaving the village of Gutwand on the right takes a sharp turning to the left and proceeds m a nor ■ - westerly direction through good grazing land with large cmtivaG ed areas. At mile i a white cone shaped heap is passed on the rmht of the road, which marks the boundary line between the Gutwand and Ab Bid muqata’ahs. At mile 7 Ab Bid is passed on the right of the road. Here are found a Bakhtian gamen and fort, where many khans reside in the spring. At the present (1923) Shaikh Farhan al Asad with his Arab following is encamp ed close to the fort. Leaving Ab Bid in a west-north-westerly direction, the road continues through similar country until 10 , when it becomes a mere track passing through thorny us of from 3 to 5 ft. high until Sar Bisheh is reached. Along almos f« 270 the whole of this part of the stage low hills lie on the left of the roai and about 80d yards from it. On reaching Sar Bisheh the road taiies a sharp turning to the right leaving the fort imme- diataly behind it. The route is now in the Sar Bisheh muqata’ah ol Sardar-i-Jang, who owns the fort of that name. 3. DIZFUL. 14. 57.

Total .. 159,000 Inhabitants ,—The district traversed belongs to the Bakhtiaris (Chehar Lang), being in the S.*W. limits of their Garmsir. The nomads usually start their annual migration to this district in November and depart from their Sardsir in April. Tne Bakhtiaris are the most important of the Lur tribes^ though they are not considered efficient in a military sense, having few fighting qualities and rifles of an inferior description. But they would probably be useful auxiliaries in combining with us to defend their country from the North. The Bakhtiari is a good scout. r ' ■ ■ ■ Their chiefs, the Khans, appear friendly to the English and have always looked to them for protection, but their tribal disputes and jealousies would prevent combination or unanimity against the enemy. The Khans and the Shaikh of- Muham- marah are at present friendly, but are always distrustful of one another. They are paid a yearly amount for protecting the oil works and pipe line ; they also receive a yearly dividend from the Company. During the war their attitude towards the273 British was not wholly friendly and it was found necessary to buy them over for the continuance of their protection of the Oil Fields, for their friendship towards the Shaikh of Muhammarah and for other reasons, which showed a hostile feeling on their part towards the British. Sections of the Bakhtiaris are distributed along the routes as follows—- (а) At Dar-i-Khazinah. Gunduzlus, most of whom are employed by the A. F. 0. C. ( б ) At ‘Batwand* Ruhidar and on the Lahabari plain. Mixed Bakhtiaris and one habitat of the Alaswand section. (c) AtTembih. Alaswand. (d) Maidan-i-Naitun. The Oil Fields are included in the country of the Shenis. To the north live the Bawasat Boirahmides and Tushmals ; to the east Gundalis and Muris ; to the west Zaraswands, and in addition Shush- tar tribes and the ’Aqili Lurs; to the south east Rakhi. A few Arabs are met en route, and at the Fields, At the latter place there is also a considerable number of Indians, including Sunni Muhammadans, whose numbers are increasing. The Bakhtiaris are of course Shi’ahs. The numbers of A. P. O. C. employees in the Fields alone range up to 10 , 000 , most of whom are Shushtaris. In addition to British employees, there are Arabs* Persians, Indians, Ar menians and Poles. Tactical. —The country is hilly and a force marching through, etc., with the inhabitants hostile, would require to be strong enough to picquet the heights, but at the same time not too strong, owing to the difficulty of water, supplies and transport. There are three main places that would require protection— (If Tembih, the power station. ( 2 ) Maidan-i-Naftun, the Oil Fields. (3) Maidan-i-Naftak, the water works and wireless station' Maidan-i-Naftun is 5 miles from Maidan-i-Naftak and Tembih miles from the same place. MCTG4CGS i.274 The presence of a force larger than two battalions of Infantry and a mountain battery for the protection of these places would entail the closing down of a portion, if not the whole, of the Oil Company Work, owing to the necessity of utilizing for the troops the machinery for pumping and condensing water. With regard to the three routes, that via Abgungi, though unfit for mechanical transport, would probably be better from a tactical point of view than the main routes, as the road crosses the ridges at right angles instead of following the valleys. On the route via Maidan-i-Naftak the road is overlooked on both sides from Batwand to the Oil Fields. . In the event of retirement from the Fields the route taken would depend on circumstances and the quarter from which danger was expected. It is doubtful whether the Company would agree to aeroplanes flying over the Fields owing to high tension wires. In the event of warfare with the tribes they could muster fighting men as follows, though this does not necessarily mean that all tribes would fight against us nor that the whole of one tribe would be engaged— Maximum. Probable. Bakhtiaris 20,000 10,000 Cha’b 10,000 5,000 Bavieh 2,000 1,500 Lurs 40,000 10,000 Pusht-i-Kuh 25,000 10,000 Internal dissension is usually rife amongst the Lurs.

Route via TEMBIH. 31 miles. General .—The route leads north-easterly for the first 3 miles oyer a flat plain, cultivated in season on both sides of the road, going very bumpy and dusty throughout the stage owing to heavy A. P. O. C. traffic. Dust would turn into thick mud in wet weather. Each mile is marked by a stone and furlongs by iron pipes. At mile 3 the roe*d enters hilly country and the rest of the route is through hills. From mile 3 to the most difficult and trying section of the route is tra versed owing to the u switch- back nature being aggravated by thick dust and roughness of the road surface. At 6 J miles the road turns N.-E. and at IGg miles northerly, reaching Abgah (A. P. O. C. depot) at 1miles. From Abgah the general direction is northerly and the going improves. At mile 13 the Ruhidar stream is crossed by a bridge capable of taking all arms ; thence the road runs easterly across an open p.ain to Ab-i-Tembih, 1 mile east of Batwand, which is reached at mile 15|. After crossing the Ruhidar stream, the road follows the valley of the river and before reaching the power station at Tembih crosses and recrosses it 20 times and from thence, following the valley of another small stream, crosses it 12 times before reaching the oil-wells ad Maidan-i-Naftun. At mile 16J the road turns easterly and at 17 the deepest of the fords through the27j5 Ab-i-Tembih is crossed ; this presents no difficulty in dry season for carts and the going continues good to mile 18|-. From mile 18J to mile 20 the road traverses switch-back country, ascents and descents being severe, in some cases 1 in and even 1 in 7. From here to mile 22^ the going is level and good, when another ^ mile of switch-back country is traversed. From mile 23 onwards the road is level and the surface good. At 25^ mile the road turns north-easterly and, crossing the Tembih stream for the last time, reaches the power station at mile 26J. From the Tembih power station the road follows up the valley of a small stream and, crossing it 12 times, gradually bears round to the north until the oil works at Maidan-i-JSTaftun are reached at mile 31. The road on this stage is in better condition than that on the previous stage, but the crossings of the Tembih stream, though generally no obstacle in the low water season, are sometimes impassable for transport of every descrip tion for a week or so at a time, owing to a rapid rise of the water and strong current during the rainy season. The bed of the stream, however, is firm and pebbly throughout. A. P. O. C. buck-wagons drawn by 6 mules and with a load of one ton each are continually up and down this route. The Company also used 5-ton petrol-driven Gamier lorries on this run, but they have not proved a success. A touring motor can do the route in 3 hours and a mule buggy in 6 under favourable conditions. ^ Water .-—With the exception of the supply stated above drinking water is found at Abgah, between v/hich place and Dara-i-Khazinah there is no water. At Abgah the water in the stream is plentiful and suitable for animals but not for men. There is a small covered well about \ mile S.-W. of the Abgah depot, which is used by the native residents, but the Europeans prefer getting their water at Batwand. At Batwand there is a good w^ell of excellent water behind the ridge N.-E. of the village, usually 15 7 of water, generally 30' below ground level; the well requires protecting from pollution. Animals generally refuse the Tembih stream water, wffiich flows near the village, as it nearly always contains oil and is also brackish. Supplies .—Not plentiful in Bakhtiari country; wheat, rice and barley are the only grains available in any quantity. Milk277 and butter are obtainable in small quantities. 500,000 sheep and CO ats are reported in the district and a considerable portion of that number would always be available from November to March, when the nomads are in the Gaxmsir. Transport. —In addition to the transport tabulated above mules of good quality might be hired in large quantities from the Bakhtiaris, should circumstances permit. Donkeys are also very numerous, but the Iliats require all their transport during their migration season (say 2 months in spring and 2 m autumn). _There is no firewood in the District, and troops would have to rely on oil for cooking, etc. Grazing .—Very good in spring and after rains for mules and horses at the Oil Fields. Water works, Batwand and m the Lahbari plain ; at other places poor. Obstacles.— So real obstacle except the switch-back section between mile 3 and 71 mentioned above, and the Ab-i-iembih in the rainy season. In dry season the maximum depth of the Ab-i-Tembih is only 1 ft. 2 in., but after heavy rainfall the river often rises several feet with a strong current and closes the road to all transport for 7 and 8 days at a time. The steep gradients between miles 18| and 20 present difficulties to wheeled transpoi in wet weather. The stream, which is crossed 12 tunes between Tembih and Maidan-i-Naftun is a smaller stream than the Ab-i-Tembih, but it carries down a quantity of oil, whmn _is ininrious to animals’ feet and motor cars. Gas emerges rom roadside tanks between Tembih and the Fields, and when there is no breeze, it drops into the valley and is oiten the cause of death to animals and sometimes to men. Improvements.- —The whole route is gradually being impror ed by the Company and the road always kept in good repair. Stone bridges have been constructed in recent years, a railway- line is beinw laid down alongside the road to Tembih and the road is being metalled. The road throughout the second stage is treated with the oil that comes down with the stream, whion makes the surface of the road much better than that in the first stage. Camping grounds.—'D&amp;r- i-Khazinah. Owing to intersection by nalahs the ground on the left bank of the Ab-i-Gaig^r is un suitable for camping; fair camping is available on the ivgn bank.278 Abgah. Camping space is limited to small units, half bat talions, etc., which would be rather scattered. . Batwand. The vicinity of Batwand would afford a more suitable camp, as space is unlimited, grazing good and the distance more convenient. There is, however, difficulty with regard to the watering of animals, vide water. lembin, .Limited space ; suitable for two battalions. Maidan-i-Naftun. Camping ground good and extensive. Communications.-—A. P O. C. telephonic communication between Dar-i-Khazmah Abgah, Tembih and Maidan-i-Naftun with boxes also at miles 6 and 13 ^ * jj Stages. 1 ABGAH 11 Jm. General direction N.-E. ~ * The road, which is the ^ . A. P. O. C. main cart road, leads over a plain cultivated in season. After 3 miles it enters the hills, whence several ascents and descents are made tmtil the A. P. O. C. depot at Abgah is reached. Here there is a telephone office, rest house, forage stores and wagon team chang ing station. Camping ground limited owing to the low surround ing hills ; there is room for about 2 battalions h mile N.-E. of the depot on either side of the road. Tihe Abgah stream provides ample water for animals ; water for human consumption from tne well J mile S.-W. of the depot and used by villagers. There is a fresh water stream 1 mile west of the depot, yielding about 2,000 gallons per hour; Europeans, however, prefer 'getting: their water from Batwand. &amp; 2 MAIDAN-I-NAFTUN 191 m. General direction N. ' 77 The Ruhidar stream is o i ui, crossed at mile 13* thence the road proceeds N.-E. across the Lahabari plain to the' crossing of the Tembih stream, 1 mile east of Batwand village and at I5J- miles. The route now turns easterly and running up the. valley of the Tembih stream, crosses it 20 times and traversing some switch back country between 18} and ‘’O miles and 22 ! and 23 miles, reaches the Tembih power station at miles - The r °ad now follows up the valley of a small oily stream and crossing it 12 times, gradually bearing round to the north, reaches the Fields at mile 31.279 2. Route via MAID AN-1- N AFT AK. 36 mites. 2 stages. General. The route is the same as that described above up to a point 2 .} miles beyond the A. P. O. C. depot, at Abgah. The object of this alternative route, which was constructed by the A. P. 0. C. with the assistance of some military labour, was to avoid the perpetual crossing and re-crossing of the Tembih river, which, as has been mentioned, was frequently impassable in flood season for a week at a time. The road is metalled, 2 nd class and 23 ft. wide throughout the whole length and is in good condition. Innumerable small streams, dry in hot weather months, cross the road at intervals. These are bridged by cul verts made of local stone and capable of carrying heavy motor transport. Two waggons or motor lorries can pass each other at any point without difficulty. Bridges ,—Two permanent bridges have been lately construct ed, both capable of carrying all arms. ( 1 ) A stone arch bridge across the Ruhidar stream at mile 13. (2) Over the Tembih river at Ratwand, an iron bridge of stone structure. On the immediate right of this bridge lies the Ford, which can be crossed by all transport. Gradients, — {a) .From 17J miles to 23£ miles there is an average upward slope of 1 in 20 . (b) At 33 miles a rise of 1 in 18. (c) At 33J a descent of 1 in 17. Villages—Alter Abgah the only settlement of any size is Batwand, beyond which are only occasional encampments in winter. Water.— From Dar-i-Khazinah to Batwand, vide previous route. There is a pure spring at 21|- miles, but the water is only sufficient for one Company of Infantry with its 1st and 2nd line transport, and it wxmkl take about 21 hours to water them. There is a large supply of pure water at Turkidiz at mile 21 capable of supplying a large force. This is about 3 miles from the road and is reached by a mule track. At Chasmah Zuliak mile 29, there is a large spring ol pure water. It takes about 10 seconds to fill a 4 gallon tin. A( 3 ) About 6 miles before reaching the wafer works a good spring of fresh water, which should give 100 gallons per hour. (4) 2| miles short of the Water Works a well with spring which should provide ample drinking water for a battalion of Infantry. (5) Maidan-i-Naftak (Water Works). Additional work required on the stage .—It is considered that a Company of Pioneers or Infantry, located for a week at Bat- wand and provided with picks, shovels and crowbars, could easily make this track fit for pack mule transport. (4) There is a good immetalled road from Chashmeh Zuliak to Masjid al Suliman with a spring within half a mile of the latter place at Chashmeh 5 AIi equal and as pure as that of Chash meh Zuliak. Halting places .—There are suitable halting places for large bodies of troops at Batwand and miles 24 and 30. There is ample space at these points for re-organising a column. Water Is laid c n at mile 30 by a 1 J inch pipe line. Tactical .—The road is overlooked on both sides by hills from Batwand to the Oil Fields. 3 . Route via ABGUNGI and RUHIDAR. 28 miles. 3 stages. General .—This is a route only fit for pack animals and not wheeled traffic, and is the low road of the three leading to the Fields from Dar-i-Khazinah. It runs in the Lahabari valley and coming through the Imam Reza range opposite Tembih joins that road at Tembih, and follows route No. 1 to Maidan- i-Naftun. Water .—Abgungi and Ruhidar, where it is reported that 12,000 gallons of fresh water can be produced in 24 hours. Supplies .—Frcyn Abgungi; and for the remainder of route, as reported for the alternative routes, only sheep. Stages. 1 . ABGUNGI. 8 . 8 . General direction E.-S.-E. This stage, which is fit for all arms and motor transport, passes through a number of large ravines. Strong precautions would have to be taken against surpris© from these.282 2. RUHIDAR. 6 |. 14General direction N.-E. The track enters the bare hills and follows the course of a ravine ; the track is a good one, about 9 ft. wide with gradients rather steep in places. In some places the track zigzags up the hillside—no obstacle to pack transport. It then crosses the top of the Tul Khalat range, a broken plateau, and then descends to Ruhidar; the descent is similar to the ascent, but not quite so steep or so long. The village itself is about J mile from the Lahabari River. At Ruhidar there is good camping along the river bank. There is no reason why these two stages should not be done in one ; the second stage, however, is a difficult and would probably take troops the same time that they could cover double the distance over a flat plain. Abgungi, therefore, being a suitable camping site, has been included as a stage on this route. 3. MAIDAN-I-NAFTUjNT. 11 J. 26. General direction N.-E. Crossing the river the track traverses the Lahabari plain ( 2 J miles) up to the Chalbatun hills ; thence following the course of a ravine, and through a tangi commanded by heights on both sides, reaches the broken plateau on top. After crossing this it des cends steeply to tne foot of the range and continuing thence on more or less level ground joins the main cart road at Tembih Power station, from where the route followed is that described in Route (a) Dar-i-Khazinah to Maidan-i-Naftun, via Tembih. Alternative 1st stage.—M.\xW&amp; Thani to Abgungi. 22 miles. 1 . ABGUNGI. 22 . 22 . General direction N.-E. Troops might be required to march from Mulla Thani, when the route following the pipe line via Haddam would be taken. Beyond Haddam the track follows the, A.-P. 0. C. branch motor road for about 2 miles, when it meets the main motor road from Dar-i-Khazinah to Mamutain .—Vide Route 10 -B. About J mile from Abgungi the track from Bistand, 5 miles away on # the Karun River, joins this route. This track is quite fit for and has been used by mechanical transport, which can proceed to within £ mile from Abgungi, when a bad nullah is met. A.-P. 0. C. have a rest house at Abgungi. Second alternative 1st stage .—Bistand to Abgungi. miles. This is the track mentioned in the previous paragraph, and as in the case of the route from Dar-i-Khazinah, there would be283 no need for troops to encamp at Abgungi but could continue the first stage through to Ruhidar. Par-i-Khazinah, Bistand and Mulla Thani are all places on the river, where troops could be landed, and the route to the Fields taken as described above. In the case of troops proceeding to the Water Works, i.e., Maidan-i-Naftak, an additional 5 miles is added to the last stage The road from Maidan-i-Naftun to Maidan-i-Naftak runs through low hills and roughly follows the oil and water pipe lines, suitable for touring cars and lorries. Tactical Though this is the outside road and possibly more exposed to attack, it is from a tactical point of view better than the main route as the road crosses the ridges at right angles instead of following the valley. (B) MINOR ROUTES. 1 MUHAMMARAH to BANDAR DILAM. 140 miles. 7 stages.

General—The navigation of the Karun is very simple com pared with that of the Tigris, as the channel of the former is more permanent and less subject to variations in the positions of the sandbanks than is the case with the latter. It is, how ever, liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the Mesopotamian rivers. Low water is generally from August to the end of November, though in the abnormal year of 1914 there was a marked rise at the end of October. The navigable draft at dead low water for steamers should not exceed 3 feet and for barges 2 feet 9 inches. In December and January there are usually considerable rises, which, however, vary greatly in extent from year to year. Towards the end of January or beginning of February the river usually sinks, to rise again with the spring floods, which begin at the end of February or the beginning of March. At this period and as late as April very violent and sudden rises may occur and in the second half of April there is the greatest mean volume of water in the river, which sinks steadily through May and continues to decline through June and July. MC164CGS286 The difference between high and low water may be taken to be on the whole 12-14 feet, but there is a difference of 24 feet between the highest and lowest records. Up to Bandar Nasiri, 1 | mile below Ahwaz, the Karun is m most parts and in ordinary seasons navigable by a vessel of 5 or even 6 feet draft. Vessels of 12 feet draft can reach Sal- maneh bend, 14 miles above Muhammarah. | The rate of the stream in high river is from 4 to 6 knots, in a low river about 2 knots. The river is 2-5 cables wide, and the channel is tortuous, especially above ’Ali ibn Hussain, 31 miles from Muhammarah, and very narrow at the bends, where the deepest water is generally on the concave side. The tide is felt as iar as T)orquaim, approximately 5 miles south of Rehvali. Water. —Water in the Karun is sweet. Supplies. —Supplies must be considered as being non-existent. The few villages that are met with lie within 16 miles of Ahwaz, but they could produce nothing worth calculating upon. Arab encampments during the winter, might, when met with, pro duce some cattle and sheep. It is possible that the A. P. 0. C. might make arrangements for supplies at Dorquaim. Transport. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company run three steamers daily between Muhammarah and Bandffr Isasiri, viz. S.S. “ Dehluran ” “ Chardine ” and “ Naftak,” while Messrs. Lynch Bros, run one steamer, S.S. 44 Shiab,” when cargo is available. Of native craft, 19 mahailahs, 12 Xaosari bellams ply on the Karun. They vary from 5 to 70 tons burden, and had a carrying capacity of from 200—600 gunny bags. They a,re wedge shaped with a raking prow, flat bottoms, and an open raised]poop for the accommodation of the crew. The mast, placed somewhat forward, has a list forward and carries one expansive latine sail. When the wind is unfavourable, they have to be towed upstream. A boat 90 feet long and 20 feet wide carries 70 tons and draws 7 feet 3 inches. Besides these larger craft, small passenger .bellaras, of which there are about 80, worked by paddles and towing are used especially in the neighbourhood of Muhammarah. They run from 3 to 4 feet broad and 16 to 20 feet long. ^ Stages. —The following stages are recorded with the mileage as laid down by the Inland Water Transport.287 1. SALMANEH. 14. 14. General direction N.-E. In this stage there is never any difficulty of navigation, and, as mentioned above, vessels of 12 feet draft can reach Salmaneh. 2. ’ALI IBN HUSSAIN. 20. 34. General direction N.-E. for 2 miles, thence N.-W. for 5 miles and from there to ’Ali ibn Hussain N.-E. As far as Rehvali navigation for river boats of any draft is easy. At Rehvali there is a bad crossing in low water with not more than 3 feet of water for steaming over. From this point to ’Ali ibn Hussain there is no further difficulty. 3. IDRISIYAH. 20. 54. General direction N.-N.-W., though there are consider able bends in this section. The deepest water is generally found on the concave side. Navigation is not difficult in this stage. 4. FARSIAT. 20. 74. General direction N.-N.-W. to Qajarieh, E. to Isma’ili, thence N.-N.-W. bearing gradually to N.-N.-E. to Farsiat. Isma ili generally and to-day is in low water the worst place on the rrver. There was in September 1922 in the channel 2 feet 9 inches and steamers were unable to cross without touching ground. In the remainder of this stage navigation is easy. 5. MILA’IHAN. 12. 86 . General direction N.-E. with frequent bends. The water is generally very low at Braikah and in 1921 there was less water here than at Isma’ili. In 1922, however, there was in low season 3 feet 6 inches of water. The remainder of this section presents no further difficulties to navigation. 6 . BAIT HAIDAR. 18. 104. General direction N.-E., though the river makes big bends in this section. At Umm-al-Turnair the widest part of the river is encountered. There is always plenty of water in the channel but navigation is rendered difficult, if the channel is lost. At Kut-al-’Amairah it is necessary for boats to pass between the island and the left bank, where there is always sufficient water. The channel between the islands and the right bank is in low water frequently dry. At Kut Say id Salih in low water there is 4 feet of water in the channel.288 7. BANDAR NASIRI. 6 . 110. General direction N.-N.-E. Fr °m iiere to Bandar Nasm the river is navigable for river steamers, though much encumbered with sandbanks and subject to constantly chanmn* channels. Off Kiit Abdullah are rocks with about 3 feet of water, though in 1919 boats drawing more than 2 feet 6 inches were unable to pass. At Shakareh there is not more than 3 feet of water in low water season. During the war boats proceeded no further than Koraisham, where there was a M. T depot which conveyed stores, personnel, etc., by land along the right bank to Ahwaz. ° . Fl 01 j 1 Dandar Nasiri to Ahwaz ( 1 | miles) there is a oreat rise in the river bed and a series of heavy rapids, generally°con- sidered unnavigable, exists. These rapids are 5 in number with a total length of 2,000 yards. The real obstacle to naviga tion is the second rapid from the top, where a reef runs out trom the left bank leaving only a channel of 100 yards broad broken up by islets into two or three passages, of which the one nearest to the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. The water here rushes with a fall of 1 in 50. 1 he total loss of height between the top and bottom of the rapids is 1 ft. in high and 7 *3 in low water. ,, rapids are said to be passable by towing, and it is stated that they were successfully crossed by Sir H. Layard in the paddle-wheel steamer ‘ Assyria ’ in March 1842 with the assis- STss? a rrir- r The ‘ Susa ’ and ‘ Shushan ’ also ascended m 1889 and 1890. Commander S. C. Pant of S.S. “ Shushan ” describes the Ahwaz rapids as a formidable barrier to naviga tion, and they can only be crossed by powerful light draft steam ers during the months of April and May with any degree of safety. Native boats can be brought over at any season. Ves sels about to cross should have on board a man thoroughly acquainted with the channels, etc. At the present time cargoes are landed at a small natural basin off Bandar in asm and conveyed by a light railway to vessels above the rapids. It is reported that a canal on the left bank, some -,350 yards long with a cutting 35 feet deep would be required to avoid the rapids. The formation here is sandstone. _ A possible alternative to this, it is said, would be SnsTnf' a! an , an , Cient ; (P robabl y irrigation) canal which runs li. of Ahwaz ; its length is about 2J miles.289 2. AHWAZ to SHILAILI. 85 miles [approx.). 6 stages* General .—The reach of the Upper Karun is less easy for navi gation than the lower chiefly owing to its narrowness,which prevents more than one hargfe being towed abreast of steamers above Band-i-Qir, and its shallowness in parts where only light draft boats can pass. As regards the rise and fall of the river this is the same as in the Lower Karun and has already been dealt with. The rate of current is reckoned at 6 to 9 knots in flood and 3 knots in low water. Waier — Water from the river is sweet, Svppliesr — Supplies are not abundant, but emergency supplies could always be found at Wais, the first caravan halting place on the Lynch road&gt; and at Land-i-Qir, a small village. As however in the Low^er Karun arrangements could probably be made for supplies to be provided at their stations, especially Mulla Thani and Dar-i-Khazinah. Such provision would natu rally depend on the attitude of the tribes, from whom it would be required to purchase supplies. Bridges.— Band-i-Qir and Dar-i-Khazinah. For details see Chapter II under the heading 6 Bridges’. Transport .—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company run four steamers, S. W. Aminiyah, S. W. Naftun, S. W. Mama- tain and S. 11. The dimensions of the largest of these boats are 110 feet length, 22 feet width and with a draft of 3 to 5 feet when loaded. The Company has also 8 100 ton barges. In addition the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited has one steamer S. W. Shamsi and 1 50 ton barge, whilst Moin-ut-Tujjar owns S. W. Amiri with 2 50 ton barges and 2 motor boats. Of native craft there are 17 cargo boats at Ahwaz, which are used between that place and Shilaili, and about 20 small ferry boats at different villages en route. Trade .—As regards trade on both Upper and Lower Karun native sailing boats maintain a not unsuccessful competition with the steamer, especially in the carriage of grain ; this may be explained by the fact that the owners accept grain in bulk and do not insist on bagging, that for petty collection from point to point small craft have a natural advantage over large, and that the boat of the country is sometimes able to a certain extent to evade the embargo, when imposed. MC164CGS290 \ i S lanes — o 1 . WAIS. 21 . 21. General direction N.-E. but the course is tortuous and winds in all direc tions. After the first lar^e bend, a distance of about 4 miles, Saiyid Abbas is reached. The depth of the channel at this point in low water is ft.; most water is to be found in the middle of the river. At 9 miles Saiyid ’Anaiyah is passed and at 13 miles the island of Luqbair is reached. Water is al ways at a depth of 5 feet or more between Saiyid Abbas and Luqbair. The channel for navigation runs between the island and the left bank. There exists, however, on the other side a canal, which is used b}^ steamers as a short cut making a differ ence in time of 10 minutes. At Sadiyah, which lies 2 miles above Luqbair, only 3 feet of water is found in low water season. The channel runs along the left bank. From here to Wais navigation is simple. 2. BAND-I-QIR. 8 . 29. General direction N. In this stage there is always from 3 to 5 ft, of water. From Wais to Nughan, (2 miles), the channel runs along the right bank and thence to Band-i-Qir along the left bank. Navigation is difficult at Lughamaiyij, mdes above TV ais and from there to Hillah wa Dillah, where there is barely 3 ft. of water in the channel. N- B. Lughraaiyij and Nugban are often known as one place. 3. SAIYID HASAN. 10. 39. General direction N.-N.-E. The only difficulty encoun tered in this stage is at Sin-al-Tel, U miles from Saiyid Hasan, where a rock lies in the river bed. The channel lies between the rock and the right bank, but in high water season boats can pass over the rock. In the summer months the rock projects out of the river and it is difficult for a steamer to pass without touching it. Navigation on the remainder of this stage is simple. From Band-i-Qir only one barge can be towed abreast of a steamer. If a second barge has been taken from Ahwaz,. it is towed. 4. DAULATABAD. 22 . 61. General direction N.-N.-E. with numerous bends.

At Russainabad, 6 miles from Dar-i- Khazinah, there is only 3 ft. of water in summer with a channel along either bank. From here the route passes Khurawmizi to Shalaili,, where there is always from 3 to 4 ft. of water. About J mile before the usual anchoring place a rock, difficult to pass, lies in the river ; at this point there is only 3 ft. of water. Beyond Shalaili navigation, is impossible, there being only from 1 to 3 ft. of water.CHAPTER IX. -Ad MINI ST HA TI ON. 'General. ori ]y p ar t Q f ’Arabistan in which the machinery of the Central Government is actually in motion is the strip of territory about 20 miles broad lying immediately below the Bakhtiari hills and containing the towns of Diziul and Shushtar. To the north of this strip lie the winter pastures of the Bakhtiaris and to the south the Arab tribes ruled over by the Shaikh of Muham- marah whose hereditary title to the Governorship of South ’ Arabistan is supported by a series of royal firmans. The Governor General of ’Arabistan with his headquarters at Shushtar is now little more than Governor of Shushtar town and district. He has no force at his disposal except a few local town police and some thirty or forty sowars recruited from Lur tribes in the vicinity. His writ does not even run in the Dizful dis trict, where for the past two and a half years a deputy-governor, nominated by the Governor General, has resided, but he com mands no authority in the surrounding district which is the home of the truculent Lur, Arab and Bakhtiari tribesmen. In actual fact the leading political authorities in ’Arabistan are three in number, namely, the Persian Governor-General, the Bakhtiari Khans and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. Of the last two named the Bakhtiari Khans have complete control over the Ram Hormuz district, whilst the Shaikh of Muham marah holds the position of Governor of Southern ’Arabistan direct from the Shah and cannot even be summoned by the Governor General to his presence. Owing to the amount of property owned both in the district and town of Ram Hormuz by the' Bakhtiari Khans it is gradually cutting adrift from ’Arabistan, and so far as this report is concerned may to all intents and purposes be considered as outside the province, for neither the Governor General nor the Shaikh of Muhammarah make any attempt to interfere in its administration. The remainder of the province rests between the Governor General and the Shaikh, and in order to appreciate fully the difficulties of what is a most complex administration the simplest method is to consider separately the policy and main forces at work in the northern and southern provinces. covernment There exist, however, certain establishments, which are UbUshments. general to the whole province, and which it would be advisableto set down before making the suggested division into the and southern districts. (!) Persian Foreign Office .—The Persian Foreign Office is represented by two ‘ Karguzars’ or Agents, who reside in Muham- marah and Nasiri, the Karguzar at Nasiri being subordinate to that at Muhammarah. These officials are supposed to possess, copies of all treaties, into which Persia has entered with Foreign Powers, and they are in theory the only medium of communi cation with Foreign Consular representatives in the province. In practice the functions of the Karguzar are much more re stricted, for foreign consuls deal directly in many cases with the local administrative authorities, especially with the Shaikh of Muhammarah and the Bakhtiari Khans, and disputes between natives and foreigners are but seldom referred to the KarguzW for settlement.

(5) Persian Berenue Departm ewl—Vide Chapter IV.\ ( 6 ) Representation of Foreign Interests .—Foreign interests in ^Arabistan are almost entirely British. The British Government is represented in 5 Arabist an by a Consul at Ahwaz assisted by Vice-Consuls at Ahwaz and Muhammarah and until recently also at Dizful. Owing to the close relations between the British Government and the Shaikh of Muhammarah the Consul fre quently acts in an advisory capacity to the Shaikh and his representatives. For some years before the war the districts of Dizful an^ ^ Shushtar, which form the northern province, were no more than a Tom Tiddler s 55 ground over which the armed bands of th e Shaikh of Muhaminarah and the Bakhtiari Khans alternately advanced and retreated- Each party subsidized its own adherents in the two towns which, when not actually occupied by the forces of the Bakhtiari Khans or the Shaikh of Muhammarah, were constantly involved in faction fights of their own to the great insecurity of life and property. The honours of war generally remained with the Bakhtiaris whose adjacent hills provided a convenient retreat from which they could sally forthi and harry and plunder to their hearts’ content. At the beginning294 of the war the Bakhtiaris maintained deputy governors of their own supported by a force of Bakhtiari sowars in the two towns, who helped themselves freely to the local revenues and main- tained a semblance of law and order. In these circumstances the impotence of any Governor General who could be induced to take up his residence in ’Arabistan was complete and the con dition of the hapless townspeople can be better imagined than described. Shushtar suffered more than Dizful owing to the presence in the former town of a family of Saiyids calling them selves Kalantars, who had gradually made themselves supreme in the town and were responsible for the most abominable cruel ties until their power was finally broken by Captain Greenhouse, the Assistant Political Officer at Shushtar in 1917. Such was the position in 1917, when British Assistant Politi cal Officers supported by a small force at Shush were sent to the towns of Dizful and Shushtar. With the increase of British in fluence in these two towns the Bakhtiari influence declined, the two Bakhtiari deputy governors and their sowars disappeared and an opportunity' was given to the officials of the Central Government to exercise their normal functions. At the same time the Persian Government sent a i*epresentative to Arabistan, who was nominated as Governor and resided at Shushtar, where he was advised by the British Political Officer. The immediate result of these appointments was the recommencement of the Customs, Revenue, Judicial and Opium departments under their old heads with greatly increased receipts. Other improvements which assisted in the preservation of law and order were ; ( 1 ) The bridge at Dizful, which had been repaired during the war bv the Persian Government with the assistance of the British, was bringing in considerable income. (2) The Imperial Bank of Persia opened branches at both Diz ful and Shushtar ; the branch at Dizful has since been closed. (3) More friendly relations were established between the landowners and the priests. ( 4 ) A better understanding between the Shaikh of Muham- nmrah and the Bakhtiari Khans prevented a recurrence of this province being a “ No Man’s Land ”, over which they used to settle their disputes.295 (5) An increase in the area of land under cultivation and local revenue receipts. ( 6 ) The relations of the British with the tribes of Luristan dependent on Dizful had improved. This temporary administration of British officials gave the Governor an opportunity of consolidating his power and taking the reins of government into his own hands. The situation, however, in Northern ’Arabistan is always complicated by the reluctance of officials sent from Teheran to spend the hot weather in the plains. During their brief stay they do little but reim burse themselves for the expenses incurred by their appointment and seize the first opportunity to leave or transfer. In these circumstances it is a simple matter to see how the Shaikh of Muhammarah gradually increases his influence over the Arab tribes in Northern ’Arabistan to the annoyance of the Persian Governor General, as was exemplified in the case of Muwaiyyid- ad-Dowlah in 1922. This man, like so many of his predecessors, put personal ambition before duty and in his hatred and jealousy for the Shaikh of Muhammarah endeavoured to create an ill- feeling between the Persian Government and the Shaikh by re presenting to the Government that the Shaikh was unable to collect his revenue. He therefore requested that Government troops should be sent to ’Arabistan thinking that by this he would cause unrest among the tribes and ultimately break the autonomy of the Shaikh ; he endeavoured, too, to bring about the return of the Kalantar family to Shushtar, knowing that they would create disturbance in the province, which would reflect on the Shaikh. His government was marked b}^ his hatred of the British and the Shaikh, his intrigues with the Bolshevists and his desire to create ill-feeling between the Persian Government on the one hand and the British and the Shaikh on the other. Fortunately in October 1922 the position became too hot for him and he was compelled to resign, his place being taken by Mushar-ad-Dowlah who came from Bushire and from whom a better administration may be expected than from any of his predecessors. No account of the administration of Northern ’Arabistan would be complete without relating the differences between the districts of Shushtar and Dizful and the difficulties to be encountered in each by the Governors General. (1) Dizful .—Seeing that Dizful town is a frontier town and the market for the neighbouring tribes, the Governor General \ » 'ijj!has to deaj with the varying changes of fortune and policy of the Arabs of ’Iraq, the Arabs of ’Arabistan and the Lurs. The Shaikh of Muhammarah’s influence over the tribes of that dis trict is shadowy. The Ban! Lam tribes on the Mesopotamian side of the boundary are with difficulty controlled from ’Amarah. The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh manipulates tribal factions in his own interests whenever possible ; while the predatory habits of the Luristan tribes such as the Sagw T and, Dirlkwand, Bahrawand and Qalawand, whose winter quarters are onlv a few miles from -l)iziu1 town, are too well known to need description. The ex periment was tiled of getting hold of one of these Luristan tribes,, namely the Sagwand, and settling them on the border to act as a buffer between Dizful and the Xo-Man’s land to the west and north-west. The experiment proved a success. The Sagwands were given irrigated land to cultivate and their chief receives a subsidy of 700 tomans a month in return for his protection of the caravan routes. He also supplies a force of sowars, known as the Sagwand levy, who provide the necessary mamurs for the Deputy Governor and the heads of the Revenue, Opium and Adliyah departments. ( 2 ) Shushtar .—Shushtar presents a very different and less difficult problem. So long as the Governor General’s budget allows him to maintain a force of from 40 to 50 sowars and the Bakhtiari Khans exercise a restraining influence over their tribesmen, no serious outbreak in the district need be apprehend ed. The town of Shushtar has from time immemorial been very bigotted and the power here has always been in the hands of the religious heads or the Kalantar family. In both districts, however, owing to the influence of the Shaikh of Muhammarah over the A 1 Kathir Arabs to the south of the two towns cooperation between the Governor General and the Shaikh is essential to good administration. Southern Southern ’Arabistan presents a very different situation. Province, ppg whole province is governed by the hereditary Muhaisin Shaikh of Muhammarah, now Khaz’al Khan, Sardar Aqdas, Mu’izz as Saltaneh, who bears the title of Governor of the Shatt- al-Arab and Karan, and also that of Sarhadd-dar, or Warden of the Marshes. The rule of the present Shaikh is personal and extremely stringent, but while his severity inspires awe, his justice commands respect, and tribal opinion is fully consulted by him through tribal councils, His principal adviser is Ilaj297 Muhammad ’AH, Rais-ut-Tujjar, a Persian Merchant of Reh- behani family, but settled at Muhammarah, whom he utilises in his affairs generally and in negotiations with the Persian Government or with communities and persons not Arab. A great deal of the brains and most of the tact especially in dealings with the British and Persian Governments are frequently ascrib ed to this man. The Shaikh’s methods of administration are strange and need explanation. His father Haji Jabir realised that to control numerous tribes over a vast area the power must be in the hands of one man ; he, therefore, gradually broke the power of the tribal shaikhs. His son, Khaz’al, has always borne this in mind and discouraged the pretensions of tribal shaikhs. Since he is unable personally to control the tribes over the whole area, he appoints agents of his own selection, whom he sends out to the various districts and tribes to keep law and order and to collect revenue. These agents are rarely of high birth and stand to the Shaikh in the same relation as a non-commissioned officer to his officer in the British Army. They are appointed to obey his orders, and if they fail in their duties, they can be dismissed as easily and as quickly as they were appointed. Most xammi- nent of these agents at the present time are ;—- Khallaf ibn Shinawah in the Mianab. Haji Sultan at Qusbah. Shinawah on the Bahmanshir. Salih ibn Haji Ghadhban over Bani Turuf. Shaikh Sahar over Bani Tamim. ’Abud ibn Dhuwaib in Fallahiyah. Mir Cholan in Jarrahi. Agha ’Abdi-al-Samur in Hindian. Shaikh Molah at Hawizah. Of these ’Abud ibn Dhuwaiyib alone is a tribal shaikh. The remainder belong to no tribe and are purely administrative officials owing allegiance to no one but the Shaikh. He gives little powder to his sons. With the exception of Abdul Hamid, Deputy Governor of Ahwaz, all have received similar appointments at various times and all have been found wanting and dismissed. Of other relations Shaikh Musa alone holds a high position in his appointment as Deputy Governor of Abadan.298 The outcome of this system may be summarised as follows ;— ( 1 ) Revenue received is three and ffour times greater than when the Shaikh relied on tribal, chiefs to collect from their own tribes. ( 2 ) The power of the tribal shaikhs is broken and his own power more firmly established. (3) The position of the cultivators remains more or less the same, since the extra revenue which is collected by the Shaikh formerly filled the pockets of the tribal shaikhs. (4) The personal enmity for the Shaikh of all tribal shaikhs and others whose hope for power and wealth is thwart ed. The strength of such an administration cannot be denied but it cannot stand without_some backing. For this the Shaikh relies upon ;— ( 1 ) British support. ( 2 ) His wealth, which he uses for buying up portions of land, giving presents and loans. (3) The fact that he has ruled for over thirty years and though naturally disliked in many quarters has so firm ly established his position that he is recognised as their leader, and a leader whom it is impossible to beat. (4) Increase of trade due to order being well [maintained, which increases the prosperity of his province thus bringing content and employment to his tribes. (5) The growth of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which gives a financial and industrial interest to his people. The possibility of the decline of the Shaikh’s power and the result of such a catastrophe must not be overlooked. This possibility is small during the lifetime of the |Shaikh, though a difference of opinion or a failing on the part of the British Govern ment to support the Shaikh might allow his enemies to imagine that their time had come to strike. The blow would be personal and would be the result of an intrigue on the part of interested persons against the life of the Shaikh ; it must not be forgotten that attempts have already been made against his life but the299 plot discovered and the offenders severely, one might say cruel ly in a more civilised country, punished. The presence of Persian troops in ’Arabistan would not only menace the present state of the Shaikh’s autonomy and peaceful administration, which we have done our best to maintain, but also creating unrest among the Arab tribes would react unfor tunately upon the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and incidentally British interests. Though this may be considered an impro bability during the Shaikh’s lifetime, it must be regarded almost as a certainty on the day of his death, when the peaceful ad ministration of Southern ’Arabistan may be expected no longer. 299—3 00301 APPENDIX A, Bibliographical Notes. * {A).

Liquids are sold by weight or, if in small quantities, by the reputed quart bottle. Grain is nominally sold by the “ Kharwar ”, which contains 50 Shah or 100 Tabriz man. In the Muhammarah district date crops are computed by means of the “ Karah ” of tons, English. ( 2 ) Measures. (a) Linear .—Units of linear measurement are the Gaz-i- Shah of 40 to 41 inches and the double cubit, the latter called by Persian “ Zar ” and by the Arabs “ Dhara ” varies in ’Arabistan between 32 inches in Shushtar and Eallahiyah and 37 inches or even more in other districts. Persians subdivide this measure into “ Nim ” or halves and tc Pub 5 ” or quarters by Arabs these are styled Nusf and Bubah The Rub’ or Rub a 1 is also called a Charak, and the Charak is said to consist of 4 Gireh. Piece goods are sometimes sold by the English yard ; other wise they are measured by the actual cubit, or usually by the actual double cubit i.e.. the distance from a man’s nose to the tip of his fingers when the arm is extended. In some parts of the country and especially in Northern ’Arabistan, distances are estimated by the “ Farsakh ” (Persian or “ Sa’at ” (Arabic), which is equal to something between 3|- and 4 English statute miles. (b) Square.-—A tq?&amp; are generally described in terms of their dimensions ; but a rudimentary unit of square measurement for land exists on the Shatt al Arab in the Jarib, which has a super ficial area of about 2 A- acres and is supposed to accommodate 200 date palms, but in practice its size is somewhat variable. There is also the “ Eaddan ” (Arabic) or “ Khish ” (Persian), a somewhat indefinite measurement of land, but one more generally understood than the Jarib. It is described as being that area of land which can be ploughed over with one pair of bullocks during the season of ploughing, or which requires 100 Shushtar ‘ mans ’ (13 cwt. English) of seed to sow it. It is known as “ Gao ” in the Hindian district.. The Dhara’ too is brought into use in a rather unique manner, 100 dhara’ being equal to 1 fiddan or sharood, which can be a piece of land 60 X 40 or 70 X 30, the 100 being obtained by addition.304 B— contd. (3) Coinage, The currency is that of Persia with the silver kran as the basis. The kran has a fluctuating value of annas 4—44, the coin chiefly in circulation being a piece of krans 2 . Besides the 1 and 2 kran pieces there are a limited number of 5 kran pieces in use. The nickel coins are pieces of the value of 1 and 2 Shahis respectively, 20 Shahis going to 1 kran. Copper pieces are called Pul-i-Siah, which are subject to great fluctuation in value, though the unit of these coins may be taken to be worth 2 Shahis* The tuman is an imaginary unit though of the fixed value of 10 krans. Besides these the Turkish lira, a gold piece of fluc tuating value of about 14 rupees and the Indian rupees have no difficulty in finding a market of exchange. The rupee, however, is very rarely seen north of Ahwaz, and it is doubtful if it would be accepted, except at a great loss in the exchange, in Dizful and Shushtar. (4) Time, {a) Calendar .—Two calendars are in use in ’Arabistan, the one being Solar, spaced according to the signs of the Zodiac and the other the ordinary Muhammadan Lunar year. The Solar Year .—The year begins and ends in the spring 21st March, Vernal Equinox, and is divided into 12 Mansions the twelve signs of the Zodiac. The Solar Year belongs to what is known as the 4 Tatar Cycle ’ of 12 years, each year being named after a certain animal, the words being still used in that sense in Central Asiatic Turkish. The present year 1923 is the last of the Cycle, and is hence 4£ the year of the Hog*” The names are as follows ;— Year of the Mouse. Do. Ox. Do. Leopard. Do. Hare. Do. Pish. (Crocodile). Do. Serpent. Do. Horse. Do. Sheep. Do. Ape. Do. Cock. Do. Dog. Do. Hog.305 00 YlC.l.'d * The name of the months are as follows ;— HamaL Mizan. Saur. Aqrab, Jauza. Qaus. Saraban. Jaddi. Asad. * Daiw. Sumbuleh. Hut. The Lunar Fear.—Since the Arabic conquest of Persia the Muhammadan calendar has been in use in the country for all ordinary purposes. The year consists of 354 days, 9 hours and the months contain 30 and 29 days alternately. Its reckoning begins from the Hijreh or departure of Muhammad from Mecca to reside in Medina, A. D. 622, (18th July). The year being so much shorter than the Christian, it is not possible to give any English equivalent for the various months, as they begin about 11 days earlier each year. The names of the months in order are tabulated below Muharram. Safar. Rabi’ ul awwal. Rabi’ ul thani. Jammadi al awwal. Jammadi al thani. Rajab. Sha’ban. Ramadhan. Shawwal. Zil Qa’deh. ZilHijjeh. lb) The Clock .—The time of sunset by European time is the same as 12 o’clock Arabic time. Hours are counted from 12 to 12, as in English time, but the day commences at sunset, thus Monday evening after sunset is equivalent to Tuesday according to Arabic calculations.

F. 44 D ” and from a report in 1923 by Sir Charles Green way, Bart., Chairman of the Company.) The Company has its origin in the grant in 1901 by H. I. M. HJ*tory. the Shah of Persia, to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy of a concession for work ing petroleum in all its forms in Southern Persia. The Company’s first venture, at Qasr-i-Shirin, was disap pointing ; oil was not found in quantities or at depths likely to prove remunerative. A second attempt was made at Mamutain, 12 miles north of Ram Hormuz and 60 miles east of Ahwaz, with a similar result. At this juncture fresh capital was sought, and obtained, from the Burma Oil Company, and the promoters undaunted by their previous failures started operations at Maidan-i-Naftun or, as it was better known to the local Lurs. 44 Masjid-i-Suliman,” (so called from the ruins of an ancient fire temple near by). Boring was begun in 1908. In May, when hope had been almost abandoned, oil was struck first in one boring, soon after in a second, and then in a third, and it became apparent that a field of great extent and richness had been tapped, as indeed has been proved by subsequent events. During 1909 the initial steps were taken to enlarge the scope and capital of the Company, which remained as before 4 4 All British ” and to start (1) a pipe line to the Shatt-al-’Arab at Abadan, 150 miles distant, and (2) a refinery at Abadan. Both these were in working order by 1911 and 1912 respectively. Early in 1914 in connection with the increasing use of oil fuel by the Navy and with the general trend of politi cal and commercial affairs His Majesty’s Government acquired a predominant share in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the All British character of which was thus permanently assured. The decision to double the pipe line and increase the size of the refinery, w^iiich had already been taken was confirmed and work pushed on with all speed by the - Board of Directors, which had been strengthened by the addition of Government directors.328 G— contd. During the war the whole output of the refinery which in 1917 mm double that at the outbreak of the war was placed at tie disposal of Government, with the exception of a comparatively small surplus of kerosine which was sold locally. The difficul ties of transport of the Expeditionary Force would have been greatly increased but for this valuable source of fuel oil, kerosine and petrol. Since the war the output of the refinery has increased annually as the following figures show : 1918- 19 Tons. 1,106,415 1919- 20 „ 1,385,301 1920- 21 „ 1,743,557 1921- 22 „ 2,327,221 whilst the production for the current year is estimated at 2,900,000 tons. Relations with the Persian Goi?#rnmcmt. During the year 1922 a very active anti-British propaganda, emanating it is believed from Bolshevist sources, has been carried on in Northern Persia. This was chiefly based on the Anglo-Per sian Agreement which has been the subject of so much comment, but it has also been directed to a considerable extent against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and other British institutions. It has been represented that the Persian Government do not receive a proper proportion of the profits made by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, that the Company by exploiting these oilfields is dissipating the wealth of the country, etc., etc. But in fact the country is making a far greater gain than her people are led to believe. In 1922 the Company paid royalty to the value of £553,795-8-4. Apart from this direct gain to her reve nue, which Persia is deriving from the Company’s enterprise, she is at the same time gaining numerous indirect advantages in payment for Persian labour, supplies of material, foodstuffs, etc. What does not appear to be understood in Persia is that a large/ proportion of the profit earned by the Anglo-Persian Company is not in anyway inherent to Persia or to the concession, but is due to the profits made on the refining, transport and distributing branches of the business, which have been estab lished outside Persia and on which fully three-fourths of the329 G — contd. Company’s capital has been expended. Were the Persian fields to be closed down to-morrow these branches of the business would still earn their profits, because they would be employed in deal ing with crude and other products from other countries. Another complaint raised against the Company is the inade quate employment of Persians. This is, however, unjust, since from the very commencement of operations in Persia local labour has been trained to the utmost possible limit and Persians have to a large extent been substituted for the Indian artisans, who were at first imported in large numbers. But it must be borne in mind that a nomad peasant cannot be converted into a. skill ed labourer by the mere wave of a wand, and no effort has been spared on the part of the Company to train and utilise local labour as expeditiously and as fully as possible. A further benefit that the country is deriving from the Com pany is a large and efficient medical and nursing staff, which not only gives free attendance to its own employees, but also to other local Persians. In addition three commodious and thoroughly up-to-date hospitals, which are equipped with operating rooms, X-Ray apparatus, and the most modern surgical appliances, have been built. In the' past the only limits to the ability of the Producing Future Proa- Conn any to give a supply of crude oil are (1) the capacity 1 *' 0 - of the pipe lines, (2) the extent of the refineries. The programme that the Company has been working on for the past few years has to bring these two facilities up to a total capacity of 5,000,000 tons per annum. The pipe lines and pumping stations have now been increased to permit of pumping this quantity of oil to the seaboard, but the refinery capacity has not yet, owing to the delays of strikes and an outbreak of fire in 1922 at Abadan, reached this figure. The refinery capacity of to-day is approxi mately 3,100,000 tons by June 1923 it should be 4,100,000 tons and by the end of the year 4,500,000, at which figure the Com pany will probably rest until in a better position to judge where further refineries can be erected to the best advantage. By this then the output of refined products at the end of 1923 should be nearly double as much as that of the present year. During 1922 additional test wells which have been put out as feelers beyond the proved areas of the fields, which the CompanyGovernment of India, Press, Simla. *</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000136_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/16</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000136</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/16</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Military Report on ’Arabistan (Area No. 13).’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1924/1924</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-19T22:14:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (179 folios)</extent><extent>A contents list (ff 4-5) and index (ff 171-177) reference the report’s original pagination system.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 181; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: the file also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Confidential military report on Arabistan [Khūzestān] compiled by Air Headquarters, Iraq, and printed by the Government of India Press, 1924.The report contains nine chapters (numbered I-IX) and seven appendices (A-G) as follows:chapter I – history (general, ancient, modern, political attitude);II – geography (boundaries, area, general description, altitude, mountains, rivers and fords, towns and villages, tracts of land, islands, fortified places, political divisions);III – climate (general, temperature, winds, rainfall, mirages, general medical and sanitary conditions, principal diseases, conditions affecting aviation and military operations);IV – economic resources (general, labour, agriculture, livestock, manufacture, power, commerce, customs, banking, revenue, tables of imports and exports);V – ethnography (general, population, races, religions, languages);VI – tribes (general, armed forces, tribes in relation to possible centres of disturbance, political attitudes, military considerations, tribal action, punitive measures, recapitulation, lists of tribes);VII – personalities;VIII – communications (general, communications by sea, inland waterways, railways, telegraphs and telephones, post, aerodromes and possible aerodromes, wireless and visual communication, principal routes by land, sea and river);IX – administration (general, government establishments, northern province, southern province);appendix A – bibliographical notes;B – weights and measures, coinage and time;C – glossary of topographical terms;D – Karun river [Rūd-e Kārūn] regulations;E – concession granted to the “Nasiri Company”;F – customs schedule;G – Anglo-Persian Oil Company.The volume contains a single map in a pocket attached to the inside back cover (folio 180).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government Central Branch Press, Simla</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>AHQ Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Arabistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karun River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Gazetteers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Roads</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000136#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
