Dear Symon, Will you please refer to your letter of the 11th December last, P.Z. 7^68/37, enclosing a copy of a letter dated 4th November, 1937, from the Government of India on the subject of the wireless stations at Gwadar and Sharjah. We have “been in communication with Tymms on the matter and you will see from the enclosures accompanying this letter that he has been made fully aware of the position. Tal. No.: HOLBORN 3434. DEPART 629508/37/C. 0.1. p v jl c 6 ; 1938 : Although we appreciate the point made hy the Government of India in their letter accompanying yours under reference that they are generally responsible for the two stations as regards call signs, frequencies etc. and have to answer enquiries regarding them, we must point out that the stations were operated and administered by Imperial Airways on behalf of the Air Ministry for some time prior to the assumption of responsibility by the Government of India. We suggest, however, that the position would be clarified if copies of the attached correspondence could be sent to the Government of India; but we should like it to be made clear that Sharjah and Gwadar are Air Ministry stations and that no instructions regarding the operation of those stations, such as changes in the hours of watch keeping, etc. should be given without prior reference to us.

With regard to the services rendered by these stations for Air France and K.L.M*, we have ascertained that these Companies are at present being provided with all the wireless facilities that they require* The existing arrangement is that the stations at Gwadar and Sharjah will, on receipt of prior notice, keep watch for any air service which is authorised to fly down the Persian Gulf, or for any private aircraft, at any time, provided the number of operators permit of the watch being kept. When the new stations are completed it is very probable that a 24—hour watch will be maintained* As regards the allocation of correspondence on administrative matters concerning these stations we agree with your suggestion that preliminary correspondence should be between the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department and Imperial Airways f local representative, provided the final arrangements are confirmed through the official channels. We have also noted from your letter that the Government of India have agreed in principle to (a) the acceptance of messages concerning reservations under Article 18 of Volume 1 of the Reglement du Service International des Telecommunications de I/Aeronautique; and (b) the inclusion of passengers' names in messages for reservations and that this will be put into effect as soon as the development of the wireless service makes this practicable.

It is agreed that my Company in its letter of 12th June last, reference GTM/SA/985, unaertook to be respon sible for the payment of landing fees at Koweit, Bahrein, Dibai, Sharjah and Gwadur, at the average rate per landing provided in the confidential estimates for landings at stopping places not coming within the scope of Clause 25(1) (a) of the Empire Agreement. The proposals relating to Sharjah and Owadur out lined in this third paragraph of the letter under reply are agreed and it is suggested that such proposals be extended to the remaining places, viz.

Sir, I em directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to Air Ministry * letter S.36920/IV of 9th June, 1937 relative to the provision by him of certain facilities at Koweit, Bahrein, Dibai, Sharjah and Owadar, and to Air Ministry letter 467967/35/PD of 25th June, 1937 regarding maintenance and operation at Gwadar, and to state that so far as Sharjah is concerned, works services will continue to be undertaken by the Air Ministry Works and Buildings Department, and meteorological facilities will be under the control of the Government of India Meteorological Department. 2. Wireless, aerodrome lighting and floodlight equipment will be provided by the Air Ministry, and Viscount Swinton desires that your Company should continue to operate these. As from the agreed date from which all-up mail for India is conveyed on this route, he will be prepared, as in the case of Gwadar, to refund your Company's reasonable expenditure actually incurred upon operation and maintenance. 3. It will be recollected that your Company undertook, by acceptance of the arrangements proposed in Air Ministry letter of 9th June referred to above, to be responsible for the payment of landing fees at the average rate per landing provided in the confidential estimates for landings at stopping places not coming within the scope of clause 25(1&gt; (a) of the Empire Agreement. Viscount Swinton proposes therefore that quarterly statements of expenditure incurred by your Company in connection with the maintenance and operation of the equipment at Sharjah and Gwadar should be submitted, a deduction being made, in the case of Sharjah, of a sum representing the equivalent of 30/- per landing, less Rs. 5 per landing paid direct by the Company to the Shaikh of Sharjah, for the actual number of landings by your Company's aircraft in that quarter, and in the case of Gwadar, of a sum representing the equivalent of 30/- per landing for the actual number of landings in the quarter. 4. Viscount Swinton desires that your Company should continue to assume responsibility for the management of the aerodrome in so far as is consistent with the terms of an agreement dated 22nd July, 1932 between His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Sharjah, and for airway and air traffic control. 5.

Dear Galpin, Please refer to your D. 0. 629508/37/D. 0. 0.A. of the 20th January 1938. The information with regard to the services to he supplied hy the radio stations at Sharjah and Gwadar has been noted. It is presumed that you will he forwarding for our official information a copy of the agreement entered into between the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways for the working of these stations. I understand from your letter that these stations (Gwadar is the one particularly concerned) will not keep watch for the K-L.M. or Air France or other such services authorised to fly over India, except when watch has to he maintained for a British service. Will you please let me know if this is a correct interpretation. If so, this cannot he regarded as very satisfactory, in view of our responsibility for the safety of aircraft in the zone west of Karachi. It is also noted that the Posts and Telegraphs Department here should communicate through official channels with the Air Ministry on administrative matters concerning these stations. Although I used this phrase in ray letter of the 3rd June, this would appear a somewhat ponderous procedure when it comes to arranging routine periods of watch required for meteorological or other purposes, and it is presumed that you would he prepared to permit preliminary correspondence to he carried on direct with Imperial Airways locally so long as the finalised arrangements are confirmed through official channels. With regard to paragraph 5 and subsequent paragraphs of your letter, instructions concerning the categories of messages which the Posts ana Telegraphs Department are prepared to accept for free transmission on the aeronautical radio service have recently been revised to bring them into line with Part II of Volume I of the Reglement du Service International des Telecommunications de L*Aeronautique, except that messages concerning reservations under Article 18 cannot at present he accepted. The Posts and Telegraphs Department have agreed in principle, however, to the acceptance of these messages as soon as the' development of the radio service makes it technically possible to do so. It may he mentioned that messages reporting the position of aircraft have always been accepted although they may not have been included specifically in the Deputy Director-General Wireless* memorandum of the 18th March 1937 and instructions in Notice to Airmen form requesting aircraft to report their positions etc. by radio are of long standing. The letter to the International Commission for Air Navigation to which reference was made in the Government of India letter to India Office dated the 27th September 1937 was in reply to the specific question raised by resolution 806 at the 23rd session of the International Commission for Air Naviga tion as to whether the countries could accept the principle of /the1 V W - 2 - the inclusion of passengers* names in messages for reservations, although it was appreciated that it would not always be possible for the countries to give effect to this at once owing to traffic congestion difficulties. The Government of India letter V-18, dated the 27th September 1957 refers to all messages under Article 18 while the letter to the International Commission for Air Navigation deals only with the inclusion of passengers* names in messages falling under Article 18. In both cases the Government of India accepts the principle involved but at the present stage of radio development is unable to bring these resolutions into effect for technical reasons.

E. 10.2.COPY By Air Mail ^9508/37/D.0*C.A. 20th January, 1938. Dear Tyirnns, Please refer to previous correspondence terminating with Gandy ! s letter of the 15th November, No. 031-3, on the subject of the wireless stations at Gwadur and Gharjah. In reply to the point raised by you with respect to the services to be rendered by Gwadur and Sharjah, the position is that it is intended primarily that the stations, v/hich will be operated and maintained by Imperial Airways on terms agreed between the Air Ministry and the Company, should assist the air services operating to India and Australia, and should also be available for use by Royal Air Force aircraft. For the time being a continuous watch will not be kept at these stations and facilities will only be available for other aircraft flying on the route if circumstances permit. As regards the inqur^y by your Posts and Telegraphs Department concerning the allocation of correspondence on the administration of Sharjah and Gwadur, we consider that this should be communicated to the Air Ministry through the official channels. We note the arrangements that have been made for the exchange of messages between the aeronautical wireless stations in India and Burma, and we should like Sharjah and Gwadur to co-operate similarly in the exchange of messages of the type enumerated in the memorandum prepared by the Deputy Director General of Wireless, a copy of which was forwarded with your letter of the 3rd June last. We would prefer, however, that these messages should be extended to include all those defined in Part II of Volume 1 of the Reglement du Service International des Tele-communica tions de 1’Aeronautique (Paris, 1937). At present, such messages as those reporting the position of aircraft and those reserving accommodation for aircraft are omitted by India. In this connection I should like to draw your attention to the letter from the Government of India to the India Office dated 27th September, 1937 (relevant extract enclosed herewith) pointing out that it would not be possible to accept messages relating to the reservation of seats as mentioned in Article 18 of Part II of the Reglement, and referring to their letter No. V.15 dated 3rd June, 1937, to the International Commission for Air Navigation; a copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. You will observe that although in the letter of 27th September, reference is made to non acceptance of messages relating to reservation of seats, the Government of India in their communication to the I.C.A.N., referred to the insertion of the names of passengers in W/T messages for reservation of seats. You will also remark that the Government of India state that while they are unable to accept Article 18, they will give effect to the remaining provisions of Part II of the Reglement. We note, however, that the memorandum issued by the Deputy Director General of Wireless, does not include the transmission /of— ■ .A (5) - 2 - of messages reporting the position of aircraft as required by Article 19 of the Reglement. As there appears to be some discrepancy on these points, we should be glad if you could inform us of the exact position in order that we may advise Imperial Airways as soon as possible in connection with the arrangements which they will have to make for the commencement of the ’'all-up’' services to India* Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

No. 031-3 Dated Simla, the 3rd June 1937. My Dear Bertram, Will you kindly refer to your D.0. letter No.485899/36 dated the 24th March last addressed to Gandy with regard to Gwadar and Sharjah Wireless stations. The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department (Wireless Branch) have recently enquired^ from us whether they should approach the Air Ministry or Imperial Airways to obtain concurrence in arrangements for regularising the exchange of aeronautical service telegrams between Karachi Wireless station and the Gwadar and Sharjah stations. I enclose a copy of the Deputy Director General of Wireless’s Memorandum regarding the exchange of messages between aeronautical wireless stations in India and Burma. Similar arrangements have already been established between Inuia anc Malaya and the Posts and Telegraphs Department now uesire to extend the same plan of co-ordination to the western end of the trans India route. Possibly you have seen the official letter addressed to the Air Ministry by Gandy No. 0-31 dated the 8th December last, in which it is pointed out that in the Berne list Gwadar W/T station bears an Indian call sign and is registered as keeping ’’continuous watch as required for aircraft”. Since that letter was written we have been informed by the Posts and Telegraphs Department that following correspondence between the Government of India and the India Office, it has now been decided that all British W/T stations in the Persian Gulf should come under the administrative control of the Indian Government and it follows, of course, that the Posts and Telegraphs Department here would be interested to know the conditions under which Gwadar and Bharjah W/T stations will be operated, and whether correspondence on administrative matters should be addressed to the Air Ministry through the official channel or direct to Imperial Airways. There is no reason why the present arrangement whereby the stations are owned by the Air Ministry, operated by Imperial Airways and under the administrative control of the Government of Inuia should not work quite smoothly, but as matters stand, neither the Posts and Telegraphs Department, from the wireless administrative stand- ooint, nor this office, from the aircraft operational standpoint, has received definite information as to the services that the two stations are intended to give. The Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment are naturally concerned because internationally the two stations are classified as bearing Indian nationality and are therefore presumed to be under the control of the Indian Goverrment* Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) P.

No.031, to which I regret that a reply has not been sent before this. There are really no ”International Obligations” with regard to the hours a W/T station shall keep open. There is only a sort of ’’Gentleman’s Agreement” whereby countries provide W/T facilities for aircraft of other countries in exchange for facilities they themselves receive or hope to receive. There is, therefore, really no ’’obligation” whatever for the W/T Stations at Sharjah and Gwadar to keep open for 24 hours on the off-chance that a foreigner might be flying down the Persian Gulf. If however, the French, or some other Government, requested us to extend the normal hours of watch of these stations either regularly or on some special occasion in order to provide facilities for aircraft, of one of their air lines, or of an individual, it would probably be decided that it was policy to do so, but it is not thought that we should be under any sort of ’’International” obligation to comply with the request. We shall soon be arranging with Imperial Airways a letter of agreement defining their responsibilities etc. at the W/T stations at Sharjah and Gwadar, under the Empire Air Mail Schemes and will naturally get as good terms as we can. When these have been settled we will let you have information as to the main features of this agreement. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) F.G.L. Bertram. G.L.

The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department will take up direct with the appropriate authorities in England questions relating to wireless stations in the Gulf other than the Gwadur and Sharjah stations. In the past the position as regards these two sta tions has been most unsatisfactory. Both stations have Indian call signs and any enquiries and complaints regarding their working have therefore beeri correctly addressed to the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department. Owing, however, to the absence of information of the system under which these stations are being worked, that Department have found it difficult to deal with such communica tions. The stations were apparently erected under the authority of the Air Ministry, and from demi- official letter from the Air Ministry, No.485899/36, dated 24th March 1937, to Gandy of the Indian Civil I K Aviation/ X vf ' Wf (n) - 2 - E-to 4-5d4 9 Aviation Directorate, it appears that the Air Ministry are arranging some kind of agreement with Imperial Airways. As the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment are generally responsible for the two stations and have to answer enquiries regarding them, it is considered that they should have been consulted officially regarding both the original arrangements made by the Air Ministry and the proposed agreement with Imperial Airways. 3. The position may be somewhat clarified when a reply is received to the Director, Civil Aviation 1 s demi-official letter to the Air Ministry, No.031/3, dated 3rd June 1937. We should, hov/ever, be grateful if you would kindly take up the whole case with the Air Ministry and arrange for our Posts and Telegraphs Department to be informed either directly or through us exactly how matters stand. / d.J.

Major Jawn^iiifT^Lun, External Affairs Dept., Government of India, Mr. Tuj^n^r. I thinlc this draft, which has “been concocted in consultation with Mr. Clauson disposes adequately of the Government of India’s rather puzzling reference. ), 53 ^ 6 - Stk* 3^7 ■/ould you please refer to your d.o. letter D. 2211-N/37 of the 11th June on the subject of the Wireless T stations in the Persian Gulf. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter we have been somewhat puzzled by the Posts and Telegraphs Department’s letter of the 25th January to the General Post Office requesting information about the terms on which the various stations have been allowed to operate and w not proposing to send any further reply. A So far as we are aware all the informaticr % on the subject that we have is already on record in India. As you know the Bushire and Bahrein stations were taken over by Cable and Wireless on the withdrawal of the I.E.T.D. from Bushire. In the case of the Bahrein station this transfer was followed by certain correspondence in 1934 (see for example , ft** H3L E. ^0. letter No. 2681/34 to the Posts and Telegraphs Department). As the Gwadur and Sharjah stations, if there is any information which is not available in India, the Air Ministry’s reply to the d.o. letter from the 3 : J OSI,S2 Director of Civil Aviation No. 031-3 of the 3rd June will no douht make it available and as to the Koweit Oil Company ! s stations there are, I think, papers on record in the External Affairs Department. Please see Clauson’s d.o. letter No. P.3. 3331/36 of the 15th July 1936 and connected papers. Your second point was to ask whether arrangements could be made for the authorities maintaining the tireless stations in the Persian Gulf to be warned that in future they would be in direct relationship with the Government of India. The Cable and Wireless Company were $© officially informed by the G.P.O. last Januar v£cf. their letter to the India Office No. 112504/36 of the 11th January of which a copy was enclosed 33 * our official letter No. 2. &amp; 0. 307/37 of thfe 2nd Februar^. Gwadur and Sharjah have, I think, always been regarded as in relationship with the Government of India n&amp;tiyk are taking steps to let the (h Koweit Oil Company know in case there should be any misconception in that quarter.

When we took transfer of E. &amp; 0. pp. 2251/37 we agreed that no action was required, as the information asked for by the P. &amp; T. Dept, was available in India (P.Z. 2657/37). If, in view of para. 3 of l ajor Hay’s letter, it is now considered necessary to write to the P. &amp; T. Dept., I should think the simplest thing (for us!), so far as Gwadur and Sharjah are concerned, would be to refer them to Fr.

Co. (Cable &amp; ’Wireless, Ltd.), who undertook to maintain doable anc^ v/ireless communications in the Gulf. Possibly E. 6c 0. Dept, may have more detailed information. In any case, as the stations w r ere in being at the time o; transier, tne G. of I* ought surely to know all about them? para. 2/Para* 2 of the note . Oar pp. don’t help on the question of direct relations with local authorities, but as Cable &amp; Wireless will no doubt inform their people in \ the Gulf of the proposed change, no action on para. 4 of ? f ajor Hay's letter seems called for. T/ oweit . Under their Commercial and Political Agreements the Koweit Oil Co. are allowed to use their own wireless for internal communication and for communication with their tankers at sea. Two stations - at Koweit and Bahrah - were established during 1936. An Indian call sign was allocated to the Koweit station by the G. of I., on the understanding that the latter were in no way responsible for the station (P.Z. 8126/36). The necessary notification to Berne was made by the G.p.Q. (P.Z. 13/37). Jj C &amp;l/lt ^ fa l*** Me /V D.O.No.Q.2211-N./37 External Affairs Department Simla. Please refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department letter No.?.l09-N./36, dated the 23rd March 1937, on the subject of the wireless stations in the Persian Gulf. 2* As from the international point of view the Government of India are now considered responsible for the British wireless stations in the Persian Gulf, I am desired to call your attention to two points. 3* Firstly, the Government of India regard it as essential that they should be fully inform ed of the conditions on which the various stations have been allowed to operate, otherwise it is impossible for them properly to fulfil the responsibility they have undertaken. The Posts and Telegraphs Department have already written to the Director of Telecommunications.General Post Office, London, on this subject, vide their Jgj gS/j letter No.7/-4371,dated the 25th January i:^ r ', whichExternal Affairs &lt; Department, The 46 M • “7 which has been passed orx to you by the British Post Office and we should be grateful if arrange ments could kindly be made for a reply to be sent to them as soon as possible. 4. The second point is that hitherto the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department have had no direct relations with authorities maintaining wireless stations in the Persian Gulf, and those authorities may be rather surprised if they suddenly receive instructions from the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department without having been informed of the change of control, life should therefore be grateful if arrangements could kindly be made for them to be acquainted by the proper authority in England of the change that has taken place.

Imperial Airways Limited while those at Bahrein and Bushire are operated by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, the latter stations having been taken over by the Company with the assets of the late Indo European Telegraph Department. Definite information oi the terms on which these Companies have been permitted to operate these stations is also not available in this Department and, before addressing the Companies, I am to enquire whether the British Post Office have issued any formal authority or could supply any information on this subject.— CD 3. I am also to say that similar information is also required in respect of the station recently proposed by Messrs.

Although, as explained by the India Office, the position in respect of this station will change from 1st April 1937, it appears that the station should be regarded as authorised by this Department for such period as it continues to use callsigns allotted from the Indian series. In this connection I should refer you to this office endorsement No. W-4371 dated the 20th January 1937, forwarding a notification to the International Bureau that the callsign will be changed from XZY to VTQ, from 1st April 1937 and to enquire whether it is proposed to allot a callsign to this station from the British series on the transfer of Aden from Indian control.

In connection with a minor matter the notification to Berne in respect of new telegraph services at Bahrein and Aden, it has come to light that the G.P.O. have hitherto performed certain functions in connection with wireless stations in the Persian Gulf which they now propose to discontinue. The notes and correspondence v/ith the G.P.O. helow the draft deal v/ith the matter in detail. The practice appears to have “been a survival from a pre-historic era. Strictly speaking these wireless stations are under the Indian telegraph administration and the G.P.O. could only he regarded as having performed these functions on hehalf of the latter. They state that in view of the inauguration of the air mail they no longer consider that it is necessary to continue this practice. The advantages of the discontinuation will he that the position v/ill now he constitutionally correct and that the potential political embarrassments of the G.P.0.3 handling quasi ^international matters in the Persian Gulf will he eliminated. On the other hand as the headquarters of the company controlling the v/ireless stations is situated iif London it v/as convenient that the G.P.O. should handle the business in question and no doubt tended to eliminate friction.

Notifications to Berpe and correspondence with thesGg) mm** ^ ujt Please see the reply of the G.P.O. to our letter ol the 7th Decemher about the Persian Gulf Wireless Station. You will see that the sturdy commonsense of the G.P.O. has ooggled at the metaphysical propositions we put to them, and that they have thrown in their hand altogether. They explain that they have hitherto been acting on behalf of the Government of India out of pure kindness of heart, and that, in view of the saving of time now that the air mail is available, and of the Government of India’s letter, they propose that the Indian Telegraph Administration should, in future, undertake all the work in question. It is satisfactory that the G.P.O. have failed to detect any difference of view between the Government oi India and ourselves, and have attributed their action to the (2/+*A/ y* 4 -^ Government of India. Their proposal has obvious r* advantages from the political point of view and seems, in general, to be commended as cutting away from the complications of procedure to which my d.o. letter of the 7th December referred. I understand from Mr. Heston that the G.P.O. do not propose to deal with any wnich the Govern.lent of India would have been quite willing to see them handle. We thus the opportunity of using them for dealing personally with the Gables and Wireless Ltd., with the possible elimination of friction that personal contact implies; but I think that the balance of advantage lies in passing the G.P.O.’s decision on to the Government of India without more ado, especially as Gable and Wireless, Ltd. have already been informed of the decision. If personal contact were necessaryin future, it should always he possiole to use this Department or the High Commissioner for the purpose. The Government of India cannot very easily come back to us, seeing that the whole procedure is ajgpjrently only a survival of the time when they had no autonomous postal A administration of their own, but if they do I understand that the G.P.O. might be willing to reconsider the matter. I have arranged for copies of the G.P.O. letters to oe sent to the Air Ministry.

We fully recognise that notifications to Berne respecting Persian Gulf Wireless Stations should properly be made by the Indian Telegraph Administration and that it is not our concern. We appear to have undertaken this work gratuitously in the past, on behalf of the India Administration, simply as a working arrange ment which saved time and trouble - as the Headquarters of the Company controlling the wireless stations concerned is usually in London.

As regards the general question of the position of British wireless stations in the Persian Gulf and neighbouring areas, Lord Zetland is in gonorfal agreement with the view stated by the Government of India in paragraphs 2 and 3 of their letter. as he understands the position, these stations regarded, for international purposes, as under the control of the Government of India,who are directly concerned with the local political administration of the areas in question and exercise many of the iunctions of Government in connection with postal matters in them. The Government of India are there fore technically responsible for these wireless stations and it would accoi dingly tall to them to make and A receive the necessary international notifications, such as those visualised under Articles 13 and 14 ^ 5(1) of the General Radiocommunication Regulations. But it will no doubt from the practical point of view, be convenient that on occasions the necessary action should be taken by His Majesty’s Government direct in matters such as that dealt with in paragraph 1 of this letter, or the questions of accounting and complaints as to interference referred to by the Government of India.When acting thus, His Majesty's Government would properly be regarded as the agents of the &gt; c» (GJr Government of India and the Department concerned, which would no doubt normally be the General Post Office and 1 1?' u i're&lt;jui#c&lt;f tiTidt the Government of India or the India Office wouitI* try Ifrplr iully informed of any action taken and where necessary, consults in advance.

Weston, Esq., Teleconjiiunications Dept., General Post Office. •' Dear Weston, Our official letter of to-day's date, numbered as above^contains an attempt to clarify the position about the Persian Gulf Wireless stations. It may be that this is restating the obvious, so far as you are concerned, but we were not quite certain whether in making the notification about the Bahrein station on April £8th you fully appreciated this position. As you are no doubt aware, political as well as technical considerations are liaole to be involved in all such developments in the Gulf, and we therefore keep a fairly close watch on them. Our official letter does , i communications on Gulf wireless matters A should go direct to the Government of India (as indicated in paragraph 3 of tne Government of India's letter) and how far they should be sent through us. We are quite content that matters of an exclusively tecnnical or routine nature should be taxen up with the Government of Inaia direct - wnich is indeed the and normal practice in postal/telecommunicationai matters relating to India itseliip. but not deal with the question how farwe would be grateiul if in all questions of importance or of potential political interest (such as for instance a notification to an International Bureau) the India Office could be icept fully informed, preferaoly in advance, of any action taken by you. tfe share the reluctance of the Government of India to go further into the position of the Aden station, since, in view of its impending transfer to the 4 Colonial Office, our interest in jgE is on the wane. It is of course at present part of British India and the position stated in our official letter therefore applies to it a fortiori until April 1st 1937, which is the date the Order in Council of last September appointed for the transfer. (Sd.) A. F. MO^! 'Y€^&gt; CC • ruu 'fcjL' kv- l 'fcc, leko (f*^ ? Secretary, Political (internal) liepartment, (Xjuuv*- &gt;&lt;JL U-Ac, . I have thought it advisable to set out the position rather fully in the official letter to the (2*1.0*,, (1) owing to the obscurities in the Government of Indian letter and (&amp;) in an attempt to reconcile the present action and paragraph 1 of the Government of India’s letter with the general position stated in paragraph Z thereof. A demi-official letter is, I think, in any case desirable in order to distinguish those matters which the G.P.0* may take up direct with the Government of India, (following the normal procedure in postal matters) and those which should come to the India Office. This gives a peg for rubbing in very gently the political aspects of the matter* I have also touched on the Aden question. O v.' • The Government of India can hardly dissent from the views contained in the demi official letter, despite paragraph 3 of their letter. ho you concur in the draftsZ .3k M Secretary, Political Department (External), I should he grateful for any observations you have to make on the action to be taken in this case. You will see from the attached file that in recent years it has been decided by this Office, against the wishes of the Government of India, that responsibility for registration under the International Telegraph Convention should be taken by the Government of India in the cases of the wireless station at Gwadur (E. &amp; 0.6799/31) and that at Shargah (E. &amp; 0.8549/33 and 8265/35). The reasons for our decision were mainly of &amp; political nature. In the present case which concerns wireless stations at Aden and Bahrein the G.P.O. appear to have behaved in an extraordinary way. Not only have they taken on themselves direct notification to Berne regarding the station at Bahrein,for which they might have been excused seeing that they do not appear to have had copies of the correspondence relating to the cases of Gwadur and Shargah, but they have even done so in the case of Aden. They state XUm. that they have ’’acted on behalf of Indian administration”, A but unless they were asked to do so in direct correspondence from the Government of India, which seems unlikely, they appear to have overlooked the fact that India is an independent member of the International Telecommunication Convention. Moreover by proposing themselves to notify the code signs of these stations although they belong to the Indian series they would appear to be ignoring Article 14 § 5 (l) of the General Radio-^ommunications'Regulations (copy attached), which distinctly says that ’’each country selects the code signs of its stations from the international series to assigned to it and notifies/the Bureau of the Union the code signs which it has allotted to its stations”. Unfortunately the G.P.O.’s letter was sent to the Government of India without comment, and the latter have2 . been so eager to seize the opportunity to reassert their views, which were overruled in the cases of Gwadur and Shargah, that they have been prepared to overlook the clear infringement of their rights in the case of Aden, especially ajisu^ as is in any case shortly passing from their control. I think that we ought to express some surprise to the G.P.O. for their action in the case of Aden; as for Bahrein, I do not know how far you wish to maintain the principle of Indian administration laid down in the Shargah case. If we wish to be wholly consistent we should, I suppose, first go back to the Government of India and tell them to think again, and then inform the G.P.O. of the position and tell them to be more careful in Persian Gulf matters in the future. But it is largely a matter for you to decide and you may think that this will be making too much of it. So far as I can make out, the Government of India in the first sentence of para.2 of their letter themselves seem to show signs of a guilty conscience, and to realise that the action which they propose in para.l is not really consistent with the general position. I am not entirely clear as to the meaning of the rest of para.2 of their letter, when they say that 'In the past all the details in cases of this kind have been arranged by H.M.G. direct with the owners of the stations”. I presume they are referring only to accounting matters and complaints as to interference, ejfc-c. , and that what they are proposing is that in regard to these two categories exceptions might be made to the general principle laid down in the first sentence of the paragraph and matters aealt with direct by r*- h H.M.G. If so, so far as infringements are concerned they would apparently be proposing a technical breach of Article 13 of the Regulations which requires such matters to be dealt ■mit, U f&gt;» ^ ' 3. with by the administration h^scl of the country to which the station is subject; for on their own hypothesis these Gulf stations are under their control, Qut in as much as it would presumably be necessary to take up such matters through the headquarters of the Companies running the wireless stations, which are presumably situsted in London, and therefore to make a reference to H.M.G. , there is probably a good deal to be said on practical grounds for allowing H.M.G. to deal with cases of this kind themselves. Any technical infringement of the Regulations could no doubt be explained a.way on the ground that H.M.G. were acting in these cases as agents of the Government of India. If I have understood the Government of India aright I should think their proposal might well be accepted. A further small obscurity relates to which Department of H.M.G. has in the past handled these cases as the Government of India state. So far as I am aware % it has not been done by this Office, but if the Government of India are referring to the G.P.O. what do they mean by M on the understanding that technical advice will be obtained from the British Post Office or otfrer competent authority”?

I am directed to say that in pursuance of the principle admitted in the Sharjah case as consnuniGated in my letter N0oF-44-N/34 dated the 14 th , November 1935, the Government of India agree that the General Post Office should complete the notification by allocation of call-signs from the Indian series (as enumerated in the General Post Office's letter foming an enclosure to your letter) to certain new telegraph services operated at the old Bahrain Wireless Station and the new iden Wireless Station* That principle was applied originally to the Persian Gulf area and would not cover Aden, but in view particularly of the impending transfer of Aden from their control, the Government of India do not wish to press this issue. They presume that the separation of Aden will in any case finally dispose of this question in so far as that dependency is concerned. 2* I am to observe that so long as the British wireless stations in the Persian Gulf and neighbouring areas (such—-—■ ■?- ' s ^*\ 1 as the Mekran Coast and Arabia) are regarded as under the control of the Government of India, it would ordinarily be necessary for such stations to receive their authorisa tion from India and for the Director General, Posts and Telegraphs, to make all necessary international notifica tions and deal with all matters relating to the traffic of the stations. In this connection it is observed that, although accounts for radio traffic are ordinarily settled direct between the accounting authorities named by the owners of the stations and included in the international lists, the administration authorising the wireless station is ultimately responsible for settling the accounts in case of dispute or failure to pay.

It will be seen from the d*p. letter of 11 th May 1935 from the P.Rt^ in the P.Gv of which a copy is enclosed that, under present arrangements, the Station will remain open for commercial traffic unless and until the Sheikh objects, which he is unlikely to do. The Secretary of State therefore considers that the official notification of the Sharjah Station as r an Aeronautical or Aircraft Station, and as a Station performing Special Services should no longer be deferred and, for the reasons stated in my letter of 1st January 1934 referred to above I am to request that the necessary steps should now be taken by the Government of India at an early date, unless they see strongio !

Imperial Airways, Ltd., who, in view of the political aspect of the question, do not feel competent to express an opinion as to whether the Sheikh should be paid or not. A division of the profits would, however, be more acceptable to them than the payment of a lump sum. The Company point out that the service was originally instituted for the benefit of the Sheikh’s subjects, and that for their part they would now prefer to be without it. It has recently been found necessary to appoint a O no T| O T| JO ■ — P3 O ^ m European operator to Sharjah at an increased expenditure’ of £150 per annum. The Company feel in consequence that if any payment is made to the Sheikh, the charge for telegrams The Under Secretary of State for India, Economic and Overseas Department, India Office, S.W.l.r*— should be increased commensurateiy with such payment.

It will be remembered that I.A. opened the station for public messages without, consultation with the Political authorities and without at any rate the formal consent ) J of the Sheikh, though they represented that the opening of the station was at the Sheikh 1 s request. It is very interesting to learn that I.A. obtained the 'written approval of the Air Council' as early as December 1932 and I think we should lodge a complaint with the A.M. about this. My «»££&amp;&amp;&amp;*#¥*. is that the A.M. have in the past pretended innocence on this question and put all the blame on their proteges, I.A. Meanwhile the Government of India have trailed a red herring across the real question of official notification and registration of the station at Berne, since apparently the notification made by the Cable Company does not amount to official notification and the call sign has still to be officially registered. We might now, I think, reply to the Government of India | explaining the misunderstanding which has occurred (a copy of the Cable Company 1 s letter will do this) and saying that it does not affect our views as to the official/&lt;lS official notification^expressed in Mr. Turner’s letter of 1st January (E.&amp; 0.8549/33). We can agree however that no further action necessary by way of notification need be taken until the Sheikh's formal consent to the opening of the station to the public is obtained, if in fact it proves possible to obtain it. At the same time we can forward the corresponden to t-he A.M. and ask them^the position vis-a-vis the Sheikh to I.A. and obtain the views of the latter on the Sheikh’s proposals. On receipt of these we can consider what further action should be taken in regard ce to the station. ( Cv«^ 6v&lt;- 1 UJX l i+rL . ^ ^ ivw ck y Ct cuc^ i( Lr*. . Cr% ^ CMtAA , LG* L Gl-rU.

We were informed by Imperial Airways that they had established a receiving and transmitting wireless set at Shargah and had received applications from the local sheikh to receive and transmit public messages. At that time all public messages tendered at Shargah were held for the arrival of the steamer which called at Dabai fortnightly. A s Imperial Airways would be employing a certified operator at their station at Shargah enquiry was made as to whether this Company would have any objec tion to the exchange of messages to and from Shargah with our station at Bahrein; Imperial Airways were informed that we were in agreement with the|.r suggestion. December 1932. We were informed by Imperial Airways that they had received written approval from the Air Council of the above proposal, and that the Air Council wished to know on what basis the charges were to be made for the transmisaon and reception of public messages at Shargah. The charges were submitted to Imperial Airways who advised us on the 4th January 1933 that the Airm 2 . Ministry approved the basis thereof. January 1933. Imperial Airways informed us that they had instructed their Near East Representative to put the scheme into operation as early as possible. On the 7th March 1933 we received the following letter from Imperial Airways:- 'It appears that your representatives at Bahrein have not been informed of the arrangements re the trans mission of commercial messages from Shargah as set out in our letter of the 4th January; neither have your people in India and Iraq and elsewhere been informed that Imperial Airways station at Shargah is open to accept commercial traffic. 'This is a result, we believe, of your not being specifically informed that the service had been commenced in accordance with our letter of the 13th January. 'If you will take steps to adjust these two points the service should proceed without any further trouble.' In order to comply with the request in the last paragraph of the above letter, we had no alternative but to notify the opening of the service through the Inter national Bureau of the Telegraph Union at Berne . Imperial Airways were so informed on the 10th March 1933# and tha.t the Bureau had circulated this information telegraphically to all interested Administrations. I am.

Sir, With reference to Mr* Turner’s letter No.E.&amp; 0.8549/33, dated the 1st January 1934, I am directed to forward a copy of letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, No .984/14-222 of 1934, dated the 28th April 1934, end to request that, if the Secretary of State sees no objection, the position may be explained to Messrs. Imperial Airways Limited and their reply communicated to the G-overnment of India. 2. as regards the registration of the wireless station at Sharjah I am to say that the Director G-eneral, Posts and Telegraphs has brought to the notice of the Government of India that the station has already been notified to the International Bureau at Berne as a telegraph office, and appears on page 9 of the ”Annexe No.36 a la Nomenclature Officielle des Bureaux Tdlegraphiques” dated 1st May 1933. The Government of India are not aware of the identity of the authority which communicated the information to the Berne Bureau. The Sharjah station does not, however, yet appear either in the List of Aeronautical Stations and Aircraft Stations, or in the List of Stations performing SpecialSpecial Services. In order to avoid any confusion it would appear to be necessary for the same administration or authority which notified Sharjah as a telegraph office eventually to notify the station for these purposes as well. 3. The Government of India themselves incline to the view that the station should not have oeen notified * at all until some formal arrangement had been made with the Shaikh on whose territory it is situated, and, as will be seen from the enclosure to this letter,they have been engaged in correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with a view to securing a satisfactory agreement in this respect trom the Shaikh of Sharjah. They consider that such further action as may be necessary in the direction ol notifying particulars of the station for inclusion in one or more of the lists published by the Berne Bureau should be deferred until the Shaikh’s formal agreement is forth coming. When this agreement is secured, they would suggest that, in view particularly of the fact that India is likely to have no financial concern m the maintenance of the Sharjah station, the duty of taking such further steps as may be necessary to effect registration, including the registration of abbreviated telegraphic addresses, could, if there is no objection, be more appropriately assigned to the administration or : authority which has already notified it as a telegraph office and presumably is in possession ot the latest information. I have the honour to be, Your most obedient servant, .. 5^? ^ V Foreign Secretary to the Government of India HJ.Copy of a letter Imo• 984/14/222 of 1934, dated Bushire, the 28th April 1934,from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. tireless Telegraph Station at Sharjah. I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.216, dated the 31st January 1934,concerning the installation of a wireless station at Sharjah. 2. I regret that I am still unable to give you a definite reply for I have not yet succeeded in getting a satisfactory reply from the Shaikh. 3. When I was on my way back from India the other day I interviewed the Shaikh,who again said that what he wanted was either (A) a lump sum payment or (B) a share in the profits. 4. Presumably B would be more acceptable to the Company than A, but I do not know, of course, whether they are willing to give either. As I pointed out to the Shaikh the use of the Imperial Airways Wireless Telegraph by the public is mainly for the benefit of the Shaikh’s subjects and if the Company are unwilling to pay a subsidy or a percentage of the profits,! would propose informing the Shaikh and asking him whether he desired the station to remain open to the public. The Station, in any case, would of course continue to carry out its primary function i.e. service messages for Imperial Airways.Ho.24C of 1933.

The Foreign Secretary With reference to your letter to the Government of India, .of the 26th June, 1953, No. F.115-N/33 Foreign &amp; Political Dept relative to the registration of the wireless station at Shargah, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to inform you that he has given consideration to the arguments advanced therein against the registration of this station being undertaken by the Government of India. 2. As the Government of India aware, consideration of the somewhat analagous case of the Gwadur Station, has made it clear that there are difficulties in the completion of formalities such as registration in regard to wireless telegraph stations in the protected areas of the Gulf region. The Rulers of the Sheikhdoms in which they are situated are not themselves signatories of the Berne Convention; they are precluded by the terms of their Treaties from dealing with foreign powers etc., and, on general political grounds, it is desired to excite V&amp; minimum of international interest in their position and their special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. The choice, therefore, lies between discharge of such functions on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government in the United2 Kingdom as the power responsible for the conduct of their political relations or by the Government of India as the Government directly concerned with the local political administration of these areas. Your letter of the 26th June set out various arguments in favour of the former alternative to which the Secretary of State has given his consideration, but apart from circumstances special to the present case, he has decided that it 4 s undesirable that either the present or other W.T. stations which may be established in the tribal areas of the Gulf, should be dependent on any authority other than that which is responsible for the immediate control of their affairs, and which already exercises many of the functions of Government in connection with Post Offices established in this area. The connection of the Indian administration with this area has of course become even closer during recent months, as the result of transfer to the India Office of the functions previously performed by theColonial Office in regard to the Persian Gulf, and the primary responsibility for the administration and for the conduct of the political affairs of the Gulf Sheikhdoms is now concentrated in the India. Unless, therefore, therv^ Draft Paper Department I attention to any consideration of substance in connection with this matter, which has been hitherto overlooked, the Secretary of State would be glad if the necessary steps for the registration of the Shargah station may be taken by the Government of India without further delay. A copy is enclosed of a further letter from the Air Ministry setting out certain additional particulars. The Government of India will no doubt consider whether a change in the call sign of the station is desirable. 5 . I am to forward with this letter copy of a letter from the Air Ministry relating to an enquiry by Imperial Airways in regard to the registration of telegraphic addresses at Shargah. In this matter as in others, the Secretary of State considered it desirable that stations in the Gulf area should conform generally with the Indian system, and he will accordingly be glad if the Government of India will take the necessary steps in correspondence with krCA^ the 1 e-gal representatives of Imperial Airways, to regularise the arrangements for telegraphic addresses at Shargah on the analogy of the Indian Regulations. -r.inMrO (Sd.)

As you will have seen, the Government of India at the date of that letter were very reluctant to assume responsibility for the registration of the Shargah wireless station. We had meant to discuas the point with you during your leave, but did not have an opportunity to do so. It is a relatively small one,but as you will see from our official letter referred to above, while we recognise the force of the arguments adduced by the Government of India against registration of the station being undertaken by them, we think it very important, especially now r that the Colonial Office has ceased to exercise any responsibility in respect of the Gulf and that its affairs are coordinated by the Government of India and the India Office, to avoid the introduction of any outside Imperial authority, more particularly in a 2262 5000 11.33ir- IPMSRI : •' rr ' relatively petty question such as the present, and on a subject other aspects of which are already handled solely by the Government of India.

This has been referred to the Post Office also and if the Post Office are to register Shargaj* then the whole thing is a question for them. If not, what Airways do there must be regulated by the Indian rules. (3) Question, of registration. The Gulf has now been transferred by the Cabinet finally to the India Office and if the telegraph system, like the Post Office, is to be an Indian one throughout the Gulf it would be proper that India should be told that the Secretary of State thought it best that public telegraph offices in the area should be dealt with as Indian offices, in which case the Political Department in India would have to deal with the Indian Post Office and secure registration with an Indian nmber. It is of no great importance but if there are to be more stations it is untidy that the Shargar station should be under G.P.O. registration while the rest are Indian, and I am prepared to agree that,if the system is to be Indian, India shall be ordered to register in this case. I have spoken to Laithwaite and he is having certain researches made by Mr. I.lorley and asks that these papers may be held up meanwhile.0^ A.M.Ref 255487/32/SignaIs ADASTRAL HOUSE, MINISTRY, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 7th September 1933. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, 1933 , I wrote you in Duncan’s absence on the 10th May, 1933, forwarding particulars of Sharjah W/T station for insertion in the Berne List. The direction finding station at Sharjah is now calibrated and ready to give bearings to aircraft, and should, accordingly, appear in the List of Special Services under the heading of aeronautical direction finding stations. Would you be so good as to arrange for the attached particulars to be submitted by the Government of India. We have no record of the M V” call sign allotted by India to this station as the earlier entry has not yet been published. Yours faithfully J.G.

The depreciated value at wnick this line appears on the books of the late Indo-European Telegraph Department is, in j round figures, 3s. 3,85,000. Interest on this amount at 3.3252K&gt;, which, being the rate applicable to pre-1916/17 capital expendi- ture applies to the greater portion of the capital cost of this line, comes to about Ra. 13,000, while the annual contribution for depreciation to a sinking fund accanulating at 4/o compounu interest on an assumed life of 40 years comes to about Rs. 7,u00. In addition to these two items the annual cost of maintenance, exclusive of certain overhead charges like pensionary liability etc., comes to Re. 40,000 inclusive of Rs. 8,200 paid as subsi dies to local chiefs for protection of the line. The total expenditure on the line thus comes to Ra. 60,000 and the net iosBn on the maintenance of this line for which the Indian tqo us and Telegraphs Department will have to accept liability cones to Rs. 50,100 (Re 60,000 - 9,900). 4 . enquiries of the military and political authorities mentioned in the Viceroy’s (Industries and Dabour Depar tment's ) telegraB|4t&gt;5-'XPV30 dated the 27th March 1931 to the secretary of•4- ^ of State have elicited the reply that neither of them attaches any military or political isportance to the maintenance of the line and that they are not prepared to incur any financial lia bility on this account* xhe maintenance of a telegraph office at Omara is, however, of interest to the Meteorological Depart ment which, on account of aerial navigation, attaches consider able importance to the weather observations at that place and to their speedy transniasion to proper quarters* It will thus be clear that apart from the necessity of providing a line for the use of the Imperial and International jommuni cation a, Limi ted, the oenefita from the maintenance of the line are not cosxrienaurate with the expenditure in which the Indian Poata and Telegraphs Department would be involved. The Government of India have therefore caused investigations to be made regarding the possibility of providing cheaper telegraph facilities at the three offices, and these investigation a have revealed that it is feasible to provide low-power wireless stations at Oxmara j and Paani capable of working direct with the Posts ana Tele graphs wireless station at Karachi on the one side, and with another station at Gwsdur on the other if one can be made avail able at the last place* a matter which is dealt with in para graph 12 of this letter. The capital cost of the three wireless stations is estimated at about Ha. 10,000 each, while recurring cost of working each station, inclusive of interest and depre ciation, would amount to Ha. 6,000 per annum, in addition to the cost of operating the three combined offices at Gr«&amp;dur, pasni and Ormara which is being incurred at present. The require menta of the Government of India and the Indian Posts and Tele- graphs Department could thus be met adequately by dismantling or abandoning the lines and erecting the three wireless sta tions and if this is done the commercial accounts of the Posts and Telegraphs Department would benefit by about ffe. 42,000 per annum. In reality however the financial benefit from abandoning this line would be somewhat greater, as it is understood that, * “ owingowing to its nearness to the sea co&amp;at, it is subject to he&amp;Yy corrosion and that costly reconstruction will be necessary in the near future* 5* The position as regards the inland lines from Karachi to Bakri via. Sh&amp;ho&amp;z and Panjgur is not essentially different* Apart from Gisadur this line serves three combined offices at Bela, i'anjgur and Turbat, the revenue and operating costs of which are • Telegraph Revenue Postal Revenue Total Revenue irking Expenses k fis &amp; k 1,600 800 2,400 6,000 Panjgur 3,400 2,600 6,000 3,100 Turbat 1,500 2,500 4,000 2,200 TOTAls 6,500 5,900 12,400 9,100 The surplus of the combined revenue over the cost of the combined operating staff is even smaller than in the pre vious case being only Hs* 3,300 per annum* The depreciated value of the line amounts to about Hs* 6,40,000, interest on which at 3.3252* comes to about Hs. 21,000. The contribution to the depreciation fund amounts to about Hs* 10,000 and the annual coat of maintenance to Hs. 35,000 inclusive of Rs* 7,500 paid to local chiefs as subsidies for protecting the line. The net loss cm this line thus cones to about Hs. 63,000. In addition to serving the three combined offices and Gwadur, this line is alao used by the Mekran Levies j wno have superimposed telephone circuits on some sections of itj but for this facility they do not make any contribution either directly or in the shape of rents* The military authorities do not attach any importance to this line but Ut political auunoritiee in Baluchistan are naturally concerned at the prospect of having no telegraphic communication with the rest of India if this line should be dismantled* The Govt*7. v * Grovbniment of India are of opinion that even after making due allowance for the requirements of the political authorities and the ^ekran Levies the loss incurred on the maintenance of this line is disproportionate to the advantages 9 and the Posts and Telegraphs Department has accordingly investigated in consulta* tion with the political authorities a scneme for erecting low- power wireless stations at Bela* Panjgur* and Turbat and for supplying wireless telephone sets at the different posts of the Mekran Levies* It has been estimated that suitable wireless stations could be installed at Bela* Panjgur and Turbat for a capital cost of about Hs« 12*OCX) and at an annual recurring cost of tfs* 6*000 inclusive of interest and depreciation* for each station* As a result of replacing this line by wireless stations the ccumercial accounts of the Posts and Telegraphs Jepartment would thus benefit by Rs* 4b*000 being the reduction in the annual loss* it being assumed that the cost of installing and maintaining wireless telephone sets at the Mekran Levy posts will be borne by the Mekran Levy authorities* 6. Taking the two lines together it will be seen that telegraphic facilities adequate to meet all requirements can be met by dismantling both lines and erecting wireless stations* and that such action would reduce the loss on working by about Rs 90*000 per annum* Lven with these arrangements the loss to the Posts and Telegraphs Department would be considerable* viz** Rs* 6*000 in respect of the wireless stations at Oraara* Paini and Owadur and Rs* 15*000 in respect of those at Bela* Panjgur and furbat* leas any amount that might be recovered from the Mekran Levies for providing them with any necessary telephone service* The amount is sufficient to cause concern to the Government of India in their present financial situation* and in any case it is clear that the Posts and Telegraphs Department cannot be expected to incur the heavy loss involved in retaining one or both of the lines merely to meet political requirements*7. The position as set out in the preceding paragraphs is however modified considerably by the fact that Imperial and International Communication* Limited, require a line for maintaining through comnunicaticc between Karachi and Persia* Under the treaty concluded between His Majesty's Government and Persia a British Agent has been authorised to work and maintain the land line from Jaak to Gwadur the greater portion of which lies in Persian territory* fhe only agents to this work can be entrusted are the Imperial and International Conimunicatians, Limited, but that line would be useless unless they can ariange to secure a line connecting Karachi with Gwadur. A provision for a circuit being made available to the company was included as item 6 of the memorandum of con* ditions accompanying India Office letter dated the 26th Augast 1950 to the Chairman, Imperial and International Communications limited (copy forwarded to the Government of India with India Office letter No # j£. &amp; 0* 7860/30 dated the 21st November 1930)| It will be seen from the clause in question that the Jask-Kara chi line was to be handed over to the company on a nominal rental of fts* 10 per annum, the company being responsible for upkeep and outpayments and for providing, on terms mutually to be arranged, a circuit for the use of the Indian Posts and Telegraphs department to work the telegraph offices at Ormara, Pasni and Gwadur* Subsequently, it was proposed, in order to relieve Imperial and International Communications, limited, of their difficulties to alter the position so that the main tenance of the portion of the Jask-Karachi line within Indian limits (viz* Samankaur-Karachi) should be undertaken by the Indian Posts ana itolegraphs Department, who would provide suitable facilities to the company on terms to be settled* It is thus clear that th^ requirements of the situation would not be met coupletely if both the land lines in question were dis mantled and that if a landline must be retained this is so chiefly, if not entirely, in the interests of the Imperial and Intemationi MUM*' . -44International Conimunication 3 , Limited. 8. As either of the lines can serve for maintaining tele* graphic communication between Karachi and Gvadur the Government of India do not consider it necessary that both of them should be retained in future. Of the two routes that along the coast serving Paani and Ormara involves heavier out-of-pocket expenses, the maintenance coat being Ra» 40,000 as against Rs. 35,000 for the Karachi-Panjgnr-Gwadur line; also the condition of the for mer line is such as to require heavy outlay on renewals in the near future if it is to be maintained. The line from Karachi to Panjgur and thence to Gwadur is in much better condition and though the wire mileage over which communication would have to be maintained by that route is greater than that of the coast line there are no technical difficulties in maintaining such communication. Informal enquiries from the local representa tives of the Imperial and International Co^nnunications, Limited, indicate that they would have no objection to working this circuit instead of the direct circuit along the coast to Gwsdur. One of the two through wires on the line via ^hahbaz and Panjgux may be placed at the disposal of the Imperial and International OommixiicationSf Limited, if suitable terms can be negotiated, while the other through wire would be used by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for maintaining telegraphic communica* tion with lUrbat and Gfwadur, and the third wire on the section Karachi-Panjgur would be utilised for serving the combined offices thereon. To provide telegraphic oonmunications at Pasn/ and Ormara wireless stations could be erected at these places. A third station would not then be required at Gwadur as it woul4 still be connected by a land line with Karachi. The Government of India are accordingly of opinion that if suitable terms can be arranged with Imperial and International Ccxamunications, Limited, the proper course is to dismantle or abandon the coast line, retain the line via Panjgar, and erect wireless stations at Omar a and Pasni. 9.As regards the terns for the use of one wire by Imperial and International Communications! limited, attention is drawn to certain calculations by dir kaurioe Simpson which were received with Mr* Turner*s demi-official letter No* tf* &amp; 0* 144/31, dated the 23rd June 1931, according to which the annual cost of the line Gwadwk&amp;rachi was estimated at Hs* 37,000 per mnm ana it was proposed that this amount should be shared equally between the Company and the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department. Apparently t&gt;ir Maurioe Cimpson overlooked the necessity for providing for interest ana depreciation. It is doubtful whether it is correct to exclude depreciation. Uhder clause 6 of the memorandum of con ditions airestfiy mentioned the Co Dp any was liable for upkeep and outpayments. On any interpretation ’upkeep* would include the cost of such renewals and reconstructions as might be necessary from time to time and theoretically a contribution to a depreciation fund is the equivalent of such expenditure* The Goveriznent of India are therefore of opinion that the contribution for deprecia tion must be included in any estimate of the cost of maintaining the line* As regards interest the position is somewhat different. It is obvious that no concern can obtain capital without paying for it and that the payment may take the fora either of interest or of dividend. In the foraer case it would be an outpayment while in the latter it would be an appropriation of profits. As the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department has to pay interest on any capital that it borrows for e-re^fcing of assets and as this principle will apply equally in the case of any of the lndo-&amp;uropean land lines that may be included in its block account the charge for interest is an outpayment as far as the department is concerned. It follows that its amount must be included in any calculations that may be made to determine the proper smount of charge to be made to an out sider for facilities that may be provided. It is of course equally arguable that the word 'outpayments' as used in the nsmorandun of conditions agreed to by the Imperial and international Communication limited, does not include interest, as normally a comnercial concern does not incur any large liabilities on account of interest out only- 10 - p&amp;ya dindeoda. In any case the Government of India are not aware ox the exact intention underlying the use of the word in the memorandun of conditions and they are prepared to leave thia matter to oe settled in negotiation between the Secretary of State in Council &lt;xi the one hand and the Canpany on the other# ^• kJ ° ^ ar aa Can oe estimated at present the financial results of retaining the line Karachi-Panjgur-Gwadur, dismantling or abmctoning Uxat between Karachi and Gwaiur via.

The Government of India realise that this amcunt is probably larger than the value of the traffic passing over the line in question but against this it has to be remembered that the line passes throu^i difficult countryV ^ and that even on the terns proposed the Government of India will oe involved in very heavy loss cn maintaining a line which in their view hae to he maintained solely in the interests of Im perial and International Communications Limited. It may also be pointti out that if the Conpany undertook to maintain the line themselves their costa would be, if anything, more than what is now proposed. If, it should be decided by the secretary of State in Council that interest on the depreciated value of the line cannot properly be included under 'outpayments', for this pur» pose the total cost of keeping the line intact would be Rs. 45,000 per anmm, a moiety of which payable by Imperial aid Inter national Communications, Limited, would be Ra. 22,500 per annan. 11. Ab stated in paragraph 2 of this letter the depreciat ed value of the lines mentioned in paragraph 2 has not been incluied in the biock account of the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department pending a decision as to their ultimate fate which cannot be reached until terns have been negotiated with Imperial and International Communications, limited, 12. ,e take this opportunity of dealing with the sugges tion contained in Mr. ifeyner's demi-official letter No. S. 4 0. 5590/55 dated the 12th May 1953, that the Government of India should take over the maintenance and operation of the wireless station at Gwadur widen is being worked at present by imperial Airways, Limited, as indicated in paragraph 3 of this letter the commercial telegraph traffic originating at Gwadur is not heavy, the annual revenue being Rs. 6,600. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of this letter will also make it clear that, if tbs land line from Karachi to Gwaaur yia Panjgur could also be dismantled in addition to that along the coast, the provision of a suitable wireless station at Gwadur to work with the stations proposed for Paani and Orm&amp;ra and with such other stations &amp;a it may be necessary to erect in Baluchis tan on the dismantlement of the Karachi-pan jgur-Gwadur line, would be necessary. Informal an quins* were accordingly made to ascertain whether the use of Imperial ‘2 am- 12 - Airvaye station could be secured on terms to oe settled and these enquiries seem to have led to the suggestion mentioned above* As has been made clear in this letter such an arrange- ment sou id, tfiile adequate to meet the requirements of the Posts and Telegraphs Department, not suit Imperial and Inter national Communications, Limited* in the position as it exists therefore the Government of India do not require a wireless station at Gwadur for any purpose of their osn ana they could not agree to the suggestion to take over the main tenance and operation of the station in question, unless purely as an agent on behalf of the Air Ministry or Imperial Airmys, Limited, in which case the Government of India would expect to be reimbursed the entire cost of maintaining the station includ ing the usual proportion of overhead charges* FHarther as txie land line between Gwadur and KaXajchi \aould continue to exist the commercial traffic that would be handled at the wireitiss station would be negligible, being limited to canmunications with aircraft, etc* I am also to add, however, that in case this sug g estion is likely to be acceptable the Government oi India would wish to have a further opportunity of examining it after obtaining detailed information and the present expression of their views should not be taken as committing them in #iy way Lastly, ths reasons which in the opinion of the Government of India preclude their taking over the maintenance and operation \of the station would naturally also stand in the way of their contxibuting a subsidy in case it were decided that the working of the station should be entrusted to Imperial and International Jonmunications, Limited* I have the honour to be, Lir* Your most obedient servant.

My Company have found it necessary to engage a peon at Shargah at the rate of Rs.20 per month for the delivery of telegrams received.

Nor do they seem to have adopted a particularly helpful attitude in regard to the registration of the wireless station. As was recognised in our letter to them, we are to some extent asking them to stretch a point by making themselves responsible for the registration and they are, of course, quite entitled to say that they are unwilling to go as far as the Secretary of State would like them to. On the other hand, the Government of India are responsible for the running of the Bahrein Post Office, which is very much farther west than Shargah. Their Director at Karachi has been in correspondence in regard to the Post Office at Shargah with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and they are also responsible for the postal arrangements in Miscat. (I do not press the fact that Indian stamps are used in Koweit or that the Government of India have been closely associated with postal arrangements there^ because the postal arrangements in that State are at present under reconsideration). There seems in the circumstances, particularly having regard to the general desirability of keeping responsibility for Gulf administration in the hands of the Government of India, something to be said for iraising the point with them again in the light of the Considerations adduced above. anjfc=ttsis- I do not wish to press_ ect ^ VnIv IX Tfc u l^/lrv'Ga tvt.

DriAPT LETTER. The Secretary, Air Mnistry, Adastrah House Kingsway, W.C. 2 Crfa fa ( 'PholU, f ?0 1712.V 5000 3.33- Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the letter to the Government of India dated 19th IvAy, No. P.Z.2515/33, on the subject of the registration of the public wireless telegraph station at Shargah, of which copies were sent to the Air Ministry under India Office letter of 19th toy, No. P.Z.2515/33. 2 . The Government of India have now replied strongly urging that they should not he asked to accept responsibility for registration of the Shargah wireless station. Whila recognisfea^ that the station at Gwadur has been assigned a call sign from the series allotted to British India,7they point out that the Gwadur station lies on the Indian side of the Persian frontier and very much closer geographically to India than Shargah. They further represent that, as the Shargah station will be open for public international correspondence the rates of charge should be notified internationally through the International Bureau of the Telegraph Union at Berne and that the station must be entered in the International list/list of telegraph offices, and they represent that the fact that the Government of India have no concern with the fixation of these charges is an additional reason in favour of the notification of the necessary information to the Bureau either hy the Air Ministry or hy the General Post Office. A furtherargument in favour of this course is that they understand that similar action has been taken in other cases in respect of wireless stations with which the Air Ministry is concerned in various parts of the world. 3. The Secretary of State does not | wish to press the Government of India on the matter in view of their obvious reluctance to undertake registration of this station and he would suggest that in the circumstances the simplest course would be that either the Air Ministry or the G.P.O. should make themselves responsible for registration. It may be renarked that if this suggestai is accepted it will have the effect of regularising the use of the existing call sign G.P.O., since it is clearly desirable that call signs for the station should be chosen from those allotted to the controlling administration. 4.

Dated Simla, the 26th June 1933 Registration of the public wireless station at Shargah. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the Secretary of State*® express letter No.P.Z. 2893/33 dated the 26th May 1933, on the subject of the registration of the wireless station at Shargah, I am directed to say that the Government of India hare no doubt that particulars connected with this station should be communicated to the International Bureau of the Telegraph Union at Berne by the Air Ministry or British Post Office rather than by the Government of India, for the following reasons. 2. No analogy can be drawn between the present case and that of the Gwadur wireless station, referred to in Mr.Walton’s letter dated the 19th May 1933, since the Gwadur station lies on the Indian side of the Persian frontier and had been assigned a call sign from the series allotted to British India. On the other hand the Government of India are in no way concerned With the much more distant station of Shargah,which is situated in Arabia. Moreover, as the station will oe open for public international correspondence the rates of charge should be notified internationally through the Bureau and the^ station must be entered in the International list c- telegraphoffices. India has no concern with the fixation of these charges, and for this reason also the information should nbt be notified by this country. 3. It is observed that the reason for which the Secretary of State, though recognising a slight anomally in notification by the Government of India (it appears to the Government of Ir05* to be wholly anomalous), desired that this course should be adopted, was the undesirability on political grounds of permitting the adhesion of Rulers of the Persian Gulf to international conventions or allowing them to communicate direct with foreign powers or international bodies; while a notification could not be made by Imperial Airways. The possibility however of a notification being made by the Air Ministry or by the British Postt Office does not appear to have been considered, and the Government of India are of the opinion that as His ajesty^ Government in the United Kingdom are much more closely connected with the establishment and working of the Shargah station, the necessary communication to the Berne Bureau should be made by them. It is understood that similar action has been taken in other cases in respect of wireless stations with which the Air Ministry is concerned in various parts of the World. Incidentally the procedure suggested would regularise, the use of the existing call-sign *G P 0* since it is desirable that call-signs be chosen from those alloted to the controlling administration. 4. For these reasons it is suggested action be taken by the Air Ministry or the British Post Office. The Government of India regret they are unable to do so.

The Secretary of the Imperial Communications Committee presents his compliments to the Under Seci-etary of State, India Office, and is directed hy the Chairman to dra^/ attention to the accompanying extracts from the Ainutes of the P6th Meeting of the Imperial Communications Committee,held on 19th July, 1933.c 3. SHARGAii WIRELESS STATION , (I.C.C. 1506.) THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a copy of a letter (with enclosure) from the Economic and Overseas Department, India Office, to the Secretary of the Committee, regarding the wireless station recently established at Shargah on the Arabian coast by the Air Ministry for air service purposes (I.C.C. 1506)* MR. VERNON observed that the air station recently established at Shargah by the Air Ministry for ain service purposes was, owing to a misunderstanding, made available for the reception and transmission of public messages. This question was considered interdepartmentally when it was decided, subject to the consent of the Sheikh, that it would be of advantage if this station continued to operate as a public station and was registered as such at Berne. -he India Office have asked the Government of India to take the necessary preliminary steps to give effect to these decisions. MR. ROBINSON expressed surprise that a decision had been taken on this point without reference to the Committee. CAPTAIN MURRAY agreed* MR. VERNON suggested that the Committee mi gilt record the view that they felt that it would be better if any question of this nature was, in the first instance, referred to the Committee for consideration. WING C0JU1ANDER LYWOOD observed that the public messages passed by this station really only amounted to a few messages for the Sheikh. CONCLUSION. It was agreed to take note of the above correspondence. 10 .11 . \S7 4. STRATEGIC CABLES, (I.C.C. 1512.) irlE COICvIITTES had under consideration a letter from i.Iajor Collins of the Union of South Africa, regarding the submarine cables on the East coast of Africa. (I.C.C. 1512). MR. VERNON observed that Major Collins, who had taken the place of Mr. H.J. Lenten on the Strategic Cables Sub committee, had ascertained that the submarine cable on the East coast of Africa no longer landed 0 n Portuguese territory, and now ran Duroan - Zanzibar - Aden, with branch cables from Zanzibar serving Mombasa, Ear es Salaam and on to Seychelles. Tlus information xoifllled one of the conditions stipulated in two of the conclusions reached by the Strategic Cables Sub committee in their Report (I.C.C. 1466). Referring to the last paragraph of Major Collins f letter, nc observed that there was a contemplated change in the land lines between Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. A proposal had been put forward to discontinue the line running across Portuguese territory between Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia, and the Colonial Office had approached oht; Compan3r and asked for tneir views. The proposal included thb establishment of wireless services in place of the land The Company had, in principle, be' line Carry out these alterations, but disposed to asked for further information, CAPTAIN MUREAY said, arising out of the question of the -^ocontiuuance cx the land line through Portuguese territory, he felt that the Union of South Africa should be kept informed of these developments as they might possibly affect '-heir defence schemes. CONCLUSION. It was agreed (a) to take note of the letter from Major Collins (I.C.C. 1513);(fc) to instruct the Joint Secretaries to issue a corrigenda slip for attachment to the str£t egic Cables Sub-Committee 7 , -T' 0 *-, . 6 ' ind:i c ating that the Mombasa - luroan line is no longer landed on Portuo-uese territory; ° (c) to ask the Colonial Office to consider the question of keeping the Government of the Union of South Africa informed as to any developments which take place regarding the discontinuance of the land line through Portuguese territory*9 INTERNATIONAL RADIOTELEGRAPH COWEIITION, (I.C.C. 1504.) THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note from the United States Embassy in London indicating that the Argentine Republic had ratified the International Radiotelegraph Convention, signed at Washington on November 25th, 1927 (I.C.C. 1504). CONCLUSION. It was agreed (a) to take note of the above correspondence (b) to instruct tne Joint Secretaries to communicate this information to the W/T Board.11 comma cat i ons in china (I.C.C. 1509.) THE COMMITTEE took note of a Paper 'by the Joint Secretaries indicating that a number of documents have been received by them in connection with the agreement entered into between the Cable Companies and the Chinese Government (I.C.C. 1509). As it was not considered necessary to circulate all these documents, in view of the successful conclusion of negotiations s a list of the documents was attached to I.C.C. 1509 for reference. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l,, 19th July, 1933Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Dept., India Office, London, S.W. 1, and the following number quoted:— ^ rO . u* Cf t+l Reference to yn'evious correspondence: Letter the India Office of the / $ tf 2 jf? ^~ 7 33 / INDIA OFFICE, 2 -- !33'i9— m Mr.Rayner, Please see Admiralty letter below.

Dear Mr .Laithwaite, With reference to your letter addressed to Plight Lieutenant Duncan, and dated 9th May 1933, in which you request details of the wireless station at Sharjah, I enclose a schedule which gives all the information which the Government of India will require for the registration of the station. Flight Lieutenant Duncan is abroad and we do not expect him back before the end of the month. Yours, &amp;c.&gt; (Sgd.) L.A. SWEMY« J.G. Laithwaite Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1.P.Z. 2515/33 Our agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah for the establishment of an air station at Shargah is flagged on P.Z.4664/32. As will he seen, no specific mention is made ii it of the erection of a wireless telegraph station even for merely air purposes. Colonel Fowle, in paragraph 8 of his despatch of 9th August 1932, on P.Z.4979/32, commented on this, and recorded conversations between Colonel Dickson and the Sheikh which seemed adequately to cover the point so far at communication between the air station and aircraft on air purposes was concerned. 2. Prom Colonel Powle’s despatch of the 9th March, on P.Z.1657/33, it will be seen that Airways, without consultation with the political authorities or with the Sheikh, |jSubsequently opened a public wireless station at Shargah, and notified that messages might be transmitted through it both in Shargah and in Dibai, with the result that a formal protest was received from the Sheikh. On the matter being taken up with the Air Ministry here it appeared that there had been considerable correspondence on the matter between the Civil Aviation Branch of the Air Ministry and Airways, who had j represented that the opening of the station was at the | request of the local Sheikh. If this is in fact correct it was no doubt based on some quite casual and polite remark by the Sheikh to which definite effect was not intended to be given. The incident has resulted in a general overhaul of the question of air procedure in regard to stations on the Arab Air Route, the outcome of which will be submitted for consideration separately in a few days. 3. Advantage has been taken of Colonel Fowled presence here to go into the Shargah incident, with the result shown in my d.o. letter to Flight Lieutenant Duncan of the Air Ministry of the 20th April, No .P. Z.2266/33. The provisional conclusions of that letter were confirmed at an inter-/E.&amp; 0. 3305 1933. inter-departmental meeting at the Air Ministry, attended by the Foreign Office and Colonel Fowle, on 25th April, and we are now in a position to issue instructions to the Resident. A draft is attached. i 4. In connection with Shargah, reference may be made to the Political Resident 1 s despatch of 5th April, on P.Z.2515/ 33, reporting the beach pyjama incident. The correspondence speaks for itself. It is obviously quite undesirable that European ladies should wander about Shargah in beach pyjamas and it is to be hoped that the Resident’s letter to the Sheikh of 30th March and his representations to Imperial Airways will secure that passengers shall not be allowed to enter the town. This is incidentally desirable from quite another point of view, for it will help us to keep a check on the activities of concession hunters, etc. We have just heard that the Iraq Petroleum Company have applied for visasfbr the Trucial Coast for a representative and, while these have been refused, communication between passing passengers and the Sheikh such as appears to have been taking place since the opening of the air station would obviously make it much more difficult for us to exercise the control which we desire. J.G. LAITHWAITE. fl.5.33. Secretary, E.&amp; 0. Dept., For any observations. J.G. LAITHWAITE. 8.5.33. Political Secretary, I have suggested an addition to the draft to emphasise the similarity between this case and that of the W/T station at Gwadur, the registration of which was undertaken by the/the Government of India. As in that case, the Government of India will require precise details of the station in the form Flag P. flagged at E.&amp; 0.2328/32 in the separate file helow. These should he obtained from the Air Ministry and I have accordingly made a further addition to the draft promising that they are being procured and will be forwarded as soon as possible. I presume you will take the necessary steps to this end. W.R.ft- A. DIBDIN. 8.5.33* The additions suggested by the E.&amp; 0. Department have been incorporated in the draft; and a letter has been sent to Flight Lieutenant Duncan enclosing the form referred to and asking that it may be completed. J.G. LAITHWAITE. 8.5.33.P.Z.2515/33. Air 'lail. 19th May, 1933. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to the Government of India’s express letter,No.D.1131-M/33, of 24th March and connected correspondence on the subject of the action of Imperial Airways in opening a public wireless telegraphy station at Shargah, which was reported in Bushire letter of 9th March 1933, No.C.65. 2. Enquiry of the Air Ministry showed that the action in question had been taken under the apparently erroneous impression that it was in response to the wishes of the Sheikh. Advantage has been taken of Colonel Fowls’s recent visit to this country to discuss the whole question in detail. The results of the discussion in question are embodied in the demi-official letter from the India Office to the Air Ministry, No.P.Z.2266/33, dated 20th April, of which a copy is now enclosed, the provisional conclusions recorded in which were subsequently confirmed at an interdepartmental meeting attended by Colonel Fowle. 3. I am to ask that, if no objection is seen, the Resident may now be instructed to take steps to give effect to the conclusions in question. On a minor but important point, I am to say that it will, of course, be necessary that the public station at Shargah should be notified to the International Bureau of the Telegraph Union at Berne. The Secretary of State recognises that it is perhaps slightly The Foreign Secretary to the anomalous/ Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.anomalous that steps for such notification should be taken through the Government of India. On the other hand, the undesirability on political grounc.s of permitting u_ie adhesion of the Rulers of the Persian aulf ^o interna/tional conventions or of allowing them to comumcate direct v/itn foreign powers or international bodies is generally accepted. A notification cannot be made by Imperic.l Airways and in all the circumstances the most satisfactory course appears to be that it should be made through the Government of India, as in the similar case of the Gwadur wireless station (see correspondence ending with the letter from the Industries and Labour Department of 26th May,1932, No.W.l). The Secretary of State trusts that having regard to the special circumstances they will see no objection to takingfche necessary steps. In anticipation of their concurrence he is taking steps to obtain from tne Air Ministry, for transmission to them as soon as possible, precise details of the entries to be made under the various columns in the International List of Fixed and Land Stations and he will be glad to receive a copy of any communication addressed by the Government of India on the subject to the International Bureau. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) J. C. WALTON.V India Office, London,S.W,1. P.Z.2266/33. 201h Apri1,1933. Dear Duncan, I v/rite to put on record that the position in regard to the Shargah wireless station was informally discussed on the 19th April at a meeting at the India Office at which the Political Resident and representatives of the Foreign Office were present and which you kindly attended. Provisional conclusions ?/ere reached as to the best methods of dealing with this problem and it was agreed that I should put them on record in a letter to you and that they should be brought up for consideration at the Air Route meeting which has been fixed for Wednesday, 26th April,in Shelmerdine's room. 2* It was agreed in the first place, in the light of the information which you gave us, that the proposal that this question should be referred to the Imperial Communications Committee should be let drop and that no difficulty need arise in securing its expeditious disposal in the ordinary way. 3* As was made clear at the meeting at Gwydyr House on the 3rd April, the India Office see no objection to the maintenance of a public wireless station at Shargah (and, indeed, some possible advantage) so long as it is placed || on a regular basis and the Sheikh’s consent obtained. On general grounds we are, however, definitely inclined to think that there is much to be said for the concentration Flight Lieutenant W.A.Duncan, Air Ministry. n f/ Adastral House, Kingsway,W.C.2.of responsibility for public wireless arrangements in the G-ulf under Imperial &amp; International Communications and if possible we should have preferred that responsibility for the Shargah station should be taken over by them. I understand from you, however, that this could not be done save at the cost of a subsidy which the Air Ministry are naturally very reluctant to have to pay and further that, while it may be anomalous that Imperial Airways should be responsible for running a private station, there is no objection of principle to their doing so if special circumstances seem to make this desirable. 4. After discussion the general sense of the meeting was that it was desirable to retain a public station at Shargah, subject to the Sheikh’s consent being obtained and to the necessary steps being taken(through the Government of India) to notify its existence to Berne; that in principle there seems to be strong arguments in favour of the concentration under Imperial &amp; International Communications of wireless arrangements in the G-ulf, but that in the circumstances described above it would be best that at any rate for the present responsibility for operating the Shargah station should rest with Imperial Airways, the question of the transfer of responsibility to the Communications Company being reserved for consideration if at some future date receipts became sufficiently substantial to make it possible for the Communications Company to take over the station without the assistance of a Government subsidy; and finally, that while Airways, in these circumstances, should operate the station, it would be desirable that the concession to be granted by the Sheikh for its maintenance should be granted to His Majesty’s Government, Airways being appointed by His Majesty's Government as their Agent. If thi s/this view is accepted by next Tuesday’s meeting we will write to the Government of India as regards the notification of the station to Berne and will also arrange for the despatch of the necessary instructions to the Gulf as to the reply to be made to the Sheikh of Shargah’s protest and the concession to be obtained from him for the retention of a public station. 5. On a connected point you were good enough to say that you would make enquiries of Imperial Airways as to the position in regard to the acceptance of public traffic at the Gwadur wireless station. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner, Bertram and Blaxter. Yours sincerely, (Sd .)J.G.Laithwaite.Arising out of the recent meeting held by D.C.A, at which W/T facilities in the Persian Gulf were discussed, I enclose a letter from Messrs,Imperial Airways referring to the possibility of the use of Gwadar for the trans mission of commercial messages. We are anxious to know the official attitude of the Indian Government on this question, and,particularly, would like to have a precise statement of the annual income whibh would accrue to Gwadar, It was agreed at the meeting that the operation of a commercial wireless station by Imperial Airways was a bad precedent, and we should be glad to know whether the Indian Government could be induced to take over the station. This solution would suit the Air Ministry best. I am informed that the Dutch and French lines may wish to communicate with Gwadar, which would provide an additional revenue. As an alternative-, the Imperial &amp; International Communications company could be approached, if the financial situation were sufficiently attractive. Possibly the Indian Government would agree to the payment of a small subsidy,^ if the existence of a commercial station at Gwadar enabled tnem to effect a saving in other directions. Unless such a subsidy could be granted, I am rather doubtful ?fhether the value of the present commercial traffic plus an Air Ministry subsidy for the provision of a free service for Imperial Airways would be high enough to tempt the Imperial &amp; International Communications Co, Yours sincerely.(COPY) IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED AIRWAY TERMINUS Victoria Station (Continental Departures) London, S,W.l. 9206/AF/VAS. 31st December 193&amp; ^ear Warrin^ton-Morris, We have been approached by the Officer in Charge of Wireless Services, on behalf of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, India, with a request to accept the responsibility of transmitting and receiving all commercial telegrams by W/T at GWADAR, consequent on the India Government abandoning the land line between Gwadar and Karachi. We are informed that the traffic is assessed at about 10,000 messages a year, or approximately 30 a day - 15 each wqy # If we accept the responsibility, it will necessitate the employment of an additional operator, for whose services the India Government must bear the cost* Owing to the cheap rate at which these messages are carried, i.e. one anna per word, the income at Gwadar at the rate of 15 messages transmitted a day would be at the most about £360 per annum* This sum would barely pay an operator at such a place, and would allow nothing for maintenance and running of plant. You will understand, of course, that we have only been approached tentatively, but it would be well to find out how you would view it. It is assumed that no payment would be expected by the Air Ministry, as the revenue from the working of the service will not cover expenses, at least so far as can be seen at present. As Mr. Edmund, the Officer in Charge of ’W/T Services, is leaving on Tuesday, I wonder if you would be good enough to ring me up and let me know what you think of it generally* Yours sincerely.

Dear Duncan, I write to put on record that the position in regai*d to the &amp;hai-gah wireless station was informally discussed on the 19th April at a meeting at the India Office at which the Political Resident and representatives of the Foreign Office were present and which you kindly attended. Provisional conclusions were reached as to the 'best methods of dealing with this problem and it was agreed that I should put them on record in a letter to you and that they should be brought up for consideration at the Air Route meeting which has been iixed for Wednesday, 26th April, in Shelmerdine’s room. 2. It was agreed in the first place, in the light of the information which you gave us, that the proposal that this .questibn.- .should be referred to the Imperial Communications Committee should be let drop and that no difficulty need arise in securing its expeditious disposal in the ordinary way. 3. As was made clear at the meeting at Gwydyr House on the 3rd April, the India Office see no objection to the maintenance/ ht Lieutenant W.A. Duncan, r Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.

On general grounds we are, however, definitely inclined to think that there is much to 'be said for the concentration of responsibility for public wireless arrangements in the Gulf under Imperial &amp; International Communications and if possible we should have preferred that responsibility for the Shargah station should be taken over by them. I understand from you, however, that this could not oe done save at the cost of a subsidy which the Air Ministry are naturally very reluctant to have to pay and further that, while it may be anomalous that Imperial Airways should be responsible for running a private station, there is no objection of principle to their doing so if special circumstances seem to make this desirable. 4. After discussion the general sense of the meeting was that it was desirable to r etain a public station at Shargah, subject to the Sheikh’s consent oeing jKibtained and to the necessary steps being taken (through the .a Government of India) to notify its existence to Berne; that in principle there seemed to be strong arguments in favour of the concentration under Imperial &amp; International Communications/Coramunications of wireless arrangemente in the Gul-f, but that in the circumstances described above it would be best^ any rate for the present responsibility for operating the Shargah station should rest with Imperial Airways, the question of the transfer of responsibility to the Communications Company being reserved for consideration if at some future date receipts became sufficiently substantial to make it possible for the Communications Company to take over the station without the assistance of a Government subsidy; and finally, that while Airways, in these circumstances, should operate the station, it would be desirable that the concession to be granted by the bheikh tor its maintenance should be granted to His Majesty’s Government, Airways being appointed by His Majesty’s Government as their Agent. If this view is accepted by next Tuesday’s meeting we will write to the Government of India as regards the notification of the station to Berne and will also arrange for the despatch of the necessary instructions to the Gulf as to the reply to be made to the Sheikh of Shargah’s protest and the concession to be obtained from him for the retention of a public station* On a connected point you were good enough to say that/ 5*i955 that you would make enquiries of Imperial Airways as to the position m regard to the acceptance of public traffic at the Gwadur wireless station# 6.

From Politioal* Bahrain &gt; To Besident, Bushire No•C/116 20th March 1933 I learn that it is 'becoming a practice for passengers of Imperial Airways at Sharjah to visit town and also going to see Shaikh. 2. I understand that on one occasion recently lady went into town in 'beach pyjamas. 3. Sub-paragraph 4 of the Agreement between Shaikh Sultan bin Sagar and the British Government lays down the Company may send their employees to reside in the w Best House, but neither they nor the passengers shall enter the town of ^harjah without my permission''. I presume that at the time the objection to 4 visitors was from the side of the Shaikh and it is possible that the question of whether it was desirable from our point of view for passengers to go into the town, was not concerned, though I understand that at one time there was a notice up forbidding than to enter the town. 5. Apparently, however, a number of people have called on the Shaikh and it seems that he regards these calls as a tribute to his own importance, so that he rather encourages them than otherwise. 6. It is olearly undesirable that passengers should wander about Sharjah, both from the point of view of incidents arising and of the Shaimh becoming spoilt. Ly records do not show whether Imperial Airways have any specificr specific orders regaraing visits of passengers and their employees to the town and I should he glad of instructions as to vrtiat course I should take. 7 . in the meantime I am addressing the enclosed letter to the Station Superintendent, Sharjah.

Colonel Loch, the Political Agent, Bahrain, has informeh me that passengers from the Imperial Airways aeroplanes landing at Mhargah make excursions into your town. I think this is unnecessary and undesirable, especially in the case of ladies, as you are aware the people of your town, though friendly to us, are not accustomed to strange Europeans wandering about in their bazaars, and if by any unfortunate chance one of the passengers was insulted or molested by some bad character or Bedouin from the desert, it would be a serious matterj and on© for which I would have to hold you, 0 Shaikh, entirely responsible, since, as you are aware, there is a clause in the agreement between you and the High Government on the subject of air facilities in your territory, to the effect that neither employees of the Imperial Airways Company nor passengers shall enter the town of Shargah without your peraission. 2. Supposing therefore that some unfortunate incident, as mentioned above, occurred 1 should have to ask you to punish the perpetrator very severely, and you would be put to trouble in the matter. Or supposing that the perpetrator could not be immediately discovered, it might be that I would have to ask you to pay compensa tion from your allowance,and you would be put to loss. 3 . You are a wise man, 0 Shaikh, and will not desiredesire to run these risks Tor no benefit to yourself. I suggest therefore that you inform the Manager, Imperial Airways, that no passengers will he allowed in your town for the present ana that you will mak® arrangements to prevent passengersfrom doing so# Later on, when your people have become accustomed to the coming and going of travellers, we oan oonsiaer the matter ag**n.

The accident was not the fault of the employe and the incident was satisfactorily closed at the time. In order, however, to minimise the risk of occurrence of such incidents 1 would be glad if the Company would instruct its local representatives in the Persian Gulf Section (including Gwadur) to keep in olose touch with the local Political Agent, or other British Authority, to give him, for the information of the local Baler, previous intimation of any new works or developments to be undertaken, and to consult him before * he (the representative) or any of the Company’s employees or passengers indulge in shooting, visiting the bazaar or desert, or taking any action generally which might bring them into contact with the local inhabitants* 2 . In this connection I have just received a communi cation from the Political Agent, Bahrain,that passengers at Shargah have begun going into the town, one lady passenger doing so clad in beach pyjamas. However suitabl&lt; the latter garb may be in its right place, that place is obviously not Shargah and I have written to the Shaikh pointing out that by a clause in the air facilities agreement no employee of the Company, or passenger, can enter the town without his permission, and that I advise himwmmmmmmam him - to avoid the ohance of any unpleasant incident happening - to make use of t»his clause ana forbid passengers to enter :3hargah* 1 have also asked the Political Agent to explain the circumstances to your Manager at Shargahf and to ask him to discourage passengers visiting the town. It must be remembered that the people of Shargah have not upto now been accustomed to having strangers» especially ladies&gt; wandering about their bazaars&gt; and it is of course most desirable from the point of view of the Company* as well as from my point of view, that any risk of passengers being molested should be avoided, 3.

Sir, With reference to Mr. Turner's letter No. E &amp; 0 6799/ 31 dated 441.51, T am directed to inform you that the Government of India have further considered this matter and feel that, if it is necessary to insert the wireless station at Gwadur in the International List, it would be more consistent if the notification r to the International Telegraph Bureau were made the British Post Office as the station is controlled by Imperial Airways, a company registered in the United Kingdom, and is neither controlled by the Government of India nor located in Indian Territory. The station is located in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat but the Government of India do not consider that it is necessary to obtain the consent of His Highness before notifying the station provided that the entry in the International List makes no mention of that authority in any way. 2. The Government of India however feel that the matter is of minor importance and have therefore no objection to notifying the station but they would prefer2 i &lt; n c w/ 2 O 2 ^ 1^52 1. to indicate that the station is not underftheir control and propose to insert in the last column the observation controlled by Messrs Imperial Airways Ltd, London'. As regards the Heading it is thought that 'Persian Gulf' would be most appropriate. 3.

The Council desire to point out that no other channel appears to exist for registering this station if, as they assume, the Sultan of iiuscat does not subscribe to the International Telegraph Convention, and Imperial Airways, who are operating the station, are thus precluded from initiating action that would in other circumstances be of a routine nature. 3. The Council are of opinion that as an aeronautical The Under Secretary of State, Economic and Overseas Department, India Office, S.W.l.station available for aircraft flying down the Persian Gulf Gwadar radio station should appear in the Berne List, to gether with those other stations on the Indianair route which \ are already registered in the volume of fixed and land stations, and take its status accordingly.
