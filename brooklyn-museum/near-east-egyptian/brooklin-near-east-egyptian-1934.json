Facial features idealized. Deep modelling around mouth. Ear well-articulated. Isis wears close fitting garment through which line of right hip and thigh are clearly modeled (though unfinished); sunk navel also worked. Garment reaches up to exposed breast with halter straps reaching shoulders at either side of broad collar necklace. She wears pairs of arm bands and bracelets of similar design - each indicated by double bands. Near (right) arm held straight; hand clenches ankh. Far (left) arm with slight bend at elbow and wrist; hand supports vertical w's-scepter. In upper right area of slab (above w's-scepter) reaching upper edge of relief is raised rectangular grid; 3 squares across by 10 squares down. Grid squares are indicated by lightly incised lines. Hole for suspension of slab centered near top between Isis throne and right horn of headdress. Worked details in vulture headdress, broad collar and decorated band at upper edge of garment. Workmanship of hand clenching w's scepter rather summary. Relief work apparently unfinished.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "6 3/4 x 3 5/16 x 9/16 in.
