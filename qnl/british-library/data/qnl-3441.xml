Stannus encloses a translation of a letter, received 2 April 1824, from Mirza Ali Ackbar, Agent at Shiraz, in which Stannus is informed that Hadjee Zooranb Khan was dissatisfied at having received such a small present. Also attached is Stannus's reply to the Shiraz Agent, dated 3 April 1824, in which Stannus regrets that the money and the articles were refused, but states that he considered the donation to be more than adequate for the occasion. In his letter to Newnham, Stannus expresses his suspicion that Mirza Ali Ackbar made his communication without any authority from Zooranb Khan; however, he also opines that Zooranb Khan has acted in a disrespectful manner by making this subject a matter of public complaint against the Resident. Stannus states that he has decided to take no further notice of the matter; he concludes by stating that, should he receive any explanation or apology from Zooranb Khan, he will overlook what has passed and deliver the articles to the messenger's agent in Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000036#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
