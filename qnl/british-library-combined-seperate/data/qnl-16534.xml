He also informs him that Bruce left in his charge a packet containing four vouchers, copies of which are enclosed and copied in the text of the letter. He explains that he is unable to ascertain which voucher corresponds to which debt item of the accounts; two of the debts have been outstanding for 18 and 15 years; and one of the debtors is currently in Calcutta. MacLeod requests permission from Government to write off these debts or that the former resident should provide further necessary information.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
