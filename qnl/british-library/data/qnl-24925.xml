I am directed to refer to the letter from the Government of Bombay in the Political Department, No. 5386, dated the 4th August 1911, regarding Turkish exactions on the north-east frontier of the Aden Protectorate. ° 2. On receipt of the despatch No. 5 (Secret), dated the 18th Pebruary 1910, from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, a copy of which accompanied the letter from the Government of India, Poreign Department No. 592 E.-B., dated the 15th March 1910, the Political Besident, Aden, was directed to take the first suitable opportunity of informing the Nakib of Mausatta and the Sheikhs of Jahan that Government do not claim their districts as part of the British Protectorate, and to make further enquiries regarding the alleged Turkish exactions in Nawa and Dthabiani and report the result to Government. Prom the copies of the correspondence which passed between the Government of Bombay and the Political Besident, Aden which accompanied Political Department letter No. 3113, dated the 9th May 1911, to the Government of India, it will be seen that the Political Besident, Aden, made the necessary communication to the Nakib of Mausatta and the Sheikhs of Jahan; that the Sheikh of Dthabiani was unable to produce any proof of money having been exacted from him by the Turks, and that the only- documentary proof furnished by the Sheikhs of Nawa shows that a sum of Bs. 811-14-0 had been irregularly collected by the Turkish authorities at Bada. In accordance with the instructions of the Government of India in Foreio&gt;n I Department letter No. 988 E.-B., dated the 27th May 1911, the Political Besident, Aden, was directed to address the Kaimakam of Bada with regard to the exactions from the Sheikhs of Nawa. In consequence of hostilities between the Turks and the Imam, the reference to the Turkish authorities at Bada was deferred temporarily, but in November 1911 the Political Besident, Aden, was instructed to make the necessary reference without delay. The Political Besident, Aden, now reports that he has addressed the Governor-General of Yemen on the subject on several occasions, but has received only evasive answers. He intimates that British influence is prejudiced by the indifference of the Turkish authorities in Yemen to the representations of the Political Besident, Aden, while he has received frequent reminders from the Sheikhs of Nawa who uphold their claim to compensation. In these circumstances it appears to the Governor in Council that it is not possible to settle the matter with the local Turkish officials, and I am to request that, in view of paragraph 4 of the despatch from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 5, dated the 18th Pebruary 1910, His Majesty’s Government may be moved to make the necessary representations at Constantinople with a view to an early settlement of the matter.

Bell, K.C.Y.O., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. ^ i^h reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No 2177 dated the 3rd April 1913, on the subject of the alleged intrigues of the Imam of Sana’a with the tribes in the Aden Protectorate, I have the honour to report that I have received letters from the Nakib of Mausatta, Shaikh Mohsin Askar, and from his son, reporting that about 30 Turkish and Imamic soldiers have entered Nawa and have been welcomed by one of the influential Shaikhs Muhammed Ali Mohsin Askar An Na’wi, while the other Shaikhs have fled away. Nawa is an appanage of Mausatta and is within our Protectorate. The Nakib says that in accordance with my advice he has taken no steps* against the interlopers and fears that, unless Government intervene, this encroachment will provoke bloodshed and become the genesis of feuds which will be damaging to the reputation of Government. Arabs are unnecessarily nervous, and I am watching events and counselling patience. It is said that the people of Juban, who are next to our border line and most anxious to come within our sphere, have resisted the Imam’s men and compelled them to withdraw. We may possibly hear the same story from Nawa very soon. But it is necessary to be on the look-out. The Imam’s agents seem to be* working in many directions and though it is difficult to get reliable informa tion, there seems some reason to believe that with the gradual weakenino* of the Turkish power, the aspirations of the Imam will rise in proportion. I have not yet received any reply from the Governor-General of Yemen to my letter No. 110 C., dated the 19th March 1913, of which a copy was sent to Govern ment. The matter might perhaps be reported for the information of His Majesty’s Government, though the Governor-General has been re-addressed by me again, and a remonstrance raised also in re this latter question of encroachment. No. 3288, dated the 30th May 1913. From—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 185 C., dated the 10th May 1913, regarding Turkish encroachments at Nawa. 2.

A copy of the first letter was submitted to Government with this office letter ISo. Ill C., dated the 20th March 1913, and that of the second » attached. 2. Government having once granted permission to address the Governor- General of Yemen re Nawa, it was con sidered unnecessary to re-apply for sanction to correspond on a similar matter and relative to the same tract. The ruling of the Secretary of State for India referred to by you has not been overlooked. 3. I have now received a reply from the Governor-General of Yemen to my letters, and I attach a copy of it (original and translation) for the informa tion of Government. It might he as well to await a further communication from the Governor- General of Yemen, though it is probable the same may be indefinitely delayed. 4. It will he seen that Mahmud Nadim repudiates the entry of soldiers into Nawal4, but this is a fact well authenticated from several and reliable sources. If the invasion here was not so complete as in Juban, it was solely because of the threatening attitude of the invaded. His allusion in the concluding words of his letter to the “Sublime Govern- purposely ambiguous. Nawa is certainly within the British sphere just as Juban is clearly Turkish, but this letter would ignore this point, and the Governor-General seems rather to suggest that Nawa is Turkish and his letter is an assurance to us that the Turks are well able to control the movements of the Imam and his men, whose interests and role in the Yemen, he would attempt to show, are quite distinct from those of the Turks. Letters, however, received from our Shaikhs, stipendiaries and news- writers prove that Turks and Imam are working hand in hand, but at the same time that the Turkish influence is arleady on the wane. 5. In short, the Governor-GeneraBs reply has not remedied matters at all. ^ Personally I do not recommend that his letters he answered. The soldiers that came to Nawa and to Juban have returned to X)amt. Juban, though Turkish, quickly expelled the invaders, while at Nawa only one promi nent Shaikh left to join the Imam and he has been vilified by the remaining Government Memorandum Xo. 5327, dated the 6th July 1912, read with their Xo. 3873, dated the Sth June 1911.3 Shaikhs and stigmatised a traitor. Thanks to the welcome extended by this traitorous Shaikh to the Imam, the latter has through his representatives written many minatory letters urging Nawa to enter into the Imam’s jurisdiction. 6. This Residency has often brought to notice the scant respect paid by Arabs both sides the border to the Boundary Line dividing British and Turkish interests. From time immemorial there has been a very close “ nexus ” twixt the tribes and this no arbitrary line can now obliterate. Turkish Shaikhs, for example, across the Suhehi border constantly corres pond with the Abdali Sultan and the same happens across the Haushabi- * Marked “A”. Turkish and the Amiri-Turkish borders. . , di -n i -r im true C0 Py of a l etter * recently received from a prominent Shaikh at A1 Jalila (Amiri) will serve as a good illustration of my contention that the Arabs have a commerce between themselves too well established to be easily amended. The Turks know of this system of direct communication, and it is their policy to encourage it and ignore this Residency. The Turks are a sensitive folk and have never at heart approved of our presence in the Yemen. They keep no Consul here, and no Turk ever calls on the Resident thouo-h Turks pass through Aden by the score. For this reason it is that I would urge Government to countenance in all matters the correspondence of this Residency with the Governor- General direct. In the old days of 1873, indeed and later, such a practice was in vogue. It will show the Turks that the local British authorities are in evidence, have come to stay, and do keep a vigilant eye on their particular sphere to safeguard the interests of British protected Arabs. It is quite another matter to let the Turks see that this Residency cannot deal with matters of dispute save through the British Ambassador* at Con stantinople. This would suit the Turks programme exactly and give occasion for perpetual and protracted intrigue. The appeal to Constantinople is of course the “ dernier ressort ” but our prestige will be upheld only if preliminary measures are first exhausted on the part of this Residency. I believe that Government will approve of this proposal so long as copies of all that passes between this Residency and Sana’a are duly forwarded to Government. 7. To sum up, I do not recommend that any further action on our part is called for at this stage. We will watch events and see that what further news will come from Nawa, possibly none for a long time, as the Turco-Idrisi-Imam affair is far from settled. If Nawa complains of further invasion, it will be good to grant them a stipend. I am unaware what urged us, while putting up Beda and Audali as stipendiaries, to leave alone Nawa and Bani Dthabyan. All are important, but while the two former are well within our sphere, the second pair are on the boundary, and yet a perusal of the JProces verbale of 1905 will convince Gov ernment that both these latter tracts are British. It is because Nawa is apparently no one’s child and unclassified, that intrigues can exist and these will continue unless we define our claims more clearly.

After compliments. —We inform your honour that only a week ago we have been honoured with your letter, dated 8th May 1913, because we have been touring in the districts on inspection duty. As regards the alleged claim of the Shaikhs of Kawa, we inform your honour that we have already referred the case to the Sublime Pcrte and are awaiting its reply. With reference to the allegation made by you to the effect that the soldiers of the Turks and the Imam have entered Nawa, no such thing has ever happened. It is simply a rumour circulated by designing persons who after their usual and well known style are bent on causing perturbation of mind. The Imam, moreover, has not, and cannot, depute his soldiers to places within the jurisdic tion of the Sublime Government. May you be preserved. Dated 10th Mars 329=Turkish month. “A” From— Muthanna Ali Asn Shaafi, To— Major H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We send you this letter from Jalila to-day the 25th Jumad Awal 1331 (2nd May 1913). The news of this part of the world is that a truce for ten years has been concluded between the Turks and the Imam. Beside this other terms have been concluded between them. We have known their ways and dealings and so we feel sure that a rupture will soon take place amongst them. We obey him (Imam) inasmuch as the Muhammadan laws are concerned and had referred to him a case of a land under dispute between us about which we had complained to you several times, but without getting any satisfaction from you. This time we referred it to the Court of Imam Yahia at Nadira for disposal according to the Shari’a. The case was accordingly tried by the Judges of the Imam and Turkish Government and their judgment passed against us. W e then made an appeal and proceeded personally to the Imam at Shahara where we remained for three months. But up to this time we did not get satisfactory reply either from the Imam or the Turkish Govern ment, because they have been busy in fighting the Idrisi who occupied three tracts claimed by the Imam. They are now conducting peace negotiations and almost all conditions have been settled with the exception of one which is regarding the abolition of the custom dues at Yemen which neither the Turks nor the Imam are willing to accept. Their affairs still lack finality. Oh friend, we have been oppressed as regards our claim. We did not get justice at the other end, because that we are the subject of a Eorei^n Government, that is the subject of the British Government and for this reason they entertain a very bad opinion of us.Your favourable reply to this letter as to what we should do is awaited We shall act according to your instructions. There is no one else except you to help us. We have undergone heavy expenses and request your honour to help and advise us as to our action here in the country of the Imam and Turks. We shall act according to your letter An early and favourable reply together with the assistance you may grant us as a favour from Government is requested. The reply may be sent with Dami Yahuda Saeed. May you be preserved. Dated 25th Jumad Awal 1331 (2nd May 1913). No. 3990, dated Bombay Castle, the 5tli July 1913 (Confidential). From—C. C.

In reply, I am to inform you that Government are unable to support your request that you should be granted general authority to correspond direct with the Governor-General of Yemen in the future. The orders in paragraph 3 of Political Department letter No. 3288, dated the 30th May 1913, should be strictly observed, and you should submit any letters you may propose to send to the Governor-General of Yemen for the previous approval of Government. 3. Government are not prepared to consider your proposal that the Shaikh of Nawa should be granted a stipend until you are in a position to submit definite recommendations on the subject with reasons sufficiently strong to justify a reference to the Government of India. 4. I am to add that, in the circumstances explained, Government agree with you that no reply need at present be sent to the letter, dated 10th March 1913, from the Governor-General of Yemen.

B„ dated the 27th Hay 1911, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of i. Letter frcm the Acting Political ^Resident, the Government of India, a copy of the correspondence noted in the margin which has passed between the Govern ment of Bombay and the Political Resi dent, Aden, on the subject of Turkish activity in Yemen with special reference to tribes within the Aden Protectorate. No. C.-409, dated the 30th September 1911. (Confidential.) From—Major H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to forward, herewith, copies of two letters from the Kazi of Behan and also a memorandum on letters recently received from the Syed Mahomed Taha of Jabal Jihaf, and to state that the Kazi of Behan receives monies from ns and from the Turks. The Sharif of Behan is our stipendiary. The Kazi wrote me the other day that he was to perform the “Hajj.” Instead of that he went to Sana’a where he was honourably treated. The Turks have always complained of the way in which by doles disbursed we have won over the Arabs to our cause, but of late their generous treatment of Arab Sheikhs and Imamic lieutenants, and their hospitality towards the warrior tribesmen of Bakil and Hashib prove that our methods have been imitated, and successfully. I do not know to which side of the line Marib (Saba) falls. The Commissioners of the late Boundary Commission mention an imaginary line running from Lakamat-ash-Shub (near Kataba) No. 45 E. “towardsthe desert,” but the cartography we have leaves much to be desired. Enough that Marib used often to see me in Dthala and has often visited us in Aden and received presents. This may (? not) be Turkish encroachment : it is certainly Turkish activity and should be watched more effectively than is now possible. Gov ernment will remember that recently an Englishman, e^-officer of the Suffolks —one Wav ell—who told me he had apostasised to Islam and had assumed the name of Haj Ali Wavell, was turned back from Sana’a to Hodeida for attempt ing surreptitiously to reach Marib. He was believed to be an English spy and his execution was proposed. The Pasha of Sana’a, Izzat Pasha, intervened and wired to Constantinople whence instructions were received for his deportation. Wavell told me he had been deputed by the Boyal Geographical Society of London to go to Marib. This instance and the Kazi’s letters lend colour to the belief that the Turks have an eye to Marib and are embarked on a policy of pacific penetration. 2. Before writing to the Turkish officials re interference with Nawa,* it would be as well for Government to * w iSi thia Beai ' ponder the facts now disclosed, and to take such action, as they deem befitting, at one time, instead of corresponding piecemeal, as facts are disclosed, with encroachments and acts of interference. Eurther, I am not so very sure of Turkish aims m re Nawa. The tribute the Turkish Kaimakam ot Rada is said to have exacted from Nawa took place two years ago and it does not reflect creditably on our diplomacy to recur to an old occurrence ; again the letters written recently by the Turkish officials to Nawa to aid them in arresting the progress of the Minting machine that was sent through our Protectorate to the Imam, ii objected to, will give occasion to the retort that its passage through onr sjihere of influence was an unfriendly act. This machine was smuggled through and when we came to know of it and wrote to 2160 P. D. A.our Protected Chief to return the caravan, our letter was too late and the machine had proceeded too far for recall. 3. If Government approve, I would suggest that it will he politically sounder to drop all reference to this affair, and only if we can properly charge the Turks with interference with a chief within our sphere Marib) to bring home this indictment, merely instancing “the affair of the machine as a further proof of their bias to interfere with those within our area. &lt; It would be time enough then to disclaim any part in the passage of the machine which was certainly a regrettable occurrence. 4. If Government will pardon reiteration of a matter which lies nearer home, I would again urge the necessity of co-operating with Sir Ahmed Eadthl the Abdali Sultan qua exchange of his I e Gras carbines for M. H.—a concession asked for by him and already conceded to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. The latter wishes to quash rebellious tribesmen in a quarter far removed from Turkish intrigue; while the former seeks to subdue Subehis whose habitat extends from' near Aden to the border, and whose wanton activity and our inactivity in quelling it has called for Turkish comment on the seeming indifference we display in matters that affect the trade routes leading, and in proximity to Aden, and our nonchalance shown in omitting to aid an ally so close, and so useful, to us as the Abdali Sultan. If we abstain from intervention, even by proxy, in affairs at our very doors, we are not to be expected to deal with matters so far removed from our ken as Nawa and Marib. This is a natural assumption. Our holding aloof from this quarter has been noted and will encourage the Turks to extend their influence, to our detriment, further afield. 5. Jabal Jihaf is another instance. The Amir is a mere cipher. Jabal Jihaf never belonged to him till we placed the hill within his control. We eliminated, however, so long as we w r ere there, its bias Turk wards. Our backs turned, however, the Zindani Chiefs who once w r ere Turkish stipendiaries, began to look towards the Turkish coffers, and our omission, ere we left, to rectify the Amir-Jihafi bad relations has opened the avenue to this clan who are now being addressed by a Turkish nominee from across the border. The Mikrabi Sheikh is nominally Amiri, but he seems to be coquetting with Bin INasir Mukbil. 6. I tell Government the facts as we see them^to-day. If the rapproche ment twixt Turks and Imam is true, the Turkish position to the south of Sana’a and eastward will be surely consolidated and we may anticipate still further recourse to intrigue and a bu\ ing over of the Sheikhs of our Protectorate who are far more likely to p mder to the Turk or the Imam near at hand than to an absentee Government in Aden. 7. l am putting up shortly the Abdali Saltan’s desire for a railway in his own limits. It is a purely commercial concern and will insure a financial turnover to this Chief. Anything done by our allies and Protected Chiefs will have also the effect of proving to the Turks that we are not blind to their w r elfare, and by that very act, are ourselves interested in areas within our supervision. 8. I, therefore, await Government’s declaration of policy before addressing tne Turks as already directed. Memorandum on letters recently received from the Syed of Jabal Jihaf, Mahomed Taha. \_My comments are contained within brackets^] The Syed who is a loyal friend to Government and in receipt of a monthly allowance as a news-writer, writes that owing to the rising powder of the lurks m the Yemen, the Arab Chiefs and Sheikhs on our side the border are taking a keen interest in trans-border politics ; that the Amir, himself, and a small taction (this Syed’s) on Jabal Jih?if are in favour of the Imam. [The Amir lias for years past been in correspondence with the Imam whose Viceroy is °w^e origin was, and once when I was in Dthala he showed me a letter Na gi&gt; the Zindani chieftain on Jabal Jihaf, the AM A l 11aq ba id, and the Shams were partisans of the Turks. [When we were8 “ the Shairi J ' sed 1° i ndeilt on the Turkish tribesmen ot Ahl Mures to help them against the Amir and I had induced the Kaimakam of Kataba on one occasion to recall these men. The Shairis, prior to our arriyal in JJthala, were egged on by the Turks at Kataba to pin-prick the Amir of i)thala, and a few of them were in receipt of Turkish doles]: that Sheikh , ... az { (the titular head of the Zinadina, the most influential clan on .Jabal Jihaf) had tried to enlist and take across the border to the Turkish Arab bin Nas.r Mukbil (of Ad Dareja fame) a body of mercenaries, but these men having refused to accompany him, he, Nagi, had gone alone to interview bm Nasir at Kataba : that m reply to Nasir’s invitation from Yarim, the Mdirabi Sheikh (so-called Amiri and within our border) was awaiting bin rsasn s return to Kataba before repairing there to see him. [This is not pleasant reading, but our removal from that sphere reveals our impotency to deal with matters of this kind.] Dated the 29th Sha'ban 1329= (24th August 1911). From— Sheikh Atik bin Ahmad, Kadthi of Behan, To—Brigadier-General J. A. Bell, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments.—W q have written |you in our enclosed letter about the recent news and events. Now we inform you that those who have not had the honour of making your friendship and such favours as Government bestow to the Arab Chiefs intend to proceed to Sana’a, now they see that the Zaidi forces and Mokadams have gone and placed themselves under the sway of the Turkish Government. They were tempted to do by the good treatment received from the General Commanding Officer at Sana’a the fixing of stipends and the liberality shown by him. We, however, dissuaded them as far as we could and practised diplomacy to prevent them from achieving their object, this we did for the sake of the friendship existing between you and us. We hope and anticipate that you will compensate us by continually treating us with friendliness and respect and that you will fix for us a regular stipend such as that fixed for the learned men and nobles who are of our standing and who are employed by you and other Islamic Government. You have not as yet provided us with a sufficient allowance for our maintenance while we are one of the eyes that watches things for your British Government. Now we refer this our request to you with the hope that you will let us know what you decide. We inform you that Sharif Abdurrahman bin Husen the Amir of Marib called on us and requested us to induce some of the Chiefs in our neighbourhood to accompany him to the Sublime Government—but we declined to assist him and sent him back disappointed. We at the same time pointed out to him that by the prayers given every Friday for His Majesty the Sultan we hope, as well as other Ulamas of Islam, to continue as recipients of respect and kindness. The usual taxation on merchandise exported from that part of Yeman has been remitted by the grace and benevolence of the Sultan and the nation. We write this for your information. We send you this by the hand of Sayed Atik bin Ahmad and Sheikh Saleh bin Abdulla bin Hadi with a request that you will treat them hospitably together with their 4 companions. Your reply is requested. Dated the 24th Sha'ban 1329 = (19th August 1911). From— Sheikh Atik bin Ahmad, Kadthi of Behan, T 0 —Brigadier-General J. A. Bell, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments . —Brior to this we intimated to you that we intend to go on pilgrimage to our Prophet Mohamed. May the blessing of God be on him and to pay a visit to the Sacred Mosque (Mecca). When we arrived at Al-Kibla (Northern country), we heard that Sayed Mohamed Edris and the tribes of Asir have besieged Abha with the Turks who were there. TheGovernor of Yeman, Mohamed Ali Pasha, had started with a large force to fioht him and that the Amir of Mecca, Sharif Husen, with 10,0 )0^ was coming from Hediaz to co-operate with him. When they arrived at Asn fight took place between them and the Edrisi. Both parties lost heavily, hut che victory was won by the Sublime Government and they have captured most of the cities of A sir. When we came to know about this confusion and fearing for our lives and wealth, we had to postpone our visit and turned back together n+w fr^vpllfirs who were in our company. When we entered Sana’s, we found there Ezat Pasha the Commander of the Army is in charge of the administration, and we were honoured by paying him a visit, on which occasion he received us with honour and kindness. We also found that all the leading men of Hashid, Bakil and almost all the Mukadums of the Imam-Al-Mutawakil and the noble Sayeds were admitted to his hospitality. All of these have surrendered their obedience and placed themselves under the Government. On the second day, Sharif Abdurrahman bin Husen and his uncle Sharif Mohamed Abdurrahman, the Amir of Marib, have come with other Sharifs of Saba and the leading men of the Obaida and the eldermen of Murad and placed themselves under the protection of the Sublime Government. The Amir of Marib was appointed as Mudir of Saba and a stipend of $ 60 per mensem was fixed for him. He was given a Turkish flag which he was enjoined to fly on every Eriday. [The Sharif of Behan once asked us for a flag. He is our stipendiary. We refused his request. The same request was made by the Haushabi Sultan (our Protectorate), but we refused him too, although he had originally been given a Union Jack by the British Commissioners. I am strongly in favour of granting such requests]. On the third day, we left that place after receiving liberal present from the Pasha and also a suit of dress of honour. We left Sana’a when the country and men were in the enjoyment of rest and peace. This is what was necessary to write to you. Moreover, we inform you that we have succeeded in coming across on our way with some of our enemies from the Al-Na’im tribe and their camels near the village of JVla’bar and we asked the Kayem Makam and the Sheikh of the place to arrest and imprison them and they have accordingly complied with our request. We imprisoned them and sent their camels to their relatives. They will remain in confinement until peace and safety are secured to the poor and helpless travellers along the road and their circumstances improved. We write this to inform you of our return to our country and about the suppression of the quarrels between the Government and the Zadi tribesmen. May you be preserved. P.

We on the other hand have constantly been forbidding them from doing so and intimidating them by mentioning the violence of the Imperial soldiers, but they are not fully restrained. Consequently, we wrote to the Commandant above referred to explaining to him the treacherous nature of the Arabs, their plots, transgressions and rebellions at the time when disaffection was rife against the Sublime Government, etc. He then wrote back to all the Arab Chiefs that they should stay at their places until he writes to us and them in future. Since the arrival of his communication they abandoned their inten tion and remained in their places. This was the result of the diplomatic and sagacious measures adopted by us. Now, we herewith forward his (General Officer Commanding’s) letter for your perusal with a request that you will return it to us after you have done so This is done in order to acquaint you of our endeavours to protect the limit against encroachment of the^ persons above alluded to and we write this in the hope of cultivating your friendship, kind regard, respect and benevolence. With reference to the Ashraf who have been fortunate enough to obtain your protection we inform you that Sharif Naser Ain Mohsin had gone to His Excellency the aforesaid Commandant accompanied by some of the sons ol his brother Ahmed Am Mohsin (the Chief of Behan) and most of the Ashrai oi Behan. When they arrived at that place (Sana’a) they presented to the Pasha a fabrication of their own which we do prefer not to bring to the notice ot ie British Government. This was stated in the presence of large assembly a non-Arabs and Arabs. They have subsequently been treated by the above Commandant with utmost genWty. An allowance of $40 per -ensem was assigned to Sharif Naser. This was so far as the Ashraf were conoerne ^ However, we shall before long write to His Excellency the Pasha such tbin 0 s as will create friction between both the parties. Sharif Naser came to us and informed us that the Subl:^ GOTernmen^ have collected numerous forces to fight the Italians that the fio-Mino- Imam and Edrisi are co-operating with the Sublime Government mjghting them (Italians). He presumes that the Arabs who s oo up liab-el-Mandab Sultan number some 150,000 strong.

They further asked us to go to Sana’a and persistently induced and even urged us to refrain from correspondence with you and befriending you. We answered that we have finally settled the treaty rela tions with Government and that if there was any ruling as to the dissolution of such a reciprocal agreement we shall have to obtain the consent of the tribesmen.

They are up to date in the city of Sana’a. We further inform you that on the imme diate departure of the aforesaid Sharifs, there came to Behan Sheikh Abdalla bin Farid bin Nasir al Aulaki with an allegation that he was deputed by his brother Sheikh Mohsin bin Farid to warn the Sharifs from proceeding to the aforesaid quarter but he was a day after the fair. He has however endeavoured ^o warn the remaining party against all actions unpalatable to the wishes of the Great Government. We hope that the country and its people will take a better course.

As regards Dthabianis, a sum of $100 has been spent for the entertainment of (Turkish) soldiers. This is what we have to inform you about. With best compliments.

In connection with the amounts exacted by the Turks from Nawa and Dtha~ biani we have written much and spoken repeatedly to the former officers of Government and have done so to you and our friend General Bell, Political Resi dent at Aden. You had enjoined us to get proofs from Turkish Arabs and we had formerly sent you such proofs. Accordingly, we sent you through Haitham Husen the evidence of Shaikhs Ali Abdul Karim and Dthaifallah bin Ahmad-Al Ahi, who is the Shaikh of Hajjaj. Now we send you the evidence of Sheikh Ali Muthanna, Ali Saleh Al-Hadi, and Shaikh Said Kasim Al-Hadi, and Shaikhs of Mures. We also enclose a letter from Shaikh Muhammad Ali Mohsin An-Nawi and the Akils of N awa to your address as you directed. It is against the policy of Government that Ahl-Nawa should address Government directly. The policy adopted is that the ruling Chiefs should solely and personally address Government. As Nawa is one of our sub-tribes, we hope that Government will not change the rule, shall not cor respond with our dependents nor accept their independent correspondence. We further s 3 nd you a letter from the Akils of Nawa to our address for your perusal. We have obtained all the proofs from Turkish Arabs from the neighbouring places and send hem on to you. But, oh friend, the will of the ruLr preponderates the multiplicity of witnesses. Government are merciful, kind and are just towards their friends, and their ability is the greatest guide. Through your energy we shall get our requirements. Do not think that we are greedy for it, but we shall, with it, perpetuate (? propitiate) the Ahl-Nawa and the Mausatta after the recent fight and deaths. We shall do so secretly. We desire you to let us know. Reply is solicited through the messenger Hasen Ali, who is the bearer of this letter. Please entertain and show respect to the messenger.

A. C. We inform your honour that Nawa is part and parcel of Mausatta and the A1 An-Nakib are the fathers of the Nawis. Nawa is on the border of the Turks who continue to frequent Juban and to wrong us;.long with them. We are not saved of the Turkish oppression. Oh, complainant before whom you would cry ? In the hope of securing ourselves against the Turkish oppression we were much pleased with the friendly relations entered into by Sh ikh A1 Mohsin Askar with the British Gov ernment by which relations the Mausatta and its environments and Nawa had been placed on the British side of the border. But the Turks have not stopped their interruption with us. We are not, oh friend, claiming whatever has been exacted from us before the consummation of the freindship with Sh ikh Ali Mohsin Askar, but we claim the amount extorted after the consummation of such a friendship with you. The Government official, Saleh bin Saleh At-Tairi who is the Kaim Makam and Pasha, was officering the same. The amount exacted, after the friendship was made, was $ 1,100 and 160 kadahs of grain. Total $ 1,420. We request you to let us know with the same as far as possible. The amount may be paid to Sh .ikh Ali Mohsin if Government are just. The said Shaikh is the Mausatta’s and our true representative. i Dated 8th Ramadthan 1328 (12th September 1910). From —Shmkh Mahomed bin Ali Mohsin and other Akils, of Nawa, To— Shaikh Ali bin Mohsin Askar Ali. A. C. We send you this letter from Nawa where there is nothing particular to report except that the rifle cracks between Ahl Juban and ourselves. But God will settle the matter. The Turks are strongly positioned and their posts are supplied with picket. We have received your letter and have noted its contents. You mention that you have discussed the matter with Government and that they have asked you for the details of the Turkish exactions from us. We have previously sent you the evidence of Turkish Arabs and this is an additional one. As to the truth of the case all the Turkish Arabs know the same. As we are your tribesmen and you are our liege, we have repeatedly harped on this matter. We are part and parcel of Mausatta and are your kith and kin. The Turks have done wrong and caused us and our country hardship. They also mulcted heavy sums in former years. Before you befriended the British Government, they had taken large sums of money, but we did not then worry you. In the hope of being saved from the incursions of the Turks and oppressions, we were much pleased with the achievement of your friendship with Government and with the demarcation of the boundary existirg between the two Governments. They (Turks) have not put a stop to such a matter nor have they done away with their violence. But on the contrary, they came in the month of Rajab 1325 to the district where they frightened us and terrified our children. We cannot fight them. The Turks are a mighty Govern ment. The officer is Kaim Makam Sh .ikh Saleh bin Saleh At-Tairi. We had written you before to refer this matter to the Resident at Aden, but w e have not been informed of the result as yet. At that time you were busy in connection v ith the murder of Uaidara bin Mahomed and Manassar bin Alawi and weie on your way Aden-wards. Wb now write you this letter to ask you if ^ou are espousing our cause and are mindful of your borders. If such be the case, we desire you to recover for us whatever has been exacted by the Turks, $ 1,100 and 160 la- duhs of grain at the rate of $2 per Jeddah. The cost of the grain is, therefore, $ 320 tThe grand total of the cost of grain and the exactions is $1,420. We shall thank you if you let us know of the same ; otherwise we request you by God to let us make our own arrangements. In order to assure Government we have written a letter to them and both Government and you enquire into the matter. As you are our sire, please make arrangements with the British Government. May you be preserved. . Dat d 6th Shawal 1328 (9th October 1910). From —Shaikh Ali Mohsin of Mam atta, To — Brigadiek-General J. A. Bell, Political Resident, Aden. A. G. We inform you that we have been in communication with all the British officers regarding the dues recovered by the Turks from Nawa, and latterly we represented the matter to you both orally and in writing. You suggested to us that we should produce proof and receipts for the amounts* The proofs were sent to you previously, and the receipts of the Turks which have been found are herewith forwarded by the hand of Shaikh Mohsin Musa. From this you will know that we deal sincerely and earnestly We hope that your honour will recover the amounts belonging to the Nawa and Dthabiani as stated in our letters. May you be preserved.

As we no longer countenance the advances made by Juban to come^ within our pr - tection, it is about time to refer this matter to Gonstantmople, so that any fu e tlnnbts as to our relative spheres in that quarter may be finally removed, and the S themselves be reassured in the flatter. Till this be settled the door to mtngue is being kept open and our prestige suffers. _ . .v j rv, dWM. 8 I would explain that this letter was delayed owing to the death of Shaikh All Mohsin Askar, who originally represented the matter of these exactions.

You ask us for a further proof in re the $100 recovered from our border of Dthabiani, so we sent you a letter received by us from Ahmed Mused and Ahmed Saleh of Hajjaj for your perusal. We have further asked Shaikh Umar Musa for any documents. In reply he said that he has no documents for the $100 as the amount was paid as an assistance towards their entertainment.

From ditto, dated 4tli February 1910. Lb As regards Juban, His Majesty’s Government consider it desirable, in view of the terms of the Proces-Verbal of the 20th April 1905, to make it clear to the tribesmen concerned that they do not claim the district as part of the British Protectorate. I request that the Resident at Aden may be instructed to take a suitable opportunity of informing the Nakib of Mausatta and the Sheikhs of Juban accordingly. 3. Nawa and Dthabiani stand on a different footing. But on the information at present available it is not considered practicable to make formal representations to the Porte in regard to the alleged Turkish exactions in these regions. I requesHthat the Resident at Aden may be instructed, in the first place, to make further inquiry into the facts reported. When he has fully satisfied himself as to the merits of the claims against the Turkish authorities, he should be authorised, if Your Excellency in Council thinks that the facts disclosed are such as to require that action, to address the Kaimakam of Rada with a view to the local settlement of the cases. 4. Should it prove impossible to settle the matter locally, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider further the question of making representations at Constantinople. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.i ENCLOSURES. Sir, Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 27th January 1910. With reference to the letter from this Office dated the 22nd November last, forwarding papers concerning complaints of Turkish exactions and aggressions received from local Sheikhs on the north-east frontier of the Aden Protectorate, I am directed to enclose copy of a letter' :;: ' from the Government of »N,v 1G9, dated 23rd December 1909, India on the subject . \ iscount Money is disposed to think that the communication made by the Resident at Aden to the Juban Sheikhs and the Nakib of Mausatta regarding the “ doubtful ” position of Juban, as reported in his letter of the 9th of October 1909, may give rise to misunderstanding, and that on some suitable occasion they should be informed that the British Authorities do not claim it as part of their protectorate. As regards the collection of $1,200 from Nawa, it is presumed that this is the collection made in April and July 1908, concerning which His Excellency the Governor-General telegraphed on the 3rd of May 1909 that both sides appeared to have committed aggressions. Of the other collection from the Dthabianis of $300, now reported, no details appear to have been given In these circumstances it appears to the Secretary of State for India that before any formal representation is made to the Porte the Resident should satisfy himself as to the merits of the case, and if the Government of India concur he might then invite the Kaimakam of Rada to make his observations. Should no local settlement be arrived at the case would then be in a position for reference to the Ottoman Porte. If the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs in these views, the Government of India will be addressed accordingly. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R. Ritchie.

In the course of the interview which was granted to them by the First Assistant Resident, the Juban Sheikhs asserted that Juhan was a part of Upper Yafa, that these districts have always been considered one, and that they do not want to be placed within the Turkish sphere. They complained that last year the Turks ^ collected 3,000 dollars from Juban, that previous to this the last collection was about eight years ago. They produced a document (copy attached) which the Sheikhs of Juban and Yafa had agreed to and signed about 76 years ago. It is to the effect that their countries are identical, their interests mutual, etc. The Nakib supports the Juban Sheikhs in their claim and states that he will never agree to a separation of their countries, i.e., one within Turkish and the other within British limits. I attach copies of letters which have been produced by the Juban Sheikhs purporting to emanate from Tairi Pasha, the Kaimakam of Bada. From these it will be seen that the Turks claim Juban, Nawa, and the Dthabiani countries. In this connection especial attention is invited to paragraph 12 of Mr. Fitzmaurice’s report of 30th April 1905 to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have informed the Juban Sheikhs and the the Nakib that the question of Juban has not been settled; that it is doubtful whether it is on the Turkish or British side of the border; and that the boundary in this direction has not been definitely demarcated. 2. As regards the 1,200 dollars which the Turks have collected from the people of Nawa, as reported in my letter No. C.-75, dated 27th March 1909, Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar asked if we had recovered the amount from the Turkish Government. He again pressed for its recovery. 3. The Dthabiani representative complained that 300 dollars had been collected last year from the Dthabianis by the Turks. He said ^ formed part of Mausatta or Upper Yafa. Dthabiani Praise be to God.

We have sent you a reply to your former letters. As to those received from you and An Nakib through Walad Laila, we at once sent you their replies by him. We do not expect anything from you less than troublesome references. You are aware that we have allowed matters to rest quietly, and, if you will come to us both, the Government and the tribesmen will be at ease and tran quillity. W e have already informed you that Government have sent a sufficient number of troops from Sanaa for the purpose of correcting and bringing all those who are not willing to accept peace to their senses. In a couple of days hence both the troops and cannons are coming. We are collecting all rations, etc., for them when they arrive. By God, there is no falsehood or lie in this. We have done all we could, with good faith and conscience, in the interest of everybody. You may not be like those who give up their good intentions after having laboured for long time. If it be true that Ahl Yafa are being collected with the object of going to Nawa, we prohibit and prevent you from doing anything or that any of you or the Yafais should make any encroachments. If they (Nawis) interfere with you, you should report the matter to us. All your former letters have been sent to the Governor (of Yemen). Should you now do anything contrary to what was already arranged, you will only spoil yourself with Government and be subjected to responsibility. If you will listen to our advice, act submissively to your Government and you will save yourself the trouble which may ensue by the arrival of soldiers. You should tell the Yafais that they should go back to their places and that you have no concern with them. You may eventually come with the Nakib and his companions to us as proposed in the letter of our Father Ahmed Fadthl. You may not come with a large force lest there should be fight with the Ahl Nawa. If you are still sticking to the understanding which existed between you and ourselves, you should not give the people any hope. If you find any of the people of Yafa in any of your limits, you must turn them out of it. You are aware that you are bound by the agreement and the documents which you have passed to Government to maintain the peace. All your former and subsequent letters are with the Governor. In the event of your acting contrary to the conditions in the papers referred to above, rest assured that the troops will positively come against you. You may come together with the Nakib and 10 Akils as soon as possible. We send you herewith a letter to the Nakib in addition to the former letter, which please convey to him. Salutation. (No date.)

You have now informed us that you have received a letter inviting you to go down. There is no need for you to go down. Shortly we shall go to Am Nahiya, where you and all the Sheikhs of Juban should come. Before the receipt of your letter we have sent a letter to Ahmed Fadthl. Do not be uneasy.

Greetings.% ins fop tie ( ^6 | ^ No. 7362, dated Bombay Castle, the 9th (received 13th) November 1909 (Secret). ^ ) From—-J. H. DuBotjlay, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 132-M., dated the 22nd October 1909,1 am directed to submit the views of the Government of Bombay in regard to the interference of the Turks with certain tribes inhabiting the north-east portion of the undemarcated frontier line which separates the British and Turkish spheres of influence in the Aden Hinterland. 2. His Excellency the Governor in Council considers that, however strong may he the understanding between the Juban and Yafa tribes, it is impossible, in the face of the express stipulation in the proces verbal of the 20th April 1905, by the Ottoman Commissioner, for the British Government to move on behalf of the Juban Sheikhs for the recovery of the $3,000 which had been levied from them by the Turks. 3. As regards the complaints made by the Sheikhs of Nawa and Dthabiani of illegal exactions levied from them by the Turks, I am to observe that it has been tacitly admitted by the Turks, as stated in paragraph 12 of Mr. Eitz Maurice’s letter, dated the 30th April 1905, that Nawa, Rubeaten and Dthabiani form part of the Yafa Canton. But it seems to His Excellency the Governor in Council that it would almost be better to forego all claims to influence over these \ tribes, than to maintain the claim without attempting to enforce it. If Govern ment make no effort either to protect them against Turkish aggression or to secure them compensation for Turkish extortion, our position in relation to them becomes anomalous and the Resident at Aden is placed in an extremely false position. 4. The Kaim Makam of Rada is himself responsible for these extortions, and to enter into negotiations with him on the subject would not only be futile, r but tantamount to a confession of impotence. The proper course is to make a representation through the regular diplomatic channels: and I am to express the hope of His Excellency the Governor in Council that the Secretary of State may be moved to cause a representation to be made to the Turkish Govern ment through His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople in order that some definite understanding may be arrived at in reference to these tribes. v 8.

The movements of the troops were on account of the refusal of accepting the terms of peace and non- compliance by some unwise people. No necessity to add to what we have already informed you. Herewith the reply to the Nakib which please send to him. All of you can come together, so that conversation and discussion may he made in the way that pleases the Almighty God and the Sublime Porte. We further inform you, Oh Sheikh Ali, that the document containing the terms of settlement is already with the Mushir (Governor of Yemen) together with all the other engagements. Abdul Nabi has just now come to us. We hope that each of us will act properly his part, and do that which is good. (No date.) From —Saleh BIN Saleh Al Tairi, Kaimakam of Rada, To— Sheikh Ali Abdul Karim (of Juban). After compliments .—We have received your letter and noted its contents. We have sent you a reply to your former letters. As to those received from you and An Nakib through Walad Laila, we at once sent you their replies by him. We do not expect anything from you less than troublesome references. You are aware that we have allowed matters to rest quietly, and if you will come to us both, the Government and the tribesmen will be at ease and tran quility. W’e have already informed you that Government have sent a sufficient number of troops from Sanaa for the purpose of correcting and bringing all those who are not willing to accept peace to their senses. In a couple of days hence both the troops and cannons are coming. We are collecting all rations, &amp;e., for them when they arrive. By God, there is no false or lie in this. We have done all we could, with good faith and conscience, in the interest of everybody. You may not be like those who give up their good intentions after having laboured for long time. If it be true that Ahl Yafa are being collected with the object of going to Nawa, we prohibit and prevent you from doing anything or that any of you or the Yafais should make any encroachments. If they (Nawis) interfere with you, you should report the matter to us. All your former letters have been sent to the Governor (of Yemen). Should you now do anything contrary to what was already arranged, you will only spoil yourself with Government and be subjected to responsibility. If you will listen to our advice, act submissively to your Government and you will save yourself the trouble which may ensue by the arrival of soldiers. You should tell the Yafais that they should go back to their places and that you have no concern with them. You may eventually come with the Nakib and his companions to us as proposed in the letter of our Father Ahmed Fadthl. You may not come with a large force lest there should be fight with the Ahl Nawa. If you are still sticking to the understanding which existed between you and ourselves, you should not give the people any hope. If you find any of the people of Yafa in any of your limits, you must turn them out of it. You are aware that you are bound by the agreement and the documents which you have passed to Government to maintain the peace. All your former and subsequent letters are with the Governor. In the event of your acting contrary to the conditions in the papers referred to above, rest assured that the troops will positively come against you. You may come together with the Nakib and 10 Akils as soon as possible. We send you herewith a letter to the Nakib in addition to the former letter which please convey to him. Salutation. (No date.)

With reference to correspondence ending v' _ ^ # with my telegram,! dated the 12th Sep tember last, regarding the difficulties caused by the action of Turkish officials in 1 154 F.D.the vicinity of Unbeaten, I have the honour to report that I have heard from a variety of sources that the Turks have recently exacted $ 1 200 from the people of Nawa as a tribute to the Triksh Government, and that, at the present moment, Nawa is occupied by 400 Turkish Arabs under the command of Sheikh Mahomed bin Said Ad Dahab, under the following circumstances. f , 2. In December last the people of Nawa murdered one of their Sheikhs, named Manaser bin Bubaker A1 Umari. The deceased is said to have been a protege of the Mausatta clan of Upper Yafa, and a relative of Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar of Mausatta. The relatives of the deceased Sheikh, having ask6dthe Mausatta clan for help to punish the offenders, Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar left last month for Nawa with 200 men. On entering Jubah he received a letter from Ad Dahab, who had already arrived at Nawa with 400 men, informing him that he had received orders from the Turkish Government to settle the Umari-Nawa dispute on the grounds that both these Arabs were Turkish subjects. I enclose copy of Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar’s letter forwarding the letter from Ad Dahab. I would now request that early steps may be taken with a view to the cessation of these invasions of Juban and Nawa, as otherwise our claim to these places will be weakened. I am iniorming Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar that I have referred the matter to Government. Dated Juban, the 4th Safar 1327 (24th February 1909). From— Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar of Mausatta, To— Major-General E. DeBraTh, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden. After comfliments ,—We entered Juban on Friday, the last day of Safar, with 200 fighting-men consisting of Akils and tribesmen from Mausatta. We came down to Juban two days after the arrival of Ad Dahab at Nawa. Im mediately on arrival there we received a letter from Sheikh M homed Said Ad Dahab, which we send you herewith for perusal. He mentions therein that he has been ordered by the Turkish Government to settle theAl Umari-Nawa dispute, and that both of these are Turkish Arabs. We are surprisedat this ? Nawa, oh friend, is part of Mausatta, and falls under the sway of the British Government in accordance wifk rules* observed by both Governments ! We . have already spoken to you at Aden and to all Government officers concerning the mount of dollars 1 200 which was exacted by the Turks from Nawa people in the month of Rajab 1326-(Ju!y and April 1908)^but we have received no reply from you on this subject. We have low addressed the Kaimn akam of Kataba to re move the Turkish Arabs from Nawa, and order Ad Dahab to clear out from Nawa, but no reply has as yet been received. We have written a letter to Sheikh Saleh bin Saleh At Tairi to refer the matter to Government, but we have received no reply. Ad Dahab is still at Nawa with 400 men. He interposed, received four hostages and put them in a jail. He entered Nawa diplomatically when they asked his protection after deliberately murdering our protege the Umari. We write this for your information. We have already written to you from Yafa; then from Shaib and this letter is from Juban. The ropes between us and the Turkish Arabs are taut. They are strongly prepared and have received orders from a regular Sultanate. We request you, therefore, to send us with promptness M.-H. and Le Gras ammunition and pig lead. Please sond the same as early as possible. In case of the breaking out of a fight between us and the Zaildis, we shall want nothing from you except assistance. If the Turkish Government, however, rise up then it is for a similar Government to rise. Please supply us with sulphur also.. We have also requested you for rifles. If they are at hand, please send them soon ; if not, Government should kindly make all possible arrangements for their supply. We shall no clear out from Juban unless they clear out from Nawa or we receive any intimation from you. Each of us is ready to fight. Full particulars will be given to you by our lad Haitham Husen. Our father, Sheikh Mohsin Askar, is at Shaib. As regards the assistance we asked you to send secretly to us as per letter sent to you with Ali bin Ahmed, please give it to Haitham Husen. Please also hand over our requirements and our allowance and correspondence fee to Haitham 2 It r * *3 (§) (j ~ Husen because we have incurred heavy expenses on account of this trouble, etc. We also request Government to be good enough to show respect to Haitham Husen.

After compliments ,—We have been informed that you have reached the city of Juban with whose people we have an agreement. All that which had taken ^ place between the Al Umari and Ahl Nawa, who are both Turkish subjects, cannot be recalled. We have received orders from the Governor to l emove and put a stop to troubles and disagreements, and to prevent bloodshed between the Moslems and our sole desire is this. We are not in discord with Ahl Yafa, but there is salt and bread and solemn convention between us and Ahl Yafa. If your de ire is to settle the dispute, please come with 10 Akils of Yafa and 10 Akils of Juban and we shall likewise c me with 20 men and all may assemble at Magel Mashuq or Al Kahir in the presence of Al Mudir and discuss on the matter; and so long as our intentions are pacific, all the affairs will be conducted in a satisfactory manner.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 2535, dated the 5th April 1900, I am directed to observe that the actual boundary between the British and Turkish districts to the north-east of Lakmat-ash-Shub has not been demarcated, but that it has been expressly stated by the Turkish Commissioner in the verb d,* dated the 20th April 1905, which was forwarded to the Government of India with • Mr. FitzMauricc’s letter,f dated the 30th idem, “ that provided the Uzle of Juban remains part of the Kaza of Rada, he recognizes that theUzles of Rubeaten, Nawa and Dabiani form part of the Canton of Yafa,” etc. Any claim to Nawa nnist„ in the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council, make reference to this document, and under the circumstances it would be inexpedient to include Juban ^ in any representation which His Majesty’s Government may make to the Porte* in regard to the encroachment of Turkish officials. Especial attention is drawn to paragraph 12 of Mr. FitzMaurice’s report J of 30th April 1905, on the completion of the demarcation of the Subaihi boundary addressed to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.( No. 8-M., dated Bombay Castle, the 26th April 1909.

In continuation of my letter No. 75-C., dated the 27th March 1909, regarding the incursion of Turkish Arabs into Nawa, consequent on the murder of one of the Sheikhs of Nawa by the people of the place, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter received from the Chief Sheikh of Juban on the same subject, and to request that necessary action, as already suggested, may be taken at an early date. Dated Juban, Safar 1327 (March 1909). From— Sheikh Ali Abdul Karim, the Chief Sheikh of Juban, and oil other Sheikhs, To— General E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Resident at Aden. Ajter compliments ,—We have already despatched to you a letter. Our behaviour towards Government is good. We are of opinion that Government will show us respect more than enough. Our country is part and parcel of Yafais’ limits. On account of our good conduct and favourable opinion we entertain for you we have accommodated Sheikh Ali Mr hsin and the Akils of Musatta in our dars, forts and other military guard posts, i.e., in the city of Juban. Please send replies to Sheikh Ali Mohsin and ourselves. Sheikh Mahomed Said Ad Dahab and his people are at Nawa. He says that he has been ordered by the Turks to declare that Nawa is within the Turkish side of the border. The act of filching the limits of the British Government has commenced. If no steps are taken there will be repentance. We hope to be rewarded by Government for our services. Our country and ourselves are part of MausHta. We are the Sheikhs of our country. We hope that you will not disappoint those who are anxious to win your friendship. You will not not admire us but after you have seen our country, because it appears by sight that it is part r of the Yafa district connected with Rubeaten and Boni Dthabyan. If the boundary is demarcated once and for all there will be no more mistake. We have received a letter, herewith enclosed]for perusal, from Saleh bin Salah At Tairi, the Chief Sheikh of Rada, in which he says that our country is within your side of the border. This has doubled our joy. We request you, therefore, to direct your eyes in this matter. Sheikh Ali Mohsin, the Akils of Mausatta and ourselves were about to wage war 4 •t ragainst Ad Dahab and Ahl Nawa, but we are unable to fight them since your Government are disposed to part with their limits. In the month of Rajab the Turks have recovered more than 2,000 dollars from Nawa. Our aversion to the Turks is due to their cupidity and oppression. We negotiate with you in order to secure a stipend. Our joint afiairs should be conducted through Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar. Please send us early replies to both our letters. Ah-Dahab is at Nawa and Sheikh Ali Mohsin, and the Akils of Mausatta are in our country. They have expended more then 2,000 dollars for the sake of your limits. Every one of them is prepared to fight. We also hear that Turkish troops are coming to Ad Dahab. We send you our son, Sheikh Husen Ali Abdul Karim. Dated 23rd Satar 1327 (15th March 1909). From— Mahomed (designation is unintelligible). To —Sheikh Ali Abdul Karim, of Juban. We have received your letter, and have noted its contents. Please arrange the peace terms completely. You shall be considered to have accomplished the desired wishes if you came to agreement with Sheikh Mahomed (Ad Dahab?), and you will probably receive reward from Government. He is an obliging man and is more faithful than others. The letter to your address and to all Bani Wais is with us. We shall discuss the matter when we meet together. If you are a wise man, please complete the settlement of affairs and don't act otherwise. G. M. Prese, Simla.—No. 154 F. D.—10-5-09.—50.—H. A W- 5Register No. &gt; ^ 1 V ’ iklD * Secret Department.

Unless the Bombay Government consider further action necessary, Government of India think it is only necessary to inform Resident that he should report at once any further movement on the part of Turks, but that for the present the reply of Sheikhs to the letters of Turkish local authorities would seem sufficient.

Secret, No. 20. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, Viewa of His Majesty s Govern- The appointment of a new Resident at Aden ment on the mam questions arising seems to be a proper occasion for laying before in connection with the tribes of the Your Excellency the views of His Majesty’s^Grovern &gt; Aden Protectorate. moot on the main questions arising in connection with the tribes of the Aden hinterland. The correspondence also addressed to the Grovernment of India by the Governor of Bombay in Council, which, by your instructions, His Excellency has forwarded to me under date 12th March 1906, appears to invite an immediate consideration of the principles that it would now he most politic to follow in that region. 2. It appears to he supposed by some that the process of delimitation, satisfactorily carried out in concert with the Turkish Governm-mt in the Aden hinterland and establishing a definite frontier between the territories of the Sultan and certain of the tribes, brought with it an extension of the responsibilities and obli gations of Great Britain. Lord Lansdowne, however, who Avas actively concerned in the transaction, explicitly rejected that construction of wdiat had taken place. In the B ouse of Lords on £0th March 1903, replying to a question whether the demarcation arranged Avith Turkey had enlarged the British sphere of influence, he said : “ With regard to the responsibility for these “ territories, I do not see why A\ r hat has taken place “ should make any difference in these responsi- “ hilities. We have never desired to interfere “ A\ r ith the internal and domestic affairs of the “ tribes. On the other hand, \xe haA^e throughout “ made it perfectly plain that avc should not “ tolerate the interference of any other Bovver Avith “ them.” In this interpretation His Majesty’s present adA r isers in the fullest sense concur. The security and strength of Aden as one of the main posts and fortresses that guard the line between England and India, must always be a standing object in national policy. That strength Avill obviously lie impaired and not augmented by quarrels AA r ith the tribes, by intervention in their disputes, by multiplication of formal agreements S. 13. Awith them, by locating troops at a &lt;lis ‘ a ““ fr ?“ the fortifications of Aden, or &gt;Y any readiness to resort to expeditions portion whether immediate or indirect, to eitne the occasions for them or to any clear advantage to he gained hy them. 3. If, as His Majesty’s Government have decided, the main purpose of the recent delimi tation is achieved hy the fixing ot a i - . which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, I submit to vour Excellency the following propo sitions as well fitted to carry out our decision. So far as the Turkish frontier is concerned, it is in the hi 'best desrree desirable that the importance of trespasses across the line, winch are neither serious nor deliberate, should not be exaggerated, and, should a protest he required, it would naturally be hy wav of action at Constantinople. 11 ® the territory of British India and within a limited area of tlie Protectorate similar to that formerly known on the Somali coast as the “ ten-mile limit, internal disturbances would call for interposition. But bevond that line our Agent should he c ^fel ul to avoid every step that might lead ns into military or political entanglements, without the express sanction of the Secretary of State. A railway to Dthali and a cantonment or sanatorium there, should he considered as outside the contemplation of the Government. This being so, the large body of troops now stationed at Dthali should he with drawn, leaving only a sufficient escort for the Officer so loim as he may remain there. 4 . The retention of a Political Officer at Dthali was originally provisional. In September my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India “ as a temporary measure, to retain a British officer and a small body of troops « at Dthali.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should be informed as to the existence of “any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthali.” In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. In view of the change of circumstances which will be the result of the present instructions, His Majesty’s Govern ment are satisfied that the arrangement need not be regarded as a permanent one, and that it will he sufficient if the Political Agent is permitted to visit Dthali temporarily and for special purposes as occasion may require. Por the present I leave it to your Excellency to decide when, after the retirement of the troops, the Political Officer and his escort should be withdrawn. 5 . The despatch of postal runners or agents of the British Government into the interior is to be as much as possible avoided. Any project for disarming the tribes in the nine cantons should be dismissed from serious consideration. Punitive expeditions for offences committed during theN Q demarcation, and not punished then and there, are now out of the question. No demonstration along; the frontier, whether demarcated or not, seems to he needed, and, without previous reference to me, no attempts should he made to conclude fresh treaties. 0. I trust that these propositions may commend themselves to your Excellency, as principles to he pressed upon the attention of the Government of Bombay, and as matter for instructions to the Besident whom your Excellency has appointed to Aden. Any other policy might drawt us into a re petition on another scene of the recent transactions in Somali Land.

With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 1995, dated 14th instant, in which I am requested to submit to the Bombay Government the report called for in paragraph 3 of the despatch No. 3 (Secret), dated the 1st Pebruary 1907, from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India on the subject of the collection of revenue by Turkish officials at A1 Doka, I have the honour to report that no further attempt has been made by the Mudir of 1 Mufalis to rebuild the post at Nobat el Mikrad and that so far as this particular f point is concerned, there is at present no necessity for further action. 2. Prom Mr. Pitzmaurice’s memorandum, it would not appear that valid objection can be taken to the collection of dues at Nobat Absi: but it would undoubtedly tend to the peace of the border and to the avoidance of further complications, if the Turkish authorities could be induced to adopt some other !&gt; . ** means of securing the allegiance of the Absi and the Kobati Sheikhs and to confine their customs operations to their own regular post at Mufalis. 3. Sheikh Abdul Kawi of Shaab has recently paid a visit to Aden and again complained of the attitude of the Nobat Absi officials which he describes as threatening and unfriendly, and ascribes to the general soreness still felt by the Turks at having to relinquish the Wadi Shaab. 4. He has further complained that a caravan carrying bee hives as usual within Turkish limits has been attacked and that two Shaabi camelmen named Saiyid Nasir and Salim al Tom have been taken prisoners by the Absi Sheikh and held to ransom. He states that one of these has just been released on payment of a ransom of 100 dollars, and that negociations are proceeding for the release of the other upon similar payment. But he complains bitterly of the incident, and ascribes it to the encomagement of the Turkish Mudir “ Hasan Sabri ”. He at the same time repudiates the idea that these captures are the legitimate outcome of certain civil proceedings which is, I understand, the contention of the Turkish Mudir. 5. In view of the present inaccessibility of the Subaihi country it is not possible to hold any satisfactory local enquiry into the truth of these “ ex parte ” complaints. But I would suggest that further representations might be made to the British Embassy at Constantinople with a view to the adoption of some measures to allay the friction which evidently still exists between the inhabitants of the Wadi Shaab and the Absi and Kobati tribes. 6. On the occasion of his recent visit, Sheikh Abdul Kawi, further com plained that a proclamation had recently been issued by the Mudir of Heifan to the effect that the whole of the Wadi Shaab was still in Turkish limits and that punishment would be inflicted upon all who made any statement to the contrary effect. 7. And generally it would appear that unless some forcible represent ations are made on the subject, one result of the recent demarcation of the frontier of this portion of the Anglo-Turkish boundary will be the continued persecution of the Shaabi Sheikh and his followers, and the serious interrup tion of one of their main occupations, which consists of the periodical collec tion of bees in the Absi and Kobati hills. 8. If desired, a copy of this communication will be forwarded to His Majesty’s Yice-Consul at Hodeida,. But though such procedure might have a more expeditious effect, I think it probable that another reference to Constant inople would be more efficacious.1907. ) SIMLA. FOEEIOHST EEP^-IiTMEHSTT.

Memorandum by Mr. Fitzmaurice respecting Turkish Encroachments in Wadi Sha’b. WITH reference to Eoreign Office despatch No. 507 of the 20th November, transmitting the India Office’s letter of the 15th November on the subject of the alleged collection by Turkish officials of certain dues at A1 Doka, in Subaihi territory, and authorizing representations to the Sublime Forte, it would appear from the correspondence that there has not been any actual collection of customs at A1 Doka (No. 123 on Boundary Commission map forwarded with their despatch of the 11th June, 1904). The dues would seem rather to have been collected at a small tower situated to the north-west of the hamlet Ad Doka and in the gorge of the nullah known as T\ adi Doka. Ihis spot is referred to in the official description of this part of the boundary (point 61 to 62) exchanged at Perim with the Turkish Commissioners, as follows: “ Erom Jabal Bakiza the border follows the line of peaks along the north western edge of Wadi Sha’b Valley, bending slightly to the south, where it crosses the Wadi Doka, so as to incluee a small tower, Nobat Absi, used by the Absi as a customs post, on the Turkish side and continues nearly in a south-western direction to Jabal Nabat.” The Turks would thus seem to have been within their rights in the matter of the collection of dues, but the Mudir of Mafalis apparently attempted to violate the boundary settlement by “ ordering the rebuilding of the dilapidated post about 1 mile or more distant from Rakaiza ” (i.e., at Nobat-al-Mikrad), as stated by Sheikh Abdul Kawi in his letter inclosed in the officiating Political Resident Aden’s letter of the 19th July, 1906, to the Political Secretary to the Government of Bombay. As the negotiations and final detailed settlement of the Subaihi border were conducted and arranged between the Turkish Second Commissioner and myself, it may not be out of place if I give a word of explanation as to the origin of, and the nature of, the settlement arrived at concerning the customs post north of Ad Doka, more especially as the latter spot and Ouja (lying immediately south of Mafalis in the W^adi Ma’den) are the only points on the Subaihi boundary of over 100 miles in extent which are likely to give rise to disputes between the Arabs and consequent questions between their respective Governments. About 1885-1886, or the date of the withdrawal of the Abdali Sultan’s posts from the Subaihi country, the Turks sent a force of over 2,000 men to collect taxes and strengthen their hitherto nominal hold over the Absi and Kubati tribes, as also ASIATIC TURKEY. [December 24.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [43071] No. 1. (No. 805.) Mr. G. Bai clay to Sir Edward Grey .— {Received December 24.) I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. the Wadi Sha’b. After prolonged hostilities the tribesmen submitted, but the Turks [2260 a a —2]consented to recognize the old tribal claim to levy customs or octroi dues on the local traffic between the Subaihi plains and the hills, and a post, or a semi-official customs house, was established on the south side of the adi Sha b, just under the col or pass known as Nijd-al-Mikrad,and mentioned in Sheikh Abdul Kawi’s letter above referred to. One of the principal items of the receipts at the Doka customs is derived from the tax of 1 dollar per camel levied on caravans transporting bee-hives. Bees are extensively cultivated in the Absi and Kubati Hills, and the bee-hives are conveyed on camel-back down into the Subaihi country before the monsoon rains in July, August, and September, after which they are sent back into the hills. The proceeds of the Doka customs or octroi dues went mainly to the Absi and Kubati head Sheikh, only a trifling proportion being paid to the Mafalis Customs, and their collection was agreed to by the Turks as an indirect way ot subsidizing and thus securing the allegiance of the Sheikhs in question. The Kijd-al-Mikrad post was subsequently abandoned and allowed to fall into disrepair, a small tower being built in the Wadi Doka to the north-west of the hamlet of Ad Doka, the “ Customs officials” consisting of three Arabs (two from the Athwari and one from the Subaihi, i.e., British tribes]. Before delimitation started the Turks appear to have brought the Doka post into closer connection with the Mafalis Customs with a view to exercising more direct control over the M adi Sha’b, and, being able to claim the customs there, as a regular Turkish Government building and post. When the Boundary Commission was engaged on that part of the frontier in March and April 1904, the heat was so excessive that the General in Aden found it necessary to insist on the withdrawal of the troops employed in the Subaihi country in connection with the Commission, while the necessity had been intimated to the latter of avoiding any reference to Constantinople likely to involve the procuring of an Imperial Irade with its attendant delays of at least two or three months. Under the circumstances the Commission felt bound to have recourse to the only style of argument likely to bring conviction to the Turkish Commissioners and Yemen authorities by blowing up with gun-cotton the Towers of Auja, situated within the territory claimed by the Turks and almost on the outskirt of the Turkish Commission camp. This action, coupled with subsequent British claims to the country stretching well-nigh up to the gates of Mocha, had the effect of inducing the Turks to surrender their pretentions to the Wadi Ma’den, the entire YVadi Sha’b and to a strip of territory to the south of the latter, but, as the customs post to the noith-west of Ad Doka was officially regarded as a Turkish Government administrative building, and the Turkish Commissioners could not consequently agree to its inclusion within British limits without the sanction of an Imperial Irade, the post, which was a small one resembling those existing on tribal borders within the Aden Protectorate, was allowed to stand and the boundary-line slightly deflected to the south, where it crosses Wadi Doka so as to leave Kobat Absi on the Turkish side. “ Noba ” in Arabic means a post, while the word “Absi” refers to the fact that the dues originally levied were collected on behalf of the Absi Sheikh. The name was consequently first applied to the old post at Nijd-al-Mikrad, on the south side of the Wadi Sha’b, and when the Absi post w r as transferred to the small tower subsequently built in the Wadi Doka the name went with it. This explains the cross-examination of Sheikh Abdul Kawi by the Mudir of Mafalis and the Kubati and Absi Sheikhs concerning the nomenclature of the place, as set forth in the third paragraph of Sheikh Abdul Kawi’s letter forwarded in the Aden Besident’s despatch of the 19th July to the Government of Bombay. The Mudir evidently had a Turkish translation of the description of the border, and w as endeavouring, with the aid of the Kubati and Absi Sheikhs, to prove that the “ Nobat Absi” mentioned in the official description of the border w r as at Nijd-al-Mikrad. His subsequent orders for rebuilding the tower at Nijd-al-Mikrad were apparently based on this misinterpretation and assumption. From the fifth paragraph of the same letter, as also from the Political Besident at Aden’s despatch of the 2nd September, 1906, it w r ould appear that Sheikh Abdul Kawd has been able to prevent the execution of the orders of the Mudir. The latter, too, has made no attempt to enforce his orders, which not impossibly w r ere the outcome of the soreness felt by the Turks at having to relinquish TVadi Sha’b. It is comparatively rich in cultivation and had been administered by them for many years. The Mudir’s language may then have been an idle threat meant to save his face vis-a-vis the Arabs. It may, however, be as well to lay the facts in waiting before the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and request him to w'arn the Mafalis local authorities to desist from any pretensions to Nijd-al-Mikrad.I may mention that Sheikh Abdul Kawi is a comparatively enlightened Arab, who has travelled much in India and resided at Hyderabad. He has also spent some time in Persia, speaks Persian, and is suspected of having leanings towards the Shiah heiesy. He is thus most obnoxious to the orthodox Sunni Turks, who imprisoned him on some fi ivolous pretext shortly before the arrival of the Boundary Commission on the Subaihi border. I procured his release, and found him most useful in collecting evidence in suppoit of Subaihi (i.e., British) claims, though I never confronted him with the luiks owing to their extreme aversion to him as a renegade. I may add that it is not impossible that the withdrawal from°the interior to Aden of Biitish and Indian tioops may be given out by the local Turks and Arabs as the result of “ orders from the Sultan of Bourn,” may be interpreted by them as a sign of weakness or tear, and may embolden them to make encroachments, especially in places like Wadi Sha’b and the Auja gorge, the surrender of which was distinctly sallimr to the Turks. J ^ &amp; (Signed) G. H. FITZMAURICE. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Pro-memorid in Turkish to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated December 4, 1306. (Translation.) ON the 12th June, 1322 (25th June, 1903), a pro-memorid was presented to your Excellency complaining of the action of the Customs officials of Mavia in transgressing the border of the Subaihi Canton, in Wadi Sha’b, and requesting that instructions be sent to prevent the recurrence of such conduct, which is calculated to lead to trouble between the tribes, and consequently between the two friendly Governments. Instruc tions in the desired sense were dispatched, but before their arrival it would appear, from information which has reached Plis Majesty’s Embassy, that the Mudir of the Mufalis Customs, accompanied by a force of the Imperial troops, visited the neigh bourhood of Ad Doka, in the Wadi Sha’b, and ordered the establishment of a customs post at a spot called Nijd-al-Mikrad, situated on the soutli si le of the Wadi Sha’b. Now, according to the settlement arrived at as the result of the delimitation of the border of the Nine Cantons, the entire Wadi Sha’b is included within the limits of the Subaihi Canton, and the conduct of the Mudir of Mufalis in attempting to establish a customs post at Nijd-al-Mikrad constitutes a violation of the boundary, which will lead to a conflict between the tribesmen. Such an incident must entail serious consequences and responsibility, and cannot, consequently, under any circum stances, be approved by the Imperial Government. The British Embassy therefore requests that immediate and stringent orders be sent by telegraph to the local authorities at Mufalis to refrain from such acts, which are a violation of the Boundary Agreement.Constr.n linople, \ \ 589 2?ccembor 2S, 190 , V 7 i Ho 825 &gt; Sir With reference to my Despatch h T o 805 of the 14th in stunt respecting Turkish encroachments in Wadi nha*b, X closed was duly presented to the Sublime Porte, and that on the t/19 December the Minister of the Interior telegra ph m to the Vali of Yemen, informing him of the complaint made by His Majesty’s Government, and instructing him to see that the Customs Authorities abstain from any action at variance with the decisions of the Aden Boundary Com mission.

The spot is referred to in the official f description of this part of the boundary ( Point LXI to ^ Point hXXI) exchanged at Perm with the Turkish Commis sioners, as follows: 'from Jahal Hakisa the border follows the line of peaks along the H.W,edgo of Wadi Bha’b valley, bending slightly to the South where It crosses the Wadi Boka, so as to include a small tower, Hobai Absi, used by the Absi as a Customs post, on the Turkish side and conti nues nearly in a S.W. direction to Jabal Nabat”. The Turks would thus seem to have been within their rights in the mtter of the collection of dues, but the Mudir of Hafalis apparently attempted to violate the boundary settlement by ’ordering the rebuilding of the dilapidated post about one mile or more distant from Hakaiza* (i.e. at Hobat al Kikr&amp;d) as stated by Sheikh Abdul Kawi in his letter inclosed in the officiating political Resident Aden's Ho. 4267 of July 19 1906 to the Political Secretary toto the Government of Bombay. A ® thc negotiations and final detailed cetilement of the Sub&amp;ihi border were conducted and arranged between the Turkish Second Commissioner and myself, it nay not be out of place if I give a word of explanation as to the origin of, and the nature of the settlement arrived at concernin''^ the Customs Post Berth of Ad Doha, more especially as the latter spot and Ouja (lying immediately South of Pafalis in the Wadi Ma’den) are the only points on the Subaihi boun dary of over one hundred miles in extent which are likely to give rice to disputes between the Arabs and consequent questions between their respective Gov rnments. i \ About 1885-1886, or the date of the withdrawal of the Abdali Sultan*s posts from the Subuihi country, the Turks sent a force of ov r 2,000 men to collect trixes and streng then their hitherto nominal hold over the Absi and mmMX Xubati tribes, as also the Wadi Bha’b* After prolonged hostilities the tribesmen submitted but the Turks consented to recognise the old tribal claim to levy customs or octroi dues on the local traffic between the Subaihi plains and thc hills, and a post, or semi-official Customs house t was established on the Couth side of the Wadi Bha*b just under the col or pass known as Hijd AX Mikrari and mentioned in Slicikh Abdul TC&amp;wi * o letter above referre to . One of the principal items of the receipts at the Boka Customs is de rived from the tax of one dollar per camel levied on cara van’s transporting bee-hives. 1'oes are extensively culti vated in the Abel and JCubati hills and t&gt;:c bee-hives are conveyed on camel-back down Into the S'ubail i country before thethe lion* on rainn in July, August and September after which they are sent back into the hills. The proceeds of the Doka Customs or Octroi dues went mainly to the Absi and Ku- ha:*i hear. Sheikh, only a triflin' proportion being paid to th© Hafalia Customs, and their collection was agreed to by the Turks as an indirect way of subsidisin'- and. thus secu ring the allegiance of the Sheikhs inquestion. The Tijd AX *tikrad post ^as subsequently abandoned and allowed to fall into din repair, a mail tower boinr built in the Wadi Doha to the Horth West of the hamlet of Ad 3Doka the 'Cuntoms Off5cials w consisting of three Arabs (t o from the Afchw&amp;ri and one from the fubaihi, l..s. British, tribes). Before delimitation started the Turks ap ear to have brau. }i? the Ufika post into closer connection with the Haf&amp;lis Cus toms with a Tiew to exercising more direct control or r the Wadi Bha’b and being able to claim the Customs there as a regular Turkish Oorornwont building and post. When the boundary Commission war: engaged On that j of the frontier in March and April 1904, the heat was so excessive that the General in Aden found it necessary to insist on the withdrawal of the troops employed in the Su- baihi country in connection with the Commission while the necessity had boon intimated to the latter of avoiding any reference to Constantinople likely to involve the securing of an Imper Ha Iradc with its attendant delays of at least two or three months. Under the circumstances the Comissio felt bound to have recours e to the only style of argument likely to bring conviction to the Turkish Commissioner® and Yemen Authorities by blowing up with gun-cotton the Towers of Aula situated within the territory claimed by the Turksand almost on the outakirt of the Turkish Con?nisoion Camp. Th&amp;a action coupled with subsequent British claims to the country stretching well nigh up to the gates of Mocha had the effect of inducing the Turks to surrender their pre- jl .. _ — A.

'' l •: -• o \ &gt;JU'0 i -' To j \ '[ok 1 The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., ms Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 11th October 1906. -t/'A y Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram of the 2nd Mhy 1906, we have the honour to forward herewith the correspond- ence detailed m the annexed schedule, relative to the collection of dues at A1 Doha on behalf of the Turkish Mudir of Mufalis. T i 2 ‘ 14 be Seen from the Resident’s report, dated the 11th July 1906, that taxes which are stated to be of the nature of transit dues are collected at A1 Doka by Turkish employes in accordance with a practice which has obtained during the last 15 or 16 years. From the evidence recorded by Colonel Wahab in March 1904, during the progress of the Boundary Commission, it appears that the post was established by some Turkish Arabs at Nobat Doka, above Shab, about the year 1885, after the withdrawal of the Sultan of Lahej from the Shab valley. The entire valley was stated originally to have formed part of the Subaihi possessions, and it was occupied by the Sultan of Lahej as such between the years 1881 and 1885. As a result, however, of the establishment of the post at Nobat Doka, the portion of the valley above Lukema was gradually brought under the indirect control of the Turkish authorities, and writing in March 1904, Colonel Wahab stated that, in his opinion, the British Government would be precluded on the basis of the status of 1901 from claiming the upper two-thirds of Wadi Shab as a Subaihi possession unless the Turks proved unreasonable about a fair settle ment. In June 1904, he nevertheless reported that the Turkish Commissioners had agreed _ that the whole of the Shab valley with its cultivation should be included within Subaihi limits, and he regarded this settlement as most satisfactory since any division of the Wadi Shab would not have provided a good border. The map which accompanied Colonel Wahab’s Secret letter No. 45, dated the 11th June 1904, clearly indicates the position of A1 Doka as on the British side of the boundary line. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the continued existence of the Customs post under Turkish auspices is an infringement of the terms of the Aden Boundary Settlement, and the infringement can hardly be considered as other than deliberate, since the claims of both parties to A1 Doka were parti cularly discussed at the time of the survey of the border and the decision which was arrived at was the result of most careful consideration by the Commis sioners on both sides. 3. This conclusion is confirmed by further reports which we have received from the Political Resident at Aden showing that the Turkish authorities encouraged presumably by our omission to demand the withdrawal of the A1 Doka post, have recently been taking active steps for the consolidation and extension of their influence in the Shab valley. *Early in April a partv of ^ Turkish and Arab soldiers appeared at Wadi Shab, announcing that they had come to collect the Customs dues. They are stated to have terrorised the inhabitants and to have done considerable damage to the cultivation. ^Shortlv afterwards the Mutasarif of Taiz addressed a circular order to the Sheikh of ro:the Skab valley, as well as to neighbouring Sheikhs under Turkish influence, demanding under pain of severe punishment the immediate transmission of the dues of the Turkish Government. The Mutasarif also announced his intention dues of me TurKisn uoyernmcuu. T™ Vi- . ; . of visiting the Shah valley.fin June 1906, the Mudir of Mufalis arrived in he Shah valley with an escort composed of Turkish troops and of Arabs from the neighbouring tribes on the Turkish side of the border. The Mudir demanded the’navmentof the Turkish dues and in order to stimulate compliance ordered the reconstruction of a ruined Customs post at a place within the southern limit of the Shah valley. He also threatened to incite the neighbouring Turkish tribes to attack and plunder the people of Shah if they continued recalcitrant. 4 The case has, therefore, assumed a more serious aspect possibly owing to our inaction, and we consider that the action taken by the local Turkish authorities constitutes open disregard of their obligations under the Boundary Settlement, and any failure on our part to insist upon the removal of the post at A1 Boka after the case has been decided in our favour can only tend to shake the belief of the tribes in our intention or ability to exclude lurkish influence from the area which has been recognised formally as subject to the Protectorate of Great Britain. If you concur in this opinion, we would again recommend either that a formal representation may be made to the Porte regarding the violation of the frontier, or that the President at Aden ma y h e instructed to address a protest on the subject to the Mutasarif of Taiz. We would advocate the adoption of the latter alternative in the fi^st place, as likely to lead to an early understanding between the local authorities with regard to the point at issue.

Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 5703, dated the 11th September last, and to my telegram of the 27th instant, concerning the presence of a Turkish Revenue officer at Mafalis, and the subsequent urnest amongst certain of the Subaihis who reside in that vicinity, I have the honour to report that, upon receipt of your letter No. 5703 in last September, the Abdali Sultan was addressed, with a view to verifying the complaint of Turkish encroachment upon Sha’abi lands, and of the wrongful collection of dues at the A1 Doka Customs House. 2. On the 23rd October a reply was received from the Abdali Sultan, a copy of which, and of its accompaniment, is attached, and it was not till the 8 th instant that any further communication was received from him on the subject. The Abdali Sultan then forwarded a letter which he had received from the Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Muhamed of Sha’ab of which, and of my reply to which, copies are also attached. 3. Upon the strength of this communication the Abdali Sultan took it upon himself to address a letter to Kayed Nohnan, an Arab subordinate of the Turkish Revenue Department at Mafalis, and he also wrote to the Akils of the Sha’abi country counselling patience. Copies of these letters, and of the Abdali Sultan’s letter, dated the 17th instant, are attached. 4 . On the 25th instant another letter was received from the Abdali Sultan, enclosing a letter received by him from Kayed No’man, and about the same time further letters were received from certain Sheikhs of the Jorabi, the Mansab of the Sanawi, and also Sheikh Shahir Un Sef of the Mansuri tribe, which tend to show that the arrival of the Turkish Revenue official at Mafalis has led to a certain amount of local excitement. I attach copies of the letters here referred to, and also of the replies issued to them yesterday. 5. A further letter has this morning been received from Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed of Sha’ab, from which it appears that, solar as Sha’ab is concerned, the excitement has, for the present, subsided. It will be observed from the attached copy that the Customs House at A1 Doka is still complained of. 6 . It may be hoped that the Mansuri Sheikh will, upon receipt of my last letter to him, also allay excitement over this affair amongst his own tribesmen, and that the Turkish officials will exercise sufficient discretion in the matter of the collection of their dues to avoid any serious complications.2 / &gt; 7. The Shujaifa sub-tribe, from whom the Turkish ofiBcial is anxious to collect revenue, reside partly on the Turkish side of the border, and partly in the Wadi Sha’ab, and at Shaban, in the Mansuri limits. The whole sub-tribe reallv recognise a simple petty Sheikh named Ahmed Moman who, at present, I am informed, is residing at Sha’ab, and upon the arrival of the Turkish Mudir at Mafalis it seems that certain of the Shujaifa have appealed to the Jurabi and the Mansuri Sheikhs to protect them against any undue exactions. 8 . I am informed that the number of Turkish troops in the vicinity is approximately 80 with two guns, but I am not in a position to vouch for the absolute accurac? of this statement. From the same source l am iniormed that, with the Jurabis and the Mansuri there are approximately 30J Arabs, and a few petty Sheikhs such as the Sheikh of Doka, etc. 9 . I tru^t that no friction will now arise, and I will report again on the subject of the Ai Doka Customs House when I receive more information concerning it. 10. The Abdali Sultan is a fairly convenient intermediary in the affair. And if I sent a Political Officer to the spot to hold an independent enquiry it would be necessary to furnish him with a fairly strong escort, both as a set-off, vis-a-vis the Turks, and as a sedative to local Subaihi excitement.

Oh ! father, we inform you that the Turkish troops are at Lahjar, in the company of Hasan Effendi, the Modir of Hifan. We received news from the Kobati and the Shujaifas, of threatening and alarming nature, to the effect that the Modir is swearing by the name of God that he shall not leave a stone upon a stone at Sha’ab undemolished. We asked about the reasons of this, and the offence which we have committed, and we have been told that Sheikh Abdul Kawi is speaking ill of the Turks, and condemning their acts, whereas he. on the other hand, speaks well of the British Government, their justice, clemency and good care they take of their subjects, and the protection they afford to those who place themselves under their protection, and he illustrates the Turks to the reverse of these qualifications. According to the story of the Kobatis and Shujaifas, the Modir intends to put Sha’ab to destruction, and plunder the population, and that lie states “ let the British Government be useful to Abdul Kawi and protect him.” Some people advise us to fly, and others tell us, to ward ourselves of this danger by inviting the Modir to our hospitality, and save our lives and children and property. We replied, we cannot give any decisive reply as we have an Akil. You may come to us immediately as we are much alarmed, and do not sleep, but keep awake and count the stars in the sky on account of this fearful news reported to us by the people.

We feel sure that these persons are alarming themselves unnecessarily, and that no such action as they write of, is likely to be committed by the officials of the Turkish Government, with which we are in friendly alliance, and in conjunction with whom we have only recently demarcated the boundary between their territories and those under our protection. Please advise Sheikh Abdul Kawi to warn his relations not to listen to idle tales told them by the Kobatis.In this connection, we would remind you oh friend that we wrote to you in August and October last about Sha’abi af!air&gt; and that m our !so. 629o, dated 17th October 1905 , we asked you to find for us, more m detail, what was reallr taking place at Al-Doka and the district of Sba ah. Will you please refer to that letter, and now be so good as to arrange, if possible, to secure us really trustworthy information m the matter. If von cannot arrange this, please let us know at once, and we will inform the Government, and suggest some other arrangement. Datfd the 22nd A1 Ki J da 1S23, i.t., 17th January 1906.

As to No’man Ahmed Asshujaifi, he has left Sha’ab, and the subjects of the Shujaifis are living with you at Mafalis, Sahar and Haijat A1 A^har. If you want to arrest them, you are able to do so, because they are in your limits.

After compliments .—We have received your letter—kind and honoured letter -in which you state that Sha ab and its inhabitants are within the Subaihi country, under the protection of the British Government, and was already surveyed and included in the Subaihi limit, and that we the Mokadums of the Sublime Government should be careful not to make any encroachment on the limit of Sha’ab. We understood the above to the last. Be it not hidden from you that we are now in our place “ Uzlat ” (district) Mafalis. Two days ago, our Sublime Government’s (may God preserve it for ever) Modir of the district arrived here; we have not heard him mentioning Sha’ab at all, but he intends to go after No’man Ahmed the Shujaifi and his people, who are the subjects of the Great Sultan. These people inhabit “ Uzlat Ash-Shujaifa ” above mentioned. He (Modir) intends to recover the dues of Government. The Subaihis are now concentrating on the frontier with the intention of unnecessarily creating disturbance. It is advisable that some sensible men should be present, so that the limit of Sha’ab and the Shujaifis may be distinguished before any disturbance takes place, as before. The Subaihis intend to prevent the Modir from interfering with the Shujaifis, whereas the Modir is determined not to return or leave the place without orders from his superior officers. This is a reply to your honour’s letter. May you be protected and overwhelmed with salams and blessings. From-SAYAD Ahmed bin Ahmed Saeed Al Hashmi and Sheikh Saeed Al Jurabi, l o— Major-General H.

We come to know that the Shujaifa are in communication with the Turks and that the Turks allege that they (Shujaifa) are their subjects, and intend* to exact dues from them, but they are not willing to pay the same. We further learn that Sheikh Saleh bin Ahmed the Mansuri went up to the border of the limit of the Shujaifa with his force, and also Saeed Al Jurahi is at the border, in the Husn (fortlet) of Mafalis, in the place called Al Mowkib, near Sukal Jcma a.

After compliments. —W'ehave, oh friend, received your letter, dated 22nd A1 KPda 1323 (17th January 1906) and its accompaniments, concerning the affairs of Sha’ab. Prom that we gather that recent rumours of Turkish encroachment there are really without foundation. Prom your further letter, dated the 28th A1 Ki’da 1323 (23rd January 1906), and'its accompaniments, we gather that the Turkish authorities only desire to collect certain revenues from their own Shajaifa subjects, and that this measure has somewhat alarmed the Shajaifa, who are under our protection, and other Subaihi tribes in the vicinity. It would be well, oh friend, if you would write to the Akils of these tribes, and tell them to disperse, and not to be alarmed. They have only to address us in the event of any dues being improperly claimed from them, and they can depend upon our, in due course, protecting their interests, and effecting any restitution that may be rightful. As to Kayid No’man, he will, of course, be well advised to counsel the Mudir of the Turkish Government, to exercise the greatest care to avoid any sort of infringement of the rights decided by the recent Boundary Commission. We thank you for the information you have sent us in this matter. We should further be interested to hear from you whether the Turkish officials are now actually collecting any cues at A1 Doka.

We understand that it is only his intention to collect certain rightful dues for that portion of the Shijaifa who reside within Turkish limits, and that he has no intention to demand dues from the Shajaifa, who by the recent Boundary Commission were decided to be within your limits under our protection. Any how, oh friend, there is no reason for you to be alarmed or to keep forces, etc., on near the border. In the event of any dues being wrongfully demanded or ever recovered from any of the Shujaifa under our protection, you have only to refer thematter to us, and we will see that their interests are protected, and that restitu- tion is made in due course if necessary. You should, therefore, oh friend, dismiss armed men to their homes, and mere y inform us of any wrongful claims which may be made. We do not think any will be made. It is most desirable that there should bo no sort of breach of the peace over the matter. r May you be preserved. No. 494, dated Aden Residency, the 26th January 1906. From— Captain F. deB.

From—The Resident, Aden, To—Political Secretary, Bombay. Please refer to your telegram of the 30th January last, regarding the Shujaifi. The Turkish Revenue officer and the Subaihi Sheikh have consented to refrain from trespassing, and to refer dispute to their respective Govern ments. Consequently the Mansuri and other Subaihis have withdrawn from the frontier, and it is reported that the Turkish officials have also withdrawn.

From Sheikh Said al Jorabi, dated nil. honour to forward, for the further information of Government, copies of the marginally noted letters, received, in the course of the week, from the Abdali Sultan, the Mansuri Sheikh, the Sha’bi Sheikh, Sheikh Darwish Battash, the Dubeni and Sheikh Said al Jorabi. 2. Prom these it will appear that local excitement in the vicinity of Mufalis has, for the time being, subsided, and that there has been a mutual withdrawal of both parties from the border. It would at the same time appear that there is a possibility of trouble again arising after the forthcoming Id. And it seems that dues are actually still collected at the post of Al D)ka by certain Arabs nominally, if not actually, on behalf of the Turks. 3. Under these circumstances, it may be held desirable to address the Turkish authorities with a view to the withdrawal of their subjects from the post of Al Doka, and the careful avoidance of any form of encroachment on Shujafa and Shaabi lands, situated on the British side of the border. If desired, I can of course myself make the necessary communication to the Mutaserif of Taiz, through the Vice-Consul of Hodeida, and this would, in such cases, seem a convenient course to follow. 4. In regard to the small border disputes, which occasionally arise on the Amiri border, it has hitherto been the practice for the Political Officer at Dthala to occasionally correspond direct with the Kaimakam of Kataba, and direct correspondence between local officials may frequently prove the most expeditious and the most convenient way of settling disputes of this nature. 5. If desired, intimation can of course be conveyed to the Shaabi Sheikh, that he should himself take steps to effectively occupy the post of Al Doka, and to prevent the collection of dues there, but the peaceable withdrawal of Turkish subjects from that post would seem a desirable preliminary. 4650 F.

These incidente had intensified the hostility of the Kobati against me. He went to the Modir of the district and complained against me, so I was locked U P for ^ ee $11F w re recovered from Shaab. While I was in prison the Kobatis and Absis were informed ttiat Sha’ab was within ttie British limit, nevertheless they ironically sent word to me to say bring the Rohillas (meaning Aden Tioop Sowars) to remove us from fchaab. ^ ^ . The Kotabi lias been illegally using my lands which he still retained m spite of the order issued from Taiz for forbiding him from encroaching on my lands. I now beseech the illustrious British Government to adopt some measures regarding the Kobati or that I might be allowed to fight for my right. The°custom post question may not be forgotten as it is the cause of trouble to the people of Shaab daily. We request, from the generosity and boundless liberality of Government, to assist me with what you can conveniently spare, even if it was on credit, as I have to celebrate a marriage during the Id. I was in the habit of getting presents from Saleh Jaffer and (Colonel) Hunter without any request. \ Dated 4th Al Hijja 1323 (31st January 1906).

As regards Doka, the Turkish officials are still stationed there, and they have a little custom post. The people are much aggrieved for the same. If you, oh friend, can possibly address the Mutasarif of Taiz to order the removal of the Custom post from Doka, please do so and send it to us for transmission. As for the soldiers, who are at the Doka custom post, they are Abdulla Alwan A1 Attawari, Saeed Mohammed A1 Attwari, and Salim A1 Masri, the Zaidi.

After compliments .—We have received your letter in which you instructed us to remain in our houses. We hear, obey and follow the order of a slave of the family of Sultan Padthl Mohsin Padthl, leave alone the order of the good Master. By God and by God since the withdrawal of the survey party, and Sheikh Abdulkawi was imprisoned, we and the Shaabis have expended nearly 2,000$ up to date, and paid it to the Absi, Kobati and others. The ornaments of our wives and our arms are mortgaged with the Absi up to the present day. You have intimated to us that you will represent to the Eesident what is happening to us. We ask you by the one who caused you to be a ruler to communicate our thousand of thousands Salams to him (Resident) and tell him that as long as the custom post is established at Doka and the bad character and mischievous people and thieves of the Turkish subjects and Subehis congregate there, and as long as the Kobati is occupying lands at Shaab and recover revenues from the Sha’abi limit without right, we have no peace. Sheikh Abdul Kawi had proceeded to Taiz to refer his complaint and the Mutsarif had already decided that the Kobati should not encroach upon his neighbours, the subjects of Shaab, and take he should give over the lands which he had misappropriated from them. The Kobati consented and agreed to abide by the decision, but when he arrived in his country, he repudiated the order and said tell Abdul Kawi to bring the Rohillas (Aden Troop) from Khor Maksar and the slave of his father Ahmed (Abdali) to raise my hand from Shaab’. Oh our Lord and Master, please inform the Resident that as long as the Kobati and the custom post are still existing Sha’ab does not belong to its people, nor it is under the British protection. The people at the custom post have consumed privately and openly all our animals. Daily, there is a row between them and our young men. The Kobati on the 28th Sha’aban of the current year raided Shaab, and a fight took place between them and us. The whole time there was firing from both sides and the party in the custom post have supported them. The other tribes had also assisted in stopping us from going into their markets and inter rupted us on the road. Oh Master Sultan Ahmed, we feel sure that all the tribesmen from Taiz to Aden do not fear either of the two Governments as they fear you. If you will look severely on the Kobati, etc , as your predecessor the late Sultan Fadthl bin Ali used to do by writing them, they would not have ventured to trespass on Shaab. We pray to God to prolong your life and give11 you victory against your enemies. We cannot reward you except to say prayers for you. The Zaidi is assisting the Kohati, either by day or night they at times raid on us and other times rob from Shaib. V^e shall now remain in our houses and the condition of the country is as you see and hear.

After compliments.—TVz had addressed you in the month of Ramadthan re°*ardin°- our children (subjects) who are under the British Government and who had^been wrongly encroached upon by the Sublime Government. They were treated in a harsh manner that makes the body shudder so they came crying to us. We had referred ihe matter to you and received a special intimation from you that Shaab was under the protection of the Great Government. Verily, oh master, these are conspicuous places of which ’Uzlat (country) of Mufalis and its dependencies and Sahar are under one Akil, who is of our children (subjects). These people came crying on the advent of Government knowing that these places having been decided, by the Boundary Commission of the Powers as a British limit, which fact you are well aware of. We have summoned the Akils of the Subehis on the arrival of the Sublime Porte on the border with a view of recovering dues from the people, above referred to. We have encamped on the border of the frontier. Bin Khodam and the sons of Kasim Mokbil the Dubeni as well as all the Jorabis have joined us, every one had garrisoned his own border. Nasir I mad and Shouter did not fail to render assistance and service. About 300 men of our people were with us and we have sustained considerable expenses for the sake, of the Great Govern ment. We have met Ahmed No’man, the official of the Sublime Porte, and discussed the matter with him. We have finally arrived at an understanding that each party should abstain from trespassing, and that we should refer the matter to the British Government, while he would represent the same to the Turkish Government. This is what had happened. Tour wisdom is sufficient. Please expedite your reply with particulars. May you be preserved. Dated the 29ih Al Ki’da 1323, (25th January 1906).

On hearing this report we did not approve of it, as we are perfectly sure that if all the Subehis will assemble, they cannot resist the Turks. It is better that if any encroachment is made by the Turkish soldiers, the matter of checking them should be conducted through you either by amicable understanding or by force and not through the Mansuri unless you approve of the same.

After compliments .—We wish to inform your Honour that Sheikh Saleh bin Ahmed Al Mansuri and his tribesmen came to Shaab and summoned the Sheikh of the Subehis, of whom I was one. We proceeded thence and enquired f 1/ •about tbe cause of the invitation. He replied that whoever was a friend, and helper to the British Government, he must garrison and defend the frontier of the said Government. We said we cannot do so without order from Government. He, therefore, showed us a letter from you addressed to Sheikh Shahir in the month of Bamadthan purporting that Shaab was under the protection of the Great Government. We, thereupon, acquiesced and garrisoned the borders of the frontier. Sheikh Ahmed No’man arrived on the 28th A1 Ki’da on behalf of the Sublime Porte and we have mutually come to an understanding that each of us should represent the matter to his own Government. In conclusion we do not know the limit of the Government. We know only the extent of our own territory, so we were afraid to venture at a thing which might not be satisfactory to Government. Hence we represent the matter to you lest we should get into trouble. We request your answer on which we may rely. Salutation. Prom— Sheikh Saeed Al Jokabt, General Mason, Political Eesident, Aden.

In continuation of my letter No. 214-2, dated 19th March 1906, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 2514, dated 27th instant, on the subject of the encroachment on Shaabi lands of Turkish Officials and others in the vicinity of Mafalis.

DeBrath, C.B., C I.E., Political Resident, Aden, To The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. In continuation of previous correspondence on the subject ending with this office letter No- 1319, dated 4th March 1906, I have the honour to now forward translation of a letter recently received from Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed Nasir, the Shaabi, in which he complains of an apparently somewhat mischievous incursion of Turkish Officials and subjects which took place on the 6th instant. 2. Prom other native sources, I gather that some damage was caused to the Shaabi crops by the Turkish Officials riding through them and also allow ing their animals to graze upon them. But I am asking the Sheikh to inform me more specifically of the amount of damage actually caused. 3. It would appear desirable that some notice should be taken of this occurrence, which from the Sheikh’s reference to Bin Nasir would seem to have taken place with the connivance, or at the instance of Sheikh Mahomed Nasir Mukbil. Dated 20th Safar 1324 (14th April 1906). ir rom —S heikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed Nasir, As-Shabi, To— General Mason, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments. We beg to represent to your honour’s offices, that we had and still con tinue to complain of the sudden intrusion of Mahomed Kahtan, the Kotaibi, upon our cultivations, of the misdoing and encroachment of the soldiers stationed at the Customs post at Doka upon the inhabitants of Shaab, of the support given by the Kotaibi to the soldiers at Doka and of their disavowal of Shaab being under the British protection. On the 12th Safar (6th April 1906) at 12 o’clock noon a party of upwards of 20 men consisting of Turkish and Arab soldiers had unexpectedly appeared at Wadi Shaab some riding on horses and mules and others on foot. The inhabi tants of Shaab, the shepherds and keepers of the fields were dismayed and alarmed at their appearance. They (soldiers) destroyed the cultivations and set free their horses and mules amongst the cultivations. We sent some one to ask them where they come from and w ho was their leader ? They replied that their leader was a Turk, the Superintendent of Custom, and that they had come from Mavia on behalf of Bin Nasir to collect the Customs dues. Half of them stayed with the man in charge of the Custom at (Doka) and then departed. CHORD oThey deliberately rode across the fields and allowed their horses and mules to trample the cultivation. They inspired terror into the minds of the people of Shaab of the Karari and Kobati and declared that whoever mentions the name of the English Government or follows Sheikh Abdul Kwai shall have only himself to blame. The poor people are wailing and crying out for assis tance against the misdoing of the Kotaibi and the Customs Officer.V ‘Of* )eT f , No. 4269, dated Bombay Castle, the 13th June 1906.

Dated (IBtli Rabi Awal 1324) lOth May 1906, From— Noman Ahmed Ash-Shyaiei, of Shaab, To—-The Political Resident and the Assistant Resident, Aden. After compliments. We had come to you in the sacred month of A1 Hijja, seeking your protec tion against the encroachment of the Turkish Government and their officials, and you told us that Sha’ab was included in the territory under the protection of the Great British Government. We had been convinced of the same but we have received an order from the Matasarif of Ta’iz district and the Moudir, named Hasan Sabri, on Tuesday the 15th Rabi Awal at 10 a.m. by the hand of one of the slaves of the Government directing us to expedite the immediate transmission of the property (dues) of Government failing which we shall suffer severe punishment. The Mutasarif wrote us that he intends to visit this part of the country. We are therefore alarmed of this tiding. The order was a general order addressed to all the Sheikhs of the Kotaibi, Absi, Athwari, Ghariki, Aghbari and the other Sheikhs subordinate to the district. We have been included amongst those Sheikhs. We had taken the order with a view to send it to you but the names of the other Sheikhs mentioned therein, debarred us from retaining it so we have left it alone. si e: if * &lt; 1 I Sheikh Abdul Kawi and we had written you a letter on 20th Safar (14th April 1906), that the Turkish Officials accompanied by their soldiers and the Athwaris, had traversed Wadi Sha’b and terrified our women and children, and destroyed onr cultivation with their horses. They went as far as Nobat al Absi at Doka, i.e. } the custom post. They remained there for two hours and returned back to the said Wadi in the same manner as they came.We awaited your reply but we have received no letter from you as yet. Please write soon and expeditiously and give us an assuring reply about all the matters we mentioned and write also to Mutasarif and the Moudir explaining to them clearly about the place and telling that our children and women should be unmolested. May you be preserved. This is a second evidence (intimation) that the Kobatis have come to Sha’b with the intention of fighting the people of the country and to create distur bances. The order lies with you.1 Q j/ w No. 5129, dated Bombay Castle, the 21st July 1906.

After compliments. I inform you that on the 25th Rabi Akher 1324 (17th June 1906) a party of Turkish soldiers arrived at Shaab asserting that they are in possession of an order from Sheikh Ahmed bin Cassim Hasan the Kayem Makam of the Hojariya authorizing them to occupy the custom post at Doka. They were however prevented by the men who were previouslv m charge of the customs post. They then lived in a hamlet of Shaab and commenced to Qv, n o y r, ^ n ^ a ^ tan . t Shaab. Subsequently a party comprising of the sons of the Sheikhs of the Kobatis and some Athwaries followed and declared that they had an order from the Maudir to the effect that they were to occupy the post and they intended to create a tight at Shaab with one another as each party pretended to possess an order to occupy the post and take charge of the customs. On the 2nd Jumad (24th June 1906) the Turkish Maudir at Mafalis arrived with a large force of troops and encamped at the customs, whereupon the people of Shaab were excessively terrified. On the 3rd of the said month (25th June) after the agriculturists and peasants had gone away and every person went to mind his business, I heard shouts and yells from the direction of the hills and the valley, and the people were fleeing with their animals promiscuously and the confusion and excitement was to such an extent that no one could hear what was the matter. The people and children were in a state of panic. Then I set forth from my dwelling and went out asking what was the cause of the excite ment, whereupon I was told that soipe Turks and Arabs, partly riding and partly on foot, were on the hills and some were in the Wadi. Thereupon I rode a swift donkey and hastened and confronted the sowars, I asked what they wanted and why they had alarmed the peasants and children of the country. They responded that they had come in the company of Hasan Sabri the Maudir. I asked as to where he was and when he was pointed out to me I went and caught the bridle of the horse and said “ Woe be to you why did you come suddenly and unexpectedly that all population were startled and frightened ; your wishes would be attained, but order the men on the hills to descend and peace to be proclaimed to the people that they may be pacified and be tranquilized’k They said that they came to see us, pay a pilgrimage to the saints at Shaab and be our guests for the day. I welcomed thorn and at the same time remarking that they ought not to have come with such a large force before giving previous notice. I proceeded in advance until we came to the station at the hostelry belonging to the Syeds, and they requested to have forage and grain for their horses and mules as well as dinner, coffee and other necessaries for themselves. I recognized the Arabs who were with them to be some Sheikhs of the Athwaries, Arikis, Abus, Aghabira, Kobatis and all the other Sheikhs of the district save the Shujaifi of Shaab who hid themselves and did not venture to appear. Pol 11452 i. i aolred me aa to where was Jabal Rakaiza. After dinner the ?J au&lt;31 ^ f g haab po j n ting it to him. He then asked where Najd I told him ^ was on the no ^ forthe/asked where Najd Shaab was and I said Jaima was and I P 01 ^ted i * • t0 b i m .

They also told them that whoever declares tbat N was nbder the British protection shall be imprisoned and his properties plundered All the Sheikhs of the district asked the Mandir to permit them to uso torce in case the A ( ‘ sb „ a v.i s i ara submit and go to Haifan to pay him the dues. The Mand.r said that they (Shaab.s) are allowed a period up to the end of the current month.

The Maudir left but kept some garrison of the Kobatis in one of the houses of the Shaabis besides those already in charge of the custom post. The Maudir a so or e rebuilding a post which wbs dilapidated within the southern limit of ohaa a u or more distance below Rakaiza. I did not consider it safe to place sop 1 ® garrison °PPO to their men but kept about 10 men in a house close to the post which they in J® ndecl t0 reconstruct and I have prevented the mason and labourers from proceeding tbe Now the people are very much afraid of the permission granted 6 aa ,™ tribesmen to recover from them whatever they wished. Ihe Maudir direc e , of Athwaris to rebuild the houses belonging to Abd Muhammad which were demolished by the Boundary Commission and to post the customs authority at Mulaiis ore. All the Kobatis, Sheikhs and others have taken solemn oath that they shall not behave or pay one ” para ' (cent.) nnless the peple of Shaab pay up (the dues) and that the Sulime Government may authorize them to combine against the dues from them for three years at once. Finally I h^® been saying °° ^ u , ' tb Sheikhs of the Kobatis and Abus have said to some of the people of Mandir shall not escape dauger unless they killed Sheikh Abdul Kawi (t.e., told some of the tribesmen that whoever kills me will be paid by him $ oOO. This is what I write you about and just as I am writing this letter three K Khadims (low caste) came with a message to all the people of Shaab that they , d within which they must allow the Kobatis and the custom authority to bui e p to pay up the dues otherwise they shall have no peace either in the country or o pYou may consider and make haste to adopt such measures as may save the people of Shaab from being plundered and killed by the Kobatis and Abus, &amp;c. There is nothing to prevent the tribesmen after they are told by Maudir that if they plundered and killed the Shaabis the English cannot send an expedition against them as several countries have followed the English and were plundered and captured by the Turks while no one had done them any good. The tribe would not be kept under restrain from doing aggression unless it should be proclaimed by beat of tom tom at Aden, Sheikh Othman and Lahej that Shaab is included under the British protection, and that if any of the tribes should interfere with Shaab, their sons would be arrested at those places. If any aggression is made they (tribesmen) should not say that they were not warned. If the people will hear of this they will be afraid because they are all in need for their requirements from Aden and Lahej and are unable to cease from visiting those places. This is what we inform you, and, your opinion is sufficient. We request the Great Government to send up our present as well as 4 bags of jowari and 4 bags of rice as we are put to too much loss at Shaab owing to the boundary affair. Every year the Amir (Sultan) Ahmed Fadthl assists us with jowari and rice, but this year we ask the generosity of the Great Government for the same. (No date) From—Sayyed Kadri Yasin ; To—The Political Resident, Aden. After compliments. I inform you that I had visited the Mafalis for some business I had there and found the Maudir of the Kobati District with many Turks and Arabs collected there. They left for Shaab and I went along with them. When they arrived at the southern part of Shaab they summoned the Shujaifi Sheikhs, but none of them appeared. While the horsemen and footmen were proceeding the agriculturists and peasants were frightened and much alarmed. Sheikb Abdul Kawi the Shaabi told them not to be afraid and went to the Maudir and expostulated with him and the Sheikhs of the district for coming so suddenly and unexpectedly that the citizens were terrified. He told them that it would have been better if they had sent an intimation of their intended visit. The Maudir replied thac he had come to see them (Abdul Kawi and others) and pay a pilgrim age to the Saints at Shaab and he was their guest. Abdul Kawi welcomed and ordered for them dinner and coffee. The Maudir then commenced to ask Abdul Kawi as to where the hill of Rakaiza, Naid Jaima, Najd Shaab, Nobat Absi, Rafd, Nobat, &amp;c. s were and Shaikh Abdul Kawi explaind to him all the above places. The Kobati and the Abus of the Zakkera repudiated his statement and much argument took place between them. Sheikh Abdul Kawi declared that he was not aware of Nobat Absi being inexistence in Shaab or its limits, ^ey (Sheikhs) pointed out that the Noba existing there was called Nobat Absi. Sheikh Abdul Kawi replied that the name of the Noba under reference was Nobat*al-Mikrad. Ihe Maudir then ordered the customs authority to occupy and build it. S haikh Abdul Kawi protested against the building of it. That Noba is situate to the south of Shaab and the south of the hills of Shaab. There was much discussion between the Maudir and the Sheikhs while Sheikh Abdul Nam was alone and there was no one of the Subehis at Wadi Maudir or others to back him up except myself who did not know the name of the places nor had I been to the limits of Shaab before this time. Sef Diban was amongst the companions of the Maudir who came along with him from Haifan. Sef Diban was with the survey party, b u t be did not support Sheikh Abdul Kawi. On the contrary he sided the Abus and falsified Sheikh Abdul Kawi in many things. The Maudir asked Sheikh Abdul Kawi regarding Jabal Asia, Farw Sahr, Sukmi and Tukar. I observe that the Sheikhs and the Maudir bear ill-feeling towards Sheikh Abdul Kawi and they (Sheikhs) had taken solemn oath in the presence of the Maudir that they would never act submissively or pay even a 'para (cent), while ^baab was under the British protection. They (Sheikhs) had talked a great deal about Shaab and Sheikh Abdul Kawi, and told the Maudir that Abdul Kawi was the trustee on behalf of the English who fixed for him monthly pay.

With reference to correspondence ending with this Office No. 4559, dated 4th August 1906, I have the honour to report that further letters have been received from Sheikh Abdul Kowi bin Mahomed of Shaab, in which he states that the Turkish Mudir, Husen Sahri, now contemplates the erection of another customs post near A1 Doka, which he has at present succeeded in preventing him from doing, and again complains of the aggressive conduct and the um warranted demands of one Salim Abdul Wahab, the Kobati at the village of the Kawaidtha, which is believe/to be situated within the limits of this Protectorate. ^ A2 T forward for the information of Government copies of two letters received and of the reply sent to the Sheikh as well as of a letter which I have addressed to the Abdali Sultan on the subject. 3. It would appear desirable that no fresh customs post should he estab lished in the close vicinity of A1 Doka, and that, if possible, arrangements for the collection of customs should be confined to Mafalis itself. Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed NasiiIj the Sliaabi* To—M ajor-General E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Acting Political Resident at Aden. After Compliments. —We beg to represent to the Great Government that after the Mudir,Husen Sabri, had visited Shaab, we have been compelled to maintain a garrison near the Custom post, because the Mudir has directed that a new post should be built and selected a place for its construction on the southern side of the hill of Shaab, whereas the old post was on the northern side of the hill. We have been preventing their attempts whenever they sent labourers. 2 Sheikh Salim Abdul Wahab, the Kobati, during the month of Rajah last year went to a village belonging to the people of Shaab near the Kobati limit carried away their cattle and goats and recovered $30 from the subjects of Shaab and imprisoned two men. When we came to know about it we had represented the matter to the Great Government, but as no steps were taken, and Sheikh Salim Abdul Wahab observed that none of either Governments called upon him to account for his action, has again this year visited the same village with a large force, while we were in the Mansuri country, garrisoned and imposed taxes and also took away the cattle of the inhabitant of the village above alluded to. He, moreover, made the people to sign a bond to the effect that they are residing within and under the Kobati country. He kept garrison in two * X)ars , (houses) as he is afraid that we might punish the villagers who acquiesced to that. 3. Hajee Shahir, the Ahsi, has been negotiating with us with a view that we might persuade the people of Shaab to pay the dues to Government. We herewith send you one of his letters. We hope that the Great Government will not be regardless of this matter and to put a stop to the doings of Sheikh Salim Abdul Wahab, the Kobati, and Hajee Shahir, and to consider as to what may be good. We have already sustained great losses and expense and we do not know what we might do. Enclosure to Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed Nasir, the Shabi's letter with out date) received on the 6th August 1966. We have received your letter. We were expecting you to come person ally, but since you offered your excuse there is no matter. We get news to the effect that you are preventing the people of Shaab from coming and paying the dues of Government and that (you state) they are exempted by the Sublim Government from such payment. This news has reached Sheikh Ahmed Kasim. We were surprised to hear it, in spite of what we had written you before that you should refrain from acting contrary to the wishes of Govern ment inasmuch as the people of Shaab and their dependence to the Govern ment is concerned. Hitherto they had neither paid a dollar or showed their obedience. We trust that they will pay the dues for the present and last year their excuse for non-payment is your prevention. As to the documents we know nothing about them as at that time Sheikh Ismail Abdul Karim was in authority, and they (documents) were not with us. We swear that we have no knowledge of them. Had they been with us we would have sent them to you as we have no interest in retaining them. Human beings are answerable for their deeds and by their character tuey show their honesty. (No date.) HAJEE SHAHIR, THE ABSI.From—S heikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed Nasir Al Shaabi, To —Major-General E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident at Aden. After Compliments .— [ inform you that two days after my letter of 15th Jemad Akhar 1324 (August 1906) was despatched to you, Sheikh Salim Abdul Wahab had imprisoned two of the subjects of Shaab and up to now they are confined. Be it known to you that there are three men of the Shaabis intriguing with the Shaabis, endeavouring to kill me and are paid by the Customs soldier and Salim Abdul Wahab to do so. These men were paying tribute to my grand fathers. They are circulating reports amongst the people that I am trying to give the suzerainty to the infidels over them, while they -inhabitant of Shaab) were Muslims, that I am fond of the English and disliking the Islamic power and many things of this nature. It was these men who passed a document testifying that the village of the Kawaidtha which is in the mouth of Shaab is within the Kobati limit. I had secured the arrest and imprisoned one of these men but he had jumped from the top of the house and escaped to the Kowatis. He was the biggest pig and mischief maker who promulgated rumours in Shaab and all other places to the effect that Sheikh Abdul Kawi’s (the writer) pro clivities are towards the British religion and that he propitiates their Govern ment. He had heard that I wish to arrest and confine him so he fled away to Aden. On a former occasion he had caused a report to be circulated that the Turks had driven the British Government from many places and turned them away from Egypt in the course of one hour; that the Turks had taken posses sion of all the British war materials on land and sea, and that the British Gov ernment had taken one year’s time for the evacuation of Aden and handing it over to Turkey. He said “ Oh people of Shaab be not misled by Abdul Kavvi that you are included in the protection of British Government. The British Government itself is going to withdraw from Aden.” When I heard of these stories I apprehended him but many people inter vened and I released him after taking solemn undertaking from him that his is repentant. He after that had resorted to these fabulous stories. Now the mischievous and son of mischievous man and in whose family the intrigues and seditions is well established since time immemorial is coming to you I am complaining to the Great Government against him, but if the Government would take no notice of his misdeeds I claim my rights against him. When he comes to you you might threaten him by imprisonment so that he might leave your place terrified. This fact should be made known to the people inasmuch as that, he had run away to save himself. This act may become an example to others, otherwise you may detain him in custody until my Agent appears before you. From this procedure every one will learn a lesson and refrain from exciting Jahad (religious war) or speaking baselessly concerning matters of * No, I do not know him »„r have itver ,«m religion Or affecting the pOWOTS. Olir him. dear Ah Jailer knows* him. His name (id.) a. j. Yehia Ba Sef Al Kawaidthi, a subject of the Shaabis. Should he return from Aden this time uncensured or intimidated he would declare Jehad on us. There is no bigger liar or more cursed man than him throughout the world. A hint is sufficient to the wise. The matter is left at your disposal. No. 5240, dated Aden Residency, the 2nd September 1906. Erom— Major-General E.

You must of course be careful to confine the actions of your own garrison, of which you write, to your own side of the boundary. We are informino' Government of the Mudir’s intention. We are also informing Government of Sheikh Salim Abdul Wahab’s actions in the village of Kawaidtha. British subjects need of course pay no dues to Turkish officials. But, on the other hand, any people who may be living at Kawaidtha and at the same time cultivating lands within Turkish limits must of course pay their proper dues for such lands. We understand that one Yehia bin Sef Al Kawaidthi has a foolish tongue. He is not now in Aden we are informed; No doubt you will be able to per suade him of his folly in due course.

(Sd.) E. DeBRATH, Major-General, Bolitical Resident, Aden. Confidential No. 472. Political Agent’s Office, Bthala, 24th May 1906. The two sons of Sheikh ’Ali Abdul Karim of Juban have come, with a letter to the Resident, in which it is stated that he wishes to adhere to the friendship formerly evinced by the British Government, and has written from time to time his desire that we should come to that country and delimit it. The sons say their father, the Sheikh, is anxious for his country’s future, and would know its destiny, 2. I have told them now, as often before, that Juhan, being apparently under Turkish influence, it is advisable for them to desist from further requests of this nature, and that, as we are friends of the Turks, it is necessary for us to observe the Golden Rule, and steer clear of action that would be unintel ligible to the Turks. 3. This is Government’s policy. The fact remains that our strict attitude of non-interference with the customs and traditions of the Arabs is daily adding to the number of those across the line, who, disgusted with Turkish methods of rule, will ever consider us their friends, and will continue to crave our protection. This is as it should be. (Sd.) H. E. JACOB, Major, Bolitical Agent, Bthala. To The Eirst Assistant Resident, Aden. 3 1Prom The Hon’ble Sir Steyning W.

We bad come to you in the sacred month of A1 Hijja, seeking your protec tion against the encroachment of the Turkish Government and their officials, and you told us that Sha’ab was included in the territory under the protection of the Great British Government. We had been convinced of the same but we have received an order from the Matasarif of Ta’iz district and the Moudir, named Hasan Sabri, on Tuesday the 15th Rabi Awal at 10 a.m. by the hand of one of the slaves of the Government directing us to expedite the immediate transmission of the property (dues) of Government failing which we shall suffer severe punishment. The Mutasarif wrote us that he intends to visit this 1part of the country* We are therefore alarmed of this tiding. The order was a general order addressed to all the Sheikhs of the Kotaibi, Absi, Athwari Ghariki, Aghhari and the other Sheikhs subordinate to the district. We have been included amongst those Sheikhs. W T e had taken the order with a view to send it to you hut the names of the other Sheikhs mentioned therein, debarred us from retaining it so we have left it alone. Sheikh Abdul Kawi and we had written you a letter on 20th Safar (14th April 1906), that the Turkish Officials accompanied by their soldiers and the Athwaris, had traversed Wadi Sha’b and terrified our women and children, and destroyed our cultivation with their horses. They went as far as Nobat al Absi at Doka, i.e., the custom post. They remained there for two hours and returned back to the said Wadi in the same manner as they came. We awaited your reply but we have received no letter from you as yet. Please write soon and expeditiously and give us an assuring reply about all the matters we mentioned and write also to Mutasarif and the Moudir explaining to them clearly about the place and telling that our children and women should be unmolested. Unto 1 5ec. May you be preserved. This is a second evidence (intimation) that the Kobatis have come to Shad with the intention of fighting the people of the country and to create distur bances.

From other native sources, I gather that some damage was caused to the Shaabi C6j/ps by the Turkish officials residing through them and also allowing their animals to graze upon them. But I am asking the Sheikh to inform me more specifically of the amount of damage actually caused. 3 It would appear desirable that some notice shouldbe taken of this occurrence, which from the Sheikhs reference to Bin Nasir would seen to have taken place with the connivance, or at the instance of Sheikh i:ohannad Nasir Mukbil.

Te beg to represent to your honour's Offices, that we had and still continue to complain of the sudden intrusion of Muhammad Kahtan the Rotaibi, upon our cultiva tions, of the misdoing and encroachment of the soldiers stationed at the Customs post at Doka upon the inhabitants of Shaab, of the support given by the Kotaibi to the soldiers at Doka and of their disavowal of Shaab being under the British protection. On the 12th Safar ( 6th April 1906) at 12 o'clock noon a party of upwards of 20 men consisting of Turkishmmmmm and .\rab soldiers had unexpectedly appeared at Wadi Shaabi some riding on horses and mules and others on foot. The inhabitants of Chaab, the shepherds and keepers of the fields were dismayed and alarmed at their appearance. They(soldiers destroyed the cultivations and set free their horses and mules \ among*t the cultivations. Te sent some one to ask them where they come from and who was their leader ? They replied that their leader was a Turk, the Superintendent of Custom, and that they had come from liavia on behalf of Bin Misir to collect the customs dues. Half of then stayed with the man in charge of the custom at(Doka) and then departed. They {P+ ] ^ ' deliberately rode across the fields and allowed their horses 'V 1 and mules to trample the cultivation. They inspired terror into the minds of the people of Chaab of the Karari and Kobati and declared that whoever mentions the name of the nglish Crovernment ot follows Sheikh Abdul Kawi shall have only himself to blame. The poor people are wailing and crying out for assistance against the misdoing of the Kotaibi and the Customs Officer.

With reference to my letter No. 554, dated the 28th ultimo, I hare the honour to forward, for the further information of Government, copies of the marginally noted letters, received, in the course of the week, from the Abdali Sultan, the Mansuri Sheikh, the Sha’bi Sheikh, Sheikh Darwish Battash, the Dubeni and Sheikh Said al Jorabi. From Sheikh Abdulkawi bin Mahomed Ash- Sha’bi, received on 29th January 1906. From Abdali Sultan, dtted the 31st January 1906, with one enclosure. From Sheikh Sbahir bin Sef, the Mansuri, dated 17th January 1906. From the Abdali Sultan, dated the 25th January 1906. J From Sheikh Darwish Battash, the Dubebi, dated January 1906. From Sheikh Said al Jorabi, dated nil. 2 . From these it will appear that local excitement in the vicinity of Mufalis has, for the time being, subsided, and that there has been a mutual withdrawal of both parties from the border. It would at the same time appear that there is a possibility of trouble again arising after the forthcoming Id. And it seems that dues are actually still collected at the post of Al Doka by certain Arabs nominally, if not actually, on behalf of the Turks. 3. Under these circumstances, it may be held desirable to address the Turkish authorities with a view to the withdrawal of their subjects from the post of Al Doka, and the careful avoidance of any form of encroachment on Shujafa and Shaabi lands, situated on the British side of the border. If desired, I can of course myself make the necessary communication to the Mutaserif of Taiz, through the Vice-Consul of Hodeida, and this would, in such cases, seem a convenient course to follow. 4. In regard to the small border disputes, which occasionally arise on the Amiri border, it has hitherto been the practice for the Political Officer at Dthala to occasionally correspond direct with the Kaimakam of Kataba, 4 5 6 and direct correspondence between local officials may frequently prove the most expeditious and the most convenient way of settling disputes of this nature. 5. If desired, intimation can of course be conveyed to the Shaabi Sheikh, that he should himself take steps to effectively occupy the post of Al Doka* and to prevent the collection of dues there, but the peaceable withdrawal of Turkish subjects from that post would seem a desirable preliminary. 4660 F. D.4- 1 6 Of course should Government decide that the Subehi country should be toured in by a Political Officer, as has been previously suggested, the setUe- ment of the affairs of Shaab could be made one of his first objectives. p rom _ Sheikh Abdtjlkawi bin Mohamed, Ash-Shaabi, To —General Mason, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—I bes to represent to your Majesty’s exalted Govern, ment that, after the intimidation and alarm to which the people of Shaab were subjected to, by the Kobati and Absi, a letter was received from Ahmed Fadthl informing them (people of Sha’b) to remain in their houses, not to interfere with the Turkish soldiers or their subjects, that they are admitted under the pioteo tion of the British Government, and that, if any one should interfere with them, thevmight let him know, and he would represent the case u&gt; the Resident of Aden. They consequently were pacified, and enthusiastically prayed for your Government, they praised' God and thanked Him for the same. As to myself, personally, by the Grace of God, all the people from Taiz to the o&gt;ate of Aden, including the Kaimakam of the JBojaria, and all the Sayads and Sheikhs are my friends. I have been speaking unfavourably of the Turks, and eulogizing the British Government. I have no enemy except three men, two are Kobati and an Absi, who is the Akil of the Ta’arita? He and the Arari were the cause of the Dareja incident. He wrote to them (Dareja people) to proclaim religious war, which they did. I went to the Kaim .kam in connec tion with this matter, therefore, 1 incurred the displeasure of Mohamed Nasir, and Fari* ’Ayedth, who conspired against the Sha’bis, and caused the seizure of 40 loads of bees belonging to them, for the redemption of which we had to pay $1,000. Eventually Mohamed Nasir was taken to Sana’a, This was the cause of the enmity between the Absi, Kobati and myself j the rest of the people, however, always come to me for advice, and are anxious to find out if there is any way of getting them admitted to the protection of the British Government. I am telling them to be patient. When the survey party arrived at Wadi Ma’adin, I informed Mr. Fitz Maurice and his friends that Wadi Shaab was within the Subehi country. Mustafa Renzi and the Military Lieutenant-Colonel then asked me to show proofs to that effect, and I had produced documentary proofs. These incidents had intensified the hostility of the Kobati against me. He went to the Modir of the district and complained against me, so I was locked up for three months and $115 were recovered from Shaab. While I was in prison the Kobatis and Absis were informed that Sha’ab was within the British limit, ne\ertheless they ironically sent word to me to say bring the Bohillas (meaning Aden Troop Sowars) to remove us from Sbaab. The Kotabi has been illegally using my lands which he still retained in spite of the order issued from Taiz for forbiding him from encroaching on my lands. I now beseech the illustrious British Government to adopt some measures regarding the Kobati or that 1 might be allowed to fight for my right. The custom post question may not be forgotten as it is the cause of trouble to the people of Sbaab daily. We request, from the generosity and boundless liberality of Government, to assist me with what \ ou can conveniently spare, even if it was on credit, as I have to celebrate a marriage during the 'Id. I was in the habit of getting presents from Saleh Jaffer and (Colonel) Hunter without any request.mumjsmrnmmm fcjj, Siiaai^ Were, ^®Tsi's{j i tllf ifi;' firstly, that we shall write to the Akils of Shaab as you have proposed and shall advise Kayed No’man as hinted in your letter above referred to. As regards Doka, the Turkish officials are still stationed there, and they have a little custom post. The people are much aggrieved for the same. If you, oh friend, can possibly address the Mutasarif of Taiz to order the removal of the Custom post from Doka, please do so and send it to us for transmission. As for the soldiers, who are at the Doka custom post, they are Abdulla Alwan A1 Attawari, Saeed Mohammed A1 Attwari, and Salim A1 Masri, the Zaidi. The last mentioned is a Subehi and is not a Turkish subject. We herewith send you the enclosed letter from all the people of Shaab stating their grievances. Please return us the same as well as the letter of Kayed No’man. May you be preserved. Evdosure.

By God and by God since the withdrawal of the survey party, and Sheikh Abdulkawi was imprisoned, we and the Shaabis have expended nearly 2,000$ up to date, and paid it to the Absi, Kobati and others. The ornaments of our wives and our arms are mortgaged with the Absi up to the present day. You have intimated to us that you will represent to the Eesident what is happening to us. We ask you by the one who caused you to be a ruler to communicate our thousand of thousands Salams to him (Resident) and tell him that as long as the custom post is established at Doka and the bad character and mischievous people and thieves of the Turkish subjects and ► Suhehis congregate there, and as long as the Kobati is occupying lands at Shaab and recover revenues from the Sha’abi limit without right, we have no peace. Sheikh Abdul Kawi had proceeded to Taiz to refer his complaint and the Mutsarif had alreadv decided that the Kobati should not encroach upon his neighbours, the subjects of Shaab, and take he should give over the lands which he had misappropriated from them. The Kobati consented and agreed to abide by the decision, but when he arrived in his country, he lepudiated the order and said tell Abdul Kawi to bring the Rohillas (Aden Troop) from Khor Maksar and the slave of his father Ahmed (Ahdali) to raise my hand from Shaab’. Oh our Lord and Master, please inform the Resident that as long as the Kobati and the custom post are still existing Sha’ab does not belong to its people, nor it is under the British pr &gt;tection The people at^ the custom post have consumed privately and openly all our animals. Daily, there is a row between them and our young men. The Kobati on the 28th Sha’aban of the current year raided Shaab, and a fight took place between them and us. The whole time there was firing from both sides anu the party in the custom post have supported them. The other tribes had also assisted in stopping us from going into their markets and inter rupted ns on the road. Oh IMaster feultan Ahmed, we feel sure that all the tribesmen from Taiz to Aden do not tear either oi tue two Governments as the) fear you. If you will look severely on the Kobati, etc , as your predecessor the late Sultan Fadthl bin Ali used to\lo by writing them, they would not have ventured to trespass on Sbaab. We pray to God to prolong your life and give4 you victory against your enemies. We cannot reward you except to say prayers for you. The Z iidi is assisting the Kobati, either by day or night they at times raid on us and other times rob from Shaab. We shall now remain in our houses and the condition of the country is as you see and hear. * Dated 22nd Al KiMa 1323, (17th January 1906). From—S haik Shahie bin See, the Mansuri, To—The Political Resident, Aden. After compliments.—We had addressed you in the month of Ramadthan regarding our children (subjects) who are under the British Government and who had been wrongly encroached upon by the Sublime Government. They were treated in a harsh manner that makes the body shudder so they came crying to us. We had referred the matter to you and received a special intimation from you that Shaab was under the protection of the Great Government. Verily, oh master, these are conspicuous places of which ’Uzlat (country) of Mufalis and its dependencies and Sahar are under one Akil, who is of our children (subjects). These people came crying on the advent of Government knowing that these places having been decided, by the Boundary Commission of the Powers as a British limit, which fact you are well aware of. We have summoned the Akils of the Subehis on the arrival of the Sublime Porte on the border with a view of recovering dues from the people, above referred to. We have encamped on the border of the frontier. Bin Khodam and the sons of Kasim Mokbd the Dubeni as well as all the Jorabis have joined us, every one had garrisoned his own border. Nasir Imad and Shooter did not fail to render assistance and service. About 300 men of our people were with us and we have sustained considerable expenses for the sake of the Great Govern ment. We have met Ahmed No’man, the official of the Sublime Porte, and discussed the matter with him. We have finally arrived at an understanding that each party should abstain from trespassing, and that we should refer the matter to the British Government, while he would represent the same to the Turkish Government. This is what had happened. Tour wisdom is sufficient. Please expedite your reply with particulars. May you be preserved. Dated the 29th Al Ki’da 1323, (25th January 1906). From— Sultan Sie Ahmed Fadthl, the Abdali, To— Geneeal Mason, Aden. Afer compliments.—We inform your Honour that we have heard that Saleh bin Ahmed, the Mansuri, had collected 50 men of the Mansuri tribesmen and took them to the Shujaifi country in direction of Shaab with the intention of fighting the Turkish soldiers. On hearing this report we did not approve of it, as we are perfectly sure that if all the Subehis will assemble, they cannot resist the Turks. It is better that if any encroachment is made by the Turkish soldiers, the matter of checking them should be conducted through you either by amicable understanding or by force and not through the Mansuri unless you approve of the same. May you he preserved. Dated Al Hijja 1323 (January 1906). From -Sheikh Daewish Battash, the Dubeni, To—The Political Resident, Aden. ,. 4/&lt;er compliments .—We wish to inform your Honour that Sheikh Saleh el! 1 'f l ! m f ( !, A c. , ansuri and his tribesmen came to Shaab and summoned the ei o the Subehis, of whom I was one. We proceeded thence and enquiredabout the cause of the invitation. He replied that whoever was a friend, and helper to the British Government, he must garrison and defend the frontier of the said Government. We said we cannot do so without order from Government. He, therefore, showed us a letter from you addressed to Sheikh Shahir in the month of Ramadthan purporting that Shaab was under the protection of the Great Government. We, thereupon, acquiesced and garrisoned the borders of the frontier. Sheikh Ahmed No’man arrived on the 28th A1 Hi da on behalf of the Sublime Porte and we have mutually come to an understanding that each of us should represent the matter to his own Government. In conclusion we do not know the limit of the Government. We know only the extent of our ow r n territory, so we were afraid to venture at a thing which might not be satisfactory to Government. Hence we represent the matter to you lest we should get into trouble. We request your answer on which we may rely. Salutation.

All the tribes, who were encamped on the edge of the border, have also returned to their respective homes, and we likewise returned to our home on Tuesday, the 5th, Al Hijja (30th January 1906).

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, ; II The Under Secretary of State, India Office0 No. 1126, dated Bombay Castle, the 9th February 1906 (Confidential). From J. J. Heaton, Esq., Acting 1 Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram, dated the 28ih January 1906, I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 554, dated 28th idem, and of its enclosures, regarding the arrival at Mufalis of a Turkish Revenue official and the consequent unrest caused amongst the members of the Shujaifa tribe who reside on the British side of the border and within Mansuri limits. Prom a subsequent telegram, dated the 3rd February 1906, from the Political Resident, Aden, copy of which is enclosed, it will be observed that the uneasi ness of the tribes has subsided for the present. I am also to send a copy of my reply to the letter. No. 554, dated Aden Residency, the 28th January 1906 (Confidential). From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, . To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. o ' / f With reference to correspondence ending with your letterVo. 5703, dated L the 11th September last, and to my telegram of the 27th instant, concerning the presence of a Turkish Revenue officer at Mafalis, and the subsequent J?' ^ urnest amongst certain of the Subaihis who reside in that vicinity, I have the honour to report that, upon receipt of your letter No. 5703 in last September, the Abdali Sultan was addressed, with a view to verifying the complaint of Turkish encroachment upon Sha’abi lands, and of the wrongful collection of dues at the A1 Doka Customs House. 2. On the 23rd October a reply was received from the Abdali Sultan, a copy of which, and of its accompaniment, is attached, and it was not till the 8th instant that any further communication was received from him on the subject. The Abdali Sultan then forw arded a letter which he had received from the Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Muhamed of Sha’ab of which, and of my reply to which, copies are also attached. 3. Upon the strength of this communication the Abd&amp;li Sultan took it upon himself to address a letter to Kayed Nohnan, an Arab subordinate of the Turkish Revenue Department at Mafalis, and he also wrote to the Akils of the Sha’abi country counselling patience. Copies of these letters, and of the Abdali Sultan’s letter, dated the 17th instant, are attached. 4. On the 25th instant another letter was received from the Abdali Sultan, enclosing a letter received by him from Kayed No’man, and about the same time further letters were received from certain Sheikhs of the Jorabi, the Mansab of the Sanawi, and also Sheikh Shahir di/i Sef of the Mansuri tribe, which tend to show that the arrival of the Turkish Revenue official at Mafalis has led to a certain amount of loca excitement. I attach copies of the letters here referred to, and also of the replies issued to them yesterday. 5. A further letter has this morning been received from Sheikh Abdul Kawi bin Mahomed of Sha’ab, from which it appears that, so far as Sha’ab is concerned, the excitement has, for the present, subsided. It will be observed from the attached copy that the Customs House at Al Doka is still complained of. 6. It may be hoped that the Mansuri Sheikh will, upon receipt of my last letter to him, also allay excitement over this affair amongst his own tribesmen, and that the Turkish officials will exercise sufficient discretion in the matter of the collection of their dues to avoid any serious complications. 4543 F. D.7. The Shujaifa sub-tribe, from whom the Turkish official is anxious to collect revenue, reside partly on the Turkish side of the border, and partly in the Wadi Sha’ab, and at Shaban, in the Mansuri limits. The whole sub-tribe really recognise a simple petty Sheikh named Ahmed Moman who, at present, I am informed, is residing at Sha’ab, and upon the arrival of the Turkish Mudir at Mafalis it seems that certain of the Shujaifa have appealed to the Jurabi and the Mansuri Sheikhs to protect them against any undue exactions. 8 . I am informed that the number of Turkish troops in the vicinity is approximately 80 with two guns, but I am not in a position to vouch for the absolute accuracy of this statement. From the same source I am informed that, with the Jurabis and the Mansuri there are approximately 30l) Arabs, and a few petty Sheikhs such as the Sheikh of Doka, etc. 9 . I trust that no friction will now arise, and I will report again on the subject of the A1 Doka Customs House when I receive more information concerning it. 10. The Abdali Sultan is a fairly convenient intermediary in the affair. And if I sent a Political Officer to the spot to hold an independent enquiry it would be necessary to furnish him with a fairly strong escort, both as a set-off, vis-a-vis the Turks, and as a sedative to local Subaihi excitement.

We have heard that the Kotabees are troubling them by stealing from their fields and cattle and encroach upon their lands in an unlawful manner. They also precluded them from the bazars. Moreover, the Modir of Mafalis is keeping some soldiers at the post at Doka, who levy taxes from the Yusifyen and A’abus. We have now written this letter, and request that you will inform us of the name of the soldiers posted at Doka, their number, and of what tribe they belong to. Please also let us know what is the reason for precluding the people of Sha’ab from entering your markets, the cause of incursion, and plunder made by your people upon their cultivation and cattle and what is the reason which prevents your uncle and others, who unlawfully lay their hands on Wadi Sha’ab, from getting the matter settled by the Shari’a (Mahomedan law). Your reply with all the particulars asked for is requested. We send you this by a special messenger, and request your reply by his hand without fail. Please do not detain him, and salutation.

Oh ! father, we inform you that the Turkish troops are at Lahjar, in the company of Hasan Effendi, the Modir of Hifan. 'We received news from the Kobati and the Shujaifas, of threatening and alarming nature, to the effect that the Modir is swearing by the name of God that he shall not leave a stone upon a stone at Sha’ab undemolished. We asked about the reasons of this, and the offence which we have committed, and we have been told that Sheikh Abdul Kawi is speaking ill of the Turks, and condemning their acts, whereas he. on the other hand, speaks well of the British Government, their justice, clemency and good care they take of their subjects, and the protection they afford to those who place themselves under their protection, and he illustrates the Turks to the reverse of these qualifications. According to the story of the Kobatis and Sbujaifas, the Modir intends to put Sha’ab to destruction, and plunder the population, and that he states “ let the British Government be useful to Abdul Kawi and protect him.’ , Some people advise us to fly, and others tell us, to ward ourselves of this danger by inviting the Modir to our hospitality, and save our lives and children and property. We replied, we cannot give any decisive reply as we have an Akil. You may come to us immediately as we are much alarmed, anl do not sleep, but keep awake and count the stars in the sky on accouut of this fearful news reported to us by the people. Had not your son Abdul Latif been with us, you will not find us at Sha’ab, hut we are taking shelter under your son Abdul Latif against the many stories imported by the people.

We feel sure that these persons are alarming themselves unnecessarily, and that no such action as they write of, is likely to be committed by the officials of the Turkish Government, with which we are in friendly alliance, and. in conjunction with whom we have only recently demarcated the boundary between their territories and those under our protection. Please advise ei Abdul Kawi to warn his relations not to listen to idle tales told them by e Kobatis.In this connection, we would remind you oh friend, that we wrote to you jn August and October la*t about Sha’abi affairs and that in our No. 6295, dated 17th October 1905, we asked you to find for us, more in detail, what was really taking place at Al-Doka and the district of Sha’ab.

Under the above circumstance, oh friend, w 7 e have despatched two letters (copies attached for your information/ to some of the Akils of that country. As to your honour, we do not consider it befitting for you to communi cate with low and unworthy persons of Sha’ab.

We understood the above to the last. Be it not hidden from you that we are now in our place “ Uzlat ” (district) Mafalis. Two days ago, our Sublime Government’s (may God preserve it for ever) Modir of the district arrived here; we have not heard him mentioning Sha’ab at all, but he intends to go after No’man Ahmed the Shujaifi and his people, who are the subjects of the Great Sultan. These people inhabit “ TTzlat Ash-Shujaifa ” above mentioned. He (Modir) intends to recover the dues of Government. The Subaihis are now concentrating on the frontier with the intention of unnecessarily creating disturbance. It is advisable that some sensible men should be present, so that the limit of Sha’ab and the Shujaifis may be distinguished before any disturbance takes place, as before. The Subaihis intend to prevent the Modir from interfering with the Shujaifis, whereas the Modir is determined not to return or leave the place without orders from his superior officers.

We further learn that Sheikh Saleh bin Ahmed the Mansuri went up to the border of the limit of the Shujaifa with his force, and also Saeed Al Jurabi is at the border, in the Husn (fortlet) of Mafalis, in the place called Al Mowkib, near Sukal Joma’a.

After compliments .—We have, oh friend, received your letter, dated 22nd A1 Ki’da 1323 (17th January 1906) and its accompaniments, concerning the affairs of Sha’ab. From that we gather that recent rumours of Turkish encroachment there are really without foundation. From your further letter, dated the 28th A1 Ki’da 1323 (23rd January 1906), and its accompaniments, we gather that the Turkish authorities only desire to collect certain revenues from their own Shajaifa subjects, and that this measure has somewhat alarmed the Shajaifa, who are under our protection, and other Subaihi tribes in the vicinity. It would be well, oh friend, if you would write to the Akils of these tribes, and tell them to disperse, and not to be alarmed. They have only to address us in the event of any dues being improperly claimed from them, and they can depend upon our, in due course, protecting their interests, and effecting any restitution that may be rightful. As to Kayid No’man, he will, of course, be well advised to counsel the Mudir of the Turkish Government, to exercise the greatest care to avoid any sort of infringement of the rights decided by the recent Boundary Commission. We thank you for the information you have sent us in this matter. We should further be interested to hear from you whether the Turkish officials are now actually collecting any dues at A1 Doka.

Any how, oh friend, there is no reason for you to be alarmed or to keep forces, etc., on near the border. In the event of any dues being wrongfully demanded or ever recovered from any of the Shujaifa under our protection, you have only to refer the7 matter to us, and we will see that their interests are protected, and that restitu tion is made in due course if necessary. You should, therefore, oh friend, dismiss armed men to their homes and merely inform us of any wrongful claims which may be made. We do not think any will be made.

In continuation of my letter No 574 of 11th November last, I have the honour to state that the ingress of the Turks into Rubeaten was actually never made. It would have been more correct to have stated that seeing the proximity of Turks in Juban, and receiving from the Mudir of Rada 0 ’ an invitation to come to him, the Sheikhs of Rubeaten feared an invasion of their part and so addressed us asking how the Turkish note should be treated. The said Sheikhs have again written to me and enclosed two letters addressed to them from the Mudir of J uban (this time) and from his son in which they are asked to meet the Turks and make friendship. I have advised them in reply to assure their correspondents that Rubeaten is within the British sphere. The Sheikhs of Rubeaten detest Turkish rule and the Sheikhs of Juban likewise, and therefore, Government may rest assured that any incursion of Turkish intriguers would be unwelcome to the former, while the latter (of Juban) would submit only under strong protest, as they are aware that the tract is under the Kaza of Rada’.

Memorandum on the Af/ifi Border, with special reference to British interests at Sheikh Sa'id (vide Confidential portion of British Ambassador’s telegram to Mr. Fitzmaurice of April 11, 1904). ~ ; T| THE fact of the Juledi, Buremi, and Atifi territories comprising such a large area may at first sight appear strange. It is, however, the outcome of the nature of the country, and the same conditions are found in the case of other tribes in the Tiihama or partly desert tracts lying between the foot of the Yaman highlands and the sea. The extent of the country of the Mansuri (Subehi), Hakmi, Mashlahi, and Muwazi’a (three latter known among Arabs as “the Mokha tribes”), is out. of all proportion to the numbers of the tribesmen themselves. In the highlands, the tribes (e.g., Humar, Yusufiyin, &amp;c.) have much more restricted limits which are inhabited solely by tribesmen of one clan. As one descends to the low lands, the rainfall is less than on the mountains,* and comparatively large tracts of country support but a small population living near the patches of cultivation in widely separated valleys where there is a certain supply of water. The territory has from time immemorial belonged to the ruling family of Sheikhs (Juledi, Buremi, &amp;c.), while the majority of the inhabitants, whether settled or Bedouin, are strangers who have migrated to, and now reside on, the tribal territory as cultivators or tenants (Ar. Raya), paying dues to the family of the ruling Sheikhs. These inhabitants, unlike the more warlike tribesmen on the hills, are, or rather were, peacefully inclined and paid their taxes regularly to tfm ruling Sheikhs. It is only within recent years that the introduction of cheap modern fire-arms from Jibuti has led some of them to resist the authority of their Sheikhs and attempt to assert the position of separate and independent clans. 1 hese conditions obtained to greater degree in the territory of the Atifi and Hakmi, including the almost totally desert tracts close to the sea-board than to those of the Buremi and Juledi, which are more than 1,000 feet above sea-level and contain valleys with a certain amount of cultivation and population. -• -^| le extent of stretch of Atifi country from Barbar to Hajar Rakid, thence to vudam above Dubab, and along the sea-shore back to Ras Ara, contains no towns or vi luges in the ordinary sense of the word. The only approach to settled villages are the following:— An Xabia, consisting of one small house .and a few huts. Huneshia, consisting of two small houses. Dubab, consisting of some thirty mat huts inhabited bv fishermen. Ghurera, consisting of some twenty huts, Turba, consisting of some twenty huts. „ T ^ c 1 rest of ^ he country is desert and a certain amount of scrub, and inhabited by a ew e oums, who move about grazing their flocks within a certain distance of the wells or water holes- Many of these Bedouins, as also the people of Huneshia, have acquired or assumed the religious character of Sufis, which secures their immunity from axation or molestation during the time of intertribal warfare between the families and adherents of the ruling Sheikhs. Principal among these Sufis are the Bani Fattah • j § oe.tr che 1Y. Hurim and the country west and east of it between lines drawn inland from Ara. 3. Beu , . leaving Sanawi the Commission heard from natives that the Atifi border extended to the neighbourhood of HJzan, a statement that was confirmed bv the Atifi bheikh Sa id Ba Ah, when he visited the Commission at Kudera on the 11th April. V . a f i seemed to nave been impressed by evidences of Turkish power and perhaps •f’ 1 ?, 118 T/ '“Coce*. v-iiic ne was not without real or fancied grievances against the oritish. _ It apparently did not occur to him that the latter could assert or vindicate ^ubehi rights against the power of the 'Sultan of RoumY He stated that Sheikh 'l Wa \C i’ but !e a PPeared to be under the impression that the Sultan of Turkey’s rights m the place were superior to his own. i C ^-e ^ Xh--tpni I visited Puran to see the Buseli Sayids, with whom the tribes nad been in the habit of depositing their documents.* These Sayids have evidently oeen m constant communications with the Turks at Ras Turba, who had dealt with the f fvY 1? i °e 1 ' 0? en ' subjects. They seemed to be ignorant of any boundary ' P tlai 0i thc * T: ”in of Turkey, but when informed that that Sovereign admittedair in the Sub eh i as British and bad sent representatives to ascertain the true tribal limits th e two principal Sayids, Abdul Hadi and Abdul Aziz, declared that, tribally Sheikh Sa’id had belonged to the Atifi, and inquired whether the British wished, or were stron- enougn, to turn out the I urks and restore Sheikh Sa’id to the Atifi. They were informed in reply that, though Sheikh Sa’d might have tribally belonged to the Atifi the Turkish Government had “ acquired rights ” Ar. “ hukuk muktasaba” in the place/ which mio-ht be taken into consideration. ° The admission of these Muhammadan Sayids who, owing to their sacred character are more especially amenable to the religious influence of the Turkish Sultan as Khalifa of all Mussulmen, that Sheikh Sa’id was Atifi, seemed to bear considerable weight. 5. Afit* the Commission had reached Tvaraba, some miles east of J. ’Uzan which, we had been told, was on the border between the Buremi and Atifi, we sent for the Atifi Sheika, Said Ba An. ^ B&gt; tnis time he and other Arabs had seen the Commission proceed to Mudariba, i urbat-Abu-Asrar, &amp;c., which, though within Subehi limits, had for some years back been looked upon as Turkish, and they had begun to realize that delimitation was based on serious inquiry. His statements made on the occasion are recorded in diary entry ef the 8th May. At the time Sheikh Sa’id Ba Ali also remarked that the 60 dollars per month at first allotted him by the Turks, was in compensation for the dues the Atifi used to collect on the Mokha-Sheikh Sa’id road. He further added that, being a young man at the time of the Turkish occupation, he was not personally much connected with what actuallv took place, and that if the Com mission desired first-hand evidence, it would be well to see Muhammad Ali Fattahi, who . had been closely bound up with the history of Sheikh Sa’id. To our request that he would bring him to the Commission he replied that Muhammad Ali was very old, and could not travel far, while he was not very friendly to himself (Sheikh Sa’id Ba Ali). He promised to endeavour to mduce Muhammad Ali Fattahi to come to the Commission when it reached Barbar on its way to Ras Ara. In this he did not succeed, and it was only on my visit to TTzaf on the 2nd and 3rd June that I was able to get the old Sheikh to approach us. 6. His statements are given in Inclosure 1, and they agree substantially with those of the Atifi Sheikh, with whom he was not on very good terms. They differ as to the amount offered to the Atifi Sheikh to secure his ratification of the transaction with the French. Sheikh Sa’id Ba Ali gave the sum as 1,000 dollars in round figures, and implied that it came from the Hakmi Sheikh Ali Thabit Am Duren, between whom and the Atifi feud existed at the time. Muhammad Ali Fattahi was very precise as to the actual amount (550 dollars), and as to its having been counted out and handed to him by the “ Franks” and not by the Hakmi, though it was sent at the suggestion of the latter. The old men also implied that if he had been able at the time to convince the then Atifi Sheikhs that the Hakmi had nothing to do with sending the money, they would have accepted it. 7. Again, Sa’id Ba Ali, who had first declared that his predecessors had exercised jurisdiction up to the “ gate of Mokha,” when asked to give the precise point where the Atifi border struck the sea-shore, declared it was north of Dubab, which used to pay revenue to the Atifi, and near the mouth of the Wadi Am liaiki. Subsequent investi gation showed that the Wadi Am Haiki spreads out into several channels before it reaches the 'sea. Sheikh Muhammad Ali Fattahi said the boundary was at Kudam while again Sheikh Selim Ba Hadi (aged 60 years), of the Bani Fattah, on the 2nd June (he., the day before the arrival of Muhammad Ali Fattahi), declared that he knew the old Atifi border to run from Hajar Rakid to Kudam, where the boundary between the Atifi and Hakmi had been marked by a mound of stones and shells, close to where the Mokha-Sheikh Sa’id road crossed some low sand hills, Salim Ba Hadi declared that he was ready to give sworn testimony to these facts being within his knowledge. As men tioned in diary entry of the 3rd June, our Surveyor visited the point in company with a Hakmi man from Kadaha. The Hakmi man in question, named Sa’id Muhammad Akil, served formerly with the Egyptians at Berbera. He admitted that, in former times, before the arrival of the Turks, the Atifi levied dues from the people of Ghurera. The most salient points in Muhammad Ali Fattahi’s evidence, are his statements as to his having been the agent for the collection of revenue from Dubab, Ghurera, tvc., on behalf of the Atifi, while the Hakmi were not entitled to levy such dues, and as to what took place between the Atifi Sheikhs and Suliman Effendi, the first Turkish officer to visit Sheikh Sa’id. 8. On the 4th May, on proceeding to Karaba, I found there a well-known Hakmi Akil, named Ali Muhammad ’Uselu (aged about 76 years), who was at Karaba on business. V/hen questioned as to the border between the Atifi snd Hakmi, he showed reluctanceto speak on the subject, partly owing to his unwillingness to perhaps compromise his head Sheikhs the Am Durens, and partly on account of the blood feud existing between the Hakmi and Atifi. He stated, however, that tribal borders had not couiTted much of recent years (i.e., meaning that they had been merged in the would-be Turkish border), but that “the Atifi border was said to extend to Hajar Rakid.” This is an important admission from a Hakmi Akil, but, of course, his name should not be quoted to the Turkish authorities. 9. On the 13th May I visited Huneshia in company with the chief Turkish Com missioner. On interrogating a certain Abdu 'Ata, of the Bedouin section of Hurebi, he declared, in presence of the Turkish Commissioner, that the true Atifi border extended to Hajar Rakid and Kudam, though of recent years the Atifi Sheikhs had been unable to exercise their rights up to this line. He also stated that ’Usan was known as a point which, from ancient times, had separated Buremi from Atifi territory. Abdu ’Ata gave his evidence in the fearless straightforward manner of a Bedouin, and added that the fact of his having a quarrel with the Atifi had not deterred him from stating the truth as to their proper border. We then summoned two of the inhabitants of Huneshia, who stated that the place was within the tribal limits of the Atifi, but that its inhabitants, being Sufis, were exempted from paying the customary tribal dues; that the Turks, after occupying Sheikh Sa’id had considered Huneshia within the border of the “ Sultan ot Roum,” and its inhabitants were supposed to pay taxes to the Mokha authorities through the Muwazi ’A Sheikhs of Moza’. 10. C)n the 18th May Muhammad Ali Kushe’, Headman of the Makhaya clan residing m and around Am iNabia, stated that the latter place was within the tribal omits of the Atifi, who, however, had practically ceased to exercise jurisdiction there since the occupation of Sheikh Sa’id and Turba by by the Turks, and that he and his people were supposed to pay a nominal tax to the Turkish Sheikh of Moza’, though, as a matter or fact, they had always evaded such payments. 18th May Muhammad Salim, of the Jubehi clan, residin 0, between JNabia and Hunesbia, declared that the Atifi border ran from Hajar Rakid to Kudam a place near the sea some distance north of Dubab. q • ?“' same day the ^ Atifi Sheikh came, accompanied by six Buseli and other ayic s residing in the Wadi limnan. I hey declared that an old document, defining the boundanes of the Atifi and Buremi, had been deposited with them but had been mislaid. leie seemed reason to suspect that the document was really procurable, but that they could not sufficiently overcome their suspicions of the “Franks” to intrust it to us. iney were prepared, however, to give sworn testimony that its contents set forth the Atih boundary as exteneing to ’Uzan, Hajkr Rakid, and north of Dubab. thence to a place near the sea *3 Among some documents produced by them was the draft of a petition in ra uc, ut m urkish and not native handwriting, intended to be sealed and presented ^ Atifi and Buremi Sheikhs, to Jabir Effendi, the Turkish officer commanding at o e t-Y 1 ?; ^ the document of which a translation is hereto attached, m i--^ ^ eik l Sa ld 1 Ba Ah &gt; and the Buremi Sheikh Ali Abdalla, are made by the ui m i *n ei _to style themselves “Sheikhs of Bab-al-Mandab.” The document is f- V1 &lt;M *r- i C °rp CG V^ , 111 * de which prevailed in the Ottoman official circle from the time of the Turkish occupation of Lahej, till their evacuation of Jalila last year, i.e., of e ei ? 11 ?^. ll P i mme(: li a tc vicinity ot Aden as Turkish, thus ignoring P f ^ tU)man ride i n Taman.

I informed them that the A-hbari oTtL r s,Te of tim c” f *°, the Juledi ’ and —q-ntly must reml on the side ot the bubehi Canton,” and that we had informed the Juledi Sheikh and our Go\ eminent to that effect (vide Commission telegram $o. 35). The Turkish Com m.ssioners have doubtless reported to their Government on the whole matter and especially about our “ reservation of Subehi rights,” and it is not impossible that when we next discuss the question with them we may find that, under orders from head- quartei s, then attitude will nave become less accommodating. diffi Jdr Jrn?27 denCe g ‘T this Memorandum has been collected under somewhat d mcult circumstances resulting from the nature of the country and climate, it is almost entirely verbal, and, indeed, the inhabitants being in great part Bedouins, unable to read or write, documentary proofs are not so readily forthcoming as at Dthala, &amp;c. Sheikh Muhammad Ah Fattahi stated it as his conviction that the Buseli Sayids at Wadi limnan were m possession ot papers bearing on the Atifi connection with Sheikh caid, but that the Sayids were perhaps reluctant to produce them owing to their fears ot the documents being made away with. It was decided to send Shaikh Husen Salih Azraki to Wadi Tinman to make a further attempt to obtain this written evidence Being an Arab, he is more likely to gain the confidence of the Sayids and obtain access to the documents it they exist. He returns on Monday the 6th, and should he brim- back any papers ol importance they will be forwarded without delay. (Signed) G. H. FIT Z M A lj It ICE, . Joint Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission. Penm, June 4, 1904. Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Statements of Sheikh Muhammad Ali Fattahi, taken at ’Uzaf, at the mouth of the Wadi Hurim on June 3, 1904, by Mr. Fitzmaurice, in the presence of Mr. Mahomed Ali and Sheikh Husen Salih Azraki, both officials of the Aden Residency. . MUHAMMAD ALI FATTAHI began by stating that he had property rights in the neighbourhood of Ara, which had been interfered with by the Atifi, and that, though the Atifi Sheikh had lour times sent messages to him inviting him to visit the British, he had declined to come ; that he and his peoole, being Sufis, were exempted from dues, and that he had been as tar as San’a, where the Ottoman Governor-General had confirmed his exemption on behalf of the “ Sultan of Bourn.” it was impressed on the Fattahi Sheikh that the British Government did not interfere in tribal matters, and that Government bu sin ess, unlike tribal affairs, was based on truth and accuracy, and that it was hoped that his evidence would run on these lines. The following is the substance of his state ments, checked and certified by Mr. Mahomed Ali and Sheikh Husen Salih :— Muhammad Ali Fattahi, Sheikh of the Bani Fattah, living in and around Wadi Hurim, declared that he was about 80 years of age ; that he was a young man when the British took Aden (1S39) ; that he remembered the continuous fighting between them and the Fadthli and Abdali; and that he was acquainted with three predecessors of the present Atifi Sheikh Sa id Ba Ali, viz., Yahiya Ba Abdalla, Ali Ba Yahiya, and Ali Ba Ali, who was Head Sheikh for only eight days. He stated that during the time of his ancestors (apparently going back close on 200 years) the intertribal Atifi border was said to be ’Uzan, Hajar Rakid, and Kudarn, the latter point between the Atifi and Hakmi; that all within this line, including Bedouins and the settled inhabitants of Ghurera (Sheikh Sa’id), known as the Ma’aiba sub-section, and the people of Dubab, had paid dues to the Atifi Chiefs, who exercised jurisdiction over them ; that he himself (Muhammad Ali Fattahi) had acted as collector of these dues from the people of Ghurera, Dubab, &amp;c., and remitted them to the Atifi ; that he had also collected tolls on the Mokha Road at Kudam on behalf of the Atifi, and customs on “ ka’s,” an insect used in the cultivation of date ualms; that many years aero, as the [2049 o-l] ‘ ‘ v C6 result of an internecine feud among the Hakmi, two of them had taken refuge with the Atifi, who refused to surrender them on the demand of the Hakmi; that thereupon the latter, with allies, had invader! Atifi territory, defeated and killed a number of the Atifi : that this intertribal war, combined with family feuds, had diminished the numbers of, and weakened the power of, the Atifi, but that notwithstanding, the inhabitants of Ghurera, Dubab, &amp;c.. bad continued to pay dues to the Atifi until some years after the Turkish occupation of Sheikh Sa’id. To the question whether the inhabitants of Ghurera. Dubab, &amp;c., had ever paid dues to the Hakmi, Muhammad Ali Fattahi replied ‘ e certainly not,” as the Hakmi were not tribaliv entitled to such. When asked what would happen tribally were the occupation of Sheikh Sa’id bv the Turks to cease, he replied that the Ma-aiba of Ghurera, Dubab, &amp;c., would resume their old pavmeots to the Atifi. When asked what passed between the Hakmi and the French on the first arrival of the latter, Muhammad Ali Fattahi said that, as he was a very old man nearing his end, he preferred to give evidence only concerning matters of which he has had personal cognixance, but he could not vouch for any hearsay statements, and that the Hakmi would be the proper people to speak on the subject of their relations with the French • that his personal connection with what took place then was limited to the following 'That the French sent for him ; that he found them camped near Ghurera; that thev intrusted him with 550 Maria Theresa dollars to take to the Atifi, in order to induce them to ratify the French occupation, and undertake not to molest the French ; that he took the money to the Atifi Chiefs, who were then at A1 Kadthi, north-east of Am Fajra, but that the Atifi Sheikh, Salih BaHajih, declined to accept the money or recognize the dealings of the Hakmi with the French, whereupon he (Muhammad Ali Fattahi) returned the money to the French; that shortly afterwards a Turkish officer, named Suliman Effendi, with some men, arrived from Mokha, and sent for the Atifi and Buremi Sheikhs; thafffie dismissed the latter with presents and robes, while with the Atifi he had closer dealings; that he informed the Atifi that the ^Sultan of Roum ” did not wish to deprive them of their rights, which they should continue to enjoy, but that he washed them not to interfere in any way with the hills immediately around Sheikh Sa’id until a Government decision was come to as to whether it belonged to the Dawlat Sham (Turkish Govern- ment) or the Dowlat-al-Yaman (British), though they could continue, as heretofore, to exercise theii rights in the surrounding country; that Suliman Effendi’s promises and engagements with the Atifi were respected for some years, and that the latter continued to exerc.se their jurisdiction as of old, until the arrival of an officer named Jabir Effendi (about 1885), who regularly took over Sheikh Sa’id and built the present fort at lurba. r c, ^ as ^ed why the Hakmi dealt with the French concerning a place like Sheikh Said where they had no rights, Muhammad Ali Fattahi said that his impression was that Hakmi had merely deceived the French to get money from them.

Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Colonel Wahab to Government of India. (Secret.) Aden Boundary Commission Camp, Perim, Sir, June 10, 1904, BEFORE giving up my post as His Majesty’s Commissioner, I have the honour to bring to the notice of the Government of India the services of the undermentioned officers, who have been connected with the Commission during the last two and a-half years:— 2. Lieutenant-Colonel Abud, Indian Army, was a member of the Commission from January 1902 to June 1902. His previous experience in Aden and his knowledge of Arabic proved of great value at the commencement of our work. The collection and sifting of the documentary evidence as to rights and boundaries of the Amir of Dala, of the existence of which nothing was previously known, was greatly oue to his skilful and patient investigation, and I trust that his services will not be overlooked. 3. The Government of India are already aware of the distinguished services rendered by Mr. G. H. Fitzmaurice, who has been His Majesty’s Commissioner jointly with myself since his arrival in October 1902. He was appointed on account of his special knowledge of Turkish affairs and his great experience in dealing with Turkish officials. His services in this direction have been invaluable, but his insight into native character has been equally valuable in dealing with the Arabs; and it is no exaggeration to say, that probably no other officer has ever obtained the same knowledge of the tribes on the Aden boundary, or been able to exercise a more useful influence on the Arab mind; and whatever success the Commission has met with, in bringing about the withdrawal of the Turks from Jalila, and in carrying on the delimitation, and in overcoming Turkish opposition to the survey of the border districts, from the Bana to Sheikh Sa’id and Mokha, is largely due to his unwearying labour and devotion to the w 7 ork in hand, often under trying circumstances. 4. Major J. K. Tod was for a year and a-half attached to the Commission as Intelligence Officer, and for a year of this time as Assistant Commissioner. He worked most assiduously and was of great assistance to me at all times, both in obtaining military and political intelligence, and in taking charge of much of the laborious routine duties of the office. On his proceeding on sick leave, Captain E. A. F. Redl took over the duties of Intelligence Branch Officer, and though not formally appointed Assistant Commissioner, he continued to carry on the office and accounts duties (sometimes very heavy) as well as the Intelligence work, for which his excellent knowledge of Arabic well fitted him. He was specially employed for some wmeks with the troops under General Maitland in the Kotaibi Hills, and whatever work he has had to do has been carried out with energy and ability.— 8 5. Lieutenant M. O’C. Tandy, R.E., was in charge of the survey throughout and assisted by native Surveyors Lai Singh Muhammad Latif, and Ahmad Husen, has rendered valuable service. The conditions under which the Commission worked, and the jealous opposition on the part of the Turkish officials to any survey beyond that absolutely necessary for the boundary delimitation, prevented any great extension of survey beyond the border; a good deal has, however, been done to extend our knowledge of Arabia and Lieutenant Tandy and his assistants deserve much credit for the preparation of the maps and for their reproduction in the field in a way that has not, I think, been previously attempted. ^ b. Owing to the length of time the Commission was in the field, several changes took place in the post of Commandant of the escort. I would especially wish to bring to notice the services of Major W. S. Delamain, who held the appointment from September to May 1904, during which time the Commission marched along the border from Kataba to the coast, and who was responsible for the military precautions necessary for the protection of the Commission. The work devolving on the escort was at times very arduous, including long days on escort with survey parties in a very difficult mountainous country, and during the last two months, particularly, marching through hot desert tracts, under held service conditions though without its incencives. 7. I cannot speak too highly of the services of Captain Thompson and Lieutenant It. M. Carter, Indian Medical Service, who were in medical charge of the Commission, the former from January 1902 to March 1903, and the latter from then until May 1904. In addition to their regular duties, both these officers undertook a great deal of medical and surgical work among the Arabs, and their skill and success in dealing with these patients undoubtedly helped to gain the confidence of the people and assure them of our goodwill towards them.

The Atifi Border, with special reference to British interests at Sheikh Said (vide Memorandum attached to Colonel Wahab's of June 4, 1904). I HE result of the endeavour, alluded to in paragraph 15 of my Memorandum of the 4th June, to tiacc documental y prooi of the Atifi claims is shown in the accompanying translations of two documents. Facsimiles of both, with copies in Arabic, are being sent to His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, to lie shown, if necessary, to the Sublime Porte. 2. One is the original of a letter bearing the seal of Suleman Nuri, styled the KaimaLam of Mokha, and dated 1287 a.h., or 1870—71 a.d., and addressed to Sheikh Muhammad Ali Fattahi, whose verbal statements have been forwarded with my Memo randum of the 4th June. 3. 1 he previous negotiations with the Subehi (i.e., Atifi), referred to in t he letter are doubtless those mentioned on p. 3 of the Fattahi Sheikh’s statement. That they had not been quite definite and satisfactory can be gleaned from the promises of reward and veiled threats which Muhammad Ali Fattahi is ordered io convey to them. The “ tashkilat ” alluded to is the formation of administrative districts, and in the present instance refers to the incorporation of Bab-al-Mandab within the Caza of Mokha. A certain Ali EfFendi was the civil officer said to be on his way to Sheikh Sa’id. The tone of the letter clearly points to the writer’s conviction that the Subehi (i.e., Atifi) had rights in Bab-al-Mandab. 4. The second document is fairly old. The date has been smudged, but the allusion to the Amil of Mokha, or officer appointed by the Imam of San’a, shows it to be at least pre-Turkish. It is a covenant between the Atifi and the Hakmi, drawn up before the Chief Buseli Sayid, then and now the most influential religious authority in these parts. It is quite explicit as to the Atifi border being Kudam and Dumat-ad-Duren, up to the road to Ad-Dabulia. Kudam is shown on the sketcli map sent with the Commission’s letter of the 4th June, while Dumat-ad-Duren was stated by a Hakmi, in the presence of the Second i urkish Commissioner and myself, to be a Dom palm about midway between Kadaha and Moza. The same Hakmi informed us that the road of Ad-Dabulia passed close to the place called Dhobane on the War Office map. It may be of interest to recall that, according to one of the old Amiri documents, the former Amirs of Dthala were entitled, in addition to their dues from Taiz, to 2-J per cent. ad valorem duties on the Taiz-Mokha road. This would seem to link up the old rights of the Amirs with those of the Subehi. 5. I showed the document to the Turkish Commissioner, and had it translated word for word in his presence, as it is written iii dialect. He saw no reason to doubt its authenticity, and looked upon it as a convincing proof as to the former Hakmi-Atifi border before the old status was upset by the events of the last thirty odd years.

COVENAN T and agreement have been entered into, and hostilities and feud have ceased, between the Atifi and Hakmi; the Atifi being represented by Yehia Abdalla, Abdalla-bin-Khadthir, and Sa’id-bin-Salih, and the Hakmi by Thabit Ad-Duren, Abdalla Ad-Duren, and Abdalla Awadth. The conditions agreed upon between them were that if a “ ra’awi ” (subject) entered the Hakmi territory, he should either pay the dues or be amenable to their customs and usages. The limits of the Atifi territory are Al-Kudam and Domat-ad Duren, as far as the road of Ad-Dabuliya. The conditions between them were that if the customary dues payable on the road of Mokha are paid by the Amil ” (be., representative of the Imam of San’a), well and good; otherwise, the Atifi shall lew their tolls on the road, while the Hakmi shall not attempt to hinder them from doing so. [2049 o—l] D10 Should a misunderstanding (entailing bloodshed) occur between the tribesmen, then, according to the covenant of God, the matter shall be decided on the principle of a head for a head, and compensation for wounds. Should a Hakmi be present at a fight, he shall endeavour to bring about a settlement' or, in case of dispute, he shall try to effect a reconciliation. Should he fail, he shall either espouse the cause of the conciliatory party or hold aloof. Should an ignorant person commit a wrongful deed, he shall remonstrate with him. This is the covenant of God : “The hand of God shall be above theirs, and God is responsible for them until Fie shall inherit the earth and all there is on it, and He is the best inheritor.” (From the Koran).

(Translation from tlie Arabic.) (After compliments.) WE learnt from the letters of the Hakmi Sheikh Hasan Razif from time to time of your having spoken to him about the case of the Subehi. As there has been no binding arrangement entered into between the said tribe (Subehi) and us, we feel obliged to write this to you. On receipt of it you should come to meet the said Sheikh Flasan and come to an understanding with him. At the time of writing this a messenger has come from Hodeida with several letters from his Excellency the Mutessarif and other high officials, in which they write that seven steamers with Government troops have arrived, one of the steamers having been set apart for the conveyance of guns and military stores. It is probable that some of the troops will go to Rab-al-Mandab, and we shall accompany them. If we find you and the Subehi tribe friendly you shall be richly rewarded. You must not be remiss in using your best endeavours on the lines upon which we have written you. Please take note of this. Dated 14 L., 1287 a.h. (1870-71 a.d.) (Seal of Suleman Nuri.) P S. A ou know what has passed between the Subehi and us in your presence to the effect that they should not interfere with the troops at Bab-al-Mandab as long as they are there, nor with the Hakmi. Now the troops of Government are stationed there, and the officer appointed for the “ tashkilat ” is on his way ; so if the aforesaid (Subehi) Keep to their engagement they shall be rewarded handsomely.

Sir, WITH reference to ^ ^ heiewith copy of survey of the sheikh Said hills on the scale of 400 tTo* The declared that owing to the objections of the Turba Military authorities it was impossibl for them, without an Imperial Trade, to allow our surveyor to visit the tops of Turba Hill Aden Boundary Commission Camp, Perim. June 10, 1904. your telegram of the 26th May, 1 have the honour to forwan □t the Sheikh Said hills on the scale of -rTr-Fn-Tr. The Turkor J. Manhali, as both places were within the military zone of the Turba forts and position. A portion in consequence remained unsurveyed, but is shown on the large scale naval chart. Since writing the above, Mr. Fitzmaurice has succeeded in getting the unsurveyed portion completed. Under the rather transparent pretext of ascertaining whether the point called Sheikh Malu is an island or not, he induced the Turkish Commissioners to accompany him there, taking a native surveyor with him. The incident considerably perturbed the Sheikh Said garrison, but the work was completed before they made up their minds to stop it. The results can only appear on the tinal map. 2 . The map shows the hills on the Sheikh Said Peninsula. They are the hills with which Suleman Nuri, the first Turkish officer to visit the place, intimated to the Atifi Sheikhs they were not to interfere {vide p. 3 of statement of Sheikh Muhammad Ali Fattahi attached to Mr. Fitzmaurice’s Memorandum, forwarded in my despatch of the 4th June). The country beyond these hills up to J. Kahbub to Mokha on the north, and to Wadi Timnan on the east, is bare open desert, inhabited only by a few Bedouins. It appears that the Turks did not at first object to the Atifi exercising jurisdiction in this open country near Sheikh Said. 3. In the Foreign Secretary’s telegram of the 16th November, 1901, to the Government of Bombay, it was laid down that the boundary should leave the coast at the western limit of the Atifi country near Turba,” while the Resident, in the Memorandum transmitted to you in his despatch of the 14th January, 1904, stated that the boundary would appear to strike the sea-shore at some spot between the hamlet of Turba and the Turkish fort of that name. (Vide paragraph 9 of Commission’s despatch of the 26th April, 1904.) 4. As reported in our despatch of the 25th May, we found the hamlet of Turba to be immediately under the Turkish fort at Turba, and suggested that the boundary should be drawn at J. Kuwah, or Kawahi, i.e., the low range of hills about a mile east of Turba. N.B.—By a clerical error Kawahi is stated in paragraph 2 of my despatch of the 4th June to be a mile west, instead of east, of Turba. 5. The substance of our conversation on the subject with the Turkish Commissioners on the 11th May is given in the diary entry for that day. On the 24th May we visited them at the fort of Turba. The fort is built on the headland immediately to the west of the hamlet. The headland, or Ras Turba, is called Warner’s Point on the Naval Chart. In discussing the question as to where the line should reach the sea, we explained to them that His Majesty’s Government had raised no objection when they occupied the point of Sheikh Said, nor when subsequently they came south from Sheikh Said and erected forts at Turba inside the Strait of Bab-al-Mandab, which, after their occupation of Sheikh Said, had been looked upon as tbe British boundary ; that our Government now considered the line to run between the hamlet and tbe fort; that as they were practically one and the same place, we thought of suggest ing to our Government taking the boundary to Kuwah, but that we could say nothing definite on the subject without consulting Government. 6 . The Turkish Commissioners remarked that the line ought to pass east^ ot J. Kuwah, which was within the military zone of the Turba fort, as a hostile party landing east of Kuwah might turn the position. To this we replied that such considerations were scarcely consonan! with the very cordial relations that had ahvays subsisted between the two friendly Powers, that the British had not objected to their building a fort which in a way commanded Perim, and that as the territory to the east of J. Kuwah w^as British, there could be no possibility of hostile action from that direction. 7. On the 7th June the Turkish Commissioners made a further appeal to Mr. Intz- maurice about including the comparatively good water supply of the well of Sukaiya within Ottoman limits, remarking that the waiter of the w 7 ells near the hamlet ot 1 urba was quite brackish and fit only for animals, except immediately after rain, wdiich Sails but rarely in these parts. Mr. Fitzmaurice told them there would be no difficulty in their getting water from Bir Sukaiya through the natives, as they got distilled water from Perim, and it seems doubtful w’bet her they are entitled to much consideration in the matter. The letters of their officials addressed to Arab Sheikhs show that they were cognizant of Subehi, ke., British rights in Sheikh Said, and the rather cavalier fashion in which they ignored those rights by constructing the fort at Turba could scarcely be a valid reason for extending their sphere further east. They can always obtain drinking water from Sukaiya through the natives, but the power of cutting them off from this12 supply might be useful in certain conceivable contingencies. The above is based on the supposition that His Majesty’s Government contemplates no alteration in the present status at Sheikh Said. 8 . It may be added that the French Settlement was near Ras Sheikh Said, and on the hill where the telegraph station is shown on the large scale map of the peninsula. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) R. A.

THE boundary map, sent with letter of the instant, shows that portion of the Haushabi border from J. Mimtar to Ras Namis. I have the honour further to inclose a blue print* on the ^-inch scale showing the remainder of the Haushabi border as demarcated with the Turks. The finished map will follow as soon as it can be completed. * This was sent to the Foreign OfiSce for reproduction, March 30, 1904. [1861 hh —1] C C 2 44 ! i I I6 2. The Haushabi border may be divided by natural features and tribally into two sections: (1) from J. Mimtar, where the Amiri boundary ends, to Basesa, on the Amama lange, thence across the Ad-Dareja Valley to Ras Narnis, just under Jalisa, on the spur of Jabal Jarban ; and (2) from Ras Namis across the comparatively open ground to a point, rJ on the south-east slopes of J- Nabi Shaib, called J. Muharraka, where, according to the Haushabi contention, their border ends and the Subaihi border begins. 3 . From J. Mimtar to Ras Namis the inhabitants on the British side are pure Haushabi, while from Ras Namis to J. Muharraka they belong to the Haushabi sub-tribe of ’Amri, who, though originally tribally distinct from the Haushabi, have for a long time back been merged in the latter, and acknowledged the jurisdiction of their Sultan, paving him the tithes and other dues. On the Turkish side of the Haushabi border are the tribe of (1) Humar, from J. Mimtar to the Wadi Warazan and included administratively in the canton of Kama’ira; (2) the tribe of Badu, from the Wadi Warazan to Dar Wetid and S. Lassab; (3) the tribe of Yusufiyin from S. Lassab to Nijd Barn, or the col between J. Kurra and J. Nabi Shaib; and (4) the tribe of Kubati, whose territory extends from Nijd Bam to J. Muharraka and thence along the Subaihi border to A1 Ja’ama in the Wadi Sihr. 4 . The actual interference of the Turks, or the tribes under their influence, along the ’Amri portion of the Haushabi border have been, relatively speaking, insignificant, and it is in the valley north of Ad-Dareja that Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, during recent years and subsequent to his appointment by Hussein Hilmi Pasha (ex-Wali of Yaman and now Chief Inspector of Reforms in European Turkey) as Mudir of the nahia, or canton, of Kama’ira, began the series of encroachments that led up to the incident of July 1901, and, in fact, to the present work of demarcation. 5 . Muhammad Nasir Mukbil had pushed the Turkish border well down into the Wadi Fakir and to the village of Ad-Dareja, while, as appears from the Commission diary of the 21st December, the territory claimed by him extended to the junction of the Wadi Ziyak and the Wadi Warazan. Certain Turkish claims at Kudash, the building ot the tower at Nijd Musamma, the fact that Turkish access to the Yusufiyin and Kubati country lay through the Wadi Hawemi and Wadi Hidaba in ’Amri territory, a route which has been actually used by Turkish troops in the past, the evidently inspired claim to the Juhaili country and the Madraja Pass from Haushabi into Subaihi territory {y\de Commission diary entries of the 2nd February and the 3rd February), combined with certain verbal statements of the natives, pointed to the existence of the intention ot Muhammad Nasir Mukbil to gradually absorb the ’Amri portion of Haushabi territory, comprised within a line drawn from the junction of the Wadis Ziyak and Warazan to Minjara and from Muharraka along the now recognized Haushabi boundary to Ras Namis. The Ad-Dareja incident thwarted this plan ; but if the Turks had been successful in absorbing the ’Amri country they would, no doubt, have claimed it on the ground that the ’Amri were distinct from the Haushabi. Undoubtedly the present Haushabi Sultan’s regime, commented on in the Commissioner’s diary of the 17th, 22nd, and 28th January, and the 17th February, 1904, was not of a nature to win the sympathy of his subjects and counteract Turkish designs, while their Agent, Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, took full advantage of such state of things. 6 . His policy was to use intrigue, threats, and force to compel the people to accept “the sway of the Khalifa Abdul Hamid,” and he secerns to have met with a certain success, as is clear from the translations of documents attached to this Report. The latter shows that some time back the authority of the Haushabi Sultans extended up to the crest of the Amama and Jarban range, immediately south of the village of Mavia. This fact is also borne out by the investigations on the spot between 1877 and 1880 of the Italian explorer, Manzoni, who, from information compiled from Turkish sources, showed the Turkish boundary as passing just south of Mavia. {Vide Map of Yaman, published in 1885 by the “Institute Cartografico Italiano,” Rome; as also Map B, accompanying Commission’s letter of the 25th May, 1903.) 7. On the arrival of the Commission at Ad-Dareja, on the 25th December last, the villagers on the south of the Amama-Jarban range began to evidence a desire to be included in the British Protectorate, basing their claim on their old tributary relations to the Haushabi Sultans. They seemed, however, to be actuated more by the wish to escape from Turkish rule than to come under that of the present Haushabi Sultan. They number in all about 1,000 souls, and fall under the grouping of the Wajihi villagers, inhabiting the southern slopes of J. Amama as far as Shabwa, and the Shamera, Hanba (tribally known as Shijri) and Daba villagers on the south-eastern slopes ot J. Jarban. Though formerly closely allied to the Haushabi, they are tribally distinct fromthe latter, and seem to have been originally related to the Humar, under Turkish jurisdiction. Their inclusion within the British sphere would have given a more natural boundary than that demarcated by the Commission, and it was with a view to such a contingency that in paragraph 68 of the Amiri Report, of the 25th May. 1903, it was suggested keeping open the Amir’s claims to Humar, as “it is to be foreseen that any minor rectifications of that (Haushabi) border which may be found necessary at the moment of actual delimitation there, would be rendered impossible if the Amiri rights to Humar are now definitely ceded to Turkey.” This suggestion did not at the time recommend itself to the consideration of Govern ment, but should the Turkish Government create obstacles to the final rectification of the boundary as delimited by the Commission, or renew their obstructive methods by raising inadmissible claims along the Subaihi border, specially in the neighbourhood of Ras Turba, His Majesty’s Government may deem it expedient, in the final settlement of the frontier, to demand a rectification of this portion of the Haushabi border and make the line run along the natural feature of the Amama-Jarban range. 8. Our negotiations with the Turkish Commissioners respecting the border between Basesa and Ras Namis and the settlement made with them on the spot, were governed by two considerations, viz., the express wish of Government that “ delimitation to the sea should be completed this cold weather,” thus rendering any hut minor references to Constantinople impossible; and secondly, that the basis of the present demarcation, as proposed by the Turkish and agreed to by our Government, was the status of the autumn of 1901. Though this principle was departed from in the cases of Jalela, the recognition of Yafa-as-Soufal as British, and the Trade of the 13th February, 1903, authorizing the demarcation of a border from Lakamat-ash-Shuh to the desert, it was reaffirmed by the Resident in his letter of the 30th May, 1903. In the absence of any specific instructions from Government on the subject, we consequently felt bound to adhere to the principle as far as possible, and avoid any claims involving serious deviation from it. 9. The case of Shabwa was to a certain extent an exception. This shrine, with i s lands containing the only abundant supply of water south of J. Amama, has for several years back been looked upon as Turkish. The claims of the Haushabi Sultan, commu nicated to the # Commission in the Residency’s letter of the 23rd September, 1*902, including Shabwa, while statiug that Daba and Hanba wrnre Turkish. The revival by the local authorities of the old claims to Ad-Dareja was most embarras sing to the Turkish Commissioners, who could not, however, officially surrender them without reference to Constantinople, while it seemed that the Sublime Porte would also be con siderably embarrassed by claims that had led to fighting between British and iurkish troops. We consequently claimed Shabwa, and thus compelled the Turks to include it in their reference, with the result, as anticipated, that the Turkish Government hurriedly instructed their Commissioners not to press the claims to Ad-Dareja, &amp;c. It then became a question of delimiting the boundary between the lands of Shabwa and the Wajihi, i.e., from Ras Aseka to Maharib, and north of Aresrna to Tawal and Wakadiya, including on the British side the perennial streams in W. Mileh and the Karkahan nullah. 10. The Haushabi Sultan having stated that Daha was Turkish, it became our duty^ to demarcate on the basis of its just limits. Like Shabwa it is a shrine with wakf lands, situated in the Wadi Ziyak. The Turkish claim, as set forth in our diary entry^ ot the 21st December, 1903, extended dowu to the Wadi Warazan, but, on making inquiries, we found that a great portion of these lands really belonged to the Syeds ot Dthubiyat, in Amiri territory. We sent for the latter, and demarcated on the basis of their limits, as detailed in their documents, drawing the houndary-line of Asat Am Shari, wheie # th e Wadi Jihal (belonging to Daha) becomes the Wadi Ziyak, thus again leaving in British territory the perennial stream in the bed of the Wadi below Jihal. It seemed necessary to go into these details to explain the reason of the shaip re-entry of the frontier-line between Wakadiya and Ras Namis, while the Haushabi Sultan has shown a certain dissatisfaction with the settlement of the section of his boundary between Basesa and Ras Namis. In spite of his stutements to the Residency, recorded in its letter of the 23rd September, 1902, to the Commission, he evidently expected to get the crest of the Amama-Jarban range as his boundary, and seemed to think that Government had done less for him than for the Amir ot Dthali. 11. As a matter of fact, the demarcation of this portion of his border, though it does not give a natural boundary (vide paragraph 5) is more satisfactory than could have been expected. The Intelligence Officer attached to the Field Force in July 1901,^ together with the Political Officer, went into the question of the boundary above Kafuf8 and Ad-Dareja. The results of this investigation are given on his sketch map of the vicinity of Ad-Dareja, upon which the frontier is shown as crossing the crest of a hill about 1,000 yards west of the tower built by Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, and some 2 miles south of Shabwa, the latter being marked “ Turkish.” The letter in question further states :— “ Opinions even among the Haushabi themselves differ as to whether a boundarv-line runs along the high crest line of this hill, or, lower down, about 800 yards further north along the line of she Karkahan nullah. Arguing from previous grounds it would seem that the line does run along the high crest, and if this is the case, the advantage lies wholly with the Humar and Turks, who from this high vantaee ground wholly command all the approaches from Ad-Dareja and the line of the W. Ziyak; having good sloping ground in their own rear to hide their own dispositions. If, on the other hand, the- boundary be pushed dowm to the other side of the hill, without interfering in any way with the fields at the foot (which appear without diapute to belong to the Humar), the advantage would rest entirely with the Haushabi (or British) force, who would command the whole valley and approaches from Mavia, having in their own immediate front an almost perfect glacis-like slope As a matter of fact the Humar at present own this crest line, &amp;c.)” The boundary-line now drawn by Masjid Arabi more than redresses the tactical dis advantage commented on in this Report of the Intelligence Officer. 12. The Haushabi boundary from Ras Namis to Nijd Musamma is quite satis factory, no ground that the ’Amri claim having been left on the Turkish side. The four villages of Tarian, Kudash, Harda, and Wubid were on the list of Turkish’’ villages which the Turkish Commissioners were supposed to claim, but, as mentioned in our diary entry of the 15th January, all four were included in Haushabi territory. 13. From the junction of the W. Soudan with the Warazan no serious difficulties were encountered up to Nijd Musamma, where the tower of Nasir Harbi (vide Com mission diary of the ^ 22nd, 28th, and 29th January, 1904) necessitated a reference to Constantinople. The instructions mentioned in the Ambassador’s telegram of the 3rd March have not been adequate for the Turkish Commissioner, who has to-day again telegraphed for orders on the subject.

[March 31.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 1. Colonel Wahab to Government of India.—(Communicated by India Office, March 31, 1904.) Sir, Aden Boundary Commission Camp, Sanawi, March 15, 1904. IN forwarding copies of the jointly-signed maps of the entire Amiri border and part of the Haushabi border, with a detailed description of the same, I feel that no apology is required for sending them so late. The difficulty of making, in the field and without proper appliances, the six cop : es for the six Departments of Government with which we communicate, and additional ones for our Turkish colleagues, is considerable. Making arrangements for survey of such a nature as to insure the safety of our surveyors, keeping up relations with the border Arabs with view to ascertaining the truth as to the boundary, and carrying on negotiations with the Turks, account for most of our time. Remaining for any length of time in one place in order to bring our mapping up to date is incompatible with our endeavour to finish the south-western delimitation to the sea in what remains of a cool season, and to shorten the stay of our escort and the troops supporting the Commission in the low-lying portions of the Subaihi Tihama. 2. So many sections of the Amiri boundary have already formed a subject of official correspondence that there seems no necessity for now entering into detailed comments on that portion of the frontier. The eastern section of the Amiri border begins at Raid Khatm, but, strictly speaking, at Ras Nakil Adana. The villages of Habil Jalb and Kuren are tribally Shaibi by origin, but have practically thrown in their lot with the Amir. As vri 11 he noticed, the section in the vicinity of Kataba has been marked out by a large number of ma^ary pillars, in accordance with the instructions in paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s Confidential letter of the 17th June, 1903. The Dakkam portion of the border is also marked by pillars up to the slopes of J. Hesha, where it follows prominent natural features. From J. Rima to the Ilaushabi border the line follows the watershed aiong high points most difficult of access, and crosses the Wadis Haura and Tusan at well-marked points. 3. The line actually demarcated in the immediate vicinity of Kataba differs somewhat from that suggested in paragraph 72 of our Amiri Report of the 25th May, 1903, and from the description given in the Memorandum presented to the Porte in September last. In accordance with the second paragraph of the Memorandum on Ukla presented to the Porte, the lower part of W. Reshan was left to the Turks, the line being taken to J. Jarrad and Habil Zireh, thus securing to the Amir the Well of Zireh, which contains the best drinking-water in or near Kataba. 4. Our Diary entries of the 4th, 6th, and 10th October referred to some patches of cultivation in the upper reaches of Selat Hafasa in dispute between the people of Dakkam and Hasha, and as our boundary is a tribal one, which Government wishes should be as free as possible from sources of dispute, we thought best to endeavour to include within Dakkam limits some 8 square miles of territory beyond the green line on Map C, attached to our Report of the 25th May, 1903. The Turkish Commissioners, having received an Irade to delimit “to a point 1 kilom. west of the Tiban and due south of Hefa,” at first felt bound, without a fresh reference, to Constantinople, to decline leaving the 8 square miles in question to the Dakkam, the point on the map 1 kilom. west of the Tiban being situated within this area. When, however, we showed a disposition not to insist on drawing the line close up to the houses of Kataba, and explained to them that boundary point No. XLIV, south of W. Tusan, was less than 1^ kilom. distant from the Tiban, they ultimately agreed to the inclusion of the 8 square miles within the Dakkam border, thus taking the frontier-line up by the head of the S. Hafasa and on to the lofty peak of J. Rima. This constitutes a rectification, without departing from the tribal basis, of the western Dakkam border on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s letter of the 17th June, 1903. We, on our part, agreed to leave them the patch of cultivation—entirely the property of the people of Kataba—lying between Kataba, J. Jarrad, and Habil Badr. 5. The description of the Amiri border presented to and accepted by the Porte, with the alteration commented on in our diary of the 18th February, 1904, makes the line [1861 M—1] Bpass from A1 Aslum to the junction of the Selat Humar with the Seiat Kataba, and then follow the latter to the north of Lakmat-ad-Duki. Taking the line down the S. Kataba, which is a broad depression almost entirely under cultivation and contains the site of the village of Abara, close to the well of that name, would have been most unsatisfactory, while a line from Al Aslum to the junction of S. Humar with the S. Kataba would run close to the walls of the Kataba barracks. The Amir of Dthala set great value on the inclusion within his limits of the site and cultivation of Abnra. We consequently gave to the Turks the cultivation in the W. Shaddad, which entirely belongs to the people of Kataba, and, by leaving them free the road out of Kataba passing close to the junction of the S. Humar with the S. Kataba, induced them to leave us the entire bed of the W. Abara down to Lakmat-ad-Duki, and to take the line well free of the northern bank from Habil Khadr to Habil Duwar, thus leaving on the Amiri side a good deal of cultivation belonging to the Yubi village of Shakhab. The Turks further agreed to include within our limits the cultivation near Kuli’a Assoufla, which wms outside the line first drawn on Map C, and was claimed by both the Haiki and Dakkam. 6. J may remark that, though the line unavoidably crosses cultivation in parts, in no instance has Amiri cultivation been left on the Turkish side, while the converse has happened to no small extent. As demarcation does nst imply disturbance of private rights, a document was exchanged with the Turkish Commissioners, and copies given to the local representatives on both sides, certifying that the inhabitants on either side of the boundary would continue, as heretofore, to enjoy all private rights in matters of real property, water, grazing, and “ wakf.” This went a long way to remove the suspicions of the natives that the work of the Commission implied an interference with individual rights. 7. The villages of Habil-as-Selami, Bir Kes, Jos-al-Jamal, and the site of Abara, as also Lakmat-ad-Duki, now within the Amiri border, are Yubi; hut this did not quite reconcile the Amir to the work of the Commission not having resulted in vindicating his claims to the remainder of the Yubi and Haiki villages. On the^wh^L, however, he is very pleased with his present boundary, and is deeply grateful to Government for the restoration of his rights. t We took steps to introduce him to the local Turkish Representatives, with whom the Amir expressed a strong desire to maintain cordial relations, and thus, if possible, avoid any serious friction along his border. 8. The settlement of the northern portion of the Amiri boundary effected with the lurks, together with the excellent personal as well as official terms which we went out of our way to maintain with them at the time, materially contributed to dispel their suspicions that we were actuated by motives of territorial aggrandisement at their expense. By keeping them in this frame of mind we were enabled to demarcate the Haushabi border without undue delay, aud, under the pretext of border survey, induced our Turkish colleagues to permit our surveyors to visit points in their territory well beyond the area under delimitation. The results are very valuable, as we have thus been able to survey close on 500 square miles of Turhish territory beyond the border zone. The Turks declared they would be able to justify to their own authorities this departure from the ordinary Turkish system of exclusion by representing that the results of the survey would be of great use to their Government whenever a regular survey of i eman should be carried out, a contingency, however, which they themselves looked on as veiy remote. We undertook to give them the results of our survey in their territory, and have done so as far as the compilation of the maps in the field permits. We trust there will he no difficulty in subsequently forwarding them, through the British Vice- Consul at Iiodeida, any such work as may not have been completed before we separate. I have, &amp;c.

Secret, No. 35. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Mtotteta Spoilt cJjlfj Policy in regard to the Aden hinterland. Acas.cr, if ie siratofla- 2n;eofiiS' miat-al-Wi Sliftll® ( f Hcs.1 Ziiiii* 1 •Tin. re to jest 1 My Lord, I have inveii careful consideration to Your O Excellency’s Secret Despatch of 9tli August, No. 119, as well as to the enclosures with which you favour me containing the correspondence with the Government of Bombay and the Resident at Aden. I am obliged to Your Excellency for thus placing me in complete possession of the opinions held both at. Simla and by the local authorities upon the points of detail involved in the policy laid down in my Despatch No. 20 (Secret) of 4th May. 2. The discussion throws light upon the views that have influenced the course pursued since the delimitation of the external frontier of the Aden protectorate, and it marks the difference of opinion that exists as to the objects sought by the local authorities and His Majesty’s Government respec tively. The retention of a part of the Aden garrison at D’thala, and the permanent presence there of a British Agent, are advocated by the Government of India as developing the policy of the delimitation by the extended establishment of British authority among the tribes on our side of the border. To accomplish this end, it appears to be considered necessary to overcome the reluctance of the tribes men to accept the suzerainty of the Amir of D’thala; to carry our influence into the territory of other tribes with whom we had practically no dealings till, during the delimitation, treaties were concluded with representatives of the Upper Yaffai, who are now discovered to be persons of no real authority ; to secure for the Chiefs of the protected tribes ready and friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes; to check the spread of the Pan- Islamic programme in Yemen; and to maintain our reputation with the Arabs. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government, on the other hand, British interests at Aden are mainly centred in the British territory and fortress at Aden, and the primary object of recent arrange ments with the Ottoman Porte was to reduce the risk of international complications by arriving at a definite understanding as to the outer boundary of S. 26. A **V if}?the tribal country in political relations with the British settlement. Turkish infractions of a serious character since the notification made to the Porte in 1873, have been mainly due to the want of a map recognised as correct by both the Turkish and the British Governments. Within the pro tectorate of the nine cantons since the occupation of Aden in 1^39 there has usually been some degree of disturbance, and the precise authority of the leading Chiefs has changed so much from time to time that our policy in direct negotiations with the tribesmen has necessarily followed the varying exigencies of the day. Por instance, the Subaihis were, by the engagement of the 5th of May 1881, recognised as under the “ sovereign authority ” of the Abdali Sultan, but utter five years it became necessary to treat that arrangement as inoperative, and the Subaihis resumed their former indepen dent relations with the Aden llesidency. The guiding fact is that during the last half century these inter-tribal disputes have, to a large extent, regulated themselves, and admitted of peaceful settlement by the liesident at Aden, without the continual presence of either troops or Political Agents in the interior. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the recent treaties of demarcation and protectorate ought to strengthen the hands of the Political authorities at Aden in resuming the long-standing policy of inactivity, and call for no departure from it. It may be perfectly true that the Arabs expect British troops to remain in their country, and that some Chiefs and some sections of tribes might be glad of their support. But His Majesty’s Government never authorised any action calculated to commit them to this extension of their responsibilities, involving, as it must, an augmentation of the Aden garrison, and an increase of expenditure. The protection formally extended to the tribes is a protection against foreign aggression, and had particular reference to the proceedings of the Turkish Government, in respect of which the situation has been fundamentally altered by the settlement of the frontier agreed to by the Porte. The presence of a British garrison at D’thala is only too likely to be regarded as inimical to Turkish interests, and as indicating an intention to interfere more than formerly in matters of tribal adminis tration. It is inconsistent uith a policy of reliance on the effect of diplomatic representations at Con stantinople in the event of violations of the frontier or serious disputes, and for the reasons stated in paragraph 2 of my Despatch dated 4th of May 1906, is open to other serious objections. 3. With much satisfaction I observe that the general principle now decisively adopted by His Majesty’s Government commands the cheerful adherence of Your Excellency in Council. You inform me (paragraph 4) that you “ most cordially subscribe to the policy of non-interference with the internal and domestic policy of the tribes.”lliis cardinal principle, then, we hold in common.. The suggested applications of that principle, how ever, disclose a view of its practical meaning, which I am unable to share. For example, Your Excel lency discusses the use of a subsidy in enabling the Amir of D thaia to hold his own either against the tribes or the Turks ; and the point is emphasised that “such success ns has hitherto attended the policy of consolidating the waning authority of the Amir of F’thala, has been mainly d ie to the “ moral and material support which is afforded to “ him by the presence of our political agent and “ the British force at that place.” Or, as the Aden Resident puts it, the moral support of our troops “ will in time overcome the reluctance (of the tribesmen) to accept the Amir’s suzerainty.” Surely here is an unexpected version of the policy of non-interference with the domestic affairs of the tribes, and studious non-entangle ment in purely tribal affairs (paragraph 8). It seems to reduce cordial adhesion to the much less hopeful level of pious opinion. This rather perplexing interpretation of the policy of non-interference and freedom from entangle ment undergoes in later taragraphs a still more formidable extension. “If Turkish intrigue and “ .Mahometan fanaticism are to be left uncontrolled “ in that country [the Aden Hinterland] ”—so the Government of India assure me—“we fear “ that we shall before long be involved in opera- “ tions that might have been avoided bv a firm “and consistent attitude towards the tribes” (paragraph 13). But what is this attitude to be ? Interference or non-interference ? We are to take in hand from Aden the control of Turkish intrigue and Mahometan fanaticism. “ It [our withdrawal],” says the Resident at Aden, “ would afford them “ [the Turks] unlimited opportunities for . “ the furtherance of the Tan-Islamic programme.” Can we hope to exercise this control over such subtle and pervasive forces as fanaticism and intrigue without meddling in any of the internal and domestic doings of the tribes ? We are urged to look even further than this. “ There is a real danger,” Your Excellency warns us, “ that, if we “ now withdraw, in a few years we may be “ confronted with an independent Arabia.” These apprehensions, if I understand them aright, point to an indefinite period of such observation and control as would either be meaningless and in effectual, or else would inevitably draw us into that active, perpetual, and costly interference, to the mischiefs of which we all with entire sincerity profess ourselves alive. 4. Here I find myself compelled to draw atten tion to the Indian aspect of this discussion—that being the only aspect with which the Government of India is immediately concerned. We are, it would seem, to extend the military and financial liabilities of India, not merely to help or defendthe fortress at Aden, but “ to stem a religious tide in Yemen,” though, by the way, the stemming of religious tides is a delicate operation, and has never hitherto been regarded as a desirable or even tolerable element in Indian policy. Next, I would ask whether this is a case in which we should be guided by precedents from the North-West and other frontiers of the Indian Empire. The Aden Hinterland is not a frontier province in any natural sense. Aden is an outlying post administratively connected with Bombay, and wholly different in its character fromthe boundaries that have been reached upon our vast border line to-c'ay after twenty years of conflict both in counsel and in arms. The position of Aden, in short, in the ordering of Indian territories and policy is peculiar, and arguments overlooking this circumstance may easily fall wide of any true mark of Indian statesmanship. 5. Whether the rise of an independent Arabia he a near or a remote contingency, there can at least be no doubt that the advent of such a question upon the international horizon, whatever part a British Government might choose to take in respect of it, would assuredly be a subject of Imperial policy, not to be decided by considerations of Indian interest alone or even primarily. Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, pointed out, in the year 1874, the marked change that has been effected in the military 6 7 , political, and commercial value to Great Britain of our position at Aden, since it came into our possession as a decayed settlement of comparatively small impor tance nearly 7 seventy 7 years ago. The Suez Canal wholly transformed its place in any system of Indian interests, making it the key to the great commercial highway to the East, used by great fleets of merchant ships of all the nations of the world. We are thus involve 1, said Lord Salisbury, “ in diplomatic action in which India “ has no direct voice and over which she has no “ practical control.” The occupation of Aden, in short, derives its principal importance “ from its “ relation to the general foreign policy of the “ Empire, in which it holds a position analogous to that of Malta and Gibraltar.” This propo sition is beyond dispute. In view of it any enlargement of Indian obligations in regard to Aden is wholly unjustifiable, and all operations tending in any' degree towards such an enlargement are to be sedulously and vigilantly avoided. 6. From these larger considerations of general policy, I pass to what may be regarded 'as the secondary arguments in your Excellency’s Des patch. It is stated that Aden is unhealthy, and that troops cannot, be trained at Aden. Neither the Aden Administration reports nor the Armv Medical reports accessible to me tend to prove that the climate has become of late more injurious cither to Native or European troops. Compared e\eii ‘with the returns for Boona, Aden seemsto be not particularly unliealtby. Indeed, it would appear that the Native troops have suffered more sca erely than before since they were required to serve in the interior. As regards training I understand that the position is not affected by anything that has occurred of late, and so iong as our military and naval requirements demand the presence of a garrison on this distant portion of the Presidency of Bombay, the situation must be alleviated otherwise than by the main tenance of a sanitarium in the interior. If in the opinion of your Government any special measures are required at Aden itself for the comfort of the garrison or for their proper training, I shall be ready to consider them, but His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to withdraw the troops which are required for other purposes at Aden to D’thala, which is nearly a hundred miles from the coast. I shall therefore be glad (o learn when Your Excellency in Council has withdrawn to Aden, or, if you think fit, to India, the detach ment now stationed at D’thala, which can be most conveniently effected in the course of the present relief season. 7. I may notice one other argument which is brought forward as a reason for remaining in the Amiri country—namely, the control of the arms traffic. So long as arms can be landed on the coast, no troops that we can employ in the interior will prevent the passage of arms, and I am unable to agree that the Europeans stationed at D’thala can be of any material service in stopping that traffic. 8. The question has also to be considered in its financial aspect. The latest Aden administration report received (for 1904-05) shows the expenditure under the heads respectively of “ Political,” “ Terri torial and Political Pensions,” and “ Military,” as Bs. 3,02,014, Bs. 73,775, and Bs. 38,54,091. Doubtless this scale of expenditure has since been reduced in consequence of the termination of the delimitation proceedings, but the figures I have quoted are very greatly in excess of those for the year 1899-1900, wiien the cost under “ Political ” was Bs. 1,97,826, under “ Territorial and Political Pensions” Bs. 73,383, and under “Military” Bs. 17,62,816. 9. As regards the Political Officer at D’thala, it was recognised in my Despatch of 4th May that in existing circumstances his immediate withdrawal might be impracticable. This view r is confirmed by the Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople of the 7tli xAugust last. But His Majesty’s Government continue of opinion that his retention should be strictly temporary ; and the Political Officer should conduct affairs on that understanding, so as to minimise the effect of his departure wdien it takes place. In the meantime there is no objection to his discussing, as suggested S. 26. B'by Sir N. O’Conor, affairs of secondary importance ■with the local Turkish authorities when necessary. He should, however, be circumspect in dealing with complaints, and careful not to exaggerate such incidents as may occur. The need for caution is shown by the precipirancy of the action taken on the occasion of the alleged violation of Amiri territory reported in the correspondence termi nating with the Government of India’s Letter of the 2.Ah December 1904, No. 253. 10. I must request that no soit of permission or encouragement be given to the extension of any line of railway into the British territory at Aden without my express sanction, and I should like to be informed what steps have been taken by the Abdali Sultan towards giving any concession lor railway enterprise in his own country. I notice that the commerce of Aden by land has fallen off in recent years, and I should wish to know what estimates have been framed of the cost of a railway in the Abdali territory and of its probable profits. 11. Your Excellency revives the question of the detachment of Aden from the Presidency of Bombay. That question, last raised by the Governor-General in Council in 1903 in the Despatch* mentioned by Your Excellency, is of great importance, and deserves the full considera tion that you may be disposed to give to it. It will, however, be more freely discussed when the administration of Aden has resumed its normal lines. Meanwhile, if Your Excellency should approve of any suggestions made ' by the Government of Bombay for strengthening the administi ation of that portion of the Presidency of Bombay, I will give them my prompt attention. Since the Besident must be largely occupied in his military duties, I am disposed to believe that the appointment of a specially qualified Eirst Assistant to co-operate in tribal and frontier affairs, would be altogether advantageous, and I should be glad if an arrangement with that object could be°made without delay.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Loud, Views of His Majesty's Govern- The appointment of a new Resident at Aden ment on the main questions arising seems to be a proper occasion for lay in'- before in connection with the tribes of the Your Excellency the views of His Majesty’s Govern- Aden Protectorate. ment on the main questions arising in connection with the tribes of the Aden hinterland. The correspondence also addressed to the Government of India by the Governor of Bombay in Council, which, by your instructions, Eis Excellency has forwarded to me under date 12th March 1906, appears to invite an immediate consideration of the principles that it would now be mcst politic to follow in that region. 2. It appears to be supposed by some that the process of delimitation, satisfactorily carried out in concert with the Turkish Government in the Aden hinterland and establishing a definite frontier between the territories of the Sultan and certain of the tribes, brought with it an extension of the responsibilities and obli gations of Great Britain. Lord Lansdowne, however, who was actively concerned in the transaction, explicitly rejected that construction of what had taken place. In the House of Lords on £0th March 1903, replying to a question whether the demarcation arranged with Turkey had enlarged the British sphere of influence, he said : “ With regard to the responsibility for these territories, I do not see why what has taken place “ should make any difference in these responsi- “ hilities. We have never desired to interfere “ with the internal and domestic affairs of the “ tribes. On the other hand, we have throughout “ made it perfectly plain that we should not “ tolerate the interference of any other Power with “ them.” In this interpretation His Majesty’s present advisers in the fullest sense concur. The security and strength of Aden as one of the main posts and fortresses that guard the line between England and India, must always he a standing object in national policy. That strength will obviously be impaired and not augmented by quarrels with the tribes, by intervention in their disputes, by multiplication of formal agreements S. 13. A*1 W3** with them, hy locating troops at a distance from the fortifications of Aden, or hy any excessive readiness to resort to expeditions out of all pro portion, whether immediate or indirect, to either the occasions for them or to any clear advantage to he gained hv them. 3. If, as His Majesty’s Government have decided, the main, purpose of the recent delimi tation is achieved hy the fixing of a line heyond which Turkish troops or agents cannot advance, I submit to your Excellency the following propo sitions as well fitted to carry out our decision. So far as the Turkish frontier is concerned, it is in the highest degree desirable that the importance of trespasses across the line, which are neither serious nor deliberate, should not be exaggerated, and. should a protest he required, it would naturally be hy way of action at Constantinople. Outside the territory of British India and within a limited area of the Protectorate similar to that formerly known on the Somali coast as the‘ : ten-mile limit,” internal disturbances would call for interposition. But heyond that line our Agent should be careful to avoid every step that might lead us into military or political entanglements, without the express sanction of the Secretary of State. A railway to Dthali and a cantonment or sanatorium there, should be considered as outside the contemplation of the Government. This being so, the large body of troops now stationed at Dthali should he with drawn, leaving only a sufficient escort for the Political Officer so long as he may remain there. 4. The retention of a Political Officer at Dthali was originally provisional. In September 1904 my Predecessor assented to the proposal of the Government of India ‘‘as a temporary measure, to “ retain a British officer and a small body of troops “ at Dthali.” This assent he limited to one year, requesting that after the expiry of that time he should be informed as to the existence of “ any “ real necessity for maintaining the official and his “ escort at Dthali.” In November 1905, however, he accepted the reasons of the Government of India for making it permanent. In view of the change of circumstances which will be the result of the present instructions, His Majesty’s Govern ment are satisfied that the arrangement need not be regarded as a permanent one, and that it will be sufficient if the Political Agent is permitted to visit Dthali temporarily and for special purposes as occasion may require. For the present I leave it to your Excellency to decide when, after the retirement of the troops, the Political Officer and his escort should be withdrawn. 5. The despatch of postal runners or agents of the British Government into the interior is to be as much as possible avoided. Any project for disarming the tribes in the nine cantons should be dismissed from serious consideration. Punitive expeditions for offences committed during thedemarcation, and not punished then and there, are now out of the question. No demonstration along the frontier, whether demarcated or not, seems to he needed, and, without previous reference to me, no attempts should he made to conclude fresh treaties. 0. I trust that these propositions may commend themselves to your Excellency, as principles to he pressed upon the attention of the Government of Bombay, and as matter for instructions to the Resident whom your Excellency has appointed to Aden. -Any other policy might draw us into a re petition on another scene of the recent transactions in Somali Land.

Sihr, betvveen Nabwa Sihr and A\ Ja’ama, and (3) some 2 square miles 3 in the vicinity of Auja, the Turks now show signs of agreeing, when confronted with the alternative of possible extensive Subaihi claims antecedent to the status of 1901 2. 1 he attitude of the lurks since the Joint Commission entered the Kubati-Subaihi border zone has ceased to be one of friendly co-operation. The departure, owing to illness, of the second Turkish Commissioner has led to Zia Effendi, whose conduct was unfavourably commented on in our No. 337 of the 20th October, 1903, coinino- into greater prominence Again, the Turks appear to have previously only twice visited the Kubat! country, and only once, some twenty-two years ago, that of the Humedi. These tribes, thinking the Turkish Commission and escort might proceed to collect taxes were at hrst inclined to resist their progress, and the Turks seem to have overcome the difficulty by diverting the unfriendliness of their Sheikhs into anti-British channels. Their Arabs' j ere f fir * t / ar fl ' om peaceably disposed towards them, suddenly changed their attitude, and, on being promised that no taxes would be collected, began putting forward extravagant claims in the name of “Abdul Hamid, the Khalifa, Lord of the Two Seas ” &amp;c. the Matarafi and other Subaihi Sheikhs informed us that the Kubati Sheikhs had invited them to throw in their lot with the “Sultan of Stamboul,” and have nothing to r C , Brltls, v. This policy was successful with the Zedin Subaihi, who were^one or the hrst to enterjnto relations with the British in 1839. _ 3. The claims of the Turks to J. Kurra and the junction of the Wadis Hidaba and fan is inadmissible, as we have shown them the title deeds, dating back 100 years ot the idaushabi to all the property in the W. Hidaba up to Suk Rabu’. Moreover the eviGenee of the inhabitants shows that Ahmad Asim, formerly Mutasarif of Taiz, visited feuk itabu , and admitted as Haushabi all the Wadi below that place. 4. ihe Jurkish claim to the Juheli and down to the Nakii Mad raj a, as will appear trom onr Diary entry of the 3rd February, and our telegram No. 12 of the 6th February 1JU4, is quite inadmissible. The area is small, but its inclusion in the Turkish sphere gives an impossible bjundary. The Juheli paid once to the Turks through the Kubati . eikh some years ago, and give an annual present of two sheep to the same Sheikh to insure his good will for their passage through this country. This cannot, however, be considered as sufficient ground for handing over a Subaihi clan to the Turks, especially as lie claim involves handing over the Nakii Madraja or only road connection between the rlaushabi and Subaihi. The latter road was, moreover, built by the last Sultan of Dahej. 5 - Turkish claim to the upper part of W. Dar, in the Matarafi country between J. Muharraka and J. Asia, is likewise inadmissible, and cannot be meant seriously. Not a particle of the area in question belongs to the Kubati, while, after the Kuren Well, it contains the only water supply, called Sueda, in the Matarafi territory. G. From J. Asla^to L. Hamera, upon which point both sides practically agreed, the intermediate line by Kurun Sarah, which is also a natural feature, is such an obvious com' 1 promise, that the Turks are inclined to accept it. 7. From L. Hamera to N. Mutarid the difference is inappreciable, and is we think susceptible of adjustment. 8. In the W. Sihr, Nabwa Sihr is the Zedin border. What happened on our visiting the spot with the Turks is recorded in our Diary of the 6th March. The Shujefi -sub-tribe were formerly all under the Mansuri Sheikh, but for some years back those in VV. Shah and near Mufalis have come under the influence of the Turks, while the few ohujefi villages in W. Sihr, between Nabwa Sihr and Ja’ama have been partially absorbed by the Kubati Sheikh during the last three to four years. They, however with the [1861 ff- —1] * ’ BShujefi in Wadi Tukar, undoubtedly belong to the Mansuri, and a compromise with the Turks on the subject is difficult. 9. The Turks will probably admit the whole of W. Nifakha. which has no cultivation or population, as Subaihi. - - 10. The Wadi Shah (vide Diary, entry of the 24lh February) is partly Jurabi and nartly SJiujefi, while the upper two-thirds belong to the Ahl Shah, mentioned as a Subaihi sub division in Statement No. 1, in the Residency’s Memorandum on the Subaihi of the 14th January, sent in reply to Commission’s No. 354 of the 28th December, 1903. The Turks admit the Jurabi portion up to Lukema, while we have hesitated to claim the rest of the Wadi up to Nijd Shah. The whole Wadi was undoubtedly Subaihi until fifteen years ago or more, when the Turks established an irregular Customs' post in it. It appears they had first^started it near N. Mikrad, but that on^an intimation from the then Sultan of Lahej that Shah was Subaihi, they removed it to the valley north-west of Doka Through this Customs-post they have gradually brought the whole Wadi Shah above Lukema under their indirect control. 1 he basis of the status of 1901 would preclude our claiming the upper two-thirds of W Shab, unless the Turks prove unreasonable about a fair settlement, or continue their present obstructive attitude. 11. From Lukema the Turks wished to take the border to the top of J. Rabat and J. Rauwa, and thence down the W. Ma’adin to the hills west of the junction of the W. Ma’bak with the W. Ma’din. It is not an exaggeration to style this latter portion qf their claim as outrageous, as it was merely based on the fact that the tower (completed m 1902) and hamlet of^ Auja are inhabited by people of Humedi origin, who for two generations and up to quite recently have lived as peaceable subjects of the Jurabi in the territory of the latter. Auja is separated by a belt of some 3 miles of purely Jurabi territory from the border of the Humedi in the W. Ma’bak, above Suleb. This portion of the claim, however, was practically settled by our camping near the old Jurabi shrine of feanawi. !2. The Humedi are numbered among the subdivisions of the Dubeni Subaihi hiven m Appendix I to the Residency, Subaihi Memorandum of the 14th January, 1904)°and some twenty odd years ago AH Mokbil, the father of the present Sheikh, appears to have been in relations with the Aden Residency. As, however, the tribe—which is not a large one—is not bubaihi, we refrained from preferring a claim to them. Their territory has only once been visited by the Turks—about 1887. They are turbulent tribesmen; who have enriched themselves by the smuggling of fire-arms, and the behaviour of them and then 8heikh has been truculent in the extreme, while evidence points to this bein^ partly due to the connivance of the Turkish Commissioner, Zia Effendi. 3 . A 1 ?' ,) he ’ r f ast l e . r ^ border 18 to tb e west of W. Suleb, while from the head of the latter to Auja the Subaihi border lies between the Jurabi and theSalibi. It has been impossible to get the Humedi or Sahhi to answer questions regarding their tribal boundary. They content themselves—evidently a Turkish prompting—with making sweeping claims as to the boundary of the Sultan ot Roum.” The Turks profess inability, real or feigned, to contiol them; nor have they taken steps to overcome the alleged reluctance of their tnbesmen to allow the survey of tiieir border to be carried out. . ln „„ ') e 5' es te«!ay informed the Turks that, if, after three weeks of patience and forbear- ; , ' ’ no elution of the Humedi border was to be found, we should have to claim them on die grounds of their former relations with the British.

Nabat is the irreducible minimum that could be forced•on the Jurabi. The spring of Mola’ is the “ life ” of their country, and they will naturally tight for it to the last man. 15. The inhabitants of Auja, though Humedi by origin, have for two generations been merged in the Jurabi, and the claim to consider their lands as part of Humedi territory is too ridiculous to be seriously considered. The claim synchronizes with the completion of the tower in 1902, and consequently constitutes a violation of the Trade on which delimitation is based. We have told tne bulks that if their claim is pressed we should be obliged to revive the claim to the old tribal border of the Subaihi and Athwari at Humira Makhsuj, and that we cannot leave before some solution of the tower difficulty is found. They have agreed, subject to sanction from head-quarters, to destroy it and indemnify the owner. It is the only possible way of avoiding intertribal fighting and bloodshed after the departure of the Commission. The tower would appear to have been built with the secret conni vance and assistance of the Mufalis Customs officials, who would, no doubt, put a post in it if it were acknowledged as Turkish. This audacious attempt seems to have been frustrated by the action of the Jurabi Subaihi, who made such a determined fight over it that the Turkish Customs and the Athwari were finally obliged to join them with a view to reopening the trade route, the traffic of which is of vital importance to the Customs revenue. 16. The recent attitude of the Turks, coupled with their alleged inability to have the border survey carried out on their side of the line, may force us, as soon as Ve can leave this neighbourhood, to proceed with our work without them. The cool season is already past, and we cannot take the responsibility of unnecessarily keeping our escort, &amp;c., in these regions longer than can be helped. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) R. A.

THIS is a witness in the hands of Sheikh Ahmad Daghim, to the effect that A1 Karaiha is his, and that the Athwari shall not interfere with them, according to the documents he (Ahmad Daghim) holds from Nakib Kayed-bin-Hasan. They are to be treated as the Subaihi, and their affairs are in the hands of Marbush. Dated Rabi Tani, 1290, or a.d. 1870. (Seal of Ameen-bin-Kasim-bin-Hasan.) Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Diary. (February 21 to March 14, 1904, inclusive.) February 21.—Interviewed the guardian of the Sanawi shrine, who gave evidence as to his border with the Turkish tribe of Humedi, on the west of the Jurabi border, and between them and the Zuraiki. He also declared that the tower (referred to in Diary entry of the 14th February), built by a Humedi at Auja in the W. Ma’din, and conse- quently far from the Humedi border, was inside Jurabi territory, the border of which was formerly well up the AVadi Ma’din, and near the Mufalis’ custom-house. This was confirmed by the Kadi and other Sheikhs whose evidence was taken on the subject. February 22.—Surveyor Lai Singh returned from the Kubati hills, having com pleted the survey there. Sub-Surveyor Ahmad Husen worked to the west of Mufalis. Colonel Wahab and Mr. Fitzmaurice visited Turks, and went into the question of the frontier at Auja. The tower built there bad previously been claimed as Turkish on the ground of the place belonging to the Turkish tribe of Humedi. On the Jurabi Sheikh’s evidence, that while a Humedi family possessed land there the place itself was inside the Subaihi boundary, the Turks produced the Athwari Sheikh, who claimed the place as his. It was evident from his manner that he had been prompted to make this ridiculous statement on the spot, being some 3 miles from the Humedi border, could not be claimed as Humedi. The Jurabi Sheikh showed that the Athwari border was immediately south of Mufalis, i.e. y about 2 miles north of Auja, so that the Athwari Sheikh’s claim to the spot seemed also untenable. Produced for the inspection of the Turkish Commissioners a document bearing the seal of the Turkish Kaimakam of the district, and dated 1290 a.h. or 1874 a.d., declaring that Karayiha, a village immediately south of Mufalis, was Subaihi, and that the Athwari had no right to interfere with it. As locally there was very great ill-feeling between the Humedi and Subaihi about the tower at Auja, it was decided to postpone the discussion until the surveyor had completed his work in the Humedi country. February 23.—Sub-Surveyor worked in the country of the Salihi to the west of Mufalis, and lying between the territory of the Athwari and Humedi. February 24.—Surveyor Lai Singh sketched on a scale of joioo the ground in dispute between Sanawi and Mufalis. Ali Ba Salih Haneshi and Hanesh Bin Ahmad gave evidence as to their border between the Turks and the Subaihi in Wadi Shah. They declared that the Jewazi were from time immemorial raiya, or subjects of the Jurabi Sheikh Said Muhammad-bin- Yakub, to whom they still pay; that when the Turks under their Commander, Suleman Nuri, first advanced (some twenty-five years ago) down this way Sheikh Daghim, the head Subaihi Sheikh, notified this to him, and that he accepted it; that subsequently the Turkish Commander, Ahmad Asim, visited these parts and forced the Jewazi to pay taxes; that since then, on the collection of revenue by the Turks, which happened once in six to ten years (the last occasion being some seven years ago) the Jewazi paid to them under compulsion, but they had continuously paid, and still pay, to the Jurabi Sheikh. They enumerated the Jewazi villages, which are mixed up with those of the Shafefi in the Wadi ^ umit. r J he Jewazi number about 100 men in the Wadi Yumit, and WadiShab, while the Sh^jefi number some sixty men in W. Shah, and some seventy in W Yumit and around Mufalis. ’ , She *!’ A ^ du ' K . 0 ' i , of 8h , a b visited the Commission, and stated that the upper two- thirds of the W. Shah belonged to him and other Syeds, the lower third belonging to the Jurabi (bubaihi) and ohajen in equal proportion, the latter being Turkish * that the Shajefi did not originally live in the W. Shab but bought fields there, and subsequently their Sheikh Naman and followers came and lived there; that when the Lahei Sultan Fadthl-bin-Ah occupied the Subaihi country in 1881 to 1885, Shab was within his limits though the Abdah ^ ultan exempted its inhabitants, owing to their sacred character, from taxation; that his (Sheikh Abdul Kowi’s) father, Muhammad Nasir, had acted as the Lahej Sultan’s agent; that the Lahej Sultan had fought the Shajefi and occupied their country in W. Yumit; that when some time after the withdrawal of the Abdali Sultan from the Subaihi country, some Turkish Arabs (Absi) had, at the instigation and with the moral aid of Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, of Ad-Dareja notoriety, wished to establish a customs post in Shab, when the Lahej Sultan wrote to them forbidding their doing so whereupon they established the post above Shab at Nohat Doka, and exacted dues in a most aibitrary fashion ; that when, some seven years ago, a certain Rifat Bey, with a l uikish force, penetiated into the Yusufiyin and Kubati country to collect taxes, and the Turkish Commander was about to visit Shab, he (Sheikh Abdul Kowi) visited him with a letter from the Lahej Sultan hadthl-bin-Ali (who died shortly afterwards), and made him desist from his intention, and that no Turkish force had ever visited the Wadi Shab. Sheikh Abdul Kowi declaied that he and his people wished, now that the boundary of the two Governments was to be delimited, that they and their country in Wadi Shab should be included in the Subaihi, or British sphere, according to their status, during the regime of the Lahej Sultan from 1876 to 1886, more especially as his ancestors were Kadis to the Subaihi. ^ He produced documents, signed by the Imams and going back over 200 \ears, declaring that Shab was not included in Rakabi, i.e., the district name of the country of the Absi, Kubatu, and Xusufiyin now 7 acknowdedging Turkish rule, also a document stating that it was Subaihi. He further stated that the majority of the inhabitants, who included some Mansuri and Dubeni Subaihis, were connected and had their dealings with the Subaihi. February 25. Sub-Surveyor still at w r ork in the Salihi country to east of Al Kala’. February 26. Received documents from the Sultan of Lahej, some of which had a bearing on the boundary of the Subaihi country as controlled by his predecessor. February 27.—Mohammedan festival of the Td (Turkish Bairam). ^ Interrogated several Subaihi Sheikhs, whose evidence agreed as to the tribal border being close to Mufalis, and as to the Subaihi border, even now after the Turks had usurped territory down to Mola, being above Auja, where the tower (mentioned in Diary, 14th February) had been built; in fact, though the lands on both sides of the Wadi above Auja, were not Subaihi, the Subaihi tribal border w 7 as above the source of the spring, which changed from year to year, at Humira Makhsuj (a large tamarind tree on the left bank of the Wadi, just under Husn Mufalis) and below Lakmat Mu’Aibira on the right hank. r I his was the tribal boundary between the Subaihi and Athwari from time immemorial, the spot w 7 here representatives of both tribes met to discuss tribal affairs, and the source of the spring, called the Ghail Mola’, upon which almost all the cultivation in the Jurabi country depended (though the actual spot where it welled out of the bed of the ^ adi varied), was always between Auja and Humira Makhsuj, up to which latter place the Jurabis had a right to follow it. February 28.—Turks informed us that the work of our Surveyor on their side of the boundary had had to be postponed till after the festival of the ’Id (Bairam). February 29.—Surveyor on Turkish side still got four days’ work. March 1.—Went into the question of the Shajefi, Jazi’i, &amp;c. Koraiha subjects of the Subaihi living in Wadis Yumit, Thabab, and Razuk. March 2.—Surveyor Ahmad Husen, with Turkish escort, went to flumedi country. March 3.—News received that Captain Warneford, Political Officer, had been shot by an Arab sowar at Amrija’, and was in a critical condition. Sent dhoolie to Dar-al- Kudaimi in case he could be removed. Turkish Commissioners called to discuss boundary with Humedi. March 4.—News received that Captain Warneford had died the previous night at 9 p.m. A gathering of Arabs stopped the survey on Turkish side in the Humedi country. March 5.—Sent Surveyor out under joint escort to complete work to west of *Wadi Ma’din.•8 Turkish Commissioners came to check and sign final maps of border from the Bana to Ras Namis in Haushabi territory. , „ . , ,, , , , , , ,. The Mansuri Sheikh gave evidence before the Turks as to the bordei between his people and the Kubati. Agreed to take him out to-morrow and confront him with the Kubati Sheikh on the ground. Received information that the Shajefi (subdivision of the Mansuri Subaihi) in Wadi Tokar and Wadi Sahr had been tanipered with by Turkish Agents, wdio endeavoured to induce them to say they were Turkish and under the Kubati She '\iarch 6 —Met the Turkish Commissioners at 6 a.m. in Uie Wadi Shab. They came with a iarge gathering of Kubati Arab and a Shajefi Customs employd. Proceeded bv Niid Mikrad-Nijd Ghorabi to Nabwa, Sihr. The aktls of the Zedtn, a hubaihi section, with whose ancestors one of the original Subaihi Treaties had been ml &lt;-39, and who had visited the Commission at Am Farsha on the 12th February (vide Diary entry of that date) to give information as to their border, declared, evidently as a result of 1 urkish intrigue, that there was no border between them and the Turkish Arabs of Kubati and A III Shab. Informed the Turks that we must then delimit on the basis of the southern boundary of the Zedin or on the basis of the northern boundary of the Ahl Shab. The Shajefi, who had come with the Turks, declared, evidently on Turkish inspiration, and protested loudlv, that the Shajefi country extended from Mufahs to Am Mashanj (in Mansuri country) all of which was consequently Turkish. The Mansuri MieiKh declared his acceptance'of the first statement which, he said, implied that the British boundary was at Mufalis, as the Sbajeti were a sub-section of the Mansuri. Informed Turks that further discussion was useless, and that we should be obliged to put forward all the official British claims which included the Ahl Shab. Tnis evidently had some effect on the Turk*?, who had some private conversation with the Kubati Sheikh. On arrival at Niid Mutarid, he changed his manner and admitted that the Shajefi in Wadi Tukar were Mansuri, and that bis boundary ran from Nijd Barn to Ras 1 ukar, thence to Nijd Husen, and thence to Nijd Mutarid. Discussion as to Shajefi in Wadi Sihr was postponed as the day was far advanced. It was clear that the Turkish Assistant Commissioner, Zia Effendi (vide Commission’s No. 337 of the 20th October, 1903), was at the bottom of the extraordinary attitude of the natives. Juledi akils came in on invitation and agreed to survey of their country, the carrying out of which they had previously prevented. March 7. —Mr. Fitzmaurice proceeded with Surveyor, a supporting force being stationed in the W. Ma’din, south-east of the Juledi, Ma’mai village. The survey was all but completed when some of the tribesmen showed a disposition to give trouble. The supporting force was moved up, upon which the survey was completed without incident. Party which had left in the early morning did not return till after dark. March 8.—Turkish Commissioner came with Zia Effendi to visit and examine into the section of the border between the Humedi and Jurabi. Colonel Mahab and Captain Redl accompanied them, but it was soon apparent from the extraordinary behaviour of the Turkish Arabs that no solution was likely. Colonel Wahab and party returned, the Turks remaining in the Humedi country, professedly to induce their Arabs to adopt a more reasonable attitude. They subsequently returned, bringing a Syed who lived in the Humedi country. His evidence rather went to confirm the contentions of the Jurabi. Turks then proposed to bring the Humedi head Sheikh, accompanied only by the Sved, to confront one Jurabi Sheikh and the keeper of the shrine of Sanawi, and to take the statements of both after swearing them on the Koran. The evidence of the Humedi and other Arabs pointed to the irreconcilable attitude of the Humedi Sheikh being the secret work of Zia Effendi. March 9.—Turks did not come with the Humedi Sheikh as arranged. Sheikh Abdul Kowi, of the Ahl Shab, came to inquire if we had agreed to Shab being within Turkish limits. Replied that nothing had yet been settled between us and the Turks. He asked leave to endeavour to settle the dispute and blood feud over the water at the supporting column camp. Told him we should be delighted if he succeeded in making peace in a matter which had so divided the Jurabi section involved. March 10.—Sheikh Abdul Kowi failed to make a settlement between the disputants, who showed signs of reopening the quarrel. Sent for them and made them give hostages to insure their keeping the peace during our stay in their neighbourhood. The cause of the fresh quarrel being that one side had used the water for irrigating their fields, while forcibly preventing their rivals from using it according to the custom of the country, as jointly agreed upon between them. Captain Redl, with party, went to make the offenders keep to their agreement. March 11.—Report that the Humedi were intriguing with bad characters among the Subaihi with a view to making a hostile demonstration against the British camp at night;also that the Turkish Commander at Taiz was marching in the direction of Jabal Makatra fmnfthe Tu^s Wele SUpP ° rt,ng the Humedi in ‘heir truculent attitude.

The Salihi Sheikhs who accompanied them apparently had been taught to make vague and sweeping claims as to the territory of the Sultan of Turkey. They evaded answering questions as to the tnbal boundaiy between them and the Subaihi. The evidence of the latter was clear precise, and convincing. * cu -il 1,00 ? 6 ?. ed tj Mol f.’ an( J All j a t0 interr0 o ate the inhabitants of both places, when the feheikh of the Humedi, whom the Turks had undertaken not to introduce into the discussion, suddenly appeared on the scene with over 60 armed followers. Turks professed to be unable to explain their arrival, but there seemed good reason to suppose that it was by their secret orders. Their Sheikh, when asked how he claimed Auja, which was cut off from the regular Humedi district, reiused to answer. This being the result of some weeks’ patent inquiry and forbearance on our part, informed Turks that we would not be justified in wasting more time in bootless inquiry, and that we felt forced to officially exchange and refer home the just Subaihi claims, although we had been prepared to sacrifice some of them in order to come to a settlement on the spot. We reminded them ^ttheyliad not, after a fortnight’s delay, taken steps to advance the survey in the adi Ma oak, and that we must explain these situations to our-Government. Agreed to meet to-morrow to exchange views on the whole subject. • ^MdrGh 14. At meeting with the Turkish Commissioners, latter professed their inability to advance the survey in the Humedi or Zuraiki country. They declared they had, as we had arranged with them, telegraphed for permission to destroy the tower at Auja. After hours of discussion, their attitude as to the preposterous claims of the Kubati and Humedi Sheikhs was so unreasonable that we felt obliged to put in all the Subaihi claims, as set forth in the Residency Memorandum of the Subaihi, forwarded to the Government of India in No. 13 A of the 14th January last, and stating that the Ahl Shah in the Wadi Shah and the Humedi were British. This made the Turks adopt a more reasonable^ attitude, and they promised to telegraph for instructions to enable them to settle with us a basis approximating the status of 1901. The recent behaviour of Zia Effendi left small hope of their telegraphing in a way to elicit precise instructions. (Signed) R. A. WAHAB, Colonel, Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission.

Whether these notes have yet been formally exchanged or not, this office is not aware, but it would not appear in any case that the action now reported as having been taken by the Turkish authorities of Rada is justifiable. I have, therefore, the honour to suggest th?it representations should be made through the British Embassy at Constantinople, with a view to necessary instructions being at once issued to the Kaimmakam of Rada to immediately withdraw his six policemen and his invitation. 4.

It is written that fthey will be given a safe conduct through the power of God and the Sublime Government. The Rubeaten Sheikhs believe the Turks are in quest of revenue. 2 . Rubeaten is clearly an appanage of Sultan Kahtan-bin-Omer (Upper Yafa), though I have received no news of a definite compromise by which, as suggested, Juban was to be ceded in return for Turkish recognition of our ? superior claims over Nawa, Rubeaten, and Dthabiani (mete*telegram of 6th / jf April 1905 from Political, Bombay, to Poreign, Simla). 3.

His Majesty’s Government approve the proposal that the appoint ment of a Political Officer at Dthala, which was sanctioned for one year in my Secret Despatch No. 45, of the 23rd September 1904, should he made permanent. But as regards the suggestion made in the Secret Letter from the Government of India, No. 253, of the 29th December 1904, that the lurkish Government should be invited to recognise the Political Officer as the medium of communication with the Turkish authorities in regard to disputes in the vicinity of the Aden frontier, it is desirable, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, to postpone am representation to the Turkish Government on the subject till a suitable opportunity presents itself after the settlement of the Aden Protectorate frontier has been officially placed on record by an exchange of notes with the Porte, and the signature of the maps. Copies of correspondence^ with the Foreign Office on the subject are enclosed. 3. As regards the question of stipends for the Sheikh of the Koiaibi and the Eadfan tribes, I agree in the views expressed in the letter under reply that it would be premature at present to enter into binding engagements either with the Sheikh of the Kotaibi or with any of the sub-tribes, or to grant them fixed stipends, and I approve the proposal that the Political Officer should be given a liberal discretionary power of making them occasional or periodical presents. * To Foreign Office, dated 4th February 190o.

India Office to Foreign Office. o- India Office, T i.* dth February 1905. continuation of Sir H. Walpole’s letter of the 17th October last and with reference to subsquent correspondence on tbe subject of the violation ot the Amin boundary by the Turks near Kataba, I am * Xo. 253. 7th December, and enclosures. directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick ., . to transmit, for Lord Lansdowne’s consideiation, a cop\ of a letter ' from the Government of India, statin 0 * the conclusions at which they have arrived after considerin°* the full reports of the local officers. 2. It appears that, though the violation of the boundarv was not so serious as it was at first supposed to be, yet the Turkish authorities did pursue ceitain peisons into Amiri territory with a view to arresting them, not for any crime, but because they had shown an intention of settling on the Amiri side of the border. 3. In the circumstances reported, Mr. Brodrick is of opinion that, if the Kaimakam has not been removed in accordance with the pledge reported in Mr. Tovvnley’s telegram of the 22nd Oct, No. 151, the question, so lar as he is concerned, might, if His Majesty’s Ambassador sees no reason to the contrary, be no further pressed. 4. Mr. Brodrick is also of opinion that, in the interest of the peace of the border, it is desirable to utilise the present incident ti obtain from the Turkish Government an understanding on the following points:— (1.) That all communications between the authorities on either side of the border in regard to disputes in that part of the frontier should, for the present, be made through the channel of the Political Officer at Dthala, and future arrangements of a permanent character can be considered when the Government of India reply to the Secretary of State’s Despatch No. 45 (Secret), dated 23rd September last. (2.) That additional pillars should be erected where required. (3.) That the establishment of villages should not be allowed on either side of the border in such positions as to render it doubtful whether they are in Amiri or Turkish territory. An arrange ment to this effect would apparently prevent the recurrence of such incidents as the present one, and Mr. Brodrick is doubtful of the necessity of demanding, as suggested by the Government of India, that the Turkish Government should allow migration from Turkish to Amiri territory to take place without hindrance. 5. As to the persons whose arrest was accompanied by this violation of Amiri territory, Mr. Brodrick is of opinion that, if the points enumerated in the preceding paragraph are conceded, it is unnecessary to ask for more than their release, with permission to settle on whichever side of the frontier they may prefer, but that otherwise their preliminary surrender to the local British authorities should be demanded.

In reply, I have the honour to express the opinion that it would be preferable that such minor and subsidiary questions should not be raised until the settlement of the Aden Protectorate frontier has been officially placed on record by an exchange of notes with the Sublime Porte and the signature of the maps ; and, apart from this, I think it will be best to wait till we have some concrete case in hand before asking the Porte to recognise the Political Officer &lt;at Dthala as the intermediary for communications respecting border disputes between the authorities on the British and Turkish sides. The Porte is always suspicious of new proposals of a general character and uneasy as to how far they may be found to be to their advantage when they come to be actually applied. They will not, I think, question the Political Officer’s right of interference when a definite complaint arises on the frontier. I have, &amp;c., The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., N. B.

It is possible that the outcome of present hostilities in Yemen may so affect the general situation on this portion of the Boundary as to facilitate thereports as desirable. And this is a possibility which I think should be carefully borne in mind. I have, etc., od/« H. M.

I hinted to him that he was not within our sphere so far as I Know and that it was possible he might at time of delimitation pass definitely within the Turkish side of the border. He replied he hoped this would not be so: he dis liked the Turks cordially; wished to be incorporated into our sphere and now believed that he would incur the dis pleasure of the Turks for having come to Dthala: that formerly there was a Turkish official in Juban who was murdered by the Arabs; that he had formerly accepted the invitation of the British Government and gone down to Aden in company with other oheikhs of Juban and he was now betv^een the Devil and the deep sea. Of Ha'wa he said it was really independent but at one time belonged to Juban and might even now be claimed as a part and parcel of the latter, though the present relations were strained by reason of a blood-feud. He said that Juban, Ha’wa and Dthubiyani were interdependent ('Tila'). I gave him ^20 and ^6 to his companions. He askedV •• asked for a pass for arras to Aden. He will probably ask /' for presents. I have pointed^to him that the less his conunerce wi th us at this juncture the better for him in • ♦ respect of his apprehensions abov* stated. j If Juban passes into Turkish lands and Na'wa and Dthubiyani remain on our side of the border there will be, I prophesy, constant friction on the border. Rubiaten is clearly under Sultan Kahtan bin ^mar Na'wa and Dthubiyani are claimed by the Nakibs of Mausatta. •n Their claim may have little foundation in fact, but the sympathies of the last two are with us, and all including Juban, are 'Halafa' of Upper Yafa and vice versa, i.e., if any of the coterie wish for armed assistance, the others will give it. Sd/- H. F. Jacob, Political Officer, Dthala. Dthala, 19th May 1905. Aden, for the information of the Resident.Memor andum- 'Re.' Notes of Interview between Captain Jacob * r and Ahmed Bubakr Abdul Rab one of the Sheikhs of Juban on the 19th May 1905. In the Marquess of Lansdowne’s despatch to Mr. Townley, No. 41, dated February 7th, 1905, (Foreign Office t ww % Arabia, February 7 ) it is stated 'that His Majesty*s Gov- Section I ernment consider that the districts known as Dthabiani, Tuban, Haawa and Rubeaten are dependencies of the Yaffai, on* of the nine British cantons, but that they reserve a final decision upon this point for the Commission which will delimitate the frontier from Lakmat-es-Shub north-east to the desert in virtue of the Imperial Irade of the 13th February 1903.' On the 15th March 1905 the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy that 'the Vali will be sent instructions to the effect that delimitation of Yaffai frontier is to be proceeded with in due course by the Boundary Commission. Rubeaten and other places so far as they may be proved to be Yaffai will be covered by this arrangement.' On the 20th March 19 q 5 Mr. Fitzmaurice telegraph ed to His Majesty*s Ambassador at Constantinople 'It would seem that Juban is a stumbling-block of aettlement ofboundary north-east, in consequence of its being the administrative centre of a canton'. And on the 4th April 1905 he te 1 egraphed-'If I forego claim to Juban, Turkish Commissioner can give up claims to the other three places.' 2. On the 6 J h April 1905 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay telegraphed to the Viceroy expressing concurrence with the suggested compromise to cede Juban in considera tion of cession of the other three places* In his telegram to the Foreign Office of the 4th April His Majesty^ Ambassador at Constantinople also expressed approval of the compromise as from the information in his possession seem ing advantageous. On the 15th April the compromise was accepted by the Viceroy and on April 18th Mr. Eitzmaurice was informed that His Majesty’s Government accepted arrangement in regard to Subaihi Frontier and that he might sign the process verbale- which he accordingly did on April the 20th. 3 . Turning to the process verbale of the 20th April it appears that Mr. Fitzmaurice states that 'the documents and other proofs furnished hy the Sheikhs of Yaffa estahlxs- indisputably that the places called Ruheaten, TIaawa and Dthabiani form part of the canton of Yaffa while the Aulaki (plur: Awalik) with all their sub-divisions and dependen cies, as also all other Yaffa districts lying to the South andand east to the aforesaid north-east line belong to the •nine cantons''. Mr. Fitzmaurice makes no mention of Juban* But Colonel Mustapha Remzi Bey replies that 'provided the Uzle of Juban remains part of the Kaza of Rada, he recognises that the Uzles of Rubeaten, Naawa and Dthabiani form pa&gt;*t of the canton of Yaffa, and that the Awalik with all their sub-divisions and dependencies, as also all other Yaffa districts lying to the south and east of the above north-east line belong to the # nine cantons'. 4. Thus, although Mr. Ritxmaurice has not expressly surrendered Yaffai f s right to Juban, the Ottoman Commis- , sioner’s admission that Rubeaten, Naawa and Dthabiani belong to Yaffai is conditional on Juban remaining part of the Kaza of Rada. 5. Thus, although there remains a poasibility of the Juban question being re-opened should the circumstances of the case ever render it expedient to do so, it appears that this must of necessity entail also a re-opening of the Rubeaten, Naawa and Dthabiani questions. And in regard to this, paragraph 12 of Mr. Fitzraaurices letter to the Government of India dated, Perim, April 30th, calls for very careful consideration, 6. Prom this it appears that in obtaining the recognition by the Turks that Rubeaten, Naawa and Dthabianiare Yaffai we are obtaining more than the status of 1S01, which was the accepted basis of demarcation- warranted. And it further appears that though according to the document enclosed in the Boundary Commissioner’s No. 340 of October 26th 1903 Rubeaten was so indisputably Yaffai that it could not have been left to the Turks without a loss of prestige vis-a-vis our tribesmen, Yaffai connection with the other places was much weaker. 7. From this it would appear prima facie injudicious to r c --open the Juban question unless and until we are so armed with further documentary or other evidence of an irrefutable nature as to unquestionably establish our claims on both Juban and Naawa and Dthabiani in the face of the facts that in 1901 all these places were considered Turkish and that in the Residency records of 1894 Rubeaten, Naawa and Juban were actually mentioned as being within Turkish limits. And it may therefore be premised that it would be injudicious to, for the present at any r^te, attempt any re-opening of the question unless circumstances of quite exceptional urgency and iraporance render it imperative to do so. 8. From the notes of Captain Jacob-s interview dated 19th May 1905, with Sheikh Ahmed Bubakr Abdul Rab of Juban, it appears that that Sheikh admits that formerly there was a Turkish official in Juban and further expressesfear that he will incur the displeasure of the Turks tv his recent visit to Dthala. He is thus impliedly under Turkish suzerainty. He wishes howev-r to he incorporated in our sphere of influence and considers that he has already taken a step in that direction by his visit to Aden last year. allied or according to the Arabic expression 'Hulafa”, the signification of which is that there is a sort of offensive and defensive alliance between them. Captain Jacob prophesies friction if Juban passes practically nothing on the subject between 1894 when, as Mr. Fitzmaurice says, Rubeaten, Haawa and Juban were actually mentioned as being within Turkis/i limits, and the autumn of 1903, when there is a brief demi-official correspondence between General Maitland and Colonel Wahab concerning certain letters addressed to two of the leading members of the family of Sultan Kahtan of Upper Yaffai which were somehow intercepted before arrival at their destination. These letters purported to emanate from o»e He states that Juban, Haawa and Dthabiani are Turkish hands while Naawa and Dthabiani remain with us. 9 Turning to the Residency records there is KadiMahomed All of Juhan and a certain Sheikh Saleh bin Saleh Jairi of Rada, and conveyed sentiments distinctly hostile to us, conrgatulating the two Sheikhs Saleh hin Omar and Haidara bin Mahomed of Upper Yaffai on their successful resistance of the Christians and inviting them to proceed to Rada with a view to receiving presents from the Turkish authorities there. Colonel Wahab took the view that the correspondence was not of much importance and mainly resulted from the desire of the Kadi of Juban, whom he described as a willy person not unfriendly to us, to appease the irritation of the Turks at our advance into Rubeaten and Uaawa from which we had subsequently with drawn. But General Maitland considered that the matter was of importance, as it was precisely the way in which a Turkish intrigue with the Yaffai would be commenced. 10. Nothing further appears until the beginning of 1904, when there is a letter dated 16th January 1904 from the late Captain Warneford to certain four Sheikhs of Juban including Sheikh Ahmed Bubakr whom Captain Jacob nas recently interviewed, in which a letter received from them was acknowledged and they were told that if the., desired to visit Aden and a iuse themselves with its aspects ma marvels we should be glad to see than • In the middle of March these Sheikhs and a small partyparty of followers accordingly visited Aden and in regard to that visit it is significant to remark that the only credentials produced hy the party were Captain Warneford’s letter and an order dated 20th Shaban 1310 (9th March 1893) issued by the Kaim Makam of Rada, whereby one of the Sheikhs, Ali Abdul Karim, was recognised as the head chief of the district of Juban and appointed to collect the dues of the Turkish Government . Captain Warneford's death had taken place meanwhile, and very little was known of the visitors by Mr. Bury or any one in Aden. They were entertained and given small presents but the Political Resident refused to see them himself or to make them any promises of protection. The view taken by the Political Resident both then and later upon the occassion of the visits of some other Sheikhs of Juban, in tne montn of July 1904, was that while there was no harm in ureating tne visitors with civility it whs to be remembered that their country had not yet been included in the Aden Protectorate as the Turks had not up till then admitted our claim it was part of Yaffai. General Maitland added the words 'which ft undoubtedly is'. &lt; 11. Last October some of the Juban Sheikhs visited the Political Officer at Dthala when they were giv«n smallsmall presents with which they were not satisfied and so came cn to Aden in the hopes of more which they did not however receive. 12. Prom the above it appears that hitherto our actual relations with «Xuhan have not 'been intimate. But the same remark may be held to apply also to our relations with ITaawa, Rubeaten and Dthabiani. And the main consideration is not perhaps so much our relations with these four tribes as the relation^between them and Yaffai. 13. The main question in fact would appear to be whether Juban is, as Mr. Pitzraaurice says of Rubeaten, so indisputably Yaffai .that its cession to the Turks does or will serious^ affect our j)^^stige vis-a-vis our tribesmen. So far it would appear that it is not; and the existence of a friendly alliance between Juban and the other two districts of Raawa and Dthabiani need not of necessity be held to effectively counteract the consider ation that Juban is and apparently has been for some time past an administrative centre of the Turkish canton of Rada. At least it would seem desirable to take no action pending further inquiry by the Political Officer at Dthala into the merits of the case and the possibility of collectingcollecting and adducing such stronger evidence in support of our claims to Tioth Juban, Naawa and Dthabiani than is « at present available. 16. Until the friction which Captain Jacob prophesies ► ' * f actually takes place or shows signs of seriously affecting ' t our prestige it would-appear possibly injudicious to. at V present, take any action which might disturb the settlement recently arrived at, and which is one, which under all circumstances may fairly be termed mor- favourable than we had amj good cause to anticipate.
