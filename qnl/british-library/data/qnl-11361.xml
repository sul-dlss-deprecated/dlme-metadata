Dates and photographer can also not be ascertained, however, it can be construed that the photograph dates from the latter half of the 19th c.The buildings are fronted by a series of faux romanesque arches of varying sizes and intervals, with two two-light, roundel-capped arches at either end of the largest, central structure.Inscriptions:Recto: Upper left corner, in pencil: '1'Verso: Along upper edge, in pencil: 'Mss Eur F126/113'</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Residencies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023421309.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
