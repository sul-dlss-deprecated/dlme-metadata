'4 Bahrein Island. Persian Gulf, 5th April, 1942. -ROYAUTI MEASUKEMEMTS. His Britaimic Majesty's Political Agent, BASKSIN. Dear Sir, The accounting procedure followed 'by the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited for the purpose of making royalty computations is in accordance with Article 7 of the Lease dated 29th December, 1934. However, in formal correspondence during the years 1934 and 1935 'between the then Chief Local Representative and the Political Agent, it was agreed that - (a) - All volume corrections to 60°^. are to 'be made I in accordance with the complete tables set forth in United States Department of Commerce , National - Bureau of Standards , Circula r ' No7 154. ('b) - No a'bridged tables are to 'be used in connection with royalty computations. Q SO The correspondence referred to does not disclose a qualification that superseding issues of the Volume Correction Tables of Circular No. 154 (issued May 29, 1924) would 'be used when issued. A superseding issue of the unabridged tables was issued by the United States Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, March 4, 1936 and is incorporated in their Circular C-410, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. A comparison of the tables of the two circulars reveals that the tables of the superseding issue are exactly the same as those in Circular No. 154, except that the tables have been broadened to cover a wider range of products, e.g., the former volme correction tables covered a range of oils from 10° to 99° API gravity, whereas the tables incorporated in Circular C-410 cover a range of oil from 0° to 99° API gravity. That the tables are the same except that they have been broadened is confirmed by a letter from the United States Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, dated October 12, 1940, photostatic copies of which are attached.PA-74. (5) - 2 - 5th April, 1942. As petroleum 'by-products involved in royalty conrputations include from time to time 'by-products having a gravity 'below 10° API, it is necessary for consistency and to facilitate making the royalty calculations that the tables appearing in Circular C-410 'be used. However, as formal approval was obtained for the use of the tables in Circular No. 154, the Company considers it appropriate that formal approval 'be obtained for the substitution of the tables in Circular C-410 for use in royalty computations in lieu of the tables appearing in Circular No. 154. If, in granting formal approval for the use of the unabridged tables of Circular C-410 issued March 4, 1936, you could signify your approval of superseding issues, it would obviate the apparent necessity of the Company applying for formal approval in the event of similar changes in these tables that may be made in the future. Your formal approval of the use of the tables of Circular C-410 will be appreciated. Yours very truly. ¥• P. Anderson. Chief Local Bepresentative. THE BAHREIN PETBOLEUM COMPANY LTFTTED.

Since the change of tables is a practical convenience which in no way affects the interests of His Highness the Shaikh I propose, if you see no objection, to ask the Bahrain Government for their formal assent to the change. 4. I suggest that the Bahrain Government should not be asked to approve prospectively the use of tables superseding those contained in Circular C 410.

Dear Sir, You will recall that we .lave previously discussed with you our problem of petty thieving. Under presaet conditions this problem is becoming serious even though we are exercising every reasonable precaution designed to protect ourselves against losses of this nature. For your infonuatiou, an inventory check just completed has disclosed a sharp increase in theft of automobile tires, tubes, spark plugs and even storage batteries. There have 3?een several cases where the spare tire (sometimes entire spare wneel) uas been stolen from pickups and private cars. About two months ago we stamped all tires in use on Company equipment wita the letters 3AF0C burned into the rubber at the edge of the tread and the beginning of tne side wall. 'fie are planning to likewise stamp our storehouse stock of new tires. We believed this procedure would afford a resfconable method of indentifying stolen tires. 7,0 would very much appreciate any assistance you can render, perhaps v by re-enlisting the support of the local police in locating and returning stolen property.

The tests carried out in August 1941, and which were conducted p a period of two weeks, produced no evidence of interference. These bs, like other single pieces of evidence, need not be accepted as 3lusive proof that interference does not exist. We believe, however ? n the number of such pieces of evidence, all pointing to the absence interference, that the production of water from Water Well No, 18 will affect the productivity of the natural springs. The result of the August 1941 testa together with all our orniation on the subject 9 will be compiled and submitted to you as soon possible in the form of a separate report. Then you are in possession these data you will then be in a position to further discuss the question the pipe line reservation (&amp;R-20 Parcel 25), The gauging apparatus which was installed at the two springs to ilitate the conduct of the tests has now been removed with the exception the concrete abuttments which do not interfere in any way with the flow srater.

I presume that fish trap »xl AXlacha« is the trap shown on the above map as no. Til - Allacha. During the last year when this trap was in position, the owners were prone to extend the northern wing of it past the southern boundary of the barge channel as shown by Ho.3 and ^0.4 markers. If this trap is to^ be rebuilt i suggest the owners be warned to keep the northern extremity of the trap definitely south of this boundary; likewise the owners of trap **Al Ctiazi mh* should not be permitted to encroach upon the channel right-of-way. Fish trap *Al Ghaxirah^ cannot bo identified on our maps and I would appreciate it if you would indicate its location on Drawing BR-510/2 and return to us in order that we say assign a number to the trap for our records.

Persian Gulf, E8th June, 194S, % \J i- V\o St- Dear Sir, The Company has received advice from its New York Principals regarding liftings from Bahrein over the next several months which necessitates reducing the throughput of the refinery from the present rate of S5,000 barrels per day to 20,000 barrels per day. The production of the Bahrein field will be continued for the present at 15,000^ barrels per day, the imports from Saudi Arabia ueing reduced from 10,000 to 5,000 barrels per day. It may be necessary to reduce the throughput ox this refinery still further in the future. The following is quoted from a message^ received from Mr. Herron, President of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited: 'On account of decrease in consumption all markets and failure British Oil Companies to recognise principle short haul between Bahrein and Abadan and ?loss ox markets in Australasia on account of applying principle of short haul and lend lease that territory, we expect crude running will be reduced to SO,000 barrels per day, and all cracking ^Derations discontinued over next three months and possibly for many months to come with also possibility of further reduction'. The Conroany requests that you explain this situation to His Highness The Shaikh of Bahrein and inform him that it will he necessary to shut dov.n the larger xiart of the Bahrein Refinery and ver^ considerably reduce the number of Bahrein subjects employed by the Company; also that there may be further reductions in royalty payments as a result of the above. Yours very truly, vTPA; SW THE BAHPwEIN LIMIT EDSI No,0/966 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 5th July 1942 To The Advisor to the Government Bahrain Memorandum &lt;1 The Balxrain Petroleum Company have informed me that \ since May 2nd th^y have found it necessary to reduce production from the Bahrain Oil field from 18,000 to 15,000 barrels per day. The throughput of the 'Refinery has also been much reduced, and the Company regret that they will be compelled to lay off temporarily some of the local labour employed by them. 2. The business of Oil Companies, being world-wide, is liable to be affected very markedly by unstable world cdnditions such as exist at the present time. Future prospects at present are not good, but the Company will do everything possible to ©void any further reductions in production.

The sole British interest in ther&gt;e critical times is to win the war, and all commercis interests must be subordinated to that primary objective.

My dear Peel, The Bahrain Intelligence Summary for the first half of September recorded that owing to 'reduction of markets the Bahrain Petroleum Company have curtailed production of oil to 16,000 barrels a day from the 15th September', ^elgrave, v;ho was in Delhi recently, confirmed this information and added that he^ understood that production in the California Arabian Standard Oil Company field in'Hasa was also being cut back by something like 25%. 2. It is improbable that the curtailment of production is due to any lack of market demand, considering the difficulties experienced, in building up a petrol reserve in India. then be due to a shortage of tankers, and a state of affairs which results in one-third or more of the Bahrain refinery capacity being left unused is unfortunate. Ve gather from the Commerce Department that Bahrain is getting a very fair share of tanker space'for India, and indeed the proportion of Bahrain kerosene and petrol imports in the five months April to August 1941 to total imports into this country is higher than it was in 1939. Nevertheless there remains the' fact that India is short and that the round^voyage from India to Bahrain and back is considerably shorter than it is to Abadan. And apart from this there remain (a) the claim which Bahrain as a client Arab Shaikhdom has on our goodwill, and (b) the certainty that as Ibn Saud 1 s oil royalties diminish His Majesty's Government will have to put their hands deeper in their pockets to help to keep him going. 3, it is recognised of course that everyone must suffer as a result of' tanker shortage and that Persia and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have at least an equal right to consideration. At the same time if a saving of sea-time can be effected, it would seem that there is much to be said for taking the maximum possible lift from Bahrain.

Dear Peel, In reply to your letter of the 29th December to Starling about petroleum offtake from 'Bahrain, I enclose a note on the Abadan/Bahrain position. You will see that Bahrain has suffered relatively little as a result of the tanker diversions effected hitherto in comparison with Abadan. It has actually increased its productior. in recent months, and if we were to advocate any change in the present supply ratio, we should be inclined to increase the offtake from Abadan rather than Bahrain. e feel however that in view of the changes now in progress, it would be better to postpone further consideration of the position till the whole Eastern supply situation has become more stable.

Contemplated increase in oil output from Bahrain is due to loss of Borneo production and half Dutch East Indies production, and possible interference with exports from Burma.

Thus, if Bahrain production is diverted from South Africa to India, there is no netx reduction in voyage distances over whole field. They add that numerous other factors must be taken into account, e.g. production of aviation spirit at Abadan is to some extent dependent on the maintenance of total production there at a certain figure.

February 1, 1943. 3 Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, jirein, I ir Sir: The Company has recently drilled an exploratory hole at its iker loading wharf to obtain further information regarding the geology L hydrology in this area. Also, it was hoped that sweet water might be ;ated at this point. A strata of water has been encountered in this hole which is about the same quality as Zellaq water and which could be used by ships an emergency. The hole is therefore being completed as a water well for 3 in Company operations. In this connection, the Company wishes to know;- (1) Would the Bahrein Government raise any objection to the sale of water from this well to ships? (2) Will the Bahrein Government expect a revenue from the sales of such water? For your infoimation, ships calling at Sitra anchorage which juire water are now being supplied with water transported in Dhows from source near Muharraq. This service is rendered by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie Jo.Ltd., when and at such time the necessary transport is available, at 3ost of Rs.4/- per ton. This method of water bunkering is slow and ftbersome and has resulted in numerous delays to shipping in the past. We ierstand that the situation will be more critical in the future because jws which were formerly employed by Messrs. The Petroleum Concessions Ltd., carry water to Qatar, have removed their tanks and gone into other nrices. T^e use of the proposed water well will be a vast improvement i there should be little or no delay to shipping. Our records reveal that approximately 3,120 tons of water was pplied to ships calling at Sitra anchorage during the year 1942, and that large number of ships requested water but were unable to obtain it because the necessary delay in delivery.

I enclose herewith a copy of the Company 's reply from which you will see that they are providing for the passages suggested by you. Political Agent, Bahrain.• P a P C0 Confidential Letter No.CON-116 dated 28th June 1942, In connection with this letter Mr• V /ard Anderson explained to me this morning that,of the 15 separate units constituting the 'Refinery, 0 had had to be shut down owing to the reduced demand for refined producti. 2. Mr. Anderson said that he had not yet been com pelled to discharge local labour but that it would be necess ary, in the course of the next fortnight, to dispense with th fj. f \ services of 400 Bahrainis and 20 Indians. He expected y Ghat, if the situation did not improve, another 200 Bahrainis would have to be discharged in a month's time. Mr. Anderson said that, instead of discharging their semi-permanent Bahrain! employees, the Company would like to discharge the temporary labour employed on the tank sheathing programme and replace it with their semi-permanent personnel. The difficulty is, however, tnat labourers on the tank sheathing programme receive only Rsl/- or Ps 1/2 per day while the Hefinery em ployees receive from Psl/8 to Rs2/8 per day. He proposes, therefore, to offer the semi-permanent employees temporary employment on a reduced scale of pay until such time as normal conditions are re-established. J 3.

I think, however, that article 1(a) of the Lease Deed of 29/12/34, read v/ith article 3(b) of the Deed of Further Modification dated 19/6/1940, gives the Company the right to quarry limestone in the old iTesrs-e Area as well as in the Area. Only, if the Company require to reserve any land for this purpose, they must 1 first obtain the permission of the Bahrain Government in the usual way. U Whenever the Company require to reserve any area for their operational purposes they formally apply for the permission of the Bahrain Government, since, if the land is privately owned, some form of compensation will have to be paid, e.g. in the case of fish traps etc., or certain conditions fulfilled, e.g. allowing right of way etc. On receipt of an application from the Bapco, giving, a full description of the area involved, the Bahrain Govt, issue a proclamation calling for claims, if any, v/ithin 90 days; on the expiry of this period, if there are no claims to the area in question, they agree to the reservation; or if any claimants come forward, they arrange a settlement.
