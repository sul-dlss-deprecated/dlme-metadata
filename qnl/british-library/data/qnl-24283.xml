With reference to your letter Bo. 544/V.O. of the 16th Kovr• 1927, the Diving Court closed at the beginning of the Diving Season as it had been decided, when the Court was instituted, that no divine cases should be heard during the season except those of a criminal nature. X. Ct-Ci/QJL- fyb : [ [rJ+. fan* j to cih J-Zb ti It-f' jx^U_S) 2&gt;iA^ t- (j&amp;d iHum*. . The Court which sat last year was not aB unqualified success. Innumerable complaints were made against the impartiality of the members both to me and to the H.B.M's Political Agent. I think you have some correspondence on the sub ject. Haji Abdu Ali Rajab, the only member of ! ' the court who was a man of position, never attended any meeting and when requested to do so, resigned immediately. If the Court could consist of really big • merchants and Dakhudas 1 feel sure that it 7/ould be a success but the big men of the pearl tradetrade cannot spjlare the time to sit on a court, lasting at least half the day three times a week. It was then suggested and approved by Shaikh Hamad, that 20 persons of repute, 5 Hakhudas, 5 Merchants, 5 Divers and 5 pearl merchants should form a new court and that one of each category should appear at each sitting. I enclose a list of the persons who were suggested. It was thought that this arrangement would lessen chances of prejudiced decisions. Three quarters of the members would be persons directly connected with the pearl industry, with a knowledge of diving rules, and the other quarter would be merchants of standing acquainted with local customs etc. as used on the Urfi Court. The members would attend in rotation, sitting for a week every month, under the presidency of one of the Shaikhs of the Ruling Family. The previous president was Shaikh Rashid bin Mohomed bin Isa but as he recently committed a serious assault on a Bahrani at Rafaa, flogging him very severely without any real reason, Shaikh Hamad will perhaps consider appointing somebody else in his place. At present the Bahrain Court, myself and Shaikh Salman, is hearing the few diving cases which have come up this year. When neces sary we call in a jury consisting of llhan Bahadur Abdul Rehman Zayani, Haji Abd-JL Ali Rajab and Jabar bin Uusallam for advice and assistance.-3- This arrangement has so far been successful but one cannot expect these persons to attend very frequently as they are busy men and cannot spare the time. I will bring up the whole question again with Shaikh Hamad and let you know what is arranged. I beg to remain.

And it has reached our knowledge that Iliose oe.mits have been-** usee for divin; with Bahrain people which .till ore ados to our astonishment. This is against law and justice- and contrary to existing diving easterns, hence we deemed it fair to brin the matter to your notice displaying the true situation in order to be acquainted with your opinion first and then we will take steps in the matter by ourselves as it is intoler- ableto keep silence and connive at the insult done by the person to is ana to ri ^ts y his des x tie i ana o. fspi on of reply to our letter.

M ? s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum Ref. your 73/V.O. dated 30th Jany, 1930. The Bahrain Courts have at present no cases for the Diving Court, so it has hot been summoned this year. The Bahrain Court itself settles most of the diving cases that come before it, but when expert advice is needed one or two of the diving experts are invited to assist. Would it be sufficient for your needs if the Court was asked to sit for agency and Joint Court cases once a fortnight? If so v/hat day would you prefer. Adviser to the Government., /Yo. March ^&gt;0. Please refer to /our letter No. 1537/36 of 12th Sh&amp;wal 1348. ,Ve have a considerable number of pentin^j cases for the diving’ Court including one or two which will occupy a whole sitting. A weekly sitting will be necessary, at any rate for the present. Political Agent, Bahrain.No. 5^ /3 t of 1349 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 8th Muharam, 1349 H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memo. The members of the Diving Court, as usual, have asked to be relieved fr^n their duties on it. As in previous years, and according to our proclamation, no diving cases are taken during the actual season so I proppse discharging the members after next Sunday’s sitting, or if you have no cases for Sunday I will adjourn it before then until the Guffal. Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. / ^■ snr Dear Colonel Loch, I wish to acquaint you with the unanimous opinion of a meeting held on March 8, 1934, and attended by the full mejlis Tajara, Diving Court, and various leading persons in the diving indus try who do not happen to belong to either the mejlis Tajara or Diving Court. Shaikh Salman and myself were present. 2. One of the oldest established diving rules, enforced in Bahrain, Kuwait and diving ports on the Saoudia Arabia coast is as follows. If a diver who owes money to his nakhuda is employed to dive, even for a short period, by another nakhuda and the diver is not in posses sion of a n barua t! , the second nakhuda becomes responsible to the first nakhuda for the whole amount owed by the diver to his original nakhuda and this amount he has to pay in cash. This rule prevents nakhudas from illegally employing divers who belong to another nakhuda. 3* A n barua rt is a document issued by a nakhuda to his diver permitting the diver to dive for another nakhuda. There are several kinds of baruas; they either release the diver freely with no obligation, (barua khaliya) or the D.O/ //23/3t&gt; Bahrain, March 14,1934. diverdiver is released on condition that the nakhuda who employs him pays to the original nakhuda a certain sum which is mentioned on the paper, (barua fasl) or, as is most usual, on 'Barua roba n according to which the diver receives 3/4 of his earning and the second nakhuda pays the other l/4 to the original nakhuda, Baruas are only issued for one season, ■ 4, The Bahrain nakhudas complain that this rule is not enforced in Kattar and the Trucial Coast, though it is enforced in the Bahrain Courts against Bahrain nakhudas when the complain ants are nakhudas from Kattar and the Trucial coast. 5. I suggested to the meeting that it might be possible to arrange that reciprocal action would be taken here so that if, for instance, a Kattar nakhuda made a claim against a Bahrain nakhuda for having employed a diver without a barua his case would not be heard if the rule was not applied in Kattar in favour of Bahrain nakhudas. 6. The meeting pointed out that if this arrangement was made it would be very one sided because as Bahrain is the centre of the diving industry the Bahrain nakhudas employ far more divers than their neighbours on the Trucial coast and Kattar and therefore divers of Bahrain nakhudas are far more frequently stolen by foreign nakhudas. 7. After a long discussion they unanimously requested that the Bahrain government should appeal toto the British government and request its inter vention in taking up the matter with the Shaikhs of Kattar and the Trucial coast and insist upon the rule being carried out in those places as it is in Bahrain, Kuwait and the Saoudia Arabia diving centres. Some of the people present informed us that in Shaikh Isa r s time this rule was enforced by the Bahrain government which used to seize the boats of nakhudas who employed divers belonging to Bahrain nakhudas when the boats visited Bahrain, however they all realised that in these days such unconstitutional measures could not be adopted. I will write to you separately on the other matter which was discussed at the meeting. Yours sincerely, Lieut-Colonel G. Loch, I. A., H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain.Translation of letter dated 30th Safarl354 (3.6.3bJ from Shaikn Abdullan bin ^asim al Thani ? o.i.ij., Ruler of Oatar, to the Political Agent, Banram. After Compliments. I hearu that Omar bin Muhammad al Da*im ol Oatar, who is one of my subjects, has been imprisoned at Bahrain and his boat attached in connection with an unfounded and trifling case filed against him him by Mubarak al Ammari who alleged that he (Omarj engaged his diver. The said Omar denied the plaint wnicn was dismissed because he (Omar) was T Maghtur T , that is, ne knew knowing of the position of tne diver. 1 disagreed with the filing of suits against ’Maghturs* (unaware persons) and came to an agreement with . ajor i.aly to that effect. Since that time, this practice has neither been enforced in my favour nor against me. I also ao not hold my subjects responsible lor engaging unknown divers. Similar cruel cases took place during your predecessors T time but they did not admit them. I, therefore, request you to look into this and release the said man with his boat as he is being apprehended, without any reason, in connection with a cruel case which is not based on justice and humanity. You can understand this from its precedents. Usual Unaing.To-day the two benches of the Majlis-e1-Tujarah and Ghaus gathered(only 17 out of 22 appeared). The Adviser and Shaikh Salman were also present. There were two matters put up to the Majlis for their recommendation. The first one was:- (i)'ihe question of the mortgages of proi)erty by the diving Nakhudas to the merchants, and the second matter was, (4i)The question of the divers of Bahrain subjects who go to Qatar ,Diba.i, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi for diving. 2. As the latter subject has some bearing on this Agency I thought it approx)riate to give below, for your information, a precis of what took place and decided. In the outset it was set forth that the divers of Bahrain subjects who go to Qatar and the Trucial Coast for diving and when their Bahrain Nakhudas go there claiiping their divers or their incomes from those who engaged them,he will not be given any right by the ShaiKhs of tjjiose places on the plea that the fact that such divers were indebted to Bahrain Nakhude.s were not known, and that the people of Qatar and the Trucial Coast should also receive the same treatment here whenever they may may have a matter of diving here. This suggestion, however, did not meet with the general approval of the memebers who thought that the adoption of such an attitude is undesirable and that it would seriously affect the pearling industry of Bahrain as the number of the divers of Bahrain subjects who go to those places for diving a.re far more that the number of their divers who come to Bahrain for diving. After some consultation the kajlis unanimously suggested (this was put in writing and signed by the members) that the Political Agent,Bahrain,may be requested to send letters to the Shaikhs of DibrJ., Qatar, Sharj ah and Abu Dhabi \ impressing on them to protect the rights of Bahrain subjects whose divers go to those places for diving whether they are in or without possession of barwas, and that if the divers deny their indebtedness to the Bahrain Naxhuda,the latter shoulld be made to swear when he ^toes there to establish his rights. JT • 8.3.34 P.T.O.2 - II /-v / \ The diving Law in Qatar and Oman is not exactly the same as in Bahrain. For instance the Qatar people uo not a.dmit the law of , MAGHTUR , (engaging a diver without knowing that he has a previous nakhuda) which is enforced in Bahrain and I know that the* Oman people also do not admit it. Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim ath-Thani of Qa.tar &amp;ad, on various occasions, told the P.A. that he would not admit such a claim as he thought that it was unjust to hold av\innocent person liable for a debt due from a diver who did not disclose the fact to the Nakhuda. I remejber that in certain cases which took place about five years ago the Kuler of Qatar had written to P.a. protesting about such law being enforced in Bahrain against his subjects and said that unless it was proved that the Qatar Nahhuda had intentionally engaged the diver notwithstanding that he had a previous nakhuda he was not prepared to hold the Qatari Nakhuda liable for the debt due to tne previous Nakhuda. ifi the Majlis has passed the above proposal we may get a v/ritten request from the Bahrain Government to write to the Shaikhs mentioned above a.nd would be able to see what the Bahrain Government think about the Majlis’ proposal.\ (^) t P.A. . ^ 'ki Lu* fw*—f Jp^«*JZL-, . fU* [x*. ^ KU^ (v^v Ca~c+ Ua— ^+~0-A tcO-C-4^ |v*r 1 ^ if ‘~^-' f~~ J ' ■ ' /s' i/n/i^.. I do not^ think that it is desirable at present to take up a question liKe this as we already have so many causes of friction up and dov/n the coast. And the difficulty is in a fair way to automatic solution because of the increase in the Khami s system underwhich there will=ee are no ’'serf' divers who will run away. The e is even t&amp;lk of all the diving being on the Khamis system. 17.11.34 9tb f. *1 lb Um ■■■■ © h° Letter uatea 3Uth Safar 1354 (3.6.35/ from the Ruler of 32, i^itar, to the Political ^ent, Bahrain. Cte4.AfZ S A P.A. . The case to which the Ruler of v^atar refers is attached, it was dealt with and decided in I.A. T s Court, vide proceedings dated 30.5.35 and 1.6.35. The diving practice to which the Ruler of ^atar disagrees in his letter, is being applied in Bahrain to Bahrain and foreign subjects alike, in this connection please see Adviser’s L.O.letter No*1183/36 dated 14.3.34 at page 29 and notes at pages 1, 2, 3 and 4. In his letter, the Adviser requested that the Ruler of ^atar may be asked to carry out this ruling in Qatar as is being done in Bahrain Kuwait etc., but this matter was not taken up owing to the reasons mentioned in P.A’s note dated 17.11.34 at page 3. it is not known how tne Ruler of ^atar can object to this ruling being applied against his subjects here. x 4s 7.J.35 '\ /T^ 7i?4 4 ' /p, ^ —^7 'rfu. &amp;• Y ■ /% *7 L .

Among the raised issues was the suggestion of setting up a Diving Court in Manama where it would be in closer touch with other courts. Letters were sent by the Political Agency to influential merchants and nakhudas (ship captains) asking them if they could sit in the court during diving cases. Also, because the diving law in Qatar and Oman was not exactly the same as the law in Bahrain, there was some discussion as to whether the cases concerning Bahrain subjects who went to Qatar and Oman for diving should be treated the same as those cases relating to divers from Qatar and Oman who had come to Bahrain. This was brought to the attention of the Ruler of Qatar for advice.The main correspondence is between the Political Agency, Bahrain, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) and the Ruler of Qatar, Abdullah bin Qasim Al-Thani.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Divers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
