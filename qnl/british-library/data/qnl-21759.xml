No. C/729-a/43 Dated the 12th November 1939. Itance informs me that the new range Is not likely to be ready In less than 10 days or possibly a fortnight f and this I am afraid will delay the completion of the training of the first batch on the V.B. guns* though of course they can be given further practice on the short range. 2. As it will not be possible to keep the Kevildar ins tructor here beyond the period of three months for which he was deputed to Bahrain, lance suggests that the next batch of 12 should begin their preliminary instruction as soon as possible after the Id. Perhaps the names could be selectad now and the men be deputed for this duty immediately the Jebel reliefs have been effected. 3. With this new batch I hope it will be possible for either you yourself or Shaikh Khalifah to give very definite orders to the men, in the presence of Havildar J.angha Khan, that they must carry out without question any orders given them by the Havildar on any matter pertaining to their course of instruction. I would also request, in order tc ensure the Havildar*s authority, that the two Naiks involved in the recent affair be permanently removed from the party now under instruction, irrespective of any other disciplinary action you may decide upon. 4. As I informed you verbally, lance reports from personal observation that the only man in the present batch under ins truction who is himself capable of instructing other men is the/- C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.the Baluch from Muscat; and he suggests that this man be marked as an Assistant Instructor for the training of the new batch, being given temporary N.C.O. rank for the purpose. Yours sincerely,12th November 1939. The new batch of men for training have been detailed. It is difficult at present to keep a dozen men aside for special duty, so they will have to carry on their ordinary work whenever possible. The two Naiks have been permanently removed from the first training squad. I went into their case very carefully; I found insufficient evidence to prove that they were guilty of using unsuitable language to the Havildar Instructor, all the six men protested at being ordered to go on parade in the afternoon because they knew that there was an order from me that the police should not parade in the afternoons during Ramadhan. The Havildar Instructor himself said that he knew of this order. The other three Indian Instructors we have at the Fort have no authority to arrange the time for, or order, parades without an order from myself or Shaikh Khalifah. The Muscat Baluch, who has, I believe, previous experience in Machine Guns, has only been in the Police for a few weeks. I will arrange for him to be kept on as an assistant instructor but I do not want to promote him immediately over the heads of several 'wakils' who are due for promotion in a month or two.

We are trying to get together a force of 50 Baluchis as a sort of Armed Police for duty on our anti-sabotage defence scheme* This force will be a sort of semi-military organisetior under the command of an / rmy Officer who will probably be assisted by certain number of British ex-servicemen in charge of small sections at important points. 2. What do you think the prospects are of getting some Mekrani Baluchis for a job of this sort ? They will be decently paid — Rs 25/- a month and all found, and naturally their travelling expenses to Bahrain will be met by us* I seem to remember that the Pekran Levy Corps could not absorb anything like the number of men coming forward as recruits, and if this is still so possibly some of them would like a job of this sort. And if there are any good N.C.Os who/a^e just retired * from the Levy Corps and want a job for the duration of the war we should be delighted to see them too.

No. 2255/SF Bahrain, January 17, 1940 Dear Weightman, Since Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa called on you to speak about defence measures, the Shaikhs have discussed the matter with me several times. They, and I, consider that there will be no difficulty in enlisting fifty men for special duty, during the war, at the Hefinery and the Oil Held, pro vided that we do not enforce the minimum height regulation. For a good many years we have only enlisted men of 5 T -6 M or over in the police. These men would be untrained but physically fit and with eyesight upto police standard. They would be an entirely separate unit to the police and would remain out at their posts permanently. The normal recruit course of training is six months but in the case of these men it might be reduced as they will not Hit neea##* to learn all the drill 'which the police require. The Shaikhs suggest that instead of importing someone from outside to command this force Captain Byard should take over this duty because he speaks iirabic and has experience in training and dealing with arab levies. They also consider that as the force will consist mainly of Bahrain subjects it would be suitable that a Bahrain Government official should be in charge of them. I do not know how thisthis commends itself to you. 1 think .tfyard would be suitable for the job and could carry out the work efficiently. It would be possible to make other arrangements for food control and for the work he is doing at Budeya, the latter of course is not really important. 1 think Byard would get on well with the English li.G.Gs whose appointment is under consideration. If this arrangement was approved I think it would be almost essential for Byard to live at -awali or the Jebel. Yours sincerely, H. heightman.

No* C/764-1.a/43 Dated the 9th October 1940 It looks as though we shall miss one another both here and In Karachi and so I shall have to write this letter to you about a rather inportant detail in regard to Refinery and Oil Field Protection. I think we had always agreed in principle that it would probably be necessary to have a single 'Bahrain Unit' for the anti-sabotage defence work instead of two separate units, i.e. Police and Naturs. Experience has now shown that this is inevitable If real efficiency is to be achieved. Byard, Shaikh Khalifah, BQrself and all others who have had anything to do with this particular business are satisfied on the point and it is a matter of some urgency to create this single unit at once. At the present moment there are 50 Special Police and 59 Naturs on the Job and Byard asks for a total of 116 Special Police. This small increase in the total number, with certain amendments in the standing Scheme of Defence, will enable a leave and training reserve of 16 per cent to be maintained; and I am sure that a small reserve of this sort is extremely desirable from every point of view, since it provides for minor emergencies, for sickness and for men to pay occasional brief visits to their families. 2. It is a little unfair to rush you while you are on a holiday, but I hope you will agree that the change is essential and that it should be effected with the least possible delay. It will not involve any heavy expenditure, for I understand that the Special Police and Naturs draw the same basic pay and consequently to replace Naturs by Special Police will only C.

There will also be some small initial non-recurrent expenditure on uniforms which is a matter of litcle moment. If you agree with us on these pro posals would it be too much to ask you to telegraph from Karachi to Shaikh Khaiifah instructing him to replace Naturs by Special Police immediately. I have told Shaikh Khaiifah that I am writing to you so that the briefest telegram of authority to him is all that is necessary. I am also informing Byard that I am writing to you. 5. Alwan seems to be a great success and is doing a very good job. I am not sure if you met him before you left for India, but if not I am sure you will like him when you do. Yours sincerely, L.

I have just completed discussions with local authorities and Senior Naval Officer. 2. Original appreciation of situation for defence of Bahrain expressly ruled out question of air attack or attack by sea but in view of recent raid air defence mea sures are urgently required. I appreciate that enemy plan may be to cause diversion of forces but some air defence measures are essential as there is uneasiness among local population andg rave risk of precipitating evacuation of American oil personnel with consequent loss of production. 3. I took advantage of Senior Naval Officer's presence to obtain his views regarding effective defence. He considers 8 A.A.guns 4 searchlights and appropriate equipment are required. On instructions from Admiralty he has landed 1 High Angle gun and expects 2 others shortly all of obsolescent type and as temporary measure can provide one scratch crew. There are no searchlights listening apparatus or aircraft.4. As Defence of Bahrain is your personal responsibility I request you will urgently place air defences on effective basis. Matters requiring immediate decision are (a) whether guns are to be replaced by more modern equipment (b) who is to provide officer and men for existing guns, Senior Naval Officer cannot spare men and there is no other suitable personnel available, (c) whether aircraft defnece is available. 5. Anti-sabotage arraggements also require s ome consideration. Those within refinery area are satisfactory. Those regarding outer Company areas require amendment. The specially engaged British guards have proved total failure and 5 out of 11 have already resigned or been dismissed. Company propose to discharge remainder and Bahrain Government will endeavour obtain 6 serving British police sergeants at Company expense from India to replace thenp. I recommend this and if you agree will take up matter with Government of India. 6. In addition, it is proposed to emoloy 4 Iraqi or Assyrian (preferably former) N.C.Os to strengthen patrolling. I agree and would be grateful if you could assist in find ing men. Officer already suoplied is very suitable and terms for N.C.Os could be on proportionate basis. 7. Bahrain Government have enlisted over 160 special police for protectbn and anti-sabotage work and Company are also spending over 1300 pounds per mensem. Latter are willing to provide accommodation for A.A. and searchlight personnel so far as it is available but other requirements must be met by you. Both Bahrain Government and Oil Company have done a great deal and I feel it is unreasonable to make further requests. Oil Company are already very critical of demands made on# them. 8. I appreciate that defence of Bahrain must be co ordinated with wider problems and is matter for defence / departmentsdepartments to decide, though they can of course count on our co-operation. I shall be here till November 7th and will take opportunity of your forthcoming visit to explain local feeling more fully. - Resident.^3 ' f wt. 36569/2597 1,485,000 2/38 D.P.W.

I have been in communication v/ith A.O.C.-in-Chief, Middle East, and the question of anti aircraft defstaces for Bahrain has been fully considered in relation to other pressing commitments in the Middle East. 2. As you well realise, it is quite impossible, under the conditions which exist at the present time, to '’lock-up' any fighter aircra ‘t at Bahrain, as ever/ available fighter we can spare is urgentl r required for operationsAn the Middle East and Greece. ' 3. Regarding the provision of a full A.A. gun and search light 'lay-out', as requested by you, G.H.Q., Middle East are unable to spare any equioment or personnel from Middle East resources. Even with anticipated reinforcements, A.A. defences in actual operational areas will still be inade quate. You will fully realise that there are several more pressing claims than Bahrain on the resources of the Middle Ease Command, includin' the necessity for sending, at short notice, to Crete, A.A. defences for the naval and air bases which have now been established there. 4. The authorities in the Middle East consider that, whilst the possibility of further raids on Bahrain cannot be ruled out, they are now, perhaps, less likely in view of IttfLy’s increased commitments. A.A. defence measures which can be taken at Bahrain at the present time, cannot, there fore, be more than token defences. 5. The two A.A. guns which have recently been landed at Bahrain will provide some degree of protection. The diffi culty is the provision of crews to man them. I have sent an 'Immediate' signal to Air Ministry to as v them if they can obtain crews from the Admiralty, War Officer, or from India. If they cannot help I am prepared , as I told you, to send some ’Ir; q Levies, a few of whom may have some ex perience of gunnery - a relic of days long ago, when the Levies included a pack battery. 6. I have asked Captain Cosmo Graham to let me know the numbers which wold be required , and on receipt of his reply will arrange for the men to be earmarked ready to go ‘tec to Bahrain at short notice if exoerienced crews are not available from elsewhere. In accordance with your suggest ion, they woul i be sent by air to avdid delay over exit visas, etc. I have already sent to Basrah a mobile search light, mounted on a lorry, which is to be embarked on the next ship due to call at Bahrain. It is expected that the ship will leave Basrah at the end of this week. This search light will have to be manned by personnel of L.D.Vs, since I have no men to spare for this purpose. These must be many men belongin * to the Oil Company who are fully qua lified to operate it. The Honourable Political Resident, PERSIAN GULF.f . * . p - 2 - 7. Regarding the question of British guar's specially recruited by the Company, the Air Ministry state ’ ^® r ' V finitely in their signal X.683 of 12th January, 1940 , (which was repeated to you) that they could not consider enlisting men in H.M .Forces for this purpose. It involved ’’serious difficulties, in particular those of divided cr ntrol an.i tne use of British Forces at the expense of a foreign comoany, for the orotection of private property” It is unlikely the t this decision will be reversed. The alternative su ? |ested by Air Ministry at that time has obviously failed, and l welcome your proposal to approach India and ask them to provide six British police sergeants to replace the existing guards. 8 I hav# 1 called for the names of four volunteer Arab Levy N.C.Os who are willing to tak? their discharge and trans- fer' to the special police force at Bahrain. Though you did not specify ’’’Iraq Levies ” I presume these are the men you want. I anticipate a delay of a few weeks in obtaining the approval of the ’Iraqi Government, through the ritish Embassy, as it took some months to persuade them to release the ex-Levy officer Alwan. Every conceivable difficulty was placed in the way - mainly, I believe, because the Iraqis resented the fact that a Levy had been as)ed for rather than an I* Iraqi policeman. However, I will adk the .M^bassy to do their best to hurry this matter up. I presume that tra velling expenses from Basrah will be paid by the Bahrain Government. Also that free accommodation and rations at Bahrain will be provided for these men, and that, as in tne case of the officer already supplied, their existing ^^es of pay will be subject to an increase of 25% from the date of their embarkation at Basrah. One of the recommendauions made by my representative, Major Rose, after his visit to Bahrain at the beginning of xhx jqwx October, was that some link was definitely required between the native officer ilv/an and the ’’other ranks' of the police, and I am only too anxious to find suitable men for this purpose. 9, Major Rose also tells me that he asked the Political Agent (Mr. Weightman), to press the Bahrain Government to increase the strength of the special police force as, with only 11C men, the duties were so heavy as to preclude eiti- ciency and any chance of training. 1 am glad to note that the Bahrain Government now intends to increase this force to 160, which should suffice. 10. Regarding the L.D.Vs, I would be glad if you would^ tell the Political Agent that we have asked higher authoriuy (a) if Americans can be enrolled, (up to about 20). (b) If a Havild- r instructor can be sent to Bahrain from India so that one or more Indian platoons can be enrolled, (up to about 5C men). and (c) If an assistant British Junior N.C.O. Instructor can be sent from India to assist the prosent permanent sta 'f instructor who, owing to the difficulties of shifts, is now somewhat overworked This is in‘accordance with suggestions made by the Political Agent to Major Rose on 12 October. There has been some delay in obtaining qunoment ^cr this force but this matter is gradually x± righting itself, and I hope that the L.D.Vs will soon become a real live force, 11. In concludion, I would like to say how much I regret the /-the fact that, with regard to A.A. defences, it is not oossi ble to meet your requirements, except in a very slight degree, but, unfortunately, the resourues at our disposal in Middle East will not permit of this at the oresent t^me. 12, I would be glad if you would explain the situation to Mr. Lipp. I am sending a xopy of this letter to the A.L.O. and S.N.O., P.G.

The Bahrain Government while anxious to see t establishment of adequate defence of the Oil Field and Refinery against sabotage are not fully satisfied that such a large body of men is required. The strength of the Force was based on Major Rose’s recommendations but this Agency has no record of how he arrived at the figure of 166. 3.

Dated the 9th December 1940• ajo You will remember that we discussed the question of the terms to be given to the four Junior N.C.Os from the Iraq Levies who were to be taken on as instructors with the Bahrain Special Police. I have now been handed a communication from Air Headquarters to say that these men can be made available at once and that they will retain their lien on their permanent posts with the Iraq Levies. The conditions on which these men will be released for sen/ice in Bahrain are that the Bahrain Government will provide for the full cost of maintaining them, travelling expenses, uniform allowance (they will wear their Iraq Levy uniforms during service in Bahrain), contribution towards gratuity on completion of Levy service which in the case of lance corporals drawing proficiency pay amounts to ID 13.500 per year. The Bahrain Government will also be liable to pay disability compensation (at the same rate pre sumably as wdbH be paid in Iraq). The period of their detach ment, the communication states, is not yet settled but would not be less than six months. Air Headquarters request informa tion as to whether the Bahrain Government agree to these terms and whether 25 per cent additional pay would be given and whether Levy uniform may be worn. They also wish to have an assurance that the detachment of these men will not result in financial loss to the Royal Air &gt;orce or to the men concerned. 2. I should be grateful if you would kindly let me know as soon as possible what reply I should give. There is also mention of contracts in the communication. I do not know whether Alwan Effendi has a contract with the Bahrain Government but if he has, these men will presumably have similar ones.

It has been decided to attach 4 junior N.C.O.s from the Iraq Levies for a period of at least 6 months. These men will be relieved at the expiration of this time by other Iraq Levies, if necessary. The object is to train the local Defence police, and in particular to train men who will later be suitable as N.C.O.s. These N.C.O.s are also to be used for supervisory duties under the direction of the Arab ex- Levy Officer now serving with this force. The questions of pay etc., have been agreed to by the Bahrein uovernment (13-12-40). These men are to be sent to Bahrein by air at the earliest possible opportunity. The men should take v.ith them full equipment (less anti-gas respiratorp and bedaing. It is advisable for the senior to be given the acting rank of Sergeant on arrival (as 2nd-in-command to the Arab Officer). The remaining three should be made acting Corporals. These acting ranks need not affect the question of pay. The P. Adviser has agreed that the men should receive their present rates of pay plus 25%,free accommodation and rations (Action by S.P.S.O and O.C. Iraq Levies). n ece s s it y, for extra police for the B ahrein Dofence Pol ice 24.. At present, only 50 of the police are 'regulars”. 50 or 60 are natoors who have been employed for some time with ! the force and about 50 are natoors who have been employed only recently. The final numbers actually required for this force can only be judged after experience. It will probably bebetween 120 - 150. In the meantime ''regulars' should be increased to 110 men. These should be given uniform, and specially trained . The balance required, up to the present total numbers employed, may be found from natoors, the best of which can be enlisted in the force later, when the estab lishment is increased. The Political Adviser agreed but pointed out the difficulties of obtaining suitable uniform locally. He promised to do what he could to ensure that the force of 110 Defence Police was given uniform, including some form of warm clothing for wear during the winter months. He agreed that it was desirable for the D.O. to control en listments and discharges in this force. It was agreed that in order to avoid confusion and to discriminate between this force and the 'metropolitan police', the special police force might be called in future the 'Bahrein Defence Police Force'. The D.O. is to consider whether this is the most suitable title, and to inform A.H.Q. of the final decision reached, in due course.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

It is fully appreciated that the oil industry is vital to the prosperity of Bahrain and that if oil production ceased the revenue of the State would immedi ately shrink to a very small amount which would make it impossible for the administration to be carried on as it is at present. It is also realised that the Bahrain refinery and oil field is of immense importance to the allied forces especially since the loss of the oil centres in Burma and the East Indies. 3. Since the beginning of the war the Bahrain State has met the entire cost of a Special force of 150 local2 The cost of maintaining the Special Police, since they were enlisted, has amounted to approximately Rs.l,40,000/-. 4. At the time when the State undertook the financial responsibility for the Special Police its revenue was considerably greater than it is today. The income of the State from customs receipts has decreased very seriously and the oil royalty has fallen off and there appears to revenue in 1358 (1939) was Rs.45,78,000/- and the revenue for the first six months of this year is Rs.20,30,000/-. 5. His Highness Shaikh Salman^ike his father before him / has shown himself consistently anxious to contribute in every way towards the successful outcome of the war. At present several of the Departments of his Government are engaged in work for the military forces in Bahrain. But the revenue of the State is declining and any relief from abnormal expenditure would be appreciated. I under stand that measures for the protection of the refinery and the oil field are to be paid for by the British Govern ment.

GOVERNMENT D.0.No.1388/SF-51/16. Bahrain, August 1, 1942. With reference to Hewitt’s letter to you regarding camel Police, the suggestion presents many difficulties. The only camels available belong to His Highness and few of them are trained for riding. Our own camels were all provided by His late Highness Shaikh Hamad. I very much doubt whether there are many or any men accustomed to camels in the Special Police. Saddles are unobtainable here, ours were bought from the Frontiers Districts Administration in Egypt, we have had them for many years and have no spares. I have tried having them copied here but without success, the proper type of wood is not available. It is possible to get materials locally for making girths, bridles etc., though they are not as lasting as the imported material. Personally I think there would be no ’’political effect” if such a section was started. Camel food is now a very difficult problem and we are giving our animals beans instead of millet. If camel patrols are necessary, in addidtion to our own, I think it would be better to increase the existing camel section of the State Police rather than to start a new camel section. To do this it would be necessary to obtain more new saddles and equip ment which the State would be glad to purchase if could be made available in Egypt or Iraq.I think His Highness would be willing to provide the State Police with some more camels but I am not so sure that he would agree to giving 20 camels for the Spe cial Police. If 20 men are required the force would need at least 25 camels. I think I could find some more men who could be trained as camel police but they would require some ordinary training first.

Sir, With reference to the enquiry in your letter No. C/1147 dated the 1st August, 1942, I have the honour to inform you that the approximate^monthly recurring expenditure borne by the Bahrain Government in main taining the Special Police force guarding the refinery and oil field is Rs. 6,600/-. I give below a statement showing how this sum is arrived at:- Pay Rations 4250 1824 6074 Clothing and other supplies, approx: Contingencies 450 50 500 6,574 .

The Hon 1 ble the Political Resident in the Persian 9ulf, Bushire. Memorandum. I forward herewith a copy of a letter Ho.l300-51/3F dated 15th JUly 1942 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government 2. The force of special police now being paid for by the Bahrain Government were recruited at the request of the Defence Officer, and their duties have been in the past, and still are, confined exclusively to guarding the oilfield and refinery. Recurring expenditure on this force, borne by the Bahrain Government, amounts at present to approximately fe 6,600/- per mensem. 3. The Adviser, in his letter enclosed, only asks that the Bahrain Government should be relieved in the future of the financial burden which maintenance of the special police force places on them. But if His Majesty's Government have accepted in principle responsibility for meeting charges incurred on defence measures at oil fields and refineries, it would seem that the Bahrain Government would be justified in claiming also a refund of money expended by them in the past on the protectio. of the Bahrain oilfield and refinery. 4. As 1 do net know what decision has been reached in other parallel cases I am net in a position to make any specif! recommendations on tn* Advisor's letter. If, however, the Iraq and Iran Governments have been relieved of the responsibil ity of financing special protective measures at the oil fields in their respective territories, I suggest that it would be | invidious to deny to the Bahrain Government, merely because they have spontaneously cooperated with the British authorities in carrying out their defence programme, a similar measure of financial assistance.co:: ir-: . ti. l llo.r.O.

The Bahrain Government obtain a very large income from the oil fields and incur no expenditure in connection with them, except on the maintenance of the Special Force which forms the subject of your memorandum under reference. In Persia, altnough the Anglo—Persian Oil Company employ some guards of their own the general responsibility for the protection of the oil fields rests with the Persian Government and I know they had to employ some of their regular troops at Gach Sarcn last Spring to beat off a tribal attack. The same was undoubtedly the position in Irac before our occupation, ’/nether our troops have now taken over the responsibility for the entire protection of the oil fields I do not know but i am encuiring. If they have done so it is probably because the local forces are not trusted. 3. It is true the British Government are under taking responsibility for all expenditure incurred on the oil fields on account of camouflage, , lug^in^ , junking, etc., at any rate for the time being, but I am inclined to think that the Bahrain Government ought to continue to accept responsibility for the policing of the oilfields anc refineries and that it would create a bad impression if I were to represent that they are unwilling to incur further expenditure on this account. 4 . i have spoken to ''r.

Last May there was a mutiny in the State Police of which the Special Police are a branch over the question of pay. This resulted in thedismissal of a number of the State Police. By a happy coincidence, a Company of the R.A*P Levies was being disbandedat the time, so replacement was simple. The Special Police were not affected. 5. Ten days ago the Arab Ofrioer in charge informed me that the Special Police had stated that they did not *ant to work any moreunless they got more pay etc. 6. I interviewed them and found that their main grouse was the expense of going to and from their homes on their weekly day off (about 14 miles). ?• I consulted the Commandant State Police, C.Dalyrymple Belgrave i^sq, C.B., Advisor to H.H. The Ruler of Bahrein, and we ag reed that it was fair to allow them Bus tickets onoe a week. 9. Later on, the Arab Officer came and informed me that they ■■w not satisfied with the Tickets, but demanded a rise in pay of Rs 5/-* 10* I arranged for Mr Belgrave to interview them and he told them very firmly he would not consider any further increase other than the issue ofBus tickets* At the same tjume he brought to their notice that all men, on completion of 2 years service if they were efficient, were entitled to an increase of Re 3/— per month (their normal pay is Rs 25/— plus rations and quarters). After a certain amount of talk they stuck out for Rs 5/- increase. 11. Mr Belgrave agreed that the case was not *rny» It may be poin ted out that the Bahreini has no military sense of duty or discipline, and dismissal or imprisonment are not regarded as Social disgrace. 12* I then informed the Company on Parade (this was on 12 October) that they were to carry on with their work and that I would consider their case at the end of the month as to whether they would be disbanded en-bloc or not. They fell out and carried on with their work satisfactorily.* 13. 14. 15. A - 16 . DLW.

I consider that in view of the peculiar mentality of the Bah reini that this out-burst may be overlooked on this occasion, out I would suggest for consideration that the R.A.y Levies here might be leased with a view to taking over these Police duties should another incident occur until such time as it would be possible to increase the Regular Garrison. I feel that the work will be carried out alright, but it is important now, in view of a very big Construction Programme being carried out, that Anti-Sabotage measures are not rel axed. In conclusion, I give it as my opinion that these Police would have little real fighting value. J'i , \A ^ . Lieut Ool. Defence Officer. (H.T.Hewitt) Copy to:- H.B.M. Political Agent.

Sir I have the honour to enclose a copy of a report with which I have been furnished by the Defence Officer Persian Gulf, regarding what he rather inaccurately describes “mass indiscipline u by the Bahrain Special Police. 2. I have discussed this matter with tar. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E., the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and also with Lieutenant Colonel H.T. Hewitt, to.C., the Defence Officer. I gather that the matter was not quite so serious as might be thought from a perusal of the enclosed report. 3. It seems that the Special Police did not in any way refuse duty, nor did they threaten to refuse duty. They petitioned for an increase in pay and stated their desire to resign at the end of a month if their request was not granted. They gave no indication of what action they would take if their request was not granted and they were not allowed to resign. 4. The Adviser and Lieutenant Colonel H.T. Hewitt saw the men and discussed their grievances with them. The introluction of a system of good conduct pay and the provision of free conveyance weekly between Awali and Manama appear^ to have contented them and I think it unlikely that there will be any further demand for some time to come. Although Lieutenant Colonel H.T. Hewitt is probably correct in considering the special Police of little fighting value they do fulfil their function which is to act as e^tra police on the oil works areas.

Major T.Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, Bahrain Special Police I have the honour to refer to my letter No.C/1425 dated the 26th October 1943 and to inform you that Lieutenant Colonel H.T.Hewitt, M.C., the Station Commander Bahrain called on me on May 28th to discuss the future of the Bahrain Special Police. 2. The Station Commander stated that the personnel of the Bahrain Special Police had been enlisted lor a period of four years in the autumn of 1940, that the term of their service was approaching its end, and that he was convinced that a very small percentage of the men would be prepared co re-engage for a further 1 period of service. It seems that the work is uncongenial to a certain number while many others are attracted by the nigh rates of pay now being offered by industrial concerns operating in the Islands. The Station Commander stressed the fact that he was res ponsible for the safeguarding of the refinery and considered that action should be taken either to guard against mass resignations from the Special police in the autumn or to provide on alternative defence organisation. 3. It seems that the Special Police have not proved parti cularly satisfactory and the Station Commander would prefer to be able to dispense with their services altogether. He asked me whether I saw any objection to a suggestion which he proposed to make to the Area Commander at Basrah to the effect that in the autumn of this year when as I have said before the majority of the Police will have completed their period of engagement they should be disbanded and replaced by an Indian Garrison Company,a lways /providedprovided of courso that an Indian Garrison Company was available for duty in Bahrain, I informed the Station Commander that I saw no objection whatsoever to his suggestion. In fact it seemed to v be much more satisfactory than endeavouring to coerce the Special Police into re-engaging for a further period of years. 4. The replacing of the Bahrain Special Police lay an Indian Garrison Company would relieve the Bahrain Government of n heavy financial responsibility and at the same time would release some one hundred and fifty men for employment elsewhere. An Indian Garrison Company being £ disciplined force subject to Indian Mili tary Law would be more easy to handle than the Gpocicl Police and there would be no likelihood of a recurrence of the difficulties of last autumn which formed the subject of my letter- under reference* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, / /A * * Political Agent, Bahrain.No. 582-3 3 &amp; C R hi T British Residency &amp; Consulate'General Bushire, the 14th June 1944.

GEOFFREY PRIOR ATTE3TED Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. &gt;r Secretary to the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf.n- J.O.No.C/1083. Political Acency f Bahrainj 18th July* 19**4. V My dear Sir Geoffrey, / Please refer to C.H.Q. Paiforce Secret letter No.1317/0(0) dated the 2nd July, 1944. I have put forward informally to Belgrave and the Station Commander the outline of a scheme to prevent the Special Police dropping below strength and thereby ensuring that the force con tinues to discharge its function without the need arising for compulsion. 2. I gather that the Bahrain Government has been reluctant to increase the wages of the Special Police without introducing a general increase, since this would arouse discontent. At the same time they are reluctant to compel the Special Police, many of wh.cse contracts will shortly begin to expire, at a con siderable rate, to stay on in service. Belgrave is prepared to exert what pressure he can and has been coming round to the view that compulsory service may have to be insisted upon. He has also maintained to Major Hickinbothan that the Shaikh also shows more signs of coining round to this view, though he is . changeable. 3. However, to obviate these various difficulties, I suggest that service in the Special Police be put on a basis of volun tary service for one year only and that pay be increased by about Rs.6/- or Rs.7/- per man per month. This would be a sort of 'outstation” allowance to compensate for having to live out near Awali which is something of a hardship. All vacancies which, arise from now on through the expiry of engagements will be filled by special selection from the ranks of the ordinary police, the man whose engagement expires retaining the right, however, to appear before the selection board (composed of, say, The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /Belgrave, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2 Belgrave, the Commandant of Police (Shaikh Khalifah) 9 and the Station Commander)for re-appointment, if suitable, I suggest, as a sop to seniority and to avoid discontent, that the right to appear before the selection board be offered to the ordinary police in order of seniority but that the appointment will be made on merit only and subject to the approval of the Station Commander. This should ensure that unsuitable though senior non are kept out while at the same tine their claims will be considered. The whole arrangement should enable the Bahrain Government to honour their obligation to the men to release then on termi nation of their agreements. 4. Belgrave thinks that this scheme should work well. \ &gt; He agrees that an increase of about fs.6/- should prove a good inducement and that the throwing open of the service to all police will eliminate discontent. It should also attract a better type. The Station Commander also generally agrees with the proposal. The Special Police do not receive markedly better training than the ordinary police (perhaps we should insist that they dol) and he does not think there would be any lose of efficiency. If the scheme works well efficiency would of course increase. 5. As to who is to pay for the increase in wa^es, I suggest that the yearly cost, which would not be more than, say, fo. 12,000/- to Hs. 15,000/-.per annum, should be net by PaIFORCE. The amount is small when considered as an alternative to the cost of keeping troops here. The Shaikh may rightly expect that he should not be asked to pay the extra amount. 6. All this is only exploratory and I would like to know your views before going any further. I am frankly hesitant in exposing my newcomers views to the light of your experience but I hope you will agree that the idea is at least worth con sideration.

Recommendations to solve the problem include: replacement of the Special Police by an Indian Garrison Company, rejected on the grounds of an overall lack of manpower in the Indian Army; that a one-year contract extension with pay rise be offered to Special Police officers; a transfer scheme to enable Bahrain State Police to transfer to the Special Police (copy of police order announcing the transfer scheme, ff 107-110);in August 1945, correspondence relating to the disbandment of the Bahrain Special Police, including confirmation from the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), dated 12 September 1945 (f 120) that the Company has no objection to the discontinuation of the Special Police.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Station Commander, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Defence Officer, Persian Gulf</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Defence Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military recruitment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Security of property</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil defence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000032#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
