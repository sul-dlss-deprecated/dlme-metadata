Much of the correspondence relates to potential issues that this proposed increase could cause with the United States of America and France due to treaties those two countries previously agreed with the Sultan of Muscat.In addition to internal correspondence between British officials, the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with US and French diplomats and one letter in Arabic (with English translation) from the Sultan of Muscat, Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd(folios 52-53).In addition to correspondence, the file contains the following documents:'Note on the Financial Aspect of Our Policy [in Muscat]' 1928 (folios 5-6)'List of the monthly allowances paid by the Muscat Govt. to the Frontier Shaikhs. 1927' (folio 48)Draft revised treaty between the United States of America and the Sultan of Muscat (folios 120-121).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000289#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000289#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
