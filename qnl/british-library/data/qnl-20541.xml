The Shafaq's eoaaent is that Mis IfaiJesty is hiaself the expressicm of the thoughts and of the Ideals of both Majlis and people, and therefore no one can conceive the least separation between the Shah and his govern'sent. 0» the 17th January the evening paper 'Ittili'lt', published a statesent tnat onsieur Veyaourtache'waa confined, under surveillance, in his own ' house* rots thence forward the press has unanimously and progressively begun to abuse the former Minister of Court.

The points specially singled out for ridicule are the following:^) the statement that twenty aeren thouaand eaployees of the Anglo- Persian Oil Coapany would auoh rather serr® the Coapeny than their own gowernaent; (b) the acocmnt of the refusal of the Persian Governaent to allow the performance of a oertaia play at the olub of the Coapanyi (c) the account of the refusal to deliwer letters to the Gonsul-Qeneral, Su shire, if they are aarSted 'eiplomstio a«f*ee«atatlwe'| (d) the statement that all His iiajesty's Government 's efforts to establish good relations end in misunderstandings and are interpreted as signs of weainesa on the part of His Majesty'i Gowernaent. The writer of the ''Shafat* article, in respect of (d), askis 'What efforts have the British Governaent made to collabernte with the Persian So*erna«»t 'i ^ 'What Persian considers the British Oorernment to be weak', and •men hare we claimed to be superior to cthersV*. In conclusion, the writer repeats the well-too wn argument /thatthat the point at Issue Is whether th« Sritiate Qoverameat Mb the right to intepyene Is an Internal dilute of whieh Persia itself is the sole coapetent judge. 8. All Tehran papers fro® that date onwards have devoted aost of their front pages to the Oil dispate. the 'shafaft* of the 85rd January expresses great surprise at the teaporary adjournment of the aeetiag of the League Council, at the request of the sritish aovernaent. 'Bad the Persians asked for an adjournment',says the paper, •we can Just imagine what the aritish papers would hawe eaidj they would hawe addaoed the faot as showing that the ;ersiaas had no proofs to offer', 9. ae •Ittili'it'* of the 2Srd criticises an article in the 'Daily telegraph'. the first stateaent in that article was that the Persians were evidently wery proud of theaaelwes; the reason being, perhapSf that the cospliaentary speeches made at the recent Kxhitoition of Persian Art in London had given tho« exalted ideas of their own importance.

'Ihat if fersla should publish to the world the deplorablo truth about the parlous state of Britain, shown toy its abandonment of the gold standard, by the fall of the value of the pound, the steadily increasing unoaployment, the clamour of all British eolonies to be relieved of the yoke of oppression, etcetera, etcetera'*, *hc saas issue has a long article from the pea of a certain oaeed t.ima uaficy (brother of the lawyer who receives a retainer fro» the Anglo-i'ersian Oil Coapany and the author of the recent toistory of Bahrein froa the earliest tiaes) consisting of two and a half colaans of concentrated abuse of the British, dese itoiog the« as the most vain, the most egotistical, the proudest, and the greediest race in the world f including even criticisas of their table manners. 1 enclose a copy of this effusion as a literary curiosity, ii. me n oohsish' of the 8Sth January continues to call attention to the false statements appearing in the British press; showing that these aust indicate the weakness of the British case.

The 'sitareh-Wahia' of the sane date tons s leading article devoted to the discussion of the probable attitude of the various members of the l^eague Council. /Up,f Extract from th© tt wixafaQ.-i-^ur]£h' t Ho. 0265 of the 16t&amp; January, 1933s- In an article entitled ^fe and the Quarrelsome Bad Clamblers** the writer, who signs himself 'Soldier on pension 1 # tries in most involved and cautious language to explain the present agitated state of the world and European politics which ia bound to end soon or late in a war yet fiercer and more devastating than the Great War# In this sense he regards the various attempts at disarmament In Europe, while armaments are 'being increaeed and perfected da:/ and night, as so many attempts to delude the simple- minded people of the ast who are the sole victims and the prey of all these infernal preparations. Dim but steady signs of awakening among the people of the Last have more than irritated the polticians of the colonising cowers who are doing their best to devise means to make such movements in the East subside, by the creation of new sources of animosities between them or by fostering old lurking sources of hatred. The next generation in Persia and in the world will probably be the witness of this great scene of human slaughter, as within another 20 to 50 years the present economic depression will disappear and once more European Powers will have a free hand to bring to action the designs so far fostered and perfected. Unless more patriotic and combined efforts are made by the Persian people for their own protection, unless the feeling prevalent since 150 years ago in this country whereby all foreigners are adored and virtually assisted in their designs against our country, unless higher moral standards of national courage, consistency and solidarity are displaced, the Persian people will be the first victim of the next onslaught of Europe which is bound to come. /Complete- 2 - 7 Complete solidarity between t &amp;e Governiaent and tlie people, their mutual and unreserved cooperation end full end active control of all national resources by toe Government, in war as in peace, are the essential conditions necessary for our protection# The outburst of the great calamity which is bound to occur one day will find ue in a state of helplessness and humility with our Imagined fortresses, precautions and preparations# lo prayer or sorcery will avail us# The insurance of the nation against all such calamities is the army and nothing else, and we cannot possibly look at the army preparations, expansions, perfections and requirements with suspicion or neglect or ill-will. Full cooperation between the people and the army is essential. If a soldier loses one round of ammunition by error in the Baluchistan wildernesst the effects of this will inevitably be felt in the arsenal of the army where 901 of their w /orkers and technicians are civilians and belong to the people. Or when 2nd Lieutenant Feda-i han (a fictitious name) of the garrison of Sarakhs wishes to change the thread-bare puttees of his men with new ones, the effects of this action will be felt in the weaving factories which are run by civilians and manned by civilians Even if we institute Government factories for such purposes, the majority of their workers are bound to be civilians. Likewise, all the zeal and effort of an Amir Lashgar will produce no effect if he considers 500,030 rounds of ammunitions for his guns as essential for the future emergency and if he finds that none of the components of these amnmnltions are to be found in the country, or that there are no adequate means of transport for the easy and prompt conveyance of these explosives, or that the roads are not sufficiently carrossable and metalled. He, /therefore.10 therefore, cm the decisive da/ f will not put his whole heart iato his work* Full centralisation of the national efforts, both military and civilian, perfect good -will between the two and mutual realisation of each others' abilities and resources are considered easmtial 'bj all 0en®ral staffs of the amies of the world. These feelings and precepts were recognised by our aacastore long ago# fhe present Is a golden riXESS^bg opportunity for the Persian nation which i© now confronted with the vital struggle for existence and is full of eagerness for progress and grandeur# ae agitated and perturbed Europe and its brawling 'baa gamblers may take away thle opportunity from us before long and tnon all our toilinga will only end in our am aeetraction# lo foreign propaganda however droitly directed, no insinuation of treacherous Persians instigated and paid by forei^iers, should rElsguiue ua towards perfidy or aivulgiag the aecret© of our Oovernment. foreigners will bring blow upon blow upon us* But it ie mnly and virile to receive a blow with courage and to do ons f s best to get up and deal a blow. Bay, this country and nation in the torpor of opiuia, long breathed and injected into them, needs sany blows and much adversity and punishment in order that it shall arise from its age-long apathy and sleep* the writer concludes this article with a quatrain which he considers as the panacea and. sorcery formulae for all Persian diaeaaes f and which may be translated as follow©:- A wise man who saw me asleep told sie when X woke xgtssM up that it is no good to sleep in this world when you will have sleep ay much as you liXe in the OI&amp;THJ■II Stxraot frora toe abafaqrl-Sorltii of Uoaday, 2Sra Janueepy, 1933.

Lord Our&amp;on is one of the prominent examples of this vice* He never bothered to go to the bottom of anything and committed blunders which no Arab or £urk child would have committed. His idle talk fell below the standard of that of any lussiaa or Bulgarian worker. Me wrote things that no Illiterate person would have written. iSnglish people belong to two categoriesi a- those who have never gone out of treat Britain and among these people one comes at times across persons of upright, just and enlightened tendencies, and b- those who have lived in British colonies and the especially in India. fhey are'* shame of toaanity and a taint on the body of human civilisation. the englishmen who® we come across in Feral* belong generally to this benevolent category. All children of 17 or 18 aspire in Great Britain to go to India for fame and wealth and after two years of service in the civil or military departments of that country they add to their selfish and intolerant character a senile of oppression, tyranny, boisterousness and hypocricy, and British politics in Asia are unfortunately in the hands of persons of this category. fhere are two or three books written about the activities of Colonel Lawrence which show in their true light all British officials As an example we may cite Sir Benison xoss, one of the /In&amp;lish- 5 - 1} English Orientalists who ma a claim to mil ec lentif ic researches of man and to mil languages# t¥hen he was coming to Persia four years ago iie bad an interview in Bgypt with repreaentatives of locsO. preaa.

The subject is one which requires copious discussion, but the point is clear to us, as to all unbiased historians, that Persia has always been a bulwark for world civilisation ana peace and a means of preserving the equilibrium between the West and the Jast. We can at last say to areat Britain that we have always done her good turns rather than having had good turns from her, and our usefulness to her is due to our national characteristics which she and her people lac&amp; f namely, generosity and sacrifice for others, equity of Judgment and self negation for the cause of Humanity.

Persian reply to case cf His Majesty^ Government in the Anglo-Persian dispute (Persian print 19 Decernber 19th section 1) was communicated to Secretary-General January 18tb. First part consists of series of unjustified accusations against the Company such as alleged non-payment of royalties, refusal to agree to arbitration on previous occasions, failure adequately to develop oil resources of Persia or employ due proportion of Persian suhjects, etc. After disputing validity of a smitten(sic) agreement it gives wholly misleading account of negotiations of 1931-1932 and represents cancellation as due to Company's intransigeant attitude. Main argument then follows that Company has not exhausted Legal remedies in Persia and that dispute cannot he regarded as of International character or suitable for reference to League. On January 24th Council appointed representative of Czecho-Slovakla as RaDPorteur and on January 26th Secretary of State made long speech controverting all Persian points exposing misstatements of Persian Memo randum and showing that nc remedy could exist in Persian Courts as cancellation had become Persian Law while Persian Governments notes cancelling concession and thereby destroying arbitration machinery provided there under for settlement of dis -nutes ha- deprived Company ofof the only proper means of redress, Laver in reply reverted to various points in the It (UMjHi' original case of His Majesty's Governmeitt/that Company should have had recourse to Persian Courts and made further misstatements which Secretary of State subsequently disposed of regarding Company's conduct etc. Persian representative made no reference to possible conciliation and did not withdraw^challenge to competence cf Council to deal with dispute,. Rappcrteur asked for interval to study the, Question and to consult the parties before reporting to Council. Benes informed United Kingdom delegates on 27th January that Persians appeared ready to consider question of re-opening of negotiations with Company on some agreed basis. He himself fully realised that if Company were regarded as having no concession negotia tions would be impossible as Company would be at the mercy of Persian Government who could dictate their termsr It was essential therefore that negotiations should be on the basis of equality and he was hopeful that Persian delegates might be brought degrees to accept suitable formula^ Benes has been informed cf views of His Majesty's Government as to general lines on which necessary basis might be found. It should in particular be provided that during interval for negotiations and until Question is finally settled either by agreement or by decision of Council Company is to carry on its operations as heretofore on the basis that these operations are being conducted under concession of 1901. Meanwhile rights of both parties would be reserved without prejudice to issue (which will have tp bete decided by Council if negotiations fail) whether Persian Government were entitled to claim to cancella tion of concession. Banes is now seeing Persian delegates and conversations are being actively pursued.

' It is the donor's desire that the present i Director of Medical Services at Stoke Park Colony, Stapleton, Bristol (Professor R. J. A. Berry) shall be in a position of responsibility with regard to the research work to be undertaken. In view, however, of the national importance of such re search, active steps are being taken to form a committee of management and direction so fully representative of the public interests concerned as to ensure that so generous a gift to the nation shall worthily serve the purpose for which it is intended—the advancement of medical knowledge and the relief of mental disorder and suffering, THE FORGED AUSTRIAN NOTES - s for the shipbuilding industry is also good news for other industries because, it is estimated, shipbuilding orders provide work for two men outside the shipyard for every one engaged on the actual building.

I brought conversation to Anglo-Persian Oil Company by mentioning impending visit of Company f s representatives and His Majesty said that there was no desire to quarrel with us as was proved by attitude of Persian Government since cancellation but he feared that disposition cf His Majesty's Government was unfriendly, I told him I did not think that it was realised here how urgent and grave the crisis threatening Oil Industry had been c Action of Persian Government in inviting Company to embark on negotiations last Spring might with some exaggeration be compared to landlord inviting tenant to discuss method of paying his rent when house was on fire. Both His Majesty } s Government and Company desired good understanding and hope of His Majesty ? s Government that Persia would prosper and be a stable element in World was unchanged., Apart from all other considerations our interests lay^ in that direction. I asked whether His Majesty was not perhaps attaching excessive importance to criticisms in Press regarding cancellation of con cessions,. He replied that he attached no great importance to Press and certainly not to scurrilous abuse which was to be expected by persons in posi tlo... of auohority. With regard2. regard to His Majesty's Government he would use a simile as I had done. If a man was suffocating it was unfair to object to his fighting for air. I replied that I could see his point of view and I hoped he understpod position of His Majesty's Government which was that they were hound to resist cancellation of concession^. He did not demur. Is I thought he was on the point of terminating audience I said I wished to repeat what I had said regarding disposition cf His Majesty's Government. This evoked a speech on the subject of interest which His Majesty's Government should have in seeing a stable independent Persia under patriotic Government hut he fear ed that His Majesty's Government viewed such Persia askancec I replied that first part of what he had said would have heen 'entirely suitable for a speech by Simon on the subject of Anglo-Persian relations' but his conclusion was quite incorrect.

I told Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning that my principal Impression was that Shah was intensely suspicious of Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This he definite ly admitted. I said it was not long ago that His Majesty could not speaX too highly of Company - see Olive's telegram No.l and 2 January 1st 1928, I did not know what had happened to change his views. I wondered whether he had at the time of cancellation any idea of immediately preceding events which I recited to Minister for Foreign- Affairs who replied that though he would not speak with certainty as he was not here my account made him think Shah could not have heen properly informed, making it plain that Jn his opinion Shah alone was responsible for cancellation. Turning to Shah's views regarding policy of His . Majesty's Government I said that they seemed subject to violent and Inexplicable changes. I could think of nothing during say last ten years which could explain these / fluctuations. Minister for Foreign Affairs had no ex planation but said tha.t Shah was very susceptible, for instance, he had been delightedly grateful for spontaneous abolition of consular guardn: in 1927. In spite of passing difficulties His Majesty's Government must believe that Shah's goal was good permanent understanding with us. If as Minister for Foreign Affairs hoped Anglo-Persian Oil2, Gil Company J business was satisfactorily • settled all would te well. I then asked Minister for Foreign Affairs what he ticugh of audience and he said he was pleased and replied to a further question that he thought His Majesty did not see us oftener because he was embarrassed hy not knowing a foreign language. This conversation has to some stnall extent confirmed impression that audience did something to clear fog of Shah's suspicions and I think it might he worth while to try and prevent it settling down again before arrival ox representatives of Anglo-Persian Gil Company* My idea would he to send Shah through Minister for Foreign Affairs a short account of developments of Company of reasons for them of manner in which they have been financed of difference of opinion tc which they have given rise and efforts made to reach settlement. 1 would add that Company^ wish was to give His Majesty a general but clear picture of a complicated matter.

Dispute between the United Kingdom and Persia in regard to the Concession held hy the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. M. DAVAE, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M. BENES : In order that I may be able to prepare my final report, I would suggest, Mr. President, that you call upon the repre sentatives of the two parties to the dispute, who will furnish the oral explanations necessitated by their memoranda. We can then examine the question further. SIE JOHN SIMON : I will gladly do my best to comply with the suggestion made by the representative of Czechoslovakia, who has been appointed as rapporteur in the matter of this dispute. The members of the Council are aware of the fact that on the 16th December, 1932, the United Kingdom Government circulated its memorandum, and that on the 18th January, 1933, the Persian memorandum in reply was also circulated. I will endeavour within limited compass to state as clearly as I can the nature of the dispute and the essential facts, and will also shortly deal with the juridical basis upon which, as my Government considers, the matter should proceed. On the 27th November, 1932, the Persian Government announced that it had cancelled the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a British company. This Concession was duly made on the 28th May, 1901, between the Persian Government and the former concessionnaire. I would like in the first instance to draw the attention of my colleagues to a number of relevant facts which are not in dispute at all. There is no dispute that the Concession was validly granted and bound the Government of Persia at the time it was made. There is no dispute that the original concessionnaire validly transferred his rights to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the Persian Government has recognised the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for many years as the holder of the Concession. There is no dispute that the Concession was for a period of sixty years and, therefore, when the Persian Government claimed to cancel it some two months ago the Concession had still nearly thirty years to run. There is no dispute that the Concession contains no provision for cancellation which is relevant in the present case. There is no dispute that the Concession contains an arbitration clause (article 17 of the Concession which is annexed to the British memorandum) under which any complaint, whether well- or ill-founded, by the Persian Government against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company could be brought. And there is no dispute that the cancellation was the unilateral act of the Persian Government; that is to say, the Persian v Government made no attempt to use the arbitration clause before [691 hh—1] bcancellation. There is one thing more about which there is no dispute and which, I venture to say, is most material from the juridical point of view: since cancellation, the Persian Government has secured a ratification of its unilateral act by the Persian legislative authorities with the result that there could not be in any case any remedy available to the Anglo-Persian Company in the Persian courts. Members of the Council will understand that the action of the Persian authorities has now brought about the situation that there is an equivalent of an Act of Parliament in Persia saying that the Concession is cancelled. Consequently no Persian court would have jurisdiction to give any remedy whatever to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His Majesty's Government bring this matter before the Council of the League as a matter involving international law in which they take up, as they are entitled to do, the case of the company, which is a British subject, and complain of the international wrong which has been perpetrated by the unilateral act of the Persian Government. I would like to say a few words about the application of article 15. The consequence of the cancellation has of course adversely affected the company and might well develop into a still more serious situation leading to a rupture between two countries both of which, I am sure, desire to maintain friendly relations—I would like to assure the honourable representative of Persia of my own sentiments. If the Concession has been cancelled, which is what the Persian Government claim, the right of the company to carry on its work in Persia would automatically disappear. The Persian authorities, if there is no concession which they respect, could tell the company to clear out, could claim to take over the company's operations and could put in jeopardy works and enterprises which have cost the company many millions of pounds sterling. It is quite true that the Persian Government has not done that. Fortunately these extreme consequences have not happened because the Persian Government has hesitated to give logical effect to its unlawful act and has undertaken not to prejudice the position while the matter is being decided. But it is quite evident from the declarations made by the Persian Government that its real reason for cancelling the Concession is that it hopes by this means to dictate to the company a new concession while the company is in the adverse and unfair situation of having its Concession cancelled. The position of a company which has no concession in negotiating with a Government is, of course, perfectly different from the position of a company which has a concession, but is discussing with the Government whether there should be a modification. His Majesty's Government submit that this is an indefensible use by the Persian Government of its sovereign power. The company ought not to be exposed to the risk of negotiating a new concession on the basis produced when the Government has illegally sought to cancel the old one. His Majesty's Government, as is shown by their action in bringing this case before the Council under a procedure providing for conciliation, are very willing that this dispute should be happily settled. But they must insist that the illegal basis which the Persian ■Government has sought to create should not be the basis upon which future discussions proceed. As I have said, I trust that there may lie a reconciliation, but I must make quite plain to the members of the Council that, if it becomes necessary. His Majesty's Government will have to ask the Council to decide that an international wrong has been committed, and that accordingly the Concession must be restored. Allow me to give a short explanation of the provisions in the Concession as to royalty, and as to the way in which these provisions have operated in practice. Under the terms of the Concession the company, apart from certain other payments, is required to pay 16 per cent, of the net annual profits, as indicated in article 10, to the Persian Government, and it has in fact paid to that Govern ment very large sums amounting to over £11 million. At the time when the Concession was granted in 1901, there was no commercial production of oil in Persia at all, and it was quite uncertain in what areas, or with what outlay, or in what period of time, or in what quantities, oil could be produced. Indeed, an earlier concern had, prior to the grant of the Concession in 1901, held a concession onvery similar terms for oil in Persia, and had in 1899, after large expenditure, abandoned it as unprofitable. Manifestly, therefore, we are dealing with a case in which the company takes the risks. It is of the essence of such a concession that the burden of outlay and expenditure and risk of loss falls on the concessionnaire, and it is a manifest abuse of the contract:—validly entered into—if after this outlay and risk the other party seeks to appropriate, in breach of the terms of the contract, the benefits of the exploitation. Under this Concession the members of the Council may have observed that the company was given rights to prospect over the greater part of Persia, and it has had to spend over £22 million in exploiting the Concession in Persia, The Persian Government has never contributed one halfpenny of the capital, and has never taken the smallest part of the risk from beginning to end. One of the many complaints contained in the Persian case, which I read with great interest and respect, will be found in paragraph 27 (a). Like many other complaints, it appears to have nothing to do with the question in dispute, and has never even been made the subject of complaint until now. It is that the company has confined the extraction of oil to an area of little more than 1 square mile. May I be forgiven for saying that this is an excellent example both of the relevance and of the accuracy of the details alleged to constitute the Persian defence. May I tell the Council the facts? Oil is at present being produced under the Concession by the company from over 150 times the area mentioned, and the company has spent vast sums in prospecting over large areas in order to find where oil can be profitably and economically produced. I have been provided by the company with a few figures. It has examined in detail over 150,000 square miles of territory; it has geologically traversed another 250,000 square miles; it has drilled test wells in no less than twenty-three areas; it has carried out 380 geological and geophysical surveys; and it has spent over 563,500,000. sterling on work of this character quite irrespective of its expenditure on the great oil-fields from which the principal supply now comes. I would ask the Council also to consider this : oil is a highly competitive commodity, and nothing can be more foolish (especially from the point of view of the Persian Government, which depends on the profit the company makes) than to extend oil works at random. The company, as the Persian Imperial Commissioner well knew and has acknowledged, is working on a carefully-planned scheme of development—a plan that has necessarily taken into account all relevant considerations, including the markets which are economically accessible. It is clear that in this respect the interests of the company are identical with the interests of the Persian Government r and the suggestion that the company is seeking to limit the profitable production of oil in Persia is as baseless as the suggestion that this was a reason why the Concession was cancelled, and in any case it would be impossible to justify a unilateral act for cancelling this Concession. The story about the royalties I understand to be this : After- seven years of prospecting, involving heavy expenditure, oil began to be produced in commercial quantities in the year 1912. Profits began to be made in 1913 or 1914. In the years 1914 to 1919 the company paid on account of royalty to the Persian Government a sum of £325,000. I Call attention to this fact because, when I turn to paragraph 5 (b) of the Persian case, I am a little surprised to read : 'Up to 1919 no sum had yet been paid under this head.' It is very odd that that impression should exist, because the fact is that £325,000 had been paid on account of royalty. The years of the war produced considerable difficulties in this part of the world; the pipe-line which runs through Persian territory was cut by hostile tribal action, and the company suffered heavy losses. The company claimed under article 14 of the Concession that the Persian Government had undertaken to protect its pipe-line, which was in Persian territory, and consequently must make good the loss. If my colleagues will look at article 14 they will see that that was not an unreasonable construction; I do not say it was right, but it is one that might be advanced under that article. This, led for the time being to the holding up of certain royalty payments^ [691 hh—l] ^ B 24 but this and other controversial matters were brought to a settlement as the result of negotiations conducted on behalf of the Persian Government by its Financial Adviser, Mr. Armitage-Smith. One of the terms of the settlement ultimately reached was that the company should pay to the Persian Government a lump sum of £1 million in respect of outstanding claims under the Concession during this period. It may be with surprise that the Council will observe that in the Persian case, which goes back into very ancient history, the Persian Government now suggests that Mr. Armitage-Smith had no authority for what he did, and that the settlement he made is not valid. What that has to do with cancelling the Concession so many years after wards I leave others to find out, but I would point out that if, indeed, the settlement made by Mr. Armitage-Smith, Financial Adviser to the Persian Government, is not valid, the Persian Government has received ^1 million from the company which it ought to pay back. Secondly, the question whether it is valid or not has nothing whatever to do with the cancellation of the Concession on the 27th November, 1932, more than ten years later. I would be grateful if my colleagues would note what is included in the memorandum of my Government—what have, in fact, been the payments of royalties to the Persian Government during the last twelve years. The figures will be found in a note to paragraph 5 of the British text. For the last twelve financial years the payment of royalties to the Persian Government have been as follows :— £ 1919-20 469,000 1920-21 585,000 1921-22 593,000 1922-23 533,000 1923-24 411,000 1924-25 831,000 1925-26 1,054,000 1926-27 1,400,000 1927-28 502,000 Henceforward the commercial year of the company ended at the 31st December, and for the nine months to the end of 1928, royalties amounted to ^529.000. For the commercial year 1929, the figure was 501,437,000; for the year 1930, £1,288,000, and for the year 1931, £307,000. The Council will observe, therefore, that there was a very serious drop in the year before the Concession was cancelled. There can be no doubt at all that this reduced amount was disappointing to the Persian Government, and I venture to think is, perhaps, not altogether unconnected with the events which occurred so soon afterwards. It was due not to any failure to discharge the terms of the Concession, but to the heavy fall in trade and profits all over the world, from which the company and the Persian Government had to suffer alike. Part of the arrangements made by Mr. Armitage-Smith provided that the Persian Government should appoint its own firm of chartered accountants to examine the books and figures of the company and to check the royalties to make sure that they were correct. That is obviously a most reasonable provision, and the Persian Government employed for this purpose a firm of chartered accountants in London of the highest standing, whose complete integrity and capacity no one could doubt, and the Persian Government does not, of course, challenge this. I can assure the Council that there is no firm of higher standing in the world. Consequently, as the Council will appreciate, the records of the company have been examined on behalf of the Persian Government year by year, so that anyone might see how it stood and the calculations might be checked. Certain questions have arisen from time to time between the accountants acting for the Persian Government and for the company, and some of these remain outstanding, so that the amounts paid were received without prejudice. I may observe, in passing, that it is a much more complicated calculation than one might suppose, because the company is concerned in many enterprises; there are subsidiary companies, there is the question of the tankers that carry the oil, and a number of things, to say nothing of the deductions to be made fromgross receipts before the net profits can be arrived at. That, however, is a situation which might easily arise in a complicated business. There is not the slightest ground for claiming to cancel the Concession on that account, and, indeed, it is obvious that questions of this sort, if not disposed of by agreement, are questions which could be determined under the arbitration clause. I am very unwilling, and it is not necessary at this stage, to detain the Council with further details of the earlier years, but I should like to interpose three comments, made in the most friendly fashion, on statements which I find in the Persian memorandum. If the Council will turn to paragraph 5 (a) of that memorandum they will find it there stated that the company, over a number of years, failed to pay a fixed annual sum of 2,000 tomans due to the Persian Government under an article of the Concession, and that in 1909 the arrears amounted to 16,000 tomans. It is further stated that the company refused to make any payment and declined arbitration. In any event, that is very ancient history, which must be the explanation of its inaccuracy. The real facts are that the matter was amicably settled by a payment by the company on the 9th January, 1911, of £2,000 sterling in respect of the Persian Government's claim to date, and 2,000 tomans have been paid by the company in respect of every year since that date. Since it is difficult to extract the smallest item of humour from a case of this sort, let me add that in the year 1913, owing to an error, the sum was actually paid twice over! I take as the second example of what I regard as a rather unhappy collection of innuendoes, what I read in paragraph 27 (c). It is an allegation that the company has failed to observe a stipulation in the Concession concerning the employment of workmen who are Persian subjects. I think the company has some right to feel a little aggrieved that such a suggestion should be made against it; it is not a ground on which anybody has ever sought to cancel a concession, and has nothing to do with the case. The actual facts are these : The skilled labour employed by the company in Persia includes 118 categories of employees, managers, engineers, &amp;c. When the company began operations few artisans in any of these categories were available among the Persian population, and during the Great War rapid development led to the importing from India of skilled labour not available in Persia. Since then, the number of non- Persian employees has been consistently diminished, and 90 per cent, of the company's non-European employees in Persia are now Persian subjects. In order to fit Persian subjects for employment, the company has spent over £100,000 sterling on education in recent years. Apart from artisan-training centres, it has built schools in the Persian Provinces of Khuzistan, where none existed, and for six years it has provided free university education in England for two Persian students annually. Further, the Persian Government has benefited directly and indirectly by the expenditure in Persia of not less than £22 million by the company. On medical services alone in Southern Persia the company has spent over £550,000 sterling since 1924, and tens of thousands of non-employees receive free medical treatment every year. I should regret if any prejudice were introduced into this case on either side, because it is not at all necessary. The matter is, I think, a fundamentally simple one to decide, but I am entitled to say on behalf of my fellow-countrymen that the reproach that they have not in this matter shown a sufficient regard for the very proper needs of the population of Persia in the neighbourhood concerned has not the smallest scrap of foundation. I will take one other example and then pass to the main issue. In paragraphs 5 (a) and (b) it is stated that in 1909 and 1917 the company refused to refer disputes to arbitration. In the first place, I would invite this tribunal to consider the relevance of that observa tion. We are considering a cancellation suddenly perpetrated in November 1932, and I would ask exactly what help is to be got from speaking of events that occurred in 1909 and 1917 in justification of the cancellation. I do not understand. The facts are that the dispute under discussion, in 1909, was amicably settled in 1911 by a capital payment. As to the dispute in 1917, in August 1918 the counsellor of the Persian Legation in London6 communicated to the company the text of a telegram from the Persian Government stating: ' We note that the company is ready to go to arbitration, but that it wishes to settle this matter amicably and this we much appreciate.' What is the use of presenting a memorandum which makes it a capital charge against the company that it refused to refer a dispute to arbitration in 1917 when the Persian Government, through their own representative in London, states : We note that the company is ready to go to arbitration, but that it wishes to settle this matter amicably, and this we much appreciate ' ? The matter in dispute was, in fact, eventually disposed of. The company has never refused any formal request for arbitration and indeed, it could not have done so, because as any lawyer or business man knows full well an arbitration clause in a contract is a clause of which either party may take advantage without the permission of the other. To say that the Anglo-Persian Company refused arbitration is a statement which, on the face of it, is very difficult to understand. It is not necessary at this stage to detain the Council with further details of the earlier years, but it is very material to ask their close attention to the events which actually occurred in the period imme diately preceding the cancellation of which His Majesty's Government complain. This is the more necessary since the account given of the events of this period in the Persian memorandum appears to be quite inaccurate and materially misleading. This especially applies to para graphs 16 to 22. The Persian case correctly states that in 1931 discussions were proceeding between the company and the Persian Government as to whether the Concession could be revised and a new Concession negotiated. Negotiations on this subject had indeed been proceeding since 1929. The position was that the company held a perfectly valid binding concession which the Government had no right to cancel, but, at the same time, the company was willing to discuss with the Persian Government the terms of a new concession which, once it was agreed between them, might be substituted for the existing one. In April 1931 the Persian Government, in submitting proposals for a new concession, put forward the surprising claim that in any new con cession the company should, as a minimum, guarantee an annual payment of 562,700,000 sterling to the Persian Government, whether any profits were made or not. The Council will observe that it is not a proposal to have an increased percentage of profits; it is a claim that the company must guarantee in any event whatever be the fortune ol the venture, £2,700,000 sterling as a minimum year by year to the Persian Government. Let us take the year 1931, in which this modest suggestion was put forward. Such a payment in the year 1981 would have absorbed the whole of the profits of the company and left nothing for reserve, and the uncertainties of the future, which have since been exemplified in the world depression, make such a proposition quite impossible. Accordingly, after further discussion in Tehran, Sir John Cadman, the chairman of the company, wrote on the 7th August, 1931, to say that while the company would continue negotiations for the purpose of settling any difficulties or uncertainties in calculating royalties under the existing Concession, there was so great a difference between the views of the Persian Government and the company as to what was possible and equitable at that time, that the revision of the Concession could only be discussed when times were more propitious, and the chaotic condition of the oil industry had disappeared. I have the letter here, and what I have read is textually as taken from it. ^ Now what does the Persian memorandum give as the account of this matter ? You will find that in paragraph 16 it contents itself with this statement:— On the 7th August, 1931, to the Government's great surprise and disappointment. Sir John Cadman categorically stated, in a letter to the Minister of the Court, that the revision of the Concession could no longer be contemplated.' It will be for the members of the Council to judge, but I suggest that this appears to be a perfectly reasonable attitude on the part of Sir John Cadman, and certainly could not justify the unilateral cancellation of the existing Concession. His Majesty's Government regret to observe that the events just described are represented in the Persian case by a paragraph of three lines (which I have just read), which conveys, as it seems to them, a wholly misleading impression by stating that on■7 the 7th August, 1931, Sir John Cadman categorically stated that the revision of the Concession could no longer be contemplated. What he said was that in view of the enormous claims put forward on behalf of the Persian Government, it was commercially and practically impossible to consider the matter when trade was in so chaotic a state. Now, will the members of the Council follow the last stage of this story? There remained the negotiations for an improved agreement as to the calculation of royalties so as to get rid of doubts and disputes which had arisen in connexion with Mr. Armitage-Smith's settlement. I do not argue that that settlement is perfect; it may be that it is open to attack on other grounds, but the fact is that the parties were dis cussing how to reach an improved agreement which would calculate the royalties under the Concession. I ask particular attention to this part of the story, as the Council will see how extraordinary was the conduct of the Persian Government, who now claim that they are justified in cancelling the Concession in November 1932. Let us follow the dates. Discussions were by mutual agreement resumed late in 1931 with respect not only to past differences 1 on the subject of royalty payments, but also regarding a basis upon which the net profits of the company could in future be ascertained for the purpose of calculating the royalty to be paid to the Persian Government. The company offered a number of concessions which would have had the effect of increasing the Persian Government's revenue and disposing of differences of a financial character which were still outstanding. Early in 1932 a preliminary settlement on these several matters was arrived at. A large capital payment in respect of all matters in dispute in the past was agreed, and a new royalty agreement was drafted, designed to supersede the Armitage-Smith arrangement, and to meet the taxation claims of the Government. Heads of agreement were drafted which, when formulated in proper shape, would be fit for signature. The Persian Minister of Finance, his Excellency Taquisadih, signed a formal letter of authority empowering his Excellency Mirza Eissa Khan Fayz, the Persian Imperial Commissioner, to sign the agreement when drawn up between the Persian Government and the company. I have the document before me, and it is dated Tehran, the 4th April, 1932. I will read it:— 'Son Excellence Mirza Eissa Khan Fayz, Commissaire du Gouvernement imperial de Perse, a present resident a Londres, est autorise a signer avec le representant autorise de 1'Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 1'accord a conclure entre le Gouvernement imperial de Perse et ladite compagnie concernant le reglement des differends existant entre eux et relatifs au mode de calcul des redevances payables par ladite Compagnie au Gouvernement imperial de Perse en vertu de la Concession d'Arcy datee de mai 1901 ainsi qu'en vertu de la loi persane concernant I'impot sur le revenu. 'Ministre des Finances, ' S. H. Taqizadeh.' So here you have the responsible Minister giving a written authority to the Imperial Commissioner in London to sign the document, sent from Tehran to London on the 4th April, 1932. The formal agreement was drawn up by the lawyers and accountants of the two parties. I have a photostat of it here. Now, what happened to the formal agreement? It was initialled for the company by its chairman, and for the Persian Government by the Imperial Commissioner, and the document was sent to Tehran at the end of May 1932. There is therefore every ground for stating that the Persian Government contemplated and authorised the conclusion of this agreement. But what happened? Five days later the annual meeting of the company was held and there were published disappointing trading results for the year 1931. From this moment the Persian Government took up a different line. It stated that it desired additional information with respect to the agreement which its own representative had initialled. Obviously such information could well be furnished by its own representatives, who had discussed and formalised the agreemeni;, and the company was at that moment (June 1932) absolutely unable to send its London experts to Tehran. Very shortly afterwards the Persian Government announced to the resident director at Tehran that a8 new set of proposals on a different basis were under consideration by the Government, and the company naturally waited to know what these new proposals were. The director of the company in Tehran continued to receive assurances from responsible Persian Ministers that these new proposals were being-prepared. On the 25th October, as no proposals had come forward. Sir John Cadman instructed the resident director to enquire about the matter. On the 16th November the resident director reported that the Minister of Finance had confirmed to him that these new proposals of the Persian Govern ment were almost ready. The Council will observe from this short account of the dates that down to that moment the company had not the slightest reason to suppose that its Concession was in jeopardy. On the contrary, the authorised representative of Persia had initialled, agreed and formulated proposals drawn up in London, and in Tehran the company was being told right down to the 16th November, 1932, that alternative proposals drawn up by the Persian Government were just ready to be produced. Instead of producing them, the Persian Government, as already stated, made no further communication, but, on the 27th November, announced that the Concession was cancelled. &gt; These being the true facts the Council may be left to judge whether they are fairly and impartially stated in the remarkable version contained in paragraphs 19-23 of the Persian memorandum. The document of cancellation does not purport to cancel the Concession on the ground of any breach by the company, but makes it clear that the Persian Government took this illegal step as the most effective means of trying to get a new arrangement which would be more favourable to its interests. That is, in the submission of His Majesty's Government, a wholly unjustified proceeding, a breach of international law, and a wrong in respect of which His Majesty's Government are both entitled and obliged to take up the matter on behalf of the company. I His Majesty's Government have studied with care and the greatest respect the memorandum presented to the Council by the Persian Government, and have ventured to comment on one or two passages. Without occupying more time, my Government desire to point out that the document is largely composed of allegations which, even if they were well founded, could not possibly provide any justification for cancelling the Concession. Many of them refer to matters of ancient history that have since been settled by large payments which the Persian Government does not offer to repay. Again, the suggestion that the company prevented the use of the arbitration clause is quite unfounded. The arbitration clause is at all times available to either party, and it is not within the power of the other party to forbid its being used. His Majesty's Government will take the opportunity of delivering a written document which deals consecutively and more in detail with the collection of points of complaint which is contained in the Persian memorandum. They will be able to show that the complaints are in large measure ill- founded, and, in any event, could not constitute a justification for unilateral cancellation. I should like now to say a few words on the juridical basis of this application, I have, I hope, shown to the satisfaction of the Council that there has been nothing in the past conduct of the company which could, on any view of the law, justify the Persian Government in cancelling a valid concession by their own unilateral act, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to trouble the Council with any discussion of the question suggested in paragraph 28 of the Persian Government's case. I should, however, say something on the contention adduced m the last portion of the Persian Government's memorandum to the effect that His Majesty's Government, as they suggest, have not the right to take up the case of the company, on the ground that the company has not had recourse to the Persian courts. The principle that where an effective remedy exists in the local courts, diplomatic action is not admissible until that remedy is exhausted, is well established, and I do not dispute the principle at all; the Persian Government have reminded the Council that His Majesty's Government have relied on that principle in a case which was recently before the Council, and I need hardly say that,on the question of principle, His Majesty's Government stand by the statements made in that case. But the circumstances in the present case are completely different. and I maintain that the principle in question is not applicable. Let us examine the Concession. The method of settling any disputes which arise under the Concession was laid down in the Concession itself in the shape of the arbitral procedure provided for in article 17. The Persian Government made no attempt to make use of that procedure before cancelling the Concession, and they claim that in consequence of their action in cancelling the Concession the remedy in question is no longer open to the company. This means that the Persian Government, by its own act, has destroyed the tribunal to which these disputes would naturally have been referred. This is stated in paragraph 28 of the Persian case. It is not open to the Persian Government, having thus purported to deprive the company of the remedy provided for under the Concession, to claim that it ought to have recourse to another remedy in the Persian courts, which under the Concession have no competence to decide disputes between the parties. If I may say so, this is one of those cases in which law and common sense go together. In fact, the action of the Persian Government in thus depriving the company of the remedy provided by the contract may be regarded as a denial of justice which in itself would justify diplomatic intervention. Moreover, it is elementary that there can be no question or exhausting remedies in the municipal courts if no effective remedy exists there, and the Persian Government and Legislature have effectively eliminated any possibility of the company being able to obtain a remedy in the Persian courts. One does not send people into courts when one knows before they go that only one result is possible, and that that result is against them. As I have already pointed out to the Council, the Persian Government have not only cancelled the Concession, but they have followed up that action by enacting a Persian law which provides that the Concession is at an end. On the 1st December the Majlis, the legislative authority of Persia, confirmed the decision of the Government cancelling the Concession in the following terms :— ' The National Consultative Assembly expresses its agreement with the recent decision of the Government in regard to the annulment of the D'Arcy Concession and approves and corroborates (supports) the action of the Government in this connexion.' The text of the pronouncement of the Majlis was published in the official Majlis journal under the title 'Legal Decision communicated to the Ministry of Finance.' I understand that m form this amounted to retrospective endorsement of the Government s action which was technically irregular as there had not been previous consultation with the Majlis. I do not understand how the Persian Government can contend that a decision of the Government endorsed bv the Majlis in the form of a ' Legal Decision '' published m the official journal is not valid under Persian law and binding on the Persian courts, and if so those courts can give no remedy agamst it. Therefore a contention by the Persian Government that an effective remedy exists in the Persian courts can only be based on the hypothesis that the decision was not valid under Persian Jaw— if it is valid there is nothing to argue about—and that the cancellation of the Concession was therefore a nullity. If they admit that on those grounds I submit most respectfully to my colleagues further consideration—if indeed the matter has to reach a final examination and iudgment—that there is nothing whatever m the citation as applied to this case, of the well-known fact that municipal remedies must be exhausted. They have been exhausted by the simple fact that the Persian Government and the Persian Legislature have destroyed them. . , • , ^/r • i. &gt; i nave alreadv explained the serious view which His Majesty s Government felt compelled to take of the situation created as between themselves and the Persian Government by the action of the latter. In these circumstances it was the duty of His Majesty's Government to adopt one or other of the two methods, judicial settlement or reference to the Council, prescribed by article 15 for such cases. For [691 hh—1] r10 reasons which have been explained in the written case which we have presented to the Council, His Majesty's Government have adopted the method of bringing the matter before the League, and by so doing they have shown both their confidence in the justice of their case and their desire to make the fullest possible use of the methods provided by the Covenant for the settlement of international disputes. The procedure under article 15 involves, failing a settlement by agreement, a report by the Council on the merits of the case, but it is the first duty of the Council in proceedings under article 15 to endeavour to effect a settle ment of the dispute, and it is the earnest hope of His Majesty's Government that, under the guidance of the rapporteur, the Council may bring about an amicable and equitable settlement which will ensure the continuance in the future of the friendly relations between them selves and the Persian Government which they are most anxious to maintain, and will enable the company to continue its operations in Persia in harmonious relations with the Government of that country. The Council may be assured of the co-operation of His Majesty's Government with that object in view. M. DAVAB : I desire to express mary admiration of the eloquence of the representative of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. It has/enabled him to present the facts in the light most favourable to the British cause. I personally am far from desiring to impress the Council by oratorical means. I shall therefore first explain our memorandum in a few words, and then reply very simply and briefly to the observations of the representative of the United Kingdom The Persian Government has already replied generally to the state ment of the facts contained in the British memorandum. It should doubtless have entered into greater detail; a number of rectifications have been made, but it was impossible to deal with everything. That would take too long and would be of no importance at present. We -simply ask that our silence should never be interpreted as&lt; necessarily implying acquiescence. We venture, however, to make certain observations on three points in the memorandum of the United Kingdom Government. We read with genuine astonishment the following statement in paragraph 33 of the memorandum submitted to the Council:— 'His Majesty's Government observe with much disquietude that, in the various communications quoted above, the Persian Government has consistently declined to accept any responsibility for loss or damage to the company, although under article 14 of the Concession the Persian Government is bound to take any necessary measures to protect the property and employees of the company.' The expression of this disquietude, which according to the circum stances of the moment would appear to take the form sometimes of a threat and sometimes of a justification, is really inexplicable. In support of such a view, the United Kingdom Government points out that the Persian Government has only returned unsatisfactory replies to its formal notifications to the Persian Government to fulfil its obligations. It has forgotten that, in reply to the note of the 8th December, the Persian Government stated, on the 12th, that it ' cannot understand how, while .... they have not interfered and do not interfere with the affairs of the company nor cause them any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them.' It is true that the Persian Government, which now contends that the D'Arcy Contract has no validity whatever, declines any respon sibility that might arise under article 14 of the contract. As that article, which requires it to protect the plant and apparatus, as well as the representatives, agents and servants of the company, is part of the contract, it necessarily shares the same fate. While, however, it would have been inconsistent for the Persian Government to admit that it was bound by this article, it was nevertheless obliged by international law, once it regarded itself as released from the whole contract, to safe guard the person and property of foreigners in its territory, an obliga tion it has never intended to evade. It therefore regrets to note that, by claiming that as a result of the letter of the 27th November, 1932, the personnel and the property of the company ran grave risks, the United Kingdom Government converted an unfounded supposition into a formal charge.11 Another point in the United Kingdom memorandum needs to be elucidated. The United Kingdom Government appears to charge the Persian Government with declining to comply with the summons to withdraw the cancellation of the 27th November, under penalty of being cited before the Permanent Court of International Justice in virtue of the obligation it assumed acceding to the optional clause, article 36, paragraph 2. To cite it in this way before the court or—to be more accurate—to threaten to do so, does not appear to be in accord ance with custom. If the United Kingdom Government thought the Persian Government ought to submit the dispute to the court, it had only to cite it to appear before the court. It has since given as its reason for not doing so that in its Protocol of Accession to article 36, paragraph 2, the Imperial Persian Government made a reservation whereby it could ask that proceeding's be suspended and a dispute referred to the Council; and the United Kingdom Government could not prevent such a result except by itself taking the initiative and bringing the matter before the Council. That the United Kingdom, having warned Persia that unless the cancellation of the 27th November were withdrawn in eight days, she i would be cited before the Permanent Court of International Justice, st should not have carried out that intention can be explained very simply, to We have only to refer to Persia's accession to the optional clause for in compulsory arbitration to see that it covers '' any disputes arising after id the ratification of the present declaration ''—that is the actual wording it | of our reservation—'' with regard to situations or facts relating directly :g. or indirectly to the application of treaties or conventions accepted by Id Persia ''—I emphasise the words '' of treaties or conventions ''—and qj subsequent to the ratification of this declaration.' No jurist could conceive that '' treaties or conventions accepted by ^ Persia '' could mean anything but treaties or conventions between | l States. No one could suppose that the Concession granted to a private individual in 1901 with power to substitute for himself one or more commercial companies was a contract between States. Moreover, we made another reservation which must be borne in mind : '' with the exception ''—the reservation reads—' 'of ... . disputes with regard to questions which, by international law, fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of Persia.' &amp; I This stipulation was not without its value; it makes clear the respective positions of the two Governments in the present itj circumstances. lie The third point to which we desire to draw the Council's it attention relates to paragraph 33 of the United Kingdom memo randum, which charges the Persian Government with making no attempt to invoke the arbitration provisions of article 17 of the Concession. Having cancelled the contract, the Persian Government could not consistently resort to arbitration, for which provision was made in one of its articles. If the company thought we were bound by the contract, it should have applied to the courts to have this article put into operation. Having made these rectifications in the United Kingdom memorandum, we will explain our own point of view. How was the contract made? How was it carried out? These questions cannot be discussed at the moment. What must be made th clear is that they arise, not between the United Kingdom Govern- i) ment and the Persian Government, but between the Persian State, which granted the Concession, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, at the concessionnaire. d - For the United Kingdom Government to be able to present here at as an inter-State dispute what is simply a dispute between the I Persian State and a private individual, it must plead the right to of diplomatic protection. As we said in our memorandum, however, it diplomatic protection presupposes— at B (1) A violation of international law. (2) The previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. Neither of these two conditions has been fulfilled in this case. There has been no violation of international law, but a unilateral denunciation, falling within the sphere of application of civil law. While reserving its right to employ any legal means that might prove necessary, even to declare the original contract null and void, [691 hh—1] c 212 the Persian Government confined itself to putting an end to a eynallagmatic contract on the ground of non-fulfilment. This is the simple and lawful act by which, in many legislations, one party ends a contract, subject to the other party's right to contest such act. In paragraph 28 of our memorandum we say ; Roman law allows the party suffering by the non-fulfilment of the obligations assumed towards him to notify the other party that he reciprocally regards himself as released from his own obligations, while French law requires the party to apply to the courts in order to vindicate his rights.' We must add that while French law differs from Roman law, in accordance with the progress of legal science, the most modern legislations have carried the idea of cancellation for non-fulfilment much further than Roman law. The Swiss Federal Code of Obliga tions is a noteworthy case in point. The legal principle of Persian law with regard to unilateral cancellation on the ground of non-fulfilment is therefore in complete agreement with the most modern codes. The application of this principle cannot be considered a violation of international law. There remains the second condition preliminary to diplomatic protection: the previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. The British national, who should have exhausted them before invoking diplomatic protection has had no resort to them whatever. There fore the United Kingdom Government cannot intervene. The principle that municipal remedies must first be exhausted is not only enunciated by the United Kingdom Government itself, as we have stated in our memorandum, but was recognised by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Mavrommatis case, Judgment No. 2, p. 12, as follows :— ' It is an elementary principle of international law that a State is entitled to protect its subjects, when injured by acts contrary to international law committed by another State, from whom they have been unable to obtain satisfaction through the ordinary channels.' In the present case, the ordinary channels (the Persian courts) being open to the company, the United Kingdom Government had no legal authority to interfere in the dispute between the Persian State and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I shall now reply to Sir John Simon's very eloquent and able observations, which, however, in no way impair the legal value of the considerations I have just laid before the Council. The representative of the United Kingdom adduced several examples in an endeavour to prove that the Persian memorandum was based on a number of facts which were not substantially correct. He pointed out that it is said, in the part of the Persian memorandum relating to the company's restricted exploitation of the Concession, that it was confined to an area of little more than one square mile. If you refer to this passage in our memorandum, you will see that our observations relate not to the prospecting operations and the activities of the company, but to actual extraction and exploitation. We fully recognise that in many areas the company's prospecting operations have proved the existence of oil. But we do complain that, having found this product, the company kept exclusive possession of it and left it in reserve underground, making available only the oil extracted from a few wells—six or seven, if I am not mistaken. On the other hand, Sir John Simon pointed out that it was in the interest of the Persian Government and of the company that oil extractions should be reduced during the depression. To that it might be replied— (1) That the oil industry has had difficult times only in recent years, whereas the company has been working in Persia for a long time. (2) That even in the years of depression, the company considerably extended its operations outside Persia. As to the payment of £325,000 sterling by the company during the years 1914-19, it may have paid part of its royalties before 1919, but the Persian Government certainly received no royalties until several years later than 1913, the year during which, according to Sir John Simon, the company began to make profits.13 In any event, the fact that the company admitted, in 1920, that it owed a million pounds sterling in respect of arrears and claims by the Persian Government certainly proves that for years it had with held considerable sums belonging to the Government. Sir John Simon then mentioned a fact which, he alleged, clearly showed that our statement did not correspond to the facts. He referred to the royalty of 2,000 tomans. I take up this point to prove that our intentions were not, I think, bad and that we were telling the truth. We did not say in our memorandum, with regard to the royalty of 2,000 tomans, that a subsequent settlement was not reached. We simply desired to show that, even when so small a sum as 2,000 tomans a year was involved, the company did not fulfil its obligations, except after inadmissible delay. Sir John Simon himself said, moreover, that it was in 1911—that is to say, after ten years' delay—that the company fulfilled its obligations and paid us this sum, which it should have paid in 1901. Consequently, when we said in our memorandum that the company was not fulfilling its obligations, our intention was simply to show, from the history of our relations, how the company behaved. The sum in question was very small—2,000 tomans; and the company delayed payment for ten years. There is thus nothing incorrect there. Our statement was entirely in accordance with the truth. As the facts were so eloquently presented by the United Kingdom representative, however, this truth might appear in another light and create a different impression. Sir John Simon spoke just now of the employment of Indian labour. I should like to correct him on one or two points. The question was not that of the employment of Indian labour at the beginning of the Concession. Although the company has been working in Persia for many years, it still employs this foreign labour. In spite of all the Persian Government's protests, it still has thousands of foreign employees who are not skilled workmen, but mere labourers. I will not go into details here regarding the negotiations between ourselves and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. What was asked of the company and what it was given in exchange are matters of no importance for the moment. The company itself knew very well, and knows very well, that there were certain circumstances which justified the Persian Government's demands. I will not go into details now, as a discussion of them would, I think, be entirely premature for the moment. As mention has been made of the Imperial Commissioner's having initialled a preliminary agreement, we must be quite clear on that point. There was no engagement at all; there was an agreement of principle, but—as the company knows very well, and as the British memorandum moreover mentions—the agreement had to be ratified by the Government and approved by Parliament. There were there fore simply proposals or plans in no way constituting an engagement between ourselves and the company. It has been said that if the Persian Government thought that the 1920 agreement concluded by Mr. Armitage-Smith was not valid it ought to return the sum of £1 million received by it from the company. If we enter upon a discussion of this matter, if it is taken before a competent tribunal, we shall of course return the amount in question; but we shall claim everything that the company has acquired by way of profits gained without legitimate cause, and I think that in the last analysis we shall benefit by doing so. Again, mention has been made of the sums received by the Persian Government, £11 million. That is, of course, a very striking and impressive sum. Let us, however, compare it with the gains of the Government of the United Kingdom and the shareholders. Down to 1926 that Government received more than £40 million, whereas, from the beginning of the Concession, we have received only £11 million. We have calculated that, if we had left our entire oil resources at the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's free disposal, we should have received £10 million under the head of duties collected by the Customs Administration. The United Kingdom representative told us that the reasons adduced by the Persian Government in its memorandum, even14 supposing they were true to the facts, did not warrant the Persian Government's'cancellation of the contract. We must point out that the question at present under consideration is not whether, legally, the arguments advanced by the Persian Government in its memo randum are sufficient to justify the cancellation or no. That is an issue to be discussed in the competent courts. In his verbal statement Sir John Simon referred to an interpre tation of article 17 of the original Concession. He seemed to be trying to imply that that article declares the Persian courts to be entirely without jurisdiction. That would be really astonishing. Article 17 means this: The contracting parties undertook to submit to arbitration any dispute that might arise between them during the term of the contract. We gave that undertaking. In our view it no longer exists, because the contract no longer exists, and that article is one of the articles of the contract. Either we are right or we are wrong. If we are right, if the contract has been cancelled, then we cannot be blamed for not putting this article into execution and for not having had recourse to arbitra tion. And, if it is claimed that the cancellation was unwarranted, where is that to be proved? Is it to be proved in the Council of the League of Nations? It is the first time I have heard that argument. It is the first time I have heard it said that upon entering the League a State substitutes the Council for its own courts. We have already mentioned some of our arguments, and when we go before the competent court, I may say that we shall present them all and in due form. That will be the time to examine whether the cancellation was justified or not. If it was, article 17 concerning arbitration can then be applied; but the Persian Government cannot at once cancel a contract and take the same contract as a basis. That would be inconsistent. Moreover, the law in Persia is perfectly clear. If two parties to any contract give a mutual undertaking to submit any disputes between them to arbitration, and if one of the parties refuses, in the event of a dispute, to comply with that undertaking, the law indicates the path to be followed. It stipulates that it is the other party that must apply to the court and oblige the opponent to appoint his arbitrators. If the arbitrators are not designated within a specified time-limit, they are appointed by the court. The matter is therefore quite simple. If the company believes our action to be unwarranted, it ought to apply to the courts and ask for the application of article 17'. If that had been done, we could have argued that, having cancelled the contract, we were no longer bound by the arbitration clause. The court would then have had first to consider the previous question of the cancellation. If that had been settled in our favour, there would be no occasion to submit the dispute to arbitration. If judgment had gone against us, we should then have been obliged to accept arbitra tion; but we cannot, without inconsistency, cancel the contract and accept the arbitration stipulated in that contract. The United Kingdom representative is, moreover, singularly mistaken when he claims that the measure of the 27th November taken by the Finance Minister subsequently received the approval ot the Chamber, and thereby assumed the character of a law which the Persian courts would be bound simply to apply, so that the company would be deprived of all redress. As the President of the Chamber observed at the end of the discussion on the same day, the Chamber's resolution was simply a motion of confidence, which is a familiar practice in all countries ^ LT ^ SySt f m - . 11 Was not a law - In takin g a decision m conformity with the rules of civil law, the Persian Government had of fW T ? obtai n approval by statute for the cancellation Bef0re ' aS after ' recourse t0 the courts remained open to the company. whifh l0SSeS sust 1 ai . ned the company during the year, losses which the company claims from us by withholding payment oi too man 8 Tt M n ' Inber of y ears ' 1 intentionally refrained from giving too many details m our memorandum; and I will limit myself in the present discussion to a few explanatory remarks. durin/thTw^r 7 ^ 8 Clain * ng from us the 108868 due to the fact that during the wai the pipe-hnes were cut in certain places bv armed bands, acting on the instigation of the belligerent Powers, who had15 violated our neutrality. I will mention no names, but almost all our neighbours fought on our territory. Our neutrality was violated by the company, and perhaps by the Government of the United Kingdom; whereupon other belligerents came and organised armed bands, and it was these who cut the pipe-lines. And we were expected to pay for it! We cannot do so, since the losses sustained were due to the war and to acts at variance with Persian neutrality. According to one expert—and I am happy to have heard the United Kingdom representative say that he is above suspicion—the losses caused amounted to £20,000. The company claimed for £600,000. What did the Persian Government do? It asked the company to submit the question to arbitration; but the company replied: 'No. We will not allow the principle of your liability to be submitted to arbitration, but if you are willing to discuss the figures, we will ask experts to go into the matter.' In the company's eyes we were liable, and it set itself up as both judge and plaintiff. Mention has been made of two persons holding scholarships. That is perfectly true, but we are prepared to tell the company that it can withdraw its benefactions. The Persian Government is now maintaining over 500 Persian scholarship-holders in France, Switzerland and Belgium. Nevertheless we must be grateful for what has been done, and as that has been put forward as an argument, I tender my thanks. I am anxious to avoid details as far as possible, and to confine myself to the substance of the case. I said at the outset, and I still say, that the substance of the question cannot be discussed before an international body until it has been proved that there has been a denial of justice. We were very glad to hear the United Kingdom representative say that his country still maintained the principle that the ordinary remedies should be exhausted before diplomatic protection is exercised. We take note of that declaration. There is, therefore, only one point to be elucidated, namely, whether the municipal remedies were open or closed to the company. We have already said that they remained open. If need be, that issue could be elucidated separately. SIR JOHN SIMON: I shall not detain the Council for more than a few moments, but I should like, while this discussion is fresh in our minds, to note one or two points which have been brought out in the course of the Persian representative's interesting speech. .Those points are concerned with the juridical basis of the British claim, with one exception with which I will deal first and which is purely a matter of fact. I can assure the Persian representative that, wherever he got his figures from—and I do not think it can have been from his accountants—the statement that His Majesty's Government have drawn M0 million from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a grotesque exaggeration. I would further point out that His Majesty's Government differ in this respect from the Persian Govern ment, in that His Majesty's Government have contributed to the capital of the company, whereas the Persian Government have contributed nothing at all. It the Persian representative would like to know what approximately is the figure which His Majesty's Government have received in respect of a very large share-holding in the company, it is, I believe, round about £9 million. I do not give that as a certain figure, but it goes without saying that it can be ascertained without any difficulty on reference to the proper sources. As for the suggestion contained in paragraph 25 of the Persian memorandum—and to which I did not allude in my own observations, because I thought it rather spoke for itself—that if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had been left to deal with this matter without having to pay royalty, then the taxes levied by the taxes department alone would have amounted to £19,998,509 16s. 0d., I can only say that I admire profoundly the precision of these calculations, especially as the other calculations showed a mistake as between 40 million and 9 millions. I must really ask for particulars of the 16s.! The whole of that paragraph is, I submit with the greatest respect, based on a rather obvious fallacy. If, indeed, there was16 going to be imposed upon the company taxes to the tune of ^19 million, then I wonder how much profit the company would make, and I also wonder whether it would undertake the Concession at all'. I am not myself aware what these taxes would be, because I am informed that there is no tax upon the export of oil; consequently, the only taxes must be on things imported by the company, such as machinery. If one says to a British company that if it endeavours to extract oil from the soil of Persia it will be required to pay ^19 million in taxation on its machinery, I think it very improbable that the company will undertake the operation. That is all I wish to say on the facts. I would like now to refer to the very frank and very clear state ment made by the Persian representative on the legal situation. He has referred particularly to clause 14 and clause 17 of the Concession, and I agree with him that it is well worth considering what those two clauses indicate as to the juridical position. Clause 14 is the clause which provides that the Persian Govern ment ' binds itself to take all and any necessary measures to secure the safety and the carrying-out of the object of this Concession of the plant and of the apparatuses of which mention is made for the purposes of the undertaking of the company and to protect the representatives agents and servants of the company.' It was, of course, under that article that the company, whether rightly or wrongly, thought that if its pipe-line, which is plainly one of its apparatuses, was damaged on Persian territory it might be that article 14 meant what it said, and that the Persian Government had guaranteed the safety of the pipe-line. Of course, the Persian Government, under that article, undertake to keep the company, its apparatus and servants safe. I am not concerned as to whether that was right or wrong, for I quite agree that the conditions of war in many cases make a great difference, for which allowance must be made; but the Persian representative said that when the Persian Government were asked by the United Kingdom Government the other day whether they were prepared, under article 14, to continue to hold themselves responsible for the various matters mentioned there, the Persian Government had been obliged to say that they were no longer bound by article 14, because they had cancelled the Concession. That is exactly the point which I endeavoured less clearly to make in my opening speech, in which I ventured to submit to the Council that it was plain that there was here the danger of a rupture, since, when the Persian Government cancelled the Concession, they tore up every clause, and one clause was that which made special provision for the protection of the company, the Concession, its servants, agents, material and plant. I concede to the representative of Persia that the Persian police authorities still exist, but, whatever may be the reason, it seems to have been thought worth while by both sides, when the Concession was prepared, to insert a specific article guaranteeing that the Persian Government would protect the Concession and all belonging to it; and, by the admission made here a half an hour ago by their representative, the act of the Persian Government has destroyed that article. The other point to which I would like to refer concerns article 17, which is the article which provides for arbitration. 'In the event of there arising between the parties to the Concession any dispute or difference on the subject,' amongst other things, 'of the rights and responsibilities of one or other of the parties,' provision was made for arbitration. Now, the honourable representative of Persia says: 'Yes, article 17 is in the Concession all right, and arbitration is provided for by that article,' but then he says: 'The Persian Government have torn up the Concession, and therefore there is no longer any arbitration clause to which the Persian Government can give any respect or adhesion.' That is exactly what I said in my opening speech. The bargain which was made between the two parties when the Concession was made was one regarding the constitution of a tribunal, especially defined in the Concession, to which the company could go; but the act of the Persian Government in cancelling the Concession has destroyed the tribunal, and, therefore, the PersianGovernment cannot say that recourse cannot be had to the Council of the League of Nations unless other remedies have been exhausted, when the Persian Government, by its own unilateral act, has deliberately destroyed the very tribunal to which the company was contractually entitled to go. I think that is extremely, clear, and I cannot imagine that any other view would be taken by a competent jurist, or, indeed, by any clear-headed man of affairs. There is one further point. The Persian representative can be most persuasive, and he has in an admirable manner endeavoured to suggest that there is still no question of international law arising between the parties. May I be allowed to point out, however, that this is not a question between two individuals, A and B. It is a question of a contract between a foreigner and the Persian Govern ment itself. This matter can be examined at greater length later, and I need not delay the Council by citing authorities, but I venture Very respectfully to state that this is the position in international law. Pronouncements by writers of repute in international law state that if a Government, by executive action or by legislative action, takes a course which is inconsistent with the terms of the Concession which it has granted to a foreigner, that is a violation of international law. Moreover, the Permanent Court of International Justice has established a finding that respect for the acquired rights of foreigners forms part of international law. Again, numerous cases have arisen where Governments have taken up the case of their own nationals in relation to a foreign Government on the ground that a breach of international law has been committed. Lastly, several cases of this kind which have been submitted to international arbitration have resulted in damages being awarded against the offending State. I will conclude all that I need say at the moment on this subject by reading a portion of the judgment that was pronounced in a ease of that character. There was some time ago an international dispute which was taken up by the United States Government . against Salvador because of the fact that the American rights of an individual had been disregarded. An international tribunal was appointed, and the following are two paragraphs from the judgment:— '' It is abhorrent to the sense of justice to say that one party to a contract, whether such party be a private individual, a monarch, or a Government of any kind, may arbitrarily, without hearing and without impartial procedure of any sort, arrogate the right to condemn the other party to the contract, to pass judgment upon him and his acts, and to impose upon him the extreme penalty of forfeiture of all his rights under it, including his property and his investment of capital made on the faith of that contract. 4 ' Before the arbitrement of natural justice all parties to a contract, as to their reciprocal rights and their reciprocal remedies, are of equal dignity, and are equally entitled to invoke for their redress and for their defence the hearing and the judgment of an impartial and disinterested tribunal.' I heard the Persian representative say something about the company being judge in its own cause; but I hope I am not exaggerating when I say that the Government of Persia, one of the two parties to the Concession, have plainly claimed to be judge in their own cause. I repeat the language of the judgment which I have just read, that in such cases the parties are ' entitled to invoke for their redress and for their defence the hearing and the judgment of an impartial and disinterested tribunal.' The United Kingdom Government, on behalf of a British subject, respectfully ask the Council of the League of Nations, if no adjustment is arrived at, to render that impartial and disinterested judgment. M. DAVAE : I have only a few observations to make in reply. With regard to the £40 million which I mentioned as being the profits received by the United Kingdom, I found this sum mentioned in a work by Mr. Winston Churchill, who was at one time Chancellor of the Exchequer. SIR JOHN SIMON : If I may interrupt, I would point out that the figure given in the book is an estimate of what might possibly be the ultimate receipts of the United Kingdom Government. [691 hh—1] d18 M DAVA.E: With regard to the ^619,998,509 16s. which I indicated as the amount the Persian Government might have received under the sole head of duties collected by the Customs Administration had there been no D'Arcy Concession, the United Kingdom repre sentative expressed surprise at the exactitude of this figure. I may say in reply that the papers were prepared for me by the Customs Administration itself, and I can communicate them to Sir John Simon personally. T do not think it is a crime to be accurate in book keeping. SIE JOHN SIMON ; Certainly not! M. DAVAR: With regard to article 14, I referred to it first of all in order to demonstrate the company's methods: I pointed out that the company claimed more than £600,000 in respect of losses sustained bv it during the war, whereas the sworn chartered accountant, a British subject, whom we commissioned to audit the company's books, stated that, even if the Persian Government could be held* liable, all that could be claimed from it was £20,000. We are very exact in our figures, but the company is perhaps less exact in its claims. I come now to a specially important point from the Persian point of view with regard to article 14. The United Kingdom repre sentative said that, after cancelling the D'Arcy Contract, the Persian Government considered itself no longer bound by article 14 and was not prepared to take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the company's staff and material. I have, however, said that we would respect and protect the company's staff and property, not under article 14 of the contract—since, in our contention, the contract no longer exists—but under the rules of international law. We are bound to assume that undertaking and we are firmly resolved to assume it. We agree that we are bound to protect foreigners and their property in Persia. We have never attempted to deny that obligation, and, consequently, there is no need for anxiety on that account, since, although we shall not protect the company under the D'Arcy Contract, we shall do so as an international obligation. With reference to article 17, the United Kingdom representative reiterates his previous arguments, stating that, in the Persian Govern ment's contention, the tribunal prescribed in that article, which was to be designated by the parties to the Concession, no longer exists, since there is no longer any concession. But, as I explained just now, that is a point on which it is necessary to take up a definite attitude. There are two alternatives: Either the Persian argument is right and the cancellation of the contract was legally valid, or the Persian argument is legally unjustified. If the Persian argument is right, we have done nothing for which we can be blamed. If it is not, the company must apply to our courts and compel us through them to submit to arbitration, i.e., to fulfil the engagement undertaken by us in article 17 of the contract. We should then, however, have first to put a previous question and ask that it should first be considered whether the cancellation was justified or not. If we were wrong in cancelling the contract, we shall naturally be obliged to submit to arbitration. A remedy, therefore, still subsists. The United Kingdom representative has mentioned certain texts in connexion with the rules of international law. He said that there has been a violation of international law because there is a concession involved. It seems to me that there has been a slight change in the British argument. Just now I thought I heard the United Kingdom representative say in his statement that we were in agreement as to the principle, that is to say, he recognised that, until the remedies at municipal law had been exhausted, there was no ground for inter vention in the form of diplomatic protection and that there was no occasion to consider whether there had been a violation of inter national law. I now note, however, or rather I have the impression, that there has been a change in the United Kingdom representative's argument: he says that in this particular case, seeing that a concession is involved, there was a violation of international law for the simple reason that the Concession was cancelled before any recourse had been had to the national courts or any judgment pronounced.19 There is a very simple way of solving this preliminary question, namely, to refer it to the Permanent Court of International Justice. In that way we should receive complete enlightenment as to the principle. The principle does not concern Persia alone. Certainly the matter is of capital importance to us, not only in regard to the particular case we are now considering but for other cases likewise. The principle is of great importance from the international standpoint. I consequently propose that we should ask the Permanent Court whether it considers that before the remedies at municipal law havo been exhausted there has been a violation of international law and whether there is ground for intervention by way of diplomatic protection. M. BENES : I have listened with very close attention to the state ments of the United Kingdom and Persian representatives. They contain a number of arguments and facts which the Council will certainly desire to consider more closely. As rapporteur, I shall in any case need to stutly them in detail and then to get into touch with the parties, so that at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Council I may submit a report on all the various questions involved and on the way in which an attempt might be made to settle the issue. I therefore propose that the Council adjourn the discussion of this item to a forthcoming meeting. {The rapporteur's proposal was adopted.)■hi ntial. Orb No .F. 373-N/32.

THE Secretary-General has the honour to circulate to the Council the following communication, dated the 18th January, which he has received from the Imperial Government of Persia. Geneva, January 19, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Davar to Secretary-General, League of Nations. (Translation.) Geneva, January 18, 1933. I HAVE the honour to enclose, for transmission to the Council of the League of Nations, a memorandum from the Imperial Persian Government in reply to the memorandum from His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. DAVAR. Memorandum from the Imperial Government of Persia. (Translation.) By a contract signed at Tehran on the 28th May, 1901, the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia granted to William Knox D'Arcy, a British subject, a concession carrying the ' special and exclusive privilege to search for, obtain, exploit, develop, render suitable for trade, carry away and sell natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite throughout the whole extent of the Persian Empire for a term of sixty years.' 2. The concession signed by His Imperial Majesty the Shah was signed and sealed by the Prime Minister and countersigned by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Mines, but, in order that the facts may be presented in their true light, it might be well to recall that, at that time, there was as yet no constitu tional government in Persia, and the administration of the country offered no guarantees, and that different parts of Persia were under two influences^—British and Russian—which were already marked by article 6 of the concession^) before they were specifically determined in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. 3. By the terms of the contract the Persian Government granted the concessionnaire—over a territory comprising the whole of the Empire, except five provinces—a great many advantages, including :— {a) Power to acquire the necessary lands, some gratuitously and some at the current price (article 3). (6) Freedom from all imposts and taxes for the lands acquired during the term of the concession (article 7). {c) Freedom from taxes and custom-house duties for the necessary material and apparatus when imported, and for all products obtained in accordance with article 1 when exported (article 7). The concessionnaire was authorised to found one or several companies for the working of the concession (article 9). He was to give notice to the Govern ment of such formation, through the medium of an Imperial Commissioner, who, in conjunction with the concessionnaire, was to establish such supervision as he might think desirable to safeguard the Persian Government's interests. The first company for working the concession was to be founded before the 28th May, 1903. C 1 ) Article 6 mentions the five provinces which are excluded from the concession. Ihese five provinces— Azerbaijan, Ghilan, Mazenderan, Astarabad and Khorassan—are situated in the north of the- country and border on Russia. [691 aa—1] bThe uoncessionnaire undertook to employ only subjects of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, except the technical staff, such as the managers engineers, borers and foremen (article 12), He undertook to pay a fixed annual due of 2,000 tomans and a variable due equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits (articles 4 and 10). On the expiration of the term of the concession, all materials, buildings and apparatus then used by the company for the exploitation of its industry were to become the property of the Government, free of charge (article 15). 4. The first company for working the concession was formed in 1903. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, established in 1909, took over all the rights and all the obligations arising out of the D'Arcy Concession. 5. From the beginning of the concession the line of action pursued by the concessionnaire gave rise to disputes— (a) Under article 4 the Government was to receive annually a fixed sum of 2,000 tomans. Years went by and the due was not paid. In 1909 the arrears amounted to 16,000 tomans. The Government made repre sentations to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which refused to make any payment. The Government asked for arbitration, but the company declined. (b) Under article 10 the Persian Government was to be paid annually a sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies that might be formed to work the concession. Up to 1900 no sum had yet been paid under this head. During the Great War the company complained that, in the course of hostilities (in February 1915), pipe-lines had been cut by armed bands, and that, owing to the disturbed state of the country, it would take a long time to repair them, which meant serious losses to the company. For these losses it sought to make the Persian Government responsible in virtue of article 14. The Persian Government replied that the pipe-line, which supplied the British fleet, had been cut by armed bands at the instigation of one of the belligerents. It was not responsible, but proposed to settle the dispute by arbitration, as provided in article 17. The company would not agree to this, and, acting as judge in its own cause, refused to pay the dues (Appendices I and II). 6. The Persian Government employed a sworn accountant, a British subject, Mr. William McLintock, to examine the company's books and accounts and those of its subsidiaries, to ascertain what losses the company might have sustained during the war and to check the calculation of the net profits with a view to the levying of the 16 per cent. In his report the expert stated that the delay in repairing the pipe-lines was chiefly due to the fact that the company's ships had been requisitioned by the British military authorities. He also called attention to the wide discrepancy between the sum claimed by the company (over £600,000) and the real amount of the loss sustained (about £20,000). He further noted that the company deducted from the gross receipts an undue amount in respect of amortisation and considerable sums in respect of interest, and subtracted the income tax on profits before calculating the dues. 7. In consequence of the expert's investigations, a financial adviser lent by the British Government to Persia—Mr. Armitage-Smith—was appointed to settle the questions outstanding between the Persian Government and the Company, either by amicable agreement or by arbitration. He made an arrange ment with the company whereby— (a) He was to calculate the arrears. (b) He was to fix the basis on which the dues were to be calculated. (c) It was decided that, if a dispute should arise in regard to the state of the dues, the method of calculating them, or any contested point, such dispute should be referred, not to the arbitrators provided for in article 17 of the concession (in Tehran), but to London, to an expert accountant to be appointed by the president for the time being of the English Chartered Accountants' Institute, whose award shall be final.'7&gt; 8. Confronted by this text, which was alleged to be purely an interpreta tion of the D'Arcy Concession, the Persian Government found that it was, in reality, an alteration in the concession, and that, consequently, parliamentary sanction was constitutionally necessary. Such, indeed, was the opinion given to the Persian Government, on consultation, by the firm of lawvers Lumlev and Lumley (the 27th July, 1931) (Appendix III). The Government, whose instructions—even the most formal and specific— were not followed, did not submit the Armitage-Smith 'Agreement' for parliamentary sanction. 9. Consequently, the so-called interpretative agreement could only have the provisional force of a modus mvendi. 10. The provisional situation under this modus mvendi had to be brought to an end by the conclusion of a definitive agreement satisfactory to Parliament. 11. The company sought to make the Armitage-Smith Agreement binding. In view of its obstinacy, the Imperial Commissioner redoubled his protests. On the 9th May, 1928, he wrote :— ' I have frequently said, and now repeat, that Mr., Armitage-Smith was not instructed or authorised to draw up an agreement affecting changes in the terms of the D 'Arcy Concession ' (Appendix IV). 12. In such circumstances the negotiations, which had lasted several years, became increasingly difficult. On the 12th August, 1928, the Minister of the Court wrote to the chairman of the company. Sir John Cadman :— £ £ I regret to learn that the negotiations have not as yet led to the desired results. Must I again refer to the community of Anglo-Persian interests in this enterprise? Must I again allude to the obsolescence of the D'Arcy Concession, which was obtained at a time when the Government of the Kadjars did not realise what was being taken from it and what it was giving ? Consult any lawyer you like and you will be told that the concession needs to be remade, recast . . . .' 13. Confronted by this prospect. Sir John Cadman said he was prepared to negotiate with a view to the revision of the D'Arcy Concession. In March 1929 he went to Tehran to discuss the draft of a new concession. 14. Glimpses of an understanding began to appear. Only a few points, remained to be settled. Sir John returned to London to confer with his colleagues upon them. The negotiations continued. 15. Conversation succeeded conversation until 1931. There was still some hope of success. 16. On the 7th August, 1931, to the Government's great surprise and disappointment, Sir John Cadman categorically stated, in a letter to the Minister of the Court, that the revision of the concession could no longer be contemplated. 17. The Persian Government, still convinced of the necessity of revision, had to content itself with determining the basis for the calculation of the dues. 18. Towards the end of 1931 discussions took place, first in Switzerland and then in London, between the Minister of the Court and Sir John Cadman, and a preliminary draft concerning the calculation of the dues was drawn up.( 2 ) 19. On the 8th January, 1932, the Minister of the Court and Sir John Cadman again met at Paris to settle the dues of which the Government was deprived by the Armitage-Smith Agreement. The representative of the company offered an inadequate sum, and the interview was fruitless. 20. The preliminary draft regarding the calculation of the dues had to be drawn up with all possible technical accuracy. It was submitted to lawyers and accountants, and, when completed, was sent to Tehran to receive parliamentary sanction in accordance with the Constitution, followed by the Persian Govern ment's ratification. itatf 21. When it received this document, the Cabinet studied it at great length, list It found that on more than one point the document was complicated and obscure,, fi and might thus lead to differences of interpretation. ^j: ( 3 ) It mav be well to point out that the Minister of the Court had no power to conclude an 'i || agreement on behalf of the Persian Government, fie did nothing binding on the Government, but H' merely endeavoured to find formulae that could be submitted to it. [691 aa—1] b 2It therefore asked the company to furnish explanations, and to send a representative to Tehran for that purpose. 22. The company refused. 23. The Persian Government s last hope was thus extinguished. 24. With the utmost patience it had continually endeavoured for years past 1.0 secure the revision of the concession. The concessionnaire had explicitly promised revision, as witness Sir John Cadman s correspondence. It was a complete rearrangement that was necessary. The Government had subsequently Deen forced to abandon this solution and content itself with limited results in an arrangement confined to the method of calculating the dues. Even reduced to these terms, the negotiations came to nothing. 25. Proceeding, then, to make a general examination, the Government found how little the concession brought it in. n j If, instead of stipulating for dues, it had put all its deposits gratuitously at the disposal of the concessionnaire, while leaving him subject to the ordinary tiscal law, it would have drawn, between 1905 and 1932, from the taxes levied by the Customs Department alone, a sum of £19,998,509 165., whereas actually, between 1901 and 1932, it received only about £11 million. 26. For more than four months the Persian Government continued to examine the various aspects of the problem. It saw no solution but to notify the company of the cancellation of the I)'Arcy contract. As a last proof of goodwill, however, it intimated that it was prepared to conclude a new contract with the company in which the interests of both parties would receive equal consideration. 27. There was nothing surprising in this decision. In the case of a contract in which each party's obligation depends on the other's obligation, it is not allowable for one party to require that the other shall continue to fulfil his engagements while failing to fulfil his own. Every legisla tion in the world establishes the principle that every synallagmatic contract is subject to the tacit recissory condition that the failure of one party to discharge his obligations authorises the other to regard himself as released from his own. The numerous grave and continued failures of the company to discharge its obligations incontestably gave the Persian Government the right to release itself in this way from obligations for which there was no longer any adequate equivalent consideration. (a) When a source of wealth is placed by nature in a certain territory, it is only just that it should serve for the economic development of that territory. Foreign assistance does, of course, deserve remuneration; but it cannot demand excessive profits to the detriment of the country, and still less can it be allowed to obtain the concession of a monopoly for the purpose of deliberately limiting the exercise of that monopoly. It is inadmissible that, when Persia grants a concession over a territory larger than Germany and France combined, as Mr. Winston Churchill said in the House of Commons on the 17th June, 1914, the extraction of oil should be confined for more than thirty years (out of the sixty for which the concession was made) to an area of little more than 1 square mile. Yet such is the fact. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which derives its power from the Persian deposits, is continually extending its activities outside Persia, but in Persia it confines itself to a restricted exploitation—a line of action that is particularly inacceptable because the conceding party receives not a fixed sum, but a sum varying according to the extent of the exploitation. Such an understanding and such an application of the contract are certainly inconsistent with its spirit. There are, however, other points on which the concessionnaire disregards even the explicit terms of the concession. (b) The concessionnaire explicitly undertakes to carry out in Persian territory all the operations necessary for making the oil available for trade. This may be seen from the terms of article 1, which uses not merely the words search for, obtain, exploit, but also '' develop, render suitable for trade '' (referring to petroleum and other products mentioned in the article), throughout the whole extent of the Persian ^Empire. Notwithstanding this text, the Anglo -Persian Ou Company performs the greater part of the preparatory processes on Persian petroleum outside Persia. (e) According to article 12, the workmen employed in the service of the company must be subject to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, except the technical.■i f staff, which is limitatively defined as ' such as the managers, engineers, borers and foremen.' The concessionnaire infringes this undertaking indirectly by constructing refineries and other works outside Persia, and directly by employing Indian workmen in Persia itself, despite the Government's repeated protests. {d) Article 10 plays a vital part in the structure of the concession contract. It is the only article that settles, from the pecuniary standpoint, the division of the profits between the two contracting parties associated in the undertaking : &lt;C A sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies that may be formed ' is to be paid annually to the Government. The execution of this article has always been seriously incomplete. The concessionnaire not only flatly refuses to pay the 16 per cent, on the profits of certain of its subsidiaries, but even in respect of those that it agrees to subject to the dues it calculates them on bases which the British expert McLintock has shown to be incorrect; even the accounts produced are of such a nature that Mr. Armitage-Smith. notwithstanding all his friendliness towards the company, does not hesitate to write : 'In my opinion, these accounts are somewhat ambiguous ' (letter to the Persian Prime Minister). These quotations are given merely to indicate the state of affairs. The full gravity of the breaches of obligations in connexion with the dues can only be established by a thorough examination by an accountant. (e) In addition to all these fundamental breaches of obligations, the under taking regarding the procedure provided for in article 17 of the concession has not been observed. It reads :— tc In the event of there arising between the parties to the present concession any dispute or difference in respect of its interpretation or the rights or responsibilities of one or the other of the parties resulting therefrom, such dispute or difference shall be submitted to two arbitrators at Tehran, one of whom shall be named by each of the parties, and to an umpire who shall be appointed by the arbitrators before they proceed to arbitrate. The decision of the arbitrators, or, in the event of the latter disagreeing, that of the umpire, shall be final.' On several occasions the Persian Government has been in disagreement with the company and has asked it to refer the dispute to arbitration; but the company has always refused (see Appendices II and V). 28. According to the most undisputed principles, the failure of one party to discharge his obligations entitles the other not to discharge his own; this rule of justice and equity is known to all legislations, though they may differ as to the manner of putting it into effect. Roman law allows the party suffering by the non-fulfilment of the obligations assumed towards him to notify the other party that he reciprocally regards himself as released from his own obligations. French law requires the party to apply to the courts in order to vindicate his rights. As between these two types of legislation, Persian law shares with Roman law the following rule : The party may himself, of his own motion, cancel the contract in case of complete non-fulfilment or partial but serious non-fulfilment. It is beyond question that that is the character of the non-fulfilment in numerous grave forms of which Persia had to complain. There can be no grievance against the Persian Government for having followed the principle of Persian law. It could not be asked to resort to the procedure laid down in article 17; for, inasmuch as it was cancelling the contract, it would not, without contradicting itself, regard itself as bound by any article of that contract—the more so because the article in question was one that the other party had always refused to observe. Moreover, the decision taken was not one against which the company had no remedy. If it regarded the cancellation as infringing its rights, it had only to apply to the courts. Two lines of action were open to the company : either to negotiate with the Persian Government, which announced that it was prepared to conclude a new contract with the company on equitable bases, or to apply to the Persian courts. 29. Such being the situation, it can only have been through a misunder standing that the British Government felt called upon to intervene. 30. To interpose between the parties amounted in effect to a claim to remove from the jurisdiction of the municipal courts a dispute which naturally belonged to them, and hence to infringe Persia's jurisdictional independence. m m r r v I f a JThe Persian Government had therefore legitimate reason to be surprised at the terms in which the British Government informed it of its request to withdraw the cancellation notified to one of its nationals. 31. The Persian Government might have appealed to the League of Nations to enforce respect for its jurisdictional independence. Indeed, it intended to do so, as it informed the British Government in its letter of the 12th December, 1932 (Appendix VI). 32. As a result of this letter, the British Government thought fit to take the initiative by summoning the Persian Government before the Council in virtue of article 15 of the Covenant. 33. Such a summons is contrary to the terms of that article. 34. Article 15 requires a 'dispute likely to lead to a rupture.' But the dispute can only exist when a Government has, by means of diplomatic protection, taken up the cause of one of its nationals. But diplomatic protection presupposes—&lt; (1) A violation of general or conventional international law. (2) The previous exhaustion of municipal remedies. A procedure of cancellation based on the non-fulfilment of a contract is incontestably not a violation of international law. Even if the cancellation was unfounded, diplomatic protection could only come into play after the municipal courts had been given an opportunity of dealing with the matter. On this point international law is quite definite. 35. This is a principle of which the British Government quite recently reminded the Finnish Government before the Council {Official Journal of the League of Nations, November 1931, p. 2217) :— '' There is a perfectly well-established rule of international law and practice to the effect that a State is not entitled to make any diplomatic claim on behalf of its nationals against another State in respect of any matter where, if the claim is valid, the municipal law affords a remedy, unless such municipal remedies have been exhausted. If the private persons concerned have failed to exhaust their municipal remedies, there is no foundation for any diplomatic claim.' Lord Cecil, representing the British Government before the Council, said {Official Journal of the League of Nations, November 1931, p. 2080) :— ' I was surprised to read in the Finnish memorandum that the Finnish Government throws doubt on what is a perfectly well-established principle of international law—namely, that, in a private claim of this kind, no diplo matic intervention can be used unless the parties have already exhausted all the remedies of the courts in the country against which they are making their claim.' And later :— '' Both on principle and in virtue of the words of the Covenant and of previous decisions of the Council, it was undesirable for the Council to embark on a discussion of a question which was really a matter of private law and not of public international law. He submitted that, if the Council took a different view, very serious inconveniences would arise.' We read in the British memorandum of the 14th September, 1931 {Offociol Journal of the League of Nations, November 1931, p. 2231) :— 'It is clear that this is a claim which must come within the scope of the well-established rule of international law that the individuals concerned must have exhausted all their remedies under the municipal law of the country concerned as a condition precedent to the right of the Government whose nationals the claimants are to take up the claim and make it its own, and present it through the diplomatic channel. In such a case, unless and until this condition precedent has been fulfilled, the claimants' Government has no right to take up the case diplomatically at all, and, if the condition is fulfilled, must base its case on the failure of the country concerned to fulfil11 its international obligations to provide a system of law and of courts of justice through which private individuals may obtain redress in conformity with the requirements of international law. Until the municipal remedies have been exhausted, it is obviously impossible in such a case to contend that a State has failed to fulfil its international obligations in this respect. Until this condition has been fulfilled, such a claim cannot assume an international character at all.' A little later, in the British Government's memorandum to the Council, in reply to the Finnish Government's memorandum of December 1931 {Official Journal of the League of Nations, March 1932, p. 813), we read : 'In paragraph 4 of the Finnish memorandum of December 1931 it appears to be argued that, as between members of the League, the provisions , of the Covenant in some way involve the abrogation or supersession of this well-known international rule. His Majesty's Government cannot help observing that this contention is somewhat startling, and that few members of the League can have contemplated when they accepted the Covenant that the result was that the machinery of the League could be used to take the place of the municipal courts as a means by which the claims of foreigners in respect of matters within the jurisdiction of those courts should be adjudicated 'Finally, if a dispute were properly referred to the Council under article 15, which arose out of a matter in respect of which a municipal remedy had not been exhausted, there is nothing whatever in article 15 to suggest that the Council should ignore this fact in dealing with the matter. Indeed, the fact that municipal remedies have not been exhausted might itself form a valid ground on which the Council might find that the case was one which came within the provisions of paragraph 8 of article 15, and decline to make any further recommendation on this ground.' 36. Like His Britannic Majesty's Government, the Imperial Persian Government keenly desires that the present incident should not disturb the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between His Britannic Majesty's Government and itself. 37. It is the more assured that this will not be the case, inasmuch as, in this instance, it confines itself to endorsing the British Government's own declarations to the Council quoted above. 38. For the reasons stated in the foregoing paragraphs, the Imperial Persian Government considers it to be clear that, in the case in question, the British national concerned has not only not exhausted, but has not even begun to utilise the legal remedies open to him under Persian municipal law, and that, accordingly, the condition precedent to diplomatic intervention, in conformity with the recognised rules of international law, not having been fulfilled, the British Government has not, and has never had, the right to make a diplomatic claim in respect of the present case, a fact which, in virtue of paragraph 1—and, in any case, of paragraph 8—of article 15, precludes, under the terms of article 15 itself, any application of that article. Appendix I. Sir C. Marling to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (Translation.) Tehran, 22 Rejab, 1335 {May 14, 1917). I HAVE had the honour to receive your Highness's note, dated the 6th Jamadielula last, in which you proposed that the dispute between the Imperial Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be submitted to arbitration, in accordance with article 17 of the deed of concession. Ir.: reply, I beg to inform you that, if it is the Persian Government's intention to confine the appeal to arbitration to the examination of the correctness of tile amount of the sums claimed as reparation by the company, the latter is prepared to accept the Government's proposal. If, however, the Government wishes to refer to arbitration {a) the question of the company's right to withhold the Government's dues pending the settlement of its claim, or (6) the company's right8 to take reparation for the losses it has sustained (through the negligence of the Government, which is bound by article 14 of the D Arcy Concession to secure the safety of the company), the company cannot accept this demand, since the arbi tration clause does not operate in respect of these questions. CHARLES M. MARLING. Appendix II. Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Sir C. Marling. (Translation.) Tehran, 14 Zilhajeh, 1335 (September 1917). I HAVE had the honour to receive your answer of the^ 22nd Rejab, 1335, regarding the dispute that has arisen between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In reply, I beg to draw your attention to the tact that article 17 oi the D Arcy Concession clearly provides for a reference to arbitration as proposed by the Persian Government. That article stipulates that disputes and differences of every kind in respect of the interpretation of the concession or the rights or responsibilities of one or the other of the parties shall be submitted to arbitration. I therefore give my full support to the protests made by the Imperial Commissioner against the withholding by the company of the Persian Govern ment's dues (£19,600 for the year 1915 and £24,747 for the year 1916). I regard the action of the company, which, in violation of the principles of ordinary law has taken upon itself to be judge in a case in which it is itself interested (no man can be judge in his own cause), as wholly illegal and arbitrary The specific object of the provision for arbitration in the deed of concession was to ensure that the principles of law to which I have just referred should be respected, and that this means should be employed to put an end to disputes. Although it was essential that these principles should be respected, the company has violated them: — 1. By withholding the said sums of its own motion, without waiting for the arbitral award; 2. By declining arbitration after acting illegally towards the Imperial Government, and thereby closing the door to the only means of settling the dispute. The Government, having undertaken to ensure the safety and protection of the company in Persian territory, is prepared to pay any sum that may be found due by it in consequence of the arbitral award. The company's proceedings, however, and its withholding of Persia's royalties, are intolerable. It is essential that the dispute as a whole be submitted to arbitration, and that, as a preliminary, the company pay over to the Government the dues it has improperly withheld. I trust that, in consideration of right and justice, and of the cordial and friendly relations that exist between the two countries, your Excellency will lend your good offices to the Persian Government with a view to reaching an equitable settlement of this dispute by arbitration. I also hope that, in order to protect the economic interests of both parties, you will prevent the company from persisting in an attitude which is making an unfavourable impression upon public opinion. The Imperial Government, I repeat, will respect the arbitral award, what ever it may be, and will put it into effect. Should the award assign damages to the company, however, since the Persian Government has done all in its power to protect the company's interests and is not responsible for the manoeuvres and operations arising out of the Great War, it will be only just and fair that the sum adjudged and paid by the Government should be refunded to it, at the time of the general liquidation of war damages, by those who bear the real responsi bility for the losses sustained. . , Trusting in His Britannic Majesty's Government's spirit of justice ana fairness, I cherish the firm hope that your Excellency will agree entirely to the just claims of the Persian Government.9 Appendix III. Messrs. Lumley and Lumley to Farid-es-Saltaneh. 37, Conduit Street. Bond Street, Your Excellency, London, July 27, 1921. WE have the honour to inform you that we have now perused and considered the various documents you have laid before us, and beg to submit the following observations for your consideration. Apart from the agreement of the 22nd December, 1920, between the Imperial Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), requiring ratification to make it binding on the Government, we are rather inclined to the view (although it is not easy to advise with confidence) that, in entering into the agreement, Mr. Armitage-Smith may have exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the letter of the 29th August, 1920. These powers were limited to the final adjustment of all questions in dispute between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Government of Persia, and if such powers are to be constructed strictly, they certainly do not appear to authorise his entering into and signing an agreement, on behalf of the Imperial Government of Persia, effecting extensive variations in the terms of the original concession to the detri ment of the Imperial Government. It is to be observed that a perusal of the statement drawn up ^by Mr. Armitage-Smith for the opinion of counsel shows that nowhere does he ask counsel to direct their mind to the question whether he had authority to enter into the alleged agreement under the powers conferred upon him, and no copy of the letter of authority or of the private instructions of the 29th August, 1920, appears to have laid before them. The joint opinions of two separate sets of counsel have already been taken in relation to the matter including the construction of the concession—namely,, that of Mr. D. M. Kerley, K.C., and Mr. Rayner Goddard, dated the 22nd March r 1920, and that of Mr. Mark L. Romer, K.C., and Mr. W. Gordon Brown, dated the 1st December, 1920. The first-mentioned opinion certainly seems more favourable to the Imperial Government than the second, and it may be mentioned in passing, with regard to paragraph 2 of the latter opinion, which was obtained by Mr. Armitage- Smith, that the view expressed as to the possibility in practice of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company carrying out its threat to divest itself of all interest in the subsidiary companies is based on the assumption that the shares of the company are not held by the public, whereas, as a matter of fact, a very large number of its shares were, and are, held by the public, there being indeed many hundreds, of shareholders. Article 10 of the concession provides for the Imperial Government being paid annually a sum equal to 16 per cent, of the annual net profits of any company or companies that may be formed in accordance with the terms of the concession, and no mention is made of any deduction from such net profits of any kind. Article 1 of the alleged agreement of the 22nd December, 1920, however, makes the 16 per cent, royalty on profits subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions, which are set out in detail in the subsequent articles of the agreement. Moreover, according to the alleged agreement, the royalty is confined to profits- arising from Persian oil only. If, therefore, the view taken by Messrs. Kerly and Goddard in their opinion be correct—namely, that such part of the profits of a subsidiary company as reach the parent company and are reflected in its own profits will form part of the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for royalty purposes—then this cutting down of the 16 per cent, royalty is certainly disadvantageous to the Imperial Government. It is true that Messrs. Kerly and Goddard express this view in regard to only one type of subsidiary company, but the type contemplated by them is an extreme one, and the view would accordingly apply a fortiori to the other subsidiary companies of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It seems reasonable to suppose that, in agreeing to the deductions mentioned in the alleged agreement from the 16 per cent, royalty, Mr. Armitage-Smith was actuated by the fear that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would, and could, carry out its threat to divest itself of all interest in the subsidiary companies, but, as [691 aa—1] cPt&gt; 10 indicated above, the conclusion that this might be possible in practice appears to have been based upon false premises. Again, by article 17 of the concession, any dispute or difference between the parties is to be submitted to two arbitrators at Tehran, one of whom is to be named by each party, and to an umpire who is to be appointed by the arbitrators; the decision of the arbitrators (or, in the event of their disagreeing, that of the umpire) being final. By article 2 of the alleged agreement, failing agreement with regard to the matters referred to, the question is to be submitted to a single arbitrator, whose decision shall be final, such arbitrator, in default of agreement, being nominated by the president for the time being of the Chamber of Shipping in London. Furthermore, by article 9 of the alleged agreement, in the event of any dispute arising in connexion with the calculation of royalty, &amp;c., the question or questions in dispute are to be submitted to a chartered accountant to be nominated by the president for the time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England, the decision of such arbitrator being final. This change in the constitution of the tribunal and the venue of the proceedings might conceivably militate very seriously against the interests of the Government, and, in this connexion, reference may be made to the statement of Messrs. Kerly and Goddard, that one consideration of far-reaching importance must necessarily be : Who is to be the arbitrator whose opinion will ultimately decide between the parties ? With regard to articles 3, 4 and 5 of the alleged agreement, attention is called to the paragraph numbered 5 of the opinion of Messrs. Kerly and Goddard, in which they state that, if the subsidiary companies are formed for the purpose of working the concession or any part thereof (that is, substantially to search for and obtain or to prepare for sale or to sell oil within the Empire of Persia or to carry oil away from the Empire), the royalty payable ought to include an amount equal to 16 per cent, of their profits and that no deduction should be made in respect of the 16 per cent, of the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company itself also included in the calculation of the royalty, on the ground that the first- mentioned amount has been brought into calculation. Our reading of this is that the Imperial Government are entitled to a royalty of 16 per cent, of the net profits of all subsidiary companies formed to work the concession, and also to a royalt}^ of 16 per cent, of the profit^ of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, notwithstanding that the latter may hold shares in such subsidiary companies. Assuming this view to be correct, then, in so far as articles 3, 4 and 5 apply to such subsidiary companies, all deductions stipulated for in those articles would certainly seem to be a curtailment of the Imperial Government's rights; and there are other matters included in the alleged agreement which appear to affect prejudicially the rights and interests of the Imperial Government under the concession. As we understand the matter, it is a question entirely for the Imperial Government whether they adopt the alleged agreement or not, but we venture to think that the various matters we have indicated above point to the conclusion that the adoption of the agreement would mean the Imperial Government giving up important rights and interests under the concession. If, however, it is intended to repudiate the agreement, we are of opinion that steps should be taken to do so as promptly and with as little delay as possible. If there are any further points upon which your Excellency would like to have our views, it will give us much pleasure to place ourselves at your Excellency's disposal. We have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to outstanding questions, I beg to draw your attention to to| these facts. Cartel On the 22nd December, 1926, I sent a private letter to Sir John Cadman 'isclai askino- his kind intervention in bringing about an early settlement of all points igs m undei^dispute pertaining to the years ended March 1924 and 1925, 1926 now being included and, in the near future, 1927. Our interests being identical, I remarked mi then on the distastefulness to me of having recourse to arbitration, and expressed the wish that things might be settled amicably. In Sir John's reply of the tweeat 23rd December he promised to do all in his power to bring about such a settlement, since which date one year and five months have elapsed and we have nM made no material advance. . _ , _ iddaii The company making no movement towards a settlement, m February 192/ epu® I curtailed my holiday in the South, of France, returning to London, and took the searcl initial steps necessary towards having the matter submitted to arbitration. In ;rsiar your letter of the 29th September of that year, you say: ' The difference m in aim opinion .... should appear to be incapable of adjustment. Arbitration, jmaif therefore, would seem to be the only course.' In your further letter of the lanvifi 18th October you say in the last paragraph : 'We appreciate that it is because i fc you believe it to be a rightful claim that you are adopting the procedure agreed on; it is because we do not believe it to be a rightful claim that we have adopted i a ron the same procedure as the only means for the resolution of the difference between (wit us ' However, after all this loss of valuable time, you did not pursue this course, lo-Pes but, through Mr. Spens, vour accountant, made some overtures to Sir William subsi McLintock, hoping thereby to render the arbitration unnecessary. Though of all q Li outstanding questions requiring adjustment the one most disputed contention ggoftK concerns refining allowances, yet all are so essentially linked up that, finding your a suggestions inadequate, I made counter-proposals through S ir William anM McLintock, who, through Mr. Spens, wrote to the chairman on the 11th April JLl last, which proposals were briefly turned down by Sir John Cadman m his reply of the 25th April, no further counter-proposals being offered I In the course of conversation with me the day before his departure ±01 r i ance ! on the 25th April, Sir John said that acceptance of my demands would be II tantamount to tearing up the agreement, to which I replied that, unfortunately, * that was a course adopted by the company when their interests were served to the detriment of the interests of the Persian Government, who, it seems to me, have , L also a say in the matter. Article 10 of the alleged agreement decrees that the company agrees that '' it will not enter into any fictitious or artificial transaction which would have the effect of reducing the amount of royalty fay abler Also, in 1(1 paragraph 7 of the instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith, which appear m the Blue Book of which you have a copy, in Appendix III, p. 20, we read ' Le point de vue du Grouvernement est done le maintien du pouicentage \0 actuel, tout en adoptant les moyens necessaires pour empecher la compagnie de manier ses comptes de fa^on a diminuer la part de 1 Etat persan, soit en soustrayant certains profits ou pourcentages, soit en inscrivant au compte de I'Etat certaines depenses indues, soit en vendant le petrole a pnx reduit. A case in point of the flagrant breach of these obligations is the method adopted by you regarding refining allowance. \ ou will admit that, if the company sold all its oil at 14 .9. 3d. a ton, which costs more than 15s'. to produce not only would there not be a penny of profit to the company, and therefore no royalty to the Persian Government, but it seems to me that, under such circum stances, the company would soon cease to exist. ^ . _ I have frequently said, and now repeat, that Mr. Armitage-Smith was not instructed or authorised to draw up an agreement affecting changes m the terms [691 aa—1] D12 4 -of the D 'Arcy Concession, which act alone is binding on both the company and the Persian Government. The mission entrusted to him in accordance with letter No. 18059 of the 29th August, 1920, in your own publication of the D 'Arcy Concession, was merely to bring about a final adjustment of all outstanding questions between us up to date, and to evolve a practical scheme based on the view expressed in the above-quoted French extract. In drawing up an agreement, he most certainly exceeded his powers; his authority to do so was accepted by you unquestioned, being to your advantage. The alleged agreement has never been officially recognised or ratified by the Persian Government; but, as I have said on various occasions, pending a more satisfactory basis of operation for the future, which I shall be pleased to discuss with you whenever you are disposed, my Government has unofficially acquiesced in this arrangement as a modus vivendi for the time being. Developments have proved that its theory is in practice unworkable. It has had the effect of completely destroying the Act of Concession in many directions to the disadvantage of my Government, which | manifestly should not take place. According to article 10 of the Act of Concession, any company or companies formsd are to pay the Persian Govern ment 16 per cent, of their annual net profits without any deduction or allowance; but the alleged agreement has, so to speak, done away with that vital and all-important article by excluding profits arising from the transport of oil by means of ships and by making deductions for refining, distributing and market ing, &amp;c., all of which is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Act of Concession and to the purport of the instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith. It is obvious that the profits arising out of all subsidiary companies form part of the annual net profits of the parent company and are therefore chargeable for royalty purposes without exception. Article 17 of the Act of Concession provides for arbitration in Tehran, which clause is modified in article 2 of the alleged agreement to a course of procedure which might conceivably be to the disadvantage of the Persian Government. Therefore I think I am fully justified in saying that an agreement which provides so many loopholes of advantage for the company, and which even then is disregarded by them when their own interests are to be served, of which fact the immediate refining allowance question is an outstanding example, is no more binding on the company than on the Persian Government. In conclusion, circumstances being similar, I quote again from paragraph 6 of the instructions given to Mr. Armitage-Smith appearing in Appendix III, p. 20 :— ' En formulant sa reclamation, le Gouvernement imperial n'a point demande un acte de faveur, il n'a fait que revendiquer les droits legitimes qu'il pense avoir contre la compagnie, du chef de certains arrieres et des dividendes indiiment retenus par cette derniere.' I wish to avoid further controversy on these questions, and fervently hope this may be my last communication of such nature. Though the rights are, to my belief, entirely on the side of the Imperial Persian Government, I am still open to any acceptable offer the company may be prepared to make covering all the points enumerated in Sir William McLintock's letter to Sir John Cadman. Failing such, I earnestly request you, without further loss of time, to instruct your legal advisers to get in touch with mine, so that we may reach a final and complete settlement, before summer holiday arrangements intervene and further retard us. I remain, &amp;c. EISSA.13 Appendix V. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His Excellency Sadigh-es-Saltanah, Royal Palace Hotel, Kensington, W. Winchester House, Old Broad Street, Your Excellency, London, E.C. I HAVE to thank you for your letter of the 2nd October, 1909, following on the interview that I had the pleasure of having with you on the 29th ultimo. At our interview you were good enough to advise me that you had received definite instructions to demand from this company either the equivalent of 16,000 tomans, or a reference to arbitration, and I replied that this company, like the original concessionnaire, both for reasons given by the latter in his letter to you of the 18th January, 1909, and also in consequence of information provided to me lately by His Britannic Majesty's consuls in Persia, deny all liability on the part of the concessionnaire for any payment in respect of three springs (' trois mines de petrole situees a Schouster, a Kassre-Shirine-—Province de Kerman-Chahan—et Balcki pres de Bouchir '). By telephone yesterday, you requested me to let you have a reply to your letter before Monday next. I promised to do so, and I now accordingly write to repeat what I said to you verbally. You informed me that your instructions were that, if we do not admit a liability—I think you said, if we do not pay the 16,000 tomans—we must forthwith proceed to arbitration, but I regret that I cannot in the present circumstances advise the directors to do so. I submit that it is not a reasonable request to make to us, until your Government has replied to our legitimate requests for certain information on the subject. Your Government's claim is based on clause 4 of the concession of the 6th June, 1901. That clause, speaking of the said three springs as on the 6th June, 1901, says : ' qui sont actuellement affermes a des particuliers et produisent annuelle- ment un revenu de 2,000 tomans au profit du Gouvernement.' Obviously, then, if at that date the three mines collectively were not ' * actuellement affermes a des particuliers et produisent annuellement un revenu de 2,000 tomans au profit du Gouvernement,' and never have done so, but only produced to the Persian Government some sum less than 2,000 tomans, your Government's claim would be automatically reduced fro tanto. I am informed by His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire that, in regard to the supposed spring (or mines) at Balcki, neither the Persian Government nor any representa tive acting on their part ever did collect anything from c&lt; particulars.' Did they then even collect 2,000 tomans per annum at Kassre-Shirine and Schouster ? I am informed by His Britannic Majesty's consul at Ahwaz that, with regard to the spring (or mine) at Schouster, the spring is farmed out now, as before, at 1,000 tomans per annum, out of which Samsam Khan, who claims a proprietary interest in the spring, receives 550 tomans, the Mustafi (or Treasurer) of the Persian Government 450 tomans per annum. This has been regularly paid to the latter, who has acknowledged its receipt to His Britannic Majesty's consul. As regards Kassre-Shirine, as I told you verbally, detailed authentic information has not yet reached me from His Britannic Majesty's consul, but it has been promised, and I hope to get it by any mail, when T will advise you of its purport. You have told me that, since May 1901, no money has been received by the Persian Government in respect of any of these ' trois mines.' If that be so, then your Government must apply to the Mustafi at Schouster for the 450 tomans per annum which he has collected and not paid in— i.e., 3,600 tomans. But in any case it is incumbent, under the terms of the concession, on your Government to give me the names of the persons ' c particuliers ' who were paying money in this connexion to your Government, and details of how much each one had paid annually, prior to the signature of the concession. We asked specifically for this, among other information, in our letter to you dated the 8th September last, and I have to ask you to procure and give me this14 simple information in substantiation of your Government's claim before we can go further into the matter. I am, &amp;c. C. W. WALLACE, y ice-Chairman Appendix VI. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Hoare.

(C./70th Session/P.V.6(l).) THE members of the Council were represented as follows : United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Mr. Eden, replaced by Mr. Cadogan; China by Mr. Wellington Koo; Czechoslovakia by M.

Dispute between the United Kingdom and Persia in regard to the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (continuation). M. Davar, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M. Benes presented the following report and draft resolution^) ' I have made a careful study of the statements made at the Council table by the honourable representative of the United Kingdom and the honourable representative of the Imperial Persian Government, and I have co-ordinated them with the documents already in our possession. ' The Council is sufficiently acquainted with the facts and contentions in the present case, in view of the written documents and verbal statements of the two parties. I therefore do not think it necessary to give a detailed account of all the facts and contentions put forward on either side. '' As the Council is aware, the Persian Government considers that, so long as the concessionary company has not exhausted the legal remedies which are open to it in virtue of the national law of Persia, the Government of the United Kingdom does not possess, or has never possessed, the right to make the present case the object of a diplomatic claim, a fact which, in the opinion of the Persian Government, renders article 15 of the Covenant entirely inapplicable. ' The Government of the United Kingdom, while fully admitting the general principle on which the contention of the Persian Government is based, maintains that it is not applicable, and cannot be invoked by the Persian Government, in the present case. In addition to this preliminary question, the case involves important questions of law. I do not think it necessary for the moment and in existing circumstances even to mention these questions, for, since the first examination of this question by the Council, I have been able to proceed to conversations and to an exchange of views with the parties concerned with a view to arriving at a provisional arrangement, and I have the satisfaction of informing the Council that I have been able to arrive at a result which, I hope, may lead us to a final settlement of the difference. This arrangement has taken the form of the following conclusions :— ' 1. The two parties agree to suspend all proceedings before the Council until the session of May 1933, with the option of prolonging, if necessary, this time-limit by common agreement. ( 1 ) Document C. 100, 1933, VII. [719 h—I]2 '2. The two parties agree that the company should ikmmediatelv enter into negotiations with the Persian Government, the respective legal points of view being entirely reserved. '3. The two parties agree that the legal standpoint of each of them as stated before the Council in their memoranda and in their verbal statements remains entirely reserved. If the negotiations for the new concession remain without result, the question will come back before the Council, before which each party remains free to resume the defence of its case. '4. In accordance with the assurance given by the Persian Govern ment in its telegram of the 19th December, 1932, to the President of the Council, it is understood that, while negotiations are proceeding and until the final settlement of the question, the work and operations of the company in Persia will continue to be carried on as they were carried on before the 27th November, 1932. ' If my colleagues agree, I venture to propose that the Council approve the present report and adopt the following resolution :— The Council, ' 'Having had referred to it the dispute between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Persian Government:— &lt;c ' 1. Takes note of the cases put before it by the two parties concerned and reserves the right to study them. ' ' 2. Appreciates the wisdom for the two parties to the dispute in refraining from any steps likely to aggravate the situation. £C c 3. Approves the present report, together with the conclusions of the provisional arrangement to which the conversations between the rapporteur and the two parties have led.' ' M. Davar (representative of Persia) : I have transmitted to my Government the text of the agreement in four articles which was drawn up by the ravporteur and which he has just read. I have the honour to communicate to the Council the translation of the telegram which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent to me on behalf of the Persian Government:— cc The Imperial Persian Government, unshakably confident in its right, but desirous of giving evidence of its goodwill, in particular towards the League of Nations, accepts the formula contained in your telegram.' To this acceptance by the Persian Government I should like to add my thanks to M. Benes for all the trouble he has taken. It is both a duty and a pleasure to me to pay a tribute to the spirit of impartiality and justice which he has displayed in carrying out his lofty task. Mr. Eden: In expressing the agreement of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom with the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, I should like to begin by assuring M. Benes of the deep gratitude which His Majesty's Government feels towards him for the untiring efforts he has made during the past week to bring about an arrangement between the parties—efforts which have been crowned with such a gratifying measure of success. It has from the first been the desire of His Majesty's Government that a settlement should be reached between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government, provided always that such a settlement could be negotiated on equal terms. The arrangement which the rapporteur has been able to bring about, and which will form the basis for the negotiations which are about to begin, provides these conditions. His Majesty's Government is therefore hopeful of the outcome of these negotiations. In this matter the true interests of the Persian Government and of the great undertaking whose cause His Majesty's Government has been defending are identical, and I feel confident, therefore, that a new agreement mutually beneficia] to both parties will be reached. Meanwhile I accept, on behalf of my Government, the proposal that the further consideration of this matter by the Council should be postponed until its May session, and I trust that the negotiations may by then have been concluded so that the Council may be able to record a final settlement of the dispute.f ■ a M. Massigli: I should like to express my Government's satisfaction at the agreement which has been reached. The French Government is sincerely glad that a dispute of so delicate a nature as this which has arisen between the two parties has been solved in this way. It is, of course, a provisional solution, but we all feel confident that it will shortly lead to a permanent settlement. I should like also to associate myself with the congratulations and thanks which M. Davar and Mr. Eden have addressed to the rapporteur. Once again his eminent qualities as a conciliator have been successfully employed in the common interests of the parties and in the interest of the Council and its authority. Mr. Lester: I merely wish to associate myself with what M. Massigli has said. A provisional arrangement has been made/which every member of the Council hopes will lead to a settlement of this dispute. I will not for the moment refer either to the questions of substance or to the legal position of either party, but I think we may congratulate the parties and the rapporteur on having reached so satisfactory an arrangement. The President: I should like to express to the rapporteur the satisfaction felt by the Council at the work he has done and the result he has obtained, and I desire to express the hope that the dispute will shortly be settled. The draft resolution was adopted. M. Davar withdrew. m ; H % ri THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT if % CONFIDENTIAL. Oitt.-V&gt;/ 3 3 - S ection 1. [E 933/17/34] No. 1. ^ ^ ^ John Cadman to Captain Eden.—{Communicated hy Anglo-Persian Oil Company, February 13.) Dear Captain Eden, February 13, 1933. THE Persians seem now to regard Dr. Benes's role as finished, and any supervision of our negotiations as an interference on his part. The following is a brief account of what has followed our last meeting on the 3rd February :— PERSIA. 1; r* — February 22, 1933. On Saturday, the 4th February, our representatives in Geneva saw their Excellencies Davar and Ala by invitation to discuss the procedure of negotiations. We pressed the Persian representatives to have a complete draft of a new concession prepared by qualified experts in Europe for discussion, but this appeared to the Persians impracticable. They said that, before discussing any draft, they wished the company to agree on certain points which they were going to submit to the company, or to submit detailed counter-proposals. Our repre sentatives agreed to wait for certain points under ten headings, and the same night before leaving Geneva they received a list of those points. We all met in London on the 6th February and came to the conclusion that the Persian demands were not only extraordinary, but also extremely vague. With all their vagueness, their effect was very much that of his Highness Teymourtache's letter of the 1st April, 1931, with which Sir John Simon dealt so ably in his speech at Geneva on the 26th January. We decided to send our representatives to Paris to see their Excellencies Davar and Ala (who had agreed in Geneva to meet us in Paris) and to try to elucidate the demands of the Persian Government. The attempt at elucidation lasted on Wednesday, the 8th, for five and a half hours. As a result of the conversation of the Persian representatives with our representatives, the Persians were quite unable themselves to elucidate, and admitted that the Tehran demands were extremely vague, and suggested one of two alternatives : either that the Persian Government should produce in Tehran a complete draft of a new concession, say, in the course of the next six weeks, or that a draft should be submitted by the company after further elucidation had been obtained by them from the Persian Government by telegraph, which would be very difficult. Our representatives said that they wished to report to London. On Thursday, the 9th February, we came to the conclusion in London that, in order to expedite matters, it would be better for the company to prepare a general outline of a scheme for a new concession and send it to their Excellencies Davar and Ala in Paris. We accordingly instructed our representatives to see their Excellencies Davar and Ala on Friday and inform them of our intention. Our representatives saw his Excellency Ala only on Friday, the 10th. His Excellency Davar had a luncheon engagement. When his Excellency Ala was informed of our decision, he stated that it would be just as well to transfer everything to Tehran at once, as neither he nor his Excellency Davar had any authority to discuss any scheme with us. He told our representatives that the ten points '' above mentioned were produced only because M. Gulbenkian, who, we understand, is on the staff of the Persian Legation in Paris, pressed them to put before the company concrete proposals. According to his Excellency Ala W J M. Gulbenkian strongly advised such proposals on the ground that I had explained to him that without such proposals the company could not negotiate. I cannot confirm his Excellency Ala's understanding of any conversation I had with M. Gulbenkian. However, out of the three-quarters of an hour's conversa tion with his Excellency Ala, about twenty minutes were spent in a discussion with constant reference to M. Gulbenkian, of whom you may have heard. On Saturday, the 11th, we received from our resident director (Mr. Jacks) m Tehran a telegram stating that at the request of the Minister of Finance (his i!|||l [719 y—1]2 Excellency Taqizadeh) he had that day had an interview with the Minister, at which he was informed of his Excellency Taqizadeh's appointment to negotiate with the company in Tehran ' in accordance with the League's decision.' Hi s Excellency Taqizadeh expressed his readiness to begin negotiations at once, and asked if Mr. Jacks could tell him the date on which the company's representatives would arrive in Tehran. Mr. Jacks stated that he had no information as to the date, but would refer the question to London. His Excellency Taqizadeh stated that he understood from the representatives of the Persian Government in Europe that we were disinclined to commence negotiations until the principles had been agreed, but he stated that it was impossible for the Persian Government to negotiate by telegram. He indicated that it was necessary to complete negotia tions before May, and added that responsibility for any delay would lie with the company. We had a few days before received another telegram from Mr. Jacks, in which he stated the feeling of the Persian Government that, in the existing condition of 'public opinion,' which they, of course, had created, serious negotiations elsewhere than at Tehran were out of the question. The reality of this position we are now forced to recognise. For the time being at least, we must abandon the hope entertained at Geneva that the venue of the discussions should be some neutral point in Europe, free from the influences of either London or Tehran, but accessible to experts and, above all, to the mediating influence of Dr. Benes himself. Obviously we do not want any delay. We are ready to go to Tehran, and, indeed, are preparing to do so. The only thing that we now want to elucidate and, if possible, establish finally is the role of Dr. Benes. In view of the Persian mentality, which you know as well as we do, we feel that it is our duty to keep Dr. Benes informed of all the important stages of our negotiations. I will telephone to you to-morrow at Geneva at 7 p.m ., Geneva time. If that hour is not convenient to you, please leave a message indicating the exact hour when you wish me to ring you up. I should not have troubled you with a telephone conversation unless I felt that the matter was of great importance and urgency. Somehow I feel that whatever we do at this stage may create a precedent in the history of the League as to the role of the rapporteur. Yours sincerely, JOHN CADMAN. [E 1010/17/34] No. 2. Br. Benes to Davar Khan.—{Communicated hy United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, February 20; Received in Foreign Office, February 22.) Mon cher Ministre, Geneve, le 17 fevrier 1933. JE viens d'avoir, comme rapporteur devant le Conseil sur le differend anglo- persan, une conversation avec le representant du Gouvernement britannique. II a quelques inquietudes au sujet des negociations entre le Gouvernement persan et la compagnie qui sont en cours. II m^a demande des nouvelles a ce sujet et lui-meme m'a mis au courant de ce qu'il sait de la part de la compagnie. En le remerciant pour les informations donnees, je lui ai dit que je me mettrai en contact avec votre Excellence pour voir si et dans quelle forme mon intervention est necessaire dans I'etat actuel des choses, vu que mon role consiste d'abord de donner des interpretations de 1'accord, survenu entre les deux parties —evidemment si cela est necessaire et si je suis demande de le faire—et ensuite de rester en contact avec les deux parties pour voir le developpement des negociations et tenir au courant les bureaux du secretariat qui ont pour devoir de suivre 1'affaire. Le delegue britannique m'a dit que des difficultes ont surgi au sujet de I'endroit des negociations. Je lui ai repete ce que nous avons etabli entre nous a ce sujet, ici a Geneve, en maintenant mon point de vue, a savoir qu'il existe un danger si les negociations etaient transportees immediatement, soit a Londres, soit a Teheran, avant que les lignes directrices et de principe de 1'accord ne fussent tracees.J'ai, toutefois, constate qu'il ne m'appartient pas de faire a ce sujet des objections formelles quelconques, sous deux conditions, a savoir : (1) si les deux parties se mettent d'accord a ce sujet et si la compagnie est prete a envoyer son representant a Teheran ou si les delegues persans sont prets a se rendre a Londres, et (2) si les deux parties continuent a proceder de telle fagon pour qu'elles puissent etre en contact avec moi comme rapporteur, soit pour m'informer periodiquement de la marche des negociations, soit pour avoir des interpretations de 1'accord si besoin s'en fait voir. Voila, mon cher Ministre, ce qui j'ai voulu vous communiquer en ce moment, en vous priant de vouloir bien me faire savoir Tetat actuel des negociations et si, de votre cote, il y a quelque chose ou mon intervention est necessaire. Mon devoir est, en effet, de demander des renseignements de tous les deux cotes pour pouvoir rester le rapporteur absolument impartial et objectif. Je suis, du reste, convaincu qu'il n'y a pas et qu'il n'y aura pas de difficultes quelque peu serieuses dans vos negociations. Veuillez, &amp;c. D r . EDVAED BENES [E 1011/17/34] No. 3. Mr. Cadogan to Dr. Benes.—{Communicated hy United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, February 20; Received in Foreign Office, February 22.) Your Excellency, Geneva, February 19, 1933. I VENTURE to address to your Excellency the following letter in confirmation of my recent statement to you concerning the negotiations between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company :— As appears clearly from the letter from Sir John Cadman which I showed to your Excellency, the representatives of the company have experienced considerable difficulties in their negotiations in Paris; the Persian representatives have indicated that, in their view, the negotiations should be transferred to Tehran, and in all the circumstances the company have come to the conclusion that it would be best to adopt this course, though they are anxious to make it clear that their understanding was that it had been agreed that the negotiations should be conducted in some neutral place under the auspices of yourself as rapporteur to the Council for this question. The company have expressed the hope that, should the need arise, they might still be able to count on your friendly assurances of assistance and mediation. I ventured at our interview to enquire whether your Excellency would be good enough to communicate at once with the Persian representatives, calling their attention to the fact that this new development was not consonant with their former undertaking, and making it clear that, though it was not your desire at the moment to raise any objection to the transfer of negotiations to Tehran, your Excellency, nevertheless, had no intention of dissociating yourself from the negotiations, and that, in the event of further difficulties arising, you would reserve your rights to take such measures as might seem appropriate to keep the negotiations within the framework of the arrangement which the Council of the League had approved and from which you had no power to authorise any departure. I beg to express my gratitude to your Excellency for the friendly way in which you received my request, and for your kind promise to assist on the lines indicated. I take this opportunitv, &amp;c. A.

AS I have reported by telegram, His Imperial Majesty the Shah received me yesterday morning, in order that Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd might take his leave of His Majesty on the termination of his appointment as military attache to this Legation. The Shah, with good-humoured earnestness, expressed the hope that Colonel Dodd would resume normal military duties, indicating that, in his experience, true happiness was only to be found in the ranks of the army. Colonel Dodd replied suitably, and the Shah wished him good-bye, saying that in wishing him all prosperity, his good wishes included the British army. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who interpreted, had told me that His Majesty wished to have a talk with me, and tea and cigarettes were then brought in. 3. His Majesty began the conversation a little unsuccessfully by suggesting that this was my first winter here. We then compared this winter with last, and I hazarded the suggestion that the mildness of this winter was responsible for the epidemic of influenza; I was glad to think that His Majesty had quite recovered from his attack. His Majesty's health and the mention of winter served as an introduction to an enquiry after the Valiahd and whether he was keen on winter sports. His Majesty's reply was to the effect that he was afraid that he was too keen and might damage himself skiing. And this led me to aeroplanes via Mr. Buckingham, who is now here, having delivered the Tiger Moth aeroplanes recently acquired by the Persian Government, and who is a first-rate performer on skis. His Majesty said that he was very pleased with these machines, and mentioned the loss of one through the incompetence of the pilot, and suggested that it would be a good advertisement for the company to replace it. I replied that I would repeat his words to Mr. Buckingham, expressed my gratification at His Majesty's satisfaction with the machines, said that our experts were fully convinced that British machines were the best in the world, and mentioned the great flight to South Africa. His Majesty had seen an account of the flight, and quite agreed about the supremacy of our aeroplanes. 4. At this point I formed the impression that His Majesty was waiting for me to talk business, and I mentioned the impending departure of Sir J. Cadman and his collaborators for Tehran. His Majesty replied that Davar had reported this, and that he hoped Sir John would be prepared to reach a satisfactory settlement. He quite understood that the directors must have the welfare of the shareholders at heart, but he felt that, considering the great interests that both the British and Persian Governments had in the concern, the directors should not regard it as a simple money-making business like any ordinary company. He hoped that His Majesty's Government took a similar view, but he feared that they were not animated by friendly feelings towards Persia and did not share his desire for good relations, of which evidence was furnished by the attitude and conduct of the Persian Government subsequent to the cancellation of the concession. I suggested, in reply, that when the Persian Government pressed the company to send a mission here last spring to embark on negotiations, they had no idea how grave a crisis threatened the industry as a whole; the obvious and urgent need was for the leading oil companies to determine measures to save the industry from collapse. It was no great exaggeration to compare the action of the Persian Government last spring, when they required the company to send representatives here in order to discuss and establish a new basis for their relations, with that of a landlord who, with the house already on fire, wished his tenant to start talking about details affecting the manner in which he paid his rent. As for His Majesty's Government and their views on the subject of Persia, [747 g-1] 9 J I I'M 11 ri H2 they were unchanged. Their interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, their desire to see the world settle down and prosper, and every other possible consideration must convince His Majesty that there was no deliberate hostilit}^. I wondered whether his impression that the policy of His Majesty's Government was hostile to Persia was not the result of attaching undue importance to what he had read in the press. This question was not fully understood, and it was necessary to explain that I meant the adverse criticism of the Persian Govern ment which appeared in the foreign press subsequent to the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession. His Majesty replied that he did not attach great importance to press polemics in general, and none at all to scurrilous personal attacks to which persons who had acquired some measure of prominence were always exposed. But he felt that the attitude of His Majesty's Government was not a just one. He also felt that the entire financial loss resulting from the world crisis should not fall on one party only, but should be fairly distributed As I had used a simile, he would, too, and say that Persia was a man on the verge of suffocation, and His Majesty's Government apparently objected to his fighting for breath. 5. I replied that His Majesty was entitled to hold this view, but I thought he must admit that His Majesty's Government were fully justified in regarding the cancellation of the D'Arcy Concession as an attack on our rights which we had to resist. I said this a little aggressively, rather expecting it to be ill- received. Feroughi may, of course, have toned it down, but, anyhow, the Shah answered quite amicably that we were entitled to defend our interests. 6. At this point I concluded that the Shah had had enough, and I therefore asked Feroughi to say again that the desire of my Government was to see a prosperous and stable Persia. His Majesty explained that a Persia, master in her own house, with a patriotic Government sufficiently strong to run an independent foreign policy, should be one of our political goals, but he greatly feared that this was not the case, and that we resented all manifestations of independence. 7. I assured His Majesty that almost all of what he had just said would have been quite suitable for inclusion in a speech by you on Anglo-Persian relations, but that his conclusion was quite wrong. 8. It would be interesting to know how Feroughi put this into Persian. Up to a point the Shah listened with the impassivity which I imagine he has cultivated, and then started, and ejaculated an angry ' what ? ' Feroughi made a second attempt, this time with entire success, as the Shah laughed with every appearance of real good humour. Shortly afterwards he terminated the audience. 9. On reconstructing the conversation, I notice that I failed to take up the point made by the Shah that ' the entire loss should not fall on one party only.' That he should have said this makes it, I think, abundantly clear that he believes the decline in the Persian royalty to have been out of all proportion to the decline in the receipts of the shareholders and in the income tax received by His Majesty's Government, and it now seems to me possible that a slightly childish sense of being unfairly treated, as well as actual anger at the smallness of the royalty, provoked what Feroughi in the course of the audience called the ' geste ' of cancellation. Other remarks also suggested that the company was unfair. 10. Of course, all this, and the Shah's alleged fear that His Majesty's Government's disposition is ' unfriendly,' can be dismissed as merely an aspect of oriental bargaining, but I do not see that we should gain anything by so doing. I am at present strongly under the impression that it would be well worth while to prepare the ground for the actual negotiations b}^ trying to remove some of the Shah's misapprehensions. This might be attempted by drawing up in the simplest possible form a general statement, reviewing the growth of the company, the policy of the directors, the effect of both on Persian interests, the reasons why subsidiaries were formed, how they were financed, why in some cases the company have resisted the Persian claim to a share of their profits, and so on, and send a translation of it to the Shah through Feroughi, with a message that if there are any points which are not clear, I shall be happy to elucidate them to the best of my ability. 11. Before actually deciding whether to submit such a proposal for your consideration, I shall try and gather from Feroughi, by discussing the audience with him, whether it would be likely to produce any good result.12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 13), and to the Honourable, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 25). I have, &amp;g. R. H. HOARE. P.S. (February 22).—I had intended to send this despatch by the hand of Colonel Dodd on the 20th February, but a sudden indisposition prevented him from leaving. My telegram No. 44 of to-day's date contains a record of my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the audience and the Shah's general outlook. Feroughi confirmed my impression that suspiciousness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's past conduct, which had been greatly increased by his growing mistrust of Teymourtache, was almost certainly the reason for his sudden irruption into the arena and his order for the cancellation of the concession. Feroughi also agreed that the conflict between Teymourtache and the Minister of Finance had probably played a part, in that a natural result of it would have been that the Shah was less well-informed of the facts than usual—perhaps I should say even than usual. But if we are to accept as truthful the astounding confessions of ignorance made by Davar in the course of the conferences with representatives of the company in Paris (Mr. Jacks gave me the records to read this morning), we are led not so much to wonder at the Shah's ignorance and suspicions, but to ask ourselves whether Teymourtache, in spit of his apparently extensive knowledge of the company's affairs, had any real understanding of them. Again, in my conversation with Feroughi, I mentioned the opinion by Messrs. Lumley and Lumley annexed to the Persian statement to the Council of the League. Feroughi's demeanour suggested that this was the first he had heard of this opinion, and it is to my mind quite doubtful whether he has read the Persian statement. Finally, the fear of the Shah is now, as Davar plainly said in Paris, so great that his advisers, ' falsely so-called,' would not dare, even if they had the knowledge, to attempt to clear the atmosphere. And that is why I think we must face the task if the negotiations are to have a reasonable prospect of success. In conclusion, I venture to express my entire agreement with the view of the company, as conveyed to me in your telegram No. 30 of the 18th February, that the visit to Tehran is sound tactics if we believe that a further reference to M. Benes or the League of Nations will be necessary. When I suggested that the visit should not take place, it was with my eye on the negotiations rather than on the possibility of their being abortive, remembering that President Wilson was gravely handicapped at Versailles by not being able to ' refer the point to his Government.''

May 22. 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 2658/17/34] No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 22.) (No. 220.) Sir, Tehran, May 6, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit a brief report on the negotiations for the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession. Full details of a highly interesting, and even dramatic, episode will be furnished to you by Sir John Cadman when he reaches London, together with the text of the agreement as finally signed. 2. Sir John Cadman, accompanied by Mr. P. G. Allen, his private secretary, arrived in Tehran by air from Bagdad on the 3rd April, having previously visited the oil-fields. He had been delayed by bad weather for some days, and the state of the weather had also constrained his travelling companions, Mr. W. Eraser, the deputy chairman of the company, and Dr. W. Young, the company's principal medical officer, to make the journey by road. Dr. W. Idelson, the international jurist, Mr. Duncan Anderson, the company's chief accountant, and Mr. L. N. Lefroy, of the staff of the London office, had arrived a few days previously. 3. The Persian Government for their part had not failed to provide themselves with an array of experts, and there arrived in Tehran about the same time Dr. Hengeler, a Swiss lawyer of some repute, Mr. E. Clapp, who is described as an ' oil expert,' and was in the employment of the Persian Government in that capacity a few years ago, Mr. G. Inchbald, of the firm of Messrs. William McClintock and Co., the chartered accountants, and Mr. Kessan, another lawyer. These experts were kept severely in the background and, indeed, hardly consulted, and apparently, as the result of orders from the Shah himself, it was decided that they should not be present at the negotiations; they had a dreary time, as they were entirely segregated from all foreign society while the negotiations lasted. 4. The negotiations were conducted by Mr. Eraser and Mr. Jacks, the resident director, on behalf of the company, and by Mirza Seyed Hassan Khan Taghizadeh, the Minister of Finance, Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mirza Ali Akber Khan Davar, Minister of Justice, and Mirza Hossein Khan Ala, on behalf of the Persian Government. The first few days were spent in extracting from the Persian negotiators a statement of their desiderata, which for some reason were still in an embryonic state, and Mr. Eraser firmly declined to embark upon any discussion of individual points until assured that the whole of these desiderata had been stated. The Persian demands proved eventually to consist of more than sixteen points, far more fantastic in their scope and variety than the famous ten points communicated to the company's representatives in Paris in February. 5. The Persian case was finally completed on the 17th April, and on the following days is was subjected by Mr. Eraser to a lengthv and reasoned criticism. In the words of Ala, he tore the sixteen points to shreds one after tne other, and made it clear that they were entirely unacceptable and that no agreement could possibly be based upon them. At the request of the Persian Ministers themselves, the company's reply was embodied in a memorandum which was communicated to them on the 21st April and was virtually a draft of a new concession. 6. After this memorandum had been discussed the Persian Ministers stated that an agreement on the basis of the company's draft was quite impossible, and it was agreed on the 22nd April to inform the press that the negotiations had failed. At Sir John Cadman's request, Eeroughi immediately asked the Shah to receive him in a farewell audience, which took place the next morning (the 23rd April) at 10 a.m . It was, perhaps, not a pure coincidence that Sir John s aeroplane was plainly visible from the Palace windows engaged in a trial flight. However this may be, the Shah treated as a joke the statement that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company representatives were leaving the next morning. The [803 y 1]interview was a brilliant success, and Sir John convinced His Imperial Majesty that neither the Anglo-Persian Oil Company nor any other oil company could possibly exploit the Persian oil-fields on the basis of the Persian proposals, and made such an impression that the Shah, to Feroughi's dismay, consented to be present at the next meeting between the Persian and British negotiators. 7. At this meeting the Shah consigned the Persian proposals to the waste- paper basket and gave his Ministers, to their considerable embarrassment, a good-humoured homily, the burden of which was that they, poor earth-worms, had worked away at the details of the dispute and had done their duty in approaching the question from the strictly Persian point of view and in battling to the utmost for every Persian claim. But he, who understood foreign politics, appreciating the need for Anglo-Persian friendship, had decided that the new concession must be based not on mere technicalities, but on broad statesmanship, and had concluded that the proposals of the company would provide a solution of lasting benefit to both sides. He was exceedingly friendly and reasonable throughout the discussion that ensued, and Sir John Cadman was greatly struck by the quickness with which he grasped the point of an argument. 8. With one or two exceptions, all outstanding points were settled at this meeting, and it was hoped that it would be possible to sign a final text of the concession on the following day. It unfortunately proved impossible to complete the work of drafting in the time allotted. When the postponed meeting next took place further points were raised by the Persian negotiators, but they gave way when Sir John Cadman threatened a further appeal to the Shah instead of the farewell audience which had already been arranged prior to the Shah's departure for Mazanderan. 9. The final drafting occupied a further two days, and it was not until 2-20 a.m . on the 30th April that the agreement was finally signed. In the meanwhile Sir John had had a farewell audience with the Shah on the 28th April before His Imperial Majesty's departure for Mazanderan on the following day. 10. Sir John Cadman left Tehran by air for Bagdad on the morning of the 1st May, and the majority of his colleagues left at the same time. He had on the previous evening given a dinner at Mr. Jacks's house, at which the greater part of the Persian Cabinet was present. In a short speech Sir John expressed the hope that the plucked fowl would in course of time grow enough feathers to be able to fly, to which Feroughi replied that he thought the bird was still in full feather. 11. The main points in the new concession are that the royalty on profits is abolished, and that the Persian Government receive instead a royalty on production of 4s. per ton with a minimum of £750,000. They also receive a sum approaching £2 million sterling in settlement of all outstanding claims and as compensation of various kinds, while the company obtain a thirty years' prolonga tion (sixty years from now) of the concession. Even more satisfactory is Sir John Cadman's conviction that there are no cc loose ends,' and that the simple language of the concession renders disputes almost impossible in the future. 12. So far as I can judge, the Persian Ministers, who were at first a little resentful at all their hard, if futile, work being wasted, realise that an excellent bit of work has been done, and that recent misunderstandings were in no sense the fault of the company. The company's representatives appear well pleased I with the new concession, though admitting that in some respects they have had to pay heavily for it. 13. The outstanding points in the negotiations are the skill shown by Sir John Cadman in dealing with the Shah and the Shah's sudden access of statesmanship. The wisdom of Sir John Cadman's decision to keep in the back ground during the course of the ordinary negotiations was abundantly proved by events. It has been suggested that the Shah's role was to some extent stage- managed, and that he gave his Ministers instructions to be obdurate on every point until a rupture seemed inevitable and then to invoke his help, thus enabling him to appear as the deus ex machina who gathered the combined fruits of peace and victory where mere mortals had failed. Personally, I am more inclined to believe that he realised the essentials of the situation, which were that he could not afford to go back to Geneva unless it was clear that the company, and not his Government, were responsible. Having heard Sir John Cadman, he was convinced where the responsibility would lie, and took his decision accordingly-14. I am told that the speed with which the settlement has been reached has revived the legend, reported in my despatch No. 505 of the 30th November, 1932, that the whole business has from start to finish been a comedy staged by the Persian Government and the company, acting in close understanding. 15. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 32), and to His Majesty's consul at Ahwaz (No. 35). I have, &amp;c.

(e) The procedure of arbitration shall be that followed, at the time of arbitra- tlo n, by the Permanent Court of International Justice.

Ill hiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PEESIA. May 19, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 2565/17/34] No. 1. Foreign Office to Mr. Cadogan {Geneva). (No. 342. Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 19, 1933. WITH reference to Mr. Hoare's telegram No. 95 of the 8th May (repeated to you as Foreign Office telegram No. 220 of the same date) regarding the agreement reached in Tehran between the Persian Government and the repre sentatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying copies of the French text and of the company's (provisional) English translation of the new concession which has been granted to the company.^) 2. The text of the concession is now before a parliamentary commission of the Persian Majlis. It appears that discussion of its terms by the Majlis as a whole has been adjourned until the 21st May at the earliest, and it is, therefore, very unlikely that it will be finally ratified and promulgated by the Shah by the time the Council of the League of Nations meets on the following day. According to a later telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, it appears that the Persian Government have now published the full text of the new concession both in Persian and French, but the company are, nevertheless, most anxious that, until the agreement has actually been ratified, any general discussion of its terms should be avoided as far as possible. I am to request, however, that you will now deliver two copies of the French text and of the English translation to M. Benes, in accordance with the promise which has already been made to him (see Foreign Office telegram No. 13 of the 2nd May to His Majesty's Minister at Prague repeated to you as No. 13, Saving, of the same date), explaining orally at the same time the desire of the company to keep the text as far as possible secret pending ratification. 3. The procedure to be followed when the Council meets will, of course, depend largely on the rapidity with which the agreement is ratified by the Majlis. As you are aware, the dispute is due to come before the Council during the present session, and will automatically do so unless His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government agree to make a joint request for postponement. If the agreement is ratified, and the necessary decree promulgated by the Shah, in the course of the week beginning on the 22nd May, it will presumably be possible to dispose of the question finally during the present session, the rapporteur informing the Council that a settlement has been reached between the two Governments, and the necessary statement prescribed by article 15 (3) of the Covenant being drawn up thereafter. If, on the other hand, the requisite action is not taken in time by the Persian Parliament and by the Shah, it will presumably be necessary either to concert with the Persian Government with a view to a joint request being made for postponement of the question until the following session of the Council, or, alternatively, to arrange for M. Benes to inform the Council that he understands that a settlement has been reached, but that as certain necessary formalities are still outstanding he will be glad if the question can be postponed. 4. As you are aware from Mr. Hoare's telegram No. 95 referred to above, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has promised to instruct the Persian delegate at Geneva to concert with you on the question of further procedure. I am to request, therefore, that you will discuss the question both with M. Benes and with M. Sepahbodi, and adopt whatever arrangements appear most suitable m the circumstances, reporting the action you decide to take in due course. I am, &amp;c. C. F. A. WARNEE.

The second reading took place on the 28th May and was passed by a vote of 105 out of 113 Deputies present. There was no debate, but at the suggestion of one of the Deputies an amendment was made m the translation of a word in article 15 (2).

This table shows a surprising correspondence m many years between tne profit which would have been available for the Persian Government under the present agreement and that which they actually received under the D Arcy Concession. In some years the royalty under the concession is even the greater. Whly speaking, the wider the disproportion between the oil exported and the profit made upon it, the greater the benefit accruing to tlie Persian Government under the new agreement. The difference is particularly striking m v fry bad years, such as 1931, when the payment of the royalty on t ^ na ?f ^ deprived—and in a sense will deprive owing to article 23 the shareholders an? profit at all and involved an actual loss on the year s workmg ^ the New Statesman, in the issue of the 13th May, has not been slow to pomt 5.

Anglo-Persian Oil Company New Agreement. THE new agreement was submitted yesterday, the 23rd May, to Parliament. In preliminary debates on the general aspect the following points were raised:— 1. Kashef stated that the privilege granted to the company under section 1 of article 6 to import necessities without special permits wiU weaken ^the eftect of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Act, and it should be limited o e p essential commodities oulv for the company's foreign statt. The Minister of Finance gave assurances that care wlll / , e exer 'f ^4 ^ such imports to goods required by the company s foreign staff, and p that imports effected with foreign capital do not prejudice the ^ de 2. Eeferring to the exploitation of oil in Kermanshah, Mehdavi enquired what steps would be taken if the company failed to inmiediateiy execute the r undertaking. In such a case, reference to arbitration would not remedy the loss of revenue to the public even if the company were forced o pa} 5 million (rials). [831 u—3]2 The Minister of Finance explained that in agreements it is impossibl make provisions for each and every article. When one party fails to fulfil 6 agreement it commits a breach. But the company will not fail to execute th 1 undertaking, and, in fact, five or six days after signature of the agreement received a telegram to the effect that the Khaniqin Oil Company's general mana ^ had started to make necessary arrangements. ^ The terms of the agreement were then discussed. The Minister of Financ in reply to a query from Dr. Taheri, gave the quantities of oil exploited between 1925 to 1932 inclusive, and a comparative table showing Persia's royalty under the D'Arcy Concession and what it would have been under the new agreement Eeplying to a question by Kashef as to whether the question of revision of article 11 will be submitted for approval by the Majlis at the end of thirty years the Minister of Finance declared that nothing will be done without Parliament 's approval. Mer'at asked whether dividends derived from the 20,000 shares belonging to Government are distinct from the royalty question or not. The Minister of Finance explained that dividends are added to the budget and have no connexion with royalty accounts. Dr. Taheri proposed deletion of article 27 as the agreement is being ratified by Parliament. The speaker suggested ratification of the agreement under a single article to be drafted for the second reading.THIS DOC UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOYERNMENT 'fin\ * Wl I July 4, 1933.

' President of the Majlis : 'DADGEE.' 4. Issue No. 18 of the Proceedings of the Majlis actually contains two Persian translations.

The Persian translation in the Proceedings of the Majhs, as quoted above, is headed c&lt; Concession ' in one place, £t Concessionary Agreement in another.

I am of the opinion that the Goyernment should give to the company only those tracts of land, whether waste land or land in use needed by them and situated but as for areas throughout the whole of Persia outside of the concession area, as is mentioned in this article, I am opposed to this.

Article 5 to be read [887 a—7]nptj I ■ 2 When article 27 was read, SHAEIAT-ZADEH made the follow' comments :— n S ' I wished to point out that the second sentence of this article ' superfluous ' [he means the sentence : ' The Government undertakes f submit this concession as soon as possible to the Majlis for sanction''! because this undertaking has already been fulfilled by the Government and the concession is being sanctioned now; there is therefore no necessitv f this to be mentioned here now.' ^ the chairman ; ' Dr. Taheri has also submitted a proposal anticipating this, and the proposal is to be read now :— ' ' To the President of the Majlis, ' ' I suggest that in article 27 the latter part of the article from the sentence which begins with ' The Government undertakes,' &amp;c., to the end of the same article should be omitted.' ' THE RAPPORTEUR : ' This sentence is not needed in the law and it should be omitted. The first sentence of the article 27 is sufficient; the commission is also agreeable to the omission of this sentence and it should not be incorporated in the law.' THE CHAIRMAN : ' The views of the Government, please.' THE MINISTER OF FINANCE : 'I agree that the omission of this sentence does not affect the concession and that there is no objection to its omission.' THE CHAIRMAN : Division is to be taken on article 27 with the omission of the sentence—to the omission of which Government sees no objection. The honourable Deputies who agree with the article will please stand up.' The majority stood up. THE CHAIRMAN: ' The article is sanctioned. The totality of the second reading of the law is to be discussed. Is there any difficulty ? I call upon the Minister of Finance.' THE MINISTER OF FINANCE : ' There is just one word here to be said. As everything is being sanctioned now, I deem it necessary to say here that the French text was of course the copy that was signed. Those who are well versed with the matter know that there are certain punctuations in French which we call 'saja va nada.' One of these marks was omitted in article 15, paragraph 2, as also a sign of the plural at the end of one of these words. It makes a change in the meaning. The omission was by mistake. If that punctua tion mark or that sign of the plural is omitted the sentence will signify that the representative of the Government has the right to attend all of the sessions of the board of directors, and also in another passage it would mean that the Government's representative has the right to attend all the sittings of the general meeting which are convened for the consideration of matters connected with Persia. It would seem as if in the first passage the representative of the Government will have a seat in all of the sittings of the board of directors and according to the second passage he will only have a seat in the general meetings when matters connected with the relations of the company with Persia are under consideration. But this was not our intention. It consisted of one single sentence which was meant to purport that the Persian representative should have the right to attend the sittings of the board of directors and the public meetings when such meetings were held for this same purpose. It makes no difference in the Persian version, which conveys both senses. I meant to invite attention to this mistake, but the company's representative who perused the text detected the mistake and tele graphed saying that the version might be taken to convey the meaning which was not intended. This is why we corrected the text. The Majlis, when sanctioning this law, must, of course, be cognisant of this point before the vote is taken.' (The Deputies : ' Agreed.')THE CHAIRMAN: ' c Do the honourable Deputies agree with correction?' (The Dqnities : 'Yes.') 'Vote is being taken now on the concession as a whole, ihose who are agreeable should give in white papers.' Votes were collected and 105 white papers were counted. THE CHAIRMAN. Those present when division was announced were 113. It is sanctioned with a majority of 105 votes.'THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PEESIA.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accom panying extract from the official minutes of the seventy-seventh session of the Council of the League of Nations, at which Dr. Benes's final report on the dispute between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Persian Government on the subject of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Concession was considered. 2. The Council having taken note of Dr. Benes's report, the dispute between the two Governments may now be considered as finally and officially liquidated. 3. I am to draw your attention to the fact that in his report and covering speech the rapporteur made no reference to the omission from the text of the company's new agreement, as ratified by the Persian Majlis, of the last sentence of article 27 of the agreement as signed, which contained an undertaking by the Persian Government to submit the agreement for ratification by the Majlis as soon as possible. I am to explain that before Dr. Benes's report was laid before the Council this omission was brought to his notice by the representative of His Majesty's Government at Geneva. Since, however, the Majlis had, in fact, already ratified the agreement. Sir John Simon considers that no harm can have been done by the failure of the rapporteur to bring this minor point to the notice of the Council. 4. As you are aware, provision is made in article 22 of the company's new agreement with the Persian Government that in certain specified circumstances the two parties will have recourse to the good offices of the president or vice- president of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague in connexion with the nomination of an umpire or sole arbitrator. It was necessary for His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government to bring this provision to the notice of the Permanent Court, explaining that it had been impracticable to obtain the formal concurrence of the court before the conclusion of the agreement, and expressing the hope that no obstacle would be seen to the acceptance by its president and vice-president of the functions thus conferred upon them. From the accompanying copies of official correspondence exchanged with the registrar of the court on this subject^) you will observe that this matter has now been regularised, and that the provisions of article 22 of the agreement are acceptable to the court in so far as they affect it. I am to add that a letter in terms identical with those of the Foreign Office letter of the 17th August was, by arrangement, sent to the registrar of the court by the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London (Fathollah Khan Noury Esfandiary), who has now, Sir John Simon understands, received an identic reply. 5. In conclusion. Sir John Simon directs me to convey to you an expression of his appreciation of the valuable assistance afforded to him by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at all stages of the dispute.

Dispute between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Government of Persia in regard to the Concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. MIRZA ABOL-HASSAN KHAN FOEOUGHI (representative of Persia) ^ame to the Council table. f 1 ) Not printed. [971 n—1]2 M. Benes presented the following report( 2 ) :— 'At its meeting on the 26th May, 1933, the Council considered the communication from the Persian Government, dated the 1st May, announcing that, as the outcome of the negotiations undertaken at Tehran with the repre sentatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a new concession had been signed by the company and the Imperial Government of Persia. The rapporteur was able to add on this occasion that, having got into touch with the two parties to the dispute, he had found that, as a result of the signature of the new concession, the dispute between the two Governments might be regarded as virtually settled. As, however, the Council was soon about to disperse, the rapporteur begged it to give him an opportunity, at its next ordinary session, of submitting to it a report on the complete and final liquidation of the dispute. ' Since then, there has been another communication from the Persian Government, dated the 5th June (document C.371.M.182,1933.VII), announc ing that the Persian Parliament has ratified the new concession to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. ' The text of the new concession is appended to this report. ( 3 ) f£ In these circumstances, I am happy to say that the Council may take it that the dispute between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Government of Persia, which was brought before it last December, is now finally settled.' Mirza A hoi-Hassan Khan Foroughi (representative of Persia): I have the honour to announce my Government's entire approval of the report placed before the Council. I have nothing further to add. I wish merely to express my happiness at having had this opportunity of making before the Council a state ment testifying to the better relations between my Government and that of His Britannic Majesty. I cannot fail to renew the expression of gratitude tendered by my predecessor to the Council in connexion with this incident nor to offer our warm thanks to the rapporteur, M. Benes, and to the Secretary-General for all the trouble they have taken and the impartiality they have shown. Sir John Simon : I am very happy to be able to join with the representative of Persia in expressing, on behalf of my Government, our satisfaction that this troublesome matter has been brought to a complete agreement, and, at the same time, to join in thanking the rapporteur, M. Benes, for the useful part which he has played in bringing about and reporting that result. My colleagues will recall that it was my duty some time ago to bring this matter before the Council, and that the points of view of the Government of the United Kingdom and that of Persia were then put before the Council. At that time it was still uncertain whether agreement could be reached by the method which is consecrated for use in such cases when Governments are not at one here at Geneva. I take great satisfaction in thinking that the action of the United Kingdom Government in bringing the matter to the Council has resulted in an agreement which is both complete in itself and expresses the continued good relations which, I am sure, will always exist between the Government of Persia and the Govern ment of the United Kingdom. The Council took note of the rapporteur's report. (The Council went into private session.) ( 2 ) Document 0.572.1933.VII.

Mr. IvIylleSp of the Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company, called on Mr. Bagg ^llay this afternoon? accompanied by Dr. Lees, the Company's Chief G-eologist and Mr. ¥. E. Browne, the Company's Surveyor, in order to ask advice about the best vmy of defining the limits of the area or areas totalling 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which the Company were now obliged, before the 31st December 1938 and under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, to choose as those in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. 2. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues explained that up to certain depths of water modern boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea and that there were parts of the sea in the Persian Gulf which the Company wished to include in the area of their potential operations. They understood that His Majesty's Government held that three miles was the limit of territorial waters, whereas the Persian Government claimed a 'oelt of twleve miles. Along most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the Company wished to include in their concession was within the three mile limit. At the northern end of the Gulf, however, there were parts of 'the sea in the twelve mile belt which they wished to include. 3. Furthermore the chosen areas had to be precisely demarcated in order that the Persian Government might be able 'to check the measurements for themselves and ma-ie sure that did not exceed 100,000 square miles in all. This applied 'to the demarcation of such sections of the boundaries as followed/pv 2. followed the coast as well as to inland sections. As the existing naps of Southern Persia were inaccurate it was proioosed to shav/ these boundaries by fixing certain coordinates (whether on land or sea) and joining them together. jilong most of the coast they would fix a number of straight lines just skirting the coast-line on the seaward side, with the object of allowing for uncertainties or future changes in that line and also of rendering mensuration easier. ,At Jask they would carry the boundary out for about three miles. I t was only at the northern end, as had been said, that they wi shg d to carry it out for as far as twelve miles. ■■ ox- '-1 . Ifm, .- i I u.x.-x.iij.j ,' -lil in i ■ nilliiii-luHmiYlfir'' 1 u. The Company v/ished to know whether the submission by them to the Persian Government of plans showing that they had chosen for their concession areas extending beyond the three mile limit? ax)proved as they would necessarily have been by the Board of Directors, of whom two were representatives of His Majesty 1 s Government, would commit His Majesty's Government to a recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of twelve miles. In other words, would His Majesty 1 s Government object to the inclusion in the concession''areas of waters outside ^he three mile limit ? Mr. Baggallay explained shortly the position as regards territorial waters. It was true that His Majesty 1 s Government, largely? he thought&gt; for reasons connected with fisheries, held to the three mile limit. Most other countries accepted this view. Persia, however, claimed twelve miles, though he thought that she regarded this belt as divided into two fringes of six miles each and claimed rights falling short of full sovereignty in the outer fringe. He would look up the Persian law on the subject and let the Company know exactly what it laid down. Other/countries besides Persia, for instance/lS'1 3- instance Norway, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and \ he believed Portugal5 also claimed more than three miles. 6. The position in international law was uncertain- Efforts to reach international agreement on the subject had so far come to nothings and although other countries could not say that His Majesty^ G-overnment were wrong in maintaining that the proper limit was three miles, His Majesty 1 s G-overnment could not say that those countries were wrong in saying that the limit could and should be increased. Thus, if the matter were referred to arbitration the case would prob ably go in favour of whoever happened to be the defendant. If, for instance, His Majesty^ G-overnment took the Persian G-overnment to court because they objected to some act of sovereignty done by the Persian Government or their agents in waters lying between three and twelve miles from the Persian coast, they would probably be told that they had failed to prove that the Persian Government had no right to do what they had done in those waters. If on the other hand the Persian Government took His M&amp;jesty 1 s Government to court because of something done by, say, one of His Majesty^ Ships in such waters, they would probably be the ones to be told that they had failed to show that the y /arship had no right to do what it had done. 7. it was conceivable that, as time went on, the mineral potentialities of the bed of the sea, as brought to light by the problem facing the present laeeting, would prove to be more important than questions of fishing rights and make it desi rable for^His Majesty^s Government themselves to c ^ il11 aore extensive territorial limits. (Dr. Lees quoted a case 1 ift point from the seas adjoining Trinidad). This, however* mere speculation and for the moment His Majesty f s G-overnment were concerned to maintain as best they could, notwi ths tanding//&lt;fh I Jl r u. notwithstanding the uncertain legal position he had described, the principle of the three mile limit. Nevertheless he thought that His Majesty's Government would not wish, if they could possibly avoid it, to press the Company to forego the possibility of boring outside the three mile limit in conditions giving them a reasonable assurance of exclusive possession. He wondered whether? in order to make it as easy as possible for His Majesty's Government to do so, it would not be possible to find some formula whereby the area delimited by the Company could be referred to in such terms as v/ould not identify it too closely with either the three mile or the twelve mile limit. He also enquired whether it would not be possible to say simply that in certain places the boundaries of the concession area or areas were 'the limits of Persian territorial waters'. It was, after all, possible that before the Company's concession expired in 1.993 an international conference might fix territorial waters at six or ten or even twenty miles. Such a formula would guard the Company against all eventualities. In any case he would like to give the matter further consideration. 8. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues thought a suitable formula could be found and said that they also would give it their thought. They did not, however? think that a mere mention of: the 'limits of territorial waters' would be sufficient, since the Persian Government would either regard it as too vague, or else claim that it meant that the whole of tne twelve mile (or at least six mile) limit was include q in the concession areas - which might swallow up a lot of the 100,000 square miles. 9. They next asked how the Company should draw the boundary of their area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, seeing that the frontier was delimited only as far as a point just below/5. 'below Fao on the left 'banlc of the rivex'. After Mr. Baggallay had given a short explanation of the position, as His iv^ajesty ! s li government saw it, under the -1913 Protocol and the Proces Verhaux and of the various methods which had 'been advanced for defining international frontiers where they passed through territorial waters (none of which had, however, universal I internationa1 sanction), he said that so 1ong as the Company choose a 'boundary which left the whole Rooka Channel outside their area he did not thinlv (subject to the question of territorial waters already discussed) that His Majesty's Government would wish to raise any objection to their fixing one of their coordinates at the tip of Marakat Ahadan and from there carrying their line out to sea more, or less as a prolongation of the final section of the left banc of the river. The Company's representatives agreed to avoid the Hooka Channel completely. 10. Dr. Lees then asked what was the position as regards the High Sea s. Would it he possible for the Company, if they wished to do so, to sink shafts in the High Seas, join them together with 'buoys and ropes- and claim exclusive rights within the area thus enclosed ? 11. Mr. Baggallay said that it was considered to he legally possible in certain circumstances to stake a claim to the bed of the sea as opposed to its surface. The pearl fishers in the Persian Gulf might be said to have acquired prescriptive rights to certain banks in the High Seas, and he Relieved that some of the Cornish tin mines extended out to ^ea 'beyond the three mile limit and that His Majesty's Government claimed that the tin deposits -which lay unde r the sea outside the three mile limit could be and had been appropriated. But these were both examples of rights acquired as the result of e xclusive enjoyment and i^ossession during a long period oi time. The/■ — %I S o &amp; The general theory was that the High Seas could not be appropriated by States or individuals and though he thought that there might he nothing to prevent the Company from 'boring anywhere they lilced in the bed of the sea below the High Seas, so long as they did not thereby interfere with navigation or fisheries, it seemed to him very doubtful if they would be able to shut off a larger area than they needed for each shaft and claim exclusive rights within that area. In other Yfords they would not be able to appropriate an entire oil formation below the High Seas or prevent anybody else from sinking shafts adjoining their own. If, on the other hand, nobody else did in fact sink any shafts, they might in course of time acquire a prescriptive right to such a formation. 12. In conclusion, Mr. Mylles and his colleagues emphasised the fact that the question was far from being a cademic . Their researches pointed to the probability that five or six large oil fields mig ht lie somewhere in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea and in a few years it might be technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of ?/ater than at present. It was quite possible that in about ten years they night wish to start operations in parts of the sea-bed lying as far as twelve miles from the Persian Coast at the northern end of the Persian Gulf (Intld. ) .i.J.B. 7th September, 1938 Eastern Department, Foreim Office.?.Z.699k/i938. (E 5262/201/3U) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 11th Octoloerj 1938. Dear G-iloson, I enclose herein a record of a discussion which I had last month with Mylies, Lees and Browne, of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, arising from their Yfish to have some advice about the 'best way of defining the Company^ concession area in Persia, which, as you know, has to be done before the 31st December, 193S. You will see that we were concerned with three points, namely : (1) v /hether His Majesty^ G-overnment would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit, (2) Hov/ to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and (3) What is the position as regards the High Seas. 2. Since the meeting I have been able to confirm that what I said about the High Seas, as recorded in paragraph 11 of the enclosure, vms correct, and that the generally recognised view of international law with regard to the bed of the open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nullius , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as ^ny unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. 3. During the meeting, however, it escaped my mind 'that questions (1) and (3) above were dealt Y/ith in recent correspondence between the India Office and ourselves about the concession to be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the 'Bahrein Unallotted Area 1 '. In that case, too, the Question arose how to define the maritime boundary of the concession,/ Wbson, Esq..V»1 2&amp;P ^ ' / y ^ s concession, and our point of view was explained in a minute by ^ Beckett enclosed in Brenan's letter to you No. E 2288 /I4T3 /91' of the 25th April, 1938. In this minute Beckett pointed out that as far as the maritime regions of the concession were concerned, the obvious intention was that the Company should have the right to extract oil from the land under t he sea , and that although tne Sheikh of Bahrein had at present no right to land anaer tne sea outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable o± acquisition beyond that limit. For this reason Beckett recommended that it would be better to substitute for tne v/ord Waters' 1 in ft he draft concession the words 'submerged land 1 ', the effect of which would be to give the Company the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as th ey had appropriated it . Now I think this suggestion of Beckett points to the means we are looking for of evading the difficulty about territorial waters which presents itself, or seemed to do so, in the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's concession in Persia. Since my discussions with the Company T s representatives I have looked up the ^Persian law about territorial waters. Copies of this law were sent to you under cover of Foreign Office letter No. T 836VUiW380- of the 3rd August 1934 and a larther copy 5.s enclosed herein for convenience of reference. You will see from Article I that although the Persians claim the right of control to a distance of twelve miles from the coast, they lay specific claln to the bed of the sea only as f ar as six miles. Possibly, however, they would maintain that 'national interests 1 ' entitle them to control of mineral deposits U P to the full twelve mile limit. Idb 5./ ^ A V 0/ d /J 3- 5. ^Te would suggest, therefore, that the Company should place the limits of their concession, wherever they wish to do so, up to a distance of twelve miles from the Persian coast, making it clear that the areas included beyond the coast are areas of sea 'bed. This would prevent the „ ■ „ I, mnr-'-'''- possibility of the Persian Government, at some future date, claiming the right - which, owing to- the diversity of vieY/s about territorial waters, it would be difficult to dispute ~ to grant to another concern portions of the sea bed inside the twelve mile limit in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might be interested. From the Persian point of view the entire area within the limits drawn by the Company would then be Persian territory. From the point of view of His Majesty 1 s Government, however, the area as delimited would consist of Persian territory only up to the three mile limit, and as regards the parts of the sea bed outside that limit which the Company would have included in their concession area, the Company would not really have a right to them - as being under the High Seas - until they had taken steps to appropriate them. As we are presumably not in the least anxious that these areas should be appropriated by anybody else, both the Persians and ourselves would be perfectly happy. 6. You will also be aware that in July 1936 our Legation at Caracas were instructed to initiate discussions with the Venezuelan Government with a view to the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela taking simultaneous and parallel Action to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed of the Gulf of Paria or such parts of it as might be of use for oil boring. 7. As regards question (2) namely the best way of drawing the boundary of the Company 1 s area at the mouth of the Shatt—el—Arab (referred to in paragraph 9 of the enclosed record), it has since occurred to me that the Company should draw/tbl INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 3. . 1 , J.699V3o. 21 st October, 1938.

Knclosure in Note from Director of the Petroleum Department dated 7th November, 1938. 230/26. Dear Baggallay &gt; V ; -&gt;^ I am writing to you^wlth reference to your letter of 11th October (E.3262/211)1/3U) about certain problems regarding the definition of the Anglo-Iranian Gom^any's 100,000 square miles claim in Persia. I have the following observations to malce on the three points raised in your letter;- (1 ) The rhree- aile idmit Question . The issue on this point, as we see it, is whether H.M. Government would be prejudiced, e.g., from the fisheries point of view, if Persian claims to rights outside the three-mile belt were recognised by implication. Th3 is, of course, not really a question for the Petroleum Department. From our point of view the balance of advantage in this matter is probably to secure the recognition of rights to acquire minerals as far out as possible from the coast-line of a country so long as an effective method can be found for doing this. But if, as I think we should, we accept Beckett's idea that the Company's claim should be in relation sea bed rather than to waters, the point in regard to fisheries probably does not really arise. (3) 'The question of the hi^h seas. It seems that there are several zones to be considered here. First, there is the three-mile aone which is unquestionably Persian territorial waters. Then there is the zone 'between three and six miles where Persia claims territorial rights. Outside that is the zone between six and twelve/ foreign Office,'!! W. 1. L. Saggallay,m 2., twelve miles, laio\m to some authorities, I 'believe, as the 'appxmch zone', where Persia claims certain rights bat perhaps not rights in relation to the sea bed* Finally? there are the high seas roper outside the twelve-aile line» In this country minerals appear unquestionably to vest in the Crown inside the three-mile limit. Outside the three-mil limit, i.e., under our high seas, they appear to vest in the Crown if and when they are effectively occ ^pied by a mining Company. This is an illustration of the important point made in Beckett's minute quoted by you (see, for instance. Foreign Office letters A*876/676/1+7 of 16th March, 193^? paragraph 6 and km U03/%7/hl of 2nd March* 1937&gt; paragraph 2, on the Gulf of Paria case referred to in paragraph 6 of your letter under reply) and which as far as we can understand is generally agreed, namely, that outside ter itorial waters, rights to underground land may be acquired by effective acquisition or occupation; although in this ease I believe it is contemplated, that the acquisition or occupation will be established by the two Governments. We feel, therefore, that the advice to the Company should be something like this (i) They should obviously not lay claim to more sea bed than they really think they want, because of the danger of wasting some of their precious 100,000 square miles on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a title; (ii) They should be virtually safe in claiming up to the three-mile line, and robably up to the six-mile line: (iii) Between the six and twelve-mile line, rights could probably be acquired by effective occupation, that is to say, presumably by making artificial constructions/j 3. constructions and erecting derricks. Once the area has 'been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, the Company would be &gt;¥ell advised to take immediate s e g to establish effective occupation as far as is reasonably practicable. I do not see that we can be at all certain that ringing round the area with buoys would be enough- It will be very unsatisfactory if the company includes in its claiia areas from which it is later found impossible to exclude interlopers. (iv)Outside the twelve-mile line the position as to acquisition of rights is the same as in (iii) but it would, I think, hardly be desirable to include such areas within the 100,000 square miles claim, and in any case I gather from the note enclosed with your letter that the Company are not interested in territory outside the twelve-mile line: {v)fe fully agree with Becicett's and your idea that the definition of such a concession should be worded so as to apply to sea bed rather than to waters. Also, words like those proposed by Beckett in the minute which you , ote, defining the concession as areas 'belonging to* the Persians, seem to us right. This case raises the difficult question of artificial islands. On this point our researches have unearthed the interesting case of the Sddystone Lighthouse. The Lighthouse was built on a rock, about ten miles from the Devon coast, not permanently above high water and therefore may, I suppose, be in some respects comparable with the artificial steel and concrete islands which the Anglo- Iranian Company would probably have to build. (Actually, I gather that sometimes undersea oil drilling is done from barges.) Your Department secured an opinion from the Law Officers in 190? to the effect that H.M. aovernment could claim/claim territorial rights within a three-mile radius from the ighthouse. But it was apparently decided that it I would 'be best not to invoke such rights. The admiralty, in the Gulf of Pari a case (see their memorandum of February, 1936, enclosed with letter M.395/36 of 9th April, 1936, to the Colonial Office) are strongly opposed to the view that artificial islands acqaire a territorial helt, thou ;h this view was not shared 'by the Hague Conference of 1330. This may be a red herring and in any case it would probably be best not to raise the issue of artificial islands in this case (2) The Bhatt-el-iirafcu I return your Admiralty chart of the mouth of the river which you sent to Quirk on the 31st October. The line about which you spoke to the Company on 7th September is, I suppose, the same as the red line EG on your chart, assuming that by the general trend of Persian coast' (see chart) you mean the same as H the prolongation of the final section of the left bank of the river^ (paragraph 9 of your note of 7th September). I gather that the line which H.M. Government thinks should be the international boundary (referred to in paragraph 7 of your letter of 11th Oct ber) is the Blue Line. I can quite well see that there are reasons why you would prefer that the boundary of the concession did not coincide with uoy of the suggested international boundaries. In the circumst .aces, it seems to us that BO, or something like it, would be a satisfactory line for the concession boundary, although it nay not -include the largest possible area of sea bed.

[ The questions on which you require our views are - (i) What limit should the Oil Company he asked to adopt at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arah? (ii) Is there any objection to the seaward limit of the concession extending 'beyond the 3 mile limit? (iii) What is the position as regards oil workings on the High Seas? As regards (i), the important point is to secure that (a) the navigational channel from the Shatt is not impeded by oil workings, and (b) that the Persians do not acquire through the grant of a concession de facto claims to waters which we wish to be regarded as Iraq territorial waters. We consider that the best course would be for the Oil Company to avoid approaching sufficiently near to any possible dividing line between Iraq and Iranian waters to prevent the question of the division being brought into controversy. It will make a satisfactory settlement even more difficult to achieve if oil is discovered near or beneath waters still in dispute. On the other hand, we understand that the oil company wishes to secure at least sufficient submarine territory in this area to prevent a second company intruding, and, as it would by no means suit our interests for a rival company less amenable to official advice to become interested in/ Nen office,' ' S.W.I.in this area, we would not object to the Anglo-Iranian Company $ if they consider it necessaryt drawing their 'boundary close to or along the 'blue line' - i.e. the locus of points equidistant from the Iraq, and Iranian coasts, which H.M. G-overrun en t wish to propose as the dividing line between I rag and Iranian waters# It will of course 'be necessary for them to describe the concession limit by geographical co-ordiaates# without reference to any division of territorial waters. As regards (ii) and (iiJ-) we agree generally with the views expressed in your letter of 11th October# It is true that under the terms of the Oil Company^ agreement they are to lay claim to a stated area of Persian territory, and that it might be argued that anything which we allow them to claim, under that definition, without protest, we tacitly recognise as Persian territory# Presumably the Foreign Office will consider whether we should not at a n early stage make it clear to the Persian Government that, while we do not wish to dispute the concession, we do not recognise that it affects in any way the position of H .M* Q-ovemment in regard to the limits of Persian territorial waters, or that rights can be established over the sea bed under the high seas before possession has been made effective. We should have, however, to be careful not to prejudice thereby our claims in respect of the Arab pearl fisheries# It might be as well to make it clear to the Company that they could not expect support from H.M. Government in any claim for areas beyond the three mile limit which they had not effectively possessed, as the mere granting of a concession is not in itself sufficient to establish national or/n o 3. or proprietary rights to the sea bed under the high seas* A further point is that on the principles accepted above there is no real reason why the Company should limit its claims to the distance of 12 miles. The limits of 6 and 12 miles derive authority only from a Persian claim which we cannot recognise; and once the 3 mile limit is passed there is no special virtue in any further limit of 6 or 12 miles. We assume, however, that you mention the limit of 12 miles simply on the presumption that the Persians would not attempt to grant concessions beyond that limit, and there is no need therefore for the Anglo-Iranian to stake any more extensive claim. The concession area which the Company appears from the record of youi'* conversation with My lies, to have in view would be generally satisfactory in that it will not be directly associated with any limit of territorial waters. There would be obvious dangers if# for instance# the limits of the area claimed coincided entirely or largely with either the 6 mile or the 12 mile limit. From a preliminary examination it does not appear that the proposed concession would encroach anywhere (except at the Shatt) on our essential interests, or that it is necessary at this stage to make any specific stipulations in the interests of navigation. The company might be asked, however, to forward a chart showing their proposed claim as soon as they have finally settled it in order that this point can be checked. Also they might be warned that we would expect them, before commencing operati )ns on the hi :h seas or in the neighbourhood of the Shatt, to consult with H.M. Government, and to make all provision which we may consider necessary for the safety of navigation and the protection/n\ 4. protection of any pre-existing rights of ourselves or our Arab clients and for the prevention of oil pollution. These are all matters which will need detailed consideration at a later stage. I ain sending copies of this letter to Gihson and Starling* Yours sincerely, (Sgd») P.H. Jones.By Aat* Mail. P.Z.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering note No. E 7^38/201/3^- dated 30th November» 1938. FOREIGN OFFICE, S,W.1. 29th November, 1938. Dear Mr. Mylies, I am sorry that we have been so long in giving you our considered views on the various questions connected with the definition of your area in Iran, which were MS* raised in your conversation with Baggallay on the 7th September. The delay is due to the fact that we have had to consult other Government Departments, and have had to examine a number of rather complicated points. 2. You asked for our views on the following three questions: (i) whether His Majesty^ Government would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit; (ii) what is the position as regards the high seas, and (iii) how to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. Questions (i) and ( ii) . 3. As regards the maritime portions of the Company's concession, the obvious intention is that the Company should have the right to extract oil, not from the sea water, but from the land under the sea . We think that this is the principle on which the Company should work in defining the maritime portions of their concessions, i.e. they should concentrate on 'sea bed' rather than 'waters', ■n ■Ues, E sij. , taglo-Iranian Oil Company.for in this way it should 'be possible to avoid altogether the difficult question of territorial waters. Ij.« Now, in this country, minerals appear unquestiona'bly to vest in the Grown inside the three mile limit. Outside the three mile limit, i.e. under what His Majesty's Government consider to be the high seas, they appear to vest in the Grown if and when they are effectively occupied by a mining company. It is, moreover, the generally recognised view of international law, with regard to the bed of the open sea and the subsoil beneath it, that the sea-bed and the subsoil is res nullius , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. The position, therefore, as regards the sea-bed off the Iranian coast is that up to the three mile line we recognise the sea-bed as being Iranian. Beyond that line the Iranian Government regard the sea-bed as Iranian up to the six mile line, and may possibly, now or at some future date, claim that 'national interests' give them the right of control to mineral deposits up to the twelve mile line. In the view of His Majesty's Government, however, the subsoil outside the three mile line is res nullius and can be acquired only by effective occupation. 5. Our advice, therefore, to the Company is as follows: (i) The Gompany should obviously not lay claim to more sea-bed than they really think they want, because of the danger of wasting their precious 100,000 square miles on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a title. (ii) The Company should be virtually safe vis-a-vis of Iran in including areas up to the three mile line, and probably up to the six mile line. (Hi)/ ■BflHISMiI 3. (v)/ (iii) Between the six and twelve mile line, rights could pro'balDly 'be acquired 'by effective occupation. The Company, however, could not expect any support from His Majesty's Government in any claim for areas beyond the three mile line which they had not effectively possessed, since, in the view of His Majesty's Government, the mere granting of a concession is not in itself sufficient to establish national or proprietary rights to the sea-bed under the high seas. Therefore, once the area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, the Company would be well advised to take immediate step to establish effective occupation, as far as is reasonably practicable, of those parts which are outside the three mile line. For such occupation of these parts to be effective, it would probably be necessary to erect on them artificial constructions and derricks, and it would not be enough merely to ring them round with buoys. It vould be very unsatisfactory if the Company included in its claim areas from which it were later found impossible to exclude interlopers. At the same time the Company would not, of course, wish to omit areas in which they might be interested and which the Iranian Government might at some future date claim the right to grant to another concern. (iv) That part of the concession which refers to the maritime area should be worded so as to apply to 'sea-bed' rather than to 'waters' and the limits should be expressed as geographical co-ordinates in order to avoid any relationship to territorial waters.■ ' - . ■(v) It is presumed that the Company will ensure that no danger to navigation will he involved 'by the occupation and development of areas of the sea-bed outside the three mile line. We should, however, be glad if the Company would let us have a chart showing their proposed claim as soon as they have finally settled it, in order that this point may be checked. ¥e should, moreover, expect the Company, before beginning operations on what we consider to be high seas, or in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, to consult with us and make all provision which we may consider necessary for the safety of navigation and the protection of any pre-existing rights of His Majesty's G-overnment or the Arab States, and for the prevention of oil pollution. These are matters which will need detailed consideration at a later stage. (vi) Outside the twelve mile line the position as regards the acquisition of rights is as explained above, i.e. similar to that outside the three mile line. It would hardly be desirable for the Company to include areas outside that line within their 100,000 square miles area, and in any case I gather from what was said at the meeting that the Company have no intention of doing so. Question (iii). 6. ¥e should have no objection to the Company drawing their boundary close to - though we should prefer that it did not actually coincide with - the line dividing Iranian from Iraqi territorial waters as His Majesty's Government conceive the line should most fairly be drawn, i.e. the locus/il9 5. locus of points equidistant from the Iraqi and Iranian coasts. A drawing is enclosed giving the line as accepted interdepartmentally here. This is for your confidential information only and should not 'be communicated to the Iranians. Your line here as elsewhere should, of course, be described 'by geographical co-ordinates without reference to any division of territorial waters. (Sd.) 0. W. Baxter.B y Air Mail.

As time pressed and communications to Tehran at this time of year are sometimes apt to be uncertain we had been compelled to despatch, prior to the receipt of your letter, the map defining the boundary of our Iranian Conceosion as from the 1st January 1939, but after a careful examination of your letter we are quite satisfied that no alteration in the wording of the document which accompanied the map is necessary, as although we do use the expression 'territorial waters 11 , on one occasion only, it is qualified by the words 'as defined by Iranian law' and is also fixed by geographical points, the coordinates of which are specified v* i*t7 In clause (iii) para* 5 of your letter you advise that once the maritime area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, we should take immediate steps to establish effective occupation as far as is reasonably practicable of those parts which are outside the 3-mile limit# We are not, of course, in a position to do so until/ Baxter, Esq., M.C., Foreign Office, London, S.W .I.s. until the new boundaries have been mutually established, and from the physical point of view, I fear that the difficulties and expense of taking effective occupation would be gpeat until such time as we decide to coKitience operations* We are however greatly obliged to you for drawing attention to the risk we run if ?;e do not do so, and shall keep the point prominently in mind. We can assure you that if and when operations comnence in the maritime area, there will be no danger to navigation as the water is shallow and of no interest to deep sea vessels; further, for the safety of our own operations alone, we should be compelled to take adequate measures against oil pollution. We have carefully noted your comments with regard to commencement of operations in what is considered to be hi^ti seas, for reference when the time s comes, /i Referring to your para.6, the boundary as ?;e have drawn it at the mouth of the shatt al Arab crosses at the two angles the boundary shown on the drawing you sent us, but elsewhere it is quite clear and within the territory you consider to be Iranian waters; this line is defined geographically and without reference to territorial waters, I find that through an oversight we have not .C. ^ advised you as asked by Mr* Baggallay in his Tetter of the ?th October that we have included the Island of Sirri in our area.

As regards (b), this cannot but be a matter of some importance. Although it has been decided here that the best division between IraQi and Persian waters at the mouth of the Shatt would be a line eQuidistant from both coasts, the Iranians, so far as we know, have never been acquainted with our views and obviously this is a case where sleeping dogs would best be left to lie* On the other hand, if the Persian Government grant a concession relating to the bed B.L.Baggallay, Esq,, of/ foreign Office, S.W.I.of the sea on the Iraqi side of this line, it is difficult to see how we can possibly ignore it unless we take refuse in the fiction (v/hich would clearly 'be exploded if the i sue were ever put to legal test) that we have no knowledge of the exact terms of the concession* While it is true that internationally the bed of the sea may be appropriated by a State outside its own territorial waters^ it seems equally clear that this appropriation may not extend to land under territorial waters of another State* To acqufesce, therefore, in a concession covering land or waters outside the proposed boundary shown to the Company would make it very difficulty if not impossible, to uphold that line. If the encroachment of the area for which the Company have asked beyond this line is very slight, and in no way endangers Iraqi control of the Rookah Channel, acquiescence in the grant of the concession accordingly might not have any serious practical effect; though it would in any event mean that the concession line would in future be the furthest to v /hich we could hope to extend Iraqi territorial waters and would probably represent a purely arbitrary division unrelated to any conceivable principle for the settlement of such matters# None of these important issues can, however, be settled without an exact knowledge of the course of the limits of the proposed concession area in this neighbourhood. We ?/ould, therefore, be glad if you could obtain a full definition of the marine boundary of the proposed concession area (a record of which is assumed to be available at their London office) without delay so that these doubtful points may be investigated. There can be very little time remaining for intervisntion in this matter, since, as we now gather from the Company 1 s earlier letter of the 29th December, the definition/3. definition maps 'are et the moment at Tehran for signature'. It will clearly 'be much more difficult to secure any rectification of the limits once the maps are signed hy the Iranian authorities, and we feel strongly, therefore, that the Company should he pressed to delay negotiations, unless the maps are already signed, while the doubtful points can he cleared up. It might he pointed out to the Company that if the concession does involve Iranian claims to Jurisdiction over waters which we could not recogmse, we shall prohahly find ourselves obliged to enter reservations with the Iranian Government. The undesirahility of our having to do so, as it were, against a British Company, will no doubt he obvious. I am sending copies of this letter to Gibson and Starling.

We are very anxious to have these two documents as soon as possible. We want (b) so as to be guite sure whether or not we wish to take exception to the mention of ^territorial waters' 1 , and we want to have (a) so as to be quite sure whether or not we should attach importance to the way in which your boundary crosses ours at the mouth of the ahatt-el-Arab. The map which you kindly ' p t| sent with your letter of the 29th Oeoemtoer, 1938, 1b on too sioall a scale to enable us to decide the second point. You will of course realise that, If your concession does involve Iranian claims to jurisdiction over waters which we could not recognise, we should probably find ourselves obliged to enter reservations with the Iranian Oovemraent. In order to avoid this it is most important that we should study your boundary in this area before the maps signed. The departments concerned even go so far as to urge that, unless the maps are already signed, negotiations at Tehran should be delayed until these doubtful points have been cleared up. 'Hjrlles, Rao.

[E 4458/38/34] Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—{Received June 22.) (No. 195. Very Confidential.) My Lord, Tehran, June 10, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 71 of the 4th June, I have the honour to send to your Lordship herewith further particulars about Lord Cadman's recent visit to Tehran. Lord Gadman arrived by air on Saturday, 27th May, and left also by air on MonSayTsTfi June. During his visit he had two conversa tions with the Shah each lasting about two hours, at which the Crown Prince, as weir as M. Bader. the Minister of Finance, were present. The Crown Prjnce helped substantially to allay a misgiving of Lord Cadman's that the Shah wouTff hear what the interpreter rather than he himself wished to tell him, fQf the Crown Prince began at an early stage to interrupt and amend M. Bader's translations and before the close had pretty well taken over the work of inter preter. Lord Cadman felt no reason to regret this substitution. 2. As I informed 'your Lordship in my telegram under reference, Lord Cadman was a good deal more than hopeful that an agreement had been reached on certain points that have been under protracted and inconclusive discussion between the company's representatives here and the Iranian authorities, and further that the suspicions of an unwarranted policy of restricting output which had found violent expression in the inspired press had been demonstrated to be unfounded. 3. New Concession A rea. —At the beginning of tlhe discussion it was clear that the Shah had been turning over in his mind the possibility that it would pay him better to reduce the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's area and to grant part of it to an independent concern. Lord Cadman showed that such a step could not have the effect of increasing the market for Iranian oil, and the idea of a complete repudiation of the concession, which would be entailed by such a division of the area, was not pursued. Finally, agreement was reached on the new area to be allotted to the company for development under the terms of the concession as revised in 1933, by Lord Cadman agreeing to exclude all the Mekran coast, a section that the company had asked to have included in the 100,000 square miles to which they are entitled. Lord Cadman recognised that the company's desire to include the whole southern and south-eastern coast of Iran had naturally created some suspicion; nor did he consider it essential that the whole coastal area should be included. In return for the section omitted M. Bader had offered some other inland areas. 4. Fort dues at Bandar Mashur. —Before committing itself whole-heartedly to the development of Bandar Mashur—few miles north of Bandar Shahpur in the Khor Musa—as the port to handle the output of the new field at Gach Saran, the company has attached great importance to securing some assurance which would guarantee it against being mulcted by the imposition of port dues in excess of what was reasonably required for the Iranian port services. Lord Cadman fully believes that he has been able to secure a satisfactory settlement of this question. 5. Output and Markets.—Lovdi Cadman went into this matter very fully with His Imperial Majesty. He showed him a chart indicating the rise of world output since 1933 and the company's own output, which registered a steeper percentage rise; he explained that the company were debarred from markets in large parts of the world, including America and Eussia, and he referred to stocks having been filled up by many countries in 1937, which had the double effect of making that a bumper year for output and the following year a leaner one, quite apart from the restricting influence on trade of uncertainty in the international situation. June 22, 1939. Section 2. (9 | % Copy No. [630 y—2]2 6. Lord Cadman took advantage of this opportunity to refer to the Iraq Petroleum Company; to the extent to which it still does not compete with the i^glo-Iranian Oil Company; to his own position as chairman; and above all to ^Bsums that that company is feeling able to advance to the Iraqi Government ^nihe Shah seemed entirely to appreciate Lord Cadman's explanations' on these Q points, and I venture to record my own satisfaction that he has forestalled the ' last point reaching the Shah's ears in some garbled form. 7. I did not refer in my telegram No. 71 to the other matter which Lord Cadman discussed with tihe Shah, namely, that of providing financial resources for carrying out His Imperial Majesty's present programme of developing his country Eailway, industrial and military plans are all making large demands, and it may be supposed that it was the fall in the royalties from the company in its bearing on these demands that provoked the obstruction and ill-will that the company has been encountering. Lord Cadman put it to His Imperial Majesty that to take more money from the company (or to pillory the company in the press) would seriously prejudice its position and consequently its ability to help him in his development plans, notably as regards Bandar Mashur for which the company must find some 15 million in the course of the next few years. Lord Cadman referred to the possibility, which I understand he had previously discussed with the Export Credits Guarantees Department, of facilitating Iranian imports by means of credits in London, and the Shah seemed to accept the suggestion that the possibilities in this direction might be further explored, perhaps by sending a special representative to London. 8. During his valuable visit of rather more than a week Lord Cadman took a keen and most enterprising interest in various manifestations in and around Tehran of the new industrialised Persia. I feel that my debt to him is by no means confined to the fullness with which he kept me posted as to his business conversations. Inter alia I think it is satisfactory that he should have established direct contact witih the Crown Prince, and that on matters of serious concern to the future welfare of the country.

It seems to me inappropriate that the Resident in the Persian Gulf shd have to get information on a matter of first rate importance like this from a Home newspaper. Only the most fragmentary references appeared in the British News Wireless. On the Arah side (I speak only for Bahrain, 'but presumably we did the same at Kuwait) we issued news in the early stages as it became available with good effect - as instance the immediate cessation of the attempt to corner oil on action being taken by the Agency to issue authentic news and the Bahrain Govt, to establish oil selling centres for the poor. The A.P.0*0 thanked us for the action taken. News of the settlement,even if only a brief statement of iihe main points would have been welcome. The draft telegram is clearly unsuitable now, but it might be well to explain the position to the Minister demi-offifiially and enlist his co-operation - he probalfry , in spite of his ^-4' visit to the Gulf, has no appreciation of tk&lt;S' interest taken nowadays in oil matters - and for that matter other Persian affairs. 16.5.35 -A &gt; fa 2 */* fU |U ; ^ tel.
