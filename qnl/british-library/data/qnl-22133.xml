The two firms who offered to supply the material for the town water supply scheme, Holloways and Dormon Long, have been asked to submit up-to-date prices for pumps, engines, tanks etc. The last tenders were in 1941. They have also been asked whether they would be prepared to undertake the actual construction work in Bahrain, which I consider is essential as we possess no suitable plant. I have informed Messrs. Holloways that I will contact them in London. V/e cannot yet determine the quantity of piping which will be required as the very large scale map of Manama has only just been completed and without this the detailed lay out cannot be plotted. It is proposed however that the pump, tanks etc., should be ordered now and the piping as soon as quantity is known. Adviser to the Government.i+Iji No. /*&amp;/ — of 1364 Qfficubf tho Adviser to H.

The Chief Local Representative Dear Sir, The Bahrain Government has contracted with Messrs. Holloway Brothers for the installation of a town water supply in Manama. The system of distribution will be through a ring-main round Manama feeding a sub-main with extensions to consumers and public wasAhouses and supply hydrants for the public. The pumping plant, consisting of three sets o' maps and storage tanks will be loc ted in the M cipal Garden. It is proposed that water should be supplied from two new artesian wells in the garden as shown on the attached plan. We have not the necessary equipment and material for drilling and casing two wells, the contractors only undertake the provision and erection of pumps, machinery, water tower and lay out of mains and sub-mains; not the drilling of the wells. Would your company be prepared to sink two wells and provide casing, isolating valves etc., for the Government of Bahrain in the Municipal Garden? Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated in furthering a public utility scheme for the benefit of the inhabitants of Manama. If you can assist would you kindly let me know when you could commence operations? The site Is clear and has been seen by Group Captain Leigh and Mr. Godfrey.

WATER SCHEME File No, 765.1 In reply to your letter No.2300 of 1365 dated October 30, 1946, I wish to inform you that The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. will release the necessary equipment and will undertake the drilling of two water wells in the Municipal Garden, Manama, required in connection with the Bahrein Government slater Scheme. Charges in this connection will be invoiced to the Bahrein Government on the basis of Material and direct and indirect Labour costs only, exclusive of Overheads. Unfortunately, it is impossible to schedule this work at the present time with any degree of accuracy due to the fact that plans have already been made covering several months ahead. If there is any interruption of these plans this work will be fitted in and in any case it is anticipated that it can be completed within the next four months. Yours very truly Origin a* biguea bj M.

The Bahrain Government has placed orders in the United Kingdom for the supply and installation of a town water scheme for the supply of water through mains and auxiliary feeders to all residential areas in the town* The scheme includes water supply points distributed throughout the town where water can be drawn free of charge by the public, also wash places and Dhobi Ghats. Occupants of houses who desire a private water supply inside their premises will be required to pay for the water which they consume. The water consumption will be recorded by a meter installed on the premises of each consumer. The tariff per gallon will be announced at a later date. Water pressure available will be sufficient to provide a water supply to a height of at leart 50 feet. The Government of Bahrain will only instal the water connection up to the consumer^ meter, all interval services from the meter, must be carried out by the owner of the premises, but before water service is connected the interior installation must be approved by the State Engineer. In order to decide approximcT^tely how many meters will be required householders are requested to inform the State Engineer in writing the number of service points which they will need, i.e. the number of supply taps on the premises. The anticipated date for the completion of thewater supply scheme is March, 1948, but as sections of the mains are laid, water from them will be available for the residents in those areas. Sd.

Memo rand urn:- I enclose a copy of a letter from Messrs. Holloway Brothers regarding the Manama Water Scheme and would be grateful if you could inform the proper authorities at home that this firm has been entrusted with the work of carrying out this scheme. The contract is for the erection of water storage tanks with a pump house and pumps and over 15 miles of asbestos cement piping to provide a main water supply throughout the town of Manama at the cost of £64,000. The firm will construct a house to accommodate their British staff while working here as it is probable that their engineers will remain in Bahrain for at least 18 months. Any assistance that can be given which may expedite the dispatch of material from the United Kingdom will be appreciated. Adviser to the Government. cc Messrs.

Holloway Brothers (London) Ltd., Bridge Wharf, Millbanh, Westminster, SW1, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Manama Water Scheme. As you probably know, the supply of the principal constructional material in this country is at the present time controlled by the Ministry of Supply, and we have to obtain permission from them before placing our orders for the majority of the items we require for the above scheme. In addition, we have to obtain Sxport Licences from the Board of Trade before we can despatch to Bahrain. To enable our applic ations to be favourably considered, it is necessary for us to have in this country a Government Department, who have knowledge of the Contract, and who are prepared to answer any enquiries which might be addressed to them by the Ministry of Supply and/or the Board of Trade, and in effect, to act as a sponsor for the Contract. Unless this procedure is carried out, we find it very difficult to obtain quick releases and shipment of materials, and our object in writing you is to ask if you will kindly advise - presumably the India Office - of the existence and extent of this Contract, with a view to obtaining some assis tance from them on the lines referred to above. We should also appreciate a copy of any communication you send in connection with this matter. S.ZSTRESS LETTER / /• Frora political Agent, Bahrein. To Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Pahrain.
