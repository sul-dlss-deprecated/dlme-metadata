Dear Jope Slade, I have just taken over from Pyhus and am taking the opportunity of a 'safe hand' to send hy him a letter which is too late for inclusion in the outgoing Foreign Office hag. My French colleague told Pyhus he was much worried hy recent Italian activity in the Gulf. He has just received a letter from his Ministry of War asking him what he knows about this and especially in connection with a prolonged tour made recently in that region hy the Italian Naval Attache (Commandant Bigi) in Tehran in the course of his return journey from leave. This officer has spent nearly a month in visiting hoth sides of the Gulf. The Italian secretary (penacchio) was also in those ^ £ knSji parts. An Italian cruiser was in the Gulf. Our 1 consul at Ahwaz reports in a diary the presence in nis area of several Italian ex-employees of the contractors of the Trans-Iranian Railway who, now that construction is finished, are out of a joh and looking for work in Bandar Shahpur and elsewhere. What does it all mean? I work in closely with my French colleague and would welcome for my sake as well as his any news you Can give me. In case the Navy have spotted anything would you he so good as to send a copy of this letter to the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf, and also to the Resident at Bushire.

It seems clear that we have no legal grounds ff or protesting to the Italians, who are no doubt fully aware of the treaty position, about their action in Ui approaching the Sultan of Muscat direct. The proposed , reply by the Sultan*s representative seems, however, to 5T O o meet the case (at any rate as a first step) and we agree that Powle should be instructed to convey to him His Majesty’s Government's approval. 3. Meanwhile you will have seen from Bagdad telegram No. 18 of the 6th February, a copy of which has been sent to you under cover of our official letter E 752/657/91 of the 9th February, that the Italian Legation at Bagdad have asked His Majesty's Embassy for the name of the present Regent in Muscat, with a view to communicating with him /direct J. P. Gibson, Esq.direct in the same matter. I presume that since sending the message quoted in Bushire telegram No. 70 of the 2nd February the Italian Minister has come to learn that the Sultan is absent and v/ishes to repeat his message to the proper person. There seems no point in withholding information of this kind and we propose, if you agree, that Morgan should confine himself in his reply to simply stating who the Regent is - or are. I expect that you already have this information on your files, but if not, perhaps Fowle could be asked to supply it direct to Bagdad. If you could telephone to me when you have considered this letter, we could decide precisely what telegrams are required. 4.

There is in fact no coal at Muscat (the coal depot has recently been closed down and handed over to the R.A.F. and oil is now used as a fuel by the Gulf sloops), though the Admiralty think there may be some at Henjam. 2. This is, I think, the first occasion on which an Italian warship has visited Muscat and it will be interesting to see what itinerary she contemplates within the Gulf. It will be observed that the Italian Government 2730 1000 4.34 appear to have communicated direct with the Sultan (though it is not clear through what channel/channel) as regards the visit and have referred us to the information which we gave them in 1932 - that H.M.G. did not conduct the foreign relations of the sultan of Muscat. It would he rather a nuisance if an Italian interest in this State developed, particularly as we are precluded hy the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 from securing control of the foreign relations of the sultan.

The chief interest of the present incident is as showing the anxiety of the French to maintain their position vis-a-vis the Muscat State. The procedure suggested hy the Political Resident was reasonable in the circumstances but it was perhaps hardly to be expected that the Q,uai d’Orsay would fall in with it. With the development of the air route if, as is now more or less generally accepted, it will ultimately be necessary for us to secure facilities at Shargah for French and Dutch aeroplanes, we are unfortunately likely to see some recrudescence of active interest on the part/part of the French ( and possibly also on the part of the Italians f in the rres jcpsiett of the Arab principalities of the Gulf.

Sir, ^ith reference to my despatch No.66 of Fehruary 17th last reporting the visit to Jedda of His Majesty’s Sloop 'Lupin*, I have the honour to state that the French naval yacht 'Diana' arrived here on Fehruary 18th having on hoard Rear Admiral Deville, who has recently assumed command of the French naval forces in the Levant. The Diana left for Suez on Fehruary 20th. 2. Admiral Deville is comoleting an extensive tour in the course of which he travelled overland from Syria to Basra where he was met hy the Diana. Although it is not the custom of this post that visiting naval commanders should call upon the representatives of Governments other than their own, the Admiral was good enough to pay me a private visit on 19th February in token of appreciation of the numerous courtesies he had received from British authorities. He spoke with great appreciation of his intercourse with His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Baghdad, the Political Resident at Bushire and the British Political Agents in the Persian Gulf. 3. As the question of naval salutes for Hejaz personages is still engaging your attention, I may mention that, when the Acting Governor of Jedda called on Admiral Deville on board the Diana on Fehruary 20th, he was accorded a salute of 13 guns hen the same official visited the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops during the recent visit of His Majesty’s sloop 'Lupin' His Majesty’s Principal secretary of state for Foreign affairs.'Lupin”, Captain Licken decided in consultation with me that it would 'be Letter not to accord a salute* I fully concurred in this decision having regard to the unsettled state of the general question and the fact that the Acting Governor is quite a subordinate official and has none of the claims of the titular of the post* I feel that it would be a very good thing, if some informal agreement could be reached with the French and Italian autnorities on the whole subject* 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Baghdad and to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Permission was granted through His Majesty*s Embassy in Paris for a visit to Port Sudan on the 18th October last and through you for a further visit on the 13th November. Permission was also accorded through the French Consul-General in Calcutta for visits to Karachi from 30th November to 5th December and from 15th to 31st January and to Muscat from the 10th to 12th January. Furthermore permission was sought through the French Consul in Baghdad for permission for visits to Basra, Koweit and Bahrein on the 21st November, the 27th November and the 5th December respectively.

Department. I cc Please see Foreign Office letter of £2nct Z]. October below, and the Departmental note of 23rd October at flag G. 2. The essential difference between the visit to Muscat and the visit to Henjam for the purpose of the present correspondence is that the French have no longer any diplomatic representative in Muscat, while they are of course in diplomatic relations with Persia, and so can approach the Persian Government direct. It is not, however, quite clear that the Political Resident has in fact consulted the Muscat authorities as to whether they would see any objection to a visit to their State, and his report^ that there is 'no objection' to the 'Diana’s' visit may refer merely to the objections from our point of view. In the circumstances, it might perhaps be best to confine the Note to be addressed to the French Ambassador to the question of Henjam only, and to re word it as suggested in the draft.

After informal discussion with Foreign Office and Admiralty, it was agreed that the simplest course would-be that the Admiralty should advise the French Naval Attache to take the necessary steps. i\ fxA In-LjAAj Vu.ii.

From, l ajor-Oeneral J.E.K. Stewart, Political Resident, Men. C.B., ii.S.' •, To, His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that, having learnt that the French warships 'I'ondement' and '’Alerte** had visited Kerbat on the South Arabian Coast between the 18th and 26th November 1925, 1 asked the olitical Agent, luscat, whether he could tell me the object of the visit. He has replied aus follows:- 'About the middle of October 1925 a rumour reached Muscat that His Highness the Sultan was having some trouble with Shaikh Ali bin Mahamad bin Salim of Llerbat and had imprisoned or threatened to imprison him for not handing over an alleged thief. This rumour was not confirmed by His Highness 1 letters which were received at that time and no particular importance was attached to the rumour. It is however known here that some years ago a French ship was in difficulties in the neighbourhood of Merbat and the present Shaikh’s father, l ahamad bin Salim, rendered assistance to the ship. Since that time the French warships have been in the habit when in that neighbourhood of callir^ at Merbat and presenting a sum of money to the Shaikh.• Although the fact of the recent alleged visit has not been verified here, it is thou^it that if such a visit has been paid its object may well have been to offer the customary present, or possibly because of His Hi^iness’ trouble with the Shaikh, The amount of money given is said to vary from £.80 to £.20 a year 1 *. 2. Merbat is outside the Aden political sphere, but it is adjacent to Kishn, which is inside it. In view of this, and of the fact that the French war vessels paid their visit to J/erbat from Aden, I consider it advisable to report the matter to you. In my opinion periodical visits of French warships to a place like Merbat must probably have some political object, but at present X have no grounds, other than conjecture, for this supposition. 1 hope to receive further informa- tion from the iolitical .igent, Muscat, on this subject. 1 have, kc., (Signed) J.H.K.Stewart. Major-General, Political Resident, /den.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001fa_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2963</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001fa</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2963</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 20/11 'Muscat: Channel of communication between foreign governments and the Sultan; Visits of foreign naval vessels to Muscat'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1926/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-10T22:47:03</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (121 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at last folio with 123; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
