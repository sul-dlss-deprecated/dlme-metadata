My dear George, s\ Many thanks for your letter of the 19th December, o.i? . 7741/5 68/25 , about Bahrein transit dues. 2. We read with much interest the account of your discussion with Hafiz Wahba. It seems clear that the deterrent effect of the Ahraedi incident has been quite as great as the local authorities reported at the time, and that what the Saudi Government are anxious to do is to obtain some sort of reassurance as to the future, which will make it possiole for them to interest British shipping firms in direct shipments to Ras Tanura. 3. It has, I think, been fairly generally accepted that the action of the Bahrein authorities in the Ahmedi incident was possibly open to criticism and the ground on which they stood not very strong; and, as you say, we have been anxious so far as possible to merge discussion of this particular incident in a general discussion of the question of transit dues. We, like you, are not anxious to ventilate the incident if we can avoid doing so. On the other hand, we regard it as most important to do everything possible to safeguard the interests of Bahrein in this matter and we do not feel that the Saudi Government (who have for the last 13 years derived substantial advantages to which they have no real claim at the expense of Bahrein as the result of the arrangement approved by His Majesty's Government in 1920) W.Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, S.W.I./ 2. can«*t expect much sympathy from us if they now try to press Bahrein at a time when, as we both know, the condition of Bahreini finances is very unsatisfactory. Apart frcm this, in the first place, the record of the Koweit blockade to which you refer in your letter is not such as to encourage us to give way lightly to Saudi representations on matters such as the present; while, in any case, all our experience of Ibn Saud is that any sign of weakness on our side encourages him to press for more. 4. We should in' these circumstances be disposed, I think, to suggest that the line to be taken with Hafiz Vfehba should be firstly that we see no profit in a discussion of the Ahmedi incident and that in the interests not only of friendly relations between Ibn Saud and Bahrein, but of placing this vexed and intricate question of transit dues on a footing satisfactory to both parties, we have consistently urged the summoning of a preliminary conference at Bahrein, the results of which could be confirmed through the diplanatic channel and that we have made it clear that we are prepared to give all possible assistance in connection with such a conference, at which the British Political Agent in Balirein would be present. Secondly, if he presses Ibn Saudis question as t o the precise importance of the incident itself, the answer might be that the Saudi Government should not take this incident as indicative of any settled policy; that no policy has in fact been settled pending the result of the discussions which we have offered to arrange; but that it would be unwise to overlook the risk that, as the Ahmedi incident illustrates, serious difficulties may arise from their point of view unless a friendly arrangement is entered into/&lt;59 / 3. into with Bahrein. Finally, it might perhaps be made clear to the Saudi Government that so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned the interests of Bahrein must come first and that so far as we are concerned they need expect no support from us in endeavouring to induce British shipowners to ship direct to Ras Tanura unless and until negotiations with Bahrein on the subject of the transit dues have been undertaken and have failed. 5. A slightly aggressive policy of this nature would, we think, be much the most likely to bring the Saudis to reason. I do not propose in this letter to enter in detail into the arguments on the merits or otherwise of the Ahmedi incident contained in your letter. But I might perhaps say that we cannot, as at present advised, accept the Foreign Office attitude in the matter. In the first place, we cannot agree that the action of the Bahrein State in any event constitutes a blockade of Saudi Arabia. It is merely an endeavour by Bahrein to defend its own interests, and to secure seme reconpense for its outlay in equipping and bringing up to date the harbour a.t Bahrein, and shippers are perfectly Iree to ship direct to Ras Tanura if they wish to do so and if they do not mind facing any possible consequences with Bahrein; or to use any other channel for imports into Saudi Arabia. Secondly, we do not think it desirable to link this question up with that of the Koweit blockade, save to the extent that we can at a pinch use the history of the blockade to bring home to the Saudi Government the fact that their own record is not immaculate. Bahrein and Koweit must be dealt with separately on their merits. It is a matter of no concern to Koweit whether the Sheikh of/of Bahrein secures transit dues fron Ibn Saud or not, and equally, I think, the Sheikh of Bahrein would probably care little about the raising of the Koweit blockade so lonf, as his own difficulties with Saudi Arabia remained unsettled. The real basis of the Bahrein! action is necessity. We agree with you that we do not want to adopt too positive an attitude about it so long as there is any hope of an agreed settlement. But we feel also (and I am sure you will agree) that the-Bahrein Government have so far adopted a completely reasonable attitude, and that in so far as obstacles nave been placed in the way of a reasonable settlement they have not cone from the Bahreini side. It may well oe that in a situation such as might result fran a failure to reach agreement they would ccme off worst: they are probably fully alive to such risks as there may be, and they may ( and possibly would] be willing toj ccmpramise with Saudi Arabia on the points in issue. But it would, I think, be both unfair to Bahrein and a tactical error to suggest to the Saudi Government that we are likely to adopt an accommodating attitude in the matter or to go any way to meet them at this stage. It would equally be a great mistake to attach over much importance to this petty local dispute, or we think, oO deal with it in all respects on the lines which might oe applicable if it was a dispute between two great Powers. 6, I am sending a copy of this letter tc Marker. I shall, of course, be very glad to discuss the line suggested in it with you at any time. Yours erer, GILBERT IAITCTAITEPoZ.91/34. M.7731/33. MERCAliTILE MARINE DEPARTMENT, 30AKD OF TRADE, GREAT GEOHGE STREET, WBSTMIN STER, S .^Y.l* 1st January, 1934, Dear Rendel, Tour letter of the 19tli Decfember (E# 7741/368/25) regarding the Bahrein transit dues. I find it rather difficult to offer any useful observations as apparently things oan be, and are done, in these parts of the vrorld whioh would create a storm if done elsewhere. You are aT/are of the views of the Board of Trade on the question of these dues and I really cannot add anything to them. As you know, the British lines would not view with favour an increase in the port dues. On the other hand, Bahrein is entitled to levy reasonable transit dues on vessels mailing use of Bahrein waters in their trade with the mainland. To try and enforce the payment of dues on vessels making no use whatever of Bahrein waters, and objecting to pay the dues seems to us high-handed to put it no higher than that. I am sending Laithwaite a copy of this letter. Yours etc., (Sd.) E.H. MARmt.

A copy is enclosed oi a letter No:1032/S.F dated the 11th February 1934 (26th Shawwai 13b2) from the AQviser to the Bahrain G-overnment to Muhammad A^il Ilhunji giving him permission to re-export the fifteen hundred snort weight bags in question. 3. I should explain that in mentioning as the proper channel 'the Saoudi ^rabia G -overnment through n«ii/i.B T s Political Agent in Bahrain' the Adviser meant that any application should reach the Bahrain Government through the Political Agent, and did not mean that the Sa'udi Arab G -overnment should necessarily address the Political iigent. 4. as both the adviser and His Excellency Shaiida Earaad bin T isa a1 Khalifah have since received letters from Muhammad Tawil stating that the consignment is for the use of the Sa T udi Arab G-overnment,I should prefer to withdraw the suggestion contained in the fifth paragraph of my telegram No: 74 dated /the 2fC.)2. tne 6th February 1934 that an enquiry should be made througa Jedda whether the consignment was actually for tne Sa'uai Arab Government,as I thmit that to do so now might merely leao. to dil'liculties and that,if in any future case application is not made in due form and in plenty of time,the Bahrain Government will be on firm ground should they wish to refuse permission. b. On the 10th February 1934 His Excellency Shaiich Kamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah,in the course of a conversation on other matters,showed me the letter from Muhammad Tawil and said that in the circumstances he would liKe to let tne snort weight consignment go through on payment of the ordinary transit dues, to wmcn I raised no objection. I, however,called His Excellency's attention to tne endeavour oi Muhammad A^il Khunji to act as an agent for the Sa T udi Arab Government, tas Excellency said that he was only acting as a commercial agent, but I said tnat I had heard that he was giving himself out as being an 'Agent' and that there was danger ot such a person trying to develop himself into a Consul* His i ^xceilency assured me that there was no question of anything of that kind taking place and I know that he himself would object to any such development. I will,however,watch the matter carefully as it is undesirable, apart from any question of consular status,that another family of the type of the tusaibis snould be allowed to grow up in Bahrain under the aegis of His Majesty King Bm Sa T ud.

It emerges from your telegrams to the Government of India No.47 of January 18 and No.67 of January 25,1933, that the Ahmedi incident was held to have involved a violation, not of the Jiluwi Agreement, but of an agreement with Marzuk.

I need not enter in detail into the points taJ.en in your letter of 31st January, in view of the developments // reported in your letter of 28th February, ana I write only i v. V to say that we agree entirely with the line adopted by you in your conversation, reported in that letter, with Hal iz »Vahba, which seems to us to offer very much the best prospect of a satisfactory outccme to this question. Our general view remains as stated in my letter to you of 3rd January, Sflf/ 3&gt;3? P.Z.S178/33, and if we can get the Saudis and Bahreinis to get together there ought to be some hope of a reasonable settlement. 3. As regards the points taicen in paragraph 4 of your letter, we, as you know, take rather a different view from that held by the Foreign Office. But I do not think there is any question of the Bahrein authorities 'persisting', to use your own words, TT in the attitude which they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports', if by that you mean creating further incidents of the same type. Our evidence is to the effect that, whatever the merits of the 'Ahmedi' incident, its results have been very satisfactory from the point of view of B^Jirein, and, while we should/ G.W.Rendel,Esq.,C.M.G., Foreign Office, S.W.I.should not, of course, wish to say this to Hafiz Wahba, it seems unlikely, while things remain as: they are, that any necessity mil in fact arise for dealing with a further case the same nature, 4, I am sending copies of this letter to Marker at the Board of Trade.

As for the merits of that affair in itself, I am content to leave the question to brains other than mine, now that the venue has been changed to London. We have heard nothing here from the Saudis, either about the Ahmedi or the general questior of transit dues, since last October when they bounced Calvert off with the interim reply of October 9 to our last note and promptly proceeded to deal witjf the question through their Minister in London.

Subject. /» Japanese Trade Activities in the Persian Gulf.Visit of a Japanese ship fco Bahrain. 'v M 1. Karko Bunya of the firm of Haridas Janimal and Company *of Bahrain has informed me that Messrs Rawji Jahawerchand and n ,11.— miii !■■■■ 11 i rt ' — i linn „ „ m. Company, the Agents of his firm in Karachi, in I larch contracted with the Japanese Cotton Trading Company for the import into Bahrain of 1000 tons of Rangoon rice, which had previously been shipped to Japan, by a Japanese steamer. Under the terms of this contract the monopoly for shipments of Japanese rice to the port of Bahrain during the months of April, May and June was given to the firm of Haridas Janimal and Company. The Japanese steamer (S.S.N'ankana Maru) is due to reach Bahrain in the middle of this month (May). 2. Recently the firm of Muhammad Marzuq, whose Agent in Bahrain is 1 Abdul 'Aziz 'Ali Bassam, entered into negociations with the Japanese Cotton Trading Company for the shipment of 1000 tons of rice direct to Qatif on the mainland. Messrs Rawji Jahawerchand objected on the ground that all trade for Qatif went through Bahrain and that they had the monopoly for Bahrain, without accepting this contention, the Japanese Cotton Trading Company agreed to let them take over this second shipment of 1000 tons. 'This shipment will come by a second Japanese steamer. 3. Messrs Rawji Jahawerchand have already paid Rs.10,000/- for this rice and have agreed to pay the balance due within a week of receiving the shipping documents in Karachi. 4. It is learned that these Japanese ships are capable of carrying 6000 tons of rice or more and that they have shipments for other ports (no definite information available) in the Gulf. It is unlikely that Muhammad Marzuq will consider himself bound (even if the agreement could be held to cover later shipments) by the agreement reached with Captain Prior in October 1932 that he would not ship direct to mainland ports, and it.- 2 - and it, therefore, seems possible that some of the cargo of these two steamers may be taken direct to Qatif in the steamers. 5. Karko Bunya requested that the ordinary port dues should be charged on rice landed in Bahrain and transit dues at 2% on that transhipped (overside delivery) for Qatif. He stated that if he had only to pay 2% transhipment charges he would be able to conpete at Qatif with Mihammad Marzuq — should the latter import rice direct there. 6. No application has as yet been received for permission to act as Agents for these Japanese steamers at Bahrain, though it is possible that F.C. Strick Limited have taken up the agency for the Persian Gulf, as in the case of the 'Yoshida Maru'.|q -y/ Confidential. I).0.No.576-S of 1934. The Residency, Bushire, the 26th June 1934. (' \o Please refer to correspoiadence ending with Residency Printed Letter I^o»c/162j dated the 1st April 1934, on the subject of Bahrain transit dues. i I enclose a copy of a no ue datedthe 2nd June 1934 from Loch regarding the possibility of direct shipments to the inainland(Qatlf) by Japanese vessels. 2. The threat of more or less regular direct ship- ments by Japanese vessels is a more serious one than that arising from isolated cases like the 'Ahmedi'', ana the Bahrain Government will naturally wish to do all in their power to prevent its being put into effect. 3, Though the action of the Bahrain Government in the 'Ahmedi' case was generally held, I think, to be within their sovereign powers, the fact that a demand was .iiade for payment of transit dues on goods not landed at Bahrain was the cause of some doubt in certain quarters. 4. In the present instance it seems to me that ^if the Bahrain Government were to notify in good time that they would not permit vessels which carried direct cargo xor the inainland to call on thci same trip at Bcu-i'diu^ would discourage the mainland traffic without in any way over stepping their powers. There would be no demand for payment of transit dues on cargo carried for the mainland, and/ J.G.Laithwaite Jbsquire, The India Office, London•2- and provided due notice was given there could be no cause complaint from shippers or steamship companies • ..or could the Japanese complain of discrimination as the notincation would apply to all vessels# if this line were taken the Japanese line might decide that their general Bahrain trade was worth more to them than the shipments to the mainland» and refuse to carry tne latter, in which case the object of the Bahrain Government would be achieved. On the other hand the Japanese might decide that the mainland trade was more valuaole tnan tne Bahrain trade, in which case they would not call at Bahrain and British trade or at any rate British shipping &gt;.i.e. the B.I.) would benefit accordingly. 6 . It is possible that the Saudi Government may not view this move on the pari of the Bahrain Government with equanimity, but in view of the great financial importance to Bahrain of its transit trade any unpleasantness from that quarter must De faced• After all we are not responsible for the financial propsperfty of Saudi Arabia, but we are in a measure for that of Bahrain, of whose normal revenue- very large proportion comes from customs receipts, a d. o^ this S- ver;y large proportion again consisirS o- transit j would be grateful xor the views o± z various Departments concerned.

My O^nri-NJlAl ttDN When travelling back to Bahrain by Flying Boat on the 28th June 1954 I had an opportunity of examining Ras Tanurah through field glasses. 2. There is only one building which consists of a double storied structure facing the lagoon and behind it a large ware-house. It is situated probably some three hundred yards (distance was difficult to estimate) from the point of Ras Tanurah. The pier is very short and looks hardly more than a made up embankment at the edge of the lagoon. There are not more than two or three small huts. At the extreme point of Ras Tanurah there is a mud (?) hut and a pole used apparently as a flagstaff and for a light. 3. Traffic leaving this ware-house by land would have a difficult path to follow as the spit Joining Ras Tanurah to the mainland is very narrow and appears to have deep sand. 4.

I explained that settlerr.enu o- certain out— | standing questions would remove clouds ana thereby enable the friendship to be still closer. King developed theoreti cal danger to 'Iraq and consequential danger to Saudi Arabia from Persian or Turkish hostility. When I sought elucida tion what he finally suggested (?was) that this country and 'Iraq should conclude some sort of defensive alliance under the auspices of His Majesty's Government and that each should give formal undertaking to His Majesty's Government not to stand against them or to support any Power v^hich might do so.

I emphasised confidence of His Majesty's Government in their view and difficulty they would have in pursuing matter on any other basis but intimation of readiness on their part to consider minor modifica tions of ijine if basis were accepted. King vehemently repudiated suggestion that Turks had any locus standi to alienate his own ancestral rights and used various subsidiary arguments which I will report on arrival in London» I suggested that question be postponed until then* King expressed desire for settlement of Kuwait blockade question on terms of reciprocal advantage. He said cost of maintaining his own Customs post.s would be greater than from ^ . . _ , _ return their success seemed to favour discussion o^. whole (mut.) between Sa'udi Government and Kuwait representatives. As I am not sure whether Shaikh would now welcome this I did not report it by telegraph (mut.) but promised to report.

I tried to soothe him/'him and promised Yusuf Yasin afterwards to go into whole question of direct shipments to Sa'udi ports in London. No other questions were discussed. King said that Fuad would 'be authorised to discuss matters when in London. This removes doubt as to v/hether he is still prepared to use Fuad 'but not as to whether Fuad is prepared to be used.

I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrain in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under the impression that 'the Government' had prohibited such shipments . On my asking whether he meant His Majesty's Government or the Bahrain Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that 1 knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrain Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrain, by a ship which had ttied to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrain and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty's vrovernment hcid subsequently proposed a discussion ot the whole subject 01 transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Government had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that 1 had/-2- had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be - placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Has Tanura? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Has Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there# Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty's Government could not in normal times direct the i.iovenients of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegatioi., though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view th^t the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty's Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrain and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative lor a fixed time.Telegram R.

We have the honour to inform you that as far back as the 13th Ultimo, we had informed Mr. M.Akil Khoonji of Bahrain -V, _ * about the fixture of s.s Haideri for Bahrain under his Agency and the s.s Haideri left Karachi on the 7th Inst for Bahrain and was due to arrive at Bahrain on the ISth inst. On the 10th inst. we received a telegram from Mr. Khoonji to the effect that the Bahrain Government had refused to grant him a license for landing the cargo and acting as our agent. As the vessel was to arrive on the 12th Inst. and if she was unable to discharge her cargo at Bahrain, we would have suffered very heavy losses we had no other alternative but to approach your Honour in the matter and accordingly on the 11th Inst we sent a telegram to your honour reading 'BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT REFUSING PERMISSION DISCHARGE CARGO HAIDERI PRAY HELP OUR AGENT KH0ONJI OTHERV.ISE SUKFERNING HEAVY LOSS AND DAMAGES STOP RESPECTFULLY DRAWING YOUR ATTENTION YOUR LETTER FOURTEENTH JANUARY THIRTY- THREE' and received your telegram of the 12th Inst reading 'YOUR TELEGRAM 11th INSTANT BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT OBJECTS TO PROPOSED AGENT ONLY SUGGEST CAPTAIN APPOINTS SUITABLE AGENT ON ARRIVAL DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS - POLITICAL 789, for which said telegram we beg to tender to your honour our thanks and gratitude.

Rei- Our Agency at Bahrain . We beg to inform you, in consequence of the Basrah merchants making an agreement with us to the effect that all the dates would be shipped from Basra to Karachi and Bombay per our vessels only provided we give them steamers at Basrah at intervals of 10 days, we had to re-establish the Persian t^ulf steamer service and this service commenced with our s.s Haiderl. You will be glad to note -that the Basra merchants did not ship a single packages of dates or any other cargo from Basra by the B.I vessels after the agreement was made with us although the B.I have reduced their rate of freight from Rs.ll/- to Rs.3/- per ton. Agency at Bahrain . You will remember that when our s.s Ahmedi had last called at Bahrain in November 1932, when we had approached you to act as our agents, which you did not accept and being under the impression that due to your numerous engagements you would not accept our agency and (now understand was due to the vessel going to OJair) therefore we had no other alternative but to appoint Mr. M. Akil Khoonji as our Agent at Bahrain. We informed him about his appointment by our letter of the 13th August 1934. The s.s Haideri left for Karachi on the 7th instant night for Bahrain and was due to arrive at Bahrain on the 12th instant. All of a sudden on the 10th instant we received a telegram from Mr. Khoonji that the Bahrain Government had refused to grant him license for landing the cargothe cargo and that he had applied to the Political Agent for permission. As this telegram was received by us on the night of the 10th instant and as the vessel was to arrive at Bahrain on the morning of the 12th instant and the telegraph ic line to Bahrain being interrupted, we were in a great fix and if the cargo was not discharged at Bahrain it not effected /ours^mammasmmmassrry tctw- - 2. our future business but would have been put to a great loss of money and prestige. We therefore sent a telegram to the Political Agent at Bahrain on the 12th instant and requested him to do the needful and on the 12th instant we received his urgent telegraphic reply to the effect that the Bahrain Govern ments objection was only to the appointment of Mr. Khoonji and that the Captain of the Vessel on arrival at Bahrain could appoint any suitable agent. This information gave us heart and allayed our fears and anxiety because we came to know for the first time that the objection raised by the Bahrain Govern ment was in respect of the appointment of Mr. Khoonji and that there was no other objection. We therefore had no other alter native but to approach you once again, that under the circum stances you will not refuse this time and accordingly we sent you a wire on the 12th instant reading:- 'HAIDERI DUE YOURS TODAY APPOINT YOU AGENT PLEASE DISCHARGE MUST SAIL BASRAH IMMEDIATELY IF DETAINING DUFFERING HEAVY LOSSES WIRE SILVERLINK' and received your reply to the said telegram on the 13th instant reading 11 ARRANGED DISCHARGE SATISFACTORILY HAIDER I DEPARTED BASRAH 9 A.M TODAY WIRED BASRAH n . We were glad to receive from you this news in time. We beg to confirm our telegram of the 13th instant reading 'RECEIVED THANKS' which said telegram we trust you have received in order. We received your another telegram of the 13th instant reading 'AGENCY HAIDERI ACCEPTED SHOULD SECOND STEAMER ARRIVE WILL TAKE OVER AGENCY UNLESS OTHERWISE ORDERED'. The meaning of this telegram is not quite clear to us. However we take it to mean that you have taken the agency for Haideri and that you are also willing to act as our agent for the second steamer if we do not order otherwise. If this meaning of ours is correct then, we g6fe=t0 beg to assure that we have appointed you agent for all our vessels and for the whole period /thatthat our vessels be running in the Persian U ulf and that our agency to you was not only for Haideri but for all our vessels of which please rest quite assured. . Future programme * As stated above, in accordance with the agreement with the B asra merchants, we have to give them steamers at intervals of ten days, and as we ourselves have only got two steamers, we have had to make arrangements with a local shipping company, the Malabar Steamship Cq , that they should also send one steamer to Basra in conjunction with our vessels. Vve have also arranged with them that their steamer should be consigned at the Persian U ulf ports to our agents and they have therefore appointed you as their agent at Bahrain. Their letter of appointment is enclosed herev/ith. Their chartered steamer s.s 'H.C.Flood' is leaving Karachi on the 18th instant direct for -Basra which please note. Henceforth, they will also go to Basrah via Bahrain if sufficient induce ment offers. This vessel will arrive at Basrah on or about the 24/25th instant. We are now arranging to send the s.s Ahmedi from here and she is expected to sail from here on or about the 2Snd instant. We beg to confirm our telegram to you dated the 15th instant reading:- 'AHMEDI LOADING EIGHTEENTH FOR BAHRAIN FREIGHT 25 PERCENT LESS - SILVERLINK'. , which said telegram we trust you will have received in order. This telegram we sent you in order that you should induce the importers to order their cargo from Bombay to Bahrain per our vessel, and trust that you will be successful. In the said telegram we have also informed you that our rate of freight would be 25$ less than the B.I. We expect to secure a good quantity of cargo from here and if sufficient inducement offers at Karachi then we shall send the vessel to Karachi also otherwise would despatch her direct to your port from here. As /usual4. usual after departure, we shall wire you of the same together with the number of packages for your port. From yours the vessel will proceed to -tiushire or direct to ^asrah. We shall duly advise you where to despatch the vessel. As at Basrah she will get full load for Bombay, we shall therefore thank you to book all available cargo for Bombay on her outward voyage and give the same to her after completion of discharge of her cargo. However, on the return from Basrah, if the vessel does not get sufficient cargo at Basrah and there should be space left and if sufficient quantity of cargo be available at Bahrain for Bombay and Karachi you then communicate with the Basrah agent and he will advise you about the space etc.. Passengers . As the s.s tT Ahmedi w and the s.s 'Haideri' have no passenger certificate, they cannot carry more than 12 passengers each, which kindly note. The ^aideri can carry 6 Deck Passengers and 6 Cabin Passengers and the Ahmedi can carry 12 Cabin or Deck passengers. Stationery . We are in receipt of your telegram of the 15th instant reading:- 'SEND PASSENGER TICKETS DELIVERY ORDERS BOOK ETC' and beg to inform you that we shall send you all the stationery by the s.s Ahmedi of which please rest quite assured. Nothing further for the present and awaiting your good news.Copy of letter dated the 17th September 19S4 from the Eastern Steam Navigation Company limited, Bombay, to Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, Bahrain.

The Hon 'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, iU8Hi huT t'* 4 * British Residency &amp; Consulate General, wU. - BUSHIRB* Sir, We have the honour to inrite your attention to the siibject of steamers calling at the Port of Ras Tanurah. Up to the present we have declined to send our Mail steamers into that port for two reasons, firstly because of the narigational dangers entailed in mating the port of Ras Tanurah and the difficulties of finding a suitable anchorage with adequate swinging room for the wessels and secondly because we were unwilling to taloe any action which might prejudice the good relations which hawe existed between this Company and the Shaikh of Bahrein for a Tory long period. Unfortunately indications are that we shall be forced to send steamers to Ras Tanurah or allow other Lines to in terrene in the Persian Gulf trade which this Company has built up oyer an ex- tensive period as it is obrious that any Line willing to send steamers to Ras Tanurah will be unable to maintain a service to that port only and cower expenses* The s«s« 'Ahmedi* called at Ras Tanurah in 1952 and the s«s« 'Fagerwik* called last year and it is therefore clear that the danger to which we allude is not imaginary and we apprehend that unless this Company can take steps to cater for the trade Ibn Saud will come to some arrangement with another Line as, according to our information, he is determined to obtain regular direct shipment to Ras Tanurah* Q We have the honour to enquire therefore if there is any possibility of the Government undertaking the survey and proper marking of the channels to Ras Tanurah to afford safe pass- f V ages to vessels bound for that port and whether you could see your way to approach the Shaikh of Bahrein with a view to obtain ing the withdrawal of all notificationa placing restrictions on-2- vessela calling at Bahrein when such veaaela have also cargo for direct discharge at mainland ports.

I had a few further words with Laithwaite on konaay evenin 0 and he agreed that it might he a good thing to improve the sequence and give them greater precision. I told him that ? as regards the substance, I was still nervous aoout the last phrase in the original draft and he suggested that it would suffice to shew that the quesi/ion of a drastic refusal of exemption had heen considered hut that such a threat should not he used prematurely. I have assumed that the instructions to Jedda and Bushire will go hy aespatch, so that the increased length will not matter. I have made the re-draft somewhat hurriedly, not wishing to miss the post. I leave it confidently to you to pull it about as much as you like. You know all my ideas on the subject ana will not need to refer hack to me. I hope to put all these things out of my mind until I see you again on October 22. Yours in haste, (3d.)ANDREW RYAN.P 7 Gen eral line to be taken vis-a -vis trie Saudi Government m dealing with tne question oi' Bahrain Translfpues o 1. It is still the policy of His Ivjajesty's Government to press for an early discussion of this question at a Saudi-Bahraini conference&gt; to he held at Bahrain, with the assistance of the political authorities, to explore all the issues and endeavour to arrive at a settlement ^ - which would he confirmed in due course through the diplomatic channel, see the 1932 correspondence, the ' record of Sir A. Ryan's conversation with Ton Saud at Taif on July 13th last and the record of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on September 21. 2. If the Saudi Government now agree to this local conference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments concerned results from it, cadit quaestiO o If a settle ment does not result, the ground will he clear for lurther discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the general negotiations contemplated after sir A.Ryan returns to Jedda. 3. If, as a condition of agreeing to Hie local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement hy His Majesty's Government as to their attitude regarding tlT imposition oi restrictions hy Bahrain on direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, Mr. Calvert, or in due course sir a. riyan, is authorized to make a statement on the following lines, using discretion as to the precise form to he given to it:- (a) Ihe action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahrnedi incident was an expedient adopted hy them in conditions of urgency and aid not xe pie sent a oonsiciereo. policy oi His Majesty' s Government. (W ' k to P -L . f-L'/fSC, i(0 (b) Neither Kis Ivajesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government have fortiidden shipping companies to accept cargo for direct shipment to the Hasa Coast, under penalty of not heing allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmeaij transit duty was claimed. His tojesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to shipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications for facilities for direct shipment, having regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may he made hy the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) His Iwajesty's Government are, however, anxious to promote the removal of all causes of difficulty in connexion with the general question of shipments for Hasa. If the local conference is agreed to and produces favour able results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to refrain from any future action analogous to that taken in the case of the Ahmedi. (d) It is owing to the influence of His Majesty's Government, which was exerted strongly with the Bahrain Government in 1920, that sauai importers have lor many years enjoyed the benefit of a very favourable rate of transit duty, which has in recent years been insufficient to cover the cost of the increased facilities provided at Bahrain for goods in transit# His iwajesty's Government cannot, however, ignore the importance of the transit trade to the economic life of Bahrain. While recognizing that the fostering of direct trade to the Saudi mainland is/0 is a matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi Government, they must equally recognize that any considerahle diversion ol trade from its present channels would seriously affect the revenues of Bahrein and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves by raising the dues on goods continuing to pass through Bahrain. The interests of Bahrain and Hasa must continue to he interdependent for many years to come and the case is one for a mutual accommoelation of those interests. (e) His Iviajesty's Government consider that this statement shoula remove any misgiving on the part of the Saudi Government as to their attitude, which is inspired solely hy their desire to promote the desired accommodation of interests, as a result of a free exchange of views between experts qualified hy local knowledge to 8-avise on the hest means of attaining it. 4. If the Saudi Government should now agree to the local conference ana its proceedings shoula nevertheless he delayed by insistence on the Sauai side on the grievances alleged hy Ion Saud, the political Agent will have authority to make a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate. 5. The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ion Saud or his Government shoula be exempted from transit dues. If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption. If no settlement is arrived at, it may become necessary, not only to raise the aues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse any exemption whatsoever/whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Tbn saucTs personal use. it is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda and tne political Agent to include a hint as to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in any statement on the ahove lines, but care should he taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might he construed as a threat aimed at Ton o^ua personally.•i4 J No. 1064-S of J.934.

The Hon'ble Lieut •-Colonel T.C.i 1 owle,L. # ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India| H«w Delhi. Subject: Bahrain Transit Dues f Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with Mr. /,/ ' Laithwaite 1 s letter to me, No.P .Z. 6267/34, datea the 12th October 1934, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No .3027, dated the 11th October, from essrs .Kackinnc^ Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bombay, Agents for the British India oteam Navigation Company Ltd. 2. It has been generally accepted now that the action of the Bahrain Government at the time of the Vhmedi' inciaent was merely an urgent expedient, that it did not represent a policy and will not be repeated; and it is propose : that oir undrew Ryan should be authorised in certain circumstances to make a statement in this sense to the Saudi Government in the forthcoming Anglo-Saudi negotiations. 3. It seems to me that the pendulum has now swung back, and since the Bahrain Government cannot repeat the action in the Ahmedi case I suggest that we should take the opportun ity of furthering British shipping interests against the competition of foreign shipping interests by informing ivessrs. Lackinnon /-2- Mackiniion Mackenzie &amp; Co. confidentially tiiat no restrictions will be placed by the Bahrain Government on vessels which carry cargo for direct discharge at mainland ports. The British India Steam Navigation Company, who are the only Company to run a regular weekly service in the Persian Gulf, including Bahrain, will be in a very strong position to eliminate foreign J competition if they can make Sas Tanurah regular port ot call for their slow mail steamers. 4. I am not aware to what extent the proposed communication to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. will deprive oir Andrew Ryan of a card in the forthcoming negotiations, but as it is very likely that the Saudi Government will press early for a statement from His Majesty's Government on the question, it is a card whose value would soon vanish. 5. With regard to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.'s enquiry as to the possibility of Government undertaking the survey and marking of the channels to Ras Tanurah I propose, if there is no objection, to advise the Company to raise the question with the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee. At the same time it is for consideration whether, now th t it is in our interests to render the approach to the port safe for British shipping, we could not make a virtue of necessity by offering to the Saudi Government to undertake, on payment, the work of providing navigational aids for the approach to the port. It is a gesture that would probably be apprecibtea by Ibn Saud. 6» When, and if, cargo is taken direct to Ras Tanurah instead of passing through Bahrain, the Bahrain Government will of course lose heavily on their transit dues, but this seems /-3- seems Inevitable. I am sending copies of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, His Majesty's Charge d f Affaires Jedda and the i-olitical Agent, Bahrain, with whom I have dis cussed the question.

RYAN stated that his conversation with King Ibn Saud at Taif previous to his departure on leave had convinced him that the King felt with great intensity ebout this subject, more particularly in regard to what he con ceived to be His Majesty's Government's boycott of his attempts to develop the Hasa coast. He took umbrage at anything in the nature of exceptional treatment of his ports as compared with others in the Gulf. He already believed»- believed that the Bahrain Government, v'hom he identified with His Majesty* b Government, were preventing ships from carrying cargo direct to the Hgsb . v^o ? '^t. buch a notifica*- tion 'by the Bahrain Governnent with regard to vessels carry ing direct cargo for the mPinlend ps Colonel Fowle had proposed in his letter No.576/S of the 2oth June to Mr. Leithwaite, would only/intensify Kin£ Ihn Baud's grievance. 4. COLON T: -L FOV/LE explained that his proposal had teen intended ps no more than a tentative suggestion, and that in the light of the views expressed 'by the Foreign Office (see Mr. Rendel^s letter of ^/ ' /v ^'- to Mr. Laithwaite)&gt; and the Board of Trade in regard to it, he was. willing to withdraw it. 5. The discussion then passed to the question oj . the tactics to be adopted vis-a-vis of King Ihn Baud in dealing with this dispute. Assuming that the question of the economic relations between Bahrain and baudi Arabia would have to be included among the subjects dibcussed in the proposed general negotiations between His Majesty's Govern ment and the baudi Government (and the meeting agreed that this question must in fact be pooled with other outsocinding questions in these negotiations) it was necessary to draft a line of policy for Sir A.Ryan's guidance. There were two distinct aspects of this question: (a) King Ibn baud desired an assurance from His Majesty's Government that the hostile attitude of ba.hj.ain towards direct shipments to Hasa, the most striking example of which wp.s the 'Ahmedi' ca.se, J.id aa J u represent the consistent policy of the Bah r ?.n G'^ervmBT* or His Majesty's Government. 'b).. .«■ f 4707/'® 13, (b) Apart from this question of direct shipment to Hasa ports, there flms also the question of the rate at which the transit dues levied by the Bahrain Government on goods for the mainland were to he fixed. 6. With regard to (a) the first point that arose was whether it was permissible or desirable to use the possi bility of a policy of 'blockrde' as a threat to induce Ibn Saud to agrfe to a conference at Bahrain. 7. MR* LAITHWAITE suggested that, although it was clearly desirable to arrange a conference at Bahrain if this could possibly be managed, ultimately, if the Saudi Government proved unaccommodating, a policy in the sense indicated by the Bahrain Government's action in the 'Ahmedi' case might be justified on grounds of necessity. The bheikh of Bahrain could not afford to lose the money which ceine to him from Bahrain's transit trade and his action in defence of this trade could be justified on those same grounds of urgent economic necessity which I^uad Bey Hamza had recently invoked in defence of the Saudi blockade of Koweit. It therefore seemed legitimate at least to threaten King Ibn Saud with the possibility of action in this sense 4 and perhaps also to use this threat as a lever to secure the lifting of the Koweit blockade. 8. MR. RENDEL saw the strongest objection to using an argument which virtually amounted to the thesis that ♦necessity knows no law*, even If the Saudi Government had themselves appealed to it in connexion with their treatmentof Kowelt. In his view such p policy could only be justified as a direct measure of retaliation against the Kowelt hlockade - and it hod been agreed that there were serious objections to establishing any direct connexion between these two questions. Moreover the influence enjoyed by His iv^ajesty's Government in Arabia and the Persian Gulf rested in face partly on their not using such retaliatory methods. Two blccks did not make a white and we should gain nothing by using the illegitimate methods sometimes practised by our adversaries. further, the Saudi Govern ment had already been assured that the 'Alimedi' incident did not represent a settled policy, and that His iviajesty's Government did not intend to blockade Hasa. % 9. SIR A.ITCAN added that s in his view, the Saudi blockade of Koweit and the suggested Bahraini blockade of the Hasa ports were not really parellel. A precedent for the first might perhaps b^ found elsewhere, but it would in Sir A.Ryan's opinion be contrary to all civilized practice to prohibit the carriage of goods, by way of through ship ment, to the Hasa Coast under penalty of the ships not being allowed to call at Bahrain or compelled to pay transit dues there. He considered that His Majesty's Government would not be able to justify these extraordinary measures which constituted King Ibn Saud's main grievance. In replying to the. Saudi complaint His Majesty's Government must either deny that they., or the Bahrain Government, were preventing British shipping from making direct shipments to the Hasa coast or they must admit it. He suggested that a possible course....% ■ 5. course might he to edniit thrt the British Inaia Conpan^ were actlnc under some pressure irons the Bshrpin Government and in the liiht of their own interests, hat to add that His Majesty's Government would not ectually encourage the Company to adopt another policy unless a satisfactory general settlement were reached oetween Saudi Arabia, end Bahrain. 10. MR. RiMDliiL objected that this mignt result, in an awkward 'discussion with the Saudi Government as to the extent to which action could be taken oy Majesty 's Government to facilitate direct shipments, and that such discussion mi'ht end in His Majesty 's Government being engaged in more active intervention than they had contemplated. On the main point at issue he added that it seemed unlikely that King Ibn Saud would agree to a conference until he knew whether a blockade were seriously tiireatened 01 i.oto In vie., of this and also of the irregularity of a, blockade policy, he proposed that King Ihn Srud should be approached on the following lines. ' ho blockade would oe imposed on Saudi ports; on the other hand the transit dues were essential to the finances of Bahrain. His Majesty's Government must, therefore, once again inviue the Saudi Government to discuss the general question of their commercial relations with Bahrain c ^ a conference. If a. satisfactory general settlement were reached at this conference. His Majesty's Government would undertake to see that the transit dues vere no^ raised above a certain point. This would enaole His Majesty's Government to make the proposal for a. conference attractive to the Saudi Government without necessitating6.

He then further elaborated Mr© Rendel's Busiest ion snd. proposed tliD-o the following line should be taken with the Saudi Government on their 'beins once s.gr..in invited to a. conference et Bahrein;- (e) The S^udi Government should be assured once saaln that the action of the Bahrain Government in connexion with the 'Ahmedi' incident did not represent r settled policy. ^ (b) As regc-rds the attitude of British shipping towards direct shipments to H^sa, the Saudi Government might be told that lis Mrjesty's Government were unable to dictate a, policy to the interests concerned, who naturally followed the ir own adv antc-£ e. Ki s Ma.J e sty' s Gov ernment wouldj nowever^ ensure that the Bahrain Government did not exercise undue pressure© (c) The Bahrain Government were entitled to raise the transit dues© Sir -At, Ryan very much doubted, in spite of the renev/ed representations which had recently been mode to them, whether the Saudi Govenment would rr:ree to a conference without receiving beforehand an assurance that j-.'in Majesty's Government did not intend to enforce a blocka.de of the Hasa ports. Such an assurance might nevertheless be confined to the mo^t general terms and it micht be hinted to the Saudi Government that, if they proved obdurate, the transit dues might be raised againat them©7c them. 12o i ;IE . LAITHWAITE sugGested thot Kins Ibn Saud mipjiit refuse to negotiate under a threat. SIR A, RYAN agreedj hut observed that if King Ibn Saud did decline the proposal for 8, conference, he might he told that the Bahrain Government must recompense themselves for the lack of any satisfactory commercial arrangement with Saudi Arabia by raising the dues* The question then arose whether any raising of the dues in these or similar circumstances should extend to the levying of dues on those goods which at present pass into Saudi Arabia free as being for the King's personal use. SIR A. RYAN recommended that goods which were genuinely for King Ibn Saud 1 s own use should in any case continue to enjoy exemption, since his resentment at the removal of this privilege might do more damage to Anglo-Saudi relations than its abolition could profit Bahrain. MR, LAITHWAITIC inclined to the view that, if failure to reach an agreement resulted in an economic war, even King Ibn Saud's personal stores could not be passed overo As it was, he appeared to be receiving under this exemption consignments very much larger than the needs of his household would seem to warrant, e.g. 30,000 bags of rice, and it might be assumed that the surplus went to the tribes* f 13. On the main issue MR. LAITHWAITE and COLONEL FOWLE concurred generally in the course proposed by Sir A Ryano Mr. Laithwaite proposed, however, that the assurance regarding the blockade should only be given if— ep 11 I if the Saudi Governnent refused to attend the conference unless they received itc He pIbo preferred that His Majesty's Government should not specifically undertake to ensure that the Bahrain Government did not being pressure to beer on the shipping companies&lt;, It had already been arranged that the Political Agent, Bahrain, would lend his assistance in connexion with any discussions at Bahrain. But, if the Saudi Government particularly desired that the negotiations should be tripartite, there would be no objection to arranging for the Political Agent or the Political Resident to be a member of the conference. It seemed, however, better that the Bahrainis and Saudi representatives should, at any rate in the first instance, deal with the matter direct, with the informal assistance of the Political Agento i 14c ivIR* RkMDEL also agreed to the course proposed^ A threat to raise the transit dues would, in his view, be a legitimate bargaining: counter, whereas a threat of a. blockade would not 9 15c MR. LAITJ-r'AITE in conclusion suggested that it might be possible to say to the Saudi Government that, if they would agree to negotiate at Bahrain, His Majesty's Government for their part would advise the Bahrain Government not to exercise for the time being their undoubted sovereign rights and raise the dueso A summary of the course of action agreed upon by the meeting was then dictated, which is given below as amended later by Sir A* Hyan* 1. It is still the policy of His Ilajesty's GovernmentGovemmenb to press for en early discussion of this question at 8 Smdi -BaJxraini conference, to 'be held at Bahrain, with the assistance of the political authorities to explore all the issues and endeavour to amve at a settlement which would be confirm3d in due course through the diplomatic channelc See the 1932 correspondence, the record of Sir A* Ryan's conversation with Ibn Saud at Taif on Jule 13th last and the record of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza at 'he Foreign Office on September 21stc If the Saudi Government now agree to this local conference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments concerned results from it, cad^t auaestioc If a. settlement does not result, the ground will be clear for further discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the general negotiations contemplated after Sir A© Ryan returns to Jedda* If, as a condition of agreeing to the local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement by His Majesty's Government as to their attitude regarding the imposition of restrictions by Bahrain on direct shipments to the Hasa. Coast, Ivlr* Calvert, or in due course Sir A 0 Ryan, is authorised to make a statement on the following lines, using discretion as to the precise form to be given to it;« (a) The action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahmedi incident was- — /CN 10. was en expedient adopted by them in conditions of urgency and did not represent e considered policy of His Majesty^ Government. (b) Neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government have forbidden shipping companies to eccept cargo for direct shipment to the Hase Coast, under penalty of not being allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmedi^ transit duty was claimed. Kis Majesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to shipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications for facilities for direct shipment, having regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may be made by the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) His Majesty's Government are, however, anxious to promote the removal of all causes of difficulty in connexion with the general question of shipments for I-iasa. If the local conference is agreed to and produces favourable results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to refrain from any future action analogous to that taken in the case of the Ahmedic (d)1 yA tt ■ 11. (d) it is oviii^ to tne v influence of Kis I rjesty 's Government, whicli wps exerted 'tron'.'ly with tlie Brhrain Government in 1^0. thet 3r;adi importers hpve for many yerrs enjoyed trie benefit of b very arable rate of transit duty. liir, i-rjesty's Government cpnnot, however, ignore the importance of the transit tr^de to the economic life of Bahrain. Vvhile recognising that the fostering of ciirect tr^de to tiie S^udi mrinland is s matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi Government, they must equally recognise tnet any considerable diversion of trade irom its present channels would seriously ; --L g ct tue revenues of Bcuhram and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves b3' r raising tlie dues on goods continuing: to pass through Be nroin. The interests of Bahrain and Kasa. must continue to be interdependent j . or many years to come and the case is one for a mutual accommodation of those interests. (e) Lis ivirjesty 1 s Government consider that MM this statement should remove any mis- .iving on tne part of the Saudi Government a,s to tneir attitude, which is inspired solely by their desire to promote the desired acconmodPtion of interests, a.s a. result of12. of f free exchenge of views between experts qualified by locrl knowledge to advise on the best meenr of attaining it. If the Saudi Government should not a^ree to the local conference end its proceedings should nevertheless be delayed by insistence on the Saudi side on the grievances alleged by Ibn Saud, the Political Agent will have authority to ma.ke a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate• The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ibn Saud or his Government should be exempted from transit dues* If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption• If no settlement is arrived at, it may become necessary, not only to raise the dues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse nay exemption whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Ibn Saud's personal use. It is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda end the Political Agent to include a hint as to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in any statement on the above lines, but care should be taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might be construed a.s a threat aimed at Ibn Saud personally.CONFIDENTIAL.

If only give per cent of present mercantile community in Bahrain found it necessary to migrate to Ras Tanurah, Bahrain would lose five per cent of her customs dues or about Rs #30,000 in addition to re-export duties# She would also lose if Ras Tanurah became a useful port or big town the custom of those who now come from Hasa to buy supplies and replenish their stocks.

The main points appear to be as follows: (a) If Ibn Saud can develop Has Tanura then, in my opinion, he will do so whether the transit dues are given u t by Bahr -in or not. The amount which he, or his people, will gain by these dues being given up, i.e. Hs.30,000 or so per annum, while large enough for Bahrain, is not enough to induce him to give up a scheme which will not only further his trade but soothe his amour giving him at last a decent port in tne Persian . Gulf. (b) I see danger in Government of Indian suggestion being mooted either directly or indirectly to the Saudi Governme.-t, wiuther at the Bahrain comer ..nee or otherwise, as having got this idea irem us, Ibn Saud, knowing that he cannot from the practical point 01 vie^ develop Ras Tanura (assuming he cam.ot do so) may put u^ a strong bluff that he is quite capable of doing so. in the face of this bluff the Bahrain Government and our selves may a^ree to remit the transit dues .nd so give something for nothing. The really important point on which we need cast iron information (whether we can get this inlorma- tion or not I do^t know) is whether U) Ibn Saud can or cannot from a technical point 01 view develop Ras ianuria into a port and (2) whether if he can, it would be worth his while financially to do so. Onee we can make up our minds on these two points we shall know what line to take Failing this decision we shall have to wait and see. I will discuss with Colonel Loch at^ Bahrain.

After consultation with political .igeivt Bahrain 1 venture to egress the opinion that there are most serious objections to action suggested in your paragraph 4. 2. Advantages put forward for Bahrain to surrender transit dues would doubtless have weight if it were certain or even likely that Ibn 3aud was about to develop Has Tanura into a ^ort and large town. But the very o^osite is the case. Latest information is that Ibn Saud has done no work whatever recently at rias Tanura, that wiiat work hw iicis c&gt;oiie already has been of little practical importance (vide my letter No.629-3 of 6th July 1934) and that the Hasa Oil Company who are believed to have some arrangement with him for the development of Has Tanura have (vide paragraph 3 oi my telegram No.56 of 14th January) built a pier at DAWIAU where steamers cannot go. Moreover leading -.)c4J:ir»in i.ejui merchants ^usalbis and others who should be best judge of chance of developments on mainland are still buying land in Bahrain. ^ ^ 3. This being so proposal in your paragraph 4 woikld 1 am afraid give the unfortunate (though mistaken) impression to the Bahrain Government (who are of course well iniormed as to the position at Ras Tanura and who have not forgotten that /that in 1920 under pressure from us they lowered their transit dues for what they considered was to the benefit of Ibn oaud) that we were now asking them to give up for the advantage of the Saudi Government a certain income of xis^JO^OOO/- a year to ward off a hypothetical danger which at present seems most unlikely to materialise* 4. further if I were to put proposal to Shaikh and he were to ask me, as most likely he would, what was ay personal opinion of the likelihood of the development of Has Tanura, I do not see how I could avoid replying that the likelihood at present seemed to me very small* 6. When and if the development a iias Tanura seems probable, and presumably such a large undertaking could not be seriously contemplated without Minister Jedda and n^self getting to hear of it, the question can be taken up on its merits* As things stand I most earnestly urge His Majesty^ Government to abandon their suggestion* 6.
