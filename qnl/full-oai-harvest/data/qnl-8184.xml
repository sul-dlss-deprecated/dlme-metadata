The papers include notes on discussions between the Sultan and the Viceroy of India on 16 November 1937 (folios 67-73), between the Sultan and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary of the External Affairs Department, Government of India, on 17 November 1937 (folios 60-66), and between the Sultan and Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on 6 July 1938 (folios 12-13). These notes were used in preparation for possible subjects of future discussions and responses were prepared, point by point (see folios 37-41 and 49-58). Questions raised include that of the Muscat Arms Subsidy, the Sultan’s intention to visit Italy, the need for a British officer to accompany the Sultan during his visit to the United Kingdom, whether the Sultan will push for closer ties with the Foreign Office, and correct terms of address for the Sultan.Additional correspondence between the Foreign Office and the British Legation in Jedda concerning the Sultan’s direct relations with Saudi Arabia is also included (folios 3-9).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>State visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000200#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
