This includes the abandonment of stations operated by Cable and Wireless Limited at Henjam, Charbar [Chabahar], and Jask; the deputation of an Inspector of Observatories to visit stations in the Persian Gulf (see folio 28 for the tour programme); a proposal to appoint a British meteorological and hydrological expert to train officers of the Iranian Navy; and the gift of Henjam's meteorological equipment to the Iranian Government.A note written by Charles William Blyth Normand, Director-General of Observatories in India, outlines how the closure of aforementioned meteorological stations will hinder forecasting in Northern India and the Persian Gulf: see folios 47-50. It includes a map illustrating the locations of meteorological stations in Iran and Arabia.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Tehran (Sir Hugle Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen and Sir Horace James Seymour), officials of the Admiralty (Sidney Hill Phillips and Harold Eastwood), officials of the Foreign Office (George William Rendel) and officials of the Foreign and Political Department (Department of External Affairs from 1937) of the Government of India. There is also some correspondence with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most of the correspondence in the file is forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, rather than addressed directly to the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director-General of Observatories in India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Meteorological stations</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Meteorological equipment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000219#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000219#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
