'Ormonde' in the Persian Gulf, raises indirectly the question of the status of the Island of Nabiyu Parur. You will see from pages 105 and 106 of 'P.G.13' that the status of this barren and uninhabitated island was examined in 1928. The conclusion then reached was that'there is 'little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, 'though a slight element of doubt as to a Jowasimi claim 'exists.* If there is indeed little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, there would seem no harm in including it in the list of islands on which we shall ask the Persian Government for permission to land.

If we did so, the Persians would certainly at once claim the island, and would merely regard our action as the confirmation of their belief that we are always out to seize what we can in Gulf waters. Another alternative would be to say nothing about Nabiyu Farur in our note to the Persians, and trust to luck that they will raise no objections when the survey parties land. Personally, however, I see no advantage in this course. It is, I think, quite impossible for us seriously to contend that the island is not a Persian island.

Dear Sir, I beg to submit the following: In the Galita Channel £ miles I? of the Fratelli hocks, I noticed that the compass bearings did not agree with vertical sextant angles of Fratelli Locks and Cape .Serrat. On obtaining a transit bearing I found that the standard compass had acquired a deviation of 7 degrees ._,ast, and the error instead of being 7 degrees West wos nil.. The ship was on a £70 degree course. After using the compass bearings applying no error, the position agreed with that taken with sextant angles. ^fter passing 'Cape Serrat the compass settled down normal, the steering compass was unaffected throughout * On passing Cape do Gata 5 milos South course 270 degrees the standard compass swung 15 degrees on either side and when it settled down normal I found a change of 7 degrees in the steering compass. After passing Cape de Gata the compasses settled down no rma l and for the remainder of the voyage they have remained normal I have passed these places several times before but have never had the same experience and I have been in this ship for near3-y seven years, so I am reporting the matter to you in case other ships should meet with the same experience* I am, Dear Sir, ' Yours faithfully, (Sgd*) B.

'Ormonde' in the vicinity of Khasab. 2. During a conference on board R.:'.S. 'Cyclamen' at Bokha on 5th ^arch, between Commanding Officer of ''Cyclamen', the esidency Agent froniSharjah and the Sheikh of Bokha, concerning the landing of 'Ormonde’s' party, the sheikh stated that the Sheikh of Khasab was causing trouble and obstructing the arrangements. 3. H.M.S. 'Cyclamen' (with the Residency Agent and the Sheikh of Bokha on board) and HJ/.S.'Ormonde' therefore proceeded to Khasab on 6th Ilarch. 0 n arrival, the Sheikh of Khasab refused to go on board H.. .8.' Cyclamen' stating that his people would not allow him to, and the Sheikh of Bokha refused to go on shore, on the ground that, by the rules of courtesy, having come so far. the Sheikh of Khasab should come off ana see him. In reply to a letter reauesting the Sheikh of Khasab to come on board, Commanding Officer or 'Cyclamen' received a letter purporting to come from the people of Khasab saying that they would not allow the Sheikh to come, but, in the light of subsequent events, it is considered probable that the Sheikh, himself, have instructions for this letter to be sent. 4. The Sheikh of Bokha eventually agreed to go on shore and on 7th inarch a conference between the Residency Agent, the Sheikh of Bokha and the Sheikh of Khasab, was ?eld on shore. 5. H.I .S.'Lupin' arrived at Khasab at 0030 on 7th Larch and joined H.M.S.'Cyclamen' and 'Orrronde' there. H.M.S.'Cyclamen' sailed for Henjam at 1000 the same day. 6. The Residency Agent and the Sheikh of Bokha came on board 'Lupin' on the evening of 7th March. The principal opposition to the landing of 'Orncnde’s' P^ty appeared to come from the Sheikh of Khasab. The Sheikh of Bokha seemed inclined to come to an arrangement, though he was evidently afraid of offending the Sheikh of Khasab arid his other co-religionists by allowing Christians into the country. 7. It is believed that one of the objections to allowing the party to land was due to the suspicion that they had some ulterior motive, such as the enforcement of the authority of the Muscat Government, or the establishment of an Air base the former suspicion having been increased by the fact that a honour to forward the following reportrepreaentativo of the lluecat Qofornaent wae brought up in •Ormonde** on hor firet arriral, and that the Sultan*e /ali ^ to took passa^^e in her to Jh&amp;sab, 8 # The situation was further complicated by the enmity existing between the Sheikhs of Bokha and Khasab t arising out of a question of the ownership of 1.000 rounds of arircunition. and also by the fact that there seemed to he considerable doubt as to whoae territory the position where the '(DmxmdeV' party wished to go, was in. 9. The Sheikh of Bokha landed again on the evening of 7th March to continue the discussion with the Sheikh of Khasab and endeavour to arrive at an agreement. 10. On 8th March, the Shaikh of Bokha returned on board 'Lupin' and said that they would both a^reo to the Ormonde'*' E arty landing, and would provide a joint escort composed of okha and Khasab men, on condition that the British Governrasnt would recognise them as independent like the Sheikhs on the Trucial Coast, and would guarantee to protect them against aiy interference by the ^scat Government. 11. On being told that this was quite impossible and that the question of their relations with the Muscat Govemmont could not be discussed, the Sheikh offered to errry out the alx&gt;ve a^eement for the sum of 400 Rupees between the two sheikhs for the coat of the escort for any period up to a wck t and a present of 1,000 rounds of ammunition to enable them to settle their dispute referred to in paro^jraph 8 above. 12. These conditions were a^*eed to and it was arrayed that 'Ormonde^* party should land next morning. 9th l arch, and meet the escort on the beach. The Sheikh of Bokha and his men. who had previously been accommodated on board ! • .3.'Ormonde', then returned to the shore to make the final arrangements with the Sheikh of Khas&amp;b. 13. At about 0030 on 9th March, the Sheikh of Pokha returned on hoard 'Lupin' and reported that a dispute had arisen between them concerning the position of the boundary between their territories, ana that the arran^raonts were cancelled. , however, proceeded to the landing place at Kidha Cove on the morning of 9th March in accordance with the original arrangements, on the chance that the sheikhs might have again changed their minds. 14. !!.li.S.'Ormonde' then sailed for Groat Quoin Island in order to lend a survey party there. „ Shortly after 'Ormonde*s' party had left the ship the oheikh of Bokha and his men arrived on hoard 'Lupin' and the Sheikh rejurtod that the Sheikh of Khasab had declared that the position where the 'Orraonde f o' party wished to go was in Khasab territory and nothing to do with Bokha, and that he only would provide the escort. 16. The Sheikh of Pokha was informed that, if he allowed this and did not allow ary interference from Bokha. he would still receive his 200 Rupees, etc; in accordance with the originalwho had searched them and taken away a letter of instructions they wore carrying to the officer in charge of the party and had sent them back, and that they had not therefore delivered the rations to the survey party on the peak. 27. At daylight on 12th iarch, H.M.S.'Lupin' anchored close inshore under Jahal Sham In order to interview the Sheikh of Passa, and to send the rations up to tlie survey P*r ty. 28. Shortly after anchoring, a boat which proved to have the Sheikh of Hassa on board was sighted pulling in the direction of Khaoah. On the motorboat being sent to intercept her this boat made for the shore and the Sheikh jumped out and ran away among the rocks. 29. On being re-assured by the interpreter he returned to his boat, but refused to come on board 'Lupin'.

The ^heikh stated that he was (ping to visit the Sheikh of Khasab and would be away 6 few days. 30. On returning to the anchorage off Khasab, a boat with wliat appeared to be a sheikh or some such notability was sighted approaching Khasab from the north-westward, and the ^ali reported later that a considerable concentration of armed men was going on there, and that some of the inhabitants were removing their belongings inland. ^5 rrap wi® , «\perty returned to 'Lupin' on the evening O f 12th boron and landed a/piin on L5th ’larch, returning again the same evening without further incident. r 32.

The Interpreter then returned on board to report, and landed again later to say that, as permission had once been given by the Sheikh of Hassa, the party had already landed but if it was desired they would be ordered to come down. 37. 'Lupin' then weigh od and proceeded to a position from where the party could he seen, and anchored off the landing place wnen they were seen to be coming down* 38* About twenty armed men came down to the beach, apparently to ensure that the party were returning to the ship but they appeared to be nuite friendly and the party was re-embarked without incident. 39. The esaential observations from the Arabian side have now been completed and it is not anticipated that 1T . V .S. 'Gmmde* will require to land any more parties on the main land there. 40. On 17th March* a letter which was translated into Arabic was sent to the 3hqikh of Khasab from Coirffnftnriing Officer, informing him that other arrangements had been made and that H#U.3.'Ormonde f s work had been completed, and that it was therefore no longer desired to land at Kidna Cove.

The ^ali was infomed that this Information would be passed to the Muscat Government and instxuotions asked for* and that the reply would be communicated to him. A signal waa accord ingly made to the Political Agent at Muscat and repeated to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* and the Senior Naval dfficer, Persian Gulf* ('Lupin’s' 1304/7). 4. The Wall again cam on board on 9th March and reported that he was not safe on shore and that the Sheikh would not allow him to be eiqjplied with any provisions. Jte was informed that it was not considered that he was in any danger while H.M. Ship was present, and he was supplied with some provisions. 5. On 10th March, H.M.3. ,4 i.iqpin a proceeded to rtaa-al Khaimah to land the Residency Agent there, and returned to Khasab the same day. 6. On the morning of 10th March* H.M.S. H Urmonde H * which had anchored off Khaeab during the absence of 'Lupin* reported that the v&lt;r eli had requested that he and his retinue consisting of hie son, ,10 guards and 5 women, might take refuge on board one of H.M. Ships* and be given a passage to Hen jam or Muscat* also that the Wall wae being starved by the Sheikh and that K.M.S. 'Ormonde' had applied him with three dnys v provlaftons. 7. H.M.3. 'Ormonde' was instructed to inform the V/oli that one of H.?i.Ships would remain at Khasab for the present but not to take him on board. 8. On the same day, (10th ^larch), a signal was received from the Hon'ble, The Political Resident* saying that the Sultan of Muscat, was sending letters to the Sheikh of Khasab and to the wall by an accredited representative who was bslng given a passage to Has-al-Khaimah by Plying Boat, and H.M.Navy was asked to show this jreprosentative every coneideratipn. The ^ali was informed accordingly. 9. In view of the last sentence of this message 'Lupin’s' cypher meeeage 2030/10 was sent to the Kon’ble* The Political esldent* in order to confirm that no action should be taken tr enforce the authority of the Sultan’s representative or of th' Wali. This was confirmed by the Political Resident in his oy* messfige of 13th March. yXO# At it was not known on what day the Sultan's representative would arrive at Ras-al-Khaimah, and as it was aosuraed he would haw no difficulty in gotiing from Ras-al-Khaimah to Khasab, it was considered advisable that H*!l*3* M l.upin‘' should await his arrival at Khasab and not proceed to Has-al-Khaimah. 11# On 12th Mardi, the Wali again requested to be allowed to take refuge on board H.M.Ship# This wau relUsed, but he was told that he might do so if actually attacked and unable to defend ^his fort# 12# .On 13th March, a message was received from the Rm'ble The Political He si dent, instructing Cor^anding Officer to try to compose the differences between the Sheikh of Khusnb and the Wali, end to get both parties to agree.to tbs maintenance of the previous “status quo H # 13# The Senior Kaval Officer’s Interpreter wos ther fore sent ashore with a messago to the Sheikh ‘'equesting him to meet Commanding Of floor and the Wali either on board lUlf.

It was not considered that either of these opinions are vexy reliable, and it same probable that the principal cause is the Sheikh's refusal to reco&amp;ilse the authority of the '‘usuat Government, and the suspicion aroused by the incidents in connection with the landing of K.&amp;.3.'Ormonde*e' surveying party, that the v/ali is endeavouring to enlist the help of the British to on force it* The Wall atates that there was no trouble between himself and the Sheikh before the arrival of 'Ormonde'• 23* The preparations mentioned In para*16 appear to be duo to the Sheikh's expectation that some action may be taken against him by the British or Muscat Gov^mmeiits, and it aeons unlikely that the concentration is directed especaiily against the mli* 24* It is considered improbable that an attack would be made on the Wali while one of H*M*Ships are in the vicinity, but in the absence of a ship he would probobly have difficulty in obtaining provisions, and lie haa stated that in that event he would not remain at Kh&amp;sab* 25* On 17th March, a moeaage was received from the Hon'ble the Political Kesident, etating that it had been recommended that prompt steps should be taken to enforce the autliority of the Muscat State at Khasab ond that the Sultan or his Waair should proceed there to impose punishment, which should be enforced by one of H*K* Ship •* 26* A will therefore regain at Khasab or the vicinity until further instructions are received from the Honble, The Political Hesident, and he has been informed accordingly.

On 22nd March, the Wall reported that the Sheikh oaan of Khasab had left Khasab that morning for Limah with 15 men, and the crew of a dhow which had been in Xl|hlnatone Inlet reported haying sighted the party and that they were travelling over-land. The v/ali also reported that he had received a letter from the Headman of Kurasar offering his assistance against Sheikh HasBan. 8. Later the same day, the Wall came on board with the messenger from Kumaar who reported that when the question of li. .0. •Ormonde' landing surveying parties in the vicinity ***** the Sheikh Hassan of Khasab and Shaikh Saleh of made a secret agreement to Join forces to defend their country against the British and to eject the Wall of Khasab and proclaim themselves Independent of Muscat. The Headman of Kumaar had been asked to Join in the agreement but he had refused. #hen H. .Ships returned to Khasab in March. Sheikh aass&amp;n wrote to Sheikh Saleh to say that he expected some JT*® 6° An « t0 taken against him and Sheikh Saleh asks Sheikh Hassan to meet him at Limah to dieouee what etepe they should take. ^ 6. The Messenger alec said that the Headman of Kurasar had heard that the Wall of Khaeab was no longer officiating and was in danger, so he had sent to offer hie assistance. 7.

SJifilOii NAVAL OFFICER, FSHSIAN GULF. 8./- 2 - 6* On 23rd March, a message was received from the Honourable, The Political Resident, stating that he was recommending the Muscat Government to send the Waslr Thomas in the ”A1 3ald ,, to Lloah to investigate there and then to proceed to Khasab (vice Political Resident 9 s message Ho•286 of 23rd March - copy attached)* 9* On the afternoon of 23rd March, the Wall came on board with the same messenger from Kumsar, who reported that on his way back to Kumaar that morning he had met a man with a message to the Headman from Sheikh Has nan and Sheikh Saleh to say that they were both going to A1 PUjalra to get the Sheikh there to Join them, and asking vhsther the Headman of Kumzar would join thorn or not* The messenger did not know what reply the Headman was tending, but it was presumed he would refuse* 10* The information supplied by this man appears to bs reliable. It is understood his name is Sallaman, and hs said hs was well known to the Waslr Thomas* 11* On 24th March, a signal was received from the Honourable, The Political Resident, saying he was recommending to the Government of India that H*M*8hlp should proceed to A1 Pujaira to meet the Wasir Thomas there* 12. At the request of the Honourable, The Political Resident (vide his message of 25th March, Ho*297 - copy attached), H*M*8* ’•Lupin' left Khaeab at 0200 on 26th March and arrived off A1 Pujalra at about noon the same day* ^ 8***' was not in sight H.3.US. 'Lupin* anchored off Kalba in order to communicate with the Sheikh there and obtain any information* It was reported from shore that the dheikh was away but had been sent for and would oome on board next morning* n '* da to the Political ARont, Mueoat, asking when A1 3aid might be expected and a reply was received to the effect that 'A1 Said* was due at Dibah on 26th Maroh and Llmah on 27th March (vide 'Lupin*e signal 1235/26th and reply - copies attached)• 1 J 15. As it was then after dark, H.M.S. 'Lupin* remained after ^ Shoi*h had been off the next morning (27th March), and sailed for Llmah at about 1000. The Sheikh reported that Sheikh Haeean was at Dibah. 16* 'Al Said' wae sighted lying off Dibah and 'Lupin therefore proceeded there and anchored at about 1330* 17. On approaching the anchorage a party of about 100 men was seen moving along the beach towards the northern (Sheikh aleh , a) Port f with 6 or 8 men executing a eword dance in the van. 18. The Wasir Thomas, Said Malik bin Pal eel Highness The Sultan, and Sheikh Zubalr bin All, 'A1 Said' but no Levies (vide para. 3 above)* - cousin of Hie were on board 19. The Waslr Thomas had interviewed Sheikh Saleh on board 'A1 Said' on the previous day. Sheikh Saleh said thpt Sheikh Hasson was at Dibah but was returning to Khasab immediately and the Waslr Thomas did not eee him*3 20* The Vazir Thomas intended visiting Kumear and then J:Iha8ab a and •Lupin* therefore left 2)ib«h at 2200 on 27th March and arrlred at Khaeab at 0700 on 28th March* Sheikh Haeaan had not returned to Khaeab* 21* 'A1 Said* arrived at Khaeab on 29th March t and letter* were eent by the Waair to Sheikh Kaeaan requesting him to return to Khasab to meet the Waair* As the whereabouts of the Sheikh are uncertain, a reply is not expected before 2nd April at the earliest* 22* On the evening of 29th March, H*M*S* w Lupin* with the Wazir on board proceeded to Dabai, arriving there on 30th Maroh* The Wasir interviewed the Residency Agent there and Am S* *Lupin* with the Wazir on board returned to Khasab ths same evening* 23* The fundaMntal cause of the trouble at Khaeab eeems to be the fear of foreign penetration and a secret pact has bean formed the tribes to resist It* 24* Shaikh Saleh of Dlbah and Sheikh Has Ran of Khasab, who, it is understood, are the paramount Sheikhs of the two sections of the Shlhuh tribes, are both members of the pact, and these two appear to be equally responsible for the incidents at Khasab* 25* The enmity to the Wall of Khasab and the Government of Muscat is apparently due to the fact that Muscat has given concessions for W/T Stations, etc., and is generally under British influence, and gave permission to the British to land at Khasab* 26* A report on the situation by the Wazir Thomas has been forwarded to the Honourable, The Political Resident, by the fast mail steamer due at Buahire on 2nd April* 27. As regards Para. 2 of section VI of the Waslr v e report (Present Situation), it is considered that a landing of Musoat Levies could, in any oase, achieve little more than the holding of the Port now occupied by the Wall, and could not bring sufficient pressure to boar on the Sheikh to induce him to surrender himself or to pay any considerable fine* 28. Ae regards blockade, it ie understood that Khasab ie not dependent on its sea communications and could be supplied by land, and that the effeotlvenees of a blockade would probably be dependent on the oo-operatlon of the Trucial Sheikhs* 29* It would therefore seem necessary to be prepared to take some much more immediate and effective action in the event of the threat of a blockade falling to produce the desired result, such ae the destruction or seizure of dhows and boats at Khasab and its dependent villages, or bombardment (after due notice) of the town* 30. This question, however, will be further investigated in conjunction with the Wazir Thomas* 31* It is understood that the Museat Government have neither the will, nor the ability, to restore their authority over/- 4 over these tribes, but it seems very necessary, in order to uphold British prestige throughout the Gulf, that some effective action should be taken. Great interest in these events is being shown on the Trucial Coast, and exaggerated rumours of the number of British ships concentrated at Khasab, etc., are current there (vide w Lupin , s M signal 2019/24th March - copy attached). 32.

In the case of Little Farur, this admission (though, so far as we know, it has not hitherto been formally made by His Majesty's Government) is of no special importance, as we do in fact recognise the island as Persian, and are not proposing to turn its status to any bargaining advantage. In the case of Sirri the position is rather different. It is indeed tne fact that the island has been occupied by Persian troops for over dO years. But His Majesty's government have consistently refused in any way to recogiise a Persian t/itle to the island, and in the course of our present negotiations we are proposing to give a good title to Sirri only in return for-the withdrawal of Persian claims to Tarnb, Little Tarnb and Abu Musa, cannot help feeling, in these circumstances, that Clive’s 'emm reference to it as a Persian island, unqualified by any such phrase as A Sr)**M*Al*r ' de facto”, prove ^embarrassing in qp 1 nte-i*-sta ^ 1 e in the r\ it ls~&lt;U negnti-^tion-s, especially as Taimourtache has not shown any special disposition to be amenable o; this point hithertoyf -7o approe^ite thatr-i L woulJ'be difficulL St ti^ls stage to take any effective steps to remove the impression which may have been o^de-p tot we suggest that you nay think it worth bringing the point to Clive ! s notice. m opportunity^might be afforded by the communication which will probably have to be made ''see Tehran telegram ho. 364 of the 1st December) once the Senior haval IAZm/ Officer's programme is received.

The text of the correspondence between the Minister of Court and Sir Robert Clive is contained in Tehran despatch of 10th November, No. 555, on P. 7628/29 below. It would hardly be worth submitting were it not for the fact that the Minister, in his note, has definitely referred to Sirri and to Little Farur as Persian islands. In the case of Little Farur, while there has never hitherto been any formal recognition of Persian ownership, the attitude of His Majesty's Government has been that it must be regarded as depending from Farur, which is, in our view, undoubtedly Persian. This is the first formal reference to its Persian character in an official communication to the Persian Government.As regards Sirri, while Persia has occupied the island since 1887, the Jowasimi Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast have never abandoned their claim to it, nor has Persian ownership ever formally been recognised by His Majesty’s Government. The discussions as regards disputed islands in the Gulf in the present treaty negotiations are proceeding on the basis of Persian withdrawal of claims to Tamo, Little Tamb ana Abu • • • • Musa in return for recognition of their title to Sirri. It was no doubt difficult for Sir Robert Clive in the present case to avoid reference to the status quo in Sirri, but it is possible that the formal admission in his note that the island is Persianmay at a later stage be used against us.

'Ormonde'. I now write on a very small point of detail arising out of paragraph 5 of those instructions, to say that, while it is true that we not admit that either Tamb, Little Tamb or Abu Musa i-eiand» are under Persian sovereignty, the Persian Government take a different view. As regards Little Farur, as stated in the India Office memorandum on page 105 of P.G. 13, while its status is not formally determined, the view has been held that, on the analogy of Little Tamb, it must be regarded as depending from Farur,^ which is admittedly Persian. And I think that we had representations from — 3 . Persia about a year ago consequent Cv. U e lL on the landing^without permission, of a shooting party from one of the sloops. The point is a very small one, but you may think it worth while to make the position clear to H.M.S. 'Ormonde'. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baxter at ,the Fore 1^1 Office. 4. G.

VCiole area to be surveyed lies outside territorial waters of Persian mainland, and except north of Farur by a considerable distance. It includes waters around Tsmb, Little Tamb, Farur, and southern coast of Kais; and it might prove necessaiy to erect temporary beacons for purposes of triangulation on Little Tomb, Sirri, Abu Musa, end Little Farur, though Little Tamb only lies within the area. If survey is to be made this season ship should leave England on November 15th. She- would use Hen Jam as her base, but no landings would be made on mainland of Persia and landings on islands would be limited as much as possible. Admiralty do not wish to press matter strongly, but early survey would be of great utility to shipping generally and is desirable if no strong objection is seen on political grounds. to Shaft-el-Arab, it is proposed to send H.M.S.'Ormonde' Indio/India Office are consulting Resident at Busnire, who will repeat his observations to you, regarding pos sible reactions on local Arabs of the proposed survey.
