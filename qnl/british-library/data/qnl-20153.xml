Early opportunity should be taken by Colonel Kemball of warning him once more that the good offices of His Majesty 1 s Government can only be extended to him if he refrains from aggression and is guided by their advice.

I have heard on good authority that the Sharnmar and Aniza trj/bes, long hereditary enemies, have lately 'becoine reconciled and are moving in large numbers ( lOOOO Aniza and 6000 Sharamar ) in the direction of Basrah on the west side of the Euphrates. The Turks having failed to catch Sadoon (lately in revolt) with their own troops under Muhammad Pasha, may have 'bribed or incited these two tribes to destroy him and his following. At the same time more Turkish troops have 'been sent from here in the direction of Basrah and it may 'be that the ultimate object of the combined movement is towards Koweit. I have informed His Majesty^ Ambassador at Cons tantinople of this news. Muhammad Pasha who went in pursuit of Sadoon has been recalled and is in disgrace here. It is said \ that he is related to Sadoon by marriage (I believe this is true) and therefore did not seriously try to catch him. Muhammad Pasha is the best Officer the Turks have got in these parts.

We have recently addressed the Secretary of State and recommended that the Sheikh should be support- ed in establishing a post on the lorthern shore of Bubiyan Island, to balance the Turkish posts at Urn Kasr and A1 Geit. If this suggestion meets with approval, it may be necessary to subsidise the Sheikh to enable him to maintain the requisite posts. But His Excellency considersv oonsiders that tmtil we know what action is likely to be taken in this matter, and until we have made more definite arrangements about the post office at Koweit, it will be best to let the question of the grant of a subsidy or a title stand over.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship a copy of an interesting Memorandum respecting the rival Emirs Ibn Reshid andlbn Saoud, who are now disputing for power in Central Arabia, which has been prepared by Mr. Biech from recent books on that country and the archives of His Majesty's Embassy. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Blech. THE Wahh^bi Empire owes its^name and itsraison d'etre to the reformer Mohammed- ibn-Abd-el-Wahhab. Born in 1691 at Horeimle, of the Mesalikh clan, which still frequents the neighbourhood of Zobeir and the north-west of the Persian Gulf, on arriving at the age of manhood he devoted himself to the task of purifying Islam from the errors and laxity of faith and practice which had crept in in the course of time. The intercession of prophet or saint, the use of the rosary, jewels, silk, and tobacco are among the special abominations of the Wahhabi sect. The reformer's preachings met at first with slight success, and it was essential for him to be supported by the secular arm. He found protection with Ibn Maammer, Ruler of Eyana, then the first city in Nejd. Ibn Muflik, the supreme Governor at Katif, when informed of the reformer's proceedings, ordered Ibn Maammer to put a stop to bis preaching and arrest him. But Ibn Maammer contented himself with driving out Mohammed, who then took refuge at Dereia, not far from Eyana, at the castle of Saoud, son of Abdul Aziz, of the Aneza clan. Saoud espoused his cause with vigour, and eventually made himself master of the whole of Southern Nejd, conquering also Kaslm, Hasa, Dow^sir and Seleyyel. He reigned nearly fifty years, and before he died his authority was recognized from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the frontiers of Mecca; but he respected the supremacy of Persia in Bahrein and its Protectorate in Katif. On his death-bed he called before him his two eldest sons, Abdul Aziz and Abdullah, of whom he named the first his successor and gave the second an honourable position in the Government. This was about 1800. Abdul Aziz at once turned his arms against the East, stormed Katif with great slaughter, occupied Bahrein and the adjacent islands, and lastly attacked Oman, where the Sultan Said of Muscat consented to pay an annual tribute, admitted a Wahhabi garrison, and allowed reformed mosques to be erected. In revenge for these attacks on the Shia Moslems, a Persian zealot assassinated Abdul Aziz in the mosque at Dereia about 1805-6. Abdallah succeeded him (the younger brother, fCbalid, and Abdul Aziz's son Teneyan had no share in the power. Meshari, Khalid's son, eventually assassinated Turki). Abdallah at once fitted out an expedition against the Persians; encountering Koweit on his way, he threatened to absorb it, but a seasonable submission and large presents bought him off. At Meshhed Ali he was defeated with considerable loss, but marched on to Kerbela, where he perpetrated a general massacre of the population and brought away much treasure. Next he turned westward, and took possession of Mecca, where he also massacred and plundered ; next, Medina fell before him, and both the Holy Cities were stripped of their ornaments and reduced to a condition more in harmony with Wahhabi asceticism. He was now master of the entire peninsula, save a corner of Yemen and Hadramaut. The north next felt his sword, and from Kerak to Palmyra he ravaged, burnt and slaughtered ; a revolt broke out in the south of Aared at Hoota; this was mercilessly stamped out. Turkey now felt it time to put a stop to these encroachments. Mehemed Ali was ordered to expel the Wahhabi from the Holy Cities and break his power, and the task was intrusted to Ibrahim Pasha. Ibrahim Pasha [1986 gg —1] B2 ' rolled up the carpet' until he met and routed Abdullah at Koreyn : the Emir fled and entrenched himself at Dereia, where he withstood a siege of twenty days, fhen, how ever, a bombardment was successful; Abdullah was taken prisoner and sent to Constan tinople, where be was executed in 1818; few of his family escaped saye Turki, his eldest son. For some time Egyptian rule was maintained in the Nejd; but the cruelty of Khalid Pasha, the Egyptian Deputy-Governor, induced the oppressed Arabs to send messengers to Turki calling on him to head them : his arrival was the signal for a general v rising. From Kasim to the shores of the Persian Gulf all was in a blaze. The garrisons of Hasa, Yemama, and Harik were overpowered and massacred. Khalid fled and Furki was proclaimed Sultan of Nejd and restorer of the Wahhabi Empire. He selected Riad as his capital. All the central provinces acknowledged his sway, but Kasim still held to Egypt, while Hasa and Katif had reverted to the ancient Chiefs who of old held sway there, and Oman had returned to her own Sovereign, Said-ibn-Said. Mehemet Ah now sent an array under Hussein Pasha againsi Turki, who fled before him, and the Egyptians led astray hy Arab guides perished in the sands of the desert. J urki then returned and engaged himself in reconstructing his father's kingdom, ruined by the Egyptian domination, and in recovering one after another the provinces formerly subject to Wahhabi domination. About 1830 Turki dispatched an expedition to conquer Hasa. Not desiring to leave his capital, Riad, he placed his army under the command ot his eldest son Feisal. But hardly had the Wahh^bi army entered Hasa and begun the siege of Hofoof when news reached them that Turki had been murdered in the mosque at Riad by hi« cousin Meshari, and that the latter had at once usurped the throne. Feisal marched his army back to Riad, and was received with accliamation ; but Meshari entrenched himself in the Palace, and was captured and killed only after a sie^e of some weeks' duration. When he was proclaimed Sultan Feisal applied himself to restore order in the central provinces, where all had been thrown into confusion by the death of Turki and the usurpation of Meshari. He had not time to do more when a considerable Egyptian force under Khourshid Pasha was sent against him. Kasim had throughout remained in the hands of the Egyptians and furnished them with a secure entrance into Wadi Hanifa. teisal had scarcely time to save himself by flight; several of the Royal family were taken prisoners and sent back to Egypt; Khourshid Pasha established Khalid-bin-Saoud, the grandson, not of Abdul Aziz but of one of his brothers, on the throne of Nejd, and he himself returned to Kasim. Feisal meanwhile wandered to Mecca, Damascus, Jerusalem, and other places. After about two years he received information that Khalid was weary of his position as an Egyptian tool, and was ready to give up his precarious viceroyalty. On Feisal's appearance Khalid withdrew to Kas£m, and thence eventually to Egypt. He died peace fully at Mecca in 1861. Feisal meanwhile installed himself as Emir at Riad, but was not long left there ; he was suddenly attacked and seized by Khourshid Pasha, and sent off as a prisoner to Egypt, where, during the lifetime of the great Viceroy Mehemet Ali, he remained in close confinement. Meanwhile Ibn Teneyan, cousin ot Khalid, and grandson of Abdul Aziz-bin- Saoud, was established by Khourshid Pasha in the Vicegeiency of Nejd. He is described as having many good qualities. He repressed the Bedouins, especially the Meteyr and Oteyba, and subdued a revolt in the Wadi Dowasir; he also carried out many improvements at Riad itself. Later on he became tyrannical, and thus alienated the affections of his subjects. After he had reigned for about five years, Mehemet Ali ot Egypt died, and was succeeded by his grandson, Abbas Pasha, who allowed FeisaE to escape trbm his Egyptian prison. Feisal ensconced himself at Kosseir^ and there got into communication with his adherents in the Nejd. These sent him new and pressing messages to come. Feisal crossed from Kossier to Yambo, and passing into Kasim, was received with enthusiasnu Surrounded by an increasingly numerous army, he advanced towards Shakra, and sent messengers to Riad, summoning Ibn Teneyan to surrender the Crown. Jbn Teneyan was eager to resist, but met with no support. He entrenched himself in the castle. Feisal entered Riad, and offered his cousin life and liberty if he would surrender, but to no purpose. After about a month's seige, Ibn Teneyan lost courage and escaped secretly from the Palace, but was taken and put to death. Feisal was now sole lord of Central Arabia; but Hasa refused to recognize his authority, and Oman had long since freed itself from Wahhabi interference. The Ajman tribe on the north-east frontier revolted from his sway; not being himself a very capable warrior, and being, moreover, afflicted by ophthalmia, destined to turn into complete blindness, Feisal sent his son Abdullah in com mand of an expedition against them. It was completely successful. Two-thirds ot the jnales of the Ajman were destroyed, and the northern clans were reduced to complete■J v ;•&gt; &amp; 3 submission. The same fate attended the Meteir, Aneza, and Ateiba on the west. Hasa was next subdued after a fierce fight. In 1855-56 Feisal fitted a Wahhabi expedition at Katif for the conquest of Bahrein. It was not successful, but the Ruler of Bahrein is said to have consented to pay an annual tribute to Riad. It was about this time that the rivalry of the Ibn Reshid dynasty ot the Jebel Shammar began to be felt. That district had by this time become practically detached from the Nejd ; but Feisal long laboured to sow dissension among the people and even the members of the Royal family. Stone- blind in his later years, Fe'isal left the direction of affairs to his eldest son Abdullah, who, proud, immoral, treacherous, and cruel, but courageous and warlike, was described by Palgrave as the leader of the Orthodox partv, while the second son, Saoud, tall, slender, and handsome, was the hope of the ' Liberals.' w ■ r Abdullah-ibn-Feisai's character was never such as to win him much affection from the warlike, nomad tribes, who constitute the fighting power of the Nejd. In early man hood, when heir-apparent and practically regent tor his blind lather, he showed some energy and ability as a leader of raids, but what popularity he then enjo\ed was tar exceeded by that of his brother Saoud, the beau-ideal of an Arab prince handsome, reckless, frank, and open-handed. On their father, Feisal's death in 186 ), the inevitable contest began between the brothers for the Emirship. It lasted until 1870, when Abdullah, finally defeated, sought the aid of the hated, and, as the Wahhabis of Nejd hold, infidel Turks. The result was that a Turkish expedition under Midhat Pasha, Yah of Bagdad, proceeding from Bussorah by sea, occupied, with Abdullah's aid, the Haza district of the Nt jdean Principality. Abdullah, however, soon discovered that the purpose of the Turks was conquest, and that they had no intention of reinstating him as Lmir, but were using him as a tool to facilitate their enterprise. He therefore fled secretly from their camp, and the Turks, deprived of his aid and influence, did not venture to enter the dangerous desert of moving sand which separated tne Hasa oasis from r*ejd proper. Midhat Pasha nevertheless proclaimed himself conqueror of Nejd, and a sword of honour with the word ' Nejd ' studded in diamonds upon its scabbard was presented to hnn by Sultan Abdul Aziz. 'Nejd' was substituted for 'Hasa' as the Turkish official designation of the sandjak which the Turks have since precariously occupied. On that A occupation they, by a curious process of reasoning, base their claim to suzerainty oyer all the territories, Bahrein and Muscat included, which were at any time subject or tributary [ to the Wahhabi Emirs of Nejd. , • , After fleeing from the Turkish camp at Hasa in 1871» Abdullah lived quietly among such of the Bedouin tribes as were friendly to him. About 1874 Saoud led an attack on Areza and Boreida, when a conference took place between him and Ibn Reshid, the result bein^ that Saoud withdrew from those parts and Ibn Reshid also returned to Hail. In an unsuccessful attack on the Ateiba Arabs, Saoud lost 300 men and 200 brood mares— nearly all the Wahhabi stud. By the loss of these horses, says Doughty, the Wahhabi rule was weakened to death, never—such was the opinion in Nejd to rise again. Riad and its suburbs and the village country round about then (1878) alone remained or the Wahhabi dominion. Arab tradition alleges that, in his strife with Abdullah, baoud received aid from the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. About 1874 the Emir Saoud died when preparing to attack the Turks for the recoveey of Hasa, and Abdullah, after a short period, proceeded to Riad and was proclaimed Emir. The period of Abdullah's reign was generally peaceful, but marked by a steady decadence in the power and prestige of the Nejdean Principality. On the one hand, he made no attempt to expel the Turks from Hasa ; while on the other, Mohammed-ibn-Reshid, Chief of the Jebel Shammar, nominally his vassal, not only attained virtual independence but .gradually detached from the Nejdean Principality the rich districts ot Boreiaa and Bedeir which he governed through lieutenants, and from which he levied the tribute formerly paid to Riad. Abdullah's extreme corpulence,- which dated from before his second accession, prevented his leading the Nejdean forces in person, and his jealous and distrustful disposition caused him rather to submit to encroachments than to intrust the command to any one else. In 1884 popular discontent obliged him to come to an arrangement with Mohammed-ibn-Saoud, his nephew, whereby all military matters were confided to the letter, while Abdullah retained the civil government. Mohammed conducted some successful operations against Ibn Resbid, Dut on learning from intercepted letters that Abdullah was intriguing for his defeat, and murder he threw up the command and retired with his brother to Kharj; atter residing there tor some time he made a descent on Riad, about October 1887, and deposed his uncle Abdullah. His assumption ot power met with no opposition trom the people, as he had inherited his father's popularity, with, it was said, greater prudence and ability. He set about consoli dating his power and drawing to him the tribes which had fallen away.On hearing of this news Ifen Resbid at once dispatched a force to Sedeir and Boreida to prevent the people of those places from paying tribute to Mohammed-ibn-Saoud, who on his part, summoned Ibn Reshid to withdraw his lieutenants from there. Hostilities were impending, and it seemed likely that success would rest with Ibn Saoud, as the tribes and towns of INejd had declared for him, and he had even sent messages to Hasa and Katif, hinting that that he would shortly march thither and drive out the Turks. But early in lb88, with the connivance of the Turkish authorities, Mohammed-ibn-Reshid invaded Nejd with so large a force, well-armed with breech-loaders and two mountain guns, that the people of Aarid regarded opposition as hopeless and remained passive. Ibn Reshid advanced to near Riad, within which Mohammed-ibn-Saoud remained on the defensive. Some trifling skirmishes took place. Terms were then arranged, Mohammed- ibn-Saoud and his brothers retired to Kharj; Abdullah-ibn-Feisal-ibn-Saoud was reinstated as Emir, but accompanied Mohammed-ibn-Ileshid to Jebel Shammer, leaving his brothers Abdurrahman and Mohammed as Regents at Hiad ; to assist them in the government Ibn Reshid appointed one of his own people, thus clinching the downfall of the Ibn Saoud dynasty. In the summer of 1888 Mobammed-ibn-Reshid sent a letter to Mohammed-ibn-Saoud, who with his three brothers. Sad, Abdul Aziz, and Abdullah, resided at Kharj, in Yemama, inviting him to come, or send one of his brothers, to Hail for friendlv conference. This was done to put the brothers off their guard, and shortly after dispatching the letter Ibn Reshid sent from Hail one of his Headmen, Ibn Sami, accompanied by eighteen horsemen, with orders to surprise and kill the four brothers. Before Ibn Sami reached Khaij, Mohammed-ibn-Saoud had sent an answer to Ibn Reshid's letter by his brother, Abdul Aziz. J On arriving at Kharj, Ibn Sami said that his partv were in pursuit of marauding Bedouins, and they were hospitably received. Learning that Mohammed-ibn-Saoud was at a village near the town, they proceeded thither and met Mohammed leaving the village, his mare being led behind him. Mohammed, suspecting no evil, let them approach. When they got near he saw that they were hostile and tried to mount his mare, but she would not let him. He then ran back to the village, and passing through it got upon the root of a small house in a garden. He was armed with a repeating-rifle and other weapons, and Ibn Reshid's men did not venture to follow him. After a time Ibn Sami promised him safety, and he descended and laid down his arms, when one of the party, a slave, shot him dead. Ibn Eeshid's men then returned to Kharj, and finding Abdullah- ibn-Saoud, killed him. Sad, the eldest brother, who was of weak intellect, fled to a Bedouin encampment, and obtaining a camel and food passed on to the desert. He was, however, captured and brought to Ibn Sami, who killed him. When Abdul Aziz-ibn-Saoud arrived at Hail with Mohammed's letter, the news of his brother s death had already reached there. He was disarmed and led before Ibn Heshid whom he vehemently urged to kill him at once. Ibn Reshid is said to have wept and sworn that he would treat him as a von and associate him in the government. He was, however, placed in confinement. Mohammed-ibn-Saoud was the modern Bayard of Arabia, and the fact that he could thus easily be deposed and put to death shows how great was the Ibn Reshid's power. Abdullah-ibn-Feisal-ibn-Saoud remained nominally the guest, though really the prisoner, of the Emir ot Hail, who, it was said, would claim from the Chiefs of Oman the tribute formerly paid by them to the Wahhabi Emirs. In July 1900 the tide seemed to have turned again, for Abdurrahman, son of Feisal-ibn-Turki, attacked Riad and made prisoner of Ibn Sabhan, the puppet Governor set up by Ibn Eeshid ; the latter's power was, however, by no means broken at that time though it was thought that if Abdurrahman really had the support of the clans it would prove difficult to reattach him to Jebel Shammar; his success was, however, but temporary, and he was driven into exile. He seems to be in receipt of a pension from the Turkish Government, payment of which vAas resumed in 1902. His son, Abdul Aziz, is reported to have captured Riad early in 1902, and since then the latter, his brother Mohammed, and his father (who is on friendly terms with the Sheikh of Koweit) have been collecting their forces. In November 1902, Abdul Aziz-ibn-Saoud defeated Ibn Reshid at Dillum (one day south of Riad) j the latter fled, losing 250 killed and all his baggage and camp. At the end of the year at attack by Ibn Reshid on Hiad was repulsed; and a similar result followed another attack in March or April 1903. in July 1903, Abdul Aziz-ibn-Saoud was collecting tribesmen at Riad to proceed against Boreida, where ibn Reshid was said to be constructing a fort; the latter's force was then said to be too weak to resist an attack.in February 1904, Ibn Saoud defeated Hussein Jerad, a leading supporter and near relative of Ibn Reshid, at Faiz-el-Ussir, and destroyed his whole force comprising 300 men of Hail and 100 others. Since then Boreida and Aneza have been captured by Ibn Saoud. Ibn Reshid Dynasty. At the earliest period of the history of Central Arabia, the numerous and powerful tribe of Tai from the Yemen occupied the Jebel Shammar. About 500 a.d . occurred the celebrated conflict between the tribes of Nejd, headed by Kole'ib Wail, Chief of Taghleb, and the armies of Yemen, led by the Lakhmite Chiefs : the latter were overthrown, and the entire Nejd delivered from the Kahtanite yoke. In this war Tai, though of Yemenite origin, sided with the Nejdean clans of Rabia. Soon after these clans engaged in civil war, upon the treacherous murder of Koleib bv his kinsman Jessas. This caused many important changes in the relative position of the central tribes, and a large settlement of Beni Taghleb, Beni Ahs, and Howazin took place within the limits of Jebel Shammar, where the new settlers united with the elder inhabitants, or Beni Tai, and from this union sprang the tribe of Shammar still so-called. In the earlier years of Moslem rule we find this district still powerful and independent, resisting successfully all the efforts of the Ommiad Caliphs, whose armies were signally defeated at the entrance of these mountains during the reign of Merwan, towards the beginning of the eighth century. Their subsequent history remains for a lung time a blank. Some of the clan Shammar, notablv the Bedr, were still Christians when thev repulsed the Ommiad troops. Probably they all eventually professed Islam. But they atterwards relapsed into semi-barbarism, resumed Pagan forms of worship, and split up into small factions. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the province underwent the short-lived tyranny of the first Wahhabi Empire, and like other districts was but transiently affected by it. At this time Hail was already looked upon as in a manner the capital of Jebel Shammar, partly owing to its size and wealth, partly to its central position. Supreme rule was exercised in the family of Beit Ali, ancient denizens of the city. But one Abdallah-ibn-Reshid then lived in HaiL He was of the clan of laafer, the noblest branch of the Shammar tribe. Many of his relations were Bedouins, though his own direct ancestors had long been townsmen. Wealthy, high-born, and conscious of ability and vigour, he aspired to wrest the hitherto undisputed pre-eminence from the Chiefs of Beit Ali, and his numerous and powerful relatives lent their aid to his endeavour. In Hail itself Abdallah's party soon became the stronger, but the neighbouring village of Kefar, then almost as strong and populous as Hail, held to Beit Ali. The struggle then began, and was unfavourable to Abdallab, who was driven into exile about 1818 or 1820. Accompanied by a band of his relatives, he took the road of the J6f, and, failing to find assistance, passed on to Wadi Sirhan. Here, however, the fugitives were attacked by a strong party of Aneza Bedouins, the hereditary enemies of the Beni Shammar. After a desperate struggle all Abdallah's companions were slain, and he himself left for dead. Tradition ascribes his surviving to the miraculous aid of insects and birds, and to the assistance of a passing caravan, by whom Abdallah was taken on to Damascus, and tended until complete recovery. Returning then to Arabia, he received a ready welcome from Turki-ibn-Saoud, the Wahhabi Emir, and became one of his principal Generals. Practically the leader of the expedition sent c in 1831 against Hasa under Feisal, it was he who induced the Prince to march straight back upon Riad as soon as the news of Turki's murder and Meshari's usurpation reached the front. It was, moreover, \bdallah who, on the twenty-first day of the siege of the Palace of Riad, in which Meshari was entrenched, slipped out by night with two trusty kinsmen of the Shammar, induced a friendly Palace retainer to draw them up by ropes through one of the windows, penetrated to Meshari's sleeping apartment, and killed the usurper after a protracted struggle, in which Abdallah's two comrades lost their lives. In gratitude for these services, Feisal named him absolute Governor of Shammar Province—in Doughty's woids, to be his constable of the western marches of Nejd—to govern Aneza and its southern tribes, with right of succession, and supplied him with troops and all means for the establishment of his rule. Abdallah then returned to Hail, and driving out the rival family of Beit Ali, became supreme Ruler. His brother Obeid pursuid the fugitives into Kasim, and there ravaged the country, and cut off the Beit Ali root and branch. Meanwhile, Abdallali consolidated his power in the Jebel Shammar, beyond which, however, his sway did not extend. All his lifetime he paid tribute to Feisal, and, more- [1986 ^—11 Cover, caused the Wahhabi tenets to be recognized as the official faith of the State, in spite of the unpopularity of this measure, not apparently from religious conviction, but out ot policy. He died in 1844 or 1845, while engaged in rebuilding Hail, and left three sons, Tellal, Mitaab, and Mohammed besides his surviving brother, Obeid. Fellal s popu larity insured his succession, and he seems to have been a pattern ruler. Besides continuing his father's improvements at Hail, he sent his uncle, Obeid, on an expedition against Kheibar, which was conquered, and fell under the Shammar rule. ^ ot long after, Kasim, weary of Wahhabi tyranny, annexed itself to the Shammar Kingdom. Telal apologized to Feisal, who felt too weak to protest against this aggrandizem ent of his powerful vassal at his expense, and was obliged to acquiesce. Meanwhile, Tellal himself led a successful foray against Teima and the neighbour hood, and in 1855 conquered the J6f and destroyed the family of Beit Haboub, hitherto supreme there, Rverywhere he subjugated the Bedouins. By a wise tolerance he induced Shias and other heretics to settle at Hail, and suffered much relaxation of the strict Wabhabi doctrines, in spite of the protestations of Feisal, still nominally his overlord, and one of whose daughters was married to him. He had also to preserve appearances with the Sultan, whose name looms large in the Friday prayers at &gt;!ail, but who derives no other benefit from the province. Tellal still preserved the appearance of being a vassal of Ibn Saoud, and repaired every year to Riad with a present of horses. Returning in 1867 he fell sick, and sent eventually to Bagdad for a Persian doctor, who told tVie Emir that his understanding would become affected bv his malady.- ' Mad ! and I the Emir,' ejaculated Tellal, and ; as Doughty says, u because his high heart might not longer endure to live in the common pity, he set his pistols against his manly breast and fired them and ended.' He was succeeded bv his brother Metaab, a mild-mannered and intellisrent man, who, however, after two years was assassinated by Tellal's two sons. Bandar and Bedr, ot whom the former succeeded him. Meanwhile Mohairmed, brother of Tellal and uncle of Bandar, fled to Riad. Here Abdullah-ibn-Saoud brought about a reconciliation between him and Bandar, cind Mohammed at the latter's invitation returned and became again Governor ot the Bagdad Haj caravan. On one occasion when returning to Hail he sent before him to greet the Emir, Bandar. The latter, being displeased, refused him admittance to Hail and rode out with Bedr and Hamood to meet him, causing the town-gates to be shut behind them. A dispute arising Mohammed killed Bandar ; then entering the town, he and Hamood ordered the slaughter of all the children of Tellal, Mohammed'thus began his long reign which lasted till his death in 1897. In his time the Ibn Reshid dynasty reached its highest pitch of power. The homage to Ibn Saoud was gradually disused in the decay of the Wahhabi State, and in 1876 Ibn Reshed was the greatest Prince in Nejd. His was, according to Doughty, a ruling of factious Arabs by right of the sword : none of them, not persuaded by fear, would be his tributaries. The bloodshed attending his accession and the severity of his methods caused as much reprobation as terror among the Arabs, but all were obliged to admit that his^ rule w r as strong and successful. ' 1 think it would be hard to find a fault in Jbn Reshid s govern ment,' says Doughty in words which recall Palgrave's dithyrambic praise of Tellal. Mohammed-ibn-Reshid, early in his reign, endeavoured to withstand a Turkish expe dition against the Jof, in 1872; he was, however, defeated and glad to submit to terms, paying an annual tribute of 1,500 mejids for the Jof. and admitting a Kaimakam and garrison to reside there. Doubtless this impressed him with a great idea of lurkish power, for even when a: the height of his glory, and while humbling the Ibn Saoud house to the dust in 1888, he posed as the officer or Lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. To give figures is but misleading; however, Doughty, in a style more convincing of^ veracitv than Palgrave, says that Ibn Reshid (Mohammed) might summon 2,000 fighting men from his villages and about 1,300 nomad Arabs ; he is said to have 400 horses. His boundaries were: on the north the Roualla, northern Shammar and Thutfir, friendly but not tributary tribes; on the east his limits were at the dominion of Boreida, which includes a good many villages in the nefud of Kasim ; captured by Mohammed-ibn-Reshed in 1888, it has again passed into the hands of Ibn Sacud; in the south, his limits are at about 100 miles from Medina; his western boundary is the Syrian Haj road. In 1897 as already stated Mohammed died ; he was succeeded by his nephew Abdul Aziz -bin-Metaab. But so dependent is the pre-eminence of these principalities on the personal qualities of the ruler, that already the balance has inclined once more to the Ibn Saoud. Owing to cruelty, rapacity, and general maladministration Abdul Aziz-ibn- Reshid has so alienated the sympathies'of the Nejdis that many have left him for Ibn Saoud who is now, probably, as powerful as hiin&amp;elf, and some time ago was boasting that7 he would wrest Hai'l from him. Now that Ibn Saoud is pressing him hard, he has applied for assistance to the Turks ; and though access to the Nejd from the nprth-east is prover bially arduous. It is impossible to be free from apprehension that this appeal may be as disastrous in its consequences to the Nejd as was that of Abdullah-bin-Saoud in 1871. (Signed) E. C. BLECH.

Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople regardiogthe possibility of serious disturbances in the neighbourhood of Koweit.* It would appear from this despatch that the warning recently given by the Viceroy of India to Sbeikh Moubarak may not permanently deter him from aggressive action, and that the sincerity (5f his protestations of loyalty and friend ship on that occasion is open to doubt. I am accordingly to suggest, for Mr. Brodrick's consideration, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should, as on previous occasions, take an opportunity of informing Moubarak that the good offices of His Majesty's Government promised to him under the Koweit Agreement can be extended to him only if he is guided by their advice and refrains from, any aggressive action.

Consul Crow to Sir N. 0*Conor.{Received at Foreign Office, February s.) (No. 2. Confidential.) Bussorah, January 11, 1904. Sis, I have the honour to report that I proceeded to Koweit on the 'Lawrence ' with the Political Resident at Bushire, and arrived there on the 1st instant. # Sir N. O'Conor, No. 11, January , 1904.The ' Lawrence *'anchored about two miles from the town. We approached the shore in the launch until we grounded, and then landed in a small boat and clambered up the steep side of one of the stone breakwaters facing the Sheikh's house. Moubarak, accompanied by the members of his household, met us on the foreshore. The Sheikh occupies a large two-storeyed stone build ing, built on the seashore, with a row of open stables in front of it. ^ Saddle horses were awaiting us, and the Sheikh conducted us to his ' Diwaniye ' or reception room on the roof of the house, furnished in European fashion with the portraits of Their Majesties the King and Queen, and that of Her Majesty the late Queen, on the walls. The Sheikh was attended by his Secretary. He is over 60, but looks much younger. He wore Arab dress—the long print over all reaching to his feet, the brown 'aba ' or cloak and a cotton handkerchief over his head, fastened by the &lt;c ugal' or camel's hair band wrapped round it. He carries himself well, and has a pleasant, intelligent face, and is reserved and discreet in his remarks. After some conversation we visited the town and bazaars with him, and then returned to the ship. Moubarak informed us that Sadun Pasha was near Behara, a place in his territory about 36 miles from Koweit. He had a small following with him. The Sheikh deprecated hi s turbulent behaviour, and thought no good could come of his violent opposition to Turkish authority. Sadun's sole object was plunder. He was misguided and had little influence. He had solicited protec tion, but Moubarak stated that he had been unable to give him a satisfactory answer. He considered it unlikely that the Turks would press the pursuit. He hinted that Seyyid lalib Pasha was trying to make capital out of the agitation by acting as intermediary between Sadun and the Turks. He expressed his contempt for Turkish methods of pacification and their inability to preserve order among the Arabs. The Vali, he said, had not written to him about Sadun. In reply to inquiries in regard to the Wahabee movement, he confirmed my information that Abdul Aziz ibn Saoud had captured Zalfee (36 hours from Boreyda), and added that the latter was now practically master of Nejd, and would make short work of Kassim and Aneyza. The Amir's power was completely broken, and his position irretrievable. There was great scarcity in Nejd owing to the failure of the harvest. Caravans between Koweit and the interior, principally Ateyba, were on the increase. Moubarak, though generally cautious and discreet in expressing his opinions, seemed inclined to exaggerate the extent of the Wahabee successes and the decadence of the Amir's authority. The wish is no doubt father to the thought. It is difficult to believe that the latter's position is as hopeless as he would lead us to suppose. The Sheikh stated that arms are freely imported from the El Katr peninsula to the interior, and that Turkish opposition to the traffic is purely nominal. He expressed his gratification at the settlement of the dispute with his nephews in regard to the Sabah family estates in Turkey. He regarded the matter as finished, and anticipated no hitch in the process of measuring the properties and assessing their value. 1 informed him that I was willing to assist him in smoothing over any difficulties which might arise in executing the Agreement, and assured him that he might rely on the good offices of the Consulate at Bussorah in the matter. The Sheikh complained of no further interference with the cultivation of his gardens at Eao. By the Agreement concluded between him and his nephews last September, the Sheikh's own estates in Turkish territory now consist of 3,000 jereebs (3,750 acres) of date gardens at Eao, and 300 jereebs (375 acres) at Dowasir. 1 am informed at Bussorah that the best date-bearing ground is worth 300Z. per acre, so that much of this property must be exceedingly valuable. Erom information collected by Colonel Pelly, Political Resident at Bushirein 1863, the Sabah family established themselves as rulers at Koweit in the early- part of the 17th century (1613). They were the pirates of the north of the Persian Gulf and low r er channels of the Shatt el Arab, and dwelt atUm Kasr, at the bead of the Khor Abdullah. About the year 1613 the Bussorah authorities 400242 attacked and expelled them. The original Sheikh came down the Khor Sohieh, between Bubian Island and the mainlandj with his followers, ^.nd settled in the bay known as that of Koweit or Grane. Crossing the bay he settled on its southern shore, and there erected a small fort or 44 kut,' of which the word Koweit is the diminutive. The term Grane or Kurn is rather applied to the shore line of the entire bay, from its resemblance to the curve formed by two horns. The Settlement was subsequently augmented by the son of the founder, who erected more buildings along the seashore as the population increased. The town is clean and active, and the bazaars extensive. A series of breakwaters and shallow docks made of rough-cut stone blocks stretches along the foreshore, which is entirely affected to boat-building. The sailors of Koweit are in high repute. Boat-building is their sole industry. Builders were ori ginally brought from Muscat, but the local workmen are now sufficiently skilled to work independently. Wood is imported from Malabar. The principal houses are of stone, and the population about 18,000. There is no vegetation nearer than Jehra, which lies about 15 miles away at the head of the bay. The Bedouins who flock to the town and camp on its ourskirts supply the 'population with provisions. Sheep and goats are imported from the Persian coast and Bahrein. Horses from the interior are no longer exported from Koweit, as this trade has been deflected to Bussorah. The water obtained from wells near the town is brackish, but fever is unknown. Colonel Pel!y reported in 1868 that, though nominally tributary to Turkey, they had for some years hoisted their own flag. It was found, however, that the custom duties, levied on their exports to Bombay, w^re more burdensome when goods sailed under an unrecognized flag, than when they were borne in Turkish craft. Koweit, shrinking from this foreign pressure;, turned to the Sultan. The suzerainty of the ports, whether old or recent, was merely nominal, the Arabs acknowledging the Turks as we do the 39 Articles, which all accept and none remember. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) T. E.

O'Conor,— (Received at loreign Office, February 20.) (No. 5. Confidential.) Basoa, January 25, 1904. Sir, In the course of an interview with the Vali to-day, I mentioned that I had recently visited Koweit and heard that Sadun Pasha was then near Jehra. I added that it was extremely unlikely that Sheikh Moubarak would give him any assistance or countenance his proceedings in any way. The Vali replied with some bitterness that the Sheikh's tolerating his presence at Jehra was already sufficient protection, for, as long as he remained there, Turkish troops could not touch him. He was as much out of reach at Jehra as he would be at Koweit ; and quite safe from interference. I asked his Excellency what he expected Moubarak to do in the matter, to which he replied, ' Ke might take him and hand him over to us.' 1 said I thought that would be rather a serious breach of the Arab laws of hospitality, 5 fx 4and might lead to a general rising of all the neighbouring tribes, out of sym pathy for Sadun. If his presence at Jehra meant freedom from molestation because he was on Koweit ground, it would clearly be impossible for Moubarak to so far depart from established Arab custom as to make him a prisoner and give him up. I remarked that I had heard Sadun had since quitted Jehra and gone further north, where it would doubtless be easy for them to catch him. The Yali said it was no easy matter to catch an Arab wandering in the desert, where Turkish troops could not follow him. Moreover, Seyyed Talib Pasha, acting on instructions from the Porte, bad been sent to interview him and had found him at Jebel Sinam. Sadun had asked for the Imperial pardon. His Excellency informed me that, when the trouble first began, he antici pated Sadun's departure in the direction of Koweit, and had asked the Porte for instructions as to how he should act in the event of his proceeding there. The Porte merely inquired what grounds he had for supposing he would do so, but gave him no indication as to the course he should pursue. Any attempt to corner Sadun would merely force him to return to Jehra, where they could not follow him. It is evident that the Turks have no intention of burning their fingers by following Sadun into Koweit territory, and it is also clear, from the Vali's statements, that he considers Moubarak is conniving at his escape by allowing him to visit Jehra. The matter will probably end by a full pardon being grant ed to Sadun, and his settling at Sahhra, near Nasrieh, while the blame for the slaughter of the Turkish troops will be laid at the door of the Bimbashi and others, who have already paid the penalty for their imprudence with their lives. If, however, this should not be the case and Sadun returns again to Jehra, his presence there will be a standing irritation to the Turks, and may bring Koweit into undesirable prominence. Moubarak is ' between the Devil and the deep sea.' 5 If he delivers up Sadun to please the Turks, he offends Arab sus ceptibilities seriously, and if he leaves him undisturbed at Jehra, the Turks may, with reason, grumble at Koweit's being used as an asylum by the Sultan's enemies.

Sir, I have received your Excellency's despatch No. 77 of February 8th, rela tive to a request made by the Amir of Nejd that the Turkish Government should permit him to attack Sheikh Moubarak of Koweit. I observe that you do not apprehend that the Turkish Government will give any encouragement to the Amir, and the information obtained by your Excellency is perhaps not of a character which would justify a special repre sentation. At the same time your Excellency will recollect that a distinct under standing was arrived at in October 1901, during a time of serious inter-tribal disturbances in the interior of Arabia, that if His Majesty's Government used their influence to discourage Sheikh Moubarak from aggressive measures, the Turkish Government would on their side endeavour to restrain the Amir of Nejd. It would seem advisable therefore that you should take a suitable oppor tunity of reminding the Turkish Government of this understanding, and should intimate that as His Majesty's Government have recently given repeated warning to the Sheikh of Koweit against participating in any insurrectionary movement, they have a right to expect that the Turkish Government will use their best endeavours to restrain the Amir of Nejd from embarking on a course ! of action which might endanger the peace in those regions.

Sir N. 0* Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—[Received February 15.) (No. 73.) My Loed, Constantinople, February 8,1904. In my despatches Nos. 11 and 39 of the 11th and 26th ultimo respectively, I had the honour to transmit Reports by His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah as to the rupture between Sadun Pasha and the Ottoman authorities. In the first despatch above mentioned, Mr. Crow represented the Ottoman Government as not unwilling to come to terms with Sadun, and at the date of the despatch of the inclosure in my despatch No. 39 he reported that the military measures taken against him were of no very drastic character. From a telegram from His Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad, dated tl e llth January, and inclosed also in my despatch No. 11 of the 11th January, it would seem that the Ottoman authorities, while not undertaking any serious punitive action against the Mountefik partisans of Sadun with the regular troops at their disposal, had succeeded in inciting against him the powerful tribes of the Shammer and Aniza, and that a large combined force of these tribesmen was moving against Sadun. On the Srd February Mr. Crow informed me by telegraph that Sadun had applied to him for advice as to making terms and coming in to ^ Bussorah. In the latter case he asked for a guarantee of safety from the British Consulate. Mr. Crow proposed to inform him that the Consulate could not interfere or help him, and to advise him to surrender at discretion and trust the Sultan's clemency. As, however, this language might, under certain eventualities, have entailed undesirable responsbility, I thought it better to instruct Mr. Crow to confine himself to advising Sadun that he could not interfere, and that his best course would probably be to make terms with the Turks.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship the translation of a telegram, dated the 7th ultimo, which I have obtained confidentially, addressed by the Amir Abul Aziz-ibn-Reshid to the Grand Vizier, repeating his request for the authorization of the Imperial Government to attack the Sheikh Mubarak, of Koweit, on the ground that he has attacked and plundered his country, and that he is the tool of the English. I understand that no answer has so far been returned to Ibn Eeshid, and I feel pretty confident that the Sultan will hesitate to encourage any action which is likely to encourage further disturbances in districts which are already very troubled.Negotiations appear to be on foot between the Sbeikh Abdul Houda and the Imam, which it is hoped may result in a satisfactory understanding. At the same time the Sultan cannot view without anxiety the existing situation of affairs. The tribes of the Hedjaz are restless, a large section of the Mountefik is, or has beea recently, in open revolt, and the Mutessarif of Nejd has apparently been compelled to retire from El Hasa on account of the opposition he has created among the local sheikh8 3 as shown by the telegram No. 2 here with inclosed.

January T, 1904, « » * « * « W e have already explained, by means of the special emissaries charged with presenting our humble offerings to His Imperial Majesty, that we have never incited or invited the relatives or dependants of Mubarak-es-Sebah to take refuge with us. As regards the relations of these people to us, to whom [else] should they resort for protection ? For, as we are the faithful subjects of His Majesty, our friends and the friends of the Caliph are the same. Mubarak Pasha not only did not assent to our proposals and prayers for the restitution of their property and belongings to these unfortunate people, but he has dared to attack our men and slay and plunder them. This diminishes our power and injuriously affects our honour and prestige amongst the tribes. Whereas we are still in a position to punish him (Mubarak), and to arrest him and hand him over alive to the Imperial Government, but we have been com pelled to defer energetic action pending the Imperial orders of the Commander of the Faithful. As for him, he has recently given proof of his relations with and subjection to the English. In fact, we have ascertained beyond doubt that he has been scheming to conclude a Treaty with them, and it is certain that cannon and munitions will be given to him by England and introduced into the country. It is right that the Government should be aware of the difficulties and troubles to which this will give rise in these parts. Our object being to secure peace and tranquillity, to protect the pilgrim route, to prove our fidelity to His Imperial Majesty, and protect our power and prestige from diminution, while he is stirring up much trouble and sedition in these countries—and especially in Nejd and its neighbourhood—and as it is our duty to defend the land of the Kaaba of our worship from sedition and revolt, I beg your Highness to inform me, as soon as may be possible, what steps the Imperial Government decided to take in this matter. Inclosure 2 in No. 2. Sheikhs and Notables of the Nejd Sandjak to the Grand Vizier, (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) January 87,1904. THE proceedings of the Mutessarif Mohammad Talib Pasha are not only reducing the sandjak to ruin, but will bring the greatest trouble upon the State, which is even now beginning to make itself evident. As has happened in the Mountefik, so in this district also, not only the nomad tribes, but the settled ray ah population also, is ready to rise and seek other abiding-places, for pillage, murder, and outrage have come to be the normal state of affairs. 12Was it for this that the Imperial Government, to please Abdul Huda Effendi, handed over a faithful population, with all its lands and property, to Talib Pasha ? In spite of the numerous telegrams which we have sent to the First Secretary and to other high authorities, no order has yet come to take from the Mutessarif and restore to us our plundered property. Every one is mourning the blood of his kinsmen, and no one is sure of his life or property. If this time again our complaints meet with no attention, 50,000 people, with their families, are ready to rise and seek the protection of a foreign State, in order to free ourselves from the oppressions and extortions of which we are become the victims.

This action, it taken, as is prohahle, with the connivance o£ the Sheikh of Koweit, is of a piece with the reports of the latter's intrigues, to which i have called attention on several occasions. I am afraid we shall find the Ottoman Government very unwilling to make any concession in regard to Bubian Island so long as they are imbued with the idea that Sheikh Mubarek is abetting Bin Saoud in his depredations upon he territory of Ibn-bin-Reshid, of Nejd.

It is affirmed that Bin Jerad was killed, with 4u0 of his followers, and that his flag was sent to Koweit, and that Abdul Aziz, on his return, met 150 camels, with 1,000 reals, and captured them. It is also announced that Abdul Aziz now proposes to attack Nassim and Bony da, in the Amiri territory. If this is correct, the Wahabee party at Riad will be considerably strength ened ; but it is possible that the success of the operations may have been pur posely exaggerated by the Sheikh of Koweit, who supxjorts .Abdul Aziz-bm* Saoud in his campaign against the Amir.

The understanding arrived at with the Turkish Government in October 1901 provided that the two Governments should use their best endeavours to prevent hostilities between the Amir of Nejd and the Sheikh of Koweit. No stipulation was made that either Government should exercise influence with the object of preventing hostilities between the Amir of Nejd and the Saood party. At the same time. His Majesty's Government have, on more than one occasion, in the hope of assisting to preserve peace in that portion of Arabia, employed special efforts to dissuade the Sheikh of Koweit from taking part, even indirectly, in the hostilities which have broken out, and they have learned with regret that the Turkish Government, on their side, appear to contemplate giving active assistance to the Amir in this intertribal quarrel. Your Excellency will observe that the Resident at Bushire will repeat to the Sheikh of Koweit the advice to observe an attitude of strict neutrality. Having regard to the above circumstances, and also to the further information contained in the Viceroy's important telegram of the 9th instant, it is clearly desirable that Your Excellency should communicate this fact to the Porte, and should take the opportunity to repeat the advice which you were authorised to give in my despatch above mentioned, and to express the earnest hope of His Majesty's Government that no action will be taken by the Turkish Govern ment which, might add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia, the tranquillity of which is a matter of interest to His Majesty's Gov ernment as well as to that of the Sultan.

Major Newmarch states that he cannot learn whether Hail had been captured, but that Ibn Saoud was in its vicinity; he had certainly taken Aneyza. With reference to my telegram No. 77 of the 29th ultimo, I have received a telegram from Mr. Consul Crow, dated Bussorah, the 2nd May, stating that he is informed that the Turkish authorities will send on the Nejd expedition one battery of artillery and six battalions of infantry from the Bussorah and Baghdad Vilayets. Large numbers of camels have been seized by the Amir for transport, and contracts had been made for six months' supplies. Mr. Crow also hears that the Sheikh of Koweit is in constant communica tion with Ibn Saoud, and that the latter had taken Boreyda and Aneyza. He adds that the Sheikh may be obliged, by identity of interests, to lend assistance, or the support of his tribes may be withdrawn from him.

The victory of the Wahabis is con- iirmed from other sources, and it is already reported, though perhaps prema turely, that Boreida has fallen.

And the people of Aneyza who were with us sent men to their friends furtively to announce our coming And when it was the fourth hour of the night we bestirred ourselves and came to Aneyza. There, when the eighth hour was come, we halted our camels at Ijhamiye, near to the town, and we left the people of Kassim to watch tbe villages, and, God helping them, they entered the town and slew Feheya-es-Sebhan and his company who were with him, and surrounded the family of Yahiya and their servants and a few men of the company of Feheya in the castle. And after we had said the morning prayer we sent against them Abdullah Ibn Ijlevi, with him 100 men of the people of Riad to assist. And we marched against Majia, and, when we saw the horsemen, God lifted his hand from off them and helped us against them. And we broke them and slaughtered of them 370 men. Among them were Obeyd-al Ihmadar-Eashid. And God restored to us our kinsmen of the family of Saud, who were prisoners in their hands—Saud Bin Abdul [Aziz and Saud Bin Mohamed and Feysul Bin Saud. And, by Almighty God, but two Bedouins on our side were slain. Then we returned to the villages of our friends. And they had taken the castle and laid hands on the family of Yahia and those with them and slain them, and emptied the houses of the family of Bessam. Aod, by God, there went away with Majid but some fifteen camels and seven mares; and the rest of their army and their horses and their arms and their tents and their furniture we took as a spoil, by the help of God and with your assistance. And at this time all the people of Boreida have come over to us and the chief men of the people of the villages Kassim, all of them. And when they heard the news of our being in the neighbourhood, they who were in Ras and Mezmil fled, and we settled those places. And as for Majid, the last news concerning him is that we set Boreida on his right hand and fled without his equipment. And our intention, by the grace of God, is that we should speed to Borei da, if God wills.

S ir, I have the honour to state that news came here on the 13th instant that Bin Saud, having gathered a strong following of more than 5,000 men, attacked the towns of Kassim, Boreida and two others, and took them one after the other. In the meantime, having received assurances of co-operation from more than half the people of Aneyza, the chief town of Nejd, who are friendly inclined towards him. Bin Saud marched on Aneyza, and on the night cf the 5th Muharram 1321 (22nd March 1904) entered the town without meet ing any serious opposition. The Sheikh, or Governor, of the town appointed by Bin Rashid was shot by the order of Bin Saud, and the houses of four leading men of Aneyza, who are supporters of Bin Rashid, were plundered. It is said that one of the Bessams, who are notables of that town, was killed, and the others have con cealed themselves. Having established himself at Aneyza, Bin Saud wrote a letter to the Grand Shereef announcing his victories, and assuming the title 8of Amir of Nejd, and sent it through a special messenger. This messenger was intercepted at Medina, and was sent to Mecca under arrest. It is not known what treatment he received at Mecca, but it is rumoured that the Turkish Gov ernment is taking steps to send troops to Nejd to support Bin Eashid and re establish his authority, but I have been informed by a reliable person that Ahmed Ratib Pasha, the Vali of Hejaz, does not like Bin Eashid, and there fore he would be disinclined to act vigorously on his behalf.

As, however, he is accompanied 'by General Muhammad Pasha Daghestani, who, the Minister of War has informed the Military Attache of this Embassy, has 'been specially selected to deal with the fresh disturbances which have broken out, apparently in connection with Sadun Pasha and the Muntefik Arabs (see my despatch Ho. 722 of the 13th instant), it is probable that the efforts of the new Yali,whether Fahri Pasha or a permanent titulaire, will at first fce directed towards a thorough suppression of the revolting tribes. Muhammad Pasha Daghestani is the nephew of the celebrated Circassian Chief, Schamyl, who resisted the Rus sians so long in their conquest of the Caucasus. He was once in high favour at the Palace, 'but for many years past he has 'been exiled to Baghdad, where he is looked upon as the only fighting General in the Sixth Corps. In spite of the comparative failure of his action against Sadun Pasha last winter, as reported to you Lordship at the time, the Minister of War seems to think Huhammad Pasha an excellent man for the work for which he has 'been selected.

The fighting which 'began ahout the beginning of June has been between the tribesmen under Saihood and those under Ghadban, and, as was reported by■T) Mr. Crow in his despatoh Uo. 76 of HovemTier loth 1903 with reference to similar disturtanoes in the sane district, certain rice fields have T-een the lione of contention; only this time there has also heen a VUad fend. lies and ex aggeration have of course heen current and I have failed to get an approximate idea of the bloodshed in the skirmishes which have taken place in those marshes or of the result. The few hundreds of Turkish troops from Baghdad and from here appear to have taken no active part. According to the Vali the gunboat or revenue hoat 'Alus towards the end of June fired a blank volley as a signal or warning to Saihoods men to cease pursuing and slaughtering Ghadbans men. and. the signal being respected, much bloodshed was avoided. I imagine this to be in the main the true story | though it is still maintained by some that the fire of the n Alu8 w killed many men. The Vali told me some Persian flags were captured from Ghadban. As to Sadun Pasha the Hontefik the story appears to be that he disarmed 150 Turkish soldiers at some time to- wards the end of June somewhere between Hasriyeh or Souk us Shionkh and was subsequently routed and put to flight by Turkish troops. it aoes not seem from this story to be clear • that his movements had any connection with the Amara disturb- ft I ancee. The Vali and another Government official have inform- ft ed me that he never came near the scene of the disturbances or *had anything to do with them, 'but the Yali said something ahout him having reoently given trouble elsewhere# He is now I understand engaged in raids in his own Hontefik country near Uasriyeh and Souk us Shioukh.

Sir, With reference to ray telegram 17o. 44 of the 2nd and 47 of the 17th instant, I have the honour to report that several con fused and contradictory stories have reached here from Itejd respecting the recent encounters near Boreycia. The Turkish official telegram received on July 31st from00274 the Mushir at Baghdad said that on July 29th a telegram signed Itn Hashid had 'been sent from Medina announcing a decisive victory of himself and the Turkish troops, over Ihn Saoud on July 14th, On the same day, or perhaps a day or two sooner a short telegram to the same effect was received 'by friends of Ihn Eashid here also from Medina and also signed Ihn Hashid, The Sultan has ordered promotion and medals for his officers of the Ottoman array and medals for his soldiers. Still, con sidering especially the fact that no letter has 'been received here from Ihn Kashid, the story in the telegram is, so far as I can learn, not 'believed here. On the other hand from Ibn Saoud's side a succession of apparently exaggerated reports of victory over I'bn Rashid on July 14th, the first heing contained in a letter which reached Busrah on July 28th, have 'been received 'by I'bn Saoud's friends here. The truth I suspect to t&gt;e in the main what an emissary of the Sheikh of Koweit reported to me on the 17th instant as having come from Ibn Saoud to Koweit # It is as follows Both Tbn Saoud and I'bn Rashid fled and disappeared from the 'battle field at Bakhrie near BoreyC?a on July 14th, each having erroneously thought that his cause was lost. Many Turkish soldiers were killed and 200 of them and some guns were cap tured 'but a day or two later recaptured 'by Ibn Rashid's men. The two armies viz, Ibn Rashid and the Turks on one side and Ibn Saoud on the other, were on August 3rd facing each other00^75 at A1 Russ not far to the South West of Aneyza and Boreyda. I am informed that money (perhaps £T3 ,OCO) has 'been sent from the Government here to Tvledina for an expedition of Turk ish troops, said here to 'be six 'battalions, ahout to 'be sent or already sent thenoe to the assistance of Ihn Eashid.

One thing is that the Ttirkish troops have not start ed after all and it appears that the Turks are again making very friendly overtures to both Mobarek and bin Saood. Bin Saood is therefore due in few days' time to confer with Sheikh Mobarek and I shall probably see him, though in the present undecided state of affairs I can say nothing to him. There seems to be some hope of the release of Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Bedar and satisfactory negotiations have been proceeding with reference to the date gardens at j^'ao. In fact everything seems to be going on so well for our party that I am wondering when I am going to hear ofof disaster. I am told. Abdul Fahman 'bin Saood who is coming to con fer will not on any account proceed to Bussorah as invited but might perhaps proceed to Sefwan with a large following.

The Vice-Consul at Kerbala reports that the Redifs (Reserves) are being called out at Eerbala, Nejd, and Hillah, because the regular troops are goin^ to help Abdul Aziz, the Amir of Jabal, against Ibn Saoud. The Redifs of Nejd will be stationed in Kerbala, those of Kerbala in Hillah, and those of flillah in Nejd. He says this has caused great uneasiness among the people. It is stated at Baghdad that 25 battalions in all are going to join Abdul Aziz. • • * * *00289 48 rs Another rumour current here, perhaps also originated by my Russian Colleague, is that there are several English officers disguised as Arabs fighting for Ibn Saoud.

Therapia, 20th September 1904 Mr Lord, 'With reference to my despatch No. 720 of the 12th instant, reporting the despatch from Medina of Turkish soldiers to reinforce the troops with Ibn Eashid, I have the honour to report that the Minister of War has informed Colonel Maunsell that the previous force of four battalions, sent to assist the • ibu EaaMd. - A - mir * of Ne 3 d » having suffered defeat and the loss of the Colonel at Kassim, where it was now holding a defensive position, a relief force had to be despatched, consisting of three battalions, under Aarif Pasha, an energetic staff officer, who joined the Yemen corps two years ago. The Minister of War said he thought these troops must have now effected a junction with the other force at Kassim, and that the total strength of seven battalions would be quite sufficient to drive off Ibn Saoud's men. His Excellency enlarged to Colonel Maunsell on the great difficulties of the want of water and supplies along the route from Medina, and said that a column of 3,000 men was all that could be properly provided for, but that others might follow if required. He also mentioned that the Wahibis under Ibn Saoud were in possession of some old iron cannon dating from the time of Ibrahim Pasha's invasion of the Nejd from Egypt. I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have just received from His Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad, containing details of the alleged treacherous killing of the Turks in question by Ibn Rashid himself during the conflict with Ibn Saoud, but I have not yet been able to obtain any confirmation of this version of the affair at Kassim.

It is reported that the Vali has received a telegram from Osman Pasha, of Medina, to the following effect:— Ihn Rashid has killed the Meer Alai (Commander) of the troops sent to assist him against Ihn Saoud, because he refused to march the troops in front of Ibn Rashid's Arabs. Ibn Bashid then ordered Bimbashi Ramzan Agha (the second in command) to march the troops in advance of his Arabs, and during a fight with Ibn Saoud's Arabs Ibin Rashid's Arabs fired at the troops, killing 100 and wounding 90. Among the killed were Bimbashi Ramzan Agha, a Captain of Artillery, and 19 Zabats (Lieutenants). It is said that the Vali is doing his utmost to suppress this news. He admits that the Turks lost heavily in an engagement with Ibn Saoud, but states that Ibn Saoud was eventually defeated and had to beat a retreat. I have, etc., L. S.

Section 1. No. 1. Me. Townley to the MAiiquBss of Lansdowne , (Received 14th November). Constantinople, 8 th November 1904. (No. 862, Secret.) Mr Lord, I have the honour to transmit to Tour Lordship herewith copies of papers, which I have received from a secret source, containing information about the present state of affairs in Nejd. As Your Lordship is aware, there has been much fighting recently in that region between Ibn Saoud and Ibn Rashid, who both claim the title of Emir. The latter has recently been assisted by Turkish troops, and for some time past there have been conflicting rumours as to which side was victorious. Latterly a conviction has been gaining ground that Ibn Saoud has won the day, a surmise which is borne out by the accompanying documents, of the genuineness of which I have been able to assure myself by the corroborative evidence I have collected in various directions. Having heard rumours of a proposed movement of troops to the Yemen or Nejd, I asked the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I saw together on the 3rd instant, whether they could give me any informa tion as to the real destination of the troops, which I understood were being sent from Aleppo and other places to Arabia. I was not at that moment in possession of the inclosed papers, but I gathered from their somewhat lame answers that the projected expedition had some object which they were unwilling to communicate to me. The accompanying copy of a despatch from Colonel Maunsell, Military Attache to His Majesty's Embassy, reporting information acquired at the War Department, shows that the troops were destined for Central Arabia, to avenge a defeat suffered by Ibn Rashid and the Turkish troops at the hands of Ibn Saoud. The Minister of War further told Colonel Maunsell that preparations for the dispatch of the expedition were now suspended in consequence of a letter having been received from Ibn Saoud, presumably the accompanying letter from his father to the Acting Vali of Bussorah, asking for pardon and tendering his submission.50 It is possible also that the Turkish Government may have been influenced in coming to this decision by a report addressed to them, as I am informed by His Majesty's Consul at Jeddah, by Ahmed Ratib Pasha. Vali of the Hedjaz, in favour of Ibn Saoud, who is represented by His Excellency as being of the dynasty of the old rulers of Nejd, and that to take him into favour would do away for ever with disturbances in that country, since the large majority of the people side with him. 'Whatever may be the reason of the change in the plans of the Turkish Government, I think that they are well advised to hesitate before sending a strong military expedition composed of troops quite unfitted for the purpose to the heart of Arabia against a foe who would have all the natural advantages of the country on his side. The arms and ammunition to which allusion is made in Colonel Maunsell's despatch are to be forwarded by the Austrian Lloyd steamer ' Calynso,*' which has been chartered for the purpose by the Turkish Government. I have, etc., WALTER TOWNLEY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Fakhib. Pasha , Acting Vali of Bussorah, to the Grand Vizier. 8th (21st) October 1904. I regret to report that the rumours of Ibn Eashid's retirement to Hail are confirmed by the inclosed letter from Abdurrahman-ibn-Feisal, father of Abdul Aziz-el-Saoud, addressed to me »^ .Koweit, and apparently written at Koweit for Abdurrahman. Inclosure. I heard of your arrival at Bussorah as Acting Vali and of vour lovaltv, so I report the following :— My family has of old been known to be loyal to the State, and especially to the Commander of the Faithful. But certain intriguing officials, egged on by the tyrant Ibn Rashid, have calumniated us. As soon as I heard this, I telegraphed to the Palace and wrote to the Vali of Bussorah and the Commander of the Army Crops, and begged that a full account might be sent to the Sultan. Ibn Rashid and his following deceived the Government, and, contrary to all expectation, brought about the dispatch of troops. We refused at first to believe this. Subsequently, Ibn Rashid and the troops arrived near the village of Bekirie * Seeing this, all the inhabitants of Nejd and Kasim united and prepared for war, so as to prevent Ibn Rashid's tyrannical murder ous designs. Ibn Rashid attacked them. My son, Abdul Aziz, being there with his followers, prepared, retired from in front of the troops and urged the tribes to attack Ibn Rashid s band. Hereupon Ibn Rashid, seeing himself hard-pressed, fled to the troops, and in the ensuing encounter was defeated and routed. The soldiers lost 210 killed, and six guns fell into the hands of the people of Nejd. My son, Abdul Aziz, ordered the people to leave them at the village of Bekine(?) Thus this service proceeded from our affection and loyalty to the State. Abdul Aziz-el-Saoud constantly designed to communicate with the Commanders of the troops and ascertain their desires, and to telegraph to the Palace, but Ibn Rashid sent out men to apprehend him, and seized all the letters and telegrams. After the encounter, which was on the 29tli Rebiel Akhir, 1322, f we remained expectant. But Ibn Rashid would not rest, marched his following and the troops against the people of Kasim, and began to press them hard. On the 17th Rejeb, 1322, $ he was attacked, defeated, and routed, many of his following being killed, all his tents, stores, and other possessions taken, * Bl-Bukirieh, between Hail and Boreideh, about half way.^—(F. R. M atjnsell,) t 13th July 1901. + 27th September 1904.51 and it is unlikely that he will again make head. On this occasion also my son, Abdul Aziz, and our relatives prevented the Moslem population of Nejd from molesting the troops, but as they followed the same road as that which Ibn Eashid had taken, they did not rest in Kasim. I am convinced that their departure is due to the machinations of Ibn Eashid. Tor neither the Sovereign nor his Ministers would ever allow their subjects to be harassed. I beg that our tender of loyalty may be accepted as heretofore, and that my condition may be reported to His Majesty. I am ready to perform any service to the State, and guarantee on oath the security of the roads and pilgrims. I beg that my submission may be accepted, and that we may not be left in despair. Despair makes men commit any crime. I repeat my prayer, and beg that my pension, some months in arrear, may be paid. The big guns with the soldiers are now with the people of Nejd. They remain in my son's possession. I await your orders. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. The Geand Vizier to the Ministee of the Inteeior. 17th (30th) October 1904. The measures respecting the dispatch of troops to Kasim against Ibn Saoud have been concerted in communication with Eeizi Pasha. The following decisions have been sanctioned by His Majesty : — The dispatch of eight battalions from the 6th Ordou, one cavalry regiment four bottalions from Medina, besides from Syria and Adana, eight battalions of the best trained Eedifs, not to fall below 600 each; dispatch by the Abdul Kader of four battalions of Eedifs from the said Ordou, and from it also the requisite guns, as well as four Maxim mitrailleuses from the Selimie barracks at Constantinople, together with munitions; levy and embarkation of the troops from Adana as soon as such steamer arrives there, sufficiency of muni tions of war to be sent by a steamer to be chartered from the Lloyd Company, which will call at Adana, where eighty mules capable of conveying stores are to be prepared and embarked at Mersina; the troops and munitions to disembark at Beyrout, proceed to Syria, thence by Hedjaz Eailway to Maan, thence to Acre (? iVkaba), and so by special steamer to Yambo, whence they will march via Mecca and Medina to Kasim. The aforesaid has been communicated by the Minister of War, and the necessary orders have been given in haste, and you are hereby instructed to take such measures in accordance as fall within the scope of your Ministry. Inelosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Maunsell to Mr. Townley. Constantinople, 8th November 1904 (No. 68.) Sir, I have the honour to report that recently plans have been drawn up for sending reinforcements into Central Arabia to restore the prestige of the Turkish troops after the defeat by Ibn Saoud of Ibn Eashid's forces whom they were assisting. Eour battalions, two of Nizam and two of Eedif, were ordered to be ready to be start from Aleppo, embark at Alexandretta, thence to Damascus by Beyrout by the new Hedjaz Eailway to Maan by march route to Akaba, there embark for Yamboo, whence they could march to Medina and join the expeditionary force there for Kasim. Other troops were to be sent from Baghdad and Bussorah towards the Nejd, but no orders were actually sent to the 6th Corps head-quarters.52 I saw the Minister of War to-day, who told me that preparations for sending troops were now suspended, and that probably no expedition would be sent, as Ibn Saoud had sent a letter to the Sultan asking pardon and tender ing submission, so that the matter would be arranged amicably. No troops at all would be sent from the Baghdad side, but very likely four or, perhaps, six Aleppo battalions would be sent to Medina, but nothing bad been actually decided. The Minister told me that actually at the present time Ibn Bashid was shut up by Ibn Saoud's forces in the old fortress of Hail, his capital. The Chief of the staff and other officials confirmed the above information. The troops of the 6th or Baghdad Corps are still armed with the old Martini rifle, now much worn, and practically the same weapon as possessed by Ibn Saoud's men. It has now been decided to issue them the Mauser rifle like the rest of the army, and for this purpose 40,000 small-bore Mausers and also six batteries of the newer pattern of 7'5 centim, mountain guns, made in the arsenal here, have been packed up, and are awaiting shipment by an early steamer for Bussorah.
