Sir, reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s Confidential despatch Mo.O.T. 15(834/160/8) of the 25th March last, (*l&lt;\ relative to the project to start a spinning and weaving industry in the Hejaz with the help of Indian capital, I have the honour to report that this scheme recently took more definite shape with the arrival on the 17th July last by the s.s. Jehangir' of a quantity of material from India, whence it is said to have been shipped by one Khan Bahadur Sheikh All Baakza. By order of the Minister of Finance, the material was admitted early In August free of Customs duties and was forwarded to Dr. Moin-ud-Dln at Medina. It is stated to consist of 24 bales of cotton, 10 oases containing a total of 110 spindles and one case containing one hand-loom. 2. It is reported that Dr. Moin-ud-Din has already hired large premises in Medina in which to house his scheme, has engaged about 20 hands, both local subjects and Indians, and has had some eight dozen spindles made locally. He therefore awaits only the arrival of the consignment of material now on its way to enable him to commence work on the manufacture of Ihrams R , etc. I will endeavour to keep informed of the fortunes of this venture and will not fail to acquaint you of such developments as may come to my notice. 3. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the Government of India. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sgd) A.S. CALVERT.25569/1933. NO* u. l*-i* (159/160/2). 13th January| 19^3 Sir, oration, Ibn aa'fld underlined the poverty of the Hejaz in these hard tiaee and ite need for financial help from the Moslem brotherhood abroad. 2 m Since their return to India, five Nawabs of Hyderabad together with other leading men of the State have concerted a plaii for lending economic rather than financial aid. After a preliminary private exchange of views with the Indian Vice- Consul here, who interested himself in the matter and hilped them to shape their views, these gentlemen have addressed to Ibn Sa*dd an offer to establish a simple Industry, such as weaving, among the inhabitants of the Hejaz, They propose that a number of expert weavers and spinners be sent from India in the first place and that the inhabitants be encouraged to learn from them and make themselves self-supporting. They suggest the establishment of a number of distributing centres for raw cotton and collecting centres for the finished product. A wide market is foreseen in India and Java for 'Ihr&amp;ms', (the regulation garb of all pilgrims during certain stages of the pilgrimage) woven in the Holy Land and an adequate market in Arabia itself for home-made cotton goods to be sold at a cheap/ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, (Development &amp; Intelligence)*cheap price* The profits of the industry, if God will that profits there d©, should, the promoters suggest, be devoted to the Industry’s expansion. Contributors, presumably those in India reeponsible tor the soheme, would, it is said, supply the necessary funds for the purchase of the cotton; they would also, it is to be presumed, find the experts and pay them until the industry became self-supporting, for it is definitely stated that the finances of the Hejas would not suffer. Before the work is begun, however, Ibn Sa’ud’s approval is sought and the hope is expressed that it may be given in time to enable a start to be made during the forthcoming pilgrimage season. 3. The scheme was submitted to the King in the form of a petition and through the good though private offices of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, who handed it to the Sa’udi Minister of Finance on December 17. It is understood to have been forwarded to Riyadh, but no reply has yet been made. The originators in India are already betraying some impatience at the delay. If a guess may be made as to the outcome it is that the scheme stands little chance of success unless and until bargaining shows a handsome margin of profit, legitimate or incidental, for Ibn Sa’ud and the more prominent individuals of his Government. The bargaining may possibly extend to discussion of a largish loan for general financial purposes. 4, I see no objection to this project being pursued but I have warned the Indian Vice-Consul that he should not involve himself too deeply and have drawn special attention to the importance of making sure that the responsibility for paying the wages of any Indian labour imported shall lie with the Indian interests concerned, not with any Hejazi commercial group or authority./- 3 - authority. 5.
