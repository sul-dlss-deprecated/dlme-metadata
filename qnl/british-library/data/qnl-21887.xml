Political Resident in the Persian GulfAwali Camp, Bahrein Islands. (Persian Gulf). To Secretary to Govt, of India, Defence Department, Imperial Secretariate Offices, NM DELHI. Through: His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein Island (Persian Gulf). Through: Proper Channel. Sir, With great deference and humble submission I beg to state that I belong to the Fighting Clans of Rawalpindi Division, Punjab Province, India, whose members have always been very keen to help Government in difficult times. During the last Great War we gave about a thousand recruits when half a dozen members of my family ser ved as Combatant Officers whfSTniy father. Dr. Kartar Singh was perma nently disabled. Mr. Ogilive, the Defence Secretary, when as Deputy Commissioner, Gujranwala, personally knows my father and family connections. During the/present Wrfrld Vfar,/ the m&lt; not ’ behind inspite/ of tlye farat that If ter tl much vantage accruyd to family angf vie did £ la nuriber of Cdmmendat/ion/Certificates and again serving the benign Government and out of my two younger brothers, one, Gurbux Singh Chowdhry, Aeronautical Engineer who held very res ponsible position in England as Aircraft Inspector at Brough East Yorkshire is now serving as Engineer Instructor with the Indian Air Force. The youngest Jaspal Singh Chowdhry is the 1st. Indian Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Indian Navy. He was commanding one of His Majesty’s ships at the Naval base at Wazigapatam recently bombarded by the Japanese; his ship had three close misses and he got a severe bomb sock and is sent home on sick leave where he is laid down as an indoor patient at the British Military Hospital at Rawalpindi. My first cousin, pilot officer R.A.F., late Manmohan Singh Chowdhury, the 1st. Indian Aviator v/ho spent 14 years in England, being the 1st. Indian who success fully accomplished Trans Atlantic Solo flight, the pride of India and on whose education and training family’s resources were practically exhausted lost his life on the 3rd of March at Singapore while serving the King and the country. ambition in life has been to wear the insigitia of R.A.F. and inspite of the legitimate support, there were no opportunities then for medical appointments in the Indian Air Force. I enclose herewith copy of letters Nos.9959/20/P dated 20th March and 3rd May, 1939, from the Headquarters Royal Air Force, India (vide Exhibit 'A”). A few months later I got an offer from the Bahrein Petroleum Company where since then I am serving under Foreign Service Agreement. I came here as a doctor for the Refinery, the place which was later bombarded by the Italians. I am glad that I am here, doing my bit not less important than those actually attached to the Fighting units. The work here goes on for 24 hours so that oil production should be at its full swing and myself as a doctor has got to treat ac cident cases and cases of sickness at work amongst all employees except Europeans about a couple of thousand. My father now, at the age of 67, being a retired officer is Myself, since the time I qualified as a Doctor, my greatestA Soon after the bombardment of the Refinery by the Italians, a detachment of Hong Kong Shanghai Royal Artillary about 50 men was sent for the protection of the Refinery, These 50 men and about 180 of the snecial Police recruited by the Local Government against sabotage in the oil fields had no medical equipment of their own. They were stationed at Raffa Camp which is situated about 14 miles away from the Government Hospital. To take cases of sickness, however, small, to Government Hospital and back every day was a great problem to Cant. Chadwick, the then Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. Having known about it I readily offered to work honorarily, though as a matter of fact, special Police unit was long before coming to me for treatment at the Refinery. I enclose herewith copy of letter from Cant. Chadwick accepting my honorary services officially (vide Exhibit 'B' Def./Pers./73 dated 1st. April,41). Thus for a period of about a year or so I actually worked as Medicel Officer for the Defence Personnel. I started to give them treatment at the spot and this was highly appreciated by the sick and those requiring medical attention. As an employee of the Company, I had my own obligations to discharge, which, as a matter of routine, already meant about 9/10 hours of hard work every day. However, daily I used to devote about a couple of hours for this purpose and I could do so only after cutting short my hours of rest and recreation. During the last s wm er, when on account of excessive heat, the Company reduced the worV^Jpr the employees to 7 hours, I was already discharging about 9/10 houri of honest hard work for the Company and over and above I carried on this honorary work, happily without a single complaint from any of the Defence Personnel and to 'the entire satisfaction of all who were entrusted to me. It would have been very easy for me to get an allowance of about a hundred rupees per mensam in l ieu of this work, but I did not think it of National Service, I continued to do so until the H.K.S.R. Artillary detachment was shifted from this place and some other soldiers came in who had medical unit of their own. I enclose herewith copy of a letter from the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, recording his appreciation of the services rendered by me to the Bahrein Defence units, vide Exhibit Apart from my obligations to the Company, even at -resent the position is that I have volunteered my services for the Bahrein Defence units in any capacity that I may be considered fit for. These Aircraft gunners are encamped just outside the Refinery, a few y^Tards from the Refinery Dispensary and their medical unit is equipped to render First Aid only and in case they need my assistance in any way, T am willing to co-operate with them. In brief my case is more or less like this That for a period of a year or so, I have actually worked as Medical Officer for the Bahrein Defence units ^nd this work has been highly appreciated by the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. I did not get any allowance in lieu of this work . 2, That, apart from my obligations to the Company, I have volunteered my services for the Bahrein Defence units and tfc&amp;l during the normal times I am always willing to co-operate with them. That, in the event of an Air Raid, apart from my obligations to the Company, I am prepared to give the Bahrein Defence Units all possible assistance in case the situation so demanded. That my position here at present is a little more than an ordinary civilian, because in the interest of National work o-f great importance, I am detained here and my services have been requisitioned by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. T enclose herewith copy of ^the Defence Regulation by His Britannic Majesty’s Representative in the Persian Gulf with the consent of Government of India - (Fide Exhibit 'D').In view of the above, it would not be nuch to ask if the benign Government would like to confer on me an honorary rank consistent with my position in the Company and such duties for which I have volun teered myself and I may have to perform during my period of service here. I am now about 40, Senior Doctor in the Camp, having 4 years’ Military Service to my credit while a student at the Punjab University and a member of the University Training Corps. I have also undergone A.R.P. Instructors' Course in Incenidary Bomb Control and Antigas and specialized treatment of gas and Air Paid casualties. The Combined Army list would show that 13 members of my family are holding King’s Commission and at present some of them are holding a position of great responsibility and trust, for instance, my cousin Major Lochan Singh Chov^hury is Officer Commanding in the line of Communication at Basrah I am educated unto B.Sc. Standard of the Panjab University and on the basis of this alone, coupled with Mili tary experience and family services, nothing can prevent me from getting King’s Commission if I were in India at present . As many as 1100 Officers are being trained annually for King’s Commission and most certainly I can be one like them, b ut I feel that I am doing my bit, here, equally important. The Company needs at least two Doctors to run the Medical work of about two three thousand employees and one amongst us having already left since the last 5/6 months, the whole work has fallen on my shoulders and inspite of my best efforts, there are no prospects of dis tinguishing myself in service here. This Bahrein Island has its importance on account of the Oil Fields, being a small Arab State with Indian Currency and Postage and some of the Departments like postal are managed by the Government of India. I hope that my application will be considered favourably. Attachments : 5. Date I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, DR.B.S.CHOUDHUPy Medical Officer, Awali-Camp, BAHREIN ISLAND.

I am now to inform you that with the approval of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has made a Defence Regulation, No.2 of 1942, regarding essential undertakings in Bahrain, of which I enclose a copy.

You are requested to bring this Regulation and this letter to the attention of all your employees who are British subjects or British protected persons, and to obtain from each individual concerned a written acknowledgment that this has been done. These acknowledgments should be forwarded to me. 6. The position of your employees to v/hom the Regulation applies will now be the same as that of British subjects and protected persons employed by the Anglo- Iraninan Oil Co. as that of industrial workers in Great Britain whose expert know ledge or whose technical skill has been requisitioned by the Govt, for use in the production of armaments or for other purposes connected with the War, and as that of the employees of certain important industrial concerns in India, such as Caltex India’s installations at Bombay, the Calcutta Tramways and the Burmah-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Co., Calcutta, to which the Sssential Services (Maintenance)Ordinance 1941 has been applied* Imperial interests render it vital that the activities of Oil Companies should be maintained and all who contribute to this end are playing their part in the present War.

Overseas Man-Power Committee. Volunteers from Abroad. Sir, I transmit herewith a copy of a circular despatch to superintending consular officers enclosing a memorandum which sets out revised arrangements for dealing with offers of service from volunteers who wish to assist the British war effort. 2. You will see that consular officers have been requested not to set the' new arrangements in motion pending the receipt of instructions from you, and I shall be glad if you will now advise them, sending me a copy of your despatches, on the degree of publicity which they should give to the scheme, on the attitude which they should adopt towards “reservations,” and on any other points which occur to you. As to “ reservations, you should, after consultation with your Service attaches, if any, give consular officers the names of any specific persons from whom offers of service should not be entertained. You should also look through the lists of volunteers com municated to you by consular officers to ensure that no mistakes are made. 3. You will see that it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to pay for the-passages of accepted volunteers on their eventual return to the countries from which they His Majesty’s Representative (07/1942) 11671a 23521—18a9 came, provided the necessary visas are forthcoming. It is to be hoped that no insuperable obstacles would be encountered from the foreign Governments concerned on this score, and, all hough it may be difficult to obtain any valid assurances on the subject now, I shall be glad if, unless you see objection, you will approach the Govern ment of the Country in which you reside with a vjew to securing their agreement that visas shall be granted to the volunteers when the time comes. 4. If the need arises, you will no doubt take steps to suspend the acceptance of volunteers as contemplated in paragraph 22 of the circular to consuls. I am, with great truth and regard, Your obedient Servant, ANTHONY EDEN.I W 3004/1695/49 ] Foreign Office, March 26, 1942. Confidential. OVERSEAS MAN-POWER COMMITTEE. Volunteers from. Abroad. WITH reference to Foreign Office circular despatch of the 29th April, 1941 (W 3533/19/49) and other correspondence regarding volunteers for war service, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith copies of a memorandum showing the types of volunteers now needed here and the conditions on which offers of service may be accepted from British subjects. may now be dealt with in the same way as British subjects. (But see paragraphs 7 and 18 below.) The position of other aliens, including aliens wishing to join the Allied forces, remains unchanged, and any applications from them should be handled under existing instructions. In no case should offers of service be accepted from aliens except in accordance with definite instructions or after specific reference to the Foreign Office. Previous Instructions Cancelled. 3. The new arrangements, which represent a general broadening of the basis of overseas recruitment and cover the acceptance of offers of service from women and married, as well as unmarried, men, constitute a codification and extension of existing arrangements. All previous instructions relating to British volunteers for service in the United Kingdom are cancelled. 4. ^ ou should make it known m suitable quarters among British communities in your district that a new scheme for the acceptance of offers of service has been introduced and that volunteers should approach you about it. In some countries it may be possible to insert a notice in the press to this effect. Care must, however, be taken not to offend the susceptibilities of the local authorities or (see paragraph 8) of any considerable element of the British community. 5. The memorandum relating to British subjects has been drafted in such a way that it may be showm to them in confidence at your discretion. Copies could, if necessary, be entrusted to any reputable community organisations which had agreed to assist you in making the details of the new scheme knowm to British subjects. It is important that all, volunteers whose applications might prove successful should be made fully awoire in advance of the conditions they would have to accept. “ Reservation.' 6. Applications should not be entertained from the volunteers likely to be of greater use to the war effort by remaining where they are. This category would, of course, include persons wdio are employed by His Majesty’s Government or the British Council, who are playing an essential part in the organisation of British communities, or who hold key positions in important enterprises of value to the Allied cause and cannot be replaced. (See paragraph 5 of the memorandum.) In assessing indispensability you will, of course, give full weight to the growing need for man-power here. Aliens. 2. You will see that “aliens of the second generation born abroad’’ who would have been British subjects but for the failure of their parents to register their births at a British Consulate Publicity. (17/1942) 11671b 23521—18b To H.M.Consular OfficersLoyalty, &amp;c. 7. You should accept no applications from volunteers if, after making such enquiries as you can, you have any reason to doubt their loyalty. If you feel satisfied on this point but ascertain that a volunteer has enemy connexions, you should report the fact, together with other particulars relating to him, before proceeding with his application. Certificates of loyalty will be required in the case of accepted volunteers “ of the second generation born abroad ” (see paragraph 18 below). Colon r. 8. Generally speaking there are few opportunities at present for the employment of volunteers of coloured race in the United Kingdom. These should not, therefore, be accepted without reference to the Foreign Office. In view, however, of the strong feelings which exist on the question of racial or coloured discrimination, it is of the greatest importance to avoid any suggestion, verbal or by procedure, that there is any discrimination of this kind in the treatment of any volunteer. If other grounds for rejection do not exist, names should be referred to the Foreign Office, and there is, of course, no objection to noting names of coloured volunteers in case it may be possible to utilise their services at a later date. If any of them have qualifications of special value, you should in any event send full particulars to the Foreign Office for consideration. Applicants from Remote Placer. 9. In cases where you receive an application from a volunteer who lives at a considerable distance from your post and on the face of it seems suitable, you may offer to pay reasonable travelling expenses, as distinct from subsistence allowance, to enable him to present himself to you for selection. Such applications, however, must be supported by a letter of recommenda tion from a local resident of standing, unless the volunteer is already known to you, and by a certificate showing that he passed a preliminary medical examination. Selection. 10. You will, of course, take the greatest care in selecting applicants on the basis of these instructions in order to avoid the disappointment and dissatisfaction which would result if a volunteer, on arrival here, were found unfit for the work which he had expected to undertake. Wherever possible, you should obtain the opinion of the appropriate Service Attach^ before proceeding with the applications of volunteers for His Majesty’s Forces. Medical Examinations. 11. You should, as far as possible, arrange for all medical examinations to be carried out by the same doctor, or doctors, who should be of the highest standing and preferably British subjects. You will, no doubt, endeavour to obtain reduced fees. • Notification of the Acceptance of Volunteers. 12. When a volunteer in your district has been accepted, notification of his name and age, and other particulars (in the form appended to this despatch) should be sent to the Foreign Office. A copy should also be sent to your superintending diplomatic mission, if any. 13. All forms used for the above purpose, including those relating to volunteers who have been accepted after reference to the Foreign Office, should be numbered in one series at each superintending post, no account being taken of any forms, now regarded as obsolete, which were 'kent home before the receipt of these instructions. It should not be assumed that all persons w'hose particulars have been submitted on such forms and whose services have not yet been called for are considered unsuitable, but as consular officers are now enabled to accept volunteers on their own responsibility, it is unnecessary to proceed with selection here. In cases where applications are referred to the Foreign Office by telegraph in accordance with the present instructions, there is no objection to referring to forms sent in under the previous instructions, if this enables you to shorten your telegrams.V' Notification of Departures. 14. The Foreign Oihee should be informed bv telegram on the departure ol accepted volunteers. The telegram should give ( v in cypher) the name ol the vessel, the probable date ol the volunteers’ arrival in the United Kingdom, and (en clair) a list oi their surnames and serial numbers, grouped according to the Service oi employment winch they expect to enter. 11 tin- volunteers are likely to arrive beiore the information referred to in paragraph 12, that information must be included in the telegram. 15. Consular officers at inland posts should, where necessary or more convenient, arrange for the above telegraphic notification to be sent by the consular officer, if there is one at the port / ^ s of departure. w lb. In cases where trans-shipment must take place or where the vessel is likely to make a protracted call at an intermediate port, arrangements should be made for the ForeignOffice to be informed of the probable date of the volunteers’ at rival by the consular officer or other British authority at the final port of departure. 17. In the cases referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, the telegraphic notification must, of course, give the name of the consular post from which the volunteers emanate. Passports. 18. The passports of accepted British volunteers should be marked X.8. (with date) in red ink over the consular seal. In the case ol volunteers “ of the second generation born abroad,” this marking should be placed on an emergency certificate to be issued to the volunteers in addition to their foreign passports. Attached to the emergency certificate should be a certificate of loyalty signed by a career consular officer, but neither document should be issued except after consultation with the Passport Control Officer, if any. A duplicate of the declaration signed by volunteers (see Appendix II) should be attached to their British travel documents, and a note made on the latter that this has been done. Transport. 19. Consular officers should arrange, in consultation where possible with the representative of the Ministry of War Transport or the Sea Transport Officer, for the conveyance of volunteers by the most convenient means, having regard to cost. British or British-controlled transport should be used wherever possible. 20. In view of the institution of these arrangements for the grant of free passages to suitable volunteers, any existing arrangements for the payment of reduced fares by volunteers travelling on their own are now cancelled. 21. You should do your best to give accepted volunteers some idea of their probable departure date, and emphasise that they should remain in their existing occupations as long as possible. In giving them their final instructions to proceed to the port of departure you should do what you can to arrange for their stay there to be as short as possible (see paragraph 9 (i) of the memorandum). Suspension of Acceptances. ^ 22. If, as a result of transport difficulties or for any other reason, a considerable number of volunteers are awaiting an opportunity to go and it seems likely that the delay will be protracted, no further acceptances should be made until the circumstances have changed. Consular officers at ports of departure should keep their superintending diplomatic missions, if any, or their colleagues at other posts informed on this point so that acceptances may be regulated accordingly. Consular Fees. 23. No consular fees are leviable for any services necessarily rendered to volunteers in connexion with this scheme. No entries in tins respect need be made in quarterly returns of fees waived. ICK?4 Accounting. 24. All expenditure incurred under these instructions should be shown in your quarterly accounts as advances on behalf of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, and should be set out in a separate schedule supported by vouchers. Dominion Nationals. 25. These instructions are not intended to apply to persons belonging to the Dominions, and any such person from whom an offer of service is received should be advised to get in touch with his nearest diplomatic representative. If, however, in spite of this advice, he should still express a preference for service in the United Kingdom or in the United Kingdom Forces, his application^ may be dealt with under these instructions. Acceptance for Service outside the United Kingdom. 26. If any volunteer expresses a preference for service in India, you should communicate directly with the (lovernment of that country. In general, however, you should not attempt to place volunteers in local branches of His Majesty’s Forces without instructions from the Foreign Office. Distribution. 27. Extra copies of this despatch are enclosed for distribution to any career consular officers and also to any honorary consular officers of British nationality under your superintendence, provided you consider that the latter could conveniently administer these instructions. It should be sufficient to send any other subordinate consular officers a copy of the memorandum and request them to refer all applicants to you In any cy,se, you should yourself handle all correspondence with the Foreign Office regarding volunteers in your district. Observations. • 28. If you are doubtful on any points arising from these instructions or have any observa tions on them, you should inform your superintending diplomatic mission, if any, or the Foreign Office, without delay. Instructions from His Majesty's Representatives. 29. If your post is under the general superintendence of a diplomatic mission you should see to it no action is taken on this despatch, except as may be necessary in accordance with paragraphs 26 and 27 pending the receipt of further instructions from His Majesty's Bepresentative. You should also be guided by any subsequent instructions which he may send you. Acknowledgment. 30. You should acknowledge by telegraph the receipt of these instructions. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ALEXANDER GADOGANsecret. [ W 8004/1695/49 ] Enclosure. MEMORANDUM ON OFFERS OF SERVICE BY BRITISH SUBJECTS LIVING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. A NUMBER of British subjects of both sexes in foreign countries have offered or may offer to go to the United Kingdom to enter His Majesty’s Forces or take up civilian employment, and this memorandum has been drawn up to show the kinds of employment open to volunteers, the qualifications required, the conditions on which offers may be accepted, and the terms of service which would be enjoyed. Most of this information is given in Appendix L Unless otherwise stated,, accepted volunteers must sign a declaration in the form shown in Appendix II. Note. —An accepted volunteer is a volunteer who has been accepted by a Consul for fre« passage to the United Kingdom. 2. Volunteers of Second Generation Born Abroad. —-For the purpose of this Memorandum a volunteer who is technically an alien, but is not of British nationality, only as the result of the failure of his parents to register his birth at a British Consulate, may be regarded as a British subject. 8. Offers of Sendee. —Volunteers should, in the first instance, approach His Majesty’s Consular Officer for the district in which they live, stating what form of service they would prefer to undertake. After making the appropriate enquiries, including those indicated in the immediately following paragraphs, the Consul will normally be able to say whether a volunteer’s service is likely to be acceptable in some capacity (see also paragraphs 13-15 below). 4. Minors. —No application from a woman volunteer who is not yet 20 years of age can be entertained without the written consent of her parent or guardian. 5. Importance of Present Employment. —Some volunteers may already be engaged in occupations in which it is desirable in the interest of the Allies that they should remain. In such cases, the Consul will be unable to entertain their applications and will on request issue a certificate free of charge in the form given in Appendix III. 6. Knowledge of English. —Offers of services by volunteers who lack a good knowledge of English will not be accepted without reference to London, and then only if the volunteers have qualifications of special value. 7.

Applicants will be accepted only if they are of the medical standard, as described above, appropri&amp;t* to the Service or Occupation for which they are accepted. 9. Passage, &amp;c. —Volunteers whose services have been accepted will, in the first instance, receive the following assistance from His Majesty’s Government:—- (i) cost of fare (corresponding to British third class) from residence to port of embarkation, plus a subsistence allowance for that journey of IDs. a day from the date notified to them as that on which they should travel until embarkation (subject to a maximum of 30s.). (Accepted volunteers should be advised to continue in their occupations until the date thus notified); (ii) free passage to this country, plus an allowance of 2s. 6d. a day on the journey; 11671c [23521—18c] B2 ' (iii) a maintenance allowance of 10s. for each night (to cover a period of twenty-four hourj from the time of disembarkation) until the volunteer has entered a Service Unit or is placed in civilian employment. The allowance will not be payable to a volunteer in civilian employment for days on which he is not at the disposal of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, c.g., because he has arranged to visit relations; (iv) a “ settling-in ” grant for civilian workers of 24s. 6d. on being placed’in employment. 10. Clothing and Baggage. —Volunteers who expect to enter civilian employment should be warned to provide themselves with clothing suitable for the various seasons in the United Kingdom, remembering that clothing is rationed in this country. At the same time, baggage must be limited to 15 cubic feet whether transport is by a ship on commercial service or by troopship. A heavy overcoat and a raincoat are essential as well as warm under-clothing, and two or three pairs of boots and shoes, stockings, socks and woollen gloves A warm woollen scarf and knitted cardigan or pullover are most useful. 11. Tools. —Skilled workmen should, whenever possible, bring their own kit of tools and bona fide boxes of these may be carried in addition to the 15 cubic feet allowed for personal baggage. The insurance of tools and personal baggage against loss or damage on the journey to or from the United Kingdom is the responsibility of the volunteer concerned. 12. Reception in the United Kingdom. —Notification of the departure of volunteers will have been sent by the Consul to the appropriate department of His Majesty’s Government, and, whenever practicable, they will be met on their arrival. Unless they have made private arrange ments to stay with relatives or friends (see also paragraph 9 (iii)) they will be assisted to obtain accommodation at reasonable rates until they are enlisted or enter employment. In general the interval between arrival and the beginning of service or employment will be short. 13. Employment of Volunteers. —Arrangements will be made by the Ministry of Labour and National Service to place volunteers in the occupation of their choice or, if circumstances prevent this, in some other employment or service of national importance* including service in His Majesty’s Forces. 14. Men and Women of Military Age. —United Kingdom legislation permits the calling-up as members of the Armed Forces of men and women between the ages of 18 and 50. At present (February 1942) men over 41 and women over 22 are not being called up; but these ages may be raised at any time. Men and women of calling-up age will be allowed to enter or to remain in civilian employment only if the United Kingdom Government consider that they will be most useful if so employed. 15. Restrictions Affecting Civilian Employment. —There are a number of restrictions in force in the United Kingdom on the engagement of workers and on the extent to which they may choose and change their employment. Persons from abroad are subject to these restrictions. 16. Remuneration. (1) H.M. Forces — (a) Officers’ Pay. —There are slight variations in the rates of pay of officers in the three Services, but from £ 160—£200 may be taken as fairly representative as the sum payable per annum to the lowest commissioned ranks of the Navy (Sub- Lieutenant), Army (2nd Lieutenant), R.A.F. (Acting Pilot Officer). On attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Commander, Major or Squadron-Leader, the annual rate rate of pay will vary between £460-£520. Allowances. —Both married and single officers receive free accommodation and rations, or a cash allowance in lieu thereof. Separation from the family must, however, be regarded as a normality in war-time in the case of married men. The rates of allowance payable in respect of the families of officers, regardless of the age and rank of the officer, are as follows: — For a wife whhout children: £73 per annum. For a wife and 1 child: £109 10s per annum. For a wife and 2 children : £136 17s. 6d. per annum. For each additional child : £18 5s. per annum.— 9- 'b ► When residing with their families offieers will receive an additional Is. per day, but they will not receive the cash allowance in lieu of free accommodation. Allowances in respect of officers’ families are paid to the officer and not to their families. Marriage and children’s allowances are tax-free. The commencing rate of pay of officers of the women’s forces is approximately £130 a year with free accommodation and rations or a cash allowance in lieu thereof. No allowances are admissible in respect of families of officers of the women’s forces. (b) Other Ranks. —The minimum rate of pay for unskilled personnel serving in His Majesty’s Forces is 2s. 6d. per day for men and Is. Sri. per day for women. Rates of pay vary above this minimum according to rank and proficiency. In addition, members of His Majesty’s Forces are accommodated, rationed and clothed without cost to themselves. Family Alloivance. —As from the end of March 1942 the weekly British rates of family allowance for the lower ranks will be: 18s. for a wife with additions of 8s. 6ri. for the first child, 6s. 6d. for the second child, and os. each for the third and subsequent children. It is a condition for the grant of family allowance that the member of the Armed Forces shall contribute from his pay a minimum weekly amount as a • qualifying allotment. The rate of qualifying allotment for a man in receipt of the lowest rate of pay will be 3s. 6&lt;7. per week, and the rate increases as the rate of pay increases. The man’s allotment, together with a Government contribution of 3s. fid. per week, will be payable to his wife in addition to family allowance, e.g., the wife of a man on the lowest rate of pay will receive 25s. per week. Dependant's Allowance. —Allowances in respect of dependant relatives are not in general payable outside the United Kingdom or Eire, and are paid in the Fnited Kingdom and Eire only when the pre-enlistment contribution by a member of the forces towards the dependant’s maintenance exceeded 9s. a week and the means of the dependant fall within certain limits. A minimum allotment of 3s. fid. a week is required from the man. As from the end of March 3s. fid. a week will he paid by His Majesty’s Government and this amount, together with the man’s allotment, will be included in the Dependant’s Allowance.

A minimum allotment of 2s. 4d. per week is required from the woman. As from the end of March, 2s. 4d. a week will be paid by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and this amount, together with the woman’s allotment, will be included in the Dependant’s Allowance. (2) Civilian Occupations — (a) Professional Occupations. —The upper limit of the salaries which professional men and women may expect to receive in the United Kingdom is showm in Appendix I (Part II (a) ). (b) Skilled and Unskilled Workers (Men). —Earnings of skilled men vary widely according to the type of job and the amount of overtime worked. They are seldom less—without overtime—than £4 a week and are often considerably higher, particularly in the Engineering Group of occupations. Earnings gained by unskilled men, without overtime, vary from £3 a w r eek upwards. (c) Skilled and Unskilled Workers (Women). —Earnings of skilled women also vary widely according to the type of work, amount of overtime, and whether the job is resident or non-resident. Earnings for skilled women would not ordinarily (2 [23521—18c] b 24 1 V3, be less than £70 per annum, all found, for resident posts (for example, cookin^^ in institutions) and £2 10s. per week for non-resident work. For semi-skilled^ and unskilled women earnings would not ordinarily be less than £30 per annum, all found, for resident posts (for example, hospital domestics) and £2 5s. per week for non-resident work. 1&lt;. I fixation. Income tax at the prevailing United Kingdom rate is chargeable upon all income (including earnings) arising from sources in the United Kingdom (with the exception of interest from certain British Government securities such as 3 per cent. War Loan 1955-59, to which special privileges are attached). Income tax is also chargeable upon amounts derived t^ OI u ar ^ n 8 outside the United Kingdom which are remitted to or received in the United Kingdom. Volunteers would, of course, be entitled to the usual statutory allowances and reliefs to which persons resident in the United Kingdom are entitled. 18. ( ost of Living. Exact figures for the cost of living cannot be quoted as these vary according to the district and the standard of accommodation provided. In general, however, the charge lor board and lodging in private apartments fluctuates between 25s. and 35s. per week, tins includes bed. breakfast and evening meal every day, and usually additional meals at \veek-ends. It may also include the provision of a snack, such as a warm drink and biscuits in the late evening. In hostels for industrial workers which have been set up in a number of places by the Government, the present weekly charge is 27s. 6d. for men and 22s. 6d. for women. This charge covers accommodation, breakfast and evening meal, and also a snack in the late evening Recreational facilities are provided without extra charge. There are also facilities for women residents to do their personal laundry. In many factories canteens have been established and hot lunches are provided at verv moderate charges Similar facilities are available at the British Restaurants now established in main places. Suitable arrangements are made for men and women working on night shifts. p1 -^‘ Iiemiitance8 Persons Abroad.—Men and women permanently resident outside the sterling area brought to the United Kingdom under these arrangements may send home a proportion of their earnings if they wish to do so. J (a) There is no limit on remittances to places in the sterling area (which at present consists f the -Empire excluding C anada and Isewfoundland, plus Egypt, Iraq, the Belgian Congo, the Free French Empire and Iceland); Belgian (b) Remittances to places of permanent residence outside the sterling area are normally permitted up to ^5 per cent, of pay and allowances for single persons or 50 per cent for married persons in civilian work, and 100 per cent, of pay and allowances for members of His Majesty’s Forces; (r) Single persons in civilian employment with responsibilities equivalent to those of married persons may exceptionally be allowed to remit home more than 25 per cent of their earnings, subject to the over-riding maximum of 50 per cent • (d) If an assurance is required on the remittance of the full 50 per cent, by single persons it\hm Id'bpm °d be S lven provisionally if circumstances justify it, but ould be made clear that each case will be examined on its merits, and onlv in cases where single persons have responsibilities fully equivalent to those of mamed persons will they be permitted to send money home on the same terms' («) Persons who have hitherto been in receipt of income of their own from sterling sources^ (t.#., investments in the United Kingdom) will normally be allowed to remit home i5^ they so desire when they themselves have been brought to the United Kingdom. 20. Social Benefit in the United Kingdom. (a) Insurance against Unemployment and Sickneu employed manual workers, whatever less than n, £490°a nd ^ 0m lan wh0Se n0rmal rem &gt;«eration is at a rate of less than £420 a rear, are compulsorily insured under State Schemes of Insurance ?rom^vers V el% benefi t 9 dU .n n ^T' m ? mp l°^ ent !m,1 8iekne8s - British subjects coming om o er. eas to 'ork in the United Kingdom become insurable under these schemesimmediately on entering into employment, but they do not at once become entitled to full participation in the benefits of social insurance, as 30 contributions are required before qualifying for Unemployment Benefit and 26 for the reduced rate of Sickness Benefit (104 contributions are necessary before the full rate of Sickness Benefit is paid); free medical treatment is, however, available for workers as soon as they become insured. The rates of contribution and benefits are set out in Appendix V. If workers from overseas become unemployed through no fault of their own or fall ill before they have paid the full number of contributions entitling them to insurance benefits, they are eligible (subject to a test of need) to receive payments from the Assistance Board. (b) Compensation in case of Accident or Disease. —Compensation iri case of accident or certain scheduled diseases, arising .out of and in the course of employment, is provided w - under the Workmen’s Compensation Acts. j (c) Compensation for disablement or death attributable to service in His Majesty s I orces will be payable in respect of persons who served as members of those Forces, under the Royal Warrant of 29th June, 1940, for the Army and corresponding instruments for the Naval and Air Forces. (d) Compensation for Civilians who sustain Personal Injunj resulting from Enemy Action .— Compensation for disablement or death caused by “ war injuries (these are, broadly speaking, injuries due to enemy action) whether sustained on a voyage over or in the United Kingdom or on a return journey for which the cost is provided by the Government, will be paid under the conditions of the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme (S.R. and 0. 1941, No. 226) which regulates compensation payable to civilians in the United Kingdom in respect of disablement or death due to war injuries. The compensation awarded in respect of disablement will be paid to the individual concerned in this country or will be remitted for his benefit or that of his dependants to the country in which he was resident before coming to this country. Compensation in respect of death will be paid to the dependants of the deceased and should they reside outside the United Kingdom at the time of his death will be remitted for their benefit to the country m which they reside. (e) Medical Treatment for Injuries resulting from Enemy Action .—Free medical treatment at hospitals and First Aid posts is provided for all “ war injuries.” The arrangements include the free provision of any necessary artificial limb or surgical appliance. 21. War-time Conditions.—Ordinary amenities in the United Kingdom are at present curtailed in various ways. Thus volunteers must be prepared for the black-out, for working on night shifts, for rationing of food, clothes and other articles, scarcity of petrol and limited facilities for travelling, shortage of silk stockings, sweets, chocolates, tobacco, wines and spirits. 22. Return Journey. —After the termination of hostilities (or earlier, at the discretion of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, in circumstances beyond the control of the volunteer) return passages will be provided. Civilians will be granted return passage free of cost to themselves, although no undertaking can be given as to the type of accommodation which will be provided for the return passage. Allowances during the return passage (except the “ settling in ” grant) will be granted at the same rate as those given on the journey to the United Kingdom. Allowances will cease on arrival at the volunteer’s home address. Members of Flis Majesty’s Forces will be provided with return passage under any arrangements which are made for the ^ repatriation of members of those Forces. The possibility of a volunteer’s return will,'of course, depend upon his obtaining any necessary visas. In cases of difficulty His Majesty’s Government would give such assistance as they could, but the decision would, of course, lie with the Foreign Government concerned.APPENDIX T.

Dear Sir: b* * foe refer to our letter No.PA-280 of July 13th, 1942, which covered an enclosure from Dr. B.S. Chowdhury to the Secretary to the Government of India. We now enclose, at Dr. Chowdhury 1 s request, another letter from him on a similar subject addressed to your goodself for such action as you may see fit to take. W. P. ANDERSON CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD.Bahrein, November 26,1942. The Honourable His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. Sir, With great deference and humble submission, I beg to state that from time to time the notices and circulars which have been issued from the Agency, it has been pointed out that His Majesty’s Government regard the operations of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein, of vital importance to the National interest and that the Employees of the Company in Bahrein can best serve the National interest by remaining at their posts. Accordingly therefore, I request your favour of very kindly giving a ruling as to whether the period of my service with the Bahrein Petroleum Company can be considered ’’War Service”f Apart from the general question, there is a fine distinction in my case and the case of any other Employee of the Company in the following respect: Soon after the Refinery was raided by the Italians, the Hong Kong Shanghai Royal Artillery detachment which was stationed just outside the Refinery had no medical unit of their own, nor the Defence Police had any medical facilities. To take the sick and those requiring medical attention to Manama Government Hospital every day (14 miles away) and bring them back was a great problem to Capt. Chadwick, the then Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. On the event of his asking, I readily volunteered to serve the Bahrein Defence units as an Honourary MedicalOfficer for such period as my services would be required. I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Capt.Chadwick officially having accepted my services for this purpose (vide Exhibit A). On the event of Hong Kong Shanghai Royal Artillery detachment been transferred, the other units which followed them had their own Doctor, so I had to quit that honourary position, but the fact remains: that for a period of one year and three months I worked as an Honourary Medical Officer for The Bahrein Defence units . I enclose herewith copy of a letter from the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, recording his appreciation of services in this connection (vide Exhibit B). During this period I performed all such duties which can be required of a regular Medical Officer attached to a unit. I attended them regularly every evening and was at their beck and call any time I was required for any emergency and over and above all this, I did not get any allowance in lieu of such services. If the whole period of my service here cannot be considered 'War Service', I request your favour of very kindly giving a Ruling: whether the period I have actually served as Medical Officer for the Bahrein Defence units can be considered 'War Service'? If reply be in the affirmative, I request that a Certificate may kindly be granted to me to the following effect: (a) The total period of my service here up-to-date and out of which the period which can be considered 'War Service'.(b) That during this period I worked as a Medical Officer for the Bahrein Defence units and this work was highly appreciated by the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. (c) That during this period I have always been very keen and zealous to offer my services for the Defence work and as a matter of fact for anything where the same could be best utilized. (d) A general recommendation. I understand that a number of Universities in India have declared handsome concessions to their students who want to offer their services for the 'War”; naturally therefore. I can be entitled to such concessions if some of the period of my service here can be recognized as 'War Service'. Besides the concessions declared by the Universities, there are various concessions declared by the Local Governments of different Provinces.

My dear 'kaAtfidl, Dr. P.S.Dhami, who has been with the Iraq. Petroleum Company and ourselves for some 14 years, is considering applying for a King’s Commission in the Indian Army Medical Corps under the conditions of a pamphlet published by the War Department, Government of India, last month of which he has a copy. In submitting his application, it is necessary for him to enclose a recommendation from two responsible persons to the effect that he is of regular and steady habits and is likely, if appointed, to prove in every way creditable to the Indian Army Medical Corps. He has applied to me for one of these recommendations, and I enclose a copy of the testimonial I propose to give him. It occurred to me that an endorsement by you on this testimonial might carry considerable weight. If you can see your way to add your remarks, I am sure he would be most Grateful. I do not think the War Department, Government of India, will pay much attention to the recommendations of Branch Managers of oil companies in the Persian Gulf. Dr. Dhami was five years in Qatar and met Colonel Hay and several Political Agents in Qatar at various times. If vou would care to see him, it can be easily arranged as he is working now for Bapco. I understand from him that he was not required by Bapco to sign Defence Regulation No.2 of 1942 and is free to leave them if he so desires at a month s notice. He is on one year’s agreement of which he has now done four months. Yours sincerely, Enel E.B.Wakefield, Esq., I.C.S., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain,C.2.40.

From January 1937 to the present time Civil Engineering and Surveying Assistant to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Experience, My original appointment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company was as a CitIj Engineering Assistant for Field 'fork in connection with the construction of the Company’s refinery.

From Major T. Hlckinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. To Sir, I have the honour to Inform you that Mr. J.F, Qornall has applied to me for permission, under Article 2 of the Defence Regulation Mo.2 of 1942, to leave Bahrain for the purpose of Joining the Army. I enclose a copy of Mr. J.F. Gornall'a professional qualifications. 2. Mr. J.F. Gornall is reported by the Bahrain Petroleum Company in whose employ he is now and hns been for the last six or seven years to be a very good workman and they are by no means anxious to lose his services. The Chief Local Representative of the Company personally explained the case to me. It seems that the Company some eighteen months ago promised Mr. J.F. Gornall that they would release him on the completion ^y him of certain work he was then engaged upon. He has now completed the programme to their satisfaction and they feel bound to honour their word though they have no desire to see Mr. J.F. Gornall leave their employ. 3. I find myself in a very difficult position for there are other Englishmen in the Company who are also desirous of Joining the Forces but who cannot be replaced. 1 anticipate that if Mr. J.F. Gornall is released I shall have a number of requests for similar treatment which will not be easy to answer. I have told Mr. J.F. Gornall that I will only permit him to leave Bahrain .if I can be assured that a person of his prof- fessional q ualification can best serve the common cause by leaving his present essential oil production work and becoming a Royal Engineer. 4. To summarise, the Company do not want to lose the man but will keep their word. I will not release him unless I am assured his services are more valuable elsewhere then here. I shall appreciate your views. I have the honour to be, sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain. cyfc-7 ,^' To- No.59286 /a.G. 2(d). GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, INDIA.

My dear Mr. Oornall, I enclose a copy of my letter to the Adjutant- General’s Branch of General Headquarters India and their reply. I «« afraid that it will be a disappointnent to you but at least you know that whatever your personal inclinations may be the Army Authorities consider you are many of us who would much like to Join up but are not allowed to do so. I personally feel that the only thing to do is to do ones work to the best of ones ability and try and contribute in that way and by giving whatever one can afford to the various funds to help those who have been fortunate enough to join up to enjoy things that we take as a matter of course. are doing better work here and should remain. There Yours sincerely, J. F. Gornall Esq., Box Ho.661, The Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain.- Mr. Packer*s letter dated the 10th May 1943. I have Interviewed Dr. Dhami who tells me that Dr. Storm said he would raise no objection to Dr. Dhami*s leaving. first February 1943. As it was a shortterm contract and his employment was only t emporary he had not been asked to a commission in the l.A.M.C. This is partly because he wants to go back to India and partly because, if he has a commissioi in the l.A.M.C., his son can secure education in a military college. 2. 1 discussed this case with Mr. Anderson on the 24th m May. I said that I thought we should have to release Dr. Dhami as he had not signed the Defence Regulation but I said I would try and delay his departure until a replacement was in sight. As a replacement 1 suggested the name of the Hassa doctor whom we recently tried to get for the Trucial Coast (Dr. latif). o i «=.oiio ri-no-Pt. /S-fptat.pH and rpflnhmit file on 24/6/43.
