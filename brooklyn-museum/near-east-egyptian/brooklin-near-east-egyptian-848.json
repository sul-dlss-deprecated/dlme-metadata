The temple was destroyed in antiquity and fragments from it are quite rare. The plaque represents in raised relief a mythological bird called Rekhit sitting on a boat (?) of basket design. A five pointed star and alternating squares of the boat are in white, the background and the other squares are in green blue faience which is inlaid. These objects are the symbols of Lower Egypt and are doubtless adoring the Pharaoh.\r\nCondition: the upper left hand (about a quarter of the plaque) is missing. The right edge and top are badly chipped and same of the small square are missing. There is some iridescence on the inserts.", "medium": "Faience", "dimensions": "4 1/2 x 4 x 7/8 in.
