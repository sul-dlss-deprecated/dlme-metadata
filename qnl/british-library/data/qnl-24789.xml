I said that I had noticed that the Southern area of the concession might possibly be held to include the Islands of Tamb and Bumusa, as the Iranian Government claimed these as part of their territory and would consequently regard them as Iranian Islands lying within the defined area, I did not suppose that the Company, with so large an area to cover, would be interested in small islands, especially as red oxide was excluded, but I thought it might be well to remind him that these two islands were not Iranian, and that it would not be possible for a foreign company to work there, in the unlikely I event of their wishing to, under a concession granted by the \ Iranian Government* 2* Monsieur Buttingha Wichers said that, from what he had heard while the concession was being negotiated, he thought it unlikely that the Company would take any interest in the islands, except for Qishim Island. He undertook, however, as soon as any of the Dutch managers returned to this country, to pass on to them what I had said about Tamb and Bumusa, In the circumstances I do not think there is any danger of the company being tempted to interfere with the islands, I have, etc*, (Sgd,) H.J.

I HAVE the honour to inform your Lordship that a bill was introduced before the Majlis on the 12th April, for the approval and ratification of a contract signed between the Ministry of Industry and Mines and the Algemeine Exploratic Maatschappij, a Dutch company for prospecting and research and possible eventual exploration of mineral wealth in two clearly defined areas, as shown on the rough sketch map which is enclosed^ 1 ) 2. The southern area it will be observed, includes the Island of Tamb and probably also Bumusa, which is just on the southern edge of the defined area. I propose to take an early opportunity of mentioning to the Netherland Minister the fact that these islands are not under Iranian sovereignty. 3. In the north-western area the company is permitted to explore for both minerals and oil, but in the southern area, oil and red oxide are excluded. 4. Under the contract for prospecting, a copy of which is enclosed,( 2 j the company holds a concession for three years, but under the contract for exploita tion, sixteen articles of which have so far been published, the concession is for sixty years. 5. The first reading of the bill met no opposition in the Majlis and was passed to the finance commission for approval before ratification. 6.

Tehran, August 20, ]938 WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 226 E. of the ilth June, 1938. on tne subject of the mines which are now being operated at Anarek, I have the honour to report that the German press attache has informed the commercial secretary that the three-year concession granted to the German group Ferrostahl in 193/, for the exploitation of the nickel and copper mines, was suddenly cancelled by the Iranian Government a few days ago. No reason or excuse was apparently given. 2. M. Aderholt further informed Mr. Cumberbatch that, although they were taken by surprise, the Germans were not really worried, as they were more especially interested in nickel and had found this ore in insufficient quantity. Transport was difficult and costly and, generally speaking, the concession was not a paying one. 3.
