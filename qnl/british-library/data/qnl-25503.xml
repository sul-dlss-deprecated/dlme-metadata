It may be useful to explain, in continuation of the printedi.departmental Memorandum of the 28th Decembe®^1911, the present position of the schem^ for thefLighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf, adopted!as the result of the local enquiry held in 1909. j A convenient starting point is the “ summary or maximum possible expenditure,” described in paragraph 12 of that Memorandum in the following words : “ Assuming, for the sake of “ completeness, that the lights and buoys recom- “ mended in the letters of the India Office of the “ U-th September and 18th November 1911 (see “ paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without “ the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a “ lighthouse tender were procured at a cost of “ 30,000L initial, and 5,000L annual recurring, “ and that a depot were equipped at the full “ capital cost of 22,000L, the resulting expenditure “ would amount to :—initial 102,400L, annual “ recurring 7,700L” © Modifications in India Office scheme.

The “ Treasury suggestions ” above referred to were that a light vessel proposed for the Shatt- el-Arab should be dispensed with, and that a lighted buoy should be 'substituted at Bushire for a light- vessel. After some correspondence the Treasury withdrew their objection to the Shatt-al-Arab light- vessel, but, as regards Bushire, it was decided that a lighted buoy (at the outer anchorage in addition to that for the inner anchorage) would be sufficient. In another important respect the scheme described in paragraph 1 was modified, viz., in the elimination of the spare light-vessel (cost 9,500L) that had been included as part of the equipment of the depot (cost 22,0001.)

See paragraph 6 of earlier Memorandum. Thus the sanctioned scheme includes three light-houses, one light-vessel, six lighted and three unlit buoys. These are in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911 and the unlit buoys taken over from the British India Company.! It was subsequently decided that the cost of two dioptric lanterns for Bush ire (see paragraph 11 below) should be met from savings out of the total figures here given. t Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Memorandum dated the 28th December 1911.

By good fortune it was found possible to obtain for the Tanb Island lighthouse the plant that had been ordered for a lighthouse for the Colonial Office. The construction of this light house is consequently well in hand. The plant for the lighthouse at Musandam has been ordered, but will not be ready for several months. As regards the Shaikh Shuaib lighthouse, there has been a hitch, owing to the fact that the conditions attached by the Persian Government to the erection of a lighthouse on their territory are unacceptable, llis Majesty s Minister at Tehran is being consulted as to approaching the Persian The Lighthouses.

Government once more with a view to the grant of a concession—say, a lease for 99 years—which would allow a lighthouse to be built and worked by His Majesty’s Government. If it were not for the expense, a good way out of the difficulty would be the substitution of a light-vessel for the proposed lighthouse. The cost of the lighthouse, as stated above, is 8,000Z. initial, and 400L annual recurring. The corresponding figures for the cost of a light-vessel, according to Trinity House estimates, are 9,500Z. initial, and 650L annual recurring. (The Indian authorities have, however, stated that they could themselves build a light-vessel for l,080h less, he., 8,420L, see paragraph 5 below.) 5. On the recommendation of the Government of India the light-vessel for the Shatt-al-Arab is being constructed in Bombay Dockyard, where light-vessels have been built for the Bay of Bengal. According to latest information, it is anticipated that a saving of 1,080L may be effected on the sanctioned estimate (9,500k) The iron mast, lantern, &amp;c. are to be sent out from home.

Five lighted buoys have been sent out (in addition to the lighted buoy provided for the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab in 1911). The sixth, intended for the inner bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, is not for the present being supplied, in view of the negotiations opened with the Turkish Government for the establishment of a Shatt-al-Arab Navigation Commission.* The Unlit Buoys.

The unlit buoys are, like the light-vessel, being constructed in Bombay Dockyard on the recommendation of the Government of India. 8. A matter in which no progress has yet been piade is that of the lighthouse tender. The Committee that reported after local inquiry in 1909 on the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gidf regarded it as imperative that a specially constructed steamer should be provided to act as a lighthouse tender, and Air. D. W. Hood, the expert member of the Committee, wrote in his Supplementary Report:—“I estimate her cost, “ delivered in the Persian Gulf, after construction “ in England, at 30,000k The Indian Government “ from their own experience will be able to estimate “ what her annual maintenance would be in the “ East, but it would probably amount to about “ 5,000k per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, “ coal, stores, and all charges.” ^ These figures—initial expenditure 30,000k, and annual recurring 5,000k—represent the maximum estimate sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council and the Treasury, but the plans received from India are for a larger vessel than that contem plated, and one that would cost very much more to maintain. The matter is still under consideration.4 9. It was first proposed to locate the lighthouse depot at Koweit, but this plan was abandoned in favour of a site on the land leased by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the island of Abadan, near Mohammerah. Details are about to be investigated locally, but the conditions contemplated are, briefly, that land up to a total of two acres should be rented at ll. an acre for 49 years from the 29th May 1912, the period of the Company’s own lease, and that the Company should carry out certain works recommended by the Trinity House,supply oil (if in accordance with specification), and erect the necessary oil tanks. It is hoped that the result of the local investi gation will enable work at the dejjot to proceed without delay. An appreciable saving should apparently be effected on the cost of the depot, as originally estimated, through the employment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agency. The Lighthouse Depot.

In accordance with the recommendation of Trinity House, certain stores for the depot are being- sent out from England, viz :— 2 spare lighted buoys. 2 spare lanterns. 3 sets of spare buoy moorings. It is also in contemplation to send out a crane. 11. Mention may here be made of the supply of two dioptric lanterns for the Residency at Bushire at an estimated cost of approximately 124k initial expenditure, plus 2| per cent, for Trinity House charges, and 24L annual recurring. The Treasury took exception to the supply of these lanterns outside the sanctioned programme, and explanations were furnished by this Office. 12. In a letter to the Foreign Department dated the 11th August 1912, Sir P. (fox has called attention to “ the regrettable consequences, both “ political and economic, that might result from the “ failure of any light, even temporarily,” and, with a view to placing future administrative arrange ments on a satisfactory looting, has suggested that for the present the Political Resident should be the chief lighting authority in the Gulf and ex otjicio Inspectoi of Lights, and that pending the provision of the lighthouse tender the officer commanding the R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence ” should be gazetted u Assistant Inspector of Lights.” He has also suggested a scale of allowances for officers and men of the “Lawrence” employed in lighting- ana buoyage work. ‘ &amp; The views of the Government of India on these proposals have not yet been received. Any extra expenditure on this head may perhaps be met out ol savings effected on other parts of the scheme. Political Department, ^ India Office, 8th November 1912. Stores for the Depot from England.

I have the honour to address Government on the subject of the adminis trative arrangements necessitated by the inception during the current year of an extensive scheme of lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf, which, when / complete, will involve upkeep of 2 lighthoujes, 2 light-vessels, 7 lighted buoys, in addition to a number of unlighted buoys already in place, besides certain lights and marks on shore; a lighthouse depdt, and, eventually, a lighthmise tender. 2. Owing to the distance of the Persian Gulf from the sources of supply of the most important items in the scheme and the regrettable consequences, both political and economic, that might result from the failure of any light, even temporarily, it is of great importance that the administration and care of the lights should be placed from the first on a firm and unassailable basis, and that the details of the arrangements should be regulated with due consideration for the political and local necessities of the moment. So far as my record shows the position is at present by no means clear, and I trust that instructions needed for the definition of it will be issued as soon as possible. 3. The Government of India will remember that it was suggested by the Lighting and Buoyage Committee in paragraph 17 of their report of 29th April 1909, that— “ the Government of India were in the best position to undertake the administration of the Lighting system ” ; and in the following year, when it was merely a question of taking over and maintaining the buoys formerly laid and owned by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Government of India in the Marine Department instructed the Director of the Royal Indian Marine — “ to take over the beacon and buoys in question as soon as possible and Marine Department letter No. .364-M, dated to arrange for their care and 23rd August 1910. maintenance. It is presum ed that the Commander of R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence ” will be charged with this duty”. *** **»*• « i t j s requested that you will in due course suggest a reappropriation to meet the expenditure—initial and recurring—required this year ”. 4 Again in connection with the despatch to the Gulf of items of the new Lighting and Buoying Scheme recently sanctioned by His Majesty s Govern ment it has been taken for granted by the several offices concerned that the Officer Commanding R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence” is charged with the maintenance of these items also, as they come; and the continuance of this arrangement seems likely to be necessary at all events 1 until a special lighthouse tender is provided, the depdt completed, and the final scheme is in working order I would observe here that I presume throughout these remarks that the light houses themselves will be built and run entirely by the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, who will have the co-operation of the Residency in regard to any local or political details when he may require it. , As regards the employment of R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence” on lighting and huoya-e work, 1 would remind Government that her primary functions are those of a^Jspatch or special service vessel to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf and that in that capacity she is, while in Gulf waters, serving under t e immediate orders^f thatLfficer, who nowadays requires her very requendy connection with his political duties, and often at short notice.

As was anticipated, the depot is likely to cost considerably less than the &lt;£22,000 which was originally estimated, mainly because the item of £9,500 for a spare Light-Vessel may now \be left out. A rather more expensive unlit buoy for Jask is recommended, viz. one costing £200 instead of £100. As regards the tender the Trinity House remark that a vessel built of the dimensions \specified in the annexed letter of the Marine Department to the Director, P. I. M. would, cost considerably more than the £30,000 which they themselves allowed. In their telegram, of the \2nd February last the Government of India \contemplated the construction of the tender in India; it is proposed to enquire whether construction in England, would, not be preferable. Of the lighted buoys, 3 acetylene buoys are already under order, in accordance with our letter of the 9th March, and it is proposed to order two more. The buoy for the Shatt-al- Arab it is not proposed to order at present for the reason that in the informal cormuni- \cat ions which have been proceeding here with representatives of the Turkish Government they 'have asked that the status pao as regards buoys \in the river should be preserved.

The Elder Brethren suggest that the Lighthouses for Little Quoin, Tamb Island and Sheikh Shuaib Island be constructed of open iron frame work, the upper portion oeirg enclosed to act as a service or watch-room. The structure to be surmounted by a lantern of the usual type adopted in the Trinity House service.

The Elder Brethren propose that a competent mechanic he sent from England to the Persian Gulf to take charge of the erection of the towers from the foundation level and bring the lights into action, all necessary assistance, plant, labour, hoisting, tackle, &amp;c. being supplied by the Local Authorities. f The cost of the work to be supplied from England, including freight to the Persian Gulf, is estimated to be as follows»- Little Quoin Tamb Island Sheikh Shuaib Island £7,000 5,000 6,000 including mechanic from England for erection of same. Light V es sel . With reference to the establishment of a Light Vessel Shatt-al-Arab, four or five miles to seaward of the exis ting British Outer Bar Buoy, the Elder Brethren now suggest that the Light be on the Incandescent system, consuming oil, instead of the illuminant being oil-gae as originally proooseb. It is recommended that the_Vessel be built in England, and when completed placed on a station for trial and a dj u s tin ent4 y J adjustment ‘before being despatched :.o the Gulf, to which she could be towed by the Lighthouse tender which it is £9,500 proposed to construct The cost of the Vessel is estimated at Line thousand, Five hundred pounds, including deliverer to its destination, but the Elder Brethren desire to point out that this figure is liable to variation in consequence of the fre quent and considerable changes which take place in the cost of shipbuilding. The intensity of the light would be 40,000 candles, and the range of visibility eleven miles Buoy s, lig hted . Either Oil^gas or acetylene would be suitable illu- minants for the proposed lighted buoys, out in view oi the fact that the number of buoys required at Stations is only six, the expenditure which would be involved in establishing oil-gas producing plant, and fitting the lighthouse tender with transport receivers, gas compressing pumps, &amp;c. would in the opinion of the KLder Brethren //v4 £' hardly he justified, and they accordingly recommend^the six buoys be of the same type as the acetylne lighted buoy already established at 3 hatt-al-Arab which was constructed the International Karine Signal Company, and is Known a3^ 5 should he supplied from England, the estimated cost, including freight t oft he Gulf, oeing Six hundred pounds each £500 * Ifirv^K ^ f 3 ' &amp; Two Buoys of this type are reader and a.rrangements have been made with the Manufacturers to hold these at the disposal of the Elder Brethren for a few cays, and on hearing that the India Office wish them to be supplied they could he despatched at once. The remainder could probably be com pleted in ten to twelve weeks from date of order. d - Three Buoys of this type are included in the list, with topmarks and moorings complete, viz:- Buoys, unlit Jask 5th Class Conical Buoy Bander Abbas 2nd Class Can Buoy Bahrein 5th Class Conical Buoy In regard to this proposal I am to state that the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a 5th Class Buoy is too by One hundred pounds. It is suggested that the Buoys ana Moorings complete should be freight to the Gulf would be as follows: - Jask (Second C las s5 referred £200 £200 Class Two hundred pounds, Bunder Abbas Two hundred pounds £100 30,000 Bahrein, One hundred pounds Lippithou se Te nde r. In t? ' e rjhird Paragraph of the India Office letter dated bne ifa arch, tne hope ie expressed by Lord Crewe that a reduction may be made in the original estimate of the cost of the Lighthouse tender, viz:- Thirty thousand pounds. Accompanying the papers, however, is a letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 31st January last, stating the approximate dimensions to which tra Royal IndiayiMarine Committee desire the Vessel to be built. 0 &gt; 000 The estimate of Thirty thousand pounds is based on the cost of Steam Vessels constructed for the Trinity House service. Thera are certain parts in connection with these Vessels which would not be necessary in a tender for the Persian Gulf, whilst, on the other hand, the latter might require various fittings for the convenience of the Officers and Crew which are not necessary in this Service. The sum above mentioned is considered a reasonable estimate for such a tender as would be requisite for the duty required, but Co supply a Vessel to comply with the dimensions given by the Secretary Co the Government of India in the letterreferred to above would cost consideraloly more. - ’ In view ol recent developments in respect of the use of oil fuel and internal combustion engines, it may possibly be desired to consider both these features before defin itely deciding on the type of Vessel to be supplied.

It appears to the Elder Brethren that this is a matter that the Local Authorities are better able to decide, it being a question so materially affected by local conditions and facilities, the latter proposal offers the important facility of easily procuring fresh water for lighthouse purposes, thus rendering a distilling plant, as suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, un necessary. The modified scheme of lights adopted by the Govern ment of India, as compared with the more comprehensive one proposed by the Committee of Enquiry/ (but which it may oe intended eventually to carry out), naturally influences the area of land to be obtained, and the form of construc tion of the buildings; but the Elder Brethren recmmend that if possible not less than two acres be secured as a site for the Depot which would admit of future development§ 9 £ 22,000 £9,500 i /J V % i Q i C of the establishment. // in paragraph 4 of the India Ctfrice-letter of the 2nd Instant, enquiry is made as to the possibility of sub stantially reducing the estimated cost of the Depot, viz:- Twenty Two thousand pounds. This estimate included bine thousand, I?ive hundred pounds for a spare Light Vessel, and the cost of the essential general spares for the buoys, Sec., as mentioned in the statement submitted with this report. The scheme put forward by the Committee of Enquiry included several Light Vessels, in which case a spare ship was, of course, necessary, but as it is understood not to be the practice in India to provide a spare for a single itationh^ 16 Vessel might, for the present at least, be dispensed with, and a corresponding saving in cost effected. /2L The Elder Brethren are unaware as to the intentions of the Government of India in regard co tne nousing o^ 6 i r Officers, drew and Workmen at the Depot.

I am to add that, if the India Office concur in their suggestion, the Elder Brethren will be happy to arrange for the holding of the Conference at this House at the earliest possible date. I am, Sir, Y o ur obedient 3 er va* n t,CONFIDENTIAL. The Elder Brethren, Trinity House, to India Office. Ex. 874. Trinity House, London, E.C., Sir, 26tli March 191^. 1. With reference to your letters of 27th ultimo (P. 666) and 2nd and 14th instant (P. 612 and 956), relative to the lighting of the Persian Gulf, and forwarding a statement of the lights and buoys proposed to be established, also requesting certain further information in regard to the establishment of a depot and the provision of a tender, I am directed to acquaint you that the Elder Brethren have given the whole matter their careful consideration, and now direct me to submit the following observations for the information of the Secretary of State for India, pointing out that the characters of the various lights and lighted buoys have been selected with a view to their ultimately forming part of the larger scheme proposed in 1909. Lighthouses. 2. The list accompanying the India Office letter dated the 2nd instant provides for the establishment of three lighthouses, viz., at Little Quoin, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island, and the proposals relative to these are as follows :— At Little Quoin, the dioptric apparatus to be of the second order, the intensity of the light being 200,000 candles, and the range of visibility 20 miles. At Tamb Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and the range of visibility 20 miles. At Sheikh Shuaib Island, the dioptric apparatus to be of the third order, the intensity of the light being 100,000 candles, and the range of visibility 17 miles. The Elder Brethren suggest that the lighthouses for Little Quoin, Tamb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island be constructed of open iron frame work, the upper portion being enclosed to act as a service or watch-room. I he structure to be surmounted by a lanternjffi_the usual type adopted in the Trinity House service. The lighthouse's to be constructed in England from designs to be prepared at this House, the lantern, dioptric apparatus, burners, Ac., being fitted and tested before shipment. 3 * 5 6 3. It is suggested that the foundations for receiving the structures should be designed and constructed by the local authorities, the ^ necessary information in connection therewith being supplied by the Trinity House, also that the quarters for the keepers, landing places, roads, access from landings to sites, water storage tanks, &amp;e., be designed and constructed by the local authorities, who are best acquainted with the natuie of the requirements. 4 The Elder Brethren propose that a competent mechanic be sent from England to the Persian Gulf to take chargToTffie erection of the towers from the foundation level and bring the lights into action, all necessary assistance, plant, labour, hoisting tackle, &amp;c., being supplied by the local authorities. 5. The cost of the work to be supplied from England, including freight to the Persian Gulf, is estimated to be as follows Little Quoin, 7,0007. Tamb Island, 5,000Z f Sheikh Shuaib Island, 6,0007. ) including mechanic from England for erection of same. Light Vessel. 6. With reference to the establishment of a light vessel at Shatt-al-Arab, four or five miles to seaward of the existing British outer bar buoy,'.the Elder Brethren now suggest that the light be on the incandescent system,consuming oil, instead of the illuminant being oil-gas as originally proposed. ^ It is recommended that the vessel be built in England, and when completed placed on a station for trial and adjustment before being despatched to the Gulf, to which she could be towed by the lighthouse tender which it is proposed to construct. The cost of the vessel is estimated at 9,500L, including delivery to its destination, but the Elder Brethren desire to point out that this fi mire is liable to variation in consequence of the frequent and considerable changes which take place in the cost of shipbuilding. . . The intensity of the light would be 40,000 candles, and the raime of visibility eleven miles. ° Buoys, Lighted. ' • ETher oil gas or acetylene would be suitable illuminants for the nro posed lighted buoys, but in view of the fact that the number of buoys required at stations is only six, the expenditure which would be involved in establishing oil-gas producing plant, and fitting the lighthouse tender with tran^ort. receivers, gas compressing pumps. &amp;c., would, in the opinion of th'TT 61 Br n thren ’, ha, 1 ,y 1 be ;in(i they accordingly recommend that the six buoys be of the same type as the acetylene lighted buoy all eady established at Shatt-al-Arab, which was constructed bv the Inter national Marine bignal Company, and is known as No. 8 C. 'The bum-s complete with lanterns and moorings, should be supplied from England the estimated cost, including freight to the Gulf, being mi. each. Two buovs of this type are ready, and arrangements have been made with the manu facturers to hold these at the disposal of the Elder Brethren for a few days and on hearing that the India Office wish them to be supplied they could be espatched at once. The remainder could probably be completed in ten to twelve weeks from date of order. ^ 0 Buoys, Unlit. 8. Three buoys of this type are included in the list, with top-marks and moorings complete, viz.:— marks ana T) ” “ ath. class conical buov Bunder Abbas - . -'nd class can buoy. lrem ‘ - 5th class conical buoy. In regard to this proposal I am to state that thp&gt; Tri/mT. e opinion that a 5th class buoy is too Ldl for a nos Hon f it, ' hreU are °f Jask and they consider that a 2nd class bty X lT^ would increase the cost of this part of the scheme bv lOOf from Englfd^Xeir‘cost ffiXdTnl Whf X tft follows : Jask (2nd class) 200Z., Bunder Abbas 2001., Bahrein 100Z 6 ^ Lighthouse Tender. the hope is expressed by Lord^lr^Xthanf rX date&lt; ^ the 2nd March &gt; original estimate of the 'cost of the lighthouse tenderviz^O OiX 116 i' 1 the panying the papers, however, is a letter from the'’' AcC T' Government of India dated thp T i ° the Secreta ry to the dinpions to Which he Royal Indian ^“coTXuIXesRe tXXX for the 6 IWniousfsfrGce! 8 ThereXro 'certai^ paT VeSSelS CHnStructed convenience of tlie officers and crew which ICqin / e various fittm gs for the The sum above mentioned i* pro Eu] abl anc pre pla Ed inf3 tender as would be requisite for tlie duty required, but to supply a vessel to comply with the dimensions given by the Secretary to the Government of India in the letter referred to above would cost considerably more. In view of recent developments in respect of the use of oil fuel and internal combustion engines, it may possibly be desired to consider both these features before definitely deciding on the type of vessel to be supplied. Depot. 10. It is observed that it is now proposed tiiat the depot should be on the property u the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on Abadan Island, in the river Euphrates, instead of at Koweit, as originally suggested. It appears to the Elder Brethren that- this is a matter that the local authorities are better able to decide, it being a question so materially affected by local conditions and facilities; the latter proposal offers the important facility of easily procuring fresh water for lighthouse purposes, thus rendering a distilling plant, as suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, unnecessary. The modified scheme of lights adopted by the Government of India, as compared with the more comprehensive one proposed by the Committee of Enquiry (but which it may be intended eventually to carry out), naturally influences the area of land to be obtained and the form of construction of the buildings, but the Elder Brethren recommend that it possible not less than two acres be secured as a site for the depot which would admit of future developments of the establishment. 11. In paragraph 4 of the India Office letter of the 2nd instant, inquiry is made as to the possibility of substantially reducing the estimated cost of the depot, viz., 22,0001. This estimate included 9,5001. for a spare Light Vessel, and the cost of the essential general spares for the buoys, &amp;c., as mentioned in the statement submitted with this report. The scheme put forward by the Committee of Enquiry included several Light Vessels, in which case a spare ship was, of course, necessary, but as it is understood not to be the practice in India to provide a spare for a single station, the spare vessel might, for the present at least, be dispensed with, and a corresponding saving in cost effected. 12. The Elder Brethren are unaware as to the intentions of the Government of India in regard to the housing of their officers, crew, and workmen at the depot. The authorities in India will themselves be able to prepare estimates to suit their requirements in that respect; but it is considered that, provided no pier work or wharfing is necessary, the requisite storage for lighthouse oil steam coal, carbide, and general stores, workshop, buoy yard, chain lockers &amp;c all of which should be made of iron framing covered by corrugated sheeting, could be established and equipped with the necessary spare acetylene and unlit buoys, spare moorings for Light Vessel and buoys rails, cranes, and trolleys, for a sum well within the balance of 12,o00h, and that, as the lighthouse service in the Gulf increased, the depot accommo dation could be increased to meet tfie additional requirements. 13 14 13 It would be necessary to send from England for the depot the spare buoys’moorings, and 10-ton travelling crane. All corrugated iron buildings, rails, hand cranes, trolleys, workshop equipment, &amp;c, could, it is understood, be obtained at Bombay. 14 With regard to the date for completion, bearing in mind that the various works to be supplied from England would be undertaken by various contractors, the whole of the buoys could be shipped m four months, and the three lighthouses and the Light Vessel m nine months from the date of order. 15, A statement is forwarded herewith showing the works ,t is suggested should be supplied from this country, with estimated cost and other particulars. S. 146. A 21(3. As the work is understood to be urgent, much progress could be made at once by the local authorities in the preparation of the concrete foun dations of the towers, construction of the landing places, keepers’ dwellings, roads, Ac., during which time the iron towers could be under construction in England. 17. in this connection I am to state that the Elder Brethren have at the present time under construction for the Colonial Office an iron tower and third order single flashing light which would be suitable for Tamb Island, and if the matter is very urgent the Elder Brethren would be disposed, if the Marquess of Crewe considers it desirable, to approach the Colonial Office on the subject with a view to the tower and apparatus referred to being utilised for Tamb Island, and the Colonial Office work delayed to some extent. If this were done the material for Tamb Island could be shipped in August. 18. The drawings of the concrete foundations for the three tow r ers will be ready for despatch to the India Office in time for next week’s mail to India. 19. The time for the manufacture of the work for all the lights is based on the ordinary routine of business; but, should the India Office require quicker delivery, no doubt this would be possible if a premium were paid to the various contractors. 20. If it is still desired to hold a Conference on the subject of acquiring a site on Abadan Island for a lighthouse depot, the Elder Brethren will be glad to arrange for a member of this Board, together with their Engineer-in- Chief and Mr. Hood, to attend. The Under Secretary of State for India. I am, &amp;c., H. G. Willett.' From becretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 14t/i May 1912. Foreign Secret. Trinity House letter of 25tli April, sent by mail of 26th April. Lighthouse depot. Do you agree to letter being communicated to Anglo-Persian Oil Company with inquiry whether they can comply with requirements as therein set out. Have you any other observations ? Trinity House to Indja Office. No. B. 1220. Trinity House, London, E.C., Sir, 25th April 1912. With reference to previous correspondence (P. 1149, &amp;c.) on the subject of the lighting scheme for the Persian Gulf, and to the Conference held at the India Office on the 3rd instant, which was' attended by Captain H. Acton Blake, Deputy Master of this Corporation, and Mr. D. W. Hood, of the engineering staff at this House, I am now directed to submit for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India the following observations in regard to the proposed lighthouse depot at Abadan on the River Euphrates in the Persian Gulf. It was ascertained from Mr. Greenway, a Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who was present at the Conference above-mentioned, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on whose property at Abadan it is proposed to establish the lighthouse depot, took over their concession two years ago. The property is situated on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 40 miles from the outer buoy at the Shatt-al-Arab, and about 12 miles below Muhammera, and extends to one square mile, nearly all of which has been fenced in. Extensive oil tanks, refineries, workshops, power houses, &amp;c., have already been established, and more are in contemplation. It is understood that every facility will be offered by the Company to the Government of India for leasing the required area of land for the establishment of a lighthouse depot, and it was proposed by Mr. Greenway that the two acres suggested by the Elder Brethren as necessary for the purpose could be acquired for a term of fifty years (the duration of the Company’s lease of the property) for a small, or even nominal rental. In the letter from the trinity House to the India Office dated 26th March 1912 (Ex. 874), it was suggested that an area of two acres would probably be necessary for the accommodation of the depot, the establishment of which would involve considerable expendituie, as it vas understood that nothing whatever was available for adaptation to lighthouse purposes, but it now appears that this is not the case. As already stated, extensive workshops, largely staffed by Emopean mechanics and fitted with modern tools, have been established, and it has been suggested that an agreement might possibly be arrived at between the Government of India and the Company, whereby all repairs necessary for the working parts of lighthouses, light vessels, and gas buoys, would be executed by the Company’s engineering staff, thus rendering the establishment and equipment of lighthouse workshops unnecessary. It was also assumed that a considerable area would be required, and expense incurred, in providing for the storage of steam coal for the tender. This can, however, be obviated, as already suggested by the Elder Brethren, by the whole or partial use of oil fuel, which can be supplied on the spot; but as the depot will be within a few miles of Muhammera, where a coaling station exists, no provision need be made for extensive coal storage at the depot. S. 153.A carbide store has already been erected, presumably, as Mr. Greenway suggested, in connection with the acetylene buoy already laid at the Shatt-al- Arab. It may, therefore, only be necessary to enlarge it on the establishment of additional buoys. An extensive pier or wharf has already been built at, it is understood a cost of about 20,000Z., alongside of which large steamers can lie, and from which several lines of rails for wagons and trolleys have been laid to various parts of the concession, including the area proposed for the depot, distant about half-a-mile. A small area, it is anticipated, can be acquired for the storage of spare buoys on the river bank in the immediate vicinity of the pier. Provision was also made in the estimates submitted by the Elder Brethren for extensive oil storage tanks. This also may be unnecessary, as Mr. Green way stated his Company can supply any description of oil that may be necessary. In order that this point may be verified, however, which is a most important matter in lighthouse illumination, the following is the specification of ordinary lighthouse oil as used in the Trinity House Service, with which supplies for lighthouse purposes must conform, viz. :— Specific gravity to be not less than 0-810, nor greater than 0-820 at 60° Fahr. ; flashing point not lower than 145°, nor higher than 1G0° Fahr. ; to distil between 302° and 572° Fahr., the temperature of the vapour, not that of the liquid, being taken. W ith the above facilities so readily available, it would now appear that the establishment of a lighthouse depot at Abadan to meet the immediate requirements is a comparatively small matter, and might be restricted to the erection of a storehouse for lighthouse stores, such as cleaning stores, mantles, spare parts, gas buoy lanterns, &amp;c., another for ropes and ship’s stores, and one for engine-room stores. A space is also required for a buoy yard and chain lockers. In regard to the storehouses, one building containing three storerooms and an office of two rooms, with a roomy loft overall, would, it is considered, meet the present requirements. The lighthouse store and engineer’s store room to be each about 15 feet square, and the general store about 40 feet by 15 feet. This building, together with the buoy yard and chain lockers, could, it is believed, be accommodated on a site approximately 100 feet by t)0 feet, or about one-eighth of an acre, which it would perhaps be found possible to procure near the pier. Such ground as would ultimately be found necessary for dwellings, Ac., could be arranged for on the more remote part of the concession near the southern boundary, as proposed by Mr. Greenway, but it would be a great convenience for working if the site could e procured near the pier instead of a position distant half a mile from it. nformation should be obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as to whether they have on their pier a crane capable of lifting 10 tons from bedeck o avesse! alongside; and, if so, whether it is a travelling crane at could be run from the pier into the buoy yard to unload a buov from a ro ley there. It should also be ascertained from the Company what is the gauge of their tramways, and if laid and ballasted to carry heavy loads. n regard to the cost of such a depot, the Elder Brethren would suggest that as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are still carrying out works at the py je as ted for what sum they would be prepared to erect thenecessary buildings as described in this letter, with concrete floors, lay a tramway into the depot from their pier of sufficient gauge to carry a 10-ton load, provide four chain lockers (which are usually brickwork chambers about 10 feet by 6 feet roofed with one end open), and fence in the whole area. If a 10-ton crane and trolley are not already available, they could be provided through the Trinity House at a cost of about eight hundred pounds f.o.b. England. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State H. G. Willett. for India.MINUTE. On file 4898/11 belcw, the Secretary of State in Council approved a letter to the fa ! Foreign Office, dated, the 25th January, setting out for the information of the Treasury the maximum, estim.ate for a complete scheme of Lighting and Buoyage in the Persian Gulf - complete, that is, not in the sense that it was the entire scheme recommended by the expert Committee of 1909, but because it comprised so much of their scheme as had been determined by the India Office, Foreign Office, and Admiralty to be immediately required. Our explanations have generally satisfied, the Treasury, except that they have maintained the objections to the light vessels in the Shatt-al-Arab and Bushire, as to which we had consulted, the Government of India, whose reply S3Ur, H now been received. It will be seen jrom ^ V, f j tvt, 1 . 'i x the drafts that it is proposed to keep the lioht vessel in the Shatt-al-Arab, but to dispense with it at Bushire. The Treasury have accepted the outsioe estimates for the tender (£30,000) and the depot (£22,000) j but as regards the latter at any rate we may hope to effect a saving. the tender, it will be seen, an estimate is being prepared by the Director of the Indian Marine in India 'F With regard to the draft letter to the Trinity House, it may be remarked that the Government of India evidently desire a good deal of assistance from, the Trinity House, see the Viceroy's telegrams of the 2nd and 9th February, 10874. 1.1033. 2000.—5/1911.In any subsequent com munications respecting this letter, please quote the following letter and A The Secretary of the Trinity House begs to acknowledge the receipt of the letter from dated ZyiK^Uuf/&gt; ( which will receive attention.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 6,521, dated the 20th February 1912, requesting his observations on a letter from the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, dated the 13th February, regarding the scheme of lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf, set out in the letter of this Office, dated the 25th January last. In that letter the total expenditure on a complete scheme was estimated not to exceed,— £ Initial - - - - 102,400 Annual, recurring - - - - 7,700 but certain points were noted as awaiting final settlement, viz. : - (Id The provision of a light vessel some four miles to seaward of the British lighted buoy on the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab ; (2.) The substitution of a lighted buoy for a light-vessel at the outer anchorage at Bushire; (3.) The provision of a lighthouse tender ; and (4.) The provision of a lighthouse depot.

As regards (1), it will be seen that the Government of India still share the view originally expressed in the letter of the Naval Oommander-in-Chief dated the 25th February 1911, and supported in the letter addressed by the Admiralty to the Foreign Office on the 20th May 1911, that the lightship in the Shatt-al-Arab is necessary, and that the substitution of a lighted buoy, as suggested by the Lords Commissioners, would be impracticable in that locality through the risk of its possible extinction. In this view the Marquess of Crewe concurs, and he trusts that, on the further explanations now given, the Lords Commissioners will agree to waive their objection to this item of the programme. 3 With regard to (2), the Government of India agree in the proposed substitution ofthe lighted buoy lor the lightship at Bushire, and it is proposed /4&gt; arrange accordingly. 4 The questions of the lighthouse tender (3), and the depot (4), are dealt with in the letter addressed to the Trinity House, dated the 2nd instant.

India Office, 2nd March 1912. Sir, In continuation of the lettej from this Office, dated the 27th February 1912, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state, for the confidential information of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, that as a result of correspondence with the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Treasury, it has now been decided, subject only to the assent of the last-named Department in respect of the light-vessel for the Shatt-al- Arab, to provide and maintain in the Persian Gulf the lights and buoys set out in the list enclosed. 2. In reply to an inquiry by the Secretary of State as to the plant to be ordered from this country, the Government of India have suggested in a telegram, dated the 9th February, that Mr. J). W. Hood should be asked to advise, since no definite information is in their own possession as to the designs and requirements of the several lights and buoys beyond what is contained in Mr. Hood’s Report. The Marquess of Crewe would be greatly obliged if this suggestion could be acted on, and a statement be prepared for transmission to the Government of India showing in the case of each item of the list, whether lighthouse, light-vessel, or lighted or unlit buoy, what plant it would seem best to procure and send out from England. 3. In addition to the lights and buoys, the questions of a lighthouse tender and of a depot, have also been considered. It has been found impracticable to adapt as a tender any existing vessel, and, subject to further consideration when an accurate estimate has been framed, the Government of India have recommended the construction of a sepai ate tender, foi which, it is undei stood, the Director of the Royal Indian Marine is now preparing an estimate. The estimate of Mr. Hood was, it will be remembered, 30,000£. for initial, and 5,0001. for annual recurring expenditure, but Lord Crewe proposes to draw attention to the desirability of effecting a reduction in these figures, and meanwhile he would be glad to learn, for the assistance of the Govern ment of India in preparing their estimate, on what data Mr. Hood s estimate was prepared, and whether, in view of the more moderate scheme that has now been decided on, the Elder Brethren are of opinion that a smaller and less expensive tender might be sufficient. 4. With regard to the lighthouse depot, I am to enquire whether the sum of 22 000Z. allowed for in Mr. Hood’s estimate cannot also now be substantially reduced. Both the Secretary of State and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are desirous of confining the scheme to the barest requirements of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and they hope that some The Secretary to the Elder Brethren, Trinity House, E.C,2 economy may be practicable as regards the depot. It would be convenient if a list of the plant to be stored in the depot, with estimates^ could also be supplied. 5. As regards the location of the depot, it has recently been suggested by the Government of India that this should be on land acquired by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Abadan Island, instead of at Koweit, as proposed by the Committee. A further communication will be made to you upon this subject, but it would be convenient if meanwhile particulars could be prepared, to be discussed if necessary at an informal conference, of the extent of land that would be required for the purpose, and the works to be installed. 6.

As regards points raised in your telegram of 16th November. Admiral urges dangers to vessels approaching Shat-el-Arab bar from seaward in the event of unwatched light in outer position going out without being noticed, and considers if any light is placed in seaward position it must be a lightship! We concur. There is no objection to substitution of lighted buoy for light-vessel proposed for Bushire, as if buoy w^ere extinguished fact would be noticed from shore and remedied at once. With regard to suggestion in your telegram of 24th January, although location of British gas buoy and Turkish light-ship at same spot is not necessary, we are of opinion it is important on principle that we should for the present maintain our own arrangements independently of Turks, and as Admiral considers that navigation is sufficiently provided for as things stand, w'e deprecate any change at this juncture.

This letter gives the first statement which My Lords have received as to the total expenditure which is involved in the scheme as a v/hole and the explanations contained therein have removed the mis- conceptlon under which They had hitherto laboured ow ing to the mistaken belief that the proposals contained in India Office letter of 18th November last might be taken as being to some extent in substitution of rather than supplementary to the scheme set out in the previous India Office letter of September 18th. Whilst regret ting this misunderstanding. My Lords cannot but feel that when a costly and complicated scheme is submitted for The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. r COPY TO U'.KTA ! 1 MAR 1912 ! FBOHETAnY’o M2 ^for the approval of Secretary Sir E. Grey and of this Board, its presentation in instalments is calculated to lead to confusion and militates against proper criticism of the details. For this reason They are glad to he now for the first time in possession of the entire scheme and of the Report of the Committee on the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf dated 29th April 1909. From the information now before Them My Lords note that the total capital charges for lighting and buoyage are estimated not to exceed £102,400 and that the annual recurring charges will amount to about £7,700. The above estimate of capital expenditure includes an item of about £ 22,000 for the provision of a Depot for the maintenance of the lights and buoys and India Office letter of the 25th ultimo is the first Indication My Lords have received of the necessity for this large addition to the capital expenditure involved in undertaking these services in the Persian Gulf. They recognise, however, that if such services be undertaken, a Dep&amp;t is indispensable but They do not understandr 9 V ) understand why this was not pointed out in the first instance• As regards the purchase of a Lighthouse tender My Lords are not clear whether the project of employing in its stead the 'Patrick Stewart' has heen definitely abandoned but from the enclosures to Foreign Office letter of the 30th November last (4628]/ll) it would appear that the difficulties of employing this vessel and the expense involved are so great that the purchase of a tender would be the preferable course. If in the opinion of Sir E. Grey and the Marquess of Crewe this be the case. My Lords are prepared to accept as a charge on the British Exchequer a moiety of the cost of pur- chase (not exceeding £30,000) of a tender and of up* i keep, as well as a moiety of the cost of a DepSt. They trust, however, that In both cases the strictest regard will he had to economy In capital expenditure. As regards the provision of Lighthouses and buoys They are also prepared, subject to the general stipu lations contained In Their letter of the 28th October last (18S27/11), to agree to the proposals contained 'provide Light Ships at Shatt-el-Arab and Bushire. In reference to Shatt-el-Arab I am again to call attention to the observations contained in Treasury let ter of 28th October last, to which no answer is made in the India Office letter of the 25th ultimo: My Lords gather from the correspondence forwarded with Foreign Office letter of the 11th October last that there is already at the outer bar of Shatt-el-Arab an acetylene gas buoy, and as to the utility of this buoy I am to refer to the Report of the Officer Commanding Royal Indian Marine Ship Palinurus dated May 7th 1911 f ■ ” ■ ' ' ■ ■ ■ (24274 Eastern Department Secret Series) in which he says that the buoy is visible at a distance of 7 nauti cal miles in clear weather and was once observed at a distance of 10 miles and that it enables vessels to &gt;• make their entrance at night. In view of these facts and the urgent necessity for keeping expenditure to as low a figure as possible My Lords feel bound to press for a reconsideration of this part of the scheme• If it be considered desirable My Lords would not object to the provision of a further light buoy at Shatt-el-ArabAs regards the proposal to have a light vessel stationed in the outer anchorage at Bushire, 'besides the light 'buoy in the inner anchorage at that place. My Lords must again call Sir E. Grey's attention»to the statement of Rear Admiral Sir E. Slade quoted in Their letter of the 28th October last. They are now aware * that the Committee of 1909 reported in favour of a light ship hut Admiral Slade's experience is of later date and he has had the advantage of seeing the light buoy at Shatt-el-Arab in operation. In the case therefore of Bushire My Lords would urge the substitution of a light buoy for a light ship. If light buoys be used here and at Shatt-el-Arab there will be a saving of £17,800 in * • capital expenditure and of £1220 in recurrent charges. Even with such a saving the total expenditure, representing a capital cost of over £ 80,000 with annual recurring charges of about £6,500, can only be Justified by imperative considerations of policy and it is solely in deference to Sir E. Grey's urgent representations that My Lords have felt able to acquiesce in accepting such a heavy financial responsibility. They must, however, ask that\0 s that only such works he undertaken as permit of no delay or modification. In the scheme as now put for/yard My Lords see little indication that the necessity of economy laUf ,0^ has been borne in mind, and indeed the total sums involved i shew a comparatively small decrease from the cost of the original proposals referred to in Foreign Office secret K letter of 13th May 1910 which Sir E. Grey and Lord Morley 4 l ' r ’ll i (A lit then refused to entertain. My Lords feel therefore the * C* more Justified in asking that the modifications They have L* n r suggested in connection with Bushire and Shatt-el-Arab ?&gt;!&gt; 0* i/0 should be accepted and that every endeavour should be made to effect further economies in the provision for the building of light-houses, &amp;c.

Sir:- I have the honour to enclose a photograph, kindly supplied me by Mr. Denne, 1st Officer of the Steamship ,, Dumra ,, , of the Turkish light ship, (the old Kilid el Bahr) stationed at the outer bar about 18 miles from Fao, showing a five second revolving light, visible about 10 miles away in ordinary weather but, on excep tionally clear nights such as December 6th last, when I passed her, visible at 16 miles. The Commander of the 'Durara” informed me that this light was of great use to navigation, but as it is anchored about half a mile from the British gas buoy, there are now two lights at the outer bar, and this is unnecessary. The Commander seemed to think that, as the Turkish Authorities had placed their light vessel to mark the entrance to the shallows, the British gas buoy would serve a more useful purpose if removed to the position now occupied by the old outer bar buoy, that is, I be lieve, about 2 miles riverwards from the light ship. His Excellency The Right Honourable q 0 dy T ns &lt; M n IA 26 JAN 1912 Sir Gerard A. Lov/ther, G.C.M.G., C.B p EC ! i ^ T ARY ° T:as at present it appears to be eclipsed by the Turk ish light ship; and he stated that, if this sugges tion were carried out, it would be possible for ships to negotiate the bar on the darkest night, while now. unless there is a moon, the vessel runs a risk of fouling the buoys or going ashore on a bad place. I give these suggestions for v/hat they are worth but they appear to me reasonable. The numerous Turk ish and British buoys no doubt make navigation diffi cult on dark nights, and as two lights now exist, it seems a mistake to put them so close together. I have &amp;c.. (Signed) F.E. CrowSECRET. India Office, 25th January 1912. Sir. I am directed by the Secretary oF State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 51,281, dated the 29th December last, requesting his observations on a letter from the Treasury, dated the 21st idem, regarding the expenditure on a scheme of lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. In icply, I am to remark that the course of the recent correspondence is not accurately represented in the Treasury letter, and, in particular, the Secretary of State for India does not understand the allusion to “the disciepant and Aaijmg statements as to the places where provision of buoyage, &amp;c., is of primary importance.” 3. In the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September last, it was recommended that sanction shonld be given to expenditure amounting, according to the most accurate data obtainable, to— £ Initial - - . - . 47,600 Annual, recurring - - _ _ g qpQ for the provision of— (1) an acetylene gas buoy, and one light-vessel in the Shatt-al-Arab; (2) lighthouses at Musandim, Tanb Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island ; and (3) a light-vessel for Bushire. It was also explained (in paragraph 4) that some additional buoys might be necessary, as to which enquiry was being made in a telegram addressed to the Government of India on the 13th September. 4. The second letter of this Office, dated the 18th November last, supple mented the first by recommending that the buoys in question (of which a list was given) should be actually laid, at an estimated cost of— £ Initial - - - - - 2,800 Annual, recurring - - - _ _ 210 For convenience of reference, prints of the two letters' :!: ' are herewith enclosed * Letter of 15th September 1911, with Leita- of November 1911, with list ,, 5 ' With re g ard to what is said in the of buoys. Treasury letter as to the lighting of (In duplicate). Bushire, I am to invite attention to paragraph 9 of the Report of the Committee, dated the 29th April 1909, from which it will be seen that they recommended— (1) a light-vessel at the outer anchorage ; (2) a lighted buoy at the inner anchorage. The former w r as included in the statement enclosed in the letter of this Office, dated the 15th September, the latter in the list of buoys accompanying the letter of the 18th November. In their letter of the 28th October last, the Lords Commissioners raised the question whether a light buoy could not be substituted for the light-vessel proposed at the outer anchorage at The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.9 Bushire, but the question of the light buoy at the inner anchorage, recom mended in the telegram of the Government of India, dated the 30th September last, was not thereby affected. No authority can be discovered for the statement of the Lords Commissioners that “ Bushire alone requires one lighted buoy as a matter of urgency.” On the contrary, it clearly appears from the telegram which they themselves quote, that such buoys are urgently required at Bahrein and Bunder Abbas as well, as is also shown in the list enclosed in my letter of 18th November. 6. The Secretary of State trusts that the foregoing explanations will remove the misapprehension which now exists. He concurs in the view that it is desirable that, so far as possible, His Majesty’s Government should be in possession of a complete scheme of the lighting and buoyage of the Gulf before the project is actually proceeded with, but he trusts he has made it plain that in my letters of the 15th September and the 18th No vember, taken in connection with the previous correspondence, they already had such a scheme before them. There is only one item of the recommenda tions made by the Committee of 1909 which has not been discussed in the telegrams from the Government of India or the letters addressed to your Department, viz., the provision of a depot for the maintenance of the lights and buoys. As your Department is aware, the cost of the depot was wa s estimated at 23,000/. by Mr. Hood in his Supplementary Report dealing with the financial aspects of the Committee’s proposals. The matter has not been touched upon since because it was necessary, in the first instance, to settle the particular lights and buoys for the maintenance of which the depot would be required. As the Committee’s scheme for lighting and buoyage was on a larger scale than that now proposed, it may be hoped that the cost of the depot will be less than the original estimate of 28,000/. * Dated 23rd January 1912. l )0 ^ nt * S With in the telegram* addressed to the Government of India, of which copy is transmitted. It will thus be seen that the only part of the scheme which has not been put before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in my letter of 15th September, supplemented by that of the 18th November, is the depot. i.

Sir Your most obedient humble Servant, ie Under Secretary of State, India Office.IS py- 060 n. 1284^ in TREASURY CHAIvIBERS. 2l8t December 1911. Sir: - I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr .Mallet’s letter of the 50th ul timo (4628l/ll), together with a copy of a letter from the India Office dated November 18th which accompanied it, further respecting the buoyage and lighting of the Persian Gulf. My Lords gather from the India Office letter that the Secretary of State for India in Council is now of opinion that the places in the Persian Gulf where lighting and buoyage are most required are Bahrein, Bushire, Bunder Abbas and Jask, and They note that the financial provision for these purposes would amount to an initial expenditure of £2,800 with a recurrent charge of £210 per annum. It will be within the. recollection of Secretary Sir E.Grey that in Foreign Office letter of the 11th October last (36606 Secret), he, acting in accordance 1 ie Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. Iwith the information furnished him by the India Office, represented to Their Lordships the importance of pro viding for buoyage and lighting at Shat-el-Arab, Musandim, Tarnb Island, Sheikh Shuaib and Bushire on the gro^ind that at these places exceptional circumstances rendered a provision of this character most urgently necessary, and in Their reply of the 28th October last (18927/11), My Lords with certain modifications, sanc tioned the proposals put forward on the express under standing that the measures suggested were of urgent and pressing necessity and that exceptional considerations from an international point of view had to be taken into account. It would now appear from the telegram dated Sep tember 30th last from the Government of India that of the places referred to in Foreign Office letter (36606 Secret) Bushire alone requires one lighted buoy as a matter of urgency, and incidentally I am to point out that in Their letter of 26th October last My Lords had urged the substitution of a buoy for a light-ship which had been suggested by the India Office as requiredrequired at that place. Apart, however, from this particular point, I am to state that My Lords cannot hut regard as highly unsatisfactory the whole method in which these proposals have been placed before Sir E.Grey and Themselves and, in view of the discrepant and vary ing statements as to the places where provision of buoyage &amp;c., is of primary importance. They are not disposed to sanction as a charge on the Exchequer the moiety of the expenditure proposed in the letter under reply and They must further request that no action sh be taken on the provisional sanction conveyed in Thei letter of the 26th October to the undertaking of When Their Lordships are placed In possession ol what may be taken as final and reasoned proposals for the lighting of the Persian Gulf, They will be prepared to give them Their careful consideration and, if necessary to sanction a moderate expenditure for the purpose. Sir E.Grey is aware of Their Lordships' reluctances (which They feel sure he shares with Them) to burthen the British Taxpayer with expenditure for various works referred to therein. purposespurposes so apparently remote and, in Their view, the sole justification for undertaking such charges must be imperative considerations of a political or cornner- cial character. On the conflicting evidence before Them They are not satisfied to what places in the Persian Gulf these considerations apply.

(Pol. 4013/1911 ; copy sent to Foreign Office and Admiralty, 10th August 1911.) Scope of the Memorandum. 1. The question of the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf is part of the larger question of British polic}^ in the Gulf and neighbourhood, which is outside the scope of the present Memo randum. It is enough to remark that the advance of the Bagdad Railway and the activity of Turkey in the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab have recently brought the lighting and buoyage question into greater prominence. For some -SO years the buoyage of the Gulf has been maintained by British enterprise, namely that of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and now that it seems likely that railway communication will be opened with the Persian Gulf via Asia Minor, it is urged with some force that Great Britain, the predominant maritime Power, should in the interests of British and Indian trade endeavour to improve communication with the head of the Gulf by sea. There are many references in our papers to the difficulties of navi gation in the Gulf, especially by night, owing to incomplete surveys and defective lighting and buoyage.

Letter of Admiralty to India Office, 1st October 1908. Pol. 3881/08. 2. The question of lighting and buoyage first came up in a practical form when a proposal was made by the Hamburg-American Company, in the early part of 1907, that they should contribute to the upkeep of the navigation buoys maintained in the Gulf by the British India Steam Navigation Company. It w r as believed that a political motive lay behind the proposal, and the suggestion was therefore made that the British Government should itself take over the buoys from the British India Company. An Inter-Departmental Conference' held at the Admiralty on the 17th July 1908, recommended in their Report, dated the 19th September 1908, that this action should be taken, and, further, that lights and buoys should be provided on an extended scale at Muscat and S. 126. Avarious places in the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, the Government of India had independently re commended the holding of a local enquiry with the same object, and their proposal received the approval of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, from whose Report, dated the 26th January 1909, the following is an extract :— Department (Secret), No. 156,13th August 1908. Pol. 1646/08. “ 4. Lighthouses and Buoyage. “ While it is desirable that, if the British “ shipowning Companies press for additional “ navigational lights in the Gulf, all reasonable “ steps should be taken to meet their wishes, yet, in “ view r of the limited volume of the trade at present, “ the Committee do not recommend that any “ considerable expenditure that could not be “ recouped by light dues should be incurred under “ this head. But they are of opinion that it w r ould “ be worth while to incur the expenditure involved “ in the proposal now under consideration, to send “ a Commission to collect information, consisting “ of the Senior Naval Officer, the officer in charge “ of the Indian Marine Survey, and an expert to be “ obtained through the Trinity House. This “ Commission would also deal with the question of “ buoyage. This proposal has the support of the “ Inter-Departmental Committee (Foreign Office, “ India Office, and Admiralty). The cost will be “ that of the expert and incidental expenses; “ the other tw r o officers receiving no extra pay.” The Treasury afterwards agreed to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of the cost of the enquiry.

The question of estimates was dealt with in a Supplementary Report by Mr. D. W. Hood, the expert in lighthouse construction, whose services on the Committee had been obtained from the Trinity House. The Summary with which his Report concluded is printed as Appendix IT, and,, in view of subsequent correspondence, it is useful to note the cost of two items in particular, viz., 30,0007.. initial, and 5,0007. annual recurring, for a new lighthouse tender, and 22,0007. initial, for a depot at Koweit. The general financial effect of his estimates is apparent in the following extract from a letter addressed by the India Office to the Admiralty on the 1st September in reply to one of the 7th August in which the Admiralty had commented on the Committee’s own Report:— “ It will be seen that, apart from any expendi- “ ture on the purchase of land for lighthouses or “ for other works, the cost of the entire scheme “ proposed by the Committee, including the pro- il vision of a lighthouse tender, is estimated by “ Mr. Hood at 158,1507. initial, and 10,7457. annual “ recurring expenditure or, if certain savings are “ effected by the conversion of a Royal Indian “ Marine vessel into a lighthouse tender and by “ modifications in the system of lighting, at “ 107,5007. initial, and 9,2807. annual recurring u expenditure. The cost of an alternative scheme “ on a smaller scale, to include provision of the “ lights recommended in paragraph 7 of the Com- mittee’s Report as those most urgently required, “ is estimated at 120,5507. initial, and 8,7207. annual “ recurring expenditure—or, if savings of the kind a mentioned above are effected, at 92,3007. initial “ and 8,5157. annual recurring expenditure. _ “ The expenditure involved in the Committee s “ recommendations, even when limited to the “ smaller scheme, is very considerable. It was “ clearly laid down by Lord Morley, in the letter to the Foreign Office of the 22nd Decembei 1908, “ proposing the appointment of the Committee, that “ the question of giving effect to its recommenda- “ tions must be governed by financial considera- “ tions, and the Lords Commissioners of the “ Treasury, in their letter to the Foreign Office of “ the 27th January 1909, were unable to hold out £t any prospect of a contribution from the Butish “ Exchequer towards the cost of any lights. In “ these circumstances, and in view of the necessity a for rigid economy m Indian finance, Lord Morley “ is not prepared to consider at present the question “ 0 f giving effect to the Committee’s recommenda- “ tions. He proposes, subject to any observations “ the Lords Commissioners may have to offer, to u inform the Gfovernmeut of India accoidmgly. A copy of the letter addressed to the Admiralty was forwarded to the Foreign Office with a request for their observations.4 5. In reply, the Foreign Office concurred in the view that it was impossible at the moment to carry into effect the full scheme recommended by the Committee, but they urged as a first step the taking over of the buoys of the British India Company. The Admiralty also agreed, and, after some further correspondence, the assent of the Treasury was obtained to the equal division between British and Indian revenues of the estimated expenditure involved in this proposal, viz., I,000L initial as payment to the Company, and 135b 6s. Sd. annual recurring, in respect of future maintenance. The deed of assignment that was ultimately executed on the 9th February 1911 provided for the transfer to Government of the full number of 15 buoys and one beacon (at Bahrein) that had belonged to the Company, on the understanding that a portion of the sum of 1,000b should be refunded later, in view of the fact that certain buoys had been reported as missing at the time when the deed was executed. It was arranged that for the future the buoys should be maintained by the Royal. Indian Marine, who were also to be responsible for replacing the missing buo t ys except one—the “ Lawrence ” buoy—that was no longer required owing to the shifting of the Shatt-al-Arab channel.

During the time when the transfer of these buoys to Government was being arranged, reports were furnished by His Majesty’s Consul of meetings held at Basrah on the 21st and 28th June 1910, at which the local German community had supported projects for the lighting and buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab by Turkish agency. Further, the Turkish Com modore stated that he would ask his Government to undertake the lighting of Fao and the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab without any charge on shipping. At the instance of Colonel Cox, it was decided as a counter-measure to place an acetylene gas buoy on the outer bar, at a cost estimated not to exceed 600b initial, plus 40b annual re curring, in respect of maintenance. Of this expenditure the Treasury agreed to defray a moiety as before, the political aspect of the matter being strongly urged on them by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 0 The placing of the buoy was expedited on news being received from Con stantinople that a scheme for buoying and lighting the Shatt-al-Arab had been submitted to the Turkish Minister of Marine. 7. A further development took place a little later when the Commander of the Turkish guard- ship in the Shatt-al-Arab declared that he had categorical instructions to lay down buoys and that the matter had been rendered urgent by the constant complaints of German vessels. Instruc tions were thereupon issued by the Government of India to the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the British buoys should be laid down without regard Activity of Turkey in the Shatt-al- Arab, and laying down of a British lighted buoy.

The activity of the Turkish authorities still continued. Reports were received of their plans for supplying pilots at the mouth of the Shatt-al- Arab, for h lighthouse at Fao, a light-vessel near the outer bar, and the laying of further buoys. The chart, referred to at the head of this memo randum, which accompanied a letter of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, dated the loth May last, shows the situation at last arrived at. According to this information there are now in the Shatt-al-Arab live Turkish buoys and one Turkish light vessel, while the British buoys are seven in number, of which one is the lighted gas buoy referred to in paragraph 6. According to a telegram from the Naval Com- mander-in-Ohief, dated the 22nd April last, the position of these lights and buoys is as follows :— — British Buoys. Turkish. Buoys. i Light Vessel. High seas - 5 2 1 Turkish waters 1 3 — Persian waters 1 — The Turks, it may be added, have issued formal notices to Mariners regarding their lights and buoys, and have even been reported from time to time to be intending to tamper with the British buoys. Quite recently we have heard also of Turkish proposals for the dredging of the Shatt-al- Arab bar. The Conservancy of the Shatt-al- Arab. Memorandum to Turkish Government, 29th July 1911.

The whole question of the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab was thus forced to the front, and in a letter to the Government of India, dated the 24th March last, the Naval Commander-in-Chief reported that the situation was becoming an impossible one:—“The only solution,” he continued, “would “ appear to be the formation of an international “ commission on which Turkey, Persia and Great “ Britain would be represented .... It may “ prove necessary to admit German and Russian “ representatives on the conservancy, but I am “ strongly of opinion that this would be a lesser “ evil than to allow the Turks to have the imcon- “ trolled management of the waterway. It is unnecessary here to follow the course of the corre- spondencej that ensued upon the Admiral’s sug-G gestion. The decision ultimately arrived at hy His Majesty’s Government is defined in the following extract from a memorandum communicated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 29th July last' ::: ‘: — “ Certain difficulties have recently arisen in “ regard to the buoyage of the Shatt-al-Arab. For “ a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the “ work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the ^ river has been carried out by British agency to “ the general satisfaction of all concerned. “ In these circumstances, His Majesty's Govern- “ ment have some difficulty in appreciating why the ( Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, ^ being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a ^ spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the “ Ottoman Government the appointment of a small iiveram commission, comprised of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be t . wmtually agreed upon. This commission would ^ supei intend all matters pertaining - to improvement navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. “ As regards the rest a£ the Persian Gulf, on the £( °fTer hand, the Turkish Government, so far as r{ ^hey ar e concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, u buoying, and pilotage; (6) to police its waters ; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements.” 10. It is proposed now to describe in greater detail the projects at present before His Majesty’s Government for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. O'? f et . ter to Government of India, dated the 2oth February 1011 » it was strongly urged by he Vaval Commander-m-Chief that certain of the lights and buoys that had been recommended by the Committee of enquiry should be provided with- out delay Correspondence ensued between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the India Office with the result that on the 15th September last a wTG t -°I 16Forei g u °fficerequesting that the Treasury might be moved to accept as a charge against British revenues a moiety of expen diture, estimated according the most accurate data obtainable at— £ 47,600 2,490 Initial Annual recurring - for the provision of— • J 1 ) An aeetykne gas buoy and one light-vessel m the Shatt-al-Arab ; vtssei T.

In a letter dated the 28th October 1911, the Treasury drew attention to certain points in con nection with the scheme, but expressed their readiness to bear a moiety of the charges connected with the provision of the acetylene gas buoy in the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the lighthouses at Musandam, Tanb Island, and Sheikh Shuaib Island. They questioned, on the other hand, the necessity of the light-vessel'^' proposed for the Shatt-al-Arab, and urged the substitution of a light-buoy')' for a light- vessel* at Bushire, in view of certain observations made in Admiral Slade’s letters to the Admiralty and the Government of India, dated the 11th May and 6th August respectively, which seemed to indicate that less expensive proposals might suffice. Correspondence is still proceeding with the Government of India as regards the suggestions made by the Treasury, also as to the provision and cost of tiie lighthouse tender. Another item of expenditure that must apparently also be provided for is that of the depot which the Committee recommended should be located at Koweit for gas-works, the storage of buoys, &amp;c. In Mr. Hood’s estimates a capital sum of 22,0001. was entered on this account, but presumably the expenditure will be considerabfy less in view of the more restricted character of the lighting and buoyage proposals now under consideration. In any case no allowance need be made in respect of the maintenance of the depot, since charges on this account are included in the estimates given in Mr. Hood’s Report of the cost of the several lights. Summary of maximum possible 12. Assuming, for the sake of completeness, that expenditure. the lights and buoys recommended in the letters of the India Office of the 15th September and 18th November 1911 (see paragraph 10 above) were all provided (without the adoption of the Treasury suggestions), that a lighthouse tender w r ere procured at a cost of 30,000h initial, and 5,000L annual re curring, and that a depot were equipped at the full8 ! capital cost of 22,000L, the resulting expenditure would amount to— £ Initial - - - _ 102,400 Annual recurring - - 7,700 It will be noted that a large proportion of this expenditure, both initial and annual, is represented by the cost of the lighthouse tender. 13. At this point mention may be made of two projects which though not directly connected with the subject of this Memorandum may yet entail considerable expenditure of a somewhat similar kind. In the first place, it is proposed to carry out certain surveys in the Persian Gulf that may entail the employment of a Royal Indian Marine vessel for several years. The Government of India have been asked for information as to the cost and duration of the operations, in order that the Treasury may be approached as to bearing a moiety of the charge. Secondly, the provision of wireless telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf has recently' been considered, and, subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office, the Secretary of State in Council has approved a scheme estimated to cost approximately 19,087Z. initial, and 4,647Z. annual recurring. This expenditure also would be equally divisible between British and Indian Revenues. 14. The question whether any part of the expenditure to be incurred in the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf could be recouped by means of the levy of light dues has frequently been raised in oui conespondence, but the matter presents great difficulties, and it has been strongly urged that the inception of the lighting and buoy age scheme should not be delayed pending a satisfactory solution.* In a letter| dated the 29th March last, the Foreign Office wrote as follows on this subjectThe suggested levy could not be 1 carried out without the consent of the Powers Two connected questions(1) Sur veys; ( 2 ) Wireless Telegraph Instal lations.

Treasury to Foreign Office. — {Received October 30.) gi r&gt; Treasury Chambers, October 28, 1911. I HAVE laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Air. Mallet’s letter of the 31th instant, enclosing copy of a letter, dated the 15th September, from the India Office and a file of correspondence between various depart ments of State relative to proposals for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. My Lords note that these proposals, if accepted in their entirety, will necessitate an early capital expenditure of a moiety of 47,600/., together with a recurrent annual charge of half the maintenance charges, estimated at 2,490/., in respect of the light houses, light-vessels, and buoys proposed for Shatt-el-Arab, Musandim, Tamb Island, Sheikh Shuaib, and Bushire. ' In addition, there is also a project for the purchase ot a liMit-house tender, at a capital cost of 30,000/. and maintenance charges cf 5,000/ per annum, but it is possible that the necessity for this may be obviated by the employ ment of the cable-steamer “ Patrick Stewart,” at a cost, my Lords gather, of not less than 600/. per annum. , My Lords feel sure that Secretary Sir Edward Grey will be m full agreemen with them in viewing with grave apprehension the undertaking of such heavy financial responsibilities as are now suggested. Large, too, as are the present demands, t icie appears little prospect, judging by the correspondence forwarded with the letter under reply, that they may be regarded as final. Further proposals for surveying and oi the provision of light-houses, &amp;c., at other places in the Gulf seem more than probable, and my Lords therefore feel obliged at the outset to stipulate that if, m dereiemo o the Secretary of State’s strong representations, they acquiesce in some modified scheme, their assent is to be understood as only given where the circumstances are exceptional from an international point of view, and it must not be construed as an acceptance ot the policy of throwing upon the British taxpayer an indefinite burthen for the purpose of the general lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf. now’ My Lords would be glad to be informed whether the Secretary of State s state- 9 ment, that time does not permit of an international agreement being arrived at, whereby by means of dues the cost for lighting, &amp;c., might be recovered, is to be taken ^ as precluding the possibility of an understanding between this country, ruikey and | Persia, with such an object in view as regards, at any rate, Shatt-el-Aiab. Sir E. Gie} is aware that a suggestion on these lines was made m the report of the sub-committee of the Imperial Defence Committee, and my Lords apprehend that, nothing is done in this direction until after the completion of the proposed works, the difficulty u introducing a system cf dues may be enhanced. , My Lords will now proceed to deal with the separate proposals, and I am to say ' that on the understanding that the provision of light-houses at Musandim, Iamb Island and Sheikh Shuaib is of urgent and pressing necessity they are willing that half the cost of construction and of maintenance charges shall be boime y ic Exchequer. This will involve a capital expenditure for this country of 14 000/. an qnnnM charge of 575/. My Lords also agree to the provision of one acetylene gas W afintr C S^tt-el-Aab, in respect of which a capital cost of 3001. and an arnual charge of 20/. will fall on Motes. T . , As regards the provision of a light-vessel at Shatt-el-Arab, my Lords are not convinced that the heavy expenditure involved is necessary. J hey observe t.iat it is proposed that this vessel should be stationed about 4 miles to seaward ot the outer lai buoy at Shatt-el-Arab, as a Turkish light-vessel is or will probably be stationed near the^buoy In Rear-Admiral Sir E. Slade’s letter to the Admiralty, dated May 11, IQII hef states that a British vessel is “ not absolutely necessary, though both he and the Admiralty think it desirable. My Lords, however, cannot feel that a sufficient y strono r cSSS has been made out for the purchase of this vessel, at a cost of 9,500/. anc charges for upkeep of 650/. per annum, and they would urge that the proposal e abandone suggested that there should be a light-vessel at Bushire. Its cost and [2232 gg 2] \ /2 upkeep are the same as in the above case. My Lords, however, note that in his letter of the 6th August, 1911, to the Government of India, Rear-Admiral Sir E. Slade states as follows : “ Erom the experience gained of the light-buoy now established on the outer bar of the Sbatt-el-Arab, it would seem that a similar buoy at Bushire in tin outer anchorage would equally well serve all the purposes of navigation at the latter port.” The admiral goes on to say that a light-vessel wmuld add more to British I - prestige than a light-buoy, but my Lords, wTiilst attaching due weight to this consider ation, cannot but feel that it scarcely justifies the enormous disparity in cost of purchase and upkeep between a light-vessel and a buoy. They are willing to agree to the purchase of a buoy, fitted as described in Admiral Slade’s letter, and they trust that this modification of the original proposal may meet with the Secretary of State’s support in view of the urgent necessity for economy. My Lords think that it would be premature to express their views as regards the second category of the proposals having reference to a light tender. They would he most reluctant to sanction so large an expenditure as 30,000/. for this purpose, with the high annual charge of 5,000/., and they trust that it may be found possible to employ the “ Patrick Stewart,” as has been suggested. If this be done, they are prepared to provide for half the expenses of hiring. I am, &amp;c. ROBERT CHALMER.‘ ■ X Ulai e ?

Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copy of a letter from the India Office, dated the 15th September, respecting a proposal for the buoyage and lio-hting of the Persian Gulf. I also transmit herewith, for their Lordships information, a complete file of the correspondence that has passed on this subject between this Office, the Admiralty, and the India Office, the_ Indian Government, His Majesty’s political resident and consul-general in the Persian Gulf, and the otticer in command of the British squadron in those waters. This correspondence will make clear the urgency and importance of the proposed undertaking from the point of view of British interests, and it will be seen that the various authorities concerned are unanimous in concurring in the view of Secretary Sir L. Grey, that this necessary work should be immediately undertaken by British enterprise with _ a view to forestalling similar action by another Power, which could not fail prejudicial^ to affect the whole of the position of this country m the Persian Gull. Sir E. Grey therefore trusts that the Lords Commissioners will accept a moiety of the charges, necessary for the execution of the projected work, as a charge agains British revenues, the other moiety being borne by the Government of India. I am to explain that the immediately necessary charges amount, as will be seen from tl e Office letter to 50,090L With regard to the second category of charges mentioned m paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned letter, the possibility of employing the cable- steamer^ Patrick Stewart ” in lieu of a new tender is still under consideration, and a further communication will be addressed to you as soon t) f ^fX^iLTonOTS In arrive at a decision. Sir E. Grey hopes, however, that the Lords Commissioners will also sanction in principle the charges necessary for the carrying out of the second half of this programme, which has been reduced to the narrowest practicable limits on ffie imderstaiidnig that’the charges to be incurred under this category will be kept at a 5 * low a fiorire as shall be compatible with efficiency. •,, _ I am further to add that it was at first proposed to co-ordinate this wnrk with a detailed survey of the Persian Gulf. Since, however, it now appears likely that this latter task will occupy over four years, if adequately performed, it has seemed necessary to proceed with the more urgent part of the programme of buoyage a r El'™^without further delay. If it should eventually be found possible to recover he chaLIs which the Lords Commissioners are now asked to sanction, by anarrange- knt for tto collection of shipping dues, Sir E. Grey would not fail to give he mat er his serious consideration. But it is obvious that such an arrangement would involve previous international negotiations, and, in the circumstances, key’m IbS, afforded, eith i be able to take this request into their early and favourable consideration.^ ’LOUIS MALLET P S.-I am “= kTs'wrte?

I have had an interview with Mr.Hood at Trinity House and discussed with him the question of i:he employment of this Department's cable ship the 'Patrick Stewart' as a lighthouse tender in connection with the proposed scheme for lighting and buoyage in the Persian Gulf. In Mr.Hood's report, dated the 29th.June 1909, page 2, it is shewn what the lighthouse tender should be provided with to carry out the duties. She should have a pov/erful winch and derrick for dealing easily at sea with weights up to 8 tons. The 'Patrick Stewart' is not furnished with a winch and derrick of this power, nor do I know that an 8-ton buoy could safely be carried on her deck. Before it could be decided whether or not the 'Patrick Stev/art' could be used as a tender it would be necessary to find out if in addition to her cable machinery,she had space to carry the appliances tjxat are needed for the buoyage work. If it was found she had they would have to he fitted into the ship at considerable cost. Information could be obtained from Trinity House as to the weights of the necessary machinery and the deck space required to place 10 on. This information would have to be sent to Karachi^where it could be seen if it was possible to fit the ship with what was required. I understand from Mr.Hood that if anything like the whole scheme proposed for the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf is carried out there is little doubt a tender would be wanted that could give its whole time to thew the duties* It has been calculated that it would take the 'Patrick Stewart' 15 days to make a tour of the light houses now proposed, and this tour would have to be made every month. If a cable failed and had to be repaired the regularity of these monthly tours might be interfered with, as the repair of uhe cables and telegraph work generally would remain the first call on the vessel. It ha© also to be noted that Karachi, the head quarters of the cable ship, is some 500 miles distant from the entrance of the Persian Gulf. In ordinary weather therefore she would spend some 8 to 3 days in getting to the Gulf and the same time in returning. In bad weather she woulo. take much longer over the journey. The tender for the lighthouses should have its headquarters in the Gulf itself, if it is to work to the best advantage. It could not well be arranged to station the cable ship in the Persian Gulf, because when cable repairs have to be carried out the Electrician of the Department and a number of lascars from the cable fac^oiy have to proceed in her from Karachi to effect the repairs. The 'Patrick Stewart' under present arrangements lies idle for weeks, but this may be said of any cable ship. If the ship could be utilized to a greater extent it is very desirable this should be done. I am afraid, however, that with her headquarters at Karachi and with her telegraph V work to carry out the ship would not prove a success as a- tender in the lighthouse scheme as now proposed, and that she would he unahle to cope with the work required when the scheme was extended.N 1 ^ Lft^. 0 CL [This Document is the Property of His EAST ERN DEPARTMENT.

Sir, With reference to the letter of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Ho. 1272 dated 19th May 1911, addressed to the Haval Conmunder-in-Chief, relative •fco the survey and lighting of the Port of Bushire, a copy of which has 'been sent to the Government of India, he pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council as follows. 2. Prom the experience gained of the light 'buoy now established on the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, it would seem that a similar buoy at Bushire in the outer anchorage would equally well serve all the purposes of navigation at the latter port. 3. The buoy in question appears to have mechanism attached to it by which the light can be occulted at any desired intervals and the possibility thus avoided of it being mistaken for any ship or shore light. A light buoy would of course be far cheaper to provide in the fii - - J instance and to keep running than a light vessel. At The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department.the same time it is a metter for consideration whether it might not he better from a Political point of view to provxaa a light vessel as being more imposing and mor^ihely to enh&amp;nce^prestige than a mere buoy • The light ship would fl^ ■the British ensign, and her nationality would thua never be mistaken, while soon after the establishment of &amp; buoy, its ownership would probably be forgotten by all except the authorities immediately responsible for its maintenance. 4. A Light Ship at Bushire would have the further advantage of supplying a possible means of communication between the outer anchorage and the shore - a thing which would be of great convenience at Bushire where signalling between the ships and the shore is often impossible owing to the haze and distance* It i* further suggested that if ehe were supplied with a short distance Wireless Telegraphy set, which is not expensive, she would always he in communication with one Bushire Telegraph Station when the proposed Wireless Telegraphy Installation has been erected there.

W. Hood’s Report of the 28th June 1909, of the several lights and the lighthouse tender that have formed the subject of recent correspondence.! As stated in the telegram of the Government t For convenience of reference a selection ^ India, dated the 21st August, of tins is enclosed. these are the most accurate pre liminary estimates that it is at present possible to obtain ; the total, exclusive of the lighthouse tender, amounts to— £ Initial - - - 47,600 Annual, recurring - _ _ 2,490 2. The necessity for incurring considerable expenditure on the light ing and buoyage of the Gulf has already been recognised in the corres pondence between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the India Office, and it has further been agreed that the particular lights included in the statement are those to which priority should be given. I am, therefore, to suggest that, as proposed in your letter No. 15,837, dated the 29th April last, the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury should now be moved to accept a moiety of the charges above-mentioned as a charge against British revenues, on the understanding that the other moiety will be defrayed by the Indian exchequer. 3. As regards the lighthouse tender, the necessity for which was strongly emphasised in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry, dated the 29th April 1909 (paragraph 12), and in Mr. Hood’s Report, there will if it has to be provided, be a further estimated expenditure of— £ Initial _ - - - 30,000 Annual, recurring - - - - 5,000 For the moment, however, the feasibility is being considered of employing, in lieu of a new tender, the Indo-European Telegraph Department cable-steamer “ Patrick Stewart,” at a daily charge for hire of 41 h 15s. 4d. It is calculated that to make one tour of the lighthouses would occupy 15 days. I am to suggest that it should be explained to The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office.the Lords Commissioners how the matter stands, and a further com munication promised to them as soon as possible. But it should be clearly understood that a lighthouse tender of some kind or another is an essential part of the scheme, though every endeavour will be made to keep the cost as low as possible. 4. Another point which is open to doubt is whether the Government of India propose to lay in the near future any further buoys (particularly at Bahrein) as recommended in the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s letter of the 25th February 1911, paragraph 7. Their attention has been directed to this in the telegram, dated the 13th instant, of which a copy is herewith transmitted. In any case, the cost of the buoys would be small as compared with that of the lighthouses and the light-vessels. 5. As regards the location of a lighthouse at Sheikh-Shuaib, it is presumed that His Majesty’s Minister will receive such instructions as 27th April m e i gram ^ Vicero ^ dated Sir E * Gre y may think suitable ' as to approaching the Persian Government.* b.

I am not aware how far the skeleton scheme advocated by Your Excel lency in the above communication is likely to be pushed forward in the immediate future; meanwhile the case of Bushire has been specifically brought into lively notice in the two following ways :— 3. Firstly—it appears that the utility of the Dioptric Lantern provided at the Kuwait Agency at an expenditure of Rs. 946 - 8-0 initial, and Rs. 15 monthly recurring has been appreciated, and that this and the recent improvements effect ed in the buoyage of the bar have had the effect of accentuating the needs of Bushire in the way of aids to navigation. The result is that I hear of a move ment being on foot among masters of British merchant steamers calling habitual ly at this port, having for its object the provision by private subscription of tem porary aids to navigation in the shape of two or three simple shore lights sufficient to enable vessels to make the port by night, thereby saving time and money to their owners. I believe it is considered that less costly lanterns than that supplied for Kuwait, hoisted on masts or on the top of high houses near the coast line, would fulfil the desired object for the time being, and pending a more effective arrangement, but two lamps at least would be needed. I am sure that Your Excellency will agree that this is not a project which we can profitably allow to be carried out by private arrangement or subscription; and if no immediate action is being taken by Government on your recommenda tion of 25 th February, I venture to ask Your Excellency’s advice as to what type of lamp would suffice, and to suggest that three lamps be provided, one on the Subzabad Residency or Reshire flagstaff, one on the Town office flagstaff and one intermediate on a temporary .mast erected on the high ground acquired by Government for the site of the new Residency under projection- ^ This plot lies a few hundred yards to the eastward of the “ small dome ’ which will be found at the intersection of a bearing of 75° f rom Mufka Tower with one of 174 from the Town Residency flagstaff. I merely mention these points as most suitable from a political point of view if they serve the purpose from that of the navigator. 4. Secondly—almost ever since the existing chart of the Bushire anchorage has issued, I have heard complaints from masters of merchant vessels that they found somewhat less water in the harbour than the chart showed. I have now received from the British Chamber of Corn- Dated 10th May 1911. merce the letter of which I attach a copy.2 I I have the honour to enquire whether it is possible that the services of H. M. S. “Odin”—Commander Walter—could be spared on her return from Colombo to bring the existing chart of the channel and anchorages up to date. There are no trained surveyors on the R. I. M. S. “Lawrence” now, but she could of course co-operate with Commander Walter to the extent of her ability. 5 . It is quite possible that Your Excellency may not consider the course which I have ventured to suggest either practicable at present, or sufficient for the purposes. In any case I shall esteem it a favour if you would place the Gov ernment of India, to whom I am sending copies of these papers, in possession of your views as to how the needs of Bushire can best be met for the time being, both in the matter of leading lights and survey. Dated the 10th May 1911. From—The Honorary Secretary, Bushire British Chamber of Commerce, Bushire, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that at a meeting of this Chamber held yesterday, a question was raised regarding the Admiralty Chart at present in use for this Port. . Some of the members representing Shipping Companies informed the meet- ing that they had received letters from certain of their Captains stating that there is much less water to be found when entering and also inside the inner anchorage, than is shown on the Chart. Some Captains in their letters stated that in their opinion a new survey of the harbour would be most desirable, and I have been requested by the members of this Chamber to approach you in the matter and to solicit your kind offices to put same before His Majesty’s Indian Government and if possible to arrange in the interests of British shipping that a new survey may be taken of the harbour. u M arin e noti( ; e ha ? been &gt; I ^derstand, issued since the last survey was held, to the effect that there was a difference of three feet between the depth as C I iart i anC ! aS - f ° Und . by actual . sendings, but the conditions are pparently constantly altering owing to the silting up of the channels. Thanking you in anticipation for your kind assistance. C. C. B. P., Simla.—No. O54 F. D.—3.6.11.—44.-H.C.S.L.SECRET. [Tins document is the property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] SELECTION OF CORRESPONDENCE AS TO THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. Copy of a letter from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department No. 38-1462-XO., dated Bombay, the 25th February 191E With reference to the telegrams from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf from Fao, dated 21st, 22nd, and 23rd instant, relative to the proceedings of the Turkish Gunboat “ Marmariss ” in connection with the buoyage of the river Shatt-al-Arab, be pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council that it appears necessary to take steps as soon as possible towards putting the lighting and buoyage of the Persian Gulf upon a satisfactory footing. 2. The recent development of events in the Shatt-al-Arab points to the imminence of the danger that Germany will press the local authorities to establish the necessary safeguards for navigation independently of us, and that she will thus by degrees undermine the position of Great Britain as paramount Power in the Gulf. It is obvious that if Germany had wished to act in a friendly manner, her complaints about the buoys and the difficulties of the bar would have been addressed to the British instead of to the Turkish Government, as it is common knowledge in the Gulf that the Shatt-al-Arab is surveyed and the buoys maintained by British and not Turkish authorities. 3. That which has occurred in this instance may well be done in other cases, and the only way to prevent a repetition is to forestall the Germans by taking action ourselves. We cannot expect to maintain an exclusive position in the Gulf unless prepared to pay something towards it, and the most pressing needs at present appear to be the provision of some system of lights and buoys as safeguards to navigation, and the installation of wireless telegraphy to facilitate communications. With regard to the latter I have already placed my views before His Excellency in Council in my letter No. 24/1470 of 4th February 1911. 4. The lighting and buoys question was investigated by a Committee consisting of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Captain of H.M.S “ Sphinx,” the Officer in charge of the Marine Survey of India, and a representative of Trinity House, who reported on 29th April 1909. The lights proposed by the Committee in order of importance are :— Shatt-al-’Arab bar, L. V. and 4 buoys. Musandam (Little Quoin). Masqat. Bushire. Sheikh Shuaib. Ras-as-Mataf. Tamb. Kubbar Island (Kuwait). /i, ^as-al-Arz (Kuwait). Bahrain. Lingeh. Dibai. Bandar Abbas. I consider that this order should be slightly varied for political reasons, and that it is now necessary first of all to provide a line of lights that will facilitate the passage of ships up and down the Gulf. S. 99.'1 .2 5. If the lights be provided at Musandain (Little Quoin), Tamb, and Sheikh Shuaib, and the light vessel be placed at Bushire, all that is immediately necessary on that account will then have been done. 6. I further suggest that the light vessel at the bar of the Shatt-al-’Arab be established. It may appear that the provision of the acetylene gas buoy would be sufficient for all purposes, but if the navigation of the entrance to the Shatt-al-’Arab is to be placed upon a thoroughly satisfactory footing, a h o-ht vessel moored about 4 miles to seaward of the outer will be an absolute necessity. Without a vessel of this kind it is always difficult to pick up the buoy in thick weather, and it is desirable to have someone always on the spot, as would be the case if a light vessel were provided in order to prevent the Arab fishermen from interfering with the buoy. The fishermen do considerable damage to the existing buoys and carry off anything portable. 7. I would strongly recommend that the proposals of the Committee relative to the lighthouse tender and the buoys in the Gulf, particularly with regard to. those at Bahrain, be carried out at an early date. The provision of the other lights recommended by the Committee might ^be proceeded with as convenient, but should not be unduly delayed. 8. The question as to dues to be paid for the lights when established is difficult to solve, and is a matter upon which I can offer very few sug gestions. It would appear that the only possible way in which to levy dues so that they may fall equally upon all ships, both British and foreign, is to collect them through the local authorities. This might be done by the Persian customs at Bushire, or, in the case of ships which do not call there, at any Persian Port at which they may touch, or at Masqat. It might be possible to levy a small due at Bahrain and Kuwait, through the Sheikhs, for the local buoyage and lights. Under any circumstances, since we cannot levy the dues in our own ports, it must be a matter of agreement with all the Powers concerned, and if we establish an efficient lighting service, it is improbable that any great difficulties will be made with regard to the collection of these dues. 9. I consider the improvement and safeguarding of the navigation in the Gulf to be so important that the establishment of these lights should be undertaken as soon as possible, without waiting for the settlement of the question of(ight dues. Something may be risked, but it is so necessary to establish our control over the Gulf beyond the possibility of interference by other Powers that I respectfully submit that it is worth the risk. Telegram P. From the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. No. 218. Dated and received 17th March 1911. Tour endorsement No. 436 E/A, dated 2nd March. I endorse the view expressed in final sentence of fourth paragraph of Commander-in-Chief’s letter, and agree that the four items mentioned in the fifth paragraph will form best skeleton scheme to start with, with reference to the point of view of navigation as well as present political developments. Should it not be possible to commence the three lighthouses simultaneously, recent opinions expressed to me by navigators incline me to think that they would prefer to get Tamb and Sheikh Shuaib before Musandam, the last-named being the easiest to pick up in the dark. I concur generally in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Admiral’s letter, and especially agree as to necessity for the scheme being proceeded with, without waiting for settlement of problem as to dues to be levied, since this is a question which is only capable of adjustment after full discussion as the scheme develops. *3 From Viceroy, 27th April 1911. P.; —Persian Gulf buoying and lighting. Please see my telegram dated the 14:th instant. Reference is invited to telegram dated \7th ultimo from Resident, Persian Gulf, forwarded with weekly letter, dated 23rd ultimo, from Secretary to Government of India, Foreign Department. Recommendations of Resident and Naval Commander-in-Chief have my general support, particu larly in view of activity in improving buoyage and lighting of Shat-el-Arab, ivhich is at present being displayed by Turks. But construction, simul taneously with others, of lighthouse at Musandim seems to me preferable. I consider it better, with reference to proposal of Admiral that light vessel should be placed at bar of Shat-el-Arab, to wait first and see whether Turks place their light ship properly, and whether it is maintained in perfect order by them. 1 would invite attention to remark of Committee that, as regards Sheikh Shuaib, it would be necessary to approach Persian Government. Instructions are solicited, before detailed estimates are prepared, as to actual measures which His Majesty's Government consider necessary. Expenditure involved should, it is also recommended, be borne by Indian and Imperial Exchequers in equal shares. We loill submit later a further report as to possibility of obtaining a Royal Indian Marine vessel suitable for conversion into lighthouse tender. See report by Mr. Hood. Enquiry is being made on this point. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 10th May 1911. P.— Please refer to your telegram dated the 27th April 1911. I recognise in all the circumstances that time has arrived ivhen it is no longer possible to defer scheme having for its object lighting of Persian Gulf. Recommendations in your telegram are generally approved, with concurrence of Foreign Office, and your are requested to furnish as soon as possible detailed estimates in accordance therewith. Also consulting Admiralty. After your estimates have been considered the Treasury will be approached.

In a letter dated 20th ultimo to Foreign Office, copy of xohich was enclosed in Secretary's letter dated 2nd instant, Admiralty concur in proposal that Musandim lighthouse should be constructed simultaneously with two other lighthouses; but they are of opinion that purposes of a British light vessel four miles seaward of older bar buoy, Shat-el-Arab, would not in any way be answered by Turkish light vessel dose to that buoy. Reference is also invited to Admiral Slade s letter to Admiralty of 11th ultimo, paragraph 5. I shall be glad to have your view as to acetylene gas buoy at inner bar, also recommended by the Admiral in his letter, and 'to learn whether you have any further observations as to British light vessel. You might include provisionally in your estimates the cost of both. From Viceroy, 27th June 1911. p^ Persian Gulf buoying and lighting. See your telegram dated the 10th instant. I agree after further inquiry both as to provision of acetylene gas- buoy at inner bar, and as to desirability of British light vessel being placed, as recommended by Admiral, four or five miles to seaward of gas outer buoy. Further inquiry is being made, there being some difficulty as to preparation of detailed estimates, and a further report will be sent. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, l^/i August 1911. -p g ee y 0ur telegram dated 27th June last. Please let me have as soon as possible estimates as to gas buoy and light vessel in Persian Gulf. Admiralty express themselves in favour of both ; see their letter of Mh instant forwarded4 with letter of 11th instant from Secretary, Political Department, India Office. With a view to avoidance of international difficulties, Admiralty consider that inner bar buoy, laying of which was reported to you by Admiral Slade in his letter of 19t/i May, and not the Turkish buoy opposite, should be replaced by gas buoy. Presumably this was the intention of Your Excellency. From Viceroy, 21st August 1911. £ P. —Persian Gulf buoying and lighting. See your telegram dated the 11th instant. It is impossible, I regret to say, to furnish detailed estimates, or preliminary estimates of greater accuracy than those of Mr. Hoofim, ivho studied the matter locally, for light vessel gas buoy, or any other items of the There is no vessel at our disposal available for conversion into tender for lighthouse. Please refer to our telegram dated the 27th April 1911. Arrange ments might possibly be made, though this cannot be relied on!, for S.S. “ Patrick Stewart,” belonging to Indo-European Telegraph Department, in one combined monthly tour, to act as tender besides performing her usual work. A single tour of the light-houses would, it is estimated, occupy 15 days, and daily cost of hiring the “ Patrick Stewart ” would be Rs. 626 CU . $ , As regards gas buoy, reply to your query is an affirmative one.COPY.

I am, e^c., (Signed) A.Owen.«... SECRET. B. 169.^ 1909. [This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.^ 0 • REPORT BY DA\ T ID W. HOOD, Assoc. M. Inst. C.E., SUPPLEMENTARY TO THAT OP A COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY ON THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. In considering tire establishment of lighthouses, light vessels, buoys, and other sea marks in the Persian Gulf, 1 propose to approach the subject mainly from the point of view of construction and maintenance ; and, while fully in agreement with the order of importance attributed to the proposed lights in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry, I have, for the time being, set aside all claims to priority in navigational importance in favour of those offering the greatest facilities, and consequent economy, from an engineering standpoint. Finally, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to reconcile the navigational and constructional requirements. In some cases alternative proposals to those recommended by the Committee are put forward, as the result of further personal investigation since I left the Persian Gulf, or are suggested by the probable expenditure after the preparation of the estimates. In regard to the scheme generally as prepared and advocated by the Committee of Enquiry, I would draw attention to the abstract statement of lights proposed by the British India officers at the beginning of the Report, and would state that, since the Committee dispersed, I have had numerous opportunities of confidentially discussing the lighting of the 1 ersian Gulf with masters of vessels engaged in navigating these waters, including some of those whose opinions had previously been submitted to us, and discovered, without divulging the recommendations of the Committee, that the scheme proposed would meet with, practically, universal favour. In submitting estimates for each of the proposed lighthouses, it has been assumecT that ail materials which require to be imported into the Gulf will be carried by regular trading steamers to the nearest port, and be taken thence, landed, and delivered on the site by the proposed lighthouse tender and her crew, as the services of an attendant steamship are considered essential in the interests of works on sites of such isolation and inaccessi bility. No allowance has, therefore, been made in the estimates for freight on material after it leaves the trading steamer, except the hire of native craft for barge work where necessary. Where portions of _ any works demand fresh water for building construction or other purposes, it has been assumed that such water will be delivered on the site by the steamer if it cannot be procured locally. Nor has allowance been made for the purchase of land for lighthouses or other works. In Paper No. 189, dated 5th November 1908, embodying the official correspondence in regard to the construction of a lighthouse at Ras al Arz,2 U i, rpcommended (page 11) that the work be executed by experienced lighthouse constructors from England. I have, therefore assumed ttiat all lighthouses, &amp;c„ in the Persian Gulf will be erected % a Superm endent of Works of the Constructive Staff of Trinity House, and by iigtimouse mechanics where necessary, all skilled labour being procured from nc la, Sid unskilled labour from the locality in which the work is being executed, „ ,1 t r ,1 „„‘ll /-KTrx/-.+ orl 1-ixr rirmtrn.nt ^ rl f Ti n f nnnP Lighthouse Tender. The necessity for the provision of a steamship to serve exclusively in the caoacity of lighthouse tender has been pointed out by the Committee of Enauiry. The cost of construction and maintenance of this steamer would form very considerable items in any scheme for establishing lights in the Persian Gulf Possibly, however, the Royal India Marine have at their disposal an existing vessel which, if possible to release from other duties, could at comparatively small cost be fitted and adapted for use as a lighthouse She should have a good hold and good deck accommodation for the conveyance of stores and buoys, be fitted with storage gas receivers and compressor for charging buoys or light vessels, anti have a powerful winch and derrick for dealing easily with weights up to 8 tons at sea. Her capacity for water storage or distilling, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should not be overlooked. , _ _ . , ., , , , Should a suitable vessel of the Royal India Marine not be available, and it becomes necessary to build a new ship, with proper appliances and permanent living accommodation for officers and crew, she would m all probability require a displacement of approximately 800 tons. I estimate her cost, delivered in the Persian Gulf after construction in England, at 30,000k The lndian Government, from their own experience, will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would be in the East, but it would probably amount to about 5,000k per annum, inclusive of wages, lepans, coal, stores, and all charges. The Committee of Enquiry recommend that one of the officers of the ship should be a qualified surveyor, and I would further suggest that her Com mander hold the appointment of Superintendent of Lighthouses, and be responsible for the proper maintenance of all lighthouses, light vessels, and buoys. The engineer of the ship should be fully trained to overhaul and adjust all working parts of all lights, including clocks, rollers, buoy flashers, &amp;c., and be thoroughly grounded in the management and adjustment of modern lighthouse burners. Lighthouses. As already stated, the order of navigational importance as tabulated in the report of the Committee of Enquiry should, for constructional expediency, be departed from to a slight degree. In the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, the first lighthouse in the Gulf should be established at Little Quoin, Musandam. The establishment of a lighthouse on Little Quoin, however, would be dependent on the attendance of the lighthouse steamer ; and, if it is the intention of the Government of India to proceed forthwith with a lighting scheme, I would point out that, as the services of the steam tender are not required for the construction and maintenance of the proposed works at Muscat, Linga, and Debai, the establishment of these lights could be undertaken during the period in which the proposed lighthouse tender is under construction or adaptation. Then, on the arrival of the steam tender in the Gulf, the construction of the Little Quoin lighthouse could be proceeded with ; and considerable economy would be effected if Little Quoin and Tanb Island lighthouses were built simultaneously, as they are close together, and could both be attended to easily and conveniently by the ship, while allowing her ample time to attend periodically to the requirements of any floating or other lights that may meantime have been established in the Gulf. *r Lhe construction of lighthouses at Shaikh Shuaib, Bushire, Kuhbar, Ras al Arz, and Kishm, from the different nature of the structures, could be undertaken separately and in any required sequence, as in these cases continual attention by the ship would not be so essential. In all cases 1 would recommend that the illuminant adopted for light houses m the Persian Gulf be ordinary lighthouse paraffin. As incandescent oil burners of the “ Chance ” type are already installed on the coast of India, I would suggest that the same system be adopted for the lights now under discussion, as the lighthouse officials appointed to the Gulf will in all probability have had some experience of these burners in Burma, Madras, and other portions of the Indian coast. In regard to machinery and the working parts of each lighthouse, only mechanism of the simplest nature is recommended, in view of its maintenance by local keepers. Depot. While the earliest works are in progress in the Gulf, the establishment of the gasworks should be completed. The site for the depot and gasworks which appeared to me to offer the greatest advantages in the Persian Gulf was the shore of the Sweikh Channel at Koweit, when it transpired that a portion of the adjoining land had already been secured by the British Government. I subsequently inferred, and have assumed,'that the con struction of a pier or jetty at this point is in contemplation, and that part of this British land will be placed at the disposal of the lighthouse authorities for the establishment of a buoy yard, gas works, &amp;c., and that the pier or jetty will be available for the use of the lighthouse service. The cost of establishing gasworks, erecting a small workshop, oil storage tanks, store houses, offices, forming buoy yard, and boundary walls, would probably entail an expenditure of about 22,000L, complete with spare light vessel, gas buoys, unlit buoys, moorings, and general equipment, but nothing has been allowed in this estimate for the purchase of land, or any proportion of the cost of the proposed pier. On the assumption that the work already contemplated by the Govern ment at Koweit will be commenced immediately, matters would be considerably simplified if the establishment of the lighthouse depot formed a part of the Admiralty scheme, and if the work could be carried out by their constructive staff. It is assumed that Koweit will shortly be placed in telegraphic communication with Bushire. The cost of maintaining the depot is covered by the corresponding amounts given for each of the proposed lights. Light Vessels. Simultaneously with the building or adaptation of the steam tender the construction of one or more light vessels could be undertaken. They should be modelled, both as regards hull and lighting apparatus, on the most recent Trinity House practice; and I would suggest that they be copper-sheathed composite ships, about 85 feet in length. Each ship should be fitted with storage gas holders for the maintenance of a dioptric light, similar to those on this principle established successfully in France and England. The dioptric apparatus should consist of large fourth order panels of 375 m/m. focal distance, and each ship should be arranged to show a single flashing white light, so that she could be removed from, or placed on, any station without alteration. This can be done without any possible confusion of lights. They should be fitted with 2-wick capillary stand-by lamps. In England the crew of such a vessel consists of six men, i.e., four on board and two on relief; but in the Persian Gulf I would suggest that the crew consist of six men on board and two on relief. I estimate the cost of such a vessel, complete, with moorings on her station in the Gulf, at approximately 9,5001., and the maintenance at about 650L per annum, inclusive of wages, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against the ship for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit.I T.. 'r. I am of opinion that the construction of these slops should not be -undertaken in India. A dioptric ship is of special form, and should be undeita , . r idm&lt;* have her lenses balanced, the swing of the vessel determined, and the period of the pendulum finally adjusted to it under the be towed to the Gulf by the new light house tender, and the others could be sailed to Port Said and towed from, there to the Gulf by the tender sent round specially for that purpose. All proposals as to lightships and lighted buoys are put forward provisionally, as the illumination of all descriptions of floating lights is on the eve of very important, and, I confidentally anticipate successful development. The estimates of first cost and maintenance may, however, he accepted as covering figures in any case. Muscat (see Appendix I.). The summit of Has Muscat is at present practically inaccessible, and a zig-zag path with occasional steps would require to be made to the top. The flat reef below the headland, and on which a landing can easily be effected, requires making up with concrete, and considerable excavation would be necessary on the summit of the headland to form a shelf 01 plateau on which the necessary buildings could be erected. The tower and dwellings should be constructed of masonry, the former being only about 12 feet b inches high, floor to floor. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 250 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of about 22 miles, flhe necessary living and storage accommodation should consist of living room, sleeping- room, oil store, fuel store, general store-room, and water storage tanks. The provision of a low retaining wall around the plateau might be found necessary, as the surface rock on the summit is very loose. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of about -34 second duration every 5 seconds. The intensity would be about 100,000 candles with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m in the focus of the lens. I estimate approximately, from the information at my disposal, that the cost of establishing such a lighthouse, complete with lantern, lighting apparatus, dwelling and stores, and inclusive of forming a landing place, approaches to the summit, temporary stores, and living quarters for superin tendents and workmen, would be about, 8,000h, and the annual maintenance, inclusive of oil, stores, wages and repairs, at about 350L, an amount that would cover the sum annually chargeable against Muscat for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. I consider that the establishment necessary for maintaining this light should consist of six men (natives of Muscat), who should be chosen by the Superintendent of Works and the erecting mechanic, in consultation with the British Political Resident at Muscat, from amongst the labourers employed on the works, and who will have been under observation for a considerable time by these officers. It would then be the duty of the erecting mechanic to instruct them in the management of the burners and everything in their charge. It would be necessary for Muscat lighthouse to be maintained as a “ rock station,” he., the men only residing at the lighthouse and their families in the town. Four men would, therefore, always be on duty at the lighthouse, with two on relief. Little Quoin (see Appendices II. and III.). On the completion of Muscat lighthouse, the workmen’s living quarters, cement store and plant should be conveyed to the Little Quoin by the lighthouse tender, and the construction of the lighthouse on the island begun. Ihe most convenient landing place is at the north-west point; but tc face up the rock so as to render the landing of men and stores easy, and execute the necessary protective work to the cliff over the landing place.would, though presenting little constructional difficulty, entail considerable expenditure. • ^ e , ^ ie the south end is 154 feet high, and the proposed site lo4 leet above high water. I he touei should be of masonry, 80 feet high from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 175 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. Ihis light one of the most important in the Gulf—should, I consider, be of the Second Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse '23 second. 1'54 „ •23 „ 8'00 seconds. Total period - - 10'00 The intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m* in the focus of the lens, would be about 200,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the light, inclusive of landing place, cliff protective work, tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus complete at 12,500b, and the annual maintenance at 400b, inclusive of all stores, wages, structural repairs, and charges against the Little Quoin lighthouse for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The lighthouse should be maintained as a rock station, the keepers only living on the island, The establishment should consist of six men, four on duty and two on relief. Probably a very frequent relief of the Little Quoin lighthouse would be necessary in the summer months, as it is characterised climatically as the worst place in the Gulf. Bunder Abbas (see Appendix IV.). Alternative proposals for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas are suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, viz. :— 4. A lighthouse near Kishm Town, in conjunction with a lighted buoy at the seaward extreme of the shoals off Kishm Point, or— 2. A small light vessel or gas boat alone in the latter position. A site for a lighthouse was selected near a small gully just beyond the extreme water tank to the southward of Kishm Town, the site being about 100 yards from the sea. Good building materials, except for concrete work, are not available locally, and I would suggest that the tower be a braced cast-iron structure about 65 feet high from ground to gallery. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 86 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 15 miles as recommended by the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry. The light should, I consider, be Third Order occulting, and show red between the bearings of about S. 14° E. and S. 66° E. over Larak Island. Its character should be one occultation every 20 seconds. With an incan descent oil burner, having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter in the focus of the lens, the intensity would be about 9,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the lighthouse, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, stores, dwellings, &amp;c., complete at 7,500L, and its annual maintenance, inclusive of wages, stores, repairs, and painting, at 400/., which sum would cover all amounts chargeable against Kishm for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Kishm lighthouse would rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four men, who should live with their families in dwellings erected near the tower. With regard to the proposed lighted buoy off Kishm Point, I estimate its cost, with lantern and moorings complete on its station, at 600/., and its annual maintenance at 40/., inclusive of gas, cleaning, periodical overhaul, and depot charges.In regard to the alternative proposal to establish a small type of light , &lt;?Vlctnn rtoint I estimate the cost of placing an unattended gas an o^uCg light of about 500 candle power, at 6,0001. complete on hOT station, with moorings, Ac. The mamtenance of such a vessel would probably amount to about 2501. per annum, inclusive of S^s stores periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against her by the depot at Koweit and periodical and frequent attention by a local man. Ether of these schemes for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas involves considerable expense both in first cost and annual maintenance to obviate which a third and possible alternative suggests itself, viz to establish a small outer light on the east end of Larak Island, and a lighted buoy at the Euphrates Patch west of Hormuz. , , As already stated, the first cost and annual maintenance of the buoy would be 6001. and 401. respectively, inclusive of all depot charges. A navigator could ascertain his position m approaching the port from any direction by the Little Quoin light, and all that would be necessary to guide him safely past Larak is a small light of short range to mark the end of the island. If this were a standard semi-watched port light, it could be attended to by a native of the adjoining village. No provision would be necessary for living quarters, as would probably be the case il the light were established on the west end of the island. A light of only 5 miles range on the east end ol Larak would, it appears to me, he as efficient as a 15-mile light on Ivishm Point, if the lighting of the approaches to Bunder Abbas be restricted to one channel only. In addition to the cost of the proposed buoy at the Euphrates Patch, the establishment of a port light on Larak Island would involve an expenditure of 450L, inclusive of a small corrugated iron oil store, &amp;c., and would, I consider, he maintained at an annual cost ol about 35L, inclusive of all depot charges. The estimate of first cost of this port light provides for an erecting mechanic being already employed in the Gulf, as no provision has been made for sending a man specially from India or England to erect the light. Jezirat Taxb (see Appendix V.). The best sight for a lighthouse on Tanb is the summit of the island, a fiat tableland near the N.W. side. Good building stone is available, and I would suggest that the premises he constructed of masonry. The site is about 1G5 feet above high water; but, as there are several points on the island nearly as high as the proposed site, I would suggest that, in order to reduce the shadows cast seaward by them, the tower be 30 feet high. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 200 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of ' 34 second duration every 5 seconds, the intensity being about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing this light complete with tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus, at about 7,500h, and its maintenance at 3501. per annum, which would cover all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Tanb lighthouse should rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four keepers, who should live with their families in dwellings erected beside the tower. These men should, if possible, be natives of the island. Debai. The site selected for the proposed light at Debai is on the sea front. The structure should be a column 20 feet high, and the light (fixed red, as recom mended by the Committee of Enquiry) should he shown from a Fourth Order port light. It would he of about 200 candle power, which would probably give an effective range of 5 miles, and often more in very clear weather.r llie light could, I estimate, be maintained for about 35L per annum, and I estimate the first cost, inclusive of column, lantern, stores, and corrugated iron oil store at approximately 450L if carried out a time when other work was in hand in the locality and an expert erector was available. Lingah. The site selected for a light at Lingah is the centre of the courtyard of the new offices of the British India Company, in which position I would suggest that a high column with four stays be erected. The light, fixed red, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should be so arranged that the lantern is hoisted nightly on the mast or column. It should be a Fourth Order port light, the establishment of which would not, I estimate, exceed 600Z. if carried out at a time when other work was in hand in the locality. Such a light would probably be maintained at an annual cost of 35Z. inclusive of all depot charges. Its maintenance would only require the partial time of one man for extinguishing and cleaning purposes in the morning and for lighting up and hoisting into position at night. Shaikh Shuaib (see Appendix VL). The best position for a lighthouse is, as indicated by the Committee of Enquiry, near the S.W. point of the island. The tower should, I consider, be a braced cast-iron structure about 85 feet in height from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 120 feet above high water. The resultant geographical range would be about 17 miles, or rather more than is recom mended by the Committee ; but the slight additional height allowed for in the tower is to obtain a satisfactory bearing of the light over the higher land to the eastward. From this elevation the light would, in all probability, show from N. through W. and S. to E. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Flash _ _ - - - -34 second. Eclipse - - - _ 1'5 ,, Flash - - ■ ' - '34 ,, Eclipse - - - - 7'82 seconds. Total period - - 10'00 ,, The intensity would be about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing such a light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c., complete at 8,000L, and its maintenance at 400Z. per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The four keepers should, I consider, be natives of the island, and reside with their families in quarters erected near the tower. Shaikh Shuaib would, therefore, be a shore station, and require no regular relief. Ras al Mutaf. The type of floating light proposed for establishment at Ras al Mutaf is described provisionally under light vessels, where it is also estimated that her first cost would be about 9,500Z. and her annual maintenance about 650L The light should show one flash every 10 seconds, and the intensity would be approximately 40,000 candles. Bushire. \s suo-gested by the Committee of Enquiry, the most efficient means of Imhtino-the approach to Bushire is by means of a light vessel placed near the outer anchorage. The cost of establishing a suitable ship w ould lie8 i -.ointpnnnoe approximately 650L, as already about 9,5001., and her cou ia be single flashing every 10 seconds, within intensity of about Comm ittee, is a lighthouse on The alternative scheme, as indicated ny i shore. m+mrnnre of a light vessel as compared with a light- The first cost and maintenance heater though the difference would house would be, of course, consideralfly ^greatei% ^ m the probably not be so marke t floating light would be heavy establishment and “ al f enaa 4 e °^ike Buslire To obviate this, I would items of expenditure for a poi effect&gt; a simple combination of the suggest yet another scheme, w ^ Committee of Enquiry, viz a recommendations of the A dmnal j large lantern and a lighthouse on Kas as Shaghab ^'kle the 5-fathom line, so that in hazy hfgh and cons— topm^ontene the ^ weather, even m da&gt; tn , c should be a braced cast-iron structure as A lighthouse %“d I estimate its cost, complete with recommended for Shaikh S , , llin 0 p store , &amp;e., complete, at tower, lantern, bgbtmg app^ ^ - inclusive of all depot charges. 8,000L, and its annual maintenance at , k succession cvery The light on Shore s “db.fo tU k° r oposed for Shaikh Shuaib. 10 The^esteblishment^should consist of four keepers, who would reside with their families m quarters b® „ as buoy in the outer anchorage I estimate the cost oi establishing a large gas ^ j ive of all dep6t at 7501., and its maintenance at 451. per annum, charges.

The characters of the lights could be Outer Buov No 1 - One occultation every 10 seconds. 7 No'. 2 - Two flashes every 10 seconds. No. 3 - One flash every 10 seconds. Inner Buoy No. 4 - One occultation every 10 seconds. The colour of all these lights should be white. Kubbau Island (see Appendix VII.). All ships approaching Koweit from any direction make this island the landfall, and as it is very low and flat, it is most difficult to pick up even in very clear weather, so that a lighthouse on Kubbar Island would be found almost as great a benefit as a daymark as the light by night. The proposed site is only about 6 feet above high water. A cast-iron braced tower similar to that recommended for Shaikh Shuaib would place5 9 the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 100 feet above high water, or sufficient for the geographical range of 15 miles recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It would, I consider, be necessary to maintain this lighthouse as a rock station, the reliefs being effected from Koweit, living quarters for men only being provided on the island. I estimate the cost of the establishment of the light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c., complete, at 8,500L, and its maintenance at 400L per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The light should be of the Third Order, and show four flashes in quick succession every 15 seconds as follows :— Flash - - ‘ 26 second Eclipse - _ _ _ 2'00 seconds Flash - - '26 second Eclipse - _ _ _ - 2'00 seconds Flash - - '26 second Eclipse - . - 2'00 seconds Flash - - ' 26 second Eclipse - - - 7'96 seconds Total period - 15*00 seconds The intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m. diameter in the focus of the lens, would be about 85,000 candles. Has al Arz (see Appendix VIII.). The most convenient and best site for a lighthouse at Ras al Arz is immediately in rear of the existing beacon, and nothing is to be gained bj^ placing the structure on the higher ground inland of this position, as suggested in paragraph 4 of a letter from Major Knox, dated 21st May 1907, and printed on page 2 of Paper No. 189, dated 5th November 1908. d'he site there is of blown sand; and, though a lower tower would suffice, the foundations would be a very expensive item. The tower should be a braced cast-iron structure about 40 feet high, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 45 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 12 miles as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It should, I consider, be of the Fourth Order, and show one white flash every 5 seconds. This light could be of a semi-watched nature, the luminary being a 2-wick capillary lamp. A watchman is already maintained to guard the beacon, and the provision of another keeper would complete the establishment necessary for the requirements of such a light. With the proposed semi-watched system, the driving clock is arranged to maintain the light in action all night without re-winding, and the lamp to burn without' attention. I estimate the cost of such a light, with tower, lantern, and lighting apparatus, oil store, lighthouse store, &amp;c., complete, at 3,000L, and its maintenance at IDOL per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. It is noteworthy that the present watchman, a Bedouin, although provided with a house of two rooms of the usual native construction, does not occupy it, preferring to live with his family in a tent of native matting. Local opinion is against the provision of further permanent living quarters, as Bedouin prefer the tents. An oil store and lighthouse store room have, however, been provided for in the above estimate. The type of light provided for in the estimates embodied in pages 9 and 10 of Paper No. 189 of 1908 is, I consider, unsuitable for the position, and would not fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee of Enquiry. The estimate for its establishment on the lines proposed is also inadequate. In estimating the cost of erecting the iron tower, Ac., it has been assumed that a foreman of works to supervise the construction of the foundations, and-U ova qlrpndv engaged in the Persian Gulf, as no nUowance 1 has-been' made for ihe sea passages of skilled workmen from England^ tbe employment of whom is recommended on page 11 of Paper Ih9, dated 5th November 1908. Bahrein (see Appendix IX.). For the efficient lighting of the approaches to Bahrein the CommUtee of Enquiry propose a 20-mile light on the reef at Fasht ad Bibai a floating light near the present outer buoy, and gas buoys at Kaseifa and the West SFi To erect a lighthouse at Fasht ad Dibal would involve an expenditure which I estimate at 35,000Z. The reef is practically awash at lov\ water, and the structure would be subjected to assault by the sea. , „ The estimate provides for a massive concrete base on the coral reef, surmounted bv a braced cast-iron structure about 150 feet high m the design of which the necessary living accommodation would be embodied. The light should be of the Third Order, single flashing every 5 seconds, and the intensity about 100,000 candles. _ AA7 I estimate the cost of maintaining such a lighthouse at oOOZ. per annum inclusive of wages, ration allowances, stores, oil, structural repairs and painting, and all sums chargeable against the station lor the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. , f ^ In view of the heavy cost anticipated by the Committee ol Enquiry entailed in erecting a lighthouse on Fasht ad Bibai, they suggest the alternative of placing a light vessel about 5 miles north of the reef the cost of a suitable vessel complete on her station would be about 9,oU0h, and her annual maintenance about 650L The light from the light vessel should be single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. Whatever form of outer light for marking the approaches to Bahrein be adopted, the Committee of Enquiry propose that a floating light be established near the present outer buoy to mark the entrance to the channel. This light might be a gas boat, with an occulting Fourth Order light of about 500 candle power. Such a vessel would require to be about 65 feet long, and would, I estimate, cost about 6,000L complete on her station, involving an expenditure of about 2501. for maintenance, inclusive of gas and periodical overhaul. She would have an unattended light and carry no crew. Each of the gas buoys proposed for Kaseifa and West Spit would, I estimate, cost about 6006 complete on its station, and involve an annual outlay of about 406 Summarised, these two schemes for the lighting of Bahrein are as follows:— First Cost. Annual Maintenance. No. 1. £ £ Lighthouse - 35,000 500 Gas hoat - 6,000 250 Two gas buoys - - 1,200 80 Total - - 42,200 830 No. 2. Light vessel _ 9,500 650 Gas boat - 6,000 250 Two gas buoys - 1,200 80 Total - - 16,700 980 Either of these schemes, with its attendant heavy first cost and maintenance, would, in the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, be necessary to render ingress and egress of Bahrein harbour practicable and safe by night.I would point out, however, that, since I left the Persian Gulf, I have had it put before me that leaving Bahrein by night is of much more importance than entering the port, as a vessel, on completing her loading by night, coidd leave at any time instead of waiting for daylight. If this argument be admitted, all that is necessary to render egress from the harbour safe is a gas buoy at Kaseifa, and another gas buoy with a high and conspicuous superstructure for a day-mark near the present outer buoy. It is a matter for very serious consideration, however, whether the establishment of these two lights would not tend to induce men to use them for entering Bahrein, as it might involve considerable risk. I estimate the aggregate cost of these two gas buoys at 1,350k complete on their stations, and their combined maintenance at 85k per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. Beacon. To erect a suitable structure in place of the present beacon at Bahrein would probably entail an expenditure of about 500k, and 5k for annual maintenance. Buoys. With regard to the question of placing the unlit buoys recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, 1 estimate the cost as follows :— Jask .-—A fifth class conical buoy at Jask, about 100k complete with moorings. A sum of about 15k per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, &amp;c. Bunder Abbas .—A second class can buoy at the anchorage at Bunder Abbas, about 200k complete with moorings, &amp;c. A sum of 20k per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, &amp;c. Koiceit .—To replace the three existing buoys at Koweit belonging to the British India Company with two fifth class buoys and one second class can buoy, would probably involve an outlay of about 400Z., and an annual expenditure of about 50k for maintenance. Jadum .—To replace the existing Jadum buoy with a fifth class conical buoy would cost about 100k, and about 15Z. for annual maintenance. The unlit buoys required are, therefore, as follows :— Four fifth class buoys, plus two spare Two second class buoys, plus one spare Total - - - All of the unlit buoys could be constructed in Bombay.T To complete the first seven lights as recommended b\ the Committee o Enquiry in conjunction with the establishment of the Lmgah and Debai fort lights, would probably necessitate the following expenditure Lighthouses, &amp;c.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. D. W. Hood, A.M.Inst.C.E., Trinity House. Commander S. Litchfield, R.N., H.M.S. “Sphinx.” Commander W. G. Beauchamp, R.I.M., in charge of the Marine Survey of India. 1. The object of this Committee was to gather information and examine locally the general question of the proposed lighting of the Persian Gulf and improvement of the buoyage. The subjects for examination were to include the number of lights and buoys required, the best sites for the erection of the former, with class of light most suitable in each case, and cost of erection, maintenance, &amp;c. 2. Major Cox was unable to leave Bushire owing to the state of affairs in Persia, but the other members of the Committee, accompanied by Captain Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident, commenced their investigations at Muscat on 3rd April, when they embarked in the R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” Major Cox was subsequently able to join in the deliberations of the Committee at Bushire and is a party to the recommendations contained in this report. 3. The Committee were furnished with a copy of the report of an Admiralty conference on this question, and previous to the conclusion of their labours had the great advantage of meeting and conferring with Rear-Admiral E. J. Slade, M.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, who was a member of that conference. The proposals contained in that report have been carefully examined on the spot, and some modifications and additions are recommended in view of local conditions and experience. Cost has also been taken into consideration. The Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who was confidentially consulted by the Committee at Bombay, furnished suggestions for lighting the Gulf obtained from six captains of Gulf mail steamers.2 4. Abstract statement of the lights proposed by six officers in command of British India Steam Navigation Company’s mail steamers in Persian Gulf:— Place. Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. Place. Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. Muscat 6 Shah Allum Shoal 2 Jask - - - 2 Ras al Mutaf 5 Ras al Kuh 2 Bushire - - - 4 Musandam 6 Karag Island - 1 Bunder Abbas 1 Shatt al Arab Bar 3 Tanb Island 1 Ras al Arz 4 Lingah 1 Kubbar Island 2 Abu Musa 1 Farsi ... 1 Farur Island 2 Rennie Shoal 1 Nabiyu Farur 1 Bahrein ... 1 Kais Island 2 The above suggestions were, of necessity, rather hurriedly given, and would have been of greater value had they been put forward collectively instead of individually, and considerable divergence of opinion is apparent. The suggestions, however, include every place in the Gulf at which the establishment of a light could be reasonably entertained. Lights at Muscat, Musandam (Quoin), Bunder Abbas, Tanb, Lingah, Ras al Mutaf, Bushire, Shatt al Arab Bar, Ras al Arz, Kubbar, and Bahrein are included in the recommendations of the Committee. The lighting of Kais received special consideration, but Shaikh Shuaib is recommended in preference. Shah Allum and Rennie Shoals are undoubted dangers in the fairway of ships making for Bahrein from the east and north respectively, but the lighting of these shoals is not considered to be warranted at present. The lighting of Farsi Island will be desirable in the event of material development of trade between the north of the Gulf and Bahrein. It is not recommended at present. A light on Ras al Kuh would be useful to navigation, but is not recommended. It would be necessary to maintain an armed guard for its protection. It is not considered that lights are required at any of the other places mentioned. Existing Lights. 5. The only lights regularly exhibited in the Gulf at the present time are those at Koweit and Fao. The former is a fixed red light visible five miles, recently installed by the Government of India at the British Agency. The Fao lights are maintained by the Turkish authorities and are too feeble to be of much service.1 ^ fc&gt;en ^ S India Steam Navigation Company, at Bunder Abbas, Lmgah, Debai, and Koweit are in the habit of exhibiting a light on their premises when their steamers are expected. His Majesty s ships sometimes arrange with officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Stations at Bushire, Henjam, and Task for a light to be hoisted when they expect to arrive at night. Proposed Scheme. 6. A comprehensive scheme of lighting the Gulf and its approach will necessitate the establishment of lights at the following places taken in geographical order :— Muscat. Musandam (Quoin). Bunder Abbas. Tanb. Lingah. Shaikh Shuaib. Has al Mutaf. Bushire. Shatt al Arab Bar. Koweit. Bahrein. Debai. The above list includes the lighting at all places recommended by the Admiralty Conference with certain modifications (hereinafter detailed) for Bushire, Bahrein, Koweit, and Bunder Abbas, and additional lights at Tanb, Shaikh Shuaib, Ras al Mutaf, and Debai. The object in view has been to provide lights at the most important salient points and outlying dangers for general guidance in the navigation of the Gulf and at the principal ports. The lights at Tanb, Shaikh Shuaib, and. Ras al Mutaf are considered to be very necessary. They have an incidental advantage in completing an approximately equi-distant chain of lights. Muscat. A 20-mile light on the summit of Ras Muscat, which has an elevation of 240 feet above high-water, is recommended as combining efficiency with greatest economy. This proposal is made after consideration of the following points :— 1. The entrance to Muscat harbour is remarkably blind, but the coast in the vicinity is bold and free from outlying dangers. 2. The requirements of the port would be fulfilled by a low-placed light of moderate power to indicate the entrance of the harbour. 3. From a navigational point of view Fisher’s Rock offers an ideal site, but the cost of a safe structure, even for a small light, in such an exposed position would be very heavy. The alternative site on Ras Muscat is therefore recommended. Com pared with Fisher’s Rock a light on Ras Muscat is less favourably placed in thick weather, which, however, is not frequent, and it is 1J cables inside the outlying danger; on the other hand it would serve the double purpose of a4 J land fall and harbour light and has this additional advantage that ships bound from the Red Sea to the Gulf would pass well within the range of the llg No political difficulty with regard to the site is anticipated at Muscat. The blue light shown on the chart of the harbour and referred to on page 41 of Gulf Pilot no longer exists. It was never very useful. Musandam (Quoin). The Little Quoin provides a practical site for a light off Musandam, and is strongly recommended in preference to Musandam Island or Kachal Island, the alternative sites considered. The Quoin is already accessible on its northern end, and landing arrangements can be made comparatively easy. Owing to the severity of the climate and scarcity of sweet water in this part of the Gulf the establishment of an unwatched light was considered, but a light of that description of sufficient power is impracticable. A 20-mile watched light is recommended. The site selected is 134 feet above high-water. Arrangements can be made for storage of water and for its supply in common with other isolated lights. Bunder Abbas. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 15-mile light on Kishm. A suitable site, about one mile south of Kishm town (near tanks marked on chart) was examined, a light at this position would guide a ship approaching Bunder Abbas through the western channel between Larak Island and Kishm, but it is considered to be unfavourably situated without the addition of a lighted buoy for rounding the shoals extending miles off Kishm point. A red sector over Larak would be advisable, as both ends of the island are low. In case political difficulties should arise in connection with the establishment of a light on Kishm Island, it is recommended as an alternative that a light vessel of small type with range of about 10 miles should be moored on the outer extreme of the shoals off Kishm point. It is considered that the adoption of the alternative proposal, whilst largely overcoming any political difficulty, will effectively mark the shoal and be of sufficient range to afford guidance through the western channel. The establishment of a light on the Quoin to a large extent discounts the urgency of an important light at Kishm. Ships approaching from the south will have a good departure from that light to pass east of Larak. Ships approaching from the westward can, without greatly increasing their distance, make the Quoin light and pass east of Larak if the weather is unfavourable for the passage of the western channel. The present buoy marking the anchorage at Bunder Abbas is the property of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and should be replaced by a buoy with a distinctive top mark. Kais, Tanb, and Shaikh Shuaib. The navigation of the gulf between Musandam and Shaikh Shuaib presents many dangers at night, notably the flat shoal south west of Kishm Island, Tanb Island (in hazy weather), Farur Shoal, Kais Island, and Shaikh Shuaib Island. The efficient lighting of tins portion of the Gulf is regarded as important and it will be convenient to consider it as a whole.. lvais and Shualb being very low islands off high land are invisible at night. Kais is most dangerous to a ship altering course to the eastward after passing Shaikh Shuaib. A ship bound west can obtain an approximate position to enable her to clear Kais when passing Farur Island which is always visible on a clear dark night. Shaikh Shuaib is most dangerous to a ship hauling up to the northward after passing Kais. A light on Kais would obviate the danger which that island presents and give a departure point for clearing Shaikh Shuaib, but it would leave Shaikh Shuaib an unmarked danger to ships bound south and east and does not lend itself to any future development of the lighting system. A light on Shaikh Shuaib will eliminate the danger of that island, and give a departure point for clearing Kais on an easterly course. Taking advantage of Farur Island as a night mark east of Kais, the lighting of Shaikh Shuaib in preference to Kais is indicated as the best means of eliminating the danger presented by both islands. A 15-mile light on the south-west corner of Shaikh Shuaib is therefore recommended. The lighting of Tanb is also recommended. Course is altered off this island which cannot be always clearly seen at night. A light on Tanb will give a departure point to pass close to the north of Farur Island and clear of Farur Shoal, and serve as a clearing mark for the flat shoal off Kishm when making Lingah. The site selected is on the summit of the island 165 feet above high water, and near the north-west point. A 20-mile light is proposed. No political difficulty is anticipated with regard to Tanb, which belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah. The Persian Government would have to be approached with reference to Shaikh Shuaib or Kais. Kais and Farur were also visited. Lingah. The establishment of a port light to facilitate the approach to Lingah is recommended. It should be situated at a height of 30 to 40 feet above the ground in order to be conspicuous by its elevation above the lower lights in the town, and could be placed in the courtyard or in front of the new offices of the British India Steam Navigation Company. Local arrangements for the efficient maintenance of this light can be made. Ras al Mutaf. A light at Ras al Mutaf is considered necessary. All traffic from Koweit, Shatt al Arab, and Bushire, converges on, and rounds this point, and the establishment of an 11-mile light vessel near the 10-fathom patch south west of the shoals is recommended. A shore light is clearly unsuitable owing to the extent of the shoal off the shore.f ;k Bushire. The erection of a 15-mile lighthouse on shore as proposed by the Admiralty Conference was considered. It is possible that the Persian Government may place obstacles in the way of the establishment of a light on shore. This difficulty can be avoided and the requirements of navigation better provided for by the establishment of an 11-mile light vessel moored in the outer anchorage, especiallv in hazy weather when, owing to the distance of the shore inside the 5-fathom line, the efficiency of a lighthouse on shore, both as a night and day mark, would be considerably reduced. A light vessel is therefore recommended. There is a beacon on Ras al Margh marking western limit of Lakfa Sands which is a useful mark for the inner anchorage. There are no buoys. The beacon and two buoys were established by the Belgian Customs officials at Bushire about four years ago. The buoys have disappeared, and the beacon is at present practically demolished. A gas buoy to mark the position of the inner anchorage off Ras al Marg is recommended, in which case the reconstruction of the beacon will be unnecessary, and both anchorages will be accessible at night. Shatt al Arab Bar. A light vessel with an 11-mile range, to mark the approach to the Bar is required. An approximate position four miles south-east of the outer buoy, as proposed by the Admiralty Conference, is concurred in. The total number of buoys at present maintained by the British India Steam Navigation ^Company is seven, one of which, the “ Lawrence,” is in the old channel, now disused, and serves no useful purpose. It is considered that, in addition to the light vessel, the lighting of the Bar channel buoys is necessary. There is no great difficulty in navigating the river between Basra and Fao at night, and it is frequently done. It is not proposed to deal with the lighting or buoyage of the river above Fao in this report, but it maybe a matter for future consideration in the event of development of trade at Mohammerah and Basra. The passage of the Bar at night offers considerable risk and difficulty. Ships which arrive at Fao or the outer buoy at night, and wish to avail themselves of a high night tide, attempt the crossing of the Bar at night, and stranding is not infrequent. British India mail steamers very often have to cross at night, but generally make arrangements for the buoys to be lit temporarily by a boat sent out from Fao. As foi six months of the year the night tides are considerably higher than the day tides, the safe passage of the Bar by night may be an important matter for a large steamer, as a deeper draught is permissible than would be the case if choice is restricted to a day tide. A night passage might also, in some cases, obviate the necessity for completing with cargo outside the Bar, and would at all times of the year be of great advantage to the mail steamers which have to keep time.t is recommended that immediately before the light vessel is established a careful re survey of the liar should be carried out by a surveying ship, and the channel marked by a series of lighted buoys laid in accordance with the result of the new survey. This may also affect the position of the light \ essel. It is anticipated that four buoys will be required. The British India Steam Navigation C ompany s mail steamers have ceased use of the Admiralty charts, and rely on a recent survey (1907) of the Bar made by one of their officers, Mr. Burgess. Until a new and official survey has been made, it is not considered practicable to put forward proposals for rearranging and relaying the existing buoys. It is quite possible that a new survey may disclose the fact that the eastern channel is the better. This is indicated by the latest Admiralty survey. The channel buoyed as proposed will require periodical examination to verify soundings, and it may be necessary to occasionally shift the buoys to suit variations in the channel. It is suggested that one of the officers of the vessel which will be required as a lighthouse tender should be a qualified surveyor. The Fao lights maintained by the Turkish Authorities are feeble and unreliable, but navigation would be rendered practically independent of them if a five-mile gas buoy were placed on the inner Bar. The lighting of the Shatt-al-Arab is regarded as the most important item in the whole lighting scheme for the Gulf. It is pointed out that certain of these buoys will fall, as do the present ones, within the territorial waters of Turkey or Persia. Hitherto this fact has been ignored in practice, and it is believed that the Local Authorities have never interested themselves or raised objections in connection with the British India Steam Navigation Company’s arrangements for buoying the Bar. It does not appear to be the province of this Committee to do more than draw attention to this aspect of the case. Koweit. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island, and a 10-mile light on Ras al Arz. There can be no doubt that from a navigational point of view the approach to the port would thus be effectively lighted, but it must be pointed out that the height of the tower required for a 20-mile light on Kubbar would be approximately twice that necessary for a 15-mile light. The height of the site on Kubbar Island is only 5 feet above high water. In view of the heavy cost involved in the erection of a tower for a 20-mile light, a light of only 15-mile range is recommended, in which case the range of the light proposed for Ras al Arz should be mci eased to 12 miles, which would involve little extra cost. Although the range of a 15-mile light will not extend to the island and shoals south-east of Failaka Island, a ship bound from the Shatt al Arab Bar to Koweit should have no difficulty in clearing those dangers, as a run of about 20 miles after losing sight of the Bar light will bring a 15-mile light on Kubbar within range. Even a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island would not effectively guard the Madura shoal. The suggestion with regard to Kubbar is only put forward provisionally in view of The incomplete survey of this locality. It is recommended that theneighbourhood be re-surveyed, the position and extent of the Madura shoal verified, and the absence of other dangers placed beyond doubt. The result of this survey may conceivably indicate the necessity for modifications in the position and type of the outer light proposed for this port. With regard to the proposal to place an unwatched light on the existing beacon at Ras al Arz, it is found that the beacon is not suitably constructed for supporting a light. A 12-mile light on a new structure adjacent to the site of the existing beacon is recommended. As it is necessary to. maintain a watchman to guard the day mark at Ras al Arz from depredation by Bedouin, it would be inadvisable to place an unwatched light at this point. The Political Agent anticipates no danger of interference if local light keepers are employed. Sheikh Mobarak of Koweit appears to be much interested in the proposal to light the port, and is unlikely to place any difficulty in the way. Good water is available within a mile of the Ras al Arz site, but arrangements for storage of water would be necessary on Kubbar. There are three buoys marking the anchorage, maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company. No additional buoyage is required as far as the anchorage is concerned. The Political Agent desired that the question of the channel into Shweikh should be gone into in view of possible future developments. It is considered that two small mark buoys will suffice, and that these should be preferably provided and maintained by local arrangement, as this Khor is only used as an anchorage for the Political Agent’s launch, the Sheikh’s steam yacht, and other small craft. The light, fixed red, visible five miles, recently established at the Agency by the Indian Government, meets all requirements as a harbour light. r Ihe Admiralty Conference propose the erection of— (1) a 20-mile light on Fasht ad Dibal, and (2) a 12-mile light on Muharrak. While the usefulness of the former is apparent, the proposed light on Muharrak is considered to be situated too far from the navigable channel to oil6i complete facilities for entering the port by night ft is possible that the establishment of a light on that island would not be altogether palatable to the Sheikh, but, in the Resident’s opinion, his objection could be overcome. In any case it is recommended that, instead o this lighthouse, a small light vessel, or gas boat, be established half a mile outside the shoal near the present outer buoy, and that the existing Kaseifa and West Spit buoys be replaced by lighted buoys, the Jadum buoy beino- retained in its present position. ° A 10-mile floating light at the entrance to the channel as above suggested vould actually illuminate a more useful area than a 12-mile light on : u larrak while it would indicate, without doubt, the entrance to the channel, which is necessary, if any scheme is to be effective. A making light for the port from the east and north is necessarv, and a ig n raving a range of about 20 miles on the north side of the reef at Fasht ad Dibal would be m the best position.Although it is feaied that the cost of building a suitable structure on an exposed site, such as the reef, may he considered prohibitive, no other position offers equal advantages from a navigational point of view. The only alternative is to establish a light vessel about 5 miles north east of the reef in such a position that the range of visibility will overlap that of the gas boat or smaller vessel at the entrance to the channel, to ensure that either one or the other will be seen by a ship approaching from the north. There are numerous dangers in the approaches to this port. The tides in the locality are strong, and uncertain in direction. A large and totally unexpected set is no uncommon experience, and it is regarded as essential that when the lighting of Bahrein is undertaken it should be carried out as a whole, i.e., the making light be established at the same time as the channel light and buoys. Fasht ad Dibal shoal was visited and examined, but a detailed survey and borings will be necessary before any work is undertaken on the reef. Debal. There has recently been a considerable increase in trade at this place and it may be expected to still further develop. Mail and other steamers call there regularly, and it is recommended that a port light similar to that already proposed for Lingah be established on the sea front. Local arrangements for the efficient maintenance of this light can be made. Order of Importance. 7. It is considered that the lights proposed should be arranged in the following order of importance : — (1.) Shatt al Arab Bar, light vessel and four buoys. (2.; Musandam (Little Quoin). (3.) Muscat. (4.) Bushire. (5.) Shaikh Shuaib. (6.) Ras al Mutaf. (7.) Tanb. (8.) Kubbar Island (Koweit). (9.) Ras al Arz (Koweit). (10.) Bahrein. (11.) Lingah. (12.) Debai. (13.) Bunder Abbas. The first seven lights, being those most urgently required, are suggested as a convenient first instalment of the general scheme. The position assigned to Kubbar Island or its alternative in the above list has been determined upon what appear to be the claims of the port from the navigational point of view under existing conditions. Should there be orounds for taking specific account of the probability of Koweit increasing quickly in importance in connection with the building of the Baghdad Railway, its relative position in the list would be materially advanced. The port lights proposed for Lingah and Debai being inexpensive items are recommended for early establishment in any case.10 Buoys and Beacons. 8. The following Persian Gulf :— is a correct list of the buoys and beacons now in the Buoys. Beacons. Bunder Abbas Bahrein Bushire - Koweit - - - Shatt al Arab Bar - Total - 1 - 4 1 - — 1 - 3 1 - 7 — - 15 3 All the above, with the exception of the beacons at Bushire and Koweit, are the property of, and are maintained by, the British India Steam Navigation Company. The beacon on Ras al Marg, at Bushire, was erected about four years ago by the Belgian Customs officials, and is the property of their department. Two buoys were laid at the same time, but they have disappeared. The spar buoys shown on plan of Bushire anchorage no longer exist. The beacon is in a bad state of repair. Koweit beacon was erected, and is maintained, on Ras al Arz by the Indian Government. The Bahrein beacon is liable to be washed away, and needs reconstructing. The Lawrence buoy on Shatt al Arab Bar marks the old channel which is now silted up, and serves no useful purpose. The spar buoys shown on the chart of Shatt al Arab Bar east of inner Bar channel no longer exist. Proposals for improving Buoyage :— Jask.—A small unlit buoy on the tail of the shoal extending two miles north-west of Task Point would be of great convenience to ships entering the anchorage. Bunder Abbas.—A buoy with a distinctive top-mark in lieu of the existing anchorage buoy is recommended. If a lighthouse is erected at Kishm a lighted buoy m addition to that marking the anchorage will be required outside the shoals off Kishm Point. Bushue. A gas buoy to mark the inner anchorage is proposed. It should be moored off Ras al Marg and will render the re-construction of the beacon unnecessary and enable ships to enter the inner anchorage at night. Shaft al Arab Bar.—Four gas buoys to replace the existing buoys have been provisionally recommended in the proposals for lighting the Bar. A re-survey of the Bar will be required before they are laid. Koweit. The present system of buoying the anchorage is satisfactory. 1 he retention of the beacon will be unnecessary when the Ras al Arz light is erected. Bahrein. In dealing with the scheme for lighting Bahrein it has been pioposed that a gas boat should replace the present outer buoy and that gas buoys should be moored off Ras Kaseifa and the West Spit. The existing buoy off Jadum should be retained. The beacon needs reconstructing.&gt; ♦ 11 Ihe foiegoing proposals, if adopted, will involve the removal of the whole of the existing buoys on the Shaft al Arab Bar, the buoy at Bunder Abbas, and three buoys at Bahrein. Ihe only remaining buoys of the present system will be three at Koweit and one at Bahrein. In the opinion of the Committee the British India Steam Navigation Company assess the value of their buoys at a figure which is not justified by then appaient condition. Nothing is known as to the condition of the moorings. A copy of correspondence with the Company on this subject is attached. In preference to taking over any buoys from the British India Steam Navigation Company it is suggested that a more satisfactory course will be to lay new buoys on the uniform system in those positions where it is proposed in this report that buoys should be retained or established. 9.

The lights on all the buoys should have distinctive characters, and it is proposed that all lights be white, except those on the buoys at the West Spit (Bahrein), and the inner anchorage (Bushire), for which red lights are suggested. The total number of lights and buoys in the proposed scheme is Lighthouses - 31 re Lie’ht vessels - 4 1 1 b o Port lights 2 | or if alternative pro- f posals are adopted ^ 2 i _ Lighted buoys - 8 ! ! 7 Unlighted buoys - ej u Fog Signals. 10. The question of fog signals has been considered, but though hazy weather is not uncommon, fog is of rare occurrence and short duration in the Gulf, and fog signals are not considered necessary. Lightkeepers. 11. From inquiries made it is considered that the Gulf Arab could be trained into a reasonably good lightkeeper, and there are obvious advantages in the employment of local men, but in the case of the light vessels the lightsmen might with advantage be recruited from India. In any case the crews of light vessels and lighthouses in isolated positions should be armed. Lighthouse Tender. 12. The whole of the Persian Gulf would form a large lighthouse district in itself, and it would lie imperative that a specially constructed steamer, to act as the lighthouse tender, be built and kept m (Commission solely for this duty which would occupy the whole of her time. A distilling plant and stoiage foi the supply of drinking water to isolated lighthouses and light vessels should be special features of her equipment. The construction of this vessel should be undertaken before, or concurrently with, the establishment of the earlier lights. Water. 13. One of the principal difficulties in connection with the maintenance of lighthouses and vessels in the Persian Gulf is obtaining and supplying them with fresh water. The only place in the Gulf where drinking water in any quantity can be procured conveniently is the Shatt al Arab River above Fao. This would necessitate the lighthouse tender making frequent trips to the river and the provision of a large storage capacity which space could be more usefully devoted to other purposes. In view of these considerations a distilling plant on board the tender has been recommended. Repairs, Ac. 14. With the exception of Basra the Gulf offers practically no facilities lor repair or constructional work.13 i m i llie works of Messrs. Lynch at Basra were, however, visited, and the opinion formed that that firm would he capable of executing most general repairs. Depot. 15. lire establishment of a Depot at Basra offers advantages, but there aie political objections to that course, and the distance up the river is a considerable inconvenience. Other places were considered and examined in this connection, notably, Koweit, which is the only port in the Gulf where a vessel of even moderate draught can approach near the shore. Land could be obtained there on the mainland opposite Jezirat Kurein. The Committee consider that Koweit will be the most convenient place for the establishment of a Depot. The requirements of the Depot will be detailed in a separate report by Mr. Hood. Gas Buoys. 16. The scheme proposed concentrates practically all the gas buoys at one end of the Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of their maintenance by the lighthouse tender. Maintenance. 17. From the point of view of practical convenience and expedience, apart from any question of the incidence of cost, it appears to the Committee that the Government of India are clearly in the best position to undertake the arrangements necessary for the up-keep of the lights and buoys decided upon, and for the administration of the lighting system generally, assuming that no international complications arise to interfere with such a course. Estimates. 18. The question of estimates of first cost and maintenance will be dealt with in detail in a supplementary report by Mr. Hood. Light Dues. 19. The problem of the recovery of light dues has not been overlooked but it appears to the Committee to be one of great complication, the discussion of which does not fall within the scope of their instructions. 20. A general chart of the Persian Gulf showing the suggested positions of the lights and the usual steamer routes is forwarded herewith. 21. The Committee desire to place on record their appreciation of the ready assistance given by the Commander and officers of the R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” P. Z. Cox, Major. David W. Hood. S. Litchfield. W.

(Communicated by Foreign Office 19th February 1907.) Bear Mr. Maxwell, I mentioned to you the other day, when at the Foreign Office, that we had heard from India that the Hamburg-American Company had proposed to our people there that they should contribute to the up-keep of our navigation buoys in the Persian Gulf. We have told our people in reply that we prefer to continue to bear the cost of the maintenance of the buoys ourselves. As I mentioned to you, these buoys were put down by the British India Company some 20 or 30 years ago, and they have been kept in position and maintained by the Company ever since, and they have been used by all steamers frequenting the Persian Gulf without any charge having been made for their use by the British India Company. In fact we would have no means of collecting a charge had we desired to make one. It was, of course, no disadvantage to us that other steamers should use the buoys, and we had never thought of asking them to contribute. I cannot help fancying, as I mentioned to you at our meeting the other day, that there is a political move behind this proposal of the Hamburg-American Company, the object being to give Germany a vested interest in the Persian Gulf. It has occurred to me that it might be a good thing politically for us to make over the ownership of these buoys to His Majesty’s Government. I may say at once that I do not make the suggestion in order that the British India Company may benefit pecuniarily, either in the way of being repaid the cost of buoys or in escaping from the charge for their maintenance. In fact, to avoid any idea of this sort, we should be quite prepared to hand the buoys over to the Government for a nominal consideration, and we would still maintain them free of cost in return for their use. Yours sincerely, James L. Mack ay. Enclosure in Foreign Office Letter of 4th June 1908. Foreign Office, Dear Sir James Mackay. 4th June 1908. We have been considering, in consultation with the Board of Trade, the question of the buoys in the Persian Gulf. You are no doubt aware that the Germans are anxious to participate in the laying down and up-keep of the buoys : indeed, I understand that they have already offered to share expenses with the British India Steam Navigation Company in the matter.16 Sir E. Grey attaches great importance to the maintenance of this service in British hands, and he desires me to ask you whether, in order that our position in regard to the buoys may be made doubly secure, the British India Steam Navigation Company would still be willing, as suggested by you in your letter to Mr. Maxwell of 15th February 1907, to make over their existing buoys to His Majesty’s Government, who would, Sir E. 'Grey hopes, be able to maintain them, free of cost to the Company, for the benefit of British shipping in the Gulf. I may add that we are at present in communication with the Admiralty with regard to the laying down of some additional buoys in the Gulf waters, which would be maintained by His Majesty’s Govern ment, in connection with those at present owned by the British India Steam Navigation Company, should the latter find themselves in agreement with the above proposal. Yours sincerely, Sir J. L. Mackay, G.C.M.G., Charles Hardinge. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Sir J. Mackay, British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, to J. E. Ferard, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 9, Throgmorton Avenue, London, 4th September 1908. We have now received full particulars from Bombay, showing the buoj'S belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company in the Persian Gulf, together with charts showing the positions of the buoys marked thereon. You will observe that there are no buoys belonging to the Com pany in Bushire. There are 17 buoys altogether in the Persian Gulf belonging to the Company ; 15 are marked on the chart, and the other two, which were sent up in July 1908 to be placed at the mouth of the Shatt-al- Arab, had not been actually placed when Bombay wrote on 31st July, but we will get information from Bombay showing where these last two buoys had been placed. I enclose a letter, dated 31st July, from Bombay, giving particulars of the buoys, showing their cost. I also send five charts, in which the position o all the buoys is marked, with the exception of the two at the mouth of the fehatt-al-Arab to which I have referred above. In case these charts should go adrift again, please note that I have kept a spare copy in this office. Jas. Mackay. JNo. 270. Dear Sir, Bombay, 31st July 1908. Navigation in Persian Gulf.

Rs. 34,366 4 8 The dates given in respect of the buoys at the entrance to the Shatt al Arab are approximate only, as available records here do not go back to that date. With regard to the present value of the buoys, we consider a fair estimate would be to take the original cost. Many of the original buoys, with their moorings, have been renewed since first laid down, and as the Company keeps the buoys, &amp;c., in a good state of repair, and incurs considerable expense in upkeep, there is practically no difference between the original and the present value.We advised in our letter No. 226, of 3rd instant, that two buoys were being sent up owing to a change in the channel at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab. We have no information so far as to whether both these buoys have been made use of, or whether the Commander of the “Megna,” who is re-buoying the bar, has been able to lift and make use of the old buoys. An attempt to lift one of the old buoys failed. So soon as we can obtain definite information we shall advise you. The charts sent by this mail give the position so far as it is known to us, but do not include the two new buoys now being laid. We are, &amp;c., Mackinnon, Mackenzie, &amp; Co., P. W.

The choice lies between a light on the Persian Coast near Tarn, or one on an island off the Musandim Peninsula. The former is preferable from a navigational point of view, but the danger of interference with the light would necessitate the provision of a guard. It is considered, therefore, impracticable to place the light on the Persian Coast. Of the islands off the Musandim Peninsula the best appears to be that of Little Quoin, provided that the site is practicable ; this will have to be investigated. Failing the Little Quoin, Ivachalu islet, on the eastern entrance of Musandim Island, might possibly be suitable. Bandar A bbas. A 15-mile light on Kishm is necessary. This might be unwatched. One buoy is maintained by the British India Company, and this appears to be sufficient. Ling a. An unwatched light is recommended to replace the present temporary light. Bahrein. (i) At Fasht-ad-Dibal a 20-mile light is considered essential on the reef. (ii) At Muharrach a 12-mile light (unwatched) is considered necessary. There are at present four buoys and one white stone beacon in Bahrein Harbour maintained by the British India Company. These are considered sufficient for the present. Bushire. An unwatched light is required on the cliff at Bushire, sufficiently elevated to show on a south bearing over the tops of trees on the low land to the southward. This should be a 15-mile light. There are already two buoys and a beacon which are considered sufficient lor all practical purposes. Koweit Harbour. (i.) On Jezirat Kubbar a 20-mile light is required ^ (n.)

It has been explained above (paragraph 3) that in framing the foreeoinsrAs regards the cost of the scheme it is not possible to form a reliable estimate owing to the fact that the amount of both the initial and recurring charges depends largely on the local circumstances and can only be estimated on the spot. It should be explained, however, that the establish ment of lights involves the provision of a small vessel fitted as a lighthouse tender, besides the necessary plant for the manufacture of the gas for supplying the unwatched lights. As regards diplomatic difficulties, we note that our proposals will presumably involve arrangement with the Persian authorities, the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, or any others who may be interested. It seems desirable, therefore, to arrange in order of their importance the lights required for the navigation of the Persian Gulf. This order is considered to be as follows :— (1.) Musandim. (2.) Maskat. (3.) Bushire. (4.) Shat-el-Arab (a light vessel). (5.) Muharrack (Bahrein). (6.) Fasht-ad-Dibal (Bahrein). (7.) Jezirat Kubbar (Koweit). (8.) Bandar Abba-s. (9.) Ras-al-Arz (Koweit). (10.) Linga. 5. (c) Maintenance of Lights and Buoys .—It is suggested that the Government of India should be invited to arrange for the maintenance of the buoys and lighthouses in the Persian Gulf by the Royal Indian Marine, or in whatever manner they should think fit. 6. (d) Apportionment of Cost .—It is suggested that the cost should be divided equally between British and Indian revenues, this being the principle usually followed with regard to Persian expenditure. As to the amount, it has been already explained (paragraph 4) that no reliable estimate can be at present furnished. A. Mostyn Field. Edmond J. W. Slade, D.N.I. J. E.
