State as simply and concisely as possible, and without any attempt at legal phraseology the manner in which you desire to dispose of your property. Careful attention to the following remarks will supply so much of the Law as is necessary for an ordinary will. Particular attention must be paid to the legal formalities required in the execution of the will. Codicils should never be attempted by non-professional persons ; it is, in fact, gener ally easier to re-write the will than to make a codicil. All property may be disposed of by will; but no person under the age of twenty-one years can make a will. livery Woman married after the ist January, 1883, can, on attaining twenty-one, make a will disposing of all real and personal property which belonged to her at her marriage, or has been acquired by her, or has devolved upon her since her marriage ; and any Woman married before the ist January, 1883, can make a will disposing of property belonging to her for her separate use, or over which she has a testamentary power of appointment, and can also make a will of all real and personal property, her title to which shall accrue after the^ist January, 1883. Every will should be signed at the foot or end thereof (that is immediately under the last line of it, and without leaving any space between the last line and the name), by the person making it, or by some other person,in his presence and by his direction ; such signature must be in the presence of two witnesses at least, who should sign their names and addresses against the attestation clause before leaving the Testator’s presence; and against every alteration and interlineation, made before the will is executed, the Testator and the Witnesses must sign their names ; nothing should be scratched out, or erased, or the will might be held incapable of proof. A person, or the wife or husband of a person who takes anything under the will, should not be a Witness : for though the will would not be affected thereby, the gift to such person, or to the wife or husband of such person woul d be altogether void. An Executor may be a Witness, though it is better that he should not be one, as any legacy to him would thereby be made void. A legacy to a friend is made wid ov “ lapses ” by his death before the testator’s, but a legacy to a testator’s child does not lapse by his death, if such child leaves issue living at the testator’s death, in which case the legacy goes to the child’s executors or a dministrators. A concise and Legal Form of a Will may be bad of the Publishers of this Book. Price 6 d. ; by letter post 7 stamps.

Dated entries start from 7 May and end at 30 December (some dates in between these dates do not have any entries). The entries are usually brief (although entries for some dates run over into the space for the entry for the next date).Hirtzel’s diary entries mostly concern John Morley (Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India, referred to as ‘J.M.’ throughout), and mainly record the following: conversations between Hirtzel and Morley; the views and opinions expressed by Morley on various issues, mainly relating to India and India Office business, and on various individuals (as recorded by Hirtzel); meetings between Morley and various individuals; Cabinet and Committee meetings and other events attended by Morley; and Morley’s moods, feelings and health (as recorded by Hirtzel).The diary records meetings between Morley and individuals including: King Edward VII (9 May, folio 54 verso; 22 October, folio 105 verso; 24 November, folio 115 recto); the Prince of Wales (the future King George V) (10 May, folio 56 recto); Gopal Krishna Gokhale (9 May, folio 54 verso; 23 May, folio 58 verso; 31 May, folio 62 recto; and 1 August, folio 79 verso); George Nathaniel Curzon (7 July, folio 73 recto; 29 October, folio 107 verso); and Henry Campbell-Bannerman (Prime Minister) (3 September, folio 90 verso).It includes entries relating to discussions between Hirtzel and Morley regarding issues including: Morley’s proposal to put a native Indian judge on his own Council (17 July, folio 75 verso); and the Government of India’s relations with Tehran, and Morley’s resolve that the Government of India should not be regarded as an independent power (4 September, 92 recto; and 12 September 94 recto).The ‘Memoranda’ section at the start of the diary contains notes by Hitzel regarding Morley receiving his seals of office as Secretary of State for India and appointing Hirtzel as his Private Secretary, and Morley’s views on the following: the military administration question, Tibet, Afghanistan, Aden, the Defence Committee, Lord Kitchener, and the Partition of Bengal.The volume itself is a
