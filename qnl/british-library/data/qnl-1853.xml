(b) The man also brought the news that it was pretty certain that the now famous Riath prisoners Naif bin Rithlain I bn Lami and Ibn Humaid , had been murdered by Bin Baud T s orders. They had apparently been sent in 3 lorries ostensibly to Hoffuf, in response to the long made demand of Ibn Jaloui that the prisoners should be dealt with by him. The lorries had, it seems, never reached Hoffuf, but returned empty to Riath the next day. It was everywhere in Riath whispered that the prisoners had been shot and buried in the Dahana sands by a party sent by Ibn Jaloui to take them over. In this co nection see para V.b.(ix) and V.c.(i) of this Office Summary for August 1933. CGI.II5IH?. The story of the murder of these unfortunate wretche; has reached Kuwait from so many sources during September and October that I cannot but come to the regretful con clusion that the incident is true. The Ajman and Kutair tribes hoping against hope that Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lami, their chieftains were still alive, have refused so far to believe that Ibn Baud would lend himself to such a dastardly deed, but even they have resigned themselves to what they believe to be the truth at last. It is said that no one but members of Bin Saud T s slave bodyguard accompanied the prisoners when they set out ) xlU Lh- 2 - set out in the lorries, and that even the lorry drivers were slaves* Hence there were no „rab eye witnesses of the deed, for slaves donot ever talk. Three things however are certain and have been amply corroborated by -ijman and I'utair tribal report: (a) The prisoners actually set out for Hoffuf and were seen. (b) The old Ajman woman who cooked the prisoners 1 food and sent it to their prison daily, was told she need no longer cook their food as the prisoners had left the previous day for Hassa. (c) The prisoners never reached Hoffuf. COiHlIM 1 . Ibn Jaloui had many times and publicly vowed that he would take the life of Naif ibn Hath la in for the part he took in the killing of his son Hahad bin Jaloui in 1929 as well as execute Ibn Lami and Ibn 'urnaid if they ever fell into his hands. The Kings leniency where these men were concerned had for long caused a 'coolness' between the Governor of Hassa and his ''aster. (C) In view of the King’s written assurance to His I.lajesty’s Government, riven through the late Sir Hugh Biscoe at Khabari ,/adtha after the ^Jchwan rebellion of 1929/30 that Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lami would not be put to death, but with Haisal al Duwish would only be kept in prison for a reasonable period, if they were handed over by His I.lajesty’s Government, it is hoped that Jedda will cause careful and exhaustive enquiries to be made into the truth of the above story. The incident is of the highest importance in Bedouin eyes for all know of the promise given by the King to His Majesty’s Government, and England will be accused of a greivous breach of faith if these men have indeed been ’put away’. ***** ***** 4 .mmmm (Taken from Kuwait Intelligence Summary for November 1934.) Y.aiiVTH ;j:d v^r ruiiours * / 2 .(g) News re: Hiath Prisoners. ( See para 11.3(b) of Summary No.262, dated the 30th October 1933. Juraa related that he was himself present when they were removed from prison in Riath, a week before the Shaikh of Qatar arrived at the Capital (1st September). The circumstances were as follows: (i) Six of Bin Jaloui T s cars, 8 cylinder Buick, 4 lorries and 1 Chevrolet arrived at Riath from Hoffuf bringing Amir Faisal f s wife (the grand-daugh ter of Ibn Jaloui). (ii) Bin Saud seized opportunity of sending the following prisoners to Hoffuf in the cars: Sultan ibn Humaid , Naif ibn Hathla in, Ibn Lami, 14 other Ataiba Shaikhs. (iii) The greatest secrecy was observed during their removal, which took place at 11.30 P.M. iill approaches to the prison v/ere guarded, and drivers were forbidden to blow horns either in Riath or at Hoffuf on arrival. (iv) The prisoners when brought out looked ill and worn, ibn Hathlain T s left aim was still in splints, as result of beating he had received when he was suspected of having connived at the attempted escape of Ataiba Shaikh last Summer (reported). (v) Cars left at midnight and made fast journey to Hoffuf under guard of 18 selected slaves of Ibn Jaloui Chevrolet in front, 4 lorries in centre and big Buick in rear. (iv) Convoy entered Hoffuf also at midnight in greatest secrecy and prisoners were placed in the Kut2 Kut prison in underground dungeons. (vii)Juina received details of journey from the Somali driver of the 8 cylinder Buick (his friend) who returned to Hath 8 days after, with ^bdulla bin Thani, Shaikh of Qatar. (viii)Juma was told by this driver that if prisoners were not secretly executed by Ibn Jaloui, as the Negro guards opined they would be, they could not long survive the dungeon life where no light penetrated at all. (ix) Juma T s view^ was that the King intended than to be secretly put away, and so had sent them to Bin Jaloui. The above I believe to be the true story of the many contradictory rumours that have come up to Kuwait regarding the execution of the xiath prisoners. Nor do I think the latter had even a sporting chance, once they were transferred to the Amir of Hassa f s unlovely hands. ****** ******if ® CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, My attention has been dravrn to the desirability of elucidating the facts connected with the alleged murder of certain Sa’udi state nrisoners, including Tbn Hithlain and Ibn Lami, in view of the rumours renroduced in recen**- Kuwait Intelligence Summaries, notably that ^o r C c t 0 ber^ As you are awa^e, I have no means whatsoever of investigating such a met ter here but when Mr. Calvert drew my attention to the reports on my return from leave, I agreed with him that they deserved careful attention. I may , say, however, with great deference to Col. Dickson’s greater knowledge of Arabian life, that I thought i+ unlikely that T bn Sa’ud would break his word in a matter of this kind and equally unlikelv that he would challenge the hostility of important sections of the AJman, Mutair and Ateyba tribes at a + ime when he was so deeply embroiled in his difficulties with the Imam Yahya. 2. In these circumstances, I decided to nut a straifdit qu^s+ion to 5\iad Bey Hamza as soon as I could, do so orally. I told him on December 29th,that, while I dtrib did not normally a +f ach imuortance to such rumours, those regarding the three prisoners in question were so positive and so persistent as to suggest malicious invention or distortion of s one thing that had happened.

'Aiad Bey reminded me, quite justly, that the King’s pledge did not apply to Ibn Human d (Sultan ibn Bujad) whose name I had mentioned with the others. Hr begged me to believe that the King r;as incauable of breaking his promise he conveyed to me the King’s assurance that Ibn Lami and ibn Hithlain were alive, and told me in reply to an inquiry, idjrarir which I express ly put as a matter of curiosity, that Ibn Bujad was also alive. Having received in the meantime the original murder story, I said to ^iad Bey that I now had action might out rage him so greatly as to uroduce a definite co olne ss/ but he undertook to enquire into tie facts. On January 10th Colonel Dickson’s renort for December, which cast doubt on reason to believe that the three Shaikhs had been removed to Hofuf and thonrht that this might have given rise to the first reports. ^uad 3ey promised to inquire further. On •Tanuaiy ?4, when I reverted to the metier, he renewed the King’s assurance that the men were alive but said that His Majesty begg-ed to be excused, for reasons of internal uolicy, from disclosing their whereabouts. 4. I do not feel that I can ptorsue the matter fhrther, unless you consider that the precise nature of the treatment of Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lam4 is a matter of such moment to His Majesty’s Government as to justify them in calling the Kimr to account for his harshness, on the strength of rumours, which, howeveiirobable, cannot he proved. Such&lt;-£399pmpg5P| — 3— coolness between him and His Majesty’s Government. I an not myself in favour of it and I do not think it would in any way help the two Shaikhs. I canrot doubt ♦he King’s formal assurance that they are alive. * have little doubt that they have been in fact removed to Hofuf and I believe Ibrr Jiluwi, the Governor of Has a, to be a cruel gaoler, but I do not think that even Ibn Jiluwi would murder these men in defiance df the King. In my oninion, what ^ have already done will at least suffi ce to remind Ibn Sa’ud that His Majesty’s Government are not indifferent to the fate of Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami. 5. I took an opportunity An the course of my conversations with ^\iad Bey of suggesting that the King mipht well, after this lapse of time, relax his severity ar d treat these prisoners in the same wa' r as many others who are kept under a sort of open arrest at Riyadh. I cannot be sure that ^uad Bey would pass this on to the King bu+ T think the best hone for these unfortunate men is that, when his present troubles are ended, Ibn Ba’ud will relent somewhat. He has already shown signs of anxiety to disarm hostility among +he Ajman and Mutair. As for Ibn Humaid, ^ad s ey + ol'i me snontaneously that anneals had been made to the King on hie beh&amp;if hut had not been successful. H e added that Ibn Humaid was not really bad-hearted but rather a simple soul. I recalled the time when he had. been so good a servant that he had been one of the conquerors of Mecca. 6.
