Sir, I have the honour to state, for your informa tion, that Sharif Ahmed Am Muhsin of Beihan, a stipendiary Chief in the Aden Protectorate, has informed me, that he has abdicated his Chief ship in favour of his grandson Salih bin Husein, aged 8 years. His action has been confirmed by the Head Sheikhs of his dependencies the Mas’abis and Bal Harith and almost all his relations. During his minority Sharif Husein bin Ahmed Am Muhsin the father of the young chief vill act as his advisor or regent. This election is in order, and I have therefore accorded recognition to Sharif Salih bin Husein bin Ahmed Am Muhsin of Beihan, and authorised the payment to him of the stipend previously enjoyed by his grandfather Sharif Ahmed Am Muhsin of Beihan in accordance with the authority contained in Colonial Office despatch No. S2 dated 30th May, 1929. I have, dc. f (Signed) M.C. Lake. Acting Resident etc. His Majesty’s secretary of State for the Colonies, London.^ No.91. THE RESIDENCY, Aden, 4 April 1934. I have the honour to refer to your despetoh i.o. 1 dated 4th January 1933 in which you authorised the payment to His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Luka 11a of tne arrears of his stipend for a period of three years only from 1st April 1930 to 31st March 19--*3. Tne Sultan has been informed of your decision, b-^t lie has not yet drawn the amount which you have sanctioned. E. In your despatch under reference you anticipated that difficulty might be experienced in resisting pay ment of the whole of the arrears which have accrued in the event of the Sultan invoking his Treaty obligations. This difficulty has now arisen, as the Sultan has addressed a letter to me on the 27th February in which ne as^s ior reconsideration of this question on the ground that he is entitled to the full arrears under the terms of his Treaty of 1882 with the 'British Govern ment, in which there is no stipulation that he is bound to draw his stipend annually, or that he will be de prived of it if he fails to do so* He further represents that his stipend was allowed to fall into arrears because of its small annual amount, that his predecessor aultan His Majesty r s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Ghaleb2 . Ghalsb was permitted to draw arrears accmm'dated for a large number of years, and that neither his pre decessor nor he himself was warned that arrears would in future be forfeited. -• All the Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, includ ing His 'lighnecs the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, have now been told that their stipend must be drawn punctually or not at all, but I consider that there is a good deal of force in the Sultan f s contention that a retrospective insistence of this condition in contra diction of a comparatively recent precedent and with out previous intimation of its adoption is opposed to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his Treaty. The existence of the Aden Protectorate is based on mutual obligations established by treaties between His Majesty T s Government and the loc :1 Chiefs, and a scrupulous obser vation of the conditions of these treaties is essential to the maintenance of our relationship with them. I feel very strongly that there should never be any doubt that obligations under the treaties will be fully honoured, and I consider that in a case of some uncer tainty, such as the present one, it is better to accept rather than to repudiate a claim for which there appears to be a good though perhaps not a conclusive case. For this reason I venture to recommend a consideration of the orders conveyed to me in your despatch of the 4th January 1933, and the payment of the arrears of stipend due to the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla in full from 1st October 1917. 4. I base my request primarily on a point of principle. but3. bnt I desire to add a plea for generous treatment in tnis case on account of the consistently loyal and help!ul attitude of the Mukalla authorities in all matters in which their co-operation or assistance is desired by the Aden Residency. This has been notably evident in connection with landing grounds and other facilities for the Royal Air Force in Mukalla terri tory and its neighbourhood. Mukalla is the most important place and the pivot of our policy in the eastern part of the Protectorate, but its Sultan nevertheless receives one of the smallest of the stipends paid to Protectorate Chiefs, and he is never given money presents such as are often bestowed upon others in the Protectorate. The amount of his stipend - Rs. 60 a month - is, in fact, so low that it can be regarded as little more than a token of the mutual relationship between him and His Majesty T s Government; and, as such, I consider that it ought not to be allowed to lapse, even temporarily, in a case such as the one which I now submit for your reconsideration. I am, etc. (SD.) B. R. Reilly.32316. TREASURY CHAMBERS, 7th November, 193A- Sir, I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Cowell’s letter of the 3rd July (37953/34) and subsequent semi-official correspondence, relative to the payment of arrears of stipend claimed by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla. In reply, I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister that, having regard to the terms of the treaty under v/hich this stipend is paid, My Lords are now prepared to agree to the payment of arrears accrued since the accession of the present Sultan in 1922, amounting to approximately £675. They note hov/ever that Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is advised that, as the treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consideration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3 of the treaty, the obligation of His Majesty’s Government is not to be regarded as extending to arrears v/hich his predecessor had waived or failed to secure, and in these circumstances They are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to the present Sultan’s accession. My Lords note that savings are available on the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote from which this payment can be met, and that one-third of the amount will be recovered from the Government of India under the usual arrangements. I am, etc. , (Sgd.) R.V. Nind Hopkins. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office..DEN Downing Street, i V November, 1934. Sir I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 91 of the 4th of April, regarding the arrears of stipend claimed hy the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, and to inform you that this na tter has been further considered in consultation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury* 2. The legal position under the Treaty of 1882 has been examined, and I am advised that as the Treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consideration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3, the Sultan could reasonably claim arrears of stipend v/hich accrued during his own reign; but not arrears v/hich his predecessor had waived or been unable to secure* 3. in these circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury agree that the Sultan should be paid the arrears of stipend which have accrued since his accession in June 1922 amounting to approximately £675, but they are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to that date. I am accordingly to convey to you my sanction for the issue to the Sultan of the arrears of the stipend from the date of his assumption of Chieftainship in June 1922. 4 . THE RESIDENT AT ADEN0 \4 4* In order to prevent any accumulation of arrears of stipends in future, I consider that all stipends should he paid autom tically each year without awaiting applications from the stipendiary chiefs. By this ms thod the strict obligations of Government to the Chiefs will he discharged and the accumulation of arrears will he prevented. Unless you see any objection I have to request that you will arrange for this procedure to he adopted in future. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant.

Their Lordships have now replied that they do now ieel able to authorise the issue of six years arrears Ox suipend in this case and have expressed the view that payment of arrears for a period of three years would be a reasonable,!init of concession. X agree with this view although I recognise that some difficulty might be experienced in resisting payment of the whole of the arrears which have accrued, in the event of the Sultan invoking his Treaty obligations. I accordingly now convey to you my formal sanction to payment to the Sultan of arrears of stipend for a period of three years from the 1st of April, 1930, to the 3lst of March, 1953 inclusive, and, provided you see no objection, payment should, if possible, be made before the 3lst of March, 1933, in order to permit of the charge falling against the provision for stipends for the current financial year THE RESIDED!

Dear Friend, With reference to your honour’s letter dated 22th March 1933 I have the honour to state, Oh Friend, that I regret very much for the decision of His Majesty’s Govern ment regarding the arrears of my stipend claims. I had discussions at first with General Scott and General Steward that it is below my position to receive sixty Dollars monthly as a stipend amount, and according to my request to increase the s^me at least upto rupees one thousand monthly I was assured that they will try their best to increase the amount. The matter was referred to His Majesty’s Governnent and I was keenly waiting for the favourable decision of the same and hence I did not claim the arrears of stipend of the usual amount of all these years. Then finally I had discussions with Col. Lake for the arrears. Under the above ciircumstances I reouest your honour to refer the above matter again to His Majesty’s Government that the amount of the stipend should be increased to Rupees one thousand monthly, and if the above request is not granted my stipend arrears from October 1918 upto October 1933 should be granted because I did not claim the arrears only thinking that the matter was under discussion and so my claim for the amount of the arrears of all these years should not be debarred at all.I herewith return the draft No§ 71/104 dated 25th March 1933 for the amount of Rs«2100 with a reoueet to send me the draft of the full amount of all these years as mentioned above. I will keep up the terms of the treaty and the same friendly relations and cooperation with the Government if at all I am not paid. Thanking you for the trouble* Your sincere friend,\ f THE RESIjDEHCY, Aden, 28th June 1933« To His Highness Sxiltan Omar bin Awadh al ^iu’aiti, Sultan of Shihr &amp; itukalla, HYD^HABAJ) (Deocan).

Furthermore, on your first visit to Aden after that date, in Ootoher 1928, the then Resident made it sufficiently clear to Your Highness that he was not prepared to recommend to His Majesty’s Government your request for financial assistance; and Your Highness's subsequent representation to the Resident in October 1932 was not more favourably received# 6 # In these circumstances I regret that I am unable to recommend to His Majesty's Government Your Highness's explanation of the reason for the accumulation of the arrears of stipend, nor to move them to reconsider their decision to pay those arrears in respect only of the period from 1st April 1930. 7. In regard to Your Highness's wish for an increase in stipend, I regret that I cannot see my way to making any recommendation to Hig Majesty's Government at the present time; for whatever may be the opinion of this Residency as to the adequacy or otherwise of the stipend at present appertain ing to the Sultandte of Shihr and Mukalla, the faot that Your Highness, during the eleven years since your aocession, has spent altogether less than 3 years in your territories must mitigate against a favourable consideration of Your Highness's requests# In this connection I would again commend to Your Highness's most earnest attention the Resident's advioe oontained in his letter No.2497 of the 19th April 1933.

The allowance was sanctioned in recognition of the former's services to the late Aden Boundary Commission and made on the understanding that it was not a regular stipend but merely a personal allowance to be contingent on the good behaviour of Ali Mohsin Askar and the Mausatta clan. In 1906, the Government of India authorised the payment of the allowance at the special rate of Rs. 2/- per dollar granted to the Treaty stipendiaries of this Residency. The allowance was originally paid from the Darbar Presents' grant but subsequently it His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.I it was treated as a special charge and provided for in the budget under a separate head. 2. On the death of Sheikh Ali Mohsin, in 1910 9 the Government of India sanctioned the continuance of the allowance to his son, Mahomed Ali Mohsin, on the same conditions as before. 3. In consequence of a complaint of misbehaviour on the part of Mahomed ALi Mohsin, received from the Nakib of Mausatta, the payment of the allowance was suspended from 1st April 1927 but was restored to him with arrears in October 1928 after he had satisfactorily explained his conduct. 4. As no payments were made throughout th© financial year of 1927-28, the provision made in the Indian budget for that year lapsed. The amount provided in the current year's budget has therefore been paid to cover the arrears from 1st April 1927 to 31st March 1928, and a sum of Rs. 480/- is now required to meet the charge for the current year. 5. This item of personal Allowance does not appear to have been included in the statements of revenue and expenditure furnished to you under this Residency despatches No. 65 of 30th March and No. 214 of 9th November 1927 with the result that it has not been formally allocated either to 'Civil* or •Political'. The item is of course wholly political but it continues to be provided in the Indian budget.I submit that it should now be included in statement a accompanying your despatch to the Treasury No. 0-59274/28 dated the 27th June 1928 and that the sum of Rs. 480/- now required as well as the allowance for 1929-30 be paid from the Darbar Presents' grant. Necessary provision will be made in my estimate for political services in aden commencing from the year 1930—31. Meanwhile I am authorising the payment of the charge for the current year in anticipation of your sanction. 6 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of Bombay for their information.

On the other hand it seems to me that the terms of General Maitland’s letter clearly intend the allowance to be a separate additional payment.'

Attention is also invited to Colonel Wahab*s letter No.312, dated the 3 rd August 1903, in which it is mentioned that Sheikh Ali Mohsin Askar intimated that the allowance was only granted to him while engaged in the business of Government, which appears to the Government of India to render this grant a special one, and not merely a life grant.'* Resolution.

With regard to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the despatch, I forward herewith a statement showing the monthly stipends paid to Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate chargeable to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 3. The additional stipend of 1100 dollars (Rs.2200) per mensem shown in column 5 of the statement which is paid to the Abdali Sultan under the Agreement entered into with him in 1882 for the purchase of Sheikh Otiiman, is made up, as stated in the Agreement, as follows (1) Profit of water 600 dollars Rs.1200 (2) Profit of Salt 500 dollars Rs.1000 This amount wnich is paid to the Sultan in compensation for the cession of Sheikh Otnman is apparently chargeable to the Indian Government since the territory transferred will remain in the hands of that Government. 4.

Political Resident, Aden. His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. SUBJECT:- Sir, With reference to your despatch No.118, dated the loth November 1927, I have the honour to state that the Darbar Presents Grant is distinct from the Grant for Entertainments of Envoys and Chiefs, vide item 21 of the Statement accompanying my letter No.214, dated the 9th November 1927. 2. The Darbar Presents Grant is intended for gifts only. These gifts consists of (1) presents made to Chiefs and their followers when they visit Aden annually and in some cases even more than once according to the exigency of each case; (2) assistance to tribes in the event of aggression or invasion by the Zeidis or when famine conditions exist; (3) funeral expenses when Chiefs or their relatives die; (4) presents to new Chiefs on accession, etcetera. 3. The Entertainment Grant is spent wholly, in the en tertainment of Chiefs and their followers. With the excep tion of Salute Chiefs and some of the more important ones, all the Chiefs and their followers are housed in the old ResidencyResidency building known as the Guest House. Salute Chiefs and others are housed in suitable houses hired for the purpose as occasion demands, the rent of these being met from the Entertainment Grant. The Entertainment is carried out by contract. 4. A sum of Rs.75,000/- has been provided by the Government of India in their budget for 1927-28 for the Entertainment of Envoys and Chiefs but this orovision, included in the budget estimate for the year 1928-29, has been deleted by the Government of India as it is wholly debitably to His Majesty's Government, o. Provision for both tnis and the Darbar Presents Grant will therefore be necessary in the Vote for Middle Eastern Services 1928, as shown in the statement (items 21 and 34 'Miscellaneous Central') forw^ded with my letter No.214, dated the 9th November 1927 referred to above. 6.

WILSON. The Under Secretary of State,£ 8 October 48073/27 . 7 oir, I am directed to refer to the letter from thic Department ho.48052/27 of the 16th of August arid to transmit to *ou, to be laid before tne Lords Coamissioners of his ajest^s .treasury, tne accor^a^ing cop&gt; of a despatch from tne Acting Resident at Aden on tne subject of the payments made to heads of iribes and stipendiaries in the Aden Protectorate . Copies of the two statements and ot the telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India referred to therein are also enclosed* 2. ihe question of these payments end iso tnat of the oar bar Presents, which is mentioned in the latter part of Major owle's desp&amp;tcn, was discussed recently with Major General ntewart, the Resident at Aden . as regards tne pensions and li IhLAnU hY . stipends ,X-- etipends, it appears Uiat each of tiiese has its own peculiar origin but that the majority are paid to the Chiefs of iribes and sections of iribes in the Protectorate to keep open tne trade routes, and they are, in many cases, guaranteed by treaty. The secretary of btate has addressed further enquiries to the Acting Resident at Aden on this subject and a copy of his despatch is enclosed. 3. As regards the Darbar Presents, this expenditure is incurred in the entertainment of the Chieis of the iribes who usually visit jvden annually, when they are entertained with a limited number of their followers in the building iormerly used as a Residency. The entertainment is carried out by contract and eacn Chief on his visit receives a gift varying in amount according to his standing. The cost of tne entertainment and the amount ol the gifts are reduced whenever an opportunity presents itself and if a Chief should fail to visit the Resident during the course of the year no payment is made to him, but it appearsappears that the practice is one of long standing and is in accordance with the practice in India. i. It is evident that for the present at any rate these payments must be continued and the expenditure, t4ing of a purely political character, falls to be met out of British funds. 1 am therefore to request that Their Lordships may be moved to agree that the Resident may be authorised to incur expenditure for Jarbar Presents to the amount of Rs.70,036 out of the provision of that sua made for Aden expenditure under head L of the Vote for the ft iddie Eastern services, on the understanding that he will continue to reduce the cost of the entertainment and the amount of the gifts made to the Chiefs as opportunity offers. 1 am, Lir, four most obedient servant.

Addressed Aden repeated Government of bombay.—ADEN Ko.,m, DOMING STREET, 28th October, 1927, Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 189 of the 27th of September enclosing statements showing the territorial and political pensions of Yemen( Aden Protectorate) stipendiaries and the pensions paid to Heads of Tribes. According to those statements, the total annual amount to be paid is Rs.79,500 and I presume that this figure should be substituted for the figure of Rs.86,000 given in item 29 of the table of expenditure which accompanied Major General Stewart’s despatch No.65 of the both of March. 2. My attention has been called to the fact that under the agreement entered into with the Sultan of Lahej in 1882 for the purchase of Shaikh Othman, the amount of the monthly subsidy to that Sultan was increased as one of the considerations for the cession of the territory described in that agreement. If, as presumably is the case, the increase of the subsidy then granted to the sultan is included in the amount of the pension now paid to him, it would seem that so much of the pension is chargeable against the Indian Government, since the territory transferred will remain in the hands of that Government. 3. I shall be glad if you will consider this point and will inform me whether any part of the pension now paid to the Sultan of Lahej is in compensation for the cession of Shaikh Othman; and will consider also whether any other of the pensions and stipends have been based upon considerations with which the Government of India., as responsible for the Ly Aden settlement, ere alone concerned. I shall be glad, if, at the same time you will inform me of the circumstances in THE ACTING INDENT^ Cellaneous compensation is paid to certain heads ADEN. . of&lt; ( % V of tribes, as shown in items 9,10 and 11 of the statement (A) accoTrpanying your despatch* 4.
