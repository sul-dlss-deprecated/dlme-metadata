Urfc 0 B. 299. MESOPOTAMIA. Xoie on Demobilisation hy Civil Commissioner, Basiiitlad. (Enclosed in leltev to the India Olfice, A'o. 20517, dated '2^th September 1918.) ^ 1. Demobilisation in 'Mesopotamia includes not merely the repatriation of the bulk of the fighting forces, but the transference to the Civil Government of the energies of the present military administration, so far as they can be utilised for national ends in time of peace, with the least possible waste of time, money and material. At present there are, under one direction, two installations, so to speak, at work in the country: one military, absorbing nearly all the available power, and cliiected to military ends, civil needs being served only so far as they are necessary to : 1 ltt 1 ain | m P nt Wai a ^ ms .' the other a rudimentary but extensive organisation winch had the double duty laid on it of subserving the ends of the military machine, 0 i Vi is inte ^ ral P ai ^' ai1 ^ paving the way for a Civil Government which shall he able, with the minimum of loss of energy, to take up the reins when peace comes, and administer the country in the manner best, calculated to accord with our Imperial policy. 'he only official literature on the subject that I have seen does not deal, except incidentally, with demobilisation in Mesopotamia, and in any case the many problems which will arise in connection therewith depend for their solution upon factors which must remain unknown until the end of the war. • &gt;. I (&gt;i the pmpose ol this note it is assumed that whatever form of government is aciopted, it will involve effective British control of the country and that it will be uniform throughout ^Mesopotamia. It is further assumed' that His Majesty's (lovernment will, for reasons of strategy and policy, need to retain for a considerable time an organised and highly mobile force in or near Baghdad whose role will be to minimise,^ by the fact of its existence, the risk of anarchical disturbances in the ill (Idle Kast, and, in the event of such breaking out {e.g., in Persia, Caucasus or Mosul /, to lestore equilibrium, and will also suffice to maintain internal order. Strategical and Political Considerations. L It is safe to assume that, for a decade after the war, affairs in the Middle East ^ j . in a highly unstable condition and liable to disturbances which, if not kept within bounds, will have a reflex effect upon European peace, and upon law and order in Mesopotamia. No reforms can be carried out in Persia, Armenia or Turkey by Emopean agency unless support can, il need be, be rendered by a military force ; and it is in the Middle East that it will be found most difficult to give practical effect to the terms of peace eventually agreed on in Europe. _ . ;) * J7 0m ^ghdad, which will be the ganglion of the railway system of the Middle East, a strong force can, with the aid of modern mechanical transport, be sent within a few weeks across Persia, to Trans-Caucasia, to the Caucasus, to Mosul and Aleppo, and within striking distance of Armenia and Kurdistan. With the nucleus ot a strong force in Baghdad, no power could strike at India without first masking or dealing with Baghdad. The presence of a mobile force in Baghdad would enable icat hutain, on behalf of the civilised nations of the world, to give effective support i • v , r ,, ^ , t0 ^ ie new States which may be constituted at i.e., .Last ot the Mediterranean and &lt;-1^ „ • . , • , , -ir- i n the Black Sea, and west of the Indian I' i v?- i i 111 7 an the Middle Frontier. l^ast. \\ ithout such practical support it seems unlikely that these young States, the first experiments in self-determination, will be able to withstand the forces of anarchv, already so powerful. 10 S 11 50 12/18 ^6. IE Baghdad is strongly held, and ample reserves of war material and the means of transportation be kept on the spot, military requirements for the frontier of India will be correspondingly reduced ; the Middle East would be dominated, in a military sense, from Baghdad, and our political influence would be proportionate to our potential military strength. Great Britain alone, as trustee for the civilised nations of the world, can ensure the peace of the Middle East, and Great Britain is the only Power which would be willingly accepted in this capacity by the nations of the Middle East, who, our Treaty of 1907 with Russia notwithstanding, still see in British policy an altruism and tolerance which they fail to discern elsewhere. 7. For political reasons, both local and Imperial, it seems undesirable that the British military forces of Baghdad should consist wholly or mainly of Indian troops ; it should, if possible, consist entirely of British troops. Within 12 months of the declaration of peace it should be possible to replace British and Indian .military units by Arab levies almost everywhere except at Baghdad, where the climate is far more favourable than most places in India for the health of British troops, provided good quarters are built and arrangements for their comfort made. 8. For the maintenance of law and order in Mesopotamia, reliance should be placed on Arab levies, supported as necessary by aeroplanes and armoured cars; to facilitate the use of these, landing grounds should be maintained near all centres of population, and existing military roads should be maintained. The experience gained during this campaign indicates that this combination is likely to be adequate to deal with any internal troubles likely to arise. Maintenance in Baghdad of Trocps and War Material. 9. If these premises represent to any degree the probable line of policy eventually adopted by His Majesty's Government, it would seem to follow :— (1) That the formations detailed for the Mesopotamian garrison will be British formations. (2) That arrangements will be made to retain the bulk of horses and mules now in the country that are fit for use, the balance being disposed of locally; any surplus to military needs can be profitably used for commercial transport, of which there will long be an acute scarcity. (3) That skilled men in British units will be permitted to take up technical employment in the civil administration or with private firms, and that facilities will be given to them to settle in the country, where there are many openings for skilled European labour and for Europeans generally. (4) That no considerable quantity of serviceable war material will be shipped from this country to India or elsewhere. This would make rapid remobilisation impossible. Apart from this, the knowledge that large stocks of war material are held at Baghdad will have a powerful effect in maintaining equilibrium in neighbouring States. Our efforts should be directed to storing all war material, including ammunition, under the best possible conditions, in such a way as to make it possible, with a small turnover, to maintain it efficiently. It is understood that large reserves of war material are at present held in this country; it is submitted that these should be retained, and that all the resources of engineering skill and modern science be called in at the end of the war to ensure their preservation in suitable magazines. (5) That all available mechanical transport in the country be retained and that arrangements be made for its maintenance in an efficient condition. This is a vital consideration. Provided our mechanical transport is maintained at full strength and efficiency, the Baghdad garrison can dominate the Middle East, and even further afield, at will. It is to be hoped that British personnel for mechanical units can be partially replaced by Arab; Indian personnel could be utilised until Arab personnel is available. All available surplus motor transport could be profitably employed by Government in carrying goods on behalf of private firms for some time after the war, as there is all over the Middle East an acute shortage of animal transport and of imported necessaries, though considerable stocks of these are held at Baghdad and Basrah.AdmimstraUve Considerations. ]0. ll the assumptions in the foregoing paragraph represent to anv de^iee- the ^ probable line of policy to be pursued by Government, it follows that the efficiency of the means of transportation and communication in Mesopotamia will be, no less than the size and composition of the garrison, a matter of Imperial concern; and it will be necessary, when discussing post-war administration, to provide for the retention of effective Government control over the means of transportation developed by military agency in this country during the present war, and for their further development with due regard to strategical requirements. . . Thus when the Civil Administration is called on to take over the existing Directorate of Railways it should do so not as a domestic matter but on behalf ol th( Imperial Government; it should be required to keep such reserves of material as may be decided on, and to build such additional lines and sidings as are needed lor military purposes. . „ In consideration of these obligations being fulfilled the railway lines, rolling stock and other assets might be handed over to the Civil Administration at a lowei rate than would otherwise be the case. I am assuming that in the case of railways, works, power plant and other assets of the kind erected in the country and required for post-war purposes, they will be assessed and handed over at a valuation to the Civil Administration, which will hand to the Treasury an equivalent of Mesopotamian Bonds in lieu, the interest and sinking fund on which will be payable annually. ^ It is abundantly clear that ii this country is to be given a good stait, all these assets should be handed over to it. „ . i i i It would pay the Imperial Government, as a matter ol business, to hand them over for one quarter of their book value, for the cost of dismantling the partly used plant, shipping it, storing it and reassembling it, will be very great, and will involve further deterioration; and meanwhile the plant will not be earning money and all the monev spent in preparing sites, foundations, embankments, accommodation, &amp;(*., will be lost. Left in situ in working order, there is little doubt that it will earn enough to pay working expenses, interest and sinking fund on a reduced estimate ol capital value. 11. If the above assumptions are correct, no railway material will be returned to India, and the demobilisation of railway staff would consist of the transfer to the -Civil Administration cf the Directorate, and the continuance in civil employ of all men willing to remain. The Railway Directorate would have to continue to recruit staff from India and probably from Europe for some time to come. Directorate of Telegraphs. 12. The considerations advanced in paragraphs 10 and 11 mutatis mutandis to telegraphs. This Directorate is already quasi-civil; it is at present staffed and administered from India ; it is a matter for consideration of Government whether it should not be amalgamated with the Indo-European Telegraph Department^ and o-iven by international arrangement powers to run a line ol telegraphs from Baghdad to the Mediterranean, thus connecting India with the United Kingdom more effectively than was possible through Russia and across Europe. The powerful wireless installations at Basrah and Baghdad would be taken over by this Directorate; the numerous smaller installations being stored in Baghdad, as a strategic reserve, on the principles advocated in paragraphs 5 and G supra. A Telegraph Department with effective control over main lines of communication up the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia would be a great Imperial asset; commercially it would probably, like the Indo -European lelegraph Depaitment, pay. Inland Water Transport. 13. Until there is through communication between Amarah and Baghdad by rail a considerable volume of military river-borne traffic will be required, but railway communication once effected it seems unlikely that the Iigiis will be used to aii\ great extent bv Government lor the transport ol troops oi mateual, except peihaps fuel oil and bulk kerosene, coal, and, in times of high river, railway and building materials.4 It is for consideration whether the river steamers best suited for the Tigris should not be retained, with an adequate number of barges, at the disposal of the Civil Department of Railways (which might be merged into a Department of LVansportation), in sufficient numbers to meet military emergencies, and to cope with the Government tonnage. This would prevent a monopoly of river transport by any one firm, would give the Department of Transportation a free hand to utilise whatever method of transportation (river or rail) is most economical. Some steamers and many barges could probably be sold in Mesopotamia to British and to Arab companies ; some will in the ordinary course of things be returned to India, others might be sold for export to Burma. Inland ater Transport docks, buildings at Basrah and elsewhere, constitute a most valuable property, and the best way to ensure its utilisation to the advantage of the State would appear to be to vest the whole in the Civil Department of 1 ransportation (including docks). This done, superfluous assets could be disposed of to other Government Departments, or by sale locally, under suitable supervision by some specially-constituted authority on behalf of the Treasury. Medical Services. II. I he disposable material of the Medical Services in this country consists, roughly speaking, of— (1) Buildings. (2) Ships. (3) Sanitary installations. (4) Stores. As regards buildings, these are of three kinds (1) Permanent buildings requisitioned for war purposes, e.g., the Serai and Military Isolation Hospital at Baghdad, .No. 3 B.G.1I., at Basrah. It is urgent that these should be evacuated at the earliest practicable date. (2) Temporary hospital buildings of a more or less substantial nature ; these will mostly be required by the military authorities for some considerable time after the declaration of peace, if (1) are evacuated and if troops are concentrated at large centres. x\ny surplus could probably be advantageously taken over by the Civil Administration, (3) Sanitary installations, water filtration plant. Much of this will be wanted by the Civil Administration, so far as it can be spared; the balance could probably be advantageously stored (paragraph U supra). It is of greatest importance that continuity of medical and sanitary work in this country be so far as possible ensured ; this might be done by establishing a Central Medical Depaitment at the eailiest possible date, to which all medical records of permanent interest would be transferred, and which would take over and continue the research work now being conducted under military auspices. A discussion as to the organisation of a Civil Medical Department is. however, not germane to the subject of this Memorandum except in so far as it will afford openings for a number of medical officers and British qther ranks of the K.A.M.C. who may be willing to stay in the country. The principle on which it will be formed will probably be that the personnel should so lar as possible be British and Arab ; medical schools being instituted with the object ot making Mesopotamia independent in the matter of compounders, dressers, pharmacists, sub-assistant-surgeons, and assistant-surgeons. Works Department. 15. The activities of the Works Department in Mesopotamia have had a profound effect on the civil population, and the activities of no department have been of more direct benefit to them. Politically the installation of electric light and fans, of modern water installations, of ice machines, to mention only a few branches of the Department, have fired the imaginations of all classes, who have benefited indirectly therefrom (as in the case of street lighting and water) or who confidently hope to benefit immediately after the war. There are strong political reasons against any hasty restriction of the scope of the \\ orks Department, much of which could be taken over en bloc by the Civil Administration, with its plant, under the same financial arrangements as-railways{vide paragraph 10 supra). It would be umviso and would arouse much resentment to accept specious offers from British or other firms to take over such public installations as mow exist, and work them at a profit for the use of the public. Before long the larger municipalities will be in a position to acquire and work the lighting and water supply installations for themselves, as all such would undoubtedly be commercially profitable and self-supporting. Municipalities will also be glad to take over ice machines and even other assets like flour mills, and there is already a strong current of public opinion in favour of this system, which moreover accords well with our political intentions in this country. Public works on a Large scale will be needed, both permanent and temporary and for this purpose also the existing Works Department will form an invaluable nucleus. liemounts. 16. Vide paragraph 9 (2) supra. Veterinary Services. 1.. \ ide paragraph su])ra ; the same conditions apply mutatis mutandis. Irrigation and Agriculture. IS i hese Departments, at present military, will presumably be transferred en hiocto the Civil Administration ; they can then be recast to suit civil administrative needs. Surveys. 1J, An immense amount ol valuable work has been and is being done; continuity is essential. Paragraph 14: supra applies mutatis 'mutandis. Stationery Department. 20. ( ould usefully be expanded to form a single unit to meet military and civil needs. Graves Registration. c ^^ I 1 , 6 Ci * re and maintenance of military cemeteries is a recognised responsibility the Civil Admmistiation. i his unit might suitably be transferred even before the end ol the wai to Ci\il, and thus facilitate arrangements for making district ollicers responsible for such cemeteries in their districts as it is decided to maintain. Royal Air Force. 22. I 1 or reasons already adduced it would seem most iinporcaut to maintain at Baghdad a strong wing of the Royal Air Force, with all existing workshops, hangars stores, cVc. ; the existence of such a force can scarcely fail to exert a powerfui innuence in support of British policy and of peace in the whole of Middle East and the cost of maintaining such a force is small compared to that of other arms. It seems probable that many supplementary aerial activities could before Ion-'- be developed Irom Baghdad as a base which would be of the greatest use to the Civil Administration, e .g.— (1) Photographic surveys, which have already been carried to a high state of efficiency. (_) 11 nodical agrjcultuial and marsh surveys, to show areas under cultivation (3) Jerry services for high officials on tour. (4) Rapid postal services between Baghdad and large towns such as Basrah, Mosul, Aleppo, llamadan and leluan; this would very possibly be commercially profitable and will not improbably be a recognised branch of Governmental activity in Europe after the war. . . h l primary duty would, however, be strategic; a strong air force at Baghdad is the first essential if we are to get full value from our position here. If this be accepted there will be no considerable transfer of stores and no rapid demobilisation ot personnel of the Air Force.Royal Navy. 23. It is to he doubted whether after the war there will bo any need to maintain a detachment of the Royal Navy on the river in Mesopotamia ; such police duties can be performed by river boats, and could be managed with military detachments, under the orders of the military authorities, in vessels managed by the Civil Department of Transportation. On this assumption the demobilisation of the Royal Navy might be complete, boats and stores being handed over to the Civil Department of Transportation. Repatriation of Prisoners of War now interned in India. 24. Of the 25,000 or more Turkish prisoners of war in British hands, understood to be in India, probably not over 5,000 are residents of Iraq; probably another 5,000 are residents of the Mosul Vilayat, and are of Arab or mixed Arab race, or are Kurds of Kirkuk, &amp;c., and would wish to be repatriated via Baghdad ; the remainder can probably be best repatriated via the Mediterranean. It is possible, and even probable, that of the 10,000 who may be repatriated rid Baghdad, a considerable proportion would be willing to work in Labour Corps, replacing Indian Labour Corps. A great deal of labour will be required both for military and civil purposes after demobilisation, and this source, if it can be tapped, should greatly facilitate the demobilisation of Labour Corps; if it is possible to bring out more prisoners of war labour from India during hostilities, this process would be considerably facilitated. Amongst the prisoners of war now in India are some, both in class ' B 11 and ' C,'' who cannot suitably be released without security being taken for their good behaviour ; this would be arranged with the Civil Administration at the time of repatriation. A certain proportion of the prisoners of war are blind, and maimed, or so diseased as to be incapable of earning a living; some few are from Mesopotamia, but the bulk are from Turkey in Asia. Those who belong to this country should be handed over to the Civil Administration, which will have to arrange for their disposal. Indian Immigration. 25. It will be necessary on the termination of the war to have a definite policy with regard to Indian immigration. There will be a demand, which might, if encouraged, attain considerable proportions, on the part of certain classes in the Indian Army, for grants of land to enable them to remain here after the war as cultivators. There has already been a notable influx of Indian, Hindu, Mohammedan and Parsi shopkeepers and small traders into Basrah, and only existing military restrictions prevent their coming to Baghdad. The question is a many-sided one and is only referred to here as a reminder of a question which will have to be faced in connection with demobilisation. Arab opinion is undoubtedly opposed to Indian immigration of any sort.X. Memorandum by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to the Chief of General Staff, General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, No. 18791, dated the 8th September 1918. I attach for the consideration of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief a note on domobilisation in Mesopotamia which, subject to his concurrence, J propose to send to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government ot India. I he note embodies my personal views on the subjects dealt with, so far as T have been ahle to formulate them without fuller knowledge of the facts, and without knowledge of the views and intentions of His Majesty's Government. It was written before the return of Sir P. Cox, and has not been altered since. ■j. 1 he note is intended to bring to the notice ot higher authoritv some aspects of the urgent local problems that will before long call for solution, and if General Officer Commanding-in-Ohief concurs, I would propose, when transmitting the note, to ask His Majesty's Government to consider the despatch to this country of a small but authoritative Commission of, say, three persons, who may be joined by two members from the Staff of this Force, to consider the questions raised in this memo randum and other allied topics relating less to the political status of this country than to the practical administrative problems connected with post-war adjustments. 4. This Committee should have power to co-opt heads of departments, and to call for information on all subjects. It might usefully come out in December, and sit for three months. I attach papers from which it will be seen that the proposal for such a Com mission was made in 1917 and accepted by His Majesty's Government, but postponed for military reasons. A. T. Wilson, Lieut.-Col. LA,, Officiating Civil Commissioner. II.- Memorandum No. A. 2120 31, dated 26th September 1918, from Deputy Adjutant- General, General Headquarters, to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. ^ our No. 18&lt; 1)1 of 8th September and enclosed paper is returned herewith. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief wishes his observations to be forwarded with the letter, and I am to state that he has no objection to a telegram being sent regarding the advisability of a Commission to enquire into the question of recon struction of Irak. Ft is desirable their work should commence this winter. III.—Observations by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief. With reference to the Civil Commissioner's paper on demobilisation, I am entirely in accord that, given the retention of Irak by the British Government on the cessation of hostilities, all assistance should be given to the new administration that is possible in the handing over of institutions and establishments at present under the control of the Army which would be of utility in the reconstruction of the country. The question of payment could no doubt be settled equitably. Till, however, the terms of peace are settled, general principles may be suggested, but laying down of details must prove of doubtful value. I agree that Baghdad should be the headquarters of the post-war garrison, but I consider the hopes expressed in paragraphs 3 and 5 regarding its mobility as optimistic. Such mobility could only be ensured by a very great improvement of existing communications and development of means of transportation. The necessity for sending troops to the various districts mentioned will depend, moreover, on the political results obtained from peace. The expression ' strong force ' in paragraph 5 is somewhat indeterminate, and it seems to me very doubtful if in peace time it would be possible to maintain sufficient mechanical transport to send a force as large as a division across Persiainto Trans-Oaucapia or the Caucasus. Tu this connection, and with reference also to paragraph 9 (5), T do not think it would be possible to retain all the mechanical transport that we shall shortly have in the country in peace time; such an amount could not normally be usefully employed, and it is very doubtful if any Government would agree to keep up 32 companies of Ford vans and the large number of Peerless lorries in peace time. I am doubtful also whether all available surplus motor transport could be profitably employed by the Government in carrying goods on behalf of private firms for some time after the war. Ford vans are not economical enough for commercial use. I do not think it feasible or desirable to keep up a garrison of entirely British troops in Mesopotamia. Such a garrison would entail the provision of hill stations, and would h? handicapped by considerations of health. The provision of an entirely British garrison of the size suggested (two divisions) might also be difficult, taking into consideration our probable responsibilities in other parts of the world. With reference to paragraph 9 (4), it is clear that all raw material should be stored under the best possible conditions, and this is done now as far as possible. It is open to question whether we should retain as large a reserve of ammunition in peace time as we have now, since modern ammunition deteriorates quickly and it would be difficult to obtain a turnover. With reference to paragraph 13, the development of irrigation and the utilisation of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates for that end will have to be considered. River navigation by steamers of any size will undoubtedly be affected, and the establishing of through railway communication will also be an important factor. T am particularly impressed with the importance of the last paragraph. If the Indian agriculturist is to be encouraged, he must be protected until he is settled. This is a point that must be treated with especial care ; Indian labour questions in Africa and other countries emphasise the necessity. If the Indian is introduced he should at lirst be confined to such areas as are newly brought under irrigation, and where the Arab or other population is either very scanty or does not exist. It would appear advisable in the first place to encourage more Arabs to settle on the land. With the remainder of the remarks of the Civil Commissioner, which I have read with the greatest of interest, I am in general agreement.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002de_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B299</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002de</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B299</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'B 299.
