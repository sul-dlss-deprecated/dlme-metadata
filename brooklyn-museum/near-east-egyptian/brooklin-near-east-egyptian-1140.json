In sunk relief, a genre scene; at left women with tambourines and shouting boy before a tree, apparently engaged in driving off a flight of birds. One very large bird with a long tail and outstretched wings rising from tree. Bird obviously tropical but cannot be identified. No fruit or foliage indicated on tree, but possibly these details to be painted. The tree suggests relief is unfinished. Apparently a unique subject.\r\nCondition: Edges chipped as is left end. Ancient red pigment on face of front woman, in part on her tambourine and on the dress. Also on skirt of boy, the paint is mostly ancient and on hands at left top. Ancient paint on entire body of bird. Remains of original blue paint on branches of tree, especially at lower right. Slight remains of still another tree at upper right edge-probably a grove of them was represented on next block to the right.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "8 1/4 x 21 1/4 in.
