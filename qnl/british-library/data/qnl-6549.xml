B. Bewsher, Surveyor in Mesopotamia. The sheet of the survey of Mesopotamia, which has just been completed, extends from Sheriat-el-Beytha, on the Tigris, 10 miles N.W. of Baghdad, to the Sheriat-el-Beyth large mound of Tel Ibrahim, nearly in the centre of the Jezireh (or Mesopotamia), Tel Ibrahim, and 19 miles N.N.E. of Hillah. This is the northern point in the sheet completed by Lieutenant Collingwood. The work was taken up by Commander Selby and myself in the autumn of 1862. Several things occurred to prevent the completion of the sheet till the autumn of 1865. In the first place, the Montafik rebellion rendered the country unsafe for a time. As soon as this affair was settled, my services were required VkTT Arronf in nnnnfiYinn \vifh tVip t.plftoraTih then beinff erected between mander heloy naa retired, ana i naa succeeaeu mm as In attempting to give a brief description of the country contained in this sheet, I purpose following down, as far as possible, the course ot the old navigable canals which can still be traced. I shall confine myself almost entirely to a description of the ancient streams, canals, and ruins, for the present appearance of the country offers a sad contrast to the Mesopotamia of Greek and Roman authors, or even to the Jezireh of the time of the Abbasside Khalifs of Baghdad. Little need be said of the few modem canals and scant cultivation of the present day. ' ^ c u In the north-east corner of this sheet, and less than a mile and a half from the Ls boo . Tigris, is the bed of an old stream, now called Es Sook, or the bazaar. It runs down towards Baghdad, the environs of which city it formerly supplied with water.

The whole is enclosed within four high walls, which partially hide the sacred precincts from the eye of the unbeliever. Prom a distance the domes present a very beautiful appearance, and scivc as land-marks foi many miles Kathemain contains about 15,000 settled inhabitants, whose numbers are swelled by influx of pilgrims. These are all of the sect of Shiahs. Four miles to the south-east of this shrine stands the tomb of Zobeyda, the favourite wife of Haroun er Rasheed, a name familiar to all readers of the Arabian Nights. This has been piously kept in tolerable repair up to the present time, and was accessible not many years ago, but the entrance is now bricked up. A survey of Baghdad and its environs on a largfe scale was made by Commander Jones and Mr. Coilingwood, of the Indian Navy, and forwarded to Government, with a memoir on the province. These were published in the Bombay Govern ment Records, No. XLIII. It will be sufficient to note here that Baghdad was built in the year 145 of the Hegira (A.D. 762), by Munsoor, the second Khalif. The accounts given by the Arab historians are both interesting and amusing. Many of these stories concerning the building of the town and the events that occurred during the reigns of the Abbasside Khalifs, have found their way into Crichton's Arabia and other works. In A.H. 656, Mustassem Billah, the last Khaljf, was put to death by Hulaka Khan when he captured the city. Most of the public buildings were then destroyed, and it is probably due in a great measure to this prince that Baghdad of the present day shows but few traces of its former magnificence. After being taken and retaken by the Turks and Persians, Baghdad was finally conquered by Sultan MUrad IVth., in A,D. 1638. ' Since that period,' to quote Crichton, ' the once illustrious city of the Abbassides has been degraded to ' the seat of a Turkish Pashalic.' Among the few remaining ruins that mark the Abbasside dynasty in Baghdad may be seen the Medresseh or College built by Mustanser, in the year 630 of the Hegira (A.D. 1232). The inscription on it is being now restored. One of the oldest buildings in the town is the minaret of a mosque called Jama es Suk el Ghuzl, after the thread market near which it is. Commander Jones determined the position of this minaret, which he gives in his map of Baghdad, as in latitud3 33-20 north, longitude 44.25 east. Close to the westward of Baghdad are several deep openings of the Saklawiyeh canal, or, more properly speaking, of the marsh formed by the Saklawiyeh. Through one of these, Masaoodi, Captain Lynch brought the ' Euphrates steamer in 1838. The Saklawiyeh is now closed, both on the Euphrates and Tigris. 1 The large and conspicuous ruin now called Akr Kuf is I(U miles, a little north of west, from the bridge of boats at Baghdad. This ruin is composed of sun-dried bricks, 14 inches square and nearly 4 inches thick. Between the layers of bricks is one of reeds or mats, and between every seventh and eighth an extra thickness of these reeds can be noticed. This mass of sun^ dried bricks is solid to all appearances, is nearly square in shape, and stands on a rum of apparently kiln-hurnt bricks and lime. on a Mr' Loftus! r0Un ^ ed by eXtensive ruins ' wllich have be e n partially opened by 4this been mile •em, is ithe the ches they omb bin son, 3 of rith ally the any lied the oun teen not ider ent, jrn- was ing. :hat nto ika ed, the Hy jte to the by tis f a is. his the ore md irth •ied nth un- na by «f; is, « i w„ 'SIX*.

The Saklawiyeh canal which leaves the Euphrates about 6 miles above the Abu Ghurraib, is supposed by Chesney (' Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris,vol. j., pp. 32 and 55) and others quoting him, to correspond with the Nahr Aeesa. My reasons for thinking that the Abu Ghurraib and the Nahr Aeesa correspond are as followsThere is a ruin of a tomb now in existence on the Abu Ghurraib canal which is described m the ' Majm el Buldan' of Yakuti as being on the Nahr Aeesa. Besides this evidence there is that of the Zoaba Arabs, the present cultivators of the Abu Ghurraib district, who frequently told me that their canal was cut in the bed of an older stream called the Aeesawi. Chesney considers the Abu Ghurraib to coincide with the Nahr Serser of Abul Feda (Map No. 7 of the Series, and vol. i., p. 55 of Nahr Serser his work), yet, in the next page, he says the Abu Ghurraib corresponds with the el Melik, a canal to the southward, which I will presently describe; also at p. 281, vol. i., where, he says, the ruins of Kush are on the Nahr Malka; these ruins he has previously identified with Sindiyeh, and placed them on the Abu Ghurraib or Nahr Serser. There is great confusion in the letter-press with these canals, but in the map they are very distinct, and the Abu Ghurraib is marked as the supposed Nahr Serser of Abul Feda. Either of the two canals now called Abu Sumak and Sewadiyeh might correspond with Abul Feda's Serser. These may have been cut in the bed of older streams, but they had not sufficiently the characteristics of navigable canals to warrant my marking them as such. The old name of Serser as applied to a canal seems quite unknown to the present Arabs. Abul Feda says the Serser left the Euphrates below the Aeesa till it comes to Serser, which is described by Edrisi as a flourishing commercial town, nine miles from Baghdad, on a navigable canal on which there is a bridge of boats. After watering all these countries, he says, it joins the Tigris between Baghdad and Modain.—('Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris,' vol. i., p. 56.) Yakuti, in the' Majm el Buldan,' says, ' Serser—two villages within the limits of Baghdad, the ' great Serser and the little on the Nahr Aeesa, and sometimes called the Nahr ' Serser, and the distance between the little Serser and Baghdad is two fersakhs, ' and it is on the road to the Haj from Baghdad, and was called in former days ' Serser Ed Deir.' Where two such good authorities as Abul Feda and Yakuti disagree, it is difficult to form an opinion, but it seems probable that the Nahr Serser was a branch of the Nahr Aeesa. At a place called Munfuth (meaning a place where water flows), the old stream which 1 have thought was the Nahr Aeesa, bifurcates, one branch going on to the /1 c n A +^ fol^innr q tyi nro smithprlv fHrpp.Hnn wmcn 1 nave mougni was uie -naux — Tigris, a little south of Baghdad, and the other taking a more southerly direction.

Four canals men tioned by Xeno- phon. of the ffround in the neighbourhood would show that this, as most other buildings now standing, was erected on others then in ruins This spot was visited, according to D'Anville, by both Balbi and Texeira. A mile and a half to the eastward of Senadiyeh a branch canal leaves the Aeesa, going to the northward; it is called the Akatum, and has every appearance of having been a permanent or navigable stream, as the ruins on its banks are very considerable. I have only traced this stream seven miles from the fork, as my work ends there I may be wrong in saying this stream came from the Aeesa, for I had ro level, and have not ascertained the dip of the country. This is generally from north to south, and I may find that this canal took that course. 1 ^ „ There are several very peculiar old beds of streams or canals to the westward ot Senadiyeh, such as I have only met with in this part of the country. They are 35 to 40 paces broad, and run for miles in a perfectly straight line. 1 hey have no ruins on their banks, and in a distance of 30 miles have only two branch canals emanating from them. Had it not been for these two canals, I should have taken them for old embankments, although they are now only a foot or two above the level of the ground. The Arabs use them in the winter, when the ground is swampy, as roads, and call them all ' Towaeel,' which is the diminutive of the word meaning length. They have no idea what they were for, or when they, were used, and they are equally a puzzle to me. I have marked them with two open lines as navigable canals. , n ■, T r ^ Four miles to the westward of Senadiyeh is a mound called Kuneeseh, or Kunaseh. This name at once attracted our attention, from the fact of the battle of Kunaxa having been fought in the neighbourhood, and from the strange simi larity of the two names, Kunaseh being the nearest approach that an Arab could make to Kunaxa. In a country where names of mounds are frequently changed, except, indeed, the larger ones, it seems improbable, and almost too good to be true, that this one particular spot, the site of which has been so long sought for, should have kept its name intact for nearly 2,300 years. Chesney and Ainsworth, who have been over the very ground, have not noticed the name of Kuneeseh, which is the more remarkable, as this mound seems to correspond with that called Abu (ihurraib in the map of the expedition under Chesney. Kuneeseh is the Arabic for 'church,' and I believe the Hebrew word is very similar. I venture to think that the name Kunaxa, given to the battle on the authority of Plutarch, may be a corruption of the Hebrew word, and that the battle was actually fought at this spot. Ihere could not be a bettei authority on this point than Mr. Grote, who says, ' Following, therefore, the distance given ' by Plutarch (probably copied from Ktesias), we should place Kunaxa a little ' lower down the river than Felujah ; this seems the most probable supposition ('Grote's History of Greece,' vol. ix., note 2 to p. 56). Ihe mound of Kuneeseh is 17 miles from Felujah, and 51^ in a direct line from Babel, the northern mound of those marking the supposed site of Babylon. 'Ihis agiots, as nearly as may be, with the 500 stadia of Plutarch, which he gives as the distance between the two places. . t ^ • i Whether this supposition be correct or not, there is nothing, 1 think, m Xenophon's account of the advance or retreat of the Greeks that would dispiov» j it. In following the tracks ot the Greeks, 1 will take Pyloe as a staiting point. This is marked in Chesney's map as 22 miles from Hit. Commander Jones, ol the Indian Navy, a former surveyor in Mesopotamia, thinks it should be identified with a place called Bekaa (9^ miles to the south-eastward of Hit), from the fact of the Arabic word Bekaa having about the same meaning as the Greek Pyloe, and from the fact that there is actually a narrow pass at that place (' Bombay Selections,' No. XLIII., p. 263, note). From Pylce the Greeks in three days marched'twelve parasangs, then, in one day, three parasangs. It was in the middle of this march that they came to the trench supposed to have been cut by Artaxerxes, and passed it by a narrow passage of 20 feet. This description will exactly apply to an irrigating canal in the process of construction. A passage of about 20 feet broad is always left to keep out the water of the river while it is being dug, or till the time for watering the land arrives. Further on, Xenophon says it was not the time for watering the crops (p. 88, Spelman s Xenophon'). ' As to the trench extending 12 parasangs to the Median wall, this could only have been stated on hearsay evidence. Xenophon then mentions the four canals which are in the plain. Chesney seems to lay great stress on this passage, for, in vol. ii., p. 216, he says, The Isa, the Nahr Serser, and othercut mte thl .1 ny r C T SS !

Xenophon Ca^ak mentioned says the water was derived from the ligns and fell into the Euphrates, and he by Xenophon. repeats this statement about the two canals passed after the battle. This seems to be a mistake, as all the canals in this part of the country would, from its dip, be necessarily cut from the Euphrates to the Tigris. To continue in the foot steps ot the Greeks. 1 hey had already marched from Pyloe 15 parasangs, and it seven parasangs is allowed for the next two marches, it will give 22 parasan^s A? m *i • Bekaa is distant from the mound of Kuneeseh Distance of Bekaa oJ miles, in as straight a line as it is possible to go. This divided by 22 would from Kuneeseh. give nearly 2| miles to the parasang, which is about correct. It is worth noticing that the pebbly ridge close to Kuneeseh would exactly answer to Pebbly Ridge. the description of the hill mentioned by Xenophon, on which Artaxerxes' cavalry made a stand after retreating from the Greeks. Mr. Ainsworth, in his ' Track in Hill of eminence ' th ? / 00 t s t e P s 0 f tli e 10,000,' says he supposes this eminence to have been a tel or mentioned by artificial mound, as there are no natural mounds in the country, but he is Xenophon. mistaken in this latter assumption, for the ridge 1 allude to is 13 miles long and 80 feet high, if not more. The direction of the retreat of the Greeks from their encampment, a day's Retreat of the march to the north of the battle ground, has given rise to much discussion. Greeks. Xenophon says, 'as soon, therefore, as it was day, they began their march, with ' the sun on their right' (' Spelman's Xenophon,' p. 84). This, at first sight, would appear to be a northwardly or north-north-eastwardly direction, and the difficulty is to reconcile this with the very next words, ' expecting to arrive by ' sunset at some villages that lay in the country of Babylon,' and with the fact that they did eventually arrive at Sittaki, a city on the road between Babylon and Sittaki. Susa, or to the eastward of the former city. Mr. Grote thinks that by the sun on their right hand was meant the mid-day sun (' History of Greece,' vol. ix., p. 76, note). Is it not possible that the Greeks may have made a detour, wishing to Retreat of the avoid the troops of Artaxerxes, and, perhaps, keeping the pebbly ridge between Greeks, the enemy and themselves. The position of Sittaki has been variously placed. Chesney supposes Sheriat- Different positions el-Beytha to have been the site (vol. ii., p. 221). Sir Henry Rawlinson, on the of Sittaki. testimony of Captain Jones, thought that the western suburbs of Baghdad were built on the ruins of Sittaki (Bombay Government Records, No. XLIII., note to p. 3). Mr. Grote has placed them on the eastern side of the Tigris, and about three miles to the southward of Baghdad (map accompanying vol. ix.). Mr. Rawlinson, in the map prefacing the first volume of his ' Ancient Monarchies, has placed Sittaki, or Psittace, 33 or 34 miles to the south-eastward of the Diyaleh river, and on the eastern branch of the Tigris, Strabo says that Sittaki was on the road from Babylon to Susa, and 500 stadia from the former city. I shall venture at present upon no opinion of my own as to the proper position of Sittaki, but shall suppose it to have been near that marked in Mi'. Rawlinson's map. As 1 have only seen the first volume of the Ancient Monarchies,' 1 do not know what ruins Mr. Rawlinson supposes to have marked the site, or bv what name they are now known. Some ruins on the eastem bank of the Tigris, now callsd Deir, might correspond with Sittaki of Mi. Rawlinson. Deii. The Tigris flowed at one time apparently to the eastward of Deir, for Lieutenant Collingwood, who surveyed the country opposite this ruin, and traced canas running towards it, says : ' I traced straight on towards the river, and from the ' top of 4 Abdulla,' a mound a little to the southward, saw mounds on the opposite ' bank leading to Deir, evidently the continuation of the canal. 1 he other canal* ' I did not quite follow to the banks—high brushwood intervening, but they all ' J did not quite tollovv to me oaxiKs—u.gu r ~ ^ '-T 0 ; « centred in the same spot, and the people there mformed hat ^ a1 ' ' mneared on the opposite bank ' (Extract of a Letter to Coionel Kembail, C.b., Political Resident, Baghdad).

XLIU- d^npt'on o I From th i s important communication it results that there'is as vet no evidence now remaining for determining what ' was the line or position of the wall of Media, which had been supposed to he a ' datum positively established, serving as prem.ses from whence ^ deduce o.e ' positions mentioned by Xenophon' (vol. ix., note p. 88) A hne drawn trom Tel Kuneeseh to the ruins of Deir would exactly touch the ^u.orava now called Hubl-es-Sukhr, or line of stones or bricks The ruins of this wall may be now traced for about 10^ miles, and are about 6 feet above the leve of the soih It was irregularly built, the longest side running east-south-east toi 5^ miles, it then turns to the north -north-east 2 miles, then east l- 2 miles, turning (own south-south -east for another mile and a half. An extensive swamp to the north ward has done much towards reducing this wall. The two caravansei ais at Khan-ez-zad are also in a great measure built of bricks from it, and it lias, doubtless, supplied materials for many other buildings. There is a considerable quantity of bitumen scattered about, and it was probably made of bricks set in bitumen. I can see nothing in Xenophon which would show that this is not the wall the Greeks passed, for what he says of its length was merely what was told him. I think that this must be the ruin of the wall called that of Media which Xenophon describes, but I mention this supposition with much diffidence, and for the benefit of those better able than myself to judge of its being coirect. The distance from the northern point of this wall, as now seen from the encampment, might be, allowing for a detour, about 32 miles. Whether this was done in three or four days' marching has been disputed, but I do not think that this is of much importance either way. ' From thence they made, in two days' march, 8 parasangs, and passed two ' canals, one upon a bridge and the other upon seven pontoons.' These two canals might have been the Nahr Malka, and the old canal the bed of which is now called Hubl ed Dthehheb. This latter was either a continuation of the Nahr Malka or a stream from the Tigris. Allowing the 8 parasangs to be 24 miles, and that the Greeks crossed the second canal at the end of these marches, they would have done so at a point nearly 12 miles south of Ctesiphon, and nearly 15 miles from Deir, which I have already said seems to mark Mr. Rawlinson's Sittakl. Xenophon, after stating that they crossed these canals, says ' thence they came to the river Tigris, near ' which stood a large and populous city called Sitace, at the distance of 15 stadia u (H miles) from the river' (Spelman's Xenophon, p. 94). It seems to me that another day's march could be allowed from the canal crossed by a pontoon bridge. The island on which Xenophon says Sitace stood would have been formed by the Tigris on one side, the old stream now called Hubl ed Dthehhed on the other, and, perhaps, two branch canals. After crossing the Tigris the Greeks marched 20 parasangs in four days to the river Physcus, on which stood the large town called Opis. The position of this cpot has not been determined as yet. Mr. Rawlinson, in his map (accompanying vol. i. of his 'Ancient Monarchies'), puts it on the Diyaleh, which he supposes was the Physcus, and about three miles from the Tigris. Chesney has placed it 57 miles to the northward of Baghdad, close to one of the heads of the Nahrwan canal. Captain Lynch, of the Indian Navy, had previously supposed it to be on the same side of the Tigris (the eastern), but about 19 miles more to the eastward (Map No. VII. of the ' Expedition to the Euphrates and Tigris'). Mr. Grote has given Opis the same site as Chesney apparently. (Map in vol. ix.). Commander Jones, in a paper sent in to Govern ment in 1851, announces the discovery of the site of the ancient Opis, which he supposes rather confidently to be marked by the ruins at a place called Maniur about 38 geographical miles north of Baghdad (Bombay Government Records', No. XLIU., p. 215). 1 have mentioned where Mr. Rawlinson places Opis but I am unaware what ruins he supposes mark the site.

A small hill ot pebbles has been taken advantage of to build it with. The walls or ramparts are about 18 feet high, and have others projecting from them. The main ones surround the building or ruin, the whole covering about a square mile of ground. Less than a mile to the eastward is another similar ruin, but smaller.

It does not cover much ground, being 220 yards long.

This mound is built of sun-dried bricks, and is not so large as the other one. The mound of Kuneeseh is about one mile in length, and about 35 feet high. Kuneeseh. It is separated by a chasm into two parts, and is covered with a loose nitrous soil called in Arabic Subkh. Indeed, the country close to the southward is as white with saltpetre as if it had been covered with a thick fall of snow. The next old navigable canal to the southward is one which is universally Nahr Malka. allowed to correspond with the Nahr Malka, Basileios, Potamos or Flumen Regium of the ancient geographers and historians. The Ruthwaniyeh, a canal, Euthwaniyeh. now in use, but with several mouths of older date, has been cut apparently for a part of its course in the bed of the Nahr Malka. A part of it, which is unused, now reaches an old village called Ibrahim-el-Khaleel, beyond which the Ibrahim -el Ruthwaniyeh seems never to have extended. This village has some well-built Khaleei. houses in it, with an upper story to the rooms. The tomb of Ibrahim-el-Khaleel is now in ruins. The Arabs say this village was built by a Pacha of Baghdad, for a favourite daughter, and was in existence in the beginning of the century. It is 20 miles south-west of Baghdad ; 2^ miles to the east-south-eastward is another old tomb in ruins, called Sheikh Samer. From Ibrahim-el-Khaleel, the Nahr Sheikh Samer. Malka, which is now called the Yuseffiyeb, takes a direction of south-east by east with many twists, and many ruins on its banks. Following the old stream, we come to a very curious ruin called Abu Hubba, which bears south-south-west from Baghdad distant 20 miles. Here the stream bifurcates, one branch, the Yuseffiyeh, yuseffiyeh. going on'towards Ctesiphon, and the other, which is simply called et Trab, or soil, Trab. taking a more southerly course. . r™ TT ^ Abu Hubba itself consists of a mass of rums of a very irregular shape 1 he Abu Hubba. highest part, which is 59 feet high, is of a dome shape, and is on the south-west side of the building. This ruin is surrounded on three sides by a rampart or wall, in shape a rectangle, with openings every here and there This is 30 feet high in places The building inside is skirted on the south-west face by the blanch canal from the Nahr Malka, and it extends from that till it touches the north-east face of the rectangle. Its length is 1,300 yards, and breadth 900 yards. Deir, another D eir. ruin close to northward of the Nahr Malka, is something similar in shape to Abu Hubba and is distant from the lattor three miles to the north-eastward.

The Yuseffiyeh, or Nahr Malka, flows on with very sharp bends, and giving off many high-banked irrigants, passing close to the southward of Khan-ez-zad. On the northern bank of the old stream, and distant 11 miles from the Tigris and 1^ miles from the Khan, are some very extensive mounds, now called Ghazelliat. They cover a large surface of ground, and from the quantity of burnt date-wood to be seen amongst the debris in places where they have been opened for bricks, they appear to be ruins of buildings destroyed by fire. In a bight of the Nahr Malka, and IJ miles to the eastward of the principal Ghazelliat mound, is a Tel, or ruin, called Muneyter ; this word is probably taken from the root Nutter of the verb to watch, forming its noun of place Muntur, and diminutive Muneyter. This mound, though not large, is worthy of note, for it is covered in great pro fusion with iron slag, and cropping above the surface are remains of what appear to have been furnaces for melting iron. They are of baked clay and bricks, circular in form and varying in diameter from 5 to 10 feet. Branch canals from the Nahr Malka appear to have entrenched this building. Another mound two miles to the southward called Sukhreechy (derived from the word Sukhr, a stone), has a still greater profusion of iron refuse on its surface and in its neighbourhood. Not knowing the nature of this debris, I put my prismatic compass on a small heap of it to take a steadier bearing, and was surprised to find the needle deflected several degrees. From Muneyter the Nahr Malka is called Hubl-es.Sook, and flows on with various twists in a south-easterly course to the river, close to which its banks are very high; this part of it having apparently been frequently deepened. At the distance of nine miles from the river a canal with high banks has left the Nahr Malka, going to the eastward, having apparently joined the Tigris above Seleucia. Another, one mile to the westward of this one, also leaves with a northerly course towards the river. At the point where these emanate from the stream, their banks are very high. The Arabs call these places Shibbij, which may be a corruption of Shebak, a net, for there is literally a net-work of canals at these places, most of them only going a short distance. One of these two canals, extending close to the Tigris, might correspond with that cut by Trajan, and reopened by Julian to take their boats into the Tigris above Ctesiphon. There are very extensive ruins all about this spot, marking the ancient site of Seleucia. After the decadence of Babylon, and the death of Alexander the Great, Seleucia was founded by Seleucus Nicator, about 300 B.C., and became the capital of Babylonia. A most interesting account is given by Gibbon of the rise and fall of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, successively the chief city of Babylonia. W hen the latter city became a powerful Parthian town, Seleucia declined in power. It was sacked and burned by the Generals of Marcus, A.D. 165, and never recovered the blow (Gibbon, p. 78). Trajan had previously captured Ctesiphon (A.D. 107), but it had been restored by Hadrian to the Parthians. In 198, the Emperor Severus attempted the capture. The Emperor Valerian was taken prisoner, and tortured to death at Ctesiphon. It was at this time that Odenatus, Prince ot Palmyra, and husband of the celebrated Zenobia, attempted his rescue, but Sapoor, although defeated in the field, managed to hold the city. The Roman Emperor Cams captured both Seleucia and Ctesiphon in A.D. 283, but being killed by lightning, the Romans were compelled to retire. In A.D. 363, Julian, after capturing Perisabor and Moaga Malka, also tried to take Ctesiphon, but- failed. Perisabor was a corruption of Ferooz Saboor, a city which was also called Anbar. The ruins are still known by this latter name, and are about two miles north of Felujia. Though not in my work, I rode over to see the ruins of a town once so celebrated. Chesney supposes that a mound marked Tel Akher marks the site, but he seems to have been to the very spot, and strangely missed the name for a mound marked Medina. Ombarra, in his Map No. 7, seems to be meant for Anbar, or to occupy about the position. The city of Moaga Malka, that was after wards taken by Julian, was 11 miles from Ctesiphon. Gibbon says, 'the city or rather fortress ot Moaga Malka, which was defended by sixteen large towers, a ' deep ditch, and two strong and solid walls, appears to have been constructed at ' the distance of 11 miles as the safe-guard of the capital of Persia.' I do not know whether the position of this city or fortress has been in any way determined, but, perhaps, either the ruin now called Shaishebar or the Ghazelliat mounds might mark the site. Shaishebar, which is 11 miles from Seleucia, might mark the spot. It is a ruin of a square tower built of sun-dried bricks, in shape and»3 9 appearance iike^Akr Kijf, only much smaller. It is on an old canal, and has verv many mounds all about it, and debris of buildings cover the soil for miles. I have no idea what the meaning of the word is.

Their gifts or tributes, arms, rich garments, gems, slaves, or aromatics were humbly presented at the foot of his throne —(p. 696). It is the ruin of this palace which is now to be seen, and which is still called Tak Kesra, or arch of the king. Tak Kesra. As the ruin now stands, it consists of a magnificent arch, 86 feet high from the under part of the ground, and 82 feet broad at the foot. From this arch a vaulted room extends 153 feet to the rear. The roof of this has partially fallen in, and tradition says the place was struck by lightning in the year of the Prophefs birth. The building races the winter sunrise, or east-south-east, from which direction it has a most imposing appearance. The front walls of the two wings are alone standing, the rooms having fallen in. In the centre of the arch are marks of thousands of bullets that, report says, were fired at a huge ring which supported the curtain of the audience chamber. This ring had, doubtless, excited the cupidity of the Arabs during many centuries, and defied all attempts to remove it till gunpowder put a more formidable agent into the hands of its many enemies. Mr. Rich was told that this ring proved to be of gold. Ctesiphon is now the only Parthian ruin in this part of the world not converted by time and decay into a heap of rubbish. It was finally conquered by the Mahomedans soon after the death of the Prophet. Of the two cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon or el Modian there are not as many ruins as might be expected to mark their sites. Of the former, Tel Omer and Tel Omer and Sir- Sirhan, two mounds of no great size. (The former was opened by Mr. Taylor, han and other, now Her Majesty's Consul at Erzeroom, and Diar Bekr.) There are also the Ruins marking the remains of a wall which abut on the river, where it is upwards of 30 feet high, site of Seleucia This was built of sun-dried bricks, and appears to have surrounded the mound of an( ' ^ losl P hon - Sirhan. It continues in the same direction on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and, if we did not know that the rivers separated the two cities, as it now does their ruins, one would be apt to think that it formerly flowed to the northward of the latter city. There is a swamp near Tel Omer which has doubtless swallowed up many of the ruins of Seleucia, as low mounds and ridges of bricks and lime can be traced all over it. Round about Tak Kersa are some low ruins of buildings and a few small mounds. A canal seems to have passed close to the westward of the palace, and was probably from the Nahrwan. To the westward of the palace are the ruins of a wall similar to that on the opposite side. This forms an arc of a circle, both ends abutting on the river, with ruins of buildings enclosed. A mile and a half to the east-south-eastward is another wall, called by the Arabs Soor-el- Soor el Bostan. Bostan, or garden wall. It forms a right angle, with both ends on the river. There are two old tombs near Tak Kesra, one called Sulman Pak and the other SulmanPak. Hadaetha or Hadaefa. They are both supposed to have been contemporaries of Hadaefa. the Prophet, the former is popularly supposed to have been his barber. Ihe Tieris, after flowing past the ruins of Modain, continues to the southward for about five miles, and then turns sharply to the northward for about tlie , sa ™ e distance, forming a very peculiar bight. Exactly in a line with the direction of the Hubl-es-Sook or Nahr Malka, and on the opposite side of this bight are the traces Bight of river at of a canal or navigable stream, which I have previously mentioned called Cte.phon. Hubl-ed-Dthehheb. There are marks in the Ctesiphon bight which would show Hubl-ed-Dtheh- Sat in former years the bottom of the bight was to the northward of a line drawn heb. across connecting the two streams. I cannot help thinking that the Hub -ed- Dthehheb was a continuation of the Nahr Malka. I am aware that almost a ancient authorities (Pliny, Ammianus and Polybms jxec - « tha^ the Nahr Malka fell into the Tigris at Seleucia, but Ptolemy, lb , y 'Tt would'certaSlylia^be^rfen^rraour'advantage to the country to the^outh- 7728. c Nahr Malke,10 Kubl-ed-Dtheh- irrigants, still leaving water enough.to form a navigable canal flowing into the heb. Tigris at Seleucia. That the Nahr Malka and Hubl-ed-Dthehheb appear to have been one stream, a glance at the map will show. . Abul Feda says, the el Melek was the next canal to the southward of the Serser. Yakut! says, it is beyond the Nahr Aeesa, and watered 360 villages, and that it was dug by Solomon, the son of David, according to some, and by Alexander the Great according to others. The branch that leaves the Yuseffiyeh, at Abu Hubba, again bifurcates at a place, four or five miles to the south-eastward, called KJiushm- ed-Dhteeb (or the Wolf's Nose). There are several smaller canals at this spot radiating in different directions, and extensive ruins lie scattered about. The stream at this point must have been frequently deepened, as the canals have very high banks. One of the main branches passes close to the ruin called Shaishebar, Khusm -ed Dtheeb. which I have previously mentioned. I'rom Khushm-ed-Dtheeb the other branch goes to the south, turning after IJ miles due east, gradually assuming the appear ance of an irrigating canal. Close to the southward, and passing within a few hundred yards of this last stream is the bed of another old navigable one, the Abu Dibbis. Arabs call this Abu Dibbis. It leaves the river 34 miles above Habel, and flows close to the northward of a ridge of pebbly formation. It is very indistinct in places, the ground having at one time been a swamp. Numerous high banked canals'seemed to have joined these two streams, taking the water of the northern into the southern one, after its own mouth had become choked up or unused. Another Khushrn- This spot is also called Khushm-ed-Dtheeb, and the old canals form a perfect ed-Dtheeb. network, and cross one another in such confusion that it is with the greatest difficulty that the parent stream can be traced. It winds considerably, and has ruins on its banks ; indeed, were it not for the debris on its banks and the abrupt endings of the high-banked irrigants, it would, in places, be impossible to trace it. Branch stream of This stream must have taken nearly all the water of the Euphrates (left by the Euphrates. N a hr Malka), if it was not that river itself. From the paucity of ruins on the Euphrates to the southward of the Abu Dibbis, and from the immense number on this stream, it would appear that the old Euphrates flowed to the eastward of the pebbly ridge, which extends 13 miles south-east and north-west. There is a narrow gap between this ridge and one on the opposite side of the present Euphrates, between which that river flows. A canal might have been cut through this gap, which gradually enlarged till it took the whole of the river. What would seem to'make this probable, is the fact that the old stream, which flowed to the eastward of this ridge appears to have joined the present course of the Euphrates above Babel. - The old bed of the stream I am now describing flows close to the westward of Khan Bir Eunus, goes on with many twists and ruins, passing close to the eastward of Kkan Haswa, where it bifurcates. The western branch goes down towards Hubl Ibrahim. Babel, and the eastern, called Hubl Ibrahim (hubl—a line) passes close to the westward of the huge mound called Tel Ibrahim. This seems to correspond with Nahr Kuthiyeh. with the Nahr Kuthiyeh of Abul Feda, which, he says, left the Euphrates below the el Melek, and that it divided into two branches, one going into a swampy ii country, and the other entering the Tigris below the el Melek. The western branch is called by Chesney ed Dhiyab, but though I asked many Arabs by what name it was known to them, they one and all said that it was generally called El Mutn. el Mutn, which means a hard or raised roadway. I may here remark, Aat there are several names in Chesney's Map not to be Mounds mentioned met with now. Notably, the mounds of Mahomed, near which he supposes the by Chesney, called battle of Kunaza to have been fought (Map No. VIII. J, also tlu; mounds he calls Mahomed and Ashik -wa -Mashukah, 10 miles below Modain (vol. i., p. 56), names which I did Ashik-wa Mashu- not hear from the Arabs. &gt; l , El M tn El The Mutn, which is also called el-Khoor, or the channel, at the spot where it Khoor. 0 ' leaves the Hubl Ibrahim, goes on, with various twists or bends, towards Babel, near which it seems to rejoin the Euphrates. Four miles from the fork, and on the western bank of the stream, are ruins, Towaibeh. called Towaibeh. These are called the ruins of Kutha in Chesney's Map. Towaibeh is not an uncommon name for ruins built of sun-dried bricks. The word itself is, I believe, an Arabic abbreviation of the Turkish word Tabeah, or a Akr Kuf, Akr-el- fort of some kind. Akr Kuf, Akr-el-Gherbi, Shaisheba, Towaibeh on the Mutn, Gherbi, Shais- ^ another ruin, also called Towaibeh, 124 miles t0 the north-west of its hebar, Towaibeh. namesa ke, have all the same characteristics, and are the only ruins of the kind in this map.They have all a central solid tower of sun-dried bricks, with layers of reeds between the layers of bricks. They are surrounded by ruins of kiln-baked bricks and lime, and bitumen. Canals or streams have passed close to them. Thev give one the idea of having been watch towers, in the centre of the towns. 1 owaioeh is close to the eastward of the road between Baghdad and Hillah, Towaibeh and would strike the eye of any one passing. It is not quite four miles from Khan Haswa. On the ruins to the north-westward of the tower are two round knobs, which exactly have the appearance of a porch or entrance to the building. There are very extensive but low ruins all about Towaibeh. Froni here to the southern limit of the map, the Mutn has a great number of ruins on its banks. The plain to the eastward is covered for miles with debris of glass, pottery, glazed and unglazed, in such wonderful profusion, that however accustomed to the sight of ruins, one cannot but feel astonishment. For miles a horse cannot take a step without treading on glass or glazed pottery, made with a skill that is now com pletely lost even to the workmen of the capital of Turkish Arabia. The other branch of this stream flows (the present tense is only used for brevity) on with some very large ruins on its banks till it reaches Tel Ibrahim, which Hubl Ibrahim or mound, as I have already said, is the Kutha of Mr. Rawlinson. After passing Tel Kuthiyeh. Ibrahim, the Hubl seems, by Lieutenant Collingwood's map, to have joined the Shat-el-Neel, and to have fallen into the Shat-el-Hye, a branch stream from the Tigris. The mound of Tel Ibrahim is \1\ miles to the north-eastward of Babel; it is by Tel Ibrahim or far the largest mound in this part of Mesopotamia, is 1,000 yards in length and Kutha. about 60 feet high. Close to the south-westward is a smaller mound, on which is a tomb, from which the two mounds and the old stream now derive their names. In places where hyenas have made holes, and in places where rain has formed channels in its sides, the walls of the building are exposed. The surface is covered with more than the usual amount of debris of glass, pottery, and building material, and on one occasion, when I was riding across with Colonel Kemball, we found vases full of debris of bones and earth. Kutha, according to Mr. Rawlinson (or Cutha as he spells it), was the city peculiarly dedicated to Nergal or Mars. (' Ancient Monarchies,' vol i., page 172.) Seppara, or Sepharvaim, was, according to Mr. Rawlinson, Seppara or Sepha distant 20 miles by a direct route from Babylon, and near Moseyb. There are vaim. no ruins of importance on the present Euphrates in this neighbourhood, whereas the old stream, now called El Mutn, is lined with ruins. Is it not possible that Towaibeh (the eastern one), might mark the ruins of Seppara or Sephar- Towaibeh. vaim ? That the Euphrates north of Babylon did not flow in one stream as it now does, is not only known from the ancient writers, but, also, from more modern historians and geographers, and the truth of their statement is borne out by the appearance of the country at the present day. Herodotus says, that Nitocris, Queen of Babylon by digging channels above that city, made the river so winding that in its course it touches three times at one and the same village in Assyria. (Gary's Translation, p. 80.) The fleet of Alexander the Great was, for a time, lost m the windings of the Euphrates. Even so late as the time of Thevenot, ^-00 vears ago, the broad Euphrates was lost in numerous channels carried across the Windings and , country. Reauwolf, half a century earlier, says, the river was not navigable lower channel „f En- down than a place called Rousvaine (Ruthwaniyeh) ; beyond this there were rocks ? • dangerous for larger boats. As there are no rocks in this part of Mesopotamia, he, doubtless, alludes to the bricks and debris of buildings that lined the sides c streams. He also says, that by clearing away the stones the Euphrates might be made navigable to the Tigris. At Rousvaine, he says, the goods were landed and carried across to Baghdad, whence they were conveyed by boat to Busreh. He also states, that the Euphrates divided itself into so many channels that the pilots fit their W very frequently. Busreh is not necessary 0r The'EuiArates^hasf from the nature of the country, always been the river from which the ereat irrigating canals in this part of the country have been derived Its bed is higher than that of the Tigris, and consequently its water has been easi &gt; e over Mesopotamia. ^ 7728.12 This accounts c n-^nf phnnffes that have taken place in the Euphrates 0 . r f , fhp Tip-ris has apparently but slightly altered its even in modern times, whereas . h ' t difficulty that boats of any size can ascend the Euphrates, at ai. 0 f country, and the channel in the low channel in the across. absolute 'impediment to boats ascendingthe ascend the Euphrates, at all. the river i season is i rive^a^th^cenerall^take smalleHtoatsj into which they discharge their cargo at Ms spot re-shipping it further on. When I descended the Euphrates with Colonel Kemball in the spring of 1863, our boat had frequently to be dragged through the S' A .... moilng both .id„ 'fj of Chesney's expedition passed up and down and found from 1 ^ to 1 Cultivation. ^ A comparatively small outlay of money would not only render the Euphrates navigable, but would, by allowing the banks to be cultivated, add 'n&gt;nensely to the resources of the Pashalic. Besides this, Busreh would become a healthy town instead of a haunt of dangerous fever. Although the country comprised in this sheet is in most places a barren waste, where formerly most extensive cultivation existed, yet it is not entirely uncultivated. „ t . . No one who has not seen the country, can have an idea of the ettect that water has on the soil. The descriptions given by Herodotus of the fertility of the soil seem but little exaggerated. . , The Turkish Government adopts towards the cultivators a suicidal policy. It is not so much that the taxes are heavy, but the system of bribery .and peculation carried on by the Officers of Government renders these taxes but a nominal part of the actual outlay. The present Pacha of Baghdad (Namik Pacha) is believed never to take a bribe, and is very severe to those against whom corruption is proved. But this a most exceptional case, and is mentioned by Turks even with *. astonishment. In a country where an honest governor is a curiosity little im provement can be looked for in the improvement of the condition of either the soil or the people. Gardens and fields. Near Baghdad are large fruit gardens, which line the river banks. The date trees being the most valuable part of them. Cultivation is also carried on along the course of the river, the ground on the banks being irrigated by machines called churds ; these are of very primitive construction. The water is drawn up in leather buckets by horses or oxen ; by an ingenious contrivance these empty themselves as soon as they have arrived at the proper height; the water is thence led over the country in small channels. The fields so watered seldom extend more than two miles from the river bank. Wheat and barley, besides millet, sesame, castor-oil, cucumbers, melons, beans, and other vegetables, are chiefly cultivated. A system of irrigation by canals from the Euphrates still exists, although but a parody on that carried on by the ancient occupiers of the soil. There are seven respectable sized canals derived from the Euphrates in this sheet. These are generally farmed from the Government. Last year, 1 am given to understand, the income derived from them by the Government was as follows Irrigation. Canals from Eu phrates. Abu Ghurraib Ruthwaniyeh Mahmondiyeh - Iskenderiyeh Moseyb Nasruiyeh Mahaweel Kerans. - 22,500* - 6,000 - ^1150 220 kerans equal - 86^440 1 t0 100 ru P ees - Rise of rivers. - 3,041 - 17,500j The amount of gain from these canals, as well as the income derived by Govern ment, is constantly fluctuating, and depends chiefly in the first place on the enterprise and capital of the farmers. But their gain or loss depends upon the amount ot the rise of the river, as well as the contingency of a flight of locusts which sometimes devour whole fields in a few hours. 1 have seen the canals full of water in December, when much rain falls on the mountains, and a fresh comes down early.

The small scale of 144 1 000 , on which the survey of Mesopotamia is being taken, precludes the possibility of great detail. It, however, sufficiently answers the purpose, aud a larger scale would require a longer time. I am aware of the many imperfections of the sheet which I have completed, biit still hope it may be of some small use in helping to elucidate works of valuable information, like the 'Ancient Monarchies' (now being published) by Mr. Rawlinson. I have had no difficulties whatever to contend against in doing this part of the survey, save, perhaps, in eliciting truthful answer to simple questions fronf the Arabs, who are always too ready to say what they think will be agreeable. I cannot close this paper without offering my best thanks to Colonel Kemball, the Politicol Agent of Baghdad, who is always ready to place his knowledge of the country at the disposition of every one.
