Got a direct commission in the War. Was much liked by some of his officers, hut was regarded as too much of a bahu by others. He speaks and writes English and Persian very well ► He did excellently as a commander of a small post on the line of communications and as a News Reporter. Also got on well with Persian officials. But after he had left Persia, I found he had been acting as Agent for a scoundrel named Captain Bhandarkar almost (temporary, I.M.S.) who imported aiassct lakhs 1 worth of articles - motor cars, watches, haberdashery &amp;c - without paying customs duty, and sold them all over East Persia. He was run in eventually and had to pay double duty on a lot of things. Bhandarkar, after he was demobbed, finally swindled a lot of Persians, and he employed Khudadad to dispose of his remnant stock at Jurnin, where Khudadad was commanding. Certain financial agreements were entered into, which were afterv/ards repudiated; goods given to Persians Major C. K.

He 'belongs to one of the 'best and most respected yeo man families in Rawalpindi District. The family is an essentially military one, their land although good 'being scanty and subdiyided to such an extent that all the male members of the family have had to take to service for a livilihood. They have invariably chosen military service and no less than 36 members have srved or are now serving as Indian Officers.

Major Daly has reported that these indents were framed on much too lavish a scale. It is not therefore necessary to consider them further. The Government of India in their memorandum Ho. 28 (iv)-y, dated the 24th March 1924, sanctioned the issue of . ammunition to the Muscat Levy Corps from a stock surplus to the requirements of the Military at Bushire, which otherwise wfculd have been dumped in the sea. 120 boxes of Mark VI i ammunition were in due course sent in the H.I.M.S. w Lawrence 11 to Muscat, and advantage was taken of the same opportunity to send 60 boxes to Bahrain. here are three hundred rifles, the property of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, lying in the Hesidency, which the Company have authorised me to dump in the sea, and I intended doing this at the time of the final evacuation by the military garrison of Bushire. Majorf z Major DaXy has askdd for IBO of these rifles; they will at least be useful during the training of the men and perhaps will be found after trial to be sufficiently serviceable for retention. There is no necessity therefore at the xsoment for indenting mtXtoxx. - for either rifles or ammunition.

I notice that the men of the Corps are to he Makranis. As far as T remember most of the men calling themselves Makranis in Bahrain come from Persian Makran. I should 'be grateful if you would let me know how you are recruiting. Xf you are picking up men in Bahrain, you will prohahly get mostly men from sections of the Persian Makran trjhes who have 'been raiding us lately, hut prohahly some wiljljjj^^men who have left Bi itish ilakran for the good ' ' Wftntry. IPjnhe Makran Levy dorps now takes a large number of Makranis, and should you want us t-o enlist men for you in British Makran the Assistant Political Agent could prohahxy find you some good men. If you are getting men direct from Persian Makran .1 should like to know how you are proceeding, as I am Liaison Officer with the shadowy Persian force for 'the reconciuest of Baluchistan 11 . As regards pensioned Indian Officers and Non-Oommisioned Officers, the Baluch B.egiment doesn't keep close touch with their pensioners, and none of the battalions aie stationed in areas from which their Baluchistan men come. Most of these are Brahuis - not Baloch, and I don't think that ex-regular Brahuis would he suitable for your purpose, nor would the Dera Ghazi Khan Baloch. ■ This narrows you down to Binds, and there is no Bind Indian Citicer on tension suitable, though T get you 2 cSaUBfe* thinkthink you would do muoh 'better to take men who have served in the Hakran levy Corps.

As it taiccs a long ti^ia to fix these matters up perhaps it would 'be well to start looking for a relief early•Campnell completes his year on 20th August. I hare though the matter well over &amp; I think we should now go for a Subaltern, date of commission about 1920 &amp; should require hir. to take on the job^for two years with one period of privilege leave during the term. S U ch an offficer would have about two years to go before getting his captaincy. By the time his two years is up the Adviser should have got into his stride &amp; there sfeould be no mozsi necessity to repSUice the 0,C. Levies as the Adviser would be able to run the Levies with a good 1.0. The job should suit a harried subaltern very well-the pay &amp; the fact that he isould live here cheaply would be an attraction &lt;5: there is a very good bungalow attached to the job. The only thing is that it would be much better if we could get in touch with some young officer and apply for him by name.Vvhen left to the army,they merely send out a circular &amp; it is not unnatural that C.O s so arrange it that we do not get their best man,but generally an officer from whom the Regiment want a short respite* I do not know anybody myself-I could have written to my brother-in -law who is in the Indian Army, but I hear he is just now leaving on furlough. Do you know any suitable young officer V or ia it possible that Stover would know of someone .

The Officer is required to perform the duties of Commandant state Police (for discipline &amp; administration only n o t police duties) the State police being allied to the Levies for Administrative purposes• I do not think that the State would be justified in employing a Captain.Pension contribution also has to be paid &amp; with T.A. it costs the State about RSI500 per mensem.

No. @ The Agency, Bahrain. 3l8t May 1925. The Han'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire, Meriio rand urn . With reference to my express letter No.609, dated the 29th May, I beg to explain more fully the reasons why X advocate the return to India of 18 Rinds, despatch- -ed 'by the Political Agent, Kalat from ^uetta for enliat- -ment in the Bahrain Levy Corps. /he arrangements for the recruitment of these personnel were made by Major ^aly, but his original request was not for Rinds, but for .British ^ekranis - his object being to eliminate as far as jiossible the Persian element in the Corps. This was desirable for many reasons but particularly in order to avoid the possibility of the men deserting when they went on leave. I cannot for one moment 'believe that it was his intention to introduce into a small Corps of 125 ranks, of which 90 already had been recruited, an entirely new element, far removed in customs, habits and locality from those originally enlisted. If the age, habits and physique of these 18 Rinds were atall suitable for forming the basis of a new Corps, 1 would endeavour to keep them and make tne best of them. But many ol them are old men, their physique is decidely poor, and they are Indian Frontier tribesmen, who have very little in common with th Mekranis already enlisted. I consider that the discipline of the Levy Corps would be adversely affected by the retention of these men, an d I would strongly recommend following up Major Daly f s original intention of enlisting British Mekranis in the Corps. On the 27th April sgs party of 25 British Kekrani arrived from Gwadur. They were recruited by the CommandantII. v of the Mekran Levy Corps, through the good offices of the Political Agent, Kaiat. Unfortuneateiy seven of these men were found medically unfit on arrival, and nad to be returned at the Bahrain Government's e^ense. The remainder have settled down very happily and are so thoroughly absorbed in the Corps that it is difficw -ult to pick them out in the lines. I am convinced therefore that these latter are the type we require for the Corps, and I propose to ask for more of them at once, in order to complete the Corps to its full strength. It is necessary, ho?/cv r er, to insist on a proper medical inspection before the men leave the headquarters of the Hekran Levy Corps for Bahrain. I trust you will now approve of my returning the 18 Rinds to Q.uetta, and if so, I request that I may be informed oy telegram. Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain ' ? \m i ' ll 11 '.. ' Telegram R.

He ha^ taken no part whatever in loca~ politics. In view of his impending departure mC . the improb- -ability that he will ever return to Bahrain in any capacity, the usual objections to the acceptance of a gift, such as is now offered by Gheiich Hamad, would seem to bear little, if any, weight. n the otuer hand, Campbell has iiad charge of a number of t^e Sheikh^ ponies in the Port for some months, and Sheikh Hamad has shewn his satisfaction at the extra- -ordinary improvement produced by a few weeks of £;ood food and regular grooming♦ Cheilh Hamad naturally iinds in this a personal reason for expressing his gratitude in the form of a gift of one of the ponies. If Captain Campbell were permitted to acoept the gift, it would be most welcome to him, us he is in need of an Infantry charter for use on return to his re^ment. lor the above reasons I trust vou will find it '♦ Colonei C .0♦Crosthwaite, C.B.H•, Political Kesddent in the Persian Gulf#possible to recoismcnd to t^e Government of India that Captain Campbell may be permitted as a special case to accent a pony as a personal ^ift from oiieikJa ilainad»ON AJOUAIHUPOHT M J L35TY C0R} J 3 POH THR 1344 1924 TO JULY 1925). gcroiMjMT- I took over corfM^nd of fcha Levy Corps on 20th August 1^24• 4t that time Its strength me as follows:- Indian 0fficej*8 - 1 Havildar Instruetora- 1 Levy Oorua ran^s- 114 411 those man had been collocts^ in a very harried way ^nd given what uniform could be obtained for them at the tine.

I have the honour to forward a copy of a petition dated the i3th June 1925, from Subedar Kiaz All Khan, of the Bahrain Levy Corps, praying for promotion, to the rank of Indian Officer in the Indian Army, together with copies of covering letters from the Commandant of the Bahrain Levy Corps, and the Political Agent, Bahrain. 2. Subedar Hiaz Ali Khan has rendered good service in the Seistan, Muscat and Bahrain Levy Corps, as is evid- -enced 'by his promotion locally from Jenadar to Subedar. He was recommended fo#r promotion in 1921 'by the Commandant ■ of the Muscat Levy Corgs vide paragraph 3 of this office i | letter Ho. 319-S., dated the 22nd October 1921. 3. The telegram from the Government of India mention -ed by Subedar Hiaz Ali Khan in his petition is Foreign and Political Department telegram Ho. 772-E.A., dated the 8th June 1921, to the address of the Political Agent, Muscat. It was on the strength of the assurance contained in this telegram, that he would remain eligible for regimental promotion whlist seconded, that Subedar Eiaz Ali Khan accepted service originally with the Muscat Levy Corps, and I submit that it would be a distinct hardship were he to be penalised thereby. 4.&amp; 4.

Captain Caapbell has had charge of the State prison in the Port at Manamah, and has also submitted a report en the maintenance of that institution* a copy of which is attached* Captain Campbells report on the Levy Corps is a history of the Corps from the 20th August 1924 on whio.h date he took oyer command* The Corps had been hurriedly formed in Muscat a few months before his arrival and as hurriedly brought to Bahrein as a separate unit and housed in the fort at Manamah* When Captain Campbell arrived he found himself called upon to create almost the whole of that intricate organisation which is essential to the formation oi a new Corps on a permanent basis* The difficulties before him were considerable, isolated Prom ToIsolated as Bahrain is from all aouroea of military supply; the finances of the State had not yet been placed on a stable footing, and the demands of the levy Corps had to be reduced to an essential minimum. In spite of ttao^adTorss oiroumstanoes. it may be fairly estimated that Captain Campbell's efforts hare met with considerable success, and that after a year of strenuous work he has left behind him a military unit, which though untested in the field, is worthy of the name in drill, organisation and equipment. BHS1KH HAMAD expreesed genuine regret at^Can®bell* s departure just at a tiae when He had gained a working knowledge ef AraMc, and had continued to make himself \ thoroughly acquainted with local conditions in Bahrein. The organisation and Wtm-lUjfc of the State Police A and the maintenance of the S/feate Prison have been no small addition to Captain Campbell's duties as Coaaandant of the Levy Corps* But he has taokled them in the same energetic spirit, and has handed over to hia successor the skeleton of a very promising Police ^orce f and a mm* complete and well organised institution in the shape of a State Prison. 1 trust that it may he possible to express to the Government of India Hheikh Hamad's appreciation of Captain Campbell 1 s services as Conssandant of the Bahrein Levy Corps, a^d his gratitude for the loan of an Officer of such marked energy and ability I have the honour to be.

If this could be done it would be advisihle for the officer to arrive in Bahrain at least a month before Geake goes.so uhat he could learn the rope before he nas to take over.

I am not sure of the wisdom of posting too many non-official Butopeans to State service as the Government of Indian control over them is slighter, and I am inclined to think that the 6ommand should preferably be given to a Political probationer — as in the Mekran Levy Corps — who will find spare time to study Arabic.

Petition from Subedar Niaz Ali Khan of the Bahrain Levy Corps# Sir, In reply to your letter iro .274-S», dated 7th August 1925, I am directed to say that, at the time when Subedar Maz Ali Khan was first employed outside the Indian army, the necessity for obtaining Government orders sanctioning such employment on foreign service conditions appears to have been overlooked owing to the exigencies of the Great War» His employment in the Bahrain Levy Corps without specific Government sanction was technically irregular and it was presumably the absence of such sanction which precluded the regimental military authorities in India from considering him for promotion to the rank of Indian officer, 2. In the special circumstances of the case the Government of India have been pleased to waive the penal interest, which is due under rule, on the Subedar^ pensionary contribution; and provided the Bahrain State are willing to pay pension contribution on his account from the date of his first appointment with the Bahrain Levy Corps, the military authorities will accord official sanction to his employment in Bahrain and will take the necessary steps with a view to his promotion to Indian commissioned rank, supernumerary to regimental establishment.

In view of the very high pay the Subedar enjoys in the Levy Corps,which is,I understand some nine times as much as he would be entitled to in his Regiment L much more full than a Subedar of the Indian Army would draw under similar con ditions in the Gulf 9 the Deputy Ruler is not prepared to meet this extra expenditure,the more so as the high rate of pay sanctioned for the appointment was in consideration of the fact that it did not carry a pension. If the present proposal be accepted the Subedar will be earning pension &amp; his present pay would be disproportionately high. The ^eputy Ruler nas asked me to say that his Governmnet will pay the arrears due if the Subedar will agree to their being recovered from his pay in twelve monthly instajjnents &amp; future contributions will be similarly deducted from his pay in future.1 have not yet learnt what the sum due will amount to,but I imagine it will not be very great as it will be based on his ranic in tiu.

Ccsimand of levy Ccrpc in the Persian Gulf. Sir, I lime the honour to address@ you on the general question of the command of the Bahrain and Muscat Levy Corps, in view of the fact that some difficulty is experienced in obtaining suitable young officers from the Indian Ara^y for these appointments. 2* 1 ven after they have been obtained, it is generally found that they are not eager to stay for moer than their first year; they also consider themselves entitled to two while months privilege leave each year, wkiim an officer in civil employ would be more likely to accumulate his leave. 3. iajor )aly has suggested that, in place of an Indian Army Officer, it would be better and cheaper to engage an ey-officer from ngiand who would be a State servant pure and simple and would sei've for a considerable period of years. I do not eare for this suggestion, as I consider it essential that the Government of india should exercise some control over these officers, wore especially in view of the fact that the Levy Corps will shortly have to perform the duties now carried out by two detachments of the Indian Infantry regiment in the ersian Gulf*4. I Bubmit for the eoneideration of th« Government of India that it may be desirable at this juncture to poet young military probationers of the foreign and 1'olitioal Uepartment to these appointments. rheir previous military training would enable them to do the Lory Corps work admirabl&gt; ; they would get experience ttf dealing with State officials, and an opportunity for learning Arabic. At the same time thoy could be helpful to the Political Agent in many ways. As an analogy I can perhaps cite the officer who oowmands the ymkr&amp;n Uvy Corp®. t. hese UomHiiinclants Bhould hold the if? apiiointments as a rule for at least two years; they would then not be as expensive to the State as under the present system with its annual changes, and they would be more useful, as they would fairly know Arabic AKtity well in their second year. 6.

To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ^eiaorandum. Officers for Bahrain State Customs levy Corps, With reference to the oorrespondance forwarded under your Ho. I57 -S of 20th April, I have always been of the opinion that the Customs Directorship would best be filled by an official deputee from the Customs Department of the Governmnet of India,but I have always under#- stood from Mr Bower that the Department is short of men that juniours being well paid it would be difficult to induce them to come to Bahrain except on very high terms.It is quite essentiel that the pan appointed should be a gazetted officer i: not a subordinate« The principal ©'bjection to such a plan has seemed to me,that it is absolutely neccessary for the Shaik to have a second more or lees permanBBt official to understudy the Advise k act for him when on fmrlough.This an Indian Customs officer without any knowledge of Arabs or Arabic could hardly perform successfully^ This was assuming that the Levy Corps officer was likely to continue to be an officer seconded from India h liable to be frequently changedo If as however,it seems from the corres •pondance referred to,a suitable ex-Officer can be found for this appointment who would stay long enough to be of assistance to the Adviser ,the difficulty regarding the Customs Director is removed k undoubtedly a trained official would be preferable« As regards the selection of an ex-officer,may I suggest that any ex-officers now in India ,who are not provided withemployment, are hardly li^ly to bo among the be8 t type of ex- Indian Army Offi cer . most . of whon found nore or employment elsewhere . While interviewing officers ith a vi.w to selecting the Adviser for t he Strain State,1 met some dozens of ex-officers,very few of whom would heave been suitable for the post to be filled. f ' a os aware that as a precautionary measure,in case it should be of assistance,! asked Mr Belgrave to meet to take particulars of ex-Indian Army officers who might be suitable. He saw a groat number I was of opinion that most were quite unsuitable. There was however one who was apparently of the usual type /of permanent military officer, who was anxious for employment., t if you think it advisable I would suggest that we ' / //' might ©QBmunicate with him it that it would bo safer to take an ex- offioer who has been actually interviewed (#fe it ia very much in Mr/jJelgrave»o interests to select a congenial f.. suitable man with whom he will have to work) rather that run the risk of obtaining an unsuitable person. liajor.

Sir I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Bay telegram Ho. 264, dated the 16th April 1926, regarding officers for the command of the Bahrain and Muscat Levy Corps. As the Governmentjbf India have since then selected Captain K. W. (K Stephens for the command of the Muscat Levy Corps it may perhaps be useless for me to submit the^iame of an officer, no longer in the Army, for Bahrain. nevertheless in case the Government of India are finding difficulty in providing another officer, I note herewith the particulars JLX' of an officer whose name has been communicate&lt;yto me by Major Daly. 2. Mr. J. Parke is 35 years of age, married, and the son of a retired Colonel Parke, who commander a British Line Regiment. He was educated at Wellington, and gazetted as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1909 to the 7th Hampshire Regiment{ T.F.). He served^.n the Coldstream Guards as a probationer for one am* year in 1911, but resigned as it was too expensive. He visited India in 1912, and was the guest of Bawabzada Obaidullah Khan of Bhopal.

He was selected in Auguot 1919 for service with the let Yemen Infantry, and served there for one year acting as Major and Second in Com- mand* 3. Major Baajett, the ?olitical Agent at M ub ciat f hae informed me that he did not know Mr. Parke personally t but he remembers his nam© well axxi knows that he had a good reputation* 4. Mr. Burke passed the following courses since the ..ar — Lewis Gun # Hygiene, Machine Gun, and Senior Captain's rifle• In September 19S3 he joined the Zanzibar Police as a cadet, and was in charge of the Police Lines and Military Training. He was also Immigration Officer. He harassed an examination in Kiswahili, a Government Law Examination, and speaks Hindustani. He gives I*&gt;rd Montagu of Beaulieu as a reference and no doubt his confidential reports at the Colonial and War Offices can be referred to, if necessary. 5. Mr. Belgrave, the new adviser to the Shaikh, Met Mr. Parke and his wife, and stages that he seemed a capable and experienced man, and that he possesses a good working knowledge of Arabic. 6. I consider that an officer of this type might be pre ferable to any ey -officers now in India, who have not ob tained employment, as these latter will hardly be the best type of ey-officer; those possessing good qualifications havlr ing nearly all found employment by now. * 4.iu 4 * jl * w «.&lt;~x4!L igr Vo %&gt;£ euOiY&amp;n Uige to appoint an officer of this type to the Bahrain Levy Corps, as he will be of assistance to the Mviser, and, if necessary, can act for him when the latter is on leave.

Bat ed to commence enlisting and training men, 'but on recent visit to Bahrain I discussed question with Political Agent and Shaikh Hamad, and have come to conclusion that it is essent- -ial to have British Officer for two or three years, and raise and train corps at Bahrain. Hamad, as stated in my telegram Ho. 169, is very keen on levies as corps will give him independent 'backing and make his position much stronger. Even before it is trained, the actual visible presence of men under training will have good effect and strengthen Hamad*s position. It is in my opinion essential to success of reforms to get corps started forthwith . There is plenty of money available so I earnestly trust Government will sanction deputation of an officer for two or three Jsears to raise corps. After this, if an Assistant Polit- -ical Agent is sanctioned, and the corps has a good Indian officer, such as Subedar Hiaz Ali from Muscat,whose services can be lent, the former can easily supervise it. As force will have to have fairly strong detachments in Muharraq, Budaiya and Sitrah and possibly other places, it is necessary to have 150 as minimum - probably 200 will ultimately be necessary t Gapt.

I would reconsnend he leave his family behind until arrangements are completed here. Are recruits proved as meaically fit before enlistment and are they made to sign any agreement as to length/f and terms of service ? If so please, for ward a copy of the agreement they signed.

The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Major Clive Daly, or George Mallam as Acting Agent in Daly's absence), the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Trevor until April 1924, thereafter Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux), and Captains A. Campbell and T. H. Geake, Commanding Officers of the Bahrain Levy Corps for the first and second years respectively.The institution of the Bahrain Levy Corps was set up with the assistance of the Political Agent in Muscat, and the previously established Muscat Levy Corps, the intention being that the Commandant of the Muscat Levies, Captain Alban, would supervise the new Bahrain Levies, and that the first recruits for the Bahrain Levies be recruited from Muscat. However, the process of recruitment was hampered by Alban becoming ill, and a shortage of suitable men being found. Daly noted, in a letter dated 25 October 1924 that “the enlistment of men was mismanaged - many undesirables were enlisted and many unfit.” (folios 111-112). The main area of concern was the recruitment to the Levies of Persian Makranis. An express letter from Daly to Prideaux, dated 29 May 1925, noted that the Bahrain Levy Corps comprised 46 British subjects, 23 Persian subjects, 39 Muscat subjects, and 1 Yemeni subject (folio 127). This letter followed shortly after an incident, on 25 May 1925, in which one of the Persian Levies at Bahrain murdered two of his colleagues (folio 134). Continuous efforts were made afterwards to reduce the number of Persians in the Bahrain Levies (folios 187, 191).An annual report for the Bahrain Levy Corps, written by Campbell at the end of his service (July 1925), gives detail on the challenges facing the institution of the Bahrain Levy Corps, its recruitment process, disciplinary record, as well as information on the Bahrain state prison (folios 153-68).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Law reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000366#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
