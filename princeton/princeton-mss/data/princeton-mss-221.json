Title from inscription on fol. 1a. Physical description: 19 to 22 lines per page. The four treatises are written by the same hand, in a casual shikastah-nastaʻlīq in black ink with use of red. Thin paper with laid lines visible, glossy, frame-ruled. Collation notes and a few marginal notes on some texts. Fol. 52-end appear to be darker. The ownership statement on fol. 52a and the script suggest that this part of the volume might have been copied by another hand. On fol. 1a: several ownership statements, seals, and inscriptions in Persian; six-petal lotus in two double ruled concentric circles, with inscriptions. On fol. 1b and 103b: verses in Persian. Chiefly quaternions. Catchword on the verso of most leaves.
