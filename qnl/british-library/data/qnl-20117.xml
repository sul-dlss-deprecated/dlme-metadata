Ihe ..all of Matrah has been acting for Thomas during his absences, and presumably can carry on in the same way this.time so long as he keeps well. There-is little clanger of unnecessary expen diture as finances will be so close. A British Officer v ould be useful in check ing customs receipts fp-rmin - &lt;7-1 + laming Zalcat revenue at Sohar and preventing denrpdstiov,^ v ,r x- eoations by Hamad.

'K J- /-? ^ frfct'-u/-— j Naj fe \ \ ' -C5;D£NCV ! - I A- ^ ^ rttOOBDS; 8th April, 1930. -^w I am forwarding to you officially a letter from His Highness with reference to an extension of Thomas's services. I do not know what your views on the subject are, but personally I ara by no means satisfied with the present regime. The Council of Ministers now consists of (1) Saiyid Said - a boy. (2) Sheikh Zubair - what the Americans would call a -Yes- man; more of a courtier than a statesman. (3) Thomaso X In 1928, when Sheikh Rashid, the chief Kazi died. I was told by Thomas that his successor Isa bin Saleh was not appointed to the Council because he did not get on with Saiyid Mahomed, the then President of the Council. In 1929 Saiyid Mahomed died and I once more spoke to Thomas who said Isa bin Saleh did not get on with Sheikh Zubair and there was no other suitable person^who could be appointed.This seemed to me absurd. I recently discussed the matter with His Highness. H.H. fully agreed that more Ministers were necessary and said that he had often told Thomas so out that Thomas had objected. He said he would appoint some more but so far nothing has been done. ' y Tne Counci l as constituted means that in the absence of the Sultan. Thomas, when present, is virtually the ruler. This seeme to me highly objection able as it throws on us all responsibility for what is donedone by the Council. Thomas is a capable man in many ^ays. He has ability in dealing '^ith Arabs, but he is not invariably sound and does not tolerate restraint. He was largely responsible for bringing the Sur situation to a head in 1927. His sadzure of an Araraa sambuk caused friction ^ith the only section at Sur weix disposed towards the State, whilst his subsequent declaration of a fine of Rs 10,000/- on the Arama and his letter to the Bani Bu Ali calling on them to assist in recovering the fine, was ill advised, to say the least. His action on this occasion was taken without the approval either of the other members of the Council or of myself. It no doubt furthered the trip from Sur to Dhofar he undertook just subsequently. His chief interest is in exploration with its kindred subjects and where his own interests are involved they win always be placed first. ^ The vital question at the moment is finance and supervision over finance is essential, but I would feel more confident wiA an officer who kept his nose to the grindstone and confined his attention and energies to finance than I do with Thomas in spite of his abil ities. A less highly paid officer would seem to me more in keeping with the financial resources of the State. I should like to see a little more responsi bility placed on Arab Ministers but with a masterful character like Thomas they would undoubtedly be over shadowed. I think too that if a junior officer were appointed here he would find the situation intolerable. Thomas ^ould certainly take charge; he has tried it with me once or twice. UnderUnder the circumstances, I have misgivings as to the advisability of continuing the present regime for another three years. I shall be glad to knov what your views are and whether you would approve of ray officially taking up the question of increasing the number of Ministers, To The Hon'ble Lt-Colonel H.V.Biscoe Political Resident, Persian Gulfv'; • - ConflAential . D.O. «o. 180-S . Z 5 P BritiBh Reoidency and Cojisulate-ueneral, Bub hire, 16 th April 1930. My dear Howell, I forward herewith a copy of a demi-official letter I have received frem Murphy about rhotrns. I do not want you to take any action on it at present, but 1 should like to place ray views on record and uiscuss the raatter with you when 1 come to Simla; and I am Bending it on ahead as you may perhaps wish to glance through papers regarding him in your office and give the matter a little consideration before 1 arrive. .1 do not know Thomas well, neither have I seen a great deal of his work, but what I bave seen has not impressed me with his suitability for that particular post. He is an ardent «^plorer, a very fine musician, a good Arabifi scholar and in man^ ways a brilliant man: he however is impatient of control, and has uo ftdea of keeping slightly in the back-ground and encouraging the Arabs to run the Btate on their own lines, and as Murphy points out he has reduced the Council to a farce and refuses to put it on a wider basis. He has, I think, little inclination for hum drum routine and the details of administration. The finances F. B. HOWELL, JIBa C.B.I., WOmim BKCRKTAKY TO THK fiOVKKHMT N*:' 01? INDIA, SIMLA.finances of Muecat are ao you know In a deplorable condition; Thoraas draws H b . t&gt;000 per mensem — a large salary for a bankrupt State: Belgrave, in Bahrain, draws Hs. 1200. if one felt tfcat he was earning his pay by improving the finances it would be different. It Tfidj be contended that it is iMpossible to inprove u* -injinces (until, of course, we get the new Customs tariff): in these circumstances and if the Waair can only carry on there seems to be no Justification for employing such expensive labour. All that is required is a man ?^ho will prevent leakage and peculation and we ought to be able to get that for Ks. i2©0/1500. What I feel personally is required in Muscat is a somewhat more stable person that Thomas: some one who is content to supervise without invariably trying to direct: who will try and build up the Co line il and not to efface it, and who will really get down ^o the details of administration and save a few rupees here and a few there, and I think r rhomas is a somewhat expensive luxury. Of course it is not easy to get a suitable t man for a place like Muscat, but there are a certain number of Europeans in Iraq who are threatened with ihe axe and 1 mi^it sound Humphry^ on the possibility of getting a suitable man there.

He ie allowed one month^s recess per annum and can accumulate this up to 2 months and add it on to his furlough and this is wh&amp;t all the Bahrain officials now do # iee. after 2 or years* service they get 3 months furlough plus 2 months accumulated recess 9 and also draw the cost of Uie return ticicevS to Karachi of which they have nut availed themselves 9 and put it towards their passage home. 1 do not liice this \ is arrangement as 1 thinic a short recess is good both for a man's body and ifiind 9 but am not in a position to alter it* In any case X do not think it is desirable that the official F.V.Wylie Esq, G.I.E. 4 uty Secretary (Foreign) to the Government of inaia, SIMLA-official at Muscat should n .t take a recess. Muscat nowadays has fewer amenities ana a good deaX Xess society than Bahriiin, and X certainly think it would be a good thi»K if the official re went into ivamchi **% anj rate for a couple of Months. If,however f he ia going to do this then he should got Mare furlough than the Bahrain officials do, since he will not he able to add recess and if aonths furlough per annum seeing to me v^ry illiberal especially having regard to Gulf conditiuns. For the above reasons 1 do n t think it is desirable to give the Officer at iui^eat the came torsos as at Bahrain. on the other hi&gt;nd it rauut be borne in Kind that when the Bahrain contracts were first drafted it was assuraed that the officers concerned would reiaain in the service of the Bahrain Htate for a prolonged j?eriod and in fact would raake their careers tiiere and it is for this reason I imagine that he initial pay was low and the rateof increment siaall. 1 think b years is long enough for any man to stay in Muscat and therefore the contract should be based on that assumption* 1 would like to modify my original proposals as follows:* a). 8 months 1 recess at Karachi instead of 5. '.the navy told m I hut a us cat is une of the coolest places in t e Oulf during ^he Munsoon and therefore if the of iciul concerned goes on recess for a couple of months before the mon soon breaks he should be able to get throu^x the summer all right.— — - -3- b)o xhe contract might fee terrainabie at 3 months* notice on either side Instead of a zBanchs* as In the case of isaViraln* c). I do not think 6 raonths 1 leave after 3 years is excessive. Bahrain get 5 months after 2 or 2t years. d). As mentioned above, Bahrain get eoiae assistance towards the cost of their yasBages ho roe , oving to the fact ^hat thei' do not taJce recess. As it is desirable that tine Muscat official should take a recess and that no inducement should be given to him to forego it, i think the £&gt;tate should give him a passage home* I admit the conditions which I now propose are somewhat more liberal than the Bahrain conditions* but personally X regard the latter as distinctly illiberal and if we are to get the right stamp of man for Muscat then we must offer somewhat better terms mid Justify ther on the grounds that &amp;usjsat is a worse place to serve in and that a short term of contract is eontemplatecu ^ (fc \h/i* '//V Extract from personal letter dated 21st June 1930 from Colonel Biscoe to Major Fowle, Muscat. • • • • • xx xxx xxxx X XXX X XXX Howell is writing to Baghdad about a successor to rhomas, but, please keep this to yourself for the present.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Subject;- Abdication of Sultan of Muscat. Sir, /&gt;? I have the honour to submit this despatch in amplication of y telegraphic correspondence ending with my telegram Ko.K/28 of 4th September 1930. Impression of the Sultan. 2. I stayed t w o days in Dehra Dun most of w hich time ^as spent in the company of His Highness. It ^as the first time that I had met him. Various of my predecessors have given character studies of His Highness, varying considerably in their estimate^ Thus to Mr. ^ingate the Sultan was incredibly weak, pompous and idle, not really extravagant, but silly about money, a vain and idle puppet, and - as a ruler - generally useless, (vide Mr. Wingate's letter No.898 of 26th April 1920 to Civil Commissioner Baghdad; Confidential note to Deputy Secretary Foreign: undated; report of meeting between Mr. Wingate and His Highness dated Ambala: 8th September 19i0). On the other hand Major Murphy stated: 'I have personally a very high opinion of Saiyid Taimur's abilities and think, that under , / fairer circumstances, he would have made an admirable ruler M . (Major Murphy^ D.0.Ko.T/40 of June 27th 1929). I incline decidedly to Major Murphy^ opinion: probably the ten years which have elapsed since Mi. Wingate came in contact with the Sultan ' i i • n•*1 s ' (£' Sultan have improved the latter's character. I found him indeed a very pleasant personality; far from pompous or vain: on the contrary simple and unaffected, with a sense of humour,intelli gent and -ith abilities certainly up to the average, and probably u-^ove. Our relations throughout our conversations were most cordial, Kr. Thomas's departure, 3. His Highness seemed to take Mr. Thomas's departure philosphically, which was convenient. Unfortunately this philosophy was evidently based on the state of mind of benevo lent neutrality described by Colonel Trevor in his letter Uo. 256 of 4th October 1921, (a state of mind I noticed in His Highness even before he made his declaration as to not return ing to Muscat):'His Highness*s present idea is that he has now divested himself of all responsibility for the administration of the State, and thrown it on us, and that he can live at his ease in India on a comfortable allowance ' 4. His Highness 1 s doubts on the change of Financial Advisers were apparently as to the qualifications of Ifr. Thomas's successor, and once I was able to assure him on this point his mind seeiiied at rest. I enclose copies of letters A and B received liom him (the translations are in the '^ords of his confidential clerk Khan Baiiadur Ahmad ShubailyJ .Letter A was received before I met His Highness, and is the one referred to . _ me m my telegram of 30th August 1930. . Letter B ^as given/by the Sultan after our conversation. In it, besides definitely agreeing to Mr. Thomas's departure .the Sultan states it is necessary that the Adviser should take part in political as ell as financial ailairs. This was in reply to a question which I casually put to him as to whether he thought it advisable that the Adviser should only deal with financial matters. The question is not germane to this despatch, and ^ill be dealt -ith in another in due course. The question of Mr. Thomas's departure having been settled, there remains that of the Sultan's abdication to be dealt with. Sultan's5« Sultan^ abdication* 5. His Highness, as already reported telegraphically, announced his decision of never returning to Muscat, ^lien I expressed surprise at this decision, he remarked, (as stated in my telegram No./^Ltfof^ ^ that he understood we were well aware of his intention. It is true that Major Murphy referred to it in his D.O. No.78-C of 15th November 1928 quoted in my D .O. to you No. ■77c of J- 0 -***-11 So § after your interview with His Highness in December 1929, in which - though given a special opportunity to do so - he did not allude to his abdication it was concluded that he had probably abandoned the idea for the present. (Your letter No.^tf?5of faujudUi I ivy to Government of India). 6. I naturally used all possible arguments to induce the Sultan to alter his decision. I pointed out that - as he knew ^ well - both you and I had his interests at heart; that H.M. Government - on your representations - was doing its utmost to relieve the financial necessities of his State vide the scheme of raising the Customs dues from 5 ^ to StxxM 7i %; that you hadk^applied to the Government of India for a moratorium of the next repayment of the State debt; that you had personally proceeded to £&gt;ur and induced the Amir of Ja*alan to lower his flag and promise good behavious for the future, and so|forth. I pointed out that satisfactory as the Council of Ministers had proved, it was only a makeshift; that what Arabs really appreciated was a personal ruler, and tnat ttie person to fill that important post was obviously His Highness. My arguments were of no avail. The Sultan merely became perturbed and re iterated his protestations that he would not return to Muscat, giving ill-health as the reason. As he had made arrangements to go tiger shooting in ten days time, this reason - as pointed out in my telegram No./&gt;Ztf of , can hardly be held as valid. I asked him frankly was it because, when he was in Muscat he had not sufficient funds for keeping U p position properly,,entertaining Sheikhs, etc. He replied in in the negative. When I asked him what he thought should be done to fill his place, he replied that there were various individuals, including his son. Saiyid Said, who could beh 4. made Sultan. 7. ilie fact is that he has a M complex w against Muscat and its responsibilities which he heartily dislikes, and nothing- as far ae I can see - will remove this complex. Courses open to us« 8. There is the obvious course^ of accepting the Sultan^ abdication forthwith, and backing Saiyid Said for the Sultan- ship, (In this connection see Major Murphy^ D.O.No, 7? C of|5th November 19c:9 to P.H,), Sai; id Said is intelligent, jatr but still rather young for the responsibilities of the Sultanship, If could postpone Saiyid Taimur's abdication, somehow or other, for another year, it ^ould be a distinct advantage• 9* In this connection I suggest that it -ould be woTtljwaile J tsxtz? before any other action is taken, to try and draw the Sultan do^n to earth from the attitude of benevalent neutra lity which he has adopted (see para 3 above), and I append a draft of a propositi letter to him for your approval, -^hich explains itself. I have made it out as coming from me, but you may prefer it should come from you. It is possible that when the Sultan realizes that his abdication would bring him pecuniary loss he may postpone his abdication which is just what we want. In the meantime there is no hurry, as His High ness in any case is not due at Muscat till December, and we can await his reply. 10. Personally, as I have already stated, I like the Sulta n &lt;* and have no wish to be hard on him, but business is business and if he does not choose to do his job, I do not see why he should be paid for not doing it. The allowance from the State, should, in my opinion, be the lowest amount which will keep him in very ordinary comfort. There is nothing new in the idea of reducing the allowance vide the Political Resident's letter -■&gt;0.256 of 4th October 1921 to GoTOrnment of India.■ 5. U. In addition to his personal allowance paid by the Muscat State the Sultan has two subsidies: one for the loss of Zanzibar and the other compensation for cessation of the Arms Traffic* But both these subsidies are at present paid into the Muscat State treasury towards the repayment of the Indian aovernment loan of 6^: laks• Vvhen the loan is paid off in about a year and half the Sultan, if st.ill ruling, will presumably again receive these subsidies. If f however, he has abdicatedj then, as 1 understand the situation, the Zanzibar subsidy will be paid to his successor, (as it is payable to the Sultan of Muscat, vide letter to His Highness Saiyid Thowainy Aitchison treaties volume 12 page 225) 9 and the Arms Traffic subsidy disappears altogether# It is personal to the present Sultan vide Political Residents letter to the latter No.137 dated the 21st April 1923, and only while he has tenure of power vide telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, repeated to Political Resident No.3675 of 26th Nove.ber 1929, 12.

On the 6th August I have received your letter Ko # K.5 of 19S0 dated the 51et July 1930 despatched from Karachi. I delighted ^ith its arrival and read it minutely and noted whatever you have reclive|t from the Resident the instructions he has received from the Government of India to give us the im^o^-i^nt advice whicn is useful to our State, particularly in the economical view to reduce the budget of the expendi ture of the Muscat State treasury, in this case it is necessary to change the financial minister and to employ in his place an officer ^ith salary less than &amp;sx ^hat it is at present. Wis pay must not exceed Rs^l 00/- ione thousand t-o hundr^J with promotion in the six or three years up to Rs.1500/- (one thousand and five hundred). And the present Minister of Finance to the Muscat State should he given a notice to prepare to leave his post after three months and the new Officer will take the charge of the financial ministry on the 1st of Kovember. The Government of India expects our confirma tion on this suggestion 'Hiich is for useful benefit to the treasury of Muscat State, In reply I say ; a letter forwarded by me previously to the former Consul before my departure from Muscat requesting the confirmation from our friend the Government regarding the service of TTazir Thomas the Financial AjIxxxj &amp; xxxx Wazir and Adviser, to be prolonged three years more the passed years, o ing to our appreciation for his service ; and as ;7e are well acquainted with his advices and he is an able amn in his duty.

Finally he (viajor Fowle) asked me to travel to Au scat for two or three weeks, but I did not a^ree to do so and in all the repliee that - t^ave him i regarded him as /our representative and of the friendly Oovernarient ( of India ), and he finally stated as you have also done that an interview with you was absolutely essential and then he asked me whether it would be possible for me to go to Karachi to meet you.

As regards what you say that in the event of xqy renouncing the rule of our State and abdicating, the authority will rest in the hands of a younc ruler, devoid of experience, in my belief and opinion, he ( my successor) is fully qualified like his predecessors and with the help of the Government and as^istance 01 intelligent men and the support- -4- «apport of God, he will be afele to effeet iiaprovcment® in the litate, an-., to carry out the duties assigned to him ana the undertakings towards the friendly Government of India* I do not claim anything which appertains to the Hultan of lluscat and , 0?aan.

W . 1 .6922/30. 10th. October 1930 With reference to previous correspondence 'betv/een you and the Government of India as regards the appointment of a successor to Thomas as Financial Advise r, / Muscat, I enclose copy of a demi-official letter, dated 5th October, from Hedgcoclc, in which he raises three points. As regards the first point, there seems no objection to his travelling via the Gulf, and possioly definite advantage, in that he might be able to ca3.a. at Bushire on his way out? Subject to your o oservations, we think he might be told that there is no objection, and unau he will be reimbursed actual travelling expenses, possiuly subject to a maximum of the cost of a first-class P &amp; 0, fare to Muscat, while we do not normally give free passages to wives in tne case of short-term contracts, we^iave on occasion done so where it was desira/ble to get a man who stood out lor uiiis concession, Hedgcock has represented personally that he • .Lieut, Col .H, V. Bi scoe , I, A,, ' will Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. BUSHIRE, Point 2.- Our Financial Department advise thavdll draw a substantially smaller salary in I.uscat than he has 'been drawing in Iraq, and that, as he has three children who are now heing educated, the terras which he has accepted will leave very little margin. It is possible, in these circumstance a, that Muscat aay 'be willing to pay his wife's passage, and vie a,re inclined to think that the concession, if they see no objection to granting it, would 'be not un r e a s o n a'b 1 e. Point 5, - The Financial Department here advise us that the normal Indian practice is that pay shall start from the date of assuming duty. The Colonial On ice, on t /ie otnor hand, I understand, normally pay half pay for ® period, of the voyage from the date of embarkation. Having regard to Hedgcock * s circumstances, there is perhaps something to be said, if Muscat sees no objection and the money can oe found, forepaying him at the half rate on the Journey out, subject to the condition that he shall not oe paid for a longer period than would have been taken had he travelled by P &amp; 0. to liuscat. As all the points involved are matters for decision oy the liuscat authorities, who will have to bear the expenditure involved, and as there is very little time to spare, I have ventured to write direct to you about this.

(-) According to the terms oi my engagement, I am entitled to a 1st class B cabin J . a 0. fare to Muscat. By travelling via Baghdad and by the slow mail dorn the Persian Gulf, 1 could pick up my kit at Baghdad and also, should he wish it, visit the F.R. at Bushire. 1 presume th b.U uilc re v'ould be no objection to my travelling by this route instead of by F. &amp; 0. As to do so would ' be partly for my own convenience, I should not expect to draw from the Muscat Treasury more then the cost of the P. 0. fare mentioned above. (2) May 1 assume that my wife's passage will be paid to Muscat? As Thomas ^as unmarried, and drew a much higher rate of pay than I shall be draw in'-, no precedent exists (3) ,? 111 my pay start fran the day I leave England for Muscat? In this connection I may mention that the date originally fixed was postponed for two months owing to difficulties in obtaining the Sultan's consent to my appointment. It is understood that, should I travel by the overland route, 1 shall no~o be entitled to pay for any period prior to the sailing of the P. &amp; 0. which I should otherwise have taken.

Personally I am of opinion, for a number of reasons, that this extra responsibility should not be put upon the Adviser, and I gather that you are inclined to be of the same opinion, vide para 4 of your letter to the Government of India No#494.S, dated the 16th September 1930. 2 # If he is to do his work thoroughly the Financial Adviser should be free to devote the whole of his time to financial matters. The Council, for instance, acts as a sort of High Court in serious cases: murder etc. The proceedings of the Court -in Arab fashion- are protracted and the Financial Adviser -as full member of the Council- has to attend the sittings. This is merely one example, there are many others, of the way in which his time is spent in matters otaer than finance. In this particular instance, apart from the waste of the Adviser•s time, I douht personally -though I happen to 'be a firm believer in capital punishment- whether it is desirable for a British officer, even though in the employ of the Muscat State, to be a party to the infliction of local■ ■ poi -I I I I k Kflf'death sentences* 3. Our aim again is to endeavour to make the State stand on its own feet, but this is difficult with a British officer -the conduct of affairs naturally drifting into his hands- in political charge of the Council. 4. From our point of view a Financial Adviser in control of the Council, or at any rate fully sharing in its responsi- hilities^creates an awkward situation# The Political Agent is responsible to the Political Resident for affairs in general in the Muscat State and should -in my personal opinion- exercise whatever political control is necessary. Yet side by side with him there is another British Officer -the Adviser- who wields as much, and perhaps in some cases more, influence than he does. Moreover, since the Adviser is a British Officer, though in the service of the State, anything which he does is regarded locally as having the sanction of the British Authorities, in spite of the fact that he is an indepenaent official not under British control. 5. So much on general grounds. With regard to Mr. Hedgecoclcfe appointment. As he will be new to Muscat he will not in any case for some time be able to assume political responsibilities and will require all his energies for tackling his financial problems. TOiat I venture to suggest is that he:- (a) be given a seat on the Council -this would seem advisable to give him the necessary prestige, (b) have the title of Wazir -which merely indicates that he is such a member, (c) but have responsibility for financial affairs onljf -the rest of the Council carrying on the general adminis trati on# This change of status would be explained to the Council officially. At the same time, if you see fit, a hint might be given to Sayid Said that in political matters no important step should be taken without informing me. I am sure that3. he would 'be ready to do this, as we get on very well and I think that he has taken a liking for me# Perhaps you would oare to discuss the matter on your approaching visit to Muscat. v^- 'V c ^ajor # Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's consul, Muscat.

Sir, /) 7 ' I have the honour to invite a reference to para graph 4 of my despatch Ho.494 -3 of 16th epteraber 1930, regarding the appointment of a new Financial Adviser to the Huecat State. 2. I stated therein that I would addrets the Govern ment of India later on the question of the exact functions to be exercised by : .fr. ledgcock, who has now been selected for this appointment, and as I have now had an ctpportunity of discussing the matter with the Council and the Political Agent I submit my views herewith. 3. When Mr. Thomas was first appointed it was decided that he should not be a member of the Council, but within a few months, at the request of His Highness, he was appointed a member with the title of Wasir, and this arrangement has continued ever since. At th&amp;t time the Council consisted of four Muscat members and Mr.Thomas. Since then one of these .../ri these has died while another hag resigned, end of late the Council has consisted only of Say id laid, the heir apparent, j Shaiich Zu^balr and Mr. Thomas* - he result has not been alto gether happy. Pm&amp;id Said was till recently a minor; Shaikh 7.ubalr hfcs plenty of other work to do, such as the trial of judicial cases, etc., and ttxe tendency has been for the Finance member to take many decisions without reference to the other members of the Council and also to assume charge of the political and internal affairs of the state. 4. In a memorandum addressed to me on the subject, Major Fowle writes as follows:- 11 2. If he is to do his work thoroug ly the Finan cial Mviser should be free to devote the whole of his time to financial matters. The Council, for instance, acts as a sort of High Court in serious cases: murder, etc. The proceedings of the Court - in Arab fashion - are protracted and the Financial Adviser - as full member of the Council- has to attend the sittings. This is merely one example, there are many others, of the way in which his time is spent in matteri other than finance. In this particular instance, apart from the waste of the Adviser's time, I doubt personally * though I happen to be a firm believer in capital punishment - whether it is desirable for a British officer, even though In the employ of the Muscat State, to be a party to the infliction of local death sentences. w 3. Our aim again is to endeavour to make the State stand on its own feet, but this is difficult..■ f D/ difficult with a British officer • the conduct of affairs naturailji drifting into his own hands * in poXiticsl charge of the Council* ' 4.From our point of view a Finaficial Mvieer in control of the Council, or at any rate fully sharing in its responsibilities, creates an awkward situation. The Political Agent is responsible to the Political Resident for affairs in general in the Muscat State and should - in my personal opinion • exercise whatever political control is necessary. Yet side by side with him there is another British officer - the Adviser - who w^ilds ss much, and perhaps in some cases more, influence than he does* Moreover, since the Adviser is a British officer, though in the service of the state, an jtthing which he does is regarded locally aahaving the sanction it is desirable to strengthen the Council as much as possible and to endeavour, as Major Fowle puts it, to make the State stand on its own feet as far as its own internal affairs are concerned; and as long as there is a British officer on the Council it is almost inevitable thst more and more power will be concentrated in his hands and the general direction of affairs be left to him. For the above reasons I consider it essential •• of the British authorities, in spite of the fact that he is an independent official not under British control.* I agree generally with these views and consider that•4- eeeential tnst the Council sho (Id be Btrsngthened and. restored to it£3 former numbers and recovfaend that His High ness the Sultan should 'be InTited to noBilnate two other membeTB to the Council* The heir apparent, with whois 1 discussed the matter this morning, informed me that it was difficult to find suitable persons to serve on the Council; at the same time he fully agreed as to the desirability of adding two additional niemfcers, and I hope the difficulty will not prove insuperable. 6# I further recommend that the Financial Adviser should not be a member of the Council* He will then have ample time to devote to the re-organization of the finances of the State, but will not interfere in local politics or in internal affairs which do not involve expenditure* At the same time it will clearly be necessary to establish a modus Vivendi between the Council and the Financial Adviser as regards the control of financial matters. I suggest therefore th t the Financial Mviser should present the budget to the Council in December each year ( the Btate financial year coincides with the calendar year ) and thst it Should then after discussion be passed by the Council; should disagreements arise I have no doubt that they could be composed by the friendly advice of the i clitic id Agent* Once the budget has been passed then the Council should not be empowered to incur any expenditure not provided for in the budget except with tne advice end concurrence of the Financial Mviser* On the other hand the Financial Mviser shofeld not be entitled to raise salaries or incur expenditure not pro vided for in the budget except with the concurrence of the Council* ' ayid -aid Informed me this morning ^ \Hi, ''all! Hiifc 'IIK iix MJll ill ll It f i tl nil 11 n M i ,:!• | not been customary in the past for e regul &amp;r budget to be brought before the Council each year end readily agreed to the suggestion that the Council should not incur expenditure not provided for in the budget without the concurrence of the Financial Adviser provided the latter was iimilsrly bound, and mentioned that in the past sclaries had been raised and other expenditure incurred without reference to the Council. 7. in discussing the matter however with the heir apparent and rhaikh i -ubeir, T made one stipulation, and that was that the Council should not have power to reduce expen diture on the Levy Corps without prior gpnsultation with the Political Aitent . I pointed out to them that in the peet the Government of India had been called on to defend the State against outside aggressions. ven so lately as last .April they had solicited the support of the Pritiah Government againfct their rebellious subject, the Shaikh of KhaaSAb. told them that so long es the &lt;5tate had to look to the British Government for protection and support the British Government had on their side, in my opinion, the right to demand that the state should contribute their share toward® their own defence ana the maintenance of order in their own territories. This they were doing by maintaining the Levy Corps, which was adequate for the defence of MUecat and MUttra agsinst everything except a general rising in the interior and ought to be able to deal with minor distur* bances occurring within areas within which the writ of the Muscfit State runs. 8, T am addressing to the Government of India a separate despatch regarding the general policy to be pursued in connection with the Levy Corps in the future and am recommending thet instead of the somewhat haphazard fashionIn which this Corps ha» been run of late, a definite policy in connection with it ahould be laid &amp;$wn aad a fixed allot- Eient maide for it© ra®intenance• It lu this allvtmnt th&amp;t J suggest should not oe touched or reduced oy the Council except after previous consultation witb the British authori* ties# The heir apparent and halkh Zubsiir ret*4iiy a^r^cd with this stipulation, which tjiey admitted in ihe oircu ^stsnoee, quite reasonable. 9* I would mention that I x 'aund ay id Bald Much /- developed since t was here a year ago* He is now 21 yea s of age| evidently takes a keen ;ntereet in the affaire of the ' tt^te fetid d focut-eee matters senaltly and reasonably# I consider thi t he Is s; .aping well and should in course of tla^ Oovtrnmenl of Tndit, and ir so - would request that ' tmy be tent early instructions so thet the sew regime may 'be ln» troduoed se soon as .Ir.Hedscock arrives i.e. by the 1st January.

Reference my Memorandum No. K/117 dated 11th OctolDer 1930 to the address of the Secretary. The State gunboat AL SAID returned yesterday from DHOFAR where she had taken the Wall of the place returning from leave, and whence she was to bring Mr. Thomas bacic to Muscat at the conclusion of his leave which he was spending there. 2.* Mr. Thomas did not return on her, but sent a letter to me to the effect that he had applied to the Council • for one month's special leave without pay 1 from 1st - 31st December . As there are no communications with DHOFAR except by dhow , which take a considerable time, or by the AL SAID, each of whose trips costs a certain amount in coal, no reply can be sent to this 1 application •• 3. Mr. Thomas's absence of course at the end of the financial year when he should be preparing his Budget Estimatei for next year, especially in view of the fact that a new Financj al Adviser is on the way to take over his duties, is most in convenient. The State of course saves Rs 2-,000/. ' .J 4. From reports brought back by the AL SAID it appears y i that Mr. Thomas has made for the RTJB-AL-KHALI. He left DHOFAR about the 10th. If it is his intention to try and cross the desert it seems .unlikely that he will be back by the end of this month. 5. I have learnt from Mr. Hedgecock that he is arriving here on the 30th instant. He will take over the duties of Financial11' Financial Adviser immediately from Saiyid Said wh» is at presenl carrying on in th.e absence of Mr# Thomas. i • ^ Political Agent and H.B.M* s Consul, Muscat Maj or IN.v i'y t's&gt; ✓ •*9»' 3/' b COKFIDBITTIAL.

As Mr. thomas was entitled to this leave the terms of his contract, mm as his application was dated jth •• ctouer, and as he announced his intention of proceeding at as early a date as possible, I did not raise any objection to It, as he would at any rate have been back by the end of Kovernier ,and would nave a cluar month in which to prepare the budget ana to make the necesuai^ arrangements for hanuing over t &gt; his successor. £ «• • •, -* na -- r Article 41 b) of t'm Financial Adviser*s cretract it is stipulated that the annual leave of one month i© to tc spent Outaide uocati tue oojeot, ol course# bein 4 that the leave should be spent in some place where the cliiaate would be beneficial tu the Financial Adviser's health.

I also make some comments below on the points raised by Mr. Hedgcock which you may like to consider. They are of course only my own personal opinions. '2. Mr. Thomaa 1 letter of 13th March is explanatory of his letter of 11 th llarch and it is the latter .that can be A made, as it seems to me, a basis for decision. 3. ( Reference para 1 of I. r. Hedgcock's letter ) . Mr.Thomas took 6 months leave, while he was on this leave he was put on duty for 3 months (vide India Office letter dated the -L4th June 1928) with His Highness the Sultan. To compensate him for this 3 months duty, 3 months leave was given to him. In his letter of 13th March he claims these 3 months duty with His Highness the Sultan as a furlough earning period. This seems to me correct. 4. ( Reference para 2. ). I am not of the opinion that he overstayed his furlough.

Sir I have in my letter No.Bl/1 of tc-day^'s date raised the question of recovery of payment of sea passage from London, on the occasion of taking up the appointment of Financial Adviser to the State of Oman. I shall 'be glad to have your approval of my claim for £ 73 sterling which sum 1 paid for a 1st class ticket from London to Muscat, enclosed are shipping documents in support of the expenditure, I would venture to point out that I have already within X the past year home the exper^se of a .journey from Trans-Jordan to Bushire, Muscat, Bombay and Kashmir and hack for the purpose of 'being ,, vetted ,, for the Muscat po^t.

I have the honour etc Bertram Thomas, Financial Adviser,Oman StateV' 'J • ( xifci'erence jjara 5 ). The most important ^oint on whicia aroitrailon is requested Is that which, concerns Mr. Thomas proceeding on j.eave irom Dhofar a ithout prior consent oi' the Council. That he did so proceed is heyond dispute. .hen the M Al iSaidi'' left Dhofar to return to Muscat (para 5 above Mr. Thomas instead of returning, sent hy her an ♦application for leave without ^ay from lst-31st December. Owing to the distance ol i&gt;hofar from Juscat no reply could be sent by the Council, more especially ab the 'Al Saidi M brought back news that Mr. Thomas had gone into the Huba-al-Thali. And even then Mr. Thomas overstayed his 1 application* as hedid not return to Kuscat until the 6th March. ..hat maKTs Mr. Thorns' action all the more grave is the fact that the Uuscat State, to v ,hich Mr. Thomas was Financial Adviser, was m a anTicult financial position, ana that a new Financial Adviser was due to taJce over from Mr. Thomas at the end of December* o. Tnat i..r. 1 nomas has no explanation for his conduct can be seen from the copies of the correspondence between us attached herewith. All he can say is that he was My letter to Mr. Thomas dated 8.2.51. J delayed in his Mr, Thomas* reply dated 9-3-31. My reply dated 9-3-31. ^ 0 ™ x. Er.Thomas* final letter dated 13-3-31,' ^^ -x.ar and en route ' u...rough circumstancea outside his control'. What was well wimin his control was his leaving Ihofar for the Huba-al- -i-a-i instead ol for his post at Muscat. J * si'hat . r. Chomas' letter ci 9 th harch does reveal is tne lact that when he went to Dhofar he intended to make his desert journey. His statement 'when I left Muscat I did so in the belief that I would accomplish my journey and be oack aoout the time of the arrival of my successor' cannot possibly be accepted. (Though in any case it is something of a side issue). Nobody knows better than Mr. Thomas the delays attendant even on an ordinary camel trip in Arabia, much more on a journey of exploration such as ne contemplated. He did not arrive at Phofar till about the middle of October, and could not have counted on getting his Arabs cl nd camels together ready to start till early November. His actual journey from Dhofar across the desert and back to Muscat took him 3 months, (from aboxz^t xOth December to 7th March), and this - allowing for inevitable delays - v^as quick travelling. .;hen he left luscat therefore he could not have counted on getting back to his post before early February, his successor - as he knew well - being due at the end of December» p ^ 10. That Mr. Thomas performed a courageous and brilliant I - 1 | t f |\ f i « i i m m i i i n1 ' pj feat of exploration 'by his conrinnt -i ^ y conaact is of course quite beside the point, ether travellerft uxd.vex±er&amp; have performed equally admirable feats of ex ex^^oiation without neglectin£ the duty which thpv n- « +i • ^ UIie;y 0wfc employers -whethei the la z Ler v .ere Govern^nt or otherwise, and there i a no reation why Kr.Thomas should not have followed their example, 11 me -iLh regard to the specific question jmt for ar itration by Kr.Hedgcoci. It certainly appears to that sowe penalty should attach. To take analogous cases If a Political ar Military Officer had acted as Mr.Thomas had done the Civil or Military Authorities would undoul tedly have shov.n spme mark of their displeasure, and this mark would most probably have involved pecuniary loss m pay etc to the officer concerned - if indeed it did not take a severer form, if rr. Thomas had been the employe or a business firm, he would most likely have been summarily dismissed. There is no case of Mr. Ihomas being dismissed, as he has already left the service or the State. By the terms of his Contract he is, however, due so many months furlough and full pay for service under the buate up to the date he left it» Eut in every contract there are certain implied promises, one oi ihem being of course that an employe'' will not taxce leave without permission, and this Mr, Thomas has deliberately broicen under circumstances which aggravate uhe oreach. It. would seem therefore to be for considerati whether the Muscat State should be ice pt in full to their side of the agreementj or whether a penalty on Mr. Thomas of total loss of benefits accruing after termination of his service - i.e. his period of furlough and full pay - should not be inflicted. 12. I have not considered what actual sum is, or may be, due to llr. Thomas. Once a decision has been given on the above point, and on the others put for arbitration, by LiX* iledgoock, iiie matter is Tor accounting in the Muscat Treasury .If the latter find that they have already paici - i • inomas more t^xan is granted hy the decision, that is their affair. I do not imagine that they will succeed in getting the balance back fror Mr. Thomas. Joave the honour toffee.

Hedgcock's resignation, i.e. that It should be accepted and that he should stay on the two or three months he proposes to the Council until the new Financial Adviser - asked for by the Council - is procured. In any ct.se - though he has not yet signed any contract with the Council, (for the reason - as he told me - that he thought it a bad one from his point of view), he could hardly throw up his billet at a moment 1 s notice. 5» On general principles it is not advisable to try and retain the services of a dissatisfied and disgruntled.official and the tone of his letter is sufficient to show - besides various examples I have had of it here - that Mr. Fedgcock is both. He states for instance that his and the Council's le tter s' have n o_t so much as been acknov/ledged' 1 . There is no object In Acknowledging 1 a letter until the recipient is in a position to take action* All his letters have of course been sent on by me, but as I pointed out to Mr. Hedgcock more than once ( but without result), his method of supplying information piecemeal in separate communications, .each ox considerable length, is bound to lead to a ^wood which cannotV&lt; be seen for the trees 1 . Ti-is ia exactly what ha s occurredf endeavoured to give a financial picture of the state by ' summarising his letters in my r0 .83-3 of 25-3-x93l . r,-. 0 . e ' were, however, still sote joints not cl^ar, and on receipt of , ^ our - I asKed i r. liedgoooi; for the auuaourieed $ ' information required by you. Instead of biin c ..leaded at the / y 'acknowledgment' 01 his letters in the very practical form of an enquiry for more light, Mr. Hedgooolc in reply informed me that lie was not gc ito discua^ the Levy iiudget any further, and that he intended to resign. I told I'r• Hedgcooic t at whatever his reasons might 'be for resigning I did not see why he should xefuse bo ^ive Uie ir^x orniution asked for, and finally ait Ox a long conversation I persuaded him to conie and tallc it over with me next morning. Next morning, however, 'brought not Iir# HedgooCiC, out a note irom him to the effect that 'on second thought if he had gone uaca-c co his original view that he would discuss the Levy Budget no further. I think I would have been quite justified in leaving tne. matter there, and reporting to you that I.r• Hedgcock refused to give the information asked for. I do not think, however, that a Political Officer is paid ^standing Oxi ixis Q.igni oy ix anj/ uiiin^-, is uo 'be gainec. 'by stepping off it, and so as Mr, Hedgcock would not come to see me I went round to his house to see him, and after another long conversation persuaded him to change his views, I suggested a schedule form with some notes as the most convenient way of presenting the information required. Mr. Hedgcock produced the schedule, and finally - after some further persuasion ( he stated he did not like his figures 'being ♦queried*) - his notes. to In order to assist him and/endeavour to get the letter ready for the mail I offered to have copies of his schedule, notes and letter of resignation typed in my office, v , ; hich was. accordingly done. 4. I have given the above incident in some detail as it shows clearly the frame of mind in which Mr. Hedgeock now rs. Another reason against his continuance here is that ~ since committing himself to a most pessimistic view of the financial future ofthe Staoe axter tlie ^ o j-itical Resident* ^ vi.-it i ^ he has shown a certain indii'f erence to the .o ^ibi. itv ch ^ increasing the Stated revenues. when I visited Gwadur in connection with the muraer 01' Ghulam i su^e^ed to I r. Hedgcock that he should accompany me, not conneatic.. ..ith the murier of course but to investigate financial conditions on the spot. The sloop which was taking me would doubtless give him a passage too, u; d ho could ci .ccompany me back on the mail, special arrange: ents lor diverting which would be made, thus involving a minimun el absence fro:,. I'uscat. He said he woii^d rather net come, .oohar, which previously he regarded as a possi^^e source oi exora revenue, he no., dismisses as such, ile ma,/ oe right buo ne cannot sa,/ for certain until he has been oi.ere and made investigations on the spot. I have suggested this to him pointing out that the deposition of ijneikh Hamad afioras an excellent opportunity for lightening of the revenue administration there. He seems luke-warm, however, a.out a visit ana talks vaguely of taking up the question of* the provinces in the Autumn 1 . 5. o^riexly t.^e^e is al.*. che difference Detween a financial Aaviser who is 'all out' to increase the revenues of the State, and one who - because he has committed himself to a certain definite prophesy of bankruptcy - sees his prophecy in danger 01 being nullified by any unexpected increase of revenue. ;,..x • hedgcock seems to me to be in the latter position — admitte a difficult one. 6. I do not wish it to be thought that my strictures on Mr. uedgcock are in any way actuated by personal feelings, or that I do not recognise his good qualities, or the good work he has done here. If indeed my personal relations had not been most friendly with him I could not successfully have taken the action mentioned in para 3 above, and thereby saved him from putting himself in a false position. He is a capable hard working financier and following Mr. Thomas has a difficult job to tackle. But he is f temperamental 1 - though he does not look it, impetuous and impatient. His habit ox putting up his case piecemeal in a stream of letters, apparently as xiesharguments occur to him, ha* not u little complicated t situation. 7o 11 decided to accent r. Iled ^coclv* s resignation it shouia iiot oe dinicult to rind a successor* The terms offered by the btate are good, though Mr. Hedgcock is dissatis fied with them, (para a above), nor should his sucu ^sor find his taSxC a dixficult one uj. uer the investigation which I-'r. Hedgcock has made ..ith the various departments of the dtate. In fact j r. Hedgeocic 1 s Derm 01 duty here mi^ht be regarded as ohs visit, oi a ijiuancial expert, (such as is uhe fashion now-a-days for nost small countries to receive), Who has made certain linancial ^ecoiimiendati ons, which have to be weighed against certain other considerations, (e»g. contentment of the armed icxces o^ the i^tate) , and which will gradually be put into force as circumstances permit, I have tiie honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^\c . ^ l-aj or, Political Agent a I: .is, Li's Consul, i..usea . ■ P. Mr.Hedgcock has at the last moment, sue more , handed me another letter, his resignation to the Council, for forwarding to you. I have no time to comiient on it. I have informed him that I cannot, of course, let him hzve a copy of my despatch to the Political Resident as it is confidential*I i il/tuscat x0'tin Ai&gt;ril 193JL. My dear Major, ~y Wlxen I came to Kubcat, the State was 'bankrupt; since then, in spite of a number of small reforms, the financial position has 'become worse? revenue has steadily fallen, and the State's liabilities have increased 'by over Us#50,000 In oidei to prevent a complete financial 'breakdown^ I drew up a retrenchment scheme mhich in my opinion would qjickly enau j .e d oii tiixy expenditure to 'be met from monthly income» In putting this into effect I had expected to be able to rely on tne help and co-operation of the Government of India; the reverse hab been the case» The crux oi tnis programme was a 1*2^$ cut in the emoluments of the extremely well-paid, not to say over-paid. Levy force* This reduction was approved by you, by the Council ox Ministers, by myself and by the Commandant, who made a reservation, not strongly pressed, that the cut in pay might lead to discontent- The Council of Ministers, with their wider knowledge of local conditions, did not uphold this objection; nor did you# As you are ai.are, the Political Resident on his visit here on February 15th sanctioned only a 5% reduction. Had cogent arguments been advanced in support of this . decision, I should have accepted them even though personally I might not have found myself in agreement; as it was, only sentimental reasons were given me# With due respect I venture to submit that a bankrupt state cannot afford to entertain reasons of this nature# Since that date, the Council and myself have written to the Political llesident pointing out that the financial situation is more serious than he thought it v/as on his visit here, and asking him to sanction at once, instead of in the autumn, the second cut promised by him# Up to date these letters have not so much as been acxcnopledged# It is perhaps difficult for officials of the Government of India, accustomed as they are to think in croret. oxi / a. /' rupees, to realize that a mere matter of two or threi— ie as laldis is 01 vital Importance to a small State such lluscat* I wish to assure you that the Council regards with considerable alarm the country's growing indebted ness, and is at a losfc to understand the Government of India 1 s attitude in the matter of the Levy budget. For a bankrupt State to ask for no more than a 16% reduction (a reduction ox 39% has just been sanctioned by the Council on the crew ol the State 1 s gunboat) on the average expenditure of the last two years seems to me a most moderate demand., the more so as the economies can be effected by pruning- extravagances which ought not to have been allowed to exist, and will neither reduce the numbers ol the force nor impair In any way its military efficiency. I ha\e now spent three months and ten days in trying to okj lain tiie sane cion ol the Government of India to what I contiider essential for the realization of my retrenchment sheme. Anything short of this will not enacle cue Staoe to pay its way# At present I seem to *-• e as xax ^iorii success as I was at tne beginning® In the circumstances it seems to me that I am doing no good to myself or to the Government I serve by remaining in charge of Fuscat 1 s finances while my financial advice is consistently disregarded by the Government of India* i see no other course open to me than reluctantly to tender rny resignation from today^s date. Yours sincerely, Sd/~ S.S.Hedgeock.n I / Ministry of Finance, Muscat # 14/4/31. / axa^/ I enclose a copy of my letter to the President oi the Council of Ministers giving the reasons for my resignation.

The former SGa-jas to tain*. Uic.t tne financial ..-ositlon is iiuch losa serious than I h&lt;!ve stated it to be, and a &gt;ar- -ently for that reason is unwi .ling to make tne reduction wiilch the Council h-.s asked for in the pay o. the Levies, At t e s\ ,e ti^ne, it seeiiis to be exp-w'ot;;d that t v., i tate of luscat should m&amp;k.® cofn* sidorable reductions in the other auch lower paid □rancher, of the administration. (3eep.A. f s letter dated 18/. /3 ; Froia the outset I realised that the Q-overnciert of India attac u : ;d mch 1 ^ ortanoe to tne ..maintenance of an efficient Levy force in Muscat. Hence, in s ;ite cff suj^estions to the contrary, the Council at my request agreed taat there should be no reduction in the numbers of the force; in addition, the budget a proved ^ them a provision for he long-delayed re-armament scheme of a sum five times greater than that sanctioned i.* the £ /i eviou^ j ,, Strictly speaking, the state ofthe country's finances d6 ©s not justify the very uodera^e sacrifices which the. Levy authorities have been asked to make, and had it not been for the Q-overnment of India's known interest in the force, much greater econoiaies wcaild have been demanded. As it is, the two alternative proposals now before the Q-ovornaent of India ar.vo boen kept uj the lowest possible laininiuia consistent with the country's bankruptcy. These are, as you are aware, (X) A. 16% reduction (made up of approx. 10% on un necessarily extravagant expenditure, and 6% real economy) on the average sjendin^s of the last two years, provided that the sepoy's pay is reduced by Hs 5 p.m#, and that of N.C.O.s' pro rata . The sepoy's present pay was fixed in early pre-war days, ana it out of all proportion to prevailing rates; the reduction is further justified by the recent marked fall in the price of living. This is the method I should prefer, as it enables me to make the clftanest and most satisfactory job of the proposed retrench- ■ But, as I mentioned to you some five or six weeks ajo, we cannot press the Government of India to make this Rs 5 reduction in the pay, if they are convinced of its unwisdom; hence, we must offer a reasonable alteraative # -) Tills alternative la a 22&amp;£ reductloa on the average expenditure of the last two years, free of any atlp- - ulatlon as regards reduction in pay. Tiae incraase froa 16% to 3C|^ is due to the fact that the lower the pay raductj.oa in the Levy, the lower it win DeJ ' n v - ^i-nt.3, and thia loss , if country is to pay its way, be compensated for by aalcing for a higher percentage cut in the Levy e.pendlture. So far, the Government of India has not accepted either alternative, nor S ivan adequate reasons why these iaoderate proposals cannot he aet. Instead, the best offer it can make is a budget of Rs 1,10,000. whloh total has only been reached after negotiations extending over 14 weeks. As this budget represents only loi-% reduction on the previous two years' expenditure, and Includes a cut of Rs a instcaa of Ps 5 in the sepoy's pay. it will be seen that it falls conslderaaly short of the Oovernuent of Muscat's jlnljjuu requireiuents outlined above, and does net enable the T3tate to aeet current expenditure from current revenue. (A telegraaj has just been received saying that there will be no British Coaaandant for four months; but as this is only a temporary saving, it is excluded under para 3 of ' Jly N0 3 17/3 t(:&gt; t *' le P - A - fro « the 16% or 2:1% reduction mentioned above») It ■jeema to be expected, however, that this budget of P ' a L ' :e ' 000 ehoulu prove acceptable to the State, as its 0 ' a i '' * H3 2000 tha -' 1 compromise budget approval y le , ./n /31.

The failure to appreciate this point is the reason of the present impasse, Tiiou^h ohe imiaediate cause of ray resignation is the L^vy budget, my disagreement with the apparent policy of the Govern. aent of India is actually based on more fundamental la sues, into which I need not enter in this letter.

While at Beihi I discuBsed the Muscat questions generally with the foreign Hecretary though in the absence of detailed figures I was not in a i ^sition to suhmit any concrete proposals, Mr Howell took the view that a cut In me^s p^r was a serious natter and was inclined to think that had the proposal to reauce the pay of the men by ns. 2 been referred to the (jroverniaent of India it would probably not have been sanctioned. Ho wye r, as I had arranged the matter locally, he did not propose to interfere, and generally he saw e.Ve to eye with me in this matter, namely, that while we were quite ready to assist hedgcock to the best of our ability by effecting every postable economy in the levie^, it was not a matter in which we should move too fast; he agrees that We cut already made was adequate for the time-being but that we were of course quite ready to consider the matter further later on, if this economy . proved inadequate. While we felt the force of walker's argument that it was undesirable to liave men serving alongside each other on different rates of pay, we felt it might ultimately have to be itaced as a reduction of pay in the case of new entrant s Major 'r.C.w. ^owle, C,ii.K. , 1, a. # Political Agent, Muscat, C/o The Postmaster, Karachi.!r2« entrants seemed to be the nniv ,•, i onl u feasible solution of the problem. In view of the fact that a large number of the men are on furlough and the Commandant is normally on a two-montha' recess, I recommended that no successor should be appointed to alker for ioar months, and this was approved. This will effect further bj.\ O j. ab, ut -ts. 5,000 and therefore we a ball have agreed to a saving amounting to Rs.17,000 against Hs.21,000 asked for by Hedgeook. lie must admit therefore that we have met him very : t w r liberally. ^ consider that in the circumstances his resignation displays quite an unreasonable spirit, and a complete failure to I recognise the support that he is receiving. Onfc one point he seems to oe under an illusion: in his 'Levy Budget: precis of erents' of which he sent me a copy with his private letterpdated fl ' whe vi*i -ilarci* he sGates that the sanctioned strength of .^1 the Corps is 130; this, as you know, is not the case. The sanctioned strength of the corps is about 240 and it has been reduced fron that figure to the present strength without reference | to the 'OTermnent of India, and we feel that a halt should now - 1 be called} the State have always objected to the corps; the Sultan tried to ^et out of having a Levy corps when it first started, and naturally when they find the Financial Adviser i determined to cut down the corps as far as possible, they greet the proposal with enthusiasm# As regards the proposal for a loan, iledgcock suggests that we should 0 et sanction for it, but that the Council may or may not accept it. You will, I am sure, realise that it is not for Keggcock to apply for a loan but for the Council! it is quite impossible for me to go up to the Government of India and ask them to sanction the Imm and thea to be told that the Council donH want it, and I do not think the matter should have been m*- submitted to me in this form.

I gee your point but 2 thunk the issue will have to be faced, cannot have at Muscat as Financial Adviser an officer who informs the state that all their difficulties are due to the unsympathetic attitude of the Brit ish, government# 1 think you might let Hedgeock know the view taken in Delhi about any further reduction in the » men's pay, which I have given above. This will anyhow show him that it is not likely to be approved. If he goes, the matter is set led and all is well* If he reconsiders the matter, then think there is nothing to be done but to advise the Council to accept his resignation. As long as he is there relations between the State and the British Government are bound to be bad. He is ouviously sulking, arid will make no effort to improve the Stated finances, since this will prove his case. It would be better to get rid of him ana then work gradually to undo the mischief he has done. As regards Alban I agree that while acting as Political Agent he should only advise, as you will see froza a copy of sy despatch to the Government of India which I am sending you. If you hold out to iiaiyid Said the bait of being In executive charge of the finances, it may make him think better of keeping on Hedgeock. 1 s -mm ■ ■ ■ 1 m I i i ■ 11 ■ ^ h v ■ v l\ i' Yours sincerely, sd/- H, V, Biscoe, fa?L r J ✓ No.202-.S of 1931. ritish residency S q Consulate-Greiieral f Bt shire, the 22nd pril 1931.

Before commenting on Mr. Hedgcoclc f s letter, I will trace briefly for the information of the Government of India the sequence of events since Mr. Hedgoock took over charge of his present appointment. Mr. Hedgcock assumed charge oh the 1st January last, and was apparently horrified at the financial condition of the state, which he described as being bankrupt. He accordingly came to the conclusion that, if the budget was to balance, drastic economies must be effected, and he further decided that the Levy Corps were greatly over- paid and before any other economies could be effected it was . ■ nmm i hhi ib m jr- that the p^y of the leriea ahould be reduced, end '™ .h. c„. m „ t . of ' th. l. w bot . tlpulatiia th&gt;t pay Of the sepoy, which wsb fixed at H« w/ Xdtjcea ax Ks.30/- per mensem, must be reduced bv Ra s/ * oy Ka.5/-, contending that otherwise he would be unable to call on other dep.rtoents to .ake sacrifices. Prolonged discussions took place between himself and Captain .alker and. the latter under protest and because he was told that the state was bankrupt, finally agree.; to this proposal, but stated that it would produce discontent and affect the morale of the Corps. Sarly in February. I arrived in Muscat and came to the conalusion that so drastic a cut in the men's pay was not justified, either by the terms of their contract, or by the financial position of th.. u * oxoioh 01 tne s t ate . ji. or yearb pa8t the condition of the Muscat State might have been described by a financial purist as one of bankruptcy, but I was hope- ful that the reduction in His Highness' allowance, increase of revenue from a revised tariff and the more efficient control or the customs in Sohar and Sur and other measures might produce an increase of revenue, and I did not consider that it was fair to the serving-men of the Corps to effect such a large reduction in their pay. 4 * 1 discussed the matter at considerable length with Captain walker and Mr.Hedgcock, and it was finally agreed that a cut should be made in the basic pay of B b ,2/- and further that a reduction of rates of good -conduct pay should also be effected, the total reduction in many cases therefore being Rs,4A. The reduction in the basic pay could be Justified on the ground of the fall in the cost of living, and Captain A'alker assured me that this reduction would not c r eo. t e # * «« .i ■ ■ *. i j-3- create any discontent in thp -e -orps. I msy mention that the S nal sanctioned strength of the Corps was 240, and it has now been reduced to 150, no further reduction in the number Of personnel was therefore possible if the Corps was to retain a ue . b fighting f orce. Captain Walker further agreed to effect many other reductions in the number of followers non combatpnt personnel and a total reduction in the levy budget of a.12,000 was agreed to. I also stated my willing ness, not as stated in Mr. Medgcock's letter, to agree to a further cut in pay later on, but, if the financial position made it absolutely necessary, to consider further economies in the -bevy Corps towards the elose of the current year. 5. I left Muscat in the belief that the matter had been settled and accepted by both parties. Shortly after ny return, however, to my surprise I received a letter from the Political /gent to thefeftt^t^t^the^fSSt^o, mon was worse than had been anticipated and asked for a further cut in the men 1 s pay. This request was supported by no figures, but nierely by some isolated notes from Mr# Hedgcock, showing there had been a decline in the customs receipts# The Political Agent did not support the request# I considered however that it would be desirable to give e considered reply to the Council and I therefore instructed the political Agent to obtain from Mr# i^edgcoclc a revised budget estimate to substantiate the contention that the finances of the state did actually necessitate such drastic measures# Communications with Muscat are very slow and it takes at the shortest three weecs to get a reply from there, and by this time it was the end of I arch and I left for Delhi on a visit to the Government of India# I had submitted a report regarding the reductions in the • # # if ' -4- ' the Levy budget to the Government of India-vide despatch •0«99~ ** dated the 5th March 193!• I had however made no official report of this further request of the Council to the government of India, since the piece**meal figures supplied to me gave me no material for doing so, but I discussed the matter verbally with the Government of India and was given to understand that my action was generally approved, though a further cut was deprecated# 6. Further, while at Delhi 9 the question arose of a successor for Captain Walker, the Comr/iandant of the Levy Corps# Captain walker was frnxious to proceed on leave without delay and difficulties were experienced in obtaining a successor for him. I therefore suggested that with a view to still further assisting the finances of the state, the post of Commandant should be left vacant for 4 months* during the sumaer the men are given furlough and the Commandant normally proceeds on recess to India for about 2 months and, in the special cireumstances of the case, I considered it feasible that the post should be left vacant for 4 months. This would effect a further econocy of Rs.SOOO, making Rs. 17,000 in all as against the Rs*21,000 originally aaked for by Mr. Hedgoock. On ay way back from Karachi to Bushire I received a telegram f^om the Political Agent informing me that Mr. Hedgeock bad resigned his appointment, though, as reported in my tele gram referred to above, he has subsequently agreed to postpone a definite decision in the matter for a month. I now come to Mr. Kedgcock's letter of the 10th April to the Political Agent and to his letter of resigna- tion addressed to the »re»ident of the Council. I can only say that I consider these two documents extremely unf or tunately ..•.''7 • 5* unfortunaoely worded. Mr. Hedgcock states that the only reasons .iven oo him for not sanctioning the full reduction in pay demanded by him were sentimental ones. The reasons have been given above and cannot be so described. He refers to the second cut promised by me} as stated above I never promised a second cut. I merely said that, if the financial position towards the end of the year showed it to be absolutely necessary, 1 would give further economies ray consideration* In the latter latter Mr. Hedgeock refers to the divergence of opinion between the Government of India and himself; this should, of course, be the Political Resident and himself. «/hen I went to Muscat Mr. Hedgcock had been there one month and mpny of his figures were obviously provisional; since then I have been endeavouring to get figures out of him in support of his various contentions, but as Major i 1 owle states, he has only produced them in piece«meal form, which conveyed nothing, and it is only with considerable difficulty that Major Fowle has at length succeeded in obtaining from him some sort of revised budget estimate. 8. I think Mr. Hedgeock's reference to the Government of India, in his letter to the President of the Council, is most unfortunate. It is hrrdly calculated to improve the relations subsisting between Government and the State, who will naturally draw the conclusion that the financial woes from which they suffer are entirely due to the hard-hearted- ness and lack of sympathy of the British authorities whereas, of course, the exact reverse is the case, and no state owes more to the British Government at the present moment than the ) state of Oman* 9. As stated above, Mr. Hedgcock demanded a cut of Hs.21,000, and has been given economies amounting, during the current ...and totally faila to recognise that he has been met, in my opinion, most liberally and syrapathetically, '| J ■ -6- year, to at least 8.17,000. He aaks however not merely that the economy should amount to a certain figure shoula be efxected in the particular way that he prescribes far 0 1 10, tJ:le penultimate paragraph of his letter Mr. a iledgcock refers to his disagreement with the apparent policy of the government of India on more fundamental issues. What these iundamental issues are I have not the least knowledge, unless it oe that the Muscat otate should be absolute master in its Ovvn house and should be at liberty to abolish or reduce the Levy Corps as it thinks fit. If this is correct, txie answer is that the Muscat State looks to the British government to defend it from external enemies, and as long as this is tne case, the British Government have a reasonable right to ask that the state should maintain such a force as will enable it to deal, at any rate, with minor troubles. having obtained his demands in toto, Mr. Hedgcock has apparently adopted what I can only describe as an attitude of sulkiness and has made little or no further attempt to improve the resources of the state, when I was in Muscat he laid great stress on the fact that he hoped to obtain largely increased revenues from the rich date-producing Batineh coast. The control of this coast had for many years past been in the hands of one Saiyid Hamid, a brother of the Sultan, who had paid less and less revenues into the central treasury till during the last year he only remitted Rs.lSOO. Saiyid Hamid had further adopted a most contumacious attitude towards the Council, and had refused to acknowledge their authority. Mr. Hedgcock infomed me that he thought the revenue obtainable from this district should amount to about Hs.30,000**• 7 » S..50.000. f.t ll,„h, Myu teM.tt. l 1 .ir-pp. r „,, pr.o S «.d t0 Sobar .it,. „ .. c „ t . r the ^ ^aiyiu larnid, thereby asserting the authority of uric xhen, surely, was the time for Mr, Hedgeock to procea t „ S 0h . r t0 s;l „ lne ^ r .„ s|u|l&lt;j the finaiiijes that district, but it will be seen from iiaj or Powle's letter that he declines to do so and talks vaguely of proceed ing there In the autumn. Similarly it will be seen that he refused to accompany the Political Agent to Gwadur although the latser offered to arrange a passage for him in a sloop. 12. Jhen 1 was in Muscat, Mr. Hedgeock informed me that he was urgin^ on Saiyid aald the desirability of making cuus in the family allowances, but apparently owing to the fact that the pay of the leries has not been reduced to the extent that Mr. hedgcock demanded this idea has been given up, and doubtless now that he has been informed by his financial adviser that the woes of the state are due to the unsympathetic attitude of the Government of India, Saiyid Said will not take any steps to introduce such unpopular measures* 1 consider Mr, Hedgcock's conduct has heen deplor able. I have done n^y best to assist him and have, I consider, met him more than half way, but he has totally failed to re cognise the fact and has done his best to make relations between the Government of India and the State as difficult as possible. I consider that by his conduct he has shown himself tempera mentally unfitted for the appointment# It is essential that the appointment should be held by an officer with an equable temperament, with a reasonable spirit of give and take and, finally, with considerable tact. In all these qualities Mr# Hedgeock seems to be lacking. I therefore recommend that I should be authorised to advise the Council to accept his resignation. |. j h .

He has travelled extensively through the whole area within which the writ of Muscat runs, and knows the country and the people, and has also a thorough knowledge of the system of administra* tion. Further, he is an officer of exceptional zeal and energy, 15* I consider it undesirable in principle that the Political Agent should combine the duties of Financial Adviser f though, j . believe, that in practice, when Mr.Wlngate was Political Agent there, he did exercise a very large measure of financial control. I propose therefore, subject to the approval of the Government of India, to inform the Council that it will not be possible to find a Financial Adviser at ♦»e, but that Captain Alban, whom they already know well, will assist them with his advice while acting as Political Agent# In the autumn when Saj or J^owle resumes the pppointment of Political Agent I would recommend that Captain Alban should be appointed Financial Adviser and should also as a trial measure, at any rate, command the levies# A» stated above he has exceptional qualifications for these posts and has already combined these two functions for more than a year, and I am convinced that he will perform the work efficiently and with great keenness and zeal and, ii any one can restore the state 1 to a condition of solvency, I am confident that it is he. , .

I would therefore solicit orders by telegram. 18. His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India. * tfe.

' ^ April i8th, i931. Dear Mr. Howell, I regret to have to tell you that I tendered my resignation last week; the letters giving my reasons will doubtless reach you in due course through the official channels. I have no other post to go to, so you will appreciate that I have not taken the step li^iitly* If I had not been enveloped in a fog of official secrecy, knowing little or nothing of what was going on, X might have acted differently. o me, as financial adviser, the main issue at stake is Muscat's solvency; the chief concern of tne Gull autiiorities seems to be the minimum which can be contributed towards retrenchment by the Muscat Iniantry. ^very device has been used to protect the Levy budget, including cooked 1 inures and the employment of the Consular treasury staff on the preparation of formidable but inaccurate ,l man-day ,, tables! Muscats daily increasing indebtedness is ignored in the interest attaching to the military versus civilian contest. I resigned in order to bring things out into the open, and to see exactly where X stood. Before receipt of the letter giving my reasons, „ ' * '■ Colonel Biscoe accepted, or advised the Council to accept, my resignation; X am not sure which, as his telegram has not been shown to me. The Council» after a private interview with the P. A. f made it clear that they associated them selves with the present financial policy# and have asked me to reconsider my resignation. This is one point oleajf* up. The Council are not being driven by me to accept an unwelcome ed- 2 - unwelcome policy&gt; and the issue is one between them and the P#H« • not a personal one between Colonel Biscoe and jnyseli $ as 1 sometiiiies tnink it is considered here* His remark to me, that I ought to 'be very pleased with myself for having knocked Ha.^2,000 (owing to mistakes in the budget he handed me, the figure boiled down to Rs,4, off the budget of his ^favourite child% seemed to me to put the whole question on the wrong plane, as you know from my x irst letter, I was most anxious to avoid coming into conflict with a man so much my senior, and I told you that I proposed to lie low until my official position was more clearly deiined# This has proved impossible* Inactivity might have saved my own skin, but it did not prevent the Stated debts from steadily accumulating. Xhe next point that requires clearing up, is whether the Gulf authorities attach more importance to Muscat's solvency or to the Muscat Infantry. 1 have discussed three or four different finan- cial prograiumes with the Council, which has eventually adopted that of a graduated all-round pay reduction, the best-paid departments contributing the larger percentage? this to be coupled with a moderate increase in taxation, exclusive if possible of enhanced taxes on the food of the poor. This seems to me a sensible, moderate, and equitable programme, and one financially sound. The Council have accordingly authorized me to make an all-round cut in pay (Customs 1C$, Provincial Administration 7-^ etc.) provided that they can obtain the sanction of the Government of India to a 16$ reduction on the average Levy expenditure for the last two years, this to include a 12^ cut in the very high pay of the rank and file. The above scheme would at once enable Muscat to begin paying its way. If a3 - r If a cut is irapossible, the Council suggested {on March .12th) an alternative: a reduction of 22t% on the average expenditure of the last two years, free of any stipulation as to pay reduction# I have told .iOsvle Uiv-1 i„ this entails a reduction in the nunioers of the force, X will undertake to press the Council to recruit up to the sanctioned strength in the autumn, if the financial situation is by then sufficiently improved. might adopt; to explain why either of the above alterna tives cannot be accepted, I cannot very well tell the Council that the P.H. does nt;)t agree to the cut of because he H has a soft corner in his heart for the sepoy 1 , which was the reason given me on February 17th and not modified or amplified since. Previous to that, in the latter part of January, the Commandant had raised but not strongly pressed the possibility of the reduction in pay causing discontent; neither the Council nor J'owle upheld this objection.

If Saiyid Said takes a rest now at some cool spot the doctors, from what they tell me, can practically guarantee a cure.

Simla, 21st May 1931. /u^ I was on the point of writing to you to wish you success during your tenure of the Gulf Residency when your letter of the 18th May came, I am not altogether surprised that you found some of the remarks in Hedgcock's letter rather difficult to digest, 'but I do not think that you need take them too seriously. He perhaps permitted himself more liberty in writing to me than he would have done but for past official connection. It v/as I who recruited him for the Mesopotomian Political as long ago as 1916 and he served under me in that country for three years or more. He is a man with many good qualities^but has obviously I agree^taken the wrong turning in Muscat. I do not think that any good is likely to come from his remaining in his present appointment and the sooner he carries out his expressed intention of resigning perhaps the better. I do not remember whether it was in the letter of which a copy was sent to you or in another, but somewhere he certainly stated that he had always maintained friendly personal relations with you and v/as under considerable obligation to you for helping him in a variety of ways.I should perhaps explain that the corres pondence between Eedgcock and myself was initiated hy me. When I heard that Humphrys had put his name forward for the Ivluscat appointment I wrote to him expressing pleasure at the renewal of official relations and giving him some advice. I do not think that there was any harm at all in what I said, and if you would like to do so, I will send the correspondence for you to read. But it did encourage Hedgcock rather to pour out his woes to me and in so doing he developed a tendency to go behind the hacks of the local officers which of course was the last thing in the world that I desired.

I hare long ago come to the conclusion that close and prolonged contact with Arabs induces in many Europeans a wholly abnormal state of mind which is frequently difficult to cope with# They seldom seem to be able to look at a matter dispassionately and as an ordinary administrative question, and Hedgcoc^s references to the levies as 41 my favourite child* 1 and his statement that I said that ' I had a soft spot in my heart for the sepoy f etc• ,, would seem to show that he imagines that in such matters I am ruled rather by the heart than by the head, a failing to which I do not plead guilty. However 1 do not think it is necessary to take any further notice of such ridiculous contentions, and the real reason wi^r Hedgeock must go is because, as stated in my tele^r&amp;m, he has told the State that they are in the right and the Government of India in the wrong, and as long as he remains relations will be impossible# Xhis view naturally * ^nds much favour with Saiyid Said, who while not shaping badly on the whole is still rather a 'spoilt child', and it is always • • • • .Howell .Eaq. ,C.3.I. t C,I.S., 'WQign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. muf ■ i II jelwayB agreeable to be tola that one's trouble s are due to other people.

This would have the following advantages: it would effect a real econocqy at a time when it is urgently necessary. The Financial Adviser would have a force at his disposal to enforce his orders* to accompany him on tour and to maintain the prestige of the State* Alban tells me that when Thomas first went there he frequently asked the Levy for escorts, etc* but the Officer Commanding,Levies, often made difficulties on the score of interference with training*etc* vhen Alban held both posts, on the other hand, he took detachments of the levies with him and found them a very effective means of dealing with individuals who were trying to avoid payment of taxes, etc* Again, the levies are undoubtedly a sore point with the state authorities and Hedgoock's recent action is calculated to make them more so* Xf however they saw that the levies were not kept as ^ purely military force to guard against a possible attack on Mutt rah, but were also being employed to maintain the authority of the State and to bring in revenue, think it would undoubtedly go very far to reconcile anyone to their as Financial Adviser* firstly, he would start with the existence **existence and to their cost, Moreover I am most anxious to nicij.ee ■a&amp;be rab utates stand on their own legs as much as possible, and have been urging Ssiyid ii&amp;id to strengthen the Muscat Councili am I think that if the levies were used as suggested above, it would do much to enhance the prestige of the State and strengthen their hands.
