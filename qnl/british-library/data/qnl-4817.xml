As you will see, we have turned down the request made by General Kwei, and we propose, after consulting War Office, to do likewise in the case of that made by General Yu. You will see that General Yu asked our Military Attache at Nanking about the possibility of. obtaining surplus war material from India (Nanking telegram No. 647» paragraph 3)- In view of the possibility of the Chinese Government making a direct approach to Government of India, I suggest that, if you see no objection, the story might be telegraphed to the Government of India for their secret information, so that they may be warned in advance of any such approach.

SECRET a a a a GUERD General Kwei Yung-Ching formerly Head of Chinese Military Mission in Berlin has approached General Sir A. Carton de Y/iart on the instructions of Chiang Kai-shek with a request for the assistance of His Majesty's Government in obtaining certain^ war material. .General Carton de Y/iart brought him to see me this morning. 2, General Kwei after expatiating on the political situation of the World and the inevitability of an eventual clash between the Soviet Union and the democratic powers, emphasised the vital necessity of attaining Chinese unity and consequently of the Central Government defeating the Communist .troops m China in the shortest possible space of time. He confirmed that in these circumstances Chiang Kai—shelc had charged him personally to approach us in the greatest secrecy and ask for our help. 3. The position was he said, that with economy, the Central Governments forces had enough munitions to last them for a year and a half. But if they required to make an all-out effort, such as now was necessary, they must acquire further stocks, ihey had approached the United States authorities for supplies of ammunition for 150,000 limerican^rifles in use in Chinese army but had met with continual delays and postponements on various pretexts. In answer to a question put to him at this juncture he affirmed that the Central Government had evidence of direct^supply to the Communists by the Soviet Union of Russian and German war material. 4 e At this point General Kwei made a digression on the” thane of the superior knowledge and ilustcr appreciation of the world situation on the part of Great Britain as compared with the United States of Rmerica and the greater ability of the former to main a the necessary secrecy in important and delicate matters.Qi 5&lt; Hq wont on to ask whether it would be possible for His Majesty’s Goyernnent to supply nunitions from ex-Gernan.stocks in British zone of occupation in Germany. The Gain need was snail am amunition (7*9) of which they required at least 6,000, nil lion rounds. They would also like certain quantities of rifles and machine guns particularly if they were forced through lack of ammunition to store their United States rifles. In such a case they would require more 7*9 ammunition than the quantity mentioned * above. He explained that it would serve no useful purpose to be more explicit about the exact needs of the Chinese Government until they know whether His Majesty’s Government were in a position to [gp. omitted] then as suggested when all necessary information would of course .be forthcoming* 6, . I undertook to |)ass Chiang Kai-shek’s request on to you and to emphasise its secrecy. I told General Kwei that he naturally could not expect me to comment on it as it obviously raised wide political issues which could only bo weighed up in London, 7. Prom a local point of view this approach is interesting on two counts. It shows (a) That the Central Government have completely abandoned any idea of reaching a compromise with the Communists and are only paying lip service to American efforts to halt civil war; and (b) That the United States authorities are in fact cutting down supplies of war material in an attempt to ensure that the Central Government will be more amenable.

They felt that Chinese Government had been.exploiting them ana had not acted straight over negotiations with the Communists. General Marshall had therefore been authorised to return whenever he felt he ought.

Military attache was] asked to call on General Yn Ta Wei on October 16th. I presume General Your telegram No.910 (not repeated to Washington and Moscow). —r— Yu is nov/Minister of Communications but continues to handle high level ord/nance policy and is Government nominee on General Marshal's Three-Man Committee for negotiation of military settlement with the Communists. 2. The object was to enquire about the availability of 7.92 m.m. ammunition from British sources and it became clear that General Yu is informed of General Kwei's earlier approach. General Yu stressed the Government’s duty to provide a satisfactory standard of internal security and, by implication, obligation upon friendly Governments to assist. Dealing with the obvious ’’political” difficulties of His Majesty’s Government in supplying war material in the present circumstances the General endeavoured to suggest that specific demands for small quantities ’’for security [gp. undec. ?reasons]” might be considered without prejudice to international issues. He insisted that the Government's policy was not (repeat not) to destroy Communist forces but to ensure the maintenance of their own forces in sufficient strength to neutralise any threat to internal security due to Communist intransigeance. 5. Having found the Military attache cautious in his replies, General Yu enquired whether there was any liklihood of surplus material being made available from India by the new Government there. It is clear that a cfirect approach to New Delhi is not now excluded, your telegram under reference reaching me after the above conversation and action upon it may increase the probability of such a direct approach. Meanwhile Communist propaganda is accusing the Government of trying to obtain American war material ’’under the counter” from South AmericanAmerican sources: and it is clear that, faced with the known existence of considerable stocks of Japanese eras in Communist hands, with their own difficulties in obtaining deliveries and with the fear that Communist’ stocks m r y be replenished from Soviet sources, the. Government will explore every channel to increase their own reserves to avoid the unpleasant possibility that Communist supply position will become better than their own. 4. I shall speak to General Kwei as instructed in your telegram under reference but the Military Attache is not (repeat not) reporting his*conversation direct to the War Office and will require instructions about his reply to General Yu particularly on the point whether small quantities cannot .be made available without .’’political” implications. I presume that in view of the wording of paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference that Military Attache’s reply should be negative, but would be grateful for confirmation.

General Kwei has been away and His Majesty’s Rnbassodor was unable to see hm before he left this morning for Peking. I have now given the General your message which he accepted philosophically and indeed seened to expect. He added in any case the situation had changed since his approach to General Carton de Wiart and government was now confident that if the Communists would not cone to negotiate agreement, two to three months would see the end of their danger as military force. 2. I ventured to 'wonder whether the General was not over optimistic: what about guerilla warfare on an Important scale? The General replied guerillas needed peasant support and the Government had round the people m reoccupied areas disillusioned and longing for'peace at any price. 3. General Kwei also said that he had reason to believe that the present American attitude of refusing military supplies would soon be reversed. 4. I pass the above on for what it may be worth as, surprising as it seems to us here, General Kwei does have access to the highest quarters. It would appear from my telegram No.647 that General Yu Ta Yei does not share General Kwei’s optimism.6360 &lt;V3 2 TSLSStA^j froa tiw oecretar’ of Jtate for Dominion Affair; V to tho Prim luinister of t te Cosmnonwealth of Australia.

(Sent 9.0 p.m.* 12th April, 1932.) Important. No.27. Secret. Your telegram 12bh April No.42 Secret. Position in this country is that export of arms to China is subject to licence by the Board of Trade which is only granted if corresponding import 1 licence has been issued by Chinese Government (see my telegram Circular B No.122 of 8th August 1930). It has not been found practicable to impose aiy further restriction and the present dispute between China aid Japan, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, increases rather than diminishes the difficulty of doing so, since strict impartiality between the two disputants would necessitate the application of any embargo to both countries. Owing to the greater ease with which Japan can manufacture arms, such epplication might arouse ccmplaints from China that it in fact operated in favour of Japan. Moreover past experience has shown the extreme difficulty of imposing any effective check on the flow of arms into China, even when there is an express agreement between the countries concerned to prohibit their nationals from supplying arms to China such as the China Arms Embargo Agreement w iich was abrogated in 1929. the above considerations however apply to the sale of arms from private sources. As regards Government owned arms our view has been that though there is no legal state of war between Chinaand Japan situation eo far resembles a state of war that transactions which would be incompatible with the duties of a neutral in a legal atata of war would be ©pen to criticism. Government owned arms i\ this country are therefore not being sold to either Chinese or Japanese Governments or to any dealers if it is known that ther are required for resale to either Government.PZ. 1212 932 J (F a&gt;jl/57/10) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.V .1. 29th January, 193ii 0 Sir, I an directed by Secretary Sir Joim Simou to refer to your letter No. 6260/lo of the 19th January regarding a recent enquiry from the Canadian Governiuent in connexion with the export of arms to China. 2. I am to suggest that the Uanaui^u Government should oe informed in reply of the practice of his Majesty ^ s Government in the United kingdom in this natter. Licences are granted for the export of arms to China from the United kingdom provided that corresponding import licences have been issued by the Chinese Government. This limited restriction is based on a policy of friendliness to the recognised Government of China and of refraining from affording assistance to reuel factions. The present dispute between China and Japan, in the view of His Majesty's Government in tne United kingdom, increases rather than diminishes the difficulty of tailing any more drastic steps, since strict impartiality between the two disputants would necessitate the application of any embargo to both countries and, owing to tne greater ease with which Japan can manufacture arms, an embargo upon the export of arms to both Japan and China might arouse complaints from the Chinese that in fact it operated in favour of Japan. L. Apart from these considerations connected with the present /Manchurian Under-Secretary of State, Tne Dominions Office.Manchurian dispute, past experience has shown the extrexue difficulty of imposing any effective chec^c upon the flow of arm. 0 into China, even when, as in the case of the embargo upon the export of arms to China which was abrogated in 191^, there is an express agreement between the countries principally concerned to prohibit the supply of arms to China by their nationals. His majesty's Government in tne United kingdom consequently doubt the desirability of attempting any such measures at the present time, whatever mifcht be the advantages to the cause of civil peace in China of a general cessation of the v ipphy of arms to that country.D.O. 3.
