The only local facilities sought are (1) a quantity of fresh fish, to which there is no objection, and (2) bunkering at the Sitrah Terminal, which was arranged to commence at 4.30.p.m. this afternoon; and in this connection the Master produced to me a telegram from the Senior Naval Authority in Bombay to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, which gave permission for such ’bunkering. Consequently the position appeared to be in order; and, with your approval, I suggest thatJno action need be taketo. I had previously seen Mr Ward Anderson of the Bahrein Petroleum Coy Ltd., and I advised him that oil prod xts for bunkers being technically an export, it would be well to apply to you for an Export Permit to cover same, similarly as in the case of the actual quantities exported in tankships; and, in any case, this point would later be confirmed.

Dear Sir, When the S/S 'CAPTAIN A.P. LUCAS' arrived in this port, the Master stated that, in accordance with the orders of the Naval Officer in Charge at Juffair, he reported to the Contraband Control Officer at Men on March 21, 1941. This Officer took possession of and gave a receipt for the ship’s Crew List, Sxport Permit, Bill of Lading, and the Ship’s Warrant , taking all of these documents ashore with him. Later, in accordance with local orders, the Master of the ship sailed on schedule time in a north bound Red Sea Convoy without having these documents returned to him. On arrival at Port Said, the Master appeared before the British Consul, exhibited his receipt for the documents, and received in return a certificate (carbon copy attached), certifying that it appears to His Majesty’s Consul at Port Said that the Ship’s //arrant is in the possession of the British Contraband authorities in Aden. The Master of the 'CAPTAIN A.F. LUCAS' further stated that His Majesty’s Consul at Port Said wired to Aden for an explanation, and was informed that they regretted the error, but did not wish to forward the document to Suez by air mail, as requested. The Marine Department of the California Texas Oil Co.,Ltd., representing the owners of the vessel, has asked that I take up this matter with you, requesting the issue of a new Ship’s Warrant, after satisfying yourself, if necessary, that the above statements are correct. It is obvious that the ship is not at fault in this case, and her sailings should not be delayed owing to the absence of a document which is improperly in the possession of His Majesty’s authorities.
