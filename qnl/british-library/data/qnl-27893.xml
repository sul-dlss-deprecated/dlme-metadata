I am to suggest that if Mr. Montagu sees no .'J ’ objection, the Political Resident at Aden should be instructed to take action on the lines suggested by Sir R. Wingate. I am.

(See Sir R. Wingate’s telegram of 25th May, flagged) . As regards the Idrisi, the Resident at Aden was consulted on the 2T5rd June as to the practicability of acting on the Sherif’s suggestion. Hfjfreplied on the 24th June, proposing to take advantage oi the forthcoming visit to Arabia - in connection with Sherif- Idrisi relations - of an Egyptian Kinsman of the Idrisi (Syed Mustapha-el-Idrisi) to depute Major Reilly to accompany the latter to Jeizan, with a view to obtaining the desired 'recognition' from the Idrisi. Mustapha has now arrived at Aden en route for Jeizan, and, after discussing the question with him, the Resident does not consider the moment , favourable for raising the 'recognition' question with the Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate takes the same view, which must presumably be accepted.(P.) 40o A.P. Your telegram June 23rd and my telegram 395 A.P. June 24th• I have interviewed Muataffa-al-Idrisi. He strongly advises that on his present, visit to larisi he should be concerned only with persuading lurisi oo agreeing to nis paying Sheriff a friendly vidj.w and that no LjuBouioxi of recognizing Sheriff as 'Leader of Arab movement” be raised. That this question is premature and might wreck any friendly xeninaxfcx overtures. I thoroughly agree. On occasion of this visit I am impressing on llustaffa that there is no iciea oi any settlement of territorial boundaries which must await end of war, that our idea is solely to establish friendly relations in Arab interest against Turk. Mustaffa is of opinion that Kunfida is main obstacle to such relations.

In the meantime I shall make a further attempt to induce Shereef to take initiative in writing friendly letter to Idrisi deploring coolness of their relations and suggesting formal meeting of Delegates from either party at Mecca or Jeiza* It should be main purpose of Mu stall'd’s subsequent visit to Mecca to arrange for this meeting and we should then communicate to both Shereef and Idrisi our anxiety that this meeting shall result in a per manent Understanding and agreement between two chiefs and formal recognition by Idrisi of special position of Shereef in movement for Arabian independence.

To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 20th May 1015. My Lord Marquess, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 17th Febru ary 1915, have the honour to forward, for the consideration of His Majesty’s : ' ’ Government, a copy of a letter* from • No. c. 343 , dated the i.t May 1915. our Political Resident at Aden, with which he submits a Treaty signed by himself and by the representatives of the Idrisi Saiyid, for the ratification of the Government of India. 2. This Treaty does not appear to have been very concisely or very clearlv drafted, but the terms generally coincide with what Your Lordship approved in your telegram of the 28th December 1911. The Idrisi, on his side, undertakes to make a pact of friendship between himself and the British Government, to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to extend his territories at their expense, and at the same time to abstain from any hostile or provocative action against the Imam Yahva so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. The British Government, on their side, undertake to protect his territories from attack on the seaboard, to guarantee his independence in his own domain, and at the conclusion of the war to use diplomatic means to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the Imam. Further, they have no desire to enlarge their territories on Arabian soil but wish merely to see that the various Arab rulers live peaceably and amicably together, each in his own sphere. As a mark of appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the British Government have aided him with funds and munitions and undertake to give him further assistance in the prosecution of his campaign against the Turks, in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities. Finally, the British Government agree as heretofore to give the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden. 3. The only point that appears to require definite qualification is the expression “Arabian soil” in Article 6, as this scarcely falls in with our position in Mesopotamia. If the words “ Western Arabia ” were substituted for “ Arabian soil,” this objection would be removed and our intentions would be sufficiently defined in the Treaty. 4. It might also perhaps be urged that by allowing the Idrisi under Article 3 to extend his territories and at the same time under Article 5 guaranteeing his independence hereafter, we may be bringing ourselves into an embarrassing2 in position vis-a-vis other Arab Chiefs, hut our position in this matter is safe guarded by the condition that the extension of the Idrisi’s territories should be at.the expense of the Turks, and should he hereafter involve himself in a collision with otlier Arab Chiefs by an aggressive policy, we could point to this condition and disavow his action. r , it might have been desirable to insert a clause givinsr British and British Indian traders free access to the IdrisBs ports, but this might legitimately be held to be a corollary of the pact of friendship which it is the object of the Treaty to consolidate. 6. As any further assistance in funds or munitions to the Idrisi is explicitly to be in accordance with the measure of the IdrisBs activities, our responsibilities in this matter would appear to be sufficiently safeguarded. , . We tlnnk » therefore, that, although the Treaty as drafted is open to objection on the ground that it is neither very clear nor very concise, it will, if the small amendment suggested in paragraph 3 above be effected, adequately meet the requirements of the situation. We would ask, therefore, for authority to ratify it as it stands subject to this qualification. To return it for extensive revision to our Political Resident would be to endanger the ultimate success of the negotiations, and would, at any rate, involve undesirable delay. If Your -Lordship agrees, we should be glad of orders by telegraph. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE of PENSHURST. „ BEAUCHAMP DUEF. „ R. W. CARLYLE. „ S. A. IMAM. j&gt; W. H. CLARK. „ R. H.

Shaw, Political Resident, Aden, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. In sending you by this mail three copies of the Treaty signed by me and the Idrisi Saiyid for the ratification of the Government of India, I have the honour to state that the Idrisi representatives will leave to-morrow for their country. They appear to mean business. 2. There is little left to be said. Paragraph 5 is the most important one, and is in accord with the cipher instructions received from you. 3. Paragraph 7. The precise details of assistance in funds and munition is expressly omitted at the request of Saiyid Mustafa and is done to avoid wounding Arab susceptibilities. A receipt in full for assistance given has however been obtained. The concluding portion of this paragraph is very essential. Having begun a good work with so important a Chief, and one so inimical to everything Turkish, it will be necessary to prosecute the matter a entrance, but I was careful to insert the last nine words of the paragraph as showing the quid pro quo for which the Idrisi is responsible. 4. I would request that two ratified copies of the Treaty may be returned to me, one to be given to the Idrisi and the other for this office records. This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General D. G. L Shaw, the Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the British Government and by Saivid Mustafa bin Saiyid Abdu’l ’All on the part of His Eminence Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idris the Idrisi Saiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments. 2. Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship between the British Government and the Idrisi Sajyid, abovementioned, and his Tribesmen. 3 The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations in the Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemen and to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks. 4. The Saiyid’s prime objective will be against the Turks only, and he will abstain from any hostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya so long as the latter does not join hands with the Turks. 5 The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid’s territories from all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him ; to guarantee his independence in his own domain and at the conclusion of the war to use every diplomatic moans in its power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya or any other rival. 6. The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders on Arabian soil but wishes solely to see the various Arab rulers living peacefu y and amicably together each in his own sphere, and all in friendship with the British Government. 7. As a mark of its appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saivid, the British Government has aided him with both funds and munitions and will continue to assist him in the prosecution of the war so long as it lasts in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi’s activities.^ 8. Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the Red Sea, ihe British Government has for some months past been giving the Idrisi Saivid full and free scope to trade and traffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government, in token of the friendship existin g will continue uninterruptedly to maintain. \ fl2 9.

Dear Mr. Bell, Sir Percy Cox has called attention to an article in the Near Past of 5th January 'from a correspondent' dated Cairo, December 12th in which it is stated that Ibn Saud has acknowledged the Shereef of Mecca as 'King of the Arabs'. This statement is not accurate, and similar statements may give rise to misunderstandings. The Secretary of State therefore desires me to tell you that the only title of King Husain that has been recognised by His Majesty’s Government is 'King oi the Hedjaz' (with courtesy title of 'His Lordship'), and to- ask you to be kind enough to see that he is not described otherwise in the Near East .

Reference to Aden's telegram 326 A.P. of February 17th. If Idriai readily accepts proposed interchange of informal visits we see no objection but if he demurs we think that it would be a mistake to press him into negotiations with Sheriff. In his present mood this might lead to definite rupture with Sheriff which would be more embarrassing than his present coolness. Sheriff has little to gain by more active co-operation on Idrisi's par^ and Idrisi would only accord this in return for concessions whicn Sheriff is not likely to agree to.- Addressed to the Secretary of State and repeated to Cairo, Aden.J 1 '•&gt; fu 9^. i Tolegram from Political Resident, Aden*|^ i ^ j / 745 Dated 17th February,1917 X 0 © Mustapha should pay an informal Tisit to Shereef at Mecca and subsequently proceed with a suitable representatixe of Shereef to interriew Idrisi* I am communicating imnediately with Idrisi but no ship available to take officer and letter till Tuesday, 20th instant, there may be some delay before I can telegraph result • Idrisi is still in a very difficult frame of mind consequent on Kunfida and Farsan incidents.

I propose therefore we should take advantage of pr,rence of Said Mustaffa-al-Idrisi at Cairo and try to induce him to pay an informal visit to Mecca when he could interview Shereef and if nos-ible Proceed with a suitable representative of Shereef to Idrisi.

Please see my two recent telegrams regarding the comprehensive title arrogated to himself by Sherif. I have received since a copy of 'Near East' newspaper containing an article dated Cairo, January 5th 'From a corresoondent' m which it is stated inter alia Ibn Saud unreservedly acknowledged Sheriff as King of Arabs. I naturally find it difficult to understand how such a misleading statement can have been allowed to pass uncensored, especially into a London newspaper of status of Hear East. Action of Sherif and his friends is putting His -Majesty's Government and its spokesman here in a very false position vis a vis Ibn Saud and must be expected to excite distrust in latter’s min* not only in Sherif but in ourselves. I trust His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to ascertain who is responsible for statement in 'Hear East' and to authorise me to inform Ibn Saud specifically on their behalf that above comprehensive title has not been recognized by Allied Powers and that in any case he may rest assured that in view of his treaty with us it has no significance in regard •bo himself.

A number of letters have arrived for myself and Sheikh of Mohammerah from Bin Sand, bearing dates from 24th December to loth January, including text of Arabic telegram forShereef advised in my telegram T/185, 28th December. . , , . , , , . Ibn Sand corroborates reports already received that he had been taken ill on his way home from Katif, but says he has sent his son and brother on to Qasim, and will be following in a day or two as soon ns he is hi to travel. He has not heard when he wrote of consent of (Government to comply with his requirements. His letters contain following items of interest: (1) He forwards in original letter addressed to his father (sic) by Giand Shereef on 15th November in which latter signed ^ King of Arabian countries.” In asking me to take note of signature he says he merely sends on letter to prove that he was justified in suspicions which he expressed. For the rest he says he relies on God and assurances given him by me on behalf of Government. , n , , , T , (2) He reports following:—A certain l^aiyid Mahomet Abdullah-al-Ulq, a native of Yemen, who was at Constantinople on outbreak of wai and thence tried to make his way to \emen, was detained at Medina. Aftei being theie a long time he appears to have got Shereef Haidar to allow him to leave on condition that he would deliver certain letters at Hail. Saiyid Mahomet agreed, but on leaving Medina avoided Hail and reached Qasim where Ibn Baud’s deputy detained him pending orders from his master. Ibn Sand sends me in original the three letters for Hail that Saiyid was carrying, and also a letter from Saiyid to himself. 1 he former were addressed respectively to Ibn Bashid, Ibn Laila and one Saiyid Zaid Beg, apparently an agent of Shereef Haidar with Ibn bashid. 'The first two letters merely asked recipients to assist Saiyid in his journey. The third letter, which was evidently the important one, directed addressee chat if he considered Ibn Rashid was likely to delay much longer m making a move towards Medina he was to come away without him, but without giving offence. The Saiyid’s letter to Ibn Sand explains circumstances of his departure from Medina. He then writes that Turks now realise Ibn Sand’s importance, and greatly regret having alienated him 1 hey attribute Shereef’s defection to that fact and find that Ibn Rash id is a broken reed and of no use to them. They would now “ give bn Baud hall they possessed ” to win him back. He has only to say what he wants and he will cr e t it at once. Writer, however, reminds Ibn Sand how Turks have deceived the Arabs generally, and hints that Ibn Baud will noi be t? an exception). In conclusion he repeats desire for personal meeting as he has matters to explain. The foregoing seem to suggest that Saiyid had a mission to Ibn Baud. If so he maylae connected with a mission recently reported to have been sent from Medina with object of protesting to Ibn Baud against seizure of Ibn Faroon’s camels. There is, however, nothing specifically stated in letters on this point.ry 5 * 1917 To no on© wtifll th.© t.ion ed^eWher© b© raoi t;h© n©w King of tftw Sbereef of Mecca has Great Britain, Fran assumption of it.

U. Stewart, % Political Reeident 9 Aden« A« C* We hare received your esteemed letter by the hand of Saiyid Yehla bin Abdurrahman one of the Mu~ tawwifa and it eo chanced that hie arrival synchronised HtLSki'tC with the advent of one of the great personages of the A- tribe* In the course of conversation the former asked the latter news of the son of Imam Yehia as to whether there was any foundation to the report of his taking possession of AL RAUDA, KHAMIR and AL TAWILA to which the Hashidl replied in the negative* He went on to say that the rumour regarding the quarrel between Imam Yehia and his son was the outcome of a family squabble and that the son had returned to his father and both are now at Ah SUDA* 2* We have read with deliberation the oopy of the letter addressed to you by Imam Yehia and it clear- ly proves the agreement concluded between the Turkish Government and him, which agreement the Turkish Govern ment are faithfully observing and to which they are closely bound in the most approved way. Consequwntly from a religious stand point the Imam is unable to finda way to ▼iolat# th# same* This indeed i net result of his reply. Now if he were really keen to find &amp; way to sever himself from the Turks, this had been an easy matter for him and God would hare pared his way. We will leave no stone unturned to effect this object if he is willing, as indeed is meet for us and every Arab Chief for union is the most useful asset we have. We have duly received your letter dated 18th Safar 1336 (13th December 1916) and are thank ful for your benevolent treatment of our gunners and our Wasir* s son. We hope that these gunners will soon return for they are badly wanted and action against the Turks is already on fdot but urgency is olearly indicated. May you be preserved*P 0/10 H. Mm &amp;. •LUNKA* At Sea,20th December 1916 Sir, I hare the honour to submit the following report* X arrived at Jeisan in H.M.S* •Lunka' on De cember 16th. Yehia Abdurrahman el Pilali arrived from Aden on the eame day in Cowaejee’e steamer with proclamation? and correepondenoe from the Sherif to the Imam. I saw Yehia Abdurrahman on the 17th; he reported that the important Haehid Sheikh, Maraud el Bargi ( from Barag, near Habur, wae in Jeu*an, together with Haesan, Yehia and Ali Huesein el Bargi, also Sheikh Abu Hilfa (from near Habur), Said Ahmed of Ahi® (on the Idrisi- Imam frontier), Yusuf Negib el Pugaha and Quda (near Ahim) and Hegib Haesan bin Hagi Hurrash (from near Suda) all these being Hashid Sheikhs. They had brought with them 200 men end letters from all the Hashid: and protested their devotion to God and the Said. They hoped for a reconcilia tion between the Idrisi and the Imam, and if the latter declined, would follow the Idrisi wherever he wished. A letter from Hasir Mabkhut with the same purport had been received by the Xdrisi, asking permission to visit the Idrisi and bring an army of 800 t 1000 or more: to which the Idrisi had replied, ”oome with 100 so that we may discuss matters.' Yehia also stated that two Bekil Sheikhs, Sheikh Salah Bekili and Sheikh Ibrahim of Boda were in Jeisan with 30 men, with similar letters from Bekil. Also Sheikhs Daoud and Yusuf bin All of Yam with 38 men asking for ammunition etc for an attack on Saada, Saif ul Islam, having left there and gone to the Imam at Suda. The Said had honoured these and given them robes and told them that he would consider the matter. Yehia also reported that some of the Beni Jfarwan andand Beni Abe were at Jeizan* It wae said that the trouble with Ali Thawwab had been patched up and that he and Basahi were expected &amp;£jeizan immediately* Yehia stated he had distributed the Sherif's proclamation and newspapers: but had kept silence about his letters for the Imam* On the evening o$ the 17th an interview took place between the Idrisi and Commanding Officer of ■Lunka* and myself* Asked if he had heard of any dissension between the Imam and his son 9 the Idrisi replied that the Hashid Sheikhs who had just arrived at Jeizan re ported that something of the sort had just taken place: but that the quarrel was a family matter and not caused by political reasons. Through the mediation of one of the Seyyids the two had now been reconciled* Sounded as to the possibility of an entente between himself and the Imam, he produced the copy of the Iman^s recent letter to the Resident, Aden* He laid particular stress on the phrase that the Imam was bound to the Turks by a bond of faith which he could not break, and while admitting that this was only an excuse ('for when I and he were killing the Turks together we did it in the mane of the ^aith** 1 ), he interpreted the phrase as a polite refusal. He did not think that the Imam* s interest was to abandon the Turks. The ZAIDXA were against him because he was pro-Turkish: the 8HAFEIA were against him because he was Zaidi: and the Turks Wre his only support* The Idrisi brushed aside as unlike ly the suggestion that the Imam wished to reverse his policy and rally the tribes to him against the Turks, but his reasoning struck me as vague* At the same time, should the Imam wish for an entente, tne Idrisi stated he would be perfectly willing to meet hie proposals. Hie (the Uriel's) terms would includeinclude the poesession of the coaet plain ae far as Hokha, including Hodeida and Zehid* In this area the t Iraan had no claims. He reiterated that statement that in Arabia, government depended on the consent of the governed: and that one single power could not uold tne Yemen. However, if this partition were agreed to, he had no objection to an entente. If the Imam chose the Abdali Sultan as the go-between, he would be prepared to accept him, but it was quite impossible for him(the Idrisi) to make the first move. He had been waiting inactive for three years, to give the Imam the opportu~ nity of making overtures: this had been in vain and he was now going to take the field. If the Imam cared to join in, well and good. But he,(the Idrisi) was going to aot whether he came in or not. He would attaek Loheiya as soon as the gunners at Aden had been sufficiently trained. After Loheiya had fallen he would consult with the British Government as to the direction in which he should proceed. He confirmed Sheikh Yehia Abdurrahman*s statement that the Barag and Ahim Hashid were now in Jeizan: and that Hasir Mabkhut had written and was expected. As to letters from the British Government to the Imam, he wmak did not wish them to pass through his territory. He said they mould just as easily bs sent from Aden, through the Abdali Sultan: and that his frontier with the Imam was always mors or Itss in a State of war, and the passage of messengers and letters might lead to complications. Throughout the interview he conveyed the impression that he felt himself jjjBfcXxxrasaxwicxmi to the recent overtures from Hashid and Bekil. Ths Idrisi mads no referencs either to the subsidising of Hashid and Bekil or to naval-coperation and as some weeks will probably elapss before his move-moTement begins, questions. © I judged it best not to raise these On the 18th Yehia Abdurrahman came on board and informed me, inter alia, that tae Idrlal wa» ahoe^ ing himself very adverse to his proceeding to the Imam, making every excuse on the score of danger on the road, etc. Yehia stated tnat the Idrisi had said that he did not wish to deXinitely forbid him to go ae that would affront Aden, and 'the people of the shipe', and lead to correspondence: but suggested that Yehia el culd etry 10 days or so in Zoizan and then return to Aden, saying that the state of roads made his journey impossible. H# asked me whether he should stay or return. As the refusal is not definite and Yehia thinks there is still a chance of his being able to proceed, I advised him to stay, to which he agreed. He is most anxious that no notice should be paid officially to the matter for the present, at any rate. ? There is no doubt that the Idrisi'e plea of danger on the road ate is merely an excuse: and the question arises why he should be so anxious to prevent \ all communication with the Imam. The reason suggsstsd ♦ by Yehia,which seems more than possible, ie that the Idrisi is very much afraid of an alliance between ue and the Imam. He realises that this allianct would msan an immediate end of the Turks in the Yemen,leaving him in solitary state and unable to resist our occupa* tion of the sea board should we so desire. As long as he ie the only accessible factor in Yemen, he thinks we shall continue to make overtures to him: but that if allied with the Imam, we should have no further use *£ \ for him. Yehia reports that no communications have passed between the Idrisi and the Sherif since the Kunfida episode, which is still rankling in the Idrises mindv^) f m ;n4, though he i» outwardly aoquieeoent. He, (Yehia), ha* apparently had private convereo- tion with Uasoud el Bargi of the Haohid, who told hi* that they had coae to Jeiaan as a result of the receipt jf a letter from the Idrisi, promising them pay from the /*government',which might mean either the 'heit el mal' or the f ritiah Government. If paid they are ‘.D' ■'■ &lt;■ to !{o anywhere - I fancy Yehi* used the opportunity to imprea* the* with the prestige of the Sherif and tho advantage* which he, with the aid of the British Govern- ’ ment had won against the Turks. Certain terms o. res- ment arc being raade between the Haehid and t e I could not discover what they were,except that the Hashid would not consent to give hostage#* On the 19th I heard that a letter had been re- tfc~ . ceived by the Idrisi from^Sheikh of Birk f stating that the Sherif*s representative at Kunfida had burned the town and retired from it* In view of the Idrisi 1 ® protratted inactivity, it is difficult to eee why he should so suddenly have de termined on an offensive against Loheiya,especially in view of the recent trouble with the Beni Abs* I would suggest that it might be a good thing to place an accredited Mohammedan agent of the Aden Govern ment at Jeizan, to keep closer touch with the Idrisi; or at any rate, to prooose such an appointment to the Idrisi and see how he takes the suggestion* I have etc*, (sd) L* J?\ Haider, Lieut* R*N.V,R* t The Political Resident, Adenf ^ 192 1917 From Yiccrou, Foreifjti Department, VMh Januari/ 11)17.

I am very happy to inform you that the Nobles and Ulemas of the country and all classes of the people having met to-day have unanimously recogniz ed His Majesty the Grand Sherif Hus sein Ben Aly King of the Arabian na tion. By this act His Majesty becomes the Sovereign of the Arabs through the fact that the country is endowed with his diplomatic capacity, his perfect loyalty towards his country and his sincere desire to spread the welfare of education and justice throughout the Arabian regions which have been de livered from the yoke of the band of Union and Progress. This band is re cognized by its gestures and aims con trary to all principle and law and by its formal resolution to bring about the ruin of the Arabian country both in the moral and material point of view. The effects of this latter resolution are ap parent by tortures suffered by a great number of Mussel mans, ChrisHans and Druses whose crimes are their sincere devotion to the country and their in tellectual capacity. The Arabian na tion has reason to hope that you will re cognize her as an active member of the society of nations and thus known she will prove it in the future with the support of the Almighty.

I have the honour to submit the following (l) As to the Kunfida situation.-* On Saturday 18th November I arrived at Kunfida from Port Sudan via Jedda in M CLIO M , which brought 2 15 pdrs and 2 maxims for Sherif Nasir together with some 20 Heccans as guns' crews commanded by Hussein Effendi Mousa, a Syrio-TurJc, fomerly Sergeant Major in the Turkish Artil lery and now acting as Second-Lieutenant under the Sheriff. Tne arrival of tnese guns has very considerably strengthened Nasir's position, but there seems no prospect of nis taking an immediate offensive against the Turks at Goz. He was to have moved out against them on 30th but the expedition was put off, according to Nasir owing to the h«avy rain, but according to Hussein Mousa because the Ateiba troops declared they would not move until they had received some of their 3 months arrears of pay. This is remarkable i^ true,as kasir has received considerable sums of money from Jecca during the past two months. The position at present remains in statu quo.Nasir has not succeeded in winning over any of the bigger Sheiichs and Al i Me din i, (Shawan Belair), Aj i, Ahmed es Burnmi (Hali) and Beitali (Yu'ala) are still assisting the Turks. With the torce at his disposal Nasir ought to be able to maintair his position; but Kuniida should be frequently visited by the Patrol. In the meantime the trade of the place is prac ticallypractically dead* The chief merchant, Jiffri, has not yet returned from Birk, whither he fled when the Turks re-occu pied Kunfida* (2) I saw the Sheikh of Birk on 21st Uovember and 4th December, As far as I can gather from him there are no indications of any activity on the Idrises part in the north* (3) As regards the dhow traffic on the Kunfida coast: if any supplies were finding their way from Birk to this district they would naturally go by land and not by sea^- The coast from Kunfida to Jeddah is friendly to the Sherif* I would therefore suggest that the restrictions be removed, as they are extremely difficult to make effective, and if effective, would probhbly not damage the enemy* (4) On Thursday 23rd November in company with the Commanding Officer, M CLlO M I interviewed the Idrisi at Geizan ix whereihas now taken up residence, he was extremely friend ly, but had nothing to communicate except that he was ready to send his gunners to Aden for instruction* he gave no indication of taking any action against the Turks* I heard persistent rumours at Birk and Oeizan that he had been having trouble with Yehia Ali Thawwab, Sheikh of the Beni Abs. These were apparently true as Basahi was sent to Meidi to investigate!-Apparently the trouble has been cleared up. Ali Thawwab has met Basahi at Heidi and is coming to Geizan to meet the Idrisi* There were rumours at Geizan,which I was not able to corroborate, that at the end of the Arabic month the Idrisi will go to keidi and that an attack on Ibn el Heij (Loheiya) is likely. It is said that many of the kikh laf el Yemen Sheikhs have been called to Geizan* I have etc., (sd) B. L. Nalder,Lieut: R.N.V.H., Political Officer,Bed S6a Patrol.
