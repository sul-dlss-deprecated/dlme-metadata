The correspondence is mainly concerned with the news of Ibn Sa'ud’s probable attempt to take over the al-Buraimi region in north-west Oman and the arrangement of the shaikhs of Trucial Oman and Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi on behalf of the Imam of Oman to militarily unite against Ibn Sa'ud. To discuss the matter, members of the Bani Yas tribe from Dubai visit Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih in his home town al-Qabil (mistakenly referred to in the file as Kabul).The Political Agent at Muscat reports to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, on internal affairs taking place in various towns that belong to the regions of al-Dhahira, al-Dakhiliyya and al-Sharqiyya of Oman. He also reports on clashes between the two main Omani factions, the Hanawi and the Ghafiri, and the role played by Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih al-Harthi to settle the cases, reportedly in order to unite various Omani tribes against Ibn Sa'ud.The file also includes news of the areas of Al-'Ainain, 'Ibri and Yanqul falling under the influence of Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih, and news of the murder of some local Omani shaikhs and the names of those who took over their positions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>al-Sharqiyya</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ibri</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Suhar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>al-Buraimi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>al-Dhahira</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>al-Jabal al-Akhdar</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Bū Shāmis (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Bani Yas (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Forts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
