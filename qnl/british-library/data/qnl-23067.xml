I received a telegram on the evening of the 28th November 1934 from the Consul, Baghdad, that he had given a visa for Bahrain to Mr. warding of the American Express Company, who was leaving by Imperial Airways. It was assumed that ^r. Harding was an Amerloan subject. Ln the case of Mr. de ^ontalgu we had had our hands /forced2 . CJT) 1‘orced by the ConsuXctT authorities in Iraq and as we had received no previous intimation of fir. warding f s vTsit it seemed as though we were being rushed again.BurLng the course of the evening i saw the Manager of the Eastern bank and the knew nothing, it seemed possible that Lir. Harding might be examining the possibilities of establishing a branch of his Company in Bahrain and this was definitely not wanted by us for me to get Baghdad so ± asked Mr. Russell to send a message to Basrah to stop Mr. Harding there. He sent two wires, one at midnight and aae next morning. The plane was delayed at Basrah from engine trouble. It eventually left Basrah at 10.00 hours on the 89th. ^r. Harding decided to continue his journey, imperial Airways said that he claimed to be a British subject. But I wanted definite information, ^ater after the aeroplane had left Kuwait I had confirmation Ln an intercepted message sent by Mr. Harding to Baghdad, 4. In order to be on the safe side the Adviser and I to return to Baghdad on the westbound aeroplane which w£s coming through on the 30th. I wfljed this to the Political the reason for my actions and he understood what had happened. He said that he actually suggested to the Consul Baghdad, that the telegram sent to Bahrain should state that he was a British subject. He wanted to discuss travel facilities of Oil liS(^d Manager of the Oil Company. Neither knew of Mr. Harding Mr. Russell said that Imperial Airways had asked him to put up Mr. Harding. Otherwise he knew nothing. The Adviser also or by the Bank. 3 As the Wireless station was closed Lt was impossible / agreed that unless we were satisfied we Should ask Mr. warding Resident. 5. When he arrived he came and saw me and I told him /Company rsJ • Company employees with Mr. Davies and Mr. Russell, -his clla and he also asked the Ifenager of the °ank about,*? the sale of American cheques. He stayed till the Snd December when he left by slow mail, as he'was in a hurry to get back - he wanted to be in Pc^is for Christmas. I gave him a free transit visa fo/ Kuwait where he cpuld continue his journey to Basrah by car. . • 6.. He was a pleasant man and was not in the least annoyed as the Political Resident suggested in one telegram. 7 I think that in future the nationality of travellers should always be given in telegrams regarding the issue of visas. , 8. Hr. Harding is Assistant Vice-President o. the 'American hxpress Company and he lives in Paris. 00 • r 0 lf from being annoyed that he offered to put me up on my way through Paris next year! y IxT 2-13-1934.
