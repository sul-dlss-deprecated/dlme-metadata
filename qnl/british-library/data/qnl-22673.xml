I am sorry to be so insistent on servants and household gear but it is essential for you to maintain a separate establishment and it is quioe impossible to purchase very much in Bahrain or on the Trucial Coast. Make a point if you can of finding a good cook and if necessary make do with such local servants as you can find or we can find for you here and at Sharjah. A cook is essential. I well remember meeting you in the mess at Karachi when as you say I was lunching with Colonel Quayle and I look forward to seeing you again here, I do not expect we shall be together very long as I am due to go to the United Kingdom on leave about the end of the n^xt month. It would be much more convenient from our point of view if you were to send your kit in charge of a reliable servant by sea and fly yourself from Karachi because Tandy is somewhat impatiently awaiting your arrival before going to Kuwait to take over as Political Agent.

I understand that officers of the Foreign Service who take leave in the United Kingdom from a post abroad before they have been abroad for, in the case of unhealthy posts, 18 months are not ordinarily entitled toA.free pas sage home. It is now nearly three years since I had leave to the United Kingdom (except for 8 days leave for the interviews before the Civil Service Commission), but only for a fraction of this time have I been a member of theJ?oreign Service and I have not completed 18 months abdrad since I Joined the Foreign Service. 3. You will observe from your records that I tried repeatedly to get leave last summer, both before the 16th August and after it; but that, for reasons beyond my control, I was not permitted to take the leave I required. 4. Had I gone on leave and returned before the 16th August, I would have been Entitled to a free return passage $ from my passage account with the Government of India; and had I gone to the United Kingdom within 6 months of retiring from the I.P.S., I should have been entitled to a repatria tion grant. I am not now entitled to either. I have been prevented from taking advantage of these concessions by the exigencies of the service. I should be grateful if the Resident could be moved to explain the circumstances to the Foreign Office and to ensure that I am allowed a free passage home. 6. I had secured a passage by sea on the 10th May but had to forego it because certain negotiations in which I was engaged on the Trucial Coast had not been completed. I do not now expect to be able to get away until mid-June and I have been unable to secure another sea passage. Also, if I am to get home in time to have my leave, to do one of the training courses that the Foreign Office are running for new entrants, and to get back to the Persian Gulf the beginning of the winter I shall now have to go home by air; and I should be grateful if the Foreign Office could be asked to agree to this. 6. I would also enquire whether officers proceeding on leave by air are entitled to take any excess baggage with them at the public expense. I have examined the possibility of sending a suit case home by sea, but find that it is unlikely to arrive until the end of my leave. - §.N' Major A.L.A, Dredge, MBE, Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident in tie Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.political agiincy, c \ bahrain, No.1636 The 25th May 1948.

Dear Stobart, The Political Resident has recently asked the Foreign Office for advice on the channel of coimunication which the Political Agents in the Gulf should adopt for sending reports to the Foreign Office. ^e are telling Sir Rupet Hay that, in viev of the special conditions obtaining inthe Gulf, ve should prefer that the Political Agent« should address all correspondence on iratters other than routine or internal administration to him rather than to the Foreign Office direct. Exceptions may be made in cases of urgency, but as a general rule ve should prefer despatches a,nd telegrams to be sent tothe Resident, v/ho is ultimately responsible to the Secretary of State for British policy in the Gulf and for administration under the Orders-in-Council. This will not mean that we shall not mcx see your reports here, but only that they will be received with the comments of the Political Resident and thus fitted into the general political picture of the Gulf. I am sending similar letters to the other Political Agents, and a copy to Sir. R. Hay, Yours ever, (G.H. mddleton) P.D.

If any such evidence is available, would you kindly let us (have it? If the charges for the B.C.A.C. rest house at Sharjah are the same as those at Bahrain, it is considered that we should apply for authorisation to pay S6s. a night for officers accommodated there as has been approved in the case of Bahrain. .

Dear Bahrain, We notice that the Foreign Office adminis- -trative departments are in the habit of addressing us 'Political Agency Sharjah',whereas the correct title of the post is, 'British Agency' Sharjah. Likewise, the incumbent is addressed as 'Political Agent' instead of 'Political Officer'. This error has also crept into the Foreign Office list 1960,(page 97). 2, It appears desirable to indicate in some way that Sharjah is a subordinate post to Bahrain and we suggest that this can best be achieved by retaining the titles of post and incumbent employed by the former Government of India,viz,'British Agency' and 'Political Officer' respectively. 3. We suggest that you or Residency might like to address the Foreign Office on this subject. Yours ever, Sharjah.Political Agency, Bahrain, No.F-174 9th Oct. 1950. Dear Establishment and Organisation Department, The political Officer, Trucial Coast, has informed His that certain depart ments of the Foreign Office arc rather vague over his correct designation and that of his post, 2. The post, /hich is at Sharjah, is styled British Agency, Sharjah, and the officer in charge Political Officer, Trucial Coast. The present incumbent is Mr. P.D. Stobart, M.B.K. 3. Similarly, at Dpha, the post is styled British Agency, Doha, and the officer in charge Political Officer, Qatar, the present Incumbent being Mr.M.B.Jacoab. 4. Both these posts are under the superintendence of this Political Agency and the titles of post and incumbent, dacing of course from former Governmont of India days, were designated to show that they are subordinate posts.
