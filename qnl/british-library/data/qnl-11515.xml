IN the following pages an attempt is made to gather within a convenient compass the information scattered through the works of the medieval Arab, Persian, and Turkish geographers, who have described Mesopotamia and Persia, with the nearer parts of Central Asia. The authorities quoted begin with the earlier Moslem writers, and conclude with those who described the settlement of these lands which followed after the death of Timur,—the last great Central Asian wars of conquest,—for with the fifteenth century the medieval period in Asia may be said to come to an end. The present work is also the complement of Baghdad under the Abhasid Caliphate published in 1900, and carries forward the geographical record which I began in under the Moslems, a work that appeared in 1890. To keep the volume within moderate compass, the geography of Arabia, with the description of the two Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, though these for the most part were under the dominion of the Abbasids, has been omitted. Perhaps some other scholar may take up the subject, with fuller knowledge than I have, and write the historical geography of Arabia with Egypt across the Red Sea under the Fatimid Caliphs ; completing the circuit of Moslem lands by describing the various provinces of North Africa, with the outlying and shortlived, though most splendid, western Caliphate of Spain.vi preface. If Moslem history is ever to be made interesting, and in deed to be rightly understood, the historical geography of the nearer East during the middle-ages must be thoroughly worked out. I have made a first attempt, but how much more needs to be done, and better done than in the present volume, I am the first to recognise. The ground, however, for future work is now cleared; the authorities for each statement are given in the footnotes; some mistakes are corrected of previous writers, and a beginning made of a complete survey for this period of the provinces of the Abbasid Caliphate. But my book is only a summary, and does not pretend to be exhaustive; also to keep down the size, I have been obliged to omit translating in full the Itineraries, which our Moslem authorities give us. In this matter a new edition, duly corrected from recently published texts, is indeed much needed of Sprenger's Rout en des Orients, though the translation of the Itineraries which Professor De Goeje has appended to his edition of Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, goes far to supply the lack. With each province I have given such information as our authorities afford of the trade and manufactures; the record, however, is very fragmentary, and for a general survey of the products of the Moslem east, during the middle-ages, the chapter on the subject Gewerbe) in A. von Kremer's Cultnrgeschichte is still the best that I know. A chronological list of the Moslem geographers referred to in the notes by initial letters is given at the end of the Table of Contents. The fuller titles of other works quoted in the notes are given on the first reference to each author, and the names of their works will easily be recovered, for subsequent references, by consulting the index for the first mention made of the book. In the introductory chapter a summary description will be found of the works of the Arab geographers;I PREFACE. Vll m but this matter has already been more fully discussed in Palestine under the Moslems. The dates are given according to the years of the Hijrah, with the corresponding year A.D. (in brackets). The method of transcription adopted needs no comment, being that commonly in use; it may be noted that the Arab w is usually pronounced v in Persian; and that besides the emphatic z the Arab dh and are both indifferently pronounced zin modern Persian, while the has the sound of s. In a work like the present, almost entirely composed from eastern sources, many errors will doubtless be found ; also, with the great number of references, mistakes are unavoidable, and I shall feel most grateful for any corrections, or notice of omissions. My hope is that others may be induced to set to work in this field of historical geography, and if this essay be soon superseded by a more complete survey of the ground, it will have served its purpose in having prepared the way for better things.

Place-names in the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian provinces. Mesopotamia and Persia had formed the kingdom of the Sassanian Chosroes, which the Arabs utterly overthrew when, after the death of Muhammad, they set forth to convert the world to Islam. Against the Byzantines, the other great power which the Moslems attacked, they achieved only a partial victory, taking possession, here and there, of rich provinces, notably of the coast lands to the south and east of the Mediterranean; but elsew T here the Emperors successfully withstood the Caliphs, and for many centuries continued to do so, the Roman empire in the end surviving the Caliphate by over two hundred years. The kingdom of the Sassanians, on the other hand, the Arabs completely overran and conquered; Yazdajird, the last of the Chosroes, was hunted down and slain, and the whole land of Iran passed under the rule of Islam. Then further, and to no inconsiderable extent, the empire of the Caliphs, which had taken over bodily the administration of the older Persian kingdom, came itself to be modelled on the pattern in government which the Chosroes had established; this more especially under the Abbasids, who, rather more than a century after the death of the Prophet, overthrew their rivals the Omayyads, and changing the seat of the Caliphate from Syria to Mesopotamia, founded Baghdad on the Tigris, a few miles above Ctesiphon, the older winter capital of the Sassanians. / i L e S./' 2 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. Baghdad forthwith became, for the East, the centre of the Moslem empire, but from the time of the first Abbasid Caliph 'this empire no longer remained, even nominally, undivided. Spain fell off, and before long an Omayyad Caliph at Cordova was the rival of the Abbasid Caliph at Baghdad. In rather more than a century after their establishment in power, the Abba- sids also lost Egypt, which, at about the date when the Omayyad prince at Cordova had recently proclaimed himself Commander of the Faithful, passed into the power of the Fatimids, who likewise took the style of Caliph, and renounced allegiance to Baghdad. Syria had for the most part followed the fortunes of Egypt; Arabia was the debateable land between the two; in the Further East many provinces became independent of the Abbasid Caliph, but there no permanent rival Caliphate was established; so that in general terms all those broad provinces, which had formed the Sassanian kingdom before the days of Islam, remained to the last nominally, if not really, subject to the Abbasids. This vast stretch of country, bounded to the eastward by the deserts of Central Asia, with the mountains of Afghanistan, and westward by the Byzantine empire, was divided among the many provinces which will be described in detail in the succeeding chapters of the present work. The names of the provinces, and their boundaries, for the most part (and as far as is known), were under the Arabs identical with those that had existed under the Chosroes; indeed the East alters so little that in the majority of cases both names and boundaries have remained almost unchanged to the present day, though, as was to be foreseen, the political state, and especially the economical or material conditions of the country, have varied considerably during the last thirteen hundred years. It will be convenient, before proceeding further, to give a brief summary of these various provinces, taking them in the order in which they are described in the succeeding chapters. The great lowland province, which the Greeks called Mesopo tamia, is the gift of its two rivers the Euphrates and the Tigris; and the latter in its lower course (as will be more fully explained in Chapter II) did not, in Abbasid times, run in the channel which its waters follow at the present day. A glance at the map shows that the sterile Arabian desert comes close up to theINTRODUCTORY. 3 western border of the Euphrates, and this river, therefore, has no right bank affluents. With the Tigris, on the other hand, it is different; the highlands of Persia follow a line standing back at a considerable distance from the eastern side of this river, and many streams flow down from the Persian mountains, these forming numerous left bank affluents of the Tigris. The Moslems inherited from the Sassanians a system of irrigation for Meso potamia which made this province one of the richest in the known world. The system will be more fully explained later; but briefly it may be said that the Arabs effectually watered the country lying between the two rivers^By draining the surplus of the Euphrates through a number of transverse canals flowing to the Tigris; while the districts to the eastward of the Tigris, extending up to the foot-hills of the Persian highlands, were watered in part by the streams which flowed down from these mountains, in part by a series of loop canals, taken from the left bank of the Tigris, and returning to it again, which in turn absorbed the flood-waters of the many small rivers rising in the eastern hills. The Arabs divided Mesopotamia into two provinces, Lower and Upper, of which the Lower comprised the rich alluvial lands known anciently as Babylonia. Lower Mesopotamia was called Al-Trak, and its northern limit (which, however, varied at different times) was a line going east and west, from points on the Eu phrates and Tigris, respectively, where these two rivers first began to flow near each other through the Mesopotamian plain. The largest city of Trak, under the Abbasids, was of course Baghdad; but already a century before that dynasty had come to power, the first Moslems, on conquering this part of Mesopotamia, had founded three great towns, Wasit, Kufah, and Basrah, which continued to flourish for many centuries; and these, with Anbar (already a city in Sassanian days) lying on the Euphrates in the latitude of Baghdad, were the great centres of population in the c Irak province under the Abbasid Caliphs. North of the limit of the alluvial lands stretched the hard and somewhat stony plains of Upper Mesopotamia, where had been the kingdom of Nineveh in ancient times. Upper Mesopotamia the Arabs called Al-Jazirah, 4 the island,' or rather 4 the peninsula,'4 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. or partial island, for these great plains were almost enclosed by a ring of waters, formed by the upper courses of the Euphrates and Tigris, and by streams or canals joining the two to the southward of the stony plains. The province of Jazirah extended north to the mountains in which the two great rivers had their sources; it was divided into three districts, named after the Arab tribes which had settled here in the times of the Chosroes, and its chief towns were Mosul near the ruins of Nineveh, Amid on the Upper Tigris, and Rakkah at the great bend of the Euphrates, near the desert border on the further side of which is Damascus. The chapter following deals with the mountainous countries in which the twin rivers, which are the head streams of the Euphrates, take their rise. This country formed the debateable land between the Caliphate and the empire. Time and again its towns and fortresses were taken and retaken, by Moslems and Christians, as the tide of war ebbed and flowed. The country was never permanently settled by the Arabs, and detailed descrip tion of it is for the most part lacking in our earlier authorities. The same remark, and in a higher degree, applies to the province called Rum (the Roman Territory) which, till the latter part of the 5th (nth) century, remained an integral part of the Byzantine empire; for between this province and the Caliphate the great rampart of the Taurus chain formed the line of demarcation. Almost yearly the Moslems made incursions through the Taurus passes into Anatolia; more than once they laid ineffectual siege to Constantinople; and at times they garrisoned and occupied divers fortress towns up on the great plateau of Asia Minor. But beyond such temporary occupation the Abbasid Caliphs did not succeed in conquering the upland country; they made many raids through Asia Minor, but they held no land, and Moslem rule was not established there, until in the decline of the Caliphate, the Saljuk Turks settled in these highlands which they wrested from the Byzantines, and then finally Asia Minor, or RUm, came to be counted as Moslem land, in which condition it still remains. To the east of Jazirah, or Upper Mesopotamia, came the pro vince of Adharbayjan, the ancient Atropatene, bounded above and below, respectively, by the Araxes and the White River, the Safid-INTRODUCTORY. 5 Rud, both of which streams flowed into the Caspian. The most notable natural feature of this province was the great salt lake, now known as the lake of Urmiyah, near which stood Tabriz and Maraghah, the provincial capitals, while Ardabil, another great town, lay to the eastward nearer the shore of the Caspian. The chapter following describes a number of smaller provinces of the north-western border. First Gilan, or Jilan, on the Caspian, where the Safid-Rud, breaking through the Alburz range, the mountain barrier of the Persian highlands, flows through an alluvial plain of its own making, pushing out a small delta into the Caspian. Next, the province of Mughan at the mouth of the combined Araxes and Cyrus rivers; then Arran lying to the westward between the courses of these two rivers; with Shirvan to the north of the Cyrus, and Gurjistan (Georgia) at its head waters. Lastly we have Moslem Armenia lying at the head waters of the Araxes, which is the mountainous province sur rounding the lake of Van. South-east of Adharbayjan spreads the rich province of Media, which the Arabs very appropriately called Al-Jibal, 'the moun tains,' for its mountains overhang the lowlands of Lower Mesopotamia, and, range behind range, stretch across eastward to the border of the Great Desert of Central Persia. The western part of the Jibal province, in later times, when the Kurds attained fame and power, came to be known as Kurdistan; and in the later middle-ages, but by a misnomer, as will be explained in due course, the province of Al-Jibal was often called 'Irak ^Ajami, or Persian Trak, in contrast to Arabian 'Irak, which was Lower Mesopotamia. The Jibal province included many great cities; in the west Kirmanshah and Hamadan (the latter the ancient Ecbatana); in the north-east Ray (Rhages), and to the south-east Ispahan. At a later period the Mongols of Persia founded Sultamyah in its northern plains, which for a time taking the place of Baghdad, became the capital of this portion of their empire, which included both Mesopotamia and Persia under the A rule of the Il-Khan. In the mountains of the Jibal province many rivers take their rise, among the rest the Kartin, which the Arabs called Dujayl or Little Tigris, and which after a long and tortuous course flows out at the head of the Persian Gulf, a little6 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. to the east of the combined mouth of the Euphrates and Tigris. The province of Khuzistan, lying south of Media and east of Lower Mesopotamia, occupies the lower course of the Kartin river, or Dujayl, with its numerous affluents. This country was extremely rich; Tustar and Ahwaz were its chief towns; and its lands being plentifully irrigated were most productive. East of Khuzistan, and bordering the Gulf, lay the great province of Ears, the ancient Persis and the cradle of the Persian monarchy. Under the Abbasids it still kept the division into the five Kurahs, or districts, which had been organized under the Sassanians, and Ears was closely studded with towns, great and small, the most important of which were Shiraz the capital, Istakhr (Persepolis), Yazd, Arrajan, and Darabjird. The islands of the Gulf were counted as of Ears, and Kays island was an important commercial centre before the rise of Hurmuz. The chief physical feature of Ears was the great salt lake of Bakhtigan, which with other smaller sheets of water stood in the broad highland valleys, whose mountains were offsets of the ranges in the Jibal province, already referred to. In Ears, the Darabjird district under the Mongols came to be counted as a separate province, and was in the 7th (13th) century called Shabankarah; the Yazd district also, in the later middle-ages, was given to the Jibal province. To the east of Ears lay the province of Kirman, far less fertile, almost lacking in rivers, and bordering on the Great Desert. Of this province there were two capitals in Abbasid times, Sirjan and Kirman city; and the two other most important towns of the province were Hurmuz, on the coast; and Jiruft, inland, a centre of much commerce. The Great Desert of Central Persia is the most remarkable physical feature of the high tableland of Iran. This immense salt waste stretches south-east diagonally across Persia, from Ray, at the base of the mountains which on their northern side overlook the Caspian, spreading in a broad band or rather, in a dumb-bell-shaped depression—the lower end of which merges into the hills of Makran, the province bordering on the Indian Ocean. In the Great Desert there are few oases ^ a salt efflorescence covers much of the barren levels, but the desert in winter time is not difficult to pass, and many wellI] INTRODUCTORY. 7 marked tracks connect the towns on either side. But on the other hand the Great Desert is a real barrier to any continuous intercourse between the provinces of Fars and Kirman, which lie on its south-western side, and the eastern provinces which are beyond its other limit, namely Khurasan with Sistan to the south east, and this desert barrier has played an important part all through the history of Persia. After describing what the Moslem geographers have to say of the Great Desert, the same chapter deals with the Makran province, which on the east touched India, running up to the highlands overlooking the Indus valley, part of which is now known as Baluchistan. On these regions, however, our authorities are not very fully informed. North of Makran, and across the narrow part of the desert opposite Kirman, lay the province of Sijistan or Sistan, to the east of the extensive, but very shallow lake of Zarah. Into this lake drained the waters of the Helmund. and numerous other rivers flowing south-west from the high mountains of Afghanistan lying above Kabul and Ghaznah. Here Kandahar stood in a plain between two of the affluents of the Helmund, and where this great river flowed into the Zarah lake lay Zaranj, the capital of Sijistan. North-west of the Zarah lake, and on the border of the Great Desert, was the very hilly province aptly called Ktihistan (Land of Mountains), the chief towns of which were Ttin and Kayin, well known as the Tunocain of Marco Polo; Sijistan and Ktihistan thus forming the southern border of Khurasan, the great eastern province of Persia. Before describing this last, however, the thr^e small provinces of Kilmis, Tabaristan and Jurjan, which form the subject of the succeeding chapter, require notice. Kumis, of which the capital was Damghan, lay in length along the north border of the Great Desert eastward of Ray, comprising the southern foot-hills of the mountain chain of Alburz which shuts off the high plateau of Persia from the Caspian Sea. These mountains, and more particularly their northern flank descending to the Caspian, formed the province of Tabaristan, otherwise called Mazandaran, which extended from Gilan and the delta of the White River (Safid-Rud), on the west, to the south-eastern corner of the Caspian. Here Tabaristan joined Jurjan, or Gurgan, the ancient8 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. Hircania, which included the valleys watered by the rivers Atrak and Jurjan, on which last stood Jurjan city. The Jurjan province extended eastward from the Caspian Sea to the desert which separated Khurasan from the cultivated lands of the Oxus delta, namely the province of Khwarizm. The modern province of Khurasan is but a moiety of the great tract of country which, from Abbasid times down to the later middle-ages, was known under this name; for Khurasan of those days included what is now become the north-western part of Afghanistan. On the east, medieval Khurisan bordered on Badakhshan, its northern frontier was the Oxus and the desert of Khwarizm. The Moslem geographers divided Khurasan into four quarters, named after its four capital cities; Nishapur, Marv, Herat, and Balkh. From a physical point of view the remarkable feature of Khurasan consisted in the two great rivers of Herat and of Marv, which rising in the mountains of what is now Afghanistan, turned north and flowed out to waste in the sands of the desert towards Khwarizm, reaching no sea or lake. The chapter following deals with the upper waters of the Oxus, and a number of small provinces, stretching from Badakhshan westwards, which lie to the north, on the right bank affluents of the great river. Its delta, forming the province of Khwarizm to the south of the Aral Sea, is next described, of which Urganj was the older capital, and in this chapter some pages are devoted to clearing up the much debated subject of the older course of the Oxus to the Caspian. Beyond the great river, and between the Oxus and the Jaxartes, lay the province of Sughd, the ancient Sogdiana, with its two noble cities, Samarkand and Bukhara, both on the Sughd river. This is the penultimate chapter of the present work, and the last chapter deals with the provinces along the Jaxartes, from Farghanah near the borders of the Chinese deserts, of which the capital was Akhsikath, to Shash, modern Tashkand, with the Isbijab province to the north-west, beyond which the Jaxartes flowed out, through the bleak wilderness, into the upper pait of the Aral Sea. Of these northern countries of the Further East, however, lying beyond Central Asia, the earlier Arab geographers give but a succinct account. They were the Turk lands, and it was only after the Mongol invasion that theyI] INTRODUCTORY. 9 rose to importance; of this period unfortunately there is a lack of precise information, the Arab geographers failing us for the most part, and their place being but ill-supplied by the later Persian and Turkish authorities. The Moslems, by the injunction of their Prophet, were bound each, once in a lifetime, to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. Under the Abbasids, when the Moslem empire reached its fullest extent, the pilgrimage was facilitated by the elaborate system of high roads, all made to radiate from Baghdad, where the Tigris was crossed by those coming from the further east and bound for the Hijaz. Of this road system (which the Arabs had in herited from the earlier Persian kingdom) we possess detailed contemporary descriptions; and the chief lines, running through the provinces named in the foregoing paragraphs, may here be summarily described. • The most famous of the trunk roads was the great Khurasan road, which, going east, united the capital with the frontier towns of the Jaxartes on the borders of China. This, too, is perhaps that which of all the roads is best described. Leaving East Baghdad by the Khurasan gate, it went across the plain, passing over numerous streams by well-built bridges, to Hulwan at the foot of the pass leading up to the highlands of Persia. Here it entered the Jibal province and after a steep ascent reached Kirmanshah, the capital of Kurdistan. Crossing the Jibal province diagonally, north east, the road passed through Hamadan to Ray. From Ray onwards it went almost due east through Kumis, having the Tabaristan mountains on the left, and the Great Desert on the south, till it entered the province of Khurasan near the town of Bistam. Continuing onwards it came to Nishapur, then to Tus, and on to Marv, beyond which it crossed the desert to the Oxus bank at Amul, thence reaching successively Bukhara and Samarkand in the province of Sughd. At Zamin a short distance east of Samarkand, the road bifurcated: on the left hand one road proceeded to Shash (Tashkand) and ultimately to the ford at Utrar on the lower course of the Jaxartes; the other road, leaving Zamin, turned off to the right, towards Farghanah and the Upper Jaxartes, coming to Akhsikath the capital, and finally to Uzkand on the borders of the Chinese desert.10 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. This in its full extent was the great Khurasan road; and to the present day the post-roads crossing Persia, but centring in Tihran, near the older Ray, follow the same long track which the earlier Arab geographers have described. After the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, the road system was in part altered by the building of Sultaniyah, which became the capital of the Mongols. But all that this entailed was a branch road north from Hamadan direct to Sultaniyah, which, for a time, took the place of Ray as the centre point of the roads in this quarter. In earlier days, under the Abbasids, cross-roads had branched off, right and left, to various parts of Persia from the chief towns along the Khurasan high road. Thus from near Kirmanshih a road went north to Tabriz and other towns on the Urmiyah lake, with prolongations to Ardabil and to places on the Araxes. Frorn^ Hamadan, going south-east, there was a high road to Isfahan; and from Ray, going north-west, the distances to Zanjan are given, whence a highway led up to Ardabil. Nishapur in Khurasan was a centre for many branch roads; southwards one went to Tabas on the borders of the Great Desert in Kfihistan; another road went to Kayin ■; while south-east was the highway to Herat, whence Zaranj in Sijistan was reached. From Marv a high road followed up the Marv river to Lesser Marv (Marv- ar-Rud), where, joining a road coming from Herat, it went on to Balkh and the eastern frontier lands beyond the Oxus. Finally from Bukhara there was direct communication, north-west, with Urganj in Khwarizm; and, south-west, with Tirmid on the Oxus opposite Balkh. This completes the system of the Khurasan road; and now returning to Baghdad, the central point, the highways going in other directions must be sketched. Down the Tigris, the distances and stations being given both by land and by water, was the highway through Wasit to Basrah, the great port for the trade of the Persian Gulf. From both Wasit and Basrah, Ahwaz in Khuzistan was reached, and thence the high road went due east to Shiraz in Fars. This was a centre of many roads. North was the road to Isfahan and on to Ray; north-east, through Yazd and across the Great Desert Tabas was reached, which communicated with Nishapur; eastward by more than one route Sirjan andINTRODUCTORY. ii Kirman were in communication, and thence eastward across the Great Desert was the way to Zaranj in Sijistan; while south-east and south from Shiraz two roads branched towards the Persian Gulf ports, one passing through Darabjird to Surii near Hurmuz, the other to Siraf, at one time the chief harbour of Fars. Returning once again to Baghdad, the central point, we find that the great Pilgrim road to Mecca and Medina left West Baghdad, going south to Ktifah on the border of the Arabian desert, which it crossed almost in a direct line to the Hijaz. A second Pilgrim road started from Basrah, running at first nearly parallel with the other, which it finally joined two stages north of Mecca. Then from Baghdad, north-west, a road went to the Euphrates at Anbar, and thence up that river to Rakkah, a centre point for roads across the Syrian desert to Damascus, and for many other highways going north to the Greek frontier towns. Finally from Baghdad, north, there were high roads up both banks of the Tigris to Mosul, whence Amid was reached on the one hand, and Kirkisiya on the Euphrates to the south-west. From Amid there were roads communicating with most of the frontier fortresses towards the Greek country. This in brief was the road system under the Abbasids, which, centring in Baghdad, connected the capital by a system of post- stages with the outlying provinces of the empire. The system is very carefully described by the Arab geographers, and for pur poses of reference it may be well now to give in chronological order a short account of our contemporary authorities, on whose works we rely for the facts set down in the following chapters 1 . The earlier of our authorities date from the middle of the 3rd (9th) century, and the first geographical treatises of the Arabs take the form of Road Books. These set forth in detail the various itineraries, are interspersed with short accounts of the towns passed through, and give the revenues and products, in turn, of each province. Of these Road Books we possess four, in par ticular, which are of primary importance, and they complement 1 For further particulars of the Arab geographers see Palestine under the Moslems (London, 1890), the Introductory chapter; also for more detail, the Introduction to the French translation of Abu-l-Fida, by M. Reinaud (Paris, 1848).m 12 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. each other, for their texts have in many passages come down to us in a mutilated condition. The authors of these Road Books of the 3rd (9th) century are Ibn Khurdadbih, Kudamah, Ya'kfibi and Ibn Rustah. The first two are almost identical in substance. Ibn Khur- dadbih was post-master of the Jibal province, Kudamah was a revenue accountant; their itineraries give stage by stage the distances along the great Khurasan road and the other trunk roads, as sketched in the preceding paragraphs, which radiated from Baghdad. The work of Ya'ktlbi has unfortunately not reached us in its entirety; to it we owe the account of Baghdad which, with the description written by Ibn Serapion, has made it possible to work out in detail the topography of the Abbasid capital. Ya^ubi gives further a number of valuable notes on many other cities, and the details of the high roads traversing the 'Irak province are found fully set forth only in his work. Of Ibn Serapion, his contemporary, only a fragment has reached us; but this, in addition to the account given of Baghdad, is of capital importance for the river and canal system of Mesopotamia; he gives also shorter descriptions of the rivers in other provinces. Ibn Rustah has written a similar work to Ya £ kubi, adding many notices of towns; but above all he has given us a most minute account of the great Khurasan road as far as Tus, near Mashhad, with some of its branch roads, notably those going to Isfahan, and to Herat; also the road from Baghdad south to Ktifah, and to Basrah, with the continuation eastward to Shiraz. On all these trunk lines, not only are the distances and stages given, but an exact description is added of the nature of the country passed through; whether the way be hilly, ascending or descending, or whether the road lies in the plain; and this description of Ibn Rustah is naturally of first-rate importance for the exact identifica tion of the line traversed, and for fixing the position of many lost sites. Another authority is Ibn-al-Fakih, a contemporary of Ibn Rustah, who wrote a very curious geographical miscellany, of which unfortunately only an abridgment has come down to us. Some of his notices of places, however, are of use in completing or correcting the earlier accounts 1 . The texts of Ibn Khurdadbih, Kudamah, Ya'kubi. Ibn Rustah and Iff liiiniI] INTRODUCTORY. 13 The systematic geographers begin with the 4th (10th) century. They describe fully and in turn each province of the Moslem empire, only incidentally giving the high roads, and generally piecemeal for each province. Their works are of course a great advance on the Road Books; to them we owe such fulness of geographical detail as will be found in the following chapters, and the three first names on the list, Istakhri, Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi, are those to whose labours we are most materially indebted. The work of Ibn Hawkal is but a new edition, partly enlarged and emended, of Istakhri; on the other hand Istakhri, a native of Persepolis, gives the description of his native province, Fars, in far greater detail than is to be found in Ibn Hawkal, who reduced his chapter on Fars to the due proportion of the remainder of the book. Mukaddasi, their contemporary, wrote his geography entirely on independent lines, and chiefly from his personal observations of the divers provinces. His work is probably the greatest, it is certainly the most original, of all those which the Arab geographers composed; his descriptions of places, of manners i and customs, of products and manufactures, and his careful summaries of the characteristics of each province in turn, are indeed some of the best written pages to be found in all the range of medieval Arab literature. It is further to be remarked that to these last three systematic geographers we owe the exact identification of most of the names displayed on the accompanying maps. At the close of each chapter they give a table of 'the distances,' namely the stages or sections of the great high roads, already described, which crossed the province in question, and in addition to the high roads an immense number of cross-distances are added, going between Ibn-al-Fakih are edited by Professor De Goeje in volumes v, vi, and VII of his series Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum (Leyden, 1885— 1892); further in vol. vi he has added a French translation, with many important notes, of the first two authorities. Of Ibn Serapion the text, describing Meso potamia, will be found in the Jotw. R. Asiat. Soc. for 1895, P* 9 &gt; and the MS. referred to is that in the British Museum, numbered Add. 23,379. Ya'kubi, in addition to his work on geography, also wrote a history, the text of which has been edited by Professor M. T. Houtsma {Ibn-Wddhih, qui dicitur Al- JctquM, Historiae, Leyden, 1883), and this often contains valuable informa tion in matters of geography.14 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. neighbouring towns. These distances, plotted out and starting from known points, enable us to cover the map with a system of triangulation, by means of which the positions of some towns, long ruined, and the very vestiges of which have in many cases disappeared, can be approximately laid down; as, for instance, in the case of Tawwaj in Fars, the ruins of which have not yet been identified, though their situation can now be fixed within narrow limits. Another writer of the 4th (10th) century is Mas'udi, who has left two works ; the first for the most part historical, and well known under the title of The Golden the second, a sort of commonplace book, full of curious details and notes, which is called At -Tanbih, 1 The Admonishment^ ? Coming to the 5th and 6th (nth and 12th) centuries, we have the works of two famous travellers, pilgrims, whose descriptions of the places they passed through are of considerable importance. Nasir, son of Khusraw, the Persian, in the middle of the 5th (nth) century went from Khurasan to Mecca and back, visiting Egypt and Syria on his way out, and crossing Arabia on the homeward journey, and his diary, written in Persian, is one of the earliest works we possess in that language. Ibn Jubayr, the Spanish Arab, a century later made the pilgrimage starting from Granada; and his account of Mesopotamia, particularly of Baghdad, is one of the most interesting that has come down to us. Dating from the beginning of the 6th (12th) century is another Persian work, called the Fars Namah (Book of Fars), describing most minutely that province, and invaluable as far as it goes. Also dating from the middle of this century we have the systematic geography of Idrisi, who lived at the court of the Norman king, Roger II of Sicily. He wrote in Arabic, and very inconveniently has composed 1 The texts of Istakhn, Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi form volumes I, II, and in, respectively, of the already-mentioned series of the (Leyden, 1870—1877). Of Mas'udi the text of the Tanbih has been edited by Professor De Goeje in vol. vm of the same series (Leyden, 1894); and a translation in French of this has been published (Paris, 1896) by Baron Carra de Vaux under the title of Lc Livre de The history, called The Golden Meadows (Muruj-adh-Dhahab), was published (Paris, 1861), the Arabic text being given with a French translation, by Messrs Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille; the two last works under the auspices of the French Societe Asiatique.!] INTRODUCTORY. his description of the known world in 'Climates,'that is according to zones of latitude, whereby the various provinces are often divided up arbitrarily, Mesopotamia, for instance, being partly described in the 3rd Climate, partly in the 4th. He had, unfortu nately for our purpose, no personal knowledge of Persia or the regions east of the Mediterranean, but had visited Asia Minor, then still a province of the Roman empire, and his description of this region would be invaluable, but for the fact that the place- names (by reason of incorrect mss .) are in many cases illegible, or so corrupt as to be at present mostly beyond recognition 1 . Coming to the 7th (13th) century, the period of the Mongol invasion and the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, we have the voluminous Geographical Dictionary of Yakut, a compilation it is true from earlier writers, but illustrated by the author's own far extended travels, which, when it is used with due criticism, is per fectly invaluable. The articles are arranged in alphabetical order, and YaMt quotes freely from almost all his predecessors in Arab geographical literature, some of whose works, as for instance those of the traveller Ibn-al-Muhalhal, who wrote in 330 (942), are only known to us by his excerpts. This great dictionary was epitomised, three-quarters of a century after its appearance, in a work called Al-Marasid, 'the Observatories,' and the author of this epitome, a native of Mesopotamia, often gives valuable corrections, of first hand authority, for places in the regions round Baghdad. Of about the same date is Kazvini, who wrote a work in two parts on cosmography, which giyes interesting notes on the products and the commerce of divers towns and provinces; and in the earlier part of the 8th (14th) century we have the systematic geography of Abu-l-Fida, a Syrian prince, who, though he com piled largely from the works of his predecessors, in addition gives 1 The Persian text of Nasir-i-Khusraw, with an annotated French trans lation, has been brought out by C.

[chap. facts from his own observation of the countries which he had visited 1 . Of the same date, namely the first half of the 8th (14th) century, are the travels of Ibn Battitah the Berber, who rivalled the Venetian Marco Polo in the extent of his voyages. His book is written in Arabic; his contemporary, Mustawfi, wrote in Persian a description of the Mongol kingdom of Iran (Mesopo tamia with Persia), which shows the condition of the country after the Mongol settlement, when this region was governed by the Il-Khans. Mustawfi also wrote an historical work called the Tdrtkh-i-Guzidah^ c the Select History,' which, besides being of considerable value for Mongol times, often contains geographical notes of great importance 2 . For the time of Timur we have primarily the notices in the historical work of £ Ali of Yazd, then the Geography written by Hafiz Abru; both are in Persian, and date from the first half of the 9th (15th) century. Lastly for the settlement after the conquests of Timlir, the works of two Turkish authors, one writing in Eastern Turkish, the other in 'Othmanli, have to be mentioned, both being of the earlier half of the nth (17th) century. These are the History of the Turks and Mongols by the Khwarizm prince Abu-1- Ghazi, and the Universal Geography called the Jahan Numa 1 The MiSjam-al-Bulddn, the great dictionary of Yakut, has been edited in Arabic by F. Wiistenfeld (Leipzig, 1866—1873); the articles relating to places in Persia will be found translated into French, with additions from Mustawfi and later authorities, in the Dictionnaire de la Perse (Paris, 1861) of M. Barbier de Meynard. The Mardsid-al-Ittild, which is the epitome of \ akut, has been edited by Juynboll (Leyden, 1852). The two volumes of the Cosmography of Kazvini have been edited by Wustenfeld (Gottingen, 1848). The text of the Geography of Abu-l-Fida was edited by Reinaud and De Slane (Paris, 1840), and Reinaud also began (Paris, 1848) a translation of this work in French, prefixing to it a valuable Introduction on the Arab Geographers, which translation S. Guyard afterwards (Paris, 1883) completed. The Travels of Ibn Batutah, the Arabic text with a French translation, have been published (Paris, 1874—1879) by Defremery and Sanguinetti. The Persian Geography of Hamd Allah Mustawfi (the text of the Nuzhat-al-KulUb) was lithographed at Bombay in 1311 (1894), and the Guztdah is quoted from the British Museum ms. numbered Add. 22,693, mss. Add. 7630 and Egerton 690 having been collated. Part of the Guztdah has now been printed, with a French translation, by M. J. Gantin (Paris, 1903).INTRODUCTORY. 17 (World Display er) by the celebrated bibliographer Hajj Khalfah \ For elucidating points of detail the works of many of the Arab historians are of primary importance. By earlier writers history and geography were often treated of in one and the same work. An instance of this is the Book of the Conquests, written by Baladhun, and dating from the middle of the 3rd (9th) century. It describes in turn, east and west, all the conquests of the Moslems, and is of great interest as showing the state of the country when Islam first became the dominant creed. Of the chronicles, besides the History written by Ya'kubi, already mentioned, there is, dating from the 3rd (9th) century, the work of Ibn Mashkuwayh, of which the Sixth Section only has been printed. The annals of Hamzah of Isfahan, written in the middle of the 4th (10th) century, likewise give useful information, and though of course composed in Arabic, the work was evidently based on many Persian books, now lost, and it relates facts of which we should otherwise be ignorant. The most complete, however, of the Arabic chronicles, down to the beginning of the 4th (10th) century, at which date he flourished, is that of Tabari, and his work is for geography a primary authority. For later Abbasid history Ibn-al-Athir has to be relied upon; also the entertaining summary of Moslem history generally known by the name of Fakhri. The Universal History of Ibn Khaldun is often of use to supplement the meagre chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir; and the great Biographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan occasionally adds details. These authors all wrote in Arabic. In Persian the two histories called the Rawdat-as-Safa and the Habib-as-Siydr, respectively by Mirkhwand and by Khwandamir 1 The Persian text of the history of Tfomr by 4 All of Yazd, known as the Zafar Nam ah, is published in the Bibliotheca Indica (Calcutta, 1887). A French translation called Histoire de Timour Bee was published (Paris, 1722), by Petis de la Croix. Hafiz Abru exists only in manuscript; the one quoted is that of the British Museum, numbered Or. 1577. The Turkish text of the Jahdn Numd was printed in Constantinople in 1145 (1732) by Ibrahim Efendi, and a Latin translation of part of this work was published by M. Norberg (Lund, 1818). The Turki text, with a French translation, of the History of the Mongols, by Abu-l-Ghazt, has been published by Baron Desmaisons (St Petersburg, 1871). Le S. 2i8 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. his grandson, must be mentioned, for especially in the Persian provinces both these works give valuable geographical information. Two other Persian chronicles, relating to the Saljuk dynasties in Asia Minor and in Kirman, are likewise of importance, and are more than once quoted in the following pages, being referred to under the names of the chroniclers Ibn Bibi, and Ibn Ibrahim 1 . To complete our survey, a few pages in conclusion of this preliminary chapter may be devoted to some general remarks on the place-names which occur in the following chapters, and are set down on the maps. In the two provinces of Mesopotamia the great majority of the place-names are notably either Arabic or Aramaic, this last having been the common language of the people here, prior to the Moslem conquest. The Arabic names of towns generally have, or had, a meaning, as for instance Al-Kufah, Al-Basrah, and Wasit. The Aramaic names, as a rule, are easily recognisable by their form, and by the termination in long a, for example Jabulta; and the meaning of these too is generally not far to seek: e.g. c Abarta, 4 the passage, or crossing place/ marking a bridge of boats; and Bajisra, which is equivalent 1 The text of Baladhurt has been edited by Professor De Goeje (Leyden, 1866). He has also given us Ibn Mashkuwayh, forming the latter part of his Fragmenta Historicorum Arabic or tim (Leyden, 1871). The History by Hamzah of Isfahan has been edited (with a Latin translation) by I. M. E. Gottwaldt (Leipzig, 1844). The numerous volumes of the great Chronicle of Tabari have been published, in three series, under the editorship of Professor De Goeje (Leyden, 1879—1901). The Chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir is edited by Tornberg (Leyden, 1867—1876). Fakhri, more correctly named Ibn-at- Tiktaka, has been edited by Ahlwardt (Gotha, i860). Of Ibn Khaldun, the text quoted is that printed at Bulak in 1284 (1867): the text of Ibn Khallikan has been edited by Wustenfeld (Gottingen, 1837), and an English translation was made by De Slane, for the Oriental Translation Fund (London, 1843). The references to the Persian texts of the histories by Mirkhwand (or Amirkhwand) and by Khwandamir are to the lithographed editions, published in Bombay, of the Rawdat-as-Safd in 1266 (1850), and of the Habib-as-Siydr in 1273 (1857). The two Saljuk chronicles are edited by Professor Houtsma in vols. I and iv of his Recueil de Textes relatifs a VHistoire des Seljoucides (Leyden, 1886—1902). The first of these is by Ibn Ibrahim (otherwise called Muhammad Ibrahim, or Muhammad ibn Ibrahim), who flourished about the year 1025 (^6x6); and the second chronicle is by Ibn Bibi, who wrote about 680 (1281). See also an article by Professor Houtsma in the Zeit, Deutsche Morg, GeselL 1885, p. 362.INTRODUCTORY. 19 to the Arabic Bayt-al-Jisr, meaning 'bridge-house.' Older Persian names like Baghdad, 'the god-given place/ are rare; and here and there a Greek name survives, as for instance Al-Ubullah, representing Apologos. The Greek province of Asia Minor, as already said, only became Moslem land after the Saljuk conquest, in the latter half of the 5th (nth) century; and hence the Greek names are often known to us in two forms, an earlier (Arabic) and a later (Turkish); as, for example, Seleucia given first as Salukiyah, later as Selefkeh; and Heraclia which we find at first as Hiraklah, and in more modern times as Arakliyah. After the Saljuk occupation of the country and the subsequent Ottoman supremacy, Turkish names naturally come to supplant the earlier Greek nomenclature; but in the matter of orthography it must be remembered that the Arabic alphabet is quite as foreign to Turkish as it is to Greek, hence Turkish words (as every Turkish dictionary shows) often have alternative spellings, and the place- names are in like case. Thus we find both Kara Hisar and Karah Hisar; Karah-si and KarasL; Karaman and Karaman, with many other examples. Looking over the maps of the Persian provinces, it is striking how few names there are of Arabic origin. With the exception of Maraghah in Adharbayjan, and the hamlet of Bayza (Al-Bayda, 'the white town') in Fars, there is hardly an Arabic town name to be met with. The Moslems indeed changed little or nothing when they took over the Sassanian kingdom 1 . Very often villages and post-stations had names taken from some natural and notable object; as for example Myrtle village. Camel village, and Salt village; which in Persian were called Dih Murd, Dih Ushturan, and Dih Namak. These names the Arab geographers constantly 1 It has been remarked that in all Moslem Spain, where rich cities abounded, there is only one that bears an Arabic name, to wit the port of Almeria, for Al-Maiiyah, 4 the Watch Tower.' A place-name like Calatayud, which might be taken for another instance, is not primarily the name given to the town, but was only the fortress— Kal'at Ayylib. Job's Castle—below which a town afterwards sprang up. In many cases the original Iberian, Roman, or Visigothic name is for lack of documents unknown ; as for instance in the case of Granada. Mutatis mutandis, the same remarks apply to Persia. 2 220 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. translate, and in their pages we find the above, for instance, given as Karyat-al-As, Karyat-al-Jamal, and Karyat-al-Milh, but there is every reason to believe that in Persia, at all times, the Persian name was in use; in other words it is here, as with us, when we speak of the Black Forest (Schwarz-Wald) or the Cape of Good Hope, such names likewise commonly varying on the maps, and in books, according to the language of the speaker. It will be observed that we have sometimes in the Arabic lists the name of a post-stage, in Arabic, of which the Persian equivalent has not come down to us; e.g. in the case of Ras-al-Kalb, c Dog's Head,' possibly the place later called Samnan. Also occasionally the Arabs gave a nickname to a Persian town, and both names continued simultaneously in use; as for instance Kanguvar, which from the stealing of their mules here the early Moslems had called Kasr-al-Lusiis, 'Robber Castle'; but Persian Kanguvar has in the end survived the Arab nickname. Even when the Moslem conquerors founded a new provincial capital, as was the case with Shiraz, which soon came to eclipse the older Istakhr (Persepolis), they seem to have taken and perpetuated in the new town the name of the original Persian village. The origin and etymology of the name Shiraz, like many others, appears to be unattainable, for unfortunately the geography of the old Sassanian kingdom is almost entirely unknown to us. The pronunciation of names, as is natural, varied with the lapse of time; Turaythith becomes Turshiz: Hamadhan is in later books spelt Hamadan 1 ; further there was evidently an Arabic and a Persian pronunciation (or spelling) of the same name contemporaneously current, thus Arabic Kashan is written Kashan in Persian, Sahik appears later as Chahik, and Saghaniyan is Chaghaniyan. Then again, as the Arabic grammar demanded tri-consonantal roots, the Persian Bam had to be written in Arabic Bamm^ and Kum Kumm ; but this was merely to suit the rules of Arabic orthography, and the doubled final 1 It is to be remarked that the dh, which the modern Persians pronounce z (e.g. Azarbayjan, written Adharbayjan), was apparently sometimes not given the z sound; thus Hamadhan is now called Hamadan, and never pronounced Hamazan. In Persian the Arabic w is generally, but not always, pronounced v, e.g. Kazwin or Kazvin.I] INTRODUCTORY. 21 consonant was never in use in the Persian. In some cases a name would fall into disuse for some unknown reason, to be replaced by another name, but Persian like the first; an instance occurs in Kirmasm or Kirmism, later known as Kirmanshahan, shortened to Kirmanshah at the present day. But we are alike ignorant of the true import of these names, and the cause of the change. In the matter of the prefixing of the Arabic article AI to place-names, the usage appears to be extremely arbitrary. The strict grammatical rule appears to be that the article is only prefixed to Arabic, not to foreign names. This rule, however, never was kept; for instance in Mesopotamia, where most of the names were of course of Semitic origin, the Tigris is always named Dijlah (without the article), but the Euphrates is Al-Furat, though this last is like the first a foreign word \ In the Persian provinces, the tendency was, with the lapse of time, to drop the Arabic article, e.g. (Arabic) As-Sirajan becomes (Persian) Sirjan. The usage however is quite arbitrary, for no explanation can be given why the ancient Rhages should be invariably called by the Arabs Ar-Ray, while Jay, the old name for one part of Isfahan, is always given without the article 2 . The Arabs were somewhat poverty-stricken in the matter of their nomenclature, and the lack is cause of much confusion. With them the capital of a province, as a rule, may be called by the name of the province, even when it has a name of its own; thus Damascus still is commonly known as Ash-Sham, ^(the capital of) Syriaand Zaranj, the chief town of Sijistan, was 1 Thus we have Al-Ubullah (an original Greek name) with the article, and a number of other instances occur. Purely Arab towns sometimes took the article, sometimes not; e.g. Al-Kufah, said to mean 'the (city of the) Reed- huts'; but on the other hand, Wasit, 'the Middle-town,' is always written without the article, though here too it would have seemed equally appropriate. 2 How little any rule holds is shown by the case of Jiddah, the port of Mecca, given both as Juddah, and as Al-Juddah by all the earlier writers. In the following pages where a place-name commonly occurs in the Arabic authors preceded by the article, this is, on first mention, so given. Sub sequently, however, when the name is repeated, for the sake of brevity, and in the maps for distinctness, the article as a general rule is omitted. The use or disuse of the article varies with the different Arab geographers, and like their spelling of foreign names is the reverse of consistent.22 INTRODUCTORY. [CHAP. more often known simply as Sijistan, for Madinat-Sijistan, 'the City' of that province. From this usage much confusion naturally arises when the province had two capitals. This for example is the case with the Kirman province, where the name Kirman {scilicet city) in the earlier books stands for the first capital Sirjan, and in later times for the present city of Kirman, a totally different town, which only became the capital when Sirjan had gone to ruin. Also, on comparing together the maps, as deduced from the statements of the medieval geographers, with the map of the present day, it will often be found that the name of a lost city has been preserved in the modern district; thus of the lost Sirjan city, for example, the name is still met with in the modern Sirjan district ; the same is the case with both Bardasir and Jiruft, formerly each the name of an important town, now only preserved in the district. In short the district and its chief city being always, possibly, known by the same name, either one or the other with the lapse of time might become obsolete. Hence, and conversely to the foregoing examples, the name of the older Aradun district is now given to the little town known as Aradun, which of old was called Khuvar (of Ray). In physical geography the Arab nomenclature was not rich. Single and notable mountain peaks generally had proper names (e.g. Damavand, Alvand), but as a rule no chain of mountains had any particular designation. The great Taurus range shutting off the Byzantine lands was often (and incorrectly) referred to as the Jabal Lukkam, but this is properly only one moun tain group of the Anti-Taurus; and the very notable range of the Alburz, dividing off the high Persian plateau from the Caspian, has, with the Arab geographers, no common term for its long chain of peaks. The great lakes generally had each its special name (e.g. Mahald, Zarah, and CMchast), but more commonly the lake was known by the name of the principal town on its shores ; as for example the Urmiyah lake, and the lake of Van also called after Arjish. Seas were even less distinctively named, being referred to by a variety of appellations, taken from the provinces or chief towns on their coasts. Thus the Caspian was indifferently termed the Sea of Tabaristan, or of Gilan, or of Jurjan, also of Baku, and it was latterly known as the KhazarI] INTRODUCTORY. 23 Sea, from the kingdom of the Khazars which in the earlier middle-ages lay to the northward of it. In a similar way the Aral was known as the Sea of Khwarizm, and the Persian Gulf as the Sea of Fars. In conclusion it is to be understood that only a selection from our authorities is given in the following chapters; the number of towns and villages, the names of which are reported as being situated in this or that province, is very great, certainly more than double the sum catalogued in the index of the present work. But where the site could not even approximately be fixed, the mere name, one in a list, has been omitted. In regard to the maps, these, it will be noted, are simply diagrams to illustrate the text, and they do not show the country as it was at any one particular epoch. Thus towns, which in fact succeeded one another, are often marked as though existing at one and the same time, but the text will duly explain whether this was, or was not the case 1 . 1 Perhaps some apology is due for the inordinate number of references which crowd the footnotes of the following pages; though doubtless by the student, wishing to verify a fact, this will not be counted as a fault. All, or none, seemed the only course. The Moslem writers, Arabs, Persians and Turks, as is well known, are the greatest plagiarists in all literature, and seldom acknowledge their indebtedness. On the other hand, each geographer or historian generally adds something of his own to what he copies (unacknow ledged) from a predecessor, and often by combining many authorities sufficient scraps of information are obtained definitely to substantiate a fact or fix a position. As an instance I may quote the case of the not very important town of Khurkan, in the Kumis province. Nothing much is known of it, but it seemed not unimportant to mark that this Khurkan of Kumis, though now disappeared from the map, was to be kept separate from the like-written name (in Arabic) of Kharrakan in the JiMl province. All that is known of the Kumis town is its position; but to fix this, (1) Kazvmi has to be cited, who says the town stood four leagues from Bistam; to which information (2) Yakut adds the fact that it stood on the road going to Astarabad; while (3) Mustawft further tells us that in his day Khurkan was an important village with a saint's tomb, and plentiful water supply, hence it was not a mere post-station. Yet to record all this, which amounts to so little, three authors have to be quoted, with references to their works, in the footnote.CHAPTER 11. 'IRAK. The division of Mesopotamia, Northern and Southern. 'Irak or Babylonia. Change in the courses of the Euphrates and Tigris. The great irrigation canals. Baghdad. Madain and the cities on the Tigris thence down to Fam-as-Silh. The great plain of Mesopotamia, through which the Euphrates and the Tigris take their course, is divided by nature into two parts. The northern half (the ancient kingdom of Assyria) con sists mostly of pasture lands covering a stony plain; the southern half (the ancient Babylonia) is a rich alluvial country, where the date palm flourishes and the land is watered artificially by irri gation channels, and this for its exceeding fertility was accounted, throughout the East, as one of the four earthly paradises. The Arabs called the northern half of Mesopotamia Al-Jazirah, 'the Island,' the southern half was known as Al-Trak, meaning c the Cliff' or ' Shore,' but it is doubtful how this term came originally to be applied; possibly it represents an older name, now lost, or it was used originally in a different sense. The alluvial plain was also commonly known to the Arabs under the name of As-Sawad, c the Black Ground,' and by extension As-Sawad is frequently used as synonymous with Al-Trak, thus coming to mean the whole province of Babylonia \ The frontier between 'Irak and Jazirah varied at different epochs. By the earlier Arab geographers the limit generally 1 In its secondary sense Sawdd means * the District' round a city, hence we have the Sawad of Baghdad, of Kufah, and of Basrah frequently employed to designate respectively the environs of these cities.\ CHAP. II] 'IRAK. 25 coincided with a line going north from Anbar on the Euphrates to Takrit on the Tigris, both cities being reckoned as of 'Irak. Later authorities make the line go almost due west from Takrit, so as to include in 'Irak many of the towns on the Euphrates to the north of Anbar; this, physically, is the more natural division between the two provinces, and it crosses the Euphrates below 'Anah, where the river makes a great bend to the southward. The Euphrates was known to the Arabs as Al-Furat; the Tigris they called Dijlah (without the article), a name which occurs in the Targums as Diglath, corresponding to the latter part of Hiddekel, the form under which the Tigris is mentioned in the book of Genesis. When the Moslems conquered 'Irak in the middle of the 1 st (7th) century Ctesiphon, which they called Madain, on the Tigris, was the chief city of the province, and the winter capital of the Sassanian kings. The Arabs, however, required cities for their Owri'people, also to serve as standing camps, and three were before long founded, namely, Kufah, Basrah, and Wasit, which rapidly grew to be the chief towns of the new Moslem province, Kufah and Basrah more particularly being the twin capitals of 'Irak during the Omayyad Caliphate 1 . With the change of dynasty from the Omayyads to the Abbasids a new capital of the empire was required, and the second Abbasid Caliph founded Baghdad on the Tigris some miles above Ctesiphon (Madain). Baghdid soon eclipsed all the recent glories of Damascus under the Omayyads, becoming the metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate, and naturally also the capital city of 'Irak, which province now rose to be the heart and centre of the Moslem empire in the east. During the middle-ages the physical conditions in 'Irak were entirely different from what they are now, by reason of the great changes which have come to pass in the courses of the 1 As such Kufah and Basrah were known as Al-'Irakan (vulgarly Al- 'Irakayn), meaning ' the two capitals of Al-'Irak.' At a later date, however, when Kufah and Basrah had lost their pre-eminence, the name Al-'Irakayn or ' the two 'Iraks' came to be used incorrectly, as though meaning the two provinces of 'Irik, namely Arabian and Persian 'Irak, the latter standing for the province of Al-Jibal, but this will be more particularly explained in Chapter XIII.26 'IRAK. [CHAP. Euphrates and Tigris, and the consequent ruin of the numerous irrigation canals which, under the earlier Caliphs, made 'Irak a very Garden of Eden for fertility. 'STthe' present day, the Tigris, following a winding course in a direction mainly south-east, is joined at a point about 250 miles (as the crow flies) below Baghdad by the waters of the Euphrates at Kurnah. The combined rivers, now known as the Shatt-al-'Arab (the Arab Stream), thence flow out to the Persian Gulf by a broad channel or tidal estuary measuring in length about a hundred miles in a direct line. This is what the modern map shows; but in early Moslem times, and, as will be demonstrated, in all probability as late as the middle of the 1 oth (16th) century, the Tigris, when it came about a hundred miles below Baghdad, turned off south, from what is its present bed, flowing down by the channel now known as the Shatt-al-Hayy (the Snake Stream) to Wasit. This city occupied both banks of the river, and the Tigris some 60 miles below Wasit, after expending most of its waters by irrigation channels, finally spread out and became lost in the Great Swamp. Throughout the middle-ages the Great Swa mp, which covered an area 50 miles across, and very nearly 200 miles in length, came down to the immediate neighbourhood of -Basrah. At its north-western end the swamp received the waters of the Euphrates a few miles to the south of Klifah; for the main channel of the Euphrates was in those days the Kufah arm of the river, that which flows by Hillah (now the main stream) being then only a great irrigation canal, called the Nahr Sura. Along the northern edge of the lower part of the Great Swamp a line of lagoons, connected by open channels, made navigation possible; boats passing where the Tigris entered the swamp at Al-Katr, to where (near modern Kurnah) the swamp surcharged by the waters of both Euphrates and Tigris drained out by the Abu-l-Asad canal into the head of the estuary of the Shatt-al-'Arab. By this water way cargo-boats went down without difficulty from Baghdad to Basrah, which last, the seaport of BaghdM, lay at the end of a short canal, leading west out of the tidal estuary—the Blind Tigris as the Shatt-al-'Arab was then more commonly called. The present course of the Tigris, as shown on the modern map, keeps to the eastward of the Shatt-al-Hayy channel, turning'IRAK. 27 4c 1 off at the village now known as Kfit-al-'Amarah, which stands for the medieval Madharaya; and this, the present channel down to Kurnah, was also apparently that occupied by the river during the period of the Sassanian monarchy, when the Great Swamp, described by the Arab geographers, did not as yet exist. The historian Baladhuri dates the origin of the swamp as far back as the reign of Kubadh I, the Sassanian king who reigned near the end of the 5th century a.d. In his day the dykes existing along the Tigris channel, as it then ran, having been for many years neglected, the waters suddenly rose, and pouring through a number of breaches, flooded all the low-lying lands to the south and south-west. During the reign of Anushirwan th e Just, son and successor of Kubadh, the d ykes were partially repaired and the lands brought back under cultivation; but under 'Khusraw Parwiz, the contemporary of the prophet Muhammad, and in about the year 7 or 8 after the Plight (a.d. 629) the Euphrates and the Tigris again rose, and in such flood as had never before been seen. Both rivers burst their dykes in innumerable places, and finally laid all the sur rounding country under water. According to Baladhun King Parwiz himself, when too late, superintended the re-setting of the dykes, sparing neither treasure nor men's lives, 'indeed he crucified in one day forty dyke-men, at a certain breach (Baladhuri reports), and yet was unable to master the flood. 7 The waters could in no wise be got back, and the swamps thus formed became permanent; for during the succeeding years of anarchy and when the Moslem armies began to overrun Mesopotamia and the Sassanian monarchy perished, the dykes, such as still existed, naturally remained uncared for, c and breaches came in all the embankments, for none gave heed, and the Dihkans (namely the Persian nobles, who were the landlords) were power less to repair the dykes, so that the swamps every way lengthened and widened. 7 The above well accounts for the formation of the Great Swamp, and Ibn Rustah refers to this epoch, under the last Sassanians, the first great shifting of the Tigris from the eastern channel, beyond Madharayil, to the western channel (the Shatt-al-Hayy) which passed down through the site sub-28 'irAk. [chap. sequently occupied by the Moslem city of Wasit. This change, says Ibn Rustah, had turned all the country bordering the older eastern course into a desert, and so it remained in the 3rd (9th) century when he wrote. He then describes the back-water, six leagues long (above Kurnah), which ran up north to 'Abdasi and Madhar, where the channel was stopped by a dam; this being evidently the last reach of the former, and present, eastern course of the Tigris. Ibn Rustah states that the dam, which in his time stopped all navigation above this point, had not existed in Sassanian days, when the channel was still open north of 'Abdasi and Madhar right up to where this rejoined the Tigris course (of his day) in the district north of Wasit (at Madharaya), whence up stream the river was clear to Madain. He continues :—' and of old, sea-going ships sailing in from India came up the Tigris (estuary, of the later) Basrah, and thence could attain to Madain (Ctesiphon), for sailing on they came out above (the present) Fam-as-Silh into the Tigris reach of (the river below where, in later times, was) Baghdad.' The lower Tigris at the present day, therefore, flows in the bed which, in the main, it had followed during Sassanian times. But during all the centuries of the Abbasid Caliphate it poured into the swamps down the western channel past Wasit, and the question arises—when did the change back to the present eastern channel take place? The answer is that doubtless the change was brought about gradually, and from the silting up of the western arm; in any case, all our Moslem authorities, down to the age of Timur and the beginning of the 9th (15th) century, describe the lower Tigris as still passing through Wasit, this fact being confirmed by H^fi? Abru writing in 820 (1417). One of the first travellers to speak of the eastern arm as the navigable channel, was John Newberie, who in 1581, after visiting Baghdad, went down by boat in six days to Basrah, passing on the fifth day Kurnah, 'a castle which standeth upon the point where the river Furro (Euphrates) and the river of Bagdet (the Tigris) doe meet.' In the following century the Frenchman Tavernier made the same journey down the Tigris. He left Baghdad in February 1652, and he states that at some considerable distance below this city the Tigris divided into two branches. The western channel (thatn] f IRAK. \ 29 by Wasit) was in his time no more navigable, but it ran—as he expresses it—'vers la pointe de la Mesopotamie.' The French traveller followed in his boat the present eastern channel, which took its course 'le long de Tancienne Chaldee,' after leaving (Kut-al-^Amarah; and just before coming to Basrah he passed Kurnah where, he says, the Tigris and Euphrates joined their streams 1 . The existence of the Great Swamp, and the Consequent change in the courses of both Euphrates and Tigris, is the chief matter of note in the physical condition of Lower Mesopotamia during the Caliphate; but of almost equal importance was the system of canalisa tion inherited by the Arabs when, after the conquest, they took over the country from the Persians. Briefly, as already stated, we find that all Trak north of the swamp, and between the two rivers, was then traversed, like the bars of a gridiron, by a succession of canals which drained eastward into the Tigris; while east of the Tigris a canal, 200 miles in length, called the Nahrawan, starting from below Takrit and re-entering the river fifty miles north of Wasit, effected the irrigation of the lands on the further or Persian side of the Tigris. The details of this great system of waterways will be explained more fully in due course, but a glance at the accompanying map, drawn 1 Baladhuri, 292. I. R. 94. Yak. i. 669. In 1583 John Eldredwent down from Baghdad to Basrah, and also describes how one day's journey before the latter place 'the two rivers of Tigris and Euphrates meet, and there standeth a castle called Curna': see his voyage in Hakluyt, Principal Navigations (Glasgow, 1904), vi. 6; also v. 371, for in 1563 Caesar Frederick had made the same journey and speaks of 4 the castle of Corna 5 in similar terms. For the voyage of John Newberie, see Pure has, His Pilgrimes (folio, 1625—26), v. 1411, 1412; Six Voyages en Turquie de J, B. Tavernier (Utrecht, 1712), i. 240. Other travellers do not afford any detailed information. The earliest mention of the western (present) Tigris arm as navigable appears to be the anonymous Portuguese traveller, a copy of whose manuscript is in the possession of Major M. Hume (see The Athenceum for March 23rd, 1901, P- 373)&gt; wl 10 speaks of the castle (of Kurnah) six leagues above Basrah where the Euphrates and Tigris flowed together. His voyage from internal evidence must have been made in about the year 1555. The conclusion therefore appears to be that, from the time of Muhammad, and during the nine follow ing centuries, the Tigris took the western arm down to the swamps; afterwards, in the early part of the 16th century a.d., changing back into the eastern channel, which it had followed in Sassanian times before the rise of Islam, and which its main stream now follows at the present day. \ i30 'IRAK. [CHAP. up from the accounts of contemporary authorities, shows how the marvellous fertility of 'Irak during Abbasid times was due to a strict economy of the water supply; and that while nearly all the land between the Euphrates and the Tigris was irrigated by the waters of the Euphrates led off through canals flowing eastward, the lands along the left bank of the Tigris, and towards the foot-hills of the Persian highlands, were made fertile by the canals of the Nahrawan, which economically distributed the surplus waters of the Tigris to the eastward, and caught the flood of the numerous streams flowing down from the mountains of Kurdistan. The topography of Baghdad has been dealt with in a previous volume 1 , and all that is necessary in this place is to summarise the most important facts, in order to make clear the position of the Abbasid capital among the other cities of Trak, and explain the details of the road system (already referred to, in Chapter I) of which Baghdad was the central point. The first of the great canals which ran from the Euphrates to the Tigris was the Nahr Tsa 2 , and just above where its waters flowed out into the latter river, the jCaliph Ma n s ur about the year I 45 (7 62 ) built the Round city, which became the nucleus of Baghdad. The Round city had four equidistant gates lying one Arab mife apart each from the other, and from every gate went a high road. Great suburbs were in time built on these four roads, and these before long came to be incorporated in the circuit of the great metropolis. The four gates of the Round city were (i) the Basrah Gate to the S.E. opening on the suburbs along the Tigris bank where the various branches of the Tsa canal flowed out; (2) the Ktifah Gate to the S.W. opening on the highroad 1 Baghddd during the Abbastd Caliphate (Oxford, 1900). It is to be noted that the number of districts, towns, and villages in ^rak of which information has come down is very great, and a volume would be needed to report all that is known of this, the capital province of the Abbasids. The map constructed for the paper on Ibn Serapion {Jour. Roy. Asiat. Soc. 1895, p. 32) gives all the places lying on the rivers and canals, but this does not exhaust the list, and the reader may be referred to the work of Professor M. Streck, Die alte Landschaft Babylonien (Leyden, 1901), for fuller details, which it is impossible to find place for in the present chapter. Nahr means both * canal' and 'river' in Arabic; 4 1 sa was the name of the Abbasid prince who dug the canal.'] 'irAk. going south, which was the Pilgrim road to Mecca; (3) the Syrian Gate to the N.W. where the high road branched left to AnMr on the Euphrates, and right to the towns on the western Tigris bank north of Baghdad; and (4) the Khurisan Gate leading to the main bridge of boats for crossing the river. By this bridge East Baghdad was reached, at first known as the Camp of Mahdi, son and successor of the Caliph Mansur, and Mahdi built his palace here, also founding the great Friday Mosque of East Baghdad. The settlement on the east side was divided into three quarters, that near the bridge head was known as the Rusafah quarter, the Shammasiyah quarter lay above it along the river bank, and the Mukharrim quarter below it. These three quarters of East Baghdad were surrounded by a semicircular wall, going from the river bank above the Shammasiyah to the river again below the Mukharrim; and across the middle and narrow part of East Baghdad went the beginning of the great Khurasan road, starting from the Khurasan Gate of the Round city, and crossing the main bridge to the (second) Khurasan Gate of East Baghdad, whence, as explained in the previous chapter, the trunk road went east to the limits of the Moslem empire. From the Ktifah Gate of the Round city, as already stated, led the KMah or Pilgrim road, going south, and the great suburb which here stretched to a point nearly a league distant from the walls of the Round city was known as Karkh. The suburb of the Muhawwal Gate lay to the westward of the Round city, being reached from both the Kfifah Gate and the Syrian Gate, where the roads converging fell into the great western high road going through the town of Muhawwal to Anbar. North of the Syrian Gate was the Harbiyah quarter (balancing Karkh on the south of the Round city), and beyond the Harbiyah and surrounded on two sides by a bend in the river were the northern cemeteries of West Baghdad, at a later time famous as the Kazimayn, and so named from the tombs of two of the Shi'ah Imams. The city of Baghdad occupied the central point of four districts, two being on either bank of the Tigris. On the western side the Katrabbul district was north of the Tsa canal, and BMuraya lay to the south of the same; while on the eastern bank the Nahr Buk district was to the north of the line of the Khurasan32 'irAk. [chap. road, and Kalwadha district to the southward; the town of Kalwadha standing on the river bank a short distance below the southernmost gate of East Baghdad. From Baghdad, as the central point of the road system of the empire, two roads (as already said), going south and west, bifurcated at the Kufah Gate of the Round city; and two, going north and east, passed through East Baghdad, having their starting-point at the further end of the main bridge of boats. The southern road, to Kufah (and Mecca), after leaving the suburb of Karkh, came before long to the town of Sarsar, on the Nahr Sarsar, the second of the great canals from the Euphrates to the Tigris, which flowed parallel with the Nahr 'Isi on the south. The western or Anbar road turning off at the Kufah Gate, and passing through the suburb of Baratha, came after about a league to the town of Muhawwal which stood on the 'Isa canal. The eastern or Khurasan road left East Baghdad (as already said) at the Khurasan Gate, north of the Mukharrim quarter, and the first town reached was Nahrawan Bridge at the crossing of the great canal of this name. Finally, the northern road passed through the Shammasiyah quarter to the Baradan Gate of East Baghdad, and shortly came to the town of Baradan lying on the east bank of the Tigris; whence, keeping along the left bank of the river, the high road reached Samarra and the towns of northern Mesopotamia. Duxing^the five centuries of the Abbasid Caliphate the plan of Baghdad with its suburbs changed considerably as the city grew and in parts fell to ruin. What has been sketched in the fore- going paragraphs was the city as it existed in the time of Harun-ar-Rashid. The civil war which broke out after his death brought about the ruin of the Round city. In 221 (836) the seat of the Caliphate was removed to Samarra, and during the reigns of seven Caliphs Baghdad was reduced to the condition of a provincial town. When finally in 279 (892) Samarra was abandoned and the Caliph re-established his court in the old capital, it was East Baghdad, where many new palaces came to be built, which succeeded to the glories of the Round city, now falling more and more to ruin; and for the next four centuries, down to the invasion of the Mongols, the Caliphs permanently established their residence on the east bank.n] 'irak. 33 These palaces of the later Caliphs were built on the land to the south of Mukharrim, the lowest of the three quarters included within the wall of East Baghdad as it had existed in the time of Hartln-ar-Rashid. These three quarters, at the date in question, had fallen to ruin, but the new palaces quickly came to be surrounded by new suburbs, which in their turn were before long en closed by a great semicircular wall. The new wall of East Baghdad, including in its circuit a part of the older MuERarrim, went from the river bank above the palaces to the river bank below (adjacent to Kalwadha), and it was built by the Caliph Mustazhir in 488 (1095). This was the wall, more than once repaired, which finally in 656 (1258) proved impotent to withstand the Mongol attack, and the Abbasid Caliphate fell. At the present day this ruined wall remains, enclosing within its wide circuit the few relics that time has left of the city of the Caliphs, and still protecting modern Baghdad, which is as heretofore the capital of Trak, and the residence of its Turkish Governor. Seven leagues below Baghdad, and occupying both banks of the Tigris, lay Al-Madain, 'the Cities,' as the Arabs called the ruins of the twin capitals, Ctesiphon and Seleucia, which had been founded under the earlier Seleucids three centuries before Christ. ^eleTOia of the west bank had received its name from Seleucus Nicator. The name of Ctesiphon, which the Arabs give under the shortened form of Taysafun, is of uncertain etymology; though in appearance it is Greek, it probably is a corruption of the old Persian name of the city, for it is not known to us how the Sassanians called this capital of their empire 1 . In 540 a.d. Antishirwan the Just had taken Antioch of Syria, with Seleucia on the Orontes, and after the fashion of Persian monarchs had transported the inhabitants of this Seleucia to his capital at Ctesiphon. Here he settled them in a new suburb on the east side of the Tigris, opposite therefore to the site of Seleucia of 1 It has been plausibly suggested that Ctesiphon is to be identified with Casiphia of the book of Ezra (viii. 17), which lay between Babylon and Jerusalem, and which in the Septuagint version is named 'the Silver City.' Maddin is merely the Arabic plural of Madtnah, 4 a city'; and Casiphia would be the Chaldee form of the Persian name, now lost, of the capital of the Chosroes. L e S. 334 'IRAK. [CHAP. Mesopotamia; and this suburb existed when the Arabs conquered the country in the following century, being still known as Rumiyah, the Roman (or Greek) town, which some report to have been built on the plan of Antioch. Al-Madain, according to the Moslem authors, consisted of seven cities, whose names, with divers readings, are duly chronicled; but five cities only appear to have been in existence and inhabited when Ya'ktibi wrote in the 3rd (9th) century. These were, on the east bank, Al-Madinah-al- c Atikah, 'the Old Town,' corresponding with Ctesiphon, and one mile south of it Asbanbur, adjacent to which lay Rumiyah. On the opposite bank of the Tigris was Bahurasir, a corruption of Bih-Ardashir— £ the good town of King Ardashir'—and one league below it was Sabat, which according to Yakut was called by the Persians Balasabad. The great Sassanian palace, of w T hich the ruins still exist, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, was know r n to the Arabs under the name of the Aywan-Kisra, ' the Hall of the Chosroes/ and this, accord ing to Ya'ktibi, stood in Asbanbur; while another great building known as Al-Kasr-al-Abyad, 'the White Palace,* was to be seen in the Old Town a mile distant to the north. This, last, however, must have disappeared by the beginning of the 4th (10th) century, for all later authorities give the names of 'the White Palace,' and ' the Hall of the Chosroes ? indifferently to the great arched building which to the present day exists here as the sole relic of the Sassanian kings. This building had a narrow escape from complete destruction in the middle of the 2nd (8th) century, when Mansur was founding Baghdad; for the Caliph expressed his intention of demolishing the Sassanian palace, and using the materials for his new city. His Persian Wazir, Khalid the Barmecide, in vain attempted to dissuade him from this act of barbarity, but the Caliph was obstinate; the Wazir, however, gained his point for, when the order came to be carried into effect, the demolition was found to be more costly than the materials were worth for the new buildings, and the Arch of the Chosroes, as Yaktit calls it, was left to stand. At a later period much of its stone work was carried off for the battlements of the new palace of the Taj in East Baghdad, which the Caliph 'All Muktafi finished building in the year 290 (903).n] 'IR A K . 35 In the 4th (10th) century Madain, which is at the present day a complete ruin, was a small and populous town, with a fine Friday Mosque dating from the days of the Moslem conquest; near which stood the tomb of Salman the Persian, one of the best known Companions of the prophet Muhammad. The markets of Madain were built of burnt brick and were well provided. In the neighbouring RCimiyah, the Caliph Manstir had for a time held his court, while at Sabat on the opposite bank Mamtin had also resided. The grandeur of the ancient palace of the Chosroes is a theme on which the Arab geographers relate many details. Ya'kfibi says that the summit of the great arch is 80 ells in height; Yakut refers to the magnificent kiln-burnt bricks, each near an ell in length by somewhat less than a span in width. Mustawfi, who gives the legendary account of Madain and its palace, reports that in the 8th (14th) century both Madain and Rtimiyah had come to be uninhabited ruins, though the villages opposite, on the western bank, still retained their inhabitants. Of these, he adds, the most important was Bahurasir, already men tioned, which Yak tit, who had been there, calls Ar-Rumakan. To the south of it lay Zariran, a stage on the Pilgrim road, and to the west Sarsar, already mentioned, on the Sarsar canal, which last fell into the Tigris a short distance above Madain. The district round Madain, which stretched eastward from the Tigris to the Nahrawan canal, was known as Radhan (Upper and Lower), of which Yakut names numerous villages, and Mustawfi praises the magnificent crops harvested here 1 . Dayr-al-'Akiil, 'the Convent of the (river) Loop,' is still marked on the map, situate on the east bank 10 leagues below Madain, and the name is descriptive of the Tigris course at this point.' It was a Christian monastery, surrounded by a town of considerable size, the latter being counted as the chief city of the district of Middle Nahrawan. In the town was a Friday Mosque 2 , standing 1 Ykb. 320, 321. I. S. 9. I. H. 167. Muk. 122. Yak. i. 425, 426, 768, 809; ii. 729, 929; iii. 3.

Ibn Rustah at the close of the 3rd (9th) century describes the toll-barrier which was set across the Tigris here, and kept closed by the officer of the customs. He writes:—'the toll-bar (Al-Maasir) is the name given to the places on the Tigris where two boats have been moored on the one bank of the river, opposite two other boats on the further bank, which two likewise are firmly moored. Then across the stream they have carried cables, the ends being fastened on either bank to these boats, and thus ships are prevented from passing at night without paying toll.' Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century refers to Dayr-al-'Akfll as one of the finest cities of this region of the river bank, but afterwards the bed of the Tigris changed and Yakut in the 7th (13th) century says that the great convent then lay a mile distant from the Tigris, standing solitary in the midst of the plain. Mustawfi, however, in the following century still counts Dayr-al-'Akul as a large town, having, he adds, a damp climate on account of its surrounding palm-groves. Also on the east bank, but lying three leagues above Dayr-al- 'Akul, was the small town of As-Sib, for distinction called Sib of the Bani Kuma, which was noted for its olive-groves, and famous in history for the battle which took place here in 262 (876), when Ya'Mb the Saffarid was defeated by the troops of the Caliph Mu'tamid. A short distance below Dayr-al-'Akul stood the monastery of Marmari, surnamed the Disciple, otherwise called Dayr Kunna (or Kunnah), which lay a mile to the east of the Tigris, and 16 leagues from Baghdad.

The J^reat Mosxpie^on the other hand, was where weekly the Friday prayers were said, and the sermon (Khutbah) preached; and it was called Masjid-al-Jami', ' the Mosque of the Congregation'—terms often translated by 'the Cathedral,' or 'Congregational 1 Mosque.' The poss ession of a Jdm or Minibar (pulpit, for the Friday Sermon) generally is a criterion of the size of a town, or village ; and the fact v is often mentioned as such by the Arab geographers; Istakhri for instance gives a long list of places in Fars which had, or had not a Mimbar; and this comes to much the same as if it were said that in such and such a village, in a Christian land, stood the parish church. At a later date the term Masjid- al-Jami' became changed to Masjid-al-Jum'ah, meaning ' the Friday Mosque, but this is not the classical usage.n] 'IRAK. 37 the 4th (10th) century (quoted by Yakut) describes it as a great monastery surrounded by so high and strong a wall as to be like a fortress and impregnable. Within the wall were a hundred cells for the monks, and the right to a cell was only to be bought for a price ranging from two hundred to a thousand dinars (^100 to ^500). Each cell stood in its own garden, watered by a small canal and planted with fruit trees which produced a crop that yearly might be sold for from 50 to 200 dinars (^25 to ^100). Over against Dayr Kunna, but on the Tigris bank, was the small town of As-Safiyah, which Yakut writes was in his day already a ruin; and opposite this on the western side lay Humaniyah (or Humayniyah) which is still found on the map, two leagues S.E. of Dayr-aPAktil. In the beginning of the 3rd (9th) century Humaniyah was a place of some importance, for after the death of the Caliph Amin, his two sons and his mother, Zubaydah, widow of Harun-ar-Rashid, were for a time sent to be kept in prison here by Mamun; and Yakiit in the 7th (13th) century describes Humamyah as a large village surrounded by well cultivated lands 1 . Jarjaraya, or Jarjaray, which still exists, lay four leagues S.E. of Dayr-al-'AktiL It is described by Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century as having been a large town, and its Friday Mosque stood close to the Tigris, which surrounded the town on two sides. Ya^ubi writing in the previous century states that its population chiefly consisted of Persian nobles, and it was the capital of the district of Lower Nahrawan. In the 7 th (13th) century, according to Yakut, it was, like most of the towns of the Nahrawan districts, in a state of complete ruin. On the western bank of the Tigris, four leagues below Jarjaraya, at the ruins now called Tall-Nu'man stood the town of An-N^maniyah, which Yakut counts as the half-way stage between Baghdad and Wasit. An-Nu £ maniyah was the capital of the Upper Zab district, its Friday Mosque standing in the market place, and Ya^ubi adds that near by stood the monastery called Dayr Hizkil, where mad people were looked after by the monks. Nu'maniyah was celebrated according to Ibn Rustah for its looms, where carpets like those of Hirah were 1 I. R. 185, 186. Ykb. 321. Kud. 193. Muk. 122. Mas. Tanbih 149.

In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi still speaks of Nu f maniyah as a flourishing town surrounded by date-groves. The small town of Jabbul lay on the eastern bank, nine leagues below Jarjaraya, where Ibn Rustah in the 3rd (9th) century says that there were government bake-houses. It was then a large hamlet, having a Friday Mosque standing in the market place, and Mukaddasi describes it as of the size of Dayr-al-'Aktil; but when YaMt wrote, Jabbul had sunk to the size of a big village 1 . The town of Madharaya occupied the position where at the present day Kut-aPAmarah stands, namely at the bifurcation of the Shatt-al-Hayy from the eastern, and modern bed of the Tigris, which now goes thence south-eastward down to Kurnah. Madh araya was on the east bank, and in the 3rd (9th) century it was inhabited by Persian nobles. Here the great Nahrawan canal flowed back into the Tigris; and immediately below Madharaya came Al- Mubarak, a town which lay opposite Nahr Sabus on the western bank of the Tigris. The town of Nahr Sabus was at the mouth of the canal of this name, which will be spoken of laterj and this was the chief town of the Lower Zab district; it was counted as five leagues distant from Jabbul. On the opposite bank, and five leagues down stream, was the Silh canal with the town called Fam-as-Silh at its f mouth ? {Fam\ or point of origin, which latter lay seven leagues above Wasit. Fam-as-Silh town stood on the Tigris bank, it had fine markets and a Friday Mosque, according to Ibn Rustah. This place was famous in Moslem history for the magnificent palace built here by Hasan ibn Sahl, the Wazir of Mamun, in which he celebrated the marriage of his daughter Buran with the Caliph, spending fabulous sums in banquets and gifts, as will be found chronicled in the pages of Mas^dL Fam-as-Silh afterwards fell to ruin, and Yaktit who visited it in the 7th (13th) century, found the town and neighbouring villages along the canal for the most part uninhabited 2 . From the town of Fam-as-Silh the buildings of the Great Mosque in Wasit were visible on the southern horizon. 1 Kud. 193. Ykb. 321. I. R. 186, 187. Muk. 122. Yak. ii. 23, 54; iv. 796. A. F. 305.

Wasit, the 4 middle city, 7 was so called because it lay equi distant (about 50 leagues) from Kufah, Basrah, and Ahwaz. It was the chief town of the Kaskar district, and before the foundation of Baghdad, as already said, was one of the three chief Moslem cities of 'Irak. Wasit was founded about the year 84 (703) by Hajjaj, the famous viceroy of Mesopotamia in the reign of the Omayyad Caliph 'Abd-al-Malik. The city occupied both banks of the Tigris, the two halves being connected by a bridge of boats, and there were two Friday Mosques, one for each half of the city. Ya'kubi states that eastern Wasit had been a town before the days of Hajjaj, and here in the 3rd (9th) century the population was still for the most part Persian. In the western half of the city stood the Green Palace, built by Hajjaj, and called Al-Kubbat Al-Khadra, celebrated for its great dome, from the summit of which Fam-as-Silh seven leagues distant to the north could be seen. The lands round Wasit were extremely fertile, and their crops provisioned Baghdad in time of scarcity; also paying yearly into the treasury a million of dirhams (^'40,000) from taxes, as reported by Ibn Hawkal, who was at Wasit in 358 (969). Mukaddasi states that the mosque in the eastern half of Wasit likewise was built by Hajjaj. The town markets were magnificent40 ( irAk. [chap. and well stocked, also at either end of the bridge of boats were two small harbours where boats moored for convenience of discharging cargo. During the whole period of the Caliphate Wasit continued to be one of the most important cities of ^rak, and apparently the eastern quarter was the first to fall to ruin, for Kazwini, who was Judge at Wasit in the latter half of the 7th (13th) century, speaks of the town as lying solely on the western Tigris bank. Ibn Batutah, who was here in the early part of the following century, praises the fine buildings of the city, especially a great Madrasah, or college, with 300 rooms for students, and Mustawfi his contemporary speaks of the immense palm-groves lying round the town which made its climate very damp. At the close of the 8th (14th) century Wasit is frequently mentioned as a place of importance during the various campaigns of Timtir, who kept a strong garrison here; but about a century after this, as already described in the beginning of the last chapter, the Tigris ceased to flow past Wasit, taking the eastern course down by Kurnah, and the city fell to complete ruin. Hajjl Khalfah, writing in the beginning of the nth (17th) century, speaks of it as then standing in the desert, but the canal was famous for its reeds from which pens were made 1 . Below Wasit, according to Yaktit, the Tigris flowed out into the Great Swamp by five navigable waterways, the names of which he gives, and this statement is corroborated by the accounts of earlier writers. Ibn Serapion mentions a number of towns lying on the main arm of the river below Wasit, and above Al-Katr, where in the 4th (10th) century the swamp began. The first of these towns was Ar-Rusafah, 4 the Causeway,' lying on the left bank, ten leagues from Wasit, and near it flowing eastward into the swamp was the canal called Nahr Ban, with the town of the same name, 1 Ykb. 322. i.

Their position on the Shatt-al-Hayy is fixed within narrow limits by the Arab itineraries. Chesney {Report of the Euphrates and Tigris Expedition, i. 37) states that these ruins were visited by Ormsby and Elliott in 1831—2, but he does not mark their position.Ill] ^RAK. 41 also spelt Nahr Aban, at its exit. Below this came Al-Farlith and then Dayr-al-'Ummal, 'the Convent of the Governors.' These were on the eastern bank, opposite to which and flowing west into the swamp were three canals, first the Nahr Kuraysh with a great village on it of the same name; then Nahr-as-Sib, on which stood the towns of Al-Jawamid, 'the Dried-lands, 7 and Al-'Ukr; finally, the Nahr Bardtida on which lay the town of Ash-Shadidiyah. All these were important towns lying in the swamp, round and about Al-Jamidah, otherwise called (in the plural) Al-Jawamid; further, Mukaddasi describes a large town in this region called As-Salik, standing on an open lagoon which was surrounded by farmsteads and well cultivated lands. Over against these places and on the eastern bank of the main arm of the Tigris was Al-Hawamt, 'the Taverns/ where there was a toll-bar moored across the river, like the one already described at Dayr-al-'Akul (p. 36), and this was close to Al-Katr, 12 leagues below Rusafah, where, according to Ibn Rustah, the Tigris in the 3rd (9th) century dividing into three arms finally entered the swamp 1 . The Swamps were called Al-Bataih (the plural form of ^4/- Batihah, signifying a 4 lagoon') and their history has been already described (p. 26). The whole area covered by them was dotted with towns and villages, each standing on its canal, and though the climate was very feverish the soil, when drained, was most fertile. Ibn Rustah writing at the close of the 3rd (9th) century describes the Great Swamp as everywhere covered by reed-beds, intersected by water channels, where immense quantities of fish were caught, which, after being salted, were despatched to all the neighbouring provinces. In regard to the Tigris waters, it appears that from Katr eastward—and probably following, approximately, the line of the present channel of the Euphrates—the waterway led through a succession of open lagoons to the Abu-l-Asad canal, by which the waters of the swamp drained out to the Basrah estuary. These lagoons of open water, clear of reeds, were called Hawr or Hawl by the Arabs, and the lagoons were connected by channels navigable for small boats. The great river barges, 1 I. S. 9, 10. Kud. 194. I. R. 184, 185. Muk. 119. Yak. ii. 10, 553; iii. 209, 415, 840; iv. 217, 758.42 ^rak. [chap* according to Ibn Rustah, did not pass below Katr, but here transferred their cargoes to wherries, so light of draught as to pass through the channels threading the lagoons. All along these channels, stations on platforms had been made, where in huts built of reeds, and thus raised above the plague of gnats, guards were posted to keep the course clear and to protect wayfarers, for the recesses of the Great Swamp were the natural hiding-place of outlaws. Ibn Serapion gives the names of four of the great lagoons (Hawr, or Hawl) through which the waterway went towards Basrah. The first was called Bahassa, the second was the Bakamsi lagoon &gt; then the Basrayatha, and the fourth was the Hawr-al-Muham- madiyah, the largest of all, on which stood the tower called Minarah Hassan, after Hassan the Nabathaean who had been employed by the Omayyad viceroy Hajjaj to drain and reclaim lands in the Great Swamp. Beyond this last lagoon came the channel passing the villages of Al-Halah and Al-Kawanm, and ending in the canal of Abu-l-Asad, which finally carried the waters of the swamp to the head of the Tigris estuary. This Abu-l-Asad, whose canal roughly corresponds with the last reach of the present course of the Euphrates above Kurnah, had been a freedman of the Caliph Mansur, and when in command of troops at Basrah he dug, or more probably widened, the boat channel which, as Yak6t remarks, had doubtless existed here from Sassanian times. Kurnah, at the present point of junction of the Euphrates and Tigris, is not mentioned by any of the Arab geographers, and the first notice of this castle appears in the Turkish Jahdn Numa at the beginning of the nth (17th) century. The last reach of the eastern course of the Tigris—that of Sassanian times, as also of the present day—existed, as already said, in the middle-ages as a back-water, stopped at its northern end by a dam. This back-water, called the Nahr-al-Madhar, was six leagues in length, and led to the two cities of ^bdasi (or ^bdasi) and Al-Madhar; the exact sites of which are unknown. The surrounding district—along the then desiccated eastern bed of the Tigris—was called Jiikha, and it stretched north-westward to Kaskar, the district of Wasit. Madhar had been a city of much importance at the time of the Moslem conquest, and was thenIll] 'IRAK. 43 the capital of the district of Maysan, otherwise called Dasti- Maysan. Madhar is described as lying four days' journey from Basrah, and was celebrated for its beautiful mosque and the much venerated tomb of 'Abd-Allah, son of the Caliph f Ali. The neighbouring town of 'Abdasi, according to Yakut, was of Persian origin, that name being the Arabic form of the older Afdasahi, which had been a hamlet of the Kaskar district before the conquest. Kaskar and Maysan were the two districts of the eastern part of the Great Swamp, and Kaskar, according to Kazwim, produced much excellent rice which was exported. On its pastures buffaloes, oxen, and goats were fattened ; the reed- beds sheltered ducks and water-fowl that were snared and sent in to the markets of the surrounding towns, while in its canals the shad-fish (called Shabbut) was caught in great numbers, salted and exported. Further, in Maysan might be seen the tomb of the prophet £ Uzayr, otherwise Ezra, which Kazwini says was at a place settled entirely by Jews, who served the shrine. This was renowned throughout the countryside as a spot where prayers were answered, and in consequence the shrine was made rich by votive offerings 1 . The broad estuary formed by the combined Tigris and Euphrates waters, nearly a hundred miles in length, began at the exit of the Abu-l-Asad canal, and flowed out to the Persian Gulf at 'Abbadan. This estuary was variously known as the Blind Tigris (Dijlah-al- c Awra), or the Fayd (the estuary) of Basrah, and the Persians named it Bahmanshir; at the present day it is generally known as the Shatt-aPArab, ' the Arab River.' The tide from the Persian Gulf came up it, reaching as far north as the head of the channel at Madhar and 'Abdasi, also filling and emptying the numerous canals of Basrah, and those irrigating the lands east and west of the estuary. Basrah, the great commercial port of c Irak, lay close to the border of the desert, at some distance to the west of the estuary, with which it was in water communica tion by means of two canals. Both north and south of Basrah numerous canals drained the lower waters of the Great Swamp 1 I. R. 94, 185. I. S. 28. Kud. 240. Baladhuri, 293, 342.

[CHAP. into the Blind Tigris, and on the east side of the estuary several other canals came in, while a broad artificial channel called the Nahr Bayan, at a point about 30 miles above 4 Abbadan, joined the estuary of the Tigris with that of the Dujayl (the Karftn river), which flows down from the Khiizistan province into the Persian Gulf at Sulaymanan 1 . Al-Basrah—the name is said to mean ' the Black Pebbles'— was founded in the reign of c Omar in the year 17 (638), and its lands were divided among the Arab tribes who were then in garrison here after the conquest of the Sassanian empire. The city grew quickly to be, with Kflfah, one of the new capitals of Trak; and in the year 36 (656) near Basrah 'Ali gained the barren victory, the famous Battle of the Camel, over those who were responsible for the death of the Caliph 'Othman; in which battle Talhah and Zubayr, two well-known Companions of the Prophet, were slain. Basrah lay about 12 miles in a direct line from the Tigris estuary, being reached by two great canals, the Nahr Ma'kil from the N.E. down which ships came from Baghdad, and the Nahr-al-Ubullah by which the traffic passed from Basrah going S.E. to the Persian Gulf at c Abbadan. These two canals, with the waters of the estuary to the east for the third side, formed the Great Island as it was called; and the city of Ubullah stood at its S.E. angle, above where the Ubullah canal joined the estuary. Basrah city had its greatest length along the junction canal, of the two arms just named, and its houses extending westward in a semicircle reached the border of the desert, where a single gate called Bab-al-Badiyah (the Desert Gate) gave egress. The width of the city, from the canal bank to this gate, was in the 4th (10th) century three miles, but its length greatly exceeded this measure ment. The houses of the town were for the most part of kiln- burnt bricks, the walls were surrounded by rich pasture lands, 1 I. S. 28. The word 'Awrd, meaning 'blind of an eye,' is applied to rivers that have silted up, and to roads along which there is no thoroughfare. At first the name of the Blind Tigris appears to have been given to the 'Abdasi channel; and only at a later date to the lower estuary. Mas. Tanbih 52. Yak. i. 770. J. N. 454. This last gives the Tigris estuary under the name of the Shatt-al-'Arab.Ill] 'irAk. 45 watered by numerous minor canals, and beyond these lay extensive palm-groves. Mukaddasi states that Basrah had three Friday Mosques, one at the western gate, close on the desert, and this was the oldest; a second mosque, the finest, built with beautiful columns, stood in the chief market place, and it was 'unequalled among the mosques of all 'Irak'; the third was situated among the houses of the town. There were also three great market streets, full of shops and warehouses, and these equalled the Baghdad markets in extent. The Mirbad (the Kneeling-place for Camels) was the famous quarter at the western gate, where the desert caravans halted, and this was one of the busiest parts of the city. Near here were the shrines at the tombs of Talhah and Zubayr, but even when Mukaddasi wrote many quarters of the city had already gone to ruin 1 . Among other institutions, Mukaddasi mentioned a public library, which existed in Basrah during the 4th (10th) century, having been founded and endowed by a certain Ibn Sawwar, who had also provided the town of Ramhurmuz in Khiizistan with a similar institution. In both a stipend provided for the entertainment of students, and for the copying of books; and the number of these stored in the Basrah library was considerable. During the many wars and insurrections recorded in the history of the Abbasids Basrah suffered much. In 257 (871) when the great rebellion of the Zanj was at its height, their leader—who gave himself out as a descendant of the Caliph 'All—stormed Basrah, burnt the greater part of the town including the Great Mosque, and for three days his troops plundered the city. Then in 311 (923) Basrah was again sacked, and this time during 17 days, by the chief of the Carmathians. But the place in time partly regained its former opulence. In 443 (1052) it was visited by the Persian traveller Nasir-i-Khusraw, who describes it as most populous, the city wall being in good repair though many quarters of the town were still in ruin. The palace of the Caliph 'Ali near the Great Mosque still existed, and there were thirteen slirines recalling divers events of the days when 'Ali was in 1 The tomb of Zubayr is still marked by the ruins of that name which stand on the site of medieval Basrah. Modern Basrah, lying on the Tigris estuary, occupies the position of Ubullah at the exit of the canal.46 'irAk. [chap. residence here. Nasir also carefully enumerates the twenty districts surrounding the city. In s 1 ? (1123) the city wall, running half a league within the old line, was rebuilt by the Kadi 'Abd-as-Salam, and in the 8th (14th) century, after the Mongol invasion, when Ibn Bariltah was here, Basrah was still a very populous city. He speaks of the mosque of 'All, a fine tall edifice with seven minarets, which however was only opened for the Friday prayers and already stood two miles distant from the inhabited quarters of the town, being surrounded by ruins. The older city wall, lying two miles beyond this mosque, could still be traced, near which were the shrines of Talhah and Zubayr; but the town proper then con sisted of only three inhabited quarters. Mustawfi, writing in the same century, gives a long account of Basrah. Its mosque, which he reports had only been rebuilt by the Caliph 'AH, was the largest in Islam—and any mosque planned larger it was impossible ever to complete—and of this mosque All had set the Kiblah (or Mecca point) quite exactly in its right direction. Here, too, there was a minaret which shook or remained still according as an oath sworn to before it was true or false: a perpetual miracle established by the Caliph Ali who had built it. Mustawfi gives some further account of the Basrah shrines, and then speaks in high praise of the beautiful gardens and palm- groves surrounding the city, ' so thickly planted that you cannot see a hundred paces distant,' and the dates of so fine a quality that they were profitably exported to India and to China. Basrah had at all times been famous for its canals, which according to Ibn Hawkal, in the 4th (10th) century, exceeded 100,000 in number, and of these 20,000 were navigable for boats. The Nahr Ma'kil, already mentioned as the main chahnel from the direction of Baghdad, had been dug during the reign of 'Omar by Ma'kil ibn Yasar, a Companion of the Prophet. This and the Ubullah canal, going from Basrah towards the south-east, were each four leagues in length, and the gardens of the Ubullah canal along the south side of the Great Island were held to be one of the four earthly paradises 1 As generally reported (but different authorities give different lists) the other three were, the Ghawtah, or Garden Lands, of Damascus; the Sha'bIll] 'IRAK. 47 Al-Ubullah, the Arab form of the Greek Apologos, dated from Sassanian or even earlier times, but it lay on the estuary and was feverish, and the Moslems when they founded their new city, Basrah, built this further inland near the desert border. Ubullah, as already said, was to the north at the mouth of its canal, and on the Great Island. Opposite, on the south side of the canal, was the town called Shikk 'Othman, ' Othman's breach' in the dyke (he is said to have been a grandson of his namesake the third Caliph); and over against the canal mouth, but on the east side of the estuary, was the station whence those who had crossed the Tigris took the road for KMzistan. This was called Askar Abu Ja'far—' the Camp of Abu Ja'far,' in other words, of the Caliph Mansftr. Ubullah was in the 4th (10th) century a town of considerable size, having its own Friday Mosque, and the like was the case with Shikk 'Othman, both according to Mukaddasi being fine buildings. Nasir-i-Khusraw, who was here half a century later, speaks of the palaces, markets, and mosques of both towns as then in excellent state, but the Mongol inroad a couple of centuries later affected all this countryside, and Kazwini writing in the 7 th (13th) century describes these places as gone to ruin, though Shikk 'Othman was held famous for its great Sidr or lotus trees. In the next century Ibn Batutah describes Ubullah as a mere village, from which condition it has arisen in modern times by the building, on the older site, of New Basrah. Where the Nahr-al-Ubullah flowed into the Tigris estuary there had been a dangerous whirlpool, ships being often wrecked here in earlier times. According to Ibn Hawkal this peril to all mariners was done away with by a certain Abbasid princess some say Zubaydah—who, loading many ships with stones, sunk them at this spot, and thus blocked the whirlpool. Ibn Serapion carefully enumerates the nine canals which came into the Tigris estuary on the western side; namely, three above the Nahr Ma'kil, and four south of Basrah, between the Ubullah canal and the Bavvan, or Vale of Bavvan, in Fars, which will be described in Chapter XVIII • and lastly the Wadi-as-Sughd, or Valley of Soghdiana, lying between Samar kand and Bukhart, which will be mentioned in Chapter XXXIII. 1st. 80.

The only one of these canals which is of importance is the Nahr Abu-l-Khasib—so called after a certain freedman of the Caliph Mansur—on which in the middle years of the 3rd (9th) century the great stronghold of the Zanj rebels was built. This city, which they named Al-Mukhtarah, was so strongly fortified as to resist for a considerable time the armies sent against it by the Abbasid Caliph, and it was only after fifteen years of continuous warfare that the rebellion of the Zanj was finally crushed 1 . The chief canals on the eastern side of the Tigris estuary, according to Ibn Serapion, were the following. First the Rayyan, on or near which lay the two towns of Al-Maftah and Ad-Daskarah (the Flat-land); the exact position of these is unknown, though the first-named town was of sufficient importance for the estuary to be often named the Tigris of Al-Maftah. Below this was the Nahr Bayan, with the town of Bayan lying at its mouth five leagues distant from Ubullah on the opposite side of the estuary. The port of Muhammarah on the Haffar channel occupies its site at the present day, this channel connecting the upper reach of the Tigris estuary with that of the Dujayl (Karfm). Mukaddasi, writing three-quarters of a century later than Ibn Serapion, says that this channel, four leagues in length, was widened and dug out by the order of Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid. Already in the previous century it is spoken of by Kudamah under the name of the New Canal (An-Nahr-al-Jadid), and it was navigable for cargo- boats coming to Basrah from Ahwaz, which before the widening of the 'Adudi channel (as Mukaddasi calls it) had had to pass down the Dujayl estuary, out to sea, and then up the Tigris estuary past Bayan to Ubullah 2 . The great island between the two estuaries which YakCit names (in Persian) Miyan Rudan (Betwixt the Rivers) is described by Mukaddasi as a Sabkhah or salt-marsh, with the town of 'Abbadan on the seaboard at one angle, and Sulaymanan at the other angle on the Dujayl estuary. Abbadan still exists, but now lies up the 1 1st. 8r. Baladhuri, 362. I. H. 160, 161. Muk. 118, 135. I. S. 29, 30. N. K. 89. Kaz. ii. 190. Yak. ii. 675. I. B. ii. 17. Tabari, iii. 1982. 2 I. S. 30. I.

It was inhabited by mat-weavers, who used the Haifa grass of the island for their trade; and there were great guard-houses round the town for the protection of the mouth of the estuary. Nasir-i-Khusraw, who was here in 438 (1047), says that in his day the low tide left a couple of leagues dry between 'Abbadan and the sea, and to serve as a lighthouse' to warn mariners they had built a scaffolding with great beams of teak-wood, very broad below and narrowing above, 40 yards in height, which was known as the Khashab (Wood-works). On its summit was the watchman's cabin, and the platform being stone-flagged and supported on arches was used at night for a brasier where a beacon-fire was lighted. Abbadan was still a flourishing town in the 7th (13th) century with many mosques and Rubats (guard houses), but in the next century when Ibn Batutah passed through, it had sunk to the size of a village and already was three miles distant from the coast-line. Mustawfi, however, the contem porary of Ibn Batutah, speaks of Abbadan as a considerable port, and states that its revenues, which amounted to 441,000 dinars in the currency of his day, were paid in to the Basrah treasury. The harbour of Sulaymanan, a few leagues east of Abbadan, was often counted as of the Khtizistan province, and all that is recorded of it appears to be the fact that it was founded by a certain Sulayman ibn Jabir, surnamed 'the Ascetic 1 .' Returning to the latitude of Baghdad the towns lying along the Tigris to the north of the capital as far as the limits of 'Irak have now to be described, with those which stood near the bank of the great Nahrawan canal. As already said (see p. 32) the 1 Baladhuri, 364. 1st. go. I. H. 173. Muk. 118. Kaz. ii. 280. N. K. 89, 90. Yak. iv. 708. I. B. ii. r8. Mst. 137. Mas. i. 230. Yakut (i. 645) notes that the people of Basrah had the habit of turning proper-names into place-names by the terminal syllable dv e.g. ' the Talhah canal.' This explains the forms Sulaymanan and 'Abbadan, the latter being called after a certain 'Abbad. The shore line at the mouth of the Tigris estuary advances at the rate of about 72 feet in the year, or a mile and a half in the century; hence the present inland position of 'Abbadan. ll£ s* ^5° 'IRAK. [CHAP. chief high road from Baghdad to Mosul and the northern towns went along the left or eastern bank of the Tigris. It left East Baghdad by the Baradan Gate of the Shammasiyah quarter, and in about four leagues reached the small town of Al-Baradan, which still exists under the slightly altered form of Badran. Close to Baradan were two other important villages, Bazugha and Al-Mazrafah, the latter lying three leagues above Baghdad. At Ar-Rashidiyah near Baradan the Khalis canal joined the Tigris, as will be explained presently; and immediately above this, at the present day, ends a great bend of the Tigris to the eastward, which bend begins at Kadisiyah 60 miles north of Baghdad. The river bed, however, during the middle-ages took an almost straight line from Kadisiyah to Baradan, and the ruins still exist on the eastern side of the dry channel, the names being marked on the map, of towns mentioned by Ibn Serapion and other early authorities. The bed of the Tigris would indeed appear to have changed here more than once. What is the present (eastern) channel of the river the author of the Marasid, writing about the year 700 (1300), speaks of as the Shutaytah or 'Lesser Stream'; and one of the great alterations must have taken place during the reign of the Caliph Mustansir, namely between the years 623 and 640 {1226 to 1242), for it is chronicled that he dug many canals to irrigate the lands left dry by the shifting of the main stream. As early as the 4th (10th) century also, Mas'udi speaks of law-suits, to which this changing of the Tigris bed had given rise, between the landowners on the eastern and western banks above Baghdad. Of these towns then lying on the east bank of the Tigris (their ruins being now found on the dry channel far to the westward of the present river) one of the best known was 'Ukbara, close to which lay Awana, and then Busra further down stream, the three places standing some 10 leagues from Baghdad. They lay surrounded by gardens, to which pleasure-seekers from the capital resorted, and Mukaddasi especially praises the grapes of 'Ukbara, which he says was a large and populous town. A short distance above 'Ukbara was 'Alth or Al-'Alth, which is still marked on our maps, but now of the western bank, and Mukaddasi describes this as a large and very populous city, lying on a branch canal from the Tigris.Ill] 'irAk. 5i North-west of 'Alth, where the river at the present day turns eastward for the great bend, stands Kadisiyah of the Tigris—not to be confused with the place of the same name to the west of the Euphrates. It was famous for its glass-works, and opposite to it the Dujayl canal branched from the Tigris going south'. The Dujayl canal (this also not to be confounded with the Dujayl river, the Karun), as will be explained in the next chapter, had originally been a channel from the Euphrates to the Tigris, but by the beginning of the 4th (10th) century its western part had become silted up, and its eastern and lower course was then kept clear by a new channel, taken from the Tigris immediately below Kadisiyah. The Dujayl—meaning ' the Little Tigris ' watered all the rich district of Maskin lying to the north of West Baghdad beyond Katrabbul. The later Dujayl was therefore a loop-canal of the Tigris, which it rejoined opposite 'Ukbara after throwing off a number of branches, some of which ran so far south as to bring water to the Harbiyah, the great northern suburb of West Baghdad (see above, p. 31). The district of the Dujayl, otherwise called Maskin, included a great number of villages and towns, lying westward of 'Ukbara and the Tigris channel, the chief of which was Harba, which was visited by Ibn Jubayr in 580 (1184) and still exists. Here may be seen at the present day the ruins of a great stone bridge across the canal which, as the historian Fakhn records and the extant inscription still testifies, was built by the Caliph Mustansir in 629 (1232). Near Harba was Al-Hazirah (the Enclosure), where the cotton stuffs called Kirbas were manufactured, being largely exported. Yakut further names a considerable number of v illa ges —there were over a hundred in all—which were of this district, and many of these, as for example Al-Balad (the Hamlet) near Hazirah, are still to be found on the map. As late as the 8th (14th) century the Dujayl district, with Harba for its chief town, is described by Mustawfi as of amazing fertility, and its pomegranates were the best to be found in the markets of Baghdad. 1 Kud. 214.

About ten miles above Kadisiyah is Samarra, which will be described in the next chapter, and Matirah lay half-way between the two, immediately above where three small canals branched from the left (east) bank of the Tigris. Midway between Matirah and Kadisiyah, below the exit of these canals, stood Barkuwara, otherwise Balkuwara, or Bazkuwar. The village of Al-Matirah, according to Yakut, had derived its name from a certain Matar of the Shayban tribe, who was a notable man of the Kharijite sect, and it had been originally called Al-Matariyah, this in time becoming corrupted to Al-Matirah 1 . Ten miles north again of Samarra was Karkh Firuz, also called Karkh of Samarra, to distinguish it from Karkh the southern quarter of West Baghdad, and further to the north lay Dur, where the great Nahrawan canal branched from the left bank of the Tigris. At this point, but from the right or western bank of the Tigris, began the Ishaki canal which making a short loop rejoined the river again opposite Matirah. The positions of all these places are fixed by the canals, some of them, in ruin, also still exist, but nothing is known of them beyond their names. 1 Ykb. 265. I. S. 14. I. J. 233.

Samarra, which for more than half a century and during the reigns of seven Caliphs, from 221 to 279 (836 to 892), became the Abbasid capital, had existed as a town before the Arab conquest, and long after it had fallen from its temporary pre-eminence continued to be an important city. The name in Aramaean is written Samarra, which the Caliph Mu'tasim,when he took up his residence here changed, officially, to Surra-man-raa, 'for good augury,' these words in Arabic signifying ' Who sees it, rejoices.' Under this form it is a mint city on Abbasid coins; but the name was pronounced in many different ways, six forms are cited by Ibn Khallikan, Samarra being that most commonly used, and the one selected by Yakut as the heading to his article on this city. Ya'kubi writing at the close of the 3rd (9th) century has left us a long and detailed account of Samarra and its palaces, for the seven Caliphs who lived here, mostly as the prisoners of their Turk bodyguard, occupied their enforced leisure in building, and in laying out pleasure-grounds. The city proper stood on the eastern bank of the Tigris and extended with its palaces for a distance of seven leagues along the river. On the western bank also many palaces were built, each Caliph in succession spending fabulous sums on new pleasure-grounds. The land where the54 'irak. [chap. Caliph Mu^asim (a younger son of Harun-ar-Rashid) built his first palace when he came to settle at Samarra in 221 (836) belonged to a Christian monastery {Dayr) which was bought for 4000 dinars (^2000) and it was known as At-Tirhan. His Turk body guard were granted fiefs at Karkh, and further up stream to D6r, some also lay south of Samarra towards Matirah; and the Caliph proceeded to build the first Friday Mosque near the east bank of the Tigris, and lay the foundations of his palace. Artificers were brought together from all parts of the empire, and immense quantities of teak-wood {Sdj) were imported, also palm beams from Basrah and divers marbles from Antioch and Laodicea. A thoroughfare called the Great Road (Ash-Shari^al-A'zam) was laid out along the Tigris bank, being bordered by the new palaces and the fiefs, and this road went from Matirah right up to Karkh, many by-roads and market streets branching from it. The new Treasury and Government Offices also were built, and the Great Hall called Dar-al- £ Ammah (the Public Audience Chamber) where the Caliph sat in state on Mondays and Thursdays. Besides his palace in Samarra, Mu'tasim laid out a pleasance on the west side of the Tigris opposite the new capital, with which it was connected by a bridge of boats, and the gardens were planted with palms brought up from Basrah, and with exotics sent for from provinces as far distant as Syria and Khurasan. These lands on the western side were irrigated by branch canals from the Nahr-al-Ishaki, already mentioned, which was dug by Ishak ibn Ibrahim, Chief of Police to Mu'tasim, and this was more especially the district called Tirhan, which Ya'kubi speaks of as c the plain ? of Samarra. When the Caliph Mu'tasim died in 227 (842) Samarra was in a fair way to rival Baghdad in the grandeur of its palaces and public buildings. His two sons Wathik and Mutawakkil, who became Caliphs in turn, completed the work of their father. Harun-al-Wathik built the palace, called after his name the Kasr-al-Haruni, on the Tigris bank, and at either end of this, east and west, was a great platform. Wathik also dug a harbour from the river, where cargo-boats coming up from Baghdad might conveniently unload. He was succeeded by his brother Ja c far-al-Mutawakkil in 232 (847) who at first lived in the Hanini palace, but in 245 (859) he began to build himself aIV ] 'IRAK. 55 new palace three leagues north of Karkh, to which he extended the Great Road, and this with the new town which sprang up round it was called Al-Mutawakkiliyah or the Kasr-al-Ja'fari. The ruins of the Ja'fari palace still exist in the angle formed by the branching of the Nahrawan canal, and the older town of Al- MaMzah came to be incorporated with it. Mutawakkil also built a new and more magnificent Friday Mosque to replace that of his father, which had become too small for the population of the new capital, for the houses now extended in a continuous line with palaces and gardens from Matirah to Dur. In his palace of the Mutawakkiliyah, otherwise called the Ja'fariyah, Mutawakkil was murdered by his son Muntasir in 247 (861), and, during the troublous times that followed, the four next Caliphs had their abode at the Kasr-al- Jawsak (the Palace of the Kiosque) on the western side of the Tigris opposite Samarra, this being one of those built by Mu^asim. Mu'tamid, son of Mutawakkil, and the last of the Caliphs to reside at Samarra, lived first at the Jawsak, but afterwards built himself a new palace on the eastern bank, known as Kasr-al-Ma'shuk (the Palace of the Beloved), from whence he finally removed the seat of Government to Baghdad a short time before his death in 279 (892). The names of many other palaces are given by our authorities. Ibn Serapion for instance mentions the celebrated Kasr-al-Jiss (the Gypsum Palace) built by Mu^asim on the Ishaki canal; and Yakut, who names a great number of palaces, adds a long account of the almost fabulous prices which each had cost its builder, and the total he makes to be 204 million dirhams, equivalent to about eight million sterling. The glory of Samarra, however, naturally came to an end with the return of the Caliphs to Baghdad, and its many palaces rapidly fell to ruin. In the 4th (10th) century Ibn Hawkal praises its magnificent gardens, especially those on the western side of the Tigris, but Mukaddasi says that Karkh on the north was, in his day, become the more populous quarter of the town. The great Friday Mosque of Samarra, however, still remained, which Mukaddasi says was the equal of that of Damascus in magnificence. Its walls were covered with enamelled tiles (mind), it was paved with marble, and its roof was supported on56 f IRAK. [CHAP. marble columns. The minaret was remarkable for its great height, and, Yakut asserts, it had been the minaret of the first mosque, having been built by Mu'tasim, who wished the Call to Prayer to be audible over all the city. It was visible from a league distance all round. It is apparently this ancient minaret which still exists as the well-known Malwiyah tower, having a spiral outside stairway going to the top, which stands about half a mile to the north of modern Samarra; such was in any case the belief of Mustawfi who, in the early part of the 8th (14th) century, says that the minaret then existing of the Friday Mosque was 170 ells ( Gez) in height, f with the gangway going up outside, the like of which was to be seen nowhere else,' and he adds that the Caliph Mu'tasim had been its builder. Later authorities add little to our knowledge of Samarra, and in after years it came chiefly to be inhabited by Shi £ ahs; for here were the tombs of the tenth and eleventh Imams, ^li-al-'Askari and his son Al-Hasan, and here above all, said they, was the mosque with the underground chamber where the twelfth Imam had disappeared in 264 (878), he being Al-Kaim, the promised Mahdi, who was to reappear in the fulness of time. The shrines where these Alids were buried stood in that part of Samarra called £ Askar Mu^asim, 'the Camp of Mu'tasim,' and it is from this that the tenth Imam had his title of Al-^Askari. Writing in the early part of the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi, the Shi'ah, especially mentions these shrines, and adds that the Friday Mosque near by these tombs, besides its great minaret already referred to, was possessed of a famous stone basin called Kas-i-Fir'awn (Pharaoh's Cup) measuring 23 paces in circum ference by 7 ells high, and half an ell in thickness, which stood in the mosque court for the Ablution, and which the Caliph Mu c tasim had caused to be made. Mustawfi, however, adds that, in his day, Samarra was for the most part a ruin, only in part inhabited, and this statement is confirmed by the description left us by his contemporary Ibn Battitah, who was here in the year 730 (1330) 1 . 1 Baladhuri, 297, 298.

Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century states that the majority of its population were Christians, and that they possessed a great monastery here. Mukaddasi says the wool-workers of this town were famous, and in its neighbourhood much sesame was grown; Mustawfi adds, also water melons, of which three crops a year were produced in spite of the somewhat raw climate of Takrit. Ibn Jubayr states that the city wall was 6000 paces in circuit, with towers in good repair, when he passed through Takrit in 580 (1184), and Ibn Batutah gives praise to both its markets and its numerous mosques 1 . The great Nahrawan canal left the Tigris a short distance below Dllr, as already said, and in its upper course was known as A 1-Katul-al-Kisrawi, c the Cut of the Chosroes,' for it owed its origin to the Sassanian kings. It served to irrigate all the lands * along the east bank of the Tigris from above Samarra to about a hundred miles south of Baghdad, and Ibn Serapion mentions a great number of towns along its banks with bridges and weirs, but most of these have now disappeared, though the line of the canal is still marked on the map. Leaving Dur 2 , which, for distinction among the many towns of this name, was called Dur-al- £ Arabaya or of Al-Harith, the canal passed to the back of the Mutawakkiliyah and other outlying quarters north of Samarra, and here it was crossed by a stone bridge. It next came to Itakhiyah, a village and fief called after Itakh the Turk, sometime captain of the guard to the Caliph Mu'tasim; this had originally been a monastery called Dayr Abu-Sufrah, and here stood the bridge of the Chosroes (Kantarah Kisrawiyah). The monastery took its name from Abu Sufrah the Kharijite. Next the Nahrawan came to Al-Muhammadiyah, a small town, where it was crossed by a bridge of skiffs (Jisr Zawarik) 3 , and according to 1 1st. 77. I. H. 156. Muk. 123. I. J. 234. Mst. 138. I. B. ii. 133. 2 Dilr means the houses' or habitations,' and is a common place-name, being the plural form of Ddrah, ' a homestead.' 3 It is to be noted that in the classical usage Jisr stands for 4 a bridge of oatS) while ^^ct/'yitQ/ycLh- is 'a masonry bridge of arches.' Shddhurwdn, trans-58 'irAk. [chap. Yak6t this Muhammadiyah was but a later name of Itakhiyah, the change having been effected by Mutawakkil in honour of his son Muhammad-al-Muntasir, who afterwards became Caliph by the murder of his father. At some distance below these places the Nahrawan was joined successively by the three lesser Katuls, namely the YahMi, the Mamtini, and the canal of Abu-l-Jund, which were all three taken from the left bank of the Tigris near Matirah below Samarra, and which irrigated the fertile districts south of that city. Above their inflow, the Nahrawan was dammed back by the first of its many weirs (Ash-Shadhurwan), and where the first canal came in stood the large village of Al-Mamtimyah. This, the YahMi (or Jews') canal, was crossed between Matirah and Mamuniyah by a stone bridge called Kantarah Wasif, after Wasif, one of the captains of the Turk bodyguard, in the reign of Mu'tasim. The second canal, called Al-Mamtini, fell into the Nahrawan below the village of Al- Kanatir, 'the Bridges.' The third canal was called Abu-l-Jund— £ Father, or Supplier, of the Army'—from the fact that the crops raised on the lands watered by it were used as rations for the troops. It was the largest canal of the three, and had been dug by Harun-ar-Rashid, who built a palace there while superintending its construction. On its banks stood the town of Taffir, and here it was crossed by a bridge of boats. Yaklit, who had himself visited Taffir, describes it as occupying in the 7th (13th) century a waterless and pastureless plain, where wild animals dwelt, lying between Ba'ldiba and Dakuka. He passed through this going from Baghdad to Irbil; no habitations were to be met with, and Yaktit says that his guide, when the caravan travelled by night over this plain, 'was wont to take his direction by the Pole-star, until, with the day, the plain had been crossed.' lated by 'weir,' more properly designates a portion of a canal, or river bed, that has been paved and embanked to confine the stream. It should, however, be added that Jisr undoubtedly sometimes also designated a stone bridge of arches, as in the celebrated Jisr-al-Walid, the name given to the bridge over the river Sarus, between Adana and Mopsuestia, which was built by Justinian. The word Kantarah also designates any arched structure, as a viaduct or aqueduct, being borrowed from the Byzantines, who used the word K&amp;Tpov (the Latin centrum) to denote the central arch of a bridge, and by extension applied it to mean the whole structure.IV] 59 Four leagues below where the last of these three canals joined the Nahrawan lay the town of Sula or Salwa, otherwise called Bab Salwa or Basalwa. Below this again was the town of Ba'kuba, some ten leagues north of Baghdad, and the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district. At Ba'kuba the Great Katul canal changed its name, and became the Tamarra, under which name it passed on to Bajisra and thence to the city called Jisr Nahrawan, beyond which the main waterway was more especially known as the Nahrawan canal. Near Bajisra (the Aramaic form of Bayt-al-Jisr, ' the bridge-house') which stood in a well cultivated district, surrounded by palm-trees, the Tamarra sent off a branch from its right bank known as the Nahr-al-Khalis, which flowed out into the Tigris at Baradan to the north of Baghdad, and from the Khalis many of the canals of East Baghdad derived their water. Jisr Nahrawan, the Bridge-town, where the Khurasan road from Baghdad crossed, will be described presently; and here a canal called the Nahr Bin branched from the right bank of the Nahrawan, flowing ultimately into the Tigris at Kalwadha. From this the water channels of the lower quarters of East Baghdad derived their supply. One mile below Jisr Nahrawan the Diyala canal branched south from the main stream, and after irrigating the outer gardens of East Baghdad, reached the Tigris three miles below the capital. South of Jisr Nahrawan the great canal took the name of the Nahrawan exclusively, and after passing the Upper Weir (Shadhurwan) it came to Jisr Bilran, the bridge named after the wife of the Caliph Mamun. Below this stood Yarzatiyah (or possibly Barzatiya), and then the town of 'Abarta, which Yaktit describes as of Persian origin, having important markets. Beyond 'Abarta lay the Lower Weir and next Iskaf (or Uskaf) of the Bam Junayd, a city lying on both banks of the canal, and the Bani Junayd, Yakiit reports, had been chiefs of this district and famous for their hospitality. Yaktit adds that by the 7th (13th) century, when he wrote, the lands round here had entirely gone out of cultivation, for the Nahrawan had gradually silted up during the previous two centuries, the Saljuk Sultans having ever■ 60 'irAk. [chap. been too much occupied with their wars to attend to the needful dredging, and the mending of dykes: further,' he adds, 'their armies had made a roadway of this same canal, whereby both district and canal have now gone to ruin.' Beyond Uskaf the Nahrawan flowed on for nearly 60 miles, between a continuous line of villages and farmsteads, down to Madharaya where its waters finally rejoined the Tigris. Madha- raya, as already said, stood to the south of Jabbul and above Al-Mubarak, which lay opposite the town of Nahr Sabus. When Yaktit wrote it was in ruin, and its name is now no longer marked on the map, but it must have stood just below the present Ktit-al-'Amarah where, as already explained, the Tigris now divides off from the Shatt-al-Hayy channel 1 . This triple division of the Nahrawan canal (namely the Kattll, the Tamarra, and the Nahrawan proper), with the three branch canals (the Khalis, the Nahr Bin, and the Diyala) which flowed back to the Tigris after watering the East Baghdad region, is the explanation which Ibn Serapion has given of a very complicated skein of waterways. In later times the names were not always applied as he gives them. A glance at the present map shows that the Nahrawan, two hundred miles in length, must have taken up all the streams from the Persian highlands which, had it not been dug, would have flowed (at flood time) down to the left bank of the Tigris. The Tamarra section was originally one of these streams, and Yakftt describes how its bed had been artificially paved for a length of seven leagues to prevent the sands absorbing its waters, which were divided up to irrigate the several districts of East Baghdad. The Khalis and the Diyala were according to his account branches of the Tamarra (in any case the Khalis of the Arab geographers cannot be the river known by this name at the present day, for this now flows at some distance to the north-west of Ba'Mba), and Khalis in the time of Yaktit was the name of the district, to the north of the Khurasan road, which on one side came right up to the walls 1 Yarzatiyah is possibly the present Razatiyah or Zatariyah lying above 'Abarta.

In the 3rd (9th) century Ibn Rustah and Ibn Khurdadbih give Nahrawan as the name of the mountain stream, which came into the Great Katiil at Salwa; in the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi writes that the Nahrawan was the name of the Diyala river, which rose in the mountains of Kurdistan, and which was formed by the junction of two streams, one the Shirwan river which lower down was called the Taymarra, the other the Hulwan river, which flowed down past Kasr Shmn and Khanikin; and these two streams united above Ba'kiiba where they flowed into the Nahrawan canal. In regard to Nahrawan town, otherwise called Jisr Nahrawan (Nahrawan Bridge), this was the first stage out of Baghdad along the great Khurasan road, and it was of old a place of much importance, though now represented by the insignificant hamlet of Sifwah. Ibn Rustah in the 3rd (9th) century describes Nahrawan town as lying on both banks of the canal; in the western half were the chief markets, a Friday Mosque, and many waterwheels for irrigation purposes ; while on the eastern side there was a second Friday Mosque, and other markets, with many hostelries round the mosque where the Mecca pilgrims and travellers were wont to put up. Ibn Hawkal in the following century speaks of the fertile lands lying round the town, and Mukaddasi adds that the eastern part in his day was the most populous, its Friday Mosque being then the only one in use. In the 8th (14th) century, when Mustawfi wrote, Nahrawan town was in ruin, for the Khurasan road no longer passed through it, but went north by Ba'kdba. The fertile district about here was still called the Tarik-i-Khurasan (the District of the Khurasan road) of which Ba 4 Mba, Mustawfi states, was the chief town, and it was formed by a continuous line of gardens and palm-groves from which magnificent crops of oranges and shaddocks were harvested 1 . The town of Baraz-ar-Rtiz (the Rice Field), now known as Bilad-ar-Riiz, lay north-east of Nahrawan town, and is frequently mentioned by YaMt. The Caliph Mu c tadid had built a palace here; it was counted as of the Tamarra district, and lay eastward 1 I. R. 90, 163. I. K. 175. 1st. 86. I. H. 167. Muk. 12). Yak. i, 812 ; ii. 390, 638. Mst. 139, 141, 216.62 'irAk. [chap. off the Khurasan high road, being also noticed by Mustawfi. Leaving Nahrawan town the next stage of the Khurasan road was Daskarah-al-Malik, ' of the King,' which Ibn Rustah describes as a considerable city, possessing a great walled castle of Sassanian times, to which a single gateway on the west side gave access. From its position this 'Daskarah of the King' appears to be identical with the celebrated Dastagird, where Khusraw Parwiz had his great palace, which history relates was plundered and burnt to the ground by Heraclius in 628 a.d. This palace, the ruins of which it would seem were in the 4th (10th) century still known as Dastagird Kisrawiyah (of the Chosroes), was seen by the traveller Ibn Muhalhal (quoted by Yakut) who says that it then consisted of a wonderful edifice containing many halls and domes, so finely built as to appear carved, each wall in a single block of stone. In regard to the Arab town, Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes Daskarah as possessing a strong castle, doubtless of Moslem foundation, and Mukaddasi speaks of the place as a small market town, with a Friday Mosque that had a finely vaulted roof. Not far distant from Daskarah was the village of Shahraban, mentioned by both Yakut and Mustawfi, the latter adding that eighty villages belonged to this town, which had been founded by Princess Gulban, a daughter of one of the Chosroes. The town of JalMa was the next stage on the Khurasan road, surrounded by many trees but unfortified. Not far from the town, standing in the village of Hariiniyah, was an ancient bridge of stone wrought with leaden joints, which had been built by one of the Chosroes, and this crossed the river by which, according to Yakut, boats went down to Ba'ktiba and Bajisra. In history Jaldla was famous for the great victory gained over the Persians by the Moslems here in the year 16 (637), which resulted in the final overthrow and flight of King Yazdajird. At a later date Mustawfi names the place Rubat JaKila, from the guard-house which had been built here by Malik Shah the Saljflk; and the position of Jalula corresponds with the modern station of Kizil Rubat, ' the Red Guard-house.' East of Jalula was the town of Khanikin, which is noticed by Mukaddasi as a city on the road to Hulwan. Here Ibn Rustah says thereIV] 'IRAK. 63 was a great bridge of many arches over the river, built of well- mortared kiln-bricks. Near I£hanijdn__w as a naphtha spring that produced_a__large revenue, and Yakut describes the bridge afore said as having 24 arches in his day, the 7th (13th) century, across which passed the Khurasan road. When Mustawfi wrote in the next century Khanikin had fallen to ruin, and was merely a large village, but its district was still extremely productive. Six leagues beyond Khanikin, and half-way to Hulwan the first town of the Jibal province, lay Kasr SMrin, 'the Palace of Shirin,' the mistress of King Khusraw Parwiz. There was a large walled village here, and the ruins of the Sassanian palace, which Ibn Rustah describes as consisting in the 3rd (9th) century of a mighty arched hall, built of burnt brick, rising in the midst of chambers, the walls of which were of solid masonry. Further there was a great platform before the arched hall, paved with marble slabs. Yakut and Mustawfi give long descriptions of Kasr Shirin, the ruins of which still exist; and it is to be noted that the legends of Farhad the lover of Queen Shirin, and of Pahlabadh the musician, and of Shabdiz the famous horse of King Parwiz, are found localised in many places of the surrounding district 1 . Over hanging Kasr Shirin is the great mountain wall forming the outpost of the Persian plateau, and Hulwan, the next stage on the Khurasan road, though often counted as of 'Irak, being in the mountain pass, will be described in a later chapter. South of the line of the Khurasan road, and on the Khtlzistan frontier, two important towns remain to be noticed—Bandanijin and Bayat. Bandanijin, a name no longer found on the map, was the chief town of the districts of Badaraya arid Bakusaya, and the village of Bakusaya still exists near which the town of Bandanijin must have been situated. The two districts lay beyond and north-east of the Nahrawan canal, and comprised a great number of fertile villages. Bandanijin the capital, according to Yakut, was called in Persian Wandanigan, and Mustawfi says in his day the name was pronounced Bandanigan, being of the Lihf district, the 'Foot-hills' of the Kurdistan mountains, and its river came down from Ariwajan. According to Ibn 1 I. R. 164. 1st. 87. I. H. 168. Muk. 121. Kaz. ii. 295. Yak. i. 534; ii. 107, 393, 573, 575, 813 ; iv. 112. Mst. 137, 138, 139, 193.64 'irAk. [chap. Khurdadbih Bandanijin was counted as of the same district as Baraz-ar-Rilz. Bayat, the ruins of which still exist, is mentioned by Mustawfi; he adds that its river, which rose in the Kurdistan mountains, became lost in the plains before reaching the Tigris, and though its water was brackish, many fertile districts were irrigated by it. Bayat appears to be practically the same place as the town of At-Tib, mentioned by Ibn Hawkal, where excellent belts, like the Armenian belts, were made. It was a city of some importance under the Abbasids, and its ruins lie close to those of the later town of Bayat. Yakut says that in his day the inhabitants of Tib were Nabathseans, and still spoke their Aramaic dialect, tracing their descent direct from Seth, son of Adam 1 . The cities of 'Irak which lay on the Euphrates, and between the two rivers along the transverse canals, must now be described. As already said, a line carried west from the Tigris at Takrit to the Euphrates would cross that river a little below 'Anah, where its course makes a great bend south, and this is the natural frontier between Jazirah and 'Irak, as marked by Mustawfi. To the south of this line begins the Sawad, or alluvial land, of Babylonia; to the north lie the more stony plains of Upper Mesopotamia. The city of Al-Hadithah on the Euphrates, about 35 miles below 'Anah, is the northernmost town on this side. The name signifies 'the New Town,' and to distinguish it from Al-Hadithah on the Tigris, it was called Hadithah-an-Nurah, 'of the Chalk' pit. Yakut describes it as possessing a strong castle surrounded by the waters of the Euphrates, and it was founded during the Caliphate of 'Omar, not long after the Moslem conquest. Mustawfi describes it as in every way the opposite of Takrit, both in situation and climate. Between Hadithah and Hit, down stream, came the two towns of Aklsah and An-Nawusah, lying on the Euphrates seven leagues distant one from the other, and Alusah, which Yakut refers to as a small town, still exists. Both are frequently mentioned in the records of the Moslem conquest; 1 I. K. 6. 1st. 94. I. H. 176. Yak. i. 230, 459, 477, 745; iii. 566; iv. 353. Mst. 137, 138, 220. The Badaraya district of Bandanijin must not be confused with Baduraya, the name of the southern district of West Baghdad.IV] 'irAk. 65 further, An-Nawusah was counted as a village of Hit, which last was a walled town with a strong castle, celebrated for its palm- groves and lying on the western side of the Euphrates. Ibn Hawkal speaks of Hit as very populous, and Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century describes more than 30 villages, among the rest Jibbah, as of its dependencies. Immense quantities of fruit, both of the cold and the hot regions, were grown here; nuts, dates, oranges and egg-plants all ripening freely, but the town was unpleasant to live in on account of the overpowering stench of the neighbouring bitumen springs. At the time of the Moslem conquest the famous Trench of King Sapor II (Khandak Sabur) still existed . This had been dug by Sab ur Dhu-l-Aktaf, as the Arabs called him, in theJfourth] . centu ry aTi ).-. It began at Hit and ran down to Ubullah (near the later Basrah) where it reached the Gulf. Originally it carried water, being intended as a line of defence for the rich lands of Lower Mesopotamia against the desert tribes; and its dry bed may still, in part, be traced. 'Ayn-at-Tamr, 'the Spring of the Date Palm,' due south of Hit in the desert, is described by Mukaddasi as a small fortress, and a stream running from here entered the Euphrates below Hit. Dates and sugar-cane were exported from its district, the latter more especially from a neighbouring town called Shafatha; but the exact site of these two places is unknown 1 . Twelve leagues below Hit was the village of Ar-Rabb, where previous to the 4th (10th) century the (earlier) Dujayl canal left the Euphrates; and taking its course due east, after watering the Maskin and Katrabbul districts, reached the northern suburbs of West Baghdad. As already mentioned, this western portion of the Dujayl soon became silted up; and by the time when Istakhri wrote in 340 (951) the Dujayl already took its waters from the Tigris opposite Kadisiyah, as described in the paragraphs on the Maskin district. Al-Anbar, 'the Granaries,' standing on the left bank of the Euphrates, was one of the great cities of 'Irak in Abbasid times. It dated from before the Moslem conquest, and by the Persians was called Firuz Sabur (or Fayruz Sabur, in 1 i. S. 10, 13. i. R. 107. Kud. 217. Baladhuri, 179. 1st. 77. L h. 155. Muk. 117, 123, 135.

Greek Perisabor) from its founder King Shaptir 1 ; and under the Arabs Firiiz Sabiir became the name of the surrounding district. It is said that the town was called ' the Granaries' because of old the Persian kings had stored the wheat, barley, and straw for the rations of their troops in this city. The first Abbasid Caliph, Saffah, had for a time made Anbar his residence, and he died in the palace which he had built here. His brother Manstir also for a time lived at Anbar, and from here went to Baghdad, where the new Abbasid capital had begun to be built. Mustawfi gives the tradition that the Jews whom Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem to Babylonia were interned at Anbar. In the 8th (T4th) century the town walls, he says, were 5000 paces in circuit. The importance of Anbar lay in its position at the head of the first great navigable canal which flowed from the Euphrates to the Tigris, which it entered at the harbour (Al-Fardah) to the south of the Round City of West Baghdad. This canal, the Nahr f isa, took its name from an Abbasid prince Tsa who was either Tsa ibn Miisa, nephew of Manstir, or Tsa ibn 'Ali (the more usual ascription), the uncle of that Caliph. In either case Prince Tsa gave the canal its name, he having re-dug it, making thus a navigable channel from the Euphrates into Baghdad. Where the canal left the Euphrates, a little below Anbar, it was crossed by a magnificent bridge, called Kantarah Dimimma, from the village of Dimimma which was on the Euphrates bank close to the hamlet of Al-FaMjah. The Nahr Tsa, passing by many villages and farms of the Firiiz SaMr district, at length came to the town of Al-Muhawwal, one league distant from the suburbs of West Baghdad. Just before reaching this town the Sarat canal branched from the left bank of the Nahr Tsa, and this canal formed the dividing line between the Katrabbul district to the north and Badiiraya to the south of West Baghdad. The Sarat canal, following an almost parallel curve to the Nahr Tsa, poured its waters into the Tigris immediately below the Basrah Gate of the Round City, and from these two streams all the watercourses 1 Sabur is the Arab form of the Persian Shapur or Shah-pur, which the Greeks wrote Sapor.iv] 'irAk. 67 of West Baghdad were derived, with the exception of the few coming from the Dujayl canal. Al-Muhawwal means 4 the place of unloading/ and the town took its name from the fact that the river barges going from the Euphrates towns to Baghdad, had here to unload into small boats that could pass under the numerous bridges which below Muhaw- wal spanned the 'Isa canal where this traversed the suburb of Karkh. Muhawwal was a fine town, famous for its markets and its gardens, and as late as the 8th (14th) century possessed some magnificent buildings, among which Mustawfi counts a palace built by the Caliph Mu'tasim which stood on the summit of a mound, and which, by the spell of a powerful incantation, had been freed from the plague of mosquitoes. The exact site of Muhawwal is not now known, but it must lie to the north-east of the ancient Babylonian mound called the Hill of 'Akarkfif, which is frequently mentioned by the Arab geographers, and which Mustawfi connects with the legends of the tyrant Nimrod who threw Abraham into the fiery furnace 1 . Three leagues below the village of Dimimma the second of the great transverse canals, the Nahr Sarsar, flowed off towards the Tigris, which it entered four leagues above Madain. This canal, in its lower reaches, traversed the Baduraya district, which lay south of West Baghdad, and Ibn Serapion describes how along its banks numerous waterwheels {daliya/i) and levers {shaduf) were set up for irrigating the fields. Some way above where, near Zariran, the canal flowed into the Tigris, and almost in sight of the White Palace of the Chosroes at Madain, was the flourishing town of Sarsar, where a great bridge of boats carrying the Kufah road crossed the canal. Sarsar town lay a couple of leagues only from Karkh, the great southern suburb of West Baghdad; the Sarsar canal, Ibn Hawkal writes, was navigable for boats, and Sarsar 1 I. S. 10, 14. I. K. 7, 72, 74. Kud. 217. 1st. 77. I. H. 155, 166. Muk. 123, 134. Yak. i. 367 ; ii. 600 ; iii. 697 ; iv. 432. Mst. 136, 138, ^o, 141- The lower courses of the Nahr 'Isa and of the Sarat canal belong to the topography of Baghdad, and have been fully described in a former work. The site of AnMr appears to be that marked by the ruins at Sufayrah, or possibly those to the north of this village of which Mr j. P. Peters has given a plan in Nippur, i. 177. 5—2town stood in a forest of date-palms. Mukaddasi likens it to the towns of Palestine for the manner of its building; and Sarsar continued to be a place of importance down to the close of the 8th (14th) century when Timiir took possession of Baghdad and garrisoned the surrounding districts. The third transverse canal was the Nahr-al-Malik, which began at the village of Al-FaMjah 1 five leagues below the head of the Nahr Sarsar, and flowed into the Tigris three leagues below Madain. This, c the King's Canal/ dated from ancient times, and is mentioned by the Greeks as the Nahar Malcha. YaMt reports that tradition gave it as having been dug either by King Solomon or by Alexander the Great. On its banks was the town called Nahr-al-Malik, with a bridge of boats on the Kftfah road, this lying seven miles south of Sarsar. According to Ibn Hawkal Nahr-al-Malik town was larger by a half than the latter town, being likewise famous for its corn lands and palm-groves; Mustawfi adding that over 300 villages were of its district. The fourth transverse canal was the Nahr Ktitha, its point of origin on the Euphrates being three leagues below that of the Nahr-al-Malik, and its outflow 10 leagues below Madain. The Kfttha canal watered the district of this name, which was also known as the Ardashir Babgan district (after the first Sassanian king), though part of it was counted as the Nahr Jawbar district on a branch canal. The city of Klitha Rabba, with its bridge of boats, stood on the banks of the main channel, and is said to be identical with the Biblical Cuthah, mentioned in 2 Kings xvii. 24, an important town of the neighbourhood of Babylon. Ac cording to Moslem tradition Kfttha was the place where Abraham w T as thrown into the fire by the tyrant Nimrod, and the town took its name from Kiitha, the grandfather of Abraham, according to the Moslem tradition. In the 4th (10th) century Ibn Hawkal describes the place as a double city, KUtha-at-Tank, 4 of the Road,' and Kiitha Rabba, which last was a city larger than Babil (Babylon), and near here, he says, were great mounds of 1 This is the Feluchia (Feluge or Felugia) of Caesar Frederick, and other Elizabethan merchants, where coming down the Euphrates they left their boats and went by land across to Baghdad: as narrated in Hakluyt, Principal Navigations (Glasgow, 1904), v. 367, 455, 466; vi. 4.iv] 'ir A k. 69 ashes said to mark the place of Nimrod ? s fiery furnace; Mukaddasi adding that near the high road might be seen an ancient tower, about which many legends were told. The Itineraries state that Kiitha town, the site of which appears to be that marked on the map as Tall Ibrahim, 'the Hill of Abraham,' was four miles south of Nahr Malik town. Some few miles to the north of the Kiitha canal stood the large village of Al-Farashah, the half-way stage between Baghdad and Hillah, on the high road followed at the close of the 6th (12th) century by the Mecca pilgrims going down to Ktifah. Ibn Jubayr, who was here in 580 (1184), describes it as a populous well-watered village, where there was a great caravanserai for travellers, defended by battlemented walls; and Mustawfi also gives Farashah in his itinerary, placing it seven leagues south of Sarsar 1 . 1 I.

The course of the Nahr ^sa is more or less that of the modern Saklawiyah canal: the Sarsar appears to have followed the line of the Abu Ghurayb canal; the Nahr-al-Malik is the Radhwaniyah, and the Nahr Kutha is the Habl Ibrahim, 4 Abraham's rope,' of the modern maps. These identifi cations, however, are only approximate, for naturally in over a thousand years the face of the alluvial Sawad is entirely changed from what it was in Abbasid times.CHAPTER V.

Mashhad 'Ali, and Karbala. The twelve Astans of 'Irak. Trade. The high roads of 'Irak. The river Euphrates in the 4th (10th) century bifurcated at a point some six leagues below where the Ktatha canal was led off. The western branch, to the right, which was then considered the main stream of the Euphrates, passed down by Ktifah and thence to the Great Swamp; while the eastern branch, to the left, which now is the main stream of the river, is by Ibn Serapion and the other Arab geographers called the Nahr Siira, or As-Suran; and this by many channels likewise poured its waters finally into the swamp. Taking the Sura branch first (the present Euphrates channel) we find that Ibn Serapion admits this was greater even in his day than the Ktifah branch and more broad. Where the bifurcation took place, the Upper Sura canal watered the three sub- districts of Stlra, Barbisama, and Bartisma, which formed part of the middle Bih Kubadh district; then bearing south the channel passed a couple of miles to the westward of the city called Kasr Ibn Hubayrah, and here it was crossed by the great bridge of boats known as the Jisr Sura (or Suran) by which the Pilgrim road went down from Kasr Ibn Hubayrah to Kufah. The town of Al-Kasr, as it was called for short, the Castle or Palace of Ibn Hubayrah, took the name from its founder, who had been governor of 'Irak under Marwan II, the last Omayyadchap. v] I rak. 7i Caliph. Ibn Hubayrah had not lived to complete his work, but after the fall of the Omayyads, the first Abbasid Caliph, Saffah, took up his residence here, finished the palace, and called it Hashimiyah in honour of his own ancestor Hashim. The town which rapidly sprung up round the palace of the Caliph none the less continued to be called after the Omayyad governor, and even though Mansur made Hashimiyah for a time his residence, before the foundation of Baghdad, Kasr Ibn Hubayrah, or Madinah (the City of) Ibn Hubayrah, was always the name of the place in common use. In the 4th (10th) century Kasr Ibn Hubayrah was the largest town between Baghdad and Kufah, and it stood on a loop canal from the Stira, called the Nahr Abu Raha, ; the Canal of the Mill.' The city was extremely populous, it had fine markets, many Jews residing here, as Mukaddasi writes, and the Friday Mosque was in the market place. By the early part of the 6th (12th) century, however, it appears to have fallen to decay, being eclipsed by the rising importance of Hillah; and at the present day even the site of it is unknown, though it is doubtless marked by one of the numerous ruins which lie a few miles north of the great mounds of ancient Babylon, or Babil as the Arabs name these. The city of Hillah, lying a few miles below the Babil ruins, on the Euphrates, otherwise the Siira canal as it was called in the 4th (10th) century, was at this date known as Al-Jami'an, 4 the Two Mosques/ and the town at first stood mostly on the eastern bank. It was a populous place, and its lands were extremely fertile. Then Al-Hillah, 'the Settlement,' was built on the opposite right bank, by Sayf-ad-Dawlah, chief of the Bam Mazyad, in about the year 495 (1102); and this quickly grew to importance, for its bridge of boats became the new Euphrates crossing for the Pilgrim road from Baghdad to Kufah, the high road no longer passing down by Kasr Ibn Hubayrah (then a ruin) and the Sura bridge. By the 6th (12th) century, also, the Sura arm comes to be considered the main stream of the Euphrates, as at the present day, and the name Nahr Siira gradually goes out of use. In 580 (1184) Ibn Jubayr crossed the Euphrates by 'a great bridge of boats, bound by iron chains/ at Hillah, then already a large town stretching along the western side of the Euphrates. Ibn Batutah,72 'IRAK. [CHAP. who followed in his footsteps in the early part of the 8th (14th) century, gives a long account of this famous bridge of boats at Hillah, the double iron chains of which were secured at either end to immense wooden piles. He praises the town markets, and his account is fully borne out by Mustawfi, his contemporary, who speaks of Hillah as beginning to occupy the east as well as the west bank of the Euphrates. It was surrounded by date-groves and hence had a damp climate. Mustawfi adds that the popula tion of Hillah were all bigoted Shi'ahs, and they possessed a shrine (Makam) here, where they believed that, in the fulness of time, the promised Mahdi, who had disappeared at Samarra in 264 (878), would reappear and convert all mankind to their faith (see above, p. 56) ^ Returning once more to the account given by Ibn Serapion in the 4th (10th) century of the Sura canal, this, as already said, passed to the west of the great ruins of Babylon, or Babil. These ruins Mukaddasi describes as then occupied by the site of a village near a bridge of boats, and Mustawfi gives a long account of the great magicians who had lived in Babil, and of the well at the summit of the hill in which the fallen angels Harilt and Martit were imprisoned until the day of judgment. Above Babil, the last of the many canals flowing from the Euphrates to the Tigris branched from the Stira. This waterway, now known as the Shatt-an-Nil—'the Nile Stream'—Ibn Sera pion calls the Great Sarat, the name is the same as that of the more famous canal of West Baghdad (see p. 66) in the upper reach lying to the west of the city of Nil. From its point of origin the Great Sarat flowed eastward past many rich villages, throwing off numerous water channels, and shortly before reaching the city of Nil a loop canal, the Sarat Jamasp, branched left and rejoined the main stream below the city. This loop canal had been re-dug by Hajjaj, the famous governor of Trak under the Omayyad Caliphs, but took its name, as was reported, from Jamasp, the chief Mobed, or Fire-priest, who in ancient days had aided King Gushtasp to establish the religion of Zoroaster in Persia. The 1 I. S. 10, 16. Ykb. 309. 1st. 85, 86. I. H. 166, 168. Muk. 121. \ak. ii. 322; iii. 861; iv. 123. I. J. 214. L B. ii. 97. Mst. 138.Vj ' ir A K. 73 city of An-Nil likewise was founded by Hajjaj; it became the chief town of all this district, its ruins being still marked on the map under the name of Niliyahj and the Nil canal was reported to have taken its name from the Nile of Egypt which it was said to recall. The main canal here, opposite Nil city, was spanned by a great masonry bridge named the Kantarah-al-Masi. In the time of Abu-l-Fida that portion of the canal which lay west of the town, namely the Great Sarat of Ibn Serapion, was also known as the Nahr-an-Nil, but Ibn Serapion gives this name exclusively to the reach beyond, east of Nil city. This reach, therefore, passing on, watered the surrounding districts till it came to a place called Al-Hawl—'the Lagoon'— near the Tigris, and opposite Nu'maniyah (see p. 37), whence a branch, called the Upper Zab canal, communicated directly with the river. The main channel of the Nil, here turning off south, flowed for some distance parallel to the Tigris, down to a point one league below the town of Nahr Sabus which lay one day's march above Wasit, where the canal finally discharged its waters into the Tigris, probably in part by the Lower Zab canal. It is to be added that this last reach of the Nil, below the Lagoon, was known as the Nahr Sabus, 'the Canal of Sabus,' and this gave its name to the town on the right bank of the Tigris, already mentioned (see p. 38). The nomenclature of these channels changed at different epochs; in the 7 th (13th) century Yaktit says that all the reach from Nil city to Nu'maniyah was called the Upper Zab canal, while his Lower Zab canal is apparently identical with the Nahr Sabus of Ibn Serapion; both canals in the 7th (13th) century had, however, gone much to ruin, though still bordered by fertile lands. Returning now to the ruins of Babylon on the Euphrates, the Stira below here was crossed by a masonry bridge called the Kantarah-al-Kamighan, 'through which its waters pour with a mighty rush' as Ibn Serapion reports. Six leagues below this bridge, and near Jami'an, the later Hillah, the Sura canal bifur cated, the right arm going south past that city, and the left arm, called the Nahr-an-Nars, turning off to the south-east, and after watering Hammam 'Omar with other villages reached the town of Niffar. This canal took its name from Nars (or Narses), the74 'IRAK. [char Sassanian king who came to the throne in 292 a.d.; he having caused it to be dug. After running south for some distance both the Nahr Nars and the Slira channel poured their waters finally into the Badat canal, which traversed the northern limit of the Great Swamp; and this Nahr-al-Badat (or Budat) was a long drainage channel taken from the left bank of the Kiifah arm of the Euphrates, at a point a day's journey to the north of Ktlfah city,, probably near the town of Kantarah-al-Ktifah, otherwise called Al-Kanatir, 'the Bridges,' which doubtless carried the high road across the Badat. This city of ' the Bridges' lay 2 7 miles south of the great Sura bridge of boats, and 28 miles north of Kiifah; and it probably lay adjacent to, or possibly was identical with, the Hebrew Pombedita (Arabic Fam-al-Badat, 'mouth of the Badat canal'), mentioned by Benjamin of Tudela in the 6th (12th) century as a great centre of Jewish learning in Babylonia. The Badat canal after a course of over 50 miles, and after receiving on its left bank the drainage of the Lower Stira and Nars canals^ discharged itself finally into the Great Swamp near the town of Niffar 1 . The districts lying between the bifurcation of the Lower Euphrates, having the Stira canal to the east and the main stream to the west, were known as the Upper and Lower Al-FaMjah. Below these the main stream passed down by the town of Al- Kantarah and the outflow of the Badat canal to the city of Kiifah, which lay on the western bank of the Euphrates over against the bridge of boats, and south of this its waters were discharged by various channels into the Great Swamp. This older arm of the river is named by Kudamah and Mas'Mi the channel of Al-Alkami, and it appears to be identical with the modern Nahr Hindiyah which branches from the present Euphrates stream below Musayyib and, flowing past the ruins of Kufah, rejoins the present main stream of the Euphrates by a winding course through marshes that are a part of the Great Swamp of Abbasid times. The city of Al-Kufah was founded immediately after the 1 I. S. 16. Baladhuri, 254, 290. I. R. 182. I. H. 167. Muk. 121. A. F. 53. Yak. i. 770; ii. 31, 903; iii. 4, 379; iv. 773, 798, 840, 861.

It was intended to serve as a permanent camp on the Arab, or desert, side of the Euphrates, and occupied an extensive plain lying above the river bank, being close to the older Persian city of Al-Hirah. Ktifah rapidly increased in population, and when in the year 36 (657) 'Ali came to reside here the city during four years was the capital of that half of Islam which recognised 'All as Caliph. In the mosque at Ktifah 'Ali was assassinated in the year 40 (661). Istakhn describes Kufah as the equal in size of Basrah in the 4th (10th) century, but the former had the better climate, and its buildings were more spacious; also its markets were excellent, though in this point it stood second to Basrah. The Great Mosque, where c Ali received his death-wound, was on the eastern side of the city, and had tall columns brought from the neighbouring town of Hirah, which fell to ruin as Ktifah became more populous. One of the chief quarters of Kiifah was x \l-Kunasah—'the place of the Sweepings'—which lay on the desert side of the town, and all round stood palm-groves which produced excellent dates. When Ibn Jubayr passed through Ktifah in 580 (1184) it was an unwalled town mostly in ruins, but its Friday Mosque still existed, and Ibn Battitah, in the 8th (14th) century, describes its roof as supported by pillars, formed of stone drums joined with lead. A Mihrab or niche marked the place where 'All had been assassinated. Mustawfi, who gives a long account of Ktifah, says that its walls, 18,000 paces in circuit, had been built by the Caliph Manstlr. The sugar-cane grew here better than anywhere else in 'Irak, and cotton crops yielded abundantly. In the mosque, on a column, was the mark of 'All's hand; and they also preserved here the oven {tannur) from the mouth of which the waters had poured forth at the time of the Deluge of Noah. Less than a league south of Ktifah are the ruins of Hirah, which had been a great city under the Sassanians. Near by stood the famous palaces of As-Sadir and Al-Khawarnak, the latter built, according to tradition, by Nu'man, prince of Hirah, for King Bahram Gtir, the great hunter. The palace of Khawarnak with its magnificent halls had mightily astonished the early Moslems when they first took possession of Hirah on the conquest of'IRAK. [chap. Mesopotamia. In later times Khawarnak was sometimes used as a hunting lodge by the Caliphs, and apparently, though nothing now remains of it, some walls and domes were still standing, though in ruin, when Ibn Battitah passed by here in the beginning of the 8th (14th) century. On the actual desert border, five leagues west of Ktifah, and the first stage on the road to Mecca, was the large hamlet of Al- Kadisiyah surrounded by palm-groves, near which, in the year 14 (635), the Moslems had won their first great battle against the Persians, which led almost immediately to the subjugation of Mesopotamia. Mukaddasi describes Kadisiyah—called Kadisiyah of Ktifah to distinguish it from the city of the same name on the Tigris (see p. 51)—as a town much frequented during the season of the Pilgrimage. It was defended by a small fort, and had two gates. Its lands were watered by a canal from the Euphrates which entered the town at the Baghdad Gate; and at the Desert Gate (Bab-al-Badiyah) was the Friday Mosque, before which, when the Pilgrims came, a great market was held. In the 8th (14th) century when Ibn Battitah travelled through Kadisiyah it had sunk to the size of a large village, and Mustawfi describes it as for the most part in ruin 1 . Najaf, where the tomb of 'All (Mashhad 'All 2 ) is to the Shi'ahs a most venerated shrine, lies about four miles to the westward of the ruins of Klifah, and is a populous town to the present day. The Shi'ah tradition, as given by Mustawfi, is that on receiving the fatal stab in the Ktifah mosque, 'All, knowing his death to be imminent, had immediately given orders that when the breath was out of his body, it was to be put on a camel and the beast turned loose; where the camel knelt, there his corpse was to be buried. All this was forthwith done, but during the time of the Omayyads no 1 I. S. 10, 16. Kud. 233. Mas. Tanbih 52. 1st. 82. I. H, 162, 163. Muk. 116, 117. Yak. ii. 492 ; iii. 59 ; iv. 322. I. J. 213. I.

Subsequently, however, in the year 175 (791), the holy site was discovered by the Abbasid Caliph Harun-ar-Rashid. For, when hunting one day near Kiifah, he chased his quarry into a thicket, but on attempting to follow the Caliph discovered that no force could prevail on his horse to enter the place. On enquiring of the peasants they informed him that this spot was known as the burial-place of the Caliph c Ali, an inviolate sanctuary, where even wild beasts were safe from harm. Orders were given by Hartin to dig,# and the body of 'All being discovered, a Mashhad or shrine was, according to Mustawfi, forthwith built over the spot, which soon became a holy place of visitation. The early history of the shrine is obscure, the foregoing is the usual Shi'ah account, but though Hartin-ar-Rashid at one period of his reign favoured the Alids, the Arab chronicles certainly do not relate that he invented the tomb of 'Ali. The earliest notice in detail of Mashhad £ Ali is of the middle of the 4th (10th) century by Ibn Hawkal. He says that the Hamdanid prince Abu-l-Hayja—who was governor of Mosul in 292 (904) and died in 317 (929)—had built a dome on four columns over the tomb at Mashhad c Ali, which shrine he orna mented with rich carpets and hangings : also he surrounded the adjacent town with a wall. Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal, however, add that in their day the burial-place of 'All was shown in the corner of the Great Mosque at Klifah, and this was credited by many persons of note, as is affirmed by other authorities. Mustawfi says, further, that in the year 366 (977) 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid erected the mausoleum which in his (Mustawffs) day still existed, and the place then became a little town, 2500 paces in circuit. In the chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir it is recorded that 'Adud-ad-Dawlah, at his own wish, was buried here, likewise his sons Sharaf and Baha-ad-Dawlah; and in subsequent times various other notable persons followed the example. In the year 443 (1051) the shrine was burnt to the ground by the Baghdad populace, who were zealous, in persecuting the Shi'ahs. It must however have been quickly rebuilt, for Malik Shah and his Wazir, the Nizam-al-Mulk, made their visitation here in 479 (1086). Writing in the early part of the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi'IRAK. [CHAP. adds that Ghazan, the Il-Khan of his day, had recently erected at Mashhad 'Ali a home for Sayyids (descendants of the Prophet) called the Dar-as-Siyadah, also a Khankah or Darvish monastery. YaMt in the previous century describes the dyke at Najaf which kept back the waters of the Euphrates from overflowing the town, but he gives no account of the shrine. The traveller Ibn Batfttah was here in the year 726 (1326) and speaks of Mashhad 'Ali as a fine city, which he entered by the Bab-al-Hadrat— £ the Gate of the Presence'—leading direct to the shrine. He gives a long description of its great markets and colleges, also of the mosque where 'All's tomb was shown, the walls of which were covered with enamelled tiles of Kashani work. He reports that at the tomb cripples were frequently healed of their infirmities, and he gives a long account of the many gold and silver lamps hung up as offer ings, as well as the magnificent carpets, and describes the actual tomb as enclosed in a railing of chiselled gold plates, secured by silver nails. Four gates gave access to the shrine, each curtained, and having a silver doorstep, the walls also being hung with silk embroideries; and his account closes with the enumeration of the miracles vouchsafed here to all true believers 1 . Karbala, or Mashhad Husayn, lies eight leagues to the north west of Klifah, and marks the site of the battlefield where in the year 61 (680) Husayn, son of 'Ali, and grandson of the Prophet, was slain, with nearly all his family. The place of martyrdom of Husayn is to Shi'ahs of the present day a more venerated place than Mashhad 'Ali. By whom the shrine was first built is not mentioned, but in the 3rd (9th) century some monument must have existed here, for in the year 236 (850) the Caliph Mutaw- akkil earned the lasting hatred of all good Shi'ahs by ordering the shrine of Husayn to be destroyed by flooding the place with water, also he forbade the visitation of the sacred spot under heavy penalties. Mustawfi adds, when describing the palaces at Samarra, that this iniquity on the part of Mutawakkil was requited to him, in that none of the buildings he began at Samarra could ever be completed, but soon fell to the same state of ruin in which 1 1st. 82. I. H. 163. Muk. 130. Ibn-al-Athir, ix. 13, 42, 169, 394; x. 103. Mst. 134. Yak. iv. 760. I. B. i. 414—416.V] 'IRAK. 79 the wicked Caliph had left the tomb of Husayn. How long the place remained a ruin is not stated, but 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid in 368 (979) built a magnificent shrine here, doubtless an enlargement of the building noticed incidentally by the geographers Istakhn and Ibn Hawkal who wrote a little before this date. In 407 (1016) the dome at Mashhad Husayn was burnt down, but must have been shortly afterwards restored, for the place was visited by Malik Shah in 479 (1086), when he went hunting in these districts. Yakiit unfortunately gives no descrip tion of the shrines at Karbala, merely mentioning incidentally that the name Al-Hair, meaning c a garden pool,' was commonly given to the enclosure round the tomb of Husayn. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century speaks of the little town that had grown up round the shrine as being some 2400 paces in circuit, and his contemporary Ibn Batdtah describes the fine college (Madrasah) which he visited here. The Holy Theshold of the actual tomb, which the pilgrims kissed on entry, was he says of solid silver; the shrine was lighted by numerous gold and silver lamps, and the doorways were closed by silken curtains. Ibn Battitah adds that the little town was then mostly a ruin, from the ceaseless fighting of rival factions among its inhabitants, but it stood among many groves of date palms, well watered by canals coming from the Euphrates 1 . When describing 'Irak in the 3rd (9th) century, Ibn Khur- dadbih and Kudamah state that the province was then divided into twelve districts called Astan, each containing a varying number of sub-districts, called Tassuj\ and of these latter the total number was sixty. This division, which probably in its origin was made for fiscal purposes, is repeated in part by Mukaddasi in the following century, and it will be worth while to enumerate the twelve Astans, giving at the same time the best known of their sub-districts or Tasstij. The list is divided into three groups according to the irrigation channels, and whence the water was taken. The first group of four districts consists of those lying on the east side of the Tigris, and watered from that river and from the Tamarra. These were (1) the Astan of Shad Firiiz or Hulwan 1 1st. 85. I. H. 166. Muk. 130. Yak. ii. 189. Mst. 134, 139. I. B, ii. 99. Ibn-al-Athir, vii. 36; viii. 518; ix. 209; x. 103.8o 'irak. [chap. (otherwise Shadh Fayriiz) comprising the sub-districts of Tamarra, and Khanikin, with three others; five in all: (2) the Shad Hurmuz district, round Baghdad, with the sub-districts of Nahr Biik, of Kalwadha and Nahr Bin, of Al-Madinah-al-'Atikah (otherwise Madain), of Upper and of Lower Radhan, with two others; seven in all: (3) the Shadh Kubadh district, with the sub-districts of Jallila, of Bandanijin, of Baraz-ar-Rtiz, and of Daskarah, with four others, making a total of eight. Of these two last districts this is the nomenclature given by Ibn Khurdadbih; Kudamah on the contrary transposes the names, making the Astan of Shadh Kubadh the Baghdad district, and giving Khusraw Shadh Hurmuz as the name of the Jaltila Tassiij with its seven neigh bours. The last Astan to the east of the Tigris was (4) the district of Bazijan Khusraw, otherwise of Nahrawan, which Kudamah names Arandin Kird, and this comprised five sub- districts, to wit: Upper, Middle, and Lower Nahrawan (with Iskaf of the Bani Junayd and Jarjaraya), next the Badaraya Tassfij, and lastly Bakusaya. The next group of two districts was of those watered partly from the Tigris, partly from the Euphrates; it consisted of (5) the Astan of Kaskar, otherwise called Shadh Sabtir, with four sub-districts lying round Wasit; and (6) the Astan of Shadh Bahman, or the Ktirah Dijlah, on the Lower Tigris, with four sub-districts, Maysan and Dasti-Maysan being two of them, the latter lying round Ubullah. The remaining six districts all lay to the west of the Tigris, and were watered by the old Dujayl canal previously mentioned and by the great canals flowing eastward from the Euphrates to the Tigris. The first of these was : (7) Astan-al-A £ la, 'the Upper District,' with the four sub-districts lying along the Nahr £ Isa, namely Firiiz Sabur or Al-Anbar, Maskin, Katrabbul, and Badiiraya. Next below came : (8) the Astan of Ardashir Babgan, lying along the Ktitha canal and the Nil, with the sub- districts of Bahurasir and Rtimakan opposite Madain, of Ktitha, and of the two canals called Nahr Jawbar and Nahr Durkit. To the east of this was: (9) the district of the Zab canals, called the Astan of Bih Dhivmasufan, comprising the sub-districts of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Zab canals.V] •'ir A k. 81 The last three districts were those respectively of Upper, Middle, and Lower Bih Kubadh, and of these the first (10) Upper Bih Kubadh comprised six sub-districts, namely, Babil (the ruins round Babylon), Upper and Lower Al-Fallujah, with two others, and the Tassuj of 'Ayn-at-Tamr some distance to the west of the Euphrates. The Astan (u) of Middle Bih Kubadh included four sub-districts, to wit, those of the Badat canal, of Sfira with Barbisama, of Barusama, and of Nahr-al-Malik. Finally (12) Lower Bih K u badh comprised five sub-districts, all of which apparently lay adjacent to the lower course of the Euphrates where it entered the Great Swamp. The names in these lists show clearly that we have here the division of the country which the Arabs took over from the Sassanians; Ardashir Babgan was the founder of the dynasty: Shad Firuz or Shadh Fayruz means 'glorious fortune' in Persian. Bih K u badh is 'the Goodness, or good land, of King K u badh,' and the 'Glory' (Shadh) of Hurmuz, of K u badh, of Shaplir, and of Bahman recall the names of four of the most famous kings of Persia 1 . The trade of 'Irak consisted of imports rather than of exports, the capital province consuming the products of the outlying regions. Mukaddasi, however, gives a list of commodities and manufactures for which several cities were famous, and this though not very full is worth examining. The markets of Baghdad were noted for all kinds of curious wares brought together here from foreign lands. Its manufac tures were coloured silks—the famous 'Attabi or 'Tabby' silk in particular, named after one of its quarters—fine strong cloth, curtains and veils, stuffs for turbans, napkins of all sorts, and mats woven of reeds. In Basrah many stuffs were manufactured of raw silk and its markets were famous for the jewellers, who sold all manner of curiosities; further Basrah was the chief emporium for various ores and minerals, antimony, cinnabar. Mars-saffron, litharge and many others being mentioned. There were also exported dates, henna-dye and raw silk, as well as rose-water and essence of violets : while at Ubullah excellent linen was woven. Kufah was famous for its dates, for its essence of violets, and for raw-silk stuffs of which turbans were made; Wasit exported lupins and 1 I. K. 5—8. Kud. 235, Muk. 133. L e S. 682 c irAk. [chap. dried fish called Shim\ finally Nu ( mamyah manufactured much cloth, and was famous for all sorts of woollen stuffs 1 . As explained in the introductory chapter, the central point of the system of high roads during the Abbasid Caliphate naturally was Baghdad; whence five main roads—to Basrah, Ktifah, Anbar, Taknt and Hulwan—set forth, communicating ultimately with the outposts of the empire. The easiest route to Basrah from Baghdad was naturally by boat down the Tigris, and this, noting all the towns passed to right and left on the river bank, is given in much detail by both Ibn Rustah and Ya £ kilbi. Down as far as Al-Katr the Tigris main channel was followed, then came the Great Swamp through which boats passed threading the lagoons (Hawl, see above, p. 42). The Abu-l-Asad canal led out to the head of the Tigris estuary, and from this Basrah was reached by the Nahr Ma'kil. The Ubullah canal led back to the estuary, and was followed by those bound for 'Abbadan and the Persian Gulf. The way by land from Baghdad to Wasit, which went down the eastern side of the Tigris through Madain, is also given by Ibn Rustah, and this enables the towns on the river bank to be set down on the map, for the distances are stated in farsakhs (leagues); Kudamah also gives this route in detail, and in one or two cases where lacunae occur they can generally be filled up from Abu-l-Fida. The road from Wasit to Basrah by land, along the northern edge of the Great Swamp, is given by Kudamah, and this too is the way by which Ibn Batiltah travelled in the 8th (14th) century. Ibn Rustah and Kudamah likewise give the road from Wasit, eastward, to Ahwaz the capital of Khtizistan ; and from the stage at Badhbin, one march east of Wasit on this road, a bifurcation went north-east to Tib, from which Siis (Susa) in Khtizistan was reached 2 . The Pilgrim road, going south from Baghdad to Ktifah, left the Round City by the Kiifah Gate and passed through the Karkh quarter to Sarsar, and thence on to Kasr Ibn Hubayrah. Beyond this it crossed the eastern arm of the Euphrates (the present main 1 Muk. 128. 2 I. R. 184, 186—188. Ykb. 320. Kud. 193, 225, 226. Mst. 195. A. F. 305. I. B. ii. 8.[l v ] 'IR A K. 83 , ' ~ ~ ~ ~ channel) called in the 4th (10th) century the Nahr Stira, at the Stira bridge of boats, and thence came down to Kufah, opposite to which the western arm of the Euphrates was crossed by the bridge of boats which led to the eastern suburbs of the city. From Kiifah the Pilgrim road went south-west to Kadisiyah, where it entered the Arabian desert. This road is given by all the earlier geographers, and in much detail by Ibn Rustah, who for some parts of the way from Baghdad to Kiifah gives alternative routes, with the distances in miles and in leagues. After the beginning of the 6th (12th) century Kasr Ibn Hubayrah, the half-way stage between Baghdad and Kiifah, fell to ruin; Hillah taking its place (see p. 71) to which the high road went down from Sarsar by Farashah. At Hillah the eastern arm of the Euphrates was crossed by a great bridge of boats similar to that which had formerly existed at Stlra. This is the route followed by Ibn Jubayr and all later travellers. From Ktifah to Basrah along the southern border of the Great Swamp was reckoned as 80 or 85 leagues, and this road, which branches to the left at the second desert stage south of Kadisiyah, is described by Ibn Rustah and Ibn Khurdadbih 1 . As already said, two Pilgrim roads crossed the deserts of Arabia going from Mesopotamia to the Hijaz, one starting from Kiifah, the other from Basrah, and they came together at the stage of Dhat 'Irk, which was two days march north-east of Mecca. These two famous Pilgrim ways are described stage by stage, and the half-stage is also given, where the caravan halted for supper (Al-Muta'ashshd), with the number of miles between each halt carefully noted, in the Road Books of the 3rd (9th) century and by Mukaddasi. The road from Ktifah passed through Fayd, 1 I. R. 174, 175, 180, 182. Ykb. 308. I. K. 125, 145. Kud. 185. A. F. 303. I. J. 214—219. Mst. 193. Mukaddasi (p. 252) estimates the distance from Basrah to Kufah along the edge of the desert at ten long marches (Marhalah), and at the shortest reckoning it is over 250 miles. It is famous in history for having been traversed in a night and a day by a certain Bilal ibn Abi Burdah, riding swift dromedaries (Jammdzah), he having an urgent affair with Khalid-al-Kasri at Kufah, in the year 120 (738), during the reign of the Omayyad Caliph Hisham.

[CHAP. which lay a short distance south of Hayil, the present chief town of Jabal Shammar. The Basrah road went by Dariyah, the older capital of what later became the Wahhabi kingdom, the ruins of which town still exist a few miles to the west of Ar-Riyad, the present chief town of Najd. From both the Klifah and the Basrah Pilgrim ways there were branch roads, bifurcating to the right, leading direct to Medina 1 . From Baghdad at the Ktifah Gate of the Round City a second high road branched westward, and going first to Muhawwal kept along the bank of the 'Isa canal to Anbar on the Euphrates, whence following up stream it passed Hadithah, the last town in 'Irak, and reached 'Anah in Jazirah. This is the first part of one of the roads (namely, by the Euphrates) going from Baghdad to Syria, and it is given by Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah. The other road to Syria goes north along the Tigris by Mosul, and as far as Takrit lies in the Trak province. This, which was the post-road, left the Baradan Gate of East Baghdad and keeping up the left bank of the river through 'Ukbara and Samarra came to Takrit. It was here joined by the caravan road which, leaving the 1 The Kufah road to Mecca and Medina is given in I. K. 125. Kud. 185. I. R. 175. Ykb. 311. Muk. 107, 251. The Basrah road is given in I.

The geography of the Hijaz, and of Arabia in general lying north of the Dahna or Great Desert, has been fully worked out (from Arabic sources) by Professor F. Wiistenfeld, in a series of articles published in the A bhandlungen der Kbniglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaft zu Gottingen. These papers are provided with maps by Kiepert, and are well indexed; they include the following, of which I give the names in full, as they do not appear to be well known to English geographers.

This last is the road followed by Ibn Jubayr and Ibn Batutah 1 . Finally from the Khurasan Gate of East Baghdad started the great Khurasan road which, crossing Persia, went, as already said, through Transoxiana, ultimately reaching the borders of China. This road is described in great detail, stage by stage, by Ibn Rustah; and almost all the other geographers give the distances along the various portions of this great highway, which is thus one of the best known to us of all the trunk roads 2 . 1 I.

As already explained the Arabs named Upper Mesopotamia Al-Jazirah, £ the Island' or Peninsula/ for its plains lay encom passed by the upper courses of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. The province was generally divided into three districts called Diyar Rabi^ah, Diyar Mudar, and Diyar Bakr, after the Arab tribes of. Rabi'ah, Mudar, and Bakr respectively, who, in pre- Islamic days, had settled here under Sassanian rule, each receiving its appointed Dar (plural Diyar) or 4 Habitation' to which the tribe had subsequently given its name. Of Diyar Rabi £ ah, Mosul on the Tigris was the chief town; of the district Diyar Mudar, Rakkah on the Euphrates was the capital; while Amid on the upper course of the Tigris was the chief city of Diyar Bakr, the northern most of the three districts. Mukaddasi, on the other hand, describes the Jazirah province under the name of Iklim Akftr, £ the Aktir Region'; the origin of the name is not clear, but Akrlr would appear to have been the proper name at one time of the great plain of northern Mesopotamia. A reference to the map shows that in Upper Mesopotamia the rivers Tigris and Euphrates receive their affluents almost exclusively on their left bank, that is flowing from the north east or north. During the period of the middle-ages an exceptionCHAP. VI] JAZIRAH. 87 occurs to this rule, namely in the drainage of the affluent of the (greater) KhabGr, the Hirmas river from Nasibin. Just above its point of junction, the Hirmas was dammed back at Sukayr-al- 'Abbas, and while a moiety passed on to join the Khabur which went to the Euphrates at Karkisiya, the main stream of the Hirmas flowed into the Tigris on its right bank at Taknt by the channel called the Nahr-ath-Tharthar. Further, it will be seen that the limits of the three districts are determined by the water parting. Diyar Bakr was the country watered by the Tigris from its source to the great bend south made by the river below Tall (the Hill of) Fafan, with the land to the northward traversed by the numerous affluents of the Tigris which join its left bank west of Tall Fafan. To the south-west, Diyar Mudar comprised all the lands along the Euphrates from Sumaysat, where it left the mountain gorges, down to 'Anah, with the plains watered by its affluent the river Balikh, coming from Harran. Lastly Diyar Rabi'ah was the district east of Mudar; namely, of the (greater) Khabur coming from Ras-al-'Ayn, with the Hirmas which, as we have seen, flowed eastward by the Tharthar to the Tigris, also the lands on both banks of the Tigris from Tall Fafan down to Takrit, namely those westward to Nasibin, and those eastward which included the plains watered by the Lower and Upper Zab and the Lesser Khabur river. Mosul (Al-Mawsil), the chief city of Diyar Rabi'ah, stands on the western bank of the Tigris at the point where a series of loops in the river coalesce to form a single main stream, and Al-Mawsil, meaning 'the confluence,' is said to take its name from this fact. In Sassanian times the city which existed here was called BMh Ardashir. Under the Omayyads Mosul rose to importance, a bridge of boats was set across the Tigris, connecting the city on the western side with the ruins of Nineveh on the east bank, and Mosul became the capital of the Jazirah province under Marwan II, the last of the Omayyad Caliphs, who also built here what afterwards came to be known as the Old Mosque 1 . Ibn Hawkal who was at Mosul in 358 (969) describes it as a 1 Muk. 136—138. I. K. 17. Yak. iv. 682—684. Mar. i. 84.

[CHAP. fine town with excellent markets, surrounded by fertile districts of which the most celebrated was that round Ninaway (Nineveh) where the prophet Yiinis (Jonah) was buried. In the 4th (10th) century the population consisted chiefly of Kurds, and the numerous districts round Mosul, occupying all Diyar Rab^ah, are carefully enumerated by Ibn Hawkal. Mukaddasi praises the numerous excellent hostelries of Mosul, and the town, he says, was extraordinarily well built, being in plan a semicircle, and about a third the size of Basrah. Its castle was named Al-Murabba'ah (the Square) and it stood on the affluent called the Nahr Zubaydah; within its precincts was held the Wednesday Market (Stik-al-Arba'a) by which name also the castle was sometimes known. The Friday Mosque (that of Marwan II) stood a bow shot from the Tigris, on a height to which steps led up. The roof of this building was vaulted in stone, and it had no doors to close the doorways going from the main building of the mosque into its court. The market streets of Mosul were for the most part roofed over, eight of the chief thoroughfares are named by Mukaddasi, and the houses of the town stretched for a considerable distance along the Tigris bank. Mukaddasi adds that formerly Mosul had borne the name of Khawlan : and that the Kasr-al- Khalifah, £ the Palace of the Caliph/ stood on the opposite bank of the river, half a league from the town, overlooking Nineveh. This palace had of old been protected by strong ramparts, which the winds had overthrown, and the ruins, through which flowed the stream called the Nahr-al-Khawsar, w T ere when Mukaddasi wrote occupied by fields. In the year 580 (1184) Mosul was visited and described by Ibn Jubayr. Shortly before this date the famous NUr-ad-Din, under whose banner Saladin began his career, had built the new Friday Mosque in the market place, but the old mosque of Marwan II still stood on the river bank, with its beautifully ornamented oratory and iron window-gratings. In the upper town was the great fortress, and the town walls with towers at intervals extended down to and along the river bank, a broad street connecting upper with lower Mosul. Beyond the walls were extensive suburbs with many small mosques, hostelries, and bath houses. The Maristan (or hospital) was famous, also the greatVI] JAZIRAH. 89 market buildings called the Kaysanyah 1 , and there were also numerous colleges here. Kazwim gives a list of the various Dayrs or Christian convents which were found in the vicinity of Mosul, and he notes especially the deep ditch and high walls of the Mosul fortress. All round the town were numerous gardens irrigated, he says, by waterwheels. In regard to the Nineveh mounds, these were known from the time of Mukaddasi as the Tall-at-Tawbah, 'the Hill of Repent ance,' where the prophet Ytinis, Jonah, had sought to convert the people of Nineveh. The spot was marked by a mosque, round which, Mukaddasi adds, were houses for pilgrims, built by Nasir-ad-Dawlah the Hamdanid prince, and half a league distant was a celebrated healing spring called 'Ayn Ytinis after the prophet Jonah, with a mosque adjacent, and here might be seen the Shajarah-al-Yaktin, namely 4 the Tree of the Gourd 7 planted by the prophet himself. Yakilt adds that most of the houses of Mosul were built of limestone or marble, with vaulted roofs, and that in the city might be seen the tomb of the prophet Jurjis, or St George. In the 8th (14th) century Ibn Batiitah passed through Mosul, which he describes as protected by a double wall and many high towers, ' like those of Dehli. 7 The fortress was then known as Al-Hadba, 'the Hump-backed,' and in the new Friday Mosque (that of Ntlr-ad-Din) was an octagonal marble basin with a fountain in its midst throwing up a jet of water a fathom high. A third Friday Mosque had recently been built overlooking the Tigris, and this is probably the building praised by Mustawfi, who says that the stone sculptured ornamentation of its oratory was so intricate that it might stand for wood-carving. In his day the circuit of Mosul measured a thousand paces, and he refers to the famous shrine of Jonah (Mashhad Yxinis) on the opposite bank of the Tigris, lying among the ruins of Nineveh 2 . 1 The Arabs, more especially those of the west, called the great buildings of a market, often used as a hostelry or caravanserai, Al-Kaysariyah, or Kaysariyah, a term which they must have derived from the Greeks, though KcLLaapeia does not occur, apparently, in the Byzantine historians, as applied to the Caesarian, or royal market of a town. In any case the word seems hardly likely to have been taken by the Moslems from the name of the Caesarion, the famous quarter of Alexandria; though this explanation is the one often given. 2 I.

A few miles to the east of Mosul lie the two small towns of Bartalla and Karmalis, which are mentioned by Yakiit and Mustawfi, and Ba/ashika is somewhat to the north of these, all three being of the dependencies of Mosul. Mukaddasi mentions Ba'ashika as noted for yielding a plant that cured scrofula and haemorrhoids. It was a small town, Yaktit adds, with a stream that worked many mills and irrigated its orchards, where olives, dates, and oranges grew abundantly. There was a large market here or Kaysanyah, with excellent bath houses. The Friday Mosque had a fine minaret, though in the 7th (13th) century most of the population were Christians. Bartalla lying a few miles south of Ba'ashika was likewise counted a^ of the Nineveh district. It was, Yaktit says, a place of great trade, mostly inhabited by Christians, though there was a fine mosque here, and many Moslems made the town their abode. The lettuces and greens of Bartalla were proverbial for their excellence, and Mustawfi praises its cotton crops. Karmalis, some miles further to the south again, had also a fine market according to YaMt, being a large village almost the size of a town, and much frequented by merchants. Mar Juhaynah, or Marj (the meadow of) Juhaynah, was also near these places, but on the Tigris bank, being the first stage on the road from Mosul south to Baghdad. Mukaddasi describes it as having many pigeon towers. Its castle was strongly built of mortared stone, and a Friday Mosque stood in the midst of the town. Between Mosul and Takrit the Tigris received, on its eastern bank, the waters of the two Zabs, the one flowing in about a hundred miles above the other; and Ibn Hawkal praises the magnificent fields occupying the broad lands lying between the two rivers. The upper or Greater Zab rose in the mountains between Armenia and Adharbayjan, and joined the Tigris at Hadithah. The lower or Lesser Zab, called also Majnfoi, 4 the Mad River,' from its impetuous current, flowed down from the Shahraztlr country, and came into the Tigris at Sinn. The country from which the Great Zab flows is that known as Mush- takahar and Babghish according to Yakiit, and its waters at first w r ere red in colour, but afterwards ran clear. Al-Hadithah, £ the New Town/ which stood a league above its junction with the Tigris (called Hadithah of Mosul, to distinguish it from HadithahVI] JAZIRAH. 91 on the Euphrates already mentioned, p. 64), had been rebuilt by the last Omayyad Caliph, Marwan II, on a height overlooking the swampy plain; it was surrounded by famous hunting grounds, and had many gardens. The town was built in a semicircle, steps led up to it from the Tigris, and the Friday Mosque which was constructed of stone overlooked the river. Under the Sassanians the town was known as Nawkird, meaning in Persian likewise ' new town,' and before the rise of Mosul this had been the capital of the province 1 . The town of As-Sinn (the Tooth) lying one mile below the junction of the Lower Zab according to Mas'iidi, but above it with the Lesser Zab flowing to the east according to Mukaddasi, was in the middle-ages chiefly inhabited by Christians, and Yakiit says there were many churches here. It was known as Sinn of Barimma, to distinguish it from other towns of this name, the Barimma chain of hills being cut through by the Tigris near this point. Sinn had in its market place a Friday Mosque, built of stone, and was surrounded by a wall. To the east of it, four leagues higher up the bank of the Lesser Zab, stood the town of Bawazij (Madinat-al-Bawazij as Ibn Hawkal gives the name) which however appears at the present day to have left no trace on the map. This also is the case with both Sinn and Hadithah, and may be explained by the lower courses of both the Zabs having much changed since the 4th (10th) century. Yakiit refers to the town as Bawazij-al-Malik, 'of the King,' and in the 8th (14th) century it still existed, for Mustawf! describes it as paying 14,000 dinars to the treasury of the Il-Khans. South of Sinn the post-road to Samarra and Baghdad kept along the left bank of the Tigris, passing first Barimma, a hamlet lying under the hills of this name otherwise known as the Jabal Humrin, then coming to As-SMakaniyah, and finally reaching Jabilta (or Jabulta) which appears to have been a mint city in 304 (916) lying on the east bank of the Tigris a little to the northward of Takrit. None of these small towns now appear on the map, but their positions are given very exactly in the Itineraries. 1 1st. 75. I. H. 147, 155. Muk. 139, 146.

Rather more than a hundred miles due east of Sinn lies the town of Daktika or DaMk—the name is generally written Tatik or Tawiik in ^Ali of Yazd, as at the present day—which is frequently mentioned by YaMt and the later geographers. Mustawfi speaks of the river of DaMk (as he spells the name) which, rising in the Kurdistan mountains near Darband-i-Khalifah (the Caliph's Pass), flowed out below the town of Dakirk into the sandy plain, where, according to Mustawfi, there were most dangerous quicksands which swallowed up those who attempted to cross over. In flood time, he says, the Dakiik river reached the Tigris, and its lower course is the stream now known as the Nahr-al-A f zam (the Great River): but in early times when the Nahrawan canal existed in its entirety, the spring floods of the Daktik river must have flowed into this. Mustawfi describes the town of DaMk as of medium size; it had a more healthy climate than that of Baghdad, and near it were found naphtha springs. It is to be remarked that the place is not mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers 1 . Irbil, the ancient Arbela, lay in the plain between the Greater and Lesser Zab, and is described by Yakiit as a town much frequented by merchants. The castle, which crowned a hill, had a deep ditch and was in part enclosed by the town wall. A great market was held here, and the mosque, called Masjid-al-Kaff, c of the Hand/ was celebrated for the mark of a man's palm on one of its stones. In the 7th (13th) century the market buildings had recently been restored, and great suburbs stretched beyond the city wall. Mustawfi praises the excellent crops, especially of cotton, that were produced by its lands. To the north of Mosul the city of Tmadiyah, near the head waters of the Upper Zab, according to Mustawfi derived its name from its founder the Daylamite prince £ Imad-ad-Dawlah who died in 338 (949).

Karkuk, not given by Yakut or the earlier geographers, is mentioned by 'Alt of Yazd (i. 661) as near Tauk. In regard to Jabilta, or Jabulta, on the Tigris opposite Takrit, it is to be remarked that this name has often been misread Habilta (e.g. Muk. 135: the letters H and J being identical in Arabic script except for a diacritical point). The initial letter however is certainly J, for in Syriac the name frequently occurs under the form Gebhilld, and in this script G and H do not resemble one another.VI] JAZIRAH. 93 authorities, however, ascribe 'Imadiyah, or at any rate the restoration of that town in 537 (1142), to 'Imad-ad-Din Zangi, father of that famous prince of Upper Mesopotamia, Ntir-ad-Din, under whom Saladin began his career. Yaktit reports that of old a castle had existed here held by the Kurds, and known under the name of Ashib. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century describes 'Imadiyah as a town of considerable size. In the neighbouring mountains were the head waters of the river Khabiir-al-Hasamyah, which flowed into the Tigris just north of the town of Faysabtlr, about 150 miles above Mosul. This river (not to be confounded with the Khabur of Ras-al- £ Ayn) rose according to Yakut, in the district of Az-Zawzan, and at the town of Al-Hasamyah it was spanned by a magnificent stone bridge, the remains of which still exist near the hamlet of Hasan Agha, which probably represents the older town. Hasamyah, where there was a Friday Mosque, is described by Mukaddasi as a place of some importance, and one stage to the south of it on the road to Mosul was the small town of Ma^lathaya, where there was a Friday Mosque on a hill, the place being completely surrounded by gardens 1 . To the north of Faysabtlr is the important town of the Jazirah (the Island), called Jazirah Ibn ^mar for distinction, after a certain Al-Hasan Ibn 'Omar of the tribe of Taghlib, its founder; and the Tigris, as YaMt explains, went half round the city in a semicircle, while a ditch filled with water on the land side made it an island. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes Jazirah as a walled town, whither the products of Armenia were brought for sale : its cheese and honey were famous. Its houses were of stone, and Mukaddasi adds that the mud at Jazirah in winter time was pheno menal. Ibn Battitah who was here in the 8th (14th) century found it much ruined. The old mosque, however, stood in the market place, and the town wall, built of stone, still existed. Mustawfi adds that over a hundred villages were of its dependencies. Opposite Jazirah Ibn 'Omar, on the west bank of the Tigris, was Bazabda of the Bakirda district, this representing the well-known 3 Muk. 139. Kaz. ii. 192. Yak. i. 186; ii. 384; iii. 717, 931. Mst. 165, 166.94 JAZIRAH. [CHAP. Roman fortress of Bezabda, but no description is given of the place. From Jazirah Ibn f Omar Jabal JMi was visible to the east ward, with the Mosque of Noah on its summit, and Kariyat-ath- Thamanin (the Village of the Eighty) at the foot of the mountain. The Kuran (ch. xi. v, 46) states that f the Ark rested upon Al-J^id^, , which Moslem tradition identifies with this mountain in Upper Mesopotamia, and eighty of the companions of Noah are said to have built the village of Thamanin named after their number, Mukaddasi describes Thamanin in the 4th (10th) century as a fair- sized city, and it lay one march to the north of Al-Hasaniyah; Mustawfi who calls it Stik-Thamanin—'the Market of the Eighty'— says that in his day it had fallen to ruin. Various affluents entered the Tigris on its left bank near Jazirah Ibn 'Omar, and these are enumerated by Yakftt, namely, the Yarna (or Yarni) and the Ba'aynatha (or Basanfa as Ibn Serapion calls it), with a large village of the same name, above Jazirah. Below this town, but to the north of the Khabtir-al-Hasaniyah, and flowing down from the country of Az-Zawzan were the Al-Bilyar and Dtlsha rivers 1 . On the western side of the Tigris, in the latitude of Jazirah Ibn 'Omar, is the hilly district of Tiir 'Abdin, 'the Mountain of (God's) Servants,' peopled by the Jacobites, in which the rivers Hirmas and the Khabik of Nasibin have their source. Nasibin, the Roman Nisibis, which Yakik describes as cele brated for its white roses and its forty thousand gardens, stood on the upper waters of the Hirmas river, called by the Greek geographers the Saocoras or Mygdonius, and it is still one of the most important towns of Upper Mesopotamia. Ibn Hawkal who was there in 358 (969) describes Nasibin as the finest town of the Jazirah province, and its neighbourhood produced the best barley and wheat crops. The hill above, from which its water came, was called the Jabal Baltisa, the town was most pleasant to live in, and the only drawback was the fear of scorpions. It was more spacious than Mosul, and Mukaddasi praises both its fine baths, and the private houses. The market extended right gcross from gate to gate, a Friday Mosque stood in its midst, and a strong 1 1st. 78. I. H. 152, 153, 157. Muk. 139. I. S. 18. A. F. 55, 275.

Nasibin was visited by Ibn Jubayr in 580 (1184), who praises its gardens; in its Friday Mosque were two tanks, and a bridge crossed the river Hirmas where it flowed by the town ; also there was the hospital (Maristan) and several colleges among other notable buildings. Ibn Batfltah who was here in the 8th (14th) century describes Nasibin as then for the most part in ruins, but its Friday Mosque was still standing with the two great tanks, and the gardens round the city produced the rose-water for which it was so celebrated. Mustawfi, who gives the circuit of the walls as 6500 paces, praises the grapes and other fruits grown here, and its wine, but the dampness of the climate, he says, made Nasibin an unhealthy place. He, too, speaks of the excellence of its roses, also the abomination of the scorpions, which were equalled in virulence by the plague of gnats 1 . Ras-al-'Ayn, 'the Spring-head,' near the sources of the Khabur (the Roman Resaina, on the river Chaboras), was famous for its numerous springs, said to number 360 in all, and their waters made the surrounding country a great garden. Of these springs the 'Ayn-az-Zahiriyah was supposed to be fathomless, and the stream flowing from this ran into the Khabur, by which pleasure- boats are described as travelling down from garden to garden from Ras-al-'Ayn to Karkisiya on the Euphrates. Ras-al-'Ayn is described by Ibn Hawkal as a walled town, having gardens and many mills within its circuit; and the arable fields stretched for 20 leagues beyond the houses. Mukaddasi describes a small lake at the chief spring, two fathoms deep, but the water so clear that a silver piece could clearly be seen at the bottom. The buildings of Ras-al-'Ayn were of stone, well mortared, and Ibn Jubayr who passed through the town in 580 (1184) mentions its two Friday Mosques and the fine colleges and bath houses which stood along the banks of the Khabur. In his time the city apparently had no wall, though in the 8th (14th) century this must have been rebuilt, for Mustawfi describes it as 5000 paces in circuit. He adds that co^on, corn, and grapes were grown here abundantly. 1 I. H. 140, 142, 143. I. S. 12. Muk. 140. I.J. 240. Yak. iii. 559; iv. 787. I. B. ii. 140. Mst. 167.96 JAZtRAH. [chap. About half-way between Ras-al-'Ayn and Naslbin, but more to the north, stood the great rock fortress of Mardin, overlooking the city of Dunaysir in the plain below, some three leagues to the south. In the 4th (roth) century the castle of Mardin, called Al-Baz (the Falcon), was the stronghold of the Hamdanid princes. The fortress crowned the hill-top, and on the southern side a suburb was built which by the 6th (12th) century had become very populous. Here there were many markets, some hostelries, and a few colleges, but all the buildings rose one above the other in steps, and the roads were stairs, each house having its cistern for storing rain water. Ibn Batutah, who visited Mardin in the 8th (14th) century, describes it as a fine town where much woollen stuff was woven. At that time the great fortress was known as Kal'at- ash-Shahba, 'the Grey Castle,' or Kal'at-i-Kuh, 'the Castle of the Hill.' Mustawfi describes Mardin as amply irrigated by the waters of the Sawr river, which flowed down from a hill of the same name in Ttir 'Abdin, and this river ultimately joined the Khabur; he adds that corn, cotton, and abundant fruit was grown in all the neighbourhood. Dunaysir, a few leagues distant (variously given as from 2 to 4, but its actual site appears to be unknown), was in the 7th (13th) century a great market town, and it was also known as Kilch Hisar. Yakut writes that when he was a boy, that is to say at the close of the 6th (12th) century, Dunaysir had been merely a large village, but in 623 (1225) it was become a great city, with extensive markets. Ibn Jubayr who had passed through it in 580 (1184) describes it as unwalled, but it was then a meeting place for caravans, and a college had recently been built with numerous bath houses. Dara, lying a few miles to the eastward, which had been a great fortress in Roman days, is mentioned as a small town by Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi describes how each house was supplied with water by an underground channel, these channels ultimately flowing into the tank of the Friday Mosque. The houses were all built, he says, of black stone, and well mortared. The town stood on a hill side, and Yakut states that it was famous for its Mahlab or cherry-stone preserve, the gardens being most fruitful. When Ibn Battitah passed Dara in the 8th (14th) century, however, its fortress had already become anVI] JAZIRAH. 97 uninhabited ruin. Kafartiitha, to the S.W. of Mardin and on its own small river, is described by Ibn Hawkal as already a town of some importance in the 4th (10th) century, being at the junction of the high road coming down from Amid. It was at that time a larger place than Dara, but in the 7th (13th) century YaMt refers to it as merely a large village 1 . The Greater Khabur from Ras-al-'Ayn received on its left bank the waters of the Mardin river, and below this again was joined by the Hirmas coming from Nasibin; but the major part of this latter stream, as already said, was diverted at the dam of Sukayr-al-'Abbas, a short distance above the junction with the Khabtlr, into the Tharthar channel. The Khablir now bearing the waters of three considerable streams, and—Mustawfi adds— further swelled by the confluence of 300 rivulets, flowed down south to Karkisiya on the Euphrates, which is the chief town of the Diyar Mudar district and will be described presently. Before coming to this the river ran by the towns of 'Araban and Makisin, which were of the Khabur lands and counted of Diyar Rabi'ah province. 'Arban or 'Araban, the ruins of which still exist, was in the 4th (10th) century a walled town where cotton stuffs were largely manufactured, cotton being grown in the surrounding country along the banks of the Khabur. Mukaddasi speaks of 'Araban as standing on a high hill and surrounded by gardens. To the south of it, half-way to Karkisiya, was the town of Makisin (or Maykasin) where a bridge of boats crossed the Khabur. Much cotton also was grown here, and near it lay the small lake of deep blue water called Al-Munkharik, about a third of an acre in extent and said to be unfathomable. The source of the Hirmas river is described as at a spring six leagues north of Nasibin, where the water was dammed back by a masonry wall, clamped and with leaden joints. This, it was said, the Greeks had built, to preserve Nasibin from being flooded, and the Caliph Mutawakkil at one time had commanded that it should be demolished, but finding the water beginning to overflow the city had promptly ordered the restoration of the wall.

[CHAP. miles or more south of Nasibin was the dam or weir called Sukayr-al-'Abbas, where in the 4th (10th) century there was a con siderable town with a Friday Mosque and markets. This was at the head of the Tharthar river, which, as already stated, flowed to the Tigris. At the present day its stream is so shrunken in volume that it no longer forms a waterway, and this shrinkage had already begun in the 7th (13th) century when Yaktit wrote, for he reports that though when the rains were plentiful the flood still passed down its channel, in summer the bed was only marked by pools of water and brackish springs. Yaktit had himself travelled along its course, and adds it was reported that in old times boats used to pass down this stream from the Khabtir to the Tigris; and in those days a succession of villages lined its banks, where, when he wrote, there was only a desert to be seen. In the plain of Sinjar the river Tharthar cut through the line of hills called the Jabal Humrin, otherwise the Jabal Barimma, and received from the north a small stream which flowed down from the city of Sinjar. This in the 4th (10th) century was a walled town, surrounded by a most fertile district. Mukaddasi describes it as famous for its carpenters; oranges, lemons, and the date palm flourished abundantly here, and a large Friday Mosque stood in the midst of the town. Moslem tradition stated that the Ark first rested on the hill above Sinjar during the Flood; but afterwards, continuing on its course, came finally to rest on Jabal Judi on the east side of the Tigris. Further, Yakiit adds that Sinjar was also famous as the birth place of Sultan Sinjar or Sanjar, the last of the great Saljriks, son of Malik Shah. According to Kazwim Sinjar in the 7th (13th) century was remarkable for its bath houses, which had beautiful mosaic floors, and Ibn Batiitah who passed through the place in the 8th (14th) century refers to its fine mosque. The town wall, 3200 paces in circuit, was built according to Mustawfi of mortared stone; most of the houses went step-fashion up the hill slope, and its gardens produced great quantities of grapes, olives, and sumach. Al-Hadr, the Roman Hatra, mentioned by Ibn Serapion, stood lower down the Tharthar, about half-way between Sinjar and where that river joined the Tigris near Takrit. At Hadr are still to be seen the remains of a great ParthianVI] JAZIRAH. 99 palace which Yakut reports to have been built by a certain As-Satiriin of squared stones, and there were many of its chambers whose ceilings and doors were likewise of stone slabs. Originally, he says, there had been sixty great towers, with nine turrets between each tower and its neighbour, while a palace stood over against each tower outside the walls 1 . The high road from Mosul to Nasibin went up the right bank of the Tigris, and at Balad (corresponding with the place now known as Eski, or Old, Mosul), seven leagues from Mosul, the road bifurcated, the branch to the left hand going to Sinjar by way of Tall A'far. Yakut writes that Balad, where there was an Alid shrine, occupied the site of the old Persian town of Shahrabadh, and that the name of Balad was often written Balat. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century refers to Balad as a considerable city, and Mukaddasi tells us of its houses built of stone, well mortared, its good markets, and its Friday Mosque standing in the centre of the town. The neighbourhood produced sugar-cane and was very fertile. On the solitary hill of Tall A'far, one stage to the west, stood a castle, dominating a large suburb through which ran a stream. The castle was strongly fortified, Yakut says, and the date palm grew in the surrounding district, which was known under the name of Al-Mahlabiyah, from the Mahlab perfume, or preserve, of cherry-stones chiefly made here. The right-hand road at the bifurcation beyond Balad led to the town of Ba'aynatha which Mukaddasi describes as lying in the midst of twenty-five fertile districts, the richest and pleasantest of all Mesopotamia, as he adds; and this Ba'aynatha must not be confounded with ' the great village like a city' of the same name on the river which joins the Tigris to the north of Jazirah Ibn 'Omar as mentioned on p. 94. Beyond Ba'aynatha on the road to Nasibin came Barka'id, a place evilly proverbial for the thieving ways of its people, practised against all strangers and their caravans. In the 3rd (9th) century it was a town of considerable size, with three gates, more than two hundred shops, and many 1 The name of the town is written Sinjar, with the last long; the name of the Sultan is generally written Sanjar, with both vowels short.

By the 7th (13th) century, however, though some traffic still passed through it, the evil reputation of its people had caused the place to be avoided by respectable travellers and it had fallen to the size of a village. Adhramah, rather less than half-way between Barka'id and Nasibln, was a place of about the same size as Barka'id; and its district was called Bayn-an-Nahrayn, 4 Betwixt the Streams.' In the 3rd (9th) century it is stated that there had been a fine palace here, and a stone arched bridge crossed its stream, The little town then had double walls, surrounded by a deep ditch. Such at any rate is the description of the place left by the physician of the Caliph Mu'tadid, who passed through it, when in attendance on the latter. In the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi describes Adhramah as a small place standing in the desert near some wells, and there were vaulted buildings round about these 1 . 1 Kud. 214. 1st. 73. I.

The district of Diyar Mudar, as already explained, lay along the banks of the Euphrates, and the chief town was Ar-Rakkah situated just above where the river Balikh, coming down from the north, flows into the Euphrates. The site is that of the old Greek city of Callinicus or Nicephorium, for the Arab name Ar-Rakkah is merely descriptive; Rakkah being the term for the swampy land beside a river subject to periodical inundation, and as such Ar-Rakkah, 4 the Morass,' is found elsewhere as a place-name, this particular Rakkah receiving the surname of As-Saw T da, 'the Black/ for distinction. In the 2nd (8th) century when the Abbasids had succeeded to the Caliphate, Rakkah, one of the chief cities of Upper Mesopotamia commanding the Syrian frontier, had to be secured, and for this purpose the Caliph Manser in 155 (772) proceeded to build some 300 ells distant from Rakkah the town of Ar-Rafikah (the Com panion or Fellow), which was garrisoned by Khurasan troops entirely devoted to the new dynasty. Rafikah is said to have been laid out on the plan of Baghdad, and was a round city. Hariln-ar-Rashid added to the town and built himself a palace here called the Kasr-as-Salam (the Palace of Peace), for he at times resided in Rakkah, or Rafikah, when the climate of102 JAZIRAH. [CHAP. Baghdad was too hot. Soon the older town of Rakkah fell to ruin, new buildings covered all the intervening space, enclosing 'the Morass,' now a shallow lake, lying between Rakkah and Rafikah, and the name of Rakkah passed to Rafikah, which last, once the suburb, took the place of the older city, and lost its name in the process. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century, however, speaks of the twin cities of Rakkah and Rafikah, each with its own Friday Mosque, and he especially mentions the magnifi cent trees which surrounded the towns. Mukaddasi describes only one town, namely Rakkah, as strongly fortified and having two gates; its markets were excellent and well supplied from the neighbouring villages; much traffic also centred here, and from the olive oil produced in the neighbourhood soap was manu factured. The Friday Mosque was, he says, a fine building standing in the Clothiers' market, and each of the great houses at Rakkah had its terraced roof. There w T ere also excellent baths. Near by were the ruins of the old town, then known as Ar- Rakkah-al-Muhtarikah, 'Burnt Rakkah.' Mustawfi on the other hand speaks of Rafikah as still the name of a suburb, with its Friday Mosque standing in the Goldsmiths' market. Round this suburb grew mulberry and jujube trees, and a mosque stood near, overhanging the Euphrates bank. On the right bank of the Euphrates opposite and above Rakkah was the celebrated plain of Sififin, which had been the battlefield between the partizans of the two Caliphs Mu'awiyah and 'Ali. 'The Martyrs,' as the Shi'ahs called those who had fallen in the cause of 'Ali, had their shrines here, and Ibn Hawkal, whose narrative is extended by Mustawfi, relates how miracu lously, from afar off, each buried martyr was quite visible lying in his shroud underground, though, on coming up to the actual spot, no body could be perceived. Opposite the battlefield of Siffin on the north (left) bank of the Euphrates stands the fortress known as Kal'at Ja'bar, after its early possessor, an Arab of the Bam Numayr. Originally this castle had been called Dawsar. It is frequently mentioned in the later history of the Caliphate, and in the year 497 (1104) was taken possession of by the Franks from Edessa, during the time of the first Crusade. On its left bank below Rakkah the Euphrates receives the river Al-Balikh,VII] JAZIRAH. 103 which the Greeks knew as the Bilecha. Its source was at a spring called the 'Ayn-adh-Dhahbaniyah lying to the north of Harran. The name of this spring is given variously by our authorities as Ad-Dahmanah or Adh-Dhahbanah, and Mustawfi (in Persian) writes of the Chashmah Dahanah 1 . The Balikh took its course south and joined the Euphrates below Rakkah, passing by a number of important towns which were irrigated from it or from its tributaries. Harran (the ancient Carrhae) near its source was famous as the home of the Sabians (not identical with the Sabseans, but often confounded with them) who professed to hold the religion of Abraham, and tradition stated that Harran was the first city to be built after the Flood. Mukaddasi describes Harran as a pleasant town protected by a fortress, built of stones so finely set as to recall the masonry of the walls of Jerusalem. It possessed a Friday Mosque. According to Ibn Jubayr, who passed through Harran in 580 (1184), the city itself was also surrounded by a stone wall, and he describes the mosque as having a large court with nineteen doors, while its cupola was supported on marble columns. The markets were roofed over with beams of wood, and the city possessed both a hospital and a college. Mustawfi adds that the circuit of the castle wall was 1350 paces. Three leagues to the south was to be seen the shrine (Mashhad) of Abraham, and the surrounding territory was fully irrigated by innumerable small canals. Edessa, which the Arabs call Ar-Ruha (a corruption of the Greek name Callirrhoe), lay on the head-waters of one of the tributaries of the Balikh. The city is not held of much account by the Moslem geographers, for the majority of its population con tinued to be Christians, and the town was chiefly remarkable for its numerous churches, which Ibn Hawkal estimates at more than 300 in number. Here originally had been preserved the famous relic known as 'the napkin of Jesus/ which had been given up by Moslem authorities to the Byzantines in 332 (944), in order to save Ruha from being stormed and plundered. Mukaddasi in the latter part of the 4th (10th) century, after speaking of the 1 Baladhuri, 179, 297. 1st. 75, 76. I. H. 153, 154. Muk. 141. I. S. 12. I. R. 90. I. K. 175.

Friday Mosque, describes the magnificent cathedral of Edessa, celebrated as one of the four wonders of the world, whose vaulted ceiling was covered with mosaics. The Great Mosque of Al-Aksa at Jerusalem had been built, he says, on its plan. Mukaddasi adds that the city was well fortified. Notwithstanding its Arab garrison at the time of the first Crusade in 492 (1098), Edessa was taken by Baldwin, and during half-a-century remained a Latin principality. In 540 (1145), however, Zangi retook the city from Jocelin II, and after that date Ruha was in the hands of the Moslems. The ruins of its many handsome buildings might still be seen in the 8th (14th) century, and Mustawfi describes a great cupola of finely worked stone, rising beyond a court that was over 100 yards square. Ruha is more than once mentioned by 'All of Yazd in his account of the campaigns of Timiir, and it kept this name down to the beginning of the 9th (15th) century. After it passed into the possession of the Ottoman Turks its name was commonly pronounced Urfah, said to be a corruption of the Arabic Ar-Ruha, and as Urfah Edessa is known at the present day 1 .

In the matter of the famous napkin [Mandil) of Christ once preserved at Edessa, this is one of the many Veronicas, but competent authorities are not agreed as to whether the Edessa Veronica is that now preserved in Rome, or the one shown at Genoa, and there are others. Our earliest Moslem authority, Mas'udi, who wrote in the very year when this famous relic had been delivered up to the Greek Emperor, calls it 'the napkin of Jesus of Nazareth, wherewith He had dried Himself after His baptism,'and Mas'udi mentions the year 332 (944) as that when the Byzantines got possession of it, to their great joy. Ibn Hawkal, writing in the same century, merely calls it 4 the napkin of 'Isa, son of Mariyam, on whom be peace.' Ibn-al-Athir in his chronicle under the year 331 (943) describes it as c the napkin with which it was said the Messiah had wiped His face, whereby the likeness of His face was come thereon,' and he proceeds to relate how the Caliph Muttaki had been induced to give up this napkin to the Emperor of the Greeks in return for the release of many Moslem captives, and to save Ar-Ruha from assault and pillage. The Christian legend concerning the Edessa napkin, as given by Moses of Chorene, is that this relic was a portrait of Christ, wonderfully impressed on a cloth, which He had sent to Abgarus, King of Edessa.

Its gardens were famous, and it was a dependency of Hisn Maslamah, which lay nearer to the Balikh river. This great castle took its name from Maslamah, son of the Omayyad Caliph 'Abd-al-Malik, and it stood nine leagues south of Harran, lying about a mile and a half back from the actual river bank. From this point a canal brought water to the fortress to fill a cistern which Maslamah had caused to be dug here, 200 ells square by 20 deep, and lined throughout with stone. The cistern needed only to be filled once a year, and the canal served for irrigating the lands round Hisn Maslamah. The fortress buildings covered an area of a Jarib (equivalent to a third of an acre), and its walls were fifty ells in height. To the south of Hisn Maslamah on the road to Rakkah, from which it was three leagues distant, stood Bajarwan, which Ibn Hawkal describes as having been a fine town, though in the 4th (10th) century already falling to ruin. Yakut, whose description of Hisn Maslamah has been given above, merely mentions Bajarwan as a village of the Diyar Mudar district Some two hundred miles below Rakkah stands Karkisiya, the ancient Circesium, on the left bank of the Tigris where, as already explained (p. 97), the moiety of the Khabur river flows in. Ibn Hawkal describes it as a fine town surrounded by gardens; but Yak(it and Mustawfi both refer to it as a smaller place than the neighbouring Rahbah, which lay six leagues distant, standing back from the western side of the Euphrates. This Rahbah—the name means the Square or Plain—was called for distinction Rahbah- ash-Sham, 'of Syria,' or Rahbah Malik ibn Tawk after its founder, who had flourished during the reign of the Caliph Mamtln. ' Near it stood the small town of Ad-Daliyah (the Waterwheel) and both places lay near the bank of a great loop canal, called the Nahr Sa'id, which branched from the right bank of the Euphrates some distance above Karkisiya and flowed back to it again above Daliyah, which, like Rahbah, was also known for distinction as Daliyah of Malik ibn T aw k. The canal had been dug by Prince Said, son of the Omayyad Caliph 'Abd-al-Malik; he was a man of great piety, being known as Sa'id-al-Khayr, 'the Good,' and was 1 I. H. 156. Kud. 715- Yak. i. 453, 454, 734; ii. 27 8.io6 JAZIRAH. [CHAP. for some time Governor of Mosul. Rahbah is described by Mukaddasi as one of the largest towns on the Euphrates in Upper Mesopotamia. Its houses spread out in a great semicircle standing back to the desert border, it was well fortified, and had a large suburb. Daliyah was much smaller, but still an important place, standing on an elevation and overlooking the west bank of the Euphrates. In the desert between Rahbah and Rakkah—and the ruins still exist four leagues south of the latter town—was Rusafah (the Causeway), called Rusafah-ash-Sham—of Syria—or Rusafah Hisham, after its founder. The Caliph Hisham, one of the many sons of ^bd-al-Malik, built himself this palace in the desert as a place of safety to reside in at a time when the plague was raging throughout Syria. The spot had already been occupied by the Ghassanid princes before Islam, and there were ancient wells here, YaMt says, 120 ells deep. The physician Ibn Butlan, who wrote in 443 (1051), describes Rusafah as possessing a church, said to have been built by the Emperor Constantine, the exterior of which was ornamented in gold mosaic work, and underneath was a crypt, as large as the church, w T ith its roof supported on marble pillars. In the 5th (nth) century most of the inhabitants were still Christian, and they profitably com bined brigandage with the convoying of caravans across the desert to Aleppo. On the eastern side of the Euphrates between Rakkah and Karkisiya, two- days' march above the latter town, was Al-Khanlikah, a city of some size according to Ibn Hawkal, and YaMt adds that in its vicinity was the territory of Al-Madik. Below Karkisiya the only town of importance within the limits of the Jazirah province was 'Anah, the ancient Anatho ; still found on the map, and mentioned by Ibn Serapion as on an island surrounded by the Euphrates. Ibn Hawkal, however, describes this as formed by a creek branching off from the stream. Yaktit adds that ^nah possessed a strong castle which overlooked the river, and here the Caliph Kaim found shelter in 450 (1058), when Basasiri the Daylamite, after taking possession of Baghdad, had caused the public prayers to be read there in the name of the heterodox Fatimid Caliph of Cairo. Mustawfl says that in the 8th (14th) century £ Anah was still a fine town, andVII] JAZIRAH. famous for its palm-groves. The harbour of Al-Furdah, called Furdah Nu'm for distinction, lay due west of 'Anah on the Euphrates, half-way to Karkisiya, and probably marked the eastern bend of the Euphrates, but it is now no longer to be found on the map. This was an important station where the highway bifurcated, to the left-hand one road going direct across the desert by way of Rusafah to Rakkah, while the right-hand road kept up stream along the river bank 1 . Above Rakkah there were three towns on the Euphrates, namely Balis, Jisr Manbij, and Sumaysat, which were often counted as of Syria because they lay on the right or western bank of that river, though most authorities count them as belonging to Jazirah. Balis lies due west of Rakkah, at the limit of the plain of Siffln, where the Euphrates after running south turns east. It was the Roman Barbalissus, the great river-port for Syria on the Euphrates, and hence the centre point of many caravan routes. Ibn Hawkal describes Balis as having strong walls, with gardens lying between these and the Euphrates; of its lands the chief crops were wheat and barley. Though somewhat fallen to ruin, Mukaddasi says, Balis was still populous in the 4th (roth) century; but YaMt reports that, by a change of bed, the Euphrates in the 7th (13th) century had come to flow more than four miles distant from the town, and Abu-l-Eida refers to Balis as a place that had long seen its best days. Jisr Manbij, where a bridge of boats crossed the Euphrates, and the road led west up to Manbij (Hierapolis) of the Aleppo province, was a place of great importance during the middle-ages. The bridge was protected by a great fortress, and below this a small town stood on the Euphrates bank. The fortress was known as Kal'at-an-Najm, 'the Castle of the Star,' from its height on the hill, and it was also called Hisn Manbij, ' the Manbij Fortress.' When Ibn Jubayr passed Kal'at-an-Najm, coming from Harran in 580 (1184), he speaks of the market which was held below its walls. Abu-l-Fida says that the fort had been rebuilt by Sultan Nur-ad- Din, son of Zangi, and its garrison freely harassed the neighbouring 1 1st. 77, 78. I. H. 155, 156. Muk. 142.

Kazwini, writing in the latter half of the 7th (13th) century, gives a long account of the frauds practised by sharpers here who, getting acquainted with rich travellers passing Karat-an-Najm, by means of games of hazard, aided by confederates, would win all their money and possessions. The play ran so high that, according to Kazwini, the stranger was often left 4 with nothing but his drawers (sdrawtl) of all his clothes or former possessions.' The sharpers, indeed, would sometimes hold the victim himself in pawn, until his companions could be induced to buy him off. Sumaysat, the Roman Samosata, was still higher up the Euphrates, and lay on the right or north bank of the great river, which here runs west. It was a very strong fortress. Mas'Mi states that Sumaysat was also known as Kal'at-at-Tin, 'the Clay Castle,' and Yakftt reports that in the 7th (13th) cen tury one of its quarters was exclusively inhabited by Armenians. Finally to complete the list of towns of the Mudar district Sarfrj is to be mentioned, which lies about half-way on the direct road from Rakkah north, across the desert plain, to Sumaysat; this road forming the chord of the great semicircular sweep followed by the Euphrates. Sarfrj was also on the caravan road from Harran and Edessa to Jisr Manbij, and is described by Ibn Hawkal as a fine city, surrounded by fertile districts, a description which Yak lit, adding nothing further, corroborates 1 . The cities of Diyar Bakr, the smallest of the three districts into which the Jazirah province was divided, lay exclusively on, or to the north of, the upper course of the Tigris. The chief town of the district was Amid, sometimes written Hamid, the Roman Amida. In later times the city was generally known under the name of the district, as it is at the present day, being called Diyar Bakr, or else Kara Amid (Black Amid) from the colour of the stone used here. The town stood on the right or west bank of the Tigris, and a hill 100 fathoms in height dominated it. Ibn Hawkal states that its walls were built of black mill-stones. Mukaddasi describes its strong fortifications as being like those of Antioch, the outer walls, 1 1st. 62, 76, 78. I. H. 119, 120, 154, 157. Muk. 155. Mas. i. 215. I.J. 250.

There were springs of water within the town and Mukaddasi also remarks on the black stone of which, and on which, he says the city was built. Amid possessed a fine Friday Mosque, and its walls were pierced by five chief gates, namely the Water gate, the Mountain gate, the Bab-ar-Rflm (the Greek gate), the Hill gate, and the Postern gate (Bab-as-Sirr) used in time of war. The line of fortified walls included the hill in their circuit, and in the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi says that the Moslems possessed no stronger or better fortress than Amid on their frontier against the Greek Empire. Nasir-i-Khusraw the Persian pilgrim passed through Amid in 438 (1046), and has left a careful description of the city as he saw it. The town was 2000 paces in length and in breadth, and the wall built of black stone surrounded the hill overlooking it. This wall was 20 yards in height and 10 yards broad, no mortar was used in its construction, but each stone block was, Nasir estimates, of the weight of 1000 man (equivalent to about three tons). At every hundred yards along the wall was built a semicircular tower, and the crest had battlements of the aforesaid black stone, while stone gangways at intervals led up to the ramparts from within the circuit. There were four iron gates, facing the cardinal points; namely, to the east the Tigris gate, to the north the Armenian gate (Bab-al-Arman), to the west the Greek gate, and to the south the Hill gate (Bab-at-Tall). Beyond the city wall ran the outer wall, ten yards in height, also of black stone, a suburb occupying the space between the two, in a ring that was fifteen yards across. This outer wall also had battlements, and a gangway along it for the defence, and there were here four iron gates corresponding with those of the inner wall. Amid, Nasir adds, was one of the strongest places he had seen. In the centre of the town a great spring of water, sufficient to turn five mills, gushed out; the water was excellent, and its overflow irrigated the neighbouring gardens. The Friday Mosque was a beautiful building, of black stone like the rest of the town, with a great gable roof and containing over 200 columns,IIO JAZIRAH. [CHAP. each a monolith, every two connected by an arch, which supported in turn a row of dwarf columns under the roof line. The ceiling was of carved wood, coloured and varnished. In the mosque court was a round stone basin, from the midst of which a brass jet shot up a column of clear water, which kept the level within the basin always the same. Near the mosque stood a great church, built of stone and paved with marble, the walls finely sculptured; and leading to its sanctuary Nasir saw an iron gate of lattice-work, so beautifully wrought that never had he seen the equal thereof. This description of the magnificence of Amid is borne out by what the anonymous annotator of the Paris MS. of Ibn Hawkal writes, who was here in 534 (1140). He notes that its markets were well built and full of merchandise. In the 7th (13th) century YaMt and Kazwini repeat much of the foregoing description, and the latter speaks of Amid as then covering a great half-circle of ground, with the Tigris flowing to the eastward, and surrounded on the other side by magnificent gardens. Mustawfi in the following century writes of it as a medium-sized town, paying the Il-Khans a revenue of 3000 gold pieces. At the close of this century Amid was taken by Timtir 1 . To the north of Amid, and near one of the eastern arms of the upper Tigris, stands the town of Ham, which is said by Yaktit to be famous for the iron mine in its neighbourhood, which produced much metal for export. Ham is also mentioned by Mustawfi. Some distance to the west of Hani lies the chief source of the Tigris, which Mukaddasi describes as flowing with a rush of green water out of a dark cave. At first, he says, the stream is small, and only of sufficient volume to turn a single mill- wheel ; but many affluents soon join and swell the current, the uppermost of these being the Nahr-adh-Dhib (the Wolf River), apparently identical with the Nahr-al-Kilab (the River of Dogs) referred to by Yaktit, which came down from the hills near Shimshat, to the north of Hani. The source of the Tigris, according to Yakiit, was distant two and a half days' journey from Amid, at a place known as HaWras, 'where 'Ali, the 1 1st. 75. I. H. 150, 151. Muk. 140. N. K. 8.

The names of many other affluents are mentioned both by Mukaddasi and YaMt, whose accounts are not quite easy to reconcile, and probably the names of these streams varied considerably between the 4th and the 7 th (10th and 13th) centuries. Some distance below Amid the Tigris turns due east at a right angle, and then from the north receives a stream called the Nahr-ar-Rams or the Nahr Salb. A more important affluent, however, is the river coming down from the north of Mayyafarikin, a tributary of which flowed by that city. This is the river Satidama, or Satidamad, one branch of which was called the Wadi-az-Ztir flowing from the district of Al-Kalk, while the Satidama river itself had its head-waters in the Darb-al-Kilab— ^the Dogs' Pass'—so called, Yaktit says, from a famous massacre of the Greeks, 'when these were all killed like dogs,' which the Persian army effected in the reign of King Aniishirwan, some time before the birth of the prophet Muhammad. This river Satidama, which is mentioned by Ibn Serapion, is that which Mukaddasi names the Nahr-al-Masuliyat, and is now known as the Batman Su, one of whose affluents, as already said, flows down from Mayyafarikin 1 . The Arabic Mayyafarikm appears to be a corruption of the Aramaic name Maypharkath, or the Armenian Moufargin, and it is identical with the Greek town called Martyropolis. Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century describes it as a fine city, surrounded by a stone wall, with battlements and a deep ditch, beyond which stretched extensive suburbs. Its mosque was well built, but Mu kaddasi remarks that its gardens were scanty. Mayyafarikm was visited by Nasir-i-Khusraw in 438 (1046), who speaks of the town as surrounded by a wall built of great white stones, each of 500 man weight (about a ton and a half), and while all Amid, as already said, was of black stone, in every building at Mayyafarikin the stones used were notably white. The town wall was then new, it had good battlements and at every 50 yards rose a white stone tower. The city had but one gateway, opening to the west, 1 1. S. 17, 18. Muk. 144. Yak. ii. 188, 551,* 55 2 &gt; 5^3, 95^; iii. 7' 413; iv. 300, 979. Mst. 165.112 JAZIRAH. [CHAP. and this possessed a solid iron door, no wood having been used in its construction. There was according to Nasir a fine mosque within the city, also a second Friday Mosque in the suburb outside, standing in the midst of the markets, and beyond lay many gardens. He adds that at a short distance to the north of Mayyafarikin stood a second town called Muhdathah, 'the New Town,' with its own Friday Mosque, bath houses, and markets; while four leagues further distant was the city of Nasriyah, lately founded by the Mirdasid Amir Nasr, surnamed Shibl-ad-Dawlah. Both Yaktit and Kazwini give a long account of various churches, of the three towers, and the eight town gates, which had existed of old at Mayyafarikin—the Greek name of which, YaMt says, was Madursala, meaning 'the City of the Martyrs.' These buildings dated from the days of the Emperor Theodosius, and some of their remains, especially those of an ancient church built, it was said, ' in the time of the Messiah,' might still be seen in the 7th (13th) century. Thus there was in particular, on the summit of the south-western tower of the town wall, a great cross, set up to face Jerusalem, and this cross, it was reported, was the work of the same craftsman who had made the great cross that adorned the pinnacle of the Church of the Resurrection in Jeru salem, the two crosses being alike, and wonderful to behold. Further, in the Jews' quarter of Mayyafarikin near the Synagogue, was to be seen a black marble basin, in which was kept a glass belt (possibly a phylactery), wherein was preserved some of the blood of Joshua the son of Nun, this having been brought hither from Rome, and to touch it was a sovereign remedy against all disease. In the 8th (14th) century under the Mongols Mayya farikin was still an important place, and Mustawfi' praises its excellent climate and abundant fruits 1 . Arzan, a short distance to the east of Mayyafarikin, stood on the western side of the river called the Nahr, or Wadi, as-Sarbat. Arzan had a great castle, well fortified, and it was visited in 438 (1046) by Nasir-i-Khusraw. He writes of it as a flourishing place with excellent markets, being surrounded by fertile and well irrigated gardens. Yakut describes Arzan (which must not be I. H. 151. Muk. 140. N. K. 7. Yak. iv. 703—707. Kaz. ii. 379. Mst. 167.vii] jazirah. 113 confounded with Arzan-ar-Riim or Erzerum which will be noticed in the next chapter) as in his day gone to ruin; but Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century, who generally spells the name Arzanah, speaks of it as though it were still a flourishing place. r; On the southern bank of the Etrph-rates, between where the two rivers from Mayyafarikin and Arzan flow in from the north, stands the castle called Hisn Kayfa, or Kifa, which the Greeks called Kiphas or Cephe. Mukaddasi describes the place as a strongly fortified castle, and the markets of its suburbs were plentifully supplied. There were, he adds, many churches here, and the anonymous annotator of the ms. of Ibn Hawkal, already referred to, writing in the 6th (12th) century, speaks of the great stone bridge which crossed the Tigris here, and which had been restored by the Amir Fakhr-ad-Din Kara Arslan in the year 510 (1116). Below the castle, at that time, was a populous suburb, with many markets and hostelries, the houses being well built of mortared stone. The surrounding district was fertile, but the climate was bad, and the plague was often rife during the summer heats. Yakiit, who had been at Hisn Kayfa, says that suburbs had formerly existed here on both banks of the Tigris, and he considered the great bridge as one of the finest works he had seen. It consisted of a single great arch, which rose above two smaller arches, and these, presumably by a central pier, divided the bed of the Tigris. In the next century Mustawfi describes Hisn Kayfa as a large town, but for the most part gone to ruin, though still inhabited by a numerous population. The hill known as Tall Fafan, with a town of this name at its foot, stood on the northern or left bank of the Tigris, some 50 miles east of Hisn Kayfa, where the river makes its great bend south. The town, Mukaddasi writes, in the 4th (10th) century was surrounded by gardens, its markets were well provisioned, and though the houses were mostly clay-built, the market streets were roofed over. The river which joins the Tigris at Tall Fafan comes down from Badlis (Bitlis), rising in the mountains of Armenia to the south-west of Lake Van. This river is joined by a great affluent rising to the south of the lake, which Mukaddasi and Yakut name the Wadi-ar-Razm, and the Tigris below the junction of their united streams became navigable for boats. On L e S. 8114 JAZIRAH. [CHAP.

Yakiit more than once refers to it, but gives no description; Mustawfi, however, speaks of Sa/ird as a large town, famed for the excellent copper vessels made by its smiths; and the drinking cups from here were exported far and wide. Near Is'irt, according to Kazwini, was the small town of Hlzan, where alone in all Mesopo tamia the chestnut-tree (Shah-balut) grew abundantly 1 . 1 1st. 76. I. H. 152. Muk. 141, 145. N. K. 7.

The cities and districts lying along the banks of the Eastern and Western upper Euphrates (for the great river had two head- streams) were generally counted as dependent on northern Mesopotamia, and are often included in the Jazirah province. The Eastern Euphrates, the southernmost of the two branches of the river, and by some geographers counted as the main source, is the Arsanias Flumen of Tacitus and Pliny. In the 4th (icth) century Ibn Serapion still calls this the Nahr Arsanas, and the same name is given to it by Yakut as in use in the 7th (13th) century, who refers to the extreme coldness of its waters. At the present day it is generally known to the Turks as the Murad Sti, being so named, it is commonly said, in honour of Sultan Murad IV, who conquered Baghdad in 1048 (1638). The Arsanas took its rise in the Tar tin country, a name the Armenians write Daron, and the Greeks knew of as Taronites, which includes the mountains lying to the north of Lake Van. The first place of importance on the Arsanas was the town of Malazkird, which in the various dialects of this region was also known as Minazjird, Manzikart, and Milasgird. In the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi describes Malazkird as a strong fortress with a mosque in its market street, the place being surrounded by 8—2116 THE UPPER EUPHRATES. [CHAP. many gardens. In 463 (1071) Manzikart, as the Greeks called it, was the field of the decisive battle between the Byzantines and Moslems, when the Emperor Romanus IV (Diogenes) was taken prisoner by the Saljiiks, this leading up to their conquest and permanent settlement in Asia Minor. Yaktit more than once refers to Minazjird or Minazkird, and Mustawfi, who gives the name as Malazjird, praises its strong castle, its excellent climate, and its fertile lands. The town of Miish to the south of the Arsanas, in the great plain on the west of Lake Van, is often counted as of Armenia. It is mentioned by Yakilt, and Mustawfi describes it as having excellent pasture lands, watered by streams that flowed north to the Eastern Euphrates and south to the Tigris. The town was in his day in ruins 1 . The Arsanas received on its right bank two affluents coming down from the north, and the Kalikala country. These affluents are important as they enable us to fix the approximate position of Shimshat, a town of some note, which has disappeared from the map, and which has often been confounded with Sumaysat on the Euphrates already mentioned (p. 108). Ibn Serapion states that the first affluent was the Nahr-adh-Dhib, 'the Wolf River,' which rising in Kalikala fell into the Arsanas a short distance above Shimshat- the second was the Salkit river, which rose in the mountains called Jabal Martir (or Maziir) and joined the Arsanas one mile below Shimshat. A reference to the map shows that these two streams are those now known respectively as the Gunek Su and the Pen Chay; the Kalikala country representing the mountain region lying between the Arsanas and the Western Euphrates, and to the west of the Tariin country. Shamshat (Shimshat) was much the most important place on the Arsanas, which Ibn Serapion also refers to as the river of Shimshat, and the town appears to have stood on the southern or left bank of the river. Shamshat is undoubtedly the Arsamosata pf the Greeks, and Yakut—who particularly remarks that it is not 1 L S. 11.^ Kud. 246, 251. Muk. 376. Yak. i. 207; iv. 648, 682. Mst. i 65' i ^7- Hajji Khalfah (J. N. 426) in 1010 (1600) is apparently our earliest authority for the Eastern Euphrates being called the Murad Su, and as his work was apparently written before the reign of Sultan Murad Iv', this goes to prove that the stream was not called after that monarch, as is commonly said.VIII] THE UPPER EUPHRATES. 11/ to be confounded with Sumaysat—says that Shamshat lay between PaMyah (modern PaM) and Hisn Ziyad (modern Kharpfit). In the 7th (13th) century when Yakut wrote, Shamshat was already in ruins, but the data above given by Ibn Serapion and Yakfit enable us to fix its position within narrow limits. The fortress of Hisn Ziyad, which Ibn Khurdadbih mentions as situated at no great distance from Shamshat, was on the authority of Yakut the Arab name for the Armenian Khartabirt, now more generally called Kharput. Mustawfi gives the spelling Kharbirt, but adds no details, referring to it merely as a large town enjoying a good climate. In this district Baladhun and other early authorities mention the bridge of Yaghra, which crossed a stream that was probably some tributary of the Arsanas, and this bridge {Jisr) lay 10 miles distant from Shamshat; its exact position, however, is unknown. Then about a hundred miles to the westward of Sham shat the Arsanas or Eastern Euphrates finally mingles its stream with the Western Euphrates 1 . The Western Euphrates has generally been considered the main branch of the great river, and it is that now commonly known to the Turks as the Kara Sii (Black Water), and this is the Nahr-al-Furat of Ibn Serapion. According to him it took its rise in the mountains called Jabal Akradkhis (the name is apparently written Afradkhis by Mas^di, and other variants occur) which are of the Kalikala country to the north of Erzerum. This important town, which the Arabs called Arzan-ar-Rum or Ard-ar-Rtim (the Land of the Romans), the Armenians knew as Karin, and the Greeks as Theodosiopolis. It is the Moslem city of Kalikala, and the chief place in this district. The origin of the name Kalikala, so frequently mentioned by all the earlier Arab geographers, appears to be unknown, but all agree that this was the country in which the Western Euphrates, the Araxes river, • and the affluents of the Arsanas took their rise. Of the town of Erzerum the earlier Arab geographers afford no details, except to state that it was a great city: Mustawfi speaks of there being many fine churches here, one especially with a dome whose circle was fifty ells in diameter. Opposite this'' 1 1. S. 10, 13, 30. I. K. 123. Baladhuri, 139. Yak. ii. 276, 417; iii. 319. Mst. 262.118 THE UPPER EUPHRATES. [CHAP. church was a mosque built on the model of the Ka'bah at Mecca. Ibn Batiitah, who was in Arz-ar-Riim (as he writes the name) in 733 ( I 333)) describes it as a large city, belonging to the Sultan of ^rak, for the most part in ruins, but still famous for its gardens, and three rivers ran through its suburbs. Eight leagues to the east of Arzan-ar-Rtim, on the summit of a mountain and near one of the head-streams of the Araxes, is Avnik, a great fortress, of which Mustawfi says that the town at its foot was named Abaskhtir (or Abshakhiir). It belonged to Arzan-ar-Rtlm, and Yaldit adds that the district was called Basin. At the close of the 8th (14th) century Timur took Avmk after a long siege, and it is frequently mentioned in the history of his campaigns. Some 200 miles west of Arzan-ar-Riam and on the right or north bank of the Euphrates, is the town of Arzanjan, which Yakiit says was more often called Arzingan. He speaks of it as a fine town well provisioned, in his day inhabited for the most part by Armenians, who openly drank wine to the scandal of their Moslem fellow-citizens. Mustawfi adds that its walls had been restored by the Saljiik Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din Kaykubad at the close of the 7th (13th) century, and that they w T ere built of well-cut jointed stone masonry. Arzanjan had an excellent climate, its lands producing corn, cotton, and grapes in abundance. Ibn Batiitah who passed through here in 733 (1333) writes of it as mostly inhabited by Turkish-speaking Armenians, who were Moslems. In the neighbourhood were copper mines, and the brass work of the native smiths was famous; the markets were good and much cloth was woven in the town. Babirt to the north of Arzanjan is mentioned by Yaktit as a considerable town, mostly peopled by Armenians; but Mustawfi adds that in his day it had much diminished in importance. The fortress of Kamkh (or Kamakh) lay on the Western Euphrates a day's journey below Arzanjan, on the left or south bank of the river. It is frequently mentioned by Ibn Serapion and the earlier Arab geographers, and was the Greek Kamacha. Mustawfi describes it as a great castle, with a town below on the river bank, and many fertile villages were of its dependencies 1 . 1 I. S. 10. I. R. 89. I. K. 174. Mas. i. 214. Tanhih 52. Yak. i. 205,VIII] THE UPPER EUPHRATES. 119 Sixty miles or more to the west of Kamkh the Euphrates^ which from Erzerum has flowed westward, makes a great bend and takes its course south, and it here receives on its right bank the river called by Ibn Serapion the Nahr Abnk, from the castle of Abrik which is on its upper course. This is the stream now known as the Chaltah Irmak, which comes down from Divnk or Divrigi. In Mustawfi and Ibn Bibi the name is given as Difrigi, which the Byzantines wrote Tephrike (the form Aphrike also occurs in the Greek mss*), and the earlier Arab geographers shortened this to Abrik. The place was celebrated at the close of the 3rd (9th) century as the great stronghold of the Paulicians, a curious sect of Eastern Christians whose Manichaean beliefs caused them to be ruthlessly persecuted by the orthodox Emperors of Constanti nople. The Paulicians, whose name the Arab writers give under the form of Al-Baylakam, took possession of Tephrike, fortified it, and countenanced or aided by the Caliphs, for some years successfully defied the armies of Constantinople. Kudamah and Mas'Mi, who are nearly contemporary authorities, both refer to the castle of Abrik as 'the capital of the Baylakani'; and 'Ali of Herat (quoted by YaMt) writing in the 7th (13th) century has left a curious account of a great cave and a church near Al-Abnik (as he spells the name) where were preserved the bodies of certain martyrs, which he considered to be those of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. A short distance to the south of the Chaltah Irmak and Divrik, the Sarichichek Sti joins the Euphrates, on which stands the fortress of 'Arabgir. This place does not appear to be mentioned by any of the earlier Arab geographers, though Ibn Bibi in his Saljtik chronicle of the 8th (14th) century names it more than once; also under the form Arabraces it is found in the Byzantine chronicles. 'Arabgir in any case does not represent Abrik and Tephrike, as has been sometimes erroneously urged. Apparently the earliest occurrence of the name of 'Arabgir or 'Arabkir in any Moslem geographer is to be found in the Turkish Jahan Numa of Hajji Khalfah at the beginning of the nth (17th) century. -206, 408, 444; iii. 860; iv. 19, 304.

He also mentions Divriki (as the town is now called), but unfor tunately we have no description of the old Paulician stronghold 1 . Malatiyah, which the Greeks called Melitene, was in early days one of the most important fortresses of the Moslem frontier against the Byzantines. Baladhun states that its garrison held the bridge, three miles distant from the fort, where the high road crossed the Kubakib river near its junction with the Euphrates. The Kubakib is the river known to the Greeks as the Melas, and called by the Turks at the present time the Tukhmah Sti, and it rises far to the west of Malatiyah in the mountains from which the Jayhan, the ancient Pyramus, flows south-west (as will be noticed in the next chapter) to the Mediterranean in the Bay of Alexandretta. Except for the Arsanas the river Kubakib is by far the most important of the many affluents of the upper Euphrates, and the Kubakib itself has many tributaries that are duly named by Ibn Serapion. The city of Malatiyah was rebuilt by order of the Caliph Manser in 139 (756)^ who provided it with a fine mosque, and he garrisoned it with 4000 men. Istakhn describes it in the 4th (10th) century as a large town surrounded by hills on which grew vines, almonds, and nut-trees, for its lands produced the crops of both the hot and the cold regions. It was more than once taken by the Byzantines and retaken by the Moslems, and YaMt in the 7th (13th) century counts it as of the Greek country. Mustawfi in the next century speaks of Malatiyah as a fine town with a strong fortress. Its pasture lands were famous, corn, cotton, and abundant fruit being grown in the neighbourhood. On a mountain peak near Malatiyah was the convent called Dayr Barstlma, which Kazwini describes as greatly venerated by the Christians, and as inhabited by many monks. The fortress of Tarandah, the modern Darandah—under which form it is mentioned in the Jahan Numa —lay on the upper waters of the Kubakib, three marches above Malatiyah. A Moslem garrison was placed here, to hold the pass, as early as the year 83 (702), but the post was subsequently abandoned in 100 (719) by order of the Caliph ^mar II. In the Byzantine chronicles 1 I. S. 11, 31. Kud. 254. Mas. viii. 74. Tanbih 151, 183. Yak. i. 87. Ibn Bibi, 210, 318. Mst. 162. J. N. 624. Cf also J. R. A.

The river Kubakib had an important tributary, the Nahr Karakis, which joined it from the south, and on the upper waters of the Karakis stood the great fortress of Zibatrah, which the Byzantines called Sozopetra or Zapetra, the ruins of which are probably those of Viran Shahr, some leagues to the south of Malatiyah on the river Sultan Su, the modern name of the Karakis. Baladhun and Istakhri both speak of Zibatrah as a great fortress on the Greek frontier, many times dismantled by the Byzantines and rebuilt by the Caliph Mansftr and later by Mamun. Yak6t and other authorities couple together the names of Zibatrah and the fortress Al-Hadath, which will be noticed presently. In the Arab and Byzantine chronicles Zibatrah or Sozopetra is famous for its capture by the Emperor Theophilus, and again for its recapture by the Caliph Mu'tasim in his great expedition against 'Amunyah, which will be mentioned in the next chapter. Zibatrah long continued a place of importance, but Abu-l-Fida who visited it in the year 715 (1315) describes the fortress as then a ruin. The line of the old walls could at this time barely be traced, and its fields were completely wasted, so that Abu-l-Fida found excellent hunting in the oak woods near the formerly well-cultivated lands, the hares here being, he says, of a size not met with elsewhere. He describes the place as two marches south of Malatiyah and the same distance from Hisn Mansur, which will be noticed below 2 . The fortress of Al-Hadath, the Byzantine Adata, was taken by the Moslems in the reign of the Caliph 'Omar, and is frequently mentioned in the chronicles. The word in Arabic means 1 I. S. 10, 12, 13.

The ruins of the old town are at Eski-Shahr, a league from the ancient bridge, called Kirkgoz, crossing the Tukhmah Su immediately above its junction with the Euphrates. 2 I. S. 13. Baladhuri, 191. 1st. 63. Yak. ii. 914. A. F. 234. The identification of the sites of Zibatrah and Hadath are discussed by Mr J. G. C. Anderson in the Classical Review for April, 1896, in his paper on paign of Basil I against the Paulicians i 872 a.d.122 THE UPPER EUPHRATES. [CHAP. 4 news,' and more especially 'bad news,' and Baladhuri says that the road thither, of old called Darb-al-Hadath, 4 the Road of Bad News, ? was changed to Darb-as-Salamah, 'the Road of Safety/ after the capture of the fortress by the Moslems. Darb-as-Salamah, however, as will be mentioned in the following chapter, is more generally the name given to the Constantinople road, going by the Cilician Gates. There was a mosque at Hadath, and the town was rebuilt by the Caliph Mahdi in 162 (779), and again restored by Hartin-ar-Rashid, who kept a garrison here of 2000 men. Istakhri mentions its fertile lands, and relates how this frontier fortress had been taken and retaken many times alter nately by Byzantines and Moslems. According to YaMt and others Al-Hadath was called Al-Hamra, 'the Red,' because of the colour of the ground thereabout, and the castle stood on a hill called Al-Uhaydab, 'the Little Hump-back.' In 343 (954), after many vicissitudes, it was finally taken from the Greeks and rebuilt by Sayf-ad-Dawlah the Hamdanid, and in 545 (1150) it passed into the hands of Mas'M, son of Kilij Arslan the Saljiik. The river near which Hadath stood was called the Jtinth or HtMth; this Ibn Serapion, in error, gives as an affluent of the Kubakib (the Malatiyah river), but Yaldit, who writes the name Htirith, rightly says that it was a tributary of the Nahr Jayhan, the Pyramus. Ibn Serapion records that the source of the Hadath river was at a spring called 'Ayn Zanitha, and that before passing Hadath it ran through' a series of small lakes; further, that the J^rith river (as he writes the name) was joined by the river Al-'Arjan, whose sources were in the Jabal-ar-Rish, the town of Hadath being supplied by water-channels from the 'Arjan river, to which they again returned. To supplement this Abu-l-Fida states that Hadath lay twelve miles distant from a place on the main stream of the Jayhan where that river was crossed at 'the Ford of- the Alid.' The exact site of Hadath has not been identified, but there is little doubt that it protected the pass going from Mar'ash (Germanicia) to Al-Bustan (Arabissus), and that it lay on the banks of the present Ak S6, near Inikli, the Ak Su being in fact one of the head-waters of the Jayhan 1 . 1 Baladhuri, 189—191.

F. 263.VIII] THE UPPER EUPHRATES. 123 Each of the two fortresses of Hisn Manstir and Bahasna (which exist to the present day) lies on its own river, and both these are right-bank affluents of the Euphrates, joining it successively below Sumaysat. Hisn Mansur, in modern days more often called Adiaman, w T as by the Byzantines called Perrhe. It took its name from its builder, Manstir of the tribe of Kays, who was commander of this frontier station during the reign of the last Omayyad Caliph, Marwan II, having been killed in 141 (75^)* Hisn Manstir was re-fortified by Hartoi-ar-Rashid during the Caliphate of his father Mahdi, and it is described by Ibn Hawkal as a small town with a Friday Mosque. Its fields were well irrigated, but Ibn Hawkal writes that the fate of this place, like other frontier fortresses, was to be ravaged and dismantled alter nately by the Byzantines and the Moslems. Yakut adds that the town had a wall with three gates and a ditch outside; and that in its midst stood the fortress defended by a double wall. When Abu-l-Fida wrote in the 8th (14th) century Hisn Manser was a ruin, though the fields round it were still cultivated. The Nahr-al-Azrak (the Blue River) passed down to the north-west of Hisn Manser, this fortress occupying the table lands above the Euphrates, which flowed along their southern border. The fortress of Bahasna, which the crusading chronicles call Behesdin, lies to the west of Hisn Manstir, and its dis trict was called Kaystim. Bahasna stood on a hill-top, and had a Friday Mosque in the town below, where there were excellent markets, the surrounding country being very fertile. YaMt speaks of it as an impregnable castle. The neighbouring Sanjah river, which appears to be that which the Greeks called Singas, had on its banks the small town of Sanjah, near which the stream was crossed by a celebrated bridge, built of dressed stone, with well-set arches of beautiful workmanship. This bridge, the Kantarah Sanjah, was one of the wonders of the world according to Ibn Hawkal. Yakilt, who speaks of the Sanjah and the Kaysum rivers, reporting both as affluents of the Euphrates, describes this great bridge as being of a single arch, going from bank to bank, and over 200 paces in span. It was built, he adds, of huge well-dressed blocks of stone, each block being ten ells124 THE UPPER EUPHRATES. [CHAP. long and five high, the width not being shown, and it had been constructed, he affirms, by aid of a talisman 1 . In the matter of trade, the province of Jazirah or Upper Mesopotamia produced little. Mukaddasi gives us a list and the items are chiefly the natural products of the land. Mosul, the capital, exported grain, honey, charcoal, cheese, butter, the sumach fruit and pomegranate pips, manna, salted meat, and the tirrikh fish; also iron, and for artificers' work knives, arrows, chains, and goblets. The district of Sinjar produced almonds, pome granates, sumach fruit, and sugar-cane; Nasibm, walnuts; Rakkah, olive oil, soap, and reeds for pens. Rahbah was famous for its quinces; Harran for its honey and the preserve called Kubbayt; Jazirah Ibn ^mar for nuts, almonds, and butter, also excellent horses were reared on its pastures. Hasaniyah on the Little Khabfo (on the east bank of the Tigris) produced cheese, partridges, fowls, and fruit preserve; the neighbouring Ma'alathaya, charcoal, grapes and other fresh fruits, salted meat, hemp seed and hemp stuffs; and finally Amid in Diyar Bakr was famous for its woollen and linen fabrics 2 . The high roads of Upper Mesopotamia are in continuation 1 Baladhuri, 192. 1st. 62. I. H. 120. Yak. i. 770; ii. 278; iii. 162, 860. A. F. 265, 269. The Sanjah bridge .is always given as one of the four wonders of the world—the other three are the church at Edessa already mentioned, the Pharos at Alexandria, and the Great Mosque at Damascus (Yak. ii. 591). It is curious that Mukaddasi on two occasions confounds this bridge over the Sanjah, which last by all accounts was a right-bank affluent of the Euphrates joining it near Sumaysat, with the no less remarkable bridge at Al-Hasaniyah, which was built over the Lesser Khabur, an affluent of the Tigris (Muk. 139, 147? and see above, p. 93), The stream now known as the Bolam St!l which, after heing joined by the Kakhtah Chay, falls into the Euphrates from the north a short distance above Sumaysat, is apparently the Nahr Sanjah of the Arab geographers; and the great bridge, so famous as one of the wonders of the world, still exists. It was built by Vespasian, and by a single arch of 112 feet span crosses the Bolam Su just above the junction of the Kakhtah Chay. It is described as 4 one of the most splendid monuments of the Roman period in existence,' and an illustration of it will be found in the Geographical Journal for October, 1896, p. 323; also, with more detail, in Humann and Puchstein, Reisen in Kleinasien, plates 41, 42, and 43. 2 Muk. 145, 146.THE UPPER EUPHRATES. 125 of those of 'Irak. The post-road from Baghdad to Mosul, going up the eastern bank of the Tigris, entered the Jazirah province at Takrit; it continued on the left bank of the river, going straight to Jabulta, whence by way of Sinn and Hadithah Mosul was reached. This road is given by our earlier Arab authorities and by Mustawfi 1 . From Mosul the post-road, changing to the right or western bank of the Tigris, went up to Balad, where it bifurcated, the left road going by Sinjar to Karkisiya on the Euphrates, the right through Nasibin to Kafartutha, where again it bifurcated, the right leading to Amid, the left by Ras-al-'Ayn down to Rakkah on the Euphrates. This main road from Mosul to Amid is given by Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, also—but in marches—by Mukaddasi; and the same authorities give the cross roads to the Euphrates. Mukaddasi also gives the marches from Mosul straight to Jazirah Ibn 'Omar by Hasaniyah, and he mentions the road from Amid by Arzan to Badlis near Lake Van 2 . The post-road up the Euphrates kept along its right or western bank, from AWsah passing 'Anah to the river harbour of Al-Eurdah. Here it bifurcated, one road running beside the Euphrates up to Fash opposite Karkisiya, and thence still along the western side of the river to Rakkah; while the left road of the bifurcation at Furdah went straight across the desert through Rusafah to Rakkah, thus avoiding the windings of the Euphrates. Rusafah, further, was an important station, for here two roads went off to the west across the Syrian desert, namely to Damascus and to Hims (Emessa). At Karkisiya and Rakkah, as already said, branch roads came in, one from Mosul Sinjar, the other from Nasibin via Ras-al-'Ayn and Bajarwan; while from Rakkah by Bajarwan a road went through Harran and Ruha (Edessa) to Amid. Lastly from Rakkah, via Sariij, the direct road, avoiding the great bend of the Euphrates, reached Sumaysat; whence the various distances to Hisn Mansur, Malatiyah, Kamkh and the other fortresses are mentioned in round numbers.

[chap. geographers not unnaturally knew little of the country that was in their day a province of the Roman empire, and after it had come under the rule of the Saljtik Turks our Moslem authorities unfor tunately almost entirely neglect this outlying province of Islam. No systematic description of it, such as we possess of the other provinces, therefore has come down to us, and the first com plete account of Moslem Asia Minor is that written by Hajji Khalfah, which only dates from the beginning of the nth (17th) century, when for nearly two^Jxmidred years this province had form ed part _ Qf the Ottoman empire \ Under the Omayyads, as under the Abbasid Caliphs down to rather more than a century and a half before the final overthrow of their dynasty by the Mongols, the frontier line between the Moslems and the Byzantines was formed by the great ranges of the Taurus and Anti-Taurus. Here a long line of fortresses (called Ath-Thughtir in Arabic), stretching from Malatiyah on the upper Euphrates to Tarsus near the sea-coast of the Mediterranean, served to mark and guard the frontier; these, turn and turn about, being taken and retaken by Byzantines and Moslems as the tide of war ebbed or flowed. This line of fortresses was commonly divided into two groups—those guarding Mesopotamia (Thughilr- al-Jazirah) to the north-east, and those guarding Syria (Thughlir- ash-Sham) to the south-west. Of the former were Malatiyah, Zibatrah, Hisn Manser, Bahasna, Al-Hadath, which have been already described in the previous chapter, next Mar'ash, Al- Haniniyah, Al-Kanisah and 'Ayn Zarbah. Of the latter group lying near the northern coast-line of the bay of Iskandariyah (Alexandretta), and protecting Syria, were Al-Massisah, Adhanah, and Tarsus. Mar'ash, the Byzantine Marasion, and it is said occupying the site of Germanicia, was rebuilt by the Caliph Mu'awiyah in the 1st (7th) century; under the later Omayyads it was strongly must be made to Professor Ramsay's important papers in the Geographical Journal for September, 1902, p. 257, and October, 1903, p. 357' 1 In the eastern part of the Mediterranean the islands of Cyprus (Kubrus) and Rhodes (Rudis) were both well known to the Arabs, the first having been raided by the Moslems as early as the year 28 (648) under the leadership of Mu'awiyah, afterwards Caliph. No geographical details, however, are given. Baladhuri, 153, 236.

It was re-fortified by Hariin-ar- Rashid with double walls and a ditch. Its inner castle, according to Yakiit, was known as Al-Marwani, being so called after Marwan II, the last Omayyad Caliph. In 490 (1097) Mar'ash was captured by the Crusaders under Godfrey de Bouillon, and subsequently became an important town of Little Armenia (to be described later), remaining for the most part in Christian hands till the fall of that kingdom. The fortress of 'Ayn Zarbah, which the Crusaders knew as Anazarbus, still exists. It was rebuilt and well fortified by Harun-ar-Rashid in 180 (796), and the place is described by Istakhri as lying in a plain where palm-trees grew, the surrounding lands being very fertile, while the city had fine walls and its prosperity in the 4th (10th) century was con siderable. About the middle of this century Sayf-ad-Dawlah the Hamdanid prince spent, it is said, three million dirhams (about ^120,000) on its fortification, but it was taken more than once by the Greeks from the Moslems. Then at the close of the next century the Crusaders captured it and left it a ruin; afterwards it formed part of the dominions of the king of Little Armenia. Abu-l-Fida describes the town as lying at the base of a hill crowned by a strong castle, it being one day's march south of Sis, and south of it, he adds, flowed the Jayhan river. The name 6 Ayn Zarbah had in the 8th (14th) century become corrupted into Nawarza. The exact positions of Al-Haniniyah and Al-Kamsah are unknown, but they lay in the hill country between Mar'ash and 'Ayn Zarbah. Haniniyah, which was one march to the west of Ma^ash and considered as its outlying bulwark, took its name from its founder Hartin-ar-Rashid who built it in 183 (799). The fortress lay in a valley to the west of the Lukkam mountains, a name by which the Moslem geographers roughly indicate the chain of the Anti-Taurus. Ibn Hawkal appears to have visited it, for he says the hamlet was populous and the fort had been strongly built, but had been ruined by the Byzantines. This was in 348 (959), when, according to Yakfit, one thousand five hundred Moslems, men and women, w T ere taken captive. Subsequently Harfimyah was rebuilt by Sayf-ad-Dawlah the Hamdanid, but L e S. 913° RUM OR ASIA MINOR. [CHAP. again the Christians took it, after which it remained a possession of the king of Little Armenia. Kanisah, the full name being Kamsah-as-Sawda, £ the Black Church,' was a very ancient fortress built of black stones, and by the Greeks, says Baladhuri, who adds that Hariin-ar-Rashid had it strongly fortified and well garrisoned. It possessed a Friday Mosque and apparently lay to the south of the Jayhan, for Istakhri describes it as 'at some distance from the sea-shore.' Abu-l-Fida adds that it was only 12 miles from Harilniyah; being in his day included like the latter place in the kingdom of Little Armenia. Another fortress of this neighbourhood was that known to the Arabs under the name of Al-Muthakkab, 'the Pierced'; so called, according to YaMt, ' because it stands among the mountains, all of which are pierced as though with great openings.' Its exact site appears to be unknown, but it stood not far from Al-Kanisah, being at the foot of the Lukkam mountains, near the sea-shore, and in the vicinity of Massisah. The fortress was built by the Omayyad Caliph Hisham; others say by 'Omar II; and a Kuran, written by the hand of 'Omar II, the most pious of the Omayyad Caliphs, was according to Ibn Hawkal preserved here. Further, Baladhun states that when the engineers first came to dig the ditch at Hisn-al-Muthakkab, they found buried in the earth a human leg, but of such monstrous size that it was considered a portent, and it was forthwith despatched to the Caliph Hisham as a unique gift 1 . The three cities of Al-Massisah (Mopsuestia), Adhanah (Adana) and Tarsiis (Tarsus), all of Greek foundation, still exist. Al- Massisah lies on the Nahr Jayhan (the river Pyramus). It was conquered by 'Abd-Allah, son of the Omayyad Caliph 'Abd-al- Malik, in the ist (7th) century, who rebuilt its fortifications and established a strong garrison here. A mosque was erected on the summit of the hill, and the church in the fortress was turned into a granary. A suburb or second town was built shortly afterwards on the other bank of the Jayhan, called Kafarbayya, where the Caliph Omar II founded a second mosque and dug a great cistern. A third quarter, lying to the east of the Jayhan, was built by the 1 1st. 55, 63. I. H. 108, 121. Baladhuri, 166, 171, 188. Mas. i. 26; viii. 295. Yak. i. 927; iii. 761 ; iv. 314, 498, 945. A.

Under the Abbasids the Caliph Manser turned an ancient temple into a Friday Mosque, making it thrice as large as the older mosque of 'Omar II. Harun-ar-Rashid rebuilt Kafar- bayya, and its mosque was further enlarged by Mamun. The two quarters of Kafarbayya and Massisah proper were connected by a stone bridge across the Jayhan; the town bore the title of Al- Ma'mfinyah, 'the Populous,' or 'Well-built,' said to have been bestowed upon it by the Caliph Manser, who restored Massisah after it had been partially destroyed by earthquake in 139 (756). At a later date Massisah, like its neighbours, passed into the possession of the kings of Little Armenia. 1 he adjacent city of Adhanah lay on the Nahr Sayhan (the river Sams), and on the road thither from Massisah was the great bridge which dated from the time of Justinian, but was restored in the year 125 (743) and called Jisr-al-Walid after the Omayyad Caliph Walid. This bridge was again restored in 225 (840) by the Abbasid Caliph Mu'tasim. Adhanah had been in part rebuilt in 141 (758) by Mansiir, and Istakhrt describes it as a very pleasant city, lying to the west of the Sayhan, well fortified and populous. The fortress was on the eastern bank of the river, and was connected with the town by a bridge of a single arch, according to Yakut, and Adhanah itself was defended by a wall with eight gates and a deep ditch beyond it. The rivers Sarus and Pyramus were known to the Moslems respectively as the Nahr Sayhan and the Nahr Jayhan. In early days they were the frontier rivers of the lands of Islam towards the Greek country. As such on the analogy, or in imitation, of the more famous Oxus and Jaxartes of Central Asia, which latter were called the Jayhun and the SayMn by the Arab geographers, as will be more fully explained later, the rivers Pyramus and Sarus were named the Jayhan and Sayhan. Both had their sources in the highlands lying to the north of Little Armenia, and the Jayhan—which Abu-l-Fida compares for size to the Euphrates, adding that in his day the name was commonly pronounced Jahan—after passing Massisah flowed out to the Mediterranean in the Bay of Ayas to the north of the port132 RtjM OR ASIA MINOR. [CHAP. of Al-MaMn (Mallus, later Malo). The Sayhan was of lesser size, and Adhanah was the only important town on its banks. It was however famous for the great bridge, already mentioned, and both the Jayhan and Sayhan, as reported by Mas £ udi, were held to have been of the rivers of Paradise 1 . The most important, however, of all the frontier fortresses was Tarsfts (Tarsus), where a great army of both horse and foot was kept in early times, for Tarsus commanded the southern entrance of the celebrated pass across the Taurus known as the^ilician Gates. Ibn Hawkal states that Tarsus was surrounded By^a double stone wall, and garrisoned by 100,000 horse-soldiers; he adds, 'between this city and the Greek lands rises a high mountain range, an offshoot of the Jabal-al-Lukkam, which stands as a barrier between the two worlds of Islam and Christendom/ Ibn Hawkal explains that the great garrison he saw here in 367 (978) was made up for the most part of volunteers coming from all the provinces of Islam to aid in fighting against the Byzantines, 'and the reason thereof/ he adds, 'is this, that from all the great towns within the borders of Persia and Mesopotamia, and Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and Marocco, there is no city but has in Tarsus a hostelry {Dar) for its townsmen, where the warriors for the Faith {Ghdzi) from each particular country live. And when they have once reached Tarsus they settle there and remain to serve in the garrison; among them prayer and worship are most diligently performed; from all hands funds are sent to them, and they receive alms rich and plentiful, also there is hardly a Sultan who does not send hither some auxiliary troops.' Already under the earlier Abbasid Caliphs, namely Mahdi and Hartln-ar-Rashid, Tarsus had been carefully re-fortified and well ] Baladhuri, 165, 166, 168. 1st. 63, 64. I. H. 122.

In the matter of the ancient mouth of the Sams, it is worth noting that Ibn Serapion folio 44 a) states that in his day, at the beginning of the 4th (10th) century, the Sayhan (Sams) flowed into the Jayhan (Pyramus) five leagues above Massisah, having but one mouth to the sea with the Jayhan. At the present day the Sayhan has its separate mouth to the westward near Marsinah, but the old bed may still be traced.

The Caliph Mamiin, who had died at the neighbouring Badhandiin (Podandos), was buried at Tarsus, on the left-hand side of the great Friday Mosque. Through the city ran the Nahr-al-Baradan (the river Cydnus); the double walls of the town were pierced by six gates, and outside was a deep ditch. Tarsus, Yakdt adds, remained the frontier city of Islam until the year 354 (965), when the Emperor Nikfiir, Nicephorus Phocas, having conquered many of the frontier fortresses, laid siege to Tarsus and took it by capitulation. Among the Moslems, those who could left the city; those who remained were forced to pay the capitation tax. The mosques were all destroyed 'and Nikfur burnt all the Kurans, further he took all the arms away from the arsenals, and Tarslis with all the country round has remained in the hands of the Christians to this day of the year 623 (I2 26). , The ancient Cydnus river, as already said, was generally known as the Nahr-al-Baradan or Barada, and Ibn-al-Fakih states it was also called the river Al-Ghadban. It rose in the hill country to the north of Tarsus in a mountain known as Al-Akra 4 , 'the Bald, ? and flowed into the Mediterranean not far from the later mouth of the Sayhan. To the westward, one march from Tarsus, the frontier in early times was marked by the river Lamos, which the Arabs called the Nahr-al-Lamis, and here the ransoming of Moslem and Christian captives periodically took place. Beyond this was the Greek town of Saliikiyah (Seleucia of Cilicia) which in later times, under the Turks, came to be known as Selefkeh 1 . The line of the Taurus was traversed by many passes, but two more especially were used by the Moslems in their annual raids into the Byzantine country. The first, to the north-east, was the Darb-al-Hadath which led from Mar'ash north to Abulustan, a town in later times known as Al-Bustan (Byzantine Ablastha and the Greek Arabissus), this pass being defended by the great fortress of Hadath (Adata) already noticed in the last chapter.

In Ibn-al-Athir (vi. 340) the name of the Lamos river is incorrectly printed as Nahr-as-Sinn.134 RtlM OR ASIA MINOR. [CHAP. second, and most frequently used pass in early times was that of the Cilician Gates, leading north from Tarsus, and through this went the high road to Constantinople. This road, which was traversed by the post-couriers, and periodically by the embassies passing between the Caesar and the Caliph, in addition to being followed more or less exactly in innumerable raiding expeditions whether of the Moslems or the Christians, is carefully described by Ibn Khurdadbih writing in 250 (864), and his account has been copied by many later writers. It was known in its southern part as the Darb-as-Salamah, 4 the Pass of Safety,' and threaded the Pylae Ciliciae—the celebrated Cilician Gates. The account is as follows. Many of the places of course cannot now be exactly identified, but the names are added where possible in brackets. Ibn Khurdadbih writes:—From Tarsiis it is six miles to Al-'Ullayk and thence 12 to Ar-Rahwah ('the Water-meadow,' pro bably the ancient Mopsukrene) and Al-Jawzat, then seven miles on to Al-Jardakiib, and again seven to Al-Badhandun (Podandos, the modern Bozanti), where is the spring called Rakah near which the Caliph Mamtin died. And then on from Badhandtoi it is 10 miles to the (northern) end of the pass (of the Cilician Gates) at Luluah (Loulon) of Mu'askar-al-Malik, £ the King's Camp,' near the hot springs, and here is As-Safsaf, 'the Willows' (near Faustinopolis), also Hisn-as-Sakalibah, c the Fortress of the Sclavonians.' From the King's Camp (where the Pylae Ciliciae end) it is 12 miles to the Wadi-at-Tarfa, 'the Tamarisk Valley,' thence 20 to Mina, thence 12 to the river of Hiraklah (later Arakliyah, the Greek Heraclia), the town which Hariin-ar-Rashid took by storm. From Hiraklah it is eight miles to the city of Al-Libn, thence 15 to Ras-al-Ghabah, 'the Beginning of the Forest,' thence 16 to Al-Maskanin, thence 12 to 'Ayn Burghiith, 'the Spring of Bugs/ thence 18 to Nahr-al-Ahsa, 'the Underground River,' and thence 18 miles on to the suburb of Kiiniyah (Iconium). From Ktoiyah it is 15 miles to Al-'Alamayn, 'the Double Sign-posts,' thence 20 to Abrumasanah, thence 12 to Wadi-al-Jawz, 'Nut River,' and 12 miles on to 'Ammiiriyah (Amorion). But there is another route also going from Al-'Alamayn, ' the Double Sign-posts' afore said, to 'Ammtlriyah; namely from Al-'Alamayn 15 miles to the villages of Nasr the Cretan, thence 10 to the head of the lake ofIX] RUM OR ASIA MINOR. 135 Al-Basiliyun (lake of the Forty Martyrs), thence 10 to As-Sind, thence 18 to Hisn Sinadah (the fortress of Synades), thence 25 to Maghl, and then 30 miles on to the forest at 'Ammliriyah. From 'Ammtiriyah (Amorion) it is 15 miles to the villages of Al-Harrab, and two on to the river Saghari (the Sangarius) of 'Ammuriyah; thence 12 to Al-'Ilj, 'the Barbarian/ and thence 15 to Falami-al-Ghabah, 'Falami of the Forest/ then 12 to Hisn-al-YahM, 'the Jews' Fortress/ and 18 miles on to Sandabari (Santabaris), 35 miles beyond which lies the Meadow of the King's Asses at Darawliyah (Dorylaeum). From Darawliyah it is 15 miles to the fortress of Ghanibuli, and three on to Kanais- al-Malik, £ the King's Churches ? (the Basilica of Anna Comnena), then 25 miles to At-Tultil, 'the Hills/ and 15 to Al-Akwar, whence in 15 miles you reach Malajinah (Malagina). From here it is five miles to Istabl-al-Malik, ' the King's Stables/ and 30 on to Hisn-al-Ghabra^ £ the Dusty Fortress ' (namely Kibotos, whence the ferry goes over to Aigialos), and thence it is 24 miles on to Al-Khalij, ' the Strait' (which is the Bosporus of Constantinople). And over against (namely south of) the fortress of Al-Ghabra is Nikiyah (Nicaea). This ends the account in Ibn Khurdadbih of the Constantinople road 1 . Off the line of the great high road to Constantinople, the earlier Arab writers had but very incorrect notions of the geography of Asia Minor;—as is shown, for instance, by the confusion which Ibn Hawkal makes between the two very distinct rivers Alis and Saghirah, the Halys and Sangarius. The names of a number of Greek towns appear, in an Arabicized form, in the 1 I. K. 100—102, no, 113. Some other variants of this route are given by Ibn Khurdadbih (pp. 102 and 103), for which the distances have been added by Idrist (Jaubert, ii. 308, 309), and compare especially Ramsay, H. G. A. M, pp. 236 and 445. Professor Ramsay (see Geographical Journal for Oct. 1903, p. 383) has identified the famous fortress of the Sclavonians (Hisn-as-Sakalibah) with the ruins of the Byzantine fortress, built of black marble, and now known as Anasha-Kal'ahsi, which is perched high on the mountain overlooking, from the south, the vale of Bozanti (Badhandun, Podandos). The Byzantine castle of Loulon, which the Arabs called Luluah, * the Pearl/ he has also identified (loc. cit. pp. 401 and 404, where a photograph of the place is given). It lay to the north, above As-Safsaf, 4 the Willows/ which marked the settlement in the valley below, where the Greek town of Faustinopolis had stood.136 RtJM OR ASIA MINOR. [CHAP. earlier chronicles, and these names for the most part recur, but in an altered form after the Turkish conquest; the Arab authors, however, have unfortunately left no descriptions of these towns. Their identity is not disputed, and we have, to name but a few, At-Tawanah (Tyana), Dabasah (Thebasa), Malaktibiyah (Mala- copia), Hiraklah (Heraclia), Ladhik (Laodicea), Kaysariyah (Caesarea Mazaka, of Cappadocia), Antakiyah (Antioch of Pisidia), Kutiyah (Cotyseum), Ankurah (Angora), Afstis (Ephesus), Abides (Abydos) and NikmMiyah (Nicomedia), with some others. Trebizond, written Tarabazandah or Atrabazandah, according to Ibn Hawkal, was the chief port by which goods from Con stantinople, in early Abbasid times, were brought for sale to Moslems. Arab merchants or their agents took the goods thence across the mountains to Malatiyah and other towns on the upper Euphrates. The carrying trade was in the hands of Armenians, according to Ibn Hawkal, but many Moslem merchants, he adds, resided permanently at Trebizond. Greek linen and woollen stuffs are more especially mentioned and Roman brocades, all of which were brought by sea from the Khalij or Bosporus. The fame and importance of Trebizond at this time is also proved by the Black Sea being then commonly known as the Sea of Trebizond (Bahr Tarabazandah). Its official name, however, was the Bahr Buntus or Puntush, the Greek Pontos, which by a clerical error (from the misplacing of the diacritical points of the Arabic character) had from a very early time been incorrectly written and pronounced Nitus or Nitush, under which form the name is still often quoted by Persian and Turkish writers, and the mistake is now become so stereotyped as to be beyond recall 1 . Although so little topographical information is recorded in the Arab writers about the towns of Asia Minor previous to the Saljtik conquest in the latter half of the 5th (nth) century, the Moslems must have had ample practical acquaintance with much of the country; for almost yearly, and often twice a year in spring and autumn, under the Omayyads and the earlier Abbasids, raids 1 I.

Three times, in fact, under the Omayyad Caliphs was Constanti nople besieged by Moslem armies, but the result was in each case disastrous to the assailants, which is hardly to be wondered at, seeing that the Bosporus, measuring in a direct line across the mountainous plateau of Asia Minor, is over 450 miles from Tarsus, the base of the Arab attack. These three famous sieges are : the first in the year 32 (652), under the reign of 'Othman, when Mu'awiyah the future Caliph raided across Asia Minor and attempted to take Constantinople, first by assault, and then by siege, which last he had to raise when news came of the murder of the Caliph 'Othman. The events which followed soon led to the foundation of the Omayyad dynasty. The second siege was in 49 (669), when Mu'awiyah, established as Caliph, sent his son and successor Yazld against the Emperor Constantine IV; but the generals were incapable, the Moslem army suffered a crushing defeat, and Yaztd, succeeding to the Caliphate on his father's death, had to return home. The third and best known attempt against Constantinople was the great siege lasting, off and on, for many years in the reign of the Caliph Sulayman, who sent his brother Maslamah in 96 (715) against Leo the Isaurian. Of this campaign, which again ended in a defeat for the Moslems, we have very full accounts both from the Arab and the Greek chroniclers; and it was in these wars that 'Abd-Allah, surnamed Al-Battal, 'the Champion,' made himself famous, who long after, among the Turks, came to be regarded as their national hero, the invincible warrior of Islam. In spite of frequent defeat and disaster the raids continued, year by year, with a brief interlude while the Abbasids were establishing themselves in power, till more than a century after the date when the latter, having supplanted the Omayyads, be came Caliphs; and though again to besiege Constantinople was beyond their power, they raided, sacked, and burnt again and again throughout Asia Minor. One of the most famous of these expeditions was that of the Caliph Mu'tasim, son of Harun-ar- Rashid, in 223 (838) against 'Ammiiriyah (Amorion), described138 RUM OR ASIA MINOR. [chap. as the most splendid city of the East, 4 the strongest fortress of the Bilad-ar-Rilm and the very eye of the Christians,' which none the less was plundered and burnt to the ground by the Caliph, who returned unmolested, laden with the spoils 1 . The division of Asia Minor into Themes, under the Byzantine Emperors, has been carefully described by Ibn Khurdadbih, and his account is of use in correcting the confused details given by Constantine Porphyrogenitus. This however need not be discussed here, as it belongs of right to the geography of the Byzantine empire. Besides the towns already mentioned the Arab writers, when recounting the Moslem expeditions across the frontier, notice a number of places which, either from the vagueness of the statement or the ambiguity in the name, can now hardly be identified. Thus Marj-al-Uskuf, 'the Bishop's Meadow,' is frequently mentioned, which from one of the itineraries given by Ibn Khurdadbih lay some distance west of Podandos. Al-Matmiirah 2 , or (in the plural) Al-Matamir, f the Cellars,' or Grottos,' also frequently occurs, and must be sought for in the neighbourhood of Malacopia. DhM-Kula/ (the Strong Castle), otherwise spelt Dhu-l-Kila/ (the Castle of the Rocks), was a famous fortress, which Baladhuri states was called £ the Fortress 1 The long list of Moslem raids into Asia Minor, from Arab sources, has been fully worked out and annotated by Mr E. W. Brooks in his papers ( The Arabs in Asia Minor, 641 to 750' (published in the Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xviii, 1898) and 'Byzantines and Arabs in the Time of the early Abbasids, 750 to 813' (published part i. in the English Historical Review for October, 1900, and part ii. in the January number, 1901). The great siege of Constan tinople during the Caliphate of Sulayman he has separately treated of in the Journal of Hellenic Studies (vol. xix, 1899) in a paper on 'The Campaign of 716—718 from Arabic sources.' From the Byzantine side this famous siege has been fully discussed by Professor J. B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, ii. 401. The Moslems called Constantinople Al-Kustantiniyah, but in regard to the Byzantine name, from which the modern Turkish Istambul is said to be derived, it is worth noting that Mas'udi, in the early part of the 4th (10th) century, writes ( Tanhih p. 138) that the Greeks in his day spoke of their capital as Bulin (i.e. Polin—for 7r6Xts, 4 the city'), also as Istan-Bulin (eis ttjv irbXiv), and he notes that they did not generally use the name Constantinople (Al-Kustantiniyah), as did the Arabs. 2 Mazmorra in Sp.

The town of Luluah (the Pearl), as the Arabs, to give the name a meaning, called the Byzantine Loulon, stood as already mentioned at the northern end of the pass of the Cilician Gates. Still further north was Tyana (Tawanah or Tuwanah), which for a time Hartin-ar-Rashid strongly garrisoned and where a mosque was built. The town or fortress called Safsaf, 'the Willows/ was on the Constantinople road near Luluah, probably as already said (p. 134) at the site of Faustinopolis, while immediately to the south of Podandos was the fortress of the Sclavonians (Hisn-as- Sakalibah) already mentioned, where according to Baladhun certain Sclavonians who had deserted from the Byzantines were quartered to guard the pass by Marwan II, the last of the Omayyad Caliphs 1 . After the year 223 (838) the date of the Caliph Mu'tasim's famous expedition against Amorion, the Moslem raids into the Greek country became less frequent, for the recurrent disorders at Baghdad left the Abbasid Caliphs less and less free to think of invading the Byzantine territory. Still, from the middle of the 3rd (9th) century to the 5th (nth) century, many of the great semi-independent vassals of the Caliph led Moslem armies across the passes, and at different times the line of the frontier varied considerably, backwards and forwards, though speaking generally it may be stated that no land was ever permanently held by the Moslems beyond the Taurus. The rise, however, of the Saljiik Turks in the 5th (nth) century, which followed the epoch of the Crusades, entirely changed the face of affairs in Asia Minor. In the spring of the year 463 (1071) Alp Arslan the Saljuk gained the battle of Malasjird (Manzikart), completely routing the Byzantine forces, and taking the Emperor Romanus Diogenes prisoner.

The result of the battle of Malasjird, was that Alp Arslan sent his cousin Sulayman, son of Kutlumish, into Asia Minor; and then the Saljtiks permanently settled down, after their nomadic fashion, in all the high plateau lands forming the ■centre of the province, and the kingdom of Rtim became from henceforth one of the lands of Islam. In their first flush of victory the Saljiiks had raided so far west as Nicsea, which for a short time they held, making it temporarily their capital. From here they were driven back by the first Crusade, and retiring to the central plateau, Iconium or Ktiniyah, which was conquered by them in 477 (1084), became and remained the centre of their government 1 . The line of the Saljiik Sultans of Ktiniyah lasted over two centuries, from 470 (1077) to 700 (1300), but their real power was ended by the Mongol conquest of Ktiniyah in 655 (1257), the year previous to the fall of Baghdad. The establishment of the Saljiiks in the plateau of Asia Minor was coincident with the rise of the Christian kingdom of Little Armenia in the Taurus 1 Ibn-al-Athir, x. 25, 44; xii. 125. J. N. 621. On the battle of Manzikart see History of the Art of IVar by C. Oman, pp. 216—221. The history of the Saljuks in Rum, and their successors the ten Turkoman Amirs, ending in the •establishment of the Ottoman Sultans, is unfortunately the most obscure period in all the Moslem annals. The Persian historians Mirkhwand and Khwand- amir have nothing to add to the bald summary on the Saljuks of Rum given by Mustawfi in his Tdrikh-i- Guzidah, Perhaps the fullest account of the •dynasty is that given by Ibn Khaldun in his Universal History (volume v. pp. 162 175); but this is in fact little more than a list of names and dates. I he Chronicle of Ibn Bibi, lately published by Professor Houtsma, unfortu nately begins only with the reign of Kilij Arslan II, in the year 551 (1156), and regarding the first seventy years of Saljuk rule, when they were conquering and establishing themselves in Asia Minor, we know next to nothing. The battle of Manzikart is the only great victory that is alluded to, all the fighting that resulted in the ejection of the Byzantines from the high lands of Asia Minor passes unrecorded. Also there is no mention of a treaty, which must have been made, formally or informally, between the Byzantines and the -Saljuks after Manzikart. For a summary of all that is known of the Turkoman Amirs who succeeded to the Sultans of Rum see Professor Lane-Poole, 4 The successors of the Saljuks in Asia Minor' in the J. R. A. S. for 1882, p. 773«IX] RUM OR ASIA MINOR. country. Sis, otherwise called Sisiyah, soon after 473 (1080) became the capital of Rupen, the founder of the new dynasty- After a century Leo took the title of king in 594 (1198), and the kings of Little Armenia, weathering the Mongol invasion, only came to an end in 743 (1342). From Sis the kingdom grew to include all the mountainous country watered by the Sayhan and Jayhan rivers, down to the Mediterranean, with the cities of Massi- sah, Adhanah, and Tarsiis, as well as much of the coast-line to the west of Tarstis. Sis, or Sisiyah, the ancient Flaviopolis, under the early Abbasids had been counted an outlying fortress of 'Ayn Zarbah, and its walls were rebuilt by the Caliph Mutawakkil^- grandson of Hartin-ar-Rashid. It was afterwards taken by the Byzantines, and when Abu-l-Fida wrote in 721 (1321) he alludes to it as having been recently rebuilt by Leo II (Ibn Lawtin), surnamed the Great, king of Little Armenia. Its castle,, surrounded by a triple wall, crowned the hill, and the gardens- descended to the river, which was an affluent of the Jayhan. YaMt adds that, in his day. Sis was the commonly used form of the name. To the west and north of this kingdom of Little Armenia stretched the territories of the Saljiik Sultans, and during the first hundred years of their occupation of the plateau lands of Asia Minor this province was three times traversed by the armies of the Crusades. The first Crusade in 490 (1097) resulted in the ex pulsion of Kilij Arslan I (son and successor of Sulayman, the first Sultan of Riim) from Nicaea, and the rabble of the Crusaders passing by Kiiniyah regained the sea at Tarsus, and took ship for Palestine. In the second Crusade Louis VII of France defeated Sultan Mas^d (son of Kilij Arslan) on the banks of the Meander in 542 (1147), but the Franks in their passage onward to the port of Antaliyah suffered great losses in the mountain country. In the third Crusade the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa is said in 586 (1190) to have captured Ktiniyah, the Saljtik capital, from Kilij Arslan II (son of Mas £ tid), but marching onward Barbarossa was accidentally drowned in a river near Salfikiyah (Seleucia of Cilicia), possibly in the Lamos or Nahr-al-Lamis, already mentioned (p. 133), where under the earlier Abbasids Moslem and Christian captives were exchanged or ransomed.142 RCtM OR ASIA MINOR. [CHAR The extent of the country governed by the Saljuk Sultans of Rum varied of course at different times, according to the waning or recovered power of the Byzantine empire, the growth of the Christian kingdom of Little Armenia, and the condition of the neighbouring Moslem principalities, which the Crusaders had in part overcome, and where for a time Frank princes ruled over Moslem subjects. The chief towns of the Saljuk Sultanate in R6m as it existed in 587 (1191) are made known to us by the division of his dominions which Kilij Arslan II made in that year among his eleven sons. Kuniyah (Iconium), as already stated, was the capital, and the second city of the Sultanate was Kaysariyah (Caesarea Mazaka). Malatiyah (Melitene) was the chief town of the eastern province on the Euphrates boundary. To the north Sivas (Sebastia), Nakisar (or Niksar, the older Neo-Csesarea), Tukat and Amasiyah (Amasia) each became the appanage of a Saljuk prince, likewise Anguriyah (Angora) to the north-west, and on the western border Burughlu, probably identical with the modern Ulu Burlfi, lying to the west of the Egridur lake. On the southern frontier, lying eastwards of Kilniyah, the chief towns were Arakliyah (Heraclia), Nakidah or Nigdah, and Abulustan, later called Al-Bustan (Arabissus). Sultan Ala-ad-Din, who succeeded in 616 (1219) and was the grandson of Kilij Arslan II, extended his rule north and south from the shores of the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. He took Sinub (Sinope) on the former, and on the southern coast made a great harbour at Alaya—named after him—where the slips for ship-building and remains of other constructions connected with the great navy of the Saljuks may still be seen : and on the north west he extended his power to the town of San Bfllt. His reign was made famous by the writings of the great SM poet Jalal-ad- Dm Rumi, who lived and died at Kuniyah. Thirty years after the death of Ala-ad-Din, which occurred in 634 (1237), the Mongol armies broke up the power of the Saljuks; the four last Sultans were in fact merely governors under the Il-Khans of Persia, and in the year 700 (1300) the province of Rlim was divided up among the ten Turkoman Amirs, who originally had been the vassals of the Saljuk Sultans 1 . 1 Baladhuri, 170.

Unfortunately his text has come down to us in a most corrupt form.

The Sultan of Mesopotamia. The Amir of Karaman. Kuniyah. The Amir of Tekkeh, ^laya, and Antaliyah. The Amir of Hamid, Egridur. The Amir of Germiyan, Kutahiyah, and Sivri Hisar. The Amir of Mentesha, Milas. The Amir of Aydin, Ephesus, and Smyrna. The Amir of Sarukhan, Magnesia. The Amir of Karasi, Pergamos. The 'Othmanli territory, Brusa. The Amir of Kizil Ahmadli: Sinub. The limits of the ten Turkoman Amirates of the 8th (14th) century very roughly corresponded with the following ancient Greek provinces of Asia Minor. Karaman or Karaman, the largest, was the older Lycaonia; on the Mediterranean coast Tekkeh in cluded Lycia and Pamphylia; inland Hamid corresponded with Pisidia and Isauria ; Kermiyan or Germiyan with Phrygia; and on the coast of the Black Sea Kizil Ahmadli, sometimes called Isfan- diyar, had been Paphlagonia. On the ^Egean shores Mentesha was the older Caria; Aydin and Sariikhan combined were the kingdom of Lydia; Karasi was Mysia; and lastly the 'Othmanli territory (of those Ottomans who ultimately conquered all the other nine provinces) was at first only the small province of Phrygia Epictetus, backed by the high lands of Bythia which the 'Othmanlis had recently conquered from the Byzantines. Of the state of Asia Minor under these Turkoman Amirs we possess an extremely curious account in the travels of Ibn Battoah the Berber, who landing from Syria at 'Alaya, in 733 (1333), visited many of the petty courts on his way to Sinub (Sinope), where he took ship across the Black Sea to the Crimea. Un fortunately, a part of his account appears to be missing. FromCHAP. X] RtJM. 145 'Alaya he journeyed along the sea-shore to Antaliyah, and then struck north across the hills to Egridur in Hamid, on the lake of that name. From here by a devious road through Ladhik (Laodicea ad Lycum) he travelled to Milas in Mentesha, and thence right across Asia Minor diagonally, by Kuniyah and Kaysariyah, to Sivas and Arzan-ar-Rum. Here a lacuna occurs, for the next town mentioned is Birki in Aydin, whence Aya Suluk (Ephesus) was visited. Finally, going north and east, Ibn Batutah takes Brusa and other towns on his road to the Black Sea coast at Sinilb (Sinope). His contemporary Mustawfi, in the chapter of his Geography on Rum, has added some details to the descrip tion of towns given by Ibn Batutah. Mustawfi, however, though writing in 740 (1340) works on earlier sources, and his information gives the state of Rum under the later Saljuks, rather than the country as it existed when the ten Amirs had established their power. At the beginning of the 9th (15th) century the irruption of Timftr into Asia Minor temporarily altered the course of affairs, and threw back the rising Ottoman power for a quarter of a century. The account of his campaigns given by Alt of Yazd again adds something to our knowledge of the country, some further details also being given in the pages of the Turkish Numa, which, though written in the beginning of the 11th (17th) century, when the Ottoman power had long been established in Asia Minor, makes mention of the chief monuments left by the Saljiik Sultans. Before describing the ten provinces, already named, of the Turkoman Amirs, some account must be given of the towns lying to the eastward of the boundary of Karaman, which may be taken as marked by the lower course of the Halys (the Kizil Irmak of the Turks) continued by a line going south to the Jayhan. East of this boundary Asia Minor in the 8th (14th) century belonged to the Il-Khans, the Mongol princes who ruled in Mesopotamia and Persia, and sent hither their governors to keep the peace among the smaller hordes of Turkoman nomads who had settled down in this country after the great Mongol invasion. The chief city east of the Karaman frontier was Kaysariyah (also spelt Kaysariyah, namely Csesarea Mazaka, of Cappadocia), which under L e S. jo146 RUM. [CHAP. the Saljiiks had been the second city of Rtam, and which indeed Kazwmi names as their capital. Here among other shrines might be seen the Friday Mosque dedicated to the hero of Omayyad days, Al-Battal. Mustawfi describes Kaysariyah as surrounded by the stone walls built by Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din the Saljiik; it was a great town with a castle and lay at the base of Mount Arjaish (Argaeus). Mount Arjaish, Mustawfi adds, was an extremely high mountain, its summit never being free from snow, and from it many streams descended. At its foot lay DavaM, a place which will be mentioned below. On the summit of the mountain might be seen a great church. In Kaysariyah stood the famous and greatly venerated shrine of Muhammad ibn Hanafiyah, a son of the Caliph 'Alt, and when Ibn Batlitah visited Kaysariyah (as he writes the name) the city was occupied by a strong garrison in the pay of the Mongol Sultan of 'Irak. In the beginning of the 9th (iSth) century Kaysariyah was the first great city in Asia Minor occupied by the armies of Timtlr. Abulustan (Arabissus) to the east of Kaysariyah, the frontier fortress of Byzantine times, is also mentioned in the conquests of Timilr; and Mustawfi speaks of Abulustan as a medium-sized town. In the Jahdn Numa the modern spelling Al-Bustan (with the signification of i the Garden ') is given. Kirshahr (Byzantine Justinianopolis Mokissus), about 80 miles west of Kaysariyah, was a place of great importance and is frequently mentioned in the account of the campaigns of Timtlr. Mustawfi describes Kirshahr as a large town with fine buildings, and in the Jahdn Numd it is counted as one of the cities of Karaman. Amasiyah or Amasiyah (Amasia) under the Salj^ks had been one of their centres of government; and Mustawfi relates that it had been rebuilt by Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din. Ibn Battitah, who passed through it, de scribes it as a great city with broad streets and fine markets, surrounded by splendid gardens irrigated by means of waterwheels erected along the river. In his day it was under the Sultan of Mesopotamia, and not far distant from it was the town of Sunusa (spelt Sunisa in the Jahdn Numci) with a population of fanatical Shi'ahs. To the north of Amasiyah lies Ladik (Laodicea Pontica), a place of importance under the Saljtiks, and frequently mentioned in the chronicle of Ibn Bibi. The port of SamstlnX] Rt)M. 147 (or Samslin, the Greek Amysos) is described by Mustawfl as a great harbour for ships, and already by the latter part of the 8th (14th) century it was growing rich on the trade diverted to it from the older port of Santib or Sinub (Sinope) 1 . Niksar (or Nakisar, the Greek Neo-Csesarea) had been an important place under the Saljilks, and is frequently mentioned by Ibn Bibi; Mustawfl describes it as a medium-sized town, with many gardens producing much fruit. Tukat (also spelt Dukat) lies to the west of Niksar on the road to Amasiyah, and was one of the great governments under the Saljuks; further west again lies Zilah, mentioned by Ibn Bibi and later authorities. The city of Sivas (Sebastia), on the Kizil Irmak (Halys), had been rebuilt by Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din, who used hewn stone for all the new masonry. Mustawfl reports that the place was famous for its woollen stuffs, which were largely exported; it had a cold climate, but cotton was grown here, as well as much grain. Ibn Batdtah speaks of Sivas as the largest city in the province ruled by the Sultan of Mesopotamia. Here were a Government House, fine streets and excellent markets, and a great Madrasah or college. Mustawfi gives an account of the high road which went west from Sivas to Persia; two stages led to Zarah, a town of some importance, and two more to Ak Shahr (White Town), a place frequently mentioned in the Saljuk chronicle. North-west of Ak Shahr lies Kara Hisar (the Black Fortress) which is often referred to by Ibn Bibi, who calls it Kara Hisar Dawlah—'of the State'—to distinguish this fortress, which is referred to also by Mustawfi, from other places of like name. In the Numa it is called Kara Hisar Shabin, from the alum (Shab) mines that lie near it. From Ak Shahr the high road to Persia went on in three stages to Arzanjan, and thence it was the like distance to Arzan-ar-Rilm. From here the way went south in three stages to Khanus (or Khunas as Ibn Bibi writes the name, Khinis being the modern form), whence it was 10 leagues to Malasjird (Manzikart), this being eight leagues distant from Arjish on the lake of Van 2 . 1 Kaz. ii. 371. i.

The province of Karaman (or Karaman), the largest of the ten Amirates, took its name from the Turkoman tribe which had settled in this region, and the capital was Larandah, also called Karaman after the province. Larandah dated from Byzantine days, and Ibn Batutah who visited it in the 8th (14th) century, and spells the name Al-Larandah, describes it as a fine town standing in the midst of gardens, abundantly supplied with water. At the close of the century it was taken and plundered by the troops of Timiir, but afterwards regained its former prosperity. To the south of Larandah is Armanak, which is spoken of by Mustawfi as having been formerly a large city, though in the 8th (14th) century it had sunk to the condition of a provincial town. It is also mentioned in the Jahan Numa, together with Selefkeh, the older Arabic Saltikiyah (Seleucia of Cilicia). Under the Otto man rule these places were included in the province called Ich 111, which in Turkish signifies 'the Interior Land,' and as this de scription is hardly applicable to the province in question, which lies along the coast, it has been suggested that Ich 111 is in reality only a corruption, truncated, of the older Greek name Cilicia. Ktoiyah (Iconium), as already stated, had been the Saljtik capital, but under the Karaman Amirs it sank to a city of the second rank. Mustawfi relates that the town possessed a great Aywan, or hall, in the palace which had been built by Sultan Kilij Arslan, by whom also the castle had been founded. At a later date 'Ala-ad-Din had built, or restored, the, town walls, making them of cut stone, 30 ells in height, with a ditch 20 ells deep outside. The walls were 10,000 paces in circuit, they were pierced by twelve gates, each having a great castellated gateway. Abundant water was brought down from a neighbour ing hill, to be stored at one of the city gates in a great tank under a dome, whence over 300 conduits distributed it through out the city. The neighbourhood of Ktiniyah was renowned for its gardens, famous for yellow plums, and immense quantities of cotton and corn were grown in the fields around the town. Mustawfi adds that in his day much of Ktiniyah was in ruin, though the suburb immediately below the castle had a large popula tion. In the city was the tomb of the great mystic, the Stifi poet Jalal-ad-Din Riimi, already mentioned, which was an object ofX] RUM. 149 pilgrimage. This shrine is noticed by Ibn Batutah, who praises the fine buildings and abundant water-supply of Kuniyah. He speaks of its gardens and the apricots grown here, called ad-Din (Moon of Faith), which were exported largely to Syria. The streets were broad and the markets abundantly supplied, each trade keeping to its own quarter. Ibn Bibi in his Saljuk chronicle incidentally mentions the names of three of the gates of Kuniyah, namely, the Gate of the Horse Bazar, the Gate of the Assay-house, and the Gate of the Ahmad bridge. The fortress of Kara Hisar of Kuniyah lies at some distance to the east of Kuniyah, and is mentioned by Mustawfi who says that it was built by one Bahram Shah. Beyond this is Hiraklah (Heraclea), a name which in later times appears as Arakliyah, and is frequently mentioned in the Jahan To the north of Kuniyah is Ladik Sukhtah, the Burnt Ladik (Laodicea Combusta, the Greek Katakekaumena), which Ibn Bibi speaks of as the Village of Ladik to distinguish it from the other towns called Laodicea (Pontica and Ad Lycum). The Jahan refers to Laodicea Combusta as Yurgan Ladik, otherwise called Ladhikiyah of Karaman 1 . In the northern part of the Karaman province is Angora (Greek Ancyra), the name of which is spelt by the earlier Arabic authorities Ankurah, and by later Persian and Turkish authors Angfiriyah. Mustawfi speaks of it as a town possessing a cold climate; much corn, cotton, and fruit being grown in the neighbourhood. It is famous in history as the place where in 804 (1402) Timilr defeated in a pitched battle, and took prisoner, the Ottoman Sultan Bayazid Ilderim. Ktash Hisar, or Kuch Hisar, on the eastern border of the great Salt Lake, is mentioned by Mustawfi as a medium-sized town, and its name also occurs in the Jahan Numci. Some distance east of the southern end of the lake stands Ak Saray (the White Palace) built by Sultan KiliJ Arslan II in 566 (1171), and described by Mustawfi as a fine town surrounded by fruitful lands. Ak Sara (as Ibn Batutah spelt the name) stood on three streams, and its gardens were magnificent, also there were many vineyards within the walls. 1 I. B. ii. 281, 284. Mst. 162, 163. A. Y. ii. 458. J. N. 611, 615, 616. Ibn Bibi, 8, 9, 287, 324.RtjM. [CHAP. The townspeople in the 8th (14th) century made excellent carpets from the wool of their sheep, and these carpets were largely exported to Syria, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. Ibn Batutah adds that in his day Ak Sara was in the government of the Sultan of Mesopotamia. Some fifty miles east of Ak Sara is Malankubiyah (Malacopia), which is mentioned by Mustawfi as a place of importance in the 8th (14th) century. To the north of this is another Kara Hisar, described by Mustawfi as of the Nigdah district, and east of this again is Davalu (in the Jahan Numa the name is written Davahlu), a place already spoken of as at the foot of Mount Arjaish. It occurs more than once in the history of Ibn Bibi in connection with Kaysariyah. Mustawfi describes DavaM as a town of medium size, and its walls had been rebuilt by Sultan 'Ala-ad-Dln the Saljuk. South of Malankubiyah is Nigdah (in Ibn Bibi written Nakidah) which had taken the place of the earlier Tuwanah (Tyanah), having been built by Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din. Nigdah is described by Mustawfi as a medium-sized town, and Ibn Batutah, who passed through it, notes that the greater part was already in ruin. It lay, he adds, in the territories of the Sultan of Mesopo tamia ;its stream was called the Nahr-al-Aswad, ' the Black River,' and was crossed by three stone bridges. The gardens of Nigdah were most fruitful; and waterwheels were employed for their irrigation. To the south of Nigdah was Luluah (Loulon), frequently mentioned by Ibn Bibi, a great fortress which, as already said, marked the northern end of the pass of the Cilician Gates. In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi describes Luluah as a small town, surrounded by excellent pasture lands. It had a cold climate, and in the neighbourhood there were famous hunting grounds 1 . In the territories of the Amir of Tekkeh the most important towns appear to have been c Alaya and Antaliyah, famed for their harbours. The first, as already mentioned, had been founded by the Saljuk Sultan £ Ala-ad-Din on the site of the ruins of Coracesium. Ibn Batutah landed here from Syria in 733 (1333), and describes 'Alaya as at that time the great port for the trade with Alexandria. 1 Ibn Bibi, 5, 34, 44, 279, 314. I. B. ii. 285, 286. Mst. 162, 163, 164, 202. Yak. iv. 635. A. Y. ii. 429. J. N. 617, 620.X] RUM. In the upper town, very strongly built by 'Ala-ad-Din, was the castle, which Ibn Batlitah carefully examined; but in his day 'Alaya appears to have belonged to the Sultan of Karaman. Antaliyah, the second harbour, lying a hundred miles to the westward of 'Alaya, at the head of the bay, was famous as the usual place of re-embarkation of the Crusaders for Palestine. It was a fine town, and was known to Yaktit as the chief port of Rtim, being strongly fortified and surrounded by fruitful lands, with many vineyards. Here Sultan Kilij Arslan the Saljtik had built himself a palace on the hill overlooking the sea, and here, too, Ibn, Battitah found many Christian merchants settled, especially down at the Mina or port, their quarter being shut off by a wall, and each trade, he adds, had its own street in the markets. There was a Jews' quarter also, and the Moslems lived in their own part of the city, where stood the mosque and Madrasah (college). Antaliyah, the name of which occurs in the Crusading chronicles as Satalia or Attaleia, is frequently mentioned in the campaigns of Timiir under the form 'Adaliyah. To the west of it, also mentioned by 'All of Yazd, is Istanlis, a town whose name in the Jahan Numa is written Istanaz 1 . To the north of Tekkeh the Amir of Hamid owned the country round the four lakes of Egridlir, Burdiir, Beg Shahr, and Ak Shahr. Under the Saljtiks, according to Ibn Bibi, the seat of government had been at Burughlti, apparently identical with the later Ulti Burlu (to the west of the Egridiir lake), the Byzantine Sozopolis or Apollonia. Antakiyah (Antioch of Pisidia), which in the earlier Moslem chronicles is frequently referred to, in Turkish times took the name of Yalavach, and was situate in the plain between the lakes of Egridiir and Ak Shahr. The chief town of the province, according to Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century, appears to have been the city of Egridiir (the ancient Prostanna) at the southern end of the lake of that name. Ibn Batiitah describes it as a great place, well built, with fine markets, sur rounded by abundantly watered gardens; and the lake (he adds) was traversed by the boats of the merchants, who thus transported 1 In the New Testament Attalia is mentioned in Acts xiv. 25.

[CHAP. their goods to neighbouring places, and traded with the towns on the shores of the Ak Shahr and Beg Shahr lakes. The town of Beg Shahr (or Bey Shahr, Karallia of the Byzan tines) at the foot of its lake, according to the Jahdn Numct, had been founded by Sultan ^la-ad-Din the Saljiik. It had a stone wall with two gates, a Friday Mosque, and fine baths ; also a market at a place called Alarghah. To the west of Egridur lies Burdiir, on the lake of the same name, a small town, according to Ibn Batiitah, with many streams and gardens, protected by a castle on the neighbour ing hill. Ispartah, south of Egridtir, is given in the Jahan Numa as the capital of Hamid in later times. Ibn Batfoah writes the name Sabarta, and describes it as a well-built city of many gardens, protected by a castle. This represents the Byzantine town of Baris, and Sparta is the common pronunciation of the present day 1 . The lake of Ak Shahr is that which Ibn Khurdadbih (see above, p. 135) calls Basiliyun, and which the Byzantines knew as the Lake of the Forty Martyrs. To the west of it is the great castle of Kara Hisar, which in connection with Ak Shahr is frequently mentioned in the campaigns of Timtjr. At Ak Shahr, according to 4 All of Yazd, the unfortunate Sultan of the ^Othmanlis, Bayazid Ilderim, whom Timilr had defeated at Angora, died broken-heated in 805 (1403), and both this Ak Shahr and this Kara Hisar are mentioned by Mustawfi among the many celebrated places of those names. This Kara Hisar, now surnamed Afytin from the quantity of opium grown round it, marks the site of the Greek town of Prymnessos or Akroenos, and local tradition asserts that Al-Battal, the champion of the earlier Omayyad wars against the Byzantines, was killed in battle near here. Tabari, however, our earliest authority, only says that in the year 122 (740) ^bd- Allah-al-Battal was slain in the Greek country, and no indication of the place is given 2 . 1 Sabarta or Ispartah is the corruption of the Greek ets Bapcda : cf. footnote, p. 157, on Izmid and Iznik (Nicomedia and Nicaea). 2 Ibn Bibi, 5, 212, 251, 283.

The tomb of Al-Battal is given in the yakdn Numd (p. 642) as existing in the nth (17th) century at Sidi Ghazi, more than fifty miles north of Kara Hisar to the east of Kutahiyah. At the present day it is shown at Kirshahr.

The Arab chroniclers wrote the name, as already mentioned, Kutiyah; but the Byzantine town must early have fallen to ruin, and according to the Jahan Numa it was the Sultan of Germiyan to whom the later medieval town of Kutahiyah owed its foundation. Ibn Batiitah refers to it as inhabited by robbers. At the close of the 8th (14th) century the place is frequently mentioned in the campaigns of Timfir, he for a time having made it his head-quarters. A hundred miles east of Ktitahiyah, near the upper affluents of the Sangarius, stands the great fortress of Sivri Hisar, where Timiir also for a time had his head-quarters. The name in Turkish means 'the Pointed Castle' (Kazwmi spells it Sibri Hisar), and it stands above the site of the Roman Pessinus, which afterwards was renamed Justinianopolis Palia. Kazwmi reports that in the 7 th (13th) century there was a famous church here called Bay^t Kamnantis, and if animals suffering from stricture were seven times led round this church, the stricture would yield and they then recovered their health. South of Sivri Hisar lies c Amm6riyah (Amorion, at the modern Assar Kal c ah), already spoken of (p. 137), which Mustawfi refers to as if in the 8th (14th) century it were still a place of importance. For some unexplained reason the common people, he adds, called it Angiiriyah or Angtirah (Angora), and this strange misnomer is repeated in the Jahan Numa, only that according to the latter authority it was Angtiriyah, Angora, that was commonly called 'Ammtiriyah. In the south-eastern part of Germiyan is Ladhik (Laodicea ad Lycum), which the Turks called Denizlii, £ Many Waters,' from its abundant streams; the place is now known as Eski Hisar (Old Fort)^ Ibn Batiitah describes it at all times a tendency in the earlier Arab chronicles to confound this with other places of the same name, and especially with Antioch of Syria. Ya'kubi in his History (i. 177) refers to Antakiyah-al-Muhtarikah, 4 Burnt Antioch,' by which apparently the town of Pisidia is meant. The same author (ii. 285) speaks further of a raid made in the year 49 (669), and then mentions ' Black Antioch' (Antakiyah-as-Sawda), by which name possibly Antioch of Isauria is intended.154 RUM. [CHAP. as a great city, with seven mosques for the Friday prayers, and excellent markets. The Greek women of Ladhik wove cotton stuffs, which they afterwards embroidered finely with gold, and these embroideries were famous for their wear. In the Jahan Numa the older form of the name is given as Ladhikiyah 1 . In the province governed by the Mentesha Amir, Ibn Batutah visited the three neighbouring cities of Mughlah, Milas, and Barjm. The Amir lived at Mughlah (the older Mobolla), the capital, according to the Jahdn Numa, which Ibn Battitah describes as a fine town. Milas (Mylasa, or Melisos) was also a great city with gardens, much fruit, and plentiful streams. Barjin (Bargylia, now known as Assarlik), a few miles from Milas, was a newly built town, standing on a hill-top, with a fine mosque and good houses. In the eastern part of Mentesha, Ibn Battitah visited Kul Hisar, which under the name of Gul is described by Mustawfi as a medium-sized town, and it is also spoken of in the campaigns of Timur. Ibn Battitah describes it as surrounded on all sides by the waters of the little lake on which it stood, this being almost entirely overgrown with reeds. A single road by a causeway led to the town across the lake, and the castle, which was very strong, crowned a hill rising immediately above the town. In the north of Mentesha was the castle of Hisn Tawas, at the present time called Daonas, a day and a half distant from Ladhik (Laodicea ad Lycum). Ibn BatMah describes Tawas as a great fortress with a walled town below it. Tradition stated that Suhayb, a celebrated Companion of the prophet Muhammad, had been born here 2 . North of Mentesha was the territory of the Amir of Ay din, of which Tirah (Teira) was the capital. Ibn Batfttah, who visited the Amir of Aydin here, says it was a fine city with many gardens and abundant streams. He also passed through Birki (Pyrgion), one march north of Tirah, of which he praises the magnificent trees. The city of Aydin or Guzel Hisar occupies the site of the Byzantine Tralleis, and was a town of secondary importance. Ephesus, on the coast, was well known to the earlier Arab 1 Kaz. ii. 359. I.

In later times the town came to be known as AyasuKik (also written AyathuKikh or Ayasaligh), a corruption of the Greek Agiou Theologou, and so called from the great church to Saint John Theologos, built here by the Emperor Justinian. This church was visited by Ibn Batiitah when he was here in 733 (1333). He describes it as constructed of great stones, each ten ells in length, carefully hewn. Another church had, on the Moslem conquest, become the Friday Mosque, and this was a most beautiful building, the walls being faced with divers coloured marbles, while the pavement was of white marble, and the roof, which was formed of eleven domes, was covered with lead. Ibn Batlitah states that Ayasultik in his day had fifteen gates, a river (the Cayster) flowed past it to the sea, and the city was surrounded by jasmine gardens and vineyards. The other great port of Aydin was Smyrna, called by the Turks Azmir or Yazmir, which was taken by Timiir from the Knights Hospitallers in the beginning of the 9th (15th) century. Ibn Battitah, who was here in 733 (1333), describes it as then for the most part in ruin; there was a great castle on the hill hard by, and from this port, he adds, the Amir of Aydin was wont to send out ships to harass the Byzantines, and plunder the neighbouring Christian towns. Of these last was Ftijah (or Flichah, Phocia) on the coast of the province of Sarftkhan, mentioned later on in the time of Timiir as a Moslem castle, but which Ibn Battitah writes of in his travels as then in the hands c of the infidels,' namely the Genoese. The capital of Sarukhan was Maghmsiyah (or Maghmsiya, Magnesia) which he speaks of as a fine city standing on the hill-side, surrounded by many gardens with abundant streams, and here the Amir of Sariikhan held his court. In the campaigns of Timiir the province round Maghni Siyah (as the name was then written) is called Saruhan-Ili 1 . North of Sartikhan was the territory of the Karasi (or 1 I.

Karah-Si) Amir, whose capitals were Balikesri and Barghamah (Pergamos). Ibn Batutah, who visited Pergamos in 733 (1333), describes it as a city for the most part in ruin, but defended by a huge castle perched on a hill-top near by. Balikesri, which he also visited, was a well-built and populous town with excellent markets. There was, however, no Friday Mosque here at this date, though the Sultan of Karasi, Dumilr (or Timfo) Khan, generally lived here, and his father had built Balikesri. At a later period the town is frequently mentioned in the campaigns of Timiir. From Balikesri Ibn Battitah travelled on to Brusa, at that time the capital of the 'Othmanli state, which already had begun to overshadow and absorb all the other Turkoman Amirates. Brusa or Bnisah (Prusa) was already a great city, w T ith fine markets and broad streets. The town was surrounded by extensive gardens, and within the city was a great tank where the water was collected for distribution to all the houses. At Brusa there was a hospital, with one ward for men and another for women, where the sick were attended to and supplied gratis with all necessities, and there was also a hot bath. The ^thmanli Sultan whom Ibn Battatah visited was Orkhan (grandfather of that Bayazid Ilderim, already mentioned as defeated at the beginning of the following century by Timtir), and the chief monument of his capital was the tomb of Sultan 'Othman, his father, who was buried in what had formerly been a church. Mikhalij (Miletopolis, which the Byzantines called Michaelitze), lying about 50 miles west of Brusa, is frequently mentioned in the campaigns of Timtir, and in the Jahctn Numa. The most important town of the Ottoman territory in 733 (1333), how ever, was Nicaea, which had been taken from the Byzantines by Sultan Orkhan. Nicaea, which the earlier Arab geographers called Nikiyah, the Turks knew as Yaznik or Iznik. Ibn Batiitah describes the lake of Yaznik as covered with reeds. At the eastern end of it the town stood, and was entered by a single causeway across the waters, so narrow that only one horseman at a time could approach. The town itself he describes as much in ruin, but its circuit enclosed many gardens; it was surrounded by four separate walls with a water ditch dug betweenX] RUM. 157 every two, traversed by drawbridges. To the north of Nicaea lies Nicomedia, which the earlier Arab authorities knew as Nikmudiyah; the Turks called it Iznekmid, as the Jahan Num.a writes the name, shortened later to Izmid, which is that now in use. No description of this town is given by Ibn Batutah or our other authorities 1 . The province of Kizil Ahmadli lay along the coast of the Black Sea from the neighbourhood of the Bosporus to Sinope. Travelling from Yaznik, after passing the river Sangarius, which the Turks called Sakari, the first large town which Ibn Batutah came to was Muturni or Mudurm (modern MudurKi, and the ancient Modrene) which he speaks of as a place of considerable size; it is also mentioned in the Numa. The town of Bull (Claudiopolis), to the north-east of Muturni, Ibn Battitah describes as standing on a river of some volume; and Kereh- deh (or Geredi) Biili, one march to the east of this, was a fine large city in a plain, with good markets and broad streets, each separate nation among its people having a distinct quarter. Geredi Bull in 733 (1333) was the residence of the Amir, and appears to have been then the chief town of Kizil Ahmadli. In the eastern part of the province stands Kastaniuniyah (or Kastamvtni, for Castamon) which Mustawfi describes as a medium- sized town. Ibn Batutah speaks of it as one of the largest cities which he visited in Asia Minor, and provisions, he notes, were here both cheap and abundant. To the .north-east of it lay the great port of Sanub (or Sinub, Sinope), where he took ship for the Crimea, and from his description we learn how Sinope was surrounded on three sides by the sea, the town being entered by a single gate to the east. It was a beautiful and populous harbour and strongly defended. A fine Friday Mosque was to be seen here, the dome supported on marble pillars ; and a place of 1 Iznekmid is a corruption of the Byzantine et's Nf/co^Seta^: Iznik of ets Nt'/ccuaf. I.

The picture Ibn Batutah gives of Sultan Orkhan, the founder of the celebrated corps of the Janizaries, is very curious. Ibn Batutah states that this chief was already the most powerful of all the Turkoman Amirs. He possessed a hundred castles, and never stayed a month in any one town, being always out campaigning and inspecting his frontiers.158 RUM. [CHAP. X popular veneration was the reputed tomb of Bilal the Abyssinian, the Companion of the prophet Muhammad, and his Muezzin who had been the first to call the Moslems to prayer. The Byzantine city of Gangra Germanicopolis, which lies some 50 miles south of Kastamuni, the Turks called Kankn. In the earlier Arab chronicles the name is given as Khanjarah, and a great raid was made by the Moslems in the reign of the Omayyad Caliph Hisham as far into the Greek lands as this town. Kazwini, who spells the name Ghanjarah, says that it stood on a river called the Nahr Maklub, 'the stream which was turned over,'—because unlike other rivers it ran from south to north. He adds that in 442 (1050) Ghanjarah was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake. Finally, to complete the list of towns in the Kizil Ahmadli province, Kuch Hisar, which is named in the Jahan Numa must be mentioned. It lies about midway between Kastamfini and Kankri, and possibly is the Kfish Hisar of Mustawfi already noticed (p. 149), and there identified with the city of the same name on the great Salt Lake 1 , In regard to the high roads traversing Asia Minor, except for the road from Tarsus to Constantinople (given p. 134), and the road east from Sivas towards Tabriz (given p. 147), no itineraries that are of any use are forthcoming. In the Numa 2 a certain number of roads are mentioned that radiated from Sivas as a centre, and along these the names of various villages and post-stations are set down, many of which may still be found on the map. Unfortunately the distances are in most cases omitted, and hence the amount of information to be derived from these routes is not of much account. 1 Mst. 163, 164. I.

The mountainous province of Adharbayjan—the name of which is pronounced Azarbijan 1 in modern Persian—was of much less importance under the Caliphate than it became in the later middle- ages after the Mongol invasion. In the earlier period it lay off the line of traffic, which passed by the Khurasan road through the Jibal province (Media); and the remoteness of Adharbayjan was also increased, according to Mukaddasi, by the fact that over seventy languages or dialects were spoken among its mountains and high plains, while none of the cities were of any very con siderable size. In successive epochs different towns rose one after another to the position of the provincial capital. At first, with the earlier Abbasids, it was Ardabil; then, under the later Caliphs, Tabriz took the first position, but after the Mongol invasion for a time gave place to Maraghah. Tabriz, however, soon regained its pre-eminence under the Il-Khans, but again under the first 1 See Map in. p. 87. The older form of the name in Persian was Adhar- badhagan, a name which the Greeks corrupted to Atropatene. Mukaddasi (p. 373) describes Adharbayjan, Arran and Armenia as forming part of a single great province, which he designates as the Iklim-ar-Rihab, ' the region of the high plains'—in distinction to the mountains (Jibal) of Media, and the lowlands (Akur) of Mesopotamia.i6o adharbAyjan. [chap. Safavid kings was eclipsed by Ardabil. At a later date, in the nth (17th) century, when Isfahan was made the capital of all Persia by Shah 'Abbas and Ardabil fell to decay, Tabriz was reinstated once more in the position of chief city of Adharbayjan, and so remains to the present day, being now by far the most important town in the north-western part of Persia. The most remarkable natural feature of the province is the Lake of Urmiyah, the largest permanent sheet of water in Persia, being over 80 miles long from north to south and a third of this across in its broadest part. It lies to the west of Tabriz, and takes its name from the town of Urmiyah which lies on its western shore. Our authorities give the lake a variety of names. In the Zend Avesta it is called Chaechasta, and this, the old Persian form, is retained in Chichast, the name by which the lake is referred to in the Shah Namah, and which was still in use as late as the times of Mustawfi. Mas £ iidi and Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (loth) century call it the Buhayrah Kabudhan, a name derived from the Armenian and meaning ' the Blue Lake' (gadoid being c blue ? in that language). Istakhri calls it the lake of Urmiyah (being followed in this by Mukaddasi), otherwise the Buhayrah- ash-Shurat, 4 the Lake of the Schismatics,' from the heterodox beliefs of the various peoples inhabiting its shores, and he describes its waters as very salt. It was, he adds, in those days covered with boats trafficking between Urmiyah and Maraghah, and on its shores were many most fertile districts. In the middle of the lake was an island, called the Kabtldhan island by Ibn Serapion, with a small town, inhabited by boatmen. Its waters were full of fish according to Istakhri (Ibn Hawkal, on the contrary, says there were none), and there was a curious fish found here known as the Water-dog (Kalb-al-Ma)] in winter time storms raised great waves, and the navigation was very dangerous. By Abu-l-Fida the lake is referred to as the Buhayrah Tila—but the latter name is of unknown signification; Kazw T ini speaks of the salt and the Tiitiya (tutty of zinc) which were produced here and largely exported. Mustawfi who, as already said, more generally writes of it as the Chichast lake, also calls it the Darya-i- Shur, c the Salt Lake,' or else refers to it as the lake of Tarilj or Tasiij, from the name of an important town on its northern shore.XI] adharbAyjAn. 161 He and Hafiz Abru both refer to the island (a peninsula, when the waters are low) of Shaha, where there was a great castle crowning a hill, the burial-place of HCilagfi and other of the Mongol princes. The fortress of Shaha is mentioned in the 3rd (9th) century, for Ibn Mashkuwayh when relating the events of the Caliphate of Mutawakkil, grandson of Harun-ar-Rashid, speaks of Shaha and Yakdur, two castles then held by rebel chieftains of these parts. In the 7 th (13th) century HCilagu rebuilt the castle of Shaha—which Hafiz Abrtl calls the Kal'ah-i- Tila of the Urmiyah lake—and stored here all his treasures, the plunder of Baghdad and the provinces of the Caliphate. This castle subsequently becoming his burial-place it was known in Persian as Gur Kal'ah, 'the Castle of the Tomb,' and when Hafiz Abrll wrote in the time of Tmuir it was entirely uninhabited 1 . The city of Tabriz lies some thirty miles east from the lake shore on a river which debouches near the Shaha island or peninsula. Tabriz appears to have been a mere village till the 3rd (9th) century, when in the reign of Mutawakkil a certain Ibn-ar-Rawad settled here, he and his brother and son building themselves palaces and afterwards enclosing with a wall the town which gathered round these. A late tradition indeed refers the foundation of Tabriz to Zubaydah, the wife of Hariin-ar-Rashid, but the earlier chronicles give no support to this statement, moreover it is nowhere recorded that this princess ever visited Adharbayjan. Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century describes Tabriz as a fine town, with a Friday Mosque, well watered by numerous streams, and surrounded by fruitful orchards. Yak6t who was here in 610 (1213) speaks of it as at that time the chief town of Adharbayjan, Kazwim adding that it was famous for its 'Attabi (or tabby) silks, its velvets and woven stuffs.

[CHAP. who captured Tabriz in 618 (1221) were promptly bought off, and the city thus escaped the usual sack; and, as already said, under the subsequent Il-Khan dynasty it became the largest town of these parts. Mustawfi gives a long account of Tabriz. Twice, he says, it had been destroyed by earthquakes and rebuilt, namely in 244 (858), and in 434 (1043) when 40,000 of its inhabitants perished. After being finally restored it was surrounded by a wall 6000 paces in circuit, with ten gates, and continued thus till the 8th (14th) century, when Ghazan Khan began to build great suburbs beyond the older wall, surrounding these in turn by a new wall. This, which was pierced by six gates, included the hill of Valiyan in its circuit, and measured 25,000 paces round. Mustawfi gives the names of the inner and outer gates of Tabriz (the mss. vary considerably in these), and he states that Ghazan Khan was buried in 703 (1303) in the great suburb of Sham, which he had laid out. His successors added many fine mosques and erected public buildings within the city and in the suburb of Rashidi, which occupied the slopes of the hill of Valiyan. The orchards of Tabriz were watered by the river Mihran RM, which rose in Mount Sahand lying to the south of the city. Round Tabriz lay seven districts, called for the most part after their respective streams. These names, with the villages adjacent, are given in detail by Mustawfi, but the readings of the many proper names are very uncertain. Ibn Batfttah, who visited Tabriz in the year 730 (1330), speaks of the Sham quarter lying outside the town, with its fine college built by Ghazan Khan and the oratory. He entered the city by the Baghdad gate, and notes the market of Ghazan, and the jewellers 7 market where an abundance of precious stones was offered for sale. Near by was the musk and ambergris market. The Friday Mosque, he says, had been built by the Wazir 'Ali Shah of Gilan; its court was paved with marble, and to the tank a channel brought water. The walls were faced with enamelled tile-work (Kashani-ware), and to right and left of the mosque stood, on the one side an oratory, and on the other a college 1 . The two rivers, called respectively the Mihran RM, which ran 1 Muk. 378. Yak. i. 822. Kaz. ii. 227. Mst. 153—155. J. N. 380. I.

The Sarav Rud, which was also called the Sarkhab river, rose in the mountains of Sablan Kuh, which lay 200 miles to the eastward of Tabriz, over hanging Ardabil. After a long and winding course, passing through successive salt marshes and receiving many affluents, the Sarav river flowed out into the Urmiyah lake at a point about 40 miles to the westward of the city of Tabriz. The two mountains of Sahand and Sablan, and the rivers that flowed down from them, are described in much detail by Mustawfi. The town of Sarav or Sarab, which gave its name to the river, lies on the road from Tabriz to Ardabil, and according to Mustawfi was surrounded by the four districts of Warzand, Darand, Baraghtish, and Sakhir. The earlier Arab geographers spell the name of the town Sarat (for Sarab), and Ibn Hawkal describes it as a fine place with many mills, surrounded by fields and orchards where much corn and fruit was grown. In Sarat were found numerous hostelries and excellent markets. Yaktit, who spells the name Sarav or Sarv, speaks of it as having been ruined by the Mongol invasion of the year 617 (1220), when most of its inhabitants were slaughtered. It had however recovered when Mustawfi wrote a century later; he adds that it lay three days' march from Tabriz and two from Ardabil. On a left (south) bank affluent of the Sarav river stood the a. # town of Awjan or Ujan, which was ten leagues from Tabriz on the road to Miyanah. Yaktlt who had been here in the 7 th (13th) century describes Ujan as a walled town with an excellent market. It had, however, been ruined by the Mongols, and in Mustawfi's day was rebuilt by Ghazan Khan, who at one time had resided here. He renamed it Shahr-i-Islam, c the City of Islam,' and enclosed it with a wall 3000 paces in circuit built of mortared stones. The surrounding districts were very fertile, growing cotton, corn, and much fruit. Its river, called the Ab -i-Ujan, rose in an eastern spur of Mount Sahand. To the south-west of this mountain, and about 60 miles from Tabriz, being four leagues from the shore of the lake, was the great164 ADHARBAYJAN. [CHAP. village of Dakharrakan, as Ibn Hawkal and the Arab geographers spell the name, which the Persians write Dih Khuwarkan. YaMt gives Dih Nakhirjan as an alternative reading, explaining this as meaning the village (Di/i) of Nakhirjan, treasurer of Chosroes, king of Persia. Mustawfi describes it as a small town, surrounded by dependencies and eight villages, where much fruit and corn was grown 1 . The city of Maraghah stood about 70 miles south of Tabriz, on the river Safi, which flowed south down to it from Mount Sahand, and then turned west to reach the lake. Maraghah, an abbreviation for Kariyat-al-Maraghah, ' the Village of the Pastures,' is said to have been called Afrazah Rtrdh by the Persians. In the 4th (10th) century Maraghah is described by Ibn Hawkal as a town of the size of Ardabil, at that time the chief city of Adharbayjan; he adds further that Maraghah had already even then been for a time the provincial capital, where the government treasury and offices were stationed, before they were permanently transferred to Ardabil. Maraghah was a most pleasant town, surrounded by a wall beyond which lay fruitful orchards. It was famous for a particular kind of perfumed melon grown here, green outside and red within, w T hich tasted of honey. Mukaddasi speaks of its castle and fortifications, with a great suburb lying outside these. YaMt records that its fortifica tions were built under Hartin-ar-Rashid and restored by the Caliph Mamiin. Under the earlier Mongols, as we have already seen, Maraghah became the capital of Adharbayjan, and Mustawfi describes it as a great city surrounded by numerous and fertile districts, some of which he names, amply w T atered by many streams. Outside Maraghah stood the great observatory built by the astronomer Nasir-ad-Din of Ttis, where by order of Htilagti the celebrated Il-Khani tables had been calculated and published. The ob servatory, of which the ruins still exist, was however already dilapidated when Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (14th) century. Kazwini mentions the castle, called Ruwin Diz, which lay three leagues distant from Maraghah, having a stream flowing on either 1 1st. 190. I. H. 248, 253. Yak. i. 131, 198; ii. 425, 636; iii. 64.

A league from here stood the village of Janbadhak, with a hot spring, of which many wonders were related. The Safi river, which flowed into the lake to the west of Maraghah, mingled its waters in flood-time with those of the Jaghtu river and its affluent the Taghtu, both of which as de scribed by Mustawfi rose in the Kurdistan mountains; and the whole of the southern shore of the lake at their outflow was a great swamp. Here surrounded by tortuous streams stood the small town of Laylan (or Naylan), among fruitful orchards, and inhabited in the time of Mustawfi by Mongols. Some way to the south of Laylan, according to the distances given in the Itineraries, was the village of Barzah, where the road coming up from Sisar (in the Jibal province) bifurcated. To the right one way went on north-east to Maraghah; while to the left, and by the west of the lake, lay the way to Urmiyah. Fifty miles from the southern shore of the lake was Baswa, by the Persians pronounced Pasawa, which YaMt had visited, and he states that in his day the inhabitants were mostly robbers. Mustawfi praises its fruitful orchards, and to the north-west of it lay the town of Ushnuh, which in the time of Ibn Hawkal was inhabited by Kurds. In the 4th (10th) century Ushnuh did a great trade in horses and cattle with the neighbouring towns of Mesopotamia, especially Mosul: its lands were very fertile and its sheep pastures were famous. YaMt, who had visited it, speaks of its fine gardens, and Mustawfi, who spells the name Ushnuyah, describes it as a medium-sized town of the mountain region which he calls Dih Kiyahan 1 . The city of Urmiyah, which gave its name to the lake, lay at a short distance from its western shore. Tradition pro claimed Urmiyah to have been the birth-place of Zardtisht or Zoroaster. The town, according to Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century, was of the same size as Maraghah, being a pleasant place and surrounded by vineyards ; its markets were well supplied with merchandise, among the rest being the clothiers' market, 1 1st. 181.

Urmiyah was fortified and defended by a castle, and a stream flowed through it down to the lake, which was about a league distant. In the 8th (14th) century it had grown to be a large place, its wall measuring 10,000 paces in circuit, and a score of villages were of its dependencies. On the high road north of Urmiyah, and at some distance back from the north-western corner of the lake, is Salmas. Mukaddasi describes this as a fine town with good markets and a Friday Mosque built of stone; the population of the place in the 4th (10th) century was of Kurd origin. Yakut says that in the 7th (13th) century Salmas lay for the most part in ruin; but the Wazir c Ali Shah, Mustawfi writes, rebuilt its walls 8000 paces in circuit during the following century, in the reign of Ghazan Khan, the Mongol, and the town had then regained its former importance. Its climate was cold, and a river which rose in the mountains to the west passed through it to the lake. On the northern shore of the lake was the town called Tartij or Tasfrj, which is apparently identical with the modern Tursah. Mustawfi, as already said, often speaks of the Salt Lake of Tasiij or Tartij, and the town therefore shared with Urmiyah the honour of giving its name to this sheet of water. In the 8th (14th) century Tasiij must have been an important place, it was warmer than Tabriz and damper, being so near the lake, and it was surrounded by gardens and orchards. To the north-east of Salmas lies Khawi, pronounced Khoi, on a stream that flows north to the river Aras (Araxes). Khawi was a strongly fortified and flourishing town according to YaMt and Kazwini, surrounded by fertile lands and famous for its excellent brocades. There was also a spring here which had the reputation of being hot in winter and cold in summer. Mustawfi says that the enceinte of its town walls measured 6500 paces, and that its people were a white- skinned race like the Khatai (Chinese); eighty villages were of its dependencies. The town of Marand which lay to the east of Khoi, on the banks of a stream which was a right bank affluent of the Khoi river, is described by Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century as a small fortress with a mosque, and a market in the suburb, which was surrounded by gardens. Yaktit says that it was ruined byXI] ADHARBAYJAN. the Kurds who had carried off most of its inhabitants after plundering the town. Its river according to Mustawfi was called the Ztiltl (or Zakvir), and a part of it was said to flow for four leagues underground. Mustawfi states that in his day Marand was only half its former size, but was still famous for the rearing of the Kirmiz-worm (cochineal), used for making the red dye, and that round the town were 60 villages that were of its dependencies 1 . Nakhchivan, or Nakjawan, to the north of the Aras river, was generally counted as of Adharbayjan. It is identical with Nashawa of the Arab geographers, and is often mentioned in the Itiner aries, but no description of the town is given. Nakhchivan rose to importance under the Mongols, and Mustawfi describes it as a large town built of brick. Near it, to the eastward, was the fortress of Alanjik, and to the north rose the snow-clad mountain called Mast Kuh. In Nakhchivan stood the dome built by Diya-al-Mulk, son of Nizam-al-Mulk, the great Wazir of Malik Shah the Saljilk, and 4 Ali of Yazd describes the famous bridge of Diya-al-Mulk (the ruins of which still exist) which crossed the Aras at the fortress of Karkar on the road to Marand, about 15 miles from Nakhchivan. A little lower down on the Aras is Julfah, otherwise written Jtilahah, which was destroyed by Shah c Abbas of Persia in 1014 (1605), when he transported all its Armenian inhabitants to the new suburb which he built to the south of Isfahan and named Julfah from the older Julfah on the Araxes. Among other towns on the banks of the Aras river Mustawfi mentions Urdiibad (which still exists), near where a river joins the Aras from the south, on whose banks stood the castle of Dizmar, which is also mentioned by Yakiit. Still lower down the Aras lay the town of Zangiyan in the Murdan Na'im district, where a second bridge, still in existence, crosses the Araxes. This is called the Piil-i- Khuda-Afarin in Persian, 'the Bridge of Praising God,' which Mustawfi says had been built by one of the Companions of the prophet Muhammad in the year 15 (636). The Murdan (or Murad) Na^m territory comprised in its circuit over 30 villages 2 . 1 1st. 181. I. H. 239. Muk. 377. Kaz. i. 180; ii. 354. Yak. i. 218; ii. 502; iii. 120; iv. 503.

The city of Ardabil stood on the upper waters of the river called Andarab by Mustawfi, and the Ardabil river, after being joined lower down on its left bank by the Ahar river, flowed into the Araxes some way below the bridge of Khuda-Afarin. The rivers of Ardabil and Ahar rose on the eastern and western slopes, respectively, of the great mountain called Sablan Kuh, which overhangs Ardabil, and from whose southern slopes the Sarav river, as already mentioned, takes its course westward to the Urmiyah lake. Mount Sablan is mentioned in the 4th (10th) century by Ibn Hawkal, who erroneously considered it as higher than Damavand, some miles to the north of Tihran. Its slopes were covered with trees, and here stood villages and many towns, which are enumerated by Mustawfi. The mountain, he adds, was visible 50 leagues away, its summit being always covered with snow, while near the top was a spring the surface of which remained always frozen. Near Mount Sablan also were two other peaks, Kuh Sarahand north of Ahar, and Siyah Kuh (the Black Mountain), which last towered above Kalantar, a small town with a castle which stood among woods, with a river flowing through its many cornfields. Ardabil, as already said, was the capital city of Adharbayjan in the 4th (10th) century. It is described by Istakhri as walled, and measuring two-thirds of a league across every way j the houses were of burnt brick and clay, and at that time troops were kept here in garrison. Its dependencies were extremely fertile, and the Ardabil honey was famous. Mukaddasi speaks of the fortress, and the markets of Ardabil were in four cross-streets, with the Friday Mosque standing at the intersection point. Out side the town was an extensive suburb. In 617 (1220) Ardabil was sacked by the Mongols and left a ruin; but just before this, when Yakdt was here, it was a most populous city. Ardabil had been known anciently by the Persian name of Badhan Firuz. When Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (14th) century, though no longer the chief town of Adharbayjan, it had recovered much of its former splendour j and in the 10th (16th) century, as already stated, it became for a time the capital of the whole of Persia under the newly founded dynasty of the Safavids, before they removed, first to Tabriz and afterwards to Isfahan.XIJ adharbayjAn. 169 Ahar which lies 150 miles west of Ardabil, on the Ahar river, is named in the lists of the earlier Arab geographers, and described by Yaktit as a well-built city, to the north of which lay Mount Sarahand. It was surrounded by many small towns standing on the hill-slopes, the names of which are recorded by both YaMt and Mustawfi, but these are difficult now to recognise or identify. The surrounding district was known as Pishkin (at the present day Mishkin), from the name of the ruling family who flourished here in the 8th (14th) century. The town of Pishkin lay one march from Ahar, and originally had been known as Varavi. The river Andarab, just above where the Ahar river joined it, Mustawfi says, was crossed by a fine bridge that had been built by c Ali Shah, the Wazir of Ghazan Khan the Mongol 1 . The Safid Rud, or White River, with its many affluents, drained all the south-eastern part of Adharbayjan. Its main stream for most of its length formed the frontier dividing Adharbayjan from the Jibal province, and the river finally flowed out to the Caspian Sea through the province of Gilan. Istakhri and other Arab writers give the name as the Sabid-rMh. Mustawfi says that in his time it was known to the Mongols as the HMan Mfilan (more exactly Ulan Moren), which in Mongolian means &lt; Red River and at the present day part of the Safid Rud is known as Kizil Uzen, which in Turkish also signifies 'Red Stream.' Mustawfi writes that the Safid RM rose in the highlands of Kurdistan, in a mountain called Panj Angiisht (in Persian) or Besh Parmak (in Turkish), and both names mean 'the Five Fingers.' Flowing north the Safid RM first received the Zanjan river on its right bank, coming from the city of that name, which will be described in a later chapter; then on its left bank there flowed in the Miyanij river, formed by the confluence of many streams coming down from the west. North of Miyanij the Safid RM turned west, receiving on its left bank the united streams of the Sanjidah and Gadiv rivers coming down from Khalkhal to the south of Ardabil, and next the Shal river from the Shah RM district of Khalkhal. Below this on its right bank, and coming from the Jibal province (as will be described in 1 1st. 181. I. H. 237, 238, 240, 266. Muk. 374, 377. Yak. i. 197, 367, 409, 461; iv. 918. Mst. 156, 157, 204, 205, 217.170 ADHARBAYJAN. [CHAP. Chapter XV), the Tarum river joins the Safid Riid, and next the river Shah Rud (not to be confused with the district of Shah RM just named) coming from the country of the Assassins, and then finally, after piercing the mountain barrier, the Safid RM reaches the Caspian Sea at Kawtam in the province of Gilan. The Miyanij river, as already said, was the most important left bank affluent of the Safid RM. It came from the west, rising in the country south of Ujan (see p. 163), and in the Garm RM district received on its left bank the waters of the Garm RM (Hot River), a stream which rose in the hills to the south of Sarav. Below the town of Miyanij the main stream receives on its right bank the waters of the Hasht RM, 4 the Eight Streams/ which have their sources in the hills to the east of Maraghah; and, in the time of Mustawfi, where the Hasht RM joined the Miyanij river, there spanned it a great masonry bridge of thirty- two arches. The town of Miyanij or Miyanah, ' the Middle Place,' which stands at the junction of all these streams, was an important centre from the earliest times. Ibn Hawkal writes of it as very populous in the 4th (10th) century, and its district—in later times known under the name of the Garm RM—produced great quantities of fruit. Mukaddasi, who gives the modern form of the name Miyanah, praises its store of goods, and YaMt, who had visited it in the 6th (12th) century, extols its situation. In the following century, when Mustawfi wrote, it had sunk to the size of a large village, but was still an important stage on the road system inaugurated by the Mongols. The climate was hot, and insect pests were numerous (the Miyanah bug at the present day is a terror to travellers), but the Garm RM district comprised over a hundred fertile villages, and much corn was grown. The three rivers called Sanjidah, Gadiv (or Kadpti, in the Jahdn Numd), and Shal, joined the Safid RM from the north, coming down from the Khalkhal district. Khalkhal was also the name of the chief town of this district, the position of which is given in the Itinerary as 12 leagues south of Ardabil. Firtizabad, situated at the summit of the pass, where there was a boiling spring bubbling up in the midst of the snow- clad peaks, according to Mustawfi had in former times been thexi] adharbAyjAn. 171 residence of the governor, but when it fell into ruin Khalkhal city took its place. The exact position of Firuzabad, however, cannot now be fixed. The small towns of KaWr and Shal, which are still to be found on the map, were of the Shah Rud district, and lay on the Shal river (now called the Lesser Shah Rud) which rose in the Shal hills. Mustawfi mentions a number of other places in Khalkhal, the names of which, however, cannot now be identified 1 . The few products of Adharbayjan will be described at the end of the next chapter ; and the summary of the high roads through this province must be deferred to the conclusion of Chapter XV, after describing the Jibal province, for these roads all start from various points on the great Khurasan road which traverses the latter province. 1 1st. 189. i. h. 246, 253.

The Safid RM, as described in the last chapter, after traversing the chain of the Alburz mountains by a tortuous course, flows into the Caspian Sea at the western end of its southern shore, and here forms a delta with marshlands of some breadth backed by the mountain chain. This delta of the Safid RM, with the great amphitheatre of forest-clad foot-hills surrounding it on the south and west, is the small province of Gilan, which the Arabs called Jil or Jilan, and which comprised three very different districts 1 . The alluvial delta lands are those more especially called Jil or Jilan by the Arab geographers, who when referring to the whole province often give the name in the plural form, Jilanat, 'the Gilans,' which may then be taken to include the mountain districts. To the south and west, the mountain range bordering on the districts of Talikan and Tarum in the Jibal province, was the Daylam country, generally also given in the plural form as Ad-Daylaman; and this country became famous in history as the original home of the Buyids, or Daylamites, whose chiefs were masters of Baghdad, and of the Caliphate for the most part, 1 For Gilan see Map v, at the beginning of the following chapter.CH. XII] GILAN AND THE NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. 173 during the 4th (loth) century. The narrow strip of shore and mountain slope, running north from the south-west corner of the Caspian, and facing east wer that sea, is the Talish country, a name which Yakiit gives under the plural form Talishan or Tilshan. To the east, on the Tabaristan frontier, was the mountain range of Ar-Riibanj, beyond which came the hill district belonging to the great Karin family, whose chiefs had from time immemorial been rulers of these fastnesses, as will be further mentioned in Chapter XXVL When Mukaddasi wrote in the 4th (10th) century, and the Buyid supremacy was at its height, all Gilan, together with the mountain provinces to the eastward and along the shore of the Caspian, namely, Tabaristan, Jurjan, and Klimis, were in cluded in the province of Daylam, but in later times these eastern provinces came to be counted as separate. Afterwards the name of Daylam itself for the most part fell out of use, and the lowlands of the Safid RM delta gave their name to the whole of the adjacent district, which was commonly known as the Jilan province. More exactly, however, Jilan was the coast district, while Daylam was the mountain region overhanging it, and at different times either of these names in turn might be taken commonly to include the whole province lying round the south-western corner of the Caspian Sea 1 . The chief city of Daylam is said to have been called Rudhbar, but its situation is unknown. Mukaddasi on the other hand says the capital was known as Barvan, but unfortunately it no longer exists and none of the Itineraries give its exact position. Barvan, Mukaddasi adds, had neither good houses nor good markets, and possessed no Friday Mosque. Where the governor resided was called the Shahrastan, and the merchants living here were wealthy, so that it was a flourishing town. Of Jilan, Mukaddasi gives Diilab as the chief town, which he describes as a fine place, its houses being well built of stone; the market was excellent, and a Friday Mosque stood in it. According to Abu-l-Fida Dtilab is 1 1st. 204, 205, 206. I. H. 267, 268. Muk. 353. Yak. i. 174, 812; ii. 179, 711; iii. 571. Mst. 147, 191. A. F. 426.

Two marches from the Safid RM, and four from Baylaman, was the town of Khashm, the residence of the Alid chief (the Da/i or Missioner), who in the latter half of the 3rd (9th) century ruled these provinces as an independent (heretical) sovereign, who did not acknowledge the Caliph. Mukaddasi describes Khashm as having a fine market and a Friday Mosque near the chiefs palace. A river ran through the town, which was crossed by a remarkable bridge of boats. The identification and situation of all these early towns is exceedingly uncertain 1 . In the 8th (14th) century the chief towns of Gilan, according to Mustawfi, were Lahijan and Ftimin. Abu-l-Fida also mentions Lahijan, which lies to the eastward of the mouth of the Safid RM. It was then a fair-sized town; much silk was manufactured here and the district grew rice and corn, also oranges and shaddocks with other fruits of a hot region. Kawtam or Ktltam, nearer the mouth of the Safid Rtid, was the harbour for ships coming from other parts of the Caspian; it is mentioned by YaMt and Abu-l-Fida, having been a place of much commerce in the 8th (14th) century, and the town lay one day's march from the actual shore of the Caspian. Fiimin with its district lies further inland, and to the west of the Safid Riid. It is counted as the chief town of the mountain region of Daylam, and Mustawfi writes of it as a large place standing in a fertile district growing much corn and rice. Silk was also produced and manufactured here. Mustawfi is one of the earliest authorities to describe Rasht, now the capital of Gilan, but none of the Arab geographers appear even to name it. He notices its warm damp climate, cotton and silk being both largely produced for export, and the place was already in his time of some size and importance. To the westward of Rasht extends, at the present day, the district of 1 1st. 204, 205. Muk. 355, 360, 373, A. F. 429 (where, in error, Bay laman is printed Btmdn). Yak. ii. 831.

According to Abu-l-Fida it was the chief city of the Jilan or lowlands; its districts were very fertile, corn, cotton, rice, oranges, shaddocks and lemons being grown for export. Shaft, or Shaftah, is the name of a town mentioned in similar terms by Mustawfi, though at present only the Shaft district exists, which lies to the southward of Rasht. Finally, as of Gilan, Mastawfi mentions the little town of Isfahbad, which Yak6t spells Isfahbudhan, adding that it stood two miles distant from the coast of the Caspian, but not otherwise indicating its position; corn, rice, and a little fruit were grown here, and in the neighbouring district were near a hundred villages. The name of the township came from the Isfahbads or Ispahbids, who had been the semi-independent kings of this country under the Sassanians, and who, nominally converted to Islam, continued to rule as princes in Tabaristan under the earlier Caliphs'. Mughdn. Mughan, Mughkan, or Mukan 2 is the name of the great swampy plain which stretches from the base of Mount Sablan to the east coast of the Caspian Sea, lying south of the mouth of the river Aras, and north of the mountains of Talish. It was some times counted as part of the Adharbayjan province, but more often formed a separate district. The capital of Mughan in the 4th (10th) century was a city of the same name, the position of which it is difficult to fix. Mukad- dasi speaks of Mukan city as lying on two rivers, with gardens all round, and as almost of the size of Tabriz. From his de scription it is not improbable that this Mukan city was identical with Bajarvan, which Mustawfi names as the older capital of the district, and which in his day had already gone to ruin. The position of Bajarvan he gives in his Itineraries as four leagues north of Barzand, a name which is still found on the map. Further, Moslem tradition connected Bajarvan with the Fountain of Life, said to have been discovered near here by the prophet Khidr, 1 Yak. i. 298; iv. 316. A. F. 426, 429. Mst. 191, 192. J. N. 343, 344. 2 For Mughan and the north-west frontier provinces see Map in, p. 87.1/6 GILAN AND THE NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. [CHAP. otherwise Elias. As already stated, to the south of Bajarvan lay Barzand, which is described as a great city by Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi praises its markets, where goods from all the surround ing regions were collected for exportation, for this was the commer cial centre of the district. Mustawfi mentions both Bajarvan and Barzand as sunk to be mere villages in his time; the climate in the surrounding districts was hot, and much corn was grown 1 . In the Mtikan plain Mustawfi names the three towns of Pilsuvar, MahmMabad, and Hamshahrah. Pilsuvar, which stood on a stream coming down from Bajarvan, lay at a distance of eight leagues from the latter place, and it is said to have been so called after the Amir Pil-Suwar sent here by the Buyids, whose name signified 4 great rider or soldier.' MahmMabad in the plain of Gavbari, near the Caspian, was twelve leagues beyond Pilsuvar, and Mustawfi adds that it had been built by Ghazan Khan the Mongol. The neighbouring Hamshahrah was two leagues from the coast, and originally had been known as Abra- shahr, or Biishahrah, having been founded, says Mustawfi, by Farhad, son of GMarz, £ whom they identify with Nebuchadnezzar/ To the north of Bajarvan, in earlier times, was Balkhab, de scribed as a populous village with guard-houses and hostelries for travellers; and beyond this stage on the northern high road, and upon the south bank of the Aras, was Warthan, at the crossing into the Arran country. In the 4th (10th) century Warthan was a walled city with markets and much merchandise, having a suburb without its gates. The place was very populous, standing in a plain two leagues from the river bank, and its Friday Mosque was in the suburb; further, tradition averred that Warthan had been built by order of Zubaydah, wife of Hartln-ar-Rashid 2 . Arran. The provinces of Arran, Shirvan, Georgia and Armenia, which for the most part lay north of the river Araxes, were hardly counted among the lands of Islam, and hence are but perfunctorily described by the Arab geographers. From early days Moslems 1 I. H. 251. Muk. 3765 378. Yak. i. 454, 562; iv. 686. Mst. 159, 160, i 98. J. N. 392. 2 I. H. 251. Muk. 376. Yak. iv. 919. Mst. 160, 198. J. N. 393.XII] GILAN AND THE NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. 177 lived here, and governors were appointed at various times by the Caliphs, but the majority of the population continued to be Christian until near the close of the middle-ages. Hence it was not till the resettlement subsequent to the Mongol invasion, and more especially after the many campaigns which Timur waged in Georgia at the close of the 8th (14th) century, when these lands came to be permanently settled by the Turks, that Islam became the dominant faith. The province of Arran is included in the great triangle of land lying to the west of the junction point of the rivers Cyrus and Araxes—the Kur and the Aras of the Arabs—and it is thus 'between the two rivers' (Bayn-an-Nahrayn) as Mustawfi calls it. The earlier Arab geographers write the name Al-Ran (pronounced Ar-Rdn) to give it the appearance of an Arabic word, and the capital town in the 4th (10th) century was Bardha'ah, the ruins of which still exist. Bardha'ah, later written Barda', Ibn Hawkal describes in the 4th (10th) century as measuring a league across, and it was by far the largest city of these parts. It was built in the form of a square, was protected by a fortress, and stood about three leagues from the Kur river, on the bank of its affluent the Tharthur. Near by the town, in the Kur, was caught the fish called Sarmahi (otherwise Shur-mahi in Persian, salt-fish), which after being salted was exported to all neighbouring towns. This fish was also found in the Aras river near Warthan. The fertile district round Bardha'ah was known by the name of Al-Andarab, where villages with continuous gardens and orchards, a day's journey across in every direction, produced abundant fruits, especially chestnuts, filberts, and figs. In these parts also the silkworm was reared. A great market was held every Sunday outside Bardha'ah at the Bab-al-Akrad, ' the gate of the Kurds'; and the market-place stretched a league in length. It was called locally Al-Kurki (from the Greek Kuriakos, ' the Lord's day'), and Sunday, we are told, was here commonly known as the day of the Kurki. Bardha'ah further had a fine Friday Mosque, the roof of which was supported on wooden pillars, its walls being of burnt brick covered with stucco. Also there were many hammams, or hot-baths ; and in Omayyad times the Treasury of the province was kept at L e S. 12I/S GILAN AND THE NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. [CHAP. Bardha c ah. In the 7th (13th) century, when Yakfit wrote, Bardha'ah had already fallen to ruin, though Mustawfl in the following century still refers to it as a considerable town on the river Tharthtir. At the crossing of the Kur, probably below the junction of the Tharthiir, and 18 leagues, counted as a day ? s march, on the direct road from Bardha^h to Shamakhi in Shirvan, was the town of Barzanj, much frequented by merchants, where goods were stored for import and export 1 . The city of Baylakan, known in Armenian as Phaidagaran, became the capital of Arran after the decay of Bardha'ah. Though all traces of the town have now apparently disappeared, its approximate position is clearly given by the Arab itineraries. Baylakan lay 14 leagues south of Bardha'ah and seven or nine leagues north of the Aras on the road up from Barzand, and it still existed as a great place in the 9th (15th) century. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes it as a fine city, watered by streams with many mills, and surrounded by gardens and orchards. It was celebrated for a particular kind of syrup made here. In the year 617 (1220) Baylakan was stormed by the Mongols, who, finding no stones in the surrounding plain for their mangonels, cut down the plane trees, sawed the trunks into blocks, and shot these against the walls and houses of the city, which was subsequently plundered and burnt. The population, however, after a time returned, rebuilt their houses, and the place regained its former prosperity. At the close of the 8th (14th) century it was besieged and taken by Timtlr, who afterwards caused it to be rebuilt, and a canal was dug from the river Aras, six leagues in length and 15 ells in width, by which the new town was well supplied with water. This canal was known as the Barlasi, from the Barlas tribe, from which Timiir was sprung. Two other cities of Arran are also mentioned, both of which lie to the north-west of Bardha'ah, on the road to Tiflis. The first of these is Ganjah (now better known as Elizabetpol), which the Arab geographers wTite Janzah, and its river is called by Kazwini the Kirdkas. Further to the north-west again lay Shamkftr, the ruins of which still exist, and this town in the 3rd 1 1st. 182, 183, 187, 188. I. H. 240, 241, 244, 251. Muk. 374, 375. Yak. i. 558, 562. Mst. 160.

The Aras rises in the Kahkala country of western Armenia, and after passing along the northern frontiers of Adharbayjan joins the river Kur (according to Mustawfi) in the Karabagh country in the eastern part of Arran. The river Kur rises in the mountains west of Tiflis in Georgia, namely, in the country of the Khazars, which comprised the districts of Abkhas and Allan. Passing Tiflis the Kur flows down to Shamktir, and here, according to Mustawfi, sends off a branch, or canal, which ends in the great Shamkur swamp or lake. The Kur, after being joined by the Aras river some distance below Bardha'ah, flows out to the Caspian in the Gushtasfi district 2 . Shir van. Beyond the Kur river, and along the Caspian where the Caucasus range sinks to the sea, is the Shirvan province, of which the capital was Ash-Shamakhiyah, now called Shamakhi or Shamakha. In the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi describes this as a stone-built town, at the foot of the mountains, surrounded by gardens. Its governor, the ruler of the province, was called the Shirvan Shah. Much corn was grown here, and in the neighbour hood, according to Moslem tradition as reported by Mustawfi, was to be seen both the Rock of Moses (referred to in the Kuran, xviii. 62) and the site of the Fountain of Life, already mentioned as also localised in Bajarvan. Two other towns of the Shirvan 1 No trace of the ruins of Baylakan appear on the Russian ordnance map. I. K. 122. Kud. 213. 1st. 187, 189. I. H. 244, 251. Muk. 376. Yak. i. 797; hi. 322.

[CHAR province are mentioned by Mukaddasi and other early authorities, the sites of which have not been fixed, namely Shabaran, chiefly inhabited by Christians, which is said to have stood 20 leagues distant from Darband, and the city of Shirvan, which lay in the plain, having a Friday Mosque in its market-place. The latter was three days' march from the capital Shamakhi on the road to Darband. The northernmost place in Shirvan was Bab-al-Abwab, 4 the Gate of Gates,' as the Arabs called Darband, the famous port on the Caspian. Ibn Hawkal says that in the 4th (10th) century the town was larger than Ardabil, then the capital of Adharbayjan. The harbour was protected by two moles, stretching out into the sea, and at their extremity was a water-gate, closed by chains, so that no ship could go out or in except by permission. These moles were built of blocks of stone fastened by lead joints. A stone wall enclosed the town, and it had two gates, the Great Gate and the Little Gate, besides the Water Gate aforesaid; and the walls had towers. The linen stuffs which were made in Darband were largely exported, also saffron from the neighbouring countryside. There was a fine mosque in the market-place of Bab-al-Abwab, which was here the frontier town of Islam, for the place in early days was surrounded by infidel folk. Yakilt gives a long account of the various tribes inhabiting the mountains and highlands of the Caucasus to the westward, among which he says that seventy different languages were spoken, and no man could understand that of his neighbour. Of these the Khazars, from whom the Caspian Sea, generally called the Bahr-al-Khazar, took its name, were the most important. Yakilt also describes the great wall which ran along the hill-crests westward from Darband, built to keep out the Barbarians, which had been erected, it was said, by King AnHshirvan of Persia in the sixth century a.d. The river Samiir, which flows into the Caspian a short distance to the south of Darband, is described by Mukaddasi under the name of the Nahr- al-Malik, 'the King's River,' otherwise the Nahr-as-Samtir, and there was a bridge of boats {Jisr) across it, some 20 leagues from Darband, on the road coming up from Shamakhi. The port of Bakiih, or Baktiyah (modern BaM), lies south ofXII] gilAn and the north-west provinces. 181 Darband, and Istakhn refers to its well-known naphtha springs. Yakut and others describe these in detail, the produce was worth a thousand dirhams (^40) a day 'the naphtha flowed continuously, and all the ground was on fire round and about. Mustawfl speaks of the castle of Bakuyah, which being high placed above the town kept it in shadow at midday. To the south of Bakuh was the Gushtasfi district, near the mouth of the Kur river, from which its lands were watered by a canal, much corn and cotton being grown here. Lastly, in the mountains near Darband was the fortress of Kabalah, where according to Mukaddasi there was a mosque on a hill. Kabalah is more than once mentioned in the campaigns of Timur, Mustawfi adding that both silk and corn are of its produce 1 . Gurjistdn. Gurjistan, which we call Georgia, and Abkhas, otherwise Abkhasia, were lands that only became Moslem districts after the campaign of Timur in these parts, at the close of the 8th (14th) century. Tiflis, the capital of Gurjistan, on the upper waters of the river Kur, was, however, well known to the geo graphers of the 4th (xoth) century. Ibn Hawkal describes it as possessing double walls, strongly fortified, with three gates. There were natural hot-baths in Tiflis where hot springs gushed out in the river bed, and the surrounding country was extremely fertile. The town lay on both banks of the Kur, and a bridge of boats, Mukaddasi writes, connected the two quarters. The neighbouring district of Abkhas, or Abkhaz, was according to Mukaddasi to be counted as of the Jabal-al-Kabk, the Caucasus. Here stood the village of Jonah, Kariyat Yunis, inhabited by Moslems, and round this were the tribes of the Gurj (Georgians), Allan, and others. Many rivers flowed down from the mountain of Alburz, according to Mustawfi, who further mentions Kars as one of the chief towns of Georgia 2 . 1 1st. 184, 189, 190. I. H. 241, 251.

Great Armenia (spelt Arminiyah, in Arabic) was divided into Inner and Outer, and though mostly inhabited by Christians, was brought under Moslem rule at an early period. The country lay comprised within the great knot of mountains lying between the lake of Van and the Gukchah lake, and from these highlands the Aras river and the two branches of the Euphrates took their rise. The capital of Moslem Armenia in early times was Dabil, otherwise called Duwm or Tovin, now marked by a small village to the south of Erivan, near the Aras river. In the 4th (10th) century Dabil was a larger town than Ardabil, and was the chief place in Inner Armenia. It was a walled town, having three gates, and a Friday Mosque stood here side by side with the church. Mount Ararat, with its double peak, towered above Dabil to the south, across the Araxes. As already said (p. 94) Moslem tradition identified Jabal JMi, in Upper Mesopotamia, as the mount on whose summit the Ark of Noah had come to rest. Ararat, in Armenia, they called Jabal-al-Harith (of £ the Labourer' or ' Ploughman,' or else Al-Harith was taken as the proper name of a pre-Islamic Arab who had settled in these parts). The lesser peak of Ararat was called Al-Huwayrith, ' Little Ha- rith, ? and Istakhri says that both summits were always covered with snow, and they were not to be scaled by reason of their great height and steepness. The people of Dabil cut firewood on their slopes, and hunted the abundant game here, and Muk- addasi adds that a thousand hamlets were situated among the spurs flanking the great mountain. The wool stuffs of Dabil, dyed red with the kirmiz insect, were famous. In the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi describes Dabil as peopled by Kurds, and the Christians, he says, had the upper hand. Outside the town was the plural, meaning the range; but he uses the term vaguely, and only one part of these corresponded with the Caucasus chain. At the present day Alburz, generally pronounced Elburz, or Elbruz, is the name of the highest mountain peak of the Caucasus; and in Persia Alburz is now used to designate the great range of mountains (of which Damavand is the highest peak) lying to the north of Tihran.XII] GILAN AND THE NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. 183 a great suburb surrounded by gardens. Am, the older capital of Christian Armenia, which was taken and sacked in 456 (1064) by Alp Arslan the Saljtik, is mentioned by Mustawfi as a town in the mountains where much fruit was grown. At some distance to the north-east of Dabil lies the sweet-water lake, called Gukchah Tangiz (the Blue Lake) by 'Alt of Yazd; this, however, does not appear to be named by any earlier Moslem authority than Mustawfi 1 . The lake of Van, or of Arjish as it is called by the earlier authorities, was naturally the best known of the Armenian lakes, having on its shores the cities of Akhlat, Arjish, Van, and Vastan. Istakhri describes it as twenty leagues in length, and it was cele brated for the fish called tirrikh (of the herring kind and still caught here in immense numbers) which after being salted was in the 7 th (13th) century exported to Mesopotamia, and even to the furthest parts of Khurasan, for Yakiit says he bought some of this salt fish in Balkh. The waters of the lake were salt and bitter. Akhlat, or Khilat, at the western end of the lake, was one of the largest cities of Armenia. Mustawfi describes it as standing in a plain, surrounded by gardens, and dominated by a fortress. The Friday Mosque stood in the market-place. The cold here was severe in winter, but the town was very populous; it stood on the banks of a small stream across which was a bridge; and Mustawfi praises the gardens of the neighbouring district. Above Akhlat was the great mountain called Kuh Sipan, visible, says Mustawfi, fifty leagues away, and its summit was always snow-clad. Arjish, a town on the northern shore of the lake, to which it frequently gave its name, according to Mustawfi, had been strongly fortified by the Wazir Ali Shah by order of Ghazan Khan in the 8th (14th) century, and the country round was famous for its corn lands. Further to the east was the town of Barkiri, or Bahargiri, near Band-i-Mahi (the Fish Dam), on the road from Arjish to Khuwi (Khoi) in Adharbayjan, and it is described by Mustawfi as having a strong castle crowning a hill. Its river came down from the Alatak pastures, where the Il-Khan, Arghiin, had built his great summer palace in the midst of 1 1st. 188, 191. I. H. 244. Muk. 374, 377, 380. Yak. ii. 183, 549.

The city of Van, which at the present day gives its name to the lake, stands near its eastern shore; but we have no description of it. The fortress of Vastam or Vastan lies on the south shore and is spoken of by Mustawfi, in the 8th (14th) century, as having a large town near it. Finally near the south-western corner of the lake lies Badlis (Bitlis), described by Mukaddasi as situated in a deep gorge where two streams met. A castle built of stone protected the town, and according to Yakut the apples grown in its district were so ex cellent as to be largely exported to all neighbouring lands 1 . The products of these northern provinces were few, and the manufactures consisted chiefly of stuffs dyed red with the kirmiz, an insect that fed on the oak trees growing throughout Adharbay- jan, and gave its name to the ' cramoisie' silks, being the origin of our words 'crimson' and 'carmine.' Ibn Hawkal and Mukad dasi both describe the kirmiz. The former says it was a worm like the silkworm, spinning for itself a cocoon exactly like the silkworm's cocoon ; Mukaddasi, on the other hand, writes that the kirmiz insect, or worm, was found on the earth, and that the women went out to gather it up, and afterwards dried it in an oven on brass pans. Silk, goat's-hair stuffs, linen, and wool were dyed with it, and the colour was famous in all lands. Armenia in general was also noted for its girdles, ribbed coverlets, carpets, rugs, cushions and veils; these commodities with figs, walnuts, and the salted tirnkh fish from lake Van already noticed, were the chief exports, and might all be found in great store at Dabil. The town of Bardha'ah was also celebrated for the silk produced in its neighbourhood, and from the countryside, as from Bab-al- Abwab, great numbers of mules were obtained for export j while lastly from the latter port, otherwise called Darband, came slaves brought thither from out of the northern lands 2 . 1 1st. 188, 190. i. h. 245, 248.

The broad mountain region, which the Greeks called Media, stretching across from the Mesopotamian plains on the west to the great desert of Persia on the east, was known to the Arab geographers as the province of Al-Jibal, 'the Mountains.' This name afterwards fell out of use, and during the 6th (12th) century under the later SaljUks, the province came by a misnomer to be called 'Irak 'Ajami, which means Persian Trak, being so named to distinguish it from the older 'Irak of the Arabs, which was Lower Mesopotamia 1 . How this change in the name came about would appear to have been as follows. Al-Trak, as already said (Chapter II, p. 25, note), besides being the Moslem denomination for the lower half of Mesopotamia, was commonly, but in the dual form, applied 1 'Ajam or 'Ajami is the name originally applied by the Arabs to a 'foreigner,' or non-Arab, as the Greeks used the term Barbarian. Since the Persians were the first foreigners with whom the Arabs came into contact 'Ajam and 'Ajami soon became specialised to mean 'the Persian foreigner,' and as the equivalent of ' Persian' is in use at the present time. Jibdl is in Arabic the plural of Jabal, 4 a hill.' Abu-l-Fida (p. 40S) has the double name ; he writes ' Bilad-al-Jabal (Provinces of the Mountain) which is called by the people Trak-al-'Ajam (Persian Trak).''mmmm 186 JIBAL. [CHAR by the Arabs to the two chief provincial cities, KMah and Basrah,, which hence were known as Al-'Irakayn—meaning 'the Two (capitals of) 'Irak.' This was the older and classical usage; but in the latter part of the sth (nth) century the Saljftks had come to rule over all western Persia, having their capital at Hamadan, and they also governed Mesopotamia, where the Abbasid Caliph resided. From him they received the title of Sultan of the Two 'Iraks, which seemed fitting to their case, and the second of the two Traks soon came to be understood as meaning the province of Jibal, where the Saljuk prince more especially resided, which thus by the vulgar came to be known for distinction as Persian 'Irak. This is the account of the matter given by Yaktlt, who states that the Persians in his day, but incorrectly and as a modern usage, called the province Persian Trak. Yaktit himself uses the older name of Al-Jibal, for which his contemporary Kazvini,. writing also in Arabic, gives the Persian equivalent of Kuhistan (the Mountain province). The name Jibal, however, apparently became completely obsolete after the Mongol conquest, and Mus- tawfi in the Sth (14th) century nowhere uses it. He divides the older Jibal province into two parts, the smaller being Kurdistan on the west, the larger moiety Persian Trak on the east; and the name of 'Irak is still in use at the present day, for that part of the older Jibal province which lies south-west of Tihran is now locally known as the Trak district 1 . Pour great cities Kirmisin (later Kirmanshah), Hamadan^ Ray, and Isfahan—were from early days the chief towns of the four quarters of this province. In Buyid times, namely in the 4th (10th) century, according to Ibn Hawkal, the offices of the government were at Ray ^ at the close of the next century Hamadan became the capital under the Persian Saljrlks; but at all times Isfahan would appear to have been the largest and generally the most flourishing city of the Jibal province. In the present work it will be found convenient to describe the province as divided into the dependencies of its four great cities, and to begin with the western quarter, that dependent on Kirmanshah, which since the days of the Saljtiks has been commonly known as Kurdistan, signifying the land of the Kurds. 1 Yak. ii. 15. Kaz. ii. 228. Mst. 141.xiii] jibAl. 187 The capital city of Kirmanshahan, a name generally curtailed to Kirmanshah, was by the earlier Arabs known as Kirmisin (written also Kirmasin and Kirmashm). In the 4th (10th) century it is described by Ibn Hawkal as a pleasant town surrounded by trees, with running waters, where fruit was cheap and all commodities abundant. Mukaddasi, who is the first to mention the Persian name of Kirmanshahan, adds that there was a Great Mosque in the market-place, and that 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid had built himself a fine palace here in the main street of the city. Kazvmi in the 7th (13th) century speaks of Kirmisin as standing close to Kirmanshahan, as though these were twin cities ; Yaktit, who gives both names, says little of the town, con fining himself to a description of the sculptures and ruins on the neighbouring mountain of Bihistan. The Mongol invasion in the 7th (13th) century effected the ruin of Kirmanshah, which Mustawfi in the following century describes as reduced in his day to the size of a village, the name of which 'in books' was, he says, still written Kirmisin (since his time become obsolete), and he too is chiefly concerned with describing the Bihistan or BisutUn sculptures. These are on the side, and at the foot of the great mountain of black rocks, about a day's march to the east of Kirmanshah, near the Khurasan road, and they consist of remains dating from the Achaemenian kings (5th century B.C.) and the Sassanians (7th century a.d.). They are described in the 4th (10th) century by Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal, who write the name of the mountain Bihisttin and Bisuttin, adding that the sculptures were to be found near the village of Sasaniyan, doubtless the same village which Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century called Vastam or Bastam and which is now known as Tak-i-Bustan, ( the Garden Arch.' Here the well-known sculpture of Darius receiving the tributary kings, with the trilingual cuneiform inscription, is referred to by Ibn Hawkal, who describes it as being 4 the representation in stone of a school-house, with the master and the boys; further (he adds) in the school-master's hand is an instrument like a strap wherewith to beat: also there be cauldrons as used in a kitchen sculptured in stone.' In regard to the Sassanian sculptures, added over a thousand years later, these are chiefly in and about a grotto, wherei88 jibAl. [chap. there is a spring of water gushing out at the foot of the great mountain and, according to Ibn Hawkal, repeated by all later Persian authorities, they represent King Khusraw Parviz on his celebrated horse Shibdaz (or Shabdiz), while above him stands the beautiful Queen Shirin, her portrait adorning the roof of the grotto aforesaid. Somewhat defaced, these sculptures exist at the present day, and have been more than once figured and described. Yaktit who quotes the travels of Ibn Muhalhal, 4th (10th) century, and Mustawfi, give in some detail the popular legends of their time. The story of Khusraw and Shirin, and of her lover the sculptor Farhad who in despair slew himself, will be found localised in many of the neighbouring places; the incidents are well known, both from the Shah Ndmah of Firdtisi, and from Nizamfs great poem (which Mustawfi quotes) called the 4 Loves of Khusraw and ShirmV Overhanging Kirmanshah to the north, and on the left hand of one travelling along the great Khurasan road, was the isolated hill called Sinn Sumayrah, 'Sumayrah's Tooth/ whence the northern road started leading to Dinavar and the Adharbayjan province. ' Sumayrah/s Tooth' was so called from an Arab woman of that name, celebrated for her projecting teeth, and the Moslems gave the hill this nickname in jest, as they marched past it to the conquest of Nihavand. Eastward beyond Bisuttin, on the great Khurasan road, lies the village of Sihnah, as mentioned by Istakhn, and still existing though not to be confused with the modern town of Sihnah to be spoken of later. Beyond Sihnah village lies Kanguvar, which the Arabs called Kasr-al-Lustis, 4 the Robbers Castle/ from the evil ways of the inhabitants, who at the time of the first Moslem conquest stole all the baggage animals of the army sent against Nihavand. There was here, according to Ibn Rustah and others, a great arched building standing on a platform, and dating from the days of Khusraw Parviz, being constructed with columns and of mortared brickwork. The town of Kanguvar was of considerable size, and had a Friday Mosque i. R. 166. Ykb. 270. 1st. 195, 203. i. H. 256, 265, 266. Muk. 284, 393. Kaz. ii. 290. Yak. iii. 250; iv. 69. Mst. 168, 203. j.

YaMt asserts that the platform, where the Sassanian buildings stood, was 20 ells above the ground level, and Mustawfi adds that the great stones for its construction had been brought from the mountain of Bisuttin 1 . About 2 5 miles to the westward of Kanguvar are the ruins of Dmavar, which in the 4th (10th) century was the capital of the small independent dynasty named after Hasanawayh, or Hasantiyah, the Kurdish chief of the dominant tribe settled in these parts. At the time of the Moslem conquest of Persia Dinavar had received the name of Mah-al-Kfifah, 'because (as Ya'ktibi writes) its revenues were apportioned to the payment of the state pensions of the inhabitants of KMah ? ; and Mah Ktifah for a time became the common name for the city and its surrounding territory. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes Dinavar as two-thirds the size of Hamadan, and the population as more urbane and better mannered than the Hamadan people. Mukaddasi adds that the markets were well built, the surrounding gardens being very fruitful. The Great Mosque, which had been built by Hasanawayh, stood in the market-place, and over the pulpit rose a fine dome that was ornamented with sculptures. Dinavar w T as still an inhabited town when Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (14th) century; the climate was temperate, water plentiful, corn and grapes being abundantly grown. The place probably fell to its present state of ruin after the conquest of Timiir, who according to 'Ali of Yazd left some of his troops in garrison here. Probably in the neighbourhood of Dinavar, but the site appears to be as yet unknown, stood the great castle of Sarmaj, described by Yaktit as impregnable, being built of hewn stones by Hasanawayh, who died here in 369 (979)) after a glorious reign, according to Ibn-al-Athir, of nearly fifty years. In the next century Sarmaj was taken after a four years' siege in 441 (1049) by Tughril Beg the Saljiik, who, however, had to bring together an army of 100,000 men before he could force his brother Yunnal out of this almost impregnable stronghold 2 . 1 1st. 196. 1.

About sixty miles north of the ruins of Dinavar stands at the present day the important town of Sihnah, which is the modern capital of the Persian province of Kurdistan, though under this name it is not mentioned by any of the medieval Arab or Persian geographers. In the position of the modern Sihnah, however, according to the itineraries of Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, stood, during the middle-ages, the city of Sisar, a name which Yakut rightly says means in Persian 'Thirty Heads.' The neigh bourhood of Sisar abounded in springs and was known as the Sad-Khaniyah—'the Hundred Houses' or Heads of Water— from the number of these springs. The Caliph Amin had built a fortress here, which his more celebrated brother Mamun had garrisoned, taking into his pay the Kurdish tribes who held the surrounding pastures, and using them in the civil war against his brother, whom he deprived later on of the Caliphate. Sisar was counted as one of the 24 sub-districts of Hamadan j and it is possible that the modern name of Sihnah may be merely a corrup tion of Sad-Khaniyah, shortened to Si-Khanah, ' Thirty Houses,' but of this there is no direct evidence. Four marches north-west of Dinavar was the town of Shah- razflr, standing in the district of the same name. Ibn Hawkal, in the 4th (10th) century, mentions Shahrazilr as a walled and fortified town inhabited by Kurds, whose tribes he names j they occupied all the surrounding region, which was most fruitful. The traveller Ibn Muhalhal (as quoted by Yakut) describes in the 4th (10th) century the many towns and villages of this district, and the chief town, he says, was known among the Persians as Nim-Rah, or the Half-way House,' because it stood at the middle stage between Madain (Ctesiphon) and Shiz, the two great fire-temples of Sassanian times. The neighbouring mountains were called Sha ran and Zalam, where according to Kazvini a species of 530- Ibn-al-Athir, viii. 518, 519; ix. 380. According to Yakut (iv. 405) the Persian word M&amp;h is synonymous with Kasbah (chief town) in Arabic. The prefix Mdh, which occurs in the older names for DJnavar and Nihavand, is in Old Persian Mada, and as a place-name is radically the same word which has come down to us, through the Greeks, in the form of Media and the Medes. The ruins of Dmavar have been lately visited, and are described by L)e Morgan, Mission en Perse, ii. 95, 96.XIII] JIBAL. 191 grain was grown that was deemed a powerful aphrodisiac. The Kurds in this region, when Ibn Muhalhal visited the place, numbered 60,000 tents, and when Mustawfi wrote in the 8th {14th) century Shahraziir was still a flourishing town, and in habited by Kurds 1 . The great Khurasan road, which, as already described in our first chapter, went eastwards from Baghdad to the uttermost limits of Moslem lands, after crossing the Mesopotamian plain entered the mountainous region of Persia at Hulwan, a town of the Jibal province, which however was sometimes counted as of Arabian Trak. Ibn Hawkal says that in the 4th (10th) century Hulwan was half the size of Dinavar, and its houses were built of both stone and clay bricks. Though the climate was hot, dates, pomegranates, and figs growing abundantly, snow could all the summer through be found on the mountains two leagues above the city. Mukaddasi adds that there was an old castle in the town within which stood the mosque, and the city wall had eight gates, the names of which he enumerates. Outside the town stood a synagogue of the Jews, much venerated by them, which was built of squared stones set in mortar. In the 7th (13th) century, when Kazvini wrote, Hulwan was already in ruins, but famous for its sulphur springs. In the next century Mustawfi praises its crops, but says that the town stood desolate, except for divers shrines of Moslem saints, though the surrounding territory comprised thirty villages. Along the Khurasan road, and four leagues above Hulwan towards Kirind, lay Madharlistan, where according to Yakxit might be seen a great arched building surmounting a platform. This had formed part of the palace of the Sassanian king Bahram Giir, who laid out a paradise round it that, in Yakiit's days, had long gone to ruin. Six leagues beyond this comes the town of Kirind, which is apparently first mentioned by Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century; he couples Kirind with the neighbouring village called Khfishan, which however has now completely disappeared, though Mustawfi describes it as in his day more 1 I.

The district of Shahrazur still keeps the name, the old city stood where are the ruins now known as Yasin Tappah.192 JIBAL. [CHAP. populous even than Kirind. These two places lie together at the head of the Hulwan pass, in a fertile plain, and correspond in position—for as already said neither are mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers—with the station of Marj-al-KaPah (the Meadow Castle), which Ibn Hawkal describes as a great walled town surrounded by populous and fertile districts. Ya'Mbi states that in these pastures the Abbasid Caliph kept his stud of horses. Four leagues beyond these pastures the high road passed Tazar, where, according to Mukaddasi, might be seen the remains of a palace of the Chosroes, built Yaktit records by one Khusrujird, son of Shahan. Tazar had good markets, and it appears to be identical with Kasr Yazid (Yazid's palace or castle), mentioned by other authorities. Six leagues beyond Tazar again was Az- Zubaydiyah, 4 a fine healthy place' according to Ibn Hawkal, the position of which on the high road shows it to be identical with the present village of Hariinabad. Here the Khurasan road turns east, and crossing the plain of Mayidasht (or Mahidasht) runs direct to Kirmanshah. The Mayidasht plain is described by Mustawfi as in his day dotted with some fifty villages, surrounded by excellent pasture lands that were well watered from the neigh bouring hills. In this region was the castle of Harsin with a small town at its base, which still exists, lying about 20 miles to the south-east of Kirmanshah 1 . As regards the origin of the Kurdistan province, it is stated that about the middle of the 6th (12th) century Sultan Sanjar the Saljtik divided off the western part of the Jibal province, namely the region which was dependent on Kirmanshah, and giving it the name of Kurdistan put it under the government of his nephew Sulayman Shah, surnamed Ab^h (or Ayilh), who, at a later period that is from 554 to55^( II 59 to 1161)—succeeded his uncle as chief of the house of Saljtik and Sultan of the Two Traks. This is the account given by Mustawfi, who states that under Sulayman Shah Kurdistan flourished greatly, and its revenues then amounted to two million gold dinars (equivalent to about a million sterling), I.

The ruins of Hulwan exist at the village now called Sar-i-Pul (Bridge-head), where a bridge crossed the stream.XIII] JIBAL. 193 which was near ten times the sum yielded by the province in the 8th (14th) century under the Mongols, when Mustawfi was their revenue officer. Sulayman Shah made Bahar—a town that still exists, lying some eight miles to the north of Hamadan—his capital; and here there was a strong castle. In Mongol times a second capital was built, by Uljayttl Sultan, at Sultanabad Jamjamal (or Chamchamal) near the foot of the Bisuttin moun tain, and this town Mustawfi describes as standing in a rich country where much corn was grown. Of Jamjamal, or Cham chamal, the position is given in his itineraries (four leagues from Sihnah village, and six from Kirmanshah) and its ruins still exist, being marked on the map at the spot indicated. The town is frequently mentioned by c Ali of Yazd when describing the marches of Timiir through Kurdistan. Among other towns which occur in the description of the campaigns of Timiir, and which are noticed by Mustawfi, are Darband Taj Khattin, 'a medium-sized town now for the most part in ruin, ? and Darband Zangi, a smaller place, which had good pasture grounds with a temperate climate. Both towns apparently have disappeared from the map; but Darband means £ a pass/ and from £ Ali of Yazd, who writes the name of the first as Darband- Tashi-Khatiin, these two Darbands would appear to have stood on the western frontier of Kurdistan (between Shahrazilr and Hulwan), among the hills that here dominate the plains of Mesopotamia. Mustawfi also mentions four other towns in Kurdistan, namely Alani, Alishtar, Khuftiyan, and Darbil, as important places in his day, but it is not easy now to identify their sites. Alani, for which some mss. give the reading Alabi, in the 8th (14th) century was presumably one of the chief towns of the province, though no other authority but Mustawfi appears to mention it. Its lands grew wheat crops, it had a good climate, well-watered pastures lying round it, and there were w T ell-stocked hunting grounds in the neighbourhood. At Alishtar also was an ancient fire-temple called Ardahish (Arfikhsh or Arakhash). Unfortunately none of the Itineraries give its position; but the plain of Alishtar still exists, and probably one of its ruined sites is the town mentioned by Mus tawfi. It is doubtless identical with the town of Lishtar or Lashtar mentioned by Ibn Hawkal and others as lying 10 leagues south- L e S. 13west of Nihavand, being 12 leagues north of Sabikkhwast On the other hand the reading of the name Alishtar is, it must be admitted, extremely doubtful; many of the best mss., also the Turkish Jahan Numa, give Al-Bashr, and a variety of other forms occur. Nothing is known of Khuftiyan (for which the Jahan Numa gives Hakshi- yan, and the mss. a variety of readings) except that it was a strong castle surrounded by villages lying on the banks of the Zab river; but whether this was the Upper or the Lower Zab is not indicated. Its site is unknown and the same is the case with Darbil (or Dizbil), ' a medium-sized town with a good climate,' the position of which is not even approximately indicated by Mustawfi. This concludes his notice of the Kurdistan district 1 . Hamadan (which name the Arabs wrote Hamadhan) 2 is the ancient Ecbatana, the capital of the province of Media. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes Hamadhan as a large fine city, over a league square, which had been rebuilt since the Moslem conquest. Its walls had four gates, and without them was a suburb. There was much merchandise in its markets, and the surrounding district was very fertile, producing large crops, more especially saffron. Mukaddasi adds that the town possessed three rows of markets, and that in one of these stood the Great Mosque, a very old structure. YaMt, who has some notes on Hamadan, written shortly before it was laid in ruins by the Mongol invasion of 617 (1220), states that there were twenty-four Rustaks, or sub- districts, dependent on the city, and these he enumerates. The list is again given by Mustawfi in the following century, who adds thereto the names of the villages of each district; most of them however it is impossible now to identify. Mustawfi describes the city, in the 8th (14th) century, as measuring two leagues across, in the centre of which stood the ancient castle, built of clay, called the Shahristan. This ancient citadel of Hamadan like that of Isfahan—to be noticed later—is named Sartik by Ibn Fakih, but the meaning of the word is not explained. The goldsmiths' market 1 I. H. 259, 264. Yak. i. 276; iii. 5. Mst. 167, 192. A. Y. i. 584, 585, 599, 640. J. N. 450. Neither Bahar, Alani, Khuftiyan, Darbil, nor the two Darbands, are mentioned by any of the earlier Arab geographers. 2 Hamadhdn represents the Hagtnatdna of the Achsemenian inscriptions, which the Greeks wrote Ecbatana.xiii] jibAl. 195 in Hamadan was farnous, built on the site of the former village of Zamin Dili; and the city walls measured 12,000 paces in circuit. Originally, says Mustawfi, Hamadan comprised five cities, namely Kal'ah Kabrit, ' Sulphur Castle,' Kal'ah Makin, Girdlakh, Khurshid, and Kurasht. He adds, ' this last, formerly a large town, is now entirely ruined.' Of Hamadan, too, were the following five great districts, with their villages; namely, Farivar near the city, next Azmadin, Sharamin, and A'lam; with, lastly, the distiict of Sard Rud and Barhand Rild. It must, however, be added that the readings of these names are uncertain, as the mss. vary considerably 1 . Three leagues from Hamadan (but in what direction is not stated, and the name does not appear on the map), in the village of Juhastah, stood the ruins of the ancient castle of King Bahram GGr, described by Ibn Fakih. It was a huge structure, with halls, passages, and chambers, in part cut out of the live rock. At the four corners were sculptured female figures, and along one face of the building ran an inscription in Old Persian (Farstyah) com memorating the conquests of the Chosroes. Half a league distant from this palace was a hill, where was to be seen the so-called Antelope's tomb (Naus-az-Zabiyah), and Ibn Fakih gives a long anecdote concerning King Bahram Giir and his mistress, and of the many gazelles that he slew in the neighbouring plain, and how he finally put his mistress to death here for her insolent remarks in disparagement of his shooting. To the south-west of Hamadan rises the great mountain of Alvand, or Arvand as Yakut writes the word, and this form of the name appears as the mint city on silver dirhams of Abu-Sa'id, the Mongol Il-Khan, dated 729 (1329). Mustawfi gives a long account of Kuh Alvand, which he says was thirty leagues in circuit, its summit always being covered with snow. There was an abundant spring of water on the topmost peak, which issued from a sort of building cut in the rock, and forty-two other streams, he adds, gushed from the various spurs of the mountain. Travelling west from Hamadan, after crossing the Alvand pass, on the high road 1 J- H. 256, 260. Muk. 391. I. F. 219. Yak. iv. 988. Mst. 151, 152. The Turkish JahdnNumd (p. 300) repeats the enumeration of districts and villages from Mustawfi. 13—2196 JIBAL. [CHAP. to Kanguvar, stands Asadabad, which Ibn Hawkal describes as a populous city; and Mukaddasi adds that a league distant from it was to be seen the arch (Aywdn), in a building which Yaktit refers to as the Matabikh-al-Kisra, 'the Kitchens of Chosroes/ Asadabad had a mosque, and good markets; its district was very fertile and produced honey. Mustawfi says that 35 villages were of its dependencies 1 . The plain in which Hamadan stands drains to the north and east, its numerous streams uniting to form the head-waters of the river Gavmaha (or Gavmasa) whose course will be described later when speaking of the Kum river. To the north of Hamadan lies the district of Darguzin, and north of this again that of Kharrakan. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century writes of Darguzin as a con siderable town, formerly a village, the capital of the A'lam district, mentioned on the previous page as one of the five dependent on Hamadan. The A^lam district, he adds—and YaMt confirms him—was wrongly called Al-Amr by the Persians : it was a high plateau lying between Hamadan and Zanjan, where grapes, cotton, and corn grew abundantly. Kharrakan, more often called Khar- rakanayn, 4 the two Kharrakans,' lay north of the A'lam district. It comprised many villages, which Mustawfi enumerates (but the readings in the mss. are uncertain), and the chief town which still exists was Avah, or Abah of Hamadan, so named to distin guish it from Avah of Savah, which will be noticed later. This, the northern Avah, sometimes also written Ava, is mentioned by Yaktlt, and it is referred to as early as the 4th (10th) century by Mukaddasi. The Kharrakan river, according to Mustawfi, during the spring freshets poured its waters into the stream of the Khushk Rild which ultimately lost itself in, the great desert in the Ray district. In the summer time, however, the Kharrakan river never flowed beyond the boundaries of its own immediate district, its waters drying up in irrigation channels 2 . The city of Nihavand, lying about forty miles south of Hama dan, was an important place dating from Sassanian times. After the first Moslem conquest, which was effected by the troops from 1 I.

Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century speaks of the rich merchandise sold in its markets, whither the saffron of the neighbouring district of RMhravar was brought for distribution. Nihavand had then two Great Mosques, the old and the new. YaMt adds the tradition that many Arabs coming from Basrah had settled here in early days; and the city was famous for the manufacture of perfumes. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century States that in his day the population consisted mostly of the Kurdish tribesmen • much cotton was grown in the neighbouring districts, three of which in particular he names, Malair, Isfidhan, and Jahfik. About half-way between Hamadan and Nihavand lay the rich district of RMhravar, so famous for its saffron, of which district the chief city was Karaj, possessing a fine mosque. The district was three leagues across, and comprised 93 villages according to Yaklit. Mustawfi generally spells the name RMartid, and of its towns he mentions Sarkan and Tuvi, both of which still exist; and Tuvi, at the present day, is the name commonly given to the district 1 . To the eastward of Nihavand lay the district of the two Ighars (Al-Igharayn) of which the capital was also called Karaj, known for distinction as Karaj of Abu Dulaf. The exact site of this Karaj is unknown, but from the distances given in the Itineraries, and from the fact stated by Mustawfi that the town lay beneath the Rasmand mountains (almost certainly to be iden tified with the present range called Rasband), its site must be sought for near the head-waters of the stream which flows past Sartik to join the modern Kara Su. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century speaks of Karaj as smaller than Burujird, but it was a place of importance, built on a height. The houses of the town covered a space of over two leagues, and there were two markets, one at the Bab Masjid-al-Jami 4 , 'the gate of the Great Mosque,' the other situated at the opposite town gate opening 1 I. R. 166. I. H. 258,259,262. Muk. 393. Yak. ii. 832; iv. 251,827. Mst. 152, 153. The ruins of Karaj of Rudhravar are doubtless those described by De Morgan, Mission en Perse (li. 136), which he names Rudilavar.198 JIBAL. [CHAR beyond what was known as 'the great plain.' Baths were numerous and the houses were well built, mostly of clay bricks; the gardens were few, but those round the town limits were very fertile. Abu Dulaf, from whom the place took its distinguishing name, had been a celebrated general, also a poet at the court of Hartin-ar-Rashid and his son Mamtin. Abu Dulaf together with his descendants settled in this district, which with that lying round Burj, 12 leagues distant towards Isfahan, had been granted to them as Ighars—that is ' fiefs in perpetuity,' paying a fixed yearly tribute to the Caliph, but free of all other taxes. Yakut states that the Persians pronounced the name of Karaj Karah, and Farrazin was the name of a castle not far from the gate of Karaj. Mustawfi, who refers to the river as the River of Karah—the Karah RM—says that the Rasmand mountain here rose above the plain to the north. At the foot of the mountain was an abundant spring of water, called the fountain of King Kay-Khusraw, which irrigated the neighbouring pasture lands, six leagues long by three wide, known as the Margzar of Kith, which lay under the protection of the Parrazin castle. The Rasmand mountain is described as a black rock towering up like the hill of Bisutiln, with glens at its base, and it was ten leagues in circuit. The site of Burj, the second city of the Igharayn, has not yet been identified. Its position, however, is approximately known. Ibn Hawkal speaks of it as a fine well-conditioned town, and tells us that it lay on the high road towards Isfahan, some 12 leagues distant from Karaj 1 . Lower down the Karaj river, and to the north of Karaj of Abu Dulaf, is the town of Sanik of the Farahan district, noticed by Yakut and Mustawfi, being counted by them as belonging to Hamadan. Dawlatabad, which still exists, is mentioned as a prominent place of the neighbourhood; and there was a salt marsh near here, formed by a lake, measuring four leagues square, which when dried up by the summer heats produced excellent salt for export. This lake, according to Mustawfi, the Mongols named Jaghan Nailr, meaning 'Salt Lake.' It is doubtless I. H. 258, 262. Muk. 394. Yak. i. 420, 548; iii. 873; iv. 250, 270. Mst.

Lastly, to the south east of Hamadan, and about half-way between that city and Nihavand, lies the small town of Ramin, which is noticed by YaMt as of this district, but it is not further described by any other authority 1 . 1 Yak. iii. 867, 887; iv. 683. Mst. 151. At the present day the chief town of this district, now famous for its carpets, is Sultanabad, founded by Fath 'Ali Shah at the beginning of the nineteenth century; it is commonly known as Shahr-i-Naw (New Town).Little Lur.

The river Gavmaha. South of Hamadan lies Luristan, the district of the Lur tribes, kinsmen of the Kurds, and this mountainous region is divided by its rivers into two parts. Great Lur to the south and Little Lur to the north. The district of Little Lur is separated from Great Lur by the main stream of the Upper Kanin, and the towns of Great Lur will be more conveniently described in the chapter on Khuzistan, although the district of Great Lur also is by some authorities regarded as forming part of 'Irak 'Ajami. The chief towns of Little Lur, as enumerated by Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century, were Burfrjird, Khurramabad, and Shapilr- khwast. Burfrjird is described by Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century as a fine city, measuring over half a league across. Its fruits were exported to Karaj, much saffron was grown, and its importance increased after Hamtilah, the Wazir of the Abu Dulaf family just mentioned, built the Friday Mosque here. When Mustawfi wrote, in the 8th (14th) century, there were two mosques, the old and the new; but the town, he says, was then already falling to ruin. 4 All of Yazd, who always writes the name Vur£ljird, frequently refers to it in describing the campaigns of Timilr, by whose orders the castle, called the KaPah Armiyan, was restored 1 . 1 I. H. 258, 262. Yak. i. 596; ii. 737. Mst. 151. A. Y. i. 587; 515-chap. xiv] jibAl. 201 The name of Khurramabad, since the time of Timtir the most important place in Little Lur after Burtijird, does not occur in any of the Arab geographers of the middle-ages; and it has often been suggested that Khurramabad was identical with the town of Shaptirkhwast, a place frequently mentioned in earlier days. That this, however, is not the case, is proved by the mention, separately, of both towns by Mustawfi, who further indicates the position of Shaplirkhwast. Khurramabad, when Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (14th) century, was a fine town, though already partly in ruin. The date palm produced abundantly here, and he adds that this was the only place in the hill country where it grew, excepting Saymarah: but this statement cannot be accepted as quite exact. In regard to Shaplirkhwast, which the Arab geographers w T rote Sabtlrkhwast, this also had been a town famous for its dates since the time of Ibn Hawkal. In the 4th (10th) century Sabtirkhwast with Bunijird and Nihavand came under the power of Hasanawayh, the Kurdish chief who had established his government at Dinavar (see above, p. 189), and at Dizbaz, the castle of Sabiirkhwast, which rivalled Sarmaj for strength, Badr, son of Hasanawayh, kept his treasures, which in 414 (1023) fell into the hands of the Buyids. During the 5th (nth) century Sabtirkhwast is frequently mentioned in the chronicles relating to the doings of the Salj6ks, and in 499 (1106) the Atabeg Manktlbars came into possession of the city, together with Nihavand and Lishtar (Alishtar). Writing in the early part of the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi (in the GuztdaJi) gives the information that in his day there were, in Little Lur, three populous cities, namely Burfrjird, Khurramabad, and Shaptirkhwast (as he spells it in Persian). He relates that, 'this last, though once a great city, and very populous, being full of people of various nations and the capital of the kingdom, is now reduced to become a provincial town'; and in regard to its position he states that beyond (south) of Burtijird, 'the road (coming from Nihavand and going to Isfahan) branches to the right to Shapurkhwast,' while to the left (eastward) the main road went on to Karaj of Abu Dulaf. These details are in accordance with the accounts given by Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi; for the former states that from Nihavand it was 10 leagues (south) to Lashtar, and thence 12 on to Sabtir-202 JIBAL. I CHAP. khwast, from which it was counted 30 leagues to (Great) Lur— that is to say the plains lying north of Dizful which will be noticed later in Chapter XVI. Mukaddasi adds that from SaMr- khwast to Karaj of Abu Dulaf was four marches, it being the same from Saburkhwast to Lur 1 . To the west of Little Lur, and on the frontier of Arabian 'Irak, lay the two districts of Masabadhan and Mihrajankudhak, of which the chief towns were, respectively, Sirawan and Saymarah. The ruins of both towns still exist, and Masabadhan is in use as the name of the region to the south of the Mayidasht plain. Sirawan (or As-Sirawan) was, according to Ibn Hawkal, a small town, its houses built of mortared stone, not unlike Mosul. It produced the fruits of both hot and cold regions, especially nuts and melons, the latter of the celebrated kind known as Dastabilyah; moreover the date palm, as already said, flourished here. Kazvini refers to mines of salt, sulphur, vitriol, and borax as being found in the Masabadhan district. Situated some fifty miles to the eastward, Saymarah was not unlike Sirawan, and it remained a populous town to a later date than the latter, its position being better chosen. The Mihrajankudhak district lying round it was celebrated in the 4th (10th) century for great fertility; and Mukaddasi refers to its numerous population. &lt; Dates and olives, nuts and snow are all found here abundantly,' YakM writes, and on the road between Saymarah and the neighbouring hamlet of Tarhan was a wonderful bridge, f twice as great as the bridge between Hulwan and Khanikin.' When Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (14th) century Saymarah, though already falling to ruin, was still a fine town, and the surrounding country was celebrated for its date-groves 2 . At the south-eastern corner of the Jibal province, and not far distant from the borders of the Great Desert, stands Isfahan (the I. H. 259, 264. Muk. 401. Yak. li. 572; iii. 4,82, 225.

At the present day Isfahan and its suburbs occupy both banks of the river, but in the middle-ages the inhabited quarters lay only on the northern or left bank of the Zayindah Rud. Here there were two cities side by side; namely, to the east Jay, otherwise called Shahristanah girt by a wall with a hundred towers; and two miles to the west ward of this Al-Yahudiyah, ' the Jew Town,' double the size of Jay, taking its name, so tradition asserted, from the Jews who had been settled here in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. Ibn Rustah, at the close of the 3rd (9th) century, describes the city of Jay as measuring half a league across, and covering an area of 2000 Jaribs (about 600 acres). There were four gates, Bab Khawr or ' of the Creek,' otherwise Bab Zarin Rud, for this was the earlier spelling of the name of the river; then Bab Asfij, Bab Tirah, and the Yahudiyah Gate. Ibn Rustah enumerates the number of towers on the wall between each gate, and he also gives the space in ells. In Jay was an ancient building like a fortress called Sarftk, the name likewise of the Ramadan citadel, as above stated, which Ibn Rustah says dated from before the Flood. Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi in the next century describe both Jay and Yahudiyah. In each city was a Great Mosque for the Friday prayers; and Yahudiyah alone equalled Hamadan in size, being indeed the largest city in the JiMl province, Ray only possibly excepted. Isfahan was already a great commercial centre, and its silks, especially the 'Attabi (tabby stuffs), and its cottons, were largely exported. Saffron and all kinds of fruit grew well in its districts, which were the broadest and richest of the whole Jibal. Al-Yahudiyah, according to Mukaddasi, had been originally settled by the Jews in the time of Nebuchadnezzar because its climate resembled that of Jerusalem. The town, which he reports had twelve gates was built mostly of unburnt brick, and it had both open and covered markets. The 1 Shahristan, or Shahristanah, means, in Persian, 'the Township,' and is a common name for the capital city.■EE* 204 JIBAL. [CHAP. Great Mosque was in one of the markets, built with round columns, having a minaret on the Kiblah (Mecca) side, 70 ells in height. The neighbouring township of Jay, a couple of miles to the eastward, was according to Mukaddasi called Al-Madinah, 4 the City,' the Arabic equivalent of Shahristanah, and imme diately below its ancient fortress, in the 4th (10th) century, the river was crossed by a bridge of boats. In 444 (1052) Isfahan was visited by the Persian traveller Nasir-i-Khusraw, who describes it as the largest city in all Persian-speaking lands that he had seen. There were two hundred bankers, and fifty caravanserais; and the town was surrounded by a wall said to be three and a half leagues in circuit, with battlements and a gangway running along the summit. The Great Mosque was a magnificent building, and the money-changers' market a sight to be seen, and each of the other numerous markets was shut off by its own gate. When YaMt wrote, in the beginning of the 7th (13th) century, both YahMiyah and Jay had fallen to ruin; and of the two the latter was then the more populous. He further speaks of the Great Mosque in Jay built by the Caliph Manser Rashid, who, as the chronicles relate, having been deposed by his uncle Muhammad Muktafi in 530 ( ii 3^) j was afterwards killed in battle and brought to be buried outside the gate of Isfahan. Yahudiyah, however, after the Mongol invasion, recovered a part of its former glory, and was a populous thriving city when Abu-l-Fida wrote in 721 (1321), having, he says, the suburb of Shahristan a mile distant to the eastward, which occupied part of the older site of Jay. His contemporary, Mustawfi, gives us a long account of Isfahan and its districts, mentioning the names of many places that still exist ; and his description proves that Yahtidiyah of medieval times is the city of Isfahan as described by Chardin at the close of the 17 th century, when it had become the capital of Persia under Shah ^bbas, the past glories of which are to be seen at the present day. According to Mustawfi the city walls, 21,000 paces in circuit, dated from the 4th (10th) century, having been built by 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid. The area of Isfahan had formerly been occupied by four villages, whose names survived in the town quarters, namely, Karran (the Karran Gate is given byXIV] JIBAL. 205 Chardin as opening on the east side), Kushk, Jtibarah (this was the eastern quarter when Chardin wrote, and the Jiibarah Gate was to the north-east), and Dardasht (the gate of this name lay to the north, and the Dardasht quarter was to the north-west). Mustawfi writes that the most populous quarter under the Saljtiks had been that known as Julbarah (the Gulbar quarter of Chardin, round the present Maydan-i-Kuhnah or 4 Old Square'), where stood the College and Tomb of Sultan Muhammad the Saljiik, and here might be seen a block of stone weighing 10,000 mans (equivalent, perhaps, to a little less than 32 tons weight), this being a great idol, carried off by the Sultan from India, and set up before the college gate 1 . When Timtir conquered Isfahan at the close of the 8th (14th) century, the name of the citadel which he occupied is given as KaPah Tabarik (the latter word meaning a 'hillock' in the Persian dialect), and the ruins of this castle, which still exist, are described by Chardin as standing outside the Dardasht Gate. Further we are informed that Malik Shah the Saljuk erected another strong castle—the Shah-Diz, 'the Royal Fort'—on the summit of a mountain close to Isfahan in the year 500 (1107), and Kazvini adds a long anecdote relating the circumstances that brought about its foundation. At the beginning of the 10th (16th) century, Persia came under the rule of Shah Ismail the Safavid, and at the close of the century Shah 'Abbas the Great transferred his capital from Ardabil to Isfahan, whither he also removed the whole Armenian population of Julfah on the river Aras, settling them in a new quarter of the city which he founded on the southern or right bank of the Zayindah Rtid. Shah 'Abbas also added other new quarters and suburbs to Isfahan, but north of the river, all of which are minutely described by Chardin, who lived at Isfahan for many years during the latter half of the 17th century a.d. 2 1 History, however, does not record that this Sultan Muhammad—he reigned from 498 to 511 (1104— an&lt; ^ was a son 0 f Malik Shah—made any conquests in India ; possibly Mustawfi has mistaken him for Mahmud of Ghaznah. 2 I.

Y.The eight districts round Isfahan, which Mustawfi carefully enumerates with their villages, still exist, and the same names appear in Ya'kubi and other early authorities of the 3rd and 4th (9th and roth) centuries. Four of these districts lie to the north of the river, while the other four are on its right bank to the southward. Beginning with the north bank, the home district, that immediately round the city, was called Jay, the name of the older town to the eastward. The Marbin district was to the west of Isfahan, and here stood an ancient fire-temple built by the mythical king Tahmurath, surnamed Div Band, 'the demon binder.' To the north-west, at some distance from the city gates, lay the Burkhwar district, of which Jaz (modern Gaz) was the largest village; while to the north-east was the district called Kahab, the fourth on the northern river bank. South of the Zayindah Rtid, and to the south-east of the old Shahristanah city, was the district of Baraan, with the Riidasht district beyond it lying further down the river, of which last the chief centre was Farifan, a large town in the 8th (r4th) century, though now only a village, standing near the great Gav-Khanah swamp. The Kararij district is south of Baraan; and westward of this, higher up the right bank of the Zayindah Rud, is the great Khanlanjan district, the last of the four to the south of the river, of which the chief town was Firfizan. Of this city no trace apparently remains, but it was a considerable town 'in two parts' in the 8th (14th) century, situated on the Zayindah Rud, and Ibn Batutah, who passed through it, says it lay six leagues distant from Isfahan. The Khanlanjan district was already famous in the 4th (10th) century for its plentiful fruits and the fertility of its lands. Its name is often written Khalanjan or Khulanjan, and it was also known as Khan- al-Abrar, ' the Caravanserai of the Benefactors.' As the name of a town Khanlanjan is doubtless identical with Firuzan aforesaid, and in the Itineraries this is the first stage southward from Isfahan on the western road to Shiraz.

For modern Isfahan see Houtum-Schindler, Eastern 'Irak (1897), pp. 18, 19, 120,XIV] JIBAL. i-Khusraw passed through Khanlanjan on his way to Isfahan, and noticed on the city gate an inscription bearing the name of Tughril Beg the Saljuk 1 . The main stream of the Isfahan river, at the present time generally called the Zandah Rud, is known as the Zayindah Rud or the Zarin-Rudh to our various authorities, though this last name is now generally given to a tributary river. The main stream, in its upper reach, was named the Jiiy-Sard, 'the Cold River,' and this rose in the Zardah-Kub, ' the Yellow Mountains' —still so called from their yellow limestone cliffs—30 leagues west of Isfahan, not far from the head-waters of the Dujayl or Karun river of Khuzistan ; and here, according to Mustawfi, were also the Ashkahran mountains, which marked the frontiers of Great Lur. Below the town of Firuzan in Khanlanjan, the Zandah RM receives an affluent, almost equal to its main stream in volume, which comes down from near Gulpaygan (Jurbadhakan); then after passing Isfahan, and irrigating its eight districts, the Zandah Rud somewhat to the eastward of Rudasht flows finally into the swamp of Gav-Khanah on the borders of the Great Desert. According to popular belief, which is mentioned already by Ibn Khurdadbih in the 3rd (9th) century, the river, after sinking into this swamp, rose again to the ground surface 90 leagues away in Kirman, thence reaching the sea; but Mustawfi not unnaturally discredits the story, because of the high mountains lying between Isfahan and Kirman, and though he states that it was said that bits of reeds thrown into the Gav- Khanah marsh reappeared in Kirman, he adds ' but this account is incredible 2 .' Nayin, which lay to the north of the Gav-Khanah swamp on the border of the Great Desert, and the towns to the south-east ' 1 I. K. 20, 58. I. R. 152.. Kud. 197. I. H. 201. Ykb. 275. Muk. 389, 458.

An account of his reception by the governor of Khanlanjan is given in a copy of the ShAh Ndmah preserved in the British Museum (Or. 1403, f. 518 a), of which the text and translation are given by C. Schefer in his edition of Nasir-i-Khusraw (Appendix iv. p. 298). 2 I. R. 152. I. K. 20. Mst. 201, 202, 214.2o8 jibAL. [chap. of it towards Yazd, were all included in the province of Fars during the middle-ages, as will be explained in Chapter XVIII, but Ardistan, some miles north-west of Nayin, was counted as of the Jibal province. As early as the 4th (xoth) century, Istakhri describes Ardistan as a walled city, a mile across, with five gates and well fortified. The Friday Mosque stood in the centre of the town, and much silk was manufactured here, chiefly for export. At Zuvarah, to the north-east of Ardistan, some ancient ruins were attributed to King Anushirwan the Just, and Mukaddasi adds that the soil of Ardistan was white, 'like wheat flour, whence its name,' for Ard in Persian meaning 'meal,' Ardistan would have the signification of ' the place like flour.' The ruins are referred to under the name of Uzvarah by Yakut, who states that there were many vaulted buildings, also the remains of a fire-temple that had become the castle of Ardistan, and here according to tradition Antishirwan had been born. Mustawfi however, who spells the name Zuvarah, attributes all these remains, including the fire- temple, to King Bahman, son of Isfandiyar; and records that the town, which stood close to the desert, had round it 30 v illa ge giving as a tradition that these had been built by Dastan, brother of the hero Rustam. On the desert border between Ardistan and Kashan were the Kargas Kuh, 'the Vulture Hills,' which Mukaddasi describes as the highest mountains in the Great Desert of Persia. The neigh bouring Siyah Kfih, 'Black Hills,' were of almost equal height and ruggedness :—'black evil-looking mountains'; and both, says Istakhri, were famous hiding-places for robbers. In a valley of the Vulture Hills was a fine spring called the Ab -i-Bandah, which gushed out from a cleft that was completely enclosed by rocks. About half-way between the Kargas Kilh and the Siyah Kuh on the desert road, stood the caravanserai called Dayr al-Jiss, 'Gypsum Convent,' a strong place, built entirely of burnt brick and shut by iron gates. In this hostel, according to Istakhri, guides for the desert routes were to be found, stationed here by order of the Sultan. Further, great tanks had been constructed here for storing water, which Mukaddasi relates were never allowed to go out of repair, and there were shops in the caravanserai for the sale of provisions. Mustawfi describes the Kargas Kuh asXIV] JIBAL. 209 standing solitary, being joined to no other range, and some ten leagues in circuit. In their rocky heights the vultures nested, and the ibex {waH\ that could live long without water, was found here in great numbers. To the west of Ardistan is the town of Natanz, or Natanzah, which appears to be mentioned by no Arab geographer before the time of YaMt. Mustawfi states that its castle was called Washak, after one who was governor of Natanz, though originally this castle had borne the name of Kamart. Close to Natanz also was the large village of Tark, almost a town says YaMt, and here according to Kazvim the people were celebrated for their skill in carving bowls out of ivory and ebony; these being largely exported 1 . The city of Kashan is mentioned by Istakhri c as a pleasant town, clay built, like Kum.' The earlier Arab geographers always spell the name Kashan (with the dotted k). The place became famous throughout the east for its tile-work, which took the name Kashi (for Kashani), this being still the common term for the well-known enamelled blue and green tiles so much used in mosque decoration. According to Mukaddasi Kashan was the reverse of famous for its scorpions; and Yaklit, who refers to the beautiful green bowls of Kashi-ware which were in his day largely exported, speaks of the population as all fanatical Shi'ahs of the Imamite sect. Mustawfi asserts that Kashan had originally been built by Zubaydah, the wife of Hartin-ar-Rashid; and he praises the palace of Fin, lying near Kashan, for its tanks and water courses, which were supplied by the river from KuhrM. The Kashan river, which in summer went dry before reaching the town limits, in spring often endangered the city with its floods, which passing on were lost in the neighbouring desert. The city of Kum (more correctly spelt Kumm according to Arab orthography), to the north of Kashan, is now famous among the Shi'ahs for its shrine, said to mark the tomb of Fatimah, sister of the sixth Imam 'Ali-ar-Rida, a contemporary of Hariin-ar-Rashid, whom they assert to have died here of poison on her way to join her brother in Khurasan. Already in the 4th (10th) century Ibn Hawkal describes Kum as peopled by Shi'ahs; it was then a 1 1st. 202, 228, 230, 231. I. H. 288—291. Muk. 390, 490, 491. Yak. i. 198; iii. 531; iv. 793.

The ancient name of Kum according to Yakut had been Kumandan, curtailed by the Arabs to Kumm. The remains of a Persian fortress were, he says, still to be seen among the ruins of the town, and an ancient stone bridge crossed the river which separated the older site from the Moslem town. Mustawfi states that the walls of Kum measured 10,000 paces in circuit, and, like Avah, the place was celebrated for its numerous ice-houses excavated in the ground ; also for its cypress trees, and for vines which produced the famous red grapes. When Mustawfi wrote in the 8th (r4th) century most part of Kum lay in ruins, and it is to be remarked that neither he nor any earlier authorities make any mention of the tomb of Fatimah, although the city is always noted as being a centre of the Shi'ah sect 1 . The river of Kum rose in the Gulpaygan district near the mountains of Khansar, as Mustawfi writes the name, and these ranges are the watershed between the Kum river and the left- bank tributary of the Isfahan river already mentioned. Jurbadh- akan is the Arab name for Gulpaygan, of which the older form was Gurbayigan, and Mustawfi explains the name to mean 'the place of roses,' writing it Gul-abad-ikan and goes on to praise its fertility and the excellent water, 50 villages being of its depend encies. Mukaddasi refers to Jurbadhakan as lying about half-way between Karaj of Abu Dulaf and Isfahan, and the village of Khan sar which gave its name to the district, Yakto adds, was of its neighbourhood. The town of Dalijan lies further down the Kum river; and according to Yakut the name was pronounced Dulayjan or Dulaygan. Formerly it had been a flourishing place, but when Mustawfi wrote it had fallen to ruin. After passing the city of Kum, the Kum river joined the waters of the great stream coming down from Hamadan, called the river Gavmaha, or Gavmasa, which itself a short distance above Kum had received on its right bank the Avah river, and on its left bank the river passing Savah. All these streams branched to form many water channels, and intermingling by cross canals finally became lost in the Great Desert to the north-east of Kum. 1 1st. 201. I. H. 264. Muk. 390. Yak. iv. 15, 175. Mst. 150, 217. J- N. 305.Pt, XIV] JIBAL. 211 The town of Avah (called Avah of Savah to distinguish it from Avah near Hamadan, see p. 196) lay a short distance to the west of Kum. The Avah river took its rise in Tafrish, which Mustawfi describes as a district ' that on all sides was only approached by passes,' and the country here was very fertile, with many villages. The town of Avah is mentioned by Mukaddasi, who names it Ava or Avah of Ray; and YaMt, who speaks of it as a village or a small town, writes the name Abah, adding that its population were ardent Shi'ahs. In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi describes Avah as enclosed by a wall a thousand paces in circuit, and there were pits for storing ice, which were famous, for ice was much in demand during the summer heats; but the bread here was very bad. Between Avah and Kum, he describes an isolated hill, called Kiih Namak Lawn (Salt Mountain), where the earth was everywhere mixed with salt. To reach the summit was impossible on account of the friable nature of the ground; no snow either would remain on its sides, and the salt was too bitter to be used by man. This hill was three leagues in circuit, and so high as to be visible at a distance of 10 leagues 1 . The city of Savah, lying midway between Hamadan and Ray on the great caravan road which traversed Persia (the Khurasan road), was a place of importance as early as the 4th (10th) century, when Ibn Hawkal describes it as noted for its camels and camel- drivers, both much in demand throughout the land by pilgrims and travellers. Mukaddasi adds that the town was fortified, that there were fine baths here, and that the Friday Mosque stood near the high road, and at some distance from the market- The people of Savah were Sunnis, and Yakflt writes that in his day they were perpetually at feud with their neighbours of Avah, who were Shi'ahs. Savah suffered severely at the hands of the Mongols in 617 (1220), who plundered the town, slaying most of its inhabit ants; and among other buildings burning the great library, which Yaktit had seen, and describes as having had no equal throughout all Persian Trak. This library is also referred to by Kazvlni, who says it was housed in the Great Mosque, and contained, besides books on all subjects, a set of astrolabes and globes for the study 1 1st. 195, 198. Muk. 25, 51, 257, 386, 402. Yak. i. 57; ii. 46, 392, 584. Mst. 147, 150, 206, 216. T4 2of astronomy. In the town was a hospital, as well as many colleges and caravanserais; and at the gate of the mosque was a mighty arch, recalling the arch of the Chosroes at Madain. In Moslem legend Savah was famous for the great lake which had been here before the days of Islam, and which had suddenly dried up on the night of the birth of the prophet Muhammad; { the water sinking down into the earth in joy at the good news/ as Mustawfi writes. He adds that in his day the walls of Savah had been recently rebuilt of burnt brick, being then 6200 ells in circuit. Four leagues to the west of Savah was the shrine of the prophet Samuel, and when Mustawfi wrote the population of the town had nearly all become Shi'ahs. He mentions the names of. many of the surrounding villages, and adds that corn, cotton, and pomegranates were grown abundantly throughout the district. The Savah river was called the Muzdakan, from a town of this name which stood on its banks. This stream rose at Saman, a large village on the border of the Kharrakan district of Hamadan (see p. 196), lying in a rich country producing corn and grapes. From Saman the river came to Muzdakan (also spelt Musdakan), a town which Mustawfi describes as 3000 paces in circuit, with a cold climate, being in the hill country. Yaktit speaks of a celebrated Rubat—guard-house or monastery—at Muzdakan, where many Siifis had their abode; and the town was a stage on the great caravan road crossing Persia. After passing through Savah, Mustawfi tells us, the Muzdakan river divided, part of its waters sinking underground into a great pit, while a moiety joined the Gavmaha. The long river called the Gavmaha (or Gavmasa as some mss. write the name), which Mustawfi carefully describes for us, is now known as the Kara Sft—Black Water—along a part of its course. It had its head-waters, as already said, in the Hamadan plain, where divers streams came down from Asadabad, the Alvand mountain, and the Farivar district. Flowing first northward and then bending sharply to the east, it received from the south a great affluent, the river rising near Karaj of Abu Dulaf. Beyond Savah and Avah, where it received the two other affluents we have previously described, a great dam was built across the river to retain its waters for irrigation purposes during the summerxiv] jibAl. 213 droughts. The Gavmaha eventually mingled its stream with the river of Kum coming from Gulpaygan, and Mustawfi adds that their surplus waters after passing a place called Haftad Pulan, ^ Eighty Bridges,' finally escaped and were lost in the Great Desert. The Gavmaha river was to its district, says Mustawfi, what the Zandah RM was to Isfahan, being the chief fountain of its riches and prosperity. It is to be remarked that none of the earlier Arab geographers make mention of this river 1 . 1 I. H. 258. Muk. 392. Yak. iii. 24; iv. 520. Kaz. ii. 258. Mst. 148, 149, 152, 217. The dam on the Gavmaha was built by Shams-ad-Din, prime minister (Sahib-Divan) of Sultan Ahmad, son of Hulagu, the third II-Khan of Persia.CHAPTER XV. A JIBAL {continued). Ray. Varamm and Tihran.

At the north-eastern corner of the Jibal province stood Ray, more correctly spelt Rayy, which the Arab geographers always write with the article Ar-Rayy, the name representing the Greek Rhages. In the 4th (10th) century Ray appears to have been the chief of the four capital cities of the Jibal province; 'except for Baghdad, indeed, it is the finest city of the whole east,' Ibn Hawkal writes, 'though Naysablir in Khurasan is more spacious/ and Ray covered at that time an area of a league and a half square. Officially, during the Abbasid Caliphate, Ray was known as Muhammadlyah, in honour of Muhammad, afterwards the Caliph Mahdt, who had lived here during the reign of his father Mansfir, and had rebuilt much of the city. His son Harun-ar- Rashid was born here, and under its official title of Muham- madiyah it became the chief mint city of the province, this name occurring on many of the Abbasid coins. In Ray the houses were mostly built of clay, but burnt bricks were also largely used. The town was strongly fortified, and Ibn Hawkal mentions five gates; the gate of the Batak Arch opening (S.W.) on the Baghdad road, Bab Balisan (N.W.) towards Kazvin, Bab Kuhak (N.E.) towards Tabaristan, Bab Hisham (E.) on the Khurasan road, and Bab Sin (S.) towards Kum. TheCHAP. XV] JIBAL. 2T5 markets of the city lay at, and outside, these gates, and the most frequented were in the suburbs of Sarbanan and Ar-RMhah, where shops, and warehouses filled with merchandise, extended along both sides of the main thoroughfare for a great distance. Two rivers, according to Ibn Hawkal, brought water to Ray, one called Stirkana running past the Rudhah suburb; and the other, the river Al-Jilam, flowing through Sarbanan. Yakut also mentions the Nahr Mtisa (River of Mtlsa), coming down from the mountains of Daylam, which may therefore be identical with the Jilani or Gilan river, aforesaid. Mukaddasi refers to two great buildings in Ray, one the Dar-al-Battikh, 4 the water-melon house/ a name commonly given to the city fruit-market, the other the Dar-al- Kuttub, or library, lying below Rudhah in a khan (caravanserai), where, however, there were not many books, according to his account. In the 4th (10th) century both Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi speak of Ray as already much gone to ruin, the chief traffic then being in the suburbs of the older town. High above the Great Mosque, which Yakut states was built by the Caliph Mahdi and finished in 158 (775), was the castle, which stood on the summit of a steep hill, of which Ibn Rustah writes that 4 from its top you overlook all the roofs of Ray.' The account of Ray given in Yakut is not very clear, but he quotes, in one part of his work, an old topographical description of the town, which is to the following effect. The Inner City, where the mosque and the Government House stood, was the quarter surrounded by a ditch, and this was generally known as Al-Madinah, ' the City' proper. The Outer City was that part more especially known as Al-Muhammadiyah, which at first had been a fortified suburb. It crowned the summit of the hill overlooking the lower (or inner) town, and according to the information quoted by Yakut its castle was known as Az-Zubaydiyah (some mss. give the name as Az-Zaybandi), which had been the palace of Prince Mahdi when he was quartered in Ray. Afterwards this became the prison, and it was rebuilt in 278 (891). Further, there was another castle in Ray called the Kal'ah-al-Farrukhan, also known as Al-Jawsak, 'the Kiosque,'* and during the 4th (10th) century Fakhr-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, who disliked the old palace on the hill-top, built himself a great216 jibAl. [chap. house in the midst of gardens, which was afterwards known as Fakhrabad The most celebrated in early days of the many fertile districts round Ray were the following:—Rudhah (or Ar-Rudhah). with a large village of the same name beyond the city suburb Varamin, which afterwards took the place of Ray as the chief city of this part of the Jibal province; Pashaviyah, still existing under the form Fashaviyah; lastly, Kusin and Dizah, with the districts of Al- Kasrin, 'the Two Palaces'—the outer and the inner—Dizah being the name of two large villages or towns lying one day's journey from Ray, to wit, Dizah of Kasran, and Dizah of Varamin. All these hamlets according to Ibn Hawkal, with some others that he names, were like small towns, each with a population of over 10,000 men. In the year 617 (1220) Ray was taken, plundered, and burnt by the Mongol hordes, and from this great calamity it never recovered. Yakut, who passed through the place at this time, states that the city walls alone remained intact, most of the houses being reduced to ruin. Many of these had originally been built of burnt brick, faced with blue enamelled tiles, which Yakut describes as 'varnished smooth like the surface of a bowl.' The Shaft'ite suburb, the smallest of the city quarters, alone had escaped the Mongols, the quarters of the Hanbalites and of the Shl'ahs having been completely ruined 2 . From its state of utter ruin Ghazan Khan the Mongol, by imperial decree, according to Mustawfi, attempted to restore Ray, ordering the city to be rebuilt and repeopled. The attempt, how ever, failed, for the population had already shifted to the neighbour ing towns of Varamin and Tihran, more especially the former, which, having a better climate than the older Ray, had become at the beginning of the 8th (14th) century the most flourishing city of the district. The ruins of Varamin lie at some distance to the south of Ray, while to the north of the city, Mustawfi says, was the hill of labarik—presumably not that on which the castle 1 Ykb. 275. I. R. 168. I.

Whether or not the fortress of Ray built by Mahdi was called Zubaydiyah (if this indeed be the true reading) after the future wife of his son Harun-ar- Rashid is not clear. 2 I. H. 270, 289. Yak. ii. 572, 833, 893, 894.XV] jibAl. 217 already mentioned as built by the Caliph Mahdi had stood— where a silver mine was worked at much profit to the state. This castle of Tabarik, according to the chronicle of Zahir-ad-Din, was founded by Manuchahr the Ziyarid at the beginning of the 5th (nth) century. Yakut states that it was destroyed in 588 (1192) by Tughril II, the last Saljilk Sultan of 'Irak, and a long account is given of the siege of this famous stronghold. The Tabarik hill, he adds, lay on the right of the Khurasan road to a traveller leaving Ray, while the Hill of Ray (presumably the site of the castle built by Mahdi) lay to the left of one leaving the city gate. Mustawfi describes the shrine of the Imam Zadah 'Abd-al-'Azim as situated close to Ray, and this Mashhad, or place of martyrdom, is still the most venerated sanctuary of modern Tehran; the saint being a certain Husayn, son of 'Ali-ar-Rida, the eighth Imam. One of the famous districts near Ray was called Shahriyar, and Mustawfi incidentally mentions a castle (Kal'ah) of this name as lying to the north of the city. In later times this castle must have become important, for Shahriyar or Ray-Shahriyar is the name which 'All of Yazd, when describing the campaigns of Timur, gives to Ray. Varamin, as already said, was then the chief centre of population, but this town in the beginning of the 9th (15th) century was itself already falling to ruin. At a later time its place was taken by I'ihran, which in the 7 th (13th) century is merely mentioned as one of the largest villages of Ray. The early Tihran (also spelt Tihran with the soft had many half-underground houses, 'like Jerboa holes' according to Kazvini, and the people of its twelve wards were always fighting, each ward against the other. Mustawfi in the next century describes Tihran as a medium-sized town; but it was not till long after, namely at the close of the 12th (18th) century, that the city was made the capital of Persia by Aka Muhammad Shah, founder of the Kajar dynasty 1 . The rivers that water the plain in which Ray, Varamin, and Tihran stand, flow thence to the neighbouring border of the Great 1 Kaz. ii. 228, 250. Mst. 143, 144, 205. Yak. iii. 507, 564. A.

Zahir-ad-Dtn (Dorn, Muhammadanische Quellen, i. p. 15 ot the Persian text) states that Tabarik means 'a hillock,' being the diminutive of Tahar which signifies ' a hill or mountain ' in the Tabaristan dialect.

One of the chief streams was the Nahr Mtlsa already mentioned, along whose bank lay many villages; further, Mustawfi speaks of the river Karaj, which was crossed by a bridge of a single arch known as the Pul-i-Khatun, ' the Lady's Bridge,' and so called, it was said, in memory of the lady Zubaydah, wife of Harun-ar-Rashid. The ruins of this bridge still exist not far from Tihran. KazvM also mentions the Nahr Surin, whose waters were carefully avoided by the Shi'ah population of Ray, because the body of the murdered Yahya, grandson of 'Alt Zayn-al-'Abidin the fourth Imam, had been washed in it, and thus polluted the stream for evermore. The chief river of Ray, how ever, according to Mustawfi, was the Jayij Rud, which, rising in the Jayij range under Damavand, divided into forty channels on reaching the plain of Ray. On the western border of this plain lies the district of Sauj Bulagh—meaning 'Cold Springs' in the Turkish dialect—which is described by Mustawfi as having been an important place under the Saljuks. In the time of the Mongols it paid revenues to the amount of 12,000 dinars, and the chief among its numerous villages was Sunkurabad (which still exists), an important stage on the itinerary given by Mustawfi. Sauj Bulagh district was watered by the Garm RM, which, rising in the mountains to the east of Kazvin, irrigated the districts of Ray and Shahriyar, where it was joined by many streams from the mountain range to the north before such of its waters as were not used up in irrigation channels were absorbed by the Great Desert 1 . Kazvin (otherwise Kazwin) lies about a hundred miles north west of Tihran, immediately below the great mountain chain, and from the earliest times was an important place, guarding the passes that led across the T- abaristan province to the shores of the Caspian. The mountain region to the north-west had in early times formed part of the district of Daylam (already described in Chapter XII) which for a time was semi-independent, not having been brought under the government of the Abbasids. During this period Kazvin was the chief fortress against these fierce infidels, and was strongly garrisoned by Moslem troops. Already in the times of the Kaz. i. 181.

This Muhammad had halted at Kazvin, and built here the first Friday Mosque, which Yakut describes as standing near the gate of the palace of the Bam Junayd. It was called the Masjid-ath-Thawr, 'the Bull Mosque,' and was the chief mosque of the city till the days of Harun-ar-Rashid. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (1 oth) century describes Kazvin as consisting of a . double city, one without, the other within, and there were two Friday Mosques in the central town, which was like a fortress. Its lands were very fertile, and the houses of the city covered an area of a square mile. The people were brave and warlike, and it was from this city that the Abbasid Caliphs were wont to despatch punitive expeditions into Talikan and Daylam. The two chief rivers of Kazvin, according to Ya'kubi, were the Wadl-al-Kabir (the Great Stream), and the Wadi Sayram. There were the remains of many fire-temples in this neighbour hood, and Mukaddasi praises the grapes grown in the gardens round the place. Of the double town the two quarters were called the Madinah Musa and the Madmah Mubarak, otherwise the Mubarakiyah. The Caliph Hadi (elder brother of Harun-ar- Rashid), whose name was Musa, had built here the town quarter named after him, Madinah Musa. This was during the Caliphate of his father Mahdi; and afterwards Harun-ar-Rashid (who suc ceeded Hadi) on his way to Khurasan had halted in Kazvin, where he laid the foundations of the new mosque and built the city walls. Mubarak the Turk, a freedman either of the Caliph Mamun or of Mu'tasim, was the builder of the Mubarakiyah fortress at Mubarakabad, otherwise called the city of Mubarak. Throughout the middle-ages Kazvin continued to be a flourishing town^ but at the beginning of the 7th (13th) century it was laid in ruins by the Mongols. A hundred years later, Mustawfi, who was himself a native of Kazvin, gives a long account of the place, derived in part from local traditions. He states that on the site of later Kazvin there had stood an ancient Persian city, built by King Shapur and called Shad Shapur—' the Joy of Sapor.' Near its ruins the two Moslem cities of Madinah220 JIBAL. [CHAP. Miisa and Mubarakabad (Mubarak, he says, was a freedman of the Caliph Hadi) were subsequently built, and Hariln-ar-Rashid surrounded all three towns by a great fortified wall. This wall was only completed in 254 (868) by the Turk commander Milsa ibn Bugha in the reign of the Caliph Mu c tazz; and it was afterwards rebuilt in burnt brick by Sadr-ad-Din, the Wazir of the Saljtik Sultan Arslan II, in 572 (1176). Mustawfi further states that 300 villages were of the dependencies of Kazvin, and of these the most important were Farisjin and Sagsabad, both mentioned in his itinerary. He also names a number of streams which irrigated the Kazvin territory, namely the Kharftd, with the Buh RM and Kardan RM both flowing from Talikan, and the Turkan RM coming from the Kharrakan district (see p. 196). According to Kazvini the streams that watered the gardens of the city were the Daraj river on the east, and the Atrak river on the west; and the same author also names a number of towns and villages that were situated in the plain, and in the hill country overlooking Kazvin 1 . Dastuva (or Dastaba) under the Omayyads holds the position of a mint city, and is the name of a great district, of which Yazdabad was the chief village. In Omayyad times Dastuva had belonged in part to Ray, in part to Hamadan, and we are told that the direct post-road from Ray to the Adharbayjan province lay through it, avoiding Kazvin. The name is no longer found on the map, but Dastaba must have been to the south of Kazvin, of which city in later days, under the Abbasid Caliphs, it came to be counted as a dependency. To the north-west of Kazvin, on the summits of the mountains dividing this district from that of RMbar, which lay along the 1 I. H. 259, 263, 271. Ykb. 271. I. K. 57. Muk. 391.

As his name implies, Kazvim (like Mustawfi) was a native of Kazvin, and Mustawfi in his history (the Guzidak) has left a long account of his birth-place, which M. Barbier de Meynard has translated in the Journal Asiaiique for 1857, ii. p. 257. Kazvini (ii. 291) gives a rough ground plan of the town, which is figured in concentric circles of walls. The inner circle was the Shahristan, and this was surrounded by the great city (Al-Madinah-al-'Uzma), which in turn was enclosed by gardens, depicted as encircled by arable fields; the latter traversed by the two rivers.XV] JIBAL. 221 river Shah RM in Tabaristan, stood the famous castles of the Assassins (Ismailians), fifty in total number Mustawfi says, of which Alamiit was the capital and Maymlin Diz the strongest fortress. The name Alamtit is said to mean c the eagle's nest ? or 'the eagle's find' in the Tabaristan dialect, and the first to build a castle here was a Daylamite king whose hunting eagle had by chance once perched on the crag. Kazvini, who doubtless knew the place well, describes the castle as surrounded by deep and wide ravines, cutting it off from all communication with the neighbouring mountain spurs, and rendering it impregnable, for it was beyond bow-shot or even the bolts from a mangonel. Alamilt lay six leagues distant from Kazvin, and its later fortress was built by the AJid missioner Hasan, surnamed Ad-Da £ i-ila-l-Hakk, in 246 (860). In 483 (1090)—or 446 (1054) according to Kazvim—it came into the possession of Hasan Sabah, surnamed the Old Man of the Mountain, and for 171 years was the chief stronghold of his followers. Alamtit was taken and dismantled in 654 (1256) by order of Hulagli Khan the Mongol, and, after its fall, the remaining castles of the Assassins were quickly captured and razed to the ground. Its supposed site has been visited by various travellers, and the remains of many other fortresses, said to be those of the Ismailians, still exist in the mountains to the north of Kazvm 1 . Abhar and Zanjan, two cities often named together, lay on the high road west of Kazvin, and were famous from early times. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century mentions Abhar as peopled by Kurds, its fields were very fertile and well watered, corn being largely grown here. It was protected by a strong castle built upon 1 Kaz. ii. 200. Mst. 147. In the Guzidah (chapter iv, section ix, part 2) Mustawfi gives the history of the Ismailians or Assassins in Persia ; and this has been translated, with notes, by Defremery, in the Journal Asiatigue i. 26). He gives in a list (p. 48) the names of the Ismailian fortresses taken and destroyed by order of Hulagu, but the position of most of these is un known. Girdkuh and Lanbasar were the last strongholds to fall. Alamut, however, appears not to have been entirely destroyed by Hulagu, or perhaps it was rebuilt later, for it served as a state prison under Shah Sulayman the Safavi, as is mentioned by Chardin (Voyage en Perse, x. 20). In the last century Colonel Monteith visited the ruins, and has described them in the J. R, G. S. for 1833 (p. 15).222 JIBAL. [CHAP. a great platform, and Kazvini reports that it was famous for its water- mills, also for the so-called ^bbasi pear grown here, in shape like an orange and very sweet. According to Yakftt the Persians pronounced the name Avhar. Mustawfi records that the fortress was rebuilt under the Saljiiks by the Atabeg Baha-ad-Din Haydar, and hence was known as the Haydariyah. The city walls measured 5500 paces in circuit, and the Abhar river, after watering the district, flowed towards Kazvin, becoming lost in the desert plain. The city of Zanjan lay about 50 miles to the north west of Abhar, and on the Zanjan river, which flowed west to the Safid RM. Zanjan is described by Ibn Hawkal as larger than Abhar; and it was on the high road into Adharbayjan. The Persians, YaMt says, pronounce the name Zangan, and Mustawfi states that the place was founded by King Ardashir Babgan, being first named Shahin. Zanjan had been ruined during the Mongol invasion; its walls, however, were still 10,000 paces in circuit, the district was most fertile, and its revenues amounted to 20,000 dinars. Mustawfi adds that the language talked here, in the beginning of the 8th (r4th) century, was still £ almost pure Pahlavi,' by which a local Persian dialect is doubtless indicated 1 . About half-way between Abhar and Zanjan, in the centre of the great plain forming the watershed between rivers flowing west to the Safid RM and east to the Great Desert, lie the ruins of the Mongol city of Sultaniyah, which, founded by Arghtin Khan, was completed by Uljaytll Sultan in 704 (1305) and made the capital city of the Il-Khan dynasty. Abu-l-Fida states that its Mongol name was Kungurlan, and according to Mustawfi nine cities were of its dependencies. Its walls were 30,000 paces in circuit, and in the central fortification stood the great sepulchre of Uljaytil, adorned with many carvings in stone. The ruins of this domed tomb (or mosque) still exist, but of the city nothing now remains, although Mustawfi says that in his day Sultaniyah contained finer buildings than any other town in Persia, Tabriz alone excepted. On the Abhar road five leagues east of Sultaniyah lay the village of KuhM, ' which the Mongols call Sain KaPah,' Mustawfi writes, and under the latter name—'Sain's Fortress'— 1 I. H. 258, 271, 274. Muk. 378, 392. Kaz. ii. 191. Yak. i. 104; ii. 573&gt; 574&gt; 948; iv. 1017. Mst. 146, 147, 217.XV] JIBAL. 223 the place still exists, Sain, otherwise called Batii Khan, being the grandson of Changiz Khan. The strong castle of Sarjahan stood on the mountain spurs half-way between Sain KaPah and Sultamyah. From the latter it was distant five leagues, and it crowned a hill-top overlooking the great plains which extended thence eastward to Abhar and Kazvin. Yak tit describes Sarjahan, which was of the Tarum district, as one of the strongest fortresses that he had seen; but when Mustawfi wrote it was in ruins, the result of the Mongol invasion, its munitions of war and garrison having been transferred to Sain Kal'ah. To the west of Sultamyah lay the two small neighbouring towns of Suhravard and Sujas, which were still of some importance when Mustawfi was here in the 8th (14th) century, though now entirely gone to ruin. Ibn Hawkal writes in the 4th (10th) century that Suhravard w T ith its Kurdish population was then as large as Shahrazftr, it was a walled town and well fortified, lying to the south of Zanjan on the road to Hamadan. Sujas, or Sijas, lay close to Suhravard, and Mustawfi describes both places as having been ruined during the Mongol invasion, so that in his day they were merely large and populous villages. The surrounding districts were called JarM and AnjarM (at the present day they are known under the names of Ijariid and Anguran), and Sujas lay five leagues west of Sultamyah in the midst of more than a hundred villages settled by Mongols. In the mountain near was the grave of Arghlan Khan, made a Kurugh or ' inviolate sanctuary' after the custom of the Mongols, and his daughter Uljaytli Khatyn had built here a khankah or convent for Darvishes 1 . On the western border of the Jibal province, near one of the head-streams of the Safid RM, are the remarkable ruins called Takht-i-Sulayman—' Solomon's Throne'—at the present day, with a little lake or pool which is always kept full by a natural syphon, however much water may be drawn off. These ruins 1 I. H. 258, 263. Kaz. ii. 261. Yak. iii. 40, 70, 203. A. F. 407. Mst. 144, 145, 148, 149, 196. Both Sujas and Suhravar ve apparently now disappeared from the map; though Sir H.

[CHAP. have been identified with the city of Ash-Shiz, mentioned by the early Arab geographers, which Mustawfi also describes under the name of Sattirik. At Shiz, Ibn Khurdadbih, writing in the 3rd (9th) century, describes the great fire-temple, so much honoured by the Magians, which bore the name of Adharjushnas. Hither, walking on foot all the way from Madain (Ctesiphon), and halting at the half-way stage of Shahraztir, already noticed p. 190, each of the Sassanian Chosroes was bound to come as a pilgrim immediately after his accession to the crown; for according to one tradition Shiz was the birth-place of Zoroaster. YaMt reports that the Persian name was Jis, otherwise Gazn, of which Shiz was an Arab corruption. He then quotes a long account from Ibn Muhalhal, who in 331 (943) wrote a description of Shiz, which he had visited in search of gold mines said to exist in its mountains. The town walls of Shiz, he states, surrounded a lake, that was unfathomable, about a Jarib (one third of an acre) in extent, and whose waters always kept the same level though seven streams continually flowed from it, and these streams had the property of producing petrifaction on objects laid in their waters. Ibn Muhalhal also describes the fire-temple, from which the sacred fire was taken to all the other temples throughout Persia; and for seven hundred years, he says, the sacred fire had never been extinguished in Shiz. The same place is described by Mustawfi who gives it as the chief town of the AnjarM district, and adds that the Mongols called it Satlkik. He describes a great palace here, originally built, report said, by King Kay-Khusraw, the court of which was occupied by a bottomless pool or small lake that always maintained its level, although a stream perpetually flowed from it, while if the stream were dammed back the pool did not overflow. Mustawfi relates that Abakah Khan the Mongol had built himself a palace here, for there w T ere excellent pasture grounds in the neighbourhood 1 . In the north-western angle of the Jibal province, on the high road from Zanjan to Ardabil, lay the important commercial town of Khunaj, ding to Ibn Hawkal noted already in the 4th (10th) 1 ;. r f •; F. 286.

Yaklit, who had visited the town, gives the alternative spelling of Khtina, but he adds that it was more generally called Kaghadh Kunan, 4 the Paper Factory ? —for the people augured evil of the name Khiina which signified 4 bloody ? in Persian. Mustawfi, who in his itinerary gives the position of Kaghadh Kunan as lying six leagues south of the Safid RM, and fourteen north of Zanjan on the direct road to Ardabil, says that during the Mongol invasion it had been ruined, and was, when he wrote, merely the size of a village. The stream that watered its lands was a tributary of the Safid Rtid. Excellent paper, however, was still manufactured, and the Mongols w T ho had settled in the place gave it the name of MughMyah, 4 the Mongol Camp.' The exact site of Khllnaj has not, apparently, been identified. Along the southern slope of the great range dividing the Jibal province from Day lam and Tabaristan to the north, were the three districts of Pushkil-Darrah, Talikan, and Tarum, of which the last two overlap, the names often being used indifferently, one for the other. These districts w T ere each divided into Upper and Lower, the Upper region being of the mountains, and as such counted to be of the Daylam province. Pushkil-Darrah, according to Mustawfi, lay to the west of Kazvin, and south of Talikan. It comprised forty villages whose revenues had formerly gone to the up-keep of the Friday Mosque in Kazvm. The name Talikan— the district lying between the Sultamyah plains and the northern mountain range—has disappeared from the map, but At-Talikan (as it is generally written) is frequently mentioned by the earlier Arab geographers. Mukaddasi refers to it as a most populous and fertile region; and expresses his wonder that the Sultan (the Governor of Daylam) does not live here instead of in the mountain valleys, £ but his people will not have it/ he adds. Kazvini refers to the abundant olives and fine pomegranates grown in Talikan, and Yaktit names some of its villages. Of these last Mustawfi gives a long list, but the majority of them it is impossible now to identify on the present map. He considered that most part of the Talikan region belonged rather to Gilan. To the north of Zanjan, likewise along the foot of the hill spurs, lies the Tarum district, which with the Arab geographers is L e s. 15226 JIBAL. [CHAP. generally found in the dual form At-Tarumayn, 4 the Two Tarums, , Lower and Upper, the latter being entirely of the Daylam country. As already said, the Tarum river was a right-bank affluent of the Safid RM, and its many tributaries irrigated this fertile district. Yaktit, who spells the name Tarum or Tarm (with the unemphatic t), says that there was no great city here, but in history the land was famous for the memory of the VahsMan family, and the last of these native chiefs had been dispossessed by Rukn-ad-Dawlah the Buyid. Mustawfi mentions Fmizabad as the capital town of Lower Tarum, Andar (or Aydi) being the chief place in Upper Tarum, with the fortress called Kal'ah Taj, and he names five districts, each comprising numerous villages. As being in Lower Tarum, but the position is nowhere given, Mustawfi mentions the great castle of Shamiran, or Samiran as the name is spelt by Yaktit, who had himself visited its ruins. YaMt quotes also a long account from Ibn Muhalhal, who passed through Samiran in about the year 331 (943), when it was counted as one of the chief strongholds of the Daylamite kings, and con tained (he writes) 2850 and odd houses, large with small. Fakhr- ad-Dawlah the Buyid took the place in 379 (989), dispossessing the last of the VahsMan family, a child, whose mother the Buyid chief married. At about this date Mukaddasi, who spells the name of the castle Samiriim, describes it as being of the Salarvand district, and on its walls were ' lions of gold, and the sun and the moon,' though its houses were built but of mud-brick. In the middle of the next century the Persian traveller Nasir-i-Khusraw visited Samiran on his pilgrimage to Mecca. This was in 438 (1046) and he describes it as the capital of Tarum in Daylam. It apparently lay three leagues west of the junction of the Shah RM with the Safid RM on the high road to Sarav in Adharbayjan. Above the lower town was an immense fortress, crowning a rock with its triple wall, garrisoned by a thousand men, water being obtained by an underground conduit. YaMt, who saw Samiran in the earlier years of the 7th (13th) century, found it a ruin, the result of an order of the chief of the Assassins at Alamtit. The remains were those of a mighty fortress, £ a mother of castles,' and it was situated on a great river that flowed from the mountains of Tarum. Its site, however, does not appear to have been identifiedXV] jibAl. 227 by any modern traveller. Another fortress of this district is also mentioned by Yaktit, bearing the name of Kilat, which was situated in the Tarum mountains, on the frontier of Daylam between Kazvln and Khalkhal. It occupied the summit of a mountain, and below, on the river bank, where a masonry bridge of many arches crossed the stream, was a suburb with excellent markets. Yakut states that this castle had belonged to the chief of the Assassins at Alamut, but like Samiran its site as yet remains unidentified 1 . In the matter of the manufactures and products of some of the chief towns of the Jibal province Mukaddasi gives us a succinct account. He says that Ray exported various kinds of stuffs, especially those known as Munayyar. Cotton was spun here and dyed blue, and the striped cloaks of Ray were famous. Needles, combs, and great bowls were made for export, the last two articles, according to Kazvint, being made from the fine-grained hard wood known as khalanj, which came from the Tabaristan forests. Ray also was famous for its melons and peaches, and for a kind of saponaceous clay, much used in washing the head. In Kazvm well-made clothes were to be bought, also leathern sacks used on journeys as wallets. Bows for archery were exported, also the calamint herb. Kum was noted for its chairs, bridles, stirrups, and various stuffs; much saffron, too, came from its district. Kashan exported a kind of dried immature date; also tarragon. Isfahan was famous for its overcloaks; and a special kind of salted meat was made for export; further, the Isfahan padlocks were renowned. Hamadan and its neighbour hood produced cheese, and much saffron; and the skins of foxes and martens were exported. Tin is named as found near here, and various stuffs, as well as good boots, were made in the city. Finally from Dinavar came famous cheeses 2 . The chief highway through the Jibal province was part of the great caravan road, commonly called the Khurasan road, which, as already described in the introductory chapter, went from Baghdad to Transoxiana and the farther east.

Of the Khurasan road, the fullest of the early descriptions, as already explained, is that given by Ibn Rustah at the close of the 3rd (beginning of the 10th) century, who, stage by stage, mentions all the streams and bridges crossed by the road, also whether it ascends or descends or runs across level ground, further naming the various villages and towns that are passed. We have, besides, four other early accounts of this road, the last by Mukaddasi, who gives the distances by the day's march {MarhalaJi). After the Mongol conquest and the establishment of the dynasty of the Il-Khans in Persia, Sultaniyah became the capital, and hence the centre of the road system. In the itineraries of Mustawfi, therefore, instead of starting from Baghdad and going east, the roads start from Sultaniyah, and towards Baghdad the reverse direction is of course followed. From Hulwan to Hamadan (to revert to the older order of the route) the stages are however practically the same in both systems. But from Hamadan, instead of going by Savah to Ray, the Mongol high road goes north direct to Sultaniyah across the Darguzin and Kharrakan districts. No great towns, however, are passed, and the stages on the road, as given by Mustawfi, being names of villages, are all extremely uncertain 1 . From near Kirmanshah, at the hill called 'Sumayrah's Tooth/ Sinn Sumayrah (see p. 188), the road to Maraghah in Adhar- bayjan and the north turns off from the great Khurasan road, running first to Dinavar and thence to Sisar (probably identical with the modern Sihnah town, see p. 190) and the Jibal frontier. This route, of which the continuation through Adharbayjan will be described presently, is given by bothKudamah and Ibn Khurdadbih, and the earlier portions of it are found in Ibn Hawkal. From Kirmanshah (Kirmisin), from Kanguvar and from Hamadan, roads branched to the right, going south-east to Nihavand, 1 I. R. 165—169. I. K. 19—22. Kud. 198—200. I. H. 256—258. Muk. 400—402. Mst. 192.XV] jibAl. 229 whence, and from Hamadan direct, the way went by Burujird to Karaj of Abu Dulaf and thence on to Isfahan. Mustawfi gives the stages from Kanguvar to Nihavand and then on by a devious route to Isfahan; while from Karaj Mukaddasi gives the direct road to Ray going via Avah and Varamin 1 . The present high road from Isfahan to Tihrin (past Ray) goes up through Kashan and Kum; but in the earlier middle-ages the caravan route kept more to the east and nearer the desert border, sending off branches to the left westward, in turn, to Kashan and to Kum. Mukaddasi, however, at the close of the 4th (10th) century, already gives the route direct through Kashan and Kum, as it goes now adays. In Mustawfi the road after passing these two towns turned to the left through Avah to Savah, whence Sultaniyah was reached, the great high road from this new capital to Ray being joined at the stage of Siimghan, as will be described in the next paragraph 2 . The number of marches between the towns to the west of Ray on the high road to the Adharbayjan province is given by Ibn Hawkal and others, also those from Zanjan north to Ardabil. The stages on this route, however, are found in fullest detail in Mustawfi. Between Sultaniyah and Ray the road passed through Abhar to Farisjin, leaving Kazvin to the north, and thence reached a stage called Siimghan (the reading of this name is uncertain), where it bifurcated. The Khurasan high road went straight onward by the shrine of 'Abd-al-'Azim to Ray, and thence to Varamin; while branching to the right southwards, the Isfahan road went first to Sagzabad (or Sagziabad), and thence on to Savah as already described 3 . Of the roads through Adharbayjan, in early times under the Caliphate, as already noticed, the great northern branch starting from the Khurasan road at Hamadan went to Sisar, and thence on to Barzah in Adharbayjan, 60 miles south of the Urmiyah lake, where it bifurcated 4 .

The left branch at the bifurcation at Barzah kept to the west of the lake, going by Urmiyah city to Khuwi, and thence by Nakhchivan (Nashawa) to Dabil, the capital of Armenia. From Tabriz there was the cross-road by Marand to Khuwi, and thence on by Arjish to Khilat at the western end of the Van lake. This last section is given by Istakhn and Mukaddasi only 1 . From Ardabil, north, the road went across the Meghan district to Warthan, where the Araxes was crossed, and thence by Bay- lakan to Bardha^h. From this town one road went by Shamkilr north-westwards up the Kur river to Tiflis in Georgia; while to the right by Barzanj, at the crossing of the Kur, another road led to Shamakha, the capital of Shirvan, and thence on to Bab- al-Abwab, otherwise Darband. A road from Dabil, the capital of Armenia, to Bardha^h is also given by Mukaddasi and others, but the stages are not easy to identify 2 . The Mongol road system which went through Adharbayjan to the north-western frontiers, as described by Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century, started from the new capital Sultaniyah, and at Zanjan bifurcated. To the right, the northern branch passed through Khiinaj or Kaghadh Kunan, crossed the Safid RM, and by Khalkhal city came to Ardabil, from whence Bajarvan, the capital of Meghan, was reached. From Zanjan, and crossing the Safid Rud by a stone bridge (called the Kantarah Sabid RMh), this road is also given in part by Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal, with a cross-road from Miyanij. Continuing on from Bajarvan Mustawfi first notices the branch road, east, to MahmMa- bad, and then mentions the stages on the main road, which went from Bajarvan by Bardha/ah and Shamktir to Tiflis. Returning to the bifurcation at Zanjan, the left branch, as described by Mustawfi, went up to Miyanij in Adharbayjan, and thence by Ujan to Tabriz, following the line given (in the con trary direction) by the earlier Arab geographers. From Tabriz Mustawfi likewise gives the road on to Arjish on the lake of Van, 1 i. K. 119—121. Kud. 212, 213. 1st. 194. 1. H. 252—254. Muk. S 8 ^, 383- 2 i. K. 121, 122. Kud. 213. 1st. 192, 193. i.

Finally, starting from Tabriz and going north-east, Mustawfi gives the cross-road to Bajarvan, which went by Ahar, crossing two passes; and along this line, he tells us, the Wazir 'Ali Shah had recently built a number of Rubats or guard-houses 1 . 1 Mst. 198, 199. 1st. 194.

The province of KMzistan comprises all the alluvial lands of the river Karun, known to the Arabs as the Dujayl of Al-Ahwaz, with its many affluents 1 . This river was called the Dujayl (Little Tigris) of Al-Ahwaz, past which city it flowed, in order to distinguish it from the Dujayl canal of the Tigris to the north of Baghdad. Khuzistan means { the Land of the Khuz,' a name otherwise written Htiz or Huz; and the plural of Huz, in Arabic, is Ahwaz, which was the capital city, Al-Ahwaz being the shortened form of Stik-al-Ahwaz, 'the Market of the H^z people.' The name Khiizistan for the province is now become almost obsolete, and at the present day this district of Persia is known as 'Arabistan, 'the Arab Province.' Its great river, too, is no longer called the Dujayl, being now known as the Kartin, a name which is said to be a corruption of Kuh Rang, 'the Coloured Hills,' namely the mountains from which it descends; the name Kartin, however, appears to have been unknown to the medieval Arab or Persian geographers. The upper waters of the Dujayl or Karun river ramify 1 For Khuzistan see Map n, p. 25.CHAP. XVI] KHCTZISTAN. through the gorges of the district of Greater Lur, and its affluents come down from Lesser Lur and the Kurdistan mountains. The source of the Dujayl is in the Kuh Zard, 'the Yellow Mountain' (see p. 207); from which, on the other versant, the main stream of the river Zandah RM flows towards Isfahan. The Dujayl river after a long and winding course through the gorges, with many minor affluents on either bank, comes to the city of Tustar, which Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century counts as the capital of KMzistan, whence he calls the river the Dujayl of Tustar. At Tustar the stream bifurcates, but coming together again at 'Askar Mukram, thence flows past Ahwaz, where it is joined by the Junday Sabur or Dizful river. The Dizflil takes its course from Buriljird in Lesser Lur (see p. 200), and its upper waters were known as the Kar'ah (or Kaw'ah). After being joined by another river, called the Kazki, the main stream flowed past the city of Dizful to join the Dujayl, as we have seen. Another great affluent of the Dujayl ran further to the westward, namely the river of Sus, otherwise called the Karkhah. This rose in the mountains of Lesser Lur, and was joined by the Kulku, also by the river of Khurramabad. After a long course these united streams, flowing down past the city of Sus, came to the Hawizah country to the west of Ahwaz and finally joined the Dujayl. At some distance below the junction of these affluents, the Dujayl river became a great tidal estuary, through which, to the east ward of the estuary of the Tigris (already described in Chapter II) the combined waters of the Khftzistan rivers found their way out to the Persian Gulf 1 . Al-Ahwaz, the capital of the province, had originally been known by the name of Hurmuz-Shahr (variously given in the mss. as Hurmuz AwsMr and Hurmuz-Ardashir), this being the Persian name. Mukaddasi describes the town as having suffered greatly during the rebellion of the Zanj in the 3rd (9th) century, and their chief for a time had made it his place of residence. In the following century it was in part rebuilt by the Buyid prince 'Adud-ad-Dawlah; and Mukaddasi writes of it as possessing in his day many great warehouses, where merchandise was collected 1 I. S. 32. I. R. 90, 91. Yak . ii . 496, 555. Mst . 204, 214, 215, 216. J. N. 286.169. 234 KHtJZISTAN. [CHAP. from the inland towns and stored, before being transferred to Basrah for final sale and export. In those days Ahwaz consisted of two quarters; one, the eastern, on the river bank, was the main quarter of the town, containing the great markets and the Friday Mosque, and it was connected by a bridge with the island in the Dujayl river, on which stood the western quarter of the city. This bridge, built of kiln-burnt bricks, and known as the Kantarah Hinduwan, had been restored by 'Adud-ad-Dawlah, and on it stood a mosque overlooking the river, which near the town had many waterwheels along its banks. The main stream of the Dujayl flowed past the further, or western side of the island, and a little below Ahwaz a great weir (Shadhurwan), built on the rocks, dammed back the waters, raising them for irrigation purposes. Three canals, used for watering the lands round the town, left the river above the weir, in which sluices regulated the level for supply and when opened in flood-time saved the city from inundation. The climate of Ahwaz, according to Mukaddasi, was execrable, hot winds blew all day, and by night sleep became impossible by reason of innumerable mosquitoes and bugs, which 'bite like wolves,' he tells us, adding that the noise of the waters rushing over the weir had prevented him from resting, being plainly audible all over the town. Snakes and scorpions, he says, infested the neighbouring plain, which in many parts was a salt marsh, and the rice-flour bread on which the population fed was most indigestible 1 . In complete contrast to the evil-famed city of Ahwaz was the second capital of Khuzistan, called Tustar by the Arabs, and Shustar, or Shushtar, by the Persians. This as the crow flies lay about 60 miles north of Ahwaz, but perhaps double that distance by water, on account of the windings of the Dujayl river. Mukaddasi records Tustar as surrounded by gardens, where grapes, oranges, and dates grew abundantly, and no town of Khfizistan, he says, was more beautiful or pleasanter to live in, though he admits that the heat was extreme in summer. The markets of Tustar were abundantly supplied; brocades, with 1st. 88. I. H. 171* Muk. 406, 410. Yak. i. 410—413; iv. 060. Mst.xvi] KHUZTSTAN. 235 / embroidered cotton stuffs of all kinds were made here, the brocade (Dibaj) of Tustar being most famous. The Friday Mosque stood in the middle of the cloth-merchants' market; and the fullers' quarter, down by.the river, was a fine place. In the year 260 a.d. the Roman Emperor Valerian fell a prisoner into the hands of King Shapur (Sapor I), the second monarch of the Sassanian dynasty, and during his seven years/ captivity, according to the Persian historians, had been employed to build the Greatjyeir (Shadhurwan) across the Dujayl im mediately below Tuscan THs was held by the Arabs to* be o v fte of tHe wonders of the world, and the remains of it still exist at the present day. The bed of the stream to the west of Tustar was paved, and the weir held back the water, enabling a parTof the full river to be diverted above Tustar into an artificial channel turning off eastwards, which rejoined the Dujayl river many miles lower down after irrigating the lands through which it j / passed. The weir of Tustar is given by the older authorities as measuring nearly_ a mile across, and according to Mukaddasi a Endge of boats {/isr) stretched over it, carrying the high road which went west from Tustar towards Trak. At the present day an ancient bridge of many small arches, over a quarter of a mile in length, carries the road across the weir, but this does not appear to have existed in the earlier middle-ages. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century describes the city of Shustar as having four gates, and it was protected by a strong fortress. His contemporary Ibn Batfitah calls the Dujayl (or Karun) the Nahr-al-Azrak, £ the Blue River,' and speaks of the bridge of boats, 'like those at Baghdad and Hillah,' which crossed the river west of the town from the Dizftil Gate. He describes at some length the various shrines at the place, which, when he was there, was, he reports, an extremely flourishing town 1 . The Great Weir at Tustar, as already said, was built to raise the water sufficiently high for a canal to be taken from the Dujayl 1 1st. 89, 92. I. H. 172, 174, 175. Muk. 405, 409. Yak. i. 847. Mst. 168. I. B. ii. 24. The story of Valerian, and the building of the Great Weir by Sapor I, is narrated by Taban (i. 827), who, with unusual accuracy, gives the name of the Roman Emperor as Alariyanus (the Greek form is OvaXepiavos). Mas^di (ii. 184) in error gives these events under the reign of Sapor II.above the city, which should water the lands to the eastward. This canal, now called the Ab -i-Gargar, was in the earlier middle- ages known as the Masrukan or Mashrukan, and according to Ibn Muhalhal—a traveller of the 4th (10th) century, quoted by Yakut—its waters were white, while those of the main stream of the Dujayl were red in colour. The main stream of the Dujayl (called at the present day the Shutayt, or 'Little River/ in the reach immediately below Shustar) is rejoined by the Masrukan branch some 25 miles south of Shustar, at a point near the ruins of Band-i-Kir. These mark the site of the city called 'Askar Mukram, which, throughout the middle-ages, was the most important town on the Masrukan, and the canal throughout its course passed through and irrigated lands planted with sugar- canes, the finest, it was said, in all Khuzistan. In the early part of the 9th (15th) century, Hafiz Abni and 'Ali of Yazd, writing after the time of Timtar, refer to these water ways under the following names : the moiety of the main stream of the Dujayl, which passed off to the eastward above Shustar (the Masrukan, or Ab -i-Gargar), was then called the Dii Danikah or 4 Two Sixths'; while the major part of the Dujayl, which went over the weir to the west of the town, was known as the Chahar Danikah or { Four Sixths.' At the present day a canal, called the Minaw, is diverted south-east from the main stream, and passing through a tunnel under the rock on which the castle of Shustar stands, irrigates the high-lying lands to the south of the city. 1 his channel is the Dashtabad canal mentioned by Mustawfi; and it is referred to by Hafiz Abrii, who says that the Chahar Danikah was divided near the city into two streams, of which only one re-united below with the Dti Danikah (or Masrukan). According to tradition the Masrukan had been originally dug by Ardashir Babgan, founder of the Sassanian monarchy. Mustawfi mentions the city of Masrukan as standing on the canal bank; and south of this, as already said^ at a point half-way between Tustar and Ahwaz, the Masrukan stream poured back into the Dujayl near the city of 'Askar Mukram. The Masrukan district was famous for a particularly ex cellent kind of date, as well as for the sugar-cane already alluded to.xvi] khuzistAn. 237 'Askar Mukram took its name from the camp ('Askar) of Mukram, an Arab commander sent into Khuzistan by Hajjaj, the celebrated viceroy of 'Irak under the Omayyads, to put down a revolt. Mukram encamped near the ruins of a Persian town originally called Rustam Kuwad, a name corrupted by the Arabs into Rustakubadh; and this afterwards became known as 'Askar Mukram, a new city having sprung up on the site of the Arab camp. At the present day the name of 'Askar Mukram has disappeared from the map, but its site is marked by the ruins known as Band-i- Kir, ' the Bitumen Dyke/ where the Ab -i-Gargar (the Masrukan) runs into the Kartin. In the 4th (10th) century 'Askar Mukram was a town occupying both banks of the Masrukan canal, the western quarter being the larger, and this was connected with the other side by two great bridges of boats. The city had well- built markets, which, with the Friday Mosque, stood in the western quarter, but a great drawback to the place was the number of particularly venomous scorpions that were found there. According to Mustawfi the older Persian town had been called Burj Shaptir, after King Sapor II, who had rebuilt and enlarged it; Mustawfi states that it was in his day commonly called Lashkar, meaning 'the Camp' in Persian, being when he wrote, in the 8th (14th) century, accounted as the healthiest of all the towns of Kh&lt;izistan. According to Ibn Serapion, and other early authorities, the Masrukan channel, in the 4th (10th) century, did not flow back into the Dujayl at 'Askar Mukram, but took its separate course, running parallel with the Dujayl main stream, down to the tidal estuary. Further, Ibn Hawkal, in the previous century, describes how he himself travelled down the bed of the Masrukan, at a season of low water, going by this route from 'Askar Mukram to Ahwaz; the first six leagues were, he says, by boat, the remaining four being completed on horseback in the dry bed of the canal. The old course of the lower part of the Masrukan cannot now be followed, for in this alluvial country the lapse of a thousand years has completely changed the face of the land. Below Ahwaz city, in the 3rd (9th) century, began the broad reach of the Dujayl called the Nahr-as-Sidrah—'the Lotus Canal'—which, after238 KHUZISTAN. [CHAP. receiving many affluents, ended at Hisn Mahdi, near the head of the Kar^n tidal estuary 1 . Eight leagues north-west of Tustar, on the road to Dizftil, lie the ruins now called Shahabad, which mark the site of the city of Junday Sabur, or Jundi Shaptir. Under the Sassanians Junday Sabur had been the capital city of Khuzistan, and as late as the time of the Caliph Manser it was famous for the great medical school founded here by the Christian physician Bukht-Yish^ c , who, followed by his sons and grandsons, stood high in favour with more than one of the Abbasid Caliphs. The neighbour hood was celebrated also for the sugar that it produced, which was exported thence to Khurasan and the further east, though already by the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi speaks of Junday Sabftr as falling to ruin, on account of the inroads of the Kurds. Its embroideries, however, were famous, and rice was largely grown; and in the town was to be seen the tomb of Ya^ub, son of Layth the Saffarid, who having made this city his capital, died here in 265 (878). Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century describes Jundi Shapilr as still a populous town, famous for its sugar-cane, though at the present day an almost uninhabited ruin alone marks the site. Dizffil, 'the Diz Bridge' or 'the Castle Bridge,' lies on the Diz river to the west of Junday Sabtk. The city took its name from a famous bridge, said to have been built by Sapor II, and called Kantarah Andamish by Istakhn. The remains of it still exist. The city was in the 4th (10th) century also known as Kasr (the Castle of) Ar-Rfoiash; Mukaddasi, however, sometimes refers to it merely as the town of Al-Kantarah, c the Bridge.' The place and its famous bridge had various other names. Thus Ibn Serapion calls it Kantarah-ar-Riim, 'the Roman Bridge,' and the Diz he names the river of Junday Sabur. Again, Ibn Rustah writes of Kantarah-ar-RMh, 'the River Bridge,' and in Ibn Khurdadbih we find Kantarah-az-Zab, Zab being according to him the name of the Diz river. In the 8th (14th) century 1 I. S. 32. 1st. 90, 92. I. H. 172, 173, 175. Muk. 409, 411. A. Y. i. 588, 591, 599. Hfz. 82^. Mst. 169, 170. Yak. i. 411, 412; ii. 676. Ham- zah, 47.XVI] kh C tzist A n. 239 Mustawfi describes the bridge as built of 42 arches, being 320 paces in length, and the roadway 15 paces wide; he says it was then called the Andalmishk (or Andamish) Bridge. The town of Dizful occupied both banks of the river, and above the town a canal, cut through the rock on the east side, turned a great waterwheel working a mechanism which raised the water 50 ells and thus supplied all the houses of the town. The pasture lands round Dizfill were famous, and the narcissus grew here abundantly. 'Ali of Yazd gives the name of Zal to the river, and he describes the bridge at PJizful (a name which he writes Dizpul, in the Persian fashion) as built on 28 great arches, with 27 smaller ones between each two, making a total of 55. A reference to the modern map shows that at the present day the Dizpul river joins the Kartin opposite Band-i-Kir (Askar Mukram), but in earlier times it must have come into the Dujayl somewhat lower down, and probably in its upper course the stream passed nearer to Junday Sabur than is now the case. At its junction, in the middle-ages, with the Dujayl, and probably to the north of Ahwaz, lay the two fertile districts, with their chief towns, called Great and Little Manadhir, which Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes as surrounded by palm-groves and growing much corn 1 . The country to the north and east of Dizful and Tustar, was, in the earlier middle-ages, known as the Lur Plain (Sahra Lur), being occupied by the Lur tribes who in later times migrated into Lesser and Greater Lur, the mountain districts, of which the first- named was included in the JiMl province, as already noticed in Chapter XIV. In the 4th (10th) century, when Ibn Hawkal wrote, the Lurs had evidently already begun to migrate, for he describes the neighbourhood as inhabited by the Kurds, and says of the Lur country that it was a most fertile though exceedingly mountainous district 2 . 1 I.

This was a populous town in the middle-ages, being the centre of a district with many cities, and it was famous for its raw silk, as well as for oranges, while the sugar-cane grew here abundantly. The city was protected by an ancient fortress, and there were fine markets in the town, where stood a Friday Mosque built on round columns. Tra dition asserted that the tomb of the prophet Daniel had been made in the bed of the Karkhah river which ran on the further side of Slis, and a fine mosque marked the place on the bank which lay nearest to his supposed grave. Mustawfi, who describes the city as a flourishing place in the 8th (14th) century, speaks of the tomb of the prophet Daniel as standing (apparently on dry ground) to the west of it, adding that in his honour none of the fish in the river were ever molested by man. The neighbour ing city of Karkha, or Karkhah, which now gives its name to the river flowing by the mounds of Slis, lies some distance above these, and on the right or western bank. Mukaddasi describes it as a small but populous town, holding its market weekly, on the Sunday. It was protected by a castle, and was surrounded by gardens A number of places are mentioned by the early geographers as lying on or near the Karkhah river, some to the westward, some below Sus, which were important towns during the middle-ages, but of which no trace now remains on the modern map. Their positions are, however, approximately given by the Itineraries. Of these the most important was Basinna, which lay a short day's journey south of Sus, on a canal (or possibly a minor affluent of the Karkhah river), which was known as the Dujayl or 'Little Tigris' of Basinna. It was a great place for trade, and the veils of Basinna were celebrated all over the Moslem world; beautiful carpets of felt also were made here, and wool-spinning was a chief industry. The city was defended by two castles, and the Friday Mosque, a bow-shot from the river bank, stood at the town gate; seven mills built in barges floated on the 'Little Tigris' according to Mukaddasi. Near Basinna, and also about 1 1st. 88, 92, 93. I. H. 174. Muk. 405, 407, 408. Mst. 269. A. F. 311.

Mukaddasi speaks of it as a large place, surrounded by date-groves, and on account of its flourishing commerce it was known as 'the Little Basrah.' Mattut or Mattuth, where there w 7 as a strong castle, was also of this neighbourhood j it lay nine leagues to the south of Sus, and on the road between Ahwaz and Kurktib. This last—where were made the celebrated Stlsanjird embroideries—was a town of some importance, lying half-way between S6s and Tib in Trak, being one march from Siis and two from Basinna. Another town of this district, the site of which has not been found, though probably it stood to the north of KarMb, was Dtir-ar-Rasibi, which Yakut describes as situated between Tib and Junday Sabur. This Dur was famous as the birth-place and residence of Ar-Rasibi, who died in 301 (913), having been for many years the semi-independent governor of all the districts from Wasit to Shahrazur, during the Caliphate of Muktadir. He was celebrated for his immense wealth, and of the goods and furniture that he left at his death Yaktit gives a long and curious inventory 1 . The Karkhah river is joined at about the latitude of Ahwaz by streams coming down from Hawizah (or Huwayzah, the diminu tive form of Htiz or Huz, as already said, the name of the people of this province), which Mustawfi describes in the 8th (14th) century as one of the most flourishing cities of Khuzistan. Corn, cotton, and sugar-cane grew here abundantly, and the town had at that time a population of Sabaeans or Sabians. The town of Nahr Tira or Nahr Tirin, on the canal or river of this name, which appears to have been a right bank affluent of the lower Karkhah, must also have been of the Hawizah district. It lay a day's journey west of Ahwaz on the road to Wasit, and it was famous for the stuffs made there, which resembled those of Baghdad. The Karkhah river flows from the west into the Dujayl below Ahwaz, probably in the broad reach, already referred to, known as 1 1st. 171, 175. I. H. 93. Muk. 405, 408.

From the east, but lower down, is the junction of the Dawrak river, or canal, on which lay the city of this name, the capital of the Surrak district. The town was called Dawrak-al-Furs, 'of the Persians'; it was very spacious, with fine markets where goods of all sorts were warehoused, and the pilgrims from Fars and Kirman mostly passed through here on their road to Mecca. It was famous for its veils. Its Friday Mosque stood in the market-place, and on the river bank were many hamlets. Yellow sulphur was found here, near the hot sulphur springs, where the sick bathed and were healed. These, which were especially beneficial in skin diseases, gushed out from a hill side, the waters filling two tanks. In the 4th (10th) century wonderful Sassanian buildings were still to be seen at Dawrak, also a fire-temple, according to Ibn Muhalhal. In the district near Dawrak were the two cities of Mirakiyan and Mirathiyan, which Mukaddasi describes. The first lay on a tidal canal, and was surrounded by excellent lands; while Mirathiyan consisted of two quarters, with a Friday Mosque in each of them and markets that were much frequented. In the 4th (10th) century much of the water of the southern swampy lands of the Khuzistan district drained out to the Persian Gulf by channels running south from Dawrak, and these entered the sea at Basiyan. Near this town must have been the creek and island of Dawrakistan, mentioned by Yakut and Kazwini, where ships coming from India cast anchor. The town here was protected by a fortress, to which political prisoners were sent by the Caliph to be kept out of the way; and as late as the 7th (13th) century boats could pass up from here northwards, to Askar Mukram, by a series of canals or rivers that flowed to the eastward of the Dujayl The Dujayl below Ahwaz soon broadened out to become the tidal estuary, which was the lower part of the Lotus river or Nahr- as-Sidrah. On this estuary stood Silk Bahr, a town where, until the time of the Caliph Muktadir in the middle of the 4th (10th) 1 1st. 93. I. H. 176. Muk. 407,412. Yak. i. 411; ii. 371, 618, 620. Mst. 169.

The town of Siik-al-Arba c a (the Wednesday market) was in this neighbourhood, lying to the east of the Dujayl, and on a canal which divided the town into two quarters that were connected by a wooden bridge. The eastern quarter of Slik-al-Arba'a was the more populous, and here was the mosque. The neighbouring town of Jubba was noted for its sugar-canes, and the lands near were occupied by many villages. At the head of the broad waters of the great tidal estuary of the Dujayl was the fortress called Hisn Mahdi, with a mosque standing in the midst of its guard-houses (Rubat), said to have been built by the Caliph Mahdi, father of Hariin-ar-Rashid. Hisn Mahdi stood a few miles above the point where the Adudi canal branched off to the westward, joining the head of the Dujayl estuary with the Blind Tigris at Bayan, and round it lay the district of the Sabkhah, or salt marshes (see Chapter III, p. 48). The estuary, or Fayd of the Dujayl went into the Persian Gulf at Sulaymanan, and this was a dangerous passage for ships, which appear to have reached Ahwaz more safely by threading the various canals and rivers going up by Basiyan to Dawrak and thence into the Lotus river. The fortress of Hisn Mahdi, the exact site of which is unknown, stood, we are told, at the junction of many roads, and commanded the upper reach of the Dujayl estuary, where it was nearly a league across, being immediately below where many streams from the Hawizah country and the Dawrak river flowed in from the north-west and the east. Above this point began the Lotus channel, going up to Ahwaz, from which city Hisn Mahdi was 20 leagues distant 1 . Three days' march east of Ahwaz is the city of Ramhurmuz, still known by the name which it received from King Hurmuz, grandson of Ardashir Babgan. In the 4th (10th) century it was famous for the silkworms reared here, and raw silk was largely exported. In Ramhurmuz there was a fine Friday Mosque, and excellent markets which had been built by c x\dud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid prince. Mukaddasi relates that every night the gates of the various wards occupied by the shops of the cloth- 1 I. S. 30. Kud. 194. 1st. 93, 95. I. H. 172, 176. Muk. 412, 419.

There was, he adds, a celebrated library here, where lectures were delivered, and this had been built and endowed by a certain Ibn Sawwar, who had also founded a similar institution at Basrah. Ramhurmuz got its water by a canal from the Tab river, but this in summer-time often ran dry, and the town was everywhere so infested by gnats that according to Mukaddasi mosquito curtains were a necessity. Mustawfi, in the 8th (14th) century, says that the name Ramhurmuz was then commonly shortened to Ramuz; the town was still a flourishing centre, much corn, cotton, and sugar-cane being grown in its districts. Six leagues south-east of Ramhurmuz, on the road to Arrajan and not far from the river Tab, which here marked the boundary of Firs, was the Hawmah or district of the Zutt, otherwise known as the Jat tribes from India (identical it is said with the Gipsies). This district was watered from the Tab river, and here stood the two populous villages called Az-Zutt and Al-Khabaran. Beyond this, and two marches short of Arrajan, close to the Fars frontier on the road coming from Arrajan to Dawrak, was the little town of Asak, where, according to Istakhrf, there was a small volcano. The place stood in the midst of palm-groves, and much dushab, or syrup of raisins, was made here and exported. Near Asak also were Sassanian remains, namely, a great Aywan or domed hall, a hundred ells in height, built by King Kubadh over a spring. East of Asak, and a few miles short of Arrajan, but to the west of the bridges over the Tab river, was the market town of Sanbil in the midst of its district, which thus lay along the borders of Firs 1 . The Lur districts lay east and north of Tustar along the upper course of the Dujayl (Ivarun river) and its numerous affluents. The country to the east and south of the upper Karun (which here makes a great bend and doubles back, between its source in the mountains west of Isfahan, and the point north of 1 1st. 92, 93, 94. I. H. 175, 176. Muk. 407, 413. Yak. i. 61. Mst. 169. By a strange error Yakut (ii. 791) mentions the village of Az-Zutt under the form Ar-Rutt, though he was perfectly well acquainted with the Zutt or Gipsies, and mentions a canal (ii. 930) called after them.xvi] khuzistAn. 24s Tustar, where it finally turns south and flows down towards the Persian Gulf) Mustawfi describes as the Great Lur district, and this lay contiguous to the Shulistan district over the border in Mrs. The chief town of Great Lur was Idhaj, otherwise called Mai- Amir. Mukaddasi describes it in the 4th (10th) century as one of the finest towns of Khtizistan; and it stood near the hills, where, at a place called Asadabad, was the palace of the governor. In winter snow fell here abundantly, and was stored to be carried to Ahwaz for sale during the summer. The fields being irrigated by the rains the pistachio-trees produced fine crops of nuts. Ibn Battitah, who visited the place in the beginning of the 8th (14th) century, says that Idhaj was already then more commonly known as Mal-al-Amir, 'the Amir's property,' a name which it still bears, Idhaj having now become obsolete. a Idhaj was further famous for its great stone bridge over the Dujayl, which Yakut describes as one of the wonders of the world. This, the ruins of which still exist, was known as the Kantarah Khurrah Zad, being so named after the mother of King Ardashir, and it spanned the ravine by a single arch, rising 150 ells above the water level. In the gorge two leagues below the town was a mighty and dangerous whirlpool, known as Fam-al-Bawwab, ' the Porter's Mouth.' The great bridge was repaired in the 4th (10th) century by the Wazir of Rukn-ad-Dawlah, the Buyid prince, and it took two years' labour to bring this to completion. Its stones were joined by lead with iron clamps, and it is said that 150,000 dinars (^75,000) were spent upon the work. Yakut says that earthquakes were frequent in the neighbourhood of Idhaj; also there were many mines, a certain alkali being found here, called Kukali, which was a sovereign remedy for the gout. He adds that an ancient fire-temple was to be seen at Idhaj, which until the reign of Harun-ar-Rashid had been constantly in use. Occupying both banks of the river, and four leagues to the north-west of Idhaj, was the small town called Susan, otherwise known as Artij (or Aruh). Round this place stretched extensive gardens^ producing grapes, citrons, and oranges, and Mustawfi says that the mountains, on which snow still lay in summer, were only four leagues distant. Ariij, or Susan, was also known as Jabalak, and this place according to some authorities is to be identified246 KHUZISTAN. [CHAP. with 'Shushan the palace' of the Book of Daniel. About iso^miles east of Mai-Amir, on the frontier of Fars and near the eastern most of the affluents of the Kanin river, is Lurjan (otherwise Lurdagan or Lurkan, all forms of the name of Lur), which Istakhn describes as the capital of the Sardan (or Sardan) district,—a spacious town embowered in trees. Mustawfi praises it for its. abundant grapes^ and it was often held to be of the province of Fars, on the borders of which it lay 1 . The main produce of Khtizistan was sugar, for the sugar-cane grew in almost all parts ofTt^ and^STukaOTasP states that in the 4th (10th) century^ throughout Persia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, no sugar but that exported from Khllzistan was to be found. He says that Ahwaz, the capital, was renowned for a special kind of kerchief, such as women mostly wear; and Tustar produced the brocades (Dibaj) that were famous all the world over, as well as rugs and fine cloth. Much fruit also was grown in Tustar for export, particularly melons. The district of Siis was especiaUyjliehome of the sugar-cane^ and the city exported enormous quantities of tKis Commodity; silk too was woven here and cloth stuffs. In 'Askar Mukram they made veils of raw silk, and napkins, also cloth. Basinna was famous for its curtains ; Kurktib for felt rugs; and Nahr Tira for long face-veils 2 . In Khuzistan all the rivers and canals were navigable for boats,, and much of the traffic between the towns passed along the waterways. The high roads centred in Ahwaz, to which the traveller from Basrah journeyed either by water along the 'Adudi canal, or by land across the salt marsh (Sabkhah) from 'Askar Abu Ja far, opposite Ubullah, to Hisn Mahdi; and thence through Stik-al-Arba'a to Ahwaz 3 . The distances between the various cities of Khtizistan are given by Istakhri and Mukaddasi in much detail. From Ahwaz a road went west to Nahr Tira, and on thence to Wasit in Trak. The northern road from the capital passed through'Askar Mukram 1 1st. 103, 126. I. H. 182, 197. Muk. 414. Kaz. ii. 201. Yak. i. 416; iv. 189. Mst. 151. I. B. ii. 29. For Susan compare Sir H.

From Junday Sabur Mukaddasi gives the route through the Lur mountains to Gulpaygan in the Jibal province^ north-west of Isfahan ; and from 'Askar Mukram another road (given by Kudamah and others) went east to Idhaj, whence across the mountains this likewise reached Isfahan 1 . From 'Askar Mukram, and from Ahwaz, two roads converged on Ramhurmuz, whence continuing eastwards the frontier of Fars was reached on the Tab river over against Arrajan. These roads are given by Kudamah and most of the other authorities, being a part of the high road from Basrah to Shiraz. Istakhri also gives another route, chiefly by water, from Hisn Mahdi to Arrajan, which passed by Basiyan on the coast to Dawrak, and thence by Asak to Arrajan. The stages north from Ramhurmuz to Idhaj are recorded by Mukaddasi, who also describes a route from Ramhurmuz across the Lur mountains to Isfahan. A second route passed from the Lur plains (north of DizfCil) bySaburkhwast to Karaj of Abu Dulaf—the distances here, however, are only given in marches, and the stages are difficult if not impossible now to identify. A third route north, given by Mukaddast, went across the mountains from Arrajan in seven days' march to Sumayram (in Fars), south of Isfahan, keeping along the frontier of Khuzistan and Fars 2 . 1 1st. 96.

The province of Fars had been the home of the Achaemenian dynasty, and the centre of their government. To the Greeks this district was known as Persis, and they, in error, used the name of this, the central province, to connote the whole kingdom. And their misuse of the name is perpetuated throughout Europe to the present day, for with us Persia—from the Greek Persis—has become the common term for the whole empire of the Shah, whereas the native Persians call their country the kingdom of Iran, of which Fars, the ancient Persis, is but one of the southern provinces. The Arabs had inherited from the Sassanian monarchy the division of Fars into five great districts, each called a Kiirah; and this division, which it will be convenient to retain in describing the province, continued in use down to the time of the Mongols. The five Kftrahs were:—(i) Ardashir Khurrah, with Shiraz, the provincial capital, for its chief town; (2) Sabur or Shapilr Khurrah, with Shapiir city for its chief town; (3) Arrajan, with the chief town of the same name; (4) Istakhr, with the ancient city of this name (Persepolis), the Sassanian capital of Fars; and lastly (5) Darabjird, also with the chief town of the same name. Further it must be noted that, during the Caliphate, FarsCHAP. XVII] FARS. 249 included Yazd with its district, also the district of Rudhan (between modern Anar and Bahramabad), both of these having formed part of the Istakhr Kurah. After the Mongol conquest, however, Yazd was of the Jibal province, while at the present day it is counted as forming part of Kirman, as is also the case with the former district of RMhan. In old Persian Khurrah has the meaning of 4 Glory ? ; Ardashir Khurrah and Shaptir Khurrah, therefore, signify the districts which commemorate the glory of the founder of the Sassanian kingdom, Ardashir, and of his famous son, Sabtir or Shapur ; the Greek Sapor. Lastly, the Arab geographers commonly divide Fars between two regions, namely, the Hot Lands and the Cold Lands {Jurum and Sarud), by a line running east and west; and at the present day we find that this division of the lowlands near the coast from the highlands beyond the passes is still current under the names, respectively, of the Garmsir and the Sard sir, £ the hot' and £ the cold region,' which are also the terms employed by Mustawfi 1 . Shiraz^ the capital of Fars, is an Arab foundation, and at the time of the Moslem conquest in the days of the Caliph 'Omar its site was the camping ground of the army sent to besiege Istakhr. As Mukaddasi points out, Shiraz probably owes its pre-eminence as a town to its central position, being supposed to lie 60 leagues from the frontiers at the four cardinal points of the compass, and 80 leagues from each of the four corners of the province. The chronicles state that Shiraz was founded in the year 64 (684) by a certain Muhammad, brother or cousin of Hajjaj, the famous governor of 'Irak under the Omayyads; and it grew to be a large city in the latter half of the 3rd (9th) century when the Saflfarids had made it the capital of their semi-independent principality. In the 4th (10th) century Shiraz is described as being nearly a league across, with narrow, but crowded markets. The city had then eight gates, the Gates of Istakhr, Tustar, Bandastanah, Ghassan, Sallam, Kuvar, Mandar, and Mahandar. Its water was from an underground channel carried down from Juwaym, a village five leagues to the north-west; and there was 1 Mukaddasi (p. 421) alone divides Fars into six (in the place of, five) Kurahs ; making a separate district of the country round Shiraz. 1st. 97,. 135. Baladhuri, 386. Muk. 447.250 fArs. [chap. a Birnaristan, or hospital, also the palace built by 'Adud-ad-Dawlah, the Buyid, who according to the established a library here. Half a league south of ShMz, this same Buyid prince, 'Adud- ad-Dawlah, surnamed Fana Khusraw, had built himself another palace and surrounded it by a new town, named after himself, Kard Fana Khusraw. Immense sums were spent on the gardens, which extended a league across and the houses round this were occupied by wool-weavers, brocade-makers, and others, being all craftsmen whom the Buyids had brought to settle in Fars from many distant lands. A yearly festival was held at Kard Fana Khusraw, which also became for a short time a mint city ; but its glories did not survive its founder, and before the close of the 4th (roth) century it had fallen to ruin. As a suburb it came to be known as Suk-al-Amir (the Amir's Market), and the rents on shops are said to have produced 20,000 dinars (^10,000) yearly. The walls of Shiraz were first built by Samsam-ad-Dawlah or by Sultan-ad-Dawlah (son and grandson of 'Adud aforesaid), being originally eight ells thick, with a circuit of 12,000 ells, and no less than eleven gates. In the middle of the 8th (14th) century, these walls having fallen to ruin, MahmM Shah Inju, the rival of the Muzaffarids, repaired them, building also bastions of burnt brick. When Mustawfi knew Shiraz the city was divided into seven teen quarters, and had nine gates. These were the Gates of Isfakhr; of Darak (or Darak Musa), called after the mountain of this name, two leagues distant from Shiraz, where the winter snow was stored in pits for use in summer-time; then the Gate of Bayda; of Kdzirtn ; of Sallam : of Kuba (for which some mss . give Fana or Kana); next Bab-i-Naw (the New Gate); and lastly, Bab-i- Dawlah and Bab-i-Sa'adah, ' the Gate of Government' and ' the Gate of Felicity.' Mustawfi, who gives the list, further remarks that ShMz is a very fine town, the market streets never being empty, but he admits that these last were inconceivably filthy. The water-supply was from the famous channel of Ruknabad, which had been dug by Rukn-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, father of 'Adud mentioned before, and from the canal of the Sa'di orchard. In^ spring, torrents flowed down through the city from Mount Darak; and thence drained into Lake Mahaluyah.XVII] FARS. 251 There were three chief mosques : first the Old Mosque—Jami ^tik—built by the Saffarid ^Amr, son of Layth, in the latter half of the 3rd (9th) century, and this mosque, Mustawfi states, was never empty ; next, and dating from the latter half of the 6th (12th) century, was the New Mosque, built by the Salghari Atabeg Sa'd ibn Zangi; and lastly there was the Masjid Sunkur, in the Barbers' Square, built by the first Atabeg of the Salgharids. The hospital of 'Adud-ad-Dawlah still existed, and Shf ahs visited the shrine of Muhammad and Ahmad, sons of the seventh Imam Mtisa-al-Kazim. The account which Ibn Battitah, the contem porary of Mustawfi, gives of Shiraz bears out the preceding. He, too, speaks of the Old Mosque, the north door of which was known as the Bab Hasan, 'the Gate Beautiful,' and of the shrine of Ahmad, where there was a college. Further, he eulogises the five streams that flowed through the city; one, that of Ruknabad, rising at Al-Kulay'ah, 'the Little Castle/ in the hills, near to which was the fine orchard surrounding the tomb of the poet Sa'di^ who had died in 691 (1292), about half a century before the time of Ibn Battitah's visit. Sa'di had flourished at the court of the Atabeg Abu Bakr, son of Atabeg Sa £ d who had built the New Mosque, and in the orchard round his tomb, which was much visited, were magnificent marble tanks for clothes-washing, which Sa'di had built on the Ruknabad stream. At the close of the 8th (14th) century, Shiraz had the good fortune to escape a siege by Timtir, who defeated the Muzaffarid princes at the battle of Patilah in the plain outside. The city suffered little damage, according to c Ali of Yazd, for Timtir camped at the garden called Takht-i-Karachah, outside the gates of Sallam and Sa'adah, opening towards Yazd. The same authority states that the other eight gates were then closed, and he also mentions the Red Castle Hill (Ktih KaPat Surkh) near Shiraz, the position of which is unknown. Of famous castles near Shiraz Mustawfi mentions KaPah Tiz, standing on a solitary hill three leagues to the south-east of the city. There was a spring of water here, on the hill-top, and another in the plain below, which for a day's journey beyond was all waterless desert 1 . 1 The reading of the name is uncertain. Tir, Tabr, Babr, Bir and Tasir or Tashir, with many other variants occur in the mss. of Mustawfi. 1st. 124.252 FARS. [CHAP. Shiraz stands on no great river, but its streams, as already said, drain eastward, flowing into the lake which occupies a depression in the plain a few leagues distant from the city. This lake is called Jankan by Istakhrl: Abu-l-Fida and Ibn Bat Utah refer to it as Jamkan; in the Fdrs Namah and in Mustawfl it has the name of Mahaltiyah, and at the present day it is known as the Lake of Mahalu. The water is salt, and from the salt-pans along its shore Shiraz was supplied with this necessary commodity, as also with fish, which were abundant in its waters. The lake was 12 leagues round, the district of Kahrjan lying along its southern borders, while to the south-east was the city of Khawristan, otherwise called Sarvistan, where the date palm flourished and corn was grown, also other produce of both the hot and the cold regions. Kubanjan, according to the Pars Namah and Mustawfi, was a small town near Sarvistan 1 . The longest river in Fars is the Nahr Sakkan, which rising some 30 miles to the north-westward of Shiraz follows a devious course, going south-east for over 150 miles; then after making a great bend it runs due west for another 150 miles, but with many windings, and finally, after receiving the waters of the Firuzabad river from the north, discharges itself into the sea a little to the south of Najiram 2 . The name Sakkan is said by Istakhri to be derived from the village of Sakk, which stands near the great bend westward other authorities, however, spell the name variously: thus we find Sittajan, 1 hakkan, and Sikan, while Mustawfi generally has Zakkan or Zhakkan.

The garden of Takht-i-Karachah, 'the Throne of Karachah,' was so named after the Atabeg Karachah, who became governor of Fars on the death of Atabeg Chaull in Sro {1x16). It is said to be identical with the garden now known as Takht-i- Kajar. 1 I. K. 52. 1st. 122, 131. Muk. 422, 455. F. N. 73 80 Mst. 172, 226. A. P. 43. I. B. ii. 61.

The Sakkan is probably identical with the river Sitakus of Nearchus. See Colonel Ross, 1883, p. 712.XVII] FARS. 253 writers, the district where the river had its source is named Masaram ,according to Istakhn it rose in Rustak-ar-Ruwayhan, which is the plain south of Juwaym and Khullar. These are two important villages, lying 5 and 9 leagues distant respectively from ShMz, on the road to Nawbanjan, to the north of the Dasht Arzin plain. Near Juwaym, as already said, one of the Shlraz streams took its rise. According to Mustawfi, Khullar was famed for its millstones, though the people themselves possessed no mills, and had to send elsewhere to grind their corn. Its honey also was largely exported. Dasht Arzin (the Plain of the Bitter- almond) was famous for its magnificent pasture lands (Marghzar), and the Lake of Dasht Arzin, which in the season of rains was 10 leagues across, was of sweet water; this, however, as often as not, dried up in summer. According to Istakhrt, the lake produced much fish, and Mustawfi adds that the forest near here abounded with lions 1 . The Sakkan river, 10 leagues south of Shiraz, passed the town of Kavar or Kuvar, lying near its left bank. According to Mustawfi a dam had here been thrown across the stream to raise its water for irrigation, and the neighbouring pasture lands were famous. Both the sour cherry and the almond grew here plentifully, also large pomegranates. Beyond Kuvar, also on the left bank of the river Sakkan, is the town of Khabr, noted for the tomb of Sa'id, brother of Hasan-al-Basri, the theologian. Mustawfi states that Khabr was larger than Kuvar, and that near by was the famous castle of Tir-i-Khuda, ' God's Arrow,' so called from its inaccessi bility, for it stood on a hill-top, so that no human arrow could attain it. Below Khabr the Sakkan river turned south, following a sinuous course through the district of Simkan, the town of Simkan being near its left bank at the junction of a great affluent coming from Darabjird on the east 2 . According to Mustawfi, Simkan was a fine town standing on 1 Juwaym, sometimes written Juwayn, is the present village of Goyun. 1st. 120, 122. I. K. 44. F. N. 77 b, 79 80 81 Yak. ii. 457.

The wine made here was so strong that, before drinking, it had to be mixed with twice or thrice its weight of water. Not far distant was Hirak, a large village of the dependencies of Simkan. Near the right bank of the Sakkan river, and south of the Simkan district, were the three towns of Karzin, Kir and Abzar, the surrounding district being known as Kubad Khurrah, ' the Glory of Kubad,' in memory of one of the Sassanian kings. Istakhri speaks of Karzin as being one-third the size of Istakhr (Persepolis); it had a strong castle up to which water could be drawn from the Sakkan river, and being on a great height many distant castles could be seen from it 1 . The town of Jahram (or Jahrum), which is sometimes counted as of the Darabjird district, lies south of Simkan, and east of Karzin, surrounded by a fertile plain. It was famous for its great castle, lying five leagues distant from the town, called Kal'ah Khurshah, which Nizam-al-Mulk, the great Wazir of the Saljuks, had re-fortified, it having been originally built by Khurshah, who was governor of Jahram under the Omayyad Caliphs 2 . To the south-east of Jahram is the town of Juwaym of Abu Ahmad (so called to distinguish it from Juwaym near the head-waters of the Sakkan, see above, p. 253), which Mukaddasi describes as lying on a small river, surrounded by palm-gardens, having a fine mosque which stood in a long market street. The district to the south-west was called Irahistan, and near the town stood the strong castle called Samiran (or Shamiran), which Mustawfi characterises as a nest of robbers and highwaymen.' The surrounding districts were famous pasture grounds, especially those lying between Juwaym 1 1st. 125. Muk. 422. F. N. 72 73 a, 82 83 a. Mst. 172, 179. According to the FArs Ndmah (folio 78 and Mustawfi (p. 177)' there would appear to have been another district called Kurah Kubad Khurrah on the banks of the Tab river above Arrajan. 2 1st. 107. F. N. 69 a, 82 b. Mst. 175, 179. The name of the castle is writtenKhurushah, Khurshah, andKharashah, in the various mss., alsoKharshad arid Kharshar, but no mention of it occurs in the older Arab geographers.XVII] fArs. 255 and the bank of the Sakkan river, where were many stagnant pools and lion-haunted forests. The town of Kariyan, commanded by a strong fortress, lay one march west of Juwaym, and was celebrated for its fire- temple, from which the sacred fire anciently preserved here was distributed far and wide by the Zoroastrian priests. The fortress, which crowned a hill-top, was deemed impregnable. To the west of Kariyan, and at the great westward bend of the Sakkan river, stood Laghir, a place of some importance in the 8th (14th) century, when Mustawfi wrote, for it was a stage on the caravan road down from Shiraz to Kays island. Laghir also is mentioned in connection with Kaharjan (or Makarjan), a place no longer to be found on the map. Between Laghir and the coast, but along the right bank and north of the Sakkan river, lay the desert of Mandistan, midway between Najiram and Bushkanat; here were found neither permanent villages nor streams, but, none the less, as Mustawfi writes, on the rare occasions of sufficient rainfall, the whole desert might be made to grow crops of cotton and corn that at the close of the winter season would give profit of a thousand-fold 1 . M&amp;ndistan, the medieval name of this desert—meaning 'the Mand country'—is doubtless retained in the name of the Mand river, which, as already noted, is now used for the lower course of the Sakkan. About half-way between Laghir and the sea the main stream receives an important affluent from the north, namely the river of Firuzabad. The city of Firilzabad was anciently called Jur, and in Sassanian times this (in place of the later Shiraz) had been the chief town of the district of Ardashir Khurrah. Istakhri reports that the plain here had originally been a lake, this having been drained by King Ardashir, who built the city round an artificial mound—still existing here in the 4th (10th) century and later—called At-Tirbal, 'the Look-out,' with a building named in Persian the Aywan (Archway), standing upon a great platform. At this time Jur was as large as Istakhr, and the city was surrounded by a wall and ditch, with four gates, namely Bab Mihr to the east, 1 1st. 117. Muk. 427, 428. F.

The name Jilr, in Persian pronounced GUr, means 'a grave,' and it was held inauspicious by the courtiers of c Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, who was fond of coming here, that the Amir should be said to be residing in Giir, 'the grave.' Hence Jtir was renamed Finizabad—'the Abode of Luck'—and so it is called at the present day. Mukaddasi, who gives the story, speaks of the great town square {Rahbah), and the beautiful rose gardens of Firtizabad, also of the well-cultivated country round, stretching a day's march across. Water for the town was brought from a neighbouring hill by means of a syphon tube, and according to the Persian geo graphers there was a great castle four leagues from the town, called Kal'ah Saharah (or Shaharah). The Firtizabad river is named by Istakhri the Tirzah; the Fdrs Namah and Mustawfi call it the Burazah (or Bararah) river. It rose in the Khunayfghan district, and was said to have been turned from its original course by Alexander the Great, who, when besieging Jur, flooded the country round and made the lake, which was subsequently drained by Burazah the Sage, in the reign of King Ardashir. He after wards built an aqueduct that conveniently brought the waters of the stream into the town, and from him the river took its name of the Nahr Burazah. Kazvini says there was a celebrated fire-temple in Firiizabad, and refers to a wonderful spring of water that gushed out at the city gate; the red roses of Jtir, too, he adds, were famous the world over. The country to the north was, as already said, the district of Khunayfghan, or Khunayf- kan, which the Persians pronounced Khunafgan ; and among the hills there was a large village of this name, w T hence a difficult and stony road led down tajir^zabad 1 . The coast of the Ardashir Khurrah district was known as the Sif (or shore), and there were three Sifs, all of the hot region, or Garmsir, lying along the Persian Gulf. These were named re spectively the Sif 'Umarah to the eastward of Kays island; the Sif Zuhayr on the coast south of Irahistan and round Siraf; and lastly the Sif Muzaffar to the north of Najiram; the 'Umarah, 1 1st. 105, 121, 123.

In the 4th (10th) century Sif ^marah was famous for an impregnable castle on the sea, called Kal'ah-ad-Dikdan (or Dikbayah), also known as Hisn Ibn 'Umarah, where twenty ships could find safe harbourage, and the only entrance into the castle was by working a crane set on the walls. A short distance to the west of this lay the island of Kays, or as the Persians wrote the name, Kish, which in the course of the 6th (12th) century became the trade centre of the Persian Gulf after the ruin of Siraf, which will be described presently. A great walled city was built in Kays island, where water tanks had been constructed, and on the neighbouring sea-banks was the famous pearl fishery. Ships from India and Arabia crowded the port, and all the island was full of palm gardens. In summer, says Kazvini, the heat was greater than the hottest room in the bath (Hammam): none the less Kays was a very populous town. The island lay about four leagues from the coast, where the port of embarkation was Huzti, to which, in the 7th (13th) century, a caravan road came down from Shiraz through Laghir. Huzu, though much ruined when Yaktit wrote, had been a strong for tress in the 4th (10th) century under the Buyids, who made it their state prison. Close to the town was the village called Saviyah (with variants in the mss. Tabah or Tanah and the true reading is unknown) 1 . 1 1st. 116, 140. I. H. 188, Yak. ii. 711; iv. 333, 974. F.N. 74 &lt;5.

The stages on the road down from Laghir to Huzu are given by Mustawft (p. 200), but as no modern traveller has followed this route the names are not to be found on the map, and are most uncertain ; the distances are in farsakhs (leagues). 4 From Laghir 6 to Faryab district, thence 6 to the city of Saj (Sah, Haj, Dah, with many other variants), thence 5 to Ab-Anbar-i-Kinar, thence 5 to Haram (Siram or Marmaz), thence 6 down many steep passes to the village of Daruk (Darzak^ Urak or Davrak), thence 6 to Mahan (Haman or Mayan), and thence 6 by the pass of Lardak to Huzu on the sea-shore.' The district Mustawfi calls Faryab is evidently identical- with Barab, half-way between Kariyan and Kuran, as given by Mukaddasi (p. 454). The city of Saj is a puzzle, none being known in this region, but possibly we should read L e S. 17258 fArs. [chap. To the westward of Sif 'Umarah along the sea-shore was the Zuhayr coast, of which Kuran, inland, was the chief town, Siraf, and Nlband being its famous harbours; and the region went as far as Najiram beyond the mouth of the Sakkan river. Inland of this was the trahistan district. According to Istakhri, Kuran produced an edible clay, green in colour, that tasted like beet root. Mustawfi counts Kuran as of Irahistan, and says its lands only produced dates. Due south of it was the district and town of Mimand, not far from the port of Naband, which last stood at the head of a creek known as the Khawr or Khalij of Naband. Mimand, according to Mustawfi, produced quantities of grapes, also other fruits of the hot region, and it was famous for its clever craftsmen 1 . Further up the coast, to the north-west of Naband, was the port of Siraf, the chief emporium of the Persian Gulf in the 4th (loth) century, prior to the rise of Kays island into pre-eminence. Siraf, Istakhri says, nearly equalled Shiraz in size and splendour; the houses were built of teak-wood brought from the Zanj country (now Zanzibar), and were several storeys high, built to overlook the sea. This author writes that a merchant of his acquaintance here had spent 30,000 dinars (^15,000) on his house, and the Siraf merchants were accounted the richest in all Fars, a fortune of sixty million dirhams (about two millions sterling) having been gained here by commerce. There were no gardens round the city, fruit and other produce being brought in from the mountains of Jamm, where there was a great castle called Samiran. Mukaddasi speaks of Siraf as commercially the rival of Basrah; its houses were the finest he had ever seen, but it had been in part ruined by an earthquake, lasting seven days, which had occurred in 366 or 367 (977), and with the fall of the Buyid dynasty the place began to decay. The states that its final ruin was the work of Rukn-ad-Dawlah Khumartagin, the Jamm (1st. 106). This route, unfortunately, is not reproduced in the Jahan Nufnd, nor is it given by any Arab geographer. The coast of the Bani-as-Saffar would appear to have been identical with the 'Umarah coast, to judge by what Istakhri (p. 141) and Yakut (iii. 217) write. 1st. 104, 141, 152.

Ships then went on to Naband for shelter, as the harbour of Siraf was already silted up. Yakut adds that the name of Siraf was in his time pronounced Shilav by the natives. Najiram, a port of some importance to the westward of Siraf, beyond the mouth of the Sakkan river, was at the beginning of the Muzaffar coast, which stretched thence as far as Jannabah in the Kiirah (district) of Arrajan. Najiram possessed two mosques when Mukaddasi wrote, with good markets, and cisterns for storing rain-water. The Dastakan district was also of the Sif Muzaffar, and in the 4th (10th) century its chief town was called Saffarah. The district itself appears to have been in the neigh bourhood of Jannabah, but the exact position of the town of Saffarah is unknown 1 . Near the frontier of the Arrajan district, the river of Shapur debouches, and some distance from its mouth, probably above the junction of the Jirrah river, to be mentioned later, must have stood the important commercial town of Tawwaj or Tavvaz. In the 4th (10th) century Istakhri speaks of this place as about the size of Arrajan; it was very hot, and stood in a gorge of the lowlands, palm-trees growing here abundantly. Tawwaj, which was a place of great trade, was famous for its linen stuffs, woven in divers colours, w T ith a gold-thread ornament. The Shapiir river, which flowed near the city, was often called the Tawwaj river; and the town is said to have been peopled with Syrian Arabs, brought hither by c Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid. At the beginning of the 6th (12th) century Tawwaj had already much fallen to ruin. Its site has never been identified, but the position of the town is given as on or near the Shapiir river, in a gorge, being 12 leagues from Jannabah on the coast, and four from 1 Possibly this Dastakan district is identical with the coast of the Bani-as- Saffar, already mentioned. 1st. 34, 106, 116, 127, 141, 154.

Tawwaj was a famous place at the time of the first Moslem conquest, and its mosque dated from those early days; but when Mustawfi wrote, it had become a complete ruin. The important town of Ghundijan, in the district of Dasht Barin, was of this neighbourhood. The position of Ghundijan, of which apparently no ruins now exist, is given in the Fdrs Namah as standing four leagues from Jirrah and 12 from Tawwaj; and the author speaks of the Jirrah river as flowing by 'a part of Ghundijan. , In the 4th (10th) century the town is said to have equalled Istakhr (Persepolis) or Jannabah in size; carpets and veils were made here, and the district was counted as of the hot region. Mukaddasi describes a stream among the Ghundijan hills as producing a poisonous hot vapour, so that none could approach it, and birds flying over the stream fell down suffocated; but there were also hot mineral springs here that healed the sick. The population of Ghundijan, according to Mustawfi, consisted mostly of shoemakers and weavers, and in his day the name Ghundijan had taken the place of Dasht Barin in the common speech for the district. In the neighbourhood was a strong castle, called Kal'ah Ram Zavan (or Dam Daran, with many other variants), where great cisterns had been dug for storing water. The district of Bushkanat lay half-way between Ghundijan and the Mandistan desert (see p. 255) to the north of Najiram. According to Mustawfi there were no towns here, but dates grew and were the chief crop, for Btishkanat was of the hot region of the Gulf 1 . - 1 Mukaddasi and Yakut with many of the older authorities state that Dasht Bann was the name of the town, Ghundijan being that of the district. Originally, however, this can hardly have been the case, since the name Dasht Barin, meaning ' the Plain ' of Barin, is not applicable to a town. The name of a district or province in the East is very frequently taken over by the chief town, and following this rule when Ghundijan fell out of use, the name Dasht Barm may have taken its place, being used then for town or district indifferently, as Mustawfi remarks later, but contrariwise of the name Ghundijan. 1st. 106, 128, 130, 152, 153.

Yaktlt had visited the island, and says that from its hills Jannabah and Mahruban, both on the coast of the Arrajan district, were visible. The soil of the island was fertile, producing many fruits, and the date palm grew well here. In the neighbouring sea was one of the best pearl fisheries. Many of the other islands in the Persian Gulf are described by our authorities as of the Ardashir Khurrah district; but Kharik and K ays were commercially the two most important, and of the others named some are not easy to identify. Uwal was the chief of the Bahrayn islands, on the Arabian coast, and it is mentioned in the annals of the first Moslem conquest. Biishahr (Bushire of the present day) first appears in the pages of Yakut, and opposite to it on the mainland, as stated by Baladhun, was Rishahr or Rashahr of Tawwaj. The island called La wan (Allan, Lan, or Lar are all variants), by the distances given, must be the present island of Shaykh Shu'ayb lying to the west of Kays, and Abrun island is doubtless the modern Hindarabi which with Chin (or Khayn) lies near Kays. The great island at the narrows of the Gulf now called Kishm, also the Long Island (Jazirah Tawilah), is probably that referred to in our medieval authorities under the various names—possibly merely manuscript variants—of Bani (or Ibn) Kawan, Abarkafan, and Abarkuman. YaMt states that it was also known as Laft. The island of Khasik or Jasik was one of its neighbours, or was possibly merely another name for Kishm (the Long Island). Its population were hardy boatmen, and according to Kazvini they were much given to piracy and raiding. Near each of these islands were pearl fishery banks, but most of them were uninhabited, except during the fishing season. Beyond and east of Kishm was the island of Hurmuz (Ormuz), which being in Kirman will be spoken of in the chapter treating of that province 1 . 1 1st. 32. I. K. 61. Baladhuri, 386, 387.

The district of Sabur Khurrah, 4 the Glory of Shaptir' (Sabilr, as already said, being the Arabic form of the Persian name), was the smallest of the five Ktirahs or districts of Fars, and its limits were comprised within the basin of the upper Shapvlr river and its affluents. The chief town of the district in early days was the city of Shapilr, the name of which had originally been Bishaptlr 1 , more commonly known as Shahristan, 4 the town-place ? or c the capital.' Ibn Hawkal states that Shaptir city was in his day as large as Istakhr and more populous, but Mukaddasi in the latter part of the 4th (10th) century speaks of the town as already for the most part gone to ruin, its population having migrated to the neigh bouring and rising city of Kaziriln. Shaptir, however, was then still a rich place, for its lands produced sugar-cane, olives, and grapes abundantly, and fruits and flowers, such as the fig, the jasmine, and the carob, were seen on every hand. The castle was In the mss. the name is generally (but probably incorrectly) written Nashapur or Nishapur. Bishapur stands for Bih-Shapur, the older form being Wih-Shapur, meaning 4 the good Sapor' or 'the excellence of Sapor.' This prefix Bih occurs in other place-names ; cf. Bih Ardashir, or Guwashir, in Chapter XXI, p. 303.CHAP. XVIII] f A rs. 263 called Dunbula, and the town wall had four gates, namely those of Hurmuz, Mihr, Bahram, and lastly the City gate (Bab-ash- Shahr). Outside the town was a Friday Mosque, and another called Masjid-al-Khidr, or the mosque of Elias. In the beginning of the 6th (12th) century the author of the Fdrs Namah describes Shapfir as having completely fallen to ruin; and when Mustawfi wrote a couple of centuries later the name of Shapur or Bishapiir had been transferred to the neighbouring Kazirtln district. Mustawfi apparently knew the Shapur river under the name of the Shahriyar Rtid, and the city, he says, had been named Dindar by its first founder, the mythical King Tahmurath, the 4 Devil-binder.' Afterwards Alexander the Great laid it in ruins, and King Shaptir rebuilt it, when it was known, according to Mustawfi, as Bana Shapiir, and later as Nashapiir or Bishaplir. Its crops were famous in the 8th (14th) century: the iris, violet, jasmine, and narcissus grew abundantly, and much silk was woven here. Mustawfi further refers to the well-known colossal statue of King Shapur in the cave near the ruins. This he describes as ' a black statue of a man, larger than life, standing in a temple (Haykdl) ; some say it is a talisman^ others that it is merely a real man whom God has turned to stone. The kings of that country were used to visit it, and to pay it honour anointed the statue with oil.' Already in the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi refers to the cave, which, he says, lay one league distant from the city of Nawbandajan. The colossal figure of King Sapor he describes as crowned and standing at the mouth of the cave, in which water fell continually, and a violent wind blew. At the base of the statue were the semblances, sculptured, of 4 three green leaves.' The foot of the image measured ten spans in length, while the total height was eleven ells 1 . The upper course of the Shapiir river was called the Nahr Ratin by the Arab geographers, and it came from the Upper Khumayijan or Khumayigan district, of which one of the principal villages, ac cording to Mustawfi, was Dih 'All. Lower Khumayijan was counted 1 I. H. 194. Muk. 432, 444. F. N. 74^, 75where the name is spelt Bishavur and Bishapur. Mst. 175, 176. C. A. De Bode, Travels in Luristan (London, 1845), i. 214.264 fArs.

The people were mostly muleteers, who travelled with caravans. To the westward of Khumayijan was the district of Anburan with the city of An-Nawbandajan, otherwise called Nubandagan or Nawbanjan. This place, when Istakhn wrote, was larger than Kazirtin, the climate was hot and the date palm grew here. Mukaddasi speaks of its fine markets, of the gardens with their abundant water-supply, also of its mosque. In Saljtlk times Nawbandajan had fallen to ruin, but in the 5th (nth) century the town was rebuilt by the celebrated Atabeg, the Amir Chaffli Two leagues distant from Nawbanjan began the famous valley, one of the four earthly paradises of the Moslems, called Sha'b Bavvan, the waters of which drained to the Kur river in the Istakhr Kfirah. The valley was three and a half leagues in length by one and a half across, and its fertility was beyond compare; being due, according to Mustawfl, to the nature of the hills on either side of the valley, which stored the winter snows and thus afforded water throughout the summer droughts. A couple of leagues to the north-east of Nawbanjan is the great mountain fastness called the White Castle—Kal'ah Safid, and Isfid Diz or the Castle of Isfandiyar, occupying a fiat-topped table-mountain, many miles in circuit, bounded by precipitous sides. Mukaddasi possibly mentions it under the name of the Kasr Abu Tllib, which, he says, was called Ayan. The Namah states that Kal'ah Safid had been rebuilt by a certain Abu Nasr of Tir Murdan in the earlier years of the Saljilks, and that at the beginning of the 6th (12th) century it was in the The Amir Chauli (often written Jiuli), whose name so frequently occurs in the F&amp;rs Ndmah and Mustawfl in connection with the rebuilding of towns or castles in Fars, and the reconstruction of river dams, was governor of the province for Sultan Muhammad the Saljuk. Atabeg Chauli Sakauh (meaning ' the Falcon') received the surname of Fakhr-ad-Dawlah, and died in 510 (u 16) after having been the semi-independent governor of both Kirman and Fars for nearly a score of years.XVIII] FARS. 265 hands of their governor. The mountain summit, which was 20 leagues in circuit, had only one road leading to the top, and this was guarded below by the castle called Dizak Nishnak. The summit was a level plain, with many springs and gardens, and fruit grew here abundantly. The siege of Kal'ah Safid by Timur, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, made it famous in history. He was marching from Bihbahan to Shiraz, and took the place by storm, after a two days' investment, in the spring of 795 One march east of Nawbanjan, on the road to Shiraz, lay Tir Murdan, a small town surrounded by six villages, of which the most important was called Karjan (or Jarkan), lying five leagues from Nawbanjan. The surrounding region was well watered, very fertile, and much honey was exported. To the west of Nawbanjan, on the road to Arrajan, was the town of Anburan, in this district; also the Basht Kuta district, with the town of Basht, which still exists. Two rivers, the Darkhid and the Khtibdhan, traversed this region. The Nahr Khawrawadhan, otherwise the Khtibdhan river, had on its banks the town of the same name, distant four leagues from Nawbanjan, and Khubdhan town in the 4th (10th) century was a populous place, with a mosque and good markets. Four or six leagues west of this river, and two stages distant from Nawbanjan, was the small town of Darkhid, on the river of the same name, which last came from^ or some authorities say flowed into, a small lake. It is mentioned that the Darkhid river was a sufficiently large stream to be unfordable. The Khfibdhan river was an affluent of the river Shirin, which will be noticed when describing the Arrajan district, and either the Khubdhan river or the Darkhid was crossed by a great bridge, built by a certain Abu Talib of Nawbanjan, who had erected the castle of £ Ayan mentioned in the previous paragraph. Istakhn and Mukaddasi are at variance as to which of the rivers this celebrated bridge traversed. Later authorities add to the confusion by giving different names to these rivers, which it is difficult 1 1st. no, in, 120, 127. Muk. 434, 437, 447. F. N. 76^, 78^, 81^. Mst. 177, 178, 219. A.

The bridge is described by Mukaddasi as having been built in his day, 'and there is none to equal it in all Syria and Mesopotamia.' This was in the latter half of the 4th (icth) century, and Yakut in the 7th (13th) century apparently refers to it as still existing. Many of these places are also men tioned by 4 Ali of Yazd, in describing the march of Timlir from Bihbahan to Shiraz 1 . In this mountain region of Fars, known later as the Jabal JMyah, the five Kurdish tribes, called collectively the Zamm-al- Akrad, had in the 4th (10th) century their pastures and camping grounds. Mukaddasi speaks of a castle in the mountain near here that belonged to them, standing in a wide district with many gardens stocked with fruit trees and date palms 2 . The city of Kazirun, from the latter half of the 4th (roth) century when Shaptir fell to ruin, became the most important town of the Shaptir district. Ibn Hawkal describes it as in his time smaller than Nawbandajan, but well-built, the houses being of stone set in mortar. Mukaddasi, a little later, refers to it as 4 the Damietta of Persia,' already commercially important as the centre of the linen trade, and 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid had recently built in the town a great house (Ddr) for the merchants, the rooms in which produced a yearly rent of 10,000 dirhams {£ a 00 )' The houses of the town, Mukaddasi tells us, were all like palaces, each with a garden; the mosque crowned a hillock. According to Mustawfi Kazirtln had originally consisted of three neighbouring villages, named Nurd, Darbast, and Rahshan, built on the water conduits of these names, which, it is stated, were still preserved in the town quarters. The dates of Kazirtin were 1 The spelling of the names varies greatly. Khawrawadhan is contracted to Khubdhan, also written Khwabdhan, Khabadhan and Khavdan, or Khavaran in Ah of Yazd.

The neighbouring pastures, called Marghzar Narkis, 4 the narcissus meads,' were famous. The district round Kazirtin was known as the ShM country, according to Ibn Batfltah, who passed through here in the year 730 (1330), and at the present day this region is called Shiilistan. In the plain, a short distance to the east of the city, lies the Kazirun lake, which in the 4th (10th) century was known as the Buhayrah Mtlz, or Miirak (for the reading of the name is uncertain). It was 10 leagues in length, very salt, and contained much fish. The two famous passes on the road above the lake going up to Shiraz, which are now known to travellers as the Old Woman's Pass and the Maiden's Pass (Kutal Pir-i-Zan, and Kutal-i-Dukhtar) ; are named by Mustawfi, the Htishang Pass, which lies three leagues from Kazinin, and the Malan Pass, which is above it and is likewise very steep 1 . The roads down to the coast from Kazirun lead by Dariz to Kumarij, and thence by Khisht on the Shapflr river to Tawwaj, which has been described in the previous chapter (p. 259). Dariz was a small town, and already in the 4th (10th) century famous for its linen weavers; Khisht, lying beyond it, had a strong castle, according to Mukaddasi, and was surrounded by broad lands. The Fars Namah mentions Khisht and Kumarij together, and Mustawfi gives the people of both places a bad character as being inveterate robbers. A short distance below Khisht the river Shapur received on its left bank the waters of the Jirrah river, which was known as the Nahr Jarshik to the Arab geographers, and the latter, a few miles before it fell into the Shapfrr river, was joined on its left bank by the tributary stream called by them the Nahr Ikhshin. The Ikhshin river took its rise among the valleys of the Dadhin country, and according to Istakhn, its waters, which were sweet an d drinkable, had the property of dyeing to a green colour any cloth that was steeped therein.

The river next watered part of the Dadhin district, and finally, after receiving the Ikhshin river, fell into the Shaptir river some distance above Tawwaj. The Fdrs Namah and Mustawfi state that the country at the head-waters of the Jirrah river, near the town of Jirrah, formed part of the Ghundijan district, and this gives a clue to the position of Dasht Barin, which, as we have seen on a previous page, belonged to the Ardashir Khurrah district. The city of Jirrah is described by Mukaddasl as crowning a hill top, and possessing many palm gardens. YaMt states that the common people in his day pronounced the name Girrah, which is confirmed by the Fdrs Ndmah and Mustawfi; they also refer to its corn crops and dates, for all the lands round the city were extremely fertile 1 . The Arrajan district is the westernmost of the five Kiirahs of Fars, and Arrajan, its chief town, lay at its westernmost border, on the Tab river, which on this side forms the boundary between Fars and Khtizistan. The ruins of Arrajan lie a few miles to the north of the present town of Bihbahan, which has taken its population and become the chief town of the district since the close of the 6th (12th) century. In the 4th (10th) century Arrajan was a fine town, sur rounded by date-gardens and olive-groves. It had six gates, which were by order closed at night, and were named, respectively, the Ahwaz, Rishahr, and Shiraz gates, then the gate of Ar-Rusafah, the gate of the Maydan (or Square), and lastly Bab-al-Kayyalin or the Gate of the Weighers.' The mosque and market streets were magnificent. Soap was largely manufactured in the town. Near iVrrajan, and crossing the Tab river on the high roads into Khuzistan, were two famous bridges, the remains of which still exist. One was said to have been built by a certain Daylamite physician of Hajjaj, governor of Trak under the Omayyad 1 1st. 120, 127, 152. Muk. 433, 434, 435. F. N. 75^, 7 6a, 79 3.

This bridge, which was known as the Kantarah Thakan, stood a bow-shot from the city of Arrajan on the road to. Sanbil. The second stone bridge was more than 3000 ells in length, and dated from the times of the Sassanian kings, being known as the Kantarah-al-Kisrawiyah or 4 the Bridge of the Chosroes.' It was on the road leading to the village of Dahlizan. In a hill near Arrajan, according to Kazvini, was a cave whence bitumen (Mumiyd) was taken from a spring, and this was celebrated all the world over for its medicinal properties, while in the town of Arrajan itself a fathomless well called the Bir Sahik existed, the water of which was never known to fail, even in the driest summer season. Mustawfi, in the beginning of the 8th (14th) century, states that Arrajan was then called Arkhan or Arghan by the common people, and at the end of this century £ Ali of Yazd refers to the river Tab as the Ab -i-Arghtin. Arrajan had suffered much, according to Mustawfi, on its capture in the 7 th (13th) century by the Ismailian heretics (the Assassins, subjects of the Old Man of the Mountain), and the town had never recovered its former prosperity. There had been Ismailian strongholds on the hill-tops in the neigh bourhood, one called KaPah Tighur, and another Diz Kilat, and the garrisons of these places had frequently plundered the city and its districts. By the latter half of the 8th (14th) century, Arrajan had fallen completely to ruin, and it was replaced shortly after this by the town of Bihbahan, situated some half-dozen miles lower down the Tab river. Bihbahan, the name of which occurs in none of the Arab geographers, is first mentioned by 'All of Yazd, in his description of the march of Timllr from Ahwaz to Shiraz in the spring of 795 (1393)? and from this date onward Bihbahan has been the chief town of the region formerly known as the district of Arrajan i . 1 1st. 128, 134, 152.

In his Mir at-al-Bui dan (Tihran lithograph, A.H. 1294, vol. 1. p. 306) the Sani'-ad-Dawlah says that Bihbahan was first settled by the Kuhgilii nomads, by order of Timur, these having migrated from270 fArs. [chap. The river Tab of the Arab geographers is now known as the Jarahiyah, Jarahi, or Kurdistan river, for by some confusion the name of Tab has, at the present day, been transferred to the Khayrabad affluents of the Hindiyan or Zuhrah river, a different stream which flows out to the Persian Gulf at Hindiyan. The Tab river of the middle-ages had its source, if we may accept the combined authority of Istakhn and Mukaddasi, in the mountains to the south-west of Isfahan, at Al-Burj over against Sumayram in the Istakhr district. Thence coming down to the district called As-Sardan, in Khiizistan, the Tab was joined on its left bank by the river Masin, the village of Masm lying near the point of junction, and the combined streams flowed on to Arrajan. Below this city the Tab watered the Rishahr district, and then curving round abruptly to the south reached the sea to the west of Mahruban. The Masin river above-mentioned also rose in the mountains near Sumayram, and flowed past a place called Sishat, according to the Pars Ndmah and Mustawfi, before it joined the T ab. It is said to have been 40 leagues in length, and was a sufficiently broad river not to be easily fordable. Near the upper course of the Tab was the district of Bilad Shaptir, or Bala Sabiir, of which the chief town was called Jtlmah, which stood on the frontier between Fars and Khiizistan. The district had been very fertile, but when Mustawfi wrote the lands had already gone out of cultivation. Along the course of the Tab river, according to the Fars Namah, was also the region called Ktirah Kubad Khurrah, but all earlier authorities give this as the name of the district round Karzin, as has been already described on p. 254 1 . Kufah. For the ruins of Arrajan, and of the two bridges now known as the Pul-i-Bigam and the Pul-i-Dukhtar (the Lady's and the Maiden's bridge), see De Bode, Lurutan, i. 295, 297. The name of the first bridge is often given as Kantarah Rakan or Takan in the mss. Ibn Hawkal (p. 170) further mentions a wooden bridge as crossing the Tab river, passing at a height of ten ells above the the water level. 1 1st- HQ- Muk. 24,425. F. N. 77 b, 78 a, 79 a. Mst. 176, 177, 218. The Arab geographers evidently confounded the upper course of the Arrajan river (the Tab) and its affluent (the Masin) with the streams which we know to be the upper branches of the Karun. It is to be further noted that the Arrajan river, in its lower course near the Persian Gulf, has evidently changed itsXVIIl] FARS. 271 Below Arrajan the Tab river, as already said, curved round the Rishahr district (not to be confounded with Rishahr of Bushire mentioned above, p. 261); and here, besides the town of Rishahr, lying half-way between Arrajan and Mahruban, there was a town called Daryan (otherwise Dayrjan or Darjan) which in the 4th (10th) century had fine markets and lay in a fertile district. Rishahr continued to be an important place in Saljiik times, and the Fdrs JSamah speaks of its castle, and states that ships were built here. According to Mustawfi the Persians called the place Barbiyan, and the original name, he says, had been Risahr. Linen stuffs were manufactured here, and the population traded largely with the Gulf ports. The summer heat was terrific, and people went up to Diz Kilat, one league away, which as just mentioned had formerly been a castle of the Ismailians. Near Rishahr was Hindijan, a small town and district on the lower course of the Arrajan river, and Mukaddasi relates that this Hindijan or Hinduwan town was a great market for sea fish and possessed a fine mosque. In the Hindijan district were the remains of fire-temples, and some waterwheels of ancient con struction. Further, there were supposed to be hidden treasures, 4 as in Egypt,' and Kazvini speaks of a well, from which arose a poisonous vapour, so that birds flying above fell dead into it. Lastly, at Habs, a town in this district on the road to Shiraz, there had been a toll-house in Saljuk times 1 . Jalladgan, otherwise pronounced Jalladjan, was a neighbouring district lying between the lower courses of the rivers Tab and Shirm. The river Shirin— 4 the Sweet Water'—rose in the hills called Jabal Dinar of the Bazranj or Bazrang district, and passed through the district of F'urzuk, lying four leagues south-east of Arrajan. According to 'Ali of Yazd, Timtir, marching from bed since the 4th (10th) century. Mukaddasi speaks of it as debouching near Siniz, but this is possibly only a clerical error for 4 near the Tustar' river, in other words the estuary of the Dujayl. 1 1st. 112, 113, 119, 121.

For Habs the mss. give Khabs, Jis, Jins and every possible variation ; it was a post-stage, as men tioned in the Itineraries.Bihbahan to Shiraz, crossed the Shirin river on the day after leaving Bihbahan; four days later he reached the Khavdan river (already noticed, p. 265, under the name of Khtibdhan), and thence marched to Nawbanjan. We have seen that the Khub- dhan river was a tributary of the Shinn, and this last appears to be identical with the stream now known in its upper course as the Khayrabad river (with many affluents), and lower down as the Zuhrah river, which is the river marked on modern maps as the Tab, or Hindiyan. On one of the tributaries of the river Shirin was situated Gunbadh Mallaghan, an important place lying on the road from Nawbanjan to Arrajan which is now called Dti Gunbadan, 'the Two Domes,' and still shows extensive ruins. Of this neighbourhood were the Dinar hills, and the district of Bazrang already mentioned; also Saram, where the climate in winter was extremely cold, and the mountain summits near by never entirely free from snow even in summer. The town of Gunbadh Mallaghan, however, was of the hot region, and famous for its date palms. The name is also spelt Gunbad Mallajan or Malakan, and Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century speaks of the village here as in ruins. According to the Fars Ndmah in the beginning of the 6th (12th) century the small town here was protected by a castle, in which rations of corn, to last the garrison for three or four years, were kept in store. Many other like castles crowned the adjacent hills, among the rest one named Kal'ah Khing being especially mentioned. Mustawfi states that the neighbouring district was known as Pul Bftlft (some mss. give PM Ltilti) and was very fertile, producing famous apricots; and he declares the castle of Gunbad Mallaghan was so strong that one man might hold it against an army 1 . Not far from the mouth of the river Shirin—which, as already said, is the modern Tab or Zuhrah river—lay the port of Mahruban, close to the western frontier of Fars, and this was the first harbour reached by ships bound to India after leaving Basrah and the 1 1st. in, 112, 113, 119, 120.

To the north of Du Gunbadan is the castle now known as Kal'ah Am; possibly this is the place named Khing in the Fdrs Ndmah.XVIII] FARS. 273 Tigris estuary. Mahruban was accounted the port of Arrajan, and in the 4th (10th) century was very populous, and had a fine mosque and good markets. According to Mustawfi the Persians called it Mayruyan^ or Mahruyan; linen was made here, and dates were exported, but the shipping was always the chief source of income. Nasir-i-Khusraw T touched at Mahruban in 443 (1052), and describes the town as lying along the sea-shore on the eastern side of the bay. The markets were excellent, and the mosque bore the name of Ya'ktib^ son of Layth the Saffarid. Water was stored in cisterns, there were three great caravanserais for travellers who landed here for Arrajan, and the commerce of the place was considerable. The next port down the Gulf, east of Mahruban, was Siniz or Shiniz, whose ruins lie on the creek now called Bandar Daylam. Istakhri describes the place as larger than Mahruban in the 4th (10th) century. There was a small bay (K/iawr), and the town lay half a league from the open sea; the climate here was very hot, and date palms grew abundantly. Mukaddasi speaks of the mosque and the palace of the governor, and of the markets as being well provided with wares. According to Yakut, Siniz was half ruined by the Carmathians, who sacked the port in 321 (933). The Fdrs Namah however, and Mustawfi^ in the 6th and 8th (12th and 14th) centuries, speak of it still as a flourishing place, where flax was grown and much linen made. The port was defended by a fortress (Hisar), and the oil for lamps that came from its district was exported far and wide 1 . South of Simz was Jannabah (or Jannaba), the ruins of which still exist, lying near the mouth of the river which the Arab geographers called the Nahr-ash-Shadhkan. Jannabah according to Istakhri was extremely hot, and its creek (Khawr) was not a safe anchorage. The town was larger than Mahruban and had excellent markets; further, it was celebrated as the birth-place of Abu Tahir the Carmathian. The Persians called the place Ganfah, or Ab -i-Gandah, from its 'foul water,' and four neigh bouring villages lying on the sea-coast were counted as of its 1 1st. 34, 128. Muk. 426. N. K. 90.

The river Shadhkan rose in the Bazrang district, and, passing through the Dastakan plain, flowed thence out to the sea. Which stream on the present map it corresponds with is not quite clear, but it must undoubtedly be one of the two short rivers which enter the Persian Gulf near Jannabah. In point of fact, however, no large stream now exists here, though Mustawfi especially states that this was a 4 large river and not easily fordable, being nine leagues in length ? ; he therefore had in mind a stream of some considerable size 1 . 1 ^t. 32, 34, 119, 128.

The Kfirah or district of Istakhr occupied the whole of the northern part of Fars, and this, as already said, in the middle- ages included Yazd, with the neighbouring towns and lands lying along the border of the Great Desert. The capital of the district was Istakhr, as the Arabs named the Sassanian town which the Greeks had called Persepolis. The city of Istakhr lay on the river Pulvar, a few miles above its junction with the Kur river, and some distance to the westward of the remains of the great Achaemenian platform and palaces. At the time of the Moslem conquest Istakhr was one of the largest, if not the most important of the Sassanian cities of Fars, and it was taken by capitulation. In the 4th (10th) century, Ibn Hawkal describes the town as a mile broad, and as having formerly been surrounded by a wall which, he says, had recently been destroyed. At the city gate, crossing the river, was the Khurasan bridge (why so called is not stated), a very fine structure, and the houses stretched far beyond this into the country, being surrounded by gardens which produced rice and pomegranates. The other Arab geographers add nothing to this account, and the Moslem writers give no information of interest about the cele brated Achaemenian buildings and tombs, which they generally ascribe to Jamshid and King Solomon. Mustawfi states that the 18—2276 FARS. [CHAP. ruin of Istakhr (and hardly any trace of the Moslem city now remains) was due to the turbulent outbreaks of its inhabitants. Finally in the latter half of the 4th (10th) century Samsam-ad- Dawlah, son of 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, was forced to send an army against Istakhr under the Amir Kutlumish; as a result the town was laid in ruins, and from that time onward Istakhr was reduced to the size of a village, containing perhaps a hundred men, as described in the Fdrs Ndmah at the beginning of the 6th (12th) century. On the hills to the north-west of the city were three great fortresses, known as the Castle of Istakhr Yar, 'the Friend of Istakhr,' the KaPah Shikastah, f the Broken Castle,' and the Castle of Shankavan. Collectively these castles were called Sih Gunbadhan, 4 the Three Domes'; and from a deep gorge in the mountains, where a dam had been built, water was brought to the first of these castles, in which ^Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid had constructed great tanks, carefully roofed over on twenty columns, so as to be capable of supplying the needs of a thousand men during a year's siege. There was here an exercising-ground, or Maydan, on the hill-top, which had also been planned and con structed by 'Adud-ad-Dawlah 1 . The Pulvar river—which the Arab geographers call the Furwab, and which in Persian is written Purvab—rises to the north of Ujan or Uzjan at Furvab village in Jawbarkan. Flowing at first east ward, it turns to the south-west above Pasargadae at the tomb of Cyrus, which the Moslems call the Shrine of the Mother of King Solomon (Mashhad-i-Madar-i-Sulayman), and, running through the Istakhr gorge, passes this city and enters the plain of Marvdasht, where it falls into the river Kur a short distance above the great dam called Band-i-Amir. The river Kur rises in the district of Kurvan, a little to the south of Ujan, and not far therefore from the source of the Pulvar river, but it takes at first the opposite direction. Flowing towards the north-west it makes a great circular sweep, passing under the Shahriyar bridge, on the summer road 1 Baladhuri, 388. I. H. 194. Muk. 435. F. N. 67^, 81^, 83^. Mst.

Passing southward the Kur next flows near the villages of Kiirad and Kallar, turning then to the south-east, when it receives an affluent from the Sha'b Bavvan valley (see above, p. 264), and traverses in turn the districts of Ramjird and Kamfiruz. Passing into the Marvdasht plain it here receives on its left bank the Pulvar river, then waters the districts of Upper and Lower Kirbal, and flowing near the large village of Khurramah falls into Lake Bakhtigan, between the Jafuz district to the south, and the Kaskan district on the left bank. The /'ars Nam ah, and other Persian authorities, state that the Kur was known in its upper reach as the RM 'Asi, 'the Rebel River,' because till it was hemmed back by a dam its waters could not be used for purposes of irrigation. The first of these dams on the Kur was called the Band-i-Mujarrad, 'the Bare Dyke.' This was of very ancient construction, and having fallen to decay had been restored by the Atabeg Fakhr-ad-Dawlah Chauli in the beginning of the 6th (12th) century, after whom the dyke was called the Fakhristan, a name it still bore in the time of Haflz Abrii. Below the junction of the Pulvar the Kur was dammed back by the celebrated Band-i-Amir 1 or Band-i-Adudt, part of the works being also known as the Sikr (Weir) of Fana Khusraw Khurrah. All these names came from Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, who had constructed this dam to water the district of Upper Kirbal. According to the contemporary account of Mukad- dasi, this dam was 'one of the wonders of Fars.' The foundations of the dam were laid in masonry, with lead joints, and it threw back the waters of the Kur river, forming an extensive reservoir. Along this 'Adud-ad-Dawlah had erected ten great waterwheels, which raised the water to a still higher level, thus to irrigate 300 villages, and at each waterwheel was a mill for grinding corn. Soon afterwards a great town was founded near the dam. The lowest of the dams upon the Kur river was called the Band-i-ICassar—' the Fuller's Dam'—and served to raise the waters to irrigate the district'of Lower Kirbal. This dam was an ancient structure, but having fallen to ruin in the beginning of the 6th (12th) century it was repaired by the Atabeg ChMli 1 Hence ' Bendemeer's stream' of Moore'sFARS. [CHAP. aforesaid, who also effected a much needed restoration of the Band-i-Amir 1 . The great lake of Bakhtigan into which the Kur flows, though at the present day surrounded by desert lands, was in the middle- ages bordered by many villages and towns situated in richly culti vated territories. The waters of the lake form two great bays, of which the southern one in medieval times was known as Bakhtigan, the northern part of the lake being called the Buhayrah Basafityah or Jubanan. The waters were salt, and abounded in fish, which supplied the Shiraz market, and the lake shore was covered with reeds that^ when cut, served as fuel. The Jaftlz district was at the western end of the lake, with the town of Khurramah (still existing as an important village) lying 14 leagues distant from Shiraz, on the road to Kirman which went along the southern shore of Bakhtigan. Mukaddasi speaks of Khurramah in the 4th (xoth) century as a town with broad lands and a castle crowning a hill-top; this last was very strong and well built, according to Mustawfi writing in Mongol times, and the Pars Namah refers to its cisterns 2 . The south-eastern end of Lake Bakhtigan was of the Darabjird district, and here lay Khayrah and Ninz, which will be spoken of in the next chapter. Near the eastern end, in what is now a waterless desert, stood in the 4th (10th) century the two important towns of Great and Little Sahak or Sahik, a name which the Persians wrote Chahik (meaning 'a small pit' or 4 well') At Great Sahik the two roads—one along the north side of Bakhtigan lake, from Istakhr ; the other by the southern shore, from Shiraz— came together, and from Great Sahik one single road went on to Kirman. Mukaddasi describes Great Sahik as a small town, famed for its calligraphists, who wrote fine copies of the Kuran. In the neighbourhood, according to Mustawfi, were steel and iron mines, and the Fdrs Namah speaks of the excellent swords made here.

The easternmost, lying six or eight leagues from Great Sahik, was the city of BManjan, known as Kariyat-al -As, 'the Myrtle Village/ which Mustawfi gives under the Persian form of Dih Miird. The country round produced plentiful corn crops, and the myrtle, after which the town was called, flourished here. To the westward of Kariyat-al-As, and six or seven leagues further on the road towards Istakhr, was Kariyat 'Abd-ar-Rahman, other wise called Abadah, a city standing in the district of Barm. The town possessed fine houses and palaces, and Kazvini relates that the water in its wells was intermittent, sometimes rising up and overflowing the surface of the ground, and at other times being so deep down in the pits as almost to disappear from view. In Saljiik times Abadah had a strong castle, with engines of war, and great water cisterns 1 . The broad plain of Marvdasht is traversed by the lower reaches of the Kur river after it has received the waters of the Pulvar; it is overlooked from the north by Istakhr with its three castles, and was divided further into various districts. Lower and Upper Kirbal lay near the western end of the Bakhtigan lake; Hafrak and Kali came higher up the Kur river, and the meadow lands of Kali bordered the banks of the Pulvar. In the Hafrak district (spelt Habrak in the older mss.) was the strong castle of Khuvar, near the village of the same name. The place is men tioned by Istakhri, and several times in the Fars Namah, where its position is given as half-way between the A.dudi dam on the Kur, and Abadah on Lake Bakhtigan, being 10 leagues from either place. Khuvar is referred to also twice by Yaktit, who, however, evidently did not know its position. Its water was taken from wells, and the fortifications of the castle were very strong. The plain of Marvdasht was famous for its corn lands, being well irrigated from the dams on the Kur. According to 1 I. K. 48, 53. Kud. 195. 1st. 101, 131. Muk. 437. F. N. 66^7, 68 a, d, 83^.

Above Marvdasht came the Kamfmiz district, for the most part on the right bank of the Kur, of which the chief town was, and is, Bayda. Al-Bayda means in Arabic 'the White 7 (town); and this is one of the few instances in which an Arabic name has been adopted by the Persians (who pronounced it Bayza), and kept in use down to the present day. Bayda was so called because it 'glistened from afar/ and Ibn Hawkal adds that its name among the Persians had been Nasatak, meaning, according to Yakftt, Dar-i-Isfid or 'White Palace.' Part of the Moslem appi army had camped here^ when besieging Istakhr city; and Bayda is was as large a place as this last in the 4th (10th) century, ci Mukaddasi referring to it as a fine town^, with a large mosque, and a much-visited shrine. The pasture lands around it were famous, and the light-coloured soil made the city stand out 'glistening white' among its green corn-lands. The Kamfmiz H district comprised many villages^ which Istakhri names, and its oak (Balfit) forests were in his day haunted by fierce lions, which were the terror of the cattle on its pasture lands. y| North and east of the Kamfiriiz district was the district of oftli Ramjird, of which the chief city was Mayin. Half-way between J Shiraz and this place was the town called Hazar or Azar Sabur, fc. otherwise Naysablir, which is often mentioned in the 4th (10th) century. Mukaddasi describes it as a small town, possessing broad lands, irrigated by underground channels; and it was the first stage out from Shiraz going to Mayin, on the summer or mountain road from Shiraz to Isfahan. Mayin, the capital of Ramjird, is described by Mukaddasi as a populous city with fruitful lands. Mustawfi reports that under the Mongol dynasty its revenues amounted to 52,500 dinars (about ^'17,500 in the Il-Khanid currency). There was in the town a famous shrine of a certain Shaykh Gul Andam; and at the foot of the pass, on the road north, was the Mashhad of Ismail, son of the seventh Imam. Musa-al-Kazim. The district of Ramjird owed its great productiveness to the irrigation canals 1 1st. 104. F. N. 66^, 67^. 83 a, 84^, 86 a, b. Mst. 174, 175, 179, 180.

In Ramjird also was the castle called Saldabad, crowning the summit of a steep hill, the road up being one league in length. In old days it was called Isfidbadh (the White Place), and in the times of the Omayyad Caliphs it had frequently been held against their armies by rebel chieftains. Finally Ya'ktlb, son of Layth the Saffarid, at the close of the 3rd (9th) century took possession of it, and, after strengthening the fortifications, used it as a state prison ' for those who opposed him.' The name Isfidbadh is possibly a misreading, being sometimes written Isfandyar, and it is apparently identical with the Isfidan of the Fdrs Namah and Mustawfi, near which was the village of Kumistan, with a great cavern in the adjacent hill 1 . Near the left bank of the Kur river, not far from Mayin, stood the town and castle of Abraj (often miswritten Iraj), which is mentioned by Istakhn as of this district, and the place is still to be found on the map. The Fdrs Ndmah and Mustawfi describe Abraj as a large village at the foot of a mountain, on whose slope its houses were partly built. Its castle, the Diz Abraj, was in part fortified by art, part being already impregnable by the precipices of the hill summit on which it stood; it had gardens too, and was well supplied with water. The town of Ujan, or Uzjan^ which lies one march north of Mayin, is mentioned by Mustawfi, but no details are given. Ujan is probably identical with the place named Htisgan (for Husjan) by Kudamah, where the name is printed in error Khuskan, and in the text of Mukaddasi, again, it is misprinted Harskan 2 . 1 Kud. 196. 1st. in, 117, 126, 132.

Abraj, as given in the Fdrs Ndmah, is undoubtedly the true pronuncia tion, Iraj (as printed in the texts of Istakhri and Mukaddasi) being due to a clerical error in the mss. , and this has been adopted by Yakut (i. 419). The old castle exists above Abraj, and is now known as Ishkanvan, which recalls the name of Shankavan mentioned above (p. 276) as one of the three castles of Istakhr. See Schindler, P. R. G.S. 1891, p. 290.282 FARS. [CHAP. The most direct road from Shiraz to Isfahan went by way of t Mayin, and thence by Ktishk-i-Zard through Dih Girdu and ^ Yazdikhwast to Kumishah on the frontier of Fars. From Mayin p' the road went up the pass, going north to the crossing of the Kur H _ river at the Shahriyar bridge, near which was the guard-house of pa Salah-ad-Dm in the plain called Dasht Riin or Dasht RUm. North of this, again, according to Mustawfi, came the Mother and sai Daughter Pass (Garivah-i-Madar-wa-Dukhtar), and then Kushk-i- W Zard, 'the Yellow Kiosque,' which is probably identical with the Kasr Ayin, or A^n, of Istakhri and Mukaddasi. The plains of greater and lesser Dasht Run were famous as pasture grounds, and the arable lands gave four crops a year, these being watered by the Til Kur river and its affluents. K^shk-i-Zard is first mentioned in the Ha Fars Namah, where the name is more generally written Kushk-i-Zar, n or 'the Golden Kiosque.' To the north again, between Kushk-i- Zard and Dih Girdu, stretched the even more fertile pasture lands as t of the Urd or Avard district, the chief towns of which, according Lj to Istakhri, were Bajjah and Taymaristan (written Taymarjan in ^ the Fars Nama/i). Mustawfi mentions Dih Girdu, and it appears ^ in the Fars Ndmah as Dih Gawz (for Jawz\ both names signifying 4 Nut Village.' The earlier Arab geographers do not mention this u name (which is Persian in the forms given above), but by its position in the Itineraries, modern Dih Girdu must be equivalent to Istakhran of Kudamah and Istakhri. a . as ( Along the eastern borders of the Dasht Urd plain lie Iklid, Sarmak, and Abadah village, then Shiiristan and Sarvistan village, half-way between Dih Girdii and Yazdikhwast. Iklid had a fine castle according to the Fars Ndmah^ and like Sarmak was famous for its corn lands. The name of Sarmak is spelt Jarmak by Mukaddasi; it was a well-built town surrounded by trees, among which those bearing the yellow plum were notable, this fruit being dried and largely exported to other places. The village of Abadah, a stage on the present post-road from Shiraz to Isfahan, is first mentioned in the Fdrs Ndmah, and later by /' *' D Mustawfi; the same also is to be said of Shtlristan which lies on a salt river flowing east to the desert. The village of Sarvistan, Mukaddasi states, had a mosque in the 4th (10th) century, and the place was well supplied with water from the neighbouring placXIX] FARS. 283 hills. The name of Yazdikhwast, the town lying to the north of this, first occurs in the Fars Namah, but it is doubtless the same place mentioned by Mukaddasi under the curtailed form of Azkas. Mustawfi gives Yazdikhwast with Dih Girdii, but adds no particulars. The name is often spelt Yazdikhas 1 . Ktimishah, which Mukaddasi spells Kumisah, was, as already said, on the northern frontier of Fars, and it was often counted as belonging to Isfahan. Mustawfi mentions the clay-built castle of Ktilanjan which defended it, and tells us that it was sur rounded by fruitful districts. To the westward of Yazdikhwast is situated the town of Sumayram near the head-waters of the Tab river, and through it passed the western road from Shiraz to Isfahan. Mukaddasi describes Sumayram as having a well-built mosque standing in the market street. Nuts and other fruits of the cold region abounded here, and the town was protected by a strong castle, with a plentiful spring of water within the fortifi cations. Yaktit states that the name of this castle was Wahanzad. The western road from Shiraz to Isfahan passed through Bayda in the Marvdasht plain, and thence went on to Mihrajanavadh (or Mihrajanabad), which Mukaddasi describes as a town with broad lands, apparently lying on the banks of the river Kur, or on one of its western affluents. Between this and Sumayram the only important places were Ktirad and Kallar (already mentioned as on the Kur), two neighbouring towns, famous according to Mukaddasi and Mustawfi for their corn lands and the fruit trees of the cold region. Istakhn refers to their well-built houses, but apparently all trace of these two places has disappeared 2 . The shortest of the three roads from Shiraz to Isfahan is that already described, by Mayin and the Dasht Run plain, and this is called the Winter Road in the Pars Namah. The Summer 1 I. K. 58.

It is to be remarked that while Mukaddasi (p. 458) in his itinerary refers to Kurad and Kallar as though these two villages stood close one beside the other, in the Fdrs Ndmah itinerary (f. 84 b) Kallar is placed five leagues north of Kurad.284 fArs. [chap. Road was much longer, and was the easternmost of the three, going by Istakhr through Kamin and past the tomb of Cyrus to Dih Bid, where^, to the right, a road branched off to Yazd. The Isfahan road continued westward through Sarmak and Abadah village to Yazdikhwast and Ktimishah. Kamin, not far from the eastern bank of the Pulvar river, was according to Mustawfi a town of considerable importance in the 8th (14th) century, standing in a corn-producing district, and its fine pasture lands lying along the river are specially mentioned. Higher up, at the bend of the Pulvar, is Pasargadae and the tomb of Cyrus, which, it may be remembered, the Moslems identify as the tomb of the mother of Solomon. The four-sided stone mausoleum, still to be seen here, was held to be protected by a talisman, and according to the Fdrs Ndmah anyone attempting to take up his abode within its walls suddenly became blind. The surrounding pasture lands were called the Marghzar of Kalan. Dih Bid, 'Willow Village/ the next stage north of this, where the road forked, is given by Mukaddasi and the other Arab geographers as Kariyat-al-Bidh, and to the north again, about half-way between Istakhr and Yazd, stood the city of Abarkiih. Abarktih or Abarktiyah—sometimes shortened to Barkuh—is said by Ibn Hawkal to have been a fortified town one-third the size of Istakhr, with great markets, and Mukaddasi refers to its fine mosque. Mustawfi says the population were all craftsmen, and the lands round produced much corn and cotton; he further adds that the climate of the city had this remarkable peculiarity— that no Jew could remain alive here above forty days, hence 4 among the population of Abarkiih were no Jews.' In the town itself Mustawfi describes the tomb of the famous saint called Tafls-al-Haramayn, 'Peacock of the Two Sanctuaries' (Mecca and Medina); and it was an acknowledged fact that such was the saint's humility, that the shrine over his grave would never suffer itself to be covered by a roof. However often a roof was erected over the tomb, says Mustawfi, it was invariably destroyed by a supernatural power, lest the saint's bones should become the object of idolatrous worship. In the neighbourhood of Abarkiih was the village of Maraghah (or Faraghah), where there were magnificent cypress trees, celebrated all the world over asXIX] 285 larger and finer than those even of Balkh, or of Kishmar in Kuhistan'. Yazd in early times had been known as Kathah, and this name, when the town came to be called more particularly Yazd, had passed to its district, otherwise known as the Hawmah, or Jtimah (of Yazd). Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes the place as a well-built and well-fortified city, with two iron gates—Bab Izad and Bab-al-Masjid—the latter near the mosque which stood in the extensive suburb. A small stream flowed out of the castle hill, the lands round were extremely fertile, although so near the Great Desert, and fruit was largely exported to Isfahan. In the neighbourhood a lead mine was productively worked. Kazvini and others speak of the heavy silk stuffs that were woven in Yazd, all of most beautiful patterns. Mustawfi adds that the town was built of sun-dried bricks, which here lasted as burnt bricks else where, for hardly any rain ever fell, though water was plentiful, being brought in by channels from the hills, and each house had its own storage tank. One stage to the north of Yazd was Anjirah, ' Fig Village,' then at the second stage Khazanah (often incorrectly printed Kharanah), a large village with farms and gardens, defended by a fortress on a neighbouring hill ;and at the third stage, on the desert border, lay Saghand. This last, according to Ibn Hawkal, was a village with a population of 400 men, defended by a castle, and its lands were well irrigated by underground water channels. The three towns of Maybud, 'Ukdah, and Nayin lie to the north west of Yazd, one beyond the other along the desert border, and are generally accounted dependencies of Yazd, though many authorities give Nayin to Isfahan. Nayin according to Mustawfi was defended by a castle, and the circuit of its walls was 4000 paces. Our authorities, however, give no details about any of these places, merely mentioning their names 2 . 1 1st. 129. I. H. 196. Muk. 437, 457. F. N. 81 i ! i , 84^. Mst. 174, 175, 180, 200. J. N. 266.

About 75 miles south of Yazd, and half-way between that city and Shahr-i-Babak, is the town of Anar, from which Bahramabad is 60 miles distant in a south-easterly direction, and both towns are now included in the Kirman province. During the middle- ages, however, the whole of this district formed part of Fars and was known as Ar-Rudhan, of which the three chief towns were Aban (now Anar), Adhkan, and Unas (near Bahramabad) 1 . Unas, the chief town of the district, was, according to Istakhri, of the size of Abarktih, and Mukaddasi speaks of a fine mosque here, approached by steps from the market street, also baths, and well-irrigated gardens, though all round the town lay the sands of the desert. The fortress of Unas was very strong, and had eight gates, which Mukaddasi enumerates, for he had visited the place. The place, too, was famous for its fullers, who lived within the town, for there were no suburbs. The Rtidhan district is said to have extended over 60 leagues square. Originally, as at the present day, it had been included in Kirman, but in the 4th (10th) century it was added to Fars, and according to the Fars Ndmah this arrangement continued down to the time of Alp Arslan the Saljiik, who, after conquering all these regions in the middle of the 5th (nth) century, finally re-annexed RMhan to Kirman 2 . Between Rudhan and Shahr-i-Babak is the small town of Dih 1 Our authorities state that Aban was 25 leagues from Fahraj (which is five leagues S .E. of Yazd); the town of Ar-Rudhan lay 18 leagues beyond Aban, and Unas was one short march or two post-stages [Bartd) from Ar-Rudhan. Further, Unas lay one long march and two leagues (or one Barid) from Bimand, which last was four leagues west of Sirjan; and from Ar-Rudhan to Shahr-i-Babak was three days' march, the first march being to Kariyat-al-Jamal, 4 Camels' Village.' These distances, plotted out, show that the positions of modern Anar and Bahramabad respectively coincide with medieval Aban and Unas; while the town of Ar-Rudhan, which is presumably the place elsewhere called Adhkan, must have stood between the two, near the modern village of Gulnabad. 1st. 135, 168. I. K. 48. Muk. 457, 473. Yakut confuses the matter: he mentions (iii. 925) the town of Anar as though it were identical with Unas, which from the distances given above is impossible ; Anar is here probably merely a clerical error for Unas, which in another passage (i. 367) he counts as of Kirman. 2 1st. 100, 126.

Shahr-i-Babak, the city of Babak or Papak, father of Ardashir, the first Sassanian monarch, was a town often counted as of Kirman. The place still exists, and it is mentioned by Istakhn, Mukaddasi, and others, who however give us no details. Mustawfi includes it in Kirman, and says that corn, cotton, and dates grew here abundantly. Two stages west of Shahr-i-Babak, on the road to Istakhr, is the small town of Harat, which the Fars Namah couples with Sahik (already mentioned, p. 278). Istakhn speaks of Harat as being, in the 4th (10th) century, larger than Abarkfih; it exported much fruit, according to Mukaddasi, chiefly apples and olives, and had excellent markets, with streets round its mosque, and a fine stream of water traversed its gardens. Harat had but one gate; and Mukaddasi names the little town of Fa^a as of its neighbourhood. Writing in the 7th (13th) century Kazvini states that the Ghubayra plant (possibly the penny-royal) grows abundantly in the gardens of Harat, and when the flowers are in bloom the women of this town were wont, he says, to become wildly excited. To the south-east of Sahik, on the borders of the Darabjird district, is the town of Kutruh, still a place of some importance, where, according to the Fars Namah and Mustawfi (who spells the name Kadni), there were excellent iron mines 1 . 1 Major Sykes {Ten thousand Miles in Persia, p. 78) found the ruins of a fire-temple near Shahr-i-Babak. 1st. 102.

The Darabjird Ktkah was the easternmost of the five districts of Fars, and it almost exactly corresponded with the province of Shabankarah, which, under the Mongol dominion, was divided off from Fars and formed a separate government. The Shaban karah according to the author of the Pars Ndmah (who, however, does not apply this name to the Darabjird district) were a tribe descended from the Padltiyah, a family of Daylamite origin, and they had been of the Ismailian sect of the Shi'ahs. In Saljfik times they and the Kurds had waged successful war against the Atabeg ChaMi, and after the decay of Saljtik power the Shaban karah took possession of the eastern region of Fars, to which they gave their name. The Shabankarah province is mentioned by Marco Polo, under the form of Soncara, as the seventh out of the eight c kingdoms ? into which he divides Persia; the name, however, has again fallen out of use, and this territory is now known as Darabjird 1 . 1 The Book of Ser Marco Polo, Sir H. Yule, London, 1874, 2nd ed., i. 84. Shabankarah appears in the chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir (x. 362) spelt Ash- Shawankarah. The chiefs of the tribe who opposed Atabeg Chauli in the beginning of the 6th (12th) century were Fadluh and his brother Khasru. This last name is probably that more correctly written Hasuyah (possibly for Hasanuyah) in the Fdrs Ndmah.CHAP. XX] FARS. 289 The capital of the district, under the Caliphate, was the city of Darabjird or Darabgird, which Istakhri describes as a walled town with a water-ditch, having four gates, and in the midst of the town stood a rocky hill. Mukaddasi states that the city was cir cular and measured a league across in every direction, its gardens were very fruitful, its markets well supplied, and water ran in channels through the town. Near Darabjird was the celebrated Kubbat-al-Mfimiya, 'the Bitumen or Naphtha Dome,' closed by an iron door and only opened once a year, when an officer of the Sultan went in and gathered in a box the twelve months' accumulation of the precious MClmiya, which was then sealed up and despatched to Shiraz for the royal use. At the beginning of the 6th (12th) century, according to the Fars Darabjird city was then mostly in ruins, though there was a strong fortress in its midst. Round about extended the famous meadow lands (Marghzar) of Darabjird, and in the neighbourhood was a hill where rock salt, of seven colours, was dug out. According to Mustawfi there was a strongly fortified pass near Darabjird, com manded by a great castle, known as Tang-i-Zinah 1 . Under the Shabankarah, the capital of the Darabjird province was removed to Darkan (or Zarkan), to the north of which stood the fortress of Ig (or Avig). The Arab geographers of the 4th (10th) century mention these, writing the names Ad-Darkan or Ad-Darakan and Ij, and Istakhri says there was a mosque in his day in both these places. Mustawfi, who generally spells the name Zarkan, and refers to the castle as the Kal'ah Avig, says that the surrounding district was very fertile, growing cotton, corn, dates, and other fruits. According to him the castle of Avig had been first fortified in Saljuk times by the Khasuyah tribe, and Yakut adds that fruit from here was exported even as far as to the island of Kish (Kays). To the north-east of tg are the town and district of Nayriz (or Niriz) at the eastern end of Bakhtigan ; to which lake, at times, it has given its name. Mukaddasi speaks of the Great Mosque of Nayriz in the market street, and the ruins of this building, bearing 1 1st. 123, 155. Muk. 428. F. N. 68 81 a, 86/;. Mst. 181.

Close to the shore of the lake -•stands the town of Khir (spelt also Khayar and Al-Khayrah), 'which is mentioned, from the 4th (10th) century onwards, as a :stage on the road along the south side of Lake Bakhtigan going from Shiraz to Kirman. Mustawfi and the Fars Namah name the district round Khayrah MishMnat; it was famous for its raisins {kishmish), and both Niriz and Khayrah were protected by strong castles'. Half-way between Khayrah and Ig lies the town of Istahbanat, a name which the Arab geographers also spell Al-Istahbanan or sometimes Al-Isbahanit, which is shortened by the Persians into Istahban. Mustawf! describes it as a town buried in trees, with a strong castle in its vicinity. It had been laid in ruins by the Atabeg ChMli, who had, however, subsequently caused it to be rebuilt; and the castle in the 8th (14th) century was occupied by the Khasiiyah tribe. The town of Fasa, pronounced Pasa by the Persians, was in the 4th (10th) century the second city of the Darabjird district, being almost of the size of Shiraz. It was well built, much cypress- wood being used in the construction of the houses, and was very healthy. The markets were excellent, there was a ditch round the town, which was further defended by a castle, and large suburbs stietched beyond the city gates. Dates, nuts, and oranges in abundance came from its gardens. Mukaddasi states that the Great Mosque, built of burnt brick and with two courts, rivalled that of Medina for splendour. The Mrs speaks of Pasa as being almost of the size of Isfahan. The Shabankarah had ruined it, but the city had been rebuilt by the Atabeg Chailli. Mustawfi adds that anciently the city was called Sasan, and it had been built triangular in plan. Its water-supply, which was abundant, was taken from underground channels, for there were no wells. Shakk Miskahan and Shakk Rudbal (or Rudbar) were of its dependencies, and in the neighbourhood stood the strong castle of Khwadan, where there were great cisterns for storing water 2 . 1 1st. 107, 108, 132, 136, 200.

According to the Pars Namah its district and that of Runiz (or Rubanz) belonged to Fasa; the latter district forming part of the Khasu territory, which Mukaddasi marks as lying one march south-west from Darabjird on the road to Juwaym of Abu Ahmad (see above, p. 254). The earlier geographers give the form of the name as Runij (or Rubanj), and it is probable that this town is identical with the present Khasti (or Kusu). Mustawfi speaks of Kurm and Runiz as two towns enjoying a warm climate with an abundant water-supply; and according to Mukaddasi the KhasH (or Khashu) territory extended far to the eastward, for besides Rilnij it included the towns of Rustak-ar-Rustak, Furg, and Tarum. Mustawfl counts Khasii as belonging to Darabjird 1 . Due south of Rtimz is the small town of Yazdikhwast, which is mentioned by Mukaddasi and YaMt as of the Darabjird dependencies, and south of this again is the city of Lar. Lar is not mentioned by any of the earlier Arab geographers, nor does the name occur in the Fars N which dates from the beginning of the 6th (12th) century. Mustawfi, in the earlier part of the 8th (14th) century, is our first authority to speak of Lar, as the name of a district (yilayat) by the sea, most of its popula tion, he adds, being merchants who were given to sea voyages. Corn, cotton, and dates were grown here. His contemporary Ibn Batfitah visited Lar city about the year 730 (1330), and describes it as a large place, with many gardens and fine markets. Under Shah Shuja' of the Muzaffarid dynasty at the close of the 8th (14th) century, and later under the Timlirid princes, Lar became a mint city, which proves it to have been in those days a place of some size and importance. 1 I.

The pronunciation Rubanj, adopted in the text of Mukaddasi, is apparently on the authority of Yakut (ii. 828), who carefully spells the word letter for letter. The mss. of the Fdrs N and Mustawfi almost invariably give Runiz (for an older form Runij), which is still the name of a district in these parts. It seems probable therefore that Rubanj, as printed in Istakhri and Mukaddasi, is a clerical error, and that by a shifting of the diacritical points we should everywhere read Runij, or Runiz, in the place of Rubanz and Rubanj.292 FARS. [CHAP. Furg, which lies three marches south-east of Darabjird, is still a considerable town. Mukaddasi, who spells the name Furj, states that beside it lay the twin city of Burk, but the two names would appear merely to be variants of the original Persian place-name. The city called Burk stood on a hillock, 'like a camel-hump/ two leagues from the mountains ; it possessed a mosque in the market street, was a fine place and an agreeable residence. Its neighbour, Furg, had a castle on a hill, was not in the 4th (10th) century a large town, but had its own mosque and many baths, water being plentiful in both cities. Very naturally the names of the two cities were often confounded, one replacing the other. The Pars Namah writes the name Purk or Purg, and says that its castle was impregnable, being built of stone and very large. Mustawfi adds that both corn and dates were grown in Burk (as he writes the name) most abundantly. Rustak-ar-Rustak is described by Mukaddasi as a small town with good markets, lying in the midst of a fertile district measuring four leagues across in every direction. It lies one march to the north-west of Furg, on the road to Darabjird 1 . The town of Tarum, also spelt Tarum, like the district of this name in the Jibal province (see above, p. 225), lies two marches east of Furg, on the road to the coast. Mukaddasi refers to its mosque, and praises the markets, gardens, and palm-trees, for a stream ran through the town. Much honey was produced here, and according to the Pars Namah it was nearly the size of Furg, and had a strong castle well supplied with cisterns. From Tarum the caravan road went almost due south to the coast, where lay the port of Siini, or Shahni, over against the island of Hurmuz. Mustawfi names the port Tiisar, but the reading is un certain. The Arab geographers speak of Siirii as a village of fisher men, having no mosque, and dependent for the water-supply on wells dug in the neighbouring hills. There was, Mukaddasi adds, much trade with 'Oman across the gulf, and the place, which he speaks of as a small town, lay exactly on the Kirman frontier 2 . 1 Muk. 428, 454, note n, F. N. 6983^.

At this time, as already stated, the chief port of Persia, on the gulf, was Siraf. This place distributed all imports by sea, and to it were brought rare and precious Indian goods, such as were known collectively in Arabic under the name of Barbahdr. Istakhn gives the imports of Siraf as follows:—aloes-wood (for burning), amber, camphor, precious gems, bamboos, ivory, ebony, paper, sandal-wood, and all kinds of Indian perfumes, drugs, and condiments. In the town itself excellent napkins were made, also linen veils^ and it was a great market for pearls. At all times Fars has been celebrated for the so-called attar of roses ('Afar or 6 Itr in Arabic signifies 'a perfume' or 'essence'), which, of divers qualities, was more especially made from the red roses that grew in the plain round Jur or Firlizabad. The rose- water was exported, Ibn Hawkal writes, to all parts of the world, namely, to India, China, and Khurasan, also to Maghrib or North west Africa, Syria, and Egypt. Besides the essence of roses, Jtir also produced palm-flower water, and special perfumes distilled from southernwood (in Arabic k ay sum, the Artemisia abrotanum), saffron, lily, and willow flowers. The city of Shaptir and its valley produced, according to Mukaddasi, ten different kinds of perfumed oils, or unguents, made from the violet, water-lily (Ninu/ar), narcissus, palm-flower, common lily, jasmine, myrtle, sweet-marjoram, lemon, and orange flowers, and these oils were exported far and wide over the eastern world. The carpets and embroideries of Fars have in all times been celebrated, and in the East, where robes of honour have always been the mark of distinction, specially brocaded stuffs were manu factured for the sole use of the Sultan, on which his name or cypher was embroidered. These were known as Taraz, and the town of Tawwaj was famous for their manufacture, as was also Fasa, where peacock-blue and green stuffs, shot with gold thread, were embroidered for the royal use. The remaining products of Fars may best be grouped under the cities producing them. The looms of Shiraz produced a variety of fine cloths for making cloaks, also gauzes and brocades.294 FARS. [CHAP. and stuffs woven of raw silk {kazz). Jahram was famous for long carpets and woollen rugs, hangings for curtains, and small prayer-carpets, such as were carried to and from the mosque. Besides- the scented oils already mentioned, Shaptir exported various medicaments, as well as sugar-canes, shaddocks, nuts, olives, and other kinds of fruit, and osiers. Kazirtin and Dariz produced linen stuffs and fine gauzes, an imitation of the Egyptian brocades known by the name of dabtk, and fringed towels. Ghundijan, the capital of Dasht Barin, produced carpets, curtains, cushions, and theTaraz embroideries for the Sultan's use. Arrajan was famous for a kind of syrup, made from raisins, which was called dibs, or dushdb. Good soap was also manufactured here, also thicker woollens and napkins, and the town was an emporium for Indian goods {Barbahdr). The neighbouring port of Mahruban exported fish, dates, and excellent water-skins. At Siniz the special kind of gauze known as kassdb was made, also linen stuffs, for which Jannabah was also famed. Istakhr manufactured stuffs for veils, while the towns of the RMhan district produced excellent cloth, a particular kind of sandal called Shimshik, water-skins, and divers condiments. Yazd and AbarMh yielded cotton stuffs. In Darabjird were manufactured all kinds of cloths, fine, medium, and coarse in texture, also embroideries, fine carpets, and matting. Jasmine-oil and perfumes and the aromatic grains found wild here were exported. The Mumiyd or bitumen, from Arrajan and Darabjird, has already been mentioned. Istakhn describes a boneless fish, said to be excellent eating, which lived in the moat of Darabjird. Furg produced much the same commodities, together with dibs-syrup; and the like came from Tarum, where various kinds of water-skins were manufactured and very serviceable buckets. Fasa was especially known for its goat-hair, and raw-silk stuffs, also carpets, rugs, towels, napkins, and silk embroidered hangings, particularly of the famous peacock- blue and green colour, shot with gold thread. Cardamums and dye-stuffs came also from Fasa, and much felt was made, the tents of this material known as khargdh being largely exported. Lastly in Fars, according to Ibn Hawkal, there were silver mines at Nayin; iron and quicksilver were found in the hills ofXX] FARS. 295 Istakhr, besides lead, copper, sulphur, and naphtha in divers regions. No gold-mine was known. Dye-stuffs of various kinds were common throughout Fars, so that the land, he says, was full of dyers and their dye works 1 . The high roads of Fars are described in detail by a long list of authorities, both Arab and Persian, and the distances in these itineraries are generally given in leagues {Jarsakh). Unfortunately Ya'kiibi, one of our best authorities for the Road Books, is entirely wanting for Fars, and Ibn Rustah also for the most part fails us, but beginning with Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah in the 3rd (9th) century, we have Istakhri and Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century, and in the first years of the 6th (12th) century the roads of this province are all minutely given by the Persian author of the Mrs Namah, whose description is for the geography of this period an immense gain which unfortunately is lacking to us for the rest of Persia. Mustawfi, also a Persian authority, registers in the 8th (14th) century the changes effected by the Mongol conquest, and at the close of this century 'Alt of Yazd describes in detail the march of Timur from Ahwaz to Shiraz, which lay along one of the trunk roads. In this province the roads all radiated from Shiraz, and it will be convenient first to describe those leading down to the coast. Siraf, Kays island, and lastly, Hurmuz island, each in turn became the chief port of the Persian Gulf, and the high roads went, down to these, just as at the present day the caravan and post road goes down to Bushire which has now succeeded to the supremacy of Hurmuz. The easternmost of the roads to the coast leads to the port over against the island of Hurmuz, whence also by coasting Hurmuz city on the mainland was reached. Both of these places will be described in Chapter XXH. Leaving Shiraz this road went by Sarvistan and Fasa to Darabjird, Furg, and Tarum, whence turning due south it struck the coast, in early times at Suru, or Shahrii, or, as Mustawfi calls it, Tusar. Not far from here, in Safavid days, the port of Bandar Abbas which still exists was founded, as will be noted later. Gf this road we have five separate accounts 2 . ; 1 1st. 152—155. I. H. 213—215.

After the ruin of this port caravans followed a branch to the south-east at a point half-way down to the coast, the new road leading to the port opposite the island of Kays, and this is the route described by Mustawfi. Mukaddasi also gives an important by-road, going south-west from Darabjird, on the Hurmuz route, to Siraf, and this cuts across the road from Shiraz to Kays island given at a later date by Mustawfi. Starting from Shiraz all these routes went by Kavar to Jiir or Firiizabad. Here the older road branched to the right, going down to Siraf. The road given in the Fars Namah turned to the left at Firiizabad, going by Karzin to Laghir, whence, through Kuran, Siraf was reached. The route given in Mustawfi leaves the city of Firiizabad a few leagues to the eastward, and goes down like the Fdrs Namah road to Laghir, where, branching south-east and to the left, it passed through Faryab and the desert to Huzvl, the port opposite Kays island. Unfortunately this road from Laghir to Huzil is only found in Mustawfi, and the mss. give most uncertain readings for the names of the various stages. Apparently, too, no modern traveller has gone by this road, so that w r e are at a loss for corrections, our maps being here a blank. The cross-road from Darabjird, given by Mukaddasi, goes by Juwaym of Abu Ahmad to Faryab or Barab, a stage on Mustawfi's route, and then to Kuran, on the Fars Namah route, whence it led direct to Siraf 1 . The western road to the coast followed in its upper section the present track from Shiraz to Bushire, for it passed by Kazirun and Dariz to Tawwaj, the important commercial town of the 4th (10th) century, and thence to the port of Jannabah. The Fars Ndmah gives an important variant to this route, going by the Masaram country to Jirrah, and thence by Ghundijan to Tawwaj ; at Ghundijan, however, a branch turning off south went down to the 'port of Najiram, which lies some distance to the west of Siraf. Mustawfi only gives the road westwards from Shiraz as far as Kazirtin, in his day Tawwaj was in ruins, and at that time the chief port on the Persian Gulf was Kays island 2 . 1 1st. 128, 129.

Leaving Shiraz, the high road to Khflzistan, as described in the Road Books, goes north-west by Juwaym (Goyun) to Nawbanjan, and thence through Gunbadh Mallaghan to Arrajan, whence by the great bridge over the Tab river it reached Bustanak on the frontier of Fars. Mukaddasi and the earlier geographers add the distances from Arrajan to the port of Mahruban, and thence south-east along the coast to the port of Simz and on to Jannabah 1 . From Shiraz to Isfahan there were three separate routes in use during the middle-ages. The westernmost turned off to the right, at Juwaym, from the Arrajan road, going to Bay da in the Marvdasht plain, and thence by Ktirad and Kallar to Sumayram and Isfahan. This route is described by Ibn Khurdadbih and Mukaddasi. The middle route is the summer road through the hill country, which goes from Shiraz to Mayin, and thence by Kilshk-i-Zard and Dih Girdii through Yazdikhwast to Isfahan. This road, with some variants in the names of the stages, is given by the earlier Arab geographers and also by the later Persian authorities. The easternmost of the three roads (the winter or caravan road, through the plains) went from Shiraz north-eastward to Istakhr and thence to Dih Bid. Here a main route went off to the right going by Abarkiih to Yazd, while the road to Isfahan turned to the left, and passing through Surmak and Abadah village joined the summer road at Yazdikhwast, whence by Kilmishah Isfahan was reached. This winter road, which at the present time is the usual post-road from Shiraz to Isfahan, is given by Mukaddasi and the Fars Ndmah : the stages to Yazd are enumerated by nearly all our authorities 2 . 1 I.

XX The roads from Shiraz to Shahr-i-Babak and thence on to Sirjan, one of the capitals of Kirman, followed two routes, one to the north of Lake Bakhtigan, the other passing along the southern shore of the lake. The northern route went first from Shiraz to Istakhr (Persepolis), and from here to Shahr-i-Babak we have two roads, one direct by Harat village, the other by Abadah city to Sahik, where it joined the road along the southern shore of the lake. This last left Shiraz, going eastward by the northern side of Lake Mahal 11 to Khurramah, whence by the southern shore of Bakhtigan it reached Khayrah. From here the Fdrs Namah gives the distances of a branch road to Niriz and Kutruh. The main road went from Khayrah to Great Sahik, where, as already said, it was joined by the route from Istakhr along the northern lake shore, and from Great Sahik it crossed a desert tract, going north-east to Shahr-i-Babak. Both by the northern and the southern shore ot Lake Bakhtigan full itineraries exist in the Arab and Persian authorities, but the names of some of the intermediate stages are uncertain, namely of villages that no longer exist at the present day, for the whole of this country has gone out of culti vation and become depopulated since the close of the middle- ages 1 . 200.

Sirjan, the first capital, its position and history. Bardasir, the second capital, now Kirman city. Mahan and its saint. Khabis. Zarand and Kuhbinan, Cobinan of Marco Polo. The province of Kirman, as Istakhri writes, is for the most part of the hot region, only a quarter of the country being mountainous and producing the crops of a cold climate, for the larger part of the province belongs to the Desert, the towns lying singly, and separated one from another by broad stretches of uncultivated land, and not standing clustered in groups as was the case in Fars. Yakut states that under the Saljtiks Kirman had been most populous and flourishing, but already in the yth (13th) century, when he wrote, ruin had set in, lands going out of cultivation. Finally this evil state was rendered permanent by the devastation which resulted from the invasion of Timiir at the close of the 8th (14th) century. Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century divides the province of Kirman into five Ktirahs or districts, called after their chief towns ; namely (i) Bardasir, with the sub-district of Khabis to the north; next (ii) Sirjan, on the Fars frontier; then (hi) Bam and (iv) Nar- masir on the desert border to the east; and lastly (v) Jiruft to the south, running down to the sea-coast of Hurmuz. On the north and east the frontier was the Great Desert, on the south-west the sea- coast, while on the west the Kirman frontier, round about Sirjan, ran out 'like a sleeve' into the lands of the Fars province, as30o KIRMAN. [CHAP. Istakhn puts it, and according to some early accounts Shahr- i-Babak was herein included as of the Kir man province 1 . The present capital of the province is the city of Kirman, the province and its chief town being of the same name, as is so often the case in the East. During the middle-ages, however, the Kirman province had two capitals, namely Sirjan and Bardasir, of which the latter town is identical with the modern city of Kirman, standing near what is still known as the Bardasir district. Sirjan, the older Moslem capital of Kirman, was already the chief city under the Sassanians. The Arab geographers always write the name As-Sirjan or Ash-Shirajan (with the article), and though no town of the name now exists, the district of Sirjan still occupies the western part of the Kirman province, with Sa^dabad for its chief town. The recently discovered ruins at KaPah-i-Sang 2 , on a hill spur some 5 miles to the east of Sa^dabad, on the Baft road, are evidently the site of Sirjan, the ancient capital, for they are those of a great city, and the distances given in the medieval itineraries show that these ruins exactly occupy the position of Sirjan city; and though the modern Sirjan district covers but a portion of the older Kiirah, it has preserved for us the ancient name. After the Arab conquest Sirjan continued to be the capital of the Moslem province until the middle of the 4th (10th) century, when all southern Persia came under the power of the Buyids. The governor they sent to Kirman was a certain Ibn Ilyas, and he for an unknown reason changed his residence to Bardasir (the modern Kirman city), and later, with the transference of all the government offices thither from Sirjan, this last fell to be a place of secondary importance. When Istakhri wrote, however, Sirjan was still the largest city of Kirman. He states that there was little wood used 1 1st. 158, 163, 165. Muk. 460, 461. Yak. iv. 263. 2 Kal f ah-i-Sang, otherwise known as Kal'ah-i-Bayda (the Stone or the White Fort), occupies a limestone hill rising some 300 feet above the plain, and egg- shaped, being about 400 yards in length. The ruins, still surrounded by a low wall of sun-dried brick, built on older foundations, were discovered and first visited by Major Sykes, in [900, who has described them in detail, p. 431 of Ten Thousand Miles in Persia (London, 1902).xxi] kirmAn. 301 in its houses, since these were all built with vaulted roofs. Mukaddasi describes the place under the Buyid rule as larger and more populous than Shiraz. It had two chief markets, the old and the new, and both were full of goods, especially clothes and stuffs for making them, for which it was famous. The streets were well built, and most of the houses had gardens. The city was closed by eight gates (Mukaddasi cites their names, some of which however are uncertainly written in the mss.), and near that called Bab Hakim, 'the Physician's Gate,' 'Adud-ad- Dawlah, the Buyid, had built a great palace. The Friday Mosque stood between the old and the new market, its minaret had been erected by 'Adud-ad-Dawlah, and the water of the town was derived from two underground channels that had been dug in the 3rd (9th) century by 'Amr and Tahir, sons of Layth the Saffarid. Yakut, who states that when he wrote—7th (13th) century— Sirjan was the second city of Kirman and contained forty-five mosques, large and small, asserts that the town in his day was known under the name of Al-Kasran, 'the Two Palaces,' but he gives no explanation. The name of Sirjan frequently occurs in the chronicles of Ibn-al-Athir and Mirkhwand, when relating the history of the Buyids and Saljtlks. Mustawfi, after the Mongol conquest, described it as having a strong castle and its lands grew both cotton and corn. Sirjan afterwards passed into the possession of the Muzaffarid princes, who reigned in Fars at Shiraz, but conquered all Kirman from the Karakhitay dynasty at the beginning of the 8th (14th) century. In the year 789 (1387) Timiir marched into Fars, appeared in force before Shiraz, re ceived the submission of the Muzaffarid princes, and was induced when he left Fars to conquer Irak, to reinstate some of them as tributaries. Left to themselves, however, they fomented rebellion, and in 795 (1393) Timiir again entered Fars, overthrew the Muzaffarid forces in a pitched battle, and appointed his own son Prince 'Omar Shaykh governor of Fars and Kirman. Many districts, however, especially in Kirman, refused to submit to Timiir, and Gudarz, the governor of Sirjan, held out in the name of the Muzaffarids, so that Prince 'Omar Shaykh at last had to send troops to lay formal siege to that stronghold. Accord ing to the account given by 'Ali of Yazd, the Kal'ah (castle) of302 kirmAn. [chap. Sirjan had been recently repaired, so that the place was very strong, and after the lapse of a year, as the siege operations were making no progress, 'Omar Shaykh set out for Sirjan in person, to bring matters to a crisis. He was however at this moment recalled by his father, and met his death by mischance while travelling through Kurdistan to join Timur at the royal camp before Amid in Upper Mesopotamia. This was in 796 (1394) and for another two years Sirjan still held out, the garrison ultimately yielding to famine rather than to force of arms; and by order of Timur, when Gudarz at length did surrender, he and his few remaining soldiers were all massacred in cold blood, as a warning to the disaffected throughout the province. Sirjan was left a ruin, and though H^fiz Abrii, writing in the reign of the successor of Timtir, still speaks of Sirjan as the second city of Kirman (second to Bardasir), with a strong castle crowning a high rock, the name of Sirjan after this date disappears from history, and its exact site has only quite recently been discovered in the ruins of Kal'ah-i-Sang, as already said 1 . As mentioned above, the modern capital of the province is Kirman city, and this, though not the first Moslem capital, appears to have been an important town from early Sassanian 1 1st. 166.

The position of Sirjan is given by the Arab geographers in marches from various known places, often with an equivalent total in farsakhs or leagues. Unfortunately in the Kirman province the stage-by-stage itineraries, with details of places passed (as we have for the Jibal province, and the whole of Pars), are lacking. The following, however, is a summary of the distances recorded, and they agree with the position of Kal'ah-i-Sang for Sirjan city. From Shahr-i-Babak on the north-west, where the high roads coming up from Shiraz and Istakhr united, Sirjan was distant 24 and 32 leagues by different roads, and it was 38 to 46 leagues, or three long marches, from Great Sahik. From Rustak-ar- Rustak (one short day's march north-west of Furg) Sirjan was four marches, . and from Nlrtz five and a half marches distant. Going east and south-east, the road from Sirjan to Jiruft measures six marches or 54 leagues; while to Rayin it was five marches, and to Sarvistan (to the south-east of Rayin) 45 or 47 leagues. Finally, from Sirjan to Mahan was counted as three marches, and to Bardasir (Kirman city) two marches. The authorities for these distances are as follows I. K. 48, 49, 53, 54. Kud. 195, 196. I. F. 206, 208. 1st. 131, 13S, 168, 169. Muk. 455, 464, 473.XXI] KIRMAN. 303 times. In regard to its origin, we have it stated by Hamzah of Isfahan, an historian of the 4th (10th) century, that King Ardashir, the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, built a city called Bih- Ardashir, meaning ' the good place of Ardashir'; this name the Arabs corrupted in their pronunciation to Bihrasir (or Bihdasir) and Bardasir (or Bardashir); while the Persians, as Mukaddasi informs us, pronounced it Guwashir, from Wih-Artakhshir the more archaic form of Bih-Ardashir. Yakut adds that the name was in his day spelt Juwasir, Juwashir, or Gawashir, these being all equivalent to, and used indifferently with, the Arabic form Bardasir 1 . This city of Bardasir, which became the new capital of the Kirman province under the Buyids, is without doubt identical in every respect with the modern city of Kirman, as is proved by its position as given in the Itineraries, and from the description by the Arab geographers of various buildings in Bardasir, and natural features, all of which still exist, and are to be recognised in Kirman city. The Arab and Persian chronicles, it will be seen, fully bear out the identification, for after the 4th (10th) century Bardasir, indifferently called Guwashir, becomes in their narratives the capital of Kirman, and these names are in time replaced by ' the city of Kirman,' or briefly Kirman, the province—as is so often the case—giving its name to the capital. Mukaddasi, writing at some length upon Bardasir, describes it, at the time when the Buyid governor had made it the new capital, as a well-fortified though not a very large city. Outside the town was a great castle (Ival'ah) standing high up on a hill with gardens, where there was a deep well, dug by the governor Ibn Ilyas, and hither the aforesaid Ibn Ilyas was accustomed to ride up every night to sleep on the height. At the town gate was a second fortress (Hisn) surrounded by a ditch, which was crossed by a bridge; and in the centre of the town was a third castle (Kal'ah) overlooking the houses, alongside of which 1 Hamzah, 46. Muk. 460, 461. Yak. i. 555 ; ii. 927 ; iv. 265. The pronunciation Yazdashir sometimes given is merely a clerical error, from a mis-setting of the diacritical points in the Arabic writing. At the present day Bardasir is the name of the small district lying to the south-west of modern Kirman city, of which the chief town is Mashiz. As the name of a town Bardasir is unknown. For another instance of Bih or Wih in Persian place- names, see above p. 262, note.304 KIRMAN. [CHAP. stood the Great Mosque, a magnificent building. The city had four gates, the first three being called after the towns whither their roads led, namely, Bab Mahan, Bab Khabis, and Bab Zarand; the fourth was the Bab Mubarik, 4 the Blessed Gate,' or possibly so called after somebody of the name of Mubarik, or Mubarak. Mukaddasi adds that the place was full of gardens, wells were common, and underground channels gave an abundant water- supply 1 . From the time when Ibn Ilyas in the reign of ^dud-ad- Dawlah removed the government offices (Divan) to Bardasir, this town, as already said, remained the chief capital of Kirman, and followed the fortunes of the province, which, as a rule, was annexed by whoever was the ruler of Fars. In the early part of the 5th (nth) century, the Buyids fell before the rising power of the Saljilks, who were masters of the Kirman province from 433 to 583 (1041 to 1187). Under them, though Sirjan is one of their chief cities, Bardasir continued as the 4 Dar-al-Mulk ? or official capital of this governorship. In the Saljtik chronicle written by Ibn Ibrahim the name of the capital is given some times as Bardasir, sometimes as Guwashir; while in the corresponding chapters of the Raw da t- as-Sa/d, Mirkhwand in variably refers to the Saljiik capital as 4 the city of Kirman,' or more briefly as Kirman, and the name Bardasir is nowhere men tioned by him. The two names, therefore—Bardasir and Kirman —were for a time used indifferently to denote one and the same place. Ibn-al-Athir, for example, under the year 494 (noi), relates how Iran Shah the Saljtik was expelled 4 from the city of Bardasir, which same is the city of Kirman 2 .' In 583 (1187) the province of Kirman was overrun by the 1 Muk. 461. 2 Ibn-al-Athir, x. 219. This passage has a fallacious appearance of being conclusive evidence that Bardasir was later Kirman city. But though the fact is beyond doubt from both history and topography this passage is no real proof of it, for ' the city of Kirman' (Madmah Kirmdri) merely means the capital (city) of Kirman (province), and is ambiguous. In an earlier volume &gt; Ibn-al-Athir (iii. 100) relating how, under the Caliphate of 'Omar, Sirjan was first taken by the Arab armies, adds the words 4 which same is the (capital) city of Kirman' [Madinah Kirmdn), though Sirjan certainly is not the modem city of Kirman, as might be inferred at first sight from this passage.XXI] KIDMAN. 305 Ghuzz Turkomans, who plundered and half-ruined Bardasir, and temporarily made Zarand the capital of the province. The power of the Saljfiks was then on the wane, and in 619 (1222) all Kirman passed under the sway of the short-lived dynasty generally known as the Karakhitay. Kutluk Khan, the first prince of this line, is described by Mirkhwand as taking possession of c the city of Kirman,' and later it is stated that he was buried in the Madrasah, or college, which he himself had caused to be built 'in the quarter called Turkabad, outside the city of Kirman. ? On the other hand, both Mustawfi in his Guztdah, and Ibn Ibrahim in the Saljiik chronicle, state that Kutluk Khan, in the year 619 (1222), took possession of 4 the city of Bardasir' (or Guwashir as the Guzidah has it), thus becoming ruler of all the Kirman kingdom. Lastly the contemporary authority of Yak lit gives Bardasir as the name at this time (13th century a.d.) of the capital of Kirman 1 . The Mongol conquest of Persia did not materially affect Kirman, and the daughter of the last prince of the Karakhitay in the first years of the 8th (14th) century married the Muzaffarid ruler of Fars, who afterwards took over the province of Kirman,. under Mongol overlordship. Mustawfi, speaking of the capital Guwashir, otherwise Bardashir, describes the Old Mosque as dating from the close of the 1st century of the Hijrah, and the reign of the Omayyad Caliph 'Omar II, who died in 720 a.d. He also speaks of the garden laid out by the Buyid governor Ibn Ilyas, called Bagh-i-Sirjani, namely, 4 the garden of him who came from Sirjan,' which when he wrote in 730 (1330) was still flourishing. Ibn Ilyas, Mustawfi adds, had also built the castle on the hill, already recorded as having been described by Mu- kaddasi, and within the town there was the mosque called the Jami'-i-Tabrizi, founded by Ttiran Shah, the Saljiik, and the celebrated shrine over the grave of the saint Shah Shuja c Kirmam. A somewhat later authority, Hafiz Abrli, states that Turkhan Khattin, daughter of Kutluk Khan of the Karakhitay, in the year 666 (1268), erected a magnificent Jami' (Friday Mosque) in 1 Mst.

Kirman, besides other mosques and colleges, one of which will be noticed presently; and the same author, writing in 820 (1417), refers to the city indifferently under the two names of Bardasir (or Guwashir) and Kirman 1 . These descriptions of Bardasir given by our various authori ties, from Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century down to Hafiz Abril in the early part of the 9th (15th) century, clearly refer to many of the buildings that still exist, mostly in ruin, in the present city of Kirman. Thus, as we have seen, Mukaddasi mentions the three fortresses or castles for which the city was famous, and in the Saljilk chronicle frequent reference is made by Ibn Ibrahim to the castle on the hill (Kal'ah-i-Kiih), to the old castle, and to the new castle,—which are evidently identical with the three places described by Mukaddasi. In modern Kirman we find that there is, in the first place, an ancient fortress crowning the hill near, and to the east of the city, now generally known as the Kal'at-i-Dukhtar or the ' Maiden's Fort,'' which is attributed to King Ardashir in the popular belief. Next, still further to the south-east, is a second hill, fortified of old with walls and towers, now crumbling to ruin, which is known as Kal'ah Ardashir, and this must be the fortress 'outside the city gate'; while, lastly, the older fortress, within the town, doubtless stood on the site of the present governor's palace 2 . 1 he mosque of Ttiran Shah, mentioned by Mustawfi, still exists under the name of Masjid-i-Malik; while another building, connecting Kirman city with the time when it was still called Bardasir, is the magnificent green (or blue) dome, the K u bbat- i-Sabz, which, until quite recently, covered the tomb of Turkhan Khattin, the daughter of Kutluk Khan, already mentioned, of the K^rakhitay. This princess, as history relates, some time after her father's death, ousted her brother from the throne, and then during twenty-five years remained virtual ruler of Kirman, governing in the name of her husband—a nephew of Kutluk Khan and of her two sons, whom in turn she allowed nominally to succeed to the throne. Mirkhwand states that she died 1 Mst 182. Hfz. 139^, 140^. 2 A plan of Kirman city is given by Major Sykes (p. 188), also a view of these two ancient forts (p. 190), in Ten Persia.20- xxi] kirmAn.

The green dome within which her tomb was placed bore an inscription on its walls, giving the names of the architects, with the date 640 (1242) when the building was completed, namely during the nominal reign of the son of Kutluk; Khan, whom his sister Turkhan Khatun afterwards set aside J. Of other towns in the Bardasir district the Arab geographers give on the whole but meagre accounts; groups of villages, so common in Fars, did not exist, and generally in Kirman each town was separated from its neighbour by a wide stretch of desert country. A score of miles to the south-west of Kirman city lies Baghin, and a like distance beyond this Mashiz, both on the road from Kirman to Sirjan. At the present time these are the only towm in this quarter, and both are frequently mentioned by Ibn Ibrahim, in the Saljuk chronicle, when relating events of the latter half of the 4th (10th) century. It is curious therefore that neither Baghin nor Mashiz should be mentioned by any of the earlier Arab geographers, nor by Mustawfi, nor, apparently, by any of the Persian authorities who have described the campaigns of Timflr. Two short marches to the south-east of Kirman city lies the town of Mahan, at the present day celebrated for the shrine at the tomb of Ni'mat-Allah, the SClfi saint and 'Nostradamus' of ersia, whose prophecies are still current throughout Moslem Asia. He died in 834 (1431) aged over a hundred years, and is said to have been a friend of the poet Hafiz. In the 4th (roth) century Mukaddasi describes Mahan as a town chiefly inhabited by Arabs. 1 he mosque was near the fortress, which, surrounded by a ditch, stood in the middle of the town; and for a day's march around the land was covered with gardens which were irrigated from a stream of running water. The Kubbat-i-Sabz was completely ruined by an earthquake in 1806. It is escnbed by Major Sykes, who gives an illustration p. 264) representing he building as he saw it before the earthquake.

Ghubayra and Kughun, two towns lying one league apart, of which apparently no trace remains at the present day, were to the south of Mahan, being one march west of Rayin (which still exists). In the 4th (10th) century Mukaddasi de scribes Ghubayra as a small town surrounded by villages, with a fortress in its midst, while outside was the market recently built by the Buyid governor Ibn Hyas, already many times mentioned. Both this place and Kfighftn had fine mosques and the water was from underground channels. Some fifty miles east of Kirman, and on the borders of the Great Desert, lies Khabls, which was counted as three marches distant from Mahan. The level was low, for the desert is here far below the plateau of central Persia on which the city of Kirman stands, and Khabis, as Istakhri remarks, is very hot, and the date palm was conse quently much grown. Mukaddasi adds that there was a fortress here, and the town had four gates. It was very populous, much silk was manufactured, for the gardens were celebrated for their mulberry-trees, being watered by a stream that passed through the town. Excellent dates, too, were exported . Two marches to the north-west of Kirman is the city of Zarand, and half-way between the two, during the middle-ages, lay the town of Janzariidh, of which apparently no trace remains. Mukaddasi describes JanzarMh as possessing a mosque standing in the market, where abundance of fruit was sold, for the town was on a river, the Janz. Zarand still exists, and Mukaddasi speaks of the castle near by, which Ibn Ilyas, the governor, had recently built. Zarand was in the 4th (10th) century a place of considerable size, it had six town gates, and the mosque was in the Maydan or public square, which was surrounded by market streets. Here a kind of fine gauze, used for linings and called was made. These Zarandi gauzes were largely exported to Pars and 'Irak, and in the 4th (10th) century were in great repute. 1 Ibn Ibrahim, 66, 108, 109,121. 1st. 234. Muk.462,463. Col.C. E. Yate, Khurasan and Sis tan, p. 11. Major Sykes (Persia, p. 41) found a grave-stone in Khabis dated 173 (789), also the ruins of a building that appears to have been a Christian church, or some non-Moslem shrine. As of the Khabis sub- district Mukaddasi (p. 460) mentions the four towns of Nashk, Kashld, Kuk, and Kathrawa, but no details are given of position, and apparently all trace of them is now lost.XXI] KJRMAN. 309 Fifty miles north of Zarand lies Ravar on the border of the Great Desert, and west of this is Kubinan, which was visited by Marco Polo. Both towns are described by Mukaddasi, who says that Ravar in the 4th (10th) century was larger than Kubinan, and had a strong fortress, which served to protect the frontier. KCibinan or Kuhbanan he speaks of as a small town with two gates, and a suburb where there were baths and caravanserais. The mosque was at one of the town gates, and was surrounded by gardens which stretched to the foot of the neighbouring mountains. In the vicinity is the town of Bihabad, a name which Mukaddast writes Bihavadh, and he couples it with Kavak, a populous hamlet, which lay three leagues distant, both places being of the cold region and possessing many gardens. Bihabad still exists, but Kavak no longer appears on the map. Yakut in the 7th (13th) century states that both Klihbanan and Bihabad were in his day celebrated for the or tutty ^an impure oxide of zinc), which was manufactured and exported hence to all countries. Mustawfi in the next century also refers to Kuhbinan, which Marco Polo, his contemporary, calls 'the city of Cobinan,' and the Venetian traveller carefully describes the manufacture here of the tutty, ' a thing very good for the eyes.' Already in the 4th (icth) century this was one of the notable exports of the Kirman province, and Mukaddasi states that because it came out of the crucible in finger-like pieces, it was commonly known as Tictiya Murazt cannular tutty.' These bunches of ' pipes,' he says, were separated one from another by water being poured over the hot mass, and it was purified by being roasted in long furnaces which he himself had seen built on the mountain side, near where the ore was extracted. The same was done also in the case of iron 1 . 1 1st. 233. I. H. 224, 292. Muk. 462, 470, 493. Yak. i. 767 ; iv. 316. Mst. 183. See The Book of Ser Marco Polo, Yule, i. 127—130, for the descrip tion of the manufacture of tutty, which Major Sykes {Persia, p. 272) saw made in Kuhbanan at the present time, and in the identical manner above described. The name of Kavar is often miswritten Zdvar by a clerical error; and similarly Kuhbanan appears under the forms of Kuhaydn and ICuhbaydn from a misplacing of the diacritical points. Bandn is the Persian name for the wild pistachio, Kuhbanan therefore signifying the mountain where this tree grows.KIRMAN. [CHAP. XXI Some fifty miles west of Kvlhbanan, and on the edge of the desert half-way between that town and Yazd, lies at the present day the hamlet of Bafk. There are in the Kirman province two towns of very similar names, Bafk aforesaid, and Baft or Bafd, the latter lying 80 miles south of Kirman city, and 200 miles distant from the northern Bafk. The confusion is worse confounded by the fact that (northern) Bafk is often now pronounced Bafd, and hence is identical in name with the town south of Mashiz, for dialectically the change of the dotted k into d or / is common in Persian. A town of Bafd is mentioned by YakM as a small city of the Kirman province, lying on the road to Shiraz, and of the hot country. Ibn Ibrahim in the Saljuk chronicle mentions the names of both Baft and Bafk, but neither by him nor by YaMt are details afforded sufficient to identify the places 1 . 1 Yak. i. 474. A. F. 336.

The Sirjan district—of which Sirjan city, the older capital of the Kirman province, which has already been described in the previous chapter, was the chief town—lay to the west of the Bardasir district, and on the frontier of Fars. Mukaddast mentions a number of towns in this district which now, unfortu nately, no longer appear on the map, though their positions in relation to the site of Sirjan city are known. Pour leagues west of Sirjan, and close to the Fars frontier, was Bimand, described in the 4th (10th) century as an impreg nable fortress, having iron gates. It was a place of importance too, as being the point of junction of the three high roads— from Shahr-i-Babak (north), from Rudhan (north-east), and from Sahik (west)—whence these all converged on Sirjan. Mukaddasl describes Bimand as having a Great Mosque standing in the middle of its market street, and its water was from underground channels. Then one day s march to the east of Sirjan, on the road to Rayin, was a place called Shamat, a town with many gardens and vineyards, exporting much fruit to outlying villages, and with a Friday Mosque standing in its midst. The town also bore the alternative name of Kuhistan. One march again east of Shamat was Bahar, and another day's march led to Khannab, both places growing many dates. Beyond Khannab lay Ghubayra, already312 KIRMAN. [chap. described as of the Bardasir district. Two days' march to the south-east of Sirjan, on the road to Jiruft, stood a town the name of which is written either Vajib or Najat (with some other variants). Mukaddasi describes it as a very pleasant and populous place with many gardens, the water being supplied by underground channels, and the Great Mosque standing in the midst of its market streets 1 . The district of Bam (or Bamm, as the Arab geographers write it), surrounding the town of this name, lies to the south-east of Mahan, at the border of the (Sreat Desert, on the eastern frontier of Kirman. Ibn Hawkal describes Bam in the 4th (10th) century as larger and healthier than Jiruft, the town being surrounded by palm-groves. Near by stood the celebrated castle of Bam, held to be impregnable, and there were three mosques, the Masjid-al-Khawarij, the Mosque of the Clothiers (Al-Bazzazin), and the Castle Mosque. Cotton stuffs were largely manufactured here and exported ; also napkins, the cloths for turbans, and the scarfs for head-wear known as Taylasdn, Mukaddasi records that the city wall, which made a strong fortification, had four gates, namely, Bab Narmasir, Bab Ktiskan, Bab Asbikan, and Bab Kurjin. There were great markets both within the city and outside in the suburbs, while on the river which passed by the castle was the market of the Jarjan bridge. A celebrated bath house stood in the Willow street (Zukak-al-Bidh). A league distant from Bam was the mountain called Jabal KM, where there were mills, surrounded by a large village, and where much cloth was manufactured. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century still refers to the strong castle of Bam, and speaks of its climate as rather hot 2 . Rayin, lying due south of Mahan, and about 70 miles north west of Bam, is described by Mukaddasi as a small town, with its 1 I. K. 49, 54. 1st. 168, 169. Muk. 464, 465. For Najat Ibn Hawkal reads Ndjtah^ and Bdkhtah, Fdkhtah, or Kdkhtah, are the variants in Ibn Khurdadbih ; all of which may possibly be merely clerical errors for Baft, the town mentioned in the last chapter (p. 310), which still exists approximately in the position indicated. 2 The ancient fort of Bam, which stands at the present day, is described by Major Sykes (Persia, pp. 216, 218). The ruins of the medieval town are on the river bank at Guzaran, about a mile distant from the fort.XXII] KIRMAN. 313 mosque standing in the market-place, and gardens extending all round the habitations. At one-third of the way from Rayin to Bam stood the neighbouring towns of Avarik and Mihrkird (or Mihrijird), of which the former still exists, the name being now pronounced Abarik. Between the two, in the 4th (10th) century, stood a castle built by the Buyid governor, Ibn Ilyas. The water- supply was from a river, and the houses were clay-built. Between Abarik and Bam stands Daharzin, which Mukaddasi writes Damn, other spellings being Darjin and Daynlzin. It had a fine Friday Mosque, and was a pleasant place, surrounded by gardens irrigated from a neighbouring stream 1 . The Narmasir district (in Persian Narmashir) lay south-east of Bam and on the desert border; its capital, the city of Narmasir, stood half-way between Bam and Fahraj. Fahraj still exists and in the 4th (10th) century, Narmasir was an important town; Mukaddasi speaks of its many fine palaces, and of its numerous population. Merchants from Khurasan trading with 'Oman lived here, for Narmasir stood on the Pilgrim road from Sistan to Mecca and was a mart for Indian goods. Narmasir was then smaller than Sirjan, but fortified, and it had four gates, Bab Bam, Bab Stirkan, the Gate of the Oratory (Musalla), and lastly the Gate of the Kiosque (Ktishk). The Friday Mosque was in the midst of the markets. To its gate was an ascent of ten steps of burnt-brick stairway, and a fine minaret, famous in all the country round, towered above. The castle was known as the KaPah Kfish-va-Ran (the name unexplained), and at the Bam gate were three forts called Al-Akhwat, £ the Sisters/ Palm-groves and gardens surrounded the town. At the present day no town of Narmasir appears on the map, but the ruins at the site called Chugukabad, ' Sparrow-town,' lying on the right bank of the sluggish river which winds through the Narmasir plain, must be the remains of the great medieval city. The place is now a complete wilderness, though as late as the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi still refers to Narmasir as a populous city. Twenty miles due south of Fahraj is Rikan (also spelt Rikan or Righan), the fortifications of which Mukaddasi describes. The 1 I. H. 223, 224. Muk. 465, 466, 470. Mst. 182. Yak. iv. 700.

Mustawfi refers to it as a very hot place, where dates and corn were grown abundantly. Between Righan and Bam stands Kurk, which Mukaddasi couples with the neighbouring town of Bahar (not to be confounded with the differently spelt Bahar of Sirjan, see p. 311), and both were populous towns in the 4th (10th) century, being surrounded by palm-groves. The town of Nisa was also of the Narmasir district, but its position is unknown. It is stated that it had gardens in the plain, and a mosque in its market-place, and it w T as watered by a river \ The whole of the southern half of the Kirman province, and down to the coast, was included in the district of Jiruft. Jiruft (or Jayruft) during the middle-ages was a city of much importance, and past it ran the only river which the Arab geographers mention by name in this province. The ruins of Jiruft (the name is now preserved in the Jiruft district only) are those now known as the Shahr-i-Dakiyantis, 4 the City of the Emperor Decius,' who figures as a proverbial tyrant in the East, for in his reign the Seven Sleepers entered the Cave, as mentioned in the Kuran (chapter xviii, v. 8, and see above, p. 155), the story being amplified of course in the popular legends. Near these ruins runs the stream now known as the Khalil RM (or Halil Riid), which the Arab and Persian geographers name the Div RM, 'the Demon Stream/ from its swiftness. It is an affluent of the Bamptir river, and drains east to the Hamun or swamp. In the 4th (icth) century Ibn Hawkal describes Jiruft as a great city, measuring two miles across, 4 the mart of Khurasan and Sijistan,' lying in a fruitful neighbourhood where the crops of both the hot and the cold regions were grown. The chief exports of the city were indigo, cardamoms, sugar-candy, and the dushab or raisin syrup. The surrounding district was called Al-Mizan (Istakhri writes Al-Mijan), where the numerous gardens produced dates, nuts, and oranges. Snow came from the neighbouring hills, and water was supplied by the Div RM, which made a great 1 I. K. 49. Muk. 463, 464.

Provisions were also brought into the city from the neighbouring valley of Darfarid, and according to Mukaddasi the sweet melons from here and the narcissus flowers, from which a perfume was made, w r ere both celebrated. The town itself, which had a fortified wall, was closed by four gates, namely, Bab Shapur, Bab Bam, Bab Sirjan, and Bab-al-Musalla, 'the Oratory Gate.' The Great Mosque, built of burnt brick, was near the Bam gate, at some distance from the market streets. Mukaddasi adds that Jiruft was in his time a larger city than Istakhr, and that its houses were mostly built of clay bricks on stone foundations. Yakiit states that the fertile district round Jiruft was called Jirdtis, and Mustawfi refers to the lion-haunted forests which had originally surrounded the town, but which in his day had given place to immense palm-groves. Ibn Ibrahim in the Saljiik chronicle during the 6th (12th) century frequently refers to Kamadin, 4 a place at the gate of Jiruft where foreign merchants from Rum (Greece) and Hind had their warehouses and where travellers by sea and land could store their goods'; and in another passage he mentions the 'precious goods from China, Transoxiana, and Khitay, from Hindustan and Khurasan, from Zanzibar, Abyssinia, and Egypt, also from Greece, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Adharbayjan,' which were all to be found for buying and selling in the storehouses of Kamadin. The Persian Kamadin is the place mentioned by Marco Polo under the name of Camadi, or the 'city of Camadi.' It had been formerly 'a great and noble place,' but when Marco Polo visited it 'was of little consequence, for the Tartars in their incursions have several times ravaged it.' This explains why both Jiruft and Kamadin, after the close of the 7th (13th) century, disappear from history, and the map no longer bears these names. Round Jiruft was the Riidhbar district, mentioned by the Arab geo graphers, which reappears in Marco Polo under the name of ' ReobarlesV 1 For the ruins of Shahr-i-Dakiyanus, lying on the right bank of the Halil Rud, a short distance to the west of modern Sarjaz, see Keith Abbott in J.R.

One march to the north-east of Jiruft, and half-way to Darjin, lay the large hamlet of Hurmuz-al-Malik ( £ of the King/ so called to distinguish it from the port of Hurmuz), which was also known as Kariyat-al-Jawz, 4 Nut Village.' According to Idrisi—but it is not clear whence he got his account—this was an ancient city founded by the Sassanian king Hurmuz in the third century a.d., and it had been the chief town of the province of Kirman, until, falling to ruin, the administration had been transferred to Sirjan, which remained the capital of the province under the later Sassanians. The position of Hurmuz-al-Malik is indicated by Mukaddasi and other early geographers, but they give no details; Idnsi adds that in his day (or more probably in the time of the unknown author from whom he takes his account) this Hurmuz was a handsome though small town, inhabited by a mixed popu lation, having abundant water, and good markets with much merchandise. It lay, he says, one march distant from Bam 1 . A day's march to the north of the ruins of Jiruft lies Dilfarid, which Mukaddasi calls Darfani, and Ibn Hawkal Darfarid. It lay in a fruitful valley producing crops of both the hot and cold regions, and, as already stated, was the granary of Jiruft. One march to the north-west of this again was the Jabal-al-Ma'adin— 4 Hill of Mines J —where silver was found, more especially in a gorge that ran up into the Jabal-al-Fuddah or 'Silver Hill 2 .' To the eastward of Jiruft was the hill country called Jabal Bariz, described as clothed with great forests in the 4th (10th) century, and here at the time of the first Moslem conquest the hunted Magians had found safe refuge from the troops sent against them by the Omayyad Caliphs. This country was only brought under the Moslem yoke by the Saffarid princes; it was afterwards famous for its iron mines. Nearer the coast, and to 470. Yak. ii. 57. Mst. 182. Ibn Ibrahim, 48, 49, 83.

Of the robber tribes of the Kufs mention will be made later when describing the Great Desert. Part of this outlying country was known as Al-Khawash, namely of the tribes called Al-Akhwash. These were camel-men, who lived in a valley where by reason of the heat much sugar-cane was grown for export to Sijistan and Khurasan—this being the tract of mountainous country which intervenes between the southern end of the Great Desert and Makran. In these highlands were seven separate mountains, each ruled, it was said, by its own chief, and 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buy id, in the 4th (10th) century, had made an expedition to conquer them. These people then had no horses, they were regarded as of the Kurds, for they owned flocks and herds, lived in hair-tents and possessed no cities. The date palm flourished abundantly in the lower regions of this country 1 . Some fifty miles south-west of Jiruft lies Gulashkird, which Mukaddasi writes Valashgird, stating that it was a strongly fortified town protected by a castle known as Kiishah, and with its gardens irrigated by underground watercourses. Maghdn, a town with many gardens growing orange-trees and the indigo plant, lay one march north of Valashgird towards Jiruft ; its ruins are pro bably those now known as Fariyab or Pariyab 2 . Fifty miles south of Valashgird was the important town of Mantikan, now called Manfrjan, which Mukaddasi refers to as ' the Basrah of Kirman' to mark its commercial importance. The town consisted of two opposite quarters, divided by the dry gorge called Kalan ; one quarter was called Ktinin, the other Zaman, and a fort, which still exists, stood between the two, with the mosque known as the 1 Khwash is now the chief town of the Sarhad, a mountainous district described by Major Sykes {Persia, pp. 130, 353), which lies to the east of Narmashir. 1st. 163, 164, 168.

[CHAP. Jami' Sayyan. One march from here, in the sandy plains nearer the coast, was the town of Darahkan; no trace of which, however, now appears to exist. There was a mosque in the town, and its gardens produced much indigo, water being procured by under ground channels. Between Valashgird and Maniijan runs a river with many tributaries, now known as the Rfidkhanah-i-Duzdi: it is mentioned by Istakhri as the Nahr-az-Zankan, and by YaMt as the Raghan river. Mukaddasi refers to the populous town of RMhkan, which probably stood on its course, as surrounded by gardens growing date palms and orange-trees. To the north-east of Mantikan, and on the road to Rigan, being three marches from the port of Hurmuz, stood the twin cities of Bas and Jakin, each with its mosque and market. Nahr or JHy-Sulayman (Solomon's Brook), a popu lous town, one march west of Rigan, is referred to by Mukaddasi as of the Jiruft district. Its fertile lands were watered by a stream which ran through the town, in the centre of which stood a mosque and a castle. Lastly, in the northern part of the mountainous district of Jabal-al-Kufs, Mukaddasi mentions the town of Kiihistan, for distinction called after a certain Abu Ghanim. It was very hot, and palm-groves grew all round the town, in the midst of which was a castle beside the mosque 1 . Old Hurmuz, or Hurmuz of the mainland, lay at a distance of two post-stages, or half a day's march, from the coast, at the head of a creek called Al-Jir, according to Istakhri, 4 by which aft^r one league ships come up thereto from the sea,' and the ruins of the town are still to be seen at the place now known as Minab, vulgarly Minao. In the 4th (10th) century Old Hurmuz was already the seaport for Kirman and Sijistan, and in later times, when New Hurmuz had been built on the island, this place supplanted Kays, just as Kays had previously supplanted Siraf, and became the chief emporium of the Persian Gulf. Istakhri speaks of the mosque and the great warehouses of (Old) Hurmuz, many of the latter being in the outlying villages, two leagues from the town. Palm-groves were numerous and dhurrah was cultivated, also indigo, cummin, and the sugar-cane. Mukaddasi praises the markets of Hurmuz, its water was from underground 1 1st. 169. Muk. 466, 467.

On the sea-shore, half a day's march distant, was Al-'Arsah, 4 the Camp/ presumably at the entrance of the Hurmuz creek. The adjacent island is mentioned by Ibn Khurdadbih, in the middle of the 3rd (9th) century, under the name Urmfiz (which Mustawfi spells Urmfis), and this is doubtless the later island of Jirtln. At the beginning of the 8th (r4th) century—one authority gives the year 715 (1315)—the king of Hurmuz, because of the constant incursions of robber tribes, abandoned the city on the mainland, and founded New Hurmuz on the island aforesaid called Jiriln (or Zarfln), which lay one league distant from the shore. At this period New Hurmuz was visited by Ibn Batiitah, and it is described by his contemporary Mustawfi, who notes the abundance of the date palms and sugar-cane growing here. Ibn Badkah states that Old Hurmuz in his day was known as Mtighistan, and the new town had taken the name of the island, being called Jiriln. It had a Friday Mosque, and fine markets^ where goods from Sind and India were brought for sale. At the close of the 8th (14th) century, Timiir ordered an expedition against the coast towns near Old Hurmuz, and seven castles in its neighbourhood were all taken and burnt, their garrisons escaping to the island of JirCm. These seven castles, as enumerated by £ Ali of Yazd, were, KaPah-Mina, 'the Castle of the Creek,' at Old Hurmuz, Tang-Zandan, Kushkak, Hisar- Shamil, Kal'ah-Manfijan (the town already mentioned), Tarzak, and Taziyan. In 920 (1514) Hurmuz, more generally called Ormuz, was taken by the Portuguese under Albuquerque, and their port of landing on the mainland became celebrated under the name of Gombroon. This is the place which a century later Shah 'Abbas renamed Bandar 'Abbas; it is the present harbour for Kirman, and probably occupies the position of Stirti or Shahril mentioned above in the chapter on Fars. The name Gombroon is said to be a corruption of Gumruk (from the Greek Kou/xcp/a), which became the common term for a 6 custom-house' throughout the East. In the Turkish Jahan Numd it is referred to as 4 GumrCi, the port of Hurmuz, whence to the city of Lar (in Fars) it is four or five days' march 1 .' 1 I. K. 62. 1st. 163, 166, 167. I.

Kirman as a whole, Mukaddasi states, grew dates and dhurrah as food-stuffs; dates were exported to Khurasan, and indigo to Fars, while the cereal crops raised in the Valashgird district were taken down to Hurmuz, and thence shipped to more distant countries 1 . The geographers of the 3rd and 4th (9th and 10th) centuries give far less detail concerning the high roads of Kirman than is the case when they are treating of the Fars province. Further, as a rule, only the inexact measurement of the day's march {marhalah) is given, and for most of the roads the reckoning from stage to stage in leagues {farsakh) is wanting. The roads from Fars into Kirman converged on Bimand, which, as already said, lay four leagues to the west of Sirjan. From the north-east, one road from Unas and the RMhan district came down to Bimand (given by both Istakhri and Mukaddasi); while from Great Sahik to Bimand (and Sirjan) we have two roads, both measured in farsakhs, one by Shahr-i- Babak (given by Ibn Khurdadbih only), and another leading directly across the desert to Bimand, to which there are two alternative routes, one (Ibn Khurdadbih) by Kariyat-al-Milh, 4 Salt Village,' the other by Rubat-Pusht-Kham, 1 Crook-back Guard-house' (Kudamah and Istakhri). Further, Mukaddasi gives the road from Niriz (in marches) to Bimand and Sirjan; while both he and Istakhri describe the route from the south-west which came up from Rustak-ar-Rustak in somewhat over four days ? march, going direct to Sirjan 2 . From Sirjan to Bardasir (Kirman city) it was two days' march. Mustawfi says 20 leagues, but no halting-place or town is Mst. 182, 222. I. B. ii. 230. A. F. 339. A. Y. i. 789, 809, 810. J.N. 258, 260.

From Bardasir (Kirman) it was two marches to Zarand, Janzarfldh lying half-way between the two. From Sirjan to Mahan it was three days' march, and thence three more to Khabis, but the intermediate stages cannot be identified 1 . From Sirjan, eastward, the great caravan road towards Makran went through a number of towns that no longer exist, coming to Rayin, thence on by Darzin, Bam, and Narmasir to Fahraj on the desert border. The stages along this road are given in farsakhs (leagues) by both Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, besides the stations by the day's march {markalah) in two of our other authorities 2 . From Sirjan south-east to Jiruft, in spite of the route being described in leagues by Ibn Khurdadbih, and in marches by Istakhri, none of the places mentioned, except Darfarid, can be surely identified; for, possibly with the exception of the southern Baft, none of them are found on the map, and the true reading of the many variants in the mss. is by no means certain. From Jiruft the road turned south, and passing through Valashgird and Manilkan, came to the coast at (Old) Hurmuz. According to Istakhri, at Valashgird a branch struck off westward to the frontier of Fars, passing through a series of towns or villages that have now entirely disappeared, and unfortunately even the terminus of this road on the Fars frontier cannot now be fixed 3 . From Old Hurmuz, up to Rigan and Narmasir, Mukaddast gives the route in marches, passing through the towns of Bas and Jakin; while going south from Rayin to Jiruft the distances through Darjin and Hurmuz-al-Malik are given in marches by Istakhri 4 . 1 1st. 169.

Thus it measures nearly 800 miles &lt;in length, but the breadth varies considerably; for in shape this immense area of drought is somewhat that of an hour-glass, with a narrow neck, measuring only some 100 miles across, dividing Kirman from Sistan, while both north and south of this the breadth expands and in places reaches to over 200 miles 1 . The medieval Arab geographers refer to the Desert as Al- Mafazah, ' the Wilderness,' and carefully define its limits. On the west and south-west it was bounded by the Jibal province, by the 1 The general outline of the Great Desert is given in Map I (p. 1), details of the northern portion are shown in Map v (p. 185), of the lower part in Maps VI (p. 248), vn (p. 323), and vm (p. 335). At the present day the Desert, as a whole, is known as the Lut or Dasht-i-Lut (Desert of Lot); the saline swamps and the dry salt area being more particularly known as the Dasht-i-Kavir, the term Kavlr being also occasionally applied to the Desert as a whole. The etymology of the terms Lid (the Arab form of the Biblical Lot) and Kavtr is uncertain ; see Major Sykes, p. 32.CHAP. XXIII] THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKR A N. 323 district of Yazd (originally counted as part of Fars) and by Kirman, south of which it spread out among the ranges of the Makran coast. To the east and north-east lay Khurasan with its dependent and adjacent provinces; namely Ktimis to the north of the Desert, and next a corner of Khurasan proper; then Kuhistan, and below this Sijistan at the narrow part opposite Kirman, Sijistan being coterminous with what is now known as the Baluchistan desert, which in the middle-ages was considered as a part of Makran. Both Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi write of the Desert from personal experience, for each had crossed its wastes on more than one occasion. Ibn Hawkal briefly describes it as a No Man's Land, belonging to no province, where robbers from every district found shelter, and where permanent villages, except in three in stances, were conspicuously absent. Mukaddasi enters into the matter in some detail, and of his remarks the following is a summary :—The Desert was, he writes, like the sea, for you could cross it in almost any direction, if you could keep a true line, and pick up the tanks and domes, built above the water-pits, which in the 4th (10th) century were carefully maintained along the main tracks at distances of a day's march. He, Mukaddasi, had once been 70 days on the passage across, and he speaks from experience of the countless steep passes over the ever-barring ranges of hills, the fearful descents, the dangerous salt swamps (sabkhah), the alternate heat and bitter cold. He notices too that there was but little sand, and there were palm-trees and some arable lands hidden away in many of the minor valleys. At that date the Desert was terrorised by roving bands of the Bahis (Baluchi tribesmen), whose fastnesses were in the Kufs mountatnT^ThiT^rifliiaii border, k a'people with savage faces, evil hearts, and neither morals nor manners.' None could escape meeting them, and those they overcame they would stone to death ' as one would a snake, putting a man's head on a boulder, and beating upon it, till it be crushed in'; and when Mukaddasi enquired why they so barbarously put men to death he was answered that it was in order not needlessly to blunt their swords. 'Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, in Mukaddasi's day, had in part curbed these BaWch brigands, by carrying off a tribe of them to3 2 4 THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. [CHAP. Fars as hostages, and caravans were after this tolerably safe, if they had a guide and letters of protection from the Sultan. These BaWs, Mukaddasi adds, went mostly on foot, but possessed a few dromedaries {jammdz). Though nominally Moslems, they were more cruel to True Believers than either the Christian Greeks or the heathen Turks, driving their prisoners before them for twenty leagues a day barefoot, and fasting. Their own food was from the nut of the Nabk, or Sidr (Lotus) tree, and the men were famous for their power of bearing without complaint both hunger and thirst. About half-a-century after the time of Mukaddasi, namely in the year 444 (1052), Nasir-i-Khusraw crossed the northern part of the Desert on his return from the pilgrimage to Mecca. He gives no special name to the Great Desert, referring to it merely as the Biyaban, 'the waterless land,' but he notes its two chief charac teristics and dangers, namely the moving sands (Rig-ravan) and the salt swamps (Shtiristan), the latter often as much as six leagues across. He travelled from Nayin in the Jibal province to the central oasis at Jarmak, and thence on to Tabas in Kilhistan, by the route which will be mentioned presently. His description of the road, however, is vague and adds little to our information. He speaks of the Amir Gilaki, of Tabas, as in his day keeping , such order throughout the Desert that the Kufs robbers, whom he calls the Kufaj, were powerless to molest travellers; and he mentions that every two leagues along the road he travelled there were cupolas {gumbad) over water-tanks, which marked the safe track to be followed, and relieved the wants of the traveller. He \remarks that if the tanks were only kept in order, the passage of the Desert could always be effected without much hardship, except for fear of robbers; and his account in this matter is confirmed by the numerous caravan roads, crossing the waste in more than one direction and sufficiently supplied at each stage by water in pits, which are detailed in the itineraries given by Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi 1 . Three far-separated oases were found along the central line of the great waste, and to these naturally the various roads crossing from west to east converged. In the middle-ages these oases 1 I. H. 287, 288. Muk. 488, 489. N. K. 93, 94. Yak. iv. 147.XXIII] THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. 325 lie 1 were known as Jarmak, Naband (still so called), and Sanij; this last according to Mukaddasi being the only town that the Desert . could boast as possessing within its compass. In the very centre of the upper expansion of the Desert, half way across from Isfahan to Tabas in Kiihistan, is the oasis now called Jandak or Biyabanak, which in the middle-ages was known to the Arabs as Jarmak, and in Persian was written Garmah. It consisted of three hamlets called Jarmak (or Garmah), Biyadak (or Piyadah in Persian), and Arabah. Ibn Hawkal names the whole settlement Sihdih, 'Three Villages'; and Nasir-i-Khusraw says there were from ten to twelve hamlets here in the 5th (nth) century. At Piyadah also there was a small fort, garrisoned by the Amir Gilaki, for the safe control of the Desert routes. In this oasis there were palm-trees, and arable fields of some extent where cattle throve; and the three chief settlements, Ibn Hawkal says, all lay within sight of water, the population in the 4th (10th) century numbering over 1000 men. Later authorities add nothing to these details, and in fact down to the time of Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century the accounts are almost identical, all copying Ibn Hawkal. Naband, the second oasis, still bears this name, and it lies at the northern end of the narrow part of the Desert, between Ravar in Kirman and KMr in Kuhistan. Ibn Hawkal describes Naband as possessing a Rubat or guard-house, with a score of houses round it, water being plentiful, enough indeed to w T ork a small mill. Palms grew here, and many springs irrigated the fields; and two leagues distant from the place was an outlying spring, ' surrounded by palms, where there was a domed tank, of evil fame as a noted hiding-place for robbers. The third oasis lay somewhat further to the south again, and at the very narrowest part of the Desert, at the half-way stage on the road from Narmasir in Kirman to Zaranj, the capital of Sijistan. Here there is a small valley with springs, which is now known to the Persians as Nasratabad, but which the Balftchis still call Ispi or Isfi. This name is identical with the reading Isbidh for this oasis, which is otherwise called Sanij, or Sanig, by Mukaddasi. He counts it as a town of Sijistan, while according to Ibn Hawkal it belonged rather to Kirman. It was,326 THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. [CHAP. as already said, the only city in the Desert according to the Arab geographers, and Mukaddasi speaks of it as having a considerable population, with much arable land, watered by underground channels; but all around and close up to the houses was the waterless wilderness 1 . The roads across the Desert are given in detail by the geographers of the 4th (10th) century. From the western side, starting from Isfahan and from Nayin, two roads converged on Jarmak; the first (given by Mukaddasi) is in eight stages, while from Nayin it was five stages to Jarmak, and there were water- tanks and domes all along the way at distances of a few leagues apart. From Jarmak, Mukaddasi is our authority for a direct road due north to Damghan in Kumis; the distance was 90 leagues, it being 50 leagues across to a place called Wandah, and thence 40 on to Damghan. From Jarmak, going eastward, it was four days' march to a place called Naw Khani, or Nawjay, with water-domes all along the route at every three or four leagues. At Nawjay the roads bifurcated, going north-east to Turshiz, and south-east to Tabas, both in the Ktihistan province. The distance from Nawjay to Purshiz was tour stages, the half-distance being at Bann Afndtin (now known as Dih Naband, a place not to be confused with the oasis of Naband, just described); and from Jarmak to this Bann Afndiin, Mukaddasi also gives a route across the Desert direct, in seven days' march, with a tank (hawd) at each stage. From Nawjay, going south-east, Tabas was reached in three marches. The distances between Tabas and Turshiz via Bann Ibn Khurdadbih gives in leagues; elsewhere, and as a rule on the Desert routes, only the stages by the day's march {marhalait) are given 2 . Prom Yazd to Tabas, direct, the way went by Anjirah and Khazanah to Saghand on the Desert border, places already men- 1 I. H. 289, 293. Muk. 488, 494, 495. N. K. 93, 94. Mst. 183. Yak. iii. 170. The oasis of Biyabanak (otherwise Jandak or Khur) is mentioned by Tavernier (Voyages, i. 769, La Haye, 1718) in the 17th century, and it was visited in 1875 by Col. Macgregor [Khorasan, i. 91). Both Naband and Isfi, or Nasratabad, have been visited lately by Major Sykes (Persia^ pp. 36, 416). 2 1st. 231. I. H. 291. I. K. 52. Muk. 491.XXIII] THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. 327 tioned as of Fars (see p. 285). From Saghand Ibn Khurdadbih gives the six stages in leagues to Tabas, an itinerary which is duplicated by Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi, but going by the day's march, and following a not quite identical route. Two stages from Saghand was the guard-house called Rubat Ab- Shuturan, 'of the Camel-stream,' the water coming from an under ground channel, and flowing into a pool. Mukaddasi describes the guard-house as a fine building of burnt brick, with iron gates, and it was well garrisoned. It had been built by Nasir-ad-Dawlah Ibn-Simjiir, a famous general of the Buyids, who was governor in these regions during the middle of the 4th (10th) century. Three marches beyond this guard-house the Desert ended; and here the road, as described by Ibn Hawkal (repeating Istakhri), leaves Tabas aside, going in a single march from the stage one march south of this town, to the stage one march north of it, on the road to Bann 1 . The next passage of the Desert starts from the village of Birah, of the district called Shiir, meaning £ the Salt-water,' which was on the frontier of Kirman near Kuhbanan. From here the passage was made in seven or eight stages—each halt at a watering-place—to Kuri, a village on the Desert border of Kuhistan, situated a few miles to the south-east of Tabas. On this, which was known as the Shftr route, Istakhri states that at one point about two leagues to the north of the track there might be seen curious stones, doubtless fossils, in the likeness of various fruits, to wit, almonds, apples, nuts, and pears, while the forms of men and trees were simulated by the rocks here, with likenesses of other created things. In addition to the foregoing route, Mukaddasi states that there was a road direct from Ktih- banan to Kuri, in 60 leagues, with water in tanks at every second march. Ravar, as described in Chapter XXI, lies some leagues east of Ktihbanan on the Kirman frontier, and from this place a road went in five marches to Naband, the oasis mentioned above, and thence in three marches on to Khilr in Kvlhistan. There were the usual water-tanks at every three or four leagues along this 1 I. K. 51. 1st. 236. I. H. 235. Muk. 491, 493.328 THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. [CHAP. route also. The town of Khabis, three marches from Mahan on the Kirman border, was already almost within the Desert limits (see p. 308); and from here a road is given which reached Khawst (modem KhOlsf) in Ktlhistan in ten marches. The frontier of Kuhistan was reached two marches before Khawst, at the village of Kliktir, where the Desert ended; and on this road, at a place where was the tomb of a certain Al-Khariji, there were to be found curious white and green pebbles, 'as though of camphor and glass,' while at another place, about four leagues the road, was a small black boulder of very remarkable appearance 1 . Lastly from Narmasir in Kirman to Zaranj, the capital of Sistan, the way crossed the narrow part of the Desert, going by the oasis of Sanij or Ispi, which has been described above. The first stage of this route was to Fahraj on the Desert border, and in four stages it brought the traveller to Sanij. Ibn Khurdadbih gives each stage of this route in leagues, Istakhri mentioning the day's march only, but the latter gives also a second route to Sanij by what he calls 'the New Road,' but this was a longer way. From Sanij it was seven or eight days' march to the city of Zaranj, the frontier of Sistan being crossed at Gavnishak, which was not far from Kundur, a place that is still marked on the map. Between Givnishak and Kundur, and three or four stages south of Zaranj, was a Rubat or guard-house, ouilt by 'Amr the Saffarid in the 3rd (9th) century, which according to Istakhri was known as Kantarah Kirman, 'the Kirman Bridge'; although, as he is careful to remark, no actual bridge existed here. This place marks an important point, for in the middle-ages the Zarah lake had its borders as far south as this, as will be noticed in the following chapter 2 . 1st. 232, 233, 234. I.

The arid ranges of the Makran coast are, in their general physical features, a prolongation of the Great Desert, and though during the earlier middle-ages the country appears to have been more fertile and populous than it is now, Makran was never a rich, or, politically, an important province. The chief product of Makran was the sugar-cane, and the particular kind of white sugar, known to the Arabs as Al-Famdh (from the Persian Panid), and made here was largely exported to neighbouring lands 1 . The earlier geographers name many towns as in Makran, but give scant descriptions of them. The chief commercial centre was the port of Tiz on the Persian Gulf, and the capital of the province was Fannazbtir or Bannajbilr, which lay inland, at the place now known as Panj-giir. Bannajbiir, according to Mukad- dasi, had in the 4th (10th) century a clay-built fortress, protected by a ditch, and the town was surrounded by palm-groves. There were two city gates, Bab Tiz opening south-west on the road to the gulf port, and Bab Tilran opening north-east on the road to the district of that name, of which the capital was Kuzdar. A stream brought water to the city; and the Friday Mosque stood in the market-place, though, according to Mukaddasi, the people were really only Moslem in name, being savage BaKisis (Baluchis) whose language was a jargon 2 . The ruins of the great port of Tiz lie at the head of what was a fine harbour for the small ships of the middle-ages. Mukaddasi describes Tiz as surrounded by palm-groves, and there were great warehouses in the town, and a beautiful mosque. The population 1 I. H. 226, 232, 233. Muk. 475, 476. Yak. iv. 614. The sites of the various medieval towns in Makran are ably discussed by Sir T. H. Holdich in the Geographical Journal for 1896, p. 387, and, in the present state of our information, his conclusions cannot be bettered. 2 Kannazbflr, or Kannajbur, as the name has often been printed, is merely a clerical error for Fannazbur, by a doubling of the diacritical points over the first letter. 1st. 170, 171, 177* I- H. 226, 232.

It lies one march west of Kal'ah Naghah, and the surrounding district is also called Panj-gur. Sykes, Persia, p. 234.33° was of all nations, as is usual in a great seafaring port; and in the 6th (12th) century the place had, in large measure, acquired the trade of Hurmuz, which had fallen to ruin K Of other towns in Makran the Arab geographers give only the names, and no descriptions. The names of the well-known town of Bamptir, and Fahraj its neighbour, occur in Mukaddasi as Barbur (for Banbur) and Fahl Fahrah, Yakiit giving the last under the form Bahrah 2 . The town of Kasarkand, north of Tiz, is still a place of some importance; and Kaj, some distance to the east of this, is mentioned as Kij or Kiz. The names of Jalk and Dazak also occur; and Khwash or Khwas, which is probably the modern Gwasht, lying to the east of Khwash in the Sarhad district (already mentioned, p. 317). Rask was, in the middle-ages, a town of some note on account of its fertile district called Al- Kharuj, but, from the Itineraries, there is doubt whether it can be identical with the present township of this name. Armabil and Kanbali were two important towns, on or near the coast, about half-way between Tiz and Daybul at the Indus mouth. Istakhri describes these as cities of considerable size, lying two days' march apart, and one of them was situated half a league distant from the sea. 1 heir people were rich traders, who had dealings chiefly with India 3 . 1 Muk. 478^ Yak. i. 907.

The earlier Arab geographers in point of fact knew little about Makran, and the later ones add nothing worth mentioning. Yakut only repeats what his predecessors of the 4th (10th) century have said. All that Kazvini (ii. 181) has to tell us of this province is that there was a wonderful bridge there, crossing a river, and formed of one single block of stone. He adds,—'he who crosses it vomits up the contents of his belly, so that naught remains therein, and though thousands should pass over the bridge this always happens to each one. So when any man of that country requires to vomit he has only to cross this bridge.'XXIIl] THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. 331 The present work does not pretend to deal with medieval India, and indeed the Arab geographers give no systematic account of that country. The Indian port best known to them, beyond the eastern end of the Persian Gulf, was Daybul, then a fine harbour at the principal mouth of the Indus. This was in the Sind province, of which the capital was Al-Mansiirah, called Brahmanabad by the Indians, a great city lying on one of the canals or branches of the lower Indus. The Indus was known to the Arabs as the Nahr Mihran, and many of the towns along its banks are named, more especially Al-Multan, the great city far up the affluent of the Indus called the Sindarudh, where there was a famous idol temple. Istakhri, who compares the Indus with the Nile for size and importance, notices that the Indian river also had crocodiles like those of Egypt. The sources of the Indus, he says, were in the great mountains to the north, and near the origin of the Oxus. Of the Sind province were the people known to the Arabs under the name of Az-Zutt, called Jat by the Persians, who are now generally held to be identical with the forefathers of the Gipsies 1 . On the north-eastern frontiers of Makran, and close to the Indian border, the Arab geographers describe two districts; namely, T6ran, of which the capital was Kusdar, and Budahah to the north of this, of which the capital was Kandabil. Kusdar, also spelt Al-Kuzdar, is mentioned among the earlier conquests of Sultan MahmM of Ghaznah. Ibn Hawkal describes it as standing on a river {wadt), and having a fortress in its midst. The plain around the town was very fertile, producing vines and pomegranates with other fruits of a cold climate. Mukaddasi adds that the city lay in two quarters, on either side of the dry river bed ; on one side was the palace of the Sultan and the castle. 1 1st. 171, 172, 173, 175, 180. I.

Mansurah is on an old channel of the Indus delta, about 40 miles north-east of Hyderabad. Sind is of course only the old Persian form of the name Hind, but the Arabs used it vaguely to denote the great province to the east of Makran, which is now in part called Baluchistan and in part is in cluded in modern Sind. Sindarudh is the River of Sind.332 THE GREAT DESERT AND MAKRAN. [CHAP. on the other, which was called Btidin, dwelt the merchants, whose shops in the market were much frequented by the Khurasan folk. Mukaddasi adds that the houses were clay-built, and there were underground channels for the water-supply, but this was bad in quality and scanty. Ttaran, the name given to the Kusdar district, was often held to include the lands to the north, known as the Budahah district, of which the chief town, Kandabil, has been identified with the present Gandava, lying south of Sibi and east of Kelat. Kandabil is described by Ibn Hawkal as a large city, standing solitary in a plain, and no date palms grew here. Of its dependencies was the town of Kizkanan, or Kikan, which from its position in the Itineraries is to be identified with modern Kelat. Both these towns were often described as of Ttiran, some others being also named which it is impossible now to identify, for no sufficient description is given of them, and the readings of the mss. vary considerably as to orthography 1 . To the north of these districts was Balis, or Walishtan, with the towns of Sibi and Mastanj j but these were held by the early geographers to be included in Sijistan, and will therefore be noticed in the next chapter. The routes across Makran are in continuation of the roads of the Great Desert already described, and their ultimate point is India. They are unfortunately as a rule only given in a summary way, so many days' march from one town to another, and the distances cannot be considered as reliable. Ibn Khurdadbih, however, gives the detail of one route in leagues, and stage by stage, though it is impossible now to identify the exact line across the Desert. Starting from Fahraj on the Desert border east of Bam and Narmasir in Kirman, he gives the 14 stages to Fannazbur, the capital of Makran; and thence, eastward, the names of three halting-places on the road to Kusdar. An almost parallel route, but in the contrary direction, is given by Mukaddasi, from Kusdar to Juy or Nahr Sulayman, which lay 20 leagues east of Bam, but this road keeps north of Fannazbilr, passing by Jalk and Khwas 2 .

Sistan, which the earlier Arabs called Sijistan from the Persian Sagistan, is the lowland country lying round, and to the eastward of, the Zarah lake, which more especially includes the deltas of the Helmund and other rivers which drain into this inland sea. The highlands of the Kandahar country, along the upper waters of the Helmund, were known as Zabulistan. Sistan was also called Ntmriiz in Persian, meaning 'mid-day,' or the Southern I and, a name said to have been applied to the province in regard to its position to the south of Khurasan. Istakhri describes the Sijistan province as famous for its fertility ; dates, grapes, and all food-stuffs were grown here abundantly, also assafoetida, which the people were wont to mix with all their dishes 1 . It is to be borne in mind that the Zarah lake was, in the middle-ages, far more extensive than it has come to be at the present day. Besides the Helmund, a great river of many af fluents, three other considerable streams drained into the lake, namely, the Khwash river, the Farah river, and the river from the neighbourhood of Asfuzar (Sabzivar of Herat), which is now known as the Hartld. In Persian legend, Sistan and Zabulistan 1 1st. 244. L H. 301.335 were famous as the home of Zal, the father of the national hero Rustam, whose exploits are still current among the people. In the times of the early Abbasid Caliphate, Sistan further became known to fame as the place of origin of the Saffarid Amirs, who in the second half of the 3rd (9th) century governed most of southern and eastern Persia, being virtually in the condition of independent princes. The capital of the province, during the middle-ages, was the great city of Zaranj, destroyed by Tinu'ir, of which the ruins still remain, covering a considerable area of ground. The name of Zaranj, however, has now entirely disappeared, and even in the later middle-ages had dropped out of use, the capital of the province being known to the later Arab geographers merely as Madinah Sijistan, ' the City of Sijistan,' the Persian form being the equivalent, Shahr-i-Sistan, which was in use when Timiir finally laid the town in ruins 1 . Under the Sassanian kings Zaranj was already a great city, and at the time of the first Moslem conquest, in the year 20 (641), it is more than once mentioned. It was situated near the Sanarudh canal, a great branch from the Helmund, which flowed out to the westward, and in flood-time reached the Zarah lake. Ya'ktibi, in the 3rd (9th) century, describes Zaranj as four leagues in circumference, and in the next century we have a detailed notice of the city by Ibn Hawkal. It was then strongly fortified, consisting of an inner town surrounded by a wall having five gates, beyond which lay the suburbs of the outer 1 The ruins of Zaranj lie round the modern villages of Zahidan and Shahristan, along the old bed of one of the chief canals from the Helmund, which since the middle-ages has become dry. For the modern condition of these, and other ruined sites, see Sir H. Rawlinson, for 1873, pp. 280, 283, 284; Sir F. Goldsmid, Eastern Persia, i. 301 ; Sykes, pp. 375, 382, 383. A sketch plan of the chief ruin is given by A. H. Savage Landor in Across Coveted Lands, ii. 228. Near Zahidan is still seen the remains of a tower about 80 feet high, called the Mil-i-Zahidan, having a spiral staircase, and two partly legible Kufic inscriptions. This tower, tradition says, was destroyed by Timur; see G. P. Tate, in 1904, p. 171. Nasratabad, the modern capital of Sistan, lies a few miles to the south of these ruins; it was known at first under the name of Nasirabad, which name, however, has now gone out of use. According to Mr Savage Landor it is at the present day also known as Shahr-i-Nasnyah.336 sijistAn. [chap. town, enclosed by the outer wall, which had thirteen gates, these latter opening across a great moat filled with water from springs and from the overflow of the canals. The five gates of the inner town were all of iron. Two, close by one another, opening to the south-east towards Fars, and known as the Fars gates, were individually called the Bab-al-Jadid and the Bab-al-'Atik, 'the New Gate' and 'the Old Gate.' To the north, towards Khurasan, was the Bab Karkuyah, called after the neighbouring town of Karkuyah; the Bab Nishak was on the eastern road, toward Bust; while the Bab-at-Ta'am, ' the Victuals Gate,' which was most in use of all the five, opened on the road leading south through the markets and the gardens lying outside Zaranj. The Great Mosque, Masjid-al-Jami', was in the outer town, standing near the two south-western gates, on the Fars road, and the prison stood near it, beside the old Government House. Between the Nishak and the Karkuyah gates, in the north-east part of the town, was the ark or citadel containing the treasury, which had been erected by 'Amr, the second Saffarid prince. His elder brother Ya'kub, the founder of the dynasty, had built himself a palace, which subsequently became the new Government House, in that part of the inner town lying between the two south western gates and the Bab-at-Ta'am. Near this was also the palace of 'Amr; and these, like all the other houses of the town, were constructed of clay bricks and vaulted, since no beams could be used here for roofing, all woodwork rapidly perishing from the damp climate, and from being bored through by worms. In both the inner and the outer town were many hostels (fandtik) y and in the outer town or suburb were the Government offices. The markets of the inner town stood near the Great Mosque. Those of the outer town were extremely populous, and especially famous was that called Silk 'Amr, built by the second Saffarid prince, the rents from which, amounting every day to over 1000 dirhams (^40), were divided between the Great Mosque, the town hospital (Bimaristan), and the Mecca sanctuary. In the outer town the markets extended for nearly half a league in length, with a continuous line of shops going from the two Fars gates of the inner wall, to the gate of the outer suburb wall. Throughout Zaranj water was plentiful, being brought fromXXIV] SIJISTAN. 337 the Sanarudh by a series of minor canals or watercourses, which entered the inner city at three points—the New Gate, the Old Gate, and the Gate of Victuals. The three together had water- power 'sufficient to turn a mill,' and they flowed into two great reservoir tanks near the mosque, whence the water was distributed throughout the inner town. The houses of the outer town were also well provided by channels with running water, which was an indispensable convenience in this hot climate; and each house had a Sarddb, or cellar-room, for living in during the hot season, when the heat of Zaranj was most oppressive. Round the town lay the sabkhah, or salt marshes, where date palms grew, environed by the desert sands. Here violent winds blew continually, moving the sands about in a dangerous way and often overwhelming whole villages and devastating the cultivated districts. The ceaseless wind was used by the people to turn their windmills, which were a feature peculiar to this country. The 'moving sands,' however, were a continual source of danger, and Ibn Hawkal gives a long account of how, in the year 360 (970) and odd, the Great Mosque of Zaranj became quite choked up with sand. Such was Zaranj in the 4th (10th) century, and this description is repeated by Mukaddasi. He refers also to the riches and the learning of the inhabitants, notes the strongly fortified castle (Kal'ah), and the two famous minarets of the Great Mosque, one of which had been built by Ya'kiib the Saffarid. The city continued to flourish for many centuries, and even during the Mongol invasion of the year 619 (1222), when Changiz Khan sent his hordes to ravage Sistan, the capital seems to have escaped devastation, and it was for some time after this date under a Mongol governor. In the early part of the 8th (14th) century, Mustawfi speaks of Zaranj (the name of which the Persians pronounced Zarang) as very flourishing; and the city, he says, was protected from the ' moving sands' of the neighbouring desert by a great dyke {Band), stated to have been originally built by the ancient king Gurshasf, and to have been afterwards restored by King Bahman, son of Isfandiyar. Mustawfi praises the gardens of Zaranj, which produced excellent and abundant fruit, these gardens being irrigated from the Black Canal (Siyah Rud) which le S. 22338 SIJISTAN. [CHAP. was taken from one of the branches of the Helmund river. At the end of the century, however, in 785 (1383), Timilr appeared with his armies before the city, which, as already said, was then known as Shahr-i-Sistan (Sistan city), and its fate was not long left in doubt. Timilr had already taken and destroyed the neigh bouring fortress, called the Kal'ah or Hisar Zarah, which probably stood to the north of Zaranj, near the borders of the lake. The capital of Sistan closed its gates, and declined to surrender. After a short siege it was taken by storm, all its inhabitants who could be found were massacred, its walls were then razed and its houses destroyed. Since that time Zaranj has come to be a nameless, ruin \ The Zarah or Zirrah lake (Buhayrah Zarah), as already said,, in medieval times had permanently a far greater extent than is now generally the case; but at all times its area is noted as fluctuating in size, according as the rivers were in flood or drought 2 . It is described by Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century as having a length of 30 leagues (100 miles), counting from a place called Kurin in Krihistan to the Sijistan frontier post near Kantarah Kirman, at the third stage on the road from Zaranj to Narmasir (see above, p. 328). The lake was reckoned as the equivalent of a day's journey {rnarhalah, about 30 miles) across. It was of sweet water and full of reeds, and was plentifully stocked with fish; its borders, except on the desert side, were dotted with many farmsteads and populous villages,, where the fish were caught and dried for export. The chief water-supply of the Zarah lake came from the great river Helmund, which Yaktlt rightly characterises as 'the 1 Baladhuri, 392, 394. Ykb. 281. 1st. 239—242. I. H. 297—299, 301^ Muk. 305. Mst. 183. A. Y. i. 362. 2 A number of sketch maps, showing the present condition of the Helmund delta and the lake, are given by Major Sykes, Persia, pp. 364, 372. At its. southern extremity the great lake basin is in connection with an immense channel—some 50 miles in length, and averaging 350 yards broad, with cliffs 50 feet high—which is called the Shela. This runs in a south-easterly direction into the Gawd-i-Zarah, or 'Hollow of Zarah,' a second lake bed, lying due south of the bend in the lower Helmund, and this Gawd, or hollow, in seasons of flood, receives the overflow of the lake. The Gawd-i-Zarah has- an area measuring 100 miles from east to west by about 30 miles across. Sykes, Persia, p. 365.V XXIV] SIJISTAN. 339 river of the thousand affluents.' He spells the name Hindmand, Hidmand being a common variant probably due to clerical error, also Hirmand (or Hirmid), and by this name Mustawfi describes the river, which he also calls the Ab -i-Zarah, or Stream of the Zarah (lake). Helmund is the more common modern form. The great river rises in the mountain range lying between Ghaznah and Bamiyan, which now forms part of Afghanistan, but which, in the middle-ages, was known as the district (or kingdom) of Ghilr. Taking a south-westerly course it passed down through the broad valley known as the Zamin-Dawar to the city of Bust, where it was joined on its left bank by the Kandahar river, which watered the country called Rukhkhaj. Bust was the first city the river came to of Sijistan proper, and from here the Helmund began its great semicircular bend, flowing south, then west, and then north to Zaranj, whence turning west again its waters were discharged into the Zarah lake. When one march, or some 30 miles distant, from Zaranj the Helmund was checked by a series of great dams, which had been built to hold up its waters for irrigation needs, and at this point the greater volume of the main stream was drawn off into five great canals flowing out towards Zaranj and the lake. The first or southernmost of these was the Nahr-at-Ta'am, 'the Victuals Canal,' which irrigated the lands and farms outside the Bab-at- Ta'am, the gate of Zaranj already mentioned, which lands in part were of the Nishak district. The next canal was called the Nahr Basht Rudh; and the third was the Sanarudh, which, starting from the main stream of the Helmund one league from Zaranj, was the waterway to the capital, so that, as Ibn Hawkal remarks, in flood- times a traveller could go by boat all the way from Bust to Zaranj. The fourth canal, which irrigated some thirty villages, was called the Nahr Sha'bah, and the fifth was the Nahr Mila. Beyond this what was left of the main stream of the Helmund entered the channel known as the Nahr Kazak, where its waters were again dammed back for irrigation purposes, except in the flood season, when the overflow escaped direct to the Zarah lake 1 . 1 1st. 242—244.

[CHAP. Zaranj, according to the earlier Arab geographers, had not been originally the capital city of Sijistan under the ancient Persian kings. Their capital had stood at Ram Shahristan, otherwise called Abrashahriyar, a city that had already in the 4th (10th) century been swallowed up by the desert sands, but of which the ruins, with parts of houses, still remained standing, and visible at that date. The situation of this ancient capital is given vaguely as lying three marches from Zaranj, on the left hand of one going from that city towards Kirman, 'near Darak and over against Rasak,' two unknown places. It is stated that in older days the main branch canal from the Helmund had brought water to this place, by which all the surrounding lands were fully irrigated. The dam across the great river which fed this canal had, however, suddenly burst, and the waters, pouring down another channel, became permanently diverted. As a result the whole region round the older city lapsed to the state of a desert, and the inhabitants, migrating in a body, founded the city of Zaranj. At some distance to the west of the Zarah lake, on the Kiihistan frontier and close to the border of the Great Desert, is the town of Nib, or Nih, which is named by earlier Arab geographers as belonging to Sistan. Mukaddasi mentions it as a strongly fortified town, the houses of which were built of clay, water being brought down from the hills by underground channels. Nih is also referred to by Y§Mt and Mustawfi, who, however, add no details, except to state that it was founded by King Ardashir Babgan, though at the present day the remains of great fortifica tions, and the immense ruins found here, would seem to prove that in the middle-ages it had been a place of much importance 1 . Of the rivers flowing into the Zarah lake from the north that which comes down from Asfuzar (Sabzivar of Herat), and is now known as the Hartid, does not appear to be mentioned by the 1 1st. 242. I. H. 300. Mule. 306. Yak. iv. 871. Mst. 183. The position of Ram Shahristan is not certain. Sir H. Rawlinson 1873, p. 274) would place it at Ramrud, near the beginning of the Shela, where there are extensive ruins. These ruins, which apparently at the present day are known as Shahr-i-Rustam, Rustam's city, are described, and a sketch plan given, by A. H. Savage Landor in Acros ii. 270. The ruins of Nih are described by Major Sykes, P p. 413.XXIV] SIJISTAN. 341 Arab geographers. They notice, however, the Farah river, which takes its rise in the mountains of the Ghtir district. This, the Wadi Farah, after leaving the hill country, soon entered the pro vince of Sijistan, and came to the city of Farah, which Ibn Hawkal speaks of as lying in a plain, being a large place of clay-built houses, and with sixty dependent villages having many farms where much fruit was grown, more especially dates. Mukaddasi adds that the city of Farah was in two quarters, occupied respec tively by the orthodox Moslems, and by the Kharijite sectaries. One stage south of the city was the bridge over the river called the Kantarah Farah (PuW-Farah, in Persian), where the high road down to Zaranj crossed from the right bank to the left. This bridge, where there was also a town, was four days' march above Juvayn, and about half-way between the two (according to Ibn Rustah) was a place called Kahan. Near Kahan, one league away to the westward, was a remarkable sand-hill, with strange acoustic properties; for if water, or any small object, were thrown on the sand of this hillock £ a great noise was heard, like a buzzing sound, and very terrible to listen to.' This wonderful sand-hill is also mentioned by Birtini, writing in the 5th (nth) century, and similar acoustic properties of 4 the moving sand' have been remarked at the present day in the hillocks of the dunes forming the desert between Sijistan and Kilhistan. The modern double town of Lash-Juvayn, at the present time a place of much importance, is mentioned by Mukad dasi, under the form Kuwayn (for Guvayn), as a small city, strongly fortified, in which there was no Friday Mosque, for its inhabitants were all Kharijite sectaries; but except as a stage on the high road, no medieval authority other than Mukaddasi describes the place, and the name Lash is not found. About half-way between Juvayn and Zaranj the high road crossed the chief overflow canal of the Helmund by a bridge, and a few leagues south of this stood the important town of Karktiyah. This last was one stage north of Zaranj, and gave its name, it will be remembered, to the northern city gate. Karkvlyah was peopled by Kharijites, according to Yakut, and many ascetics lived here, but it was chiefly remarkable for its great fire-temple, so much venerated by all the Magians of Persia. Kazvini, writing at the342 SIJISTAN. [CHAP. close of the 7th (13th) century, gives a long account of this building, which he says was covered by two domes, said to date from the mythical times of the national hero Rustam. Each dome was surmounted by a horn, the two horns curving apart one from the other like the two horns of a bull, and these were relics of the aforesaid hero. Under the twin domes stood the fire-temple, where the sacred fire had never been allowed to become extin guished. A priest, who was at stated times relieved by his fellows, served this temple; and he was wont to stand twenty ells away from the fire, having a veil before his mouth, lest his breath should defile the fire, and he fed the flame continually with span-long logs of tamarisk wood, which he laid on with silver tongs. Kazvini adds that this was one of the most venerated of the fire-temples of the Magians. Not far from Karktiyah, and three leagues from Zaranj, was the town of Kurunk, which YaMt says was commonly pronounced Kurun, and under this last name it still exists. It was, Yakiit adds, a pleasant place, full of good things, with a population of Kharijites and weavers 1 . The Khash, Khwash, or Khuwash 2 river flows down to the Zarah lake between the Farah river and the Helmund. It is called by Ibn Hawkal the Nahr Nishak, Nishak being the name of the populous district lying due eastward of Zaranj, which gave its name, as already stated, to the eastern gate of the capital. This river also took its rise in the Ghtir mountains, and the town of Khwash lies on its banks, being about one day's march from Zaranj. Ibn Hawkal describes Khwash as the largest town of this district, 1 I. R. 174; and with regard to the acoustic sand-hill see Biruni, Chronology of Ancient Nations, translated by C. E. Sachau, p. 235 (Arabic text, p. 246). For an example, at the present day, of a sand-hill that gives sounds like 4 an Aeolian harp,' see Sir F. Goldsmid {Eastern Persia, i. 327), who visited this extraordinary hill, which is at the shrine of Imam Zayid, five miles west of Kal'ah-i-Kah. 1st. 244. I. H. 303, 304. Muk. 306, 329. Mst. 215. Kaz. ii. 163. Yak. iii. 42, 888; iv. 263, 269. The site of Karkuyah probably is to be sought among the immense ruins to the south of Pishavaran. There is an old bridge here, of two arches, called Takht-i-Pul; cf. Sir F. Goldsmid, Eastern Persia, i. 3 I 5* Yate, Khurasan and Ststa7i i 118. The fire-temple was known to the Zoroastrians as the Mainyo Karko. 2 There were in this region at least three places of this or a similar name; viz. the present river and town of Khash, then the town of this name in the Jabal-al-Kufs (see p. 317), lastly, Khwas of Makran (see p. 330).XXIV] 343 and famous for its date palms. When Yaktit wrote the name had already come to be more generally pronounced Khash, as at the present day. The most famous city of the district, but a smaller place than Khwash, was Karnin or Al-Karnin, the birth place of the Saffarid princes Ya^ub and £ Amr, sons of Layth, the famous coppersmith. Karnin was situated out in the desert plain to the north-west of Khwash, and one march from it on the road to Farah. They showed here, Ibn Khurdadbih remarks, the relics of the stall of Rustam's horse. Mukaddasi speaks of Karnin as a small place, but well fortified, having a stream going through the town, which had a Friday Mosque, and possessed suburbs. Mustawfi also refers to it, adding that both corn and fruit were grown in the neighbouring lands, which were very fertile. Half-way between Karnin and Farah stood the little town of Jizah, about equal to the former in size, which Ibn Hawkal describes as possessing many villages and farms, for it stood in a very fertile country, amply irrigated by underground water courses. The buildings of the town were of sun-dried bricks; and Yakfit adds that in his day the people pronounced the name Gizah. The whole district along the Khwash river, known as Nishak, was, as already said, extremely populous in the 4th (10th) century. Hartiri, 'a populous village belonging to the Sultan,' which still exists, lies on the river bank below Khwash, where the high road coming in from Bust crossed the Khwash river by a bridge of burnt brick. The village of Sariizan was the next stage on the w T ay to Zaranj, and between these two was situated Zanbilk, a strongly fortified hamlet, which Mukaddasi ranks for size with Juvayn. One day's journey north of Zaranj, but its exact position is not given in the Itineraries, lay the important tow r n of At-Tak, 'the Arch. 7 It was very populous, and Mukaddasi records that grapes in abundance were grown here and in the adjacent farmsteads. Abu-l-Fida in the 8th (14th) century, quoting from Ibn Sa'id, states that this place, which he names Hisn-at-Tak (the Fortress of the Arch), crowned a high hill at a bend of the Helmund, where, after throwing off the canals to Zaranj, the main stream finally turned westward and flowed out to the Zarah lake; and the town is mentioned, together with the fort of Zarah (Kal'ah344 SIJISTAN. [CHAP. or Hisar-i-Zarah), as having been captured by Timtir immediately prior to his attack on Zaranj. In the days of the first Moslem conquest another fortress is mentioned as of this region, namely, Zalik, which is given as lying five leagues from both KarMyah and from Zaranj. Nothing further, however, is known of it, and in later times the place is not referred to 1 . Bust, approximately, lies in the same latitude as Zaranj, and the direct road from Zaranj thither goes due east by Hariri as already described, and across the desert. The course of the Helmund, however, doubles the distance by making its semi circular sweep to the south, and half-way along its course stands the town of RMbar. This place is apparently mentioned by Baladhuri, at the time of the first Moslem conquest, for he speaks of a town called Ar-RMhbar of Sijistan as lying in the direction of Kandahar; and near this Ar-Rudhbar was Kishsh (or Kiss), which appears to be the place called Kaj, or Kuhich, at the present day. RMhbar is elsewhere only incidentally mentioned by the Arab geographers; possibly it is identical with the Rudhbar described by Istakhn as of the Firiizkand district near Bust. This place had many fruitful fields and farms, but the chief export is said to have been salt. Another place of this neighbourhood is Az-Zalikan, otherwise spelt Salakan, or Jalikan. It is described by Ibn Hawkal as one march from Bust, but in which direction is not stated, and the name does not occur in the Itineraries. It was a town mostly inhabited by weavers, but surrounded by extensive and fruitful lands, well watered by streams, and in the 4th (icth) century it was of about the size of Karnin. Bust (or Bast) on the Helmund, at the junction of the river from the Kandahar district, has always been an important place. Istakhri mentions that at its gate was the great bridge of boats, Mike those used in ^rak,' across which the high road came in from Zaranj. Bust was the second largest city of Sijistan in the 4th (icth) century, the people were in easy circumstances, and are described as dressing after the fashion of the men of £ Irak, and as being for the most part merchants who traded with India. The neighbouring lands were extremely fertile, growing dates and 1 Baladhuri, 393, 395. I. H. 301, 302, 303, 304. I. K. 50. Muk. 306. Yak. ii. 72, 486; iv. 27^. Mst. 185. A. F. 343^ A. Y. i. 370.SIJTSTAN. grapes; and Bust was accounted the chief town of all the mountainous country of eastern Sijistan, which included the two great districts of Zamin-Dawar and Rukhkhaj. Mukaddasi states that the city and its fortress, surrounded by great suburbs, stood one league above the junction of the river Khardaruy (the modern Argandab) with the Hirmand (Helmund). It possessed a fine mosque, and the markets were well stocked. Half-a-league distant, on the Ghaznah road, was Al- £ Askar, 'the Camp,' built like a small city, where the Sultan had his residence. In the 7th (13th) century Yaktit writes that Bust was almost entirely a ruin, and he notices the heat of the climate, while mentioning the abundance of its gardens. At the close of the 8th (14th) century the place and its neighbourhood were devastated by Timflr, who marched hither from Zaranj, destroying on his way one of the great dams across the Helmund, known as the Band-i- Rustam, that kept up the head of water which served to irrigate all the western lands of Sistan 1 . The broad valley, down which the Helmund flows from the mountains of Hindfi Kush to Bust, still bears the name, Zamin- Dawar, by which the Arab geographers refer to the district. This is the Persian form of which the Arabic equivalent is 'Ard- ad-Daw T ar or Balad-ad-Dawar, the meaning being the same, namely, 4 the Land of the Gates,' or passes, into the mountains. During the middle-ages this was a fertile and very populous district, with four chief towns, namely, Dartall, Darghash, Baghnin and Sharwan, with numerous great villages and farmsteads. The chief town of the district was Dartal, Dartall, or Tall as Istakhri writes the name, which appears to be identical with the city of Dawar described by Mukaddasi. It was a fine large town, with a fortress, garrisoned by horse guards, who in the 4th (10th) century, held this as the frontier post on the road towards the Ghtir mountains. It lay on the bank of the Helmund river, three marches above Bust, and in the account of the first Moslem conquest it is stated that near here was the mountain, Jabal-az- Zlir, where the great idol called Ziir, or Ztin, had been taken as 1 Baladhuri, 394, 434. 1st. 244, 245, 248. I. H. 302, 304. Muk. 297, 304. Yak. ii. 10, 612 ; iv. 184. A. Y. i. 370.346 booty by the Arabs, this idol being all of gold, with eyes of corundum {ydkut). One march yet higher up the Helmund, and on the same bank as Dartall, was Darghash, while Baghnin lay one march to the west ward of Dartall, in the country held by the Turkish tribes known as the Bishlank, among whom abode the tribe of the Khalaj. These Khalaj Turks afterwards emigrated westward, but Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes them as then living very contentedly in the Zamin-Dawar country, 4 after the Turk fashion.' A fifth town of the Zamin-Dawar w T as Khwash (spelt like the place on the river of that name, just mentioned), which Istakhri described as ariv unwalled city, but protected by a castle. Unfortunately its position is not given, but some authorities count it as belonging to Kabul. Between Bust and Dartall, and one march south of the latter town, being apparently not situated on the Helmund river, stood the city of Sarwan or Sharwan, which Ibn Hawkal describes as of the size of Karnin, but more populous and prosperous. Great quantities of fruit, dates and grapes especially, were exported from its district, and that of Firuzkand, which latter lay south of the Sharwan district and one march to the eastward of Bust 1 . The Rukhkhaj district, occupying the country round about Kandahar, lay to the eastward of Bust along the banks of the streams now known as the Tarnak and the Argandab. The capital of Rukhkhaj in the middle-ages was Banjaway, the Arabic form of Panj-way, 4 Five Streams,' which is still the name of the district west of Kandahar, near the junction of the two rivers Tarnak and Argandab. The Rukhkhaj district was immensely fertile during the middle-ages, and wool was exported thence in large quantities, bringing in a good revenue to the treasury. The site of Banjaway city is difficult to fix. It lay on the high road four marches from Bust, at the point where the ways bifurcated, one road going north in 12 marches to Ghaznah, the other east in six marches to Sibi. It probably was not far from Kandahar, 1 Baladhuri, 394. 1st. 244, 245, 248. I. H. 302, 304. Muk. 305. Yak. ii. 541; iv. 220. None of these towns of the Zamin-Dawar now exist, but Dartall, the capital, must have occupied approximately the site of modern Girishk.XXIV] SIJISTAN. 347 but the distance between the two cities is nowhere given. One league to the west of Banjaway city was the fortress of K6hak, ^ the Hillock,' with a town lying round the fort. Banjaway itself had good fortifications, as well as a fine mosque. It got its water from the neighbouring river. One stage from here, on the Sibi road, lay the town of Bakrawadh (for Bakrabad, which Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal give as Takmabadh, probably from a clerical error), where there was a Friday Mosque in the town market-place; and this town too stood upon a stream that joined the Kandahar river. The city of Kandahar (or Al-Kunduhar) is frequently men tioned in the accounts of the first Moslem conquests of the places near the Indian frontier. Baladhun says it was reached from Sijistan after crossing the desert, and the Moslems, he adds, attacked the place in boats from the river, destroying the great idol Al-Budd, doubtless a statue of Buddha. After this period only incidental mention of Kandahar occurs—generally as of Hind or the Indian frontier—in Mukaddasi, Ibn Rustah, and Ya'ktibi. Unfortunately no early Itinerary takes us to Kandahar, and in the systematic accounts of the province by Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal the name is altogether wanting. Possibly Banjaway replaced it during the earlier middle-ages, for Yakfit gives no description of the town, and the name only reappears in history when it is spoken of as being devastated first by the Mongols in the early part of the 7th (13th) century, and then again by Timilr at the close of the next century 1 . The district round Sibi was known to the Arab geographers as Balis, otherwise Balish, or Walishtan. The capital city according to Istakhn was Sibi, spelt Sivi or Siwah, but the governor generally resided at Al-Kasr (the Castle), a small town situated one league distant from Asfanjay, or Safanjavi, the second city of the district, the exact site of which has not been identified, but which lay two marches north of Sibi on the road to Banjaway of Rukhkhaj. The town of Mastang, or Mastanj, is also mentioned by Istakhri and Mukaddasi, who name a number of other villages of this 1 Baladhuri, 434, 445. 1st. 244, 250. I. H. 301, 302, 305. Muk. 305.

Bellew, From the Indus to the Tigris, p. 160.SIJISTAN. district, which was said to include in all some 2200 hamlets, but no description is given of any of these places 1 . Ghaznah, or Ghaznayn, became famous in history at the close of the 4th (beginning of the nth) century as the capital of the great Mahmiid of Ghaznah, who at one time was master both of India on the east and Baghdad on the west. Unfortunately no adequate description has come down to us of Ghaznah at the time when it was rebuilt and adorned by MahmM with all the plunder of his Indian raids. A generation before this Istakhn describes the place as like Bamiyan, with fine streams but few gardens. He adds that no city of this countryside was richer in merchants and merchandise, for it was as the 'port' of India. Mukaddasi gives a long list of the names of its districts and towns, most of which, however, it is impossible to identify at the present day. He writes the name Ghaznayn, in the dual form, but to what the 4 Two Ghaznahs' has reference is not stated, though Ghaznayn in later times is more generally used than the form Ghaznah. Mukaddasi adds that all the country between this and Kabul was known as Kabulistan. It was about the year 415 (1024) that Mahmud had rebuilt Ghaznah, on his return home laden with the spoils of India, and the city then reached its greatest splendour, which lasted for over a century. The Ghurid Sultan 'Ala-ad-Din, surnamed Jahan-siiz, 4 world incendiary/ to revenge his brother's death at the hands of Bahram Shah the Ghaznavid, took Ghaznah by storm in 544 (1149), and afterwards both sacked and burnt the city, which never recovered from this calamity. The tomb of the great MahmM in the mosque nevertheless appears to have been spared, or else it was restored, for Ibn Battitah saw it here in the 8th (14th) century. He describes Ghaznah as then for the most part in ruins, though formerly, he adds, it had been an immense city. His contemporary Mustawfi speaks of it as a small town, with a very cold climate on account of its great elevation, but he gives no details of any importance 2 . 1 1st. 179, 244. I. H. 301. Muk. 297. 2 1st. 280. I. H. 328. Muk. 296, 297. I. B. iii. 88. Mst. 184. Unfortunately 'Utbi, in his History of Mahmud of Ghaznah, gives no detailedXXIV] SIJISTAN. 349 As we have seen, the whole of the great mountainous district of the upper waters of the Helmund and the Kandahar rivers was known to the Arabs as Zabulistan, a term of vague application, but one which more particularly denoted the country round Ghaznah. On the other hand Kabulistan was the Kabul country, lying more to the north on the frontiers of Bamiyan; and this is the division found in the accounts of the conquests of Timur. Already in the 3rd (9th) century Ya^ilbi describes Kabul as , much frequented by merchants, who brought back from this country the Kabuli Ahlilaj, or myrobalan of the larger sort 1 . Ya'kiibi says the chief city was then known as Jurwas, while Istakhn in the next century gives the name as Taban. Kabul, however, appears also to have been the name in common use, but more especially for the district. There was here a famous Kuhandiz or castle, and the town which was approached by only a single road was well fortified. It was the great emporium of the Indian trade, indigo {nit) being brought here for export to the value of a million gold dinars yearly (about half-a-million sterling); further, most of the precious stuffs of India and China were warehoused here. As early as the 4th (10th) century the Moslems, the Jews, and the idolaters, had each a separate quarter in Kabul, where the suburbs, the markets, and the merchants' warehouses were alike famous. Mukaddasi mentions, too, a wonderful well in the castle; and for him Kabul is especially the country of the myrobalan. He counts Kabuli stan as an outlying region of Sijistan. Kazwini, in the 7th (13th) century, states that Kabul was then famous for the breed of she- description of the capital. See the article on Ghaznah by Sir H. Yule in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (9th ed.), x. 560, where a plan is given. 1 Myrobalan was a name applied during the middle-ages to certain dried fruits and kernels of astringent nature, imported from India, which had a high reputation in the concoction of the medicines of those days. The name is of Greek origin, the Indian fruits used in the manufacture of this condiment are of a variety of species, and one of the best known kinds of myrobalan was that called Chebulic^ namely, that from Kabul. The Arabs named the drug (for this it came to be) Ahlilaj or Haltlaj, and Ibn Baytar in his Dictionary of Drugs (translated by Dr J. Sontheimer, i. 163 ; ii. 572) has two articles about it; see also Dozy, Supplement anx Dictionnaires Arabes, s.v. Ihlilaj, and Glossary of Anglo-Indian Terms, by Yule and Burnell, s.v. Myi-obalan.35° [chap. camels, known as Bactrian (Bukhti), the best in all central Asia. Ibn Batiitah. who visited Kabul in the next century, says that it had then sunk to be a mere village, inhabited by the tribe of Persians known as Afghans (Al-Afghan). The Kabul river is an affluent of the Indus, and is formed by the junction of two streams coming down from the Hindii Kush range, the mountains to the north of Kabul 1 . At the eastern source are the celebrated silver mines, known to the Arabs as Banjahir (for Panj-hir, or c Five Hills/ in the dialect of the country), from which large quantities of the precious metal were obtained, and Banjahir became a mint city under the Saffarid princes in the 3rd (9th) century, the dirhams, of course, bearing the name also of the Abbasid Caliph. Banjahir city is described by Ibn Hawkal as standing on a hill, and inhabited by 10,000 miners, who w r ere an unruly folk, much given to evil living. Jarbayah was a neigh bouring town, also lying on the Banjahir, or Kabul river, which thence flowed out towards the plains of India, past Far wan, a large town w T ith a mosque. Mukaddasi further mentions the town of Shiyan in the district of Askimasht, where there was a wondrous spring, and a fine mosque built by the Arab general Kutaybah-ibn-Muslim, who had commanded the troops at the time of the first Moslem conquest. Yaktlt gives us a long account of these silver mines with their population of riotous miners. He says that the whole mountain side was hollowed out in caverns, where men worked in the bowels of the earth by torch-light. The people were given over entirely to a species of gambling, men found themselves rich one day and paupers on the morrow; they would recklessly spend 300,000 dirhams (^i 2,000) in the mere digging of a new shaft. The ruin of the place was due to Changiz Khan • and when Ibn Battitah, who speaks of the blue waters of the neighbouring stream, came here in the 8th (14th) century, he found no silver mine, but only the disused tunnels of the former workings. 1 Hindu Kush, in Persian, means (the Mountain that) 'kills the Hindus/ Ibn Batutah (iii. 84) is one of the first to give this name, which is unknown to the earlier Arab geographers. He explains that the range was so called because many Indian slaves died in crossing it when journeying to Persia.XXIV] S1JISTAN. 351 The products of Sijistan were few in number; and all that Mukaddasi records is that date-baskets, called zanabil, were made here for export, also ropes of palm-fibre and reed-mats 1 . The high roads in Sijistan all centred in Zaranj, to which in the first place led the desert road from Narmasir via Sanij, which has been described in the last chapter. From Zaranj north wards, a road went to Herat, passing through Karkilyah, and thence by a bridge over the Helmund overflow to Juvayn on the Farah river. From Juvayn Farah city was reached by a road up the river bank, which crossed the river by the bridge of Farah (mentioned p. 341), beyond which was Farah city. Three marches north of Farah lay Asfuzar (or Sabzivar of Herat), the first town in Khurasan. The distances in leagues along this road unfortunately are not given, only the stages of each day's march, for which Istakhn and Ibn Hawkal are the chief authorities 2 . Moreover a good deal of uncertainty exists in the spelling of the names of many of the halting-places. From Zaranj the road east went to Hariiri on the Khwash river, whence taking a straight line across the desert the city of Bust was reached in five marches. At Bust the roads bifurcated, one going to the Zamin-Dawar country of the upper Helmund, and another to Banjaway of Rukhkhaj, in the neighbourhood of Kandahar. At Banjaway there was again a bifurcation of the roads, one going north-eastward to Ghaznah, and a second to Sibi, through the town known as Asfanjay. On these routes too it is to be noted that the distances are again given merely in marches, many of the names of the stages being most uncertain 3 . 1 Ykb. 290, 291. 1st. 278, 280. I. H. 327, 328.

The province of Kuhistan, like Sijistan, was generally held to be a dependency of Khurasan by the Arab geographers. Kfihistan means 4 the Mountain Land/ and the province is thus named in accordance with its distinguishing physical features, the hills here being contrasted with the lowlands of Sijistan, lying to the east of Kuhistan on the Helmund delta. Kuhistan, as Ibn Hawkal remarks, has for the most part a cold climate from its elevation, and the date palm\ only grew at Tabas Gilaki on the edge of the Great Desert. In the 4th (10th) century the nomad inhabitants of the country were Kurds, who possessed great flocks of sheep and camels. Without doubt this province is identical with the 'Tunocain kingdom' of Marco Polo, who took the names of its two chief cities (Tlin and Kayin) to be the designation of the whole country 1 . The chief town of Ktihistan was Kayin, which Ibn Hawkal describes as protected by a strong fortress, surrounded by a ditch; and the governor's house stood here, also the Friday Mosque. 1 1st. 273, 274. I. H. 324, 325. Muk. 301. Marco Polo, Yule, i. 87, 131. The name is spelt Kuhistan by the Arabs (with dotted K), and Kuhistan in Persian, where Ktih means 'mountain,' but the first vowel in the name is as often as not written short (Kuhistan or Kuhistan).CHAP. XXV] KUHISTAN. 353 Water was supplied by underground channels, but the gardens were not very fruitful or numerous, for the cold was severe in winter. The city had three gates, and its merchants carried on a considerable trade with Khurasan. Ibn Hawkal adds that at a place two days^ march from Kayin, on the Nishaptir road, a kind of edible clay, called Tin Najcthi, was found, and this, he says, was exported to all the neighbouring lands and largely eaten by the people. Kayin was visited in 444 (1052) by Nasir-i-Khusraw, who describes the inner town as forming a fortress of great strength. The Great Mosque here had in its sanctuary [Maksurah) the largest arch to be seen in all Khurasan, and the houses of the town, he says, had all domed roofs. Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century notes in the first place the central position of Kayin, which was, he says, just 20 leagues distant from every other important place in Ktahistan. It was a fine city: all the houses were supplied with water by channels below ground, and had cellar-rooms for the hot weather. The crops matured here very rapidly, and the harvest was early. Corn, fruit, and especially saffron were grown largely in the neighbourhood, and the cattle pastured on these lands quickly put on fat. Mustawfi adds that the population were remarkably dark-skinned. The city of Ttin lies rather over fifty miles to the westward of Kayin, and a little to the north. Mukaddasi speaks of it as a populous place, smaller than Kayin, protected by a castle and possessing a fine mosque. Woollen goods were manufactured here, and Nasir-i-Khusraw praises its carpets, 400 looms being at work at the time when he passed through the town. Much of the city, however, was in his day in ruin, though the great fort remained. In the eastern suburbs were many fine gardens where pistachios were cultivated. Mustawfi states that Ttln had originally been built ' on the plan of a Chinese town,' but he does not further explain the matter. He speaks of the great castle with its deep dry-ditch; this was surrounded by the streets and bazaars of the outer town. The neighbouring lands were very fertile, for he says that the people had the art of building dykes or dams (band) to collect the rain-water and prevent it from flowing away, and on these lands they raised water-melons, noted for their sweet flavour. Much corn and fruit was grown, L e S. 23KUHISTAN. and silk was produced here abundantly, for the climate of Ttin was temperate, and the underground watercourses very numerous 1 . In the north-west corner of Kiihistan is the district of Blisht, Ptisht, or Busht-al-'Arab, of which the chief towns were Turshiz and Kundur 2 . In the Arab geographers the older form of the name is given as Turaythith, or Turthith, later spelt Turshish and Turshis, and it was sometimes counted as of the Haivniah or domain of Nishapur. Ibn Hawkal speaks of Turshiz as a very populous city, with fertile lands, and in the Piisht district there were seven other townships with Friday Mosques. Mukaddasi describes the mosque of Turshiz as in his day rivalling that of Damascus for magnificence; there was also a famous water tank, and the markets were renowned, so that Turshiz was considered the c store-house of Khurasan/ where merchandise was exported and imported, to and from Fars and Isfahan. The neighbouring town of Kundur almost equalled Turshiz in wealth, and in the district immediately round it were 226 large villages. According to Ibn-al-Athir in 520 (1126) the Wazir of Sultan Sanjar the Saljill^ besieged and plundered Turshiz, which had lately come into the possession of the Ismailis, or Assassins; for the 4 Old Man of the Mountain ? had recently conquered most of the strong places in the neighbourhood, building many fortresses to overawe all this part of Kiihistan. Yak tit places the advent of the Ismailis as occurring in the year 530 (1136), and relates that the governor of Turshiz had called in the Turkish tribes to aid him against the heterodox Mulahids or Ismailians, but they had failed to fight the enemy, and had themselves pillaged the country, thus bringing Turshiz to ruin. In the middle of the 1 I. H. 324, 325. Muk. 321. N. K. 95. Mst. 184. There is an inscrip tion in the mosque at Kayin dated 796 (1394). Sir F. Goldsmid, Eastern Persia, i. 341. 2 The district of Turshiz exists at the present day, but no town of that name. The small town of Kundur is still marked on the map, and according to Istakhri the city of Turshiz lay one march to the westward of it, which would place the site of Turshiz at the Firuzabad ruins, near the present village of 'Abdulabad. In any case the medieval city of Turshiz cannot be identified with Sultanabad, the modern capital of the Turshiz district, for this lies east of Kundur.XXV] KUHLSTAN. 355 7 th (13th) century Htilagti Khan, the Mongol, destroyed the power of the Assassins, and his troops, it is stated, conquered seventy of their castles in the Ktlhistan province. After this Turshiz quickly recovered its importance; and less than a century later it is described by Mustawfi as one of the chief cities of Kuhistan, though still partly in decay. He mentions the four famous castles in the neighbourhood of the place—namely, Kal'ah Bardartid, KaPah Mikal (or Haykal), Mujahidabad (the Champion's Home), and Atishgah (the fire-temple)—which doubtless had been those of the Ismailians. He praises the abundant crops of Turshiz, which he says were exported to all the northern districts round Nishaptir. At the close of the 8th (14th) century Turshiz was deemed impreg nable from its high walls; but when Timtir appeared before it he soon undermined these, and after the sack nothing but ruins remained standing. This was in 783 (1381) and since that time Turshiz has disappeared from the map 1 . Mustawfi states that at the village of Kishmar, near Turshiz, had stood the celebrated cypress-tree, originally planted by Zoroaster as a memorial of the conversion of King Gushtasp to the Magian religion. This tree grew to be larger than any other cypress that had ever been, and according to the Shah Ndmah it sprang from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise. Such too was its power that earthquakes, which frequently devastated all the neighbouring districts, never did any harm in Kishmar. According to Kazvini the Caliph Mutawakkil in 247 (861) caused this mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across all Persia, in pieces carried on camels, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. This was done in spite of the grief and protests of all the Guebres, but when the cypress arrived on the 1 I. H. 295,296. Muk. 317, 318. Yak. i. 628; iii. 534; iv. 309. Mst. 183. A. Y. i. 344. Ibn-al-Athir, x. 445. The representative of the Old Man of the Mountain, at the present day (as was proved in the English law courts), is Aka Khan, chief of the Khujah community at Bombay, and it is curious to find that some of the Ismailian sect still linger in Kuhistan, who now pay their tithes to Aka Khan, as their predecessors did to the chief at Alamut. At the village of Sihdih, to the south of Kayin, Major Sykes [Persia, p. 409) found nearly a thousand families of these modern Ismailians, who yearly transmitted a considerable sum to their religious head in India. Marco Polo, Yule, i. 145.356 KUHISTAN. banks of the Tigris, Mutawakkil was dead, having been murdered by his son 1 . To the east of the Turshiz district is that of Zavah. The Zavah district, or part of it, was also known as Rukhkh, and the chief town was called Bishak or Zavah city. The name Rukhkh, when Yakut wrote, was more commonly pronounced Rikh. In the 7th (13th) century Zavah town became celebrated as the abode of a very holy man, Haydar by name, who dressed in felt, in summer was wont to enter the fire, and in winter to stand in the snow, and who founded a sect of Darvishes known as the Haydariyah. He was alive at the time of the Mongol % invasion of the country in 617 (1220), and was afterwards known as Shaykh Kutb-ad-Din (Pole of Religion). When Ibn Battitah visited Zavah in the 8th (14th) century, he describes the votaries of the Shaykh as having iron rings fastened for penance in their ears, hands, and other parts of the body, and this the people took to be a proof of their sanctity. Mustawfi describes Zavah as a fine town, standing in a rich district, with some 50 dependent villages. It had a strong castle built of clay bricks. The irrigation was abundant; corn, cotton, grapes, and much fruit grew here, and silk also was produced. He speaks, too, of the shrine of the Shaykh as greatly venerated in his day. At the present time Zavah is more commonly the name of the district, the town being generally known as Turbat-i-Haydan, or 'the Tomb of Haydar,' and the shrine is still a place of pilgrimage 2 . To the east of the Zavah district, and in the north-east corner of Ktihistan, near the Herat river, was the district of Zam or Jam, of which the chief town was in the 4th (10th) century known as Bilzjan. This was a considerable city, and 180 villages were of 1 Mst. 183. SM/i Ndmah, Turner Macan, iv. 1067, eight lines from below. Kaz. ii. 297, where the name is by mistake printed Kishm. The account in Kazvini (13th century A.D.) of course only represents the tradition. There is nothing about the Kishmar cypress in Tabari or apparently in any of the earlier Arab chronicles. An amplified version of the story will be found in the Dabistdn, a work of the 16th century A.D. (transl. by Shea and Troyer, i. 306—309). The cypress of Zoroaster is reckoned to have been 1450 years old. It is possibly the origin of Marco Polo's 'Arbre Sol which we Christians call Arbre Sec.' Yule, Marco Polo, i. 131. 2 Muk. 319.

The name Biizjan was pronounced IMzkan by the Persians, and in later times it was written Ptichkan. In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi describes it, under the name of Jam, as occupying a most fruitful and well-watered district, yielding much silk, for the mulberry-trees grew abundantly. The town was celebrated for the number of its shrines, for many holy men had been buried here, and Ibn Battitah specially names the saintly Shihab-ad-Din Ahmad-al-Jami, whose descendants had come to own much land in the neighbourhood. The saint indeed was so celebrated that Timilr, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, visited his shrine in person, and at the present day the town, which is still a flourishing place, is commonly known as Shaykh Jam 1 . The district of Bakharz, or Guwakharz, lies to the south of Jam, and to the westward of the Herat river, which here takes its northern course. The chief town of Bakharz was Malin, which from the distances in the Itineraries would appear to have been identical in position with the modern city of Shahr-i-Naw, £ New Town/ and in the 4th (10th) century it was already a populous place. From here both corn and grapes were exported, and cloth- stuffs were also manufactured. Yakilt explains that the name Bakharz had originally, in Persian, been Bad-Harzah, 4 the place where the wind blows,' and he mentions Jawdhakan as among its chief villages, of which 128 might be counted round and about Malin. Mustawfi, w r ho gives the name of the chief town as Malan, expatiates on its fertility, and especially refers to the 4 long melon' of this country, which was famous throughout Khurasan 2 . South-west of Bakharz is the district of Khwaf (earlier Khwab), surrounding the chief town of the same name. Khwaf in the 4th (10th) century was famous for its raisins and pomegranates. Saltimak, later w T ritten Salam, had in early times been the largest town of the district, of which Sanjan (or Sankan) and Kharjird were two other important cities. Under the form Kharkird the 1 I.

[CHAP. latter town is mentioned by Ibn Hawkal, who also names Farkird (written Farjird or Faljird by Yaktit) as lying one march to the east of it, while Kilsiiy or Kustiyah was nearer the Herat river, and to the north of Farkird. Of these three towns Kiistiy was the largest, being a third of the size of the neighbouring city of Biishanj in Khurasan, to be described later, to which province many authorities count all three places to belong. The town of Ktisiiy possessed many good houses of unburnt brick, and the other two towns, though small, had fine gardens and abundant irrigation. Yaktlt also mentions Sirawand and Laz as places of importance in his day in the Khwaf district, but their position is unknown. Mustawfi praises the grapes, melons, pomegranates, and figs of Khwaf, and states that much silk was produced in the district. He names the three towns of Salam, Sanjan, and Zawzan (or Ztizan) as the chief centres of population in the 8th (14th) century. Zfrzan when Mukaddasi wrote was already famous for its wool-workers, and it was an important point in the road system, for it communicated with Kayin, Salam (Saltimak), and Farjird. Yakfit calls Zuzan 4 a little Basrah' for its trade, and refers to it as a shrine of the Magians. Around it lay 124 important villages 1 . In this central part of Kfihistan, Mustaw T fi, writing in the 8th (14th) century, mentions a number of places which are still found on the map, but which do not occur in the works of the earlier Arab geographers. He refers to the district of Zirktih, ' Foot-hills/ as most fertile, producing corn and cotton, which with its silk manufactures were largely exported. This is still the name of the hill country south, of Zuzan and east of Kayin, and Mustawfi mentions its three chief towns, Sharakhs, Isfad, and Istind, which exist to this day. To the north-west of Kayin is the district the name of which is written Dasht-Biyad, meaning ' the White Plain/ which the Persians at the present day pronounce Dasht-i-Piyaz. Its chief town was Faris, and Mustawfi, who praises its nuts and almonds, says it was the Yaylak, or summer quarters, of the people of Tlin and Junabad. 1 1st. 267. I. H. 313, 319. I. R. 171.

Yate, Khurasan and Sistan, 128, 129.XXV] KUH1STAN. 359 This last place, now generally called Gunabad, is a considerable town lying to the north-east of Tun. It is named by Ibn Hawkal Yunabidh, and by Mukaddasi Junawad, and there are some other variants. It was a large place in the 4th (10th) century, with clay- brick houses, and the 70 villages round it were well watered by artificial irrigation. Yaldit gives the name as commonly pro nounced Gunabidh, for Junabidh. Mustawfi records that its two strong castles, each on a hill, and on either hand of the town, were called Kal'ah Khawashir and KaPah Darjan respectively, and from their heights the neighbouring villages, and the desert beyond them, were clearly seen. The sand here, he remarks, did not blow into and invade the garden lands of Gunabad, as was the case elsewhere in Ktihistan. The water-supply was from underground channels, described as often four leagues in length, coming from springs in the hill-flank, and the terminal shafts or wells at the fountain-head, were, he avers, sometimes as much as 700 ells (gez) in depth. Much silk was manufactured here, and corn was exported. Some thirty miles to the north-west of Gunabad, and a like distance due north of Tftn, is the small town of Bajistan, which appears to be first mentioned by Yaktit, who speaks of it as a village in his day; and to this Mustawfi adds that it resembled Tiin, but gives no further details 1 . There were, and still are, two towns called Tabas in Ktihistan, and for this reason the name often appears in the Arab geo graphers under the dual form of Tabasayn. Moreover the name Tabasayn, in error, is sometimes applied to one or other of these two towns, the dual form for the single place. The Arab geographers, however, clearly distinguish between the two towns, calling one Date Tabas, the other Tabas of the Jujube-tree, or T abas-al-'U nnab. Tabas of the Date—Tabas-at-Tamr—was on the border of the Great Desert, where many of the roads crossing it came in, and 1 Dasht-Biyad, or Dasht-i-Piyaz, is a composite name, Persian and Arabic, very unusual in the nomenclature of Persia. If the last word be really the Arabic Biyad it seems likely that the Persians soon forgot its meaning ' White,' and took it to be a proper name. I. H. 325. Muk. 319, 320, 322. Mst. 183, 184.

[CHAP. hence Baladhuri names it 4 the Gate of Khurasan.' According to Ibn Hawkal, the town was in the 4th (10th) century a somewhat smaller place than Kayin, and it had strong fortifications. The chief feature of the district was the forest of date palms that grew here, for being on the desert border the climate w T as very hot, and the water-supply from underground channels was abundant. Mukaddasi speaks of its fine mosque, and of a great tank for storing the drinking-water. There were also excellent hot baths. £ It is (he adds) the only place in Kiihistan where there are trees and a running stream; and for the distance of a day's journey thence I passed through villages and palm-groves with running water courses.' Nasir-i-Khusraw, who passed through Tabas in 444 (1052), speaks of it as a fine, populous town, unwalled, but enclosed in its gardens and palm-groves. It was then governed with a strong hand, so that all the neighbourhood was perfectly safe, by a certain Abu-l-Hasan ibn Muhammad Gilaki— 4 the native Gilan'—and to distinguish this from the other Tabas, it appears in later days to have been called Tabas Gilaki, after this famous governor, who, from what Nasir writes, must have been known far and wide for the vigour of his rule. In the second half of the 5th (i ith) century Tabas passed into the hands of the Ismailian heretics, and in 494 (1102) the town was besieged and in part destroyed by the army sent against the Assassins by Sultan Sanjar the Saljtik. Yakiit and Mustawfi both refer to Tabas of the Date as Tabas Gilaki, and the latter authority notices the place both in his account of the Great Desert, and when describing Kiihistan. Besides dates, both lemons and oranges flourished here as they did nowhere else in all Khurasan, and the water of the neighbouring spring flowed in sufficient abundance to turn two mills. A strong for tress protected the town and the numerous villages lying around the place 1 . On the desert border north of Tabas, and about half-way to Turshiz, was the village of Bann, possessing a population of 500 males when Ibn Hawkal wrote, and this place was apparently identical with the stage of Afridun mentioned by Ibn Khur- 1 Baladhuri, ^03. I. H. 324, 325. Muk. 321, 322. N. K. 94. Yak. iii. 5 I 3&gt; 5 I 4j iv* 333' Mst, 183, 184. Ibn-al-Athir, x. 221.XXV] KtJHISTAN, 361 dadbih. Ibn Hawkal apparently mentions in his itinerary another village called Bann (Bann Ukhra), but by the distances given the two stages, if not identical, must have had reference merely to two neighbouring villages of the same name. At the present day Bann is represented by Dih Naband (not to be confounded with the oasis in the desert of that name described on p. 325). It was an important point where one of the desert roads from Jarmak entered Kiihistan 1 . Some three leagues to the south-east of Tabas, on the edge of the desert where the Shur road from Kuhbanan came in, was Kun or Kurin, which Baladhun mentions as one of the two fortresses of Tabas, which it would appear might justify the name of Tabasayn being given to Date Tabas alone. Ibn Hawkal describes Kuri as a meeting point of many roads, where stood a village of a thousand men with many farms. Kurin, as Mukaddasi spells the name, w T as a smaller place than Tabas; and of its dependencies—being 12 leagues from Tabas and 20 from Tun—was the village of Ar-Rakkah. This last place, when Nasir-i- Khusraw visited it in 444 (1052), had grown to be a fine town, with a Friday Mosque surrounded by numerous well-irrigated gardens. About three marches to the south-east of Tabas w T ere the two towns of Khur and Khawst, w T hich respectively were the terminal stages of the two roads across the desert from Ravar and Khabis in Kirman (see pp. 327, 328). Khtir, according to Ibn Hawkal, was smaller than Tabas, but had a Friday Mosque ; the water-supply was scanty and there were hardly any gardens. The place, too, according to Mukaddasi, was unfortified. Khawst on the other hand, though in the 4th (10th) century it had no Friday Mosque, was a place of greater importance. It was well fortified, with a castle to defend it, and the clay-brick houses of the town were surrounded by small gardens, though here too the watercourses gave but a poor supply. Mukaddasi says the town was larger but less populous than Tun; there were but few trees, and behind it rose the arid hills of Kfihistan. Yaktit by mistake generally spells the name Jusf, this being a clerical error for Khusf or Khusb, which is the modern form of the name, first given by Mustawfi. Yaktit, it is true, acknowledges his 1 I. K. 52. 1st. 231, 236. I. H. 295.362 kCthistAn. [chap. ignorance and uncertainty of the true pronunciation of the name, which he says is sometimes written Jtizf: but in one passage he rightly gives Khawst, when quoting from Mukaddasi. As just stated the modern spelling first appears in Mustawfi, who describes Kht^sf as a small town, with some dependencies, watered by a stream which irrigated its lands, so that excellent crops were produced 1 . About 20 miles east of Khvlsf lies Birjand, which at the present day has taken the place of Kayin as the capital town of K6histan. Birjand is not mentioned, apparently, by any of the Arab geo graphers before Yaktit, who in the 7th (13th) century speaks of it as one of the finest villages of this province. Mustawfi in the following century refers to it as an important provincial town, surrounded by many fruitful farms and villages, where, in addition to grapes and other fruits, an abundance of saffron was cultivated. Corn, however, grew badly here. A day's journey to the east of Birjand, is the mountain district still known as Mtiminabad—'the Believer's Home'—which Mustawfi mentions as dominated by a strong fortress that had formerly been in the hands of the Assassins. This district included many fine villages ; and Mustawfi especially mentions Shakhin, on a stream called the Fasha Rild, which still exists some three days' march to the south-east of Kayin 2 . About 50 miles due east of Birjand is the second town of labas, known to the Arab geographers as Tabas-al-'Unnab, 'of the Jujube-tree,' which the Persians called Tabas Masinan. This town Ibn Hawkal describes in the 4th (10th) century as larger than Yunabidh (Gunabad, north-west of Kayin); its houses were built of clay bricks, but the fortifications were then in ruins, and there was no castle. Mukaddasi speaks of the numerous jujube- trees growing here. Kazvini in the 7th (13th) century states that on the summit of a neighbouring hill was the village called Iravah, where there was a fine castle, and gardens with trees, for many 1 Baladhuri, 403. 1st. 232, 274. i. h. 291, 325.

Major Sykes, who spells the name Shahkm, speaks of an ancient fort near this, possibly that mentioned as formerly held by the Assassins.XXV] kuhist A n. 3 6 3 streams flowed near the place. Mustawfi remarks of labas Masinan that the water-supply of the town lands during a drought would hold out for 70 days, while the outlying districts only had sufficient water for seven days. He relates that there was here a pit or well, at the bottom of which the earth was poisonous, so that if anyone by chance swallowed thereof even as much as a grain of millet seed, he forthwith died ; hence the water from this well had been carefully closed off. There was another pit or well here which in winter swallowed up all inflowing water, and in summer gave forth continuously enough water to irrigate all the neighbouring lands; and there was also a third well, he says, where, when anyone looked down into it, the image of a fish could be seen. At the present day Tabas Masinan, still bearing this distinctive name, is an important place, being also known as Sunm-khanah (the House of the Sunnis), for it is now inhabited almost exclusively by Afghan Sunnis. About 60 miles south of Tabas of the Jujube-tree, is the village of Duruh, where there is an ancient fortress on the neighbouring hill-top. Duruh is ap parently not mentioned by the earlier geographers. It is first described by Mustawfi, who speaks of Kal'ah Duruh as being a very strong place, with a spring of water welling up within the castle precincts. Jujube-trees and corn grew abundantly in the vicinity, with grapes and other fruit in less profusion. The products of Ktlhistan were few in number. Mukaddasi states briefly that these highlands were famous for their carpets and prayer rugs, also for white cloth-stuffs, similar to those that were made in Nishapilr 1 . What is known about the high roads crossing Kuhistan will be more conveniently dealt with in a later chapter in connection with the roads through Khurasan. Mukaddasi and other authorities mention the total distances, by the day's march, between the various towns in K^histan : but the stages in leagues are not given; and there appear to have been few direct routes crossing this mountainous province. 1 1. h. 325.

The small province of Kilmis stretches along the foot of the great Alburz chain of mountains which will be described below, and these heights bound it to the north, its fertile lands forming a narrow T strip lying between the foot-hills and the Great Desert to the south. The Khurasan road traverses the province from end to end, going from Ray in the Jibal province to Nishapdr in Khurasan, and the chief towns of Kumis are, so to speak, strung along this line. At the present day the name Kumis is become obsolete. The province is included for the most part within the limits of modern Khurasan, while its extreme western end forms an outlying district of Ray or modern Tihran 1 . The capital town of the province was Damghan, which the Arabs wrote Ad-Damghan, and which in accordance with their usage is often referred to as Ktimis (sc. Madinah Kiimis, 'the 1 For the map of these provinces see p. 185, Map v. Muk. 353. Yak. iv. 203. Mst. 191.

Damghan, according to Ibn Hawkal, had a paucity of water-supply, and hence little cultivation, but the inhabitants manufactured excellent cloth-stuffs which were largely exported. Mukaddasi reports Damghan to have fallen much to ruin at the end of the 4th (10th) century; but it was well fortified, and had three gates, of which he names two, the Bab-ar-Ray and the Bab Khurasan. He says that there were two markets, the upper and the lower; and a fine Friday Mosque stood in the main street, with water tanks 'like those of Marv. ; The extraordinary windiness of the town is mentioned by all the later authorities. Yakfit and others state that there was a ceaseless wind blowing down from a neighbouring valley, so that the trees of Damghan were always waving about. Within the city was a great building, dating from the days of the Chosroes, which divided the waters flowing to Damghan into 120 channels for irrigation purposes. Excellent pears were grown in the town gardens. The walls of Damghan, Mustawfi reports, were 10,000 paces in circuit. Yaktit adds that one day's journey from Damghan (three leagues according to Mustawfi) up in the mountains, and visible from the town,'was the great castle of Gird-kfih, which had been a celebrated fortress of the Assassins. This, writes Mustawfi, was called Diz Gunbadan, 'the Domed Fort/ and its district, which was very fertile, was known as Manstkabad. Mustawfi further speaks of a gold mine in the hills near Damghan at K6h Zar (Gold Mountain), but the situation of the place is not given 1 . The second town of Kiknis, for size, was Bistam (or Bastam, now Bustam), which Ibn Hawkal states to have been situated in the most fertile region of the whole province. Its gardens produced abundant fruit, and Mukaddasi refers to its magnificent Friday Mosque, which stood £ like a fortress' in the market-place. Nasir-i-Khusraw, who visited the town in 438 (1046), appears to regard it as the capital of the province, for he calls it the City of Kilmis. He refers to the tomb here, already celebrated, of the great Stifi Shaykh Abu Yazid, more generally known as Bayazid Bistami, who had died and was buried here in 260 (874), 1 I. K. 23. Kud. 201. I.

YaMt, speaking from personal experience, praises the apples of Bistam, and says that on a neighbouring hill-top stood a great castle with strong walls, said to date from the days of the Chosroes, having been built by Shapiir DhM-Aktaf (Sapor II). YaMt also commends the markets of the city, and its general air of prosperity, and Ibn Batutah who visited it in the 8th (14th) century .confirms this account, referring also to the shrine over the tomb of the Stifi saint 1 . Four leagues from Bistam, on the road towards Astarabad, was the town of Khurkan, a place of some importance in the 7th and 8th (13th and 14th) centuries. Mustawfi refers to it as a village, with a good climate and plentiful water-supply, and it was famous for the tomb of the local saint Abu-l-Hasan Kharkani. About 50 miles south-east of Bistam, and on the edge of the Great Desert, is the little town of Biyar, 4 the Wells,' which is now called Biyar- Jumand. Mukaddasi describes it in the 4th (10th) century as a small town with no Friday Mosque, but possessing a castle, good markets, and fertile fields, where grapes and other fruits were produced. Camels and sheep were also numerous. A small mosque for daily prayers stood in the inner castle, and the town was fortified, having three iron gates in its walls, with a single gate leading to the castle precincts. Mustawfi speaks favourably of the temperate climate and excellent corn crops. Less than half-way between Damghan and Ray is the city of Samnan, or Simnan, on the Khurasan road, of which Mukaddasi notices the fine Friday Mosque standing in the market-place, with its great water tanks. Mustawfi mentions the pistachios of Samnan as famous, and a varied abundance of fruit was grown. He also mentions Ahiivan, a small town lying between Samnan and Damghan, noteworthy for several tombs of holy men, and for the plentiful crops of both corn and fruit that were raised in its neighbourhood 2 . 1 I.

Khurkan36; The westernmost town of Kumis, also on the Khurasan road, and the first important place east of Ray, was Khuvar, written Al-Khuwar by the Arabs, which Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes as a pleasant little town, a quarter of a mile in diameter, very populous, with streams that came down from the great Damavand mountain flowing through its lands. Khuvar, he adds, was the coldest place of all K6niis, but its fields were very fertile. Kazvini says that much cotton was grown here for export; and Mustawfl records that the place was also famous for its corn and 'ShaMk,' or rice in the husk. To distinguish this from the town of the like name in Fars (see p. 279) it was generally spoken of as Khuvar of Ray, and it is thus mentioned in the campaigns of Timilr. Mustawfi, further, says that this Khuvar was also known as Mahallah-i-Bagh—' the Garden Place '—in Persian. Of the products of Kumis, Mukaddasi states that a peculiarly valuable kind of cotton napkin was made in this province. These famous napkins {mandtl) were woven large and small, plain and ribbed, with a coloured border, and of so fine a texture as to fetch 2000 dirhams (about ^80) apiece. Ktlmis also produced woollen stuffs for robes, and the head-veils called tay las an \ As we have seen, the province of Kiimis was traversed in its length by the great Khurasan road, and this is given in all the Itineraries, from Ibn Khurdadbih down to Mustawfi. Leaving Ray the road goes in three marches to Khuvar, one march beyond which was K a ? r o r Kariyat-al-Milh (Salt Castle or Village), in Persian called Dih Namak, as given by Mustawfi, which is its present name. The next stage, according to all the Itineraries, was Ras-al-Kalb, 'Dog's Head,' a name not now found on the map, but the situation is that of the strange fortress-town of Lasgird (a name wanting in all the medieval is the pronunciation given by Kazvini; the name is identical in form (without vowels) with Kharrakan in the Jibal province, with which it must not be con founded. 1 I.

Samnan is one long march beyond this, and Damghan (which the earlier Itineraries give as Kumis) again one long march to the eastward. One march beyond Damghan was Al- Haddadah (the Forge), which in Mustawfi is given under the alternative name of Mihman-Dflst (' Guest Friend'). From here it was a day's march up to Bistam or keeping the lower road the stage was at the post-house, lying two leagues from that city, which was, and is still, known as the village of Badhash, from which you enter the province of Khurasan, going by the post-road to Nishapilr. Further, Mukaddasi gives the road, in 3 days' march, from Bistam to Biyar, and from Biyar it was 25 leagues across the desert back west to Damghan 1 . Tabaristan or The region of high mountains,—for the most part occupied by what is, at the present day, known as the Alburz chain 2 lying along the south coast of the Caspian Sea, being to the east and 1 I.

Bellew, From the Indus to the Tigris, p. 404. In regard to Badhash it is curious that Yakut in his Dictionary gives the name once rightly spelt, and then again (but in error) under the letter n as Nadhash. Yak. i. 530; iv. 773. 2 Alburz, now generally pronounced Elburz, is the name at the present time given to the great mountain range dividing the high plateau of Persia from the lowlands of the Caspian Sea. This name, however, appears in none of the earlier Arab geographers, who give no single appellation to the range. Alburz is Persian, and according to Vullers {Lexicon Persico-Latinum , s.v.) is derived from two Zend words signifying ' High Mountain.' Mustawft (p. 202), who is perhaps the first authority to mention the name, used it in a very vague sense. In his chapter on the mountains of Persia he says that Alburz is a high range that runs continuous with the mountains of Bab-al- Abwab (i.e. the Caucasus): 'they are indeed the great mountains which are continuous, and form a chain, extending for over a thousand leagues, from Turkistan (in Central Asia) to the Hijaz (in Arabia), so that many consider them to be the (fabled) mountains of Kaf (which encircled the earth) and on the west they adjoin the mountains of Gurjistan (Georgia).' For the Alburz peak of the Caucasus see above, p. 181.xxvi] kCmis, tabaristAn, and jurjAn. 369 to the north of Kiimis,—was called Tabaristan by the earlier Arab geographers. Tatar has the signification of 'Mountain' in the local dialect, whence Tabaristan would mean 'the Mountain Land.' In the 7 th (13th) century, about the time of the Mongol conquest, the name of Tabaristan appears to have fallen into disuse, being replaced by Mazandaran, which since that date has been the common appellation of this province. Some times also Mazandaran was held to include the neighbouring province of Jurjan. Yaklit, who is one of the first to mention the name Mazandaran, writes that he does not know exactly when it came into use; and, though never found in the older books, it was in his day already generally current throughout the country. Prac tically the terms I abaristan and Mazandaran were then synony mous, but while the former name was applied primarily to the high mountains, and only included in a secondary use the narrow strip of lowland along the sea-shore running from the delta of the Safid Rud to the south-eastern angle of the Caspian, Mazandaran appears in the first instance to have denoted these lowlands, and then included the mountain region as subsidiary thereto. The name Tabaristan is at the present day obsolete. During the earlier period of the Caliphate this province was politically of little importance, and it was in fact the last portion of the Sassanian kingdom to accept Islam. For more than a century after the Arab conquest of the rest of Persia the native rulers—called the Ispahbads of Tabaristan—were inde pendent in their mountain fastnesses, and until the middle of the 2nd (8th) century their coinage continued to be struck with Pahlavi legends, and the Zoroastrian faith was dominant throughout the forests and fens of the great mountain range. In the 4th (10th) century, according to Mukaddasi, garlic, rice, and flax, with water fowl and fish, were the chief products of the country, which, unlike the rest of Persia, had an abundant rainfall. At a later date, according to Kazvini, sericulture flourished, silk being plentifully exported. Wool-stuffs, carpets, veils, napkins, and cloth-stuffs were also largely manufactured, and various woods were cut in the forests, especially box-wood and that called Khalanj, of which arrows, bowls, and other utensils, were made. The houses in Tabaristan were built of wood and reeds, for, as Ibn Hawkal L e s. 2437° Kt)MIS, TABARISTAN, AND JURJAN. [CHAP. remarks, the rains were heavy, both summer and winter. They were built with domed roofs for the like reason 1 . The capital of Tabaristan under the later Abbasids was Amul, though the Tahirid governor, in the 3rd (9th) century, had generally resided at Sariyah. Amul, according to Ibn Hawkal, was in his day a larger place than Kazvin and very populous. Mukaddasi describes the town as possessing a hospital (Bimar- istan) and two Friday Mosques—one, the Old Mosque, standing among trees on the market-place, the New Mosque being near the city wall. Each mosque had a great portico. The merchants of Amul did much trade. Rice was grown plentifully in the country round, and a large river which ran through the town was used for the irrigation of the fields. To this description YaMt adds no new details, but Mustawfi, remarking on the hot, damp climate, says that dates, grapes, nuts, oranges, shaddocks, and lemons grew here abundantly, and the fragrant essences made in the city were celebrated far and wide. The port of Amul, where its river flowed out into the Caspian, was the small town of 'Ayn-al- Humm, a name which Yakut writes Ahlum, and describes as of no great size. Timur ravaged Amul at the close of the 8th (14th) century, destroying the three castles of Mahanah Sar, which lay four leagues distant from the city towards the sea-coast. The second, and the earlier, capital of Tabaristan was Sariyah, now called Sari, which lies to the eastward of Amul. Mukaddasi describes Sariyah as a populous place where much cloth was manufactured, and its markets were famous. There was a small castle with a ditch, and a Friday Mosque where a fine orange-tree grew, also an immense fig-tree on the town bridge. The bridges of boats here were renowned. Of Sariyah in later times little is reported; it suffered much in the 7th (13th) century during the Mongol invasion, and when Mustawfi wrote was almost a complete ruin, though its lands produced an abundance of grapes and corn, and silk was still manufactured from the produce of the worms reared here 2 . 1 I.

In Persian legend Dunbavand, as the name is written by the earlier authorities, figures as the home of the Simurgh, the fabulous bird which nursed and protected Zal, the father of Rustam, and Mustawfi relates a number of romantic stories in connection with the national hero. According to Ibn Hawkal the great mountain was visible from Savah, 'rising up like a dome in the midst of the other high mountains,' and he was of opinion that no one had ever climbed to the summit, from which, he adds, smoke was always seen to issue. Magicians much frequented it, and many legends were told of it, relating more especially how that ancient tyrant of Persia, Ad-Duhhak (Zuhak), still lived in its recesses. Damavand gave its name both to a small town lying on its southern spurs, which Mustawfi writes was also called Pishyan, and to the broad fertile district spreading round its flanks. Of this district, in the 4th (10th) century, the chief town was Wimah, which with the neighbouring town of Shalanbah, are described by Ibn Hawkal as places famous for their corn lands and vine yards. Yakut, who had passed through Wimah (or Waymah) and found it a ruin, states that the castle of Firuzkuh was visible from it. This latter castle he had also visited, and Mus tawfi records that it took its water from the head of the stream that flowed out to the plain through Khuvar of Ray in Kilmis. Firuzkuh was one of the castles of Mazandaran which are men tioned as having been besieged and taken by Timur. Another equally famous fortress on the slopes of Damavand was the castle of Ustunavand, or Ustunabad, which, according to Kazvini, had never been taken for 3000 years, till in 613 (1216) the Mongols stormed it. Yakut, who says it was also called Jar hud and lay 10 leagues distant from Ray, describes it as having been the stronghold of the ancient Magian ruler of the country, the Ispahbad. The last of the line, he adds, was overthrown here by Yahya the Barmecide, who carried captive the daughters of the Persian chief to Baghdad, where one of them, called 24—2372 Bahriyyah, married the Caliph Mansiir and became the mother of Mahdi, the father of Hartin-ar-Rashid. At a later date this great fortress, which had been restored in 350 (961) by Fakhr-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, fell into the hands of the Assassins ^ The medieval geographers mention the names of many for tresses and towns in Tabaristan which are no longer to be found on the map, having been brought to ruin either in the Mongol invasion of the 7th (13th) century, or else stormed and destroyed by TimQr, who ravaged Mazandaran more than once at the close of the 8th (14th) century. Moreover, the names of most of these lost towns and fortresses not occurring in the Itineraries, it is impossible to mark their position, even approximately, on the map. Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes three mountain districts, well wooded and very fertile, which lay south of Sariyah, about a day's march from this town, and stretching westward towards the frontier of Daylam, in the province of Gilan. The first of these was the Jabal Fadusban, the Mountains of Badiisban (in the Persian form of the word), this being the name of the ruling family, who as semi-independent chiefs held these districts for nearly 800 years, namely from the time of the Moslem conquest down to the Mongol invasion. The whole of this mountain district was covered with villages, of which the largest was named Kariyat Manser, ' Manser's Village,' and another was Uram Khast or Uram Khastah with an upper and a lower village, these places all lying about a day's march from Sariyah, but throughout the mountain side tha'e was no town of sufficient size to have a Friday Mosque. Adjoining Fadtisban was the mountain district called the Jabal Karin after the famous family of this name, which it is said was of Parthian origin; in any case the names of nobles of the Karin occur in the history of the Sassanians, and in Moslem times they still governed this district. The great fortress strong hold of the Karins, which they had held since Sassanian times, was at Firrim, and the chief centre of population was at the town of Sihmar (or Shihmar) where there was the only Friday Mosque 1 1st. 202. i. h. 265, 270, 271.

Firuzkuh still exists, but the site of Ustunavand appears to be unknown.xxvi] kumis, tabaristAn, and jurjAn. 373 of all this region. The position of Firrim, unfortunately, is not exactly given in any of the Itineraries. It is mentioned by Yaktit, and also in the 8th (14th) century by Mustawfi, who speaks of it as lying on the borders of Kumis. The third mountain region was the Jabal-ar-Rubanj, lying north of Ray, and therefore nearer to the Daylam frontier. Of this no towns or villages are men tioned, but it is said to have been extremely fertile and well watered, the mountain slopes being covered with trees and thickets 1 . One day's march, or five leagues, to the west of Amul, in the plain near the coast, was the town of Natil or Natilah, and a like distance further to the west of this was Salus, or Shales, which Mukaddasi describes as a city having a castle built of stone, with a Friday Mosque adjoining. The name was also spelt Saltish, and near it lay two other towns, namely Al-Kabirah and Kajjah. In the accounts of the campaigns of Timtir Shales is written Jaltis, and all this country appears to have been permanently ruined during his wars, together with the mountainous region to the south, namely Rftyan and Rustamdar 2 . The city of Kalar, which Yaktit seems to think was identical with the above-mentioned Kajjah, was one march from Shaltis, but in the mountains—and from Kalar it was one march on to the Daylam frontier. There is some confusion in the names, but Kalar, Kajjah, and Ruyan appear all to refer to neighbouring towns, if not to one and the same town, and Rliyan further was the name of one of the great districts in the mountains on the 1 1st. 205, 206. I. H. 268, 269. Yak. i. 212; iii. 324, 890. Mst. 191. For Fadusban the reading KddHsiydn has been wrongly printed in the texts of Istakhri and other geographers by a shifting of the diacritical points, and hence these people have often been supposed to represent the ancient Cadusii of Strabo ; see Noldeke, Geschichte der Perser und A raher zur Zeit der Sassa- niden, p. 151, note 2, who explains that under the Sassanians the Badusban were the civil governors of the district, as against the Ispahbads, who were the military commanders of this, the frontier province. See also Justi, Iranisches JSfamenbuch, p. 156, s.v. 'Karen,' and p. 245, s.v. 'Patkospan.' For the list of the Badusban chiefs in Moslem times see G.

Abu-l-Fida says that the city of Rtiyan was also known as Sharistan, and that it crowned the summit of the pass 16 leagues from Kazvin. According to YaMt Ruyan was the capital city of the mountain district of Tabaristan, just as Amul was of the lowland plains; it had fine buildings and its gardens were famous for their productiveness. Near Rtiyan (or Kalar) was the little town of Sa^dabad. The great fortress of Tak (the Arch) on the frontier of Daylam, and the last refuge of the Ispahbad prince of Tabaristan who was conquered in the time of the Caliph Manstir, must have been situated in this district of Rfiyan. The place is described at some length both by Yaktit and Kazvini, who quote older writers. Tak was deemed an impregnable stronghold, and had existed since the days of the Sassanian kings of Persia. It was situated high up in the mountains, and was only reached by a tunnel a mile long (it is said) which had been pierced through the encircling cliffs. The tunnel led to an open valley surrounded by precipices in which were many caverns, and from one of these a powerful spring gushed out, and after flowing a short distance disappeared into the depths of a neighbouring cave. YaMt adds a long account of the wonders of this place. At the head-waters of the great Shah Rud —the eastern affluent of the Safid Rud (see above, p. 170)—lay the district of Rustamdar, which Mustawfi describes as comprising near 300 villages, and this country, which was watered by the numerous tributaries of the Shah Rild, thus lay between Kazvin and Amul, and to the eastward of the Rtiyan district. On the Shah RM, as already described in Chapter XV, p. 221, were the chief castles of the Ismailians or Assassins, and probably in this Rustamdar district also was Kalam, described by Yaktit as an ancient fortress of Tabaristan, which had been in the hands of these sectaries, and was destroyed by Sultan Muhammad, son of Malik Shah the Saljuk 1 . 1 wo leagues to the eastward of Amul, and on the coast road, lay the town of Milah, and three leagues beyond this Barji, which was one march from Sariyah. The city of Mamtir or Mamatir, 1 I. H. 275. Yak. ii. 873; iii. 93, 490, 504; iv. 240, 296, 297. Kaz. ii. 238. A. F. 435. Mst. 190.xxvi] kumis, tabaristAn, and jurjAn. 375 one march from either Amul or Sariyah, and six leagues from the coast, is identical with the later Barfanish. It had a Friday Mosque, YaMt says, and much fertile land lay adjacent to the city. Near Sariyah, and probably to the eastward, were Hi I' the towns called Namiyah (or Namishah), with a fine district, 20 leagues from Sariyah, and Mihrawan, 10 leagues from Sariyah, where there was a Friday Mosque and a garrison of 1000 men, but unfortunately the exact position of these two places is quite uncertain. On the eastern frontier of Tabaristan, and three marches from Sariyah, on the road to Astarabad, from which it was one march distant, lay the town of Tamis, or Tamisah, standing on the great causeway across the marshes which, according to YaMt, had been built to carry the high road by King Anushirwan :i lt« the Just 1 . At the south-east angle of the Caspian is the Bay of Ashuradah, as it is now named, where a long spit of sand stretches out east ward till it almost reaches the Jurjan coast. This bay with its island or peninsula is described by Mustawfi under the name of Nim Murdan. The settlement here was very populous in the 8th (14th) century, and was a harbour for ships from all parts of the Caspian. The port was but three leagues distant from Astarabad, and the town behind it which carried on a brisk trade was called Shahrabad. The neighbouring district, which produced a great deal of silk, and where corn lands and vineyards abounded, was known as KabM Jamah. It had been a very rich country, but was entirely ruined by the wars of limilr at the close of the 8th (14th) century. The city of Ru'ad, or Rtighad, which is also mentioned as passed by Timur on his march into Mazandaran, was probably of the KabM Jamah district. It was, says Mustawfi, a fair-sized town, being 4000 paces in circuit, and it stood in the midst of many fertile lands, where much corn and cotton, besides various fruits, were grown in abundance. Of the products of Tabaristan, besides the commodities already 1 I. H. 275.

[CHAP. referred to on page 369, Mukaddasi mentions fine cloth for robes, and stuffs for the taylasan veils, also coarse linen cloths that were woven largely for export. Of natural products the Khalanj wood already named was cut and sent away in the rough to be made into bowls and other utensils by the craftsmen in Ray. The Khalanj is described as a tree that produced a variegated and sweet-smelling wood, of which the beads of chaplets were some times made, and the best kind grew only on the Tabaristan mountains'. Jurjdn. The province of Jurjan, or Gurgan, as the Persians pronounced the name, lying at the south-eastern corner of the Caspian, con sisted for the most part of the broad plains and valleys watered by the two rivers Jurjan and Atrak. In earlier days it was always held to be a province by itself, though dependent on Khurasan, but after the changes brought about by the Mongol conquest, it was annexed politically to Mazandaran. Like other districts near the southern shore of the Caspian it was overrun and devastated by the Mongol hordes in the 7th (13th) century, and then again by Timtlr at the close of the 8th (14th) century. Jurjan, as Mukaddasi writes, being rich in streams, its plains and hills were covered with orchards producing dates, oranges, and grapes in abundance. The most important river of the province was that generally called by its name, the Jurjan river, which Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century states was then known as the river TayfM. The river Atrak he does not name. In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi gives the name as the Ab -i-Jurjan, and says that the Jurjan river rose in the valley of Shahr-i-Naw (New Town), whence, passing through the plain of Sultan Darin, it reached the city of Jurjan, past which it flowed, and thence entered the Caspian, near the island of Abaskun in the bay of Nim Murdan. Throughout its course the stream was deep, almost 1 Milk. 367. Mst. 190, 191. J. N. 339, 341. A. Y. i. 349. The forms o Ashnradah Bay and of the peninsula have of course changed greatly since the 14th century, when Mustawfi wrote, and the exact sites of the town and port are unknown.XXVI] KUMTS, TABARISTAN, AND JURJAN. 377 unfordable, so that travellers were often drowned in crossing it; and in flood-time its waters were carried off by channels and used up in irrigation, though much always ran to waste. The river Atrak is a longer stream than the Jurjan, and rises in the plains of Khurasan, between Nisa and Khabxishan, near the sources of the Mashhad river, which latter flows off south-east, and in the opposite direction. The Atrak is very deep and like the Jurjan mostly unfordablQ, as Mustawfi writes, and flowing along by the Dihistan frontier, on the northern side of the Jurjan province, reaches the Caspian after a course of nearly 1 20 leagues. The name Atrak is said to be merely a plural form of the word Turk, and the River of the Turks was so called from those who once lived on its banks. No name, however, appears to be given to this stream by any of the earlier Arab geographers, and Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century is one of the first to call it the Atrak, by which appellation it is still known The capital of Jurjan is the city of the same name, at the present day called Min Gurgan, which Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century describes as a fine town, built of clay bricks, enjoying a far drier climate than Amul, for less rain fell in Jurjan than in Tabaristan. The city consisted of two parts, one on either side of the Jurjan river, which was here traversed by a bridge of boats, and Jurjan was more properly the name of the eastern half of the town. On the west side lay Bakrabad, the suburb, and the two parts of the city together, according to the description of Ibn Hawkal, who had been here, were nearly as large as Ray. The fruit from the gardens round w T as abundant, and silk was produced in great quantities. The main quarter of Jurjan, that on the east bank, Mukaddasi calls Shahrastan ; it had fine mosques and markets, where the pomegranates, olives, water-melons, and egg-plants, with oranges, lemons, and grapes of the neighbouring gardens were sold cheaply, and were all of superexcellent flavour. The town was intersected by canals, crossed by arched bridges or by planks laid on boats. A Maydan, or public square, faced the 1 Muk. 354, 367. Mst. 212, 213. J. N. 341. Hfz. 32^.

[chap. governor's palace, and this quarter of the town had nine gates. The defect of Jurjan was the great heat of its climate, and the flies were numerous, as well as other insects, especially bugs of a size so large as commonly to be known as ' the wolves ' (Gurgan). Bakrabadh, as Mukaddasi spells the name, was also a populous city with its own mosques, and the buildings extended back for a considerable distance from the river, and for some distance along its western bank. When Kazvim wrote in the 7th (13th) century Jurjan was famous among the Shfahs for the shrine called Gur-i-Surkh, 4 the Red Tomb,' said to be that of one of the descendants ot 4 All, whom Mustawfi identifies as Muhammad, son of JaTar-as- Sadik, the sixth Imam. Mustawfi reports that the city had been rebuilt by the grandson of Malik Shah the Saljiik, and that its walls were 7000 paces in circuit. In the 8th (14th) century, when he wrote, the town lay for the most part in ruins, never having recovered the ravages of the Mongol invasion. He praises, how ever, the magnificent fruit grown here, and besides those kinds mentioned above names, the jujube-tree as bearing freely here, so that trees which were only two or three years old gave good fruit, twice in each season. The population were all Shi'ahs in his time, but they were not numerous. In the year 795 (1393) Timtir, who had devastated all Mazandaran and the neighbouring country, stopped at Jurjan and built for himself here on the banks of the river the great palace of Shasman, which is especially referred to by Hafiz Abrti 1 . The second city of the Jurjan province is Astarabad, near the frontier of Mazandaran. Mukaddasi describes it as a fine town in the 4th (10th) century, with the best climate of all the region round. Raw silk was its chief product, and in his day the fortress was already in ruin, for the Buy ids had ravaged all this country during their wars against the Ziyarids; and Mukaddasi adds that 1 i. H. 272, 273. Muk. 357, 358. Kaz. ii. 235. Mst. 190. A. Y. i. 578. Hfz. 32^. During the 4th (10th) century Jurjan was governed by a native dynasty, the Ziyarids, whose rule extended over Tabaristan and the neighbour ing lands. Of these Ziyarids one of the most famous was Kabus, who died in 403 (1012) and whose tomb, called the Gunbad-i-Kabus, is still to be seen near the ruins of Jurjan city. C. E. Yate, Khurasan and Sistan, pp. 239—241.XXVlJ KUMIS, TABARISTAN, AND JURJAN. 379 there was the Friday Mosque built at the time of the first Moslem conquest still standing in the market-place near the city gate. Yaktit and Mustawfi merely confirm the above account, praising the climate of Astarabad and the abundant supplies, but adding no fresh details. The port on the Caspian of both Jurjan and Astarabad was at Abasktin, given as one day's march distant from either city, but the site w T ould appear to have been engulfed in the sea during the 7th (13th) century, following on the events of the Mongol invasion. Istakhn and Ibn Hawkal, writing in the 4th(ioth) century, describe Abasktin as a considerable market for the silk trade, being the border station at that time against the Turks and Ghuzz, and the chief port for the coasting trade of the Caspian, sailing towards Gilan. It was protected by a strong castle built of burnt brick, and the Friday Mosque was in its market place. Mukaddasi writes of it as 'the great harbour of Jurjan,' and the Caspian itself, Yaktit adds, was often called the Sea of Abasktin. In history Abasktin is celebrated as having been the final refuge of Muhammad, the last reigning Khwarizm-Shah, who, fleeing before the Mongol hordes, died here miserably in 617 (1220) 1 . Six days' journey (or 50 leagues) north of Abasktin, and four marches from Jurjan city, was the settlement of Dihistan in the district of the same name, the outpost in the 4th (10th) century of the Turk frontier. Ibn Hawkal speaks of Dihistan as lying near the Caspian shore. The only settlements were small villages, with some gardens, but only a sparse population. Adjacent was a shallow bay of the Caspian where boats anchored and much fishing was carried on by the coast people. The chief settlement was called Akhur, which Mukaddasi refers to as a city, surrounded by twenty-four villages, 4 and these are the most populous of all the Jurjan province.' In Akhur was a minaret, or tower, which could be seen from a great distance away in the neighbouring desert. To the eastward of Akhur was Ar-Rubat, 'the Guard-house, an important settlement at the entrance of the desert route going 1 1st. 213, 214. I. H. 273, 274. Muk. 358. Yak. i. 55, 242. Mst. 190, 225.

Mukaddasi speaks of it as having three gates, and though in his time it was for the most part in ruin, it was still populous, with good markets and a few well-built houses, and fine mosques. Of these last, the Old Mosque had been built on wooden pillars, Mukaddasi says, and it was in his day half under ground. Another of the mosques had a beautiful minaret. YaMt mentions these and some other places in the Dihistan district, namely the villages of Khartir, Farghtil, and Habrathan, but he adds no details. Mustawfi, who gives the route from Jurjan to Khwarizm across Dihistan, describes this as the frontier between the Moslems and the heathen Turks and Kurds. The district had a warm climate and a stream watered its fields, but there was little fruit grown here 1 . Four stages from Dihistan on the desert border, where the road started for crossing to Khwarizm, stood the city of Faravah, which is given by Istakhn as a settlement of the Ghuzz Desert. In the 4th (10th) century it was strongly garrisoned by volunteers, and there was a great Rubat, or guard-house, to protect the country lying at the back of it against the Turkish inroads. Its gardens and fields were small in extent and the town or settlement numbered barely a thousand families. Mukaddasi spells the name Afravah, and Yakut says that it was a Rubat built by ^bd Allah, the Tahirid, during the reign of the Caliph Mamtin. From its position there is little doubt that Faravah is identical with the modern Kizil Arvat, a corruption of Kizil Rubat, 4 the Red Guard house.' The names only of a number of other places in the Jurjan province are given by YaMt, these being the various villages belonging to Jurjan city, or to Astarabad. No details, however, are added, their positions are not indicated, and too often the reading of the name is uncertain 2 . Mukaddasi mentions, among the products for which Jurjan 1 The ruins of these towns lying on the border of the Khwarizm desert are still to be seen at Misriyan, near the mountains now called the Koren Dagh, but all cultivation has long ceased in this district, which is now a waterless desert.

An inferior kind of brocade (dibaj) was also largely manufactured, and of fruits Jurjan was especially famous for its grapes, figs, and olives 1 . The high roads through Tabaristan and Jurjan are not numerous, since in the first-named country the mountains are for roads almost impassable. Istakhrt (duplicated by Ibn Hawkal) and Mukaddasi give the road from Ray northwards across the great chain to Amul, passing through Ask and Bulur (Pulur), but many of the stages are now difficult or impossible to identify. Travelling westward from Amul along the coast, Ibn Hawkal and Istakhn give the marches through Natil and Salus to the frontier of Gilan (Daylam); also eastward from Amul to Astarabad and Jurjan city. From Jurjan city north to Dihistan the stations are given by Mukaddasi, as also by Mustawfi in his account of the road from Bistam in Kiimis to the capital of Khwarizm. Mukaddasi also gives the road from Bistam to Jurjan city across the mountain pass, through Juhaynah, which is described by Ibn Hawkal as a fine village on a river. Lastly from Jurjan eastward into Khurasan Mukaddasi gives a route in 5 days to Isfarayin in the Juvayn plain, passing through Ajgh, which is now called Ashk. This district will be described in the following chapter 2 . 1 Muk. 367. 2 1st. 214—217. i. h. 274—276. Muk. 372, 373. Mst. 197.CHAPTER XXVII. KHURASAN. The four Quarters of Khurasan.

In old Persian Khurasan means c the Eastern Land,' and in the earlier middle-ages the name was applied, generally, so as to include all the Moslem provinces east of the Great Desert, as far as the frontier of the Indian mountains. Khurasan, therefore, was taken in this larger sense to include all Transoxiana on the north east, besides Sijistan with Ktihistan on the south, and its outer boundaries were the Chinese desert and the Pamir towards Central Asia, with the Hindti Kush ranges towards India. Later, however, these limits became more circumscribed, and Khurasan as a province of medieval Persia may conveniently be held to have extended only as far as the Oxus on the north-east, but it still included all the highlands beyond Herat, in what is now the north-western part of Afghanistan. Further, the country of the upper Oxus, towards the Pamir, as known to the medieval Arabs, was always counted as one of the outlying districts of Khurasan. Arab or medieval Khurasan is conveniently divided into four Quarters (Rub'), named from the four great cities which at various times were, separately or conjointly, the capitals of the province, to wit Naysabilr, Marv, Her'at, and Balkh. After the first Moslem conquest the capitals of Khurasan had been at Marv and at Balkh. The princes of the Tahirid dynasty, how ever, shifted the centre of government westward, and under theirI chap. xxvii] khurAsAn. 383 e 1 ) s ^, JX- fvCo /'VvVkvCW' sway Naysabur became the capital city of the province, being also the chief town of the westernmost of the four Quarters 1 . In modern Persian the name is pronounced Nishapur, the Arab form being Naysabur, which is from the old Persian Niv- Shahpuhr, meaning 'the good (thing, deed, or place) of Shipiir,' and the city is so called after the Sassanian king Shapur II, who had rebuilt it in the 4th century a.d., for Naysabur owed its foundation to Shapur I, son of Ardashir Babgan. Of the chief towns of the Naysabur district, in which was included most of the province of Kuhistan already described, long lists are given by the Arab geographers of the 3rd (9th) century, but these are chiefly interesting for the archaic spelling of some of the names, and many places named cannot now be identified 2 . In early Moslem days Naysabur was also known as Abrashahr, /\/ 0 1 meaning 'Cloud-city' in Persian, and as such appears as a mint £'t city on the early dirhams of both the Omayyad and Abbasid Caliphs. The name Iran-shahr—the' City of Iran—is also given &lt; to it by Mukaddasi and others, but probably this was merely used officially and as a title of honour. In the 4th (10th) century Naysabur was already a most populous place, measuring from half a league to a league across every way, and consisting of the citadel or fortress, the city proper, and an outer suburb. The chief Friday Mosque stood in the suburb; it had been built by 'Amr the Saffarid, and faced the public square called Al-Mu'askar, 'the Review Ground.' Adjacent thereto was the palace of the governor, which opened on another square called the Maydan-al-Husayniyin, and not far from this was the prison—all three buildings standing within a quarter of a league one of the other. The fortress had two gates, the city four. These last were named Bab-al-Kantarah (the Bridge Gate), next the gate of the street of Ma'kil, then Bab-al-Kuhandiz (the Fortress Gate), and lastly the gate of the Takin bridge. The suburbs lying beyond 1 1st. 253, 254. I. H. 308, 309, 310. Muk. 295. Mst. 185. 2 1st. 258. I. H. 313. I. K. 24. Ykb. 278. I. R. 171. The first syllable of the name Nishapur in old Persian was Mv, or Mk, which in modern Persian exists in MM, 'good'; the Arab diphthong Nay(sabur) changes in modern Persian to the long vowel, becoming Nishapur, for the Arab 6 is in Persian pronounced p. Noldeke, Sassamd p. 59.384 khurasAn. [chap. and round both fortress and city, where the great markets were situated, had many gates. Of these the chief were the gate of the domes (Bab-al-Kubab), opening west, and on the opposite quarter the war gate (Bab Jang) towards the Bushtafrush district; then to the south was the Bab Ahwasabad, and the names of some others are also given. The most famous market-places were those known as Al-Murabba'ah-al-Kabirah, and Al-Murabba'ah-as-Sa- ghirah ('the great quadrangle' and 'the little quadrangle'), of which the great quadrangle was near the Friday Mosque, already men tioned. The little quadrangle was at some distance from the other, in the western part of the suburbs, near the Maydan-al-Husayniyin and the governor's palace. A long line of streets flanked by shops went from one quadrangle to the other; and a like street of shops crossed this at right-angles, near the great quadrangle, going south as far as the graveyard known as the Makabir-al-Husaymyin, and extending north to the head of the bridge over the river. In these market streets were many hostels for the merchants, and every sort of merchandise might be found each in its separate mart, while cobblers, clothiers, bootmakers, and men of every trade were abundantly represented. Every house in the city had its own separate underground water channel, the supply coming from the stream of the Wadi Saghavar, which flowed down through Naysabur from the neighbouring village of Bushtankan. These water chan nels, which were under the inspection of a special officer within the city, often ran as much as a hundred steps below the ground level. Beyond the city the channels reached the surface, and were here used for the irrigation of the garden lands. No town in all Khurasan, says Ibn Hawkal, was healthier or more populous than Naysabiir, being famous for its rich merchants, and the store of merchandise coming in daily by caravan. Cotton and raw silk were its chief exports, and all kinds of stuff goods were manufactured here. Mukaddasi fully bears out this account, adding some further details. He says that there were forty-two town quarters in Naysabur, some of which were of the size of half the city of Shiraz. The main streets leading to the gates were nearly fifty in number. The great Friday Mosque^ which was built in four wards, dated, as already said, from the ) days of Amr the Saffarid. Its roof was supported on columns ofxxvii] khurasAn. 385 burnt brick, and three arcades went round the great court. The main building was ornamented with golden tiles, there were eleven gates to the mosque, each flanked by marble columns, and both the roof and walls were profusely ornamented. The river of NaysaMr, as noted above, came from the village of Bushtankan; it turned seventy mills, and from it the numerous underground watercourses were led off, for the river itself flowed past the place at a distance of a league. Within the city and among the houses there were many wells of sweet water 1 . Yakxit says that in his day, namely the 7th (13th) century, the name of the city was commonly pronounced Nashaviir. He declares that in spite of the ruin which had been the result of the great earthquakes in the year 540 (1145), followed by the sack of the place at the hands of the Ghuzz hordes in 548 (1153), he had seen no finer city in all Khurasan, and its gardens were famous for their white currants {ribas) and for other fruits. After this Ghuzz inroad, when Sultan Sanjar the Saljiik was carried away prisoner, and the city devastated, the inhabitants for the most part removed to the neighbouring suburb of Shad- yakh, which was then rebuilt, being surrounded with a wall and enlarged by Al-Mu'ayyad, the governor, who acted in the name of the captive Sultan Sanjar. This suburb of Shadyakh, or Ash-Shadhyakh, had formerly been a garden, occupied by £ Abd Allah the Tahirid in the early part of the 3rd (9th) century, when he made NaysaMr the seat of his government. Round his palace, what had been originally the camp of his troops became the chief suburb of Naysabur, which, after the Ghuzz invasion, took the place of the capital. Yaktlt, who spent some time at Nishapiir about the year 613 (1216), lodged in Shadyakh, which he describes. Shortly after this, namely in 618 (1221), the capital was taken and sacked by the Mongols under Changiz Khan, as Yaktit himself heard and reports, he having by this time sought safety in Mosul. According to his information the Mongols left not one stone standing upon another. Nishapur, however, must have quickly recovered from the 1 1st. 254, 255. I. H. 310—312. Muk. 314—316, 329.

[CHAP. effects of the Mongol invasion, for when Ibn Batiitah was here in the 8th (14th) century it was again a populous city, with a fine mosque encircled by four colleges, while the plain round the city was 'a little Damascus ? for fertility, for it was watered by four streams coming from the neighbouring hills. They manufactured here, Ibn Batfttah adds, silk velvets called kamkha and nakhkh, and the markets were much frequented by foreign merchants. Mustawfi, his contemporary, gives a long account of the city of Nishapur and of its district. He says that in the days of the Chosroes, as it was reported, the old town of Naysabtir had been originally laid out on the plan of a chess-board, with eight squares to each side. Then under the Saffarids Nishaptir had increased in size and wealth, becoming the chief city of Khurasan, till the year 605 (1208), when it was almost completely destroyed by earthquakes. It was after this date, according to Mustawfi, that Shadyakh first took its place as the centre of population, this latter city having a wall 6700 paces in circuit. Nishaptir, how ever, was forthwith rebuilt, but again destroyed by the earthquakes in the year 679 (1280), when a third city of Nishapftr was re- founded on a different site, and this was the place which Mustawfi describes. Its walls then measured 15,000 paces in circuit, and it stood at the foot of the hills, facing south. The water-supply was plentiful, for the Nishapur river, which rose in the mountains two leagues or more to the eastward, had a sufficient current to turn 40 mills before it came to the town. He relates, further, that most of the houses in Nishaplar had cisterns for storing water in the dry season. The present city of Nishapiir lies on the eastern side of a semicircular plain, surrounded by mountains, and facing the desert, which is to the south. This plain is watered by many streams coming down from the hills to the north and east, and Mustawfi gives the names of a great number of these, which, after irrigating the lands round Nishapilr, become lost in the desert. Five leagues north of the city, at the head-waters of the Nishapilr river, was a little lake in the mountains at the top of the pass, called Chashmah Sabz, 4 the Green Spring,' from which, according to Mustawfi, two streams running west and east took their rise, the eastern stream flowingXXVII] KhurAsAn. 387 down to the valley of Mashhad. This lake appears to have been in the hill called Kiih Gulshan, where there was a wonderful Cavern of the Winds, and from its depths a draught of air and a current of water perpetually issued, the latter sufficiently strong to turn a mill. The lake of Chashmah Sabz is described as a league in circuit, and many wonders were related of it, for it was reported to be unfathomable, and an arrow could not be shot from one bank to the other. Four districts of the NaysaMr plain were famous for their fertility, and Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century enumerates these, namely, Ash-Shamat ('the Beauty Spots ? ), Rivand, which still exists to the west of Nishapur, Maztil, and Bushtafrtish. The district of MazW lay to the north, and its chief village was Bushtakan (or Bushtankan), a league from the city, where 'Amr the Saffarid had planted a famous garden. The currants of this district were especially renowned. The BushtaMsh district, now known as Pusht Parish, extended for a day's journey eastwards from the Jang Gate of Naysabrir, according to Mukaddasi, and from the gardens of its villages, which Yakut says numbered 126 in all, apricots were exported in immense quantities. The Shamat district, Mukaddasi says, was named Tak -Ab by the Persians, meaning 'whence waters flow/ and its fertility was extraordinary. Rivand, a small town in the district of the same name, lay one stage west of Naysablir; in the 4th (10th) century the town had a Friday Mosque built of burnt brick, and it stood on its own river. Its vineyards were famous and its quinces were in great demand. One of the main streams of the Nishaptir district, according to Mustawfi, was the'Shtirah RM, 'the Salt River/ which was joined by the waters of the stream from Dizbad, and after watering many districts ultimately became lost in the desert. A number of other streams are also mentioned by Mustawfi, but many of their names are misspelt and they are now difficult to identify. Some, however, present no difficulty, as for instance the river of Bushtakan, rising in the Chashmah Sabz neighbourhood, already mentioned, and the Bushtafriish river, both of which in the spring freshets, he says, joined the Shu rah Rud. Finally, there was the stream named the 'Atshabad, or ' Thirst' river, which, though in 25—2388 KHURASAN. [CHAP. spring-time it had water enough to turn 20 mills throughout its course of a score of leagues, at other seasons did not give enough to quench a man's thirst, from which cause came its ill-omened name 1 . To the south-east of Nishapiir the great Khurasan high road bifurcates at the stage which the Arabs named Kasr-ar-Rih, ' Castle of the Wind/ and the Persians Dizbad or Dih Bad. Its river has been already mentioned among the streams which flowed to the Shilrah river. From here the road to Marv went due east, that to Herat turning off south-east. On this last, two stages from Dih Bad, was the village of Farhadan, which is also called Farhadhjird by Yaktit. Its district, which was counted as of NaysaMr, Mukaddasi calls Asfand ; in Ibn Rustah the spelling given is Ashbandh, and Yakdt writes Ashfand, adding that this district comprised 83 villages. The old name of the district appears now to be lost, but the village called Farajird (for the older Farhadhjird) is still marked on the maps at the place in dicated by the Itineraries 2 . Due east of Nishapftr, but separated from it by the range of mountains in which most of the streams of the Nishaptir plain take their rise, lies Mashhad— f the Place of Martyrdom,' or 'Shrine' of the Imam—now the capital of the Persian province of Khurasan, and a few miles to the north of it may be seen the ruins of Tus, the older city. Ttis, in the 4th (10th) century, was the second city of the Naysabtir quarter of Khurasan, and con sisted of the twin towns of At-Tabaran and N^kan, while two post-stages distant was the great garden at the village of Sanabadh, where lay the graves of the Caliph Hartln-ar-Rashid, who died in I 93 (809)5 an d of the eighth Imam Aii-ar-Rida, who was poisoned by Mamtin in 202 (817). This village of Sanabadh was also known as Barda f , meaning 'a pack-saddle,' or as Al-Muthakkab, 4 the Pierced 3 ,' presumably from the windows of the shrine, or for some other fanciful reason. 1 I.

Mst. 196, 197. 3 Al-Muthakkab was a name given to various fortresses; one near Al-xxvii] khuras A n. 389 In the 3rd (9th) century, according to Ya'kubi, Nukan was the greater of the two halves of Tus, but in the following century Tabaran had outgrown it, and was the larger city down to the time of Yakilt, when Tiis was ruined by the Mongol hordes. In early days Ntikan was celebrated for its stone jars made of serpentine (Baram), which were largely exported; and there were mines for gold and silver, copper and iron, which were profitably worked in the neighbouring hills. Turquoises, and the stone known as ' santalum ? {khumdhari), also malachite (dahnaj), were all found in the neighbourhood of Ttis, and brought for sale to the markets of Ntikan. This part of Tiis, however, was rather deficient in its water-supply. The fortress of the adjacent quarter of Tabaran was a huge building, 'visible afar off/ as Mukaddasi writes, and the markets of this half of the town were well supplied. Its Friday Mosque was beautifully built and finely ornamented. The neighbouring tombs at Sanabadh were already in the 4th (10th) century surrounded by a strongly fortified wall, and the shrine, as Ibn Hawkal reports, was constantly thronged by devotees. A mosque had been built near the tomb of the Imam Rida by the Amir Faik 'Amid-ad-Dawlah, than which, says Mukaddasi, 4 there is none finer in all Khurasan.' The grave of Harfoi-ar- Rashid had been made by the side of that of the Imam, and many houses and a market had been built in the vicinity of the great garden. The description given by Yaktit adds little to the above, but he mentions, as one of the most famous tombs at Tabaran, the shrine of the great Sunni theologian, the Imam Ghazzali, who had died in 505 (1111), after having served some years at Baghdad as chief of the Nizamiyah college. When Yaktit wrote, in the 7th (13th) century, the name Tiis was more generally used to denote the surrounding district, where there were, he says, over a thousand flourishing villages. In 617 (1220), however, all this country, Massisah (Mopsuestia) has been mentioned in Chapter ix, p. 130. The origin of the name Barda' is not explained. Nukan, pronounced Nugan, is still the name of the north-east quarter and gate of modern Mashhad, leading out doubtless towards Nukan of Tus, and the Sanabad watercourse at the present day supplies the north-west quarter of Mashhad. i.

[chap. _ — including the two cities of Tus, with the shrines at Sanabadh (Mashhad), was devastated and pillaged by the Mongol hordes. From the Mongol sack Tus appears never to have recovered, though the neighbouring shrines under the fostering care of the rich Shi'ah s soon resumed their former splendour; and Mustawfi, in the 8th (14th) century, is one of the first to refer to the Sanabadh village as Mashhad, 'the Place of Martyrdom,' a name that it has since always borne. The Caliph and the Imam, as Kazvini remarks, lay under one dome, and the latter only was held in honour by the Shi'ahs, who, however, knew not which tomb to revere, for by order of the Caliph Mamun (son of Harfm-ar-Rashid, and the poisoner of 'Ali- ar-Rida), the two graves had been made exactly alike. When Mustawfi wrote, Mashhad had already become a great city, surrounded by immense graveyards with many famous tombs, that of Ghazzali, just mentioned, lying to the eastward of the shrines, where also was shown the grave of the poet Firdiisi. Around the city lay the fertile plain known as Marghzar Takan, 12 leagues long by 5 across, where grapes and figs were more especially grown. The people of the Tils district were, Mustawfi adds, 'a very excellent folk and good to strangers/ Ibn Batiitah, who visited the Mashhad of Imam Rida a few years later, gives a careful description of the shrine. Mashhad, was, he says, a large city, plentifully supplied as to its markets, and surrounded by hills. Over the tombs was a mighty dome, covering the oratory, and the mosque with a college (Madrasah) stood adjacent. All these were finely built, their walls being lined with tile-work {kdshdm). Above the actual grave of the Imam was a sort of platform, or casing in wood, overlaid with silver plates, many silver lamps being hung from the beams round about. The threshold of the door into the oratory was overlaid in silver, the aperture being closed by a gold-embroidered silk veil, and the floor under the dome was spread with many fine carpets. The tomb of the Caliph was also covered by a casing of wood, on which candlesticks were set, but it was not held in honour, for, says Ibn Batiitah, 'every Shi'ah on entering kicks with his foot the tomb of Harfin-ar-Rashid, while he invokes a blessing on that of Imam Rida. ? The magnificence of the shrineXXVII] KHURASAN. 391 of the Imam is alluded to by the Spanish envoy Clavijo, who visited the court of Timtir in 808 (1405), and on his way passed through Mashhad. In those days it is noteworthy that Christians might enter the shrine, for the Persian Shi'ahs were not then as fanatical in this matter as they are at the present time 1 . Four days' march due west of Nishapiir in the district of Bayhak were the two cities of Sabzivar and Khusrfrjird, a league only separating them; Sabzivar, the chief town, being itself generally known in the middle-ages as Bayhak. The Bayhak district, which extended as far east as Rivand, measuring 25 leagues across in all directions, comprised according to YaMt 321 villages, and he adds that the name Bayhak was from the Persian Bay hah or Bahayin, which signified 4 most generous/ According to the same authority Sabzavar was the more exact name of the town, which the common people had shortened to Sabzvar; and Khusriijird had originally been the chief town of the district, but the pre-eminence in his day was gone over to Sabzivar. Mustawfi says that the markets of this town were covered by a wooden roof on arches, very strongly built; grapes and other fruits were grown in the district round, and most of the population in the 8th (T4th) century were Shi'ahs 2 . From Bistam in the Ktimis province to Nishapvlr there were two roads. The more direct, the post-road ; lies along the edge of the desert, going through Sabzivar. The longer caravan road is to the north, and curves through the great upland plain of Juvayn, which is separated from the Great Desert by a range of hills. This district of Juvayn, which, according to Mukaddasi, was also called Gtiyan, was very fertile in food-stuffs, and its chief town was Aza- dhvar or Azadvar. The Isfarayin district was in its northern part; 1 The name of the Imam is at the present day pronounced Riza by the Persians. Ykb. 277. 1st. 257, 258. I.

[chap. while at the western end, on the Kiimis border, was the Arghiyan district round Jajarm. Nearly two hundred villages, according to Yakfit^ were dependencies of Azadhvar, which he describes as a populous town with fine mosques, and outside its gate was a great khan for merchants, for its markets were much frequented. The gardens of its villages stretched continuously all down the valley, and the water for their irrigation was brought by underground water courses from the springs in the southern hills. In the 8th (14th) century, according to Mustawfi, the capital of the Juvayn district had changed to Fariytimad, some miles to the south of Azadvar. Khudashah, a stage east of Azadvar on the caravan road, was also a place of importance, where, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, Hajji Barlas, the uncle of Timtlr, was slain, as is mentioned by 'Ali of Yazd in his history 1 . The town of Jajarm, also called Arghiyan, which is more par ticularly the name of its district, had, according to Mukaddasi, a fine Friday Mosque, and was a well-fortified city, with 70 villages of its dependencies. Yakftt describes the three towns of Samal- kan or Samankan, said to lie east of Jajarm, Ar-Rawanir (or Rawansar), and Ban, as being all of the Arghiyan or Jajarm district, but their exact positions are not given. He also mentions Sabanj or Isfanj, which still exists to the south-west of Jajarm on the road to Bistam, and this place Mustawfi calls Rubat Savanj. Mustawfi describes Jajarm as a fair-sized town, which no army could come against, for within the circuit of a day's journey round it the plain was everywhere covered by a grass poisonous to all cattle. On the other hand, at the foot of its castle, there grew two plane-trees (chindr), whose bark if chewed on a Wednesday morning infallibly cured toothache. Mustawfi adds that this bark was largely exported. The district round was very fertile, growing fruit and corn. The Jajarm river, which ran south and ended in the desert, he names the Jaghan RM : it rose by three springs, each of which could have turned a mill, and these after coming 1 Muk. 318. Yak. i. 230; ii. 165. Mst. 186, 196. A. Y. i. 58. There is some confusion between the names of Khudashah four leagues to the east of Azadvar, and Khurashah, which is about the same distance to the north of Azadvar. The two names are written much alike in the Arabic character.XXVII] KHURASAN. 393 together ran for a course over 12 leagues in length, the water being much used for irrigation 1 . The great plain of Isfarayin (or Asfarayn), Mukaddasi says, grew much rice and fine grapes. Its chief town, of the same name, was very populous, and had good markets. Yaktit states that the town of Isfarayin was of old called Mihrajan, this, when he wrote in the 7th (13th) century, being still the name of a village near the ruined town, and 51 villages were of its dependencies. The name Isfarayin, according to Yaktit, was originally written Asbarayin, and meant 'the shield-bearers,' from asbar, 'a shield.' Mustawfi relates that in the mosque at Isfarayin was a great bowl of brass, the largest ever seen, for its outer edge measured a dozen ells in circumference. To the north of the city was the Kal'ah-i- Zar, £ Gold Castle,' and the town took its water from a stream that flowed past at the foot of the castle hill. Throughout the sur rounding plain nut-trees abounded; the climate was damp, but grapes and corn were grown plentifully 2 . In the marshy plain, where the river Atrak takes its rise to flow westward, while flowing in a contrary direction eastward, the river of Mashhad also has its source, lies the town of Kiichan, which in medieval times was called Khabfishan, or Khfrjan. Its district the Arab geographers name Ustuva, praising it as a very fertile country; the name is said to mean ' the Highland'; and beyond Ustuva, eastwards, was the Nisa district. Yaktit, who states that the name of the chief town was in his day pronounced Khfishan, says that 93 villages belonged to it. In the Jahan Numd the name appears as Khtichan, and Mustawfi says that though the name of Ustuva for the district was still written in the fiscal registers, it was in his day no longer in common use. The surrounding plain he praises for its fertility, and adds that Hulagti Khan, the Mongol, had rebuilt Khabtishan in the 7th (13th) century, his grandson Arghtin, the Il-Khan of Persia, afterwards greatly enlarging the town. About half-way between Khabiishan 1 Muk. 318. Yak. i. 209, 249, 485; ii. 4, 742; iii. 35, 145. Mst. 186, 196, 220. 2 Muk. 318. Yak. i. 246. Mst. 186.

[CHAP. and Tfis is Radkan, which is mentioned by Ibn Hawkal, and described by Yaktit as a small town celebrated as the birth-place of Nizam-al-Mulk, the great Wazir of Malik Shah, the Saljtak 1 . The famous district of Nasa or Nisa is the broad valley now known as Darrah Gaz, 'the Vale of Manna.' The city of Nisa is described by Ibn Hawkal as being a large town, of the size of Sarakhs, having an abundant water-supply from the neighbouring hills. Mukaddasi praises its fine mosque and excellent markets. Nearly all the houses, he says, had gardens, and rich villages, were dotted about the valley all round the town. Yakilt, how ever, speaks of Nisa as most unhealthy, chiefly on account of the guinea-worm (the ' Medina worm,' he calls it), which in summer could hardly be avoided by those living in the place, and the suffering it caused made life unbearable. Kazvini adds that the town was also called Shahr Firtlz, after the ancient Persian king who was reported to have built it 2 . To the east of Nisa, beyond the mountain ridge and on the edge of the Marv desert, lies Abivard, the name being sometimes spelt Bavard. Mukaddasi says that its markets, in the midst of which stood the Friday Mosque, were finer even than those of Nisa, and more frequented by merchants. Mustawfi praises the fruit grown here, and he counts as belonging to Abivard the great guard-house {rubdt) at Kufan, six leagues distant, standing in a village. This guard-house had been built by 'Abd-Allah, the Tahirid, in the 3rd (9th) century; it had four gates, and a mosque was built in its midst. The district in which Abivard stood was called Khabaran, or Khavaran, of which Mihnah, or Mayhanah, was the chief town; further, Yakut names Azjah, Badhan, Kharv- al-Jabal and Shiikan as among the important places of this district; but Mayhanah, when he wrote, was already in ruins. 1 I.

The present town of Bujnurd, lying north of Isfarayin, and about 60 miles to the north-west of Kuchan, was founded a couple of centuries ago t but near it was an older town called Bizhan, the ruined castle of which, known as the Ka^ah, still exists.

The city of Nisa is probably identical with the modern Muhammadabad, the chief town of Darrah Gaz.xxvii] # khurasAn. 395 In the following, 8th (14th), century Mustawfi speaks of the many fine gardens of the Khavaran district—he also gives the name as Khavardan—and he says that in its chief town had resided the poet Anvan, who flourished in the 6th (12th) century, having been the panegyrist of Sultan Sanjar the Saljftk 3 . In the mountains, and about half-way between Abivard and Mihnah, lies the huge natural fortress now known as Kilat-i-Nadir, after Nadir Shah, the celebrated king of the Persia of the 1 8th century a.d., who stored his treasures here. This stronghold does not appear to be mentioned in any of the Itineraries, or by the Arab geographers of the 3rd and 4th (9th and 10th) centuries, and Yakfit does not notice it. The earliest mention of Kilat appears to be by 'Utbi, in his History of Mahmud of Ghaznah, and he merely states incidentally that a certain Amir went ^ from Nishaptir to Kilat, which is also in the Arabic fashion written Kal'ah.' Mustawfi gives a succinct description of the place, adding that its chief towns w T ere called Jurm and Marinan; further, Kilat had much water, besides arable lands that produced abundantly, and many villages belonged to it of the surrounding districts. In history it first became famous for the siege of the fortress by Timftr, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, and after it had fallen into his hands he caused its fortifications to be carefully rebuilt and strengthened 2 . The city of Sarakhs lies on the direct road from Tus to Great Marv, and on the right, or eastern bank of the Mashhad river, which is now known as the Tajand. This river does not appear 1 Muk. 321, 333. Yak. i. in, 232, 462; ii. 383, 395, 428; iii. 337; iv. 321, 723. Mst. 189. A. Y. i. 382. J. N. 318. The name of Khavaran stands for the older form Kharvaran, meaning 'the west country' (the opposite of Khurasan, 4 the east country'), and this small district of the foot-hills on the Marv desert thus preserves at the present day the name applied originally to all western Persia that was formerly not counted as Khurasan, 'the country of the east.' 2 'Utbi, Kitdb-i- Yajntni, Arabic text (Cairo, 1286 a.m.), i. 215.

Kilat or Kalat, in Persian, is equivalent to the Armenian Qalaq, signifying 4 a city,' and in Arabic appears under the well-known form Kal'ah, or Kal'at, 'a castle.' Kilat-i-Nadir was visited by Col. MacGregor [Journey through Khurasan, ii. 51) in 1875 and carefully described.396 KHURASAN. [CHAP. XXVII to be named by any of the medieval geographers; it rises, as already described, in the marshes near Ktichan, and at first flows south-east, passing Mashhad. When it has gone about a hundred miles beyond this city it receives from the south, as a great affluent, the Herat river, and thence turning north flows to Sarakhs. At some distance further north, in the latitude of Abivard, its waters spread out and became lost in the desert sands, at a place called Al-Ajmah, i the Reed-beds,' where there were many tamarisk trees. Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal speak of this river Tajand merely as an affluent of the Herat river. Ibn Rustah, who regards it in the same light, says that two leagues before coming to Sarakhs the Herat river (that is, the low T er course of the Tajand) throws off a branch canal that goes direct to this city. Other canals too were taken from it to water the Sarakhs district, more especially one named the Khushk Rud (Dry River), across which had been built a great masonry bridge, but for a great part of the year even the main stream at Sarakhs carried no water. Sarakhs in the 4th (10th) century was a great city, being half the size of Marv, with a healthy climate. Camels and sheep were numerous in its pastures, though its arable lands were limited for lack of a constant water-supply. Mukaddasi praises its Friday Mosque and fine markets, adding that throughout the suburbs there were many gardens. Kazvim, who speaks of it as very populous, says that they made here, for export, scarfs for turbans, and veils that were most beautifully embroidered in gold thread. In the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi describes the walls of Sarakhs as 5000 paces in circuit and protected by a strongly built fortress. Their drinking water, he says, was from the river 4 coming from Tiis and Herat' (he does not name the Tajand), a fine stream, and of very digestible water, which further served to irrigate the fields round Sarakhs, where melons and grapes grew abundantly 1 . 1 !• K- 173- 1st. 272.

Amul and Zamtn, on the Oxus. Marv-ar-Rud, or Little Marv, and Kasr Ahnaf. The second of the Quarters of Khurasan, that of Marv, lies along the Murghab, or Marv river. This river flows down from the mountains of Ghur to the north-east of Herat, and passing Little Marv turns thence north to Great Marv, where its waters were divided up among a number of canals, after which it became lost in the sands of the Ghuzz Desert, on about the same latitude as the swamps of the Tajand or Herat river, but some 70 miles to the eastward of the latter. Besides the various towns lying along the Murghab, the Marv quarter also included the places on the great Khurasan road, beyond Marv, north-eastward to the Oxus at Amul, where the crossing for Bukhara took place. The name Murghab, or Marghab, is said by Ibn Hawkal to have been originally Marv-ab, 'the Marv-water'; but, says Istakhri, Murghab is the name of the place where its streams rise. Mukaddasi, who calls the Murghab the river of the Two Marvs, describes it as flowing past Upper (or Lesser) Marv towards Lower (or Great) Marv. One march south of the latter city its bed was artificially dyked with embankments faced by woodworks which kept the river-bed from changing. This embankment in the 4th (icth) century was under the wardship of a specially appointed Amir who acted as water-bailiff, with 10,000 workmen398 KHURASAN. [CHAP. under him and horse guards, and saw to the up-keep of the dykes, and the regulation of the water-supply. There was on the em bankment a measure which registered the flood-height; in a year of abundance this would rise to 60 barleycorns above the low- level, and the people then rejoiced, while in a year of drought the water would only attain the level of six barleycorns. At a distance of one league south of Great Marv the waters of the stream were dammed back in a great round pool, whence four canals radiated to the various quarters of the city and suburbs. The height of the pool was regulated by sluices, and it was a great festival when at high flood-time the various dams were cut, and the waters were divided off according to rule. These four main canals were called respectively the Hurmuzfarrah canal, flowing towards the west, next to the eastward that of Majan, then the Nahr Zark or Ar-Razik, and finally the Nahr As'adi. Of these four the Nahr-al-Majan appears to have carried the main stream of the Murghab, and after passing through the suburbs of the city, where it was crossed by many bridges of boats, it came out again to the desert plain, and flowed on till the residue of its waters were lost in the swamp. Yaktit in the 7th (13th) century states that the Murghab was in his day known as the river Razik (probably identical' with the canal already mentioned), a name which he states was often incorrectly spelt Zank, and the Jahan Numa adds, as a third variant, Zarbak. These names are also mentioned by Mustawfi, who gives Murghab as the common appellation in his day, and by this name the great river is still known l . Great Marv, in the middle-ages, was called Marv-ash-Shahijan, to distinguish it from Marv-ar-RM, Little Marv, and Shahijan is probably merely the Arab form of the old Persian Shahgm, c kingly,' or 'belonging to the king,' though YaMt and others explain the term as Shah-i-Jan to mean ' of the soul of the king.' Marv, as described by Istakhn, Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi, consisted of an inner citadel (Kuhandiz) £ high-built and itself of 1 1st. 260, 261. I. H. 315. Muk. 330, 331. Yak. ii. 777. Mst. 214. J.

Presumably 60 barleycorns (Sha'irah) went to the ell.XXVIII] KHURASAN, 399 the size of a town,' surrounded by the inner city with its four gates, beyond which again were extensive suburbs stretching along the banks of the great canals. The four gates of the inner town were the Bab-al-Madinah, ' the city gate' (S.W.), where the road from Sarakhs came in; the Bab Sanjan (S.E.) opening on'the Bani Mahan suburb and As'adi canal; the Bab Dar Mashkan (N.E.) on the road to the Oxus; and lastly the Bab Balin (N.W.). In the 4th (icth) century there were three Friday Mosques in Marv, first the citadel mosque called the Jami' of the Bani Mahan; next the Masjid-al-'Atik, 'the Old Mosque,'which stood at the gate opening on the Sarakhs road, the Bab-al-Madmah; lastly the New Mosque of the Majan suburb, outside this same gate, where the great markets of Marv were found. The Razik canal flowed into the town, coming to the gate called Bab-al-Madinah and the Old Mosque, after which its waters were received and stored in various tanks for the use of the inhabitants of the quarter. The Majan canal, flowing to the west of it, watered the great Majan suburb, which lay round the Maydan, or public square, on which stood the New Mosque, the Government-house, and the prison; all these having been built by Abu Muslim, the great partizan of the Abbasids. To him was principally due their accession to the Caliphate, as history relates, and in a domed house of this quarter, built of burnt brick, the dome being 55 ells in diameter, says Istakhri, the place was shown where the first black Abbasid robes had been dyed, that having become the distinguishing colour of the new dynasty. West of the Nahr Majan, as already said, was the canal of Hurmuzfarrah, on the limit of the suburbs of Marv, and along its banks were the houses and quarters built by Husayn the Tahirid, who had transferred many of the markets to this quarter. Yakut, at a later date, speaking of the great western suburb of Majan, mentions two of its chief streets, namely, the thoroughfare known as Bararjan (for Baradar-Jan) or 'brother-life' in upper Majan, and the street of Tukharan-bih. The Hurmuzfarrah canal ulti mately reached the township of that name, near the swamps of the Murghab, and the town had its own Friday Mosque. One league distant from Hurmuzfarrah was Bashan, also a town with its Friday Mosque, while the two hamlets of Kharak (or Kharah)400 KHURASAN. [CHAP. and As-Stisankan, standing a league distant one from the other, lay also on this side of Marv and were likewise of sufficient size for each to have its own Friday Mosque. One march to the westward of Marv was the town called Sinj (in Mukaddasi spelt Sink), with a fine Friday Mosque, standing on a canal with many gardens, and beyond it, two marches to the south-west of Marv on the road to Sarakhs, lay the important town of Ad-Dandankan. This was small but well fortified, having a single gate, with hot baths (Hammams) outside the wall. Its ruins were seen by Yaktit in the yth (13th) century, for it had been pillaged by the Ghuzz in 553 (1158). This w T as the limit of cultivation of the Marv oasis to the south-west, while Kushmayhan, one march from Marv on the Bukhara road, was the limit of cultivation on the north-eastern side. This Kushmayhan, or Kush- mahan, according to Ya^tibi, was famous for the Zabib Kushma- harii) a kind of raisin. The town also possessed a fine Friday Mosque and good markets; it was watered by a great canal, and there were many hostelries and baths here; much fruit being grown in the surrounding gardens. Immediately outside the Dar Mashkan gate of Marv, which led to the town of Kushmayhan, had stood the great palace of Mamun, where he had lived when he held his court at Marv, previous to setting out for Baghdad to wrest the Caliphate from his brother Amm. The south-eastern gate of Marv, the Bab Sanjan, opened on the As'adi canal, along which lay the Bani Mahan (or Mir Mahan) quarter, with the palace of the Marzuban of Marv, the Persian Warden of the Marches. From this gate the road led up the Murghab river by Al-Karmayn to Marv-ar-RM. Six leagues from the city in this direction was the town of Jiranj (or Kirang, in Mukaddasi) on the river bank, while one league beyond it lay Zark. Here had stood the mill where Yazdajird III, the last of the Sassanian kings, fled for shelter, and was murdered by the miller for the sake of his jewels. According to Ibn Hawkal, it was at Zark township that the waters of the Murghab were first canalised, channels being led off to irrigate the gardens round Marv. These gardens had at all times been famous for their melons, also for the assafoetida root {ushturghaz) grown here, which was exported to other parts of Khurasan^XXVIII] KHURASAN. 401 Silkworms, too, were raised here largely, the silk being manu factured into the stuffs for which Marv was celebrated 1 . In the latter half of the 4th (10th) century, when Mukaddasi knew Marv, a third part of the suburb was already in ruin, and the citadel was in no better state. In the next century, however, the city gained in size and importance under the SaljAks, and here Sultan Sanjar, the last of the great Saljuks, was buried in 55 2 ( it 57) 5 and the remains of his tomb may still be seen at the present day. Yaktit, who was in Marv in 616 (1219), describes the grave of Sultan Sanjar as lying under a great dome covered with blue tiles, so high as to be visible a day's march away over the plain; and the windows under the dome looked into the adjacent Friday Mosque. It had been built in memory of him, Yakiit was told, long after the Sultan's death by some of his servants. At the village of Andarabah, two leagues from Marv, which had been the private property of Sultan Sanjar, the remains of his palace were still standing in the 7th (13th) century, the walls being intact, though all the rest had gone to ruin, as was the case also, YaMt adds, with the adjacent village. Yakiit describes Marv as in his day possessing two chief Friday Mosques, enclosed by a single wall, one for the Hanafites, the other belonging to the Shafrttes. He himself lived in Marv for three years, collecting the materials for his great geographical dictionary, for before the Mongol invasion the libraries of Marv were celebrated; 4 verily but for the Mongols I would have stayed 1 Ykb. 280. 1st. 258—263. I. H. 314 —316. Muk. 298, 299, 310—312, 331. Yak. i. 534, 827; ii. 6io; iv. 507. The town and mill of Zark lay seven leagues from Marv, while the pool where the waters of the Murghab were divided among the four city canals, of which the Nahr Razik was one, lay at a distance of but one league from Marv. The Razik canal and the Zark mill, therefore, were probably not adjacent, but from the shifting of the diacritical point there is much confusion between Zark or Razk, and Zarik or Razik. The name of the mill is sometimes given as pronounced, Zurk or Zurrak, and the Zarik canal appears as Zarbak, on whose banks, according to some accounts. King Yazdajird came to his death. See Yak. ii. 777, 925; iv. 50S. Mukaddasi (p. 33) records that some two leagues from Marv, but in w^hich direction is not stated, was a small guard-house in which stood a tomb, popularly said to contain the head of Husayn, grandson of the Prophet, but this is a relic that was also shown in divers other localities, and certainly at the time of Husayn's death his head was not sent to Marv. L e S. 26and lived and died there,' he writes, 'and hardly could I tear myself away.' Thus among others he mentions the two libraries of the Friday Mosque, namely the 'Aziziyah with 12,000 and odd volumes, and the Kamaltyah. There was also the library of Sharaf- al-Mulk, in his Madrasah or college, and that of the great Saljuk Wazir. the Nizam-al-Mulk. Among the older libraries were those founded by the Samanids, and one in the college of the 'Umay- diyah; also that in the Khatuniyah college, and that which had belonged to Majd-al-Mulk. Finally, and especially, there was the Dumayriyah library in one of the Khankahs, or Darvish convents, containing only 200 volumes, but each volume, Yakiit writes, worth two hundred gold pieces (dinars), for all the books there were unique and beyond price. At the approach of the MongoLJiordes in 617 ^220) Yakjl t—» sought safety at Mosul in Mesopotamia, and all the glories of the Marv libraries jell ajre y to the flames, which followed in the wake of the Mongol sack of this great city, when nine million corpses are said to have remained unburied among the ruins. The tomb of Sultan Sanjar, Ibn-al-Athir states, was set on fire by the invaders, together with most of the mosques and other public buildings; and Hafiz Abru adds that they broke down all the great dams and dykes of the Murghab, which under the early Saljuks had been increased in number, and carefully seen to, in order thus t0 regulate the irrigation of the oasis, which now lapsed into a desert swamp. In the 8th (14th) century, when Ibn Batutah passed through Marv, it was still one great ruin. The account which his contemporary, Mustawfi, gives of Marv deals with its past glories in the 2nd (8th) century, when it was under the government of Abu Muslim, who brought the Abbasids to power, and when the Caliph Mam Cm resided at this place previous to marching on Baghdad. Then the Saffarids had re moved the capital of Khurasan to Nishapur, but the Saljtiks restored the primacy to Marv, and Sultan Malik Shah built the great wall round the city 12,300 paces in circuit. The crops of the Marv oasis were a marvel of productiveness; Mustawfi reports that seed corn gave a hundred-fold the first year, and from the ungathered overfall some thirty-fold for the second year was obtained, with as much as ten-fold of the original sowing even inXXVIII] khurasAk 403 the third year. The climate, however, being damp was unhealthy, and the rishtah, or guinea-worm, was a terrible scourge. The moving sands of the ^neighbouring deserts had in his day over whelmed many of the fruitful districts, but excellent water-melons were still grown, which were dried and largely exported, also grapes and pears. Mustawfi describes the city of Marv as still almost en tirely a ruin, though at the close of the 8th (14th) century it must have regained some of its former splendour, for Timur frequently stopped here in the intervals of his campaigns. He generally lived at a place which 'Alt of Yazd writes Makhan, probably a clerical error for Majan, which as already said had been in earlier days the name of the great western suburb of Marv, though Yakut mentions a place also called Makhan as a village near the city. Marv was in part restored to its former state of greatness under the reign of Shah Rukh, the grandson of Timxir, who rebuilt much of the. city in the year 812 (1409), so that in 821 (1418), when Hafiz Abrii wrote, he describes it as once more being in a flourishing condition 1 . On the left bank of the Oxus about 120 miles to the north-east of Marv, where the great Khurasan road crossed to Bukhara and Transoxiana, stood the city of Amu], and about a hundred miles to the eastward, higher up on the same bank was Zamm, also at a crossing-place. Amul, which in the later middle-ages w T as also known as Amtiyah, and then came to be called Chahar Jtiy ('Four Canals/ a name the place still bears), is described by Ibn Hawkal as a fertile and pleasant little town, of great import ance by reason of the constant passage of caravans going to and coming from the countries beyond the Oxus. All along the road south-west to Marv there were wells at each stage, but otherwise the territory of Amul was enclosed on all sides by the desert, which here came close up to the river bank. Mukaddasi praises the excellent markets of Amul. The town, with its Friday Mosque crowning a small hill, lay a league distant from the Oxus among well-irrigated fields, where there were vineyards. Opposite Amul, 1 Ibn-al-Athir, xii. 256. Yak. i. 373; iv. 378, 509, 510. I. B. iii. 63. Mst. 189. A. Y. i. 147, 150, 569. Hfz. 32^. 26—2404 KHURASAN. [CHAP. on the right bank of the river, in the Bukhara district, was the town of Firabr. To distinguish this Amul from the town of the same name which was the capital of Tabaristan (see above, p. 370), YaMt states that it was known in books as Amul of Zamm (after the next Oxus passage upstream), or Amul of the JayMn (Oxus), or Amul-ash-Shatt (of the Stream), or further as Amul-al-Mafazah (of the Desert). In his day, however, in place of the name Amul the town had come to be called Amii, or Amtiyah, by which denomination it is frequently mentioned in the accounts of the Mongol invasion, and of the campaigns of Timtir. It is also known as Kal'ah Amiiyah, or 'the Amuyah Castle/ In the nth (17th) century Abu-l-Ghazi gives the name as Amtiyah when dealing with the marches of Changiz Khan, but speaking of the events of his own day writes of Chahar Jtiy, in reference to this Oxus passage, which proves conclusively that the two places are identical. The town of Zamm, also on the Khurasan bank, as already stated, is the modern Karkhi, and in the middle-ages the town of Akhsisak faced it on the further side, towards Bukhara. Ibn Hawkal speaks of Zamm as a town of the same size as Amul, but it was only approached on the Khurasan side by the road up the Oxus bank in four marches from Amul; for from Zamm direct across to Marv the waterless desert intervened. From Zamm, eastward, Balkh could be reached, and after crossing the Oxus, Tirmidh. Zamm is also briefly mentioned by Mukaddasi, who speaks of its Friday Mosque standing in the market-place, so that in the 4th (10th) century it must already have been a place of some importance 1 . Coming back now to the Murghab river, about 160 miles higher up than Great Marv stood Upper, or Little Marv, at that part of the river where, after leaving the Ghiir mountains, it turns north through the desert plains towards Great Marv. Little Marv, or Upper Marv as Mukaddasi and others call it, is the place known as Bala Murghab, 'Upper Murghab/ to the Persians. It is now a complete ruin, and has been so since the invasion of Timiir. In the 4th (10th) century, however, Marv-ar-RMh, or 1 1st. 281, 314. I. H. 329, 363. Muk. 291, 292. Yak. i. 69; ii. 946. A.

G. 124, 329.XXVIII] KHURASAN. 405 'Marv of the River/ as it was then called, was the largest city of this, a most populous district, which had besides four other towns with Friday Mosques. It lay at a bow-shot from the bank of the Murghab, in the midst of gardens and vineyards, being three leagues distant from the mountains on the west, and two leagues from those on the east. In the market-place was the Friday Mosque, a building according to Mukaddasi standing on wooden columns, and Kudamah adds that one league from Upper Marv (as he calls it) was the castle of Kasr- £ Amr in the hills, blocking the mouth of a small valley. YaMt states that in his day the name Marv-ar-Rtid was pronounced MarrM by the common folk. It appears to have escaped the utter ruin which was the fate of Great Marv at the hands of the Mongols. At any rate in the 8th (14th) century Mustawfi describes it as still a flourishing place, with a wall 5000 paces in circumference, which had been built by Sultan Malik Shah the Saljiik. The surrounding country was most fertile, grapes and melons were grown abundantly, and living was cheap 1 . One day's march from Marv-ar-RM, on the same bank and down the river towards Great Marv, was the castle called Kasr Ahnaf, after Al-Ahnaf ibn Kays, the Arab general who in the days of the Caliph c Othman, in the year 31 (652), had conquered these lands for Islam. It was a large place, Ibn Hawkal says, with many vineyards round it, and fine gardens, the soil and climate being alike excellent, and Mukaddasi mentions its Friday Mosque situate in the market-place. At the present day the site of Kasr Ahnaf is marked by the village of Mariichak, or Marv-i-Ktichik (Little Marv) as the Persians call the place. In the middle-ages, four leagues above Marv-ar-RM, stood Dizah, a town occupying both banks of the Murghab, the two parts being connected by a stone bridge. This place too had a fine Friday Mosque, and Yaktit adds that it had originally been called Sinvan. The hamlets of Panj-dih (Five Villages) lie below Martichak on the Murghab, and the place was visited by Nasir-i-Khusraw in 437 (1045) on his way to Mecca; Yaktit too was there in 616 (1219) and alludes to it as a fine town. The place is also 1 Kud. 210. 1st. 269. I. H. 320. Muk. 314. Yak. iv. 506. Mst. 190. For the ruins at Bala Murghab, see C. E. Yate, Northern Afghanistan, p. 208.406 KHURASAN. [CHAP. XXVIII mentioned in the time of Timur at the close of the 8th (14th) century, when 'Ali of Yazd says it was known as Pandi (but the reading appears uncertain, and some manuscripts give Yandi). During the earlier middle-ages all the country from Little Marv to Great Marv, along the Murghab, was under cultivation, and studded with villages and towns. Al-Karinayn, already alluded to, was four marches above Great Marv, being two below Marv-ar- Rtid; and half-way between Karinayn and the latter was Lawkar, or Lawkara, which Mukaddasi mentions as a populous place, as big as Kasr Ahnaf. Above Marv-ar-RM, and all up the Murghab into the mountains of Gharjistan, there are many flourishing dis tricts, as will be noticed in the next chapter, when speaking of Ghur in the Herat quarter 1 . 1 Ykb. 291. 1st. 270.

This river takes its rise in the mountains of Ghiir, and at first flows for some distance westward. In order to irrigate the Herat valley many canals were here led from it, some above and some below Herat city, seven in particular being named by Mukaddasi as serving to water the fruitful districts round the capital. The Herat river, flowing from east to west in its earlier course, passes Herat city several miles from its southern gate, near the town of Malin. Here there was a bridge over it, unequalled in all Khurasan for beauty, says Mukaddasi, it having been built by a certain Magian, and bearing his name on an inscription— c and some say that he afterwards became a Moslem, others that he threw himself into the river, because the Sultan would put his own name upon that bridge.' Mustawfi gives the names of nine of the chief irrigation canals that were taken from the Hari RM in the neighbourhood of Herat. Beyond Herat the Hari RM passed the town of Ftishanj near its south bank, and turning north flowed on to Sarakhs, before reaching which it took up the waters of the Mashhad river, as has been mentioned in the previous chapter. Beyond, to the north of Sarakhs, its408 khurAsan. [chap. waters were lost in the desert. According to Hafiz Abrii the Herat river also bore the name of Khajacharan (the spelling, from the shifting position of the diacritical points, and the true pronun ciation are alike uncertain), and he asserts that its source was at a spring not far from the place where the Helmund river took its rise 1 . In the 4th (icth) century, as described by Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi, Herat (written more exactly Harat) was a great city, with a citadel, surrounded by a wall with four gates. These were, the Bab Saray or 'Palace Gate' to the north on the Balkh road; then to the west, towards Naysabur, the Bab Ziyad; the Firuzabad gate, which Mukaddasi calls the Bab Firuz, was to the south on the road towards Sijistan ;while to the east was the Bab Khushk towards the Ghur mountains. These four gates were all of wood, except the Bab Saray, which was of iron, says Ibn Hawkal; and the citadel of Herat (called the Kuhandiz or Kal'ah) had also four gates of the like names, respectively, to the city gates. The city measured half a league square, and the government house was at a place called Khurasanabad, a mile outside the town on the western road towards Fushanj. At each of the four city gates, within the town, was a market; and outside each gate was an extensive suburb. The great Friday Mosque of Herat stood in the midst of the chief market, and no mosque in all Khurasan or Sijistan was its equal in beauty. Behind it, on the west side, was the prison. To the north of Herat the mountains lay two leagues distant from the city, and here the land was desert, not being irrigated. These mountains produced mill-stones and paving-stones, and on the summit of one of the hills was an ancient fire-temple, called Sirishk, which was in the 4th (10th) century much frequented by the Magians. A Christian church also stood at a place lying half way between this fire-temple and the city. To the south of Herat, down to the Malin bridge over the Hari Rud, the land was like a garden, well cultivated and profusely irrigated by numerous canals, and divided into many districts. Populous villages lay one after the other, for a day's march and more, along the Sijistan road. 1 1st. 266. I. H. 318. Muk. 329, 330. Mst. 216. Hfz.XXIX] KHURASAN. 409 The prosperity of Herat continued unabated till the inroad of the Mongols; and in 614 (1217) when YaMt was here, some four years before that disastrous event, he considered Herat to be the richest and largest city that he had ever seen, standing in the midst of a most fertile country. His contemporary Kazvini, who confirms this account, notes that here might be seen many mills 'turned by wind, not by water,' which was to him an uncommon sight. Herat, however, must have recovered quickly from the effects of the Tartar inroad, and Mustawfi in the following century bears out the statement of Ibn Battitah that, after Nishaptk, it was the most populous city of all Khurasan. Its walls were then 9000 paces in circuit, and 18 villages lay immediately round the town, watered principally by a canal (Nahrichah) taken from the Hari Rud. The grapes of the kind called Fakhn, and the figs were both superlatively excellent. Already in the 8th (14th) century the people of Herat were Sunm. It was in the 6th (12th) century, during the supremacy of the Ghiirid dynasty according to Mustawfi, that Herat had reached its greatest splendour. There were then 12,000 shops in its markets, 6000 hot baths, and 659 colleges, the population being reckoned at 444,000. A strong fortress lay to the north of Herat, when Mustawfi wrote, called the castle of Shamiran, this having been built on the site of the older fire-temple of Sirishk, mentioned by Ibn Hawkal, which was two leagues distant from the c^ty on a hill-top. This fortress also went by the name of the Kal'ah Amkalchah. At the close of the 8th (14th) century, Timiar, after taking possession of Herat, destroyed its walls, and sent most of its artificers to augment the population of his new town of Shahr-i-Sabz in Transoxiana. In the Turkish Jahdn Numa it is stated that at that period, in the year 1010 (1600), Herat had five gates; that called Darvazah-i-Mulk, 'the Government Gate, 7 to the north, the Trak gate to the west, that of Firuzabad to the south, the Khush gate to the east, and the Kipchak gate to the north-east—this last being of late origin. The ten Bultiks, or districts, round Herat are also enumerated, but no statement as to the relative positions of these is afforded 1 . 1 1st. 264—266. I. H. 316—318. Muk. 306, 307. Yak. iv. 958.

Two leagues, or half a day's journey, to the south of Herat, and presumably beyond the great bridge that spanned the Hari Rud, to which bridge it gave its name, was the town of Malin, or Malan, with the district of the same name lying a day's journey in extent all round it. This Malan was called As-Safalkat, and Malan of Herat, to distinguish it from the place of the same name in the Bakharz district of Kiihistan (mentioned in Chapter XXV, p. 357). It was a small town, surrounded by most fruitful gardens, and the produce of its vineyards was celebrated. Yakut who had been there, writes the name Malm, but adds that the people in his day pronounced it Malan. Twenty-five villages belonged to its district, and of these he specially mentions four, Murghab, Bashinan, Zandan, and £ Absakan. One march to the north-east of Herat lies Kartikh, or Kartlkh, which Ibn Hawkal says was in the 4th (10th) century the largest town of the Herat district after the capital. Apricots and raisins were exported in great quantities from hence to all the neighbour ing districts and cities; the Friday Mosque stood in the quarter of the town called Sabidan, and the houses were built of sun- dried bricks. Kariikh stood in a mountain valley, 20 leagues in length, the whole of which was under cultivation, many villages and broad arable lands lying on its various streams. Its chief river flowed to the Hari RM, and appears to be that which Yakut names the Nahr Karagh. Eastward from Herat, and lying in the broad valley of the Hari RM, a succession of towns are mentioned by the geographers of the 4th (10th) century; namely, Bashan, one day's journey from Herat, then Khaysar, Astarabyan, Marabadh, and Awfah, each situated a day's journey beyond the last, and to the east of it; finally two days' journey beyond Awfah was Khasht, a place that was counted as in the Ghilr district. Of these towns, Awfah was almost as large as Kariikh, and only second to it in importance. mation given by Hajji Khalfah, in the Jahan Numd, is in part taken from the monograph on Herat written by Mu 4 in-ad-Din of Asfuzar in 897 (1492). This monograph has been inserted by Mirkhwand in the Epilogue {Khdtimah) of the Rawdat-as-Safd, pt vii. 45—51, and it was translated by M. Barbier de Meynard in the Journal Asiatique, i860, ii. p. 461; 1861, i. pp. 438, 473 ; 1862, ii. p. 269. For the present condition of Herat see C. E. Yate, Afghanistan, pp. 25—28.xxix] khurasAn. 411 The other four towns are described in similar terms as being well watered and populous ; all were smaller in size than Malin, each had gardens and fertile fields, and while Astarabyan grew no grapes, being near the hill country, Marabadh was especially noted for its rice, which was largely exported \ One day's march to the west of Herat was the considerable city of Btishanj or Ftishanj, which apparently occupied the site of the present Ghurian, lying a short distance from the left bank of the Hart RM, and to the south of it. Ibn Hawkal describes Biishanj as about half the size of Herat in the 4th (10th) century, and, like the latter, it lay in a plain two leagues distant from the mountains. The town was well built, and surrounded by trees, among which the juniper throve amazingly, its wood being largely exported. The town was strongly fortified, and was surrounded by a wall and a ditch. There were three gates, the Bab 'Ali towards NaysaMr, the Herat gate to the east, and the Kuhistan gate to the south-west. Yaklit, who had seen the town in passing, lying hidden in its wooded valley, gives the name as Bushanj or Ftishanj. He adds that the Persians pronounced it Bushang. Mustawfi describes Ftlshanj, in the 8th (14th) century, as famous for its water-melons and grapes, of which last there were 105 different varieties. A peculiarity of the place was that it possessed numerous windmills, their origin or invention being popularly attributed to the Pharaoh of Egypt, of the days of Moses, who had once come during a campaign as far east as this city. In 783 (1381) Ftishanj was stormed and sacked by Timtir, and this in spite of its high walls and deep water-ditch which are especially mentioned by f Ali of Yazd. For some unexplained reason the name of Fiishanj after this disappears from history, and at a later date the town of Ghurian, which is now a flourishing place, sprang up on the ruins of the city which Timtir had pillaged and destroyed. It is to be added that the three towns of Farjird, Kharjird, and Ktistiy, which have already been described as of the Kuhistan province (see p. 358), are often given as belonging to Ftishanj 2 . 1 1st. 267, 285.

The Asfuzar district lies to the south of Herat, on the road towards Zaranj, and in the 4th (10th) century four towns of importance existed here, besides the capital Asfuzar, namely Adraskar, Kuwaran, Ktishk, and Kuwashan. Asfuzar, now the chief town, at the present day goes by the name of Sabzivar (called Sabzivar of Herat, to distinguish it from Sabzivar to the west of Nishaptar; see p. 391). In early times, however, Kuwashan was the largest city of the district, which extended for three days' march from north to south with a breadth across of a day's march. According to Istakhri there was here a famous valley, called Kashkan, with many populous villages, and the river which has its head-waters near Asfuzar (Sabzivar) is that now known as the Hartid of Sistan, which flows into the head of the Zarah lake to the west of Juwayn. All these towns of Asfuzar are de scribed as surrounded by fertile lands and gardens. In the Itineraries Asfuzar bears the second name of Khastan (or Jashan, for the reading is uncertain), and it seems not unlikely that Kuwashan is merely another form of this name, and therefore really identical with Asfuzar (Sabzivar). The town of Adraskar, or Ardsakar, as it is also spelt, still exists to the east of Asfuzar, the name at the present day being written Adraskan. Yaktit records Asfuzar as of Sijistan, and Mustawfi speaks of it as a medium-sized town, with many villages and gardens rich in grapes and pomegranates, where already in the 8th (14th) century most of the people were Sunnis of the Shafi^te school. The relative positions of the other towns of the district are, unfortunately, not given in the Itineraries 1 . The high road from Herat northward to Marv-ar-RM crosses the great district of Badghis (Badhghis), which occupied the whole stretch of country lying between the Herat river on the west (to the north of Fiishanj) and the upper waters of the Murghab on the east, where these issue from the mountains of Gharjistan; and Badghis was itself watered by many of the left- A. Y. i. 312.

The eastern part of Badghis, beginning some 13 leagues to the north of Herat, was known as the Kanj Rustak district, and had three chief cities, Baban, Kayf, and Baghshur, the positions of which can approximately be fixed by the Itineraries. In the remainder of Badghis a list of nine large towns is given by Mukaddasi, but unfortunately the positions of none of these can be fixed, for they are not mentioned in the Itineraries, and at the present day the whole of this country is an uninhabited waste, having been ruined in the 7th (13th) century by the Mongol invasions. The numerous ruins scattered through out the district still attest the former state of prosperity of this well-watered country, but the modern names are not those given by the medieval authorities. The remains of the city of Baghshtir, one of the chief towns of Kanj Rustak, appear to be those now known as Kal c ah Mawn In the 4th (10th) century Ibn Hawkal describes Baghshiir as one of the finest and richest cities of Khurasan, being of the size of Bushanj. The governor of the district generally lived at Babnah or Baban, a larger town even than Bushanj, while Kayf is described as half the size of Baghshllr. All these places had well-built houses of sun-dried bricks, and were surrounded by fertile gardens and farms, for this district was abundantly irrigated by streams, and from wells. Yakut, who visited these countries in 616 (1219), confirms the above account of the former riches of Baghshilr and its neighbouring towns, but says that in his day the whole country had gone much to ruin, though this was before the Mongol invasion. Babnah he names Bavan, or Bawn, and he had himself stayed here; having also visited another town called Bamiyin, or Bamanj, which lay at a short distance only from Babnah. The country round he saw to be most fertile, and pistachio trees grew and flourished here abundantly 1 . In regard to the southern part of the Badghis district the 1 I. R. 173. 1st. 269. I. H. 320.

There are ruined forts and remains at Gulran, and Sagardan, and Kara Bagh (p. 101), also at Kal'ah Mawr (pp. 96, 103), and at Kara Tappah, some of which must be those of the towns named by the Arab geographers.414 KHURASAN. [CHAP. accounts of its former prosperity are as circumstantial as those describing Kanj Rustak, but its towns have now completely disappeared from the map, and the medieval names are difficult to locate, or identify with those given to the existing ruins. The capital by all accounts was Dihistan, the position of which may correspond with the present shrine of Khwajah Dihistan to the north-east of Herat; and Mukaddasi mentions seven other great cities, namely Ktighanabadh, Ktlfa, Busht, Jadhawa, Kabrun, Kalwiin, and Jabal-al-Fiddah or 'the Silver Hill,' the positions of which can only be very approximately indicated. Dihistan, the second largest city of Badghis, was in the 4th (10th) century a place half the size of Bushanj, and stood on a hill, its houses built of clay bricks, with good underground chambers for use in the summer heats. It had few gardens, but much arable land. The governor of the province lived at Kughanabadh, a smaller place than Dihistan. Jabal-al-Fiddah, as its name implied, was a town where there was a silver mine in the neighbouring hill, and it lay on the direct road from Herat to Sarakhs, and apparently to the north of Ktighanabadh. Fire-wood grew abundantly in its district. The town of Kiifa was a larger place than Jabal-al-Fiddah, and stood in a plain with excellent gardens; but of the four other towns mentioned by Mukaddasi no details are afforded, except the fact that they all lay near the road running from Herat north to Sarakhs. Yakut, who mentions Dihistan as the capital of Badghis, says the name of the district signifies Bad-khiz, £ where the wind rises,' on account of its tempestuous climate. The account which Mustawfi gives of Badghis is difficult to understand, for the names of places have been much corrupted in the mss. Dihistan was the capital, and the silver mine is referred to under the Persian form of Kiih Nukrah, c silver mountain'; a third place of importance was Kuh Ghunabad (for Kughanabadh), where the governor lived; and a fourth town was apparently called Buzurg- tann, but the reading is uncertain. Mustawfi also mentions a town named Kariz (or Karfzah), 'the Watercourse,' which he adds was the native place of Hakim Burka'i— c the physician with the face-veil' commonly known as the Moon-maker of Nakhshab, in other words the Veiled Prophet of Khurasan, whose revolt inxxix] khurAsan. 415 the 2nd (8th) century gave the Caliph Mahdi so much trouble to suppress. Other places are also mentioned (with many corruptions in the text), reproducing the list given by Mukaddasi and the earlier Arab geographers, but no details are added. In the 8th (14th) century, according to Mustawfi, Badghis was chiefly remarkable for its pistachio forests; and at the time of harvesting the nuts, great numbers of men assembled here, each gathering what he could carry away, and the nuts being afterwards sold in the neighbouring districts. Such was the abundance of the pistachio trees that Mustawfi adds, 'many make their liveli hood for the whole year round by what they can gather here at harvest-time, and it is indeed a wonder to behold.' At the close of the 8th (14th) century the ruin of Badghis appears to have been finally brought about by the passage of the armies of Timur on their devastating march from Herat to Marv-ar-Rud 1 . To the east of Badghis, at the head-waters of the Murghab river, is the mountainous region known to the earlier Arab geo graphers as Gharj-ash-Shar. The prince of these mountains had the title of the Shar, and Gharj, according to Mukaddasi, meant ' mountain' in the local dialect, so that Gharj-ash-Shar was equi valent to the ' Mountains of the Shar.' In the later middle-ages this region came to be more generally known as Gharjistan, and as such figures largely in the account of the Mongol invasion. Further, as Yakut remarks, Gharjistan, often spelt Gharshistan or Gharistan, was often confounded with Ghuristan, or the Ghur country, lying to the east of it, which will be more particularly 1 1st. 268, 269. I. H. 319, 320. Muk. 298, 308. Yak. i. 461 ; ii. 633. Mst. 187, 188. J. N. 314, 315. A. Y. i. 308. C. E. Yate, p. 6. The route from Herat to Marv-ar-Rud, given in the Itineraries of the earlier Arab geographers, goes from city to city through Kanj Rustak, and the southernmost stage (Babnah) is two days' march from Herat. Mustawfi (p. 198) gives a rather different road in seven stages, namely, from Herat in 5 leagues to Hangamabad, thence 5 to Badghis (to be understood doubtless as Dihistan the capital), thence 5 to Bawan (or Babnah), thence 5 to Marghzar Darrah, 'the Valley of the Meadow-lands,' thence 8 to Baghcht Shur (Baghshur), thence 5 to Usrud, or Lusrud, and finally, 4 leagues into Marv-ar-Rud. For the ruined caravanserais which still apparently mark this route see C. E. Yate, Afghanistan, pp. 194, 195, 222.4i6 KHURASAN. [CHAP. discussed presently. The Shar, or prince of Gharjistan, had of old been known to the Arabs as Malik-al-Gharjah (the king of the Gharj people), and in the 4th (10th) century this was a rich district, counting ten Friday Mosques as standing in its various towns. The two chief cities of Gharjistan were called Abshin and Shurmin, the exact sites of which are unknown. Abshin (Afshm, or Bashm) lay a bow-shot distant from the eastern bank of the upper Murghab, and four marches above Marv-ar-Rud, Round it were fine gardens, and much rice was sent from thence to Balkh. It had a strong castle, and a Friday Mosque. Shurmin (or Surmin) lay in the mountains four marches southward of Abshin, and likewise four marches from Karfikh to the north-east of Herat. From it they exported currants to all the neigh bouring places. The prince of the country, the Shar aforesaid^ resided at neither of these places, but at a great village in the mountains called Balikan (or Balkiyan). YaMt gives the names of two other cities of Gharjistan, namely Sinjah and Baywar, but except that they lay in the mountains, 4 as a man of the country told me, ? he cannot indicate their position 1 . The great mountain region to the east and south of Gharjistan was known as Ghur, or Ghtlristan, and it stretched from Herat to Bamiyan and the borders of Kabul and Ghaznah, also south ward of the Herat river. The medieval geographers refer to it as the country of the head-waters of many great rivers, namely of the Hari RM, also of the Helmund, the Khwash, and the Farah rivers (which drained to the Zarah lake), while on its Gharjistan frontier rose the Murghab. The geography of this immense region of mountains is, unfortunately, a complete blank, for the sites of none of the towns and castles mentioned in its history are known. In the 4th (10th) century, according to Ibn Hawkal,, Ghiir was infidel land, though many Moslems lived there. Its 1 1st. 271, 272. I. H. 323. Muk. 309, 348.

Gharjistan of Khurasan has nothing to do with Gurjistan south of the Caucasus (see Chapter XII, p. 181) now commonly known to us as Georgia, and it is quite a mistake to give the name of Georgia to Gharjistan, as has been done by some writers when describing the Mongol invasion of this- region of the upper Murghab, for there is no Georgia of Afghanistan.k XXTX] KHURASAN. )■ 417 valleys were populous and extremely fertile; it being famous for mines, both of silver and gold, which existed in the mountains towards Bamiyan and Panj-hir (see above, p. 350). The richest of these mines was called Kharkhiz. After the fall of the dynasty of Mahmud of Ghaznah, the Ghurid chiefs, at first his lieutenants, became independent, and eventually founded their capital at Firiizkuh, an immense fortress in the mountains, the position of which is not known. The Ghiirid princes ruled independently from the middle of the 6th (12th) century to 612 (1215), when they were defeated by the Khwarizm Shah, and a few years later the dynasty dis appeared at the time of the Mongol invasion. Before this, however, in 588 (1192), the Ghtirids had conquered much of northern India, holding all the country from Dehli to Herat, and after the dynasty had been annihilated by the Mongols the Slave Kings (their Mamluk generals) continued to rule Dehli in a long line of Sultans, down to 962 (1554). Ghur, or Ghuristan, attained its highest point of splendour and riches between 543 and 612 (1148 and 1215) under the Ghflrid princes of the Sam dynasty. YaMt speaks of their great capital at Finizkiah, or Biruzkuh (Turquoise Mountain), but gives no details; Mustawfi also briefly refers to this fortress, and says that another of its chief towns was RM Hangaran, but the reading is very uncertain. In 619 (1222) the whole country was overrun by Changiz Khan, Firuzkuh being stormed and left in ruins. Two other great fortresses are named as having given much trouble to the Mongol troops, namely Kalyun and Fivar, lying ten leagues distant one from the other, but the position of neither is known, and both are said to have been entirely destroyed by Changiz Khan. Kazvini in the 7th (13th) century also names Khust as one of the great cities of Ghtir, and possibly this is identical with Khasht, the place previously mentioned (p. 410) as near the head waters of the Hari RM. In the time of Timur the only place referred to in Ghur appears to be the castle called Kal'ah Khastar, but, again, nothing is known of its position 1 . 1 1st. 272. I. H. 304, 323.

The city of Bamiyan was the capital of a great district of the same name which formed the eastern part of Ghiir, and as its very ancient remains show, was a great Buddhist centre long before the days of Islam. Istakhri describes Bamiyan as half the size of Balkh in the 4th (10th) century, and though the town, which stood on a hill, was unfortified, its district was most fertile, being watered by a considerable river. Mukaddasi names the city Al-LaMm, but the reading is uncertain, and he praises it as f the trade-port of Khurasan and the treasure- house of Sind.' It was very cold and there was much snow, but in its favour was the fact that bugs and scorpions were conspicuously absent. The city had a Friday Mosque, and rich markets stood in the extensive suburbs, while four gates gave egress from the town. In the 4th (10th) century the Bamiyan territory included many large cities, the sites of which are now completely lost. The three chief towns are said to have been called Basghurfand, Sakiwand, and Lakhrab. Yakut in the beginning of the 7th (13th) century describes in some detail the great sculptured statues of Buddha still to be seen at Bamiyan. High up in the mountain side, he writes, there was a chamber supported on columns, and on its walls had been sculptured the likenesses of ' every species of bird that Allah had created—most wonderful to see.' Without the chamber-entrance are ^wo mighty idols cut in the live rock of the hill-side, from base to summit, and these are known as the Surkh Bud and the Khing Bud [the Red and the Grey Buddha] and nowhere else in the world is there aught to equal these. 7 Kazvini speaks of a 'Golden House' at Bamiyan, and likewise describes the two great statues of Buddha; further he mentions a quicksilver (ztbak) mine and a sulphur spring as of this neighbourhood. The ruin of Bamiyan and all its province, even as far east as the Panj-hir mines, as already mentioned, was due to the wrath of Changiz Khan, whose favourite grandson Muttikin, son of Jaghatay, was killed at the siege of Bamiyan. The Mongol troops were ordered to level with the ground the town walls and all the houses, and Changiz forbade any to build or live here ever again, the name of Bamiyan being changed to Mav Balik, which in theCHAPTER XXX.

Balkh—' Mother of Cities : —gave its name to the fourth Quarter of Khurasan, which, outside the district of the capital, was divided, west and east, between the two great districts of Juzjan and Tukharistan. In the 3rd (9th) century Ya'kubi speaks of Balkh as the greatest city of all Khurasan. It had had of old three concen tric walls, and thirteen gates, and Mukaddasi adds that it had been called in early days the equivalent, in Persian, of Balkh-al- Bahiyyah, 'Beautiful Balkh.' Outside the town lay the famous suburb of Naw Bahar, and the houses extended over an area measuring three miles square. There were, says Ya'kubi, two score Friday Mosques in the city. Istakhri remarks that Balkh stood in a plain, being four leagues from the nearest mountains, called Jabal Ktt. Its houses were built of sun-dried bricks, and the same material was used in the city wall, outside which was a deep ditch. The markets and the chief Friday Mosque stood in the central part of the city. The stream that watered Balkh was called Dahas, which, says Ibn Hawkal, signifies 'ten mills' (in Persian); the river turns these as it runs past the Naw Bahar gate, flowing on thence to irrigate the lands and farms of Siyahjird on the Tirmid road. All round Balkh lay gardens producing oranges, the Nilufar lily, and the sugar-cane, which, with the produce of itsCHAP. XXX] KHURASAN. 421 vineyards, were all exported in quantity. Further, its markets were much frequented by merchants. The city possessed seven gates, namely Bab Naw Bahar, Bab Rahbah (the Gate of the Square), Bab-al-Hadid (the Iron Gate) Bab Hinduwan (the Gate of the Hindus), Bab-al-YahM (the Jews' Gate), Bab Shast-band (the Gate of the Sixty Dykes), and Bab Yahya. Mukaddasi describes in general terms the beauty, splen dour, and riches of Balkh, its many streams, its cheap living, for food-stufifs were abundant, the innumerable broad streets, its walls and its Great Mosque, also its many well-built palaces; and in this state of prosperity Balkh flourished till the middle of the 6th (12th) century, when it was laid in ruins for the first time by the invasion of the Ghuzz Turks in 550 (1155). After their departure the population came back, and rebuilt the city in another but closely adjacent place. In part Balkh before long recovered its former splendour, and thus is described by YaMt in the early part of the 7th (13th) century, immediately before its second devastation at the hands of the Mongols. Of the great suburb of Balkh called Naw Bahar, where accord ing to Mas'udi had stood, in Sassanian days, one of the chief fire-temples of the Guebres, Yakut has a long account, which he quotes from the work of ^mar-ibn-al-Azrak of Kirman, and a similar description is found in Kazvini. Of this fire-temple at Balkh the chief priest had been Barmak, ancestor of the Barme cides, and in Sassanian days his family had been hereditary chief-pontiffs of the Zoroastrian faith in this city. The account given of Naw Bahar, briefly, is that it was originally built in imitation of, and as a rival to, the Ka'abah of Mecca. Its walls were adorned with precious stones, and brocaded curtains were hung everywhere to cover these, the walls themselves being periodically unguented with perfumes, especially in the spring time, for Naw Bahar means 4 First or Early Spring/ the season when pilgrimage was made to the shrine. The chief building was surmounted by a great cupola, called Al-Ustfoi, a hundred ells and more in height, and round this central building were 360 chambers, where the priests who served had their lodgings, one priest being appointed for each day of the year. On the summit of the dome was a great silk flag, which the wind blew out at ■KHURASAN. times to a fabulous distance. This principal building was full of figures or idols, one of which in chief the pilgrims from Kabul, India, and China prostrated themselves before, afterwards kissing the hand of Barmak, the chief priest. All the lands found Naw Bahar for seven leagues square were the property of the sanctuary, and these brought in a great revenue. The great Naw Bahar shrine was destroyed by Ahnaf ibn Kays, when he conquered Khurasan in the days of the Caliph ^thman, and converted the people to Islam 1 . The Mongols in 617 (1220) devastated Balkh, and according to Ibn Battitah, Changiz Khan ruined the third part of its Great Mosque in his fruitless search for hidden treasure. When Ibn Batutah visited this district in the earlier half of the 8th (14th) century Balkh was still a complete ruin, and uninhabited, but outside the walls were a number of tombs and shrines that were still visited by the pious pilgrims. In the account of the campaigns of Timtlr, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, Balkh is often mentioned, and by this date must have recovered part of its former glory. « Timiir restored the fortress outside the walls called Kal'ah Hinduwan, the Castle of the Hindus, which became the residence of his governor, and at a later date he also rebuilt much of the older city. Balkh at the present day is an important town of modern Afghanistan, and is celebrated for its great shrine, called Mazar- i-Sharif (the Noble Tomb), where the Caliph 4 All—known as Shah-i-Mardan, ' King of Men'—is popularly supposed to have been buried. According to Khwandamir this, supposititious, grave of the martyred 'Ali was discovered in the year 885 (1480), when Mirza Baykara, a descendant of Timtar, was governor of Balkh. For in that aforesaid year a book of history, written in the time of 1 Ykb. 287, 288. 1st. 275, 278, 280. I. H. 325, 326, 329. Muk. 301, 302. Mas. iv. 48. Yak. i. 713; iv. 817, 818. Kaz. ii. 221. The curious passage about Naw Bahar will be found translated, in full, by M. Barbier de Meynard in his Dictionnaire Geographique de la Perse^ p. 569. The presence of the idols, great and small, and the (sacred) flags, suggested to Sir H. Rawlinson the idea that Naw Bahar had been originally a Buddhist shrine, and the name he explained as Naw Viharah, 4 the New Viharah/ or Buddhist Monastery. See J, R. G. S. 1872, p. 510.423 Sultan Sanjar the Saljiik, was shown to Mirza Baykara, in which it was stated that ^Ali lay buried at the village of Khwajah Khayran, a place lying three leagues distant from Balkh. On the governor forthwith going there and making due search a slab was discovered bearing the inscription in Arabic, 'This is the tomb of the Lion of Allah, and His saint, 'All, brother [for cousin] of the Apostle of Allah.' A great shrine was therefore built over this grave, and ever since this has been highly venerated by the people of central Asia, and is still a notable place of pilgrimage 1 . Jtlzjan (Al-Jtizajan or Juzjanan) was the western district of the Balkh quarter, through which the road passed from Marv-ar-RM to Balkh city. During the middle-ages this was a most populous district, possessing many cities, of which three only now exist under their old names, though the positions of most of the other towns mentioned by the Arab geographers can be fixed from the Itineraries. Though the names are changed, ruins still mark their sites. The whole district was extremely fertile, and much merchandise was exported, especially hides, which were tanned here and carried to all parts of Khurasan 2 . Three marches distant from Marv-ar-RM, towards Balkh, was the city of Talikan, the name of which is no longer found on the map, but the ruins and mounds of brick near Chachaktti probably mark its site. Already in the 3rd (9th) century Talikan was a town of much importance, and Ya'ktibi says that the Talikan felts made here were celebrated. The town lay among the mountains, and there was a magnificent Friday Mosque here. Istakhri in the following century stated that Talikan was as large as Marv-ar-RM, and its climate was more healthy. Its houses were built of sun-dried bricks. Near by was the village of Junduwayh, where, according to Yaktit, in the 2nd (8th) century, the great battle had been fought and won by Abu Muslim at the head of the Abbasid partizans against the Omayyad troops. Shortly after the time when YaMt wrote, in 617 (1220), Talikan was stormed after a siege of seven months by Changiz Khan, and 1 I. B. iii. 58, 59. A. Y. i. 176. Khwandamir, iii. pt 3, p. 238. C. E.

In the mountains—with a situation at the foot of hill-spurs and gulleys that, it was said, resembled Mecca—was the town of Jurzuwan, where the governor of the Juzjan district passed the summer heats. The name of Al-Jurzuwan, as the Arabs called it, the Persians pronounced Kurzuwan or Gurzuvan, and it was also written Jurzuban or Gurzuban. It lay between Talikan and Marv-ar-Rud, in the district towards the Ghur frontier, and, Yakiit says, was very populous and full of rich folk. No place of this name now exists on the map, but the ruins at Kal'ah Wall most probably mark its site 1 . The city of Maymanah, which lay two marches beyond Talikan on the Balkh road, still exists as a flourishing town. In the earlier middle-ages it was called Al-Yahudan, or Al-Yahudiyah, 'the Jews' Town,' and was often counted as the capital of Juzjan. Its Friday Mosque, Ibn Hawkal says, had two minarets. Yakut, who gives the name also under the form J ah udan-al-Ku bra, 'the Great Jewry,' says that it was first settled by the Israelites whom Nebuchadnezzar sent hither from Jerusalem. The name was changed to Maymanah, meaning ' the Auspicious Town,' for the sake of good augury, since ' Jew-town' to the Moslems was a term of reproach, and as Maymanah it exists at the present day. Maymanah is apparently also mentioned by Mustawfi, who speaks of it, in the 8th (14th) century, as a medium-sized town of the hot region, growing corn, fruit, and dates, and taking its water-supply from the neighbouring river. There is, however, possibly some confusion between this Maymanah of Jiizjan, and Maymand for Ykb. 1st. 270. i. h. 321, 322. Yak. ii. 59, 129 J iii. 491, iv. 258. A. G. 114. C.

The ruins at Chachaktu (Talikan) are 45 miles as the crow flies from Bala Murghab (Marv- ar-Rud), which would be an equivalent of the three days' march, in a moun tainous country, from this last place to Talikan. The name of Chachaktu (written Jijaktu) is mentioned by 'Ali of Yazd (i. 806 ; ii. 593) in his accounts of the campaigns of Timur, but Talikan is not mentioned by him. The ruins at Kal'ah Wall (probably Jurzuwan) lie 27 miles from Bala Murghab. An alternative site might be found at the considerable remains existing near Takht- i-Khatun. Either of these places may be Gurzuwan, which it is to be noted was a mint city under the Khwarizm Shahs.xxx] khurAsan. 425 May wand in Zabulistan, half-way between Girishk and Kandahar; and this confusion reappears in the pages of YakCit, who writes of Maymand (or Mimand) of Ghaznah, and says it £ lay between Bamiyan and Ghur/ evidently meaning Maymanah or Yahudiyah. One march from Yahudiyah or Maymanah was the town of Kandaram, also written Kandadram, the residence, according to Ya c kiibi, of the governor of Jflzjan. It was a city of the mountains, Istakhn writes, rich in vineyards and nut-trees, and abundantly irrigated by running streams 1 . One of the most important towns of Jfizjan during the middle ages was Al-Faryab, the name of which has completely disappeared from the map, but from the position given by the Itineraries the ruins of Faryab may be identified as those now known as Khay- rabad, where there is an ancient fort surrounded by mounds of brick. Al-Fariyab, as Ibn Hawkal spells the name, was in the 4th (10th) century a smaller town than Talikan, but more fertile and with finer gardens. It was very healthy, and much merchan dise was to be found collected here. It had a fine Friday Mosque, which however possessed no minaret. Yakilt, who also spells the name Firyab, gives its position in regard to Talikan and Shaburkan, but adds no details. In 617 (1220), shortly after his time, Faryab was completely ruined by the Mongols, and it is only incidentally mentioned by Mustawfi. Between Al-Yahfidiyah and Al-Faryab, according to Ibn Hawkal, there 'stood the city of Marsan, nearly of the size of Al-YahMiyah in the 4th(ioth) century; and possibly this is identical with the village of Nariyan which Yaklit mentions as in a like position. Of this mountain region also was the small city of San which Ibn Hawkal describes as having many fruitful gardens growing grapes and nuts, for its streams brought water without stint 2 . 1 Ykb. 287. 1st. 270, 271.

Faryab of Juzjan is called Dih Baryab by Nasir-i-Khusraw, who passed through it going from Shaburkan to Talikan. It is also given as Barab in the Jahdn Numd (p. 324), and it is not to be confused with Farab, also called Barab, which is Otrar on the Jaxartes, as will be mentioned in Chapter XXXIV.426 khur A san. [chap Shaburkan, spelt variously Ashburkan or Ushburkan, also ShubCirkan or Sabiirghan, which still exists, had in the 3rd (9th) century been once the seat of government of the Juzjan district, which afterwards was removed to Yahudiyah (Maymanah), at that time its equal in size. Its gardens and fields were wonderfully fertile, and large quantities of fruits were exported. Yakfit, who spells the name Shubrukan or Shufrukan and Shabur kan, says that in 617 (1220), at the time of the Mongol invasion, it was a very populous town, with much merchandise in its markets. A century later Mustawfi speaks of it in similar terms, coupling Shuburkan and Faryab together, also adding that corn was abundant and cheap here. One day to the south of Shubiirkan, and the same distance eastward of Yahudiyah, was Anbar, otherwise written Anbir, which Ibn Hawkal says was larger than Marv-ar-Rud. Here the governor of the district had his residence in the winter. No town of this name now exists, but by position Anbar is probably identical in site with Sar-i-plil, on the upper part of the Shubiirkan river, still a place of some importance. The town was sur rounded by vineyards and its houses were clay-built. It was often counted as the chief city of Juzjan, and is probably the town which Nasir-i-Khusraw visited on his road to Shuburghan, and which he calls the city (or capital) of Juzjanan. He speaks of its great Friday Mosque, and remarks on the wine-bibbing habits of the people. Out in the plain, to the north-west of Shubiirkan, lies the town of Andkhuy, the name of which in the earlier geographers is spelt variously Andakhud, Addakhud, and An- Nakhud. Ibn Hawkal speaks of it as a small town out in the desert, with seven villages lying round it, and, in the 4th (10th) century, for the most part inhabited by Kurds, who possessed many sheep and camels. Yaktit mentions it, but adds no details; the name also frequently occurs in the accounts of Timur's campaigns'. The great district of Tukharistan lay to the eastward of Balkh, stretching along the south side of the Oxus as far as the frontiers 1 Ykb. 287. 1st. 270, 271. i. h. 321, 322. N. K. 2.

It was divided into Upper Tukharistan, east of Balkh and along the Oxus, and Lower Tukharistan which lay further to the south-east, on the frontiers of Badakhshan. Many towns are mentioned as of Tukharistan by the medieval geographers, but they add few details concerning them, so that excepting in the case of those given in the Itineraries, and those which still exist, it is now impossible to identify the greater number of them. Two days' march to the east of Balkh is Khulm, described by Mukaddasi as a small city surrounded by many large villages and districts, with a good climate. Two days' march again from Khulm lay Siminjan and Rtib, two towns near together, which probably are represented at the present day by Haybak, south of Khulm, on the upper course of the Khulm river. Mukaddasi speaks of Siminjan as a larger town than Khulm; it had a Friday Mosque, and excellent fruit was grown, and YaMt describes it as lying in a maze of valleys, which were, or had been, peopled by Arabs of the Tamun tribe. Mustawfi mentions Siminjan as a large town, already ruined in the 8th (14th) century, but where corn, cotton, and grapes were much cultivated; and under the spelling Saminkan it is mentioned by 'Ali of Yazd in describing the march of Timtir from Khulm to the Indian frontier. Beyond, south-east of Siminjan, was Baghlan, Upper and Lower, and in the latter district, according to Mukaddasi, was the capital with a Friday Mosque in the 4th (10th) century. Baghlan, or Baklan, as the name of the district is spelt by 'Ali of Yazd, apparently lay along the road to Andarabah, otherwise Andarab, which is described by Mukaddasi as having fine markets, being situated among valleys clothed by verdant forests. These valleys, which were on the northern slopes of the Panj-hir range, had many silver mines in their recesses, according to Ibn Hawkal, who speaks of two rivers, the Nahr Andarab, and the Nahr Kasan, as flowing down through this district. Yakut, who gives no additional details, spells the name Andarab or Andarabah 1 . 1 1st. 279. I. H. 326. Muk. 296, 303. Yak. i. 372; ii. 827; iii. 142, 518. Mst. 188. A. Y. ii. 19. C. E. Yate, Afghanistan, 317. For the relative positions of these places see Map 1, p. r.KHURASAN. [CHAP. The Khulm river does not flow into the Oxus, but is lost in marshes a few miles to the north of the ruins of the old town. At the nearest bend of the Oxus to Khulm, there was in the 4th (10th) century a strongly fortified guard-house, called Rubat Milah, where the road coming in three marches from Balkh crossed the great river into Transoxiana and the Khuttal country. Two marches to the eastward of Khulm was Warwaliz, or Warwalij, which Ibn Hawkal and others describe as a large city in the 4th (10th) century. No town of this name now exists, but by its position in the Itineraries it must have stood very near the site of Kunduz. Yaktit, who apparently by a clerical error gives 'the name as Wazwalin, adds no details, and neither he nor any of the earlier geographers mention Kunduz, which is doubtless an abbreviation for Kuhandiz, the common name for ' fortress' in Persian, and as such possibly applied to the old castle of Warwaliz 1 . Two days' march to the east of Warwaliz lay Tayikan, or Talikan of Tukharistan, which still exists (not to be confounded with Talikan of Juzjan, described above, p. 423), and which in the 4th (10th) century was one of the most populous towns of the district. At-Talikan, as Mukaddasi spells the name, though At-Tayikan is the better form, had a large market; it stood in the plain a bow-shot from the hills, and was in the 4th (10th) century about a third the size of Balkh. Its lands were watered by an affluent of the Oxus, called Khuttalab (sometimes written Khaylab); and the Watrab river (or Tarab, for the readings of these two names are doubtful) appears to have been one of its branch streams, which joined the Khuttalab above Kunduz. The neighbourhood was extremely fertile, and it was a pleasant country j corn and much fruit, according to Mustawfi, were grown, and in the 8th (14th) century, most of the population were weavers. It then possessed a strong fortress, and was surrounded by well-cultivated districts, where grapes, figs, peaches, and pistachios grew abundantly. 'Alt of Yazd frequently mentions layikan when relating the campaigns of Tinulr, and according to the older geographers seven days' march east of this was Badakh- shan, which will be noticed in the following chapter 2 . 1st. 279.

Both sheep and camels were to be had here cheap, and Turkish slaves—a boy or girl slave, he says, fetching as much as 5000 dinars (about ^2500)—and all food-stuffs were plentiful. Mukaddasi enters into further details. Naysabflr was the chief manufacturing centre. Various white cloths were made here; and stuffs for turbans woven in the straight, or across, or diagonally. Veils, thin lining materials, woollens and raw silks, brocades of silk and of silk mixed with cotton, and various linen stuffs and cloths of goat's hair; all these were famous products of Naysabur. Here, too, were made cloaks, fine thread, and tabby silks in all varieties. Ironware was forged here, as well as needles and knives. The gardens of Naysabur were renowned for their figs, truffles, and rhubarb, and from the mine in the hills of the Rivand district came the famous turquoises (firusaj) of Nishaptir. The towns of Nisa and Abivard were noted for their raw silk stuffs, and the cloth that the women wove in these districts. Fox- skin pelisses also were made up here. Nisa in particular had a special breed of falcons, and produced much sesame seed. From Tus came great cooking pots, a speciality of the town, also mats, and most of the cereals were largely exported. Excellent belts and cloaks were likewise manufactured. Herat produced brocade stuffs of all kinds, preserves made of raisins and pistachios, and divers syrups. Steel, too, was admirably forged in Herat. From the mountainous country of Gharj-ash-Shar came felts and carpets, saddle cloths and cushions. Gold was found here, and horses and mules were exported largely. Marv was a great place for all loom work in silk, mixed cotton and silk, and pure cotton, of which veils and all sorts of cloth were woven. The districts round the city produced oil of sesame, condiments and aromatics, and manna. Brass pots were made in Marv, and its bakers produced a variety of excellent cakes. The neighbourhood of Balkh yielded sesame, rice, almonds, nuts, and raisins. Its soap-boilers were famous, and the 472. Yak. iii. 501; v. 24. Mst. 188, 189. A. Y. i. 82, 179. The name is spelt (with or without the article) Tayikan, or Tayikan, and, finally, Talikan, like the town in Juzjan.43° KHURASAN. [CHAP. confectioners here made divers kinds of the so-called ' honey' from grapes and figs, as well as a preserve of pomegranate kernels. Syrups and clarified butter were largely exported; and in the neighbourhood were mines of lead, vitriol, and arsenic. The incense of Balkh too was famous, and its turmeric, unguents, and preserves. From it came hides and cloaks, and from Tirmidh, across the Oxus, soap and assafoetida. As coming from Warwalij towards Badakhshan, Mukaddasi gives a long list of fruits, such as nuts, almonds, pistachios, and pears. Rice and sesame too were largely traded, also various cheeses and clarified butter, and finally horns and furs, more especially fox-skins 1 . The high roads through Khurasan and Kuhistan were as follows. The great Khurasan road entered Khurasan beyond Bistam (in Ktimis, see p. 365), and from this place to NaysaMr there were two routes. The northern, or caravan road went from Bistam to Jajarm, and thence by Azadvar through the plain of Juvayn down to Naysabtir. This is the road especially given by Mustawfi, and only in sections by Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal. The southern, shorter route is the post-road to Naysabtir, which started from Badhash, already mentioned (p. 368) as two leagues from Bistam. This road keeps along the skirts of the hills with the desert on the right hand, and coming to Asadabad, next passes through Bahmanabad or Mazinan, where a branch went north to Azadvar. Continuing eastward through Sabzivar, the post-road finally reaches Naysabtir, and this is the route described by Ibn Khurdadbih and in all the earlier Itineraries. From Asadabad going south-east, Mukaddasi says there was a track across this corner of the Great Desert, in 30 leagues, to Turshiz in Kiihistan, while from Naysabtir to Turshiz, the route is given by both Ibn Khurdadbih and Mukaddasi. From Naysabftr north to Nisa the stages are also given by Mukaddasi 2 . One stage beyond Naysabtlr at Kasr-ar-Rih or Dizbad (Castle of the Wind) the Khurasan road bifurcated. To the right, south east, the way went down to Herat, and this will be noticed in the succeeding paragraph. From the Castle of the Wind, turning left 3 1st. 281. I. H. 330. Muk. 323—326. 2 I.

From Sarakhs the desert was crossed to Great Marv, and thence by the desert again the road reached the Oxus bank at Amul (or Chahar-JHy), whence, after leaving Khurasan, Bukhara- was the terminus. This stretch of the Khurasan road from NaysaMr to Amul of the Oxus passage is given with but slight variations by nearly all the Itineraries, and most of its stages still exist at the present day under the old names 1 . As already said, the Khurasan road branched to the right, one stage beyond NaysaMr, whence Herat was reached. At Sarakhs and Marv there were also bifurcations to the right, these roads both going to Marv-ar-RM, and to this city also a road led north from Herat. From Marv-ar-RM the main road then led north east to Balkh, beyond which it crossed the Oxus to Tirmidh. Taking first the Herat road, from the bifurcation at the Castle of the Wind, it was four stages to Btizjan, and a like distance on to Bushanj, whence to Herat was a day's march. This road is given by Ibn Rustah and the geographers of the 4th (10th) century, also by Mustawfi. From Biazjan and from Btishanj roads respectively went off to the south-west and west, which centred in Kayin, and the distances between the various cities of Kuhistan are given by Istakhri and others. At Kayin also centred the roads coming from Tabas and Khtir on the borders of the Great T3esert 2 . From Herat southwards the road went down to Zaranj, passing through Asfuzar, and crossing the Sijistan frontier between that town and Farah (see above, p. 341). This road is given by Ibn Rustah and the three geographers of the 4th (10th) century. From Herat eastward, up the valley of the Han Rtid to the Ghilr frontier, the names of the towns one day's march apart are given by the same three authorities. From Herat through Kartikh the distances are also given by the geographers of the 4th (10th) century, in days' marches to Shurmm and Abshin in Ghurjistan, whence down the Murghab Marv-ar-RM was reached. And to Marv-ar-RM or Kasr Ahnaf (Martichak) the roads are given 1 I. K. 24, 25. Kud. 201, 202. I. R. 171. Ykb. 279. Muk. 348, 351. Mst. 196 (as far as Sarakhs). 2 I.

XXX across Badghis (going by Baghshur, the capital) in Istakhn, Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi, as also by Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century 1 . From Sarakhs, and from Great Marv, respectively, two roads converged on Marv-ar-RM, the first crossing the desert between the two great rivers, the last coming up the Murghab through the fertile lands and towns on its bank. The desert route, passing by a number of successive Rubats, or guard-houses, is only given by Mukaddasi, being merely copied by Mustawfi, and in the Turkish Jahan Numa. The road from Great Marv up the Murghab is given by Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, also by Mukaddasi, but by a different route 2 . From Marv-ar-Rfid to Balkh, through the Juzjan district, Ibn Khurdadbih and the earlier Itineraries give the road by Talikan and thence on, either by Faryab and Shaburkan, or by Yahudiyah (Maymanah), and Anbar, to Balkh. Istakhri and Mukaddasi give the distances by the number of marches. Mustawfi has a some what different route from Marv-ar-Rud to Balkh, which passed to the westward of both Talikan, which lay six leagues off the road to the right, and Faryab, which lay two leagues away likewise on the right hand, reaching Shaburkan, and eventually, by the Jamtikhiyan bridge Balkh. This route is copied in the Jahan Numa. From Balkh the Oxus was reached opposite Tirmidh in two stages, passing through Siyahjird 3 . Fast from Balkh the road went by Khulm and Tayikan to the frontiers of Badakhshan, a branch road going south-east from Khulm to Andarabah and the Panj-hir mines north of Kabul. Istakhn and Mukaddasi also give skeleton routes from Balkh across the mountains to Bamiyan, and thence south by Ghaznah to Kusdar, with a branch from Ghaznah eastward to the Indian frontier, but in these routes the stages are uncertain, for the places named are elsewhere unknown 4 .

Freezing of the Oxus in winter. The Oxus of old was held to be the boundary line between the Persian-speaking folk and the Turks, between Iran and Ttiran ; and the provinces north, beyond it, were known to the Arabs as Ma-wara-n-Nahr, 'Those beyond the River' (Oxus, understood), or otherwise as the Haytal. The Haytal, in the 5th century a.d., had been the chief enemies of the Sassanian monarchy, and were identical with the Ephthalites of the Byzantine authors, commonly known as the White Huns. To the medieval Arabs, however, the name Haytal had come to be employed loosely to mean all the Tiiranian peoples and lands lying beyond the Oxus, and as such it is used by Mukaddasi. These lands may conveniently be divided into five provinces. The most important was Sughd, the ancient Sogdiana, with its two capitals Bukhara and Samarkand. To the west of Sughd was Khwarizm, now generally known as Khivah, comprising the Oxus delta; and to the south-east Saghaniyan, with Khuttal and the other great districts on the upper Oxus; to which also belonged Badakh shan, though this lay on the left or south bank, being almost encircled by the great bend of the river beyond Tukharistan. Lastly, the two provinces of the Jaxartes were Farghanah on the upper river, and the province of Shash (now Tashkand) with the L e S. 28434 THE OXUS. [CHAP. districts to the north-west, running down to the outflow of the Jaxartes into the swamps of the Aral Sea. The medieval Arabs knew the rivers Oxus and Jaxartes under the names, respectively, of JayMn and Sayhtin, which like the Tigris and Euphrates, the legend said, were the rivers of Paradise. The origin of these names is not quite clear, but apparently the Arabs took them from the Jews, JayMn and Sayh6n being cor rupted forms of two of the rivers mentioned in Genesis ii. n, 13, to wit the Gihon and the Pison 1 . In the later middle-ages, about the time of the Mongol irrup tion, the names JayMn and SayMn to a great extent went out of use; the Oxus was then more generally called the Amtiyah, or AmU Darya, while the Jaxartes, as will be seen in a later chapter, came to be known as the Sir Darya. The origin of the term Amtiyah, or Amii, is also not quite clear. According to Hafiz Abrli this is explained to be merely the name of the town and district on the Khurasan bank of the Oxus originally written Amul (at Chahar Jtly, see above, p. 403). Possibly, however, the case is inverted, and the true explanation may be that Amul city came to be called Am^yah or Amu from a local (Persian) name of the great river, which, coming into common use, supplanted the more classical (Arabic) name JayMn. It is further to be observed that, with the Arabs, rivers were very commonly named from the great cities on their banks; hence the Oxus or Amft Darya, the River of Amti, also was often called the Balkh river, although that city stands some miles distant from its southern bank. The name Oxus, by which the Greeks knew the great river, is preserved in Wakhsh-ab, the Wakhsh river, which is one of its upper affluents, 1 1st. 286, 287, 295. I. H. 335, 347, 348. Muk. 261—268. As has been already mentioned (p. 131), the same names, under the slightly altered forms of Jayhan and Sayhan, were given to the Pyramus and Sams respectively, the two frontier rivers of Cilicia, over against the Greek lands. As to the etymology of these names, it would seem that being taken from a foreign language, and their meaning unknown, the name Sayhun was brought into a jingling rhyme with Jayhun; and this is the case with many other borrowed names, e.g. in the Kuran and Tradition, Kdbtl, Hdbil, for Cain and Abel; Tdltit, Jdm, for Saul and Goliath; Ydjuj, Mdjiij, for Gog and Magog. See Sir H. Yule, in Capt. J. Wood, The Oxus (1872), p. xxii.XXXI] THE OXUS. 435 but by the Arabs the name Wakhsh does not appear ever to have been applied to the main stream. The sources of the Oxus, as Ibn Rustah and other early aA geographers rightly state, were from a lake in Little Tibet (At- ^ Tubbat) and on the Pamir (Famir). Istakhri, who is copied by most subsequent writers, gives the names of four among the many upper affluents of the Oxus. These are not in every case easy to identify, but the following appears to be clearly indicated. The main stream of the upper Oxus was the Nahr Jaryab, at the present day known as the Panj river, which reached Badakhshan from the east, coming through the country known as Wakhkhan, and the Jaryab was also known as the Wakhkhab river. This main stream of the Oxus, coming down from the eastern highlands, makes an immense sweep round Badakhshan, flowing north, then west, and finally south before reaching the neighbourhood of Khulm, and in this course of three-quarters of a circle it receives many great affluents on its right bank. The first of these is the Andijaragh, with the town of the same name near its junction with the Oxus; and this appears identical with the present Bartang river. Next there joined the Nahr Farghar (also written Farghar, Farghan, or Farghi) flowing down from the Khuttal country, which must be identical with the Wanj river of to-day. Below came in the Nahr Akhshawa (or Akhsh), almost equalling the main stream of the Oxus, on which stood Hulbuk, the chief town of Khuttal. One of its head-streams was the Nahr Balban, or Barban, and these united rivers at the present day are known under the Turkish name of Ak-Sii or White River. These, therefore, are the four upper affluents of the Oxus as named by Istakhri, and he states that their various places of junction were all above the ford, or passage of the main stream at Arhan. Also above this ford, but on the left bank, the Badakhshan river, now called the Gukchah, flowed into the Oxus, being known as the Nahr Dirgham. Below the Arhan ford the Oxus received its great right-bank affluent, namely the Wakhshab or Wakhsh river, from which the Greeks, as already said, took their name Oxus ; and this divided the countries of Khuttal and Wakhsh on the east, from the districts of Kubadhiyan and Saghaniyan on the west. The Wakhshab is the river now known 28—2 _L436 THE OXUS. [CHAP as the Surkhab, or Red River. Where the Oxus, after curving round three sides of Badakhshan, finally takes its course westward, it receives on its left, or southern bank the rivers of Tayikan and Kunduz from Tukharistan. These Ibn Rustah calls the Nahr Khuttalab, and the Nahr Watrab, respectively, as has been noticed in the previous chapter (p. 428). The two rivers of Kubadhiyan and Saghaniyan—the latter, which flows past Tirmidh, named the Nahr Zamil by Ibn Rustah—joined the Oxus on its northern or right bank, and had their sources in the Buttam mountains, which here to the north divided the Oxus watershed from that of the Zarafshan in Sughd. These are the last of the affluents of the great river, for west of Balkh the Oxus receives no other stream, and takes its course through the desert, west and north-west, direct to its delta south of the Aral Sea'. The country of Badakhshan lay to the eastward of Tukharistan, surrounded on three sides, as we have seen, by the great bend of the upper Oxus. Istakhn describes this province as very populous and fertile, with refreshing streams and numberless vineyards. The capital was of the same name, but the Badakhshan (or Gukchah) river was, as already said, known as the Dirgham by the Arabs. For the position of Badakhshan city no Itinerary that has come down to us gives information; but it seems probable, seeing the inaccessible nature of most of the country, that it stood in the valley where the present capital of the country, Fayzabad, now stands. Badakhshan was from the earliest times famed for its precious stones, especially for the balas rubies and for the lapis-lazuli found at the Lazward mines 2 . Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century states that at the jewel mines was a fort, built by Zubaydah, the wife of Harun-ar-Rashid, and called after her. Besides the ruby, the balas, and lapis-lazuli, the pure rock crystal of Badakhshan was famous, also the bezoar stone. Asbestos was also found here, called by the Arabs Hajar-al-Fatilah, 'wick-stone,' for, 1 I. R. 92, 93. I. K. 33. I. F. 324. 1st. 277, 296. I. H. 348. Muk. 303. I. S. 25 a, \\b.

Mukaddasi adds that of this asbestos fibre they wove mats for table-covers at meals, and when these got soiled by grease, all that was needed was to bake them for a time in an oven, when they became again perfectly clean. In like manner the asbestos lamp-wicks, when clotted with oil, were made as good as new by being put in the fire for an hour, nor, he adds, did they become consumed thereby. Further Mukaddasi mentions a luminous stone, w T hich in a dark room lighted up all things near it, probably some kind of phos phorescent fluor-spar. Many of these details are repeated by Kazvini, who, among the other precious stones found in Badakhshan, mentions the garnet, 4 a stone like a ruby,' and states that in his day the asbestos stone was supposed by the common people to be formed of the petrified plumes of birds. The chief mines of the Balkhash, or balas ruby, were situated near the city of Yamkan; in the neighbourhood were silver mines, and Abu-l-Fida mentions the city of Jirm, which 4 Ali of Yazd gives as the name of the Badakhshan river. When Timiir invaded Badakhshan in the latter part of the 8th (14th) century the capital was at Kishm, where the king of Badakhshan resided; and one of the chief towns was called Kalatikan, but no description is given of these places, and their positions are uncertain. East of Badakhshan, along the upper Oxus, lay Wakhkhan, described by Ibn Hawkal as on the road into (Little) Tibet, whence came musk. These were infidel lands, and they adjoined the countries called As-Sakinah and Karran (or Karram); and beyond these again towards Kashmir was the Buliir country, 4 where for three months you never see the sun for snow and rain.' The silver mines of Wakhkhan were famous in the 4th (10th) century, and gold was found in the beds of its streams. The slave caravans from central Asia came down through this country bringing captured slaves to Khurasan for the Moslem markets of the West 1 . As already said, the largest affluent of the Oxus was the Wakhshab, coming in on the right bank from the north, and the 1 1st. 278, 279, 297. I. H. 327, 349. Muk. 303. Kaz. ii. 203, 225, 328. A.

[CHAP. great mountainous tract lying in the angle between the Wakhshab and the Oxus was known as Khuttal, a name that was also vaguely applied to all the infidel lands east and north of Khurasan 1 . Khuttal included the country called Wakhsh, lying in its northern parts, where the Wakhshab took its rise. It was, Istakhri writes, very fertile, and famous for its fine horses and sumpter beasts; having many great towns on the banks of its numerous streams, where corn lands and fruit orchards gave abundant crops. In the 4th (icth) century the capital of Khuttal was Hulbuk, where the Sultan lived (probably near the site of modern Khulab); but the two cities called Munk and Halaward were larger than Hulbuk. Other considerable towns were Andijaragh (or Anda- jaragh) and Farghan (or Farghar), lying respectively on the rivers of these names; also Tamliyat and Lawakand, which last was on the Wakhshab below the Stone Bridge (near modern Kurgan Tappah). Mukaddasi describes Hulbuk, the capital, as having a Friday Mosque in its midst, and standing on the Akhshawa river, from which it took its water. The town of Andijaragh lay near the Oxus bank, where the affluent of the same name came in, and it probably occupied the site of the present Kal'ah Wamar. Munk, the largest city of the province, lay to the north of Hulbuk, and east of Tamliyat; while Halaward, on the Wakhshab, was, according to Mukaddasi, a finer town than Hulbuk the capital. Tamliyat lay between Munk and the Stone Bridge of the Wakhshab, and is probably identical with the present Baljuwan; Baljuwan being already mentioned by AH of Yazd when describing the campaigns of Timur 2 . The celebrated Stone Bridge (Kantarah-al-Hijarah) over the Wakhshab still exists. It is described by Ibn Rustah, Istakhri, There is much confusion in the naming of this country j we have indiffer ently Khuttal and Khutlan or Khuttalan. According, however, to Kazvini 0^* 35 2 ) Khuttalan was the name of a town of the 1 nrks, lying in a gorge between the mountains, the position of which he does not indicate. 'Alt of Yazd (i. 464, and elsewhere), in describing the campaigns of Tlmur, generally writes Khutlan. The name Khuttal (with its variants) appears in fact to be the same word as Haytal, by which name the Arabs knew the Ephthalites or AVhi^e Huns of Sassanian and Byzantine times. 2 1st. 276, 277, 279, 296, 297.

To the north of this lay the country called Bilad-al-Kamidh by Ibn Rustah, beyond which again was the Rasht district at the head waters of the Wakhshab. The Stone Bridge, according to Istakhri, spanned a deep gorge of the Wakhsh river, at a place where, by reason of the great volume of the stream, more water, it was said, was hemmed in by narrows than at any other known spot on any other river. Kazvini and other writers give a like account, and ^Ali of Yazd also refers to the bridge, giving both the Persian form, Piil-i-Sangin, and the Turkish, Tash Ktipruk. The place has more than once been described by modern travellers 1 . To the westward of the Wakhsh river, and bounded on the south by the Oxus, lay the district the Arabs named Saghaniyan, which in Persian is written Chaghaniyan. The eastern part of the district was more particularly known as Kubadhiyan, from the city of this name w T hich stands on the first river joining the Oxus to the westward of the Wakhshab. Kubadhiyan, or Kuwadhiyan, is described by Ibn Hawkal as a smaller town than Tirmidh, and it was known also under the name of Fazz. It was famous for its madder, which was exported to India. The Kubadhiyan river, on which the town lay, is of considerable length, and according to Mukaddasi there were several important towns in this district, one of which was Awzaj or Uzaj, probably the present Aywaj, on the northern bank of the Oxus above Tirmidh, and below Rubat Milah of the left bank. YaMt adds that the fruits of this district were famous. On the upper waters of the Kubadhiyan river, and west of the Stone Bridge, lay Washjird, a town according to Istakhri that almost equalled Tirmidhf in size; and some distance to 1 i.

At the present day the Stone Bridge is described as only ten paces in length, and is abutted on two projecting rocks.

[chap. ^ the south of it was the great fortress of Shfiman, or Ash-Shtiman. In all this district round Shtiman much saffron was grown for export. Shtiman is referred to by Mukaddasi as extremely populous, and the town was well built; Yakiit adding that its population was ever in revolt against their Sultan, and' that in his day it was a frontier fortress against the Turks. 'All of Yazd, describing the conquests of Timtir, frequently mentions it as to® Hisar Shadman, and more shortly as Hisar, or Hisarak, and at the 0 present day it is also known as Hisar 1 . (1221 Saghaniyan city is probably identical with the modern town of Sar-i-Asya, on the upper part of the Saghaniyan river, which was also called the Nahr Zamil. It was, Istakhn writes, a larger city than Tirmidh, in the 4th (10th) century, though the latter was more wealthy and populous. Saghaniyan city was defended by a great Kuhandiz, or fort, and it stood on both banks of the river. Mukaddasi likens it to Ramlah in Palestine, and there was a great Friday Mosque in its market-place. Wild-fowl abounded in its neighbourhood, and 6000 villages were counted in its districts, excellent bread being cheap throughout the neighbourhood. The small town of Basand, with a great public square and many gardens, lay two marches from Saghaniyan city, among the mountains higher up the river. Lower down the Zamil, about half-way between Saghaniyan and Tirmidh, lay Darzanji, where there was a great guard-house, according to Ibn Hawkal. Excel lent wool-stuffs were produced here, and there was a great Friday Mosque in the market-place. South of this again, also near the Zamil river, was the town of Sarmanji or Sarmanjan, likewise with ll a its great guard-house. The place had been famous in the 4th (10th) century for a dole of bread, of the daily value of a dinar (10 shillings), which was given by its governor, Abu-l-Hasan, son of Hasan Mah. The most important town, however, of the Saghaniyan district was Tirmid (or At-Tirmidh), north of the passage of the Oxus coming from Balkh, and at the place of junction of the Zamil river. In the 4th (10th) century it was defended by a great fortress, where 1 1st. 298. I. h. 350. Muk. 284, 289, 290. Yak. ii. 88; iii. 337; iv. 196. A.

A Friday Mosque of unburnt brick stood in the market place of the town, but the market buildings w^ere built of kiln- bricks, and the main streets were also paved with the same material. Tirmidh was the great emporium of the trade coming from the north for Khurasan. The city had three gates, and according to Mukaddasi was strongly fortified. In the year 617 (1220) it was sacked by the Mongol hordes as they passed south into Khurasan. After this a new town—as large as the old one, according to Ibn Battitah, who visited it in the following century—was built two miles above the deserted ruins, and this was soon surrounded by gardens which grew excellent grapes and quinces. On the right bank of the Oxus, some distance below Tirmidh, was Nawidah, where those who went from Balkh to Samarkand direct crossed the river. Nawidah had a Friday Mosque in the midst of its houses, and was counted as the last town in Saghaniyan on the Oxus. One march north-west of Tirmidh, on the road to Kish and Nakhshab in Sughd, was the town of Hashimjird, a place of some importance in the 4th (10th) century; and two marches north of this the road passed through the famous Iron Gate. This defile in the mountains was described by the Chinese traveller, Hwen Thsang, who as a Buddhist pilgrim visited India in 629 a.d. 1 The Arab geographers speak of a town here, and Ya%tibi names it the City of the Iron Gate (Madinah Bab-al- Hadid), of which he also gives the Persian form, Dar Ahanin. Istakhn, Ibn Hawkal, and Mukaddasi all name the Bab-al-Hadid in their itineraries, but add no details. Under the name, in Persian, of the Darband, Ahanin the Iron Gate became famous from the time of Timiir, and it is mentioned by 4 All of Yazd also under the Turkish appellation of Kuhlughah. He gives, however, 1 For a translation of Hwen Thsang's description see Sir H. Yule in Wood, The Oxus, p. Ixix. The Chinese pilgrim states that in his day the passage was Closed by folding gates clamped with iron, and to the gates were attached a number of iron bells. 5 All later accounts omit any mention of gates, which apparently had been removed before the time of Istakhri.442 THE OXUS. [CHAP. no description of the place. This remarkable defile was traversed by Clavijo, the Spanish ambassador to the court of Ttmtir, in August, a.d. 1405. He states that the ravine looked 'as if it had been artificially cut, and the hills rise to a great height on either side, and the pass is smooth, and very deep. In the centre of the pass there is a village, and the mountain rises to a great height behind. This pass is called the Gates of Iron, and in all the mountain range there is no other pass, so that it guards the land of Samarkand in the direction of India. These Gates of Iron produce a large revenue to Timflr, for all merchants who come from India pass this way 1 .' The Oxus below the Saghaniyan district took its course through the desert, receiving no important affluents on either bank, and finally reached its delta on the south shore of the Aral Sea, where lay the province of Khwarizm, which will be described in the next chapter. In the stretch of desert several cities lay upon its right and left banks—generally in couples—at the points where the great river was crossed by roads going from Khurasan to the Turk country, and most of the towns on the Khurasan side have already been mentioned in the preceding chapter. The town of Kalif or Kaylif, on the north bank (which still exists), was in the middle-ages faced by its suburb on the Khurasan side, surrounding the guard-house called Rubat Dhi-l-Kifl and Kalif was therefore at that time counted as occupying both banks of the Oxus, Mukaddasi likening it to Baghdad and Wasit. On the northern side was the guard-house called after Alexander the Great, Rubat Dhi-l-Karnayn. Yakut states that Kalif had a fine castle, it was counted as 18 leagues from Balkh, and was on the road thence to Nakhshab in Sughd. Mustawfi speaks of a great hill near Kalif, eight leagues in circumference, all of black earth, with water and fine grazing lands on its summit, and he adds that Kalif in the 8th (14th) century was a large and very strong place. Below this and opposite Zamm, which has already been 1 Ykb. 290. 1st. 298, 337. I. H. 349, 350, 400, 401. Muk. 283, 284, 291, 292, 342. I. B. ill. 56. A. Y. i. 49, 59; ii. 593. Clavijo, p. 122.

Ibn Hawkal describes Akhsisak as a small city, its inhabitants going over to Zamm for the Friday prayers, for there was no mosque in their town. The surrounding lands, enclosed on all sides by the desert, were extremely fertile, and the pasture for sheep and camels excellent. Near the right bank of the Oxus, lower down again, and opposite Amul or Amtiyah, stood Firabr, on the road to Bukhara, likewise surrounded by a fertile district, and many populous villages. Mukaddasi writes that Firabr was a league distant from the north bank of the Oxus, and that it was protected by a fortress with guard-houses. The Friday Mosque stood at the town gate towards Bukhara, and there was a Musalla, or praying station, with a hostelry outside this where travellers were entertained and a dole given. The grapes of the place were famous. Firabr was also known as Kariyat £ Ali, or Rubat Tahir ibn 'All, the village or guard-house of these persons 1 . After passing between Firabr and Amuyah, the Oxus held its course for about 140 miles, still through the desert, till it reached Tahiriyah, where the cultivated lands of the delta began. From this point the great river took its course to the Aral Sea, throwing off for nearly 300 miles many irrigation canals which watered the rich province known as Khwarizm during the middle-ages. Since the date of the first Arab conquest the Oxus, in these delta lands, has of course frequently shifted its bed, and the bursting of the great dykes at the time of the Mongol invasion in the 7th (13th) century caused a change in its lower course which will be described later. From the description of the earlier Arab geographers, however, it is still possible roughly to reconstruct the map of Khwarizm in the 4th (10th) century, and it is evident that the Oxus in those days followed a single channel, navigable for boats, down to the swamps on the southern shore of the Aral, which sea the Arabs called the Lake of Khwarizm (Buhayrah Khwarizm). The Aral, which was shallow and full of reeds, appears not 1 1st. 298, 314. I. H. 349, 350, 363. Kud. 203. Muk. 291. Yak, iii. 862; iv. 229. Mst. 189. I m iii444 THE OXUS. [CHAP. to have been considered navigable; it received on its north eastern shore the waters of the Jaxartes, but no traffic passed from the Oxus by water to the sister river. The land bordering the eastern coast of the Aral, between the mouths of the Oxus and Jaxartes, was in the 4th (10th) century, and later, known as the Desert of the Ghuzz Turkomans, a name more often given to the Marv desert of eastern Persia. To the earlier Arab geo graphers the wonder of the Oxus and Jaxartes was the fact that both these rivers froze over in winter, so that caravans of heavily laden beasts could cross on the surface of the river ice, which remained fast frozen, they reported, for from two to five of the winter months, the thickness of the ice reaching five spans and more. Kazvini explains further how in winter the people of Khwarizm had to dig wells through the ice with crowbars till the water below was reached, and the cattle were brought up to drink at these holes, water being carried home to the houses in great jars. Istakhri mentions a hill called Jabal Jaghraghaz, on the Aral Lake shore, below which the water remained frozen all the year through. The Aral Sea, especially in its southern part and near the creek of Khalijan where the Oxus flowed in, was famous as fishing ground, but there were no villages or even houses bordering on the lake shore. As already said, all down the course of the Oxus through the delta, great and small canals branched from the right and left bank of the river, and many of these canals were also navigable; their waters finally serving to irrigate the delta lands. On one or other of these canals most of the great towns of Khwarizm had been built, rather than on the Oxus bank, which from the constant shifting of its bed was a source of ever recurring danger. The Oxus was navigable for boats throughout the whole of its lower course, and Ibn BatCitah says that during the summer months the passage down stream from Tirmidh could be accomplished in ten days, cargoes of wheat and barley being thus brought for sale to the Ivhwarizm markets. The ice in winter made the navigation dangerous or impossible, and Yakdt relates how in Shawwal 616 (December 1219), when going from Marv to Jurjaniyah, part of his voyage being by boat on the Jayhfin, heXXXI] THE OXUS. 445 and his companions came near perishing from the intense cold and the sudden freezing of the river.

Kath still exists, but the great medieval city probably stood some miles to the south-east of the modern town. In the earlier part of the 4th (10th) century Kath came to be in part destroyed by the flood of the Oxus, which at this spot was two leagues in width. The city stood some distance back from the right bank of the main stream, being on a canal called the Jardur, which ran through the town—the market, for about a mile in length, bordering this canal. Kath, in these earlier times, had also possessed a fortress (Kuhandiz), which the floods had completely destroyed, and here had been the Friday Mosque and the prison, also the palace of the native chief known as the Khwarizm-Shah. All this quarter of the town, however, had been rendered uninhabitable by the floods when Ibn Hawkal wrote, and a new town had recently been built to the eastward, at a sufficient distance from the Oxus to be safe from the encroach ments of the river. L i-iv The new city, which Mukaddasi states was known as theCHAP. XXXII] KHWARIZM. 447 Shahristan—'the Capital'—by the Persians, was almost, he says, of the size of Naysabur in Khurasan. In its market-place stood the Friday Mosque, built with columns of black stone, each of a man's height, and above came wooden pillars supporting the beams of the roof. The governor's palace was rebuilt in the new town, the old fortress being left a ruin. Numerous small canals traversed the streets, which says Mukaddasi were infamously filthy —worse than Ardabil in Adharbayjan, for the people used the roadway for their commodity, and even brought the foulness of the gutters into the mosque on their feet when they came to prayers. The markets, however, were rich and well-stored with all kinds of merchandise, and the town architects were very skilful in their buildings, so that Kath was outwardly a magnificent city. Soon after the close of the 4th (10th) century, however, it appears to have rapidly lost its position as the chief capital of Khwarizm; probably by reason of the recurrently destructive Oxus floods, which ever and anon threw down different quarters of the city; and eventually it sank to be a town of secondary rank. Coming down to the beginning of the 7th (13th) century, Kath does not appear to have suffered much during the Mongol invasion, and in the 8th (14th) century Ibn Batiitah, who writes the name Al-Kat, passed through it on his way from Urganj to Bukhara, and describes it as a small but flourishing place. There was here a tank, and this at the time of his visit being frozen over, he describes the boys of the town as playing on its surface. At the close of the 8th (14th) century Timtlr almost destroyed Kath, but afterwards caused its walls to be rebuilt, and the place is frequently mentioned by 'Ali of Yazd as still in his day an important town 1 . The second capital of Khwarizm which, after the decay of Kath, became the chief city of the province, was Gurganj, by the Arabs called Al-Jurjaniyah, and at a later date known as Urganj. The chronicles of the Moslem conquest relate that in the year 93 (712), when the Arabs under Kutaybah invaded Khwarizm, the capital city which they conquered was called Al-Fil, 'the Elephant,' a name which was forthwith changed 1 1st. 300, 301.

This city is said to have stood on the further side of the Oxus, and over against the later Jurjaniyah, but the Oxus flood before long overwhelmed Mansiarah, and Jurjaniyah succeeded to its place 1 . Jurjaniyah in the 4th (10th) century—though at that time only the second city of the province, Kath being still the capital—was already the chief centre of trade, and the meeting-place of caravans coming from the Ghuzz country, which exchanged goods with those from Khurasan. Jurjaniyah lay a bow-shot to the westward of a great navigable canal coming from the Oxus and running a nearly parallel course, and the houses were protected from danger of flood by an immense dyke, with wooden piles to strengthen the embankment. Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century states that the city had four gates, and that it was every day increasing in size. At the Bab-al-Hujjaj, ' the Pilgrims' Gate,' stood a fine palace built by the Caliph Mamun, with a second palace fronting it, built by Prince 'Ali his son, both overlooking a sandy square, like the famous Rigistan of Pmkhara, where the sheep-market was held. With the decay of Kath, Jurjaniyah soon became the first, and then the sole capital of the Khwarizm province, and in later times it is generally referred to under the name of Khwarizm—'City' being understood. In the year 616 (1219) Yakut was at Jurjaniyah, or Gurganj as he also calls it, shortly before the place was devastated by the Mongols under Changiz Khan; and he writes that he had never seen a mightier city, or one more wealthy or more beautiful. In 617 (1220) all this was changed to ruin. The great canal dykes having been broken down, the waters of the Oxus flowed off by a new course, as will be shown later, and the whole city was laid under water. The Mongol hordes when they marched away left nothing, according to Yakut, but corpses and the ruined walls of houses to mark the place of the great city. The capital of Khwarizm, however, in a few years rose from its ruins, rebuilt in a neighbouring spot. This, according to the contemporary chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir, was in 628 (1231), when New Khwarizm was founded 'in the vicinity of Great Khwarizm.' Before the 1 The position of Fil is most uncertain ; its name occurs as a mint city on the coins of the Omayyad Caliphs, one example being dated A. H. 79 (698).XXXII] KHWARIZM. 449 Mongol invasion there had existed, according to YaMt and others, a town known as Little Gurganj, by the Persians called Gurganjak, lying at a distance of three leagues from the capital. Great Gurganj, and it seems probable that Little Gurganj was the spot chosen for New Khwarizm. New Khwarizm soon took its place as the capital, and is described by both Mustawfi and Ibn Batiitah in the 8th (14th) century. Kazvini, who wrote in the latter half of the previous century, states that (New) Gurganj was then famous for its skilful blacksmiths and carpenters, also for its carvers of ivory and ebony bowls and other utensils, like those produced by the people of Tark near Isfahan. Further, the women here made famous em broideries, and the tailors w T ere renowned. The water-melons of Khwarizm, he relates, were beyond compare, and this latter fact is confirmed by Ibn Batiitah. Mustawfi, who gives the common name of the city as Urganj, otherwise New Khwarizm, says that it lay ten leagues (probably a mistake for miles) from Old Urganj. Ibn Battitah, his contem porary, found Khwarizm (as he calls the place) a fine town, well-built, with broad streets, and a teeming population. The market was a magnificent building, like a caravanserai, and near it was the Friday Mosque with its college. Also there was a public hospital, attended, when Ibn Batiitah was here, by a Syrian physician, a native of Sahiytln. Near the close of the 8th (14th) century this city of Khwarizm was again almost completely destroyed by Timiir, after a siege lasting three months. Timur, however, caused it afterwards to be rebuilt, and the work was completed in 790 (1388). Abu-l-Ghazi, the prince of Khwarizm, whose account of the lower Oxus course will be given presently, held his court at the beginning of the 11th (17th) century in this city, which he generally names Urganj, and speaks of as a fine place with many gardens ^ but after this date the town of Khivah gradually replaced Urganj, becoming the new capital of the province. The ruins of this Urganj, the town built after the Mongol invasion, are those now known as Old Urganj (Kuhnah Urganj) 1 . 1 Anthony Jenkinson was at Urgence (as he spells the name) in 966 (1558), half-a-century before the time of Abu-l-Ghazi, and describes it as a fine tow n L e S. 2 945° KHWARIZM. [CHAP. Khivah—which under the Uzbeg chiefs after the time of Timiir gradually eclipsed Urganj and became the capital of Khwarizm, giving its name in time also to the whole province —is more than once mentioned as a small town by the Arab geographers of the 4th (10th) century. The older spelling of the name was Khivak, and this form was in common use down to the time of Yakut. Mukaddasi describes Khivah as lying on the border of the desert, but watered by a great canal which was brought to it from the left bank of the Oxus. It had a fine public square, also a Friday Mosque, so that in the 4th (10th) century it must already have been a place of some importance. Yakftt, who says the name was also pronounced Khayvak, speaks of its castle. In the 7th (13th) century its people were all Sunnis of the Shafi £ ite sect, the rest of the population of Khwarizm following the Hanifite ritual. At this date Khivah was already celebrated as the birth-place of the great Shaykh Najm-ad-Din, surnamed Al-Kubra. He played a foremost part in the defence of Urganj against the Mongols, who put him to death, and his tomb became a place of pious visitation near Urganj, as is described by Ibn Battitah in the century after his martyrdom. Khivah is mentioned by Aii of Yazd, and he describes an adventure here of Timur, when a young man, who at a later period caused the walls of Khivak (as the name was then spelt) to be rebuilt. The city in the nth (17th) century is frequently mentioned by Abu-l-Ghazi, who sometimes lived here, as also at Kat (or Kath), when not in residence at Urganj; and since his day, and down to the present time, the place has continued to rise in importance, being now the capital of the province called after it K Hazarasp (meaning c Hundred-horse ? in Persian) on the same latitude as Khivah, but standing nearer to the left bank of the Oxus, is a place of importance that has kept its name unchanged from with walls c by estimation four miles about it. 5 Hakluyt, Principal Navigations (Glasgow, 1903), ii. 463.

Mukaddasi in the 4th (10th) century describes it as of the same size as Khivah, the town having wooden gates and being surrounded by a ditch. Yaktit, who was here in 616 (1219), speaks of it as a strongly fortified and rich town, with excellent markets, where many opulent merchants had their warehouses. Hazarasp was almost surrounded by the waters of its canals, and was only to be reached by a single road, along a causeway coming from the Urganj direction across the level plain which stretched away from the Oxus bank. About half-way between Tahiriyah, where the cultivation of the delta began, and Hazarasp, the stream of the Oxus passed through a narrow gorge, now known as the Deveh Boyun, 'the Camel's Neck/ where high and precipitous cliffs hemmed in the current to a third of its normal breadth. Istakhri calls these narrows by the name of Abtikshah, or BUkshah, adding that the Oxus boatmen feared the spot greatly, on account of the whirlpool and the cataract at the exit of the passage. Mustawfi, who calls this place Tang-i-Dahan-i-Shir, £ the Narrows of the Lion's Mouth,' says the opposite cliffs were barely 100 gez (yards) apart, and there was a guard-house here, on the left bank. Below this, according to him, the Oxus passed by an underground course for a couple of leagues, being completely hidden from sight. Between Tahiriyah and Hazarasp, on the left bank of the Oxus, there were three towns of some importance during the middle-ages. One march below Tahiriyah, and on the high road, stood Jikarband, surrounded by gardens, with trees growing along its canals. A fine mosque, according to Mukaddasi, stood in the midst of its market. A march further north, near the narrows of the Oxus, was the city of Darghan, which Mukaddasi de scribes as almost of the size of Jurjamyah. Its Friday Mosque was magnificently ornamented with precious marbles, and the town was two leagues across, being surrounded by nearly five hundred vineyards. Darghan was the first great town in Khwarizm on the road from Marv. Yaktit, having been here in 616 (1219), describes it as standing on an elevation like the spur of a hill, with its gardens and arable fields stretching between the town and the Oxus bank, which was two miles distant. At the 29—2452 KHWARIZM. [CHAP. back of the town the desert sands were not far distant. Between Darghan and Hazarasp lay Sadur on the river bank, a fortified town with a Friday Mosque in its midst, and surrounded by suburbs 1 . The first of the great canals of Khwarizm was taken from the right or eastern bank of the Oxus at a spot opposite Darghan, and was called Gavkhuwarah, or Gavkhwarah, the 'Cattle Feeder.' This canal, which was navigable for boats, being two fathoms deep and five fathoms across, went northwards, and irrigated all the lands up to the level of Kath. Five leagues beyond its point of origin a small canal branched off from it, called the Karih canal, and this too watered many districts. Four towns of some importance are mentioned by Mukaddasi as of this eastern bank of the Oxus, each standing about a day's march one from the other, in the fertile districts south of Kath. The most distant from Kath was called Nfikfagh, it stood in the midst of canals, was a fine town, and lay near the desert border. Nearer to Kath was Ardha- khivah, which is probably identical with the place called Hisn Khivah by Yakut, and which he says was 15 leagues distant from Khivah of the west bank. Ardhakhivah was a fortress standing under a hill at the beginning of the desert, and having but a single gate. Wayikhan, also a fortress, surrounded by a ditch and with catapults at its gate, lay one march again to the northward; and then came Ghardaman, one march from Kath, a well-fortified place with two gates, encompassed by a great water ditch two bow-shots in width. From the west, or left bank of the Oxus a number of canals were also taken, the first of which was that which was led past Hazarasp to irrigate its district. This also was navigable for boats, though it was only half the size of the Gavkhuwarah canal; and it led backward, curving round in a direction that, if continued, would have reached the city of Amul. Two leagues north of Hazarasp the Karduran-Khwash canal branched from the Oxus, flowing past the town so named, which stood half-way between Hazarasp and Khivah. This canal was larger than that which served Hazarasp, and the town of Karduran-Khas (as Mukaddasi 1 1st. 304. I. H. 354. Muk. 288, 289. Yak. ii. 567; iv. 971. Mst. 198, 213.I writes the name) was surrounded by a ditch and had wooden gates. Further north again was the Nahr Khivah, a still larger canal, by which boats went from the Oxus to that city. A fourth canal, flowing a mile to the northward of the Khivah canal, was the Nahr Madra, which is described as twice as large as the Gavkhuwarah of the east bank. The town and neighbourhood of Madra were watered by it. Kath, the eastern capital, as already said, stood back from the Oxus on a canal called the Jardilr, which was taken from the main stream some distance to the south of the city. Two leagues north of Kath, but from the left or western bank of the Oxus, the great Wadhak (also Wadak or Wadan) canal branched off, which was navigable up to the neighbourhood of Jurjaniyah, the western capital of Khwarizm. The point of origin of the Wadak canal was about a mile to the northward of that of the Madra canal, and further north again another canal called the Nahr Buwwah (Buh or Btiyah) left the Oxus, its waters rejoining those of the Wadak beyond to the north-west, a bow-shot distant from the village called Andarastan, and about one day's march to the southward of Jurjaniyah. The Wadak canal was larger than the Btih, but both were navigable as far as Jurjaniyah, where a dam prevented boats proceeding further northward; and a great dyke, as already said, had originally been built along its bank to keep the city from inundation \ The high road north from Khivah to Jurjaniyah, in the middle-ages, passed through several large towns of which now no trace exists. One march from Khivah was Ardhakhushmithan, or Rakhiishmithan, which Yakut, who stayed here in 616 (1219), records as being a large city, with fine markets and much mer chandise. It was, he says, more populous and more extensive than the city of Nasibm, in Upper Mesopotamia, but it appears to have been ruined by the Mongol invasion. North of this was Riizvand, a medium-sized town according to Mukaddasi, well fortified and surrounded by a ditch. It had excellent springs of water, and the Friday Mosque stood in its market place. After passing the village of Andarastan, lying at the 1 1st. 301, 302. I. H. 352, 353. Muk. 288, 289, 292, 293. Yak. ii. 512; iv. 230.454 KHWARIZM. [CHAP. junction of the Wadak and Btih canals, the town of Nfizvar was reached, one march south of Jurjaniyah. Mukaddasi describes Nuzvar as a small well-fortified city, having two iron gates, and surrounded by a ditch crossed by drawbridges, which were taken up at night, being laid on boats. There was a Friday Mosque in its market-place; and without the west gate was a fine bath-house. It is apparently the same town which Yakflt calls Nuzkath, meaning, he says, 'New Kath,' or 'New Wall,' and which was utterly destroyed, shortly after he left it, by the Mongol hordes. Zamakhshar lay between Nuzvar and Jurjaniyah, and in the 4th (icth) century this town had also drawbridges at its gates. There was a Friday Mosque here, and a strong prison, and it was fortified, having iron gates and a ditch. Yakflt in the 7th (r3th) century speaks of this place as a village, and it became famous as the birth-place of one of the great commentators of the Kuran, Az-Zamakhshari, who was born here in 467 (1075) and died in 538 (1144). Ibn Batiitah, who visited his tomb here in the 8th (14th) century, speaks of Zamakhshar as lying four miles from New Urganj. To the north of Urganj was the shrine of Najm-ad- Din Kubra already spoken of, and beyond this again, five leagues from Jurjctniyah on the desert border, under the tall cliffs to the west of the Oxus, stood Jith or Git, a place often mentioned by the earlier geographers. It was a large town with considerable , lands round it, lying at some distance from the left bank of the river, being opposite Madhmimyah at four leagues from the right bank. Jith appears to be identical in position with the later town called Wazir (or Shahr-i-Wazir), which probably replaced it, after the troublous times of the Mongol invasion and the campaigns of Timur. Wazir is frequently mentioned by Abu-1- Ghazi, and the name occurs in the Jahan This Shahr-i- Wazir, moreover, is probably the town visited and described by Anthony Jenkinson under the somewhat altered form of or Shay sure, when he was travelling across Khwarizm in the 10th {16th) century 1 . On the right bank of the Oxus, some four leagues north of Kathj the first of four canals led off, flowing northward, and 1 1st. 301. I. H. 352. Muk. 289. Yak. i. 191; ii. 940; iv. 822. I. B. iii. 6.

It was said that this, which was of the size of the Wadak and Btih canals of the west bank, had originally been an arm of the Oxus, and had flowed out to the north-east into the Aral. The district in the angle between the main stream of the Oxus and the Kurdar canal was called Mazdakhgan (or Mazdakhkan), and it was watered by numerous minor channels taken from the right bank of the Oxus. The district is said to have comprised twelve thousand villages, and Kurdar was its chief town. This is described by Mukaddasi as a large place and very strong; surrounded by numerous villages, wdth broad pasture lands for cattle. Two days' march from it, on the north-eastern border of Khwarizm, was the great village called Kariyat Baratakin (or Faratagin), near which were the hill-quarries producing the stone used in the buildings throughout Khwarizm. Baratakin in the 4th (10th) century had excellent markets, and a well-built Friday Mosque. To the westward of this place was the city of Madhminiyah, four leagues from the right bank of the Oxus, opposite Jith ; and from hence down to the shore of the Sea of Aral there were no more cultivated lands, only swamps and reed beds lying at the mouth of the great river 1 . In the 4th century B.C., when Alexander the Great made his conquests in western Asia, the Oxus is described as flowing into. the Caspian, and the Greek geographers apparently knew nothing of the Aral Sea. When the change of course from the Caspian to the Aral took place is not known, but though at the present day the Oxus, like the Jaxartes, flows into the Sea of Aral, its old bed to the Caspian still exists, is marked on our maps, and has been recently explored. In the earlier middle-ages the course of the Oxus, as described by the Arab geographers of the 4th (10th) century, is, in the main, that of the present day; but the old bed of the river leading to the Caspian is mentioned by Mukaddasi, who reports that in former times the main stream had flowed down to a town over against Nisa in Khurasan, called Balkhan (or Abu-l-Khan). Later, some two and a half centuries after the time of Mukaddasi, it seems certain that the Oxus once 1 1st. 299, 303. I. H. 350, 353. Muk. 288. Yak. iv. 257.456 KHWARIZM. [CHAP. again resumed its older course. This we learn from the con temporary Persian authors. Hence there appears to be unim peachable evidence that, from the early part of the 7th (13th) century to near the close of the 10th (16th) century, the Oxus, except for a moiety of its waters which still passed into the Aral by the canals, reached the Caspian along the old bed of the time of Alexander the Great, though at the present day, and since the end of the 1 oth (16th) century, this channel is once more disused and for the most part dry. As has been mentioned above the chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir states that the Mongol hordes in 617 (1220), in order finally to capture Urganj, after a five months' siege broke down the dykes and overwhelmed the city with the waters of the Oxus and its canals, which hitherto had flowed by divers channels to the east ward of the town. The whole country was laid under water^ and the overflow after a time began to drain off to the south-west, filling the old bed of the Oxus, and following the line of depression to the Caspian at Mankishlagh. The latter Yakilt, a contemporary of these events, speaks of as a strongly fortified castle standing on the shore of the Sea of Tabaristan (the Caspian), into which, he says, the Jayhun (the Oxus) flowed. This evidence from incidental notices is further fully corroborated by Mustawfi in the 8th (14th) century, who, in describing the course of the Oxus, states that though a small portion of its waters still drained off through canals from the right bank to the Aral Sea, the main stream after passing Old Urganj turned down the passage called the Steep of Halam, where the noise of its cataract could be heard two leagues away, and thence flowing on for a distance of six days' march, had its exit in the Caspian (Bahr Khazar) at Khalkhal, a fishing station. The position of the 'Akabah or Steep of Halam^ which the Turks, Mustawfi says, called Kurlavah (or Kurladi), is given by him in his Itinerary, for the town of New Halam stood about half-way between Old Urganj, destroyed by the Mongols in the previous century, and New Urganj which had taken its place. In his article on the Caspian Mustawfi further adds, when speaking of the port on the Island of Abaskiin (see p. 379), that this island had in his time disappeared beneath the sea 4 becauseXXXII] KHWARIZM. 457 the Jayhun, which formerly did flow into the Eastern Lake [the Aral] lying over against the lands of Gog and Magog, since the time of the Mongol invasion has changed its course and now flows out to the Sea of Khazar [the Caspian]; and hence, this latter sea having no outlet, the dry land [of the Abask^n island] has now become submerged in the rising level of its waters.' All the above is confirmed by the account of the Oxus written in 820 (1417) by Haflz Abril, who was a government official of Shah Rukh, son and successor of Timur, and who must have been well acquainted with the geography of this region from personal knowledge. In two distinct places he writes that, in the year just mentioned, the Oxus, which of old had discharged into the Lake of Khwarizm (the Aral), having taken a new channel, now flowed down by Kurlavti, otherwise called Akranchah, to the Sea of Khazar (the Caspian), adding that the Aral Sea in his time had come almost to disappear. And again, Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, the Spanish ambassador who visited these regions in 808 (1405) some years before Hafiz Abru wrote his account, confirms this by his statement that the Oxus 4 flows into the Sea of BaM/ which can only mean the Caspian. It must be admitted, however, that Clavijo here spoke from hearsay only. What caused the Oxus once more to discharge into the Aral Sea is unknown, but this great change must have taken place before the close of the 10th (16th) century, for Abu-l-Ghazi, a native of Urganj, refers to it as though it had become an accomplished fact in 984 (1576), namely some thirty years before he, Abu-l-Ghazi, was born. The Oxus had, he says, at that date already made itself a new channel, and turning off below Khast Minarahsi (the Tower of Khast), took its way direct to the Aral Sea, thus changing the lands lying between Urganj and the Caspian into a desert for lack of water. And in another passage of his work speaking of former times, among events of the years 928 to 937 ( I 5 22 t0 I 53 I )» he describes how all the way from Urganj to Abu-l-Khan on the Caspian there were arable fields and vineyards along what was still then the course of the lower Oxus. Appar-. ently, however, Abu-l-Ghazi places the change of bed rather too late, for already in 966 (1558), when Anthony Jenkinson travelled through Russia to Khivah, he speaks of the Oxus as458 KHWARIZM. [CHAP. flowing 4 not into the Caspian Sea as it hath done in times past/ for when he saw it the great river already took its course to the Aral Sea, 'the Lake of Kithay,' direct 1 . The chief products of Khwarizm were food-stuffs, cereals, and fruits. The land was extremely fertile and grew large crops of cotton, and the flocks of sheep gave wool. Great herds of cattle pastured on the marshlands near the Aral, and many kinds of cheese and curds were exported. The markets of Jurjaniyah were famous for the various costly furs, brought here from the Bulghar country of the Volga, and a long list of these is given by Mukaddasi and others. This list comprises the following skins; marten, sable, fox, and beaver of two kinds, as well as the furs of the squirrel, ermine, stoat and weasel, which were made up into pelisses and short jackets; also artificially dyed hareskins and goatskins, and the hide of the wild ass. 1 Muk. 285.

Professor De Goeje in Das Alte Bett des Oxus (Leyden, 1875) seeks to discredit the statements of the Persian geographers, and holds that during all the middle-ages the Oxus, as at the present day, flowed into the Aral. The evidence showing that a portion, at any rate, of the Oxus current flowed down the old bed to the Caspian, during more than three centuries, appears to be irrefutable ; and it may be added that the late Sir H. C. Rawlinson, who had studied the question as a practical geographer, and knew at first hand the writings of the Arab and Persian authorities, always maintained the opinion that during those several centuries the Oxus did undoubtedly flow into the Caspian. It should be stated that some confusion has arisen from the divers names by which the Moslem geographers denote the Caspian and the Aral. The Caspian is generally referred to as the Sea of Khazar (Bahr Khazar), from the tribes of the Khazars who inhabited its further shores, but it was also known as the Sea of Tabaristan or of Mazandaran, or of Abaskun, or of Jurjan, from the names of the various well-known provinces or districts on its shores. Quite incorrectly the Caspian appears sometimes as the Darya Kulzum, but Kulzum was the name given to the Red Sea. The Aral was generally known as the Buhayrah Khwarizm, or Lake of Khwarizm, and also as the Lake of Jurjaniyah (the capital of Khwarizm), and this last name being easily misread Jurjan has more especially caused confusion between the Caspian (Bahr Jurjan) and the Aral (Buhayrah Jurjaniyah). The Aral was also known to the Persian geographers as the Darya-i-Shark, 4 the Eastern Sea.' All this, however, does not invalidate the facts clearly recorded by Mustawfi, Hafiz Abrfi, and Abu-l-Ghazi.XXXII] KHWARIZM. 459 Among natural and manufactured products were wax, the bark of the white poplar, called Ttiz, used for covering shields, fish-glue, fish-bones, amber, khalanj-wood, honey, and hazel-nuts, swords, and cuirasses and bows. Khwarizm also was celebrated for its falcons. Grapes, currants, and sesame were largely grown, and in the looms carpets, coverlets, and brocades of mixed cotton and silk were woven. Cloaks and veils of both cotton and silk stuffs were exported, and various coloured cloths. Locks were of the smith-work of the towns, and they had boats hollowed out of a single tree-trunk, which were used in the navigation of the numerous canals. The chief industry of Khwarizm, however, in the 4th (icth) century, as latterly, was the slave-trade; for Turkish boys and girls were bought or stolen from the nomads of the steppes, and after being educated and made good Moslems, were despatched from here to all the countries of Islam, where, as history relates, they often came to occupy high posts of command in the Government 1 . 1 1st. 304, 305.

Karminiyah, Dabusiyah, and Rabinjan. Kish and Nasaf, with neighbouring towns. The products of Sughd. Routes beyond the Oxus as far as Samarkand. The province of Sughd, the ancient Sogdiana, may be taken as including the fertile lands, lying between the Oxus and Jaxartes, which were watered by two river systems, namely the Zarafshan, or Sughd river, on which Samarkand and Bukhara stood, and the river which flowed by the cities of Kish and Nasaf. Both these rivers ended in marshes or shallow lakes in the western desert towards Khwarizm. More properly, however, Sughd is the name of the district surrounding Samarkand; for Bukhara, Kish, and Nasaf were each counted as separate districts. Sughd was accounted one of the four earthly paradises, and had attained its greatest splendour in the latter half of the 3rd (9th) century under the Samanid Amirs; in the following century, however, it was still a province fertile and rich beyond compare. Of the two chief cities, Samarkand and Bukhara, it may be said that the former was rather the political centre, while Bukhara was considered to be the religious metropolis, but both were equal in rank, and held to be the capitals of Sughd 1 . Bukhara was also known under the name of Niimijkath 2 . In 1 1st. 316. I. H. 365. Muk. 261, 262, 266—268.

XXXIII] SUGHD. 461 the 4th (10th) century it was a walled city measuring a league across in every direction, which stood in the plain a short distance south of the main arm of the river of Sughd. There were no hills in the neighbourhood, and round it lay many towns, palaces, and gardens, gathered into a compass measuring 12 leagues in length and breadth, and enclosed by a Great Wall that must have been over a hundred miles in circuit. Through this great enclosure passed the Sughd river, with its numerous canals. The city proper of Bukhara, outside the wall and to the north west, had adjacent to it the fortress, which itself was like a small city. It was the residence of the governor and held the prison and the treasury. Beyond and round the town also were great suburbs, extending as far as the main arm of the river, and along its southern bank. Of the suburbs the chief were those lying to the east, namely the thoroughfares {darb) of Naw Bahar, of Samarkand, and of Ramithanah, with others too numerous to mention, whose position cannot now be exactly fixed. The town wall had seven iron gates; Bab-al-Madinah (the City Gate), Bab Nur (or Nllz), Bab Hufrah, the Iron Gate, the Gate of the Fortress, Bab Mihr or the Bani Asad Gate^ and lastly the Gate of the Bani Sa'd. How these were situated is unknown, but the Gate of the Fortress (Bab-al-Kuhandiz) must have been to the north-west, opening on the Rigistan, the great sandy plain or public square of Bukhara which has ever been famous. The two gates of the fortress were the Bab-ar-Rigistan, or Bab-as-Sahl, ^the Gate of the (Sandy) Plain/and the Bab-al-Jami', this last opening on the Great Mosque, which also stood on the Rigistan, at the city Gate of the Fortress above mentioned. The suburbs were traversed by ten main thoroughfares, each of which ended in its gateway, and these are all carefully named by both Istakhri and Mukaddasi. Further there were several gates in the streets shutting off the various quarters of the suburbs one from another, many of these gates being of iron. The Great Mosque was near the fortress, and there were numerous smaller mosques, with markets, baths, and open squares beyond count, and at the close of the 4th (10th) century the Government House stood inxmediately outside the fortress in the great square called the462 SUGHD. [CHAP. Rigistan. Ibn Hawkal gives a detailed account of the chief canals which, starting from the left bank of the Sughd river, watered Bukhara and the gardens in the plain round the city, becoming finally lost in the desert towards the south-west, near Baykand on the Amul road, for none of them reached the Oxus. The lower course of the river here was known as the Sam Khas, or Khwash 1 . The ruins of Old Bukhara of pre-Islamic days lie some miles to the north-west of the Moslem city, and near the river bank. They were known by the name of Riyamithan, and Mukaddasi describes them in the 4th (10th) century as still showing immense remains of the ancient city. Within the circuit of the Great Wall round the plain of Bukhara there were five flourishing cities. Of these Khujadah, or Khujada, stood one league west of the high road going down from Bukhara to Baykand, and three leagues distant from the capital. Mukaddasi describes it as a large and pleasant town, with a Friday Mosque and a castle. The town of Maghkan was beyond this, being five leagues from Bukhara, and three from the high road, close to the western circuit of the Great Wall. Maghkan had a Friday Mosque, was fortified, and had suburbs, besides many villages lying round it, for its lands were amply irrigated. Tumujkath, or Tumushkath (often by a clerical error written Bumujkath, and Btimijkath), was a small town to the north-west of Bukhara, four leagues distant, and half a league off the high road to the left of one going to Tawawis. At-Tawawis (as the name was often written) means £ Peacocks,' and this was the largest of the five cities within the Great Wall. The town had a flourishing market and was much frequented by merchants from all parts of Khurasan, its cotton stuffs being exported to £ Irak. It was well fortified and had a castle, and the Friday Mosque stood in the market-place. The last of the five inner towns was Zandanah, which still exists at the present day. It is described as lying four leagues distant from Bukhara, to the north. It was well fortified, had a Friday Mosque in the town, and a populous suburb beyond its walls; and Yaktit adds that the stuffs made here, and called from the town the Zandaji cloths, were widely celebrated. 1 1st. 305—309. I. H. 355—358. Muk. 280, 281. Yak. i. 517.XXXIII] SUGHD, 463 Two leagues outside the Great Wall, and five from Bukhara on the road down to the Oxus at Firabr, was the city of Baykand, which still exists. In the 4th (10th) century Baykand possessed but one gate, and was strongly fortified ; it had a Friday Mosque in its midst, ornamented with precious marbles and with a finely gilded Mihrab (or niche showing the Mecca point). There was a market held in the suburbs of Baykand, but no villages surrounded the town; only numerous guard-houses which are reported to have numbered a thousand all told. Beyond the town lay the sandy desert bordering the Oxus. Throughout the earlier middle-ages Bukhara retained its pre eminence; but in 616 (1219) came the Mongol invasion, and the city was pillaged and utterly ruined. For a century and more it did not recover from this devastation, and in the early part of the 8th (14th) century when Ibn Batiitah visited the place, lodging in the suburb called Fath-abad, the mosques, colleges and markets were still for the most part in the state of ruin in which they had been left by Changiz Khan. It was indeed only at the close of the 8t'h (14th) century, under the rule of Timiir, who made Samarkand his capital, that Bukhara, the sister city, regained some of her former splendour 1 . Samarkand was up stream, and about 150 miles due east of Bukhara; being situated at a short distance from the southern bank of the Sughd river, and occupying high ground. The city, which was encircled by a wall with a deep ditch, was protected by a fortress, also on the height, and below, near the river bank, were great suburbs. All round Samarkand were orchards, and palaces with their gardens, irrigated by canals innumerable, and cypress trees grew here magnificently. Within the fortress had stood the governor's palace, also the prison, but when Ibn Hawkal wrote this stronghold was mostly in ruins; according to Yakut it had double gates of iron. The city proper had four gates; namely, Bab-as-Sin, ' the China Gate,' to the east, to which steps ascended from the lower level, and from it the river was overlooked; the Bukhari Gate to the north; to the west the Bab-an-Naw Bahar, 1 1st. 313—315.

[CHAP. also on the height; and to the south the Bab-al-Kabir, ' the Great Gate,' also known as the Kish Gate. The city, according to Yakut, was 2500 jaribs in extent (about 750 acres), and within its circuit were many markets and bath houses. These, with the private houses, had their water brought in by leaden pipes, communicating with a leaden main, which entered the city by the Bab Kish, the water coming from the canals outside, where it was taken along a great dyke above ground, and in the market-place the leaden channels are described as resting on stone supports. The great market-place of Samar kand was called the Ras-at-Tak, ' the Head of the Arch,' and was a fine square. The Friday Mosque, with the later Government House, stood immediately below the fortress. The houses in the town were built of both wood and clay bricks, and the city population was extremely numerous. The suburbs of Samarkand lay along the river bank, on the lower level, and a semicircular wall, two leagues long, surrounded them on the land side, the river to the north, as the chord of the arc, completing the line of defence. This suburb wall was pierced by eight gates, to which the various thoroughfares led, and these were named as follows: first the Bab Shadawad, then the Ashbask gate, then those of Siikbshin and of Afshinah, next the Bab Klihak, or 4 Gate of the Mound, 5 opening on the height where the city and fortress were situated, after which came the Warsamn gate, the Rivdad gate, and finally the Bab Farrukhshid. The market streets of the suburb all converged on the square of the Ras-at-Tak in the city, and all the roadways were paved with stone flags. The markets in the suburb were the centre of trade, being full of merchants and merchandise from all parts, for the city was the great emporium of Transoxiana. Among other goods the paper of Samarkand was especially famous throughout the East, the art of making it having been introduced from China. The climate of the place was damp, and every house in both city and suburb had its garden, so that viewing Samarkand from the fortress height it appeared as one mass of trees. To the south rose the hill of Kuhak, a spur from the mountains beyond which lay within a day's march of the city.XXXIIl] SUGHD. 465 The temporary ruin of Samarkand, as of all Transoxiana, was due to the Mongols, who almost destroyed the city in 616 (1219): so that, when Ibn Batlitah visited it in the following century, he describes it as without walls or gates, with but a few inhabited houses standing in a maze of ruins. The river here (or possibly he refers to the canal from the Sughd river) he names the Nahr-al- Kassarin, 'the Fullers' River,' and on this stood many water- wheels. The glory of Samarkand, however, revived shortly after this, at the close of the 8th (14th) century, when Timur made it his capital, rebuilding the town, and founding the great mosques and caravanserais which were seen here by the Spanish ambassa dor Clavijo in 808 (1405), some of which remain to the present day. The Friday Mosque in particular, according to 'Alt of Yazd, Timlir founded on his return from the conquest of India, and its splendour was due to the treasures brought back from this campaign. Clavijo describes Samarkand at this time as sur rounded by an earthen wall; and he states that the city was a little larger than Seville in his native country The districts round Samarkand, lying principally to the east ward and south, but also to the north of the Sughd river, were all extremely fertile. Nine leagues to the east of Samarkand, and likewise on the south side of the river, was the town of Banjikath (existing at the present day as Penjakant), surrounded by fertile orchards, producing more especially almonds and nuts, with corn lands stretching along its canals. Between this and Samarkand was the great village of Waraghsar, with its district, where most of the canals watering the lands round Samarkand had their origin from the river. On the south side of the capital was the Maymurgh district, with the village of Rivdad, one league from Samarkand, and contiguous was the Sanjafaghan district. None of the lands round Samarkand surpassed Maymurgh in fertility, it was famous for its splendid trees, and throughout its length and breadth were innumerable villages. To the south of this lay the hill country called the Jibal-as-Savdar, the healthiest region of the province. Here, according to Ibn Hawkal, at a place called Wazkard was a church belonging to the Christians—probably Nestorians— 1 1st. 316—318. I. H. 365—368. Muk. 278, 279. Kaz. ii. 359. Yak. in. 134. I.

The mountain valleys were most fertile, each well watered by its stream, on which stood the farmsteads; and every kind of crop was pro duced abundantly. The neighbouring district of Ad-Dargham consisted mostly of pasture lands, but grapes grew here abundantly, and on its borders was the Awfar, or Abghar district, with many populous villages, each with pasture lands two leagues across where great herds of cattle were reared. This was the last of the districts to the south of Samarkand and the river. On the north bank of the Sughd river, towards the Ushrtisanah province, was the BCizmajan, or Buzmajaz district, of which the chief town was Barkath, or Abarkath, four leagues or one day's march distant from Samarkand to the north-east. Four leagues further to the north lay Khushtifaghan, an important village, in later times known as Ras-al-Kantarah (Bridge Head). Beyond this again was the Burnamadh, or Furnamadh district, near the frontier of Ushrusanah, and next to it the Yarkath district, the furthest to the north; both being famous for their pasture lands. Seven leagues due north of Samarkand was the town of Ishtikhan, with a strong castle and outer suburbs, standing on canals from the Sughd river. Its corn fields were renowned, and Istakhn calls it 'the Heart of Sughd' for its fertility. Seven leagues further north, again, was Kushaniyah, or Kushani, described as a most populous city of Sughd; and its people were all rich or of easy circumstances. Further, as of the north bank, and according to Yikfit lying only two leagues distant from Samarkand, was the district of Kabudhanjakath, with the city called Lanjiighkath, and adjoining it Widhar, in the hill country, the chief town being of the same name, where celebrated stuffs were made. Lastly the district of the Marzuban —or Warden of the Marches—Ibn Tarkasfi, one of the Sughd Dihkans, or provincial nobles, and this lay beyond Widhar'. The Sughd river or Zarafshan ('Gold Spreader'), as it is now called, had its head-streams in the mountain range called the Jabal-al-Buttam, which formed the watershed between the rivers of Sughd on the one hand, and those of Saghaniyan and the 1 1st. 321—333.

The slopes of the Jabal-al-Buttam, though high and steep, were covered with villages, and there were gold and silver mines here, as well as workings that produced iron, quicksilver, copper, lead, naphtha, and bitumen, while from the district came rosin, turquoises, lignite for burning, and especially sal-ammoniac. This last, which was largely exported, was collected from the deposit of fumes which issued from a cavern. A chamber had been built over the vents, with windows and doors to close at need; and there were here subterranean fires also, according to Istakhri, for the sal-ammoniac vapour which appeared as smoke by day was by night visible as a mighty flame. He describes how th^ fumes were condensed in the chamber, the sal-ammoniac being periodically taken out by men, who, clothed in wet felts, hastily entered and ran out again, by reason of the great heat which otherwise would have burnt them up. The sal-ammoniac fumes, Istakhn adds, also issued from many crevasses in the adjacent rocks, and these were enlarged to become new artificial vents. The fumes were only held to be noxious when confined for the purpose of condensation in the chambers, otherwise the vents in the hill sides could be approached with impunity 1 . The source of the Sughd river was at a place called Jan, or Jay, where there was a lake surrounded by villages, the district being known as Wurghar, or Barghar. From the lake the river took its course through mountain valleys, until it reached Banjikath, after which it came to the village of Waraghsar already mentioned, the meaning of which, in the local dialect, was £ the Dam Head,' for here the waters were divided up and the canals were led off that irrigated both the lands round Samarkand and the districts on the north bank of the river. Of the canals flowing to Samarkand two were sufficiently large to carry boats; and Ibn Hawkal gives in a list the names of these various water courses, and the districts irrigated by each, with their villages. At Samarkand the river was crossed by a masonry bridge called Kantarah Jard, which in flood seasons was sometimes entirely submerged. Below Samarkand many canals also branched 1 1st. 312, 327. I. H. 362, 382. 3°— 2468 SUGHD. [CHAP. off to the various districts round Dabusiyah and Karminiyah which will be described presently, and then the Sughd river came to the neighbourhood of Bukhara. Here the main stream was commonly known as the Bukhara river, and already outside the Great Wall of the Bukhara district canals began to be led otf for the irrigation of the city lands within the wall, and for the district beyond. The names of all these are also enumerated by Ibn Hawkal, with their various villages. Some canals formed a network, flowing back to the main stream, while others were lost in irrigation channels to the south-west. The chief canals leading to Bukhara city are described as having been large enough to carry boats 1 . Between Bukhara and Samarkand, on the south side of the Sughd river, there were three important cities in the 4th (10th) century, namely Karminiyah (which still exists), Dabtlsiyah, and Rabinjan. Karminiyah lay one stage east of Tawawis, and outside the Great Wall; it was larger than this latter place, very populous and surrounded by villages and fertile lands, which were irrigated by canals from the Sughd river. Yakut speaks of its magnificent trees. One stage to the east, again, was the large town of Ad -Dabvlsiyah, likewise on a canal from the south bank of the Sughd river, but it had no large villages or dependencies round it. The small town of Khudimankan lay one league distant from Karminiyah, and a bow-shot distant north of the high road. On the north bank of the Sughd river one league above Khudimankan was the great hamlet of Madhyamajkath, while Kharghankath was one league lower down, also on the northern bank and opposite Karminiyah, from which it was but a league distant. These three hamlets were of sufficient size in the 4th (10th) century for each to have had its Friday Mosque, and Yakut reports that Khudimankan was famous for divers traditionists born here. Arbinjan, or Rabinjan, lay one stage to the east of Dabusiyah, and was a larger town than this last; to the east again, at the half-way stage between Rabinjan and Samarkand and seven leagues from this capital, was Zarman. As of the neighbourhood of Bukhara, Mukad- 1 1st. 310—312, 319—321. I. H. 359—361, 368—371.XXXIII] SUGHD. 469 dasi names and describes a large number of other small towns, but unfortunately no distances are given to mark their positions 1 . To the southward, running parallel with the Sughd river and like it ending in marshy lakes, is the shorter stream now known as the Kushkah Darya, on which stand Shahr-i-Sabz and Karsht Shahr-i-Sabz, 'Green City,' was in the earlier middle-ages known as Kish (Kishsh), and is described by Ibn Hawkal as having a castle, the town itself being strongly fortified, with a great suburb lying beyond its gates. Further, beyond the suburb, was a second township, probably that now known as Kitab, named Al-MusaM, ' the Praying Place,' where stood the hostelries and the palace of the governor. Great markets were found in the suburb, but the Friday Mosque with the prison were in the inner city. This covered a square mile of ground, and its houses were built of wood and unburnt bricks. The neighbouring lands were extremely fertile; all the fruits of the hot region were grown here and exported to Bukhara. The inner city of Kish had four gates, called respectively, the Iron Gate, the Gate of 'Ubayd Allah, the Butchers' Gate (Bab-al-Kassabin), and the Inner City Gate. The outer city, or suburb, had two gates, the Bab Baraknan, so called after a neighbouring village, and the Outer City Gate (Bab-al- Madinah-al-Kharijah). The main stream of what is now known as the river Kushkah, was, in the 4th (10th) century, called the Nahr-al-Kassarin, 'the Fullers' River'; its sources were in the Jabal-Sayam, and it passed Kish on the south side. To the north ran the Nahr Asrud, and, one league beyond, the road towards Samarkand was crossed by the river called the Jay Rud. To the south, one league from Kish on the road to Balkh, was the Khushk Rud, 'the Dry River,' and the Khuzir Rfld lay eight leagues beyond this again. These streams, after irrigating the various districts round Kish, flowed together, and became a single stream, which passed by the city of Nasaf. The Kish territory is described as four days' journey across in every direction, and as famed for its extraordinary fertility. In the neighbouring mountains salt was found, also the manna called Taranjubin, and various simples which were 1 1st. 314, 316, 323. I. H. 363, 365, 375. Muk. 282.

In later times Kish attained fame as the birth-place of Timfir, who in the latter part of the 8th (14th) century rebuilt the town, where the White Palace—Ak-Saray— became his favourite place of residence. It was at this period that Kish took the name, which it still retains, of Shahr-i-Sabz t 4 the Green City 1 .' Rather more than a hundred miles down the river below Kish, and to the westward, is the city now known as Karshi, which the medieval Arabs called Nasaf, and the Persians Nakhshab. In the 4th (10th) century Nasaf had a strong castle, and extensive suburbs lay outside the city, which was surrounded by a wall having four gates, namely the Bab-an-Najariyah^ the Samarkand Gate, the Kish Gate, and the Bab Ghtibadhin. Nasaf stood on the river which, as already said, was the main arm formed by the junction of many streams from the Kish district. On its bank was the palace of the governor, at the place called Ras-al-Kantarah, 'the Bridge Head. ? The prison lay adjacent to the governor's palace, and the Friday Mosque near the Ghiibadhm Gate, the great market streets lying in between. Just within the Najanyah Gate was the oratory, Al-Musalla» Mukaddasi, who praises the excellent grapes of Nakhshab, speaks of its fine markets; the town was surrounded by fertile fields and orchards, but had no great outlying dependencies like those surrounding Kish. In history Nasaf, or Nakhshab, was famous as the place where in the latter half of the 2nd (8th) century Al-Mukanna'—the cele brated Veiled Prophet of Khurasan—had first arisen and done miracles. From a well in Nakhshab, night after night, at his command the moon, or its semblance, rose to the wonder of all beholders. To the Persians Mukanna' was generally known as Mah-sazandah, or ' Moon Maker,' and, as history relates, the revolt of his followers for many years gave great trouble to the generals of the Caliph Mahdi. As regards Nakhshab city, after the times of the Mongol invasion in the 7th (13th) century, a certain Kapak Khan built himself a palace at a place some two leagues distant from the older town, and 4 a palace' in the Mongol language is called Karshi, which name was subsequently given to the settle- 1 1st. 324.

Ibn Battitah sojourned here in the early part of the 8th (14th) century, and describes Karshi as a small town surrounded by gardens. At the close of the century Timiir frequently passed his winters at Karshi, and he afterwards built near it the Hisar or fortress 1 . There were two towns near Nasaf, in the 4th (10th) century and later, each of which had its Friday Mosque. One of these, the smaller, was Bazdah, or Bazdawah, a strong castle, situate six leagues to the westward of Nasaf on the road to Bukhara. The other and larger town was Kasbah, four leagues from Nasaf, also in the Bukhara direction, where there were excellent markets according to YaMt. Further, between Nasaf and Kish, one stage west of the latter city, was the town or large village of Nawkad Kuraysh; while one stage south-east of Nasaf, on the road to the Iron Gate (see p. 441), was Stinaj, a large village, with Iskifghan lying one league from it, both these towns being watered by the Khuzar river already mentioned 2 . The products, natural and manufactured, of Sughd were numerous. The melons of Bukhara were famous all the world over, and its looms produced carpets and prayer rugs, fine cloth for clothes, and coarse carpets such as were spread in great guest-chambers. In the prisons they made saddle-girths; and hides were well tanned, while various sorts of grease and oil were manufactured for export. Samarkand was above all famous for its paper, and the looms produced red cloth and cloth of silver, with brocades and raw-silk stuffs. Here, too, the copper-smiths made brass pots of a very large size, and other artificers produced stirrups, martingales, and girths, also various sorts of jars and goblets. From the neighbouring districts were exported immense quantities of filberts and walnuts. Kar- miniyah, between Bukhara and Samarkand, produced napkins, and from Dabiisiyah came various kinds of cloth and brocade. Rabinjan exported red felts, prayer carpets, and tin cups; also 1 1st. 325.

Moreover winter rice was grown in this district 1 . As already said in Chapter XXX (p. 431) the great Khurasan road crossed the Oxus beyond Amuyah to Firabr, and thence proceeded by Baykand and through the gate in the Great Wall to Bukhara. From this capital the road went up the left bank of the Sughd river to Samarkand, passing through the chief towns of the district, and this part of the highway is given with but little variation by all the earlier authorities, Ibn Hawkal and Mukad- dasi adding the distances between the outlying towns of the Bukhara and Samarkand districts 2 . The high road which passed through Khurasan to Balkh (see p. 432) crossed the Oxus to Tirmidh, from which branched various roads north through Saghaniyan and Kubadhiyan to Washjird, whence by the Stone Bridge the Wakhsh and Khuttal districts were attained. North-west from Tirmidh another road went up to the Iron Gate, and at Kandak, one stage beyond this, bifurcated. Running due north, the road on the right hand went by Kish, and thence on to Samarkand; while to the north-westward the highway on the left hand led to Nakhshab; whence a branch road turned eastward back to Kish, while the main road crossed the tract of desert to Bukhara. These routes, mostly in short distances, are given by Istakhn and in part by Mukaddasi 3 . The delta lands of the Oxus in the Khwarizm province were reached from Amul on the Khurasan side by a road going up the left bank to Tahiriyah, where cultivation began, and thence on to Hazarasp. Here one way went to the left by Khivah to Jurjaniyah (Urganj), while another turned off to Kath, and the towns on the right bank of the Oxus.

Further, Mustawfi, in the 8th (14th) century, gives two routes from the south converging on Urganj, one going across the desert north from Faravah (now Kizil Arvat, see p. 380) to Urganj; the other going from Marv, also across the 1 I.

Its eastern frontier was on the Pamir (Famir) according to the Arab geographers. The capital was the city of Ushnisanah (Madinah Ushrusanah), otherwise called Btinjikath, Banjakath, or Bunujkath, the site of which is identical with the present town of Ura-tepeh 1 . Btinjikath was in the 4th (10th) century a city of over 10,000 men, built of clay bricks and wood, having an inner part surrounded by a wall, and an outer suburb also walled. The inner city had two 1 Bunjikath the capital of Ushrusanah must not be confounded with Banjikath (Penjakant) to the east of Samarkand.

A great canal passed through the inner city, having many mills upon its bank. The wall that surrounded the suburb, or outer city, included many gardens, and was three leagues in circuit. In this wall were four gates, namely the Zamin Gate, the Marasmandah Gate, the Nujkath Gate, and the Gate of Kahlabadh. The town lands were amply irrigated by six small streams, which Ibn Hawkal names. These flowed down from the neighbouring hills, and after a course of about half a league passed through Bunjikath, having ten mills upon their banks. The town was celebrated for its many charming gardens. Zamin, which still exists, lay to the east of Bftnjikath, and was the point where the great Khurasan road, coming up through Bukhara and Samarkand, finally bifurcated, one road going north to Shash (Tashkand), the other north-east to Farghanah and beyond. Zamin was, in the 4th (10th) century, almost of the size of the capital Bunjikath; it was a very ancient town, and had been formerly known as Siisandah, or Sarsandah. It possessed a fine Friday Mosque, and excellent markets, being surrounded by gardens, but it was unwalled. A stream flowed through the town crossed by many bridges of boats. The town of Sabat likewise exists. It lay between Zamin and Btinjikath, on the road to Farghanah and is described by Mukaddasi as very populous, embowered by numerous orchards and gardens, lying beside its streams 1 . The names of other towns of Ushrtisanah are given in the lists, but without any description, and the positions of the majority are unknown. Of those still existing, or whose sites can be fixed from the Itineraries, are the following. Dizak, otherwise Jizak, lies north-west of Zamin; and south of it, on the road from Samarkand, was the important town of Kharakanah. Khawas or Khawas is on the road going north from Zamin to Shash, and Kurkath lies on the frontiers of Farghanah, midway between Sabat and Khujandah. The position of the two small towns of Minak and Marasmandah cannot be exactly fixed, for neither is 1 1st. 326, 327. I. H. 379, 380. Muk. 277.476 THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. [CHAP. given in the Itinerary, but Marasmandah, to judge by the Marasmandah gate of Btinjikath, must have been in the neigh bourhood of the capital. It stood in the hills, had a cold climate, with many streams, but few orchards or gardens, on account of its elevation. Mukaddasi speaks of its excellent markets; and the Friday Mosque stood in their midst, Marasmandah being a very populous place. Minak appears to have been in its near neigh bourhood, and was celebrated for the great battle fought here by Kutaybah, the Arab commander at the time of the first Moslem conquest of Transoxiana. At this place, too, was the castle that had belonged to Afshin, the general and favourite of the Caliph Mu^tasim. Near both Marasmandah and Minak there were iron mines, and tools made here were exported to all parts of Khurasan, the steel being of excellent quality; so that even in Baghdad these were much sought after 1 . The great river Jaxartes, as already said (p. 434), was called by the Arabs the SayMn or SiMn. It was, however, more generally known as the Nahr-ash-Shash, the river of Shash (Old Tashkand), from the name of the most important city near its banks. In the 8th (14th) century, according to Mustawfi, the Mongol population of these parts knew it under the name of Gil-Zariyan. Since that time, and down to the present day, it has been commonly called the Sir Darya or Sir Su (River Sir) by the Turks, this name being mentioned by Abu-l-Ghazi. According to Ibn Hawkal the river Jaxartes rose in the Turk country, being formed by the junction of many mountain streams, and it entered the great valley of Farghanah at its eastern end, near the town of Uzkand; the province of Farghanah lying for a couple of hundred miles and more in length to the north and south of its upper stream 2 . Flowing here due east, the SayMn received numerous affluents during its course through Farghanah, namely the Nahr Kharshan, the rivers of Urast and of Kuba, also the Nahr Jidghil, which is probably the present Naryn river, and some others. Passing on by the walls of Akhsikath, the capital? the Sayhun came to Khujandah, where it finally passed out of the 1 1st. 336, 343. I. H. 381, 382, 383. Muk. 278.

Thence, turning northwards, the river next received on its right bank the two streams called the Nahr Ilak and the Nahr Turk, passing to the westward of the districts of Ilak and of Shash. Beyond these the Sayhiln finally came to the Isbijab districts, whence, through the deserts of the Ghuzz and the Turks it ultimately flowed out by numerous channels to the Sea of Aral in its north-eastern part. The Arab geographers say that the SayMn was navigable for boats like the Jayhun, and for a longer time than was the case with the Oxus the Jaxartes was frozen over in winter, so that caravans could cross it on the ice. Moreover it was counted as only two-thirds of the length of the sister stream l . The province of Farghanah, which until w T ithin recent years was more generally known as the Khanate of Khtlkand, but which under the Russian government has officially again taken its more ancient name, had for its capital, in the earlier middle-ages, the city of Akhsikath, which Ibn Khurdadbih and others call Far ghanah city. It lay on the north bank of the Jaxartes. The ruins of this town exist, and in the icth (16th) century when Babar was ruler of Farghanah, under the shortened form of Akhsi it was the second city of the province, Andijan being then the capital. Akhsikath is described by Ibn Hawkal as a large city, with a castle, where stood the Friday Mosque^ the governor's palace, and the prison ; and outside the inner town was an extensive suburb. The inner city, which measured a mile across in every direction, was intersected by numerous water channels, all connected with a great tank; and there were markets both here and in the suburb, which latter was surrounded by a wall. The inner city had five gates, namely the Kasan Gate, the Mosque Gate (Bab-al-Jami'), the Rahanah Gate, next a gate with an uncertain name that may be read as Bakhtar, and finally the Gate of Al-Mardakshah. The place was entirely surrounded by gardens, which extended for a distance of a couple of leagues beyond the suburb gates, and on the further, or south side of the Jaxartes were rich pasture grounds. Akhsikath was apparently 1 I. H. 392, 393. Muk. 22. Yak. iii. 210. Mst. 215. Hfz. 33^. J.N. 360. A. G. 13, 181, 290.478 THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. [CHAP. ruined, with many of the other cities of Farghanah, in the wars of Muhammad Khwarizm Shah at the beginning of the 7th (13th) century, and the Mongol invasion completed the work; after which the capital was removed to Andijan. In the time of Timtir, ^Ali of Yazd gives the name under the form Akhsikant or Akhsikat, and as we have seen this was shortened to Akhsi in the days of Babar 1 . Andigan (modern Andijan), according to Mustawfi, was made the capital of Farghanah by Kaydu Khan, grandson of Ugutay, son of Changiz, in the latter half of the 7th (13th) century. The name of Andigan, or Andukan, occurs in the lists of towns given by Ibn Hawkal in the 4th (10th) century, and is also mentioned by Yaktit, but nowhere is the town described, though in the account of Timor's campaigns it is frequently referred to by AJi of Yazd. From the Itineraries it would seem that the city of Kuba, which in the 4th (10th) century was a place of much importance, must have stood near Andijan. Kuba, says Istakhri, was almost of the size of Akhsikath, and its gardens were even more extensive. It had a strong castle, where the Friday Mosque stood, in the Maydan or central square; and there was an outer suburb, where was the governor's palace, and the prison. The suburb was surrounded by a great wall, and there were many well- supplied market streets 2 . Half-way between Akhsikath and Kuba was the town of Ushtikan with a Friday Mosque in its market-place; and to the east of Kuba was Ush, which already in the 4th (10th) century was a place of great importance. In the castle of Ush stood as was usual the governor's palace, and the prison; and the inner town was surrounded by a walled suburb, running up the slope of the neighbouring hill; with three gates, namely the Hill Gate (Bab-al-Jabal), the Water Gate (Bab-al-Ma), and the Mughkadah 1 I.

The termination Kath, or Kdt, is synonymous with Kand, or Kant, and both occur in many names of places in Central Asia, and have the meaning in the Turkish dialects of 'a city' or 'burg,' as Yakut (i. 404) very justly remarks. See e.g. Nuzkath (New Wall) in Khwarizm, mentioned on p. 454. Ist* 333* I* H. 394, 395. Muk. 272. Mst. 228. Yak. i. 375; iv. 24. A. Y. ii. 633.XXXIV] THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. 479 Gate. The Friday Mosque stood in a broad Rahbah, or square, surrounded by markets; and the lands around were plentifully watered by many streams. Near by, on a hill-top, was a guard house garrisoned by soldiers—volunteers—who watched against the incursions of the Turkish hordes. Beyond Ush is Uzkand, the easternmost city of Farghanah, described as two-thirds A A # • of the size of Ush. Uzkand, too, lay in a fertile district, having a castle, a well-fortified inner city, and a suburb with markets that were much frequented by the Turk merchants. A river went by one of the town gates, for the suburb was sur rounded by a wall pierced by four gates, and the Friday Mosque stood in the market-place. That part of Farghanah which lay to the south of the Jaxartes was known as the district of Nasya, or Nasaiyah, divided into upper and lower according to its elevation, upper Nasaiyah lying among the hills. Of lower Nasiiyah was the town of Marghinan (modern Marghilan), a small place in the 4th (10th) century, but with a Friday Mosque in its market. To the west of this lies Rishtan, a large town in early days, also with a fine Friday Mosque. Khukand, which in recent times became the capital of Farghanah, and gave its name to the Khanate, is only mentioned incidentally among the cities of upper Nasaiyah, and under the form Khuwakand or Khuwakand. Khujandah, the first town of Farghanah on the west coming from Samarkand, lay on the left bank of the Jaxartes, and adjacent to it one league southward was the suburb of Kand. Khujandah was of considerable length along the river strand, but of little breadth; it had a strong castle with a prison. The Friday Mosque was in the city; the governor's palace being in the Maydan, or square, of the suburb. Khujandah is described by Ibn Hawkal as a most pleasant town, and its people possessed boats for going on the Jaxartes river. The outer suburb of Kand was more especially known as Kand-i-Badham, 6 Kand of the Almonds,' and according to Kazvini it was so called from a parti cular variety of this fruit, grown here, that was famous for its husk peeling off very easily when the almond was taken in the hand 1 . 1 1st. 332, 333, 347- I- H - 39 1 » 39 2 ' 394, 395- Muk. 262, 272, 345.

Of the cities in the northern part of Farghanah, namely of the lands on the right bank of the Jaxartes, very little is known during early times. Mukaddasi describes Wankath as a town with a Friday Mosque and good markets, and from the Itineraries we learn that Wankath lay seven leagues to the west of Akhsikath, being one league from the bank of the Jaxartes, and not far from the frontiers of Ilak. North of Wankath and among the hills was Khayralam, or Khaylam, a town of the district of Miyan RMhan, 'Betwixt the Rivers,' with a fine Friday Mosque and good markets. To the north of this again lay Shikit, or Sikkit, a town where according to Mukaddasi nuts grew so abundantly that a thousand could be had for a silver dirham; and here too there was a Friday Mosque in the market-place. The town of Kasan still exists, and is described by the earlier geographers as situate in the district of the same name. Yakfit adds that it had a strong castle, and that past its gate ran the stream which ulti mately joined the Jaxartes at Akhsikath. Further north was the district of Jidghil, of which the chief town was Ardalankath. To the east of this lay the Karwan district, of which the chief town was called Najm. A number of other towns are also briefly described by Mukaddasi, but unfortunately there is no indication of their respective positions 1 . To the westward of Farghanah came the district of Shash,, which, as already said, lay on the right bank or north-east of the Jaxartes. The ruins now known as Old Tashkand are the site of the city called Shash by the Arabs, and Chach by the Persians, which, in the middle-ages, was the greatest of the Arab towns, beyond the Jaxartes. The city of SMsh was also known by the name of Binkath 2 , for like many other places in Transoxiana,, there was the double nomenclature, Iranian and Turanian. Shash, in the 4th (10th) century, was a city of many walls. There was, in the first place, an inner town, with a castle, or citadel, standing separate, but adjacent, and these two were sur rounded by a wall. Outside the inner town was the inner suburb, surrounded by its own wall, and beyond this again lay the outer 1 I®' - 334' 347- I-H. 396. Muk. 27 1 ) 272. Yak. iv. 227. This is often by an error in the diacritical points written e.g.. Yak. i. 746.XXXIV] THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. 481 suburb, with many gardens and orchards surrounded in turn by a third wall. Lastly there was the Great Wall, which, as was the case at Bukhara, protected the whole district, making a great semicircular sweep round Shash to the northward, from the bank of the Turk river on the east to the Jaxartes on the west. To return to the inner town and the citadel; this last, within which was the governor's house and the prison, had two gates, one opening on the inner tow T n, the other to the suburbs. The Friday Mosque had been built on the wall of the citadel. The inner town, which was a league across in every direction, contained some important markets and had three gates, first the double gate of Abu-PAbbas, then the Bab Kish, doubtless to the south where the road from Samarkand came in, and lastly the gate of Al-Junayd. The wall of the inner suburbs had ten gates (Mukaddasi names only eight), and of the outer suburbs seven, which are all carefully enumerated by Ibn Hawkal, and in the inner suburbs were found the great markets of Shash. The whole city was plentifully supplied by conduits of running water from canals, which after wards irrigated the numerous orchards and vineyards within the walls. The Great Wall, at its nearest point, passed at a distance of one league from the gate of the outer suburbs. This wall began on the east at the hill on the Turk river called Jabal Sablagh, and the extensive plain which it enclosed was known as Al-Kilas. The wall was built by 'Abd-Allah ibn Humayd, to protect Shash on the north from the incursions of the Turks, and beyond it, at the distance of a league, was dug a deep ditch, going all the way from the hill on the Turk river to the bank of the Jaxartes on the west. The road north from Shash to Isbijab passed through this w 7 all at the Iron Gate (Bab-al-Hadid). In the early years of the 7th (13th) century, Shash was in part ruined during the conquests of Muhammad Khwarizm Shah, and the Mongol invasion which immediately followed added to the miseries of the people here as elsewhere. The city, however, appears to have recovered rapidly from these misfortunes, and it was again an important place in the 8th (14th) century when Timtir halted here. 'All of Yazd, who frequently has occasion to mention it in describing the campaigns of Timur, gives the names as Shash, L e S. 3 1482 THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. [CHAP. Chach, or Tashkant; this latter being apparently a popular cor ruption of the name Shash to by the Turkish-speaking population, Tashkant meaning ' the stone city,' under which name it is now become the capital of Russian Turkistan 1 . The Nahr Turk, now known as the river Chirchik, which flows to the south-east of Shash, according to Ibn Hawkal rose in the mountains of Jidghil on the north of the Naryn river, and in the district called Baskam of the Kharlikh Turks. To the southward of this river and more or less running parallel with it was the Nahr llak, now called the river Angran, and immediately below where this joined the Jaxartes stood the city of Banakath, the second largest town of the Shash district. Banakath, otherwise called Banakit, or by the Persians Fanakant, was not fortified in the 4th (10th) century, but it had a Friday Mosque in its market place. The town stood on the right bank of the Jaxartes where the great Khurasan road coming up from Samarkand crossed the river going to Shash, and it continued to be a place of great importance till the 7th (13th) century, when it was laid in ruins by Changiz Khan. More than a century later, in 818 (1415), Fanakant was rebuilt by order of Shah Rukh, the grandson of Timiir, and then received the name of Shahrukhiyah, under which it is frequently mentioned by 'Ali of Yazd. The road from Banakath north to Shash passed through the town of Jinanjakath, lying on the south or left bank of the Turk river, some two leagues above its junction with the Jaxartes. This town, though unfortified, was a place of considerable size in the 4th (10th) century, and its houses were built of wood and unburnt brick. Across the Jaxartes to the west, and one march from Jinanjakath on the road to Jizak, was the small town of Waynkard, which Ibn Hawkal describes as a village of the (Nestorian) Christians. Across the Turk river, and somewhat to the west ward in the angle below where it joined the Jaxartes, lay the town of Ushtiirkath, or Shuturkath (Camel City), which was well fortified. This place must have been ruined by the Mongols, for in the latter part of the 8th (14th) century we find it replaced by Chinas (which still exists), the name of which is frequently 1 Kud. 27. I.

Ibn Hawkal and Mukaddasi name more than a score of other cities of the Shash districts, but they add no details, and the positions of these places, therefore, cannot now be fixed; though it is evident that in the 4th (10th) century the whole of this country, as also the Ilak district to the south and Isbijab to the north, was densely populated, with numerous hamlets that were of the size of towns 1 . The district of Ilak lay to the south of the Ilak river, and north of the great bend of the Jaxartes below Khujandah; and its chief town was called Tiinkath. The district, which was continuous with Shash, comprised near a score of important towns, duly enumerated by Ibn Hawkal and others, the sites of which remain undetermined, and it is unfortunately not possible even to discover that of Tiinkath, the capital. According to Ibn Hawkal Ttinkath lay on the river Ilak, and apparently at a distance of eight leagues from Shash, of which it is said to have been half the size 2 . There was a strong castle, an inner city, and a suburb surrounded by a wall. Within the castle was the governor's house, the prison and the Friday Mosque both standing at the castle gate. Great markets were found in both city and suburb, and the whole district round was plentifully supplied with running water. All the country lying between Shash and Ilak was covered with towns, the names of which are given by Ibn Hawkal, but as already said their positions are unfortu nately now lost. One of the most important places mentioned was the populous town of Khasht (also written Khash, Khas, or Khas), near the silver mines in the Ilak hills on the frontiers of Farghanah. Here, according to Ibn Hawkal, in the 4th (10th) century was a mint, where much gold and silver were coined; and the place was surrounded by numerous villages 3 . To the north of Shash, and stretching east from the right bank of the Jaxartes, was the extensive district or province of Isbijab or Asbijab, with the capital of the same name; and Mukaddasi 1 1st. 328—330, 336, 345.

[CHAP. in the 4th (10th) century mentions nearly fifty towns of this region as well known, of which only a very few can now be identified. The city of Isbijab is identical in site with Sayram, lying about eight miles to the eastward of Chimkant on the Arts or Badam river, which is a right-bank affluent of the Jaxartes 1 . According to Ibn Hawkal, it was a third the size of Shash, and consisted of a citadel or castle, with an inner city surrounded by a wall, and the suburb^ also walled. It is reported that the whole circuit of the city of Isbijab was about a league, and that it stood in a great plain three leagues from the nearest hills, being sur rounded by well-watered gardens. The town had four gates, and before each was built a strong Rubat or guard-house. There were markets in both the city and the suburbs, and in the former were situated the governor's house, the prison, and the Friday Mosque. Mukaddasi mentions the Suk-al-Karabis, 4 the market of the cotton- merchants,' as especially famous, and the rents for these shops, which were applied to charitable purposes, amounted to 7,000 dirhams (about ^300) a month. The city of Isbijab appears after the time of the Mongol invasion to have changed its name to Sayram under which it is frequently mentioned by c Ali of Yazd in his accounts of the campaigns of Timtir. Chimkant, written Chimikant, is also frequently mentioned by ^Ali of Yazd and appears to be identical with the town which Mukaddasi writes Jamfikat, and describes as a large, well-fortified city, with a Friday Mosque and suburbs, where there were excellent markets 2 . On the east bank of the SayMn, immediately below where the Chimkant river flows in, is the city at the ford for passing the Jaxartes known originally as Barab or Farab, and in later times as Utrar, where in the year 807 (1405) Timur ended his life, when about to set out for the conquest of China. Farab, or Barab, 1 Muk. 262—264. Schuyler (Turfiistan, i. 75) identifies Isbijab city with Chimkant, but this is certainly a mistake, for in the Tdrikh-i-Rdshidi (translated by N. Elias and E. D. Ross, p. 171) mention is made of 4 Sayram which in old books is called Isbijab.' The Persian text of this passage will be found on folio 105 b of the British Museum MS. Add. 24090. 2 Tst. 333. I.

Mukaddasi speaks of Barab as a large city with 70,000 inhabitants; it was strongly fortified and had a citadel or castle, a Friday Mosque, and great markets. In its warehouses much merchandise was stored. Kadar also had its own Friday Mosque, and was the new town. According to Kazvini the city lay among salt marshes, and was celebrated in history as the birth-place of Abu Nasr-al-Farabi, who died in 339 (950), and was accounted the greatest of the Moslem philosophers before Avicenna. According to Ibn Hawkal, however, the actual birth-place of Al- Farabi was at Wasij, a small fortified town lying two leagues distant from Farab, where there was a fine Friday Mosque in the market place. At a subsequent period Farab took the name of Utrar, also spelt Utrar, which was pillaged in the early part of the 7th (T3th) century by the Mongol hordes, but was shortly after wards rebuilt, for it was in its Saray, or palace, as already said, that Timfir died 1 . About half-way between Sayram and Utrar was the town of Arsubamkath, or Subamkath, which Mukaddasi speaks of as a fine place, well-fortified, with a Friday Mosque in the inner city, and great suburbs lying without the wall. The district round Subani- kath was called Kanjidah. One day's march north of Utrar, along the right bank of the Jaxartes, was the town of Shavaghar, also described by Mukaddasi as a large place, well-fortified, with a Friday Mosque in its market-place, and surrounded, by fertile districts. The name of Shavaghar does not occur in the later geographers, and from its position it would appear to be identical with Yassi, a place often mentioned by 'All of Yazd, and still exist ing to-day under the name of Hadrat-i-Turkistan, i The Presence (of the holy man) of Turkistan/—he being the patron saint of the Kirghiz, who is buried here. According to 4 All of Yazd this personage was Shaykh Ahmad of Yassi, a descendant of 1 I. H. 390, 391. Muk. 262, 273. Kaz. ii. 405. A. F. 493. I. B.iii. 23. A. Y. i. 166, 275; ii. 646.

There is often confusion between Farab or Barab (Utrar) of the Jaxartes, and Faryab (see above, p. 425) in Juzjan, which w T as also called Barab.486 THE PROVINCES OF THE JAXARTES. [CHAP. Muhammad ibn Hanafiyah, son of the Caliph 'Ali. The Shaykh died here in the early part of the 6th (12th) century, and Timur at the close of the 8th (14th) century built over his tomb the mosque, the magnificent remains of which exist, the shrine being still the object of pilgrimage from all the country round. One day ? s journey north of Yassi or Shavaghar was Sawran, or Sabran, which stands to the present day, reckoned in the 4th (10th) century as the frontier fortress against the Ghuzz. Here, in peace times, all the neighbouring Turk tribes came to barter with the Moslem merchants. Mukaddasi depicts Sawran as a very large town, protected by seven fortifications and walls, one built behind the other. The Friday Mosque was in the inner city, and extensive suburbs lay outside the town. 'Ali of Yazd fre quently mentions Sabran when speaking of the campaigns of Timtir, and Yakflt describes its high citadel or castle, which dominated the frontier lands 1 . Among other places on the Jaxartes very frequently mentioned by ^Ali of Yazd, but not noticed by the earlier Arab geographers, is Saghnak, which he gives as the capital of Kipchak and as lying 24 leagues northward from Utrar. Further to the north again is Jand, mentioned by the earlier geographers, and by Yak6t, as one of the great Moslem cities of Turkistan beyond the Jaxartes. In the early part of the 7th (13th) century Jand had been deva stated by the Mongols. The Aral is often named the Sea of Jand, and here, two marches from the mouth of the Jaxartes, lay the Ghuzz capital, called by the Arabs Al-Kariyat-al-Jadidah (or Al- Hadithah), 4 the New Village,' and in later times known as Yanghi- kant or Yangi-Shahr, c New Town/ in Turkish 2 . About 80 miles to the north-east of Sayram (or Isbijab) are the ruins of Taraz, near the present town of Aulieh-Ata. Taraz, or At-Taraz, was an important place as early as the 4th (10th) century, and is described by Ibn Hawkal as the chief commercial 1 I. H. 390, 391. Muk. 262, 273, 274. Yak. iii. 366. A.

Mukaddasi adds that the city was strongly fortified, with a deep ditch, beyond which lay many gardens, and it was extremely populous. The Taraz river ran by one of the four gates of the city, and there was a Friday Mosque in the market-place. According to Kazvini, Taraz was proverbial for the beauty of its men and women, it had a good climate and its lands were extremely fertile. Also of the Turk country and about one hundred miles due east of Taraz lies Barki or Mirki (modern Merkeh), which Mukaddasi describes as a medium-sized town, but well fortified, having a castle, and a Friday Mosque that had originally been a (Nestorian) Christian church. There was a great guard-house here in the 4th (10th) century, built by £ Amid-ad- Dawlah Faik, one of the Buyid Amirs. According to the same authority, Kulan lay one march west of Mirki towards Taraz; it was a large and strongly fortified village with a Friday Mosque, and was accounted a place of much importance 1 . In conclusion it is to be observed that Abu-l-Fida mentions a number of capital cities of the Turks, the exact positions of w T hich it is difficult now to fix. Of these Balasaghun was the capital of the Khans of Turkistan during the 4th and 5th (10th and nth) centuries, and is mentioned by Ibn-al-Athir in his Chronicle. Its exact site is unknown. Abu-l-Fida says, vaguely, that it was near Kashghar, but beyond the Jaxartes. The ruins of Almaligh, which was the Mongol capital under Jaghatay, the son of Changiz Khan, have been found near the site of Old Kuljah, on the river Ilih; and its position is indicated by 'All of Yazd, who also mentions the Irtish river and the Tulas. But of all these towns no descriptions are given, and like Kashghar, Khutan, Yarkand and other places on the borders of China, the notice in our authorities is merely incidental and un fortunately of no import geographically 2 . The countries of the Jaxartes did not produce any great variety of manufactures, and the slave-trade was the chief industry of the merchants who went thither. Mukaddasi mentions that 1 I.

[CHAP. at Dizak (Jisak) in Ushriisanah they made excellent felts and cloaks. The natural products of Farghanah were gold and silver from the mines, also turquoises ; quicksilver, iron, and copper were likewise obtained, also sal-ammoniac, naphtha, and bitumen. The mill-stones of Farghanah were famous, and stone-coal for burning was common here. From the orchards were exported grapes, apples, and nuts, with perfumes made from roses and violets. Shash produced fine white cloth, swords and other weapons, with brass and iron work, such as needles, scissors, and pots. Also saddles of the skin of the wild ass were made, with bows and quivers, dyed hides, and prayer-rugs, as well as a kind of collared cloak. The country round produced rice, flax, and cotton. Finally from Taraz, in the Turk country, came goat skins; and the Turkistan horses and mules were always and especially famous 1 . In regard to the high roads of these provinces, the continuation of the great Khurasan road, going north from Samarkand, crossed the Sughd river, and thence reached Zamin in Ushrusanah, where it bifurcated, the left branch to Shish and the lower Jaxartes, the right to the upper Jaxartes and Farghanah. From Zamin the direct road to Shash crossed the Jaxartes at Banakath; while a second high road from Samarkand went by Dizak, and across the desert to Waynkard, beyond which the Jaxartes was crossed to Shuturkath, where the road from Banakath to Shash was joined. From Shash one road went east to Tunkath, the capital of the Ilak province, and another north to Isbijab, where again there was a bifurcation. Westward from Isbijab, one high road went to Farab (Utrar) for the crossing of the Jaxartes, and thence also north along its right bank to Sabran. To the right, eastward from Isbijab, the other road went to Taraz, and thence to Barki or Mirki, the last Moslem town of Turk lands in the 4th (10th) century, and from this place Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah give the stages across the desert to Upper Ntishanjan on the frontiers of China, which place is probably to be identified with Khutan 2 .

From here, keeping along the south bank of the river, and up stream, Akhsikath, the capital of Farghanah, at the crossing of the Jaxartes, was reached. The distances from Akhsikath to the various towns lying to the north of the upper Jaxartes are given by Istakhri and Ibn Hawkal; while from the capital of Farghanah eastward the continuation of the high road by Ush to tjzkand is found in Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah. Further Mukaddasi gives notes of the way from IJzkand into the Turk country, and ultimately to the frontiers of China. The account is difficult to follow, but, as with Ibn Khurdadbih and Kudamah, the last stage is Upper Nushajan, or Barsakhan, the conjectural Khutan 1 . beyond the Oxus.
