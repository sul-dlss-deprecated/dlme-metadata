The file covers: the treatment and deportation of British subjects (Berberis, or Hazara Khawari) from the Khorasan province of Persia into neighbouring British India (Pakistan); an incident occurring in 1938 in which a bus carrying British consular officials was commandeered by an officer of the Persian military; claims of discrimination against British subjects in Meshed [Mashhad]; a boycott imposed upon the British Consulate at Meshed by the Persian Government; correspondence describing the general attitude of the Persian authorities towards British persons in Persia; a ‘Report on the Attitude towards the British in Persia in March 1938’, written by Lieutenant Ian Hallam Lyall-Grant of the Royal Engineers (ff 134-142).The file’s principal correspondents are: Nevile Montagu Butler of the British Legation in Tehran; HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Horace James Seymour; HM’s Consul at Meshed, Giles Frederick Squire; Charles William Baxter and Herbert Lacy Baggallay of the Foreign Office; the Government of India.The file contains a single item in Persian, a typewritten letter (accompanied by English translation) from the British Embassy in Tehran to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 23 April 1947 (f 5).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
