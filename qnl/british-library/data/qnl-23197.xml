It will be noted that there is no time limit mentioned for the exchange of the notes at offices of the Reserve Bank of Indiaj- KARACHE AND LAHORE CIRCLE NOTSS . Withdrawal Order. NEW DELHI, September 9: The Government of India have decided to withdraw from September 12 Indian Currency Notes and bank notes of the value of Rs.lOO/- having * the words 'Karachi' or 'Lahore' on then, according to the Finance Ministry. These will, however, continue to be legal tender at the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank of India and Government Treasuries and branches of the Reserve Bank of India. The object ©f this decision, it is stated, is to withdraw from circulation notes of the Karachi and Lahore circles. After the partition of India the Karachi and Lahore Offices of the Reserve Bank of India came under Pakistan, and it is not appropriate that Karachi and Lahore Circle Notes should be kept in circulation in India. As the issue of these notes was stopped soon after the partition, their withdrawal is not likely to cause inconvenience to the public. The notes will, however, continue to be received at the offices and agencies of the Reserve Bank of India and their holders will have no difficulty in obtaining payment from them, it is added.' \of « Foou Control Meeting iielct in tno Mow Govftrmrent Of i ice et lO.iutu* on V&gt;e&lt;inee&lt;ley 9 the 4th «!anu*ry t 1V$0« H*&amp;«Mhelih AiHiulleh bln lea aULuallfen 9 C«l«£« 9 i.ro&amp;laea 9 end t^e fo.loelng rcaberfi eere ^reeeiitt Mr«C«D*lrymple Belgreve 9 C*B«E» 9 AdTleer to the Oovt. t'F*0• • «K th 9 u, •3«£* 9 Food Controller# Sheikh Ibrehln bln Mohened elKhellfeh# He j#ibdulreh(nen Abduleeheb el £ey«nl.
