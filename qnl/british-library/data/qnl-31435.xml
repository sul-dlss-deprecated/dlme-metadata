Political./i Translation of letter No* C/gi , dated the 22nd September, 194-8# from His Highness Saiyid Said bin T q imur, Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, Muscat, to H.B.M 1 s Consul, Muscat. My dear friend. With reference to my confidential letter No.C/SO, dated the 10th Thilqa ^^, 1367 , equivalent to the 14th September, 1948 , I request that the following may kindly be conveyed to our friend the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for which I thank you*- M I previously informed you through the Consul about Shaikh Sultan bin Salim Alqasimi. The aforesaid hass arrived here and met us. This is what he has stated:- 1 . About the incident between him and his nephews in overruling RaselKhaimah and ithholding his properities without any cause- as it is know to you. 2 . That he requested the Governments representatives in the Gulf to mediate and reconcile him nth and his brother.. Their reply was ,, 3ettle your affairs yourselves”. 3 . After his nephews overruled RaselKhaimah during his absence from there , he requested the Political Agent to mediate between them so that they (his nephews) may sanction for him the pay he sanctioned them previously, because he did not vant to excite enimity against them and wished to prevent bloodshed. The Political Agent replied that he does not intervene in their affairs and would onsult the Political Resident. 4 . The Political Agent, informed him that he should not go to Thaid without the permission of the Agent Qasoim and actually after some days requested permission from the Agent who permitted him. He went there to see his properties and to claim his rights. During that time he received a letter from the Agent calling him to come fco meet him at Sharjah. He hastened to him (Agent; without anticipating that something would happen to him (Shaikh) as he knew that he committed no wrong-antecedents. When he came to him -the Political Agent was present- The Political Agent inquired from him whether he went to Thaid - he replied ‘•Yes” and that was with the permission of the Agent at Sharjah. The Agent showed no opposition to what he said. Shaikh Sultan saw temper on the Political Agent's face. He said ”You must go to Bahrain” Shaikh Sultan asked 'Is there any reason for this” the Political Agent then safi, in a bitter way, 'You are compelled to go to Bahrain' . He (Shaikh) said 'I want sometime to arrange my things, and I am complying with the order' • The Political Agent replied 'No delay for even an hour'. Then the (P) Agent told him, 'Let us go'. They got up and went out. When he reached the car park he saw that his servant, who was waiting for him, had been stripped off his arms. The aforesaid Shaikh intended to escape but Qasim the Agent, caught him by his clothes but he (Shaikh; slipped away, the Bisht remaining in the Agent's hand. The Shaikh hastened in his walk ad during tfts he heard gun-firing behind him He was astonished at that time when he fired with his pistol in the air intending to prevent pursual by those who fiired at him. Then he disappeared from their sight. He stated that he heard rumours which were spread against him that he intended the shots for the Political Agent and the Agent Qasim, but he swears that was not his intention, as he did n.t ignore the dignity of Govt, me and the consequences against him had he done so. The Government power was not unknown to him, which he apprediated as it should be. But as he previously stated he was surprised to hear the firings of guns and what happened thereafter. It never came to his mind that the soldiers would© * would fire at him without any reason or commitment. He is quite confident that the Government vould not approve this. He is still preserving friendship towards its men. He also stated that he wrote you a letter in which he stated the incident, and he is unaware whether the letter had reached xsasx you or not. Shaikh Sultan statement about the reason of the incident is over. We understood from Shaikh Sultan that his escape from Shajah was only becaaue he was required to goto Bahrain without any sin, nevertheless, no time as given to him in order to arrange his things. In addition to that when he decided to escape from Political Agent*s hand, Qassim. the Agent, fired at him. In hesitating C? to come to Bahrai n, he did not mean to disobey you, or was he concealing an evel, but was frightened, in order that he might not be burden vith a great responsibility for something which he did not mean, but you suspected him of. He wanted some means to approach you in order to know the reasons which would guarantee his safety. He is not to be blamed for a sin which he had not committed, and desires to procure your forgivness to be in safety and tranquillity. There is no doubt that he admits your ability on him and his attitude toward you. Now he has no contradiction to you and he is prepaaed to do what you approve. We too, request for him the acceptance of his appology and to see a way to forgive him after he meets you. Our ample hope is that the Government ?.culd forgive him after he has been reconciled to you. We request you to kindly loock into his case and should be grateful if you would inform us of your viev;s and what you desire from the said Shaikh. We have informed Shaikh Sultan to leave Muscat now, pending a receipt of information regarding him from you. We confirm to you that we have allowed the aforesaid Xkaxkk to come to us only because we desired to bridge the difference and enble him to do what you approve and to forgive him as we have not seen an objection fr-m him. Your views would be satisfactory? Usual Ending./Oj / .
