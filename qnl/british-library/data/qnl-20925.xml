He has ordered that any one who likes may wear the 11 krij 1 again 'Both foms of head-dress■ Jire ©aually good to wear', he has said. The enthusiasm for the dkhwan movement is astonish* 1 ing among the various Hajdie I have recently met. They are continually remarking that so and so Snaha-Allah 'tedaiyan*.

Ily impressions are that the .move meat is becoming distinctly a political as well a* a religious movement: Certainly Pin Saul has no intention of aliow- % in- the Akhwan to get the better of hi®, at the same time, he with great shrewdness would appear to be fostering the movement up to a certain point, he perceives, as any looker on can.see that the unity of Hajd goes hand in hand and is bound up with the new Revival. I am personaliy inclined to think that there is a much• greater future forCertainly j hin Baud and the akhwafi isov^irient awoui^ the Arsd^T^fj Arab*, that anything that King Hussain or his son faisal can ever attain to. there Is no doubt that the Akhwan tenants arespreading towards te^en, and asir, the whole of Haesa, Qatar and the trucial coast is becoming affected. I must confess too that the Akhwan MOT'ement as seen from close quarters here, bears quite a .different resemblance to the worecent a* portrayed in resopotamia by such men as amud as Buwait of the Dhafir and Shaikh Ibrahim of Aubair.

Hajd Mips ion which ip now in Bombay should reach Has a about February 20th. Hotil Bin Baud bar conferred with hip**ion and has seen report of proceedings to which reference is made in draft menssge to Sin S.a’ud, it ir unlikely that he will feel |§ i€ to answer latter and puppicionj*! may be aroused if we press for a reply previous to the return of the Mire ion. I therefore propose subject to your approval to await- arrival of Mission and news as to the nature] of the communication referred to by Bin fa*ud in his letter of January loth before forwarding to him the i . message ordered in your telegram of January 24th. Bfcondly , I do not think that Bin Sa'ud will consent to proceed to Jeddah by land and 1 doubt if it is expedient on general grounds to ask him to do so. He would certainly not venture there without a large personal escort and in the present state of religious tension the result of any untoward, incident | 'might be very grave. The intention of the journey might moreover be widely misunderstood. Thirdl y . Should he not consent to proceed to Jeddah by land, two courses appear possible. 1. To ask King Hussain to agree to meeting in neighbourhood of Taif, 4shairah or Tarahah. 2. To ask Bin Ca'ud to visit Eir^p Huesain at Jeddah by sea and to provide him with a naval or . ■ , ■ IR.I.SI. vessel for the purpos I shall be p;iad to know whether tllfi atter course woald receive the approval of H« «G* The.Naval Commander of the Saet India Squadron t will be in Baghdad on February 1 Oth and I could discuss details with him if desired. Latter course would clinch matters and would ensure that the two parties met, Shether Bin Oa*ud would a wree to do so or not howefer is very doubtful, Fourthly. •In view of the above considerations | I recommend that unless the journey by sea is approved •• no reference be made to the place of racetinf; in the communication made to Bin 8a®ud and mugg#at that relevant sentence should be revised %s follows ’’They are glad to be able ' to inform you that King Hussain is willing t-o meet you find to endeavour to come to a friendly arrangement with you. The time and place of this meeting should be arranged direct with King Hussain and intimated to me for the informa- , ticm of H.M.C.* 1 1 to India Civil Commissioner'Ba :hdadHRSTranslation of a Istter datsd 16th Ja (6th Fshruary,1920), from Bin Baud to Major (Political Agsnt Bahrain) at Hmfnf. y Awwal 1358 fcmwrf, O.I.E, I bsg to rsmind you that ws convsrssd togsthsr ysstsrday and bslisving that you did not possibly understand all I said, or that I did not make myself clear, since I spoke at great length. I have thought fit to make myself clear in this letter. Firstly, ’ B; with regard Syria and Hejaz s they intriguing in a way that will grievously harm us both ( i.e. His Majesty’s Government and Bin Saud). Intrigues coming both from Turks and Arabs, these taking the form of proclamation of a Jehad. This I explained personally to you. Also how harm was coming to every one from it. Secondly , reference our condition with the Shareef : the people of lejd to- Iv day have attacked me regarding the Shareef’s doings. They say, 'You, Bin Saud, have deceived ms in religious and material matters You say firstly that the English are helping you against your enemies and will defend you against all who attack you. But we have seen nothing but the contrary. The English.have helped the Shareef with full hand, both in arms and money etc., so that he has become strong and efficient in every direction. You, Bin Saud, keep on saying that the English are only helping Shareef in order that he may help them fight the Turks. low the Turks have gone; we see the aid still being continued beyond all reason in as much as they have given the Shareef Syria as a possession, while we are prevented from touching our rightful heritage, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and other like places by your friends. Thirdly , when the Shareef assailed us through our religion ( i.e. preached that we were Kafirs) and attacked our land, and when God gave us the victory over him, your friends robbed us of the fruits of that victory. Fourthly, every day you tell us the matter will be settled by your friends and that the Shareef will be forbidden to hurt us or tresspass our lands that tha English will guarantee that we Haj Mecca freely.Yet cone of these things have happened. If your answer,0 Bin Saud, is ■l^nd the English wish to act justly or are true,now they should J B :' ♦« HHb understand(Continuation) 8. S *2. / understand the matter and maintain a proper balance^mpn&amp;us, Arabs - neither giving land nor money where th^y«gtfe no^' deserved. Otherwise, let them leave us, Arabs, to fight it out among ourselves. Those wh6 win will be their friends, those who lose let them take the eonsequences. And if you can promise us neither course, let your friends separate Syria from Hejaz, and let Syria be independant and stand alone allowing the Amir of the Hejaz no say in matters concerning it whatsoever, neither in its internal nor external affairs. For Syria is the Aorthern stage of lejd and if it remains in the Shareef*s hands it will be like a pistol at our head. If you, 0 Bin Saud, ©an obtain the above, we will believe that you are our well-wisher and that the English are our friends. If you cannot obtain this for us then we know you to have deceived us and we have to decide on some course ourselves.* I have desired to inform you the above strain in order that you can convey the contents of this letter to superior autho rity and give me an answer that will cause my mind to rest and the minds of the people of lejd. For if the business is delayed and there should arise any trouble from He jaz or Syria, however small, there will be a blaze, and I would like Hie Majesty's Government to realize that I cannot hold myself responsible. Please inform His, Majesty's Government as matter is important.SECRET BTO. 2. TO Tho Civil Commissioiadr, BAGHDAD* MEUORAIDUU ass/a _l \&gt;. Mu^erfh® 19t February la .continuation of asy talogram H«5, H-4, and H-7 datad 5th 6th and 7th February, 1980, respectively, I beg to submit this despatch which will inform you in fuller details of all Bin Baud has had to say to me* In addition to thie letter I propose submitting to you copy of my diary, kept since the day I left Bahrain which will throw additional light on the atmosphere sur- rounding me her® and on other matters to do with lejd and Hassa; | accompanying my diary will be a map of Hassa, also various sketches I and panaromas• / A Since February 4th I have had daily interviews with Bin j laud. On some days we have had two interviews* These have always I been held in private when anything has been discussed of a politi cal nature* On all occasions Bin Baud has treated me with the greatest courtesy, friendship and consideration* H# was encouragetfCj to open his mind to me and keep nothing back* I have refrained J &lt;3£-4W from submitting this report before because I desired^Bin Baud ample. opportunity of unburdening himself, and getting over his first natural restraint with me* I think I have been Justified in doing so, though I realize the inconvenience the delay in receipt ofl this report must have given you* As the days have progressed tta Bin Saud t s manner has become more and more friendly and I think he has now unburdened himself of all that he has had on his mind* B First and foremost, I should like to mention that the thing which has struck me most in conversation with Bin Baud has been the efficiency of his intelligence system* He appears to be in closest touch with Egypt, Syria, Mejaz, India, and Iraq, and there was little I could tell him which he hadA't a thorough knowledge of already, also world to impart* I gathered his agents consisted largely of the many lajdl merchants who are scattered 1 over( 2 ) over the le*r East and India. f\ T^« seeond point that struck: m# was l^^wtrlordinary affection and loyalty of Bin Saud for everything British and his almost pathetic trust that His Majesty's Government would not let him down. At the same time he seemed to be suffering from the firm f delusion that we did not understand lejd matter properly, that the f Shareef had him at a disadvantage by reason of telegraphic touch with His Majesty's Government and that London was being influenced! to an undue extent by what Cairo reported and that Cairo in turn was entirely biased in favour of the Shareef. Three things parti - eularly seemed to rankle (1) The withholding of his subsidy some time ago for two months,which showed distrust in his plighted word. (2) The heaping of honours,rewards,arms and money on the Shareef, culminating in the Royal gift of Syria. (3) The complete failure on our part .to support him when attacked by the Shareef at Turraba some time back. This ii%pite of the terms of the treaty drawn up between him and Sir P.Z.Cox G.C.S.I.,G.C.I«E., on behalf of Hie Majesty's Government 'lot only did you Eng lish fail to afford me help when attacked by an external enemy, but you actually prevent ed me from securing the fruits of my victory over that enemy after God had delivered them into my hands.' (Mis own words). C The following are the points which Bin Saud desired me j to submit to you:- He had received trustworthy information from Mecca to the effect that some 60 days ago the Sharif had held secret council) and decided to make use of the Syrian unrest to further his own ends, in the eyes of the Moslem world, and at the same time to bring about the downfall of himself (Bln Saud). As a result of the meeting the Shareef had sent trustworthy emissaries to ©araaseue with instructions to approach the Syrian furt^sh^Iationalist Party and get them to proceed on the following points •- (a) To start a Jehad movement with the object of ejecting all Christians out of Arabia speaking countries. (b) T© persuade the Moslems of Syria to appeal in a body to Bin Saud to lead the Jehad as Imam and avowed champion of a stricter and purer Islam(5) (°) Tlaj J®had having been proelaii^d,tJae Modue Operando to ba ae* folloiira :. Tha Syrians witM tbair Turkish friams to attack tha French. The Egyptian!* to co-oparata by a rising in Egypt. Tha Imam with Arabia behind him to attack Iraq. (d) Tha Shareef of Uecca t&amp; sit tight and watch events,protesting inability to control the Syrian intriguers with their Turkish friends. ^ I Bln Saud Btatad d.aign. of tk. shara.f ware evident. Me hoped either •®'broil Bin Saud with tha English if he joined the movement; (b) if he held aloof, that the people of lejd to whom the strongest appeal would be made on religious grounds by the Syrians, would tm*n against him and he would be discredited. B The people of Syria were to be strongly supported in their Jehad by the Egyptian national Party who were in closesb touch with Syria. B Bln Saud stated he was being put in a most awkward dilemma and blamed us for being the cause of the present situation of his difficulties. For in addition to the above news, his own People were accusing him of deceiving them. They were putting the blame of the Shareef , s increasing power, and the fact that he had been given Syria, down to Bin Sand's lack of influence with the English. 'England'*, they said, 'was supporting the Shareef out of continuing to support all reason and was nppsztkmgxkhnzShaxanf him, while you, 0 Bin Saud tamely submit to every order. Your supposed friends,the English, give you.

If the English are your true friends, get the English to at once guarantee in writing two things, (a) That the Shareef will no longer commit hostile acts on our frontier,and that the Status Quo thsre be definitely recognised ones and for all.(4) (t&gt;) Tla*t tfe® Holy plac®» b® throwia op®n to tk®/wh©k® of ^©Jdjat. one®, and th® ®af®ty of all I®Jd pilgrim® b® aaLurth®y ar® not willing to tak® tiiia et®p th®n l®t u® in God\s naa® fight th® Shar«®f and sottl® th® raatt®r -in our own way** F Regarding J®had qp.®Btion and Syrian problam g®n®rally Bin Saud «xpr®as®d himsalf strongly that th© ©l®ar®®t and th® b®st way of ©ount®raoting th® J®had moY®m®nt was for u® to support him now fully in d®aling with th® d®mands of his p®opl®. fh® latt®r w®r® highly diB-aatisfi®d at th® em^s® of ®v©nta in Syria and H®jaz and war® a potontial dangar in th® ®v®nt of a J®had r®ally breaking out.

Further, he supported the idea that for the future control of the Arab^speakimg race, including Egypt, a special committee should be formed consisting of a body of selected Englishmen only whose duty would be to decide future and current policy. This committee to sit in Baghdad with a lead Office in London (such as the India Office, with a Secretary of State for Arab Affairs). The present policy of dividing th© control between Egypt and Baghdad was abac* lutely fatal, and was already leading to the Arabs believing that they had 'two rival cliques of Englishmen to deal with. He quoted the familiar quotation of ’house divided against itself not being able to stand*.(5) Regarding his own personal feelings!, aims aim aspira tion®. Bin Sand stated he desired before all tl ^peaoA and friendliness with the English,but bitterly upraided kis Majesty's ', \ \ '' v ■ ; Government for negleoting^him, the true Sultan of Arabs, -and appointing the Amir of the Sejaz till lately a servant of Turkey, to be so-called king.England had not played straight with him,and in spite of Sir P.Goa's promise*'to raise him to the skiis'(his words) after the war, he found he was in exactly the same,if not in poorer, position now»a-days. Further, his loyalty to us had been strained to a great degree by the appeals of his subjects. He had been repeatedly asked to attack Mecca and Medina, but had refused owing to his plighted word to us. Daily, and in a way against his will, his power as Imam and leader of Islam was in creasing! this fact increased his difficulties in stead of decreas —; ing them. From all sides he was receiving letters offering support as the one kmmm true leader and champion of Islam left in the £ world. Egypt, Gman^Kadramaut-Yemen, Trucial coast tribes,Shsmmar Anzs and even the Inhabitants of Mecca and Medina themselves were X writing and profering aid • He was steadily refusing to answer any letters from the people who were. .with the English. (IOTE) I have myself seen two letters from the Idrisi and Imai ■ Yahya\ of Yemen to Bin Saud greeting him in Affectiw%£terma and asking that teachers of Akhwanlsm be sent to Utm them. It is urgent that England support him now both from his and her point of view. And as a primary move he urged that His Majesty's Government grant his demands as per (a) (b) para E. If His Majesty* J pfl- . . 1 ■ . t *** Government would only agree to this he would satisfy his peopls 1 on the one hand and could safely be trusted to refuse all Syrian and Egyptian offers. lay, further he was prepared to Champion the English in the eyes of Islam, and would guarantee under the above condition to keep entire peace in Arabia. He earnestly begs Englan&lt; J li realize that she has a great friend and admirer in' him. The Moslem | world was asking him to champion them. He desired to remain Eng land^ friend.

(f) Taraba was an important town strategically and com manded the road to Yemen and Duwasir, In hand® of the Shareef it would form an invaluable base for any future operation against lejd# For this reason, if for no other lejd could not tolerate it in any other hands but its own, £ The Akhwan, Bin Baud has much to say regarding this movement in general. The movement he maintained was directly due to God moving men's hearts. Me himself was the leader and Imam and entirely associated himself with the Akhwans* religious belief! * I am the Akhwan* he saidsftlur tenets consist of two essentials (a) Belief and worship of One True God (b) Brotherhood among all True Moslems.' Bin Saud said the movement affected the Beduln^ to an extraordinary way. They were filled with religious zeal, and continually write begging to have teacher® sent them. Bin Saud • * said he was sending men to instruct them as fast as he could find them. This principal method for guiding the movement and keeping it under control was 'City building'.

' Najed Mission was received at Foreign Office on 26th November by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before whom they said Your Excellency’s requests. Lord Ourzon welcomed Mission most sympathetically and discussed whole situation wlthHitm with utmost candour and goodCwill as you will see from the report of the proceedings copy ; of which was handed to Mission at this Important interview. Lord Ourzon explained orally to your representatives that His Majesty’s Government desires above all things that harmony should replace discord in Arabian politics. His Majesty’s Government are ' persuaded that if this end is to be attained first essential is that yourself and King Husain the two most powerful rulers of .Arabia should live at peace with one another. But good understanding must be preceded by peaoe^and good understahl ing is thus achieved when friends meet together face to face to compose their differences. His Majesty’s Government desires therefore that a greeting (meeting ) should take place as soon as possible between you and King Husain for the purpose of settling amicably all outatandinsr disputes. They feel confident that Your Excellency who has always shown yourself ready to follow their guidance in thtsematterywill gladly agree to their present proposal. They are glad to be able to inform you that King Husain is willing to meet you and to endeavour to come to a friendly arrangement with you. His Majesty’s Government strongly advise you as your sincere friend and well-wisher to seize this opportunity of affecting a friendly settlement and to make arrangements accordingly^ T ui • none.

You will bear in mind when pressing this solution on him that His Majesty’s Government attach great importancejmeeting between King Husain and Bin Baud and that latters visit to Hasa affords an opportunity that is not likely to recur not only of influencing him effectively but of ensuring that he actually sets out on journey. If Bin Baud definitely negatives idea of meeting Sharif at Jeddah please sound him unofficially as to whether he would agree to a meeting with Sharif at Aden or Cairo. You should however do your best to induce him to accept meeting at Jeddah. As regards requests contained in your telepram/Sth February please inform Bin Baud that it has been transpitt ed to His Majesty’s Government for their favourable consideration. If he meets King Husain I feel sure many difficulties will disappear. Not only such a meeting will increase my own ability to help him in future but it will predispose His Majesty’s Government to give favourable consIderat&gt;ionto the requests urged in your telegram 5th February.Talegran Proa To Didsfckdn*! ^aBrain Political, Baghdad.

In aooordano© with my tele crams 11.5 and H. 10 dated 6th and iSth February sent from Hassa, I bew to report that I left Hoffuf on the 14th February and returned to Bahrain arriving-at the latter place on the evening of the Ifth February. The sea passage from 0jair took 93 hours, and it was with th© greatest difficulty we fetched up at Bahrain owing to the strong Shamal that was blowing. ✓ 2. Bin Baud who had received me all the time I was in Hoffuf with th© consideration due to a Royal personare almost, has been kindness and thoughtfulness itself. From the time I left Bahrain until 1 returned again, all expenses incurred in such matters as transport, food, and house rent, have been born by him. What expenditures 1 incurred myself is shown on attached statement which is forwarded for your approval and sanction. 3. Before I left Hoffuf Bln Baud at a final interview asked me to convey the following to His Majesty’s Government through you. He explained that it was the advice of an old and sincere friend of Great Britain And it was the ’’atrairht talk” of a simple and plain speaking man. He meant it from his heart and hoped no offence would be taken. ^ \ The advice was given in th® first person-and was as near as possible in the following words. (a). Grant Syria independance if you can see your way to do so at once otherwise you English should yourselves rule over her destinies but with strong firm hand, standing no nonsence of any kind from her people. In aay case if the Shareef retainshis hold over Syria or she is granted autonomy never let the Arabs get hold of the sea-port town of Beyrout. y 000 ^ ' 1 ' (to) Beware of granting any form of self novjpjnwent t&lt; Iraq* Should you do so you will live to rue the Astifpfg British Government in Iraq is, and always will toe, the kindest and toast form of Government for that country. If you grant her freedom (hurriyeh) to manage her affaire under your guidance then you will have a second Egypt. If you go away altogether, Iraq will have civil war and will wallow in her own tolood till rwy some one stronger like Mias ©If comes and eats her up. (o) Don’t listen to Egypt’s ory for freedom, give them the sword with your right hand and Justice with your left. The Egyptians were disturtoers of the peace ever since the days of Pharoh the persecutor. (d) Beware of the Shareef. Re pose® as your friend. His heart is tolaok and on the first opportunity he will turn against you. (e) /'gust me Bin Baud your old friend more. You have no more loyal friend in the whole of the Mohomedan world, toy influence today Is stronger than any other Mahoraedan ruler either spiritual or temporal - At present you are doing all you can to hurt the feelings of one who wishes to remain your best friend. The un- kindest out of all is your attempt to put me on a par with and even counting me a smaller man than the Amir Hussain of HeJaz, a man whom I despise and all Islam hates today. (f). The people of Egypt, He Jag. and Syria and certainly the majority of people of Arabia have invited me to assume the role, of their ruler and leader of Islam, now the Sultan of Turkey is no more. His Majesty’s Government should believe that I have no such ambition to take up such a thankless burden. On the contrary I should dislike to rule over so called Moslems, who refuse to obey the very wor^of God In matters of smoking, drinking and general behaviour. Such Moslems are all Kafirs to me and are on a par with Shiahs,Jews and Mushriks. My first act were I to rule over the Moslems of Arabia as a whole would be to order all to discontinue smoking and drinking. They would have toto obey God*a ordinances as expounded by the Imam Bayed Ahmecf in the Salefi doctrine or suffer the penalties laid dpwnJby Sharia Law. (g) Finally don’t your British Government of the Abbasyde Khalifas who considered it true 'siyasi” to estrange their friends and cultivate their enemies, by con cessions and bribery attempted to appease the latter. The day cams when their enemies (who never could be friends 5 turned against them and their friends (who had been wounded by care less treatment) deserted them in a body. hods Major, O.I.R., Political Agent, Bahrain.

Carpets had been spread on^ a hill overlooking] the town and we were refreshed by sweetmeats and coffee. The first sight of Hassa resembles that of Damascus though net to ; fine. It is an emerald in a se11ing^e11oand^whi1e in the centre rises the massive though low mountain of GARA. Hature of country crossed . After Braiman sand dunes were less frequent and we came across regular continuous^ firm depressions which made going easy for our camels. 5 miles before reaching Subkha one came upon wide gravelly plain with I little sand patches in the middle, this depression or plain afforded good grazing for camels. High sand dunes were visible^.] to north and South, about 5 miles distance. At Subkha water was found everywhere at two feet from surface. It wss driKkablell but very salty. Al - 'Subkha is long flat depression about six miles in length covered for about 4 miles with water to depth I of 4 inches. This is rain water, but is not sweet owing to salty nature of sand. Whenever there is rain, I was told, this depression fills wifch water. My escort tell me that three days, ago depth of water was 2 feet. Just before reaching Hassa, the I sand dunes once again assume enormous proportions, their shape I being horseshoe-like ,bh&amp;s. For first sight of Hassa^see slietchl» r— The city is built as per rough sketch below/?' ias m •9 K„A- (P') t ^ — i } (JWw rr an outer wall/ an innei* wall enclosing the ^Go^ernmoit quarter and an inner keep enclosing the great mosque* It must have been quite a et- strong place originally when Bin Saud captured Hufuf. He got over wall on dark night at points XXX using rope etc. Sentries on wall were alert but not heeding their shots the storming party olimed over the walls and gained possession of the inner enclosure. Bin Baud’s ^r^oe is said to have been 5,000 men* The alarmed garrison bolted into the keep. The next thing that happened was the City ^ £.A surrendering after which the garrison followed suit. The Wali A the General Officer Commanding force with about 1,000 men were given 5 days to auction their effectsi This they did and marched out with their rifles and accoutrements They were escorted to Ojair by Bin Saud. This coup de main from all accounts was a well thought out and cleverly carried out movement. After entering the town we lunched and dined with Ibn Jiluvi both meals being of the usual Arab type. The Amir himself refused to eat with us in spite of being pressed. Immediately after each meal, the party dismissed and contrary to all Arab Custom not even coffee was served. Bin Jfcluvl adopts an untidy dirty garb Probably in imitation of Akhwan his Agal was torn and his Abba old and shabby. He is in looks and manner of speach rather like Khayun al Obeid of Shatra except that he has a full beard. Bin Jiluvi struck me as a good type of the Arab strong man. He has a Jovial Jolly countenance. PEBRUHRY Srd . Spent morning receiving guests and callers, Sent ParhanFarhan al Bahama to pay respects to Amir./ had slight fever&gt; he is staying with Malpmed EjV$ndi Chief Treasury Officer. Latter has been^jt looking after my interests and comforts he is always in attendance and cannot do enough. If he is not present one Abdullah Iffendi an ex-Turkish Official of Kurdish orisift does the needful. The latter is married to Mahomed Effendi‘s daughter. Abdullah Iffendi is very polished, speaks good French, has distinctly French mannerisms. Might easily be French man in disguise. Says he was in Medical Branch Turkish army before war. Studied in Paris, afterwards came Basrah where he left Military and became Civil surgeon infectious hospital. Says he toured irejd with philby and Colonel Ounliffe-Owen, also met Colonel Hamilton at Qasira. Rather a suspicious looking individual but pleasing of speech. At S P.M. took walk round city with Qusaibi. At 5 p.M. called on Amir, where came across several Akhwan. These refuse to return salaams and cover their faces as you enter with their hands in most disconcerting manner, they of mm course refuse also to rise. Awkward situation for Amir - As one sat down Akhwan rudely got up and left room mutter ing audible curses. I was told these particular individuals (who all wore white turbans) were the Shaikh of the Qahtan Faisal ibn Hashar by name, Abd Mana Shaikh of the Shamir section of the A Jinan. I am trying to find out all about these gentry and will report results in asperate note. The Akhwan leader is Abdul Kerim al Mughrabl and resides at ARTAWIH&amp;U The Qadhi of Hiadh one Abd el Latif is also a strong member of the Akhwan. Cold very great here slight frost last night. Trying after Bahrain. Af 8.SO P.M. was visited by Wazir or Private Secretary of the Imam one Mahomed ibn oaleh ibn S halhoot* he is reported to be a native of Riadh but I suspect him of being a man of Mosul. Tall very voluble, polite and in hard condition. Wears full Badouln costume. He was sent ahead to inform me that the ImamImam Bin Saud was expected the following da^C H^Said ▼ery heary rains were encountered on the iM,y frlaa f! liadh. Everywhere in Hejd rains have been abunda^^Bin iud is well and oomes with 500 to 1,000 men and a oouple of sogs. After he went Qusaibi told me the story of how Bin Saud captured Hufuf fmdf Eiadh. Both were clever strokeSjHufuf*s capture a regular military coup de main, proving the Imam to be by no means a bad leader* FEBRUARY 4th. Spent quiet morning receiving callers. Bin Saud arrived 2.50 P.M. Sent word that he would receive me at once. Paid official call at 5 p.M. He is splendid man, completely overshadows all his followers. I should say he was man of strong character and overweening ambition. Saw many Akhwan in his train. Wild looking individuals who do not deign to return a salaam but cover their faces with both hands as you pass. It is well for me I am under Bln Saud’s protection. I would not trust myself a yard with some of his crew. Bin Saud after a few words of welcome, began a sermon in theatrical style speaking towards me but obviously for the benifit of his people. He took the Turk, for his text, and quoted the Koran and the various Caliphs over and over again. The Turks were this, were that, were everything elset It was Interesting to see how every word that fell from his lips, was lite rally drunk in by his followers. It is clear that Bin Saud, whatever his real belief is - absolutely leads, and leads under the name of Religion • He explained how Nejd, the home of the Arabs and of the pure-bred, and only true Moslems, was the chosen of God. God^ will was that those Moslems who had strayed from the path, here he mentioned Koweit, Hejaz, Syria, were to be brought back to the fold through the pure teachings and influence of Hejd and the Akhwan. The whole scene reminded me of the Sannusi and one of their religious meetings which I once attended, but it was grander and finer. Bin Saud then turned to me andand Bald 'perhaps you English don’t know ^i|the|Al|wan are'. I am the Alhwan' he shouted, and I am the slave of Sod the most meroifuli Hie dramatic finish wal reo^fred with muroers of 'Allah i towil amarak ya etc. fte.' I left Bin Saud at about 4.15, and at 4. So he returned my call. Most gracious he was to me and quite different from the bigot of half an hour before. He discoursed on most things but through it all ran the vein that he believed he was the Hedeemer of Islam. I have never seen Bin Saud before, but his beard is quite long now and I am told he looks much older. He certainly is a man every inch of him, and has a delightful smile which he continually uses. He is the type of man that makes simple men go mad. On this return visit Bin Saud sat a full hour talking on various subjects. FEBRUARY 5th. At 9.80 A.M. I called again on Bin Saud. The room was full of visitors. Shaikhs of all the tribes around. Bin Saud told me the Ajman were present there but not all. He hoped soon to see ibn Hathlain. ( it was a false story which said he had already come in). He believed the latter would be in very shortly. He had been asked to pardon the whole tribe and he had decided to do so. He discoursed on the wonderful civilizing influence at work in Rejd. The Akhwan movement had been responsible for close on 50 new cities, each ranging from 8,000 to 50,000 Inhabitants. Bod was truly working a miracle he said. Raiding, killing, stealing etc. etc were all done and finished with. On all sides letters were pouring in asking him to lead the new movement into new countries. Hadraraant, Yemen, Oman, Trucial Ooast, Anazi, and Shammar^had he said all sent letters offering their services, all wished to become Akhwan. 1, 2, 5, 4 he had not answered remembering his friendship with us 5 and 6 he had answered offering all and sundry an^ asylum in Nejd if they would Join the movement of God. He said most of the Shammar had joined thethe faith and were now building ©ities.^filCL Raolkd himself friendliest of terms with Bin Raohid he saidland the latta» had agreed that those Shammar who oared to 'Tadaiyan' and build ©ities oould recognize Bin Baud, as their spiritual head and he wouldnt object* I recognized of course that for the public ears. He said that 500,000 rifle men were now at his beck and call: He had only to say 'Jehad' and the whole of Arabia would blaze. ( I saw a Teiled threat in this) At the end of the meeting I asked for a private interview. This was at once granted. I conversed for 3 hours on confidential matter. This conversation will be reported separately. I left the audience chamber ai 1 p.M. a&amp;d at 5 rode to the hot springs 4 miles from Hufuf. A pretty sight. Water quite hot many people bathing ineluding several pretty women discretely grabed. At 5 p.M.I returned to write my despatch to Baghdad. Most difficult.to put all Bin Baud said in report form. He dealt with so many subjects and talked such a lot. Hufuf is now full of the wildest ■£ tkn looking Badouin I have ever set eyes on. They are mostly J^an^sir, Al Murrah Bani Yas, Banl Ha Jir t and Qahtan tribesmen. Wilder than anything I have yet seen. My presence in Hufuf of course causes much gossip and not a little sfcmntfg staring. Bin Baud and Bin Jftluvl are kindness itself, and could not be more hospitable. I am allowed to purchase nothing in the food line and an armed guard and 5 personal servants are at my disposal from morning till night. Qusaibi also cannot do enough for me. Yusuf Kanoo Jve*b | is a beat in himself? FEBRUARY 6th. Again spent quiet morning working at telegrams. In afternoon Imam called on me and sat for 1 hour explaining his methods of Government, and telling me of his wars with and a few of his people still lived as bedouin s|id could not be persuaded to Join the chosen of God. ^e was on the a great deal of his big talk was ' hakkl dlwan i.e., meant Bin7 , Bin Raohid the Turks and reoaloitran&amp;^r&amp;bs ♦.Ris story of Batin between Kuwait and Hail as a bait f|&gt;r Bin Raohid. He knew the latter was moving to round him up, he himself with 40 men by long and strenuous marching one fine day fetched up at Riadh. He entered the town secretly ani seized the house next to that in which was the wife of the Commander of the castle. That night his party entered the ladies house and occupied it till dawn. At 6.50 A.M. the castle gate opened and the Amir or Commander came out, and after looking at horses strolled towards his ladies house. Bin Saud then rushed out and followed the Amir as he entered the castle, killing him on door step forcing an entrance over his dead body* The capture of Hufuf has been described above so I wont repeat it. In tribal raids Bin Saud said he been as far as Jebel Akhdar Oman ; and several times to JabrlvC Oasis chiefly in pursuit of the A1 Hurrah, the toughest lot he had to . crack. They were accustomed Vq when pursued to move right away into the Rubah al Khali and for months and months never drank water only camel milk etc. etc. He told me that among these tribes paying Zikat were the Mahnasir Bani Yas, and Al All of Oman. By paying Zikat they got protection from their enemies. This was one of Bin Saud * a strong points. The Ajman he hoped would soon be in. Regularly, traders he said came from HadramaHt and Yemen via Hejran and many / 4ere the letters from Oman, Truolal Coast, Hadramant 'f offering realty. He had answered none owing to his friend ship with England. The Anaze had recently written him offering homages The fact that he insisted on the purest form of Mahomedanism, and enforced Sherla Law in its fullest extent was drawing all to his standard he said. In the evening I dined with Bin Saud and found him as charming a host as few could find in the would. Prom the captures of Riadh and Hufuf were ver former ran as follows. He left his stand beginningtosgimixng to end lie showed me nothing bjit-equrti I am distinotly impressed# As a man and a rulier* over the heads of his people# He is a remarMabl^ dual and bom leader. lirti email j ambit lone ; ti ehoxild eay. Me eearoely knows his limitations! the danger is that he will be carried away by the Religions frenzy of hie Akhwan. He outwardly appears a fanatic. It is difficult to say if he is really such a person* FEBRUARY 7th* Friday interviewed the Imam at 2.50* Talked on all subjects. His attachment for us English is almost pathetic. He says continually that we have not supported him enough against Shareef. And the gift of Syria to Shareef is making him very sore. 'Oh if you English would only allow me to carve out my fortune by the sward, I would have Hejaz inside a week and Syria within 2 months, and then what a friend you would have in me you English', he said. la the evening I went for walk round the town. I found and visited an Akhwan encampment. They looked a poor decent looking sort of Bedouin, but all refused to salaam and hung their heads or covered their faces as I passed. All were well armed either with Mauser, Manlh#h#r or .505 rifles. Cartridges all of pointed bullet kind. They wore the white turban over their kuffaiyah. FEBRUARY 8th. Sunday, m the morning I ealled on Shaikh Mohamed al Saud brother of the Imam. Fine physique but dull. After wards called on Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Mahomed Imam’s sons. Abdullah had too muoh say for himself* the small boy was charming. 12 Noon went to ^usalbi’s gardens and had anuh lunch and tea. Delightful spot. Manager Saji Ibrahim al Qusaibi, unale of Abdul Aziz. The garden contained fruit of every d&amp;soription and several rice fields? Sardens in Hassa are beautifully kept. FEBRUARY 0th. Visited imam 8.So P.M. sat till prayer time.

Sh^ and lie! husband have plenty of work to keep them oooupied in Hufuf. FBBRUARY 10th. fendi. I visited the Imam at 8.150 A.H. and sat till 9.50. Imam was in very good form. Full Majlis. Ajman Shaikhs ware again i there all had oorae in to ask forgiveness. Bin Saud explained I that they deserved to be killed for all their misdeeds and their trsobery in Bin Rashid*a war, in the Hassa war and then for taking refuge in Kuwait territory. He was however willing to forgive all the past, but Bin Hathlaim must oome in. A special messenger was sent to bring him. The AJman question seems now nearly settled. To-day I was introduced to the Amir of Qassim. Afterwards the Imam ■ counted and gave me names of 55 new cities built? by Akhwan : He told me that Ridden Walad, Sehall of Haraala al Suvait of Dhafit had come to see him aflso that Ralal bin Misiar al Suwait and Asi al Suwait with 10 men had settled in Riadh ae Akhwan. He praised the British for refusing to give sanotury to Ajman near Safwan. He said A results are best proof of British policy! Ajman were now all anxious to come in. He claimed that all the Bedouin tribes (Sadia) of Arabia were now under his protection and acknowledged him, excepting his good friends the Dhafir who were definitely under English and were recognized as such by him. At xo.SO. A.M. w®oeived in my house an .colTAbd al Aziz Al Quaaibi, Yusuf Kanoo, Fahad al Bassam, Mahomed al Fahad al Bassam, Shaikh Jassim of Darin and several pro minent merchants. Afternoon received call from Bin Saud who sat for one hour, afterwards went to Hot springs (Sulphwe) at Ain Nejin 5 miles If .W. of Hufuf. Wonderful sight. Could scarcely bear finger in water. Olimed hill A 400 ft.400 ft. Mgh M.W. of town 5 railoa away, ggt-^pl^n?trf*viww of whole of laasa oaaia, took aketohea ofac^ne evening I dined with Harrisons* FEBRUARY. 11th.

I gather that M^omed al Bassam in Oamasous is the source from which Bin Baud gets all his Syrian news, also that much Turkish ammunition has been recently received by Bin Saud from Damascus. To-day Family appear devoted to Bin Saud who recently helped them out of financial diffi culties. Mahomed in Damasous might be watched. After my call, I spent half an hour with Bin Saud over the great gate overlooking the market. Bin Saud .was very oor- teous and asked much after Mr.philby. Discussed Bedouin customs, features and racial traits of the wild tribes of Hassa. FEBRUARY. 12th. Hejd mission arrived. Bin Saud greatly elated at his sons return and at his appearance generally. The letter^ of King George gave him infinite pleasure, and he made me read it several times. The iarring note was not however abAeat. Bin Saud after reading the Motes of a Conversation between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Arabian mission representing Bin Saud (Dated 26th November 1919) an Arab copy of which Ahmed bin Thanaiyan had brought, became very despondent. He sent for me, and I have not found him so down in th&lt;§ mouth before. He commenced by saying that he hadafc said his prayers that morning, nor had he paid attention to the sermon in the Mosque. He made meme read the notea,and I think he had region Ito Jfe deapondent. Lord Ourson’a remarks were unnecessary I tMnk^^ing that the Turraba and Kurraa aubjeot ia atill 'sutl Judioe”. i am sure the notes would not have been given if the result here oould have been foreseen. The net result is that Bin Saud is more oonvinoed than ever that the Home Government is listening to talk from Kgypt and not from Mesopotamia, (Ms words). He is oonvinoed his backing in London is poorer than that of the Shareef. He is very bitter today. His bitterns® may be embodied in the following. (1) He knows now Shareef gets £.20,000/- Why should he not get same he says. (2) Bin Thanaiyan states their reception was not nearly so muoh advertised as was that of Amir Faisal bin Hussain. Why)says Bin Saud. (5) He says he is quite sure that Kgypt f s Oounoils are heard in London and those of Mesopotamia and India are not. The above are,he says the rewards of his obeying the wishes of His Majesty*a Government Shis keeping quiet, and asking Baghdad to fight his battles. The policy of shouting from the Housetops and self-advertisement is obviously the (Jvv£ ury&amp; beet A . Ahmed bin Thanaiyan regaled the Imam with many stories ; a few of his ideas are worth repeating. He was full of Mr. Montagues great^ness^and his love for Moslems. He had everything bad to say of Lord Ourson. Major Young, D.S.O, who acted as interpreter was without taot, was rude and prejudiced in favour of the Shareef. He (bin Thanaiyan) Os asked for Philby to interpret, but was rudely refused, and Major Young was introduced instead, the moment that Officer opened his mouth and spoke of the Shareef as ' Saiyidina* * ha at &lt;m®@ aofcgrad iiim up^ lie said# The above la the type of news that Bin Sau&amp; simply drank in.

We spent night at Jisheh , where we again were hospitably received by Amir Ali. On morning 15th we started at 7. A.M. and travelling fast reached Qjair sun down. 8.50 P.M. a good 40 miles very tired, most of journey was done at jog-trot which on Dromedaries is none too comfortable. Incidentally one of the Escort Marzuk by name was the Ghief executioner in Hnssa | He told me Ibn Jiluvl had fixed Thursday's for executions. These were done in public in the Market place and the body left till might-fall. He himself had decapitated 22 men and had out off the hands of scores. The latter process he grimly said did not hurt but what did make men cry out was putting the severed stump into boiling fat. Marsuk believed the fact that executions had become rare these days, owing to the p&amp; fear with which Ibn Jftluvi was held. One interesting story he told me typical of Bin Jlluvi's methods. A man came and reported to Bin £ftluvi that he had seen a bag of coffee lying on high road betweenwretched man, aaid I kicked the hag and so coffees well then said Ibn Jiluvi 'Baiifebe curious in future and kick any more bags in the Imams highcway, off with his right big toe w .

MEMORANDUM I hog to attach for your information original copy ofl a note given to me by Bin Baud on the day I left Hasa i.». 14-2-20 together with an English translation of the same. The note is not dated signed or sealed because Bin Baud intended it to be more of a kinflL of review of his case as verbally discussed between him and myself. He had hoped that I would have been able to proceed to Baghdad to talk the matter over with you personally. There is nothing new in the which has not alreidy been conveyed to you by telegram or recent corres pondence. The last paragraph with its veiled threat of Jehad is Interesting. I am sending a copy to the Deputy Political Resident for his personal information. £ Major, O.I.E*, Political^Agent, Bahrain* Copy to the Deputy Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf, 4 * 1 ** BushlreTranslation of a not® da tod jamadl-al~Awwalf 12538 ( February,1920) given personally by Bln Sand to Major H.R.P.DiokBon* G.I.B.f In H&amp;sa# I bav® the honour to state that you honoured me with your visit and we discussed with each other the circumstances which I regard with apprehension and which Interest both sides. I may also mention that as you hear ay son Faisal has returned from his journey on this date and has expressed deep gratitude to His Majesty the King Emperor and His Majesty's Government j for the great regard and kindness shown him for which I offer my thanks to His Majesty the King Emperor and His Majesty's I Government. I oonvsrsed with them (Nejd Mission) in connexion with the dlsoussions they had with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Right Honourable Lord Curzon, and my cousin and representative Ahmad Al-Thanyan As Baud informed me regarding the negotiations which took place between him and the aforesaid of which you took a copy* After a conversation between me and the above mentioned, owing to some words, in the conversation which took place between him and the Secretary I B ®i 1 ^ ■ v' ^Foreign Affairs, I was rather sorryand my mind forbade me to do anything until I discuss and exchange views with the honour able Colonel Wilson, Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, on this subject. The questions which made discussions difficult for me are firstly, the question of 'Tarabah' and 'Khurma'} because Hi Government Officials allege having evidence of Shareefs possession of these} secondly, the Interpreter who used to inter I pret during the time the meeting was held between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Mission was one taking the side of the Shareef, so that they even noticed excessive severe words in the discussions; thirdly, regarding the subsidy:(It . said was^)* We wont help you until you compromise with the Shareef. As regards what they Witnessed with their own eyes in the papers published under the signatures of the Officials of Egyptian Government, the whole of the news was about the Shareef and his statements and actions, of which the least is truth and the 1greater part is falsehood. Just like his own publications. They did not see any mention of my actions which I took for my friend the High British Government. My actions, as I explained to your honour, ever since the time of my occupation about IB years ago, I have been communicating with the officials of the High British Government in the Persian Gulf, and the Turks bore me grudge and then they tried their best with Ibn Rashid and sent out troops with him and helped him financially in those days until he made them clear away and eradicated their rule from Arabian Peninsula and they helped Ibn Rashid with military forces, money, guns and ammunition. They also helped Shareef and moved^againet ray Hajd territories and the neighbourhood, and this is not hidden from the High Government* As I made friendship with the High British Government,! had the honour to interview the Honourable, the then Chief Poli tical Officer, Sir Percy Cox, and concluded a treaty with him.He then requested me to fight Ibn Rashid in order that he may not help the Turks and also when disputes arose between me and the Shareef, as it is well known to the Honourable, the Chief Poli tical Officer, Sir Percy Cox, he ordered me to desist from those disputes for the sake of the High British Government and therefore every thought or action that was excercising my mind was controlled and I began to help him in his fight against the Turks, and did my best to see that Ibn Rashid did not attack the Shareef in Madina* furthermore, in accordance with a re quest from His Honour, I went to Basrah in order to confirm and strengthen my friendship with the High British Government and it was well-known to every body that I took a part in this great war and I complied with all the hints and suggestions of the above-mentioned officer and when I returned to my territories I ordered all Ifajdis to help the Shareef when the Shareef had only a small number of men to help him. The best tribes of Hajd are Ataibah, Harb and Mutalr together with the people of Qaeim and they helped the Shareef and all the troops in battle-fields under his command and that of his son were composed of my8utoj«et8» and J prevented Ibn Rashid from taking ths offsnslvs against the Shareef, tint 11 I brought to my side the whole tribe of Sharamar who left Ibn Rashid alone at *Al«Hajr &lt; * with only 800 men* An arrangement then took place between Shammar and myself to the effect that if Ibn Rashid returned from Rajr they would fight with me and would follow the commands of the High British Government. I,therefore* desisted from attacking 'Hall* for this reason* in accordance with the agreement which was eonelud- ii e&amp; between me and Shammar in order to bring the whole lot to our side politically* When Mr* Pfeilby came to me after his return from journey in my territories he Informed me that Government directs me to declare war against Ibn Rashid in order that I may be included among the Allies and my assistance to the Shareef may also appear, which suggestion I welcomed and accordingly declared war and sent out troops t© attack “Ball*, and when Ibn Rashid was badly pressed and the fall of 'Hall' was imminent Mr* Philby Informed me that Government forbids me from fightiHg#*Ibn Rashid which made me feel astonished as to how I should give up my policy then and follow Government’s orders which forbid me from further fighting* Then myself and Mr* Pfeilby returned with the hope that we would get an answer to our communication but we saw no result* 'Furthermore,, when the Shareef made an aggression after the fall of Madina, I informed Colonel Wilson several times that the Shareef intends to trespass upon the boundaries of my territories and I received a reply from him stating that It was impossible and that it shall not occur* but then the Shareef committed an aggressive act and I informed him accord ingly several times, but 1 received no answer* When the Shareef advanced on to *Tarabah*, and there was some deficiency In the fight, the Inhabitants not having sufficient force, as their men were scattered about, and,consequently, the Shareef was able to occupy that town* He, afterwards, persecuted the In habitants in ' the manner the Turks persecuted the Armenians whiofv made them to cry out and* excited the inhabitants of the valleywho wore In their violnity whom God helped against him and made him run away and they took back 'Tarabah' and I went to it. and I received a letter from His Majesty's representative at Jeddah which was not fit t© be addressed to me from the High Government. Then I returned and informed all the people in Hajd that Hie Majesty's Government requested me to withdraw as the Shareef had begged them, and I was not expecting from Government except two things I firstly* that they would remonstrate with the Shareef for his aggressive acts againet ray territories; me j -p secondly, that they would help/in accordance with the treaty concluded between them and myself; but I saw nothing of this. On the contrary, they stopped the subsidy about which every body came to know. Furthermore, last year we Intended to proceed to Mecca for the performance of *HAJ' (pilgrimage), which Is one of the most important duties of a Moslem, but the High Govern ment requested me to give up the Intention, which I did for theirs j sake only, and postponed it forthe next year, and afterwards gave it up entirely owing to Government having been very busy with War and Peace affairs. On the return of my son, Faisal A1 Abdul Asiz and Ahmad Al Thanyan from their journey, they submit ted to me copy of the conversation, and informed me that they did not notice any mention of me. in those quarters. This really displeased me and it is not through any fear of my reputation or any covetousness for the world that 1 desire this. My honour and reputation is patent to all, high and low, and as for means of living, Almighty God alone 1® responsible therefor; but then I percieved disregard and coolness increasing in regard to all questions and rap assistance and actions during the Great War wereH not mentioned any where, a® 1 have stated above, while the actionsij of others are mentioned in every conference and assembly of His Majesty's Government. I am, therefore, afaraid that lest, by negligence, any harm should occur or any evil movement should take place which 1 have explained to your honour now. God be praised l I am not afraid of the enemy; but you know that the Arabs have rules and laws respecting their religion and their worldly affairs for15 f fill tru ittfi f '■^1; \15 &gt; \ a '-x w | \ L/ J n»gl«ct of which they beeomo impatient if anj^ ofthe same are 1 ignored.

And J am afraid if the matters whichfij are pending between me and the Shareef are not settled with ex i| treme hurry, then the ^enjoined in our religion (JEHAD) might take place. 1© one has ooveted my country, which is ray own from early days and now If anything untoward takes plaoe, the respon sibility might be laid at ray door, or I might be considered in sincere by my friends, the High Government, I have, however, full trust that your honour will put before Colonel Wilson the above noted statement.Telos rajI1 From - political, Bahrain.

I forward to you the exacl copy of the telegram containing the 'hews. It was sent to me bji Colonel Wilson. You will see from £he telegram that both the Amirs Faisal and Abdullah are not only playing a stupid childish gsmax and decitful game | but also acting with the height of impudence. For Amir Faisal to crown himself King of Syria and Abdullah to call himself King of Iraq without J regard to consequences^ and in the presence of an ignorant and sslf-con- -stituted assembly is like unto the acts of tlr® children whey playing on the sea—shore^ build themselves a castle of sand when the tide is out. They sit inside this castle of theirs and call themselves kings and princes, but they forget the tide has yet to come inland when it does where will they and their castlek be. Either they wipl remain sitting in it until they are overwhelmed by the waiters, and are utterly destroy-! or they will desert their castles and flee for safety to the 'barrjj I In either case their castle is destroyed and they make themselves the laughing-stock of the lookers-on. In the present instance^ the lookers rulers of the -on are the noble/Arab race and the tide the High government with its allied friends. However, the acts of both the Amirs Faisal and Abdullah || l®hould not cause alarm, but simply amusement. Other affairs of the ifOrld are normal. There is nothing of any import to tell you.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government might think that I had personal reasons for so doing, or that I was afraid of ray enemies* But sheer necessity makes me address your honour on this subject. You know ray love for the § * v Great Government is based on community of interests, because ill „ x cannot imagine, nor can any sane person, that the exist- 11 ence of an Arab Government can ensure the position and con- ||| trol of this (Arabian) Peninsula, and its surrounding terri tories and watersIV - 2 * 1111 wi SHI 111 II 1 III 111 Amd It is also patent and s®lf-evidAt to jase and in *Z4jUj)C4j.'£n, \ to any one possessing reason that the weakening of the- &amp;\/1*/ ( A*t-*^&gt;* 4**) British control sea and of maritime countries and the consequent entr^ the Arabs into alliance with Turks and their friends the Germans, is one of their misfortunes, and ♦ill cause their ruin, including myself* For this reason it is incumbent upon me to endeavour to secure and further her (British Government’s) interests in this Arabian Penin sula generally, and in Central Arabia particularly. I shall continue to do this until and unless I see two things ; firstly, in-attention (of Government) to what I say; secondly,| if I find that my honour and position are at stake. Then only shall I be absolved and will prefer death to life, for I know too well that my interests are bound up in union with | the Great Government. And this is what makes me determined to do my utmost to the best of my power and understanding. Now I shall submit t© your honour the following suggestions :«* Firstly, donot take lightly what people say and do not place your reliance in the inhabitants of Syria and neighbouring countries, or in the self-styled kings - they cannot have good ideas and aims or any thing that will have the result. But,on the contrary, be sure that they are like blind man gone astray, unable to see and having no sense to stop, till at last they fall into a ditch. Secondly, weigh the sayingsof some of the ancient Arab learned men. They were asked as to the causes of the downfall of the Abbaside Empire, and the reply was,'They took their enemies for their friends, and honoured and favoured them in the hope of wining^ A-'/ - and -eti-4 the same time left their friends at a distance, trust-1 ing in their friendship. When the hour of need came, they farani found that their former friends’hearts had been estranged and j the enemies found an opportunity for achieving their aims and 1 succeeded.’’ IP1 Now, it is quite clear to your honoxlr t^at'Ymjr Govt* . : 1 has mo batter frieMd f among European PowareAthawf Franca; \ so, domot let her he played with by Syrians, hut do,all you can, to strengthen the bonds of unity with her, so that there may not he the least doubt in her mind from your side, for your enemies will increase hy her weakness. At the same time, the British Government has no sincere friend among the Arabs, except myself, whose personal interests are strong ||| Consider the matter before anything happens, and bridge the gulf before it widens. The solution of this problem is ||| easy enough for the Great Government and her ally (France) if they consider the matter and co-operate, taking wise measures, as great advantage lies in their settlement while delay and in-attention will have serious results. The igno- Ij rant can easily be decieved, and thereby the enemy can gain strength, although he may not possess any real advantage or power* } I would call your attention to the saying which I have mentioned above of the blind and senseless man* You will see in the 'Al-Kowkab B dated the 17th February,1920 f that people have already started calling meetings and gatherings, and making speeches and publications of the undesirable type in their own language. This makes friends sorry and ene mies glad. Were I asked as to my opinion about the solution of this problem, I should say something. Thirdly, let it be oladrly understood that the whole of the Islamic world, with the exception of Central Arabia, have, &lt; ^as / W^re^gious faith that every guardianship(khilafat) except that of Turks, is void, awd the ‘Shareef (king Husain) got up^ln the hope of replacing them (Turks) in * Khilafat ; and he gives hopes to his followers that he will be your rival, which is the hope of all of them - May God frustrate their hope • I, personally, told your honour the whole account ofo&amp;l n Syrians who, as I said, have no real power themselves, but are in the hands of the userper ,that is officers and-4- offtolalB foria«rXy attached to the Turkish army and certain other wild adventurers. The best confirmation their atti tude is to be found in the words of Sir Reginald Wingate,the late High Commiealoner in Egypt, for he said attributed the conquest of Syria to the Arab Array and he turned their heads by saying this. Fourthly, let it be clearly understood that as long as the Shareef and hie sons continue to have any connections with the affairs of Syria or its neighbouring countries other than the Hejaz, so long is it inevitable that he (and his sons) should continue to oppose you both inwardly and out wardly, because they have something at heart. As the saying goes 'A man’s enemy is he who shares his work' (Men of the same profession seldom agree). I have really been tedious in writing all this, although X had personally explained to you everything in detail in the course of our interview. I think that would suffice, but if you like, would write at greater length. My father and sons, Faisal and Stud, send you their best salaams. I hope you will convey my best salaams to the Honourable Colonel Wilso&gt;v» This is what had to be said and may you be preserved. r-7 y R^. Telegram. R.Pty. From Dickson,Bahrein.

I have had no previous intimation of charges brought forward by Bin Baud* People of Syria have little sy^athy with Husain and relations between him and Faisal are at present rather strained so it is unlikely King it at head of any Jehad movement in Byria. (At the same time) in eyes of many Arab Moslems he is undoubtedly on trial and when partition of Syria is announced he will probably feel himself bound, as origi nator of (negotiations) with us, to repudiate it and identify himself with Syrian (Nationalists). Whether he will do so by resignation or actual (corrupt group) remain(s) to be seen. S It is obvious (however) that Syrian Arab extreraiit are more and more (inclined to) link themselves with Turks and Bolsheviks and will do so unless they are given a measure of independence which will satisfy their ideas. His previous loyalty inclines me to believe he will take no other action unless forced by circumstances and that he still (hope)s for a solution which will render possible maintenance of his friendship with Great Britain King’s telegram to (Faisal) published in Press to the effect that he will repudiate any agreement made by Faisal which does not safeguard Arab independence and his reported despatch of arris and money to Syria show way he is trending.

Recent history and present state Hassa which can be compared Hejaz is standing proof of Bin Baud’s ability rule in strong sagacious and tolerant manner. All realise Bin Baud is statesman before fanatic and would stand no nonsense from wilde» elements his subjects.@&gt; Translation of a latter dated 22nd Rajab 1558 (= 12th April 1920) from Bin Baud to Major H.R.p.Mokson, 0 #I«e*, political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments; I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter of 9th Rajah 1558 which contained the telegraphic com munication from the honoured Colonel Wilson, Civil Commission^’ , Baghdad on the subject of Sharif Husain 1 s report that my forces burnt two villages near Taifj that the attacking force consisted^ of H&amp;jd tribes of Subala# la gum and ’ Ataibah incited or le&amp;d by Rhalidj and that they had killed two men of ai-Harith tribe, you remarked that you would be obliged by my informing you of the true facta of the matter. 1 now inform your honour of the facta. It is true that two villages were burnt and some men were killed and others captured* All that happened while I was at Bassa. The real facts of the matter, as I now know them my self will appear to you from a perusal of the (enclosed) letters of Khalid and Ibn Ghannam. 1 did not hasten to send the news on to your honour, even though 1 received it myself, for two reasons! firstly, X know very well, as do©# also B.B.M's Government that the Sharif has always been sending up false reporta ( and I wanted to see what he would do on this occasion) Secondly, X supposed that perhaps the Sharif had laid the blame on his own subjects of the borders of Eijaz who were the real aggressors and had burnt the two villages in question! but (I now see) that he put it down to my subjects. Further, the man againet whom Khalid and his followers the said Subaia, Bagum and «Ataibah had advanced was Ibn Muharris of Ash-Shal4wat (tribe) of Tarabah who is one of my subjeota. this man turned traitor it seems and joined Raqi bln Farm one of the Sharif's adherents who came down (to Tarabah) to commit a raid, as it described in Khalid*a letter (enclosed). The Sabaia* and Bagum and some of the * Ataibah whowho wore near by ’fazaa-ed* (rushed to arias) on eettAya; wind~SiT tne raid, attacked the raiders and repulsed %£fmwe-eajturing the booty taken by the Sharifian foro|^7^terwar^ethey\«ae down upon Ibn Muharria, my own subject, punished him for his disloyalty and treason in Joining the itfiairf 1 a force against our own subjects, the proof of his disloyalty, while being one of my subjects, lies in the letter of 'Hath wa Bakht tt (safe conduct) under the Shafcfcf * a signatures, which was found in his house afterwards. This man Ibn Huharrls had also committed many other evil acts including murder and rapine. I did not imagine that the Sharif would complain about one of my men punishing another for a fault. In addition, I should like to inform your honour, as I did before, that as long as the disputes between the Sharif and myself remain unsettled, so long there is bound to be trouble between the subjects of both sides, for you know the nature of Arabs* there are foolish and t evil characters on both sides who are irresponsible though not of any importance. These no one can check or control until the outstanding questions between us their rulers are settled. It is he (Sharif) alone.who represents these (petty) matters to H.B.M’s Government, and It suits him to use falsehood and magnify matters! while euoh affairs are in reality of daily occurrence among the subjects of neighbouring Arab rulers who still continue to be friends. For instance, such things happen between Ibn Eaahid and myself or Ibn Sabah and myself and among other neighbouring Arab rulers* punishments are meted out to offenders and losses of sufferers made good. But the Sharif Husain only wants to change you® ideas or opinion (about me) and does t**k not feel ashamed of telling lies as this is his habit. I have already stated the truth of the matter as will be seen from a perusal of the letters of Khalid and Ibn Qh&amp;rm sjn (enclosed) * Usual Ending* 11 ft fill Ifiiettsr of Khalid bin Manaur# Amir of Khurma, to Bind gaud dated 25th Jamadi I *58 ( » 16th February 1920 After Compliments # I beg to inform you of the state ofjaffairs of this part of the country* All is well and there is peace and tranquillity except a little disturbance due to the flhaiif * s acts which have roused the people and made the Akhwan here rather restless* I have been trying to pacify them and tell them that the Imam does not approve of this (disturbance of peace) but impresses on us the need for peace and quiet* Recently the Sharif sent a force headed by Raqi ai-Farm and Sanahat at Kharras with one of the Asharaf whose name X could not ascertain# They assembled in the plain between Khurma and Hudbn and raided the al-Harlq and Kura an as also a number of our nomads (of /Khurma) and Tarabah (may they be destined to failure I) taking about 100 camels and killed about 500 goats and killed 7 men. When the news of the event reached our tribesmen they at once made a fazaa and it was ascertained that the raiding party was asoretly invited by Ibn MSharrla 80 of whose carnal-riders took part in the raid. When we arrived on the scene, they were still fighting, so we attacked then togMler. We re-captured 80 oanelt out of the 100 looted and also took Ibn Muharris and his party. I would have disliked telling you what sort of nan Ibn Muharris was lest you put it down to 111 will on ny part, but, Vhank GodI here is a clear proof, firstly, he Joined Sharif's fores secondly, this (enclosed) is hi. letter shewing he was In secret correspondence with Sharif.

The only answer I have returned is that whosoever would like to come over to our side must sever all connection with Shat if and his subjects and that on doing so, he will have nothing to fear those who obey the Sharif^ I wrote ^and who follow his ways must be regarded as he is regarded himself (enemy) feu understand these affairs too well to need explaining at length.

It is for this reason ||g that I do not delay or hesitate, in submitting these necessary ^ and important communications, knowing well that these concern H.B.M’s Government and myself. These are as follows; I have received a letter from Amir Faisal together with an enclosure, inviting me to an alliance with him and his adherentsi These letters were accompanied by certain undesirable instructions and exhortations in book form that are opposed to our interests, that is to say, the interests of I.B.M.’s Government, as well as my own. (The letters and pamphlet were sent me) with spies of unknown identity, and borrowed Arab names with the object of promulgating the views expressed therein throughout this our Arabian ‘ peninsula and gaining the participation of Arabs in | their evil aims and objects. It is also certain that they have sent (similar communications and) men to Ibn Rashid, Ibn Sha’&amp;lax the Imam Tahya and the Idriai Amir of ’Assir. This evil propa- I ganda la likely to gain In bulk and extent in a short tine and if it is onoe ablaze then it will be impossible to extinguish I and will set us on fire with its flames. Hegleot or inattention | of the above will only injure me and my friend the British Seven I ment. Seeing that it is impossible for me to mix myself up with I the above sort of ideas, 1 am left face to face with a serious I and impending danger. What prevents my Joining hands with them K is the existence of treaty between my friend the British Govern- I ment and myself and it is our strictest religious duty and obligation to be faithful to our promises, Just as God the Most/ most Gracious has said 'if* thsy abide (by promises made) to you# you should abide (by promises made ) to them' ( quotation from the Holy quran with reference to vows and prondraes m&gt; changed between Muslims and People-of-the-Boqk)• 80 # I am obliged to act up to my treaty^qbli^atiorj^f in conformity with this holy revelation. 1 ) This (enclosed) letter of the Shari^f(Faisal) is a testi mony of what I explained to your honour personally. The contents! of the pamphlet are exhortations addressed to the inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula, vf which a gist is given below# they were drawn up secretly in the form of a note or Memorandum by the Arab national Committee which was recently formed in Damascus• The following are samples of the contents: 'The English are the most cunning of all the nations on earth and most avaricious# selfish# deceitful# hypocritical# vicious and partial to their own class and religion. They hope to rule over the whole world, though after generations. They have fixed lines of action to attain that end and follow certain cardinal rules and general principles. They have sel* sctsd special men for each particular line of action who work out and hand over results and propositions to their successors and assistants to complete and put into action by degrees, and aa opportunities occur.* By spreading such doctrines they wish to sow the seeds of hatred and contempt in the hearts of Arabs, another paragraph of the secret note says 'As a result of this War the Inglish have achieved the highest point of political power and' it is evident to every acute observer of politic, and international affairs that they will fall down from this pinnacle quickly, and will not attain mastery over , the world which they covet by these means, the near approach of this down-fall is evinced by certain signs to which we will refer in brief, as a detailed account of same would r quire a big book, firstly, it is human nature to love freedom and independence, and to hate being ruled over by others, yetyet all nations now realize that the English are trylWlhat (to rule over them),* ®y this they (our enemies) w&lt;5tad'convey that the British Government is not strong enough tf hold its own hut is about to meet its downfall, whicil God forbi\. Thus they would belittle her (British Gove^nSi^t)Mn lyfe eyes of , v Arabs| Still another para reads:'The Bolslraviks who overwhelmed the Russian Empire have now tired out the British and their Allies who sought in vajjk to control and subjugate them, fhese Bolsheviks have stamped their power and prestige in the East and .are assisted by all the Islamic nations in the East not only for the sake of Bolsheviks as such but because they are the enemies of all aggression ( lit * colonisation) which they are endeavouring to prevent. Hence they are, helping Turks, Circasians, Persians, Afghans and all the Muslims of the East to oppose the English and to help India which is already in the throes of rebellion against them. With these other Muslims, it is hoped that Arabs and Kurds will now join because all have now realized what they did not know before namely the danger to their nation, their religion and their country.' fhis above is said with the object of poisoning the minds of the Arabs of this peninsula, just as they have already done in the case of some Arabs of ‘Iraq, Syria and Kurdistan, against the British Government and their Allies, as also to make them believe that there are great forces opposed to the forces of H.B.M's Government and their Allies* To quote another para of the note: -They (the British) are the most deceitful of people for in every matter they make use of clever and double meaning words in making agreements, by means of which they find .a way out of every difficulty and are enabled to act contrary to®these agreements and treaties still claiming to act in accordance therewith, they in this way manage to make their opponents out as the breakers of these conditions, prinoe Bismark the greatest politician of his time has said of them that they are the cleverest of all peop in I |Q 1 ayfPin getting out of treaties by means of interpretation. We have an object-lesson in their treaty with the aharif Musairi whom they promised to help £o form an independent kingdom oft all the Arab countries and they have acted to &gt;ha oAntra another lesson is their making of a treaty l^e ^^feir xbn Baud ruler of lajd and then fettering him fo believed that this treaty will not be ratii^iad until they have established their rule in ’Iraq and extended it to Syria and Palestine by means of strategic railway lines which would give them a hold over his territories and others.' By the above it is intended to create a suspicion against the Great Government and to make me hostile to her in order that they might realize their vain hopes. One more quotation: 'She (Great Britain) has derived benefit from the hostilities and fighting that have been going on between the Hi jaz and Kajd.' They would vainly wish me to depart from my friendship with my friend the Great Government} whereas that friendship is most essential to my personal as well as political interests. I am sending to your honour the communication which they have published under the title 'English Aims in Hijaz etc* Also a letter from Amir Faisal» with its enclosure and copy of^ my reply together with its enclosure for your information and perusal. You will then know their evil tricks and will see that we have a danger to face now and cannot Ignore it. We must find and employ an effective remedy. You will kindly submit copies of these to the higher Authorities at once, so that joint action may be taken without delay; to enable me check this serious matter (menace) before it spreads over my country.

However, what you remarked about the matters concerning your father (King Husain) and your brother (myself), it is obvious that a detailed review of the same will be too . long (for this note), lour Excellency is, doubtless, aware of some of the circumstances and initial causes* God knows that 1 did not bring that (situation) about, nor did I wish or even believe it to be so* The following events will bear out the above statement* Firstly, his (King .Husain’s) attack on Hajd and capture of Saad bin Abdur Hahman on whom may God have mercy! Xou know he(Saad) had only a handful of men from among the Bedouins and our own forces were quite sufficient to extripate him* To my mind, the capture of Saad in the centre of Sajd and hie confinement (by King Husain) was a disgrace to me, yet 1 let it pass off only to maintain peace and to show my respect for him (king Husain) and lour Excellency* Secondly, at the time of your fighting with the Turks, 1 was able to withhold assistance by keeping apart my own forces and by forbidding my subjects to fight on your aide, or even to waise a countermovement* To this end the Turks did not omit to offer me solemn pledges and substantial promises the real nature of which is known to H.B*M's Government* In spite of all this., I did not make or allow tjie least hostile movement against your interests until at last when I found letter of vour fahter (Kin* t.n t.h« XMira of Ha.ld Amir Faisal* In the name of God, ©to bahalf• This is what is Wished for and it is not too much for incitingamjfli inciting them to ravolt againat ua * thank cod! they are not capable of rebellion even if they besome excited - also letters to the inhabitants of Tarabah and Khurmp. aqd their friends showing religious hatred and declaring thki \hop© who follow the Inhabitants of Hajd/^ai^^afi^^iherttios) •KhawariJ' (apostates)* f ,/ Thirdly, even since God ordained the affair (conflict) between your brother Abdullah and some of our forces in connection with certain caravans of Mecca and Medinah, the l|; i condition of both these towns is extremely wretched and the majority of the inhabitant* have been inviting me to (go and rule over) themf but I h^ve desisted from taking this step, the firstly to show respect to God’s Harem and secondly to/Holy prophet’s oity (blessings be on him! ) These facts are well- known to your Excellency and you are my best witness* i . -i.s regards an agreement wih your father poposed to be arrived at through your excellency, it is clear that such an agreement would be most welcome to me on all grounds, religious as well as moral.

Akhwan movement is viewed with increasing oomolaoenoe in Bahrain itself and Bin Saud has received numerous letters from Chiefs of Trueial Coast making overtures to him. Bin Saud has | not replied to these letters. (3) Kind Hussein is apparently unsuccessfully endeavour- ^ ing to utilise Shaikh Isa of Bahrain as counter blast to Bin Saud. There has certainly been much correspondence between the two recently. Friction between Bahrain and Meid is noW acute in regard to customs matters and questions of protection of Hajd subjects in Bahrain which Bin Saud requests us to exercise on his behalf contrary to the wishes of the Shaikh of Bahrain. (4) Probability of Bin Saud seising Mecca is being discussed with complacence in Bahrain and elsewhere in Persian Gulf and in Mesopotamia. General opinion appears to be not unfavourable to such a Consummation as it is believed that this would be in interests of religion and would make pilgrimage safer.

After Compliments, The object of writing this cordial letter is to enquire after your Honour’s health* regarding my condition it is very good God be praised except that in these days I have suffered a good deal from ill-health, but thank God, I have recovered complete health again and 1 am quite well now* 1 once more desire to represent your Honour in the matter of the Sharif that for the last three years I have been communicating with the High Government about him, and have been keeping in check the inhabitants of sajd, notwithstanding all that has happened through his evil acts in the past and recently* Of all these acts I informed your Honour and you made me a solemn j promise to stop him; Having become helpless by his ina 1 ** *»«+« +- do mischief in all external movements he has become lik who exoites others* May his evil movements turn on to h head* Once more oejrtain hostile movements have been com by him; ho has sent one of the Aaharaf accompanied by a individual of ’Aslr armed with money to stir up evil mo and committing other evil actions, which it would take too long kinsmen who reside on our side appealing to them against the evil acta of the Sharif which are contrary to reason and Shara’. Moreover affairs have been qul*t for a long time between us and the inhabitants of Yemen, Saiyed Idrisi, and Ibn *Ayidh but the Sharif has now widened his intrigues to the extent of bribing the people of *Asir, with the object of persuading them to break their solemn promises in order that trouble may ©nsusf They would appear to have selected as t heir instruments certain of my subjects and those of Saiyed Al-Idrisi and trouble has started in the South of Qafatan* As a result Saiyed Al— a*P*Dickson, C*I»£*, Political Agent, Bahrain from Ghamld up to Asirj these take the form of blocking the roads to mention* The net result has been that the inhabitants of Idris!jirlai has sent to ny subj.ote oalltng thorn in ooooriwioo with th# pl»ag» 'M-oh oaiota botwosn ua, to help .bin against Ibn ayiCh. apart from th. above the Sharif's intrigues ay* fin from right up to ‘Asir* vA A tew days ago oartain of th© inhabitants if Hizaj lx»d wid cam® ov®r to I#Jd. They hav© aoouaed me of not keeping faith and breaking my promises which X had made them, namely that the High Government would effect a settlement between the two of us end that evil movements would disappear and peace would be restored and the Haj reopened, (in truth they are right) for I do not observe any of these to hav© happened. It was my intention from the beginning to fight a battle with Sharif and insha Allah it would be easy for me t o deal with him. He on his part has endeavoured to discredit me with my subjects. The people of Hejd are of two groups. Th© lastern md the northern want the Haj reapendd and a settlement of th© question - while the Western and Southern groups who reside on the borders of the Sharif's country and who have been harmed by the many evil and sneaking movements of the Sharif desire the reverse. These latter have been greatly tmbittered and I fear on this account that certain acts may result for which you will probably blame me. The fact that my people on the borders raided and plundered by the Sharif who exceeds all bounds of propriety, and then goes and complains to His Majesty's Government about my peoples act, men who have not committed l/lOth the harm that the Sharif has done, in beyond all suffranco• X get blamed by His Majesty's Government and get blamed by my subjects - An intolerable situation* % X now therefore Inform and request your Honour to oommuni—, cate the matter to your High Government in order that they may either settle the question finally and definitely leaving what is ^ my hands to me and in the Sharif's hands to him) ort o leave the matter for settlement between th© two in their own fashion. Sooner or later the latter course is bound to take place.

When I was at Baghdad I mentioned to you that when Mr. Maopherson of Gray Paul's and I were at Bahrain there was a good deal of discussion about a small ship to ply between Bahrain, Katif, Ojair and Dohah, but it never materialized on account o^ the War.

I enclose a copy of his reply and of my answer thereto. I presume the query in the last para means that if Bin Saud ' started a port the slow mail would occasionally Pall there and so there would not be much necessity for a small ship. At the samestime I understood from the Commander of the ’’Palinurus when he was surveying that part of the Gulf, that the approaches to the harbour at Has Tanurah are very bad - the sea being full of reefs soma distance off the coast-.vhich makes it especially hard for ships of any size.

Throughout the file, there are items of numerous correspondence with Ibn Sa'ud detailing his subsidy, ongoing conflict with Ibn Rashīd of Ḥā’il and Sharīf Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī of Mecca at al-Khurmah and Turabah, as well as his views on British and French involvement in Syria, Iraq and Palestine.Contained within the file are papers related to Harold Richard Patrick Dickson's 1920 visit to Ibn Sa‘ūd at al-Ḥasa to discuss his subsidy, the Najd Mission to Bombay, the situation in Syria and Iraq, the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and his relations with Sharīf Ḥusayn. Included is Dickson's correspondence (folios 11-14, 33-42, 51-58, 99-103 and 159-199); a list of cash presents made by him (folios 59-60); and 'Diary of Political Agent, Bahrain, during his recent journey to Hassa and back January 29th to February 20th 1920' (folios 61-77, including a rough sketch of the town of Hofuf on folio 66). As a result of his visit to al-Ḥasa, Dickson also compiled 'Notes on the "Akhwan" Movement' which details the history, theology and customs of the Ikhwān movement, the system of Ibn Sa‘ūd's government, and its connection with the movement, and a list of settlements (
                           hijar) established by the movement (folios 105-120). There is also an extract from the Bahrain Political Agent's diary dated 31 December 1919 on the influence of the Ikhwān movement in Bahrain (folios 23-25).In the context of Ibn Sa‘ūd's ongoing conflict with Sharīf Ḥusayn, there are reports of attacks on villages in the vicinity of Taif (folios 212-217); letters written by Sharīf Ḥusayn, Khālid bin Manṣūr, Amir of al-Khurma, and Muḥammad bin Sa‘d bin Ghannām, Amir of Turabah (folios 230-239); and details of a mission from Sharif Faysal to Riyadh requesting Ibn Sa'ud's friendship (folios 242-267). In addition there is correspondence concerning a deputation from Kuwait to Riyadh following rising tensions between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Shaikh Sālim al-Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ as a result attacks by the Ikhwān movement under the leadership of Fayṣal al-Dawīsh (folios 346, 352-363).Also covered in great length within the file are preparations for a proposed meeting between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Sharīf Ḥusayn (folios 204-211, 221-226) in Aden with the possibility of Farḥān al-Rahmah or Dhari Beg accompanying Dickson on the mission (folios 315-318). In various correspondence with Ibn Sa‘ūd it is proposed that such a meeting should take place after the
                           hajjpilgrimage; Ibn Sa‘ūd performing the Hajj; Najd pilgrims should be accompanied by a qualified Indian Muslim officer and a meeting take place in Mecca between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Sharīf Ḥusayn (folios 319-328, 338-343). Khan Sayid Siddiq Hasan, Indian assistant at the Bahrain Agency, is proposed to accompany Najd pilgrims (folios 350-351). Sharīf Ḥusayn agreees to these terms (folios 374, 379). However, due to the requirement to limit the number of Najd pilgrims, Ibn Sa‘ūd is advised to refrain from making pilgrimage himself (folios 435-439 and 444).Also included within the file is correspondence concerning:Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd's visit to London (folios 45 and 92) and the announcement in
