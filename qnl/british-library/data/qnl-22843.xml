The local police have authority to arrest deserters or persons suspected of being deserters, but such persons cannot be prosecuted for desertion in the local courts. The power of the civil courts is confined to establishing that a person so arrested is in fact a deserter. Once this has been done the arrested person is handed over to the Kavljsi/ authorities for disposal under Kaval or Military law. 3. Under the immigration regulations in Bahrain and Kuwait all persons entering these States must be in possession of a passport, or other travel document bearing a valid visa. Persons not in possession of such a document are liable to a punishment of imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months or to a fine not exceeding $3,500/-, or to both had may also be directed to remove himself forthwith or by any specified date or may be removed from Bahrain/Kuwait. 4. The Political Resident considers it preferable that Naval deserters on arrest should be handed over as soon as pos ible to the Naval authorities. If they are dealt with under the immigration regulations, the Political Agents will have to arrange their repatriation when they l^jve served theii sentences and this will involve a considerable amount of trouble and expense. 6. Persons aiding or abetting deserters can be dealt with by Political Agents under the criminal law. If there fore at any time you can produce definite evidence of such assistance or abetment, the Political Agents may be able to take appropriate action. •s Secretary to the political Kesident^in the Persian Gulf Copy jfco J1) The political Agent, Bahrain, 2) The Political Agent, Kuwait, together with Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf memorandum Ko.PG 193/114 dated the 4th July, 1948, for guidance. 1Copy of memorandum No. PG 193/114 dated the 4th July, 1948, from the Senior I^iaval Officer, Persian Gulf, Bahrain, to His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulfw Bahraa SOMALI MP GQANESE DESERTERS FROM H.M.SHIPS. I have been concerned at the steadily increasing number of Somali deserters from H.M. ships in the Gulf recently. The trouble lies basically in their extremely low rate of pay, and the fact that ten times as much is offered by any oil company for very unskilled duties in their camps ashore, particularly in Saudi Arabia. 2. As over half a dozen have gone in the last six months from various ships, I have an uneasy suspicion that by now some organisation may exist among ex-Somalies for contacting their brethren still serving and seducing them from their allegiance with offers of lucrative employment elsewhere. 3. I have issued oraers that ships are to report direct to the nearest Political Agent or Consul details of de deserters. 4. I would be very grateful if you could arrange, on receipt of such information, for the Political Agent concerned to inform local authorities of the details and either encourage them to prosecute under immigration laws, if and where iihese may exist, or apprehend and hand deserters over to the nearest Naval Vessel or Authority. Any further suggestion you may be able to offer to discourage such deserters would be welcomed. SD/t L.S.PORTER, Captain.
