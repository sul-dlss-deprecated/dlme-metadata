This proposal apparently also requires the Prince to pay 10,000 tomans annually for possession of Bahrain. Bruce states that His Highness the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd] will be annoyed and disgusted at the duplicity of the Persian Government. Bruce speculates that the Prince would have no objection to paying 10,000 tomans annually, as the revenues of Bahrain far exceed this sum.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000028#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
