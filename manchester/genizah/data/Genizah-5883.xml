The top line of the paper seems of a somewhat paler colour, the stamp broken as well as a few words at the top line, all of that being the outcome of this fragment having been glued to another fragment (Ar. 204-1, Ar. 204-2) to create one larger fragment: the stamp and writing when joined together make one comprehensive manuscript. It appears that another fragment, in Hebrew characters, was glued or stuck to this fragment, of which only small pieces were left Â– particularly at the top and at the right-top side.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:title>Arabic notes</dc:title></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
