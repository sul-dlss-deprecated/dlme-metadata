Financial Adviser. and Rs. 2,000 - English not Indian.'D ♦ CONFIDENTIAL. D.O. No. C/245, Muscat, the 14th March, 1941, During the course of an interview which I had with the Sultan on Saturday the 1st of march at his flat in Bombay he said that he was anxious to obtain the services of an Englishman as Financial Adviser as soon as possible. 2 . The Sultan wishes the Financial Adviser to take over complete control of the State finances and at the same time to acquire a knowledge of the political situation so that he will be in a position to give advice to His Highness's representative when His Highness is absent from Muscat. The appointment will relieve the Sultan of work which he finds irksome and will at the same time permit him to be away in Dhofar for three or four months at a time. At present,while the Sultan is in sole control of the exchequer it is not possible for him to be away from tele graphic communication for a prolonged period of time. He hopes to visit Dhofar for four months this winter and contemplates paying an annual visit every summer. 3 . The Sultan's desire for an Englishman is satis factory. To have a competent officer in charge of the Muscat finances will be of advantage both to the Government of India and to the Sultan. It will ensure that the maximam income is obtained and dispersed to the best advantage. The true financial position will be known for / the first The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.the first time for some years as the officer will have all the accounts his own keeping. Lastly, there will be an increase in British influence for if the officer is well selected the Sultan will give him his confidence and follow his advice. 4 . There are of course disadvantages but I do not propose to discuss the pros and cons of the case now. I am convinced that the pros outweigh the cons and suggest that enquiries be made demi-officially to ascertain whether a suitable officer could be made available. If such a person can be found then I will ask the Sultan to make a written request and will write to you officially on the subject. His Highness said he would be prepared to pay up to Rs. 2,000/- a month as salary.Telegram From To No. Dated TELEGRAM. .

I am sorry to hear you have not been well and am glad that you are once more able to enjoy life. It is nice to know that all is well in Dhofar. As regards the question of the Financial Advi8er f I have nothing to add to my last letter. I have forwarded your suggestion in regard to Captain Howes to the Hon’ble the Political Resident who will no doubt give it careful consideration. It is kind of you to write about Jebel Akhdar. It will not now be pos. ible^as you say / to go there this spring. I agree with you that the late summer will be the best time and if you will make such arrangements as may be possible I shall be grateful* as 1 very much wish to see that part of your territory. Caiyid Shahab* who is well, told me that he had heard from you and from Saiyid Taimur and that the latter hml arrived safely in Karachi. I hope he enjoyed his trip to Dehra dun. I am sorry that you have been delayed in India as there are several questions awaiting your return in particular that of Ibri which I would like to discuss fully with you in the near future. There has been his Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, BOMBAY. another case /another case of trading in slaves in our friend fheikh Hilal bin Hamad al Sa'adi's area which is not at all satisfactory! and it may have been necessary for me to telegraph to you in this connection before you receive this letter. There is also the question of the Municipality and the proposed new form of taxation to provide Municipal revenue which was to have been finally decided on your return. X saw Ismail ;^ffenai yesterday evening on my way thro* ugh Matrah. He was examining the work now being carried on his house and said he hoped to be able to get away to his home for a few months this hot weather. He looks as if he was in need of a rest and has not been home for some six yeurs I believe.CONFIDKNTXAL, D.O.No. C/309. Muscat, the 7th April, 1941. ITS I am enclosing a private letter which I received from the Sultan on the 2nd of April and my reply. 2 . The Sultan returned from his last visit to India in July last year, and when he stated in December last year that he contemplated another short visit to Karachi to see his father who had recently returned from Japan, I thought his desire a very natural one. ^hile in Karachi he said he would probably pay a visit to Bombay to consult his medical adviser and although l suspected that the cinemais in that town were probably the real reason for his visit I did not think that he intended to take up his residence there for a matter of months. The Sultan has now been away from Muscat ^ for just over three months and it is His Highness’s intention to extend his visit to Bombay where he has been since the beginning of February to the end of this month when he proposes to return to Karachi and there await a ship for Muscat. The Sultan has also told me that he contemplates a four month visit to Dhofar in the autumn so Muscat will not see much of him during the coming winter. These prolonged periods of absence from the ^tate ! would be less objectionable if the work of the Government was carried on efficiently while he was away, but unfortunat ely the machine of State gradually becomes slower and slower until it practically ceases to function. This is due to the fact that very few officials are capable of making even a minor / i'ble Lt.-Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.a minor decision when the Sultan is present and will make none at all in his absence lest he should express disapproval of their action on his return* Such disapproval in extreme cases might result in a reduction in the offender’s emoluments. 3. While in India the Sultan has on this occasion seen a great deal of his father, a man for whom he has the greatest respect, and it is not improbable that he will be, if he has not already been, influenced by the elder man's views on Muscat in general and in particular with regard to the Omanis and the possi bility of uniting the people of the country. Saiyid Taimur does not entertain very kindly thoughts regarding the Omanis and is unlikely to have encouraged his son to think that the unification of Muscat and Oman even if possible would be profitable. vtoen Saiyid Taimur abdicated the Sultan had not the experience he now has of the ways of his subjects and it is probable that the views expressed by his father at that time were more than discounted by the Sultan’s youthful enthusiasm and the natural pleasure he must have felt at the thought of ruling his own country. Now however, if the elder man has been giving utterance to the same views, I am inclined to think they will have made more impression. Saiyid Taimur is undoubtedly a successful ex-Sultan and seems to have vastly enjoyed his life since he relinquished the title and with it the cares of offic^ and &gt; apart from anything which he may have said to his son ^iis life of ease and pleasure, simple though it is, must appeal to one who has never had a very p*a&gt;U~ liking for hard and often ill rewarded work. The Sultan is a clever man of unusual strength of char acter and has done much for his country but he could have done more if he had not been hampered by lack of capable assistants and an inclination to make undesirable favourites to whom from time to time he has given considerable power. The Sultan has interested himself in finance and the State appears to be financially more \ sound than /sound than it was even two years ago but as we have no access to the accounts or pass-books it is really quite impossible to make any reliable pronouncement on the real state of affairs. That he has done much for the State is to his credit, that he now shows si^ns of wishing to relinquish responsibility must, I think, be ascribed to his descent. The family is degenerate and the Sultan* s weaknesses are hereditary ana not acquired. The birth of His Highness*s son in Dhofar will probably prevent him from making the supreme decision and endeavouring to follow in his father*s footsteps but it will be an added incentive to him to“pay prolonged visits to that province and we must be prepared to see him take less and less interest in the affairs of the rest of his State. 4 . i think the Sultan has already made up his mind on his line of action and that we are faced with a choice of three alternatives. They are (a) . To provide the State with a capable manager in whom both His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan can have confidence and to permit the Sultan to reside wherever he wishes. (b) . To permit the Sultan to retire to Dhofar and allow the State to be run by a Council of Ministers or a Regent assist ed as far as is practicably possible by the Political Agent. (c) . To endeavour to f orc e the Sultan to rule and to spend most of his time at the seat of G overnment. I consider that it would be unprofitable to force a man of His Highness’s disposition and character to do what is not congenial to him and so I do not recommend the last alternative. The second alternative has been tried on more than one occasion and is not satisfactory, as the Ministers or Regent have no real power and are afraid to act on their own initiative lest the Ruler returns and takes exception to their acts, and as things are at present it is not desirable for the Political Agent to interfere to too great an extent. The first alternative is in my opinion /4 9 * f' my opinion the best and I would like to see a capable man take over the control of affairs. When I met him in Bombay the Sultan asked for a Financial Adviser who would not only manage the finances of the Sultanate but who would, to quote his letter,assist other matters'*. Whether such an arrangement is or is not beneficial to India and Muscat is a matter of opinion. Should the Government of India decide that it is advisable to accede to the Sultan's request and can find a suitable person to fill the appointment, I have little doubt that the Sultan will gradually permit complete control of the State to pass into the hands of this official. His Highness will relinquish any ideas he may have regarding Oman and will settle down ^probably in Uhof ar^ to a peaceful existence sure in the knowledge that the policy of his country is being guided by a competent British official, naturally persona grata with his protector Great Britain, to the best advantage and with careful regard to economy in State finances and the improvement of trade. whether such an appoint ment will prove a success will depend on the ability and person ality of the 'Financial Adviser' who will shortly after he arrives be faced with difficult financial and other problems, and who will have to deal with a suspicious and ungrateful but strengly likeable people. /a\ \ * Telegram - ’’Q 11 From To No. Dated 2 .

Bated, P,6th June, 1941. My telegram No.T/74 dated June 15th* P. Pettyfer has seen me here and I have discussed the question with him. He is not willing to accept the additional appointment of Financial Advieer. 3. Pettyfer has informed me officially that he wishes to he relieved of his appointment at the earliest possible date. He savs that he is getting very out-of- date with military teaching, that at the Muscat rate he may come up for command before the end of the year r and that his health will be impaired by a third hot weathe: in Muscat. 4. It would not be in the interest of the service to require Pettyfer to remain in Muscat but a suitable relief must be provided. I doubt if a suitable Junior Officer will be made available but it would probably be possible for a Lieutenant Colonel who has finished command and would in normal condition retire on pension to be posted as Military Adviser only and unless this officers capability was known to you. I would not recommend his appointment as Financial Adviser until /'.* of his personality and efficiency had shown him to be suitable. 5. In the event of a retired officer being appointed I presume that the Muscat Government would not be liable for leave and pension contributions. Thus emoluments of a retired Lieutenant Colonel would approximate to those of Pettyfer*%\XUSH CONFIDENTIAL. D.O, No. 397-S of 1941.

At first sight, it would appear that Khan Bahadur ^aqoul Hussain is not very good at budgeting. But I knot that thfc Sultan took a close interest in the preparation of this budget ana 1 imagine that tne Khali Bahadur was therefore somewhat restricted• 3. The Sultan lo&gt;ks upon Dhof.ir as his private estate. The main reasons aru, I think, freedom from local intrigue, better living conditions, and freedom froa restraint in tho matter of lining hie own pocket. Uoa much losigur public opinion will permit him to enjoy hie privileges without assuming their cor~i eupondisg responslbllitieB is a period that cannot be estimated. 1 understand, however, tiiat he intends to retirn to his capital next autumn and it would be satisfactory if he were to divide his time equally between Muscat and SalBlah. 4.

Your sincere friend, Said bin TaimurPolitical Agent, Muscat, (camp) Karachi. To Brit Ain, Bushire. No.R-6. Dated 6th, June, 1945. Reference correspondence on the subject of the deputation of Khan Bahadur Maqbul Hussain to the Muscat State, resting with your telegram No.572, dated the 7th. March, 1944? 2. I enclose a copy of letter No.S/9, dated the 23rd. May, 1945, from the Sultan in which he has asked that Maqbul Hussain should continue in his service for a further unspecified period. On receipt of this letter I informed the Sultan that, in view of the abuses in the customs ecminis tration to which his attention had been drawn, I should find it difficult to take up the matter on the basis o+ his request as it stood. I suggested that he might feel it more appropriate to confine his request to the loan of a Finance Officer for his State and to leave to the Government of India the question of replacing the present encumbent or allowing him to continue on deputation for the present. To this suggestion the Sultan agreed. • 3. It is of the highest importance to Muscat that the State Finances continue to be managed by an officer of experience who possesses a sound knowledge of the principles afid working of budgetary finance. As there is no one amongst the State officials to whom this task could be entrusted, I would urge that until the question of an Adviser to the Muscat Government has been settled, arrangements be made to continue the loan of a Finance Officer from Government service. 4. By July of this year Khan Bahadur Maqbul Hussain will have served in his present post for over ^ years and for this reason and for the reason mentioned in paragraph 2 of this letter I consider that his deputation with the Muscat Government should not be further extended beyond the period ne cessary to arrange for his relief. I would accordingly request that the question of finding a suitable successor be examined as soon as possible. My records do not show the date on which Khan Bahadur Maqbul Hussain is due to retire but I believe that this coincides approximately with the termina tion of his present period of deputation. 5. For the future, I suggest that the Sultan be informed that the duties of a Finance Officer should be confined to the management of the SAate finances and that he should endeavour to find a separate official to undertake the ad ministration of the Customs.

It begins with discussion of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] wish to appoint an English official to the position of Financial Adviser, and goes on to discuss at length the deputation of Khan Bahadur Sahib Maqbul Hussain, Treasury Officer at the Muscat Political Agency, as Finance Officer to the Muscat Government. The deputation, which begins in October 1941, and is initially intended to last for a period of three months, eventually comes to an end in 1946, with the appointment of Hussain's successor. Related matters of discussion include the following: the Sultan's decision in January 1944 to increase Hussain's salary, in recognition of the latter having recently taken on the responsibilities of Director-General of Customs; arrangements for Hussain's successor to be recruited from the Government of India's Customs Department, with a view to the successful candidate being appointed as Director-General of Customs only; the appointment in 1946 of M A Rashid, an appraiser at Customs House, Calcutta, as Director-General of Customs.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; the Government of Muscat's Director-General of Customs; officials of the Government of India's External Affairs Department and, towards the end of the file, officials of the recently formed Government of Pakistan.The Arabic language material consists of correspondence between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat, and representatives of the Government of Muscat and Oman, including the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Director-General of Customs</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Employment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
