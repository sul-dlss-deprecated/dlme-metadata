The letter goes on to discuss Green's fears that Afghanistan and Beloochistan [Baluchistan] could rise against the British and that they would be aided by Persia and Russia in doing so, and his belief that occupying Quetta would prevent this from happening.The letter also discusses the Bombay Government and their decision to withdraw troops from the frontiers; troop movements in Scinde [Sindh]; the expecation of news of Sir Colin Campbell's success at Lucknow; Green's fears that the atrocities being committed by the British are equal to those committed by the rebels and citing an example of these atrocities in Rajpootana [Rājasthān] which he believed could lead to further mutiny and rebellion across the country.The letter concludes with news of colleagues from Scinde who are returning to England or who have been appointed to new positions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024079755.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
